History and development Imami jurists and early works Considering different stances in relation to Juridical rules and principles, there are some parties in the schools of Principles. These schools try to apply analytical approaches in their methodology. There are somebodies such as Zorarah Ibn Aayon, Muhammad Ibn Moslem, Abu Basir and also Hisham Ibn Salem. Among these individuals, Hisham Ibn Salem and His Pupils had eminent roles in development of principles among Shia.http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/9844 In this period two problems are so important such as difference of hadith in one hand and the distinctions of Ijtihad or authority in other hand. There are two early scholars in principles of jurisprudence who were eminent including Hisham ibn Hakam and Yunes Ibn Abd Al Rahman. Some scholars know Hisham ibn hakam and Hisham ibn Salem among the outstanding pupils of Imam Sadiq and Imam Kazim. they wrote important books in the field of principles of jurisprudence such as \\"Kitab Al Akhbar\\" and \\" Kayfa Taseh\\" or \\"How it is correct?\\" Period of establishment It seems that the dominant current was the Adherents of Hadith during the fourth century of Lunar hijrah. They didn't any need to knowledge of principles and put it away. On the other hand, the relatives of Nobakhti begun a new movement in the sphere of theology and kalam among Shia and Imamiyyah. Abu Sahl Nobakhti, the popular theologian of Shia schools, could present a new and complete theological system along with Shia characters. In fact, Abu Sahl Nobakhti concerned with the principles through the theological works such a way that he referred to some questions in the field of the principles. According to Madlung this approach of Abu Sahl Nobakhti and his theological system was along with defending of Imami creeds and theological beliefs. Maybe the most important Abu Sahl's essay in the principles is the essay of \\"Naqz Al Shafe'ei or the refusing the shafe'ei which is written against Shafe'ei and also counted as the first completed work in the principles among imamiyyah. Besides he wrote some books on the subjects of refusing Qyias in jurisprudence and ijtihad Al R'ay. Of course, there is no track from these works and they are lost. During the fourth century of Hijrah, already one trend is very dominant which is indeed on the basis of refusing of Qiyas and R'ay in jurisprudence. Also, there were many books concerned with these subjects among imami theologians. For example Hasan ibn Mousa Nobakhti wrote a book by the name of \\"A book on the khabar Vahed and Amal\\". According to this work, there is no application for Qiyas and R'ay. Among the first Mutakalim Jurists in the fourth century is Ibn Abi Aqil Ammani as someone who possessed a school which his method was similar to Twelve Imams of Shia and somehow like the Mutazilite schools of thought. =Ibn Abi Aqil And his thought= His complete name was Ibn Abi Aqil Ammani and he came from the Yemen. He was contemporary with Shaykh Koleini. Ibn Aqil counted as pioneer jurist in the principles. He could establish an approach on which his juridical methodology was dependent on Quranic rules and known traditions. He is the author of a legal work entitled Mutamassak bi Habl Al Rasul, which was one of the most renowned legal sources during the 4th and 5thllOth and 11th centuries. He is the first one who arrange the knowledge of fiqh and give consistency to it.http://lib.eshia.ir/10257/15/6/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86_%D8%B9%D9%82%DB%8C%D9%84_%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C =Ibn Jonayd Eskafi= Ibn Jonayd Eskafi was one of the first and eminent Shia jurists during the fourth century lunar hijrah.http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/1513 He had different approach in understanding of Shia's traditions. He believed that there is a theological basis for interpretation of Hadith on which the Juridical tradition of Imams is not according to Saying but to Ray or opinion. He was an eminent religious scholars among elites. Also Ibn Nadim knows him as great scholars among shia.http://lib.eshia.ir/10242/27/200 One of his most important book in Fiqh is Tahzib Al Shia le Ahkam Al Shariah.http://lib.eshia.ir/10242/27/207 Period of development Needless to Usul becomes indispensable when Shia community far away from twelve periods. Also, appearance of new subjects intensify this necessity. In development epoch we confronted with three eminent masters in the field of Usul and extending it namely Shaykh Mufid, Sharif Murtaza, Sallar Deylami and Shaykh Tusi. =Shaykh Mufid= He was also called Ibn Muallim, meaning \\"son of the teacher\\"; Muallim was his father. Among his teachers were the Shia theologian Abu Ali al-Iskafi, Abu Abdallah al-Marzubani, Abu Abdallah al- Basri, Abu al-Hassan, and Ali ibn Isa al-Rummani. Commonly known as the leader of the Shia, Al-Mufid is regarded as the most famous scholar of the Buyid period and an eminent jurist, mainly due to his contributions in the field of kalam. According to Ibn al-Nadim, who knew al-Mufid personally, he was the head of the Shia Mutekallimun in the field of kalam, and al-Tawhidi, who was also personally familiar with al-Mufid, described him as \\"eloquent and skillful at dialectic (jadal)\\". His skill in polemical debate was such that he was said to be capable of convincing his opponents \\"that a wooden column was actually gold\\". He was taught the Islamic science of hadith by Al-Shaykh al- Saduq. =Sharif Murtaza= He was born in Baghdad in 355 Lunar in Rajab Month. He was born in a prominent household. His lineage comes back to Imam kazim he was son of Al Sharif Abu Ahmad the son of Mosa son of Muhammad son of Musa son of Ibrahim son of Musa Kazim Therefore, his sixth ancestor was the seventh imam of Shia. His father called him Ali and his nickname was Murtaza. His honorific title was Alam Al Hoda. He called as Alam al Hoda according to a popular narration said by Shahid Avval in The book of Arbaeen as follow: the vizir of Abbasid dynasty namely Muhammad ibn Hosein became sick. He saw in his dreams Imam Ali while address him: tell alam Al Hoda till demand Health for you. When Muhammad ibn Hosein ask on the person with such a nickname he told : he is ali ibn Hosein or sharif Murtaza.magazine Baqyyah Allah, number 6,1412 lunar Hijrah ,p. 39 According to Murtaza, the first of religious duty is the obligation to reason to knowledge of God. The other duties are dependent to this first duty.Al-Murtaza is along with the Mu'tazilite starting-point that man's first duty is to use his reason to arrive at knowledge of God. Also in Kalam proof of the existence of God, he defends from the atomist' stance in versus of Aristotelian notion of substantial change. =Shaykh Tusi= He was born in Tus in Iran in 995 AD/385. In 1018 AD/408 A.H. His life was along with the government of Buyid dynasty. He was born according to praying of twelfth imam of shia namely Mahdi He learned significant level of Islamic sciences of that period in Tus in Khorasan. he left Tus to study in Baghdad. In 1055 AD/447 A.H Tughril-bek entered Baghdad. there he could participate in the courses of Shykh Al-Mufid as paramount teacher. Also he wrote some of his books when he was between twenty and thirty. When he was forty-two he participated in the class of his master namely Shaykh Murtaza. At this time many Muslim scholars in Baghdad, both Sunni and Shi øite were killed. The house of al-Shaikh al-Tusi was burnt down, as were his books and the works he had written in Baghdad, together with important libraries of Shi'ite books. Al- Tusi went to al-Najaf after the fall of Baghdad. He died at Najaf on the 22nd of Muharram in the year 460 A.H/2 December 1067.in confliction between two schools of Ahbaris and usuli, Shaykh Tusi defended of Usuli school and calls akhbari as followers of literate or literalists. Shaykh Tusi believed in principles of jurisprudence as a fundamental knowledge in acquiring the judgments of Islam religion. he wrote in introduction of 'Al-Iddah' book as follow: \\" thus you may say, it is essential to attach the greatest importance to this branch of knowledge( namely Usul) because the whole of shariah is based on it and the knowledge of any aspect thereof is not complete without mastering the principles. Also he tries to compare different schools of law in Islam with each other and show there is a little divergence between them and they are near to each other and differences among them is in minor subject not major. Shaykh Tusi, like his Masters, refuted the legal analogy(Qiyyas Fiqhi) in his manual of usul Fiqh. Period of flourishing This period begins from the end of sixth into middle of eighth lunar hijrah. Scholars have written many detailed books in the field of principles. They concerned with principles in detail and accuracy. Scholars such as Ibn Zohreh halabi, Sadid Al Din Hemsi,Najm Al Din Helli,Allameh Helli, Amid Al Din A'araji, Zia Al Din A'araji, Fakhr Al Mohaqeqin, Muhammad Ibn Makki known as first martyr, Shaykh Abdullah Soyouri, Zain Al DIn Ibn Nour Al Din Ali Ibn Ahmad known A Second Martyr, all of them lived in this period. =Ibn Zohreh Halabi= His whole name is Ezz Al Din A l Makarem Sayyed Hamzeh Ibn Ali Ibn Zohreh. According To Moreza Mutahhari he learned Tusi's Nihayah under Ibn Hajib.http://lib.motahari.ir/Content/933/321 nearly 20th book attributed to him. Diversity of them shows his all around. His eminent book in principle is Qanyat Al Nozu fi Elmi Al Usul Va foru.http://www.cgie.org.ir/fa/publication/entryview/947 =Allameh Helli= Al-Hilli also known as the sage of Hilla,Jafri, S.H.M. \\"al- ·∏§illƒ´ , (1) ·∏éjÃ≤amƒÅl al-Dƒ´n ·∏§asan b.

Augustana. 13 April 2010 was born in the still existent town of Al Hillah (in what is now Iraq), commonly viewed as the centre of Shia Islam when Sunni leaders were in control over Baghdad during his life. He entered into a prominent family of Shia jurists and theologians. His father, Sadid ul-Din al-Hilli, was a respected mujtahid and a leading figure in the Shia community. His maternal uncle Muhaqqiq al-Hilli was also a renowned scholar.He studied theology and fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) in Hilla under the auspices of his father and his uncle, as well as other notable scholars, including: Ali bin Tawus and Ahmad bin Tawus.Tehrani, Aga Buzurg, Tabaqat 'Alam il-Shi'ah, v.5 p.52 (Arabic) He also spent some time at the newly established Maragheh observatory, where he studied Avicennan philosophy and mathematics under Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, and was also introduced to the works of Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. Later, he travelled to Baghdad and became acquainted with the doctrines of Ibn Arabi.Schmidkte, S. ·∏§ELLI, ·∏§ASAN B. YUSOF B. MO·π¨AHHAR. Encyclopaedia Iranica (www.iranicaonline.org, accessed: 28.09.09) Al-Hilli's role in shaping Twelver jurisprudence is of great importance. As well as several works and commentaries on usul al-fiqh, he produced a voluminous legal corpus. Of this, two of the most important works are al-Mukhtalaf (The Disagreement) and al- Muntaha (The End). Mukhtalaf is a legal manual devoted to addressing legal questions in which the Shia jurists hold differing opinions, whereas the Muntaha is a systematic and detailed exposition of al-Hilli's own legal opinions. He also wrote a summarized legal manual, Qawa'id ul-Ahkam, which was popular amongst later scholars, judging by the number of commentaries that would be written on it. Amongst his later legal works is Tadhkirat ul-Fuqaha, which is a legal manual intended for use by lay persons. He also composed legal works on specific issues (for example, Hajj or Salat). =Fakhr Al Muhaqeqin= Muhaqqiq was born in the city of al-Hilla, Iraq, where he would spend most of his life, to a family of prominent Shi'i jurists. He studied theology, fiqh and usul al-fiqh under his father. Muhaqqiq later became the leader of the Shi'i seminary there. He has many credible books in principles like Mabadi Al Osul, Fakhryyah and others. =First martyr= Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili al-Jizzini (1334‚Äì1385) also known as Shahid Awwal (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿ¥ŸáŸäÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸàŸÑash-Shahid al-Awwal \\"The First Martyr\\"), is the author of Al-Lum'ah ad-Dimashqiya (Arabic: ÿßŸÑÿØŸÖÿ¥ŸÇŸäÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÑŸÖÿπÿ©, The Damascene Glitter\\") and was a Shi'a scholar. Although he is neither the first Muslim, nor the first Shi'te to die for his religion, he became known as \\"Shahid Awwal\\" because he was probably the first Shia scholar of such stature to have been killed in a brutal manner.When Mohammad bin Makki was 16 years old he went to study at al- Hilla in Iraq. He returned home when he was 21. He used taqiyya to establish himself as one of the religious scholars of Damascus, using Sunni law to judge Sunnis, while covertly judging the Shia using Shia law. =Second martyr= Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al'Amili (1506-1558) was a Shia scholar. He was born in 911 AH. in Jabal Amel.His Magnum opus is the first commentary of The Damascene Glitter by Shahid Awwal called The Beautiful Garden in Interpreting the Damscene Glitter (Arabic: ar-Rawda-l-Bahiyah fi Sharh allam'a-d-Dimashqiya ÿßŸÑÿ±Ÿàÿ∂ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸáŸäŸëÿ© ŸÅŸä ÿ¥ÿ±ÿ≠ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸÖÿπÿ© ÿßŸÑÿØŸÖÿ¥ŸÇŸäŸëÿ© ). Period of Decline The appearance of Akhbari lies in this period. This school \\"crystalized\\" as a distinct movement with the writings of Muhammad Amin al-Astarabadi (d. 1627 AD) and achieved its greatest influence in the late Safavid and early post- Safavid era. However, shortly thereafter Muhammad Baqir Behbahani (d. 1792), along with other Usuli mujtahids, crushed the Akhbari movement. AkhbƒÅrƒ´ ideology is that nothing but the a·∏•adƒ´th of the Infallible can serve as authoritative evidence in Islam. AkhbƒÅrƒ´s also differ from Us≈´lƒ´s in their rejection of the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists, arguing that preachers of religion have no role in politics, clerics should advise political leaders but not govern themselves. Akhbaris believe in separation of religion and state in absence of Twelfth Imam, they say that only an infallible ruling Imam has a right to combine religion and state; and which will be accomplished only after the arrival of awaited Shia Imam. =Against akhbarism= *According to the Akhbari view, the only sources of law are the Quran and the Hadith, and any case not explicitly covered by one of these must be regarded as not having been provided for. *According to the majority Usuli view, it is legitimate to seek general principles by induction, in order to provide for cases not expressly provided for. This process is known as ijtihad, and the intellect is recognised as a source of law. It differs from the Sunni qiyas in that it does not simply extend existing laws on a test of factual resemblance: it is necessary to formulate a general principle that can be rationally supported. Contemporary periods Javadi Amoli wrote about source of revelation in Shiism: # The most important source in Shiite law is the Quran itself, which interprets itself # The other source is the tradition of the infallibles (the family of Muhammad), according to the successive tradition (Saqalain) passed down by the family of Muhammad as well as according to the Quran itself: to accept one without the other is equivalent to rejecting both of them. # A third source is theoretical wisdom where it is impossible to conceive the contrary, which proves the existence of God and the necessity of his unity, eternity, pre-existence, power, will and other exalted attributes: this cannot be denied with any verse. # Although we cannot impose science upon the Quran, we can use verified scientific, experimental, historical, artistic, logical and other evidence to interpret the subject addressed in a given passage, rather than through another verse.Tasnim (tafsir), Vol 1, Page 57 In doubtful cases the law is often derived not from substantive principles induced from existing rules, but from procedural presumptions (usul 'amaliyyah) concerning factual probability. An example is the presumption of continuity: if one knows that a given state of affairs, such as ritual purity, existed at some point in the past but one has no evidence one way or the other whether it exists now, one can presume that the situation has not changed.One can compare, in Western legal systems, the presumption of innocence and the presumption in favour of possession. Similarly, Catholic moral theology distinguishes between \\"direct principles\\" and \\"reflex principles\\", the latter being the equivalent of Murtada al-Ansari's usul 'amaliyyah. The analysis of probability forms a large part of the Shiite science of usul al-fiqh, and was developed by Muhammad Baqir Behbahani (1706-1792) and Shaykh Murtada al-Ansari (died 1864). The only primary text on Shi'ite principles of jurisprudence in English is Muhammad Baqir as-Sadr's Durus fi 'Ilm al-'Usul.This has been translated into English twice: by Roy Mottahedeh as \\"Lessons in Islamic Jurisprudence\\" (2005) and anonymously as \\"The Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence according to Shi'i Law\\" (2003) . English version U≈ü≈´l al-Fiqh, the methodology of jurisprudence, which is usually ‚Äì and inaccurately, if not incorrectly ‚Äì translated ‚Äúprinciples of jurisprudence,‚Äù is an Islamic science which is developed by Shiite scholars in two recent centuries into an unparalleled intellectual, logical system of thought and a comprehensive branch of knowledge which not only serves as the logic of jurisprudence but as an independent science dealing with some hermeneutical problems. Lack of precise English equivalents to expressions and terms of this complicated science indicates the least difficulties of preparing the first English version of Shiite u≈ü≈´l al-fiqh. \\"An Introduction to Methodology of Islamic Jurisprudence (U≈ü≈´l al-Fiqh)-A Shiite Approach\\" is the first English version of Shiite u≈ü≈´l al-fiqh. This book is written by Alireza Hodaee, Professor of Jurisprudence and the Essentials of Islamic Law, University of Tehran. Most of the complicated arguments of such profound science cannot be presented in an introductory work; they should be pursued in detailed books written by great Shiite U≈ü≈´lƒ´s.

In addition to C.K., the series stars Alan Alda, Steve Buscemi, Edie Falco and Jessica Lange. Dealing with the themes of abuse, mental illness, politics and family dynamics, the series focuses on Horace (played by C.K.), Pete (Buscemi), and Sylvia (Falco), the owners of Horace and Pete's, a run-down Brooklyn bar. The first episode was released on C.K.'s website without any prior announcements on January 30, 2016. New episodes premiered weekly until the tenth episode was released on April 2, 2016. Synopsis The series is set in a run-down bar called Horace and Pete's in Brooklyn, New York. The bar has been owned by the same family since 1916 and has been passed down through several generations, always with a Horace and a Pete in charge. The current owners are the 49-year-old Horace Wittel VIII and his 52-year-old cousin Pete. The bar is old-fashioned and tradition bound; for example, no mixed drinks are served and the only beer they sell is Budweiser on tap. Pricing is variable, depending on whether the customer is a regular or a hipster who is drinking there \\"ironically\\". For many years, the management has been watering down the drinks, justifying it to themselves by saying their alcoholic regular customers would be dead by now if they were drinking full-strength liquor. While there is an overarching narrative concerning the relationships between the members of the family and the future of the bar, there are many stand-alone scenes which take place in the bar and do not advance the main plot. Episode 1, for example, features a debate on liberalism and conservatism between a minor character and two guest actors, while episode 2 features a disastrous Tinder date between two guest actors who have no connection with any of the other characters. A feature of the series was the frequent references to highly topical current events during the barroom discussions. This was made possible by the very short time frames between the production and release of the episodes (less than a week). Other story lines appeared to take place over longer periods. Cast and characters Main cast * Horace Wittel VIII (Louis C.K.) is 49 years old and divorced. He is estranged from his son Horace Wittel IX, who refuses all contact with him, and has a frosty relationship with his daughter Alice. Formerly an accountant, he inherited the bar one year prior to the start of the series after the death of his abusive father Horace Wittel VII. He carries on the tradition of the family bar but with little enthusiasm for the role. He is prone to bouts of depression, but nevertheless is quite successful at attracting women. He has good people skills and frequently becomes the peacemaker in conflict situations. However, he also has a callous streak. * Pete Wittel (Steve Buscemi) is 52 years old and is co-owner of the bar. He was raised with Horace and Sylvia as their brother, but is their biological cousin; his biological father is Uncle Pete. As a teenager, he was handsome, athletic, and outgoing, but he was later crippled by a severe mental illness and institutionalized for several years. He is now dependent on an expensive drug called Probitol to function, and on the family bar for his livelihood. He is generally kind and concertedly respectful towards other people, especially women, but struggles with the limitations and consequences of his condition, making him sensitive to perceived criticism, especially where Horace is concerned, leading to frequent minor spats between the two. * Sylvia Wittel (Edie Falco) is in her early fifties and is Horace's older sister. She was a rebellious and unhappy teenager, and is tough and assertive as an adult. She has a son, Franklin, who is at school, and a daughter, Brenda, who is emotional and protective of her, much to her irritation. She hates the bar and all the misery associated with it, and wants to shut it down and claim her share of the inheritance to help pay for her chemotherapy, as she has just been diagnosed with cancer. Despite this, she has a good relationship with Horace, who persuades her to become involved in the bar's management. She can also be startlingly blunt when she finds cause to criticize someone, to the point of cruelty. * Leon (Steven Wright) is in his sixties and has been a regular at the bar for many years. A recovering alcoholic, he continues to visit the bar for companionship, drinking only apple juice. He speaks infrequently, is laconic and has a dry sense of humor. He is chivalrous and believes a man should never be rude to a woman regardless of the circumstances. * Kurt (Kurt Metzger), a regular at the bar, is an opinionated loudmouth in his thirties. He has a nihilistic world view, and believes it would be good idea to elect Donald Trump in order to destroy the current political system. It is unclear what he does for a living or what his source of income is. He is crude and insensitive. * Uncle Pete (Alan Alda) is about 80 years old and was the co-owner of the bar before handing over the reins to Pete after Horace VII's death. He continues to tend the bar and in effect runs it, bullying Horace and Pete and drawing his own indeterminate salary from the bar's takings. He is an acerbic, foul-mouthed bigot who insults everyone and is particularly abusive towards his family, but his rants are often a source of some entertainment to the bar's patrons. He reveals in the first episode that he is Pete's biological father (his mother is unknown). He is the only Wittel who treats Marsha as family and he sometimes shows other patrons, particularly women, a degree of warmth and respect, but is hostile towards anyone who challenges his bigoted views. Horace VIII's father Horace VII was Uncle Pete's first cousin. * Marsha (Jessica Lange) is in her sixties and was Horace Wittel VII's last sexual partner before his death. Subsequently Uncle Pete has continued to give her a share of the bar's takings and give her free drinks. She is a chronic alcoholic and has been drinking since her early teens, relying on her sex appeal to attract men to support her habit. She is loud and often very rude, speaking her mind without social filters. Recurring cast * Alice Wittel (Aidy Bryant) is Horace's daughter. She is 23 years old and is nearing the end of her law studies. Horace was absent from her life for most of her childhood, and she still bitterly resents him for causing the family to break up. Unlike her brother Horace Wittel IX, who refuses all contact, she meets with her father on several occasions, but rebuffs all his attempts to bond with her. She is emotionally cold; however, she is on friendly terms with her uncle Pete. * Tricia (Maria Dizzia) is a pleasant young woman who has Tourette syndrome, causing her to involuntarily make offensive utterances. She befriended Pete during his stay at a psychiatric hospital. When she attempts to renew their friendship Pete initially doesn't want to see her, associating her with the worst period of his life, but he relents and they eventually become romantically involved. * Nick (Nick DiPaolo) is 49 years old and is an assistant DA. He is not particularly enthusiastic about his job and sees no prospects for advancement. He is politically conservative and often argues with other bar patrons. He is a semi-regular at the bar and sometimes picks up women there for one night stands. * Tom (Tom Noonan), a regular at the bar, is a lugubrious man in his 60s who is a failed musician and actor. He sometimes plays the piano. * Melissa (Liza Treyger) * Carl (Greer Barnes) * Rhonda (Karen Pittman) * Dom (Dov Davidoff) * Mark (Mark Normand) * Ricardo (Craig muMs Grant) * Horace (Jack Gore)  Production  Conception and casting  Creator Louis C.K. made the show without making any public announcements. C.K. said that the show was inspired by Mike Leigh's 1977 play, Abigail's Party, which was written and developed using Leigh's improvisation method, and was then made into a multi- camera TV play. Abigail's Party's story takes place during the course of a night, over drinks and dinner. It is one scene over two hours. C.K. also credits playwright Annie Baker both in discussion about the show and in the credits, as he saw her play The Flick, and was influenced by her work there. She also helped him with the writing of the first few episodes. The idea was a sitcom with no audience or laugh-track, multi-camera, shot from a stage-like perspective (i.e., from one angle). The focus would be, similar to Abigail's Party, centered on a family. Steve Buscemi came on board first, then Edie Falco and Jessica Lange. C.K. said that the cast will get a portion of the profits. For the role of Pete Wittel, C.K. originally tried to cast Joe Pesci. In a conversation over the phone, Pesci declined the role, so C.K. went to his home to try to persuade him. After discussing about the script, Pesci admitted that he liked it, yet still said no. C.K. had also offered the role to Jack Nicholson and Christopher Walken, before eventually considering and signing Alan Alda. C.K.'s character's name is a homage to the late comedian Harris Wittels, who opened for C.K. and was someone C.K. considered a talented comedian of note. C.K. started writing the show in October 2015 and then as cast members came on board, he held rehearsals in January 2016. Sections of the show's scripts were kept intentionally blank with placeholders to insert current events, like the upcoming presidential election.  Filming  C.K. said that each episode cost half a million dollars to shoot. The show was shot in a studio in New York City called NEP Penn Studios, which is located in the Hotel Pennsylvania across from Madison Square Garden. They shot the show starting in early January 2016, with production lasting about five or six weeks. Using the look and feel of Abigail's Party, C.K. used a color-coded shot list that was created during rehearsals to enable live-switching between cameras. A quick line-cut would enable a fast turnaround to distribution. Also unique to this approach, the editing becomes focused on dialogue and how the moods of the characters shift. There would be no ad breaks for commercials and no standards & practices that would restrict language. Also important to C.K., and why he did not want to release the show via a television network, was that he wanted the show to be secret and unexpected, where the audience had little to no information before viewing, which he said would have been impossible with a traditional TV show model. The strategy was that C.K. would make the first four episodes and use the money people paid for those to fund the rest of the season. Due to lack of promotion, there was not enough money and he went into debt to fund the production of the show. After he finished production on the show C.K. went on a promotional tour to promote the show and recoup some of the costs. C.K. said that what he was going to be doing (i.e., producing shows of varying length, using a theater-based approach to storytelling, distributing the show himself) was going to be so extreme he did not want to have funding from other sources, like FX Networks, even though people like Lorne Michaels strongly discouraged C.K. from doing this.  Music  Paul Simon wrote the theme song and his music was used for the soundtrack. The theme song was written and performed by Paul Simon. C.K. asked Simon to write the theme song via email, let Simon read all 10 scripts, and then the two went into the studio for a day to work on the song. The song was subsequently included on the deluxe edition of Simon's 2016 album, Stranger to Stranger. Simon makes a brief appearance as a customer in a flashback scene in episode 10. \\"America\\" by Simon & Garfunkel, and Dion DiMucci and Paul Simon's \\"New York Is My Home\\" are featured in different episodes of the show.  Distribution  The first episode was released on January 30, 2016, with no press or previous mention. Subscribers to C.K.'s mailing list received an email notice of its availability. It is a continuation of the sell-through direct-to-consumer model that C.K. used successfully in prior releases of content. C.K. said he would eventually sell the show to another outlet (i.e., a cable and/or streaming service), but wanted to use this sales model as a fun experiment to innovate distribution. C.K. explained that the direct-to- consumer, sell-through model of pricing the pilot at $5 would allow him to produce following episodes. On his website, he discussed the challenges of creating, shooting, and releasing a multi-camera TV show and addressed the pricing, revealing a tiered cheaper price for the remaining episodes of the show: $5 for the first episode, $2 for the next, and the $3 for the rest of the episodes. The show has a very short production-release model, as episode 2 was being shot the week following the pilot, and was released a week after the first episode was made public, with following episodes to come. All of the ten episodes were edited by C.K.'s former Louie assistant editor Gina Sansom, and had no predetermined running time, ranging in length from 30 minutes to 67 minutes. The closing credits for episode 5 include the notice: End of Act 1. At the close of episode 10, C.K. announces \\"That's a wrap on Horace and Pete\\" while the cast applaud in a kind of curtain call. Shortly after the final episode of season one was released, C.K. revealed that guest actress Amy Sedaris, a late casting decision, had developed her own character and improvised all her dialogue. Horace and Petes production, marketing, and distribution model sparked much debate over the strategic, financial, creative options available to content creators. C.K.'s work was compared to Kanye West as both navigate funding singular artistic visions that focus on creative control and in C.K.'s case, distribution, funding, and publicity methods outside the typical television model. C.K., during an extensive discussion with fellow comic Marc Maron, said that he wanted to open source the process by which he created the show, transparently sharing as much information as possible so others might be able to adopt and learn from his experience. At The New Yorker Festival, C.K. told Emily Nussbaum that he sold the show to Hulu. Episodes Reception Critical response Critics have been generally positive towards Horace and Pete, with a consensus and praise that the show feels like a filmed stage play. It was favorably compared to Playhouse 90, with critic Matt Zoller Seitz from Vulture calling it \\"aggressively classical.\\" The show has been described as being filmed live, with a realism that reflects technical imperfections that add to subtle moments by a cast of veteran actors. James Poniewozik of The New York Times called it a \\"messy experiment that stays just on the good side of pretentiousness. But it's also probing, engaged and moving.\\" Entertainment Weekly's Ray Rahman said of the performances, \\"Alda is magnetic as he descends into sadness, while Falco injects Horace and Pete with tissue-worthy emotion. Buscemi is masterfully Buscemi-ian, and C.K. has only gotten better at making shame-filled frowny faces.\\" Alan Sepinwall from HitFix declared Laurie Metcalf's performance the \\"year's best\\". Filmmaker Stephen Cone gave significant praise to the series in terms of Louis C.K.'s hybridization of film, TV, and theater, comparing him to French film director Alain Resnais and stating: \\"Leave it to Louis C.K. to save cinema ‚Äì whatever that means ‚Äì with a goddamn web series.\\" Seitz focused on the show's unique use of silence, in part a noted homage to a quote by recently deceased Garry Shandling on how there is value and meaning to be had in silence. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes sampled 23 reviewers and judged 96% of the reviews to be positive. With a mean score of 8.7/10, the site's consensus states, \\"Horace and Pete creator Louis C.K. uses his signature blend of awkward humor ‚Äì and brilliant performances from a top-notch cast ‚Äì to pull off an engagingly ambitious experiment in TV tragicomedy.\\" On Metacritic the series has a score of 78 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Accolades On March 29, 2016, it was reported that Louis C.K. would enter the series in the drama category for the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards. Lead actors C.K. and Steve Buscemi, supporting actors Alan Alda, Steven Wright, Kurt Metzger, Jessica Lange and Edie Falco, and guest stars Laurie Metcalf and Aidy Bryant were reportedly submitted for nomination by C.K. Nominations were announced in July 2016 and the series received two nominations: Laurie Metcalf for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series and Gina Sansom for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series.

In 1595 he took part in and invested 1,000 marks in (what proved to be) the last expedition of Drake and Hawkins, which sought to capture a Spanish treasure ship, believed to be waiting at Puerto Rico. The Spanish learned of the plan and were well-prepared when the Rainbow reached Puerto Rico in November 1595. The Spanish shore batteries fired on the English fleet at anchor and a cannonball penetrated the great cabin of the Defiance, where Sir Francis Drake and his officers, including Browne, were at table. Drake's stool was knocked from under him, and although he was uninjured, Browne Sir Nicholas Clifford were mortally wounded. Browne wrote his will on board the Defiance on 19 November 1595 and commended his body to the earth or to the sea \\"whereof I am indifferent\\".

The relative isolation of steep gorges has led to high levels of endemism and biodiversity. The park is in the central Caucasus Mountains, one of 22 national parks in the Caucasus of different nationalities, covering 1.8% of the region. The park is situated in Elbrussky District and Zolsky District, in the southwestern corner of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic of Russia. Topography Prielbrusye National Park is located on the peaks and north slope of the central Caucasus Mountains, with some southern slope areas, at altitudes ranging from 1400 ‚Äì 5642 meters. The terrain includes mountain peaks and side-ridges, glaciers, lava flows, lake basins, and lower elevations, a limited system of forested river valleys. Mount Elbrus is on the western boundary of the park, on the border with the Karachay-Cherkess Republic. The headwaters of the Malka River form in the glaciers of Elbrus and through a plateau below the glacial source, flowing north and east. The Baksan River flow to the east of the mountain through the southern tier of the park. On the southern border of the park is the national border with Georgia. Approximately 155 km2., or about 15.3% of the territory of the park, is either glacier or permanent snow. Ecoregion and climate Prielbrusye is located in the Caucasus mixed forests, one of the most biologically diverse ecoregions in the world. The diversity is due to the meeting of different ecological zones, and to the altitude variation. Because of its altitude, Prielbrusye has an Arctic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification, (ET)). This is a local climate in which at least one month has an average temperature high enough to melt snow (0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F)), but no month with an average temperature in excess of 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F). Actual temperatures in Prielbrusye show extreme variation, however, due to the extreme altitude differentials. Flora and fauna Altitude zones drive the flora of the park. At the lowest elevations in the river valleys are deep coniferous forests of mostly pine. The under story at this level is a mixture of juniper, barberry, and wild rose. Where the areas are wetter, the under story includes thickets of wild raspberries, currants, and gooseberries. Above that is a thin belt of broadleaf trees and shrubs in the sub-alpine zone. Above that are alpine meadows and finally snow, rock and ice at the highest levels. The most common forest mammals are steppe wolves, European jackals, red foxes, Caucasian lynx, wild boars and Syrian brown bears. Tourism Prielbrusye is a center for mountain sports - skiing, hiking and climbing. The park also supports camping, all-terrain vehicle tours, and eco-tours. Tourism, by both residents and foreigners, is encouraged, and there are facilities within the park (there are six small settlements within the boundaries of the park.) The park is 90 km west of the city of Nalchik.

The congregation of the church is Missionary Baptist, and under the jurisdiction of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. The church, built in 1850, served both the white planter and the black enslaved populations of Madison during the Antebellum era.  History  The congregation of First Baptist was founded on November 6, 1841. On June 28, 1849, two half-acre plots were purchased in Rockingham County, North Carolina, and another plot purchased on February 13, 1851, for the use of a church. Original documents of the Church were destroyed in a fire, but it is believed the building was completed in 1850. The original building was renovated in 1955. The church, built during the Antebellum period, provided a gallery seating for slaves who attended religious services with their plantation masters, many of whom were tobacco planters. The slave gallery was removed in the 1890s. Following primitive baptist tradition, preaching was held every fourth Saturday and Sunday of the month instead of weekly. The congregation performed baptisms in the Dan River. Silver goblets, silver plates, and a silver pitcher were used for Communion services from 1891 to 1919, which were later purchased by the Ladies Missionary Society. The church was a member of Beulah Association for fifty years before joining the Pilot Mountain Association in 1891. It remained a member of that association until the Dan Valley Missionary Baptist Association was formed in 1947.

With variously described boundaries, the area was an exclusive residential district In the late 19th and early 20th centuries for many wealthy and influential people. It underwent a period of deterioration, but many of its stately old buildings have been and are being rehabilitated and preserved. History Second Church of Christ, Scientist Stimson House Founding and early days West Adams is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Los Angeles, with most of its buildings erected between 1880 and 1925, including the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library. West Adams was developed by railroad magnate Henry E. Huntington and wealthy industrialist Hulett C. Merritt of Pasadena. It was once the wealthiest district in the city, with its Victorian mansions and sturdy Craftsman bungalows home to Downtown businessmen and professors and academicians at the University of Southern California. The neighborhood was the site of the \\"fashionable\\" Marlborough School (Los Angeles), founded in the redecorated rooms of the former Marlborough Hotel on West 23rd Street by Mrs. George A. Caswell in 1890; in 1916 the school moved to a new home on West Third Street.\\"The Marlborough School for Girls\\", Los Angeles Herald, June 11, 1890, page 3\\"News Notes\\", Los Angeles Herald, February 5, 1891, page 8\\"Burglar Robs Girls' School\\", Los Angeles Herald, November 3, 1907, page 1\\"New Marlborough School\\", Los Angeles Times, February 13, 1916, page II-3Alice Hicks Burr, \\"St. James Park Enshrines Aura of Oldtime City\\", Los Angeles Times, July 26, 1942, page d-2 As early as 1906 the area was referred to as \\"exclusive\\"\\"Dry West Adams\\", Los Angeles Times, July 27, 1906, page II=5 and in 1913 as a \\"fashionable residence district\\".\\"Hotel to Be Set in Park\\", Los Angeles Times, May 25, 1913, page V-1 In 1916 the district was known for its \\"private parks and handsome homes\\", and the boulevard itself was undergoing improvements that would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Los Angeles Times predicted \\"there will be no more splendid boulevard in America.\\" Between Figueroa and Hoover streets the old paving was torn out and an asphalt surface was laid, making the street wide. In the middle was installed a series of islands that were planted with flowers, shrubs and mature palms. Many trees were set out in the \\"parkings\\", or parkways, along the street. \\"Lofty\\" electroliers, or street lamps, were installed; they were the same design as those on Lake Front Drive in Chicago.\\"Making Great Boulevard of West Adams Street\\", Los Angeles Times, August 6, 1916, page II-15 In 1909 the sidewalks of St. James Park were known as a place where nurses attending perambulators would air and care for babies of the mothers who lived nearby.\\"She Vanishes From Street\\", Los Angeles Times, May 13, 1909, page II-1 The Great Depression of the 1930s struck the neighborhood, and a West Adams District Unemployment Relief Committee was organized in February 1931. \\"Under a competent foreman[,] the men will go from house to house in the district and perform odd jobs in homes, yards and vacant lots calculated to beautify, such as cleaning, painting, repairing and painting.\\" The team would be selected \\"from the ranks of married men with families who live in the district and who are registered voters\\".

West Adams boasts the only existing Greene and Greene house left in Los Angeles. Its historic homes are frequently used as locations for movies and TV shows including CSI, Six Feet Under, The Shield, Monk, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and Of Mice and Men.

West Adams Terrace, which in 2003 became a Los Angeles historic preservation overlay zone, was platted in 1905 from what had been called the Bauer tract. This area on the north side of Adams west of Western Avenue fell under the control of a syndicate headed by William Miles, president, and Charles McKenzie, H.R. Callender, S.J. White and C.G. Andrews. Said to be \\"the last piece of available elevated land [with] a magnificent view of the valley and surrounding foothills\\", it was divided into 235 lots with building restrictions ranging from $2,500 to $3,000.\\"Bauer Tract to Be Platted\\", Los Angeles Times, July 9, 1905, page V-14 1906\\\\. \\"The growing popularity of apartment houses is causing them to encroach on grounds heretofore exclusively reserved for high-class residences\\", a Los Angeles Times reporter wrote in September 1906.

An 82-year-old Mediterranean Revival house at 3320 West Adams Boulevard, Jefferson Park, became the center of attention in 1990 and 1991 when members of the West Adams Historical Association, or WAHA, strove to protect and rehabilitate it over the equally strong (and eventually successful) desire of the predominantly black Holman United Methodist Church to tear it down as part of its plan to build a modern campus. The pastor, James M. Lawson, wrote in his church bulletin that \\"WAHA is a white organized and led organization. They are largely the sons and daughters of the generation which did not want ethnic people in this area, formed housing covenants to keep us out, burned KKK-type crosses to scare us away and then fled as we continued to buy housing to suit ourselves.\\" He later said that his language was symbolic, not literal, but that nevertheless the WAHA preservation agenda represented a subtle form of racism. Though the house, designed by architect Myron Hunt, was registered as a state historical resource, it was eventually demolished.Scott Harris, \\"Days Are Numbered for Historic Mansion That Sparked Racial Politics\\", Los Angeles Times, April 11, 1991 1992\\\\.

Most of the other half of Berkeley Square was taken by an expansion of 24th Street Elementary School.Kevin Thomas, \\"Film Gives Mansion a Last Fling\\", Los Angeles Times, April 16, 1971, page G-1 =Infrastructure= 1906\\\\. A report was made in 1906 that the West Adams district lacked water, with one resident complaining in late July that \\"the only toilet facility enjoyed by himself and family ... was supplied by the drippings from a faucet into a pitcher.\\" City water officials said that West Adams was supplied by a 30-inch main that ran down Hoover Street from the Bellevue ReservoirNow the Bellevue Recreation Center. \\"Reservoir Site to Become Park\\", Los Angeles Times, May 4, 1959, page 32 and that work was under way to remedy the situation by bringing more water from the \\"much higher\\" Ivanhoe reservoir, which was under construction in today's Silver Lake community and which would store \\"practically a billion gallons.* 1925\\\\. A landmark decision was handed down by the California Supreme Court on February 27, 1925, wherein the court decided that it was legal for cities to establish zoning that limited the kind of housing that could be erected in any given restricted area. Property developer George Lee Miller had proposed building a four-family flat at 3802 West Adams Street, but the city denied permission because it was considering adopting a comprehension zoning plan that would forbid building flats in that area. A trial court ruled in the city's favor, but an appellate court rejected that decision.Supreme Court Upholds City Zoning Ordinances\\", Los Angeles Times, February 28, 1925, page A-1 The city appealed, and the state's highest court unanimously decided that > [J]ustification for residential zoning may, in the last analysis, be rested > upon the protection of the civic and social values of the American home.

In July 1926, West Adams property owners held a mass meeting in the Glen Airy schoolhouse Now the site of Cienega Elementary School. to protest against the high cost of a storm drain project on the street and to draw up a petition against the \\"intolerable injustice,' which they presented to the City Council. It was said that Peter R. Gadd, the contractor, had increased the tab by billing $204,145 for \\"extras\\", which amounted to more than the original proposed cost of the contract.\\"Fire on 'Extras' Flares in Open\\", Los Angeles Times, July 12, 1926, page A-1 Later the city estimated the overcharge at $298,981 and refused to help Gadd to collect the money from property owners.

The city's \\"Fair Share\\" policy regarding distribution of federal anti-poverty funds came under attack in April 1990, when the Los Angeles Times published an article that began: \\"Watts and West Adams are two strikingly different neighborhoods, separated by a few miles of freeway, but in human terms by a yawning gap in family income, property values and upward mobility.\\" The article stated that West Adams, with a population of 30,500, had an average household income of $22,500 and unemployment of 18 percent and that the figures for Watts, with a population of 30,748, were $16,100 and 44 percent, yet anti-poverty funds were being distributed unequally to projects in West Adams.Jill Stewart, \\"'Fair Share' Policy on Poverty Funds Hit: Urban Blight\\", Los Angeles Times, April 24, 1990, page B-1 = Recognition = Historic West Adams was awarded the \\"Neighborhood of the Year\\" award for 2015 by the Curbed L.A. news and feature website.\\"2015 Los Angeles's Curbed Cup Neighborhood of the Year Goes to West Adams\\", CurbedLA, January 13, 2016 More than 70 sites in Historic West Adams have received recognition as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, a California Historical Landmark, or listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Several areas of Historic West Adams, namely, Harvard Heights, Lafayette Square, Pico-Union, and West Adams Terrace, were designated as Historic Preservation Overlay Zones by the city of Los Angeles, in recognition of their outstanding architectural heritage. Menlo Avenue-West Twenty-ninth Street Historic District, North University Park Historic District, Twentieth Street Historic District, Van Buren Place Historic District and St. James Park Historic District, all with houses of architectural significance, are located in this area. Population changes Architect Paul Williams Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Building The development of the West Side, Beverly Hills and Hollywood, beginning in the 1910s, siphoned away much of West Adams' upper-class white population; upper-class blacks began to move in around this time, although the district was off limits to all but the very wealthiest African-Americans. One symbol of the area's emergence as a center of black wealth at this time is the 1949 headquarters of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company, a late-period Moderne structure at Adams and Western designed by renowned black architect Paul Williams. It housed what was once one of the nation's largest black-owned insurers (currently, along with an adjacent new building, it is now a campus for a large non-profit). West Adams' transformation into an affluent black area was sped by the Supreme Court's 1948 invalidation of segregationist covenants on property ownership.Khouri, Andrew (April 30, 2014) \\"Soaring home prices spur a resurgence near USC\\" Los Angeles Times Many of the Historic West Adams neighborhoods are experiencing a renaissance of sorts with their stunning houses being restored to their previous elegance. On December 6, 1945, Superior Court Judge Thurmond Clarke dismissed the suit of eight white property owners who tried to force fifty African-American occupants (250 residents) from an area bounded by La Salle Avenue, Washington Boulevard, Western Avenue and Adams Boulevard, contending that the defendants had violated property restrictions against blacks agreed on by white property owners eight years previously. The defendants, who included actress Hattie McDaniels and singer Ethel Waters, replied that the original subdivision restrictions had expired and that more than half of the area was then owned by black people. Clark decided that no testimony would be taken in the case, and he wrote that \\"it is time that members of the Negro race are accorded, without reservations and evasions, the full rights guaranteed to them\\" under the Federal Constitution.\\"Negro Owners Win Contest on Occupancy\\", Los Angeles Times, December 7, 1946, page A-1\\"California: Victory on Sugar Hill\\", Time, December 17, 1945 In 1985 the neighborhoods were becoming changed by a \\"wave of younger couples and families\\",Peter Y.

Today, a Group of Pragmatic Young Homeowners Is Restoring Its Glory\\", Los Angeles Times, December 21, 1986, page 30 In that year, though, tensions erupted between some of the newcomers and the older, more settled black residents. It got so bad that a petition was presented against plans by the West Adams Heritage Association to close off 20th Street for its annual Historic Homes and Street Faire, which drew upwards of a thousand visitors to the neighborhood. After a heated public hearing, the city's Board of Public Works denied a permit for the festivity.\\"The 'Battle' of West Adams: White Restorationists Buying Homes in Largely Black L.A.

The stench even drifted into Culver City, where windows had to be shut in schoolhouses because of the nuisance. Four teenagers were among those severely burned while crossing the bog. Civil suits for damages were brought against the land owners and, after some weeks of discussion, the City Council allocated funds for city firemen to quench the nuisance, hoping to recoup the cost later.\\"Odor From Peat Fire Rouses Ire\\", Los Angeles Times, July 19, 1927, page A-9\\"Peace Near in Peat-Bed Fire Strife\\", Los Angeles Times, August 18, 1927, page A-20\\"Peat Fire Warrants Out\\", Los Angeles Times, August 27, 1927, page A-5\\"Ex-Member Scores City Councilmen\\", Los Angeles Times, October 26, 1927, page A-15\\"Peat Fire Battle Nears\\", Los Angeles Times, October 10, 1927, page A-1\\"Peat Fund Approved by Mayor\\", Los Angeles Times, November 9, 1927, page A-5 In the meantime, the city filed charges of maintaining a public nuisance against three men affiliated with the Baldwin estate or with the care of the property.

In 1983-86 authorities heavily cracked down on open drug sales on West Adams Boulevard, for example revoking the business licenses of a motel and a liquor store, which was \\"virtually an open market for drug sales\\", according to City Attorney James K. Hahn.\\"State Revokes License of Adams Blvd. Liquor Store\\", Los Angeles Sentinel, March 27, 1986, page A-12 In 1986 some of the 850 pay telephones in the West Adams area were removed because they were being used by drug dealers.Don Rosen, \\"A Call to Action: West Adams Wants Outdoor Pay Phones Removed in War on Drugs\\", Los Angeles Times, May 12, 1986, page 1 In 2011, it was reported that gangs had switched from selling drugs to offering women as prostitutes. A city crackdown along Western Boulevard forced a motel to stop renting rooms by the hour, but the street, as Los Angeles Times columnist Sandy Banks reported, had long been \\"a hub for prostitution, a money-making spot for locals and a standard stop on the circuit for statewide trafficking rings\\".Sandy Banks, \\"West Adams Neighbors Fight for Their Streets\\", Los Angeles Times, July 26, 2011 The areas crime and gang activity rate has decreased heavily due to heavy gentrification and redevelopment through the region. =1965-present. Oil drilling and extraction= After hearing a report in December 1965 that there was a \\"good possibility\\" of commercial oil production from fields in West Adams, the Los Angeles City Council approved seven oil-extraction districts totaling 388 acres, six of them owned by Richfield Oil Company and the seventh by Standard Oil of California. All were to drill from the same site, a church property at 23rd Street and St. James Place. Boundaries were generally 21st and 22nd streets, Grand Avenue, 29th and 29th streets and Vermont Avenue.\\"West Adams Oil Drilling Districts Set\\", Los Angeles Times, December 10, 1965, page B-11 Allen Company took over the site in 2009 and increased production; neighbors complained about a foul stench, headaches and nosebleeds. Even federal officials got sick in visiting the site, and the company suspended operations at the request of U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer. It did however, stand ready in October 2015 to resume pumping as soon as the city could adopt new regulations for it to follow.Emily Alpert Reyes, \\"City Sets Oil Drilling Rules But Doesn't Enforce Them\\", Los Angeles Times, October 14, 2015, page A-1 Martin Ludlow In April 2004 City Council member Martin Ludlow asked city officials to investigate complaints from neighbors of an oil-pumping operation in the 2100 block of West Adams Boulevard. Residents said the noise from machinery and the smell of oil was \\"irritating and disruptive\\". The site was owned by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which received reported $300,000 a year in royalties.Bob Pool, \\"Los Angeles: City to Look Into Noise, Fumes\\", Los Angeles Times, April 18, 2004, page B-2 In November 2014 another oil company, Freeport-McMoRan was operating wells at Jefferson Boulevard and Budlong Avenue and was seeking city permission to drill one new well and redrill two old ones. Neighborhood residents protested at a zoning commissioner's hearing, saying there was noise and stench,Miriam Hernandez, \\"Public Weighs In on West Adams Oil-Drilling Site\\", Eyewitness News ABC7 with some three hundred underground pipelines spreading out from that one location, called the Las Cienegas Field. In January 2014 some three hundred residents protested drilling by the same company at another location, the Murphy drill site at 2126 West Adams Boulevard.Sahra Sulaiman, \\"West Adams Neighbors Come Together to Oppose the Drillers Next Door\\", Streetsblog LA, January 14, 2014 In August 2015 neighbors opposed a plan by Freeport to install an enclosed burner to dispose of unused gas that is extracted from the earth.Emily Alpert Reyes, \\"Plan to Burn Gas at Oil Drilling Site Resisted\\", Los Angeles Times, August 17, 2015, page B-3 =1992. Rodney King riots= Historic West Adams was not spared from the rioting that enveloped parts of Los Angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of white police officers who had been videotaped beating an African-American motorist, Rodney King, in the San Fernando Valley. Stores were looted. Flames consumed three apartment buildings on West Adams Boulevard as well as an A.N. Abells Auction building. A supermarket and a Newberry's department store at the corner of Western Avenue and Venice Boulevard were looted and heavily damaged.\\"Days of Devastation in the City\\", Los Angeles Times, May 4, 1992, page WB-2 There were Golden Bird fried-chicken restaurants ‚Äì the original on West Adams and one in the Midtown Shopping Center ‚Äì were destroyed.A.S.

Northridge earthquake= Bounded by Adams and Rimpau boulevards, Palm Grove Avenue and Hickory Street, a four-block section of Historic West Adams was severely damaged by the Northridge earthquake of January 17, 1994. It was one of the few places outside the San Fernando Valley that city authorities designated as a \\"ghost town\\" in wake of the massive temblor and the only one composed primarily of single-family homes. Eight months after the quake, 53 West Adams buildings were still vacant.Lucille Renwick, \\"Battered, Nearly Abandoned, a Neighborhood in West Adams Struggles to Piece Itself Together Eight Months After the Earthquake\\", Los Angeles Times, October 2, 1994, page 14 Geography Boundaries Although there are no official boundaries for Historic West Adams, it is marked by signs on the Interstate 10 Freeway that inform the motorist \\"Historic West Adams Next Six Exits\\".John Patterson, \\"A Resident Expert's Guide to West Adams, Los Angeles's Neighborhood of the Year\\", January 12, 2016 =Automobile Club= The Automobile Club of Southern California delineates no boundaries for the area, but centers it south of the Rosa Parks Freeway on the West Adams Alternative School, which lies between Seventh and Fourth avenues (west and east) and Adams Boulevard and 25th Street (north and south).Map, \\"Los Angeles Central & Western Area\\", Automobile Club of Southern California, 2002‚Äì2013 =Mapping L.A.= Mapping L.A. project leader Doug Smith of the Los Angeles Times reported that, in response by the public to advance posting of the proposed maps, \\"Among the bitter rifts we encountered were the competing claims to the name West Adams.\\"Doug Smith, \\"MappingL.A.

History Burials began in 1810 after the land was bought by the Rev. Richard Allen for Mother Bethel A.M.E. Church, located about half a mile north, to be a resting place for African-Americans. Bills of mortality and death certificates document 1,716 burials on the site before 1830. Large amounts of fill were used on the site to accommodate burials after 1842, in effect stacking graves on top of earlier graves. Estimates of the total burials range from 3,000 - 5,000. Burials ended in 1864 and the site was neglected. From 1869-1873 the lot was used for storage of wagons and other equipment by a sugar refiner and was further degraded. Bethel Church sold the property in 1889. By 1900 it had been transformed into a park, then known a Weccacoe Square. A preliminary excavation has firmly established the extent of the cemetery, found evidence of many grave shafts, and of layers of fill, and one gravestone reading \\"Amelia Brown, 1819, Aged 26 years - Whosoever live and believeth in me, though we [sic] be dead, yet shall we [sic] live.\\" Bethel Burial Ground Philly blg.jpgPark pavilion, looking west.

She was known as \\"the mother of modern dance in New Zealand\\". Early life and dance career Shona Katrine Dunlop was born in Dunedin on 12 April 1920; her father was Francis Dunlop, a Scottish-born Presbyterian minister who lectured in moral philosophy at the University of Otago, and her brother was Bonar Dunlop who became a noted sculptor. In 1935, she and her family travelled to Europe, and she enrolled to study with expressionist dancer and choreographer Gertrud Bodenwieser at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna. She studied there for two years and then joined as a principal dancer. Bodenwieser and many of her dancers were Jewish and in 1938, when the Nazis invaded Austria, the ballet was forced to leave Europe. The company toured South America then based themselves in Sydney, Australia, and toured New Zealand during the late 1940s. Dunlop continued to dance with the Bodenwieser Ballet and also taught ballet in local Sydney schools, including Abottsleigh Girls' School. Marriage and missionary work In 1948, Dunlop met Scottish Free Church minister MacDonald MacTavish in Sydney, and married him less than three weeks later at St Stephen's Presbyterian Church in central Sydney. MacTavish, a Canadian and cousin of Canadian prime minister Mackenzie King, was on his way to China to take up a position as a missionary in Yichang and Dunlop resigned her position as a dancer to go with him. The couple left Sydney in July 1948 for Beijing where they spent three months learning Mandarin and waiting for government permission to move to Manchuria. While they were in Beijing, fighting broke out between Communist and Nationalist forces and the MacTavishs evacuated to Taiwan. They were invited to work at the English Presbyterian Church Mission in Tainan; Dunlop MacTavish taught not only English, but also ballet for the local children. In 1957, her husband died while they were serving as missionaries in South Africa and she returned to Dunedin as a solo mother with three young children. Later dance career Initially, Dunlop MacTavish taught dance at Dunedin's Columba College and in 1958, she opened her own studio ‚Äì New Zealand's first modern dance studio. By 1963, she had set up a performing group, Dunedin Dance Theatre. Dunlop MacTavish's fascination with the diverse range of dance forms she had observed while living and touring abroad, combined with her own strong Christian faith, led her to explore the practice of liturgical dance - the use of dance as an expression of religious belief. During the 1960s and 1970s, she developed and delivered workshops and lectures on liturgical dance throughout the Asia-Pacific region, such as the East Asian Christian Council of Youth Conference, the Federation of Theological Colleges of South East Asia and the World Council of Churches. For many of these projects she choreographed ballet and dance performances for and with the participants and congregations. In the 1970s, Dunlop MacTavish moved to the Philippines and took a position as professor of dance at Silliman University. While there, she conducted research into the dance traditions of the indigenous people of the Philippines. She observed and documented dances performed to mark courtship and marriage, and to celebrate harvests and births and hypothesised that all indigenous dance stems from religious beliefs. Dunlop MacTavish also worked as a choreographer in New Zealand. Her first work was Pania of the Reef, for the Royal New Zealand Ballet in 1970. For this production, she sourced a MƒÅori vocalist and borrowed traditional clothing from a museum. In 1998 she choreographed the opera Outrageous Fortune. Honours and awards In the 1985 New Year Honours, Dunlop MacTavish was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to the arts. In 2001, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature degree by the University of Otago. In 2017, she was made an honorary member of Dance Aotearoa New Zealand. Later life, death, and legacy Dunlop MacTavish suffered serious injury in a crash in 2012 and stopped driving after that. She died in Dunedin on 18 June 2019 at the age of 99, and her funeral at Knox Church, Dunedin included dancers escorting her casket and improvised dance by members of the congregation. She was survived by her companion Louise and three children. Her son, Dugald MacTavish, a geohydrologist, was awarded the Queen's Service Medal, for services to conservation and the environment, in the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours. Her daughter, Terry MacTavish, was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to theatre and education, in the 2019 New Year Honours. Dunlop MacTavish's granddaughter, Jinty MacTavish, was elected to the Dunedin City Council in 2010 as a 25-year- old, the second-youngest person ever elected as a Dunedin councillor.

It is written for a mixed choir, with solo parts for soprano, mezzo- soprano, tenor, a spoken-word narrator, and orchestra. The work takes about 40 minutes to perform and has sixteen different movements.  History  Smith began work on the composition in November 1975 and spent about four years working on it. Parts of Scenes were performed in 1979 by the Harry Savage Chorale and with Moore accompanying the choir by piano. Orchestration was done by Donald Rauscher, and the work on Scenes was completed by 1980. The score was published by Carl Fischer Publishing Company, who nominated it for a Pulitzer Prize in 1981. The official premiere of the work was complicated by scheduling difficulties, so Scenes was performed first in New Jersey in December 1981. It was later performed at Carnegie Hall on January 15, 1982 and \\"officially\\" premiered by the Richmond Symphony Orchestra on April 19, 1982.  Story and composition  Moore's oratorio is meant to \\"comment on the private life of King,\\" starting as far back as his childhood. The work is divided into four sections, each covering four different stages in King's life. The work starts out with the narrator's prologue and then segues into a contemporary-sounding movement which includes African-American rhythmic motives. In a similar way, the narrator \\"prepares\\" the listener for the next movements. The second section includes the first songs that Moore wrote and uses text from the Song of Solomon. The third section uses text from the gospel of Luke and then follows the \\"most memorable movements of the entire work,\\" I Never Felt Such Love in My Soul Before. The final movement includes a lament and a climatic work, They Tell Me Martin Is Dead, which eventually ends with \\"frenzied screams and moans.\\" The final song is a chorale, Tell All My Father's People, based on the spiritual, \\"Angels Waiting at the Door.\\" Moore had stated that she chose to write Scenes \\"as a way to make tangible my feelings about Dr. King.\\" She also felt that everyone could feel a sense of \\"kinship\\" with King. She also stated that she did not want to strive for a \\"consistency of style,\\" but instead wanted the music to reflect his life at the time.  Critical response  Scenes received a good response from the public. Will Crutchfield of The New York Times felt that the score sounded like \\"background music for a documentary film,\\" however, the finale was \\"suitably stirring.\\" Bernard Holland, also of The New York Times, felt that Scenes could be compared to Krzysztof Penderecki's St. Luke Passion. John Rockwell called Scenes \\"conservative.\\" See also * Civil rights movement in popular culture  References   External links  * Scenes from the Life of a Martyr (Recorded 2004 in concert) Category:Cultural depictions of Martin Luther King Jr. Category:Oratorios Category:1981 compositions ","title":"Scenes from the Life of a Martyr"},{"id":"49272424","text":"Hello Gorgeous (11 March 1977 - after 1999) was an American-bred, British- trained thoroughbred racehorse and sire. From the second crop of foals sired by Mr. Prospector, he was exported to Europe where he was one of the leading colts of his generation in 1979 and 1980. As a two-year-old he won three of his four races including the Royal Lodge Stakes and the William Hill Futurity. In the following year he defeated a strong field to win the Dante Stakes, failed to stay in The Derby and finished second in the Eclipse Stakes. He was retired with a record of four wins and three second places from nine starts. He stood as a breeding stallion in Europe and South America but had very little success as a sire of winners. Background Hello Gorgeous was a chestnut horse with a no white markings bred in Florida by Paul Denes. He from the second crop of foals sired by the outstanding American stallion Mr. Prospector and was among the first of his sire's progeny to make an impact in Europe. Hello Gorgeous's dam Bonny Jet was an unremarkable racehorse who won three minor races, and was a descendant of the British-bred broodmare California. When offered for sale at Saratoga as a yearling, Hello Gorgeous failed to reach his reserve price but was bought privately by the French art dealer Daniel Wildenstein. The colt was sent to race in Europe where he entered training with Henry Cecil in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was usually ridden by the veteran English jockey Joe Mercer. Hello Gorgeous, who reportedly bore a striking resemblance to his grandsire Raise a Native was named after a quotation from the film Funny Girl. Racing career 1979: two-year-old season Hello Gorgeous began his racing career in the Ballymore Maiden Stakes over six furlongs at York Racecourse in June and won by one and a half lengths from Millingdale Lillie, a filly who went on to finish second in both the Cheveley Park Stakes and the Irish 1000 Guineas. After a break of three months, the colt returned to action in the Denis Bushby Stakes over seven furlongs at Great Yarmouth Racecourse in September, and finished second, beaten half a length by the Bruce Hobbs-trained filly Vielle. The winner later won the Nassau Stakes and finished runner-up in the Oaks Stakes and the Yorkshire Oaks. Later in September, Hello Gorgeous was moved up in class and distance to contest the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes over one mile at Ascot Racecourse and started the 5/4 favourite. After the late withdrawal of two fancied runners his three opponents were Rontino (winner of the Acomb Stakes), Star Way and Prince Spruce. Despite the small field, the favourite found himself boxed in against the inside rail in the straight before Mercer extricated him by switching to the outside a furlong from the finish. Hello Gorgeous accelerated impressively to take the lead in the closing stages and won by a length from Star Way. A month after his win at Ascot, Hello Gorgeous was moved up to Group One class for the William Hill Futurity at Doncaster Racecourse. The race was the main event in the first edition of World of Sport to be televised for ten weeks after a prolonged strike by ITV staff. As in the Royal Lodge, there were several late withdrawals including the Vincent O'Brien-trained Huguenot who had been strongly fancied for the race after winning the Beresford Stakes. Hello Gorgeous was made the 11/8 favourite in a seven-runner field with his main opposition expected to come from the French challengers Choucri (Prix Robert Papin) and In Fijar (Prix des Ch√™nes). He turned into the straight in fourth place behind Choucri but struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight and Mercer had to switch to the right in the last quarter mile, hampering In Fijar in the process. Hello Gorgeous took the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and a half lengths from Choucri with the outsider Moomba Masquerade in third. 1980: three-year-old season Hello Gorgeous began his second season in the Greenham Stakes (a trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over seven furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 19 April. In an exceptionally strong renewal of the race he finished fifth behind Final Straw, Monteverdi, Posse and Known Fact. Rather than contest the 2000 Guineas over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse the colt ran in the Heathorn Stakes over ten furlongs at the same meeting and was beaten a neck into second by the Luca Cumani-trained Royal Fountain. Two weeks after his defeat at Newmarket, Hello Gorgeous started at odds of 4/1 in a seven-runner field for the Dante Stakes (a major trial for the Derby Stakes) over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse. His opponents were Master Willie, Tyrnavos, Dukedom (White Rose Stakes), Water Mill, World Leader and Count Fernando. In a slowly-run race he appeared to be struggling half a mile from the finish but moved up to challenge for the lead approaching the final furlong. In the closing stages he got the better of a keen struggle with Master Willie to win by a neck. At Epsom Downs Racecourse in June, Hello Gorgeous was one of twenty-four colts to contest the 201st running of The Derby. He was strongly fancied for the race despite fears that the soft ground would diminish his prospects of success. After tracking the leaders, he moved up on the outside approaching the last quarter mile but tired in the closing stages to finish sixth behind Henbit. After apparently failing to stay the one and a half miles at Epsom, Hello Gorgeous was brought back in distance for the Eclipse Stakes over one and a quarter miles at Sandown Park Racecourse, in which he was matched against older horses for the first time. After being restrained towards the rear of the field he produced a strong late run to finish second, beaten three quarters of a length by the four-year-old Ela-Mana-Mou. Despite rumours that the colt would be sent to race in North America, Hello Gorgeous never raced again and was retired at the end of the season, having been bought for approximately 4.5 million by the Coolmore Stud. Assessment The official International Classification of two-year-olds for 1979, was rated the eighth-best colt, three pounds behind the top-rated Dragon. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 123, six pounds inferior to their best two-year-old Monteverdi. In their annual Racehorses of 1979 Timeform described him as \\"an attractive individual\\" who raced with \\"tremendous zest\\". In 1980 he was rated the tenth-best three-year-old colt in Europe, five pounds behind the sprinter Moorestyle. Timeform gave him a rating of 128, nine pounds inferior to Moorestyle, their Horse of the Year. In their annual Racehorses of 1980 Timeform called him a \\"thoroughly genuine\\" colt who could have achieved more if he had continued to be campaigned over his optimum distance. Stud record Hello Gorgeous stood as a breeding stallion in Europe before being exported to Brazil in 1992. He sired no horses of any major consequence in either location. His last recorded foals were born in 2000.

The film stars Rich Evans, Stoklasa, Jocelyn Ridgely, and Bauman. Produced and distributed by Red Letter Media, the film had been in production for at least seven years dating back to 2008. The film was released on Blu-ray on January 12, 2016 and on digital download on January 30, 2016. Premise Space Cop, a highly disgruntled, impulsive and destructive police officer from the future of 2058, accidentally travels back in time to 2007 after a pursuit through space causes him to travel through a time rift. He then spends eight years as a member of the Milwaukee police force. After encountering two alien criminals he comes across during a heist at a cryonic storage facility, he is teamed up with a comparatively more methodical and by-the-book police officer from the past who is accidentally unfrozen in the present. They are tasked with apprehending a criminal known as the Gold Digger known for stealing exclusively gold-based items. However, when they discover that the Gold Digger is in fact a part of a much bigger plan effected by alien lifeforms, they must defeat the evil aliens who threaten the present and the future.

Williams II as Solitaire Man Production A documentary-style video released on the Red Letter Media channel on YouTube in 2020 features extensive behind-the-scenes material and details on the building and execution of various sets and scenes. As a general rule, only one larger set could be built at any time due to the physical restrictions of the facilities available to production. Additionally, while some digital effects usually related to simple green screens were used, decidedly practical movie tricks also came into play on several occasions. For example, in one scene featuring a pot of boiling water on a stove, the boiling effect had in fact been generated by Rich Evans blowing air through tubes attached to the pot's bottom due to the stove being broken. Release The film was released straight to Blu-ray on January 12, 2016 and on digital download on January 30, 2016. Critical reception Mark Varley of Moviepilot wrote that, despite the filmmakers wanting \\"to make a film that was tongue in cheek...Space Cop was boring and unfunny\\". Felix Vasquez Jr. of Cinema Crazed wrote that the film is \\"a neat, if flawed, mash up of genres reserved for select movie fans that appreciate this kind of comedy, or have been loyal followers of the Red Letter Media team for years\\".

The SR-10 is a mid- wing monoplane of all-composite construction, with a wing swept forward at an angle of 10 degrees. The crew of two sit in a tandem cockpit. It is powered by a single turbofan, with an Ivchenko AI-25V AI25TSR (modification of AI25TL) fitted in the prototype, but more modern Russian engines, such as the NPO Saturn AL-55 are proposed for production aircraft.Butowski 2016, p. 15. The SR-10 was offered to meet a 2014 requirement for a basic trainer for the Russian Air force, but was rejected in favour of the Yakovlev Yak-152, a piston-engined trainer. Despite this setback, KB SAT continued to develop the SR-10, proposing it as an intermediate trainer between the Yak-152 and the Yak-130 advanced jet trainer and for export. The first prototype SR-10 made its maiden flight on 25 December 2015. In July 2017, KB SAT announced that it had developed an unmanned variant of the aircraft named the AR-10 Argument.

In post-Soviet times, UzDaewooAuto, SamKochAvto, GM Uzbekistan new auto producing plants were built with South Korean and American help. Now that production is more than 200 thousand per year, Uzbekistan exports automobiles to Russia and other CIS countries. GM Uzbekistan, a joint venture, with manufacturing operations in Asaka features three vehicle assembly lines and one stamping operations plant with a growing local supply base supplemented by commodities and automotive parts largely from Asia Pacific region (e.g., steel coil from Russia, advanced technology parts from South Korea, etc.). With multi-shift operations, employment is estimated around 7000 people in a region otherwise known for agricultural production. History Automobile manufacturers GM Uzbekistan Chevrolet Cobalt GM Uzbekistan is a joint venture between the Uzbek OJSC UzAvtosanoat (75%) and the American General Motors Company (25%) for the manufacturing of automobiles, and is located in Asaka, Uzbekistan The JV originally was founded in 1996 between the Uzbek government and the South Korea-based Daewoo, and was initially known as UzDaewoo Auto. Following the change of ownership of Daewoo to GM Daewoo, the facility was renamed GM Uzbekistan in 2008 to continue to produce Uz-Daewoo branded vehicles. More recently these models are now sold as Chevrolets as in other international markets. GM Uzbekistan began production on 27 November 2008. The first assembled car on this day was a Chevrolet Lacetti which also was the 1,000,000 assembled vehicle out of the production from UzAvtosanoat. The annual production of GM Uzbekistan are 250,000 units. Since the beginning of the third quarter Chevrolet is manufacturing the Chevrolet Spark M300 in Asaka. The M300 is currently intended only for export. Currently, the models are assembled CKD and SKD kits. But GM Uzbekistan plans to manufacture up to 50% of all needed parts and want to realize it soon as possible. Another plant is producing 200,000 units of front- rear- and side windows for the vehicles of the Uz-DaewooAvto and the Chevrolet Lacetti. In 2010, about 5,000 employees were employed at the GM Uzbekistan assembly plant. GM Uzbekistan sold 121,584 vehicles locally in 2011, making the country the eighth-largest market for Chevrolet and produced more than 225,000 vehicles. In 2012, the Chevrolet Cobalt was added to the production line. Following a new agreement in 2008, the joint venture GM Powertrain Uzbekistan opened an engine plant in Tashkent, from GM Uzbekistan's vehicle manufacturing facility in Asaka, in November 2011. GM owns 52% and UzAvtosanoat has a 48% stake in the Powertrain JV. The factory is GM's first engine plant in Uzbekistan. It will produce more than 225,000 Ecotec 1.2L and 1.5L engines a year for use in GM small passenger cars around the world. MAN Auto-Uzbekistan MAN truck on the stamp of Uzbekistan, 2011 The MAN AUTO-Uzbekistan Company is a joint venture between the German MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG and the Uzbek OJSC UzAvtosanoat. The joint venture was founded in August 2009. Subsequently, the employees at the plant were trained by the MAN staff to ensure a proper assembly of the vehicles and to and increase the theoretical knowledge of the workforce. The consolidation of the contractual joint venture took place on 4 September 2009 at the Oqsaroy Residence in Tashkent. Agents of the parties were on the Uzbek side the President Islam Abdug ªaniyevich Karimov and the chairman of the UzAvtosanoat Mr. Ulugbek Rozukulov. The German side was represented only by the CEO H√•kan Samuelsson. The assembly of the vehicles began on the day when the joint venture contract was signed. SamAuto provides their assembly plant in Samarkand. One of the currently assembled models is the MAN TGA which is delivered as a CKD kit from Germany. Another model is the identical truck called MAN CLA which is made by the Indian MAN Force Trucks Pvt. Ltd. This units are also delivered as a CKD kit. According to plans of MAN they want to build 500 up to 1000 units annual. For the sales of the vehicles, UzAvtosanoat had established a separate dealer network. The production capacity is expected to rise later to more than 2000 units. MAN have plans to introducing the Indian CLA model version in a modified version especially for the Central Asian market called the MAN CLE. So the target markets for the Uzbek manufactured models is the Uzbek domestic market for itself and all markets of the CIS states. Some used vehicles are exported to Uzbekistan for the strategic market support as a complete vehicle by the Neuhaus GmbH located in Selm. In addition to the TGA and the CLA series there are also the TGA TGM series and the obsolete models MAN F2000, MAN M2000 and MAN F8 available. UzAvtosanoat is the only truck manufacturer of Central Asia and plans to become a monopolistic company of the commercial vehicle sector. After the collapse of their former SamKochAvto joint venture, MAN is a promising partner for the company. H√•kan Samuelsson, the German contract agent of MAN, was involved into the MAN-bribes scandal which became known in the late 2009. There have been suggestions that the UzAvtosanoat entangled in it, or could be affected. In the first phase, the manufacturing should be adjusted to the various economic sectors such as the oil, gas and mining industry by using the local norms of the different targeted markets. Despite the global economic crisis it is seen that these sectors will achieves a dynamic growth. Also the expansion of the infrastructure will increase the demand for automobiles and other vehicles. SamKochAvto SAZ bus on the stamp of Uzbekistan, 2011 SamKochAvto, originally Samarkand Automobile Factory, is a joint Turkish‚ÄìUzbek venture with major investment by the Turkish company Koc Holding. Located in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, the plant manufactures buses and has recently launched a production line for Nissan cargo trucks. SamKochAvto produces 4 models of buses and 5 truck models, some of which are exported. Plans have been announced for production of Suzukis. \\"Samarkand automobile plant\\" for the production of medium-capacity buses and small trucks and medium-duty trucks, organized in 1996 by the decision of the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan for the number 381 from 05.11.1996, the commencement of commercial operations from March 19, 1999. The SamAuto lineup includes basic models in the small class SAZ NP 37 chassis Japanese Isuzu, low-floor bus of small class SAZ LE-60, Isuzu trucks and other special vehicles on the chassis of Isuzu. Former manufacturers Land Rover Uzbekistan UzDaewooAvto Daewoo Nexia II Daewoo Gentra UzDaewooAuto was a joint venture founded in 1992 between the Uzbek state owned UzAvtosanoat and the South Korean headquartered, American owned GM Korea. The company began production of vehicles on 19 July 1996, at the new assembly plant located in Asaka. UzDaewooAuto produced cars under Daewoo brand from 1996 to 2008. GM Uzbekistan is succeeder of UzDaewooAuto since 2008. The company produced vehicles under the brand name Uz-Daewoo and is increasingly important in the markets of the CIS area. The initiative to establish the Uzbek automobile industry goes back to the early 1990s and the administration of State President Islam Abdug ªaniyevich Karimov. Following Daewoo's collapse in 2001, and resulting change of ownership, GM Uzbekistan was eventually established in March 2008 as a new replacement joint venture, and the Nexia and Matiz were sold under the Chevrolet badge together with an extended range of GM Korea Chevrolet models produced at the Asaka factory. The joint venture is owned by Uzavtosanoat JSC (75%) and General Motors Corporation (25%). GM Uzbekistan produced 106,334 units during the first half of 2011.

The house was built in 1810 and was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 24 March 1950. The building is situated in the historic Indre by neighborhood on Vestergade across from the Church of Our Lady. The reason for the listing was partly the historical significance and importance of the building and the impact of its former inhabitants.  History  In 1810 the merchant Hartvig Philip R√©e bought a parcel of land on Vestergade 11 and constructed the building which would become known as M√∏nsted's House. R√©e established several factories on the property and gradually built up a large fleet of merchant vessels. R√©e successfully navigated the Danish state bankruptcy of the early 19th century and tax registers show he was the highest individual in 1818. R√©e eventually became the first person of Jewish descend in Denmark who was admitted to the small group of eligible citizens who could vote and hold official office. In 1865 Otto M√∏nsted settled in the city where he married the daughter of the local industry magnate Hans Broge in 1870. In 1893 M√∏nsted bought the factories on Vestergade which had been at the center of his trade and industry empire for over a decade at the time. M√∏nsted opened a margarine factory at the site which eventually became the brand \\"OMA ‚Äì Otto M√∏nsted Aarhus\\". In 1900 the factories were renovated after a fire and a neighboring property was bought up. The factory grew to be one of the largest employers in the city until 1948 when production was moved to Copenhagen. The building constructed by R√©e and facing Vestergade became known as M√∏nsted's House. R√©e, M√∏nsted and the industrial production that took place on the Vestergade property had a large impact on the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and this was factored into the decision to list the building. The building material is brick and the building is 14 joists wide with a facade divided by pilasters.

Mesomanufacturing processes are filling the gap between macro- and micromanufacturing processes and overlaps both of them. (see picture). Other manufacturing technologies are nanoscale (< 100 nm), microscale (100 nm to 100 ¬µm) and macroscale manufacturing (> 0.5 mm). Applications Application of mesomanufacturing include electronics, biotechnology, optics, medicine, avionics, communications, and other areas. Specific applications include mechanical watches, and extremely small motors and bearings; lenses for cameras and other micro parts for mobile telephones; micro-batteries, mesoscale fuel cells, microscale pumps, valves, and mixing devices for microchemical reactors; biomedical implants, microholes for fiber optics; medical devices such as stents and valves; mini nozzles for high-temperature jets; mesoscale molds; desktop- or micro-factories, and many others. Processes Manufacturing in the mesoscale can be accomplished by scaling down macroscale manufacturing processes or scaling up nanomanufacturing processes. Macroscale techniques like mill and lathe machining have been successful used to create features in the range of 25 ¬µm. Meso Machine tools (mMTs), for example a miniaturized milling machine, is an expansion of using traditional macroscale techniques to manufacture mesoscale products. With the limitation of self-excited vibration of machine tools and fatigue, microassembly and micro- and mesoscale milling are created to improve the maximum stiffness and dynamic operation of the milling process, which improves the overall performance of manufacturing. The development of mMTs has revealed many challenges that are specific to machining at the small scales. These challenges stem from the large influence of grain size at small scales and the necessity of extremely small tolerances for both the machine tools and the measuring tools. Laser machining is a traditional technique that uses nanosecond pulses of ultraviolet light to create mesoscale features like holes, fillets, etc. The removal of material during laser machining is proportional to exposure time and therefore this process can be used to create three dimensional features. A less traditional technique is to use focused ion beam sputtering (FIB) to remove material. This process involves focusing a beam of ions, like from gallium, to the work piece and this causes material to be removed. Using FIB sputtering has a relatively low rate of material removal and therefore has limited application. Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is another subtractive manufacturing process used in the mesoscale. This process requires that electricity be transferred between the tool electrode and the work piece and therefore it can only be used to manufacture materials that conduct electricity. One advantage of EDM is that it can be used on hard materials that do not work well in traditional machining processes, such as titanium.

It was founded in 2012 by Howie Liu, Andrew Ofstad, and Emmett Nicholas. Airtable is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet. The fields in an Airtable table are similar to cells in a spreadsheet, but have types such as 'checkbox', 'phone number', and 'drop-down list', and can reference file attachments like images. Users can create a database, set up column types, add records, link tables to one another, collaborate, sort records and publish views to external websites.  History  * 2012: Airtable founded. * Feb 2015: Raised $3 million from Caffeinated Capital, Freestyle Capital, Data Collective, CrunchFund. * April 2015: Airtable launches its API and embedded databases. * May 2015: Raised $7.6 million funding from Charles River Ventures and Ashton Kutcher. * July 2015: Introduced Airtable Forms to collect and organize data. * August 2015: Airtable made \\"Add to Slack\\" option available to integrate Airtable with Slack. * December 2015: Airtable redesigned its iOS app. * December 2015: Airtable introduced barcode as new field type. * March 2018: Raised $52 million in Series B funding; announced the launch of Airtable Blocks *November 2018: Raised $100 million in Series C funding. *September 2020: Raised $185 million in Series D funding.  Basic components  An example table in a restaurant Base Airtable has six basic components: # Bases: All the information needed to create a project is contained in a Base. Bases can be built from existing templates provided by Airtable. They can also be built from scratch, from a spreadsheet or from an existing Base. #Tables: A table is similar to a spreadsheet. A base is a collection of tables. # Views: Views show the result sets of data queries and can be saved for future purposes. # Fields: Each entry in a table is a field. They are not just restricted to hold text. Airtable currently offers 16 basic field types. These are: single-line texts, long text articles, file attachments, check-boxes, single select from drop-down list, multiple-selects from drop-down lists, date and time, phone numbers, email ids, URLs, numbers, currency, percentage, auto-number, formulae and barcodes. # Records: Each row of a Table is a Record. # Workspaces: A workspace is a collection of Bases in Airtable.  Key features   Linking between tables  To avoid the need to form a single large table when there is related data in multiple tables, Airtables provides an option to link records of different tables. Airtable allows linking existing tables of related records, creating a new linked table and also multiple links between existing tables.  Collaboration  Airtable allows multiple users to work simultaneously on the same Base allowing more productivity at workplace. A new collaborator is added by clicking share button found at top of Base and providing the email ID of the collaborator. The owner can set the permission level of collaborator while sharing the Base. There are three permission levels in Airtable Base, namely \\"Creator\\", \\"Edit Only\\" and \\"Read Only\\". If multiple Bases are required then a Team is formed in Airtable. An Airtable Team can hold multiple Bases and collaborators of the Team can work on all the available Bases in the Team. There are four permission levels in Team, unlike for a Base which only has three. The extra permission level in Team is Owner, who has full access to Team Base.  Publishing views  Bases can be easily shared with the public. One need not have an Airtable account to view the published Bases. These view-only Bases shared in public are called Airtable views. These views can be embedded into one's own website and allows the website users see the real-time information in Base, without needing them to have an Airtable account. One possible use-case is Airtable Form, which can be used to take a survey of a product. The feedback received from a customer can also be shown to public by sharing the Airtable View.  Airtable Forms  An example Airtable Form. Airtable introduced Forms in July 2015. Forms could be used to collect data from others like co-workers, customers or the public. A Form can be easily created from an existing Base, and the data collected by the Form is automatically organized in the Airtable Base. Airtable allows user to organize the required fields in the Form. A separate link is created for every Airtable Form. This link can be shared with others to get the required data. An Airtable Form can also be embedded in a website, to get the feedback from the website users.  Airtable integration  Airtable's API can be used to connect to other web services by which information can be exchanged between external web applications and Airtable. Using the Zapier platform, Airtable can connect to over 450 applications and websites. Changes can be set up as triggers for actions in connected applications.  Snapshot  Airtable provides a greater sophistication to backup the data than just allow the users to undo/redo. Airtable periodically snapshots the Base. When a previous version of a Base is needed, the appropriate snapshot is selected by the user from the snapshots list. In addition, the user can manually snapshot a Base at any time.  Mobile apps  Airtable introduced its version 2.0 iOS application on December 2015, allowing users to work on tables from their iPhone. Airtable for Android is also available.  API  Airtable provides an API to provide ability to users to build applications that cannot be built within the table constraints. A key, which is present at overview section, is necessary to use Airtable's API. The key should be kept secret. The API follows REST semantics, uses JSON to encode objects, and uses standard HTTP codes to signal operation outcomes. Initially, the user has to create a Base in Airtable. Then, Airtable's API can be used to create, read, update, or delete records (i.e. CRUD). As of 2016, Airtable's API does not allow users to create or modify the Base schema.  Security  It also uses 256-bit SSL/TLS encryption in data transit.

On 5 April 2016, it was announced that 650 jobs in United Kingdom and Ireland would be lost at the company. On 18 October 2016, the company paid out $1.1M to those who bet on Hillary Clinton in the presidential election in the United States, citing a certainty of Clinton's victory. Trump won. In May 2017, it acquired daily fantasy sports operator Draft. In August 2017, it was announced that Peter Jackson, CEO of Worldpay UK would succeed Breon Corcoran as CEO of Paddy Power Betfair. In March 2018, the company announced that it would be implementing an electronic self exclusion process through its in-shop app. The new system will replace the current paper based process, and will be implemented across the United Kingdom. In May 2018, Paddy Power Betfair announced its intent to acquire FanDuel, one of the two leading daily fantasy sports operators in the United States. The deal was part of an effort to bolster the company's assets in the United States, following the overturning of a federal prohibition on sports betting. As part of the acquisition, the company paid $158 million and merged its existing operations in the United States into FanDuel to form FanDuel Group. It holds a 61% controlling stake, with the option to increase is stake to 80% after three years and 100% after five. In October 2018, Paddy Power Betfair was fined ¬£2.2 million by the Gambling Commission for failing to protect customers showing signs of problem gambling, and for failing to carry out adequate anti money-laundering checks. In February 2019, the company announced the acquisition of a 51% controlling stake in adjarabet, a business operating in the Georgian gambling industry with an option to acquire the remaining 49% after three years. On 6 March 2019, Paddy Power Betfair announced that it would rebrand as Flutter Entertainment, pending shareholder approval at the company‚Äôs annual general meeting in May. Flutter was originally the name of a betting exchange acquired by Betfair in December 2001. The company argued that the changing in name was meant to reflect the growing number of consumer brands in its portfolio. On 2 October 2019, Flutter Entertainment announced that it would acquire the Canadian gambling company, The Stars Group, for US$6.95 billion, creating the world's largest online gambling company based on revenues. As per its existing minority stake in The Stars Group, Fox Corporation will have the option to acquire an 18.5% stake in FanDuel Group. Operations The new business maintains separate brands in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy. It operates across four divisions; Online, Retail, Australia and the United States. The online division comprises Paddy Power and Betfair in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Betfair also operates an online betting exchange. The retail division operates over six hundred betting shops in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In Australia, they own Sportsbet. The division in the United States includes the TVG Network, which is a horse racing television channel and pari mutuel online betting network, which is active in thirty five states. In New Jersey, the company has an online casino and a horse racing betting exchange. Both Paddy Power and Betfair are regulated in the United Kingdom by the Gambling Commission.

Soon she comes into contact with Rabbi Werner, who is the principal of the Orthodox school that his synagogue houses, Debbie's teacher, and a child molester. After his seemingly accidental tickles and touches become inappropriate, Debbie tells her father about the non-sexual touching. He then confronts Rabbi Werner; however instead of rejecting the Rabbi, the local community rallies to defend him and rejects Debbie and her family. The story is complicated with marital issues within Debbie's family, and is further complicated by the fact that Rabbi Werner never faces justice for his crimes.Matas, Carol. The Primrose Path.

The chassis was designed by Nick Chester, Martin Tolliday and Nicolas Hennel with Bob Bell overseeing the design and production of the car as chief technical officer and R√©mi Taffin leading the powertrain design. The car was built in Enstone in Oxfordshire with the engine supplied from Viry-Ch√¢tillon in France. It was driven by former McLaren driver Kevin Magnussen and 2014 GP2 Series champion Jolyon Palmer. Renault chairman Carlos Ghosn declared that they would not win in 2016, but wanted to in the future. The Renault R.S.16 was based on the previous season's Lotus E23 Hybrid car. Season summary After the mediocre results of the previous season under Lotus branding, 2016 proved to be a disaster for the team, as the car was slow and unreliable. This is partly due to the restructuring of the team, following its transition from Lotus which suffered from financial issues and poor management. In addition, the car's main weakness was its last year chassis: it suffered from aerodynamic problems plus a lack of upgrades to the car and was fitted with the inferior Renault R.E.16 power unit, compared to the Mercedes PU106B power unit in 2015. This therefore prevented the team from being competitive and ended up near the back of the grid. Renault blamed the apparently reworked of Lotus E23 Hybrid car as the root cause of the R.S.16's uncompetitive performance. However, Renault retaliated with an uncharacteristic public revelation of the engine's output of 800 bhp, which was considered to be competitive at the time. Renault's criticism soured their late purchase in December 2015 and combined with the lack of results and thus slipped back to near-bottom table in the whole 2016 season. Renault finished ninth in the Constructors' Championship, scoring just 8 points throughout the whole season - the team's worst season since 1978 when it was Renault and the 2014 season which the Enstone team was based as Lotus respectively.

The film, which is a four- cast movie, stars an ensemble of Nse Ikpe Etim, Femi Jacobs, Blossom Chukwujekwu and Bayray McNwizu. Shot in 2014, the film focuses on the life of two couples with different lifestyles living in the same apartment block and how they handle conflict when their lifestyles collide. Plot Chidi Nebo (Femi Jacobs) and Eugenia Nebo (Bayray Mcnwizu) are a 'prim and proper' couple, who live their entire life on a schedule, which is always carefully and perfectly planned out by the extremely uptight wife, Eugenia. They are however joined as neighbours by another couple who live the exact opposite of the Nebos' lives; Ajiri Shagaya (Nse Ikpe-Etim) and Lanre Shagaya (Blossom Chukwujekwu) are a spontaneous, carefree and totally disorganized couple. Apart from their apartment which looks like a garbage dump, they litter the premises, make so much noise to disturb their neighbours, drink a lot, and smoke narcotics; all of which Eugenia can't bear and she keeps urging her husband to do something about them. On a day, after returning drunk from a party, the Shagayas make out just outside the Nebos' window; Eugenia persuade Chidi into promising to talk to the other couple the next morning. Later that night, the Shagayas also get into a fight and they break the Nebos' window in the process; this leads them into concluding to go apologize the next morning. The Shagayas meet the Nebos right at the Nebos' door, as they are also on their way to go see the Shagayas. The Shagayas are invited in by Chidi and they discuss things amicably, whilst Eugenia is visibly enraged, but lets her husband to do the talking. The Shagayas leave their neighbours' home, but realize they've forgotten their keys. Lanre, trying to play the husband, orders Ajiri to go get the keys but she refuses. They later agree for Ajiri to knock on the door whilst Lanre will do the talking. They however enter the Nebos' apartment and disorganizes the room trying to search their keys; Chidi, fascinated by the couple, points out to them the keys, which have been placed on the table. As they were about to leave, Eugenia walks in to see the mess and she angrily speaks to the Shagayas, denigrating their entire existence; she rudely condemns the noise they make, the littering of premises, the smoking, and the loud/public sex. The Shagayas take their seats, realizing there's really a lot to talk about. Ajiri contemptuously asks Eugenia to please teach them how to live like civilized couples; Eugenia brings out typed papers for everyone, and starts to lecture. After she is done, Ajiri insults Eugenia, implying that she is not getting a great sexual encounter; because if she did, silence won't be an option during sex. Meanwhile, Eugenia realizes Chidi has been throwing her meals in the trash can after the Shagayas were unable to eat the sandwiches she offered them. As the Shagayas were about to leave; Ajiri teases the Nebos, telling Lanre that she'd go prepare a special delicacy for him and they'd have a great, loud sex. Eugenia gets back at them, likening the couple to animals in the zoo. Ajiri turns back and heckles the Nebos about how to have a civilized sex, teasing them about what a great sex is; Chidi, now sweaty and unsettled, orders the Shagayas out of his house, boasting that he is great in bed, but mistakenly says that his wife doesn't enjoy sex; Eugenia confesses that she has tried, but she just can't enjoy intercourse, because she was abused: vaginal mutilation. The situation gets sober. Ajiri follows Eugenia to the bathroom to discuss, while the husbands hangout in the kitchen. After the new pair of friends are done discussing, they head to the living room, where Ajiri bids the other couple goodbye, as she needs to attend to some clients on her PC. Eugenia offers her laptop, where Ajiri discovers Eugenia is the owner of a popular blog, which happens to be her favourite; She also reveals herself as the regular commenter, who posts musical beats (composed by Lanre). Eugenia spills and asks about her husband's \\"career problems\\". Lanre gets to learn that Ajiri was not in total support of his music career, but eventually realizes she's been hooking her up regardless. Ajiri, enraged, realizing Eugenia deliberately spilled the secret to get back at her, also reveals that Eugenia is dealing with alcohol addiction. Eugenia confesses to Chidi, whom all the while has been made to believe that his wife doesn't take alcohol, that she drinks vodka every morning by mixing it with a bit of coffee, right in front of Chidi. Eugenia also reveals that Ajiri cheats on Lanre whenever he is out of the house, as she makes her traditional loud moans in Lanre's absence. However, Ajiri confesses it to be a dildo, telling her husband, who now thinks he's not good enough, that she has a high libido, and she wants to avoid cheating on him. Ajiri also says that Lanre performed really badly on their first night together, but he is much better now. Lanre then confesses that Ajiri was the first girl he had sex with. They both kiss and make up. Chidi proposes they all start all over as nice neighbours, they head to the dining table, where the Nebos order a full serving from a restaurant. While they wait, they introduce themselves. Eugenia introduces herself as a stay-at-home blogger, a child who was abandoned, but picked up and raised by her aunty. Chidi introduces himself as a computer geek who owns his own IT firm. Ayiri is an events planner, while Lanre introduces himself as a \\"failed\\" music producer. The Nebos ask him to play one of his beats, and they enjoy it, with Chidi bragging about dancing better than Lanre; Lanre refers Chidi to ask from his past secondary school mates on his dancing skills. Coincidentally, he attended the same school with Eugenia and they in fact belong to the same set; however, Eugenia can't remember strategic events that happened in the school, and thinks the principal as the biology teacher. Ajiri starts teasing her once more, to say the truth. Enraged Eugenia grabs a bottle of Vodka attempting to hurt Ajiri, speaking in a pure south southern Pidgin. Chidi quickly disarms his wife, asking where the \\"tongues\\" came from, and how she could pick up a weapon so swiftly like a professional fighter (and Ajiri chips in; \\"or from the streets\\"). Eugenia now confesses everything; revealing that she rewrote her entire life. She was born in Sapele, Delta, but her Aunty brought her to Lagos. She was made fun of by her classmates from the university, who looked down on her as a village girl. She then decided to change, and be a person whom the world would adore and not ridicule. She also revealed that she pushed hard drugs into Italy and that her parents are still in Sapele; she visits them once a year. Chidi is now so exasperated, confused of who exactly his wife is. Lanre in the process of calming him down and imploring him to forgive his wife, accuses him of murder. Lanre reveals that Chidi was in a cult whilst in school, because he earlier called a mutual friend by a cult name. Chidi also accuses Lanre of the same thing; Ajiri shoving it off that she knows already, but that he didn't kill anyone. Chidi reveals that it is impossible for anyone to be in \\"Blade\\" (the cult name), without having hit jobs. Lanre eventually confesses that he was never in Blade, but only bought their protection. As the two couples are making up and forgiving each other for their misdeeds, a call comes in on Chidi's phone; Eugenia picks up the call despite Chidi's disapproval; she discovers that Chidi is having an extra- marital affair with his secretary, and they already have kids. Chidi says he got into it, because she has refused to bear him a child. Eugenia says that she's trying; Chidi says he thought so too, until he discovered that she was using contraceptives; he says he went to Ada, the secretary for comfort and a \\"good meal\\". As the Nebos were discussing this, the Shagayas bid the other couple goodnight and credits roll.

Nollywood reinvented praised its novelty and rated it 76%. Tofarati Ige of E24-7 Magazine comments: \\"contrary to fears that the movie which is made up of just four cast, and set in a single location will be boring, there is no dull moment in the over two hours‚Äô flick. The Visit is surely a film that‚Äôs worth visiting the Cinema for\\". Bola Aduwo on Nollywood Access praises the performances and screenplay, and commenting that: \\"The Visit went well beyond my expectation. These four talented actors held us spellbound from the beginning of the film till the very end and had us shrieking with laughter and shouting for more. The fact that it was set in one location did nothing to deter us. Rather, like an onion, the characters of the couples were peeled away, revealing the layers of pretense they had been putting up for each other, after so many years of marriage\\". Xplore Nollywood commended the screenplay and the performances from the four actors, concluding that \\"The Visit is definitely a must see\\", and giving it 6.5 stars out of 10.

Thomas Lumby was the father of William. As they worked together and there is some confusion as which buildings each of them designed, they have been grouped together. It seems likely that after 1784, William Lumby had taken the business over from his father. Thomas Lumby undertook work at a number of major houses in Lincolnshire including Doddington Hall and Burghley House as well as building Caenby Hall and Corporation House (now the Exchange at Boston, Lincolnshire.\\"Colvin\\" {1995), 627-28 Careers Thomas Lumby was highly recommended in 1775 by James Essex to the Bishop of Lincoln for his work, but in the same year he was declared bankrupt. In 1776-9 Thomas and William Lumby were working closely with Essex on the re-fitting of the interior of the Cathedral including woodwork and the re-positioning of the altar rails.\\"Colvin\\" (1995), 628. By 1781 Thomas Lumby appears to have moved to Stamford, where he was acting as architect and surveyor for the 9th Earl of Exeter. In 1793, William Lumby succeeded William Jepson the Clerk to fabric and surveyor of Cathedral following Jepson's death.Colvin states c1775, but this must be incorrect By this time Lumby was working closely with Edward James Willson, who provides much information about Lumby. Lumby probably trained Willson as an architect and Willson succeeded Lumby as the Clerk to the fabric of the Cathedral. Willson recounts that William Lumby was of a very ingenious turn of mind, mild and gentle. He died at Greatford near Stamford on 18 August 1804, before the age of 50, after falling into a low and nervous state of health, which almost rendered him incapable of attending to business.Presumably he had moved to his father's house and that his father may have outlived him.\\"Colvin\\" (1995), 628. William Lumby provided drawings for Richard Gough for the revision of the Lincoln section of Camden's Britannia which was published in 1806. These include a survey of Lincoln Castle with detailed drawings the West Gate and the barbican to the East Gate, which was demolished shortly afterwards. Also a plan of the grave slabs in the Cathedral before the floor was repaved and detailed drawings of the Roman aqueduct to the North East of Lincoln.The originals of these drawings are in the Bodleian Library, \\"Richard Gough\\", (1806) Camden Britannia, Vol 2, pls X, XI, XII.

Although the church has 14th- and 15th-century origins, the bulk of the existing building is 18th-century and represents a Georgian Gothic style, using a mixture of squared and coursed rubble limestone with ashlar dressings. Its square tower is approximately high and the upper two storeys of the tower were added in 1788. The alterations of 1772‚Äì1774 in the gothic style by Thomas and Henry Lumby, and the chapel on the south side of the chancel served as a mausoleum for the family of the Dukes of St Albans.Antram N (revised), Pevsner N & Harris J, (1989), The Buildings of England: Lincolnshire, Yale University Press. pg 608 *Doddington Church, near Lincoln.

Life Burstall was born in Aberdeen in 1859. Her father, Henry, had a number of jobs until a legacy in the 1870s made the family financially secure. She was educated first by a governess, then at Dr Lyon's Union Street Scottish Academy in Aberdeen. After moving to London, she attended Camden School for Girls; and then won a scholarship in 1875 the North London Collegiate School, where she became head girl. (Both the latter schools had been founded by Frances Mary Buss, whose biography Burstall would publish in 1938.) She took the University of London General Examination for Women in 1877, and won a scholarship to Girton College, Cambridge. As an assistant mistress at North London Collegiate School she attended classes at University College London (UCL), and took the Intermediate Arts exam in 1883, \\"from North London Collegiate School and Girton\\", and the BA in 1884 from UCL. She later obtained qualifications in Scripture (Hebrew Prize 1886) and Pedagogy (1894) from UCL. Manchester High School for Girls on Dover Street In 1886, one of her tutors, Donald MacAlister, wrote: \\"I had the privilege of teaching Miss Sara A. Burstall during several terms of her residence in Girton College and have a very clear remembrance of the excellent qualities she showed as a student of mathematics. She possessed an unwearying power of work, a very keen appreciation of the refinements of the subject and a high enthusiasm for its study. These qualities of industry, intelligence and enthusiasm will, I am sure, stand her in good stead should she be called, as I hope she may be, to take on the responsible position of headmistress.\\" In 1893 she travelled to the USA where she studied education and wrote her first book, The Education of Girls in the United States. In 1898 she took over as headmistress of Manchester High School for Girls. She was the second head, succeeding Elizabeth Day who had led the school since its founding in 1874.Sara Annie Burstall, Oxford Dictionary of Biography, Retrieved 30 January 2016 The building is now occupied by the University of Manchester School of Social Sciences. Burstall's introduction of streamed education was considered controversial. The girls of lower ability were steered away from academic ambition and towards newly introduced domestic subjects. Burstall defended this approach as a way to attract more pupils and give access to girls who might otherwise be denied schooling ‚Äì but it has been considered by some a step backwards from the partial educational equality that had been achieved. Nevertheless, she continued to lead the debate on girls' education. In 1903, she became one of three women members of the newly formed education committee of Manchester City Council, installing the first woman inspector of infant schools; and securing two of the four local authority university scholarships for women. Burstall made a second trip to the USA and when she returned she published Impressions of American Education in 1908. In 1909, she was elected president of the Association of Headmistresses of Public Secondary Schools (AHM), serving until 1911. Burstall resigned from the MHSG headship in 1924. In May 1925, she was the first woman to be appointed to a Colonial Advisory Committee On Education, a position she held until 1938. She had also served as a magistrate for three years after retiring from the headship. She died in Fulham, London, on 26 March 1939. Family Burstall's brother, Prof. Henry Frederic Burstall, was head of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Birmingham University. Assessment Burstall is widely regarded as a champion of both girls' education, and of the importance of teachers. \\"Parents have to realise that the teacher is an expert professional and is entitled therefore to the deference shown to the skilled professional opinion of the doctor, lawyer or architect\\", she wrote.

The book is also used as a university textbook. It covers the process of acquiring professional quality sound for motion picture productions. Author Jay Rose is an Emmy-award winning sound professional. He has won over 150 major awards including 12 Clios, and he has contributed to nearly 15,000 commercials. His work includes the MGM release Two Weeks. The book is published by Focal Press, a media and technology publishing company. Focal Press is an imprint of the academic press Taylor & Francis. The book was first published in 1999 under the title Producing Great Sound for Digital Video by Miller Freeman Books and was 375 pages. Seventeen years later, as of 2016, the book is in its fourth edition, and stands at 520 pages. It has been required reading at many film schools, including the University of Southern California (USC). The book was also awarded five out of five stars by Videomaker Magazine. When released, Millimeter Magazine noted that the book was one of very few publications extensively covering the art of capturing motion picture sound. Producing Great Sound for Film and Video has been called, \\"...the book on the subject.\\"  Overview  In the opening of the book, Rose states: > The heart of this book is the tricks, shortcuts and industry practices > developed over nearly a century, since the beginning of radio and talking > pictures. In the 40-some years I've been at this, I've worked on tracks > ranging from sales videos to theatrical features...and seen my projects win > Clios, an Emmy, and hundreds of other awards...This book is an attempt to > share as much as I can. Producing Great Sound for Film and Video is broken into four main sections, ordered to reflect real-world filming situations: *Audio Basics *Planning and Pre-Production *Production Sound *Post Production Subjects covered include analog versus digital audio, recording and using sound effects, microphone techniques, ADR, mixing, and mastering. One section highlighted as unique by Videomaker Magazine was that on \\"editing voices.\\" Rose breaks down how human speech works, and how that translates to film and video productions. Tips include stealing unvoiced sounds from other characters or people speaking in a scene, and using them to replace problematic recordings of others. The \\"editing voices\\" section also discusses sounds with \\"hard attacks\\" and training the ear to hear phonemes, which helps in isolating and correcting speech recording issues. Numerous \\"recipes\\" for dealing with common sound issues, such as reducing or eliminating echo on sets, and removing line hum and buzz from recorded audio, are also provided. Eliva Silva writing for San Antonio Express-News said of the book: > [It is] the whole theory -- and beautiful theory -- on the science of audio > and the way that audio is recorded through voltage, converted into digital > information, back to voltage into sound.  Style  Author Rose states in the book that he wishes to appeal to technical and non-technical people alike, adding he hopes to keep the book approachable and conversational in tone, dispelling the idea that audio needs to be difficult to understand. He states that audio is not \\"rocket science.\\" While the book does contain math and science, Rose points out the math is elementary school level and the physics is \\"common sense.\\" The current version of the book provides downloadable files including sample sounds and music, diagnostic tools and additional tutorials allowing the reader to practice with the principles explained. Earlier versions of the book included a CD-ROM of similar assets. In 2003, Millimeter Magazine felt the style was right for the time: > Digital artists are very much hands-on, and Rose is the right man to write > audio books for this new generation of filmmakers. Rose operates his own > boutique sound studio and bridges the analog and digital eras - he's made > the discoveries and mistakes that no one should have to learn on the job. > This direct experience with DV equipment and projects is apparent throughout > the book.  Classroom use  Major universities and film schools that have used the book as a textbook include: *University of Southern California (USC) *UCLA Extension *Long Island University *Wichita State University *Fredonia State University of New York *California State University, Northridge A 33-page instructor guide is also provided by the publisher.  Reception   Critical reviews  Covering the first edition of the book, Videomaker Magazine noted the high price tag of the book, but said: > With PBS and Turner Network Television production experience under his belt, > author Jay Rose brings a wealth of experience to Producing Great Sound for > Digital Video...the book is replete with facts and useful information. Of the second edition, Millimeter Magazine said: > Shortchanging film sound is typical of new filmmakers, and the emphasis on > picture over sound is a bias running through film schools and film > publications - articles, books, and courses on visual subjects far outnumber > those on film sound. Author Jay Rose is single-handedly addressing the > problem. John Hartney writing for Creative COW said of the second edition, > ...it offers such a wide range of usable information about hands-on digital > audio production, that by reading it, the reader is empowered with > production skills and enlightened by an appreciation of how the experience > of audio enriches video. In 2008, covering the third edition of the book, Videomaker Magazine awarded it \\"five out of five stars\\" and said: > I have been looking for this book for 20 years - no exaggeration...The > chapter on Editing Voices alone is worth the price tag.  Entertainment industry reviews  Academy Award winner Randy Thom (director of Sound Design at Skywalker Sound, Oscar winner for The Right Stuff and The Incredibles) wrote praise of the author and book: > Jay Rose is one of the leaders in spreading the gospel of using sound > creatively. He presents cutting-edge ideas about the collaboration of sound > and image, and also covers the basics‚Ä¶ all in an easy to read, easy to > understand style. Academy Award nominated sound mixer Jeff Wexler (Independence Day, The Last Samurai, Fight Club) wrote a blurb for the book stating: > \\"This is the definitive book.

The film was produced by Stuart Legg.Lerner 1987, p. 1525. The film's French version title was Partout au monde.  Synopsis  During his 1941 State of the Union address, President Franklin D. Roosevelt articulated the Four Freedoms: Freedom of speech, Freedom of worship, Freedom from want and Freedom from fear that people \\"everywhere in the world\\" ought to enjoy. These freedoms have become the basis of the fight in which the Allied nations are engaged. With the fall of France in 1940, it is Great Britain and the Commonwealth nations that stand up against the Axis powers and their attack on freedoms throughout the world. A number of victories on the high seas with the defeat of the Graf Spee, in the desert and Far East have shown that Great Britain still has the reserves and military forces to fight a global war. For Great Britain to survive, the sea lanes have to be kept open, with precious cargoes of troops, war materi√©l and food being brought by merchant shipping. British naval and air forces are deployed to far off ports and stations such as Gibraltar, Malta, Singapore and Hong Kong to protect the vital sea lanes. Southern Rhodesia, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia mobilize for a war that has not yet reached their borders, but commit to proving Great Britain with supplies. Canada has also become an integral part of the fight against the Axis, building up its defences, keeping the Atlantic sea routes free for shipping and providing food for the beleaguered Great Britain. The most important contribution is in establishing the training bases needed for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan where airmen and airwomen from the Commonwealth will train. Although the United States is neutral, a pledge from President Roosevelt to turn the nation into the \\"arsenal of democracy\\" will aid Great Britain. British orders for combat aircraft placed in American factories has resulted in 85% of aircraft production being built for the Royal Air Force (RAF). American aircraft are funneled through Canada before being shipped overseas. With fear of a war to come, the United States has instituted compulsory military service with one and half million men being drafted. Armament and munitions factories also receive contracts to produce the weapons of war, with warships, tanks and aircraft constantly rolling off production lines to meet the requirements of a greatly increased military force. Cast * Franklin Delano Roosevelt * Charles Gavan Power * Jan Smuts * William S. Newton Production Typical of the NFB's Canada Carries On series of documentary short films, Everywhere in the World incorporated stock footage with narration. The film was recorded in the Associated Screen Studios, Montreal.Khouri 2007, pp. 132‚Äì133. The documentary was emblematic of producer Stuart Legg's hard-hitting propaganda films.Aitken 2013, p. 557. Unlike many of the NFB information-based or \\"newsreel\\" productions. Everywhere in the World was more of an editorial on the non-intervention policy of the United States. The incorporation of President Roosevelt's Four Freedoms Speech established the rationale for the United States becoming more involved in the Allied war effort.\\"FDR, 'The Four Freedoms,' Speech Text .\\" Voices of Democracy: The U.S. Oratory Project (voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu), January 6, 1941.

Each film was shown over a six-month period as part of the shorts or newsreel segments in approximately 800 theatres across Canada. The NFB had an arrangement with Famous Players theatres to ensure that Canadians from coast- to-coast could see them, with further distribution by Columbia Pictures.Ellis and McLane 2005, p. 122. After the six-month theatrical tour ended, individual films were made available on 16 mm to schools, libraries, churches and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two.

Located within the Shanghai Disney Resort complex, it serves as the eastern terminus of Line 11 and also a transportation hub for travel to and within the resort area. The station opened on April 26, 2016, and is known for its design, including a blue color scheme, fantasy elements, and skylight roof, and is fully accessible.  History  The station opened for \\"soft\\" passenger trial operation on April 26, 2016, two months prior to the opening of the Shanghai Disney Resort. During the trial period, due to the continuing construction around the metro station, passengers were suggested to avoid using the station. The station was ready for full passenger operation with the opening of the resort complex on June 16, 2016.  Description  Station platform Station exterior The station is located within the Shanghai Disney Resort complex, just east of the gates to Shanghai Disneyland Park and north of Wishing Star Park and overlooking the Wishing Star Lake. On the north side of the station is a bus terminal which provides bus services to areas throughout the park. The station structure itself is semi-underground, with the concourse located at street level and the platform one level below. Located at concourse level are ticket machines, fare gates, and customer service counters. There are four entrances to the station. Toilets are available on the platform level, at the west end, within the fare-paid zone. Like all stations on Line 11, Disney Resort Station is fully accessible. There are two elevators which connect the concourse level to the platform. For the extension to this station, three of Line 11's 60 trains have been decorated with Disney elements, similar to the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort Line. However, unlike its Hong Kong counterpart, the line's Disney livery is not as extensive, since the line is primarily a commuter metro line that serves other suburban districts of Shanghai, as opposed to a dedicated line servicing mostly resort guests. The station itself incorporates a blue color scheme that highlights fantasy elements, which was selected by a public poll. A skylight ceiling above the concourse level brings natural light indoors.  Service  Service is provided daily at this station from 06:00 to 22:30. During the weekday morning and evening rush hour period, all trains departing Disney Resort Station head for .

The competitions have been open to participants globally, although all competitions and judging has occurred in the United States. The 2020 competition was announced in 2019 to be planned for a much longer track, ten times as long as the 1 km track used in the first several years of the annual competition. In the event, Elon Musk confirmed in July 2020 that there would be no competition in 2020, and that they still needed to finish building the longer track. Moreover, they are exploring holding a competition for building the tunnel itself.We need to finish building a much longer vacuum tunnel for speed tests & probably have an additional competition for tunneling itself , Elon Musk, via Twitter, 1 July 2020, accessed 15 July 2020.  Overview  There were three judging phases in the 2015‚Äì2017 competition: a design competition that was held in January 2016, and two on-track competitions‚Äî27‚Äì29 January 2017, and, Competition Weekend II, 25‚Äì27 August 2017. The on-track portion of the competition is run on the SpaceX Hyperloop test track‚Äîor Hypertube‚Äîa mile-long, partial-vacuum, diameter steel tube purpose-built in Hawthorne, California, for the competition. Thirty of the 115 teams that submitted designs in January 2016 were selected to build hardware to compete on a sponsored Hyperloop test track in January 2017. There were more than 1,000 applicants at earlier stages of the competition. The first competition completed in January 2017. Delft Hyperloop from the Technical University of Delft won the first overall prize. WARR Hyperloop, from the Technical University of Munich, won top honors. In April 2017, 24 teams were selected to compete in Competition Weekend II held in August; WARR Hyperloop won top honors with a top speed in the mile-long test track. In July 2018, 18 teams competed in the main competition with top speed as the only judged criterion; two additional teams competed in the levitation sub- competition. WARR Hyperloop again won top honors in the main competition, beating its own record with a run; UCSB Hyperloop was the only team to be able to compete in the levitation sub-competition, thus automatically winning. It was announced during Competition III that Competition IV was confirmed to take place in the northern hemisphere summer of 2019.

The preliminary design called for a steel tube, operating in partial vacuum (nearly airless), utilizing pressurized vehicle \\"pods\\" to carry passengers or cargo that would ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. The alpha design included a notional route running from the Los Angeles region to the San Francisco Bay Area, paralleling the Interstate 5 corridor for most of its length, so that preliminary economic analysis might be done on the concept. Responses to the design paper release included: \\"a flash of brilliance\\" and \\"hypercool\\" to \\"nothing new here\\" to \\"hype\\", \\"another science-fiction dream,\\" and \\"completely impractical.\\" Within days of the 2013 announcement, discussions concluded that building a successful Hyperloop subscale demonstration project could reduce the political impediments while improving cost estimates; Musk suggested that he could choose to become personally involved in building a demonstration prototype of the Hyperloop concept, including funding the development effort. On 15 June 2015, SpaceX announced that they would sponsor a Hyperloop pod design competition, and would build a subscale test track near SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California, for the competitive event. The competition could be held as early as June 2016. SpaceX stated in their announcement, \\"Neither SpaceX nor Elon Musk is affiliated with any Hyperloop companies. While we are not developing a commercial Hyperloop ourselves, we are interested in helping to accelerate development of a functional Hyperloop prototype.\\" More than 700 teams had submitted preliminary applications by July. Detailed competition rules were released for the first competition in August 2015, with revisions in October. Formal Intent to Compete submissions were due 15 September 2015 with SpaceX intending to release the detailed tube and technical specification by October 2015 but became available somewhat later. A preliminary design briefing was held in November 2015, and , Final Design Packages were due on 13 January 2016. A Design Weekend was held at Texas A&M; University on 29‚Äì30 January 2016 for all invited entrants. The selected pods will compete at the SpaceX Hyperloop Test Track in January 2017. More than 120 student engineering teams were selected from the preliminary design briefing presentations in November to submit final design packages in January 2016. The designs were released to public view prior to the end of January 2016, and selected teams were invited to build hardware and compete in time trials, planned for mid-2016 at the time. thumb SpaceX announced in January 2016 that they had engaged a Los Angeles-based, Fortune-500, engineering design and construction firm AECOM, to build the Hyperloop Test Track. Triumph Group was also recognized as a major contributor to the construction efforts. At a 29‚Äì30 January 2016 meeting at Texas A&M; University, hosted by the College of Engineering, the designs from the approximately 120 worldwide teams were reviewed and judged. 30 teams were selected to go forward and build prototype Hyperloop pods for the competition later in the year. On 30 January 2016, Musk announced that, due to the level of sophistication of the pod designs as well as design issues with economical design approaches to building the test track, \\"given this level of enthusiasm, there is no question we are going to have another Hyperloop competition.\\" Further information came in August 2016: the team sign-up deadline would be 30 September 2016 to compete in the second pod competition sometime in 2017. In the event, the mid-2016 competition schedule was delayed to January 2017. TechCrunch published a photograph of the pod competition test track still under construction in September 2016. Competition teams visited the track for fit checks and vacuum/track tests during the first week of November, and a video was released. The on-track portion of the competition finally got underway on 27 January 2017.. WARR Hyperloop, from the Technical University of Munich won top honors. In April 2017, 24 teams were selected to compete in Competition Weekend II. Held in August 2017, WARR Hyperloop won top honors once again, this time with a top speed in the mile-long test track. In September 2017, SpaceX announced that they would sponsor another competition in the third quarter of 2018. As with the Competition Weekend II in 2017, only student teams may enter the competition, and the \\"competition will be judged solely on one criteria: [sic] maximum speed with successful deceleration (i.e. without crashing).\\" Unlike the two test track competitions in 2017 however, all pods must be self-propelled. SpaceX will not provide an external pusher- vehicle as they did provide to facilitate student team pod testing in both the January and August 2017 competitions. Ultra-small pods will not be allowed this time, with minimum pod length set at . There will be an additional sub- competition with up to three qualifying teams allowed to take part in a Levitation Sub-Competition that will require non-wheeled pod levitation and will be tested on an external (non-vacuum) test track. The pods will need to translate at least down the track, stop, reverse, and translate back to the original position, all while levitating the entire duration. Fastest full cycle wins the levitation sub-competition. The 2018 competition will take place 22 July 2018. , Steve Davis‚Äîwho joined SpaceX as employee no. 9 in 2003, and was then project leader for The Boring Company‚Äîhad been the operations manager for the Hyperloop Pod Competition since inception. The fourth year of competition was announced for the northern hemisphere summer of 2019, and the event was run 21 July 2019. The team from the Technical University of Munich‚Äî\\"Team TUM\\", formerly named \\"WARR Hyperloop\\"‚Äîagain achieved the highest speed on the track at . Although only slightly faster than the previous year, two other teams were able to achieve high-speed runs for the first time. A total of 21 teams competed with some 700 individuals involved from the teams. Four of the teams were able to qualify for track runs. Following the July 2019 competition, Musk announced that the 2020 competition will be run on a much longer‚Äî‚Äîtrack that will include a curve, ten times as long as the 1 km straight track used in the first several years of the annual competition.  Technical overview  Each competition has taken place on a , test track built in southern California. Test pods may not carry any human or animal, and are to be used solely to develop new technologies and subsystems for effecting higher-velocity tube transport systems. The track will facilitate pod test runs where each pod is accelerated, achieves a top measured speed that is reported in real-time, and then decelerates by braking, ostensibly before the end of the test track. There will be a crash pit after the end of the track to absorb the energy of any test pods that fail to come to a stop in the test track tube.  Test track  The SpaceX Hyperloop test track ‚Äî or Hypertube ‚Äî was designed in 2015 and was constructed in 2016, reaching its full length of one mile by October 2016. The test track itself is also a prototype, where SpaceX anticipates learning from the design, build process and evaluates how to apply automated construction techniques to future Hyperloop tracks. Cross section of the Hypertube test track used in the Hyperloop pod on-track competitions in 2017‚Äì2019 The design of the pod test track varies significantly from the Hyperloop tube design shown in the initial alpha-level Hyperloop design concept document released in 2013. The Hypertube test track is designed to enable competitors who implement a wide array of designs and build pods that will test a variety of subsystem technologies that are important to new vehicle transport systems. This will include Hyperloop- specific pods‚Äîwith air-bearing suspension and low-pressure compressor designs‚Äîas well as wheeled vehicle and magnetic levitation rail designs that will support a wide array of vehicle technologies to be tested. Some pods are expected to test only particular subsystems rather than a full Hyperloop- capable pod vehicle design; as well, many pods will have no on-pod compressor to prevent the high-speed choked-flow problem, very unlike the Hyperloop alpha design. Multiple systems were allowed for propulsion and for levitation/suspension of various team pods. Three explicit suspension types were called out in the year 1 competition rules: wheels, air bearings, and magnetic levitation. In the initial year, Pod propulsion could be On-pod‚Äîas envisioned in the alpha Hyperloop design‚Äîor for the Hypertube test track, could use a SpaceX-provided Pusher to accelerate pods up to speed in the first 15 percent of track length, or even be unique (team-specific) Off-pod propulsion systems that would need to be integrated into the Hypertube for that Pod's specific test run. In later years, the pods were required to be self-propelled. = Specifications = The test track specifications include: * Outer diameter: (vs. approximately for the tube in the initial alpha Hyperloop design document) * Inner diameter: * Wall thickness: (vs. for the tube in the initial alpha Hyperloop design) * Length: (approximate) * Materials ** Tube: ASTM A1018 Grade 36 carbon steel ** Rail: Aluminum 6061-T6 ** Subtrack: AA1370-50 Aluminum alloy for electrical applications ** Concrete base inside the tube to support wheeled-vehicle pods * Subtrack thickness: for first and last ; for remainder of tube * Internal pressure: competitors may select tube operating pressure \\"in order to support various types of propulsion systems, compressors (if applicable), and outer mold lines\\" * Pumpdown time is expected to be as long as 30 minutes to reach the minimum pressure rating. * Thermal control system: none provided in the Hypertube. Tube temperature is expected to vary based on time of day and weather, and competitors will need to design their pods accordingly, mitigating thermal hotspots during pumpdown and test runs. * Braking system: the only Hypertube- provided braking is the emergency foam pit at the end of the mile-long tube. Pods are expected to provide their own pod-specific braking system, one that will react force to the Hypertube by one of four methods: either against the steel tube, or concrete base, or aluminum subtrack, or central rail. Tube requirements limit friction braking against the subtrack or rail to specified limits. * Power: none provided on the test track during testing; 240VAC/50A and 120VAC/15A power provided in the pod waiting area up through the pre- launch phase within the tube * Communications: SpaceX will provide a standard Network Access Panel (NAP) device (approximately ) for mounting on each pod which will communicate to the in-tube network via two, redundant, 1‚Äì25 GHz, wave blade antennas. The NAP will also record temperature, acceleration, vibration and shock of each pod in real time during each test run. * Navigation aids: The tube will include a series of circumferential reflective stripes applied to the inner circumference of the tube, located on the top of the tube, to be used for optical pod navigation, and in particular, awareness of the last of the tube so pod braking may be safely effected.  Vehicle pods  Three variations of exterior design are currently being explored for vehicle pods. One pod design uses air bearings; this design relies on a system to create a bed of air for the pod to glide upon and is the basis of Elon Musk's original Hyperloop idea. Another pod design uses magnetic levitation; this design was used by the winner of the \\"Best Overall Design Award\\" MIT. The third design uses high speed wheels for speeds under 100 mph and air bearings for higher speeds. This design was used by University of Colorado, Denver's Hyperlynx team. The inside design of the pods vary by team. Some of the teams are solely building pods designed for cargo transport. Other teams designed pods to transport passengers, while other designs would allow adjustments to be made to the pod to allow both, while MIT's team's initial design did not have room for a passenger or cargo and solely relied on the engineering of the pod. The University of Colorado, Denver's team incorporated a removable capsule that allows it to be exchanged for a cargo hold or passenger space. New York University's team has created a vehicle that only allows cargo transportation.

Top Design Concept Award: Makers UPV Team (see above); Design Concept Innovation Award: Nova Hyperloop Team, University of Cairo; Design Concept Innovation Award: Auburn University Hyperloop Team (see above). = Phase 2: Test track runs (January 2017) = Phase 2 of the competition ran 27‚Äì29 January 2017 after previously being planned for as early as August 2016. 27 teams competed in two overall categories and five subcategories. Each pod in the competition needed to progress through ten sequential tests, only the last of which would be a vacuum-environment speed run in the mile-long Hypertube. Problems with dust and misalignment of the track limited performance and caused widespread problems. Just three of the competition pods successfully completed the nine tests that enabled them to make a vacuumized tube run on 29 January. The winning teams were: ;Overall * Fastest Pod Award: WARR Hyperloop (Technical University of Munich) * Overall Score: Delft Hyperloop (Delft University of Technology) ;Subcategory awards * Best Performance in Flight: WARR Hyperloop (Technical University of Munich) * Best Performance in Operations: UMDloop (University of Maryland, College Park) * Design and Construction: Delft Hyperloop (Delft University of Technology) * Pod Innovation Award: Badgerloop (University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison) and rLoop (Reddit) * Safety and Reliability: MIT Hyperloop (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)  Competition II (August 2017)  The SpaceX \\"Hyperloop Pod Competition II\\" was held on 25‚Äì27 August 2017. The rules for Competition II were released in August 2016. Unlike Competition I ‚Äî where multiple judging criteria were used and multiple classes of vehicles and vehicle subsystems were judged ‚Äî Competition II was judged by a single criterion: \\"maximum speed with successful deceleration (i.e. without crashing).\\" While approximately 24 teams competed, only the top three were selected to make test runs on SpaceX's HyperTube, a 1.25-kilometer track located at the company's headquarters in Hawthorne, California.WARR Hyperloop won the competition with a test run clocked at . Paradigm won second with a top speed of . Swissloop placed third with a top speed of . As of April 2017, 24 teams had been qualified to participate in the August 2017 competition. It is unclear how many teams actually participated. For the 2017 competition, a Bloomberg journalist reported that entrants were required to hand over rights for SpaceX to use any of their technology in the future without compensation, but no requirement to this effect is found in the competition rules.  Competition III (July 2018)  The rules for Competition III were released in September 2017. One substantial change from Competition II was that \\"All Pods must be self- propelled. SpaceX [would] not provide an external Pusher\\" as they had on offer for teams during the first two pod competitions. = Testing week = The competition began with the testing week prior to competition weekend where teams were required to pass a series of comprehensive safety tests in order to eligible for a run in the vacuum tube. Several teams encountered difficulties during the week, including fried circuit boards and overheated batteries. However, six teams passed the final \\"open-air run\\" and were eligible for the final competition. Three teams (Delft Hyperloop, WARR Hyperloop, and EPFLoop) were ultimately the only final competitors. = Competition weekend = The final competition took place during the competition weekend on 22 July 2018. Each team demonstrated their respective pods while the \\"tube runs\\" took place for the final three competitors. Netherlands' Delft Hyperloop was first to make an attempt with a top speed of 142 km/h (88 mph) before stalling in the tube. Switzerland's EPFLoop was second, yet complications led to a top speed of only . Germany's WARR Hyperloop were the defending champions, and beat their own record with a top speed of during their run. Three awards were later given out to WARR Hyperloop for their innovation in designing and building two pods; one for the main competition and the other for the levitation sub- competition. The other two awards went to the University of Washington Hyperloop team and Ireland's √âirLoop.Hyperloop Genesis white paper  Competition IV (July 2019)  = Teams = 19 teams competed in the 2019 competition. {  Avishkar Indian Institute of Technology Madras - Badgerloop University of Wisconsin ‚Äì Madison - Delft Hyperloop Delft University of Technology - EPFLoop EPFL ‚Äì √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne - HYPED The University of Edinburgh - Hyperloop at Virginia Tech Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Hyperloop UPV Universitat Polit√®cnica de Val√®ncia - Hyperlynx University of Colorado ‚Äì Denver - HyperXite University of California ‚Äì Irvine - Midwest Hyperloop Purdue University; University of Cincinnati; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign - MIT Hyperloop II MIT ‚Äì Massachusetts Institute of Technology; University of Texas at Austin - OneLoop University of California ‚Äì Davis - Paradigm Hyperloop Northeastern University; Memorial University of Newfoundland; College of the North Atlantic - Queen's Hyperloop Design Team Queen's University - SLOLoop California Polytechnic State University ‚Äì San Luis Obispo - Swissloop ETH Zurich - TUM Hyperloop Technical University of Munich - UMD Loop University of Maryland - UNSW Hyperloop The University of New South Wales - uWinLoop & SCCLoop University of Windsor; St. Clair College - Washington Hyperloop University of Washington } = Key changes = Competition IV was quite similar to Competition III in most respects, with a few key changes being made. Notably, teams used their own communications system. SpaceX did not provide an on-pod communications system, as they had in the past. Additionally, pods were designed and tested to propel themselves within 100 feet of the far end of the tube before stopping. This change was made to eliminate the difficulties of retrieving a pod that had ended its run in the middle of the tube. = Testing week = As with previous competitions, the actual \\"competition weekend\\" was preceded by a week of comprehensive safety and function tests for each team. Teams eligible to perform a full vacuum run in the tube are selected based on the results of such tests. Four teams were selected to run at the end of testing week: TUM Hyperloop (formerly WARR Hyperloop), Delft Hyperloop, Swissloop, and EPFLoop. = Competition weekend = During the actual competition, TUM Hyperloop was once again the victor, achieving a record top speed of , beating their previous record set in Competition III by only . TUM had hoped to achieve a speed closer to , but was stopped short of this speed as the pod suffered visible damage and was forced to emergency brake. According to TUM Hyperloop's Instagram page, the cause of the damage was due to the derailment of one of their propulsion modules, \\"most likely because of a misalignment of the rail segments. With the pod consequently running too low, some of the other modules were deformed and made one of the motors hit the shell. The biggest impact occurred when one of the screws that hold the rail to the ground hit one of our brakes, ripping apart its bottom\\".

Gradante (born July 30, 1945) is an American businessman in the hedge fund industry, appearing on television and before the United States Congress in that role.http://www.pensiondaily.com/7-13-05-charles-gradante-on- bloomberg-tv-market-movers-with-monica-bertran-discussing-hedge-funds/ , Internet Archive link Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute's PensionDaily.com called Gradante \\"one of Wall Street's most sought after opinion leaders\\" for financial and economic areas. Gradante is known as one of the first hedge fund industry executives to spark a legendary debate about the risk of hedge funds growing too large rather than focusing on finding investments where they have a competitive edge; he most recently discussed the issue at a conference hosted by The Palm Beach Hedge Fund Association that was covered by Yahoo Finance and CorpGov.  Early life and education  Gradante was born on July 30, 1945 to Sebastian and Mildred Gradante in the Greenwich Village section of New York City. His father was the founder and president of the RCB Transportation Company in New York. Charles graduated from Lindenhurst Senior High School in 1963 with All County and All League honors in football. Gradante received an athletic scholarship for football and baseball at LIU-C.W. Post and played 4 years of varsity baseball. Afterwards, Gradante graduated from LIU C.W. Post where he earned a B.S. in engineering sciences in 1967 and a M.S. in management in 1970. Gradante first became employed by Grumman Aeronautical Engineering Corp. in Bethpage, NY, where he joined a group of engineers building the first lunar landing module. He would then join Pan American World Airways Space Shuttle Design Team. Business career In 1971, Gradante pivoted away from engineering and into the financial services industry by joining John Diebold Venture Capital Corporation to advise IBM Corporation on acquisitions in the computer industry. Gradante moved on to Citibank from 1976 to 1986, where he rose to the rank of vice president.http://www.hennesseegroup.com/information/info/Charles%20Gradante%20to%20Receive%20Distinguished%20Alumni%20Award%20from%20C.W.%20Post.pdf In 1986, Gradante left Citibank and became the assistant to the chairman of Drexel Burnham Lambert Ltd. in London. On October 10, 1990, Gradante became president and CEO of Union Chelsea National Bank where he remained until 1995.  Hennessee Group LLC  In 1995, Gradante became the co-director at the Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory Group which was formed by Elizabeth ‚ÄúLee‚Äù Hennessee-Gradante as a division of E. F. Hutton in 1987. In 1995, with a team of four people and $200 million in assets under advisory, Gradante negotiated the acquisition of Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory Group by Weiss, Peck & Greer. Since its start in 1987, the Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory Group provided hedge fund investment research as well as hedge fund performance indexes that have been cited by institutions, hedge fund managers and investors. Additionally, the group published the Hennessee Hedge Fund Review since 1993, which provided monthly outlooks into hedge fund performance and the markets. In 1997, Gradante and his wife, Elizabeth ‚ÄúLee‚Äù Hennessee-Gradante, took the firm private and co-founded the Hennessee Group LLC. At its peak, this hedge fund managed more than $1.6 billion in investments for clients.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-01/lee-hennessee- early-woman-to-make-hedge-fund-career-dies-at-64 In December 2012, Hennessee Group LLC sold its hedge fund division to Terrapin Asset Management. However, the group maintained ownership of the Hennessee Hedge Fund Indexes as well as other research services. In 2007, Gradante predicted the looming CDS-CDO home mortgage crisis.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHLDvYZM1i8 The group's research has been frequently quoted in The Wall Street Journal, Barron‚Äôs, The New York Times, Forbes, and The Financial Times.  Bayou Hedge Fund Fraud  In July 2005, the Bayou hedge fund fraud unraveled and was reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission. One such client, South Cherry LLC, sued the Hennessee Group alleging that the Bayou fraud could have been and should have been discovered by Hennessee's due diligence process. The lawsuit against Hennessee Group and Gradante was subsequently dismissed in July 2007 by U.S. District Court Judge Colleen McMahon who wrote: \\"that since Bayou's principals had deceived the entire investment community for over nine years, it was doubtful that Hennessee's due diligence would have uncovered the fraud\\". The dismissal was upheld on appeal in July 2009. In the aftermath of the Bernard Madoff hedge fund fraud in December 2008, the Bayou fraud was revisited by the Securities and Exchange Commission and Hennessee Group LLC and Charles Gradante settled similar charges of alleged due diligence failures. Neither Hennessee group LLC nor Gradante admitted any wrongdoing in April 2009. SandDollar Capital In 2007, Gradante and his wife co-founded SandDollar Capital LLC , a private equity firm. On July 31, 2007, SandDollar Capital LLC formed an alliance with Barbarian Films LLC. Some of the films created through this alliance include 13, Spread, The Greatest, and Powder Blue.  1998 Long- Term Capital Management Downturn  In 1998, Charles Gradante was invited by the House of Representatives to explain the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund. Gradante pointed out that after the Russian economic crisis of 1998, LTCM developed a flawed, fat-tail risk strategy. Secondly, banks and brokers lent too much capital to LTCM without properly conducting due diligence. Gradante believes that the New York Federal Reserve Bank acted swiftly and brilliantly in avoiding potential systemic risks. He points out that merger arbitrage was negatively affected by LTCM as spreads narrowed and then widened. After the LTCM downturn, Gradante lobbied for increased transparency in the hedge fund industry on national television and in front of Congress. Advisory role Gradante is one of Wall Street‚Äôs most sought after experts on matters of the stock market, the global economy, hedge fund strategy, and asset allocation. He has testified before the United States House of Representatives as a hedge fund industry expert discussing the systemic risk in the wake of long-term capital management.http://www.hennesseegroup.com/information/info/TESTIMONY%20OF%20CHARLES%20GRADANTE%20OCTOBER%201998.pdfhttp://commdocs.house.gov/committees/bank/hba51526.000/hba51526_0f.htm He also participated in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Roundtable on hedge funds and a CFTC Roundtable on CPO and Commodity Pool Industry Issues.http://www.hennesseegroup.com/information/info/Hennessee%20Group%20SEC%20Submission%20White%20Paper.pdfhttp://www.hennesseegroup.com/information/info/HENNESSEE%20SUBMISSION%20TO%20CFTC%204-6-05.pdfhttps://www.sec.gov/spotlight/hedgefunds/hedge- gradante.pdf Furthermore, the Senate Banking Committee also sought Gradante‚Äôs opinion on the issue of hedge fund regulations, the role of hedge funds in providing liquidity to markets, and potential systemic risks associated with hedge funds.http://www.hennesseegroup.com/information/info/HENNESSEE%20SUBMISSION%20TO%20BANKING%20COMMITTEE%20with%20CG%20verbal%20testimony-7-15-04.pdf Gradante was one of the few investment advisors to predict the stock market crash of 2008‚Äì2009.

Established in 1735 as a keyboard instrument manufacturer, it is still active today as a family business.  History   Beginnings  The first instrument maker in the family was Balthasar Schiedmayer (1711-1781), an organ and piano maker in Erlangen, who built his first instrument in 1735. Three of his sons also learned the art of piano making: * Johann Georg Christoph Schiedmayer (1740-1820) settled in Neustadt an der Aisch. A number of his instruments have survived. His son Johann Erhard Schiedmayer was a piano maker as well. * Adam Achatius Schiedmayer (1745-1817) was a piano maker in Erlangen. A grand piano of his has survived. * Johann David Schiedmayer (1753-1805) was active in Erlangen, and after 1797 in Nuremberg. He was one of the best-known piano makers of his time. From his workshop, a clavichord, five fortepianos and a square piano have survived  Schiedmayer & Sons  Johann Lorenz Schiedmayer In 1809, Johann David's son Johann Lorenz Schiedmayer (1786-1860), together with Carl Dieudonn√©, founded the firm of Dieudonn√© & Schiedmayer in Stuttgart. The firm soon became well known in the area. When the composer Friedrich Silcher moved to Stuttgart, he lived for two years in Schiedmayer‚Äôs home. After the death of Dieudonn√©, the workshop was renamed Schiedmayer Pianofortefabrik, and after 1845, when Adolf and Hermann Schiedmayer, the older sons of Johann Lorenz Schiedmayer, joined the firm, Schiedmayer & Sons, Pianoforte Factory. From 1821 to 1969 the factory was on what was then Neckerstrasse 14-16 and is now Konrad Adenauer Strasse in Stuttgart. This lot is occupied today by the State High School for Music and Representative Arts and by the House of History. In 1909, a major exhibit to commemorate the centenary of the firm was held in Stuttgart at the Royal Center for Industry and Trade (Today House of Commerce). Among the visitors were W√ºrttemberg‚Äôs King William II and his wife Charlotte.  J & P Schiedmayer  Johann Lorenz Schiedmayer sent his two younger sons Julius and Paul to Paris, where they studied harmonium construction, and also met Victor Mustel, who some years later invented the celesta. After returning to Stuttgart, they founded in 1853 the firm of J & P Schiedmayer, which soon started building pianos and later celestas. They also built unusual instruments, like the Schiedmayer-Scheola (a mixture of organ, harmonium and celesta) and some mechanical autoplay instruments. The firm was located near Schiedmayer & Sons. The firm later changed its name to Schiedmayer Pianoforte Factory. In 1969, the owner of Schiedmayer & Sons, Georg Schiedmayer, took over the Schiedmayer Piano Factory, previously J & P Schiedmayer, from their then owners, Max and Hans Schiedmayer. Piano production was terminated in 1980, and the firm specialized on the manufacture of celestas and glockenspiels. In 1992, upon the death of Georg Schiedmayer, his widow, Elianne Schiedmayer, inherited the firm of Schiedmayer & Sons GmbH & Co. KG as well as Schiedmayer Pianoforte Factory, previously known as J & P Schiedmayer. In 2008 the firm of Schiedmayer Pianoforte Factory was officially liquidated at the Registry of Companies.  Schiedmayer Celesta GmbH  In 1995 Elianne Schiedmayer launched Schiedmayer Celesta GmbH, (formerly Schiedmayer Celestabau GmbH), located since 2000 in Wendlingen am Neckar near Stuttgart. Worldwide, Schiedmayer celestas and keyboard Glockenspiel are used, among others, in operas and concert halls.  M√ºller‚ÄìSchiedmayer  The M√ºller-Schiedmayer factory was founded in 1874 in W√ºrzburg by the son of a daughter of Johann Lorenz Schiedmayer; he learned his trade at J & P Schiedmayer and Schiedmayer & Sons, as well as at Steinway & Sons in New York City. The business was liquidated in 1968. The last bearer of the name was Erwin M√ºller-Schiedmayer.

To stop the bridge from getting completely torn apart from an earthquake and movements through the fault line the bridge is only anchored at one end. Built in 1976, the bridge has already deteriorated to the point of needing replacement. A similarly designed replacement would also have a limited life, so its replacement is actually going to be a non-bridge. The state is filling in the gorge, leaving a large culvert for water to continue flowing, and the top of the concrete fill-in will be the base upon which the road deck will be built.

Dr. Odje was a Legal Luminary and one of the few attorneys to have shaped both the constitutional and legal systems of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. He was the lead Counsel in the case wherein the first impeachment of a sitting Governor in Nigerian legal history was successfully upheld. Dr. Odje was one of the only and foremost lawyers to have successfully persuaded the Supreme Court of Nigeria to overrule itself on a previous decision and accept his contention as the correct position of the Law.http://allafrica.com/stories/200512200470.html  Role in constitution drafting  Dr. Odje participated in the drafting of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria between 1966 and 1977 when he was a member of the Ad Hoc Constitutional Conference in Lagos, as well as in the Constituent Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.  Law career  Admitted into the Inner Temple of the English Bar on February 5, 1960, Dr. Odje went on to obtain his LLM as well as PhD in Law from the University of London in 1965. As a Prosecutor, Dr. Odje was the lead Counsel during the Hon. Begho Tribunal that probed assets of former public officers of the Midwestern region of Nigeria in 1966. Dr. Odje was also Chairman of the Odje Commission of Inquiry, Bendel State, Nigeria from 1975 to 1976 that probed assets of the former public officers of Bendel State. Both Tribunals resulted in the convictions of public officers and confiscation of assets acquired through corrupt practices. As an Attorney, Dr. Odje was President of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) from 1974 to 1976. He would later become a Fellow of the International Academy of Trial Lawyers F.I.A.T.L (USA) in December 1976. On January 12, 1978, Dr. Odje became the first Senior Advocate of Nigeria of Urhobo extraction in Delta State of Nigeria. He was subsequently elected to represent Ughelli and Isoko Local Governments in the Nigeria National Constituent Assembly in 1979. Dr. Odje‚Äôs Phd Thesis on the \\"Law of Succession in Southern Nigeria with special reference to the Midwestern Region\\" (London in 1965) remains a veritable source of academic and legal rallying point till date. In that request, Dr. Odje handled very contentious cases up to the Supreme Court on the Law of Succession under Urhobo, Itsekiri and Benin Native Laws and Customs. Some of these cases include: (i) Thompson Oke & Anor V Robinson Oke and Anor (1974) 1 ALL NLR 443 (ii) Idehen V Idehen (1991) 6 NWLR (pt 198) 382 (iii) Agidigbi V Agidigbi (1996) 6 NWLR (pt 454) 300  Landmark cases  In his cherished Legal Career Dr. Odje handled many cases that sharpened the Constitutional and Legal Systems of Nigeria. He was the lead Counsel in the case wherein the first impeachment of a sitting Governor in Nigerian Legal History, Alhaji Balarabe Musa of Kaduna State was successfully conducted and upheld by the Court (Alhaji Balarabe Musa V Auta Hamza and 6ors 1982 3NCLR 229). Dr. Odje was also included in the significant constitutional precedent that validated the elections of President Shehu Shagari by the Supreme Court of Nigeria in 1979 in the case of Chief Obafemi Awolowo V Alhaji Shehu Shagari 1979 ALL NLR 120 In the spirit of protecting the Ethnic Nationalities of Nigeria, and their natural resources, Dr. Odje successfully protected the riparian rights of fishermen from expropriation by the Federal Government of Nigeria in the case of Elf V Sillo (1994) 6 NWLR (Pt356) 258. On constitutional law, and the right of freedom of movement in Nigeria, Dr. Odje handled the locus classicus of Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs V Shugaba (1982) NCLR 915. Indeed, Dr. Odje is one of the only and foremost lawyers to successfully and instructively too, persuade the Supreme Court of Nigeria to overrule itself on its previous decision and accept his contention as the new and correct position of the Law. This legal accomplishment has been reported in the cases of Esewe V Gbe (1988) 5 NWLR (Pt 93) 134 which was overruled in Orubu V National Electoral Commission & 13 Ors (1988) 5 NWLR (Pt94) 323. Dr. Odje also handled many other landmark cases that augmented the Nigerian Legal System including the presentations of several thought-provoking lectures he delivered to both professional and non professional bodies.  National honors  In October 1982, Dr. Odje was conferred with the National Honor of Officer of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (OFR) by President Shehu Shagari. Dr. Odje was also a Fellow of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, Abuja (FIALS).

The composer described it as a vaudeville. The boys act out parts as well as sing; Britten wrote on the score: \\"The Vaudeville should be given in costume but without scenery ... The action ... should be mimed in a simple way and only a few basic properties, such as telescopes and a rope, are needed ... A drum should be used for the sound of cannon fire\\". The Golden Vanity was composed in 1966, and premiered on 3 June 1967 at the Aldeburgh Festival by the Vienna Boys' Choir (Wiener S√§ngerknaben), to whom it was dedicated. Britten's notes on the score indicate that the work came about as a result of a request from the boys of the Wiener S√§ngerknaben themselves, to perform on their tours. \\"They particularly asked that they should not have to play girls' parts\\", Britten wrote.Liner notes to Decca SET 445 (1970) and CD Box Set 475 6040, p.28 The Golden Vanity was published as his Op. 78.Liner notes to Decca CD 436 397-2. According to Graham, the Vienna Boys Choir gave a \\"riotous\\" performance at the premiere; but when they returned to England to perform it at the Royal Festival Hall some months later, they were \\"absolutely shattered and exhausted\\" after \\"one of their interminable world tours\\". Britten \\"was furious and lodged a formal complaint with the director of the choir for exploiting and exhausting the boys\\". The work was subsequently dropped from their repertoire. Britten set one of the darker versions of the song, in which the brave cabin boy is abandoned to drown. John Bridcut has summarised it thus: \\"It tells the story of a battle at sea, and a cabin-boy who ensures victory for the crew of The Golden Vanity by drilling holes in the pirate ship they are fighting, and sinking it. His captain reneges on his promised reward (the hand of his daughter), and leaves the boy to drown. But the spirit of the boy returns at the end of the piece, just as in Curlew River two years before.\\" The work includes passing literary and musical allusions to Britten's 1951 opera Billy Budd. It falls into four sections: # \\"There Was a Ship Came from the North Country\\" # \\"Then Up Spake the Cabin-boy\\" # \\"Casting His Clothes Off He Dived into the Sea\\" # \\"They Laid Him on the Deck\\" A typical performance takes about 18 minutes.

Thompson; the former was a Union soldier, while the latter served as Deputy Provost Marshal and was responsible for locating Union deserters. Union soldier Thomas L.

The rock was carved at a time when Union supporters and Southern sympathizers fought for control of southern Illinois, and as the Thompson family were among the most prominent Union supporters, it represents an attempt to physically claim the area for the North.

Kondotty Thangal Kondotty Nercha is conducted every year in memory of Kondotty Thangal alias Mohammed shah the Sufi exponent. His tomb constructed in the 18th century in Mughal style is located in Kondotty and it is known as the Kondotty Qubba. Spring Festival Kondotty Nercha is essentially a spring festival conducted in March or April every year. Once the harvest is over, the paddy fields of Kondotty are sufficiently empty and level enough to conduct a large scale local festival. A cannon is sounded to herald the beginning of the festival. History The Muslims of this area were formerly under the leadership of Ponnani Makhdoomis and the Sayed Sheik Jiffri. Mohammed Shah Thangal came to Kondotty from Mumbai in 1717. They became known as Kondotty Thangal family. A biography of the Thangal family is written by Areekkod Kunhava. The Thangal of Kondotty died in 1766. Kondotty Nercha is conducted every year at his tomb in Kondotty. There is another belief that Kondotty Nercha is conducted in memory of the Bagdad saint Abdhul Khader Jeelani. The arrival of the Goldsmith Box The Rituals of the Festival This festival is also known as Kondotty Pooram. * Three big cannons wil be shot at the paddy fields of Kondotty to herald the arrival of the festival. * A white flag is hoisted at the Thangal junction in Kondotty to announce the peaceful nature of the festival. * The first procession arriving at the Dargah is the Vellad procession from Perinthalmanna. * Various enternatainments like Kolkkali, Songs and Dance are organized in the town. * Another ritual is the cleaning of the guns of the Thangal palace. The leftover oil is believed to have medicinal values. A Hindu style lamp is also lighted during this occasion. * The different processions from various villages come to Kondotty on different days. All over the route villagers greet the procession with fireworks and festivities. * All the supporting villages join the festivities by making stalls for selling jilebis. Two kinds of jilebis are made: the white and expensive sugar jilebis and the black and cheaper jaggery jilebies Distribution of Mareedha Sweet The Mughal preparation Mareedha is distributed to the devotees at the end of the festival. Mareedha is a special sweet powder made of rice, ghee and various spices. Goldsmith Box Procession Kondotty Bus Station The culmination of the festival is the arrival of the Thattante Petti or the Goldsmith Box which is a procession of local merchants and devotees. This procession can include only neighboring villages of Kondotty. During this day, the Thangal of Kondotty comes on a horse and greets the devotees. Kondotty Nercha has a secular tone as it is celebrated jointly by the Muslim and Hindu community of Kondotty. The last procession of the Goldsmith Box is usually managed by the Hindu traders of Kondotty. Film on the Festival A small group of students from GVHS School, Kondotty has made a short film on Kondotty Nercha.

Between January 18, 1975 and March 3, 1979 he improved the indoor World record in the pole vault five times. The first time he set the record was at the Sunkist Invitational where he bettered the nearly two year old record by Steve Smith, jumping . He improved upon his own record twice the following year, the last at the L.A. Times Invitational at . Two days later, Tadeusz ≈ölusarski jumped to take Ripley's record en route to winning the Olympic gold medal outdoors later that year. ≈ölusarsk's record only lasted five days before another Polish future gold medalist W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozakiewicz improved it. A week after that, Ripley took his record back with a in New York City. His record would last almost two years before Mike Tully improved the record twice in 1978. It took Ripley a year to get the record back the final time, jumping in the US vs USSR dual meet in Ft. Worth Texas.https://www.si.com/vault/1979/06/04/823683/he- gets-up-by-being-down-on-himself-believe-it-or-not-dan-ripleys-pole-vaulting- records-reflect-his-many-injuries-but-in-reverse--when-things-look-bleakest- thats-when-hell-be-flying-high His record lasted almost another year until it was surpassed by Soviet Konstantin Volkov, who won the silver medal behind Kozakiewicz later in 1980. Ripley began pole vaulting at age 9, when his father, a civil engineer dug out a pit in his back yard. He jokingly said he took up the pole vault after falling on his head showing off to his sisters. At Loara High Schoolhttp://users.sisna.com/doughunt/loara/histlhs.htmhttps://articles.latimes.com/1998/mar/27/sports/sp-33408 he no-heighted at his championship meet. He next went to Cypress College, where he won the state community college championship. That championship won him a scholarship to California State University, San Jose, which changed its name to San Jose State University the following year. During the summer of 1974 he and his then wife would spend evenings studying the techniques from the book Mechanics of the Pole Vault by 1939 NCAA Champion from Columbia University, Dr. Richard V. Ganslen. Ripley focused and excelled in the fundamentals, particularly attacking the box (running hard to the point the pole first contacts the plant box) dreaming of becoming consistent at 16'6\\" and that one day he might be able to make 17 feet. Instead he hurt his back and had to take a few weeks off. The day he came back, he made 17 feet. Then in early September, he did it again all while practicing with short run up and soft poles. He decided to lengthen his run up and try a stiffer pole. 17'3\\" and 17'6\\" came in his first try. That year, the world leading pole vault was 17'8\\" meaning Ripley, with an official best of only 16'3\\" was suddenly world class. With the season over and no meets available, Ripley had to wait until December to compete. SJSU coach Ernie Bullard got him into a meet in Saskatoon where he proved he was ready setting a Canadian All Comers record of 17'7\\" A month later at the Sunkist Invitational, he easily won with 17'6\\" and was ready to call it a day. Bullard suggest he keep going. Ripley no heighted at the 1976 Olympic Trials, along with 15 other vaulters. Four years later he came back to finish second behind Tom Hintnaus to qualify for the Olympic Team that did not go to the Olympics due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott.https://www.usatf.org/statistics/champions/OlympicTrials/HistoryOfTheOlympicTrials.pdf He did however receive one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes. The first four places in those trials, including Ripley, Smith, Tully and Hintnaus all grew up and went to high school only a few miles off of a short strip of the 405 Freeway in Southern California. In 1984, he again no heighted at the Olympic Trials, but it was the tenth year in a row he had cleared 18 feet. Ripley's personal best was set while winning the National Championship in Knoxville in 1982 at , being Pacific Coast Club teammate Billy Olson. It was the second National Championship of his career, also winning in 1978. He nearly matched that with a 5.71 indoors 8 months later.http://www.all-athletics.com/en-us/node/290235 Even while he was an athlete, Ripley began a coaching career at the Community College level starting first at Cypress College, then Mt. San Antonio College and finally Long Beach City College.http://www.presstelegram.com/article/ZZ/20120321/NEWS/120327734 In 2012 he was honored in the Long Beach City College \\"Hall of Champions.\\"http://www.lbccvikings.com/athletics/generalnews/2012-13/hallofchampions13 World rankings Ripley was voted by the experts at Track and Field News to be ranked among the best in the USA and the world at the pole vault during his career. . { class= +Pole vault - !Year !World rank !US rank - 1975 align=\\"center\\"  5th align=\\"center\\"  2nd - 1976 align=\\"center\\"  8th align=\\"center\\"  3rd - 1977 align=\\"center\\"  9th align=\\"center\\"  3rd - 1978 align=\\"center\\"  5th align=\\"center\\"  2nd - 1979 align=\\"center\\"  8th align=\\"center\\"  2nd - 1980 align=\\"center\\"  - align=\\"center\\"  4th - 1981 align=\\"center\\"  - align=\\"center\\"  9th - 1982 align=\\"center\\"  6th align=\\"center\\"  3rd - 1983 align=\\"center\\"  - align=\\"center\\"  5th - 1984 align=\\"center\\"  - align=\\"center\\"  8th - } While not known as a pole vaulting school, between Christos Papanikolaou, Felix B√∂hni and Ripley, San Jose State had a world top ten pole vaulter for fourteen years between 1966 and 1983.

The campus is consistently ranked and admired as one of the most beautiful university campuses in the United States and around the world, particularly noted for the Golden Dome, the Basilica and its stained glass windows, the quads and the greenery, the Grotto, Touchdown Jesus, its collegiate gothic architecture, and its statues and museums. Notre Dame is a major tourist attraction in northern Indiana; in the 2015‚Äì2016 academic year, more than 1.8 million visitors, almost half of whom were from outside of St. Joseph County, visited the campus. \\\\- When the university was founded in 1842, the only building on site was the Log Chapel, which had been built in 1831. Under the guidance of the founder and first president Edward Sorin, Old College and the first church and main building were built. The second main building, which constituted almost the entirety of the university facilities, burnt down in 1879, and was followed the current Main Building was built. Campus has continued to grow ever since. The architectural style of the first building was an eclectic mix of 19th French and Victorian architecture, with collegiate gothic taking over at the beginning of the 20th century with architects such as Kervick and Fagan and Maginnis & Walsh. The latter half of the 20th century saw the use of modernist designs, but since the mid-1990s the University recommitted to the gothic architecture keeping the specific materials and forms of the older parts of campus. Many of the older structures on were inserted in 1973 on the National Register of Historic Places. The center of campus is Main Quad, often called God Quad, which hosts the Main Building and the Basilica, and other important buildings and residence halls. The North-West area of campus is mainly dedicated to residential buildings, the Central-East portion of campus is dedicated to academic spaces, while the South-East is dedicated to athletics. Apart from Main Quad, there are 6 quadrangles: North Quad, Mod Quad, and West Quad (mainly residential), South Quad and Bond Quad (mixed residential and academic), and DeBartolo Quad (only academic). \\\\- Map of the campus  Surroundings  St. Mary's lake in the spring The University of Notre Dame is located in Notre Dame, Indiana, a census designated place in St. Joseph County, near South Bend and Mishawaka, in the Michiana region. It is 5 miles south of the Indiana-Michigan border, and it is served by exit 77 of the Indiana Toll Road, which is concurrent with Interstate 90 and Interstate 80.  The Lakes  The campus contains two lakes, which provide its name (Notre Dame du lac meaning \\"Our Lady of the lake\\"), St. Mary's lake and St. Joseph's lake. St. Joseph's Lake has a small beach and pier for swimming and a boating facility for student use. There has been speculations on the fact that the name of the University references a single lake instead of two Eddy Street Commons Eddy Street Commons is a mix-used development that opened in the summer of 2009. It hosts venues, businesses, services, and apartment complexes that make it a small college town for the University. Phase 2 of construction, a $150 million development, will include more than 400 apartments, 8,500 square ft of retail, a new Robinson Community Learning Center, and a new Embassy Suites hotel. Cemeteries The University campus is home to two cemeteries, one reserved for members of the Congregation of Holy Cross, and the other open to the general public. The identical tombstones in the Holy Cross Cemetery Holy Cross Cemetery is reserved for members of the Congregation of Holy Cross, which founded the University. All burials are identical and composed by a simple stone cross with the name of the deceased and his dates. Burials include Rev. Edward Sorin, Rev. William Corby, Fr. John Zahm, Rev. Theodore Hesburgh. All but one of Notre Dame‚Äôs 14 deceased presidents are buried in the community cemetery. The exception is Cardinal John O‚ÄôHara, CSC, the order‚Äôs first cardinal, who is entombed inside the Basilica of the Sacred Heart on campus. Professor Joseph Lyons, namesake of Lyons Hall, was the first case of a layman being buried there. In 1892, a monument was erected on his tomb, consisting of a granite obelisk with the words \\"Erected to his memory as a tribute of the affection of the old students.\\" and \\"He was always the same-kind and gentle, sincere and self-sacrificing.\\" Cedar Grove Cemetery was established in 1843 by Rev. Edward Sorin, soon after he founded the University. Notable burials include Dave Duerson, Moose Krause, Arthur Erich Haas, Ray Lemek, Ralph McInerny, Ara Parseghian, Joe Kernan, and Regis Philbin. The brothers of the congregation also established a mortuary, one of the first in Indiana. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries it was a Catholic cemetery open to the public. In 1977 ownership was transferred from the Congregation to the University. At this time it became a private cemetery, and burials were reserved for Notre Dame faculty, staff, and retirees with the requisite years of service. Despite recent expansions that brought it to 22 acres, space is very limited. In response to persistent requests, in recent years it has been opened to Notre Dame alumni with the creation of four mausoleums complexes.  Buildings  The Notre Dame campus is composed of around 190 buildings, divided in Quads. Main Quad is at the center, North Quad and Mod Quad are at the north, while South, West and DeBartolo Quads are in the south.  Administration  Main building and the Golden Dome The Main Building houses various offices, including the Office of the President and admissions. It was built in 1879, after the previous main building, built in 1865, was destroyed by a fire. Construction started May 17 and was finished by the start of the following academic year. The architect was the American Willoughby J. Edbrooke, principally devoted to the Romanesque style, that is reflected in the design of the building itself. Fifty-six bricklayers and 4.35 million bricks were necessary to complete it, and once finished it stood 187 feet tall. The building also houses the Columbus murals, a group of large paintings by Italian painter and Notre Dame professor Luigi Gregori, depicting the discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus. Gregori also painted with figures representing Religion, Philosophy, Science, History, Fame, Poetry and Music the interior of the Golden Dome, the University most recognizable landmark. It was gilded in gold in 1886 and crowned with a 19 feet tall statue of \\"Our Mother\\", the namesake of the university. The statue was designed and furnished by the girls of the nearby St. Mary's College, and it is a replica of the statue of Mary in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, erected by Pius IX. Flanner Hall and Grace Hall, are two 11-story-high buildings that were initially part of a planned complex of five high-rise buildings, yet were the only two to be actually constructed. They were male residence halls until 1997, when the residents were moved to newly created Knott and O'Neill Halls. The offices housed in these two buildings include the Career Center and Card services, and many other offices of administration. Flanner Hall also houses a chapel dedicated to Saint Andre Bessette, CSC, the first saint of the Congregation of the Holy Cross. A \\"#1\\" neon sing is placed atop of Grace Hall, and lit whenever a Fighting Irish team is ranked #1 . Inside of Hammes Bookstore, Notre Dame, IN. Located on South Quad in front of the dining hall, the Coleman Morse Center was built in 2001 and serves mainly administrative purposes, although there are seven classrooms and praying spaces. It includes the offices of the First Year of Studies, Campus Ministries, and Academic Service for Student Athletes. The main hall features a Kugel Fountain, which contains a 13,000 pound granite ball. It was built on the previous site of the Hammes Notre Dame Bookstore. Carole Sanders Hall Carole Sandner Hall was named after Carole Sanders, mother of seven foster children, from Lake Buff after being donated as a gift from her husband. It replaces the previous convent of the Sisters of the Holy Cross.http://www.triblocal.com/lake- bluff/2011/09/24/university-of-notre-dame-names-academic-building-after-lake- bluff-woman/ The building costed $11.5, and houses the Alliance for Catholic Education. a volunteering program that prepares college students to serve in Catholic and parochial schools in the US.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-09-28/news/ct-met-notre-dame-first- lady-20110928_1_lake-bluff-woman-jack-sandner-holy-cross The program was founded in 1993 by Fathers Timothy Scully and Sean McGraw and serves dioceses in need over the country by providing education to lower income families. The building is environmentally friendly and was awarded the LEED Gold certification. It encloses a cloister garden that recalls the former convent of the Holy Cross novitiate. St Liam's Hall, the University Health Services Student Health services are hosted in St. Liam Hall. The first University infirmary was destroyed in the great fire of 1879, and rebuilt the same year in the same spot behind Main Building. This structured survived until 1936, when it was razed to build the current structure. The present hall was built as the Notre Dame Student Infirmary in the spring of 1936, and designed by the Boston architecture firm of Maginnis and Walsh in the Collegiate-Gothic style structure.http://www.archives.nd.edu/Scholastic/VOL_0069/VOL_0069_ISSUE_0023.pdfhttp://www.archives.nd.edu/Alumnus/VOL_0014/VOL_0014_ISSUE_0009.pdf Construction started 27 May 1935 and the building was finished 14 April 1936. The infirmary, the largest of its kind in the country, contained 100 rooms, including five wards and twenty-four private rooms that could accommodate 125 patients. The Sisters of the Holy Cross and two physicians staffed the infirmary. In 2007 Mr and Mrs William K. Warren, Jr., donated $8 million to the University of Notre Dame for the refurbishment of the health center, which was renamed Saint Liam Hall. The Warrens are prominent donors to the University of Notre Dame; the Notre Dame golf course is called the Warren Golf Course. The university stated the building was named in honor of Mr. Warren's father William K. Warren, Sr. (Liam is Irish for William) and his namesake Saint William of York.  Academic buildings  DeBartolo Hall, located on DeBartolo Quad, is the all-multipurpose classroom building on campus and could fit the entire student body at one time. It doubled the university's classroom space when it was built in 1992. Its 73 rooms (consisting of 75% of the university's classroom space) range from Notre Dame's largest lecture hall, which seats 465, to small 20-seat seminar rooms and computer clusters, all equipped with interactive digital learning. It was built thanks to a donation from the DeBartolo family. Libraries The Hesburgh Library is the primary building of the library system of the University of Notre Dame. The building opened on September 18, 1963, as the Memorial Library. It was named after Father Theodore Hesburgh in 1987. The library has 3.39 million volumes, the 61st largest collection among all U.S. research universities. The finished structure, which is 210 feet (64 m) tall, has a 429,780 square feet (39,928 m2) interior, which also hosts study spaces, digital learning infrastructure, rare manuscripts, library administration and several academic centers. In 2015 the university began major renovations to the library that will modernize its interior design.http://www.ndsmcobserver.com/2.2756/the-future-of-hesburgh- library-1.799308#.UniDapTq8mw The library system also includes branch libraries for Architecture, Chemistry and Physics, Engineering, Law, and Mathematics as well as information centers in the Mendoza College of Business, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, and a slide library in O'Shaughnessy Hall. Law School The Arch connecting Eck (on the left) and Biolchini (on the right) Halls The first Law School building was built in 1930. In 2004, the Kresge Law Library became one of the few academic law libraries to own more than 600,000 volumes. This was accomplished mainly under the tenure of the fifth law librarian, Roger Jacobs, who also served as head librarian of the Library of the United States Supreme Court. Between 2007 and 2008, a major expansion was added as the Eck Hall of Law, with 85.000 square feet of surface. In 2010 Robert Biolchini, alumnus, funded the renovation of the Kresge Law Library, that was renamed Biolchini Hall of Law. The renovated Biolchini Hall has surface of 106,500 square feet (for a total of 192,500 with Eck Hall of Law), two 50-seat class, a seminar room, 29 group study rooms, and hosts 300,000 book volumes and more than 300,000 volumes in microfilm. The total cost of renovations and expansions was approximately 58 million dollars. Mendoza College of Business The Mendoza College of Business main building, located on DeBartolo Quad, was built in 1996 and designed by Ellerbe Becket. Its 196,986 square feet of space includes the 300-seat Jordan Auditorium, classrooms, offices, administration, and digital spaces. The Potenziani Family Atrium features an original and refurbished NYSE trading post from 1929 that was in use until 1981. The Stayer Center for Executive Education, built between 2011 and 2013 and located immediately south of the main Mendoza building, hosts the both degree and non- degree programs aimed at the executive-level MBA students and corporate clients. It is built in collegiate architecture style and was designed by RRobert A.M. Stern Architects, and features an elegant interior, state of the art digital infrastructure, and stained glass windows. College of Arts and Letters Built in 1953, O'Shaughnessy Hall is the main center of the Notre Dame College of Arts and Letters, hosting classrooms, art galleries, a coffee shop, and administrative offices.

Sheedy, and 7 stained glass windown, representing the seven liberal arts. The Great Hall also hosts two tapestries that were rediscovered and restored in 2014 when the Hall was restored to its original appearance. One tapestry is of German or Belgian production from the 17th century, while the other one is from 18th century France. It was featured in the movie Rudy. Bond Hall Originally built in 1917 as the University Library, it is today the home of the Notre Dame School of Architecture. It is the only building built in Renaissance style, and one of the two building in stone.  Religious buildings  At Notre Dame, chapels are found in a number of academic buildings and in every residence hall. There are 57 chapels on campus, including Basilica of the Sacred Heart. Basilica of the Sacred Heart Originally known as Sacred Heart Parish, the Basilica of the Sacred Heart also serves as the mother church of the Congregation of Holy Cross in the United States. The neo-gothic church has 44 large stained glass windows and murals completed over a 17-year period by the Vatican painter Luigi Gregori. The basilica bell tower is high, making it the tallest University chapel in America. Grotto of Lourdes The Grotto Built in 1896, the Grotto is reproduction of the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes.  Residential halls  There are currently 31 undergraduate residence halls at the University of Notre Dame. Each residence hall is single sex, with 16 all-male residence halls and 15 all-female residence halls.University of Notre Dame, Office of Residence Life and Housing, http://housing.nd.edu/undergraduate/general- info/facts-figures/ All first-year students are not only guaranteed on-campus housing, but are required to reside on-campus for three years. Many of the halls were inserted in 1973 on the National Register of Historic Places.https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/r/1c9d1/N/University_of_Notre_Dame_Campus_Main_and_South_Quadrangles_St._Joseph_CO_Nom.pdf Notre Dame has a unique undergraduate hall system, where students rarely switch dorms and each dorms builds its own spirit, tradition, mascot, sport teams, events, dances and reputation. Approximately 80% of undergraduate students live on-campus, and generally a student usually resides in the same dorm for the entirety of their undergraduate career. A huge segment of student life happens though residence halls and students develop a particular attachment to their undergraduate hall. Each residence hall is directed by with one Rector with the assistance of two Assistant Rectors and a variable number of Resident Assistants (from 4 to 9). Every residence hall has a chapel where Mass is held, fields a variety of intramural sports teams, elects one senator to represent the dorm in Student Government, and elects co-presidents which work through the Hall Presidents Council (HPC) student organization.  Museums  Snite Museum of Art The Snite Museum of Art is a fine art museum on the University of Notre Dame campus, near South Bend, Indiana. It owns over 23,000 works which represent many principal world cultures and periods, with a focus on Western art history. It is particularly known for its Italian Renaissance paintings and their Mesoamerican galleries. According to the website, ...\\"the museum now exhibits the most important collection of Olmec art in any art museum in the United States. The Unruh purchase reinforces the Museum's position as one of the most important general pre-Columbian collections in this country.\\"  Recreational facilities  Washington Hall LaFortune Student Center LaFortune Student Center A Science Hall was built in 1883 under the direction of Fr. Zahm, but in 1950 it was converted to a student union building and named LaFortune Center, after Joseph LaFortune, an oil executive from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

In Memory of Edward Sorin, Superior General of the Congregation of the Holy Cross, Founder of the University of Notre Dame, who, renowned for apostolic virtues, most zealous for American Catholic Education, born February 6, 1814, lived for 78 years and ten months, students, alumni, and friends have erected this pledge of their respect and gratitude in the year of salvation regained 1905. } Venite ad Me Omnes Venite ad Me Omnes The statue represents the Sacred Heart of Jesus. It was sculpted by Robert Cassiani and dedicated during the 1893 commencement exercises. it represents Jesus and the inscription translates to \\"Come to me everyone\\". It was modeled after the statue of the Sacred Heart by Gabriel Thomas, which stood at the Montmartre basilica until 1900. It faces the lady on the golden dome. It underwent restoration in 2013. Clarke Memorial Fountain Clark Memorial Fountain Modeled after Stonehenge, it is a peace monument commemorating around 500 Notre Dame alumni who died in World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam War. The names of those wars are carved in three of its arches, and the fourth arch bears the Latin inscription Pro Patria et Pace, \\"For Country and Peace.\\" It was designed in 1983 by architects John Burgee (alumnus of the University) and Philip Johnson. It was dedicated in 1986, the fountain was underwritten by Notre Dame alumnus Thomas Shuff and by its principal benefactor, Maude Clarke of Chicago. Mrs. Clarke's donation was made in memory of her husband John, an investment banker who once served on the business college's advisory council. Both of the Clarkes had also been Army officers in World War II. The Fountain is the centerpiece of Fieldhouse Mall, a park-like area with benches and formal gardens that graces the southern end of the quad. The mall serves as a crossway between Hesburgh Library and the Main Quad, but is also a popular place for festivals, social activities, and marching band rehearsals. The site was created when the Old Fieldhouse was torn down in 1983, and consistent with Notre Dame's steadfast sense of tradition, there now stands a buff brick monument to that long-gone gymnasium. Statue of Rev.Corby A statue of President Corby stands in front of Corby Hall. Corby served as chaplain of the Irish Brigade during the battle of Gettysburg. Hence, an identical statue is present at Gettysburgh. The statue is attributed the football nickname \\"Fair Catch Corby\\". Saint Edward the Confessor Saint Edward's Hall with statue It was created by Froc-Robert & Sons in 1880. It was installed in 1883, gift of the Sorin association. St. Edward was the patron saint of Father Sorin. The statue is made of bronze and is tall approximately 7 feet tall. The statue holds a scepter and a small church, reminiscent of the campus basilica. Moses Statue of Moses Locate outside the west entrance of Hesburgh Library, it was created by Joseph Turkalji in 1962. His foot stands on the neck of a calf, and his right hand index finger points to the sky. It represents a passage from Exodus. As many Notre Dame statues, Moses has a double meaning regarding American football. He is either known as \\"First Down Moses\\" or \\"Number #1 Moses\\". The horns of the head of Moses are probably referring to one of the most famous depictions of Moses in sculpture, the statue by Michelangelo. Christ and the Samaritan Woman The sculpture featured is found gracing the western entrance of O'Shaughnessy Hall, the home of the College of Arts and Letters. It was executed in 1957 by the Croatian sculptor Ivan Mestrovic, who was in residence at Notre Dame from 1955 until his death in 1962, on the model of a sculpture he had completed in wood relief thirty years earlier for a chapel in his native town of Split, Croatia. The Notre Dame sculpture, which depicts the Samaritan woman's gradual recognition of Jesus as the Savior as narrated in John 4:1‚Äì42, is full of expressive gesture that conveys the drama and subtle nuances of their communication. The statue is part of a memorial that includes benches, trees, and the statues of St. John and the prophet Isaiah.

The memorial commemorates people displaced as a result of the Yalta Conference at the conclusion of the Second World War. Created by the British sculptor Angela Conner, the work consists of twelve bronze busts atop a stone base. The memorial was dedicated in 1986 to replace a previous memorial (also by Conner) from 1982 that had been repeatedly damaged by vandalism. Location The memorial is located in the Yalta Memorial Garden at the junction of Cromwell Gardens, Thurloe Place and Thurloe Square, adjacent to the Victoria & Albert Museum to the north. The garden and memorial are publicly accessible at all times. History Plans for a memorial were initiated after a letter was written to The Spectator in the 1970s signed by Richard West, Patrick Marnham and Auberon Waugh who proposed that a memorial be erected to the \\"... memory of the hundreds of thousands of innocent people who were forcibly repatriated by the Allies to the Soviet and Yugoslav authorities at the end of the Second World War, a crime that was carefully hushed up at the time and even concealed from Parliament for fear of the outcry that would have resulted\\". A later letter to The Times calling for a memorial was signed by politicians Bernard Braine, Jo Grimond, Donald J. Stewart, John Mackintosh, James Molyneaux, Gwynfor Evans, Nicholas Bethell, John Foster, Christopher Mayhew, and Harmar Nicholls, and writers Rebecca West, Hugh Trevor-Roper, Nicolas Cheetham, Nikolai Tolstoy and John Jolliffe. Braine and Jolliffe later appealed for funds in a letter to The Times in 1978. The cost was of the memorial was estimated at ¬£11,000 in their letter. The memorial was approved by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in May 1980, over the objections of the Foreign Office who opposed the erection on land that belonged to the Crown Estate of a monument that implicitly criticised the past actions of the British government. A memorial fountain with stone benches sculpted by Angela Conner was built and dedicated by the Bishop of London, Graham Leonard, on 6 March 1982. The creation of the memorial was opposed by both the government of the Soviet Union and the Foreign Office. The memorial was repeatedly vandalised and was irreparably damaged after being cut in two by an electric stone- cutting saw in the autumn of 1982. An appeal for a second monument was launched and Conner sold lithographs for ¬£50 each depicting scenes of brutality against refugees to help raise funds. Conner's second memorial for Yalta, Twelve Responses to Tragedy, was dedicated in the same place as the previous memorial on 2 August 1986 by the Bishop of Fulham, John Klyberg. Reviewing Conner's recent work in The Times in October 1986, critic John Russell Taylor wrote that the memorial \\"hardly rise[s] above the level of kitsch\\". In 2013 the memorial was described as being in a poor condition. Description The original memorial showed a sphere kept in perpetual motion by jets of water. The present memorial consists of a stone column upon a brick plinth, upon the column sits a bronze bust of 12 conjoined heads of men, women, and children. On the south side of the memorial at ground level inscription on stone reads: An inscription on a curved stone plinth on the east side of the memorial reads: The inscription on the memorial was personally approved by Margaret Thatcher during her tenure as Prime Minister. The memorial has been described as a war memorial as it was created in response to events that arose out of the conclusion of the Second World War.

The Freemasons Crushed Abb√© Larudan is best known for his expos√© on Freemasonry called Les Franc- Ma√ßons ecras√©s, Suite du livre intitule l'Ordre des Franc-Ma√ßons trahi, traduit du Latin (The Freemasons Crushed, a Continuation of the Book entitled The Order of Freemasons BetrayedCoil, Henry Wilson. Coil's Masonic Encyclopedia. Cf. Larudan, L'Abb√©. Macoy Publishing & Masonic Supply Company. 1961.), published in Amsterdam in 1746. This book is presented as a sequel or an extended volume to the 1742 expos√© on Freemasonry by Abb√© Gabriel-Louis P√©rau.Mackey, Albert G. Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, Vol. I. Cf. Larudan, Abbe. The Masonic History Company. 1909. This book was the principle weapon used by Anti-Masons that came after Abb√© Larudan, according to Georg Kloss.Kloss, Georg. Bibliographie der Freimaurerei . Frankfurt, Germany. 1844. This Masonic exposure is most notable for being the first the posit the theory that Oliver Cromwell created the society of Freemasons for the sole purpose of overthrowing the English monarchy and placing himself at the head of the Commonwealth of England. This theory is founded upon two claims: first, that the ideologies of Freemasonry and Cromwell's political agenda are similar (i.e. liberty and equality for all people); and second, that he gathered this information from an anonymous Grand Master of English Freemasons.Mackey, Albert G. The History of Freemasonry, Vol. II, Chp. XXXII. The Masonic History Company. 1906. Pg. 293-294. According to Abb√© Larudan, Cromwell initiated his closest friends‚Äîwho were dedicated to his mission to free everyone from the tyrannical rule of the monarchs‚Äîinto this secret society he called the Freemasons, and held them under severe oaths of loyalty, and that he received instruction to do this by divine providence. Abb√© Larudan delivers the narrative of this origin of Freemasonry in such absurdly minute detail as to warrant suspicion, especially given the almost complete lack of detail provided for the actual rituals and ceremonies of Cromwell's associates into this newly founded secret society.Mackey, Albert G. The History of Freemasonry, Vol. II, Chp. XXXII. The Masonic History Company. 1906. Pg. 296-297. According to Arthur Edward Waite it was a Catholic attempt to slander Freemasonry by assigning it a Protestant origin.Waite, Arthur E. A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, Vol. I. Cf. Cromwell and Masonry. Cosimo, Inc. 2007. The theory of the origin of Freemasonry as a cult of Oliver Cromwell has been refuted by most Masonic scholars, and is largely held as being an invention of Abb√© Larudan's imagination. In addition to this Cromwellian theory, Abb√© Larudan provides supplements to the exposure of Masonic ritual and catechism, such as the floor drawings. These floor drawings are often called the trestle board or tracing board in Masonic ritual, which later became known as carpets, because they were originally the emblems of Freemasonry that were manually drawn on the floor,Davis, Robert G. The Mason‚Äôs Words. Building Stone Publishing. 2013. Pg. 17. and then later imprinted on carpets.Macoy, Robert and Oliver, George. ‚ÄúCyclopedia of Freemasonry,‚Äù General History, Cyclopedia, and Dictionary of Freemasonry. Cf. Carpet. Masonic Publishing Company. 1870. Abb√© Larudan's trestle boards are unique in that they are depicting the space of the Lodge room in perspective.Vidler, Anthony. The Writing of the Walls. Princeton Architectural Press. 1987. Pg. 88. But like his theory of Cromwell's invention of Freemasonry, Abb√© Larudan's trestle boards are equally contrived from his own imagination, as they bear no semblance to any actual trestle boards, either Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, or Master Mason designed prior or since this Masonic expos√©.For examples of traditional Masonic trestle boards, reference Phoenix Masonry: Tracing Boards. Impact The Freemasons Crushed had hardly any impact when it was published, even among Anti-Masons. In fact, the whole Cromwellian origin of Masonry would have fallen into total obscurity had it not been revived by L√©o Taxil a century and a half after Abb√© Larudan. Taxil claims that the \\"Lord Protector\\" (i.e. Cromwell) was initiated as a Freemason.Waite, Arthur E. A New Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, Vol. I. Cf. Cromwell and Masonry. Cosimo, Inc. 2007. This goes along with his infamous libel campaign against Freemasonry and Catholicism, known as the Taxil hoax. Identity Who the Abb√© Larudan was is somewhat of a mystery. Other than his writings, he is totally unknown. Jacques Brengues speculated in his La Franc-Ma√ßonnerie du bois (1973) that Abb√© Larudan was Abb√© Henri Charles Arnauld de Pomponne (1669-1756), because \\"Larudan\\" is an anagram for \\"Arnauld\\".Biblioth√®que Nationale de France.

It is in size. The garden contains Twelve Responses to Tragedy (or the Yalta Memorial), a memorial located that commemorates people displaced as a result of the Yalta Conference at the conclusion of World War II. The memorial was dedicated in 1986 to replace a previous memorial dedicated in 1982 that had been repeatedly damaged by vandalism. The land on which the garden is situated was first described in 1928 when it was part of the Crown Estate by the Report of the Royal Commission on London Squares as a 'grass plot with a few trees'. The garden is located at the junction of Cromwell Gardens, Thurloe Place and is adjacent to the private Thurloe Square. The Victoria & Albert Museum is immediately north of the garden, on the opposite side of Cromwell Gardens. The museum maintains the garden. The garden and memorial are publicly accessible at all times. Design The plot of the garden is triangular, a central paved path leads to the apex of the triangle, the path is lined by ornamental trees, and a hedge forms a border around the garden.

General In 1990 Greg Laurie started holding his first public evangelistic event which would soon be called the Harvest Crusades. Since the first Crusade it has been estimated that nearly 4 million people have attended in stadiums, amphitheaters, and like venues. A typical Harvest Crusade begins with worship. After opening worship, songs from the Harvest Crusade Band (or local \\"praise teams\\" depending on the venue) and featured guest musicians perform and share stories of how God has changed their lives. Since all Harvest Crusades are held at the invitation of local churches, it is not uncommon for local pastors and other special guests to offer prayers between musical performances. After the music is finished, Laurie presents a simple evangelical gospel message from the Bible, often advertised as a \\"down to earth talk about heaven.\\" At the end of this message, Laurie invites the attendees to come forward toward the stage and publicly repent from their sins, profess their trust in Jesus Christ, and ask for salvation. After coming forward, each individual is greeted by a trained volunteer \\"decision follow-up counselor\\" from a local church. These counselors pray with the supplicants, answer questions, and provide them with free materials including a Bible. Harvest Crusades are free and open to the public. The organization is supported by private donations. Harvest has hosted large-scale evangelistic outreaches throughout the United States and in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In addition to music from top Christian artists, each event features a gospel message from Pastor Greg Laurie, including an invitation to accept Jesus Christ. Viewers around the world can connect via live webcasts, apps, podcasts, and social media in addition to radio and TV broadcasts. Harvest America In 2012, an annual nationwide simulcast event called \\"Harvest America\\" extended Harvest events into churches, theaters, and living rooms across the country. They began these events at a Harvest Crusade event in 2012, which was broadcast live from Angel Stadium to host sites around the world. The next year, the Harvest America ministry went to Philadelphia. In 2014, Harvest America went to Dallas, Texas and had an overall in person attendance of 25,00 and an online attendance of 100,000 in many host sites around the world. In March of 2016, Greg Laurie will be taking Harvest America to AT&T; Stadium in Dallas, Texas.

Notes from a lecture at the Museo del Prado, 2000. Retrieved 31 January 2016 The commission is first mentioned in a letter dated August 2, 1794, written to his friend Mart√≠n Zapater, which mentions that Goya that had been asked to paint life-sized portraits of the Dukes of Alba. Description The Black Duchess, 1797, Hispanic Society of America, New York. Here de Silva is dressed in low cut Maja clothing. She agreed to this depiction as it might show her as a \\"woman of the people\\".Hughes, 161 Goya was reluctant to part with the portrait; it remained with him for at least 15 years after it was completed. The painting is composed from white, red, blue and brown pigments, but is mostly, according to Hughes \\"built around two themes, red and white\\", with the other major colour being black, represented by her dark curly hair. Mar√≠a Cayetana de Silva was then 33 years old (middle aged for the time) and had recently recovered from a lengthy illness. She is presented with affection as a great beauty, and an engaging woman of wit and education.Connell, 103 She stands in a dignified pose, looking directly at the viewer with a penetrating gaze. She is dressed in a full-length French style flowing white dress ‚Äì far more elegant than the Maja style of the 1797 painting. The dress is made from white muslin fabric hemmed with gold embroidery. She has white pearl earrings, a wide red or scarlet sash and trimming, red pearl necklace and beads and red bows on her breast and wrapped in her hair. A bichon frise stands beside her. The dog also wears a red ribbon on one of its hind legs. Her left arm is adorned with golden jewelry, placed at her wrist and above her elbow. She points with the index finger of her right hand towards an inscription on the ground, which includes Goya's autograph, a dating of 1795 and \\"A la duquesa de Alba Fr. de Goya 1795\\".Du Gu√© Trapier, Elizabeth. \\"Only Goya\\". The Burlington Magazine, 102.685, 1960. 158‚Äì161 The almost Neoclassical style of her dress may have been influenced by the English print cabinet style of Gainsborough, William Hogarth, George Romney and Joshua Reynolds, whose works Goya probably knew from black-and-white reproductions. The portrait is in many ways formal. The choice to present her in an exterior indicates her wealth by displaying her land holdings. Because she was so highly respected and known to have a forceful personality, it is thought she had a strong influence on the final depiction. Art historians have mused that a love affair existed between the painter and model, although there is no surviving evidence. Skeptics argue that because de Silva was famously beautiful, wealthy, and independent she would not have been interested in the successful but significantly older and unwell Goya. The two full-length portraits are known to have been significant to Goya. He held the Black Duchess in his possession for at least 15 years. Robert Hughes describes the \\"White Duchess\\" as a portrait fit for \\"semi-public consumption\\".

Thomas Professor of History and African American Studies at Harvard University. Higginbotham wrote Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church: 1880‚Äì1920, which won several awards. She has also received several awards for her work, most notably the 2014 National Humanities Medal. Early life and education Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham was born in Washington, DC, in 1945 to Albert Neal Dow Brooks and his wife Alma Elaine Campbell. Higginbotham's father served as secretary treasurer for the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History as well as edited the organization's Negro History Bulletin. Her mother, Alma Elaine Campbell, a high school history teacher, later became the supervisor for history in the Washington, D.C. public school system. Higginbotham often accompanied her father to his work, which allowed her to encounter and become familiar with many significant early African American historians, including Rayford Logan, Charles H. Wesley and Benjamin Quarles. Higginbotham later related how this unique experience shaped her later career choice, ‚ÄúI knew from childhood that I wanted to teach, research, and write about the history of African Americans.\\" Stories her father told her of her family members also inspired her. Her great- grandfather, Albert Royal Brooks, was born a slave in Virginia in 1817, and after the American Civil War then began to serve on the jury to try former Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Higginbotham's great-grandmother, Lucy Goode Brooks, created one of the first post-Civil War orphanages serving black children. Her grandfather, Walter Henderson Brooks, was a pastor at Nineteenth Street Baptist Church (Washington, D.C.), the oldest black Baptist congregation in Washington D.C. Higginbotham's aunt, Julia Evangeline Brooks, was one of the incorporators of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the first African-American sorority. ‚ÄúIn many ways,‚Äù Higginbotham says, ‚Äúthe family stories inspired me to pursue the discipline of history and gave me an appreciation of the importance of individual lives, broadly speaking, as a lens or mirror to much larger social and political contexts.‚Äù In 1969, Higginbotham received her B.A. history degree from the University of Wisconsin, then in 1974 went on to receive her M.A. history degree from Howard University. In 1975 she earned a certification in Archival Administration and Record Management from the U.S. National Archives. In 1977 she earned a certification in quantitative methodology in Social Science from the Newberry Library in Chicago. In 1984 she received her Ph.D. degree in history from the University of Rochester. She also married A. Leon Higginbotham, who would die in 1998. Career Higginbothan taught American history and counseled students completing the eighth grade at Francis Parkman Jr. High School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from 1969 to 1971. After she moved to Washington D.C., she taught American history and social studies at Woodrow Wilson High School. From 1974 to 1975 she worked as a manuscript research associate at Moorland-Spingarn Research Center at Howard University. Higginbotham also taught history as a professor at Dartmouth College, the University of Maryland and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1993, Higginbothan became a professor of Afro-American Studies and African American Religious History at Harvard University where she still currently works today. In 1990 she was named the Victor S. Thomas Professor of History and African American Studies. Higginbotham became the chair of Harvard University's African American Studies department in 2006 and served as acting-director of the W. E. B Du Bois Institute for African American Research in 2008. Higginbotham was also appointed as the Inaugural John Hope Franklin Professor of American Legal History at Duke University Law School. Publications and work Higginbotham's writing spans a variety of diverse topics that include African-American religious history, women's history, civil rights, constructions of racial and gender identity, electoral politics and the combination and intersection of theory and history. Higginbotham's most notable piece of work is her book Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church: 1880‚Äì1920. This book won numerous awards including awards from the American Historical Association, the American Academy of Religion, the Association of Black Women Historians and the Association for Research on Non-Profit and Voluntary Organizations. Righteous Discontent: The Women's Movement in the Black Baptist Church: 1880‚Äì1920 was also on the New York Times Book Reviews Notable Books of the Year in both 1993 and 1992. Higginbotham has also revised and re-written African-American history survey From Slavery to Freedom, which was originally published in 1947 by John Hope Franklin. She has worked with Henry Louis Gates, Jr. as co-editor of the African American National Biography, a 12-volume resource of information that presents African American history in over 5,000 biographical entries. Her article \\"African American Women's History and the Metalanguage of Race\\" won the best article prize of the Berkshire Conference of Women Historians in 1993 and continues to be one of her most cited and reprinted articles. Higginbotham has won numerous awards throughout the years for her books, publications and research. In 1994 she received the Scholar's Medal of the University of Rochester. In 2000 she was awarded the YWCA of Boston's Women of Achievement Award. In 2003 Harvard University chose Higginbotham to be a Walter Channing Fellow in recognition of her achievements in history.

Each episode features between one and four articles discussed by the host, with excerpts read directly from the article and commented upon. New episodes are released every Tuesday with occasional bonus episodes focusing on articles chosen by the presenters or suggested by listeners. The podcast is hosted by Jack Stewart, who is also responsible for the technical and editing duties.Wikishuffle Interview, Youtube Retrieved 2016-01-31 Philip Sharman takes responsibility for reading out the articles, while Chris Wallace provides interjections. The tone is generally humorous, but the show also covers serious articles, such as the 2011 San Fernando massacre, and discusses political and current affairs topics in the context of the random articles that are selected. The show also features more general news items in relation to Wikipedia and advocates the importance of the site as an educational and societal resource, and encourages listeners to donate to the Wikimedia Foundation. The format is dependent upon a high level of listener interaction, with communication encouraged via social media and through the post. Various running jokes have been established, including the prevalence of moth articles, the disproportionate number of articles covered which make reference to Scranton, Pennsylvania and Sharman's age and inability to keep up-to-date with popular culture and modern technologies.  History  Stewart and Wallace began podcasting in early 2015, with a podcast called Not This Again, recorded in Stewart's spare roomNTA Interview with James Edward Bagshaw, Youtube Retrieved 2016-01-31 The show was interview based and, after the pair began to find difficulty in securing a regular supply of interviewees, they started to look for an alternative format to differentiate them from the large number of independent podcasts available. Philip Sharman had been a guest on Not This Again and spoke with Stewart and Wallace about an idea he had for developing a Wikipedia podcast. The initial idea was for a serious, documentary style podcast, using the random article button to seed stories. However, it became clear that the three presenters were better suited to a more lighthearted approach, resulting in the development of the current format. The first three episodes were released together on 14 April 2015, hosted by the Swedish podcasting service Acast. In August 2015, the recording of the podcast moved from Corby to a dedicated recording studio in Kettering, Northamptonshire, referred to in the podcast as Wikishuffle HQ. The 50th episode of Wikishuffle was released on 2 February 2016. On 24 January 2017 the podcast celebrated its 100th episode with a special 2 hour long entry featuring articles selected by the presenters. In episode 101 it was announced that Jack would be leaving the podcast indefinitely to go find himself in Asia. Two more episodes were released with friend of the show Ruth Bradley filling in for Jack, and has not updated since. The final episode was released on 28 March 2017.

Geocoding helps to enhance webpages by presenting location relevant information to the user. When used with Rails, Geocoder adds geocoding functionality such as finding coordinates with street addresses or vice versa in addition to distance calculations for ActiveRecord objects. Since the functionality does not rely on proprietary database functions, finding different geocoded objects in an area works out- of-the-box for databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.  Compatibility  Geocoder has been fully tested with Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, and JRuby 1.5.3. Geocoder is compatible with Rails 3, but there is only limited functionality with Rails 2.  Installation  The Prerequisites to installing Geocoder are Ruby and RubyGems. Geocoder gem can be installed with the following command: gem install geocoder Or, if you're using Bundler for Rails, you may add this to your Gemfile: gem 'geocoder' and run at the command prompt: bundle install It can be used as a plugin with rails too: rails plugin install git://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder.git  Configuration  In order to use Geocoder with objects, the project must be set up as follows:  Required attributes  = ActiveRecord = In order to use Geocoding with ActiveRecord objects, they must have two additional attributes, latitude and longitude coordinates. When stored in the table they should be called latitude and longitude but they may be changed as explained below. When using reverse geocoding (translating a user's location coordinates into a physical address), the model must implement a method that returns an address. The address may be a single attribute; however, it can also be a method which returns a string assembled from different attributes such as city, state, and country. = Mongoid = When using Mongoid, the model only needs to add the address, latitude and longitudes as fields. The model must also include Geocoder::Model::Mongoid before making any calls to the geocoded_by: method.  Model behavior  In the rails model, Geocoder must be told which method returns the object's full address: geocoded_by :full_street_address # can also be an IP address after_validation :geocode # auto-fetch coordinates For reverse geocoding, Geocoder must know which method returns latitude and longitude coordinates. If :address option is not provided, it fetches the address automatically in the address attribute. Else, it fetches the address into the location attribute like the example given below. reverse_geocoded_by :latitude, :longitude, :address => :location after_validation: reverse_geocode # auto-fetch address Forward and Reverse Geocoding on the same model is possible. geocoded_by :address reverse_geocoded_by :latitude, :longitude after_validation :geocode, :reverse_geocode In order to use different names for latitude and longitude in the model, the following change may be done when implementing geocoded_by: geocoded_by :address, :latitude => :lat, :longitude => :lon Additionally, the address method may return any string that would be used to search Google Maps. Any of the following examples will work: * \\"123 Sample St, New York, NY\\" * \\"Eiffel Tower, Paris, FR\\" * \\"Raleigh, NC, US\\"  Services  By default, Geocoder makes use of Google's geocoding API to retrieve addresses and coordinates. Currently, these address geocoding services are supported: * Google: * Yahoo: * Geocoder.ca: (US & Canada only)  Examples  Here are some examples to demonstrate Geocoder functionality: Hotel.near(\\"Raleigh, North Carolina\\") Finds hotels near Raleigh. @restaurant.distance_to(\\"Empire State Building\\") Finds the distance from @restaurant to the Empire State Building.  Applications  * Developers may also use Geocoder to convert a user's IP Address to their city location. By making such a conversion you may be able to offer user's content relevant to their current location without requiring to ask for it beforehand. * It may be used for geo-spatial analysis in order to recognize patterns within the information. This is very useful in data mining applications. * Web based GIS tools such as Google Maps, Yahoo Maps etc. include geocoding functionality.

Plot  After Leah, a scientist, saves the life of Samuel, an actor, their lives change dramatically. Samuel comes to believe that they have always been destined to fall in love and eventually convinces Leah of his metaphysical ideas.  Cast  * Stefanie Butler as Leah * Joe Egender as Samuel * Scott Cushman * Malin Yhr * Steve Wilcox  Production  The budget was less than $500,000. It is the first film to be produced by Local Hero.

It has rough, fibrous to stringy bark on the trunk and smooth grey to white bark on the smaller branches. Mature trees have elliptic to oblong or egg-shaped leaves, tiny flower buds in groups of three or seven, creamy white flowers and cup- shaped, bell-shaped or urn-shaped fruit. It grows in the Kimberley region of Western Australia and the Top End of the Northern Territory. Description Eucalyptus brachyandra is a straggly tree that grows to a height of or sometimes a shrub or a mallee, and forms a lignotuber. The bark is rough, fibrous to stringy on the trunk and sometimes on the larger branches and smooth, grey to white above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have elliptic to egg-shaped or almost round leaves long, wide arranged in opposite pairs and have a petiole. Adult leaves are usually oblong to egg-shaped, long wide on a petiole long. The opposite sides of the leaves are a different shade of dull, pale green. The flowers are borne in groups of three or seven on the ends of the branches or upper leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel up to long. Mature buds are pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from August to November and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped, bell-shaped or urn-shaped capsule long and wide, among the smallest in the genus. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus brachyandra was first formally described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1859 from a specimen \\"on the rocky slopes of the upper Victoria River\\" and the description was published in the Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society, Botany. The specific epithet (brachyandra) is derived from the ancient Greek words brachys (Œ≤œÅŒ±œáœçœÇ), meaning \\"short\\" and anƒìr, genitive andros (·ºÄŒΩŒÆœÅ, genitive ·ºÄŒΩŒ¥œÅœåœÇ), meaning \\"male\\",Backer, C.A.

Distribution and habitat Tropical red box is found on rocky sites or in rock fissures in the Kimberley region of Western Australia growing in sandy skeletal soils over sandstone or quartzite. It is also found in the north west of the Northern Territory from south of Darwin, Northern Territory extending south west from the Tabletop Range through the Victoria River catchment area to the Western Australian border. Its usual habitat is on sandstone plateaus and ridge tops.

It has grey or grey-brown rough, shortly fibrous bark that is persistent on the trunk and larger branches. The upper bark is smooth, white to grey or pinkish above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are square in cross-section and leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs near the ends of the branches, then alternate, lance-shaped, long, wide and have a petiole. Adult leaves are narrow lance-shaped, long, wide on a petiole long and the same glossy green on both sides. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, nine or eleven on a peduncle long, the individual flowers sessile or on a pedicel up to long. The mature flower buds are green or yellow to reddish brown, oval, oblong or pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded to conical operculum. Flowering occurs between January and April or between October and December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, cup-shaped, conical, hemispherical or barrel-shaped capsule long, wide with the valves level with the rim or slightly longer. Taxonomy Eucalyptus brachycalyx was first formally described by the botanist William Blakely and the description was published in his book Key Eucalypts. The specific epithet (brachycalyx) is from the Greek brachys meaning \\"short\\" and calyx meaning \\"cup\\" or \\"calyx\\", referring to the small buds. Distribution Gilja is found on sand dunes and limestone plains along the south coast in the Goldfields-Esperance region extending from the Fitzgerald River National Park in the west to the South Australian border. In South Australia it is found along the southern coast from the eastern edge of the Nullarbor Plain extending through the Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula and Fleurieu Peninsula along the south coast extending north into the Flinders Ranges and Gawler Range.

He trained horses for over forty years and won his first Tennessee Walking Horse World Grand Championship at age 74 with Dark Spirit's Rebel; at the time, he was the oldest rider to win the honor. He was inducted into the Tennessee Walking Horse Hall of Fame in 1987 and named trainer of the year in 1980 and 1991. In 1999 at age 81, Dunn surpassed his own record for the oldest winning rider by winning his second World Grand Championship, riding RPM. He died of a heart attack in January 2001. Life and career Dunn was born on May 15, 1918 in Scott County, Kentucky, near Lexington, the second child and only son of Lucius and Sadie Burgess Dunn. He was named Emerson but was generally known as \\"Bud\\". Horses played a large part in his early life, and he later said that he \\"came into the world around them\\". Dunn began training horses in his teens, and in 1951 he began to specialize in training Tennessee Walking Horses, a gaited breed often ridden in saddle seat competition, noted for its unique \\"running walk\\". Dunn's training facility, Bud Dunn Stables, (later Bud Dunn and Son Stables) was in Florence, Alabama, on a ten-acre property. Dunn moved to north Alabama from Georgia in the 1950s, and bought out another trainer who was quitting the horse business. By the mid-1980s, Dunn had over 50 horses in training at a time, and had several full-time employees. He also judged Tennessee Walking Horse shows, including the Spring Celebration, an annual Tennessee Walking Horse show in Shelbyville, Tennessee that is traditionally popular with trainers who hope to enter horses in the National Celebration later in the year. Bud Dunn exhibiting RPM, winning the World Grand Championship in 1999 at age 81. Dunn trained and showed Tennessee Walking Horses for 50 years, and during his career won two World Grand Championships and 20 World Championships with various horses, competing in 125 to 150 horse shows a year. Dunn participated in the breed's major annual horse show, the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, nearly every year from 1950. By 1993 he was so popular that he often signed autographs for several hours before a performance. In total, Dunn personally showed 108 horses at the Celebration, and several hundred others which he trained were shown by other riders. Among them was Sundust Royal Flush, a stallion who, at the 1970 Celebration, won both the Preliminary Stallion class and the Three-Year-Old World Championship. Among other winning horses were Stock Exchange, who won the Junior Stallion Championship at the Dixie Jubilee in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1984, and Yankee Delight, who won the Grand Championship at the same show. Dunn rode both horses to their wins. Among horses that were trained by Dunn but ridden by amateur riders, Delight Puff and Stuff was Amateur Champion, and Aces Executive was Ladies' Champion, also in 1984. Bud Dunn exhibiting the three-year-old Tennessee Walking Horse stallion Go Boy's Sundust in Jackson, Mississippi. Despite Dunn's success, he did not ride a winning horse to the World Grand Championship until 1992; fellow trainers felt that he was blackballed because he did not live in the Shelbyville area, where the Celebration is held. With his eventual success, he twice became the oldest rider ever to win the World Grand Championship, the first time at age 74. Dunn was given the Trainer of the Year award by the Professional Walking Horse Trainers Organization for the first time in 1980. In 1987, he was inducted into the Tennessee Walking Horse Hall of Fame. In 1991 Dunn was named the Tennessee Walking Horse Professional Trainer of the Year by his fellow trainers for consistently showing and training top-quality horses. After his death, Dunn was inducted into the Lauderdale County Sports Hall of Fame in 2003. Dunn had three children: Billie Ann by his first wife; David and Steven by his second wife Charlotte Blythe Dunn, and no children with his third wife Elaine (n√©e Lewis). Steve Dunn also became a successful horse trainer, winning two World Grand Championships, the first before his father won one. Steve Dunn's winning horses were Motown Magic in 1989, and Out On Parole in 2002. Bud and Steve Dunn were at the time of Bud Dunn's death the only father and son to win World Grand Championships within the Tennessee Walking Horse industry. When Bud won his first World Grand Championship in 1992, three years after his son's first, Steve said, \\"I think him winning meant more to me than when I won it.\\" Bud Dunn said of his partnership with Steve, \\"I always wanted him to work out here. But ain't many fathers and sons ever got along that long.\\" Bud Dunn died on January 11, 2001 at the age of 82, following two heart attacks brought about by complications from knee replacement surgery. He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery, in Sheffield, Alabama, United States. Notable horses Dunn trained and rode his first World Grand Championship on the bay stallion Dark Spirit's Rebel. In 1991, the horse placed third in the competition. In 1992, the horse and rider pair won at most of the shows they had entered, including the World Grand Championship at that year's Celebration. Dunn had been training for 42 years at the time, and was 74 years old, making him the oldest trainer ever to win the class. The competition was held in front of a record crowd of 28,000. \\"Rebel\\" was the favorite horse going into the competition, out of a field of 13, and the team of Dunn and the stallion was described by the Florence TimesDaily as the \\"most popular team in Celebration history\\". Dunn said after the win, \\"I've been coming to the Celebration since 1950 and I've never seen anything like it. That made it twice as good. It's nice to know that I've got that many friends and supporters.\\" The following year, Dark Spirit's Rebel was retired from competition in a formal ceremony at the Celebration. Dunn's riding number, 1865, was also retired. Bud Dunn with Dark Spirit's Rebel after winning his first Tennessee Walking Horse World Grand Championship in 1992 at age 74. Dunn's second World Grand Champion was RPM, a son of Dark Spirit's Rebel. Dunn showed RPM to a Three-Year-Old World Championship in 1997. In 1998, RPM and Dunn won the Four-Year-Old World Championship and then placed second in the World Grand Championship; the latter achievement made them the Reserve World Grand Champions. Dunn had hopes of winning first the next year. In May 1999 the horse was sold to L R & N Partners, LLC for $1.25 million. The new owners moved RPM to trainer Sammy Day's stable in Shelbyville, with the intention of entering him in the Celebration. Shortly before the Celebration, Day was convicted of bribing a judge, fined, and put on a five-year suspension. Dunn was given the task of riding RPM in the show, and won the World Grand Championship. Dunn was 81, again making him the oldest rider ever to win the class, breaking his earlier record. At the same show, Steve Dunn rode Out On Parole to a Two-Year-Old World Championship, and another Dunn-trained horse, Broken Promises, won the Four-Year-Old World Championship.

The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped to conical or cup-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long and with the valves at rim level. Taxonomy Eucalyptus comitae-vallis was first formally described in 1923 by Joseph Maiden from a specimen collected from Comet Vale by John Thomas Jutson. The description was published in Maiden's book, A Critical Revision of the Genus Eucalyptus. The specific epithet (comitae-vallis) is the latinised version of the type location. In 1934, William Blakely described Eucalyptus brachycorys but the name is considered by the Australian Plant Census to be a synonym.

NKR facilitates over 450 \\"Kidney Paired Donation\\" (KPD) or \\"Paired Exchange\\" transplants annually. More than one-third of potential living kidney donors who want to donate their kidney to a friend or family member cannot because of blood type or antibody incompatibility. Historically, these donors would be turned away and the patient would lose the opportunity to receive a life- saving kidney transplant. KPD overcomes donor-recipient incompatibility by swapping kidneys between multiple donor-recipient pairs, and connecting them in longer chains, as well as taking an altruistic non-directed donor, and start chains of kidney transplants. What the NKR does is consolidate the incompatible pairs of donors and recipients from transplant centers all over the United States, into a single registry, and facilitate the transplant process. History The NKR was founded in 2007 by the Hil family, after their youngest daughter lost her kidney function at age ten. Both parents were ruled out from donating to their daughter because they were biologically incompatible. After many unsuccessful attempts to find a compatible donor through all of the kidney paired exchange programs in the United States, a compatible donor was found. After this transplant ordeal, the Hil family founded the National Kidney Registry to eliminate the problem of incompatible donors, by building a national kidney paired donation (KPD) program. The NKR organized its first swap on Valentine‚Äôs Day in 2008 at Cornell Medical Center in New York City. This first swap was a 3-deep chain that ended with a bridge donor who donated two months later, extending the chain to 5-deep. This chain was broken after the bridge donor reneged following many failed cross matches that required the donor to repeatedly go to the hospital for blood draws. The NKR‚Äôs second swap started with the shipment of a kidney from Cornell to UCLA School of Medicine. This was the first time a living donor kidney was shipped on a commercial airplane. This second chain crossed the country three times, facilitating eight total transplants at UCLA, Cornell, Stanford University School of Medicine, and California Pacific Medical Center Ultimately, this chain was broken when the bridge donor reneged. Based on these early experiences, many safe guards were implemented to reduce the risk of broken chains, which dropped the frequency of broken chains from 33% in 2008 to 2% in 2015. In 2012, the NKR broke the world record for the largest kidney swap by organizing a 30-deep chain involving 60 donors and recipients. This chain was started by Rick Ruzzamenti a 44-year-old from Riverside, California. The swap took four months to complete and involved 17 different transplant centers across 11 states. Three years later, on March 26, the next record breaking chain was set into motion by Kathy Hart, a 48-year-old attorney from Minneapolis. This swap took two months to complete and involved 26 different transplant centers. The NKR has facilitated 3214 kidney transplants, as of March 17, 2019. Key Innovations The rapid growth of KPD transplants in the United States has been driven by the following key NKR innovations. * Shipped Kidneys - The NKR was the first KPD program to utilize commercial airlines to ship kidneys. This allows kidney donors to undergo surgery near their home, eliminating the need to travel to a distant city to donate. This innovation has evolved to include the use of air charter jets and turboprop aircraft, on board couriers for connecting flights, charter flights combined with direct commercial moves, red-eye flights from West to East, and helicopter transport for shorter distances. * HLA coding standardization - In the startup period, the NKR experienced virtual cross match failure rates in excess of 50% because HLA coding schemes were not sufficiently standardized in the United States. The NKR implemented a standardized HLA coding scheme and forced the identification of more antigen and antibody data such as DP, Bw, Cw, DQ and DQA. This refinement and expansion of HLA data increased the virtual cross match accuracy from less than 50% to greater than 95% allowing more patients to get transplanted in a shorter period of time. * Finance & contracting - In late 2009, a 3-deep cluster being organized by the NKR fell apart the day before the swap was scheduled to commence because the hospitals in the swap could not agree on how to pay each other for the donor surgeries. Not only did this swap fall apart, but the last minute cancellation was the catalyst for a broken chain as the bridge donor for this cluster eventually withdrew. In response to this and prior financial challenges, the NKR assembled a team of finance experts from member centers and developed a financial model that would eliminate these challenges. Once the financial model was agreed upon by all member centers, the NKR created a universal ‚Äúcenter to center agreement‚Äù that would allow any member center to ship a kidney to, or accept a kidney from, another member center. * GPS tracking - In 2010, the NKR implemented the first GPS tracking systems used for shipping organs in the United States. After several near misses including a case where a kidney was off-loaded from an ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù midnight red-eye flight out of LAX (Los Angeles International Airport), the NKR made GPS tracking mandatory for all kidney shipments. In this case, the kidney sat in the baggage storage area for approximately two hours before it was discovered by an airline employee. An emergency private jet was ordered and later departed Los Angeles at 4:00 AM. The kidney arrived in Philadelphia on time and was successfully transplanted. By 2015, the NKR was the largest user of GPS tracking systems in the United States for organ shipments. * Simultaneous Mutually Exclusive Loops and Chain (SMELAC) - KPD matching is characterized as an NP-Hard problem in computational complexity theory. There are several ways to approach the KPD matching problem. The NKR uses an exhaustive search algorithm with expert system selection logic based on the NKR Medical Board's match offer selection policy. The exhaustive search algorithm would require supercomputer resources if not for the NKR's use of donor preselect screening, which was patterned from brokerage industry limit orders and eliminates matches that will ultimately be declined. The initial NKR matching algorithm included only chain (Domino & NEAD) based matching for 2 deep chains. By 2009 the matching engine was extended to 3 deep chains, then 6 deep chains, then 12 deep chains. In 2010, stand alone loop matching was implemented along with an upgrade that accommodated 20 deep chains. In 2011, a major upgrade of the matching engine enabled Simultaneous Mutually Exclusive Loops and Chain (SMELAC) matching. The SMELAC algorithm allowed the NKR to determine if the utilization of a chain, a loop or both would be the best approach for any given match run. * Repairing real-time swap failures - A real-time swap failure occurs when a swap falls apart after one or more donor surgeries have begun, leaving a patient, whose donor has already donated, without a kidney. Real-time swap failures can occur when a donor surgery must be aborted due to previously undetected donor medical conditions and when a recipient reacts badly to the surgery after the surgery has started. The NKR's historical statistics indicate that a real time-swap failure occurs once every 200 - 300 transplants. Out of the 7 real-time swap failures that the NKR experienced by the end of 2015, all patients that were initially left without a kidney when the swap failed, received a kidney within 1 ‚Äì 6 months. Chain end donors and non-directed donors are the only way to recover from a real- time swap failure. The NKR has been able to quickly repair swap failures because of the large number of chains it starts each year including 83 chains in 2015. * Center Liquidity Contribution (CLC) Program ‚Äì Similar to a frequent flyer program, the CLC Program rewards transplant centers that bring 'O' donors to the exchange and provides an incentive for centers to not withhold 'O' NDDs and favorable blood type pairs (e.g. 'A' patient with an 'O' paired donor) from the NKR in order to facilitate local swaps. The CLC program was implemented in 2014 after 6 consecutive years of unabated growth in the NKR unmatched pool. After the CLC program was implemented, the NKR pool size peaked at 306 unmatched pairs and began consistently trending down, dropping below 200 unmatched pairs by 2018. Even with the declining pool size, the number of NKR transplants continued to increase, reducing the median wait time to under two months with the greatest reduction realized for ‚ÄòO‚Äô patients with ‚ÄòA‚Äô paired donors. This unprecedented dynamic was contrary to all simulations and academic publications which hypothesized that KPD pool sizes would continue to grow over time as high PRA patient and unfavorable blood type combination pairs accumulated in the pool. * Exploratory cross matching - Exploratory cross matching for KPD was pioneered by Dr. Adam Bingaman at the Methodist Specialty & Transplant Hospital to test for HLA compatibility in advance of initiating a swap. In 2013, the NKR adopted this approach in a multi-center environment to test donor, patient compatibility before a match is offered. Although NKR's adoption of exploratory cross matching helped a few highly sensitized patients get transplanted and reduced the rate of swap failures due to unacceptable cross match results, it was not until the implementation of donor blood cryo-preservation in 2015 that exploratory cross matching yielded substantial results. * Cryo-preserved donor blood - Human blood can be cryo-preserved and stored indefinitely in liquid nitrogen freezers at a temperature of -196 ¬∞C to facilitate rapid cross matching without requiring fresh blood from donors. In 2015, the NKR created a national lab service, so cryo-preserved donor blood could be stored for donors across NKR's 70+ member centers. The implementation of the cryo-preservation service allowed NKR centers to dramatically reduce the time to complete a cross match from 1‚Äì2 weeks to 1‚Äì2 days, facilitating more transplants for highly sensitized patients and reducing swap failures caused by unacceptable cross matches. Donor blood cryo-preservation also reduces the number of times a donor needs to have blood drawn for cross matching, making paired exchange more convenient for donors. * Advanced Donation Program - The Advanced Donation Program (ADP) is a paired exchange separated in time. This program allows living donors to donate their kidney before their Intended Recipient receives a kidney. Some ADP donors have donated only a few weeks before their Intended Recipients received a kidney. Some ADP donors are donating 10‚Äì20 years before their Intended Recipient expects to need a transplant, and some ADP donors are donating in the hope that their Intended Recipient will never need a transplant. Garet Hil, Founder of the NKR, donated his kidney through the ADP program in 2015 which initiated a swap that facilitated 8 transplants. Most long term ADP cases involve older donors who want to donate on behalf of their intended recipient before they become too old to donate. * Living Donor Insurance &Support; \\\\- In 2017 the NKR was the first KPD organization to provide donor insurance and other important donor support benefits to donors participating in paired exchange. In addition to the donor insurance the NKR also provides all donors legal support, donor complication coverage, donor kidney transplant prioritization, automated screening and history and 5 follow up surveys. * Remote Donation - In 2017, the NKR launched the Remote Donation Network (RDN). The RDN allows someone who wants to donate a kidney to a friend or family member in a distant city without requiring the donor to travel to the transplant center in the distant city. Remote donation utilizes proven logistics systems pioneered in kidney swaps by the National Kidney Registry over the past decade to safely transport the kidney from the donor‚Äôs local hospital to the transplant center in the distant city. Research has proven that shipping a live kidney for transplant has no significant impact on patient outcomes. Media Coverage The NKR's innovations have generated significant media coverage including a front page story in the New York Times. and nationally televised interviews by Katie Couric with the CBS Evening News. Diane Sawyer from ABC News, and Byron Pitts at Nightline.

The magazine, which began publishing in 2011, is the first in Thailand to specifically address the interests of the country's LGBT community, and to seek to represent LGBT views in wider Thai society. The magazine decided therefore to launch Thailand's first-ever LGBT Festival, as LGBT people and issues have already gained acceptance in Thai society for many years, and several other countries in the East Asian region, which sometimes record less legal acceptance of LGBT issues than Thailand, such as Indonesia (which has held Asia's largest LGBT film festival, Q! Film Festival, every year since 2002), The Philippines (which holds the annual Pride International Film Festival), Cambodia and Myanmar, already have well-established LGBT film festivals. The magazine argues that, with Thailand's enactment of the 2015 Gender Equality Act, discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is no longer tolerated in Thai society. Despite the advances made over many years, the magazine believes that the LGBT community is not always portrayed in a positive light in Thai films and other forms of media, with certain stereotypes still prevalent whenever movies, in particular, address gender diversity. The magazine believes that the Festival will therefore help to provide a more realistic and varied view of the LGBT community. The first film to open the first Festival in 2015 was \\"How To Win At Checkers (Every Time)\\", a film about two brothers, one gay, set around a military draft day in Thailand. The 2015 Festival lasted for 10 days, with 15 films from 12 countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, China, South Korea, the United States and Europe. Sanchai Chotirosseranee, deputy director of Film Archive and partner of the BGLFF 2015, claims that it has been \\"a long journey\\" for the LGBT community in Thailand. In the 1955 Thai film, Chua Fah Din Salai, the Thai male comedian, Lor Tok, was shown dressing up as a woman and dancing with another male character. From then until now, the portrayal of what were dismissively referred to as 'katoey' meant that LGBT characters were presented as comic relief in films and soap operas, and had become the norm in Thai society. The magazine is keen to ensure that such portrayals are brought to an end, and that members of the LGBT community can be fully accepted and respected as equals.

One person was killed and seven others were injured.  Shooting  On January 30, police responded to a brawl that broke out between rival motorcycle clubs inside the National Western Complex, located near the Denver Coliseum just north of Interstate 70. The Complex was hosting the 38th Annual Colorado Motorcycle Exposition, where motorcycle clubs across the country had gathered, including the Bandidos Motorcycle Club and Hells Angels. The Iron Order Motorcycle Club had 16 of its members in attendance at the expo, and only stayed for an hour. In an attempt to leave the expo, the group left down a flight of stairs near the basement of the complex, where several Mongols had booths selling T-shirts. Three Iron Order members were separated and confronted by a much larger group of around 30 members of the Mongols Motorcycle Club, a Mongol challenged them and told them to leave. A Mongol approached them and knocked a beer out of the hands of an African American Iron Order member while yelling a racial slur at him. A fist and knife fight broke out at 12:48 p.m., with several Iron Order members being severely beaten and stabbed. In response an Iron Order member who works for the Colorado Department of Corrections, pulled out his gun and fired one shot into the ceiling. A Mongol charged at him but was gunned down and injured. Another Mongol attempted to tackle the gunman as he fled up the stairs, but was struck and fatally injured. An Iron Order member was handcuffed and taken into custody Saturday following the brawl.  Victims  According to the medical examiner's report, seven people were injured. Three remain in critical condition, three are stable, and one other person suffered lesser injuries. The sole fatality was identified as 46-year-old Victor Mendoza, a Mongol who was shot in the chest.  Aftermath  The emergency room at Rocky Mountain Regional Trauma Center, where the injured were taken, was placed on lockdown by the Denver Police Department out of fear of the conflict spreading. Dr. Kevin McVaney of the Denver Health Medical Center said three were in critical condition, suffering gunshot wounds, while the six others were reported as being stable. The two gravely injured were said to be both members of the Mongols and Iron Order. As a result of the shooting, the second day of the motorcycle expo was cancelled. The Denver Police Department has released few details of the incident because of the indictment of its fellow officer in the Iron Order Motorcycle Club, according to an attorney for the Mongols Motorcycle Club. The Iron Order is predominately made up of ex-military and law enforcement officers. According to the Associated Press, the Iron Order formed in 2004 and is one of the fastest growing motorcycle clubs in the U.S.  See also  * 2015 Waco shootout  References  Category:2016 in Colorado Category:21st century in Denver Category:Crimes in Colorado Category:Deaths by firearm in Colorado Category:January 2016 crimes in the United States Category:Organized crime conflicts in the United States Category:Outlaw motorcycle club conflicts Category:Mongols Motorcycle Club ","title":"National Western Complex shootout"},{"id":"49274602","text":"Srdjan Jovanovic Weiss (born 1967) is a Serbian architect, artist and theorist living and working in New York. He was an Ex-Head of Research of Herzog & De Meuron Architects, co-founder of School of Missing Studies for spatial research and founder of NAO.NYC for spatial design at all scales needed based in New York. Jovanovic Weiss was born in Subotica and lived in Novi Sad and Belgrade until 1995. He then moved to the United States for graduate studies at Harvard University. After two years at Harvard studying with Richard Gluckman, Jacques Herzog and Rem Koolhaas, Jovanovic Weiss moved to New York where he started practicing architecture with Richard Gluckman and Robert Wilson. In 1998 he won the Second Prize in the 2G Competition to expand Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion in Barcelona and soon after opened his own art & architectural practice called Normal Group for Architecture with a partner. This collaboration lasted until 2003 when Jovanovic Weiss founded NAO.NYC (Normal Architecture Office), a collaborative studio for design of architecture, cities and exhibitions and a successor of Normal Group for Architecture based in New York City. He also co-founded SMS (School of Missing Studies), international art & architecture group for studying cities marked or undergoing abrupt transition. His writing using epistemology as method started with articles for Akcelerator magazine, then as thesis for Harvard Project on the City. Finally he defended his long time research on Balkanization at Goldsmiths College Centre for Research Architecture. Jovanovic Weiss's theoretical work is mostly known for analysis of Balkan cities in the aftermath of war and crisis in Yugoslavia during 1990s. He coined the term Turbo Architecture and contributed to understanding the geo-political process termed Balkanization and its defining effects on newly emerging capital cities after the fall of Yugoslavia. Jovanovic Weiss defines Balkanization as a bottom-up geo-political process that new capital cities of new countries go through to assert their own urban distinction and character among competing new capital cities and against hegemonic forces of globalization. Jovanovic Weiss authored books that include \\"Socialist Architecture: The Reappearing Act [ The Green Box, Berlin, 2017], Socialist Architecture: The Vanishing Act (JRP Ringier, 2012, with Armin Linke) and Almost Architecture (Merz & Akademie Solitude, 2006). He edited the books: Evasions of Power: On the Architecture of Adjustment (Slought, Ed. 2008) and Lost Highway Expedition (School of Missing Studies, Ed. 2007). His work has been published in the books 100 Architects 10 Critics by Phaidon, Harvard Project on the City: Shopping, Did Someone Say Participate?, Networked Cultures: Parallel Architectures and the Politics of Space, Forensis: The Architecture of Public Truth, Atlas of Transformation, Beyond: Scenarios and Speculations, Concurrent Urbanism, Nationalities Papers and Inhabiting Geometry: Anne Tyng as well as magazines and journals such as Harvard Design Magazine, Cabinet Magazine, Perspecta, Akcelerator, Abitare, Domus, DaNS, Architectural Design, Oris, Thresholds et al. Weiss curated and designed exhibitions in New York of visionaries from the past: Lina Bo Bardi (at Columbia GSAPP), Yona Frieddman (at The Drawing Center) and Anne Tyng (at ICA Philadelphia and Graham Foundation, Chicago). His most recent exhibition on Hannes Meyer and the city of Birobidzhan has been exhibited in Birobidzhan Philharmonic in Far East Russia. The exhibition: ArchiLeaks, shown during October and November of 2019 at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Skopje, Northern Macedonia marks Jovanovic Weiss' new and epistemological approach to mine data from errors in spatial knowledge. Jovanovic Weiss previously collaborated with Richard Gluckman and Herzog & de Meuron Architects and artists Jenny Holzer, Anne Tyng, Yona Friedman, Eyal Weizman, Marjetica Potrƒç, Yevgheniy Fiks and Robert Wilson.

Title to the West End property was transferred to Emily Helen Elizabeth Turton, Thomas' wife, in mid-1903, and Thomas Turton is listed as resident in Stagpole Street in the 1904 Queensland Post Office Directory. The original structure is thought to have comprised two large rooms divided by a central hallway, surrounded by verandahs, with a detached kitchen at the rear. Later the rear verandah was enclosed and an additional wing added. Wolverton was one of only five Federation-era timber houses with a distinctive multi-gabled roofline, built in Townsville. One of these has been demolished, another shifted to a rural site; the three (including Wolverton) remaining in Townsville have been refurbished. Thomas and Emily Turton resided at Wolverton until , after which the house appears to have been rented out. Title was transferred from Mrs Turton in 1925, and the property passed through a variety of owners and lessees in subsequent years. It is understood the house was moved sideways in the 1930s to create a vacant adjacent block and in the 1950s it was divided into two flats. In the 1980s Wolverton was restored to its pre-1950 appearance.  Description  Dining room, Wolverton Parlour, Wolverwton Wolverton is a modest, single-storeyed timber residence, high set on concrete stumps, surrounded by a modern tropical garden of ferns, palms, shade trees and lawn. A semi-circular driveway is a feature of the front yard together with the original concrete fence foundation and posts. The building has a complex hipped and gabled roof. There are two small symmetrically placed gables at the front of the house and a gabled frontispiece which extends through the front verandah. A large square ventilator is centrally placed on the ridge of the corrugated iron roof. The verandah, with dowel balustrading and lattice screening, extends around three sides of the building. The front porch is decorated with simple fretwork and a wooden arch over the front steps. The single-skin timber external walls have exposed framing. Boards have also been used throughout the house on the internal walls and ceilings.

Mexico has a long history of making rag dolls, but the ones known popularly from their appearance nationally, especially in tourist venues may date back only to the 1970s, part of a project to enhance income opportunities for Otomi women in the Amealco municipality. Although Amealco is strongly connected to these dolls, their making is not limited and has spread into various states, with some variations in dress and appearance, but always keeping with wide faces and hair generously braided with ribbons.  Significance  Various types of rag dolls have been made, but the most common have smiling faces, indigenous-like dress, and hair braided with ribbons. They have been called \\"Marias,\\" but are more often simply called \\"rag dolls\\" (mu√±ecas de trapo). Ranging in size from three to forty five centimeters and sometimes more, the dolls can be found for sale just about anywhere in Mexico, especially in tourist venues. Because of this, they have become a symbol of Mexico for foreigners and have been shipped outside of the country, primarily to the United States, Canada and South America.  History  A completely handstiched version of the doll Rag dolls of various types have a long history in Mexico, especially since the colonial period. The making of dolls from old bits of clothing is still common among Mexico's indigenous populations, often using clothing that had been worn by some member of the family, and made by mother or grandmother. However, the \\"Maria\\" dolls most likely originated in southern Queretaro, especially the municipality of Amealco, a heavily Otomi (√ëha√±h√º) area. According to Queretaro state authorities, the Marias originate from the communities of Santiago Mexquititlan and San Ildefonso Tultepec in the municipality of Amealco de Bonfil. They may date back to only the 1970s, when Guadalupe Rivera, daughter of muralist Diego Rivera, started a program designed to help the local economy, in particular that to the local women, who had been limited to selling candy on the street in cities. She taught the local people her style of making rag dolls, which originally include the use of buttons so that the dolls would have movable arms and legs, but since then, the design has been modified to the current version. However, the Mazahua people of neighborhing Michoacan state have also laid claim to the dolls. The dress of the dolls is similar to that of both the Mazahua and the Otomi of this area. The popularity of the dolls surged around the same time of the popularity of a movie personality called La India Maria, whose dress was similar to that of the Mazahua and took away some of the stigma of an indigenous look.  The dolls and Amealco  The dolls are strongly tied to Amealco, where seventy percent of the indigenous population or about 3,000 people are dedicated to the making of these and another type of rag doll, which accounts for at least part of their income. Many are self taught or taught through friends or family. Amealco has the first museum in Mexico dedicated solely to traditional handcrafted dolls, located in the town center in a building from the 19th century. The town is also home to the annual Handcrafted Doll Festival (Festival de la Mu√±eca Artesanal) held in November. The town now holds an annual national contest for handcrafted dolls.

Because of their popularity, their manufacture either by handcrafting or more industrial methods expanded to other parts of Queretaro, into Guanajuato (especially among Otomi populations there) and then into other states. This expansion has led to variations in the doll's dress and sometimes appearance, such as skin tone.  Authenticity  The most authentic of the dolls are made by hand and/or sewing machine in homes or small workshops, mostly by women but sometimes men and children participate. Most of the materials are commercially-made, such as fabric and buttons, but the most traditional filling is a local fiber called guata. Although the ribbon-adorned version with the wide face is by far the most popular, other variations have come about such as dolls representing Frida Kahlo and those made with more ecological materials. In 2014, the state of Queretaro filed paperwork to seek \\"denomination of origin\\" for the dolls to have only those made in southern Queretaro as authentic, but this was denied, principally because the dolls are primarily made with non-local materials.

Taking over three years to construct, it opened in 2015 at a cost of 110 million euros, and is considered to be the world's most expensive cable car installation. Facilities From the cablecar base station at Entr√®ves (at an altitude of 1,300 meters above sea level), the Skyway Monte Bianco rises to a mid-way station at Pavillon Du Mont-Frety at an altitude of 2,173 meters. It takes six minutes to reach this point, during which time the 80-person cabin makes one complete rotation, giving visitors all-round views into the Aosta valley and along both Val Veny and Val Ferret, as well as improved access to the Italian side of the Mont Blanc massif and a link via the Vall√©e Blanche Aerial Tramway to the Aiguille du Midi, from where a separate cable car descends to the town of Chamonix in France. The half-way station of the Pavillon contains a restaurant and conference centre, plus one of the highest botanical gardens in the region, containing some 900 alpine plant species, as well as access to a network of trails. Visitors can continue upwards via a second cable car which also slowly revolves, and takes ten minutes to reach Punta Helbronner (known as the Eagles Nest) at an altitude of 3,466 meters. Tourist facilities and scenic viewpoints provide close views of Mont Blanc, Aiguille d'Entreves and the Vallee Blanche, but also views further out towards the Matterhorn, Monte Rosa and Gran Paradiso. A tunnel and lift system provide access from the cable car terminus to the Torino Hut, a high- altitude mountain refuge offering accommodation both to tourists and to climbers intending to access the mountaineering routes of the range. Construction The Skyway Monte Bianco was designed by architect, Carlo Rossi, took four years to construct, and involved complete rebuilding of the Point Helbronner terminus at a cost of 110 million euros. The cable cars were manufactured by Doppelmayr Cable Car and the top station was engineered so as to minimise energy consumption, and includes solar panels and highly efficient insulation in order to bring it close to a zero-energy building. The horizontal tunnel and vertical well which now give access to Pointe Helbronner, the Torino Hut and the Vallee Blanche, also serve to anchor the cable car station into the rock. The vertical lift shaft is a 5 metre wide well, approximately 70 m in depth. To avoid damage to the structural integrity of the mountain, explosives were not used during the tunnel's construction. Instead, a series of small holes were drilled, each 40 cm diameter, using a technique known as raise boring. The tunnel and vertical shaft together provide firm anchorage to the cable car equipment, each cable of which has to be capable of carrying loads of over 100 tons. The base of the vertical shaft also houses water tanks for fire-fighting purposes. Permission to construct the new cable car included an agreement to remove the old cable car infrastructure. The full cost of the development, when all the associated infrastructure is included, was 138 million euros, making it the world's most expensive cable car installation at the time of its opening in 2015. The cableway opened in 23 June 2015, and was much celebrated by the Italians, but ignored by the French. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi officially opened the new cable car system, and was presented with a golden ice axe by regional president, Augusto Rollandin on their arrival at the summit station on Pointe Helbronner. Tourism impact A corresponding, but much older cable car on the northern side of the Mont Blanc massif, which ascends from Chamonix to the Aiguille du Midi, attracts around 500,000 people per annum, with an annual turnover of 16 million euros. Previously the older Funivia Monte Bianco attracted 100,000 visitors per annum, but the new Skyway Monte Bianco was forecast to attract some 300,000 visitors per year. Concerns were expressed by environmental organisations, both before and after the Skyway's construction. These centred around the 'disproportionate scale' and very high impact of the development on the mountain environment, as well as the commoditisation of the high alpine environment. View across Mont Blanc massif from Skyway Monte Bianco's panoramic terrace on Punta Helbronner Film location In 2016, Skyway Monte Bianco was used as the setting for an action-adventure sequence in a major comedy spy movie, Kingsman: The Golden Circle.

It was built in 1885 by Peter Dean. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 June 1999.  History  West End Hotel was constructed in 1885 by Townsville builder Peter Dean, who was also the first licensee. Early settlement in Townsville spread along the beach in the present North Ward area, with the commercial centre located along the bank of Ross Creek (Flinders Street). As the town developed, settlement spread further along Flinders Street to the area which became known as West End. By 1868 the West End Cemetery had been established in the area and by 1878 the Carriers Arms Hotel, a soap works, a foundry, commercial buildings and a large estate held by Frederick Ashton, were located at West End. By the time West End Hotel was constructed in 1885, Townsville had grown to a thriving supply town for the pastoralists and miners in North Queensland. It had a port and was connected to Charters Towers and Hughenden by rail. The West End Hotel was constructed in 1885 by Townsville builder and first licensee, Peter Dean. The hotel was built on Ingham Road opposite the Pastoral and Agricultural Society Showgrounds and close to the Racecourse. Located on the edge of the township, the hotel was on the road which led over Hervey's Range to the stations in the interior, a location which made it the first point of call for travellers arriving from the bush. The two storeyed building was constructed of brick with a concrete floor throughout the ground level. On the ground floor there was a bar, three sitting rooms, a large dining room and a billiard room with a large, new table. Upstairs there was a large parlour, eight bedrooms and a bathroom. The timber balustraded balcony overlooked the showgrounds and the mountains to the south and west. Special accommodation was provided at the rear for race horses. There were ten secure and well ventilated loose boxes as well as ordinary stabling for travellers' horses. The proximity of the hotel to the race track ensured that the accommodation was full during the racing season. By 1886 the showgrounds were in regular use for sports meetings and the hotel was the venue for the presentation of prizes in 1886. It was also the terminus for the West End Omnibus Line which travelled between Tattersalls Hotel, Flinders Street East and West End Hotel. Townsville continued to expand with settlement spreading along the new, south western road to the goldfields at Ravenswood and Charters Towers. Commercial development along Charters Towers Road meant that West End was no longer a centre of business. Suburban development did not spread beyond West End until after World War II although the hotel continued to provide a service for travellers reaching town from the west and north west. The hotel would have been very busy during WWII because of its location close to an Australian Construction Corp camp at West End Cemetery. Although there are still rooms for rent, the hotel does not cater for the travelling public any more. However, it has continued to be a well patronised hotel, particularly during Townsville Show Week. The building has been damaged by three cyclones since it was constructed and, while it has been restored, some components have been changed or lost including recent changes to the profile of the street awning.  Description  The building lies on the corner of Ingham Road and Jane Street. It comprises a 2-storey rectangular building with a splayed corner, constructed in brick with timber floors and a corrugated iron hipped roof. There is a detached single storey rectangular building to the rear (the kitchen) constructed in brick with a corrugated iron hipped roof. There are extensive modern mono-pitch extensions to the rear of the building which link to the detached kitchen block. The main building has a 2-storey timber verandah and awning to Ingham Road and Jane Street frontages, partly enclosed at first floor level with recent glazing and lattice work. It has a decorative timber balustrade of a \\"union jack\\" design. The awning has timber posts with a simple timber slat curved valance between each post which is a recent addition to the awning. The roofs of the verandah and awning are of corrugated iron. The brick work is laid in English bond. The original red bricks have been painted over. The ground floor front elevation has an asymmetrical design with four original double timber and glazed casement doors with fanlights over to the west of the principal access door, and two modern solid timber doors with fanlights to the east. The splayed corner of the building has a modern timber door, while the side elevation to Jane Street has two modern solid timber doors with fanlights over. The west end elevation is of solid brick, while the rear elevation has three door openings and a window. The first floor front elevation is also asymmetrical with four original timber and glazed casement doors with fanlights over to the west of the main public access door onto the verandah, and two original timber and glazed casement doors with fanlights over to the east. The enclosed side elevation was not inspected. Early photographs indicate a casement door in the splayed corner and two casement doors to the side. The west slide elevation has a single window, while the rear elevation has a door blocked door opening and six windows opening with modern louvre glazing. The detached kitchen building has three door openings and a window to the south front elevation, and a substantial chimney to the west side elevation. Internally the ground floor comprises a main access hall providing access to the staircase and rooms either side. To the west are two full depth rooms, linked by a large opening in the dividing wall, now used as pool rooms. To the east is a bar, with a comparatively modern u-shaped bar fitting. To the rear of the main building are a number of single storey mono-pitched rooms, comprising bar and kitchen accommodation, and toilets. The timber staircase is of a simple design with a single run to a middle landing and a return run to the first floor landing. It has simple timber slat balusters. The first floor comprises the main access hall giving public access to the verandah, and until recently to a first floor rear extension (toilets) which has been demolished. To the west is a central corridor giving access to three bedrooms on either side. The doors are of timber with four panels. To the east is the residential quarters of the manager. This appears to have been formed by adapting the original four bedrooms off a central corridor. Two of the bedrooms and the corridor have been opened up to form a kitchen/lounge and while the others remain in use as bedrooms. The enclosed verandah was not inspected. The walls and ceilings have been covered over at a later date with sheeting and battens. While there have clearly been changes, the overall form, design and interior layout of the building survives. It retains a majority of original timber and glazed casement doors to the ground and first floor, and other joinery details.  Heritage listing  West End Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 June 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Built in 1885, it demonstrates the town limits at that time, and its location has a strong association with the Showground and railway line. The building is important as a premises which has operated as an hotel since 1885 and as such has a strong association with the growth and expansion of Townsville. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The building is important as a rare surviving example of an intact balconied hotel in North Queensland, very few hotels survive with their balconies intact and of these fewer survive with an intact 1880s balustrade.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description The farmstead is located on a high strip of land located between High Lake on the west and a wetland, Cunningham Slough, on the east. The historic district is made up of ten contributing elements. with a The seven contributing buildings include the house, barn, blacksmith shop complex, cook/wash house, chicken coop, hog house, and sheep barn. The three contributing structures are the cob shed, wood shed, and com crib. The house was a log structure built in 1870 by Peder N. Brugjeld and his son Peder N. Peterson. Clapboard siding covers the exterior. A stone addition was built onto it in 1895 by Peder N. Peterson. The barn was built sometime between the 1870s and 1890. The rest of the buildings and structures date from the early to mid-20th century, with the exception of the corn crib, which is from the late 19th century to early 20th century. The historic district reflects Norwegian-American settlement, and the importance of blacksmithing as a commercial/industrial feature of the rural economy. Peder and Gjertrud Brugjeld and their six children left the Brugjeld farm near Balestrand, Norway in 1848. They sailed on the Dorothea to the United States. After their arrival, they lived in Dane County, Wisconsin before they settled in Emmet County. Four generations of the Peterson family owned the farm until 1996 when Maynard Peterson donated it to Emmet County. The farm and surrounding are maintained and operated by the Emmet County Conservation Department and the Emmet County Conservation Foundation as an interpretive site and as a historic museum.

Mainly an attacking midfielder, he can play as a winger. Early life Born in Brussels to Zambian parents, Musonda started his career at Anderlecht's youth setup. In 2011, aged only 15, he was already linked to the likes of Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea. Club career Chelsea On 11 June 2012, Musonda joined Chelsea, along with his two older brothers, after the club previously agreed to pay a \\"compensation fee\\" to Anderlecht. On 24 October 2013, he signed a professional contract with the club, after already being a regular with the under-18s. On 5 March 2015, after already being a regular with the club's under-21 team, Musonda signed a contract extension until 2019. He attracted interest from French clubs Monaco and Olympique de Marseille in the summer, after impressing in both UEFA Youth League and FA Youth Cup winning campaigns, but nothing came of it. After not making any first team appearance during the first half of the 2015‚Äì16 season, Musonda asked to leave due to lack of opportunities in December. In January 2016, he rejected a loan move from Standard Li√®ge. =Loan to Betis= Burnley at the Stamford Bridge, August 2017. On 29 January 2016, Musonda joined La Liga side Real Betis on loan until the end of the season, without the option of making the move permanent. He made his professional debut on 7 February, starting in a 1‚Äì0 home win against Valencia, where he also was awarded Man of the Match. Six days later, Musonda scored his first professional goal in a 2‚Äì2 draw at Deportivo de La Coru√±a. On 22 June, Musonda's loan at Real Betis was extended for the 2016‚Äì17 campaign. On 1 January 2017, after only making one start in the eight appearances Musonda made under manager Gus Poyet, the Belgian returned to Chelsea. =2016‚Äì17 and 2017‚Äì18 seasons= In December 2016, Musonda appeared to have returned to Chelsea after being seen training with the first- team squad, with Chelsea presumably terminating his loan spell at Real Betis. On 1 January 2017, it was confirmed by Real Betis that Chelsea had recalled the Belgian. With manager Antonio Conte unsure whether Musonda was to stay with the Blues or be loaned out, interest arose from many clubs around Europe, including Roma. However, after the conclusion of the January transfer window, Antonio Conte confirmed in a post-match press conference preceding Chelsea's 1‚Äì1 away draw with Liverpool, that Nathan Ak√©, Kenedy and Musonda would be staying at the club for the rest of the 2016‚Äì17 campaign. Musonda made his debut for Chelsea on 6 August 2017 in the 2017 FA Community Shield against Arsenal, coming on as a substitute after 84 minutes. He made his first starting appearance for the club in an EFL Cup tie against Nottingham Forest, scoring the third goal in a 5‚Äì1 victory on 20 September 2017. =Loan to Celtic= On 29 January 2018, Musonda joined Celtic on an 18-month loan deal. He made his debut the following day in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Heart of Midlothian at Celtic Park. The loan agreement was terminated in May 2018, as Musonda had not received sufficient playing time at Celtic. =Loan to Vitesse= Musonda then departed Chelsea once again, joining Eredivisie side Vitesse on a season-long loan from 31 August 2018 (transfer deadline day), having missed out on Chelsea's 23-man squad ahead of the Premier League season. Musonda then agreed to remain there on loan for a second season during the following July. International career Musonda is a Belgian international from under-15 to under-21 levels. Personal life Charly attended Richard Challoner School in New Malden. Musonda's older brothers, Lamisha and Tika were also youth graduates at Chelsea and Anderlecht. His father, also named Charles, was also a footballer who appeared mainly for Anderlecht, and was an international regular for Zambia.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 October 2008.  History  The Townsville Showground was established in 1882 by the North Queensland Pastoral and Agricultural Association (P & A Assoc.) which later became known as the Townsville Pastoral Agricultural and Industrial Association (TPA&I;). It remains in use as one of Queensland's premier showgrounds and continues to provide an important regional venue for the showcasing of North Queensland industrial, pastoral and agricultural products and businesses, and for athletics events and community and entertainment events. It retains a variety of structures erected between the mid 1890s and 1970s that have been important in the functioning of the showground. These include: exhibition halls, 1901 grandstand, show ring, poultry and livestock pavilions, a dairy, stabling and marshalling areas, gates, turnstiles, and Curley Bell stands. Encouraged by a boom in settlement due to an expansion of the pastoral and goldmining industry, and in response to the formation of the National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland in 1875 and up and coming inaugural Exhibition to be held in Brisbane in August 1876, Townsville's civic and business leaders called for the establishment of the North Queensland Pastoral and Agricultural Association (P & A Association), at a meeting held in June 1876. Before a suitable site could be secured, the first Townsville Show was held in 1880 with agricultural and pastoral products displayed in the Botanical Gardens reserve and industrial and horticultural exhibits at the School of Arts. From its inception, the Association was reflective of regional interests. In 1880, office bearers included country delegates from Hughenden, Lilliesmere, Towerhill, Woodstock, Herbert River, Charters Towers, Bluff Downs, Greenvale, Woodhouse, Mount Stuart, Dotswood, Dalrymple, Reedy Springs, Lyndhurst, Wandavale and Herbert River. In the late 1870s the P & A Association applied to the colonial government for 16 acres (6.47 ha) at West End to be set aside as a reserve for show purposes. In January 1881, a deed of grant was issued to the Association trustees for 10 acres (4.04 ha) of Crown Land to be reserved for a showground on Flinders Street West, later known as Ingham Road. At the time the new showground adjoined several reserves including the Defence Force Reserve, the Pound Reserve and the Manure Depot. This later provided room for expansion of the grounds as well as setting up establishing a long relationship between the defence force and Show Association in regards to usage of the defence drill hall for exhibition space. The first show was held at the new showground in 1882, and it was quickly realised by the P & A Association at the time that the area was an insufficient to service the showground events with no dedicated show exhibition space or to provide a flexible sporting venue for the growing community. As a result, the showgrounds were expanded in 1888 to take in the Manure Depot and the Pound Reserve covering a total area of over 30 acres (12.14 ha). Produce on display at the Townsville Show, circa 1896 From the beginning the Townsville showground precinct was a venue where the community could meet, showcase its pastoral and agricultural produce; introduce new agricultural ideas and technology; and provide a much anticipated meeting place for the community to gather, meet relatives, and socialise. Prominent North Queensland pastoralists and agriculturalists used the venue to showcase their horses, promote their interest in breeding stock and encourage future growth in the region. In addition to stud stock, exhibitions reflected the major influence of wool, timber reserves, coffee, horticulture and minerals indicative of the pastoral, agricultural, and mining industries throughout the region. It also provided an outlet where the products of women's labour associated within the domestic environment were exhibited including displays of cookery, needlework, millinery, arts and taxonomy. In addition children were encouraged to enter events which displayed their prowess in the execution of schoolwork. Events attracted both professional and amateur participants and contributors travelled from west beyond Hughenden to take advantage of the opportunity to restock provisions, network and get together. Between Shows sporting groups took advantage of the broad even grounds with the Townsville Rugby Football Club playing regular games from July 1889. In 1890, keeping with the principles to hold a premier regional event, the P & A Assoc. passed a motion to select country judges for the pastoral classes from around Queensland rather than select locally to ensure that the events retained a competitive edge. Successful competitors with prize exhibits from the Townsville Show were forwarded by the P & A Assoc. Committee for entry into the Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland Show (RNA) in Brisbane. The RNA encouraged the Townsville exhibits to be showcased at the Brisbane Exhibition, to attract interest and investment in the north. Some events such as horse competitions worked on an accumulated points system across various regional events and shows. Those with the highest points at the end of the Townsville Show were able to enter into the RNA competitions. Freight concessions to assist the Show circuit came from a range of transport providers including the shipping company Howard Smith & Sons, and the Railway Department provided free livestock exhibit freightage for Show exhibits from and between local and regional show centres and for Show Champions sent to the RNA. An increasingly strong attendance and event participation at the Townsville Show resulted in a shortage of exhibition space. Up until this point the exhibitions were held in the Drill Hall named the \\"Norman Hall\\", but this remained unsatisfactory as it was not always available and the alternative arrangement of using the School of Arts separated exhibition contributors from the showgrounds. In 1891 the Society committee borrowed bank finance for the erection of purpose-built exhibition buildings and pavilions. However, the upgrading of the showground coincided with a severe national economic downturn. This, combined with a devastating drought in North Queensland, impacted so greatly on the regional community that the Show was cancelled for the next two years due to lack of funds as well as exhibits. In order to boost attendances following the recommencement of the Show in 1894, the Association made a request to the Railway Department to expand its benevolent contribution and run Show excursion trains from Hughenden to Townsville and Ravenswood to Townsville. It was noted: > \\"District residents took the opportunity to visit the town on these festive > occasions and in a very short time were prominent amongst the successful > exhibitors. Continued staunch support from the surrounding districts has > played a big part in the success of the Townsville Pastoral and Agricultural > Society Association.\\" As other pastoral and agricultural associations were established in emerging North Queensland towns in the late nineteenth century, the name of the Townsville-based association was changed to the Townsville Pastoral and Agricultural (TPA & I) Association. A circuit pattern of show days was developed in consultation with towns across North Queensland, culminating in the Townsville show held each year in July. Goodwill between local businesses and the TPA& I Association provided an excellent reciprocal arrangement with many businesses contributing substantial event prizes which encouraged good participant rates. In turn, businesses benefited economically from the free advertising in the months leading up to the Show. Co-operation between local businesses, event organisers and the TPA& I Association extended well beyond the gazetted Show day with the Townsville Showground precinct used regularly for sports and athletics as well as for trotting events. Following the devastation of Cyclone Sigma in January 1896, a major thrust of expansion and upgrade to the showgrounds was proposed including the provision of 30 new iron cattle pens, enlargement of the ring (which also included plans for the addition of an outer show ring) and a 400-seat grandstand. While exhibition pavilions and dairy and livestock facilities had continually improved since the first show, the lack of a grandstand did not reflect the prestige of the Townsville Show. In particular, since a new grandstand was planned to be constructed at the Cluden Racecourse in late 1896, discussions had been underway to make provision for one at the Showground. Tunbridge & Tunbridge, one of Townsville's principal architectural firms and designer of the Cluden Racecourse grandstand, were requested to submit an estimate for the upgrade. The Tunbridge brothers (Walter Howard and Oliver Allan) had entered into partnership in Townsville in 1887, and soon developed a substantial North Queensland architectural practice with offices in Charters Towers and later Rockhampton. Tunbridge and Tunbridge designed many Townsville hotels, including the Metropole (1887), Victoria Park (1896), Lowth's (1897), Victoria Bridge (1900), Empire (1901), Sovereign (1904) and Carriers Arms (1906). Over the course of 1897 discussions were held as to the best grandstand location for superior Show ring views. A totalizator was also planned to be incorporated into the structure to service the trotting events. Tenders for the grandstand were called in February 1901. The grandstand, in length and deep was to be erected on a mound long and deep. The gentle rise to the building was designed to have no steps with seats rising in tiers from the ground in front of the grandstand. In the centre was a stairwell leading down below the stand and giving access to the luncheon room below. A bar, kitchen, lavatories and rest room were accommodated in this sub-floor. Bricks were used to support the foundations and retaining wall of the building with timber and iron used for the superstructure. To make good use of the prevailing breeze it was proposed the building face east-west and incorporate louvres on the top tier to the roof. Incorporating a decorative balustrade, the structure was designed to accommodate up to 1000 persons. With the addition of a new grandstand, the Townsville Showground was complete as a dedicated showground facility offering numerous exhibition halls, substantial cattle yards, horse and dairy buildings and poultry sheds with the show ring neatly encompassed by a white picket fence. In early 1903 Cyclone Leonta crossed the coast causing widespread devastation to Townsville including the showground. Three months later in a show of public unity the community held a grand opening of the Show to welcome the officiating Vice Regal party including the Queensland Governor Sir Herbert Chermside and his wife Lady Chermside, and Queensland Premier Hon. Robert Philp. The official party and record crowd of over 3500 people were entertained by a display of horse events staged by station owners taking the prime opportunity to show their purpose bred remounts with a view of securing trade overseas. In 1913 the Showgrounds grounds were again the central venue where the community could gather. To celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Townsville a Jubilee carnival was promoted by the Townsville and District Development Association. Nearly all major celebrations and community events finished at the Townsville Showground, which provided a fitting venue for the community to enjoy the fireworks display after the opening torchlight procession from the centre of town. Over the next week, the community and region enjoyed a number of sporting and novelty events, including bicycle races, athletics, children's sporting events and music contests bringing in competitors from Cairns, Mareeba and Charters Towers and attracting state of the art mechanical entertainment in the form of a steam-powered merry-go- round. In the 1910s the Townsville Municipal Council began a series of drainage works programme in the West End area. From 1913 onwards substantial stormwater drains were constructed to direct the flow of water from Castle Hill to counter the effects of tropical downpours. Consisting of large concrete and stone pitched storm water drains and with at least two drains traversed the Showgrounds and the scope of the drainage programme was not fully completed in the mid 1920s. These works enabled a review of the Showground facilities with low-lying areas of the grounds built up, boundary fences extended, new turnstiles installed and the popular poultry and bird fanciers pavilion extended. In absence of a major exhibition facility, the adjacent military drill hall had long been used as the major exhibition hall. The special relationship between the Defence Force and TPA & I Association was reinforced through Memorial Day sports and demobilisation events in support of the returned local men who had fought during World War I. To acknowledge their efforts the Association Committee resolved to admit free of charge any soldiers in uniform, with no charge for machinery exhibits for returned soldiers engaged in agricultural pursuits. In 1918, Alfred Barton Brady, Government Architect for Queensland, oversaw the design of the Defence force Drill Hall. The name of Andrew Irving - a successful architectural draftsman with the Queensland Public Works Department - appears on the drawings. The new Drill hall was constructed around 1919 within the former defence force reserve of four acres to be used \\"... for horticulture, preserves, arts and crafts, children's section, caged birds and district exhibits\\". An open parade ground was located between the show ring and the Drill Hall. In 1924 the show circuit in North Queensland encompassed Mackay, Proserpine, Bowen, Ayr, and Charters Towers, and as far west as Hughenden, with the Townsville show being the premier event in the circuit. Sideshows were discouraged from the Townsville show prior to the 1920s, as it was felt that they attracted an undesirable class of people who might disrupt the \\"respectable\\" show proceedings. The fractious relationship between the sideshow men and the Queensland Chamber of Agriculture spilled over in the early 1920s with the sideshow men in Townsville staging a protest march, complete with a procession of ponies and posters, advocating a boycott of the TPA&I; Show. When eventually admitted, the sideshow men were confined to a small area between the butcher shops and the poultry pavilion. One of the first sideshows to gain access to the Townsville show was the Sharman and Staig Boxing Troupe in 1924. Within 15 years the Showmen's Guild played an integral role in the Townsville Show. By 1929 the showground improvements included a grandstand, exhibition hall, secretary's office, committee room, fat cattle yards, stud and dairy cattle stalls, dog shed, poultry pavilion and pavilions erected by various firms. The grounds were enclosed by an high iron fence and the show ring by a picket fence, and \\"at intervals along the boundary, magnificent trees give a cool and picturesque appearance to the surrounds\\" (Brisbane newspaper article cited in Thuringowa Library Heritage Services Information Sheet Number 12). During the severe economic depression of the early 1930s a flood of public support resulted in a range of planned fundraisers and benefits which ensured that the Show continued throughout the Depression. The Depression also gave rise to other community activities staged at the Showground, including a soup kitchen to cater for the large number of itinerant workers or for those just down on their luck, and as a camp ground for the 9th and 49th Battalions' reunion held in conjunction with the 1933 Townsville Show week. An increase of grounds use led to improved event facilities with additional seating offering trackside viewing provided via a series of eight-tiered stands. Constructed by local manufacturer Curley Bell during the late 1920s and early 1930s and later modified to incorporate safety rails, the viewing stands became affectionately known as the \\"Curley Bell's\\". The new stands provided better views of trotting events, which were reintroduced in 1939 with competitors and spectators from far and wide. By 1939, the Townsville Show was described in the popular Cummins & Campbells Monthly Magazine as the \\"Show Window of the North; but it is more than that.\\" The precinct was regarded as a community facility, as evidenced from the expanding repertoire of events throughout the 1930s including a gymkhana, motor cycle racing, a rodeo and greyhound racing. In the late 1930s concerns were raised at each TPA&I; Association committee meeting about the Showground's ability to provide adequate exhibition space. The overcrowding of exhibits made it evident that a larger exhibition hall was necessary if the Townsville Show was to continue to attract ongoing competitors and exhibitors as well as businesses and suppliers of goods and services. Local architectural firm W & M Hunt were approached to design an exhibition hall on the brief that it could also fulfil the additional roles of dance hall and rentable picture theatre. However, the final design was based upon a commercial warehouse that belonged to Heatley and was being constructed at the time in Ogden Street. To accommodate the new hall the dairy pavilion was removed and reassembled closer to the stud cattle pavilion in the south- eastern end of the grounds, and was upgraded with new milking pens and additional iron fencing. New horse stalls were constructed along the Parkes Street fence line to make up for the shortage of stabling accommodation for visiting horses. Messrs Hanson & Sons successfully tendered ¬£6130 for the construction of the new Exhibition Hall in late November 1937. When completed in 1939 the hall provided ample floor space for exhibits and for dancing purposes, being one of the largest dance venues in North Queensland. Three large sliding doors along each side of the hall and another at each end offered ample ventilation. Lighting was achieved by three lantern lights running along the ridge of each of the two gable roofs. Access to the dance hall was through the main entrance fronting Flinders Street (Ingham Road). After World War II this hall became known as Heatley Hall, in memory of Talbot Leslie Heatley, one of the longest-serving members and former president of the TPA&I; Association. During World War II in April 1942 the Australian Army seconded the showground for military purposes and the annual Show was suspended for three years. The advance parties of HQ 5 Division and 29 Infantry Brigade had arrived in Townsville and the Divisional HQ personnel were accommodated in the Showgrounds. Additional prefabricated warehouses were constructed at the showground in 1942-1943 (including the No.4 Bulk Store, later known as Keiry Hall). Regular Saturday night dances were held in the Heatley Hall to provide entertainment for local citizens and troops alike. Many local couples met and courted here during the war. During the three raids on the city by Japanese flying boats operating out of Rabaul in late July 1942, West End residents took advantage of the large concrete and stone- pitched storm water drains (approximately 1.6 high and up to wide in some areas) at the Showground as unofficial air raid shelters. When WWII was proclaimed officially over, the Victory Parade procession marched from the central business district and ended at the Townsville Showground where sideshow entertainment was provided for the crowd. Three young women dressed up for a day at the Townsville Show, 1941 At the completion of the war the annual pattern of Show planning and activities recommenced and the northern circuit reformed. Local and regional show-goers travelled to attend the premier event and dressed up to enjoy a day \\"at the show\\". For many it was the annual opportunity to meet relatives, socialise with friends, and have a photograph taken in their best clothes. For some it was the only opportunity to have a photograph taken. By 1951, through the incorporation of former Army buildings, the showground facilities had expanded to include three exhibition halls, a grandstand, extended agricultural and pastoral stalls for cattle and horses, dairy stalls and milking shed, as well as poultry and dog enclosures, a caretaker's office, association offices, a Pacific Ice cream booth, re- positioned entrance and side gates, as well as ticket offices and the Curly Bell stand. During this period the North Queensland pastoral industry renewed its breeding effort to produce a breed of cattle resilient to northern climatic conditions. As a result, the Townsville Show hosted the Brahman cattle breed for the first time in 1952 and the Santa Gertrudis in 1953. Both breeds were received by an enthusiastic crowd. In 1969 the North Queensland regional Show circuit included: Rockhampton, Mackay, Proserpine, Home Hill, Charters Towers, Bowen, Ayr, Townsville, Ingham, Malanda, Atherton, Innisfail, Cairns, Mossman, Collinsville, Tully with a broader show circuit to Brisbane. Townsville Show competition categories were either \\"District\\" or \\"Local\\". District events embraced any area North of the 24th parallel (approximately Gladstone) and west to the Queensland border. Local entries were drawn from Townsville, Thuringowa, Ayr, Dalrymple, Charters Towers and Hinchinbrook. The Railway Department continued to provide free livestock exhibit freightage for Show exhibits from and between local and regional show centres and for Show champions to the RNA. Excursion tickets were available for outlying towns and this practice continued into the 1970s. Road freightage was subsidized under The State Transport Act 1960 for the movement of livestock, machinery and produce to and from the Show. In 1971 the new cattle yards incorporating water troughs and a cattle sale arena complete with auctioneers platform were made available to the North Queensland Livestock and Property Brokers Produce Association for cattle sales. The Townsville Show also encouraged regional charities and organisations such as the Queensland Bush Children's Fund, H.M. Prison Farm and Rural Youth Clubs to exhibit and raise money. The impact of Cyclone Althea in 1972 provided the impetus for a major expansion and modification program to cater for changing Showground requirements. Every building sustained damage. Those that incorporated cyclone bracing survived relatively intact - such as the current Poultry Shed and Heatley Hall; others - such as the betting shed, caretaker's cottage, pig pavilion and Keiry Hall - were severely damaged or collapsed such as the Drill Hall (known as the Garbutt Hall). The show ring track was extended to its current elliptical shape to better cater for racing interests such as harness racing and motor cycle and bicycle races, and an officials' box was constructed to oversee the greyhound racing. The ring was enclosed by a new fence constructed of concrete block with cyclone mesh fencing. The fence, incorporated a decorative triangular pattern which was also used in the upgrade to one of the oldest Exhibition pavilions adjoining the Heatley Hall. When the show ring was extended the main grandstand was dismantled and relocated to its current position. Without the advantage of the earth mound and front spectator seats, two new steel access stairs were added. A second grandstand was constructed to provide additional seating and exhibition /office space. The Showground continually changed from the mid 1970s with nearly all of the substantial shade trees along Ingham Road removed, and smaller buildings constructed. Around the back of the ring where the cattle yards had previously stood, a large liquor booth was constructed as well as a Cat and Cavy pavilion, a kitchen, additional ablution blocks, additional horse stalls, and various smaller buildings. The Townsville Show remains popular with the local and regional community and continues to enjoy record attendances. In 2007 over 59,000 show attendees were registered over the three-day and four- night event while in 2008 this number expanded to approximately 63,300. The contemporary range of entertainment and cultural activities conducted at the Showground have expanded to cater to extreme sports events, public rock concerts and providing a venue for motor homes and motor bike clubs while maintaining a strong emphasis on attracting use by local community clubs and not-for-profit organisations.  Description  The Townsville Showground is located on the southern side of Castle Hill and adjacent to Ingham Road approximately from the city centre: it is bounded by Ingham Road, Kings Road, Woolcock Street and Parkes Street with the main entrance accessed from Parkes Street off an access easement which runs alongside the railway line. Two purpose built sub surface stormwater drains traverse the grounds: one in a north-south direction and the other east-west. Encompassing a total area of over 14.38 hectares, the Townsville showground comprises a collection of purpose-built buildings, yards, ticket booths, gates, turnstiles, additional seating and open space. These are eclectic and utilitarian in form with many examples of additions, re-location or building materials recycled within the precinct. Elements of particular significance include the stud cattle pavilions (s), central show ring arena (est.1882), Grandstand (1901), Heatley Hall (), Poultry Exhibition pavilion (), Exhibition pavilion, () ticket boxes, main entrance and side entrance (), as well as mature Banyon trees within the grounds. Principal elements of cultural heritage significance include the following structures.  Tunbridge & Tunbridge Grandstand (1901)  The roof is hipped with eaves overhang of corrugated steel sheeting on timber framing and timber trusses. The rear wall of the upper level retains the original timber louvres designed for ventilation. Two aisles provide access to the three banks of bench seating with the rear six rows including timber lumbar support. The grandstand has a timber floor in the grandstand seating area. Tall hardwood columns with mouldings and a decorative timber bressumer to the front and sides create nine separate bays. Most of the original decorative brackets are missing. Access to the Grandstand is achieved via two pairs of introduced steel stairs constructed in the 1970s when the building was relocated to its current location. Underneath the grandstand is exhibition/storage space with a concrete floor which is accessed from the sides and rear wall. An additional open shaded area has been added to the rear with a gabled roof.  Interwar Toilets (c. 1920-1940)  Located next to the Grandstand the toilets are timber framed with chamferboard external cladding and high level timber louvred ventilation. The roof is hipped with corrugated steel sheeting and unusual semi-circular steel ridge and hip flashing.  Central Show Ring (est. 1882)  The central ring consists of a grassed centred arena encircled by an elliptically-shaped track with the two long straights covering a distance of approximately with a perimeter gravel track and inner track of sand loam. The inner fence is fabricated from welded piping with small steel sections and a top rail. This incorporates a mechanical \\"lure\\" facility used for greyhound racing. The outer fence is constructed of concrete block with a decorative triangular motif at regular intervals. The outer ring follows the fall of the land and is strengthened via concrete buttresses. Posts constructed of steel pipes are spaced at regular intervals and filled by a steel cyclone mesh infill with a metal handrail on top. The whole outer fence is painted white. Access to the ring is achieved through regular access points, some which are concrete ramps. The Show ring and arena provide a central focal point by which the Exhibition buildings, liquor stands, amenities are constructed around. The ring along with the grandstands, poultry shed, Heatley Hall and a former Army Hall are located on the northern end of the precinct, with the main showground entrance and office area located on the north eastern corner.  Exhibition building/ Poultry and Bird Fancier Pavilion (c. 1920)  The Poultry and Bird fancier pavilion is a long rectangular building measuring approximately and running parallel to Heatley Hall and the Townsville Greyhound Racing Club. The building has a hipped corrugated steel roof incorporating King post trusses with 10 skylights at regular intervals. The interior floor has timber deck flooring supported on timber stumps. The building is clad with painted corrugated steel sheeting which is not full height and chicken wire infill provides ventilation. The place has two rows of purpose built poultry coops constructed in the mid 1940s that run full length of the building. Another two rows of coops are located along the perimeter interior walls. Three aisles, one central aisle and two side isles provide viewing access to the displays. Access to the building is gained through entrances on each end as well as through two side entrances on the western side. Each entrance has a decorative steel gate with cyclone mesh infill.  Heatley Hall (1939)  This is the largest Exhibition pavilion on the site approximately and high with twin gabled roofs, each with three hipped roof lantern lights at a length of approx which run along the two ridges. The lantern lights incorporate two fixed windows one at each end and six hopper windows which push out to provide additional ventilation. Timber buttresses provide additional strengthening to the high external walls which are clad in galvanised corrugated iron sheeting painted green. The corrugated iron cladding does not extend the full height of the wall instead infill to the rafters is provided via timber lattice panels which also provide additional ventilation. Horizontal timber slat panels conceal the underfloor area. Access is achieved through three large sliding doors on each side with an additional door on the interior Showground end. The original decorative facade with parapet end, providing street access (Ingham Road) has been modified to a flat sheeted wall. Internally there is a central row of columns supporting timber trusses and a box gutter. Hardwood tongue and groove flooring is laid throughout and supported on timber framing on top of concrete piers.  Kiery Hall/No 4 Bulk Store (c. 1942)  Keiry Hall has a single low pitched roof of corrugated galvanised steel sheeting over hardwood purlins on open web steel girders spanning the building width. The building measures approximately . The eastern wall of the hall is original comprising a row of concrete columns with walling of timber stud framing and painted corrugated galvanised sheet cladding infill. The rebuilt western, northern and southern walls (post Cyclone Althea) are constructed with steel columns, recycled timber purlins and painted corrugated galvanised sheet cladding. A lower height skillion roofed external addition has been built onto the western wall between pairs of roller doors. The addition is sheeted with painted corrugated galvanised steel to roof and walls. Two pairs of large timber framed and vertically boarded roller doors are positioned in both eastern and western walls of the hall whilst a pair of smaller hinged doors is located off-centre in both the northern and southern end walls. The building is unlined with a paint finish generally remaining on most of the internal walls. The internal floor is of concrete pavers laid to a fall.  Entrance gates and Ticket box and turnstiles (c. 1940s)  Located on the corner of Ingham Road and Parkes Street, the main entrance gates are constructed of welded steel bars in decorative geometric design incorporating the Townsville Pastoral Association logo. A pair of identical constructed entrance gates are located at the Ingham Road \\"Besser\\" entrance. The ticket booth has a hipped corrugated steel sheeted roof supported on a timbered framed building and clad with chamber board wall. Steel mesh secures the ticket box opening counter. Most of the turnstiles have been removed with only three remaining turnstiles located adjoining the ticket booth.  Security building (c. 1940s)  The timber framed building clad with weatherboards has a gabled roof, sheeted with corrugated steel and supported on concrete piers topped with termite caps. Entrance to the building is achieved up three moulded concrete steps through a single wooden door located on the southern side of the building. Two pairs of casement windows are located on each side of the building.  Police Building (c. 1940s)  This is a small rectangular building approximately clad in small panels of fibre cement sheeting at the front and larger panels on the sides. The building is accessed via a single door located on the right hand side and a small fixed window with security grill on the left. The small front panels extend up to form a small parapet and the front incorporates a small awning over the window and door. The building has a skillion roof, clad with corrugated steel and the building is based on a concrete slab which extends out the front of the building to form a small patio. This has been extended at some point to run across the front of buildings 13 & 14.  Landscape and grounds  The showground precinct has a number of substantial shade trees including Banyan Trees (Ficus benghalensis) (), Weeping Figs (Ficus benjamina), and Albizia (Albizia julibrissin) (). The trees are predominantly located at the livestock area at the south western side of the Showground with the exception of two. One is located at the entrance adjoining the caravan park and other behind the Keiry Hall exhibition hall.  Curley Bells (1920s-1930s)  These spectator stands named after their designer/builder are the original pre-fabricated seats constructed from welded piping and small steel sections. Seating is provided by 8 levels of hardwood board seats bolted to the framing and used as both steps and seats.  Stone pitched and concrete stormwater drains (c. 1910-mid 1920)  Two identified systems of stormwater drains measuring approximately 1.6 high and up to wide in some areas are located within the showgrounds. These drains are constructed of a variety of methods including predominately large stone pitched and mortar walls with a ceiling of concrete with imprint of timber large planked formwork for square ceiling and small narrow boards for the barrel vault ceiling. More recent sections are concrete block with steel planked formwork imprint. One drain begins at the base of Castle Hill and runs on a north-south axis to traverse a portion of the Show ring from behind the poultry pavilion and exiting into the large stormwater canal near the cattle yards. The second stormwater drain runs on an east-west axis from Kings Road near Keiry Hall and runs between the Stud Cattle pavilion and caretakers cottage to exit into the large stormwater canal from the bottom of Payne street.  Stud Cattle Pavilion (c. 1890s)  The Stud Cattle Pavilion () consists of a long building () and a shorter building () separated by an open area () with a small parade ground outside the northern entrance which is shaded by a mature Albizia (Albizia julibrissin ). Both buildings are of similar rural vernacular construction with inner and outer bush timber pole columns supporting a gable roof of corrugated galvanised steel sheeting on sawn hardwood rafters and beams and are painted white internally. The side walls are clad in painted corrugated galvanised steel on timber rails fixed to the outer bush timber poles with openings, for light and ventilation, covered in an open steel mesh spaced along their length. Bolted along the rails are various styles of forged iron and steel rings for tethering cattle. A skillion roofed storage area has been added to the southern side of the longer building. The main public access to the longer building is via a central entry through the northern wall to a central aisle and through the eastern end. This end has a high opening of about . The gable end is horizontally boarded with spaced vertical boards up to about completing the end wall. The pavilion has two enclosed tack rooms in a central location on either side of the pedestrian corridor. These small rooms are sheeted in painted corrugated galvanised steel of one sheet length height. Extending above the corrugated iron and up to the rafters are timber slats. Both small rooms have double timber doors. One set of doors is painted with barnyard motifs in a naive style. The open area between the buildings accommodates two wash down stalls, and a drinking trough. This open area provides the main access into the shorter building and minor access into the long building. The shorter building has an overhead deck constructed at approx height on hardwood joists and pine flooring on both sides of a central way. The pavilion has two enclosed tack rooms at the eastern end of the pavilion on either side of the pedestrian corridor at the point of entry. A concrete floor runs through the full length of the Stud Cattle Pavilion.  The Dairy Pavilion (c. 1939)  A gable roofed building with skillion additions to both sides roofed with corrugated galvanised steel on simple bolted hardwood trusses to the gable and hardwood rafter construction to the skillions all supported on steel pipe columns. The gable end, southern sidewall and rear wall are clad in corrugated galvanised steel whilst the northern side of the building is open. The front wall has vertical hardwood slabs to either side of two central vehicle access openings and a central placed sign indicating the pavilion. Internal dividing partitions are of vertical corrugated steel sheeting with livestock pens framed in steel piping to either side of the building. The smaller (poddy calf) pens are along the northern side. The building is unpainted and has a concrete floor. On the right hand side of the dairy pavilion are a series of open air blue painted steel pipe livestock stalls which run the full length of dairy and long the northern side of the cattle yards and end at the cattle ramps located at the Cattle Sales Arena.  Cattle yards (c. 1970)  Extensive cattle yards are contained in 8 sections which include over 100 cattle stall partitions. Fence post are former rail track sections with a top plate and middle rails of steel piping, with welded infill of galvanised reinforcing mesh. Each stall is serviced by a water trough with water reticulated from a raised central water system with intermittent taps. Six aisles allow pedestrian inspection of the yards and each aisle has a concrete pavement with a square paved pattern and laid to a fall. Several shade trees are present in the cattle yard area. All trees are introduced species.  Cattle Sales Arena (c. 1970)  Adjoining the cattle yards is a part open purpose designed stand for the auction of cattle and horses. The arena has U shaped plan of tiered seating around the sales pen and a raised auctioneers platform over the gate entry to the sales pen. The construction is steel pipe framing with an aluminium roof sheeting on hardwood rafters. The tiered seating is of hardwood boards fixed on angle iron supports in a slat style. Adjoining the sales arena are two loading ramps constructed of concrete and steel pipe rails. Two timber carved cattle heads adorn two posts to indicate the cattle area.  Horse Stalls (c. 1970)  Located on the left hand side of the dairy pavilion the horse stalls are constructed from former rail track sections used as fence posts with stalls created by steel pipe horizontals in-between the columns. The skillion roof has steel pipe rafters and is sheeted with corrugated steel roof sheeting. The horse stalls provide an ambulatory link between the former dairy pavilion and the Stud cattle pavilion. Ample shade is afforded to the horse stalls by least two Weeping Figs (Ficus benjamina).  Caretakers House (c. 1920)  Located near the Woolcock Street boundary fence, the house has a hipped roof, sheeted in corrugated short sheet steel with skillion awnings to the enclosed verandahs. The house is raised above ground level with access stairs from within the Showgrounds.  Toilet & shower amenities (post 1950)  Timber framed separate male and female toilet and shower facilities sheeted with painted corrugated galvanised steel to skillion roof and walls. Facilities are located at the south eastern end of the Show ring near the cattle sales arena.  Heritage listing  Townsville Showground was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 October 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. In use as a showground since 1882, the Townsville Showground is integral to the important Queensland showground circuit that culminates in the annual Royal National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland (RNA) Exhibition in Brisbane. It remains one of the longest-running showground facilities outside Brisbane and is one of North Queensland's premier showgrounds. The place provided an important venue for showcasing and facilitating the expansion of pastoral, agriculture and industrial production and innovation in North Queensland during the late nineteenth century and much of the twentieth century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Townsville Showground, developed between the 1880s and the 1970s, is an intact regional showground facility which demonstrates the principal elements characteristic of its type. These include: exhibition halls, grandstands, the Curley Bell stands, show ring, poultry and livestock facilities, dairy sheds, stabling and marshalling areas, as well as gates and turnstiles. The 1901 grandstand at the Townsville Showground is one of two major grandstands designed and constructed in the late nineteenth/early twentieth century by Tunbridge and Tunbridge, one of Townsville's principal architectural firms and designers. The other grandstand is located at Cluden Racecourse (1896). It is important in illustrating the quality of their design work. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Townsville Showground incorporates elements that are aesthetically significant including the Tunbridge & Tunbridge grandstand (1901), interwar amenities blocks, Heatley Hall (1939), the Stud Stock pavilions (c.1890s), entrance gates, ticket boxes, Curley Bell stands (1920-30s), poultry pavilion, show ring and mature Banyan trees. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has a strong social significance for generations of Townsville and North Queensland families who have attended the annual pastoral and agricultural exhibitions since 1882. The 1901 grandstand and Heatley Hall have particular social significance as the place where families enjoy watching events and where couples court. The place remains important as a venue for major regional community and entertainment events. The place is important as one of the few venues where the products of women's and children's labour associated with the domestic and educational environments has been exhibited regularly since the late nineteenth century. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Townsville Showground has a strong and special association with the important work of the Townsville Pastoral, Agricultural and Industrial Association in fostering the expansion of pastoral, agriculture and industrial production and innovation in North Queensland since 1882.

She later went on to become a nationally syndicated humor columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle for two decades. Her writing was praised as mixing \\"gentle humor with sly wit and an occasional sharp needle.\\"  Early life  Adeline was born in Nashwauk, Minnesota to Finnish-American parents as one of nine children. At the age of 15 she wrote a letter to the editor at the Duluth News Tribune declaring that she wanted to be \\"a retired newspaper career woman who would be happy to serve as the newspaper's Iron Range correspondent.\\" Continuing her interest in reporting, she graduated from the University of Minnesota with a B.S. in Journalism in 1943.  Career  After college, Adeline moved to San Francisco where two of her sisters were living and got a job as a copyboy at the San Francisco Call-Bulletin. After slyly exaggerating her knowledge of and enthusiasm for sports, she was given a two- week trial for a reporter position left vacant by Walt Daley, a sportswriter who had just left for active duty in World War II. She studied sports and score-keeping at the local public library, enabling her to pass her trial and cover the high school sports beat for the next three years. However, her editor shortened her byline to \\"Del\\" Sumi to disguise the fact that she was a woman to male readers. Moreover, male reporters covering high school sports for competing newspapers were not keen on sharing the beat with a female reporter and stuck her with the worst games when they pooled reporting assignments. Since she would meet fans, coaches, and players at the games she covered, it was eventually widely known and accepted that she was female. For this reason she has been referred to as \\"female sportswriters' own Jackie Robinson.\\" In the summer of 1945, Walt Daley returned from war and hit it off with Adeline on his visit back to the newspaper's office. A few months later, he and Adeline married, with Walter insisting he did so to get his job back. She took a break from journalism to raise their seven children. In 1961, she began writing humorous articles about raising a family for magazines including Coronet and Pageant. In 1963, the San Francisco Chronicle hired her to do a twice-weekly column, \\"Coffee Break\\". The column was syndicated nationally, appearing in newspapers throughout California and as far as Michigan's Detroit Free Press and Connecticut's Sunday Herald. Additionally, her column was often quoted in publications such as Sports Illustrated, Variety, and the Los Angeles Times. In addition to her clever humor, Adeline's writing is recognized as transcending the \\"trapped housewife\\" narrative of the era. In the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, she was also a prolific public speaker, delivering talks to professional groups and women's clubs throughout California and Nevada. She was described as \\"one of the most amusing and sparkling speakers of the current era, with her wit and humor similar to that of Erma Bombeck.\\" She died in 1984 after a brief illness. Today, reprints of her \\"Coffee Break\\" column occasionally run in the San Francisco Chronicle as part of the \\"Chronicle Classics\\" series.

History  Italian reggae band Mellow Mood officially debuted in 2009 with ‚ÄúMove!‚Äù. Produced by Paolo Baldini, who was later to become their sound architect, the album was intended to be their first ‚Äúmove‚Äù on the reggae scene and gained unexpected international success. Thanks to their heartfelt live shows, Rototom Sunsplash named Mellow Mood best Italian reggae band, and ranked them third at European level in the same year. The two singles ‚ÄúOnly You‚Äù and ‚ÄúDance Inna Babylon‚Äù now have a total of more than fifty million views on YouTube. After a line-up change, Mellow Mood went back into the studio with Baldini to record ‚ÄúWell Well Well‚Äù, and were signed by Italy‚Äôs most important independent label, La Tempesta, in 2012. Sailing through roots- reggae, rocksteady and tribal clubbing, Mellow Mood proved to be among the protagonists of a new generation of reggae artists hailing from all over the planet. A major European tour followed and led the band to play in 12 countries, performing at important festivals like Rototom Sunsplash and Sziget Festival, Reggae Camp. Mellow Mood then released twin albums ‚ÄúTwinz‚Äù and ‚Äú2 The World‚Äù in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Produced by Paolo Baldini and published by La Tempesta, the albums are enriched by international collaborations (Tanya Stephens, Jah9, Richie Campbell, Hempress Sativa Sr. Wilson and Forelock among others) and couple the rediscovery of roots music with a deeper knowledge of the most recent Jamaican sounds. In late 2015 Mellow Mood also celebrated the birth of their own sub-label La Tempesta Dub (to release the band‚Äôs future works) with a touring mini-festival featuring international guests.

The roof of the Sheppton anthracite coal mine collapsed on August 13 and three miners were trapped 300 feet below ground. A small borehole was drilled from the surface in an attempt to contact the miners. After several days a borehole successfully reached a mine, and revealed that two of the miners, Henry Throne and David Fellin, had survived in a small, narrow chamber. Rescuers dropped provisions to the miners and subsequent larger boreholes were made, including the final large hole bored with the assistance of billionaire Howard Hughes, and the two surviving miners were successfully raised to the surface on August 27. Attempts to contact the third miner, Louis Bova, were unsuccessful. In 2015, a Pennsylvania state historical marker was installed near the site where a third miner remains entombed. That same year, the book Sheppton: The Myth, Miracle & Music, explored themes of the miraculous and supernatural at the Sheppton disaster site.

History  Mulberry Island was a large plantation located along the Dan River in Rockingham County, near Stoneville and Leaksville. The house was built by Nathaniel Scales (1756-1824) and his wife, who was a niece of Colonial Governor Josiah Martin. It faces south, looking down on the river valley. The plantation sat on 1,298 acres. Scales left Mulberry Island to his son, Alfred Moore Scales, upon his death. It adjoined Deep Springs Plantation on the Dan River, which was home to another one of Nathaniel Scales' sons, James Madison Scales. Nathaniel Scales' daughter inherited another nearby farm, High Rock Farm. In the 1850s the plantation came into the Settle family. It was the home of North Carolina Chief Justice and United States Minister to Peru, Thomas B. Settle II. After the Settles, the plantation was owned by the Trogden family and then by John Moore. In 1930 the farm was purchased by Charlie Penn of Reidsville, North Carolina who remodeled the house, adding a large porch and other additions.

The Hall conductivity acquires quantized values proportional to integer multiples of the conductance quantum (e^2/h), and is similar to the quantum Hall effect in this regard.

He was an early proponent of China's reform and opening up, and went on to create Shekou Industrial Zone, China International Marine Containers, CSG Holding, China Merchants Bank, and Ping An Insurance. Early life and career Born in Bao'an County, now part of Shenzhen, he joined the Chinese Communist Party at age 21 and fought guerrilla operations against the Japanese occupation army in the Dongjiang (East River) Column of the CPC-led Guangdong People's Anti-Japanese Aggression Guerrilla Force from March 1939. In 1942 he led a noted rescue operation of 800 people, and in 1944 became head of the Dongjiang Column's liaison division. In this capacity he provided crucial information to the US military (Pacific Fleet and 14th Army Air Force) about Japanese operations in Guangdong. In September 1945, he created a liaison office for the Communist guerrillas in Hong Kong, which later became the Xinhua News Agency office and as such, the de facto embassy of the People's Republic of China in the territory after 1949. From 1945 to 1949 he went on to fight the Chinese Civil War as an artillery officer. From November 1949, Yuan Geng pursued a career as an intelligence officer, seconded to Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam in 1950, then as Consul in Jakarta from 1952. In 1955, he was in charge of security for the Chinese delegation at the Bandung Conference, and was credited with saving Premier Zhou Enlai from the KMT-led assassination plot that resulted in the airplane crash of the Kashmir Princess. He was imprisoned in April 1968 during the Cultural Revolution, in Beijing's Qincheng Prison. In October 1975, he was rehabilitated and appointed Deputy Director of the Bureau of Foreign Affairs in the Ministry of Communications (or Transport). Father of Shekou Transport Minister Ye Fei asked Yuan Geng to direct his attention to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in Hong Kong, a Qing Dynasty-era commercial enterprise which the PRC government regime had taken over in 1949 and kept in operation. Based on his in-depth knowledge of Hong Kong, Yuan Geng became convinced of the immense potential for market-led economic development on the mainland. His report on how to make better use of China Merchants was forwarded by the Transports Ministry to the State Council on 9 October 1978, recommending opening up the mainland economy to the international market using China Merchants as an instrument. This proposal was approved after three days. The policy context became even more favorable following the Third Plenum meeting of December 1978, which cemented the political leadership of Deng Xiaoping and the policy direction of reform and opening up. Losing no time, in early January 1979 Yuan Geng prepared a pilot project in the form of an industrial zone supported by China Merchants, initially focused on ship breaking, with exemptions from the mainland's constraints on economic activity. Yuan Geng chose to start with a geographically limited area as the Shekou Industrial Park (SIP), which later became the Shekou Industrial Zone. The project was supported by Transport Minister Ye Fei and Guangdong Revolutionary Commission chairman Zheng Sheng. It was swiftly approved in a meeting on 31 January 1979 in Zhongnanhai attended by Party Vice Chairman Li Xiannian, Vice Premier Gu Mu, Vice Minister of Communications Peng Deqing, and Yuan Geng. Li Xiannian circled the Nantou Peninsula, on which Shekou is located, on Yuan Geng's map of the Hong Kong area, to mark approval of the project and extension of its perimeter. Following this episode, the project was nicknamed \\"circled SIP.\\" The Shekou Industrial Park then became the template for Deng Xiaoping's subsequent policy to establish China's special economic zones (SEZs), which took shape in April 1979 on proposals by Guangdong officials led by Xi Zhongxun. In Guangdong, the policy was actively pursued by Xi Zhongxun's successor Ren Zhongyi, who worked closely with Yuan Geng. Throughout the 1980s, Yuan Geng pioneered policies that were unprecedented in post-1949 China, such as merit-based recruitment, promotion and pay, open access to housing, competitive procurement bids, local elections, local press freedom, and attracting foreign direct investors. The approach he developed for access to housing, freed from individual dependence on work unit, has been credited as a key enabler of the Pearl River Delta's success. In 1985 he organized local elections in the Shekou Industrial Park, in which 2,000 residents and workers participated. The microclimate of freedom Yuan Geng fostered in Shekou was illustrated by the incident known as \\"Shekou tempest\\" in 1988. In 1981 Yuan Geng coined the slogan ‚Äútime is gold and efficiency is life.‚Äù It was endorsed by Deng Xiaoping during his visit of Shenzhen in January 1984 and subsequently approved as Shekou's slogan on February 24, 1984. Yuan's slogan was inscribed on a giant billboard in Shekou and became a motto of the reform era. Later ventures Yuan Geng went on to create a number of state-owned enterprises which participated greatly in the prosperity of the Pearl River Delta, most of them directly to support economic activity in Shekou. In January 1980, he established China International Marine Containers. In July 1982 he created China Nanshan Development (Group) Incorporation, China's first Sino-foreign joint-stock joint venture, for the development of an oil terminal. He followed up with the creation of Shenzhen Chiwan Wharf Holdings Limited, now known as Chiwan Base, as a joint-venture with Singaporean partners. In 1984 he created China Southern Glass Holding Limited, now China's largest architectural glass manufacturer. In 1987 he created China Merchants Bank, the first joint-stock commercial bank on China's mainland, with support from the People's Bank of China Governor, Ms Chen Muhua. In May 1988, he steered the creation of Ping An, the first joint-stock insurance company on the Chinese mainland, initially with support from China Merchants Bank. Death and legacy Yuan Geng retired in 1992. He was never very senior in the Party hierarchy, did not amass personal wealth, and was highly respected for his integrity, loyalty and humility. He died on January 31, 2016, in Shenzhen. The local and national press immediately paid tribute, celebrating him as a significant protagonist of China's reform and opening up. On the night of his passing away, an official memorial ceremony was led by Shenzhen Party Secretary Ma Xingrui and Mayor Xu Qin at the Shekou China Merchants Museum. Simultaneously, a spontaneous celebration was held at the Shekou Community Trust, echoing other cases of unprovoked manifestation of popular support following the death of respected Chinese officials. Pony Ma, founder of Shenzhen-based Tencent, has described Yuan Geng as \\"the embodiment of the Shenzhen spirit.\\" A statue of Yuan Geng by local sculptor Lu Zengkang, sponsored by China Merchants Group, was inaugurated in Shekou's Sea World downtown development on 23 April 2017, his 100th birthday.

A lyrical compendium of his early music, it is one of Satie's most famous compositions, second in popular recognition only to the Gymnop√©dies (1888).Mary E. Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", Reaktion Books, 2007, pp. 71-72. The score was not published until 1911. In performance it lasts around 14 minutes. It is typical of Satie's eccentric humor that the suite consists of seven pieces, not three. Background Satie composed the Trois morceaux en forme de poire in Paris between August and November 1903, during a period of creative crisis. He was unhappy earning a meager living writing and performing cabaret music, and had abandoned his recent \\"serious\\" musical projects - the piano piece The Dreamy Fish (1901) and the orchestral tone poem The Angora Ox (1902) - as failures.Both projects were to texts by Satie's longtime friend, the poet Lord Cheminot (Contamine de Latour). And the shock of hearing his friend Claude Debussy's landmark opera Pell√©as et M√©lisande (1902) led to him to realize that experimenting with musical Impressionism was a dead end: \\"Nothing more can be done in this direction; I must search for something else or I am lost.\\"Robert Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 55. Claude Debussy Legend has it the Trois morceaux was Satie's tongue-in- cheek response to Debussy's advice that he should \\"pay more attention to form\\" in his music.Frank N. Magill (ed.), \\"The 20th Century O-Z: Dictionary of World Biography\\", Routledge, 2013, p. 3332. Conductor Vladimir Golschmann recalled Satie telling him that \\"All I did...was to write Pieces in the form of a pear. I brought them to Debussy, who asked, 'Why such a title?' Why? Simply, my dear friend, because you cannot criticize my Pieces in the shape of a pear. If they are en forme de poire they cannot be shapeless.\\"Vladimir Golschmann, \\"Golschmann Remembers Erik Satie\\", Musical America 22 (August 1972), p. 11. The italics are in Golschmann's original.This anecdote was first related during Satie's lifetime by critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi in his article \\"Erik Satie: A Few Recollections and Remarks\\", Monthly Musical Record, 55, 6, January 1925.John Williamson (ed.), \\"Words and Music\\", Liverpool University Press, 2005, p. 172. However the probity of this anecdote has been disputed in light of a letter Satie wrote to Debussy on August 17, 1903, when the suite was still in its early stages:Patrick Gowers and Nigel Wilkins, \\"Erik Satie\\", \\"The New Grove: Twentieth-Century French Masters\\", Macmillan Publishers Limited, London, 1986, p. 139. Reprinted from \\"The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians\\", 1980 edition.Olof H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 6\\", Swedish Society Discofil, 1996, pp. 20-21. :\\"I am working at the present time on a delightful work entitled Deux morceaux en forme de poire. Monsieur Erik Satie is crazy about this new invention of his mind. He talks about it a lot and says very good things about it. He believes it superior to everything he has written up to now; perhaps he's wrong, but we musn't tell him so: he wouldn't believe it.\\"Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 55. This is one of only three Satie letters to Debussy that survive. These original two pieces were probably Morceaux I and II,The MS of the Trois morceaux is incomplete, but Patrick Gowers and Steven Moore Whiting believe Morceaux I-III were written in sequential order. Robert Orledge maintains that I and III were written first. See Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall\\", Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 264, note 37, and Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", pp. 56-57. and the work expanded outwards from there. Morceaux I is the only piece in the set consisting entirely of new music; the rest were largely recycled from older material. To the core group of Morceaux I-III Satie added two introductory and two concluding pieces, with headings that spoofed academic teaching of the kind he loathed during his studies at the Paris Conservatoire in the 1880s.H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 6\\", pp. 20-21. Honor√© Daumier's 1831 caricature of King Louis Philippe's head turning into a pear The title Trois morceaux en forme de poire prefigures those of Satie's humoristic piano suites of the 1910s and reflects his fondness for puns and ironic ambiguity. The word \\"poire\\" was time-honored French slang for \\"head\\", meaning \\"fool\\" or \\"simpleton\\". In the 1830s caricaturist Honor√© Daumier satirically defined the reign of French King Louis Philippe by drawing the monarch with a pear-shaped head, and the insult became entrenched in the popular lexicon.Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 71. This subversive meaning is frequently cited by Satie biographers and researchers,H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 6\\", pp. 20-21. with differing opinions over whether the composer intended it to mock Debussy, himself, or both.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 56.Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 76.Williamson, \\"Words and Music\\", p. 172.Rollo H. Myers, \\"Erik Satie\\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 75. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London.H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 6\\", pp. 20-21. \\"Poire\\" was also a nickname for a child's spinning top, and the oscillating, repetitive material of the outer pieces of the Trois morceaux has been likened to the toy's movement.Williamson, \\"Words and Music\\", p. 172. The suite was Satie's first composition for piano four hands,H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 6\\", pp. 20-21. a genre he would subsequently enrich with original works (Aper√ßus d√©sagr√©ables, En habit de cheval) and arrangements (Parade, La belle excentrique). Keyboard duets were a popular form of home music-making in the years before World War I, but as Satie made no immediate attempt to publish the Trois morceaux it is possible he chose this form simply because it provided him and Debussy with an opportunity to play together.H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 6\\", pp. 20-21. What Debussy thought of the work is not known, though he retained enough interest to help Satie correct the proofs for its initial publication eight years later.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 56. In a bizarre, self- aggrandizing text scribbled on the verso of the manuscript, Satie heralded the Trois morceaux as \\"a prestigious turning point in the History of My Life.\\"Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 56. But beneath the braggadocio and jesting over matters of form was Satie's growing sense that his technique was inadequate, and hindering his progress as a composer.On his deathbed Satie told Robert Caby that \\"there is a musical language and one must learn it.\\" See Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 76. Robert Orledge noted that the sheer amount of self-borrowing in the Trois morceaux was \\"not a healthy sign\\" for a musician dedicated to looking towards the future.Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer, p. 81. Satie later admitted to his brother Conrad that he grew \\"tired of being reproached with an ignorance of which I thought I must be guilty, since competent people pointed it out in my works.\\"Erik Satie, letter to Conrad Satie dated January 17, 1911. Published in Ornella Volta (ed.), \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, pp. 27-28. The Trois morceaux en forme de poire would be his last important composition for nearly a decade. In 1905, at the age of 39, Satie humbly enrolled as a student at the Schola Cantorum in Paris, where for the next seven years he studied counterpoint with Albert Roussel and orchestration with Vincent d'Indy. It was a move that profoundly influenced the rest of his career, giving him the technical foundation to develop his mature style. Music The Trois morceaux is an unorthodox retrospective of Satie's early creative evolution. Dispensing with a chronological scheme, Satie variously dips into the music of his youthful Chat Noir days, his \\"Rosicrucian\\" phase, and his gradual (if seemingly reluctant) embrace of popular influences, culminating in his \\"caf√©- concert\\" style of the early 1900s. Although the prevailing tone is that of melancholy, the work is tuneful, often lively, and (apart from some occasional disruptive chords) easy to listen to. These are seven separate pieces, musically unrelated to each other but given a semblance of formal cohesion by Satie's less-than-serious headings. Steven Moore Whiting noted that \\"The core pieces of the morceaux each present a distinctive synthesis of Satie's various styles\\", while the framing numbers are straightforward presentations of earlier material with little alteration of the originals.Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", pp. 265-267. Nothing about the music suggests a relationship to the pear of the title.Davis, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 71. The pieces and their provenance are as follows: :1. Mani√®re de commencement (A Way of Beginning) - Allez mod√©r√©ment (moderately) English translations of the titles are from Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 263.See also original edition of the score (1911) available at IMSLP, http://imslp.org/wiki/3_Morceaux_en_forme_de_poire_(Satie,_Erik) :An unpublished Gnossienne originally written as part of Satie's incidental music for Jos√©phin P√©ladan's play Le Fils des √©toiles (1892)Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 273. :2. Prolongation du m√™me (More of the Same) - Au pas (walking pace) :A march based on Satie's unfinished cabaret song Le Roi soleil de plomb (c. 1900) :3. Morceaux 1 (Piece I) - Lentement (slowly) :The only newly-composed whole piece in the set, it recalls the structural procedures of Satie's \\"esoteric\\" music of the early 1890s (e.g., the Pr√©lude de la porte h√©ro√Øque du ciel) but is harmonically closer to the parody songs he wrote for entertainer Vincent Hyspa at the turn of the 20th centuryWhiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", pp. 265-266. :4. Morceaux 2 (Piece II) - En lev√© (detached) :An ebullient march and trio based on two of Satie's cabaret songs, Imp√©rial- Napol√©on (1901) and Le Veuf (1899) :5. Morceaux 3 (Piece III) - Brutal (brutally) :An ABA structure. Whiting called the jarring, newly-composed 21-bar introduction \\"possibly the most forward-looking music in the whole work.\\"Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 266. In the central section Satie evokes the style of his Pi√®ces froides (1897), incorporating 25 bars of a rejected draft for the second of the Danses de travers Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 264. :6. En plus (What's More) - Calme (calmly) :A literal transcription of Satie's Danse for chamber ensemble (1890), his earliest known :attempt at orchestral composition :7. Redite (Rehash) - Dans le lent (slowly) :Uses material from the abandoned music for The Angora Ox (1902) and alludes to the popular slow waltzes Satie was writing at the time (e.g., Je te veux) Publication and performance Cover for the original edition of Satie's Trois morceaux en forme de poire (1911) The Trois morceaux was first published by Rouart, Lerolle & Cie, which brought out several of Satie's old compositions in the wake of his much-publicized 1911 \\"discovery\\" by Maurice Ravel. From there it served as a \\"musical calling card\\" for Satie's entry into Parisian high society through performances at fashionable salons or private events.Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 468, note 18. The earliest documented performance was given by Ravel and Florent Schmitt at the studio of Valentine de Saint-Point on June 11, 1912.Ann-Marie Hanlon, \\"Satie and the French Musical Canon: A Reception Study\\", University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, 2013. Appendix 2: Concert programmes 1911-1925, p. 311. As Hanlon noted, there is no official premiere date for the \\"Trois morceaux\\". At https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/10443/2124/1/Hanlon,%20A.M.%2013.pdf On January 19, 1914, 14-year-old musical prodigy Georges Auric (accompanied by Jean Moulenq) took on all of Satie's piano duet music at an exclusive gathering in Paris.Hanlon, pp. 315-316. Auric and Moulenq played the Trois morceaux, the Aper√ßus d√©sagr√©ables (1908-1912) and En habit de cheval (1911), while Auric himself played nine of Satie's solo piano compositions, from the Sarabandes (1887) to the Chap√Ætres tourn√©s en tous sens (1913). A note at the end of the printed program is very much in Satie's more aggressive vein: \\"In deference to the artists we demand a rigorous silence.\\" Influential arts patron Misia Sert arranged to have Satie himself play the work for impresario Sergei Diaghilev at her home on June 28, 1914, with an eye towards gaining him a commission from Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. The occasion was disrupted by breaking news of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo,Ornella Volta (ed.), \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, p. 102. the act that precipitated the start of World War I, and for the time being nothing came of the idea. The most important of these invitation-only performances of the Trois morceaux took place at the Salle Huyghens located in the 14th arrondissement of Paris on April 18, 1916, with Ricardo Vi√±es and the composer at the piano.See Orledge, \\"Satie the Composer\\", p. 287; Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", p. 487; H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 6\\", p. 21. It was the centerpiece of a \\"Satie- Ravel Festival\\" sponsored by the Soci√©t√© Lyre et Palette, which drew a prestigious crowd of artists, intellectuals and upper crust tastemakers. Alexis Roland-Manuel introduced the program with a lecture on Satie and his aesthetic,Roland-Manuel published the text at his own expense as Erik Satie: Causerie faite √† la Soci√©t√© Lyre et Palette le 18 Avril 1916 (Avec une Bibliographie) (1916). It has sometimes been referred to as Satie's first \\"biography\\" and includes the first important worklist of his compositions. See Hanlon, p. 319. and some of his newer works were heard (the 1915 Avant- derni√®res pens√©es and two songs from the Trois M√©lodies of 1916, sung by Jane Bathori). But the \\"pear-shaped pieces\\" made the greatest impression on the audience, much to Satie's chagrin. He had grown sick of the morceaux by then and made his feelings clear in his thank-you note to Vi√±es the following day: \\"How very boring my old music is! What bullshit, I venture to say!\\"Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 108. The two epithets (emmerdante and connerie in the original French) were italicized by Satie. Author Jean Cocteau, who attended the Salle Huyghens event, thought otherwise. He had long nursed the idea of an avant-garde ballet project with a fairground setting that he hoped would \\"astonish\\" Diaghilev,Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian\\", pp. 467-468. and decided that the Trois morceaux, with its idiosyncratic use of popular song and dance idioms, was ideal for his purposes.Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 109. He proposed a collaboration with Satie through an intermediary, their mutual friend artist Valentine Hugo. On April 25 Satie wrote to Hugo, \\"I hope the admirable Cocteau won't use any of my old works. Let's do something new, right? No joke.\\"Volta, \\"Satie Seen Through His Letters\\", p. 109. After meeting with Satie, Cocteau agreed to forego the morceaux in favor of a brand new score. This was the origin of the landmark Satie-Picasso-Cocteau-Massine ballet Parade, produced by Diaghilev in 1917. The Trois morceaux became something of a warhorse for Satie and was one of his most frequently played works in Paris during his lifetime.Hanlon, p. 84. He allowed choreographer Leonide Massine to patch together the morceaux and another of his piano duets, the Trois petites pi√®ces mont√©es (1920), into the ballet Premier Amour (1924) for the short-lived Soir√©es de Paris stage company at the Th√©√¢tre de la Cigale. It was a solo number starring Lydia Lopokova as a girl who dreams she falls in love with a doll. Satie and his favorite interpreter of the 1920s, Marcelle Meyer, played the piano during its handful of performances.Leslie Norton, \\"Leonide Massine and the 20th Century Ballet\\", McFarland, 2004, p. 98.Sally Banes, \\"Writing Dancing in the Age of Postmodernism\\", Second Edition, Wesleyan University Press, 2011, Part II, Chapter 8. After Satie's death, his prot√©g√© composer-conductor Roger D√©sormi√®re arranged the Trois morceaux for orchestra and kept it in his concert repertoire for the rest of his career.In July 1950 D√©sormi√®re programmed the morceaux with works by Stravinsky, Dallapiccola, Bartok, and Boulez. See the Roger D√©sormi√®re (1898-1963) website at https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl;=fr&u;=https://sites.google.com/site/rogerdesormiere18981963/concerts- representations/annees-50&prev;=search On June 9, 1949, the duet version was broadcast in England on the BBC Third Programme during an all-Satie concert devised by Constant Lambert; the pianists were Geraldine and Mary Peppin.BBC program info at http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/third/1949-06-09 The first recording was by Satie disciple Francis Poulenc and Jacques F√©vrier for Musidisc in 1959. In the 1990s, pianist-musicologist Olof H√∂jer (who recorded Satie's complete keyboard music) maintained that the Trois morceaux was much better known by its title and reputation than by its presence in contemporary performance.H√∂jer, notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 6\\", Swedish Society Discofil, 1996, pp. 20-21. Pear imagery has become part of Satie's iconography through its appearance on album covers of his music and in artwork and writings pertaining to the composer. For example, at Les Maisons Satie (Satie Birthplace and Museum) in Honfleur, France, one of the exhibits is a large animatronic statue of a winged pear.Video guide of Les Maisons Satie at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJqWeMqcbso In popular culture *Choreographer Merce Cunningham created his 1953 ballet Septet to the score of the Trois morceaux.Ballet summary from the Merce Cunningham Trust website at http://www.mercecunningham.org/index.cfm/choreography/dancedetail/params/work_ID/57/ *Artist Man Ray, a friend of Satie's in the 1920s, paid tribute to him with two colored lithographs entitled Erik Satie's Pear (1969).Francis M.

His best performances in major golf championships were a T24 finish in the 1923 U.S. Open and a T9 showing in the 1920 PGA Championship. In September 1910, the 17-year-old former caddie won the Greater New York Championship at the Van Cortlandt Park links, beating William Wallace. Early life Sylvester was born February 2, 1893 in New York City, New York, the son of Italian immigrants Alfonso and Philomena Sylvester. His father worked at a factory that made pianos. Not unlike the majority of golfers from his generation, Sylvester first learned to play golf after working as a caddie. He was also a fine maker of golf clubs. Golf career At age 17, Sylvester won the Greater New York Championship at the Van Cortlandt Park links, defeating William Wallace. Sylvester played in a number of U.S. Open tournaments. His results were as follows: T45 in 1913; 50th in 1915; T44 in 1921; and T24 in 1923. Sylvester was hired as the professional at the Glens Falls Country Club in Queensbury, New York, in 1914 but spent only one season there. He then took a post as club professional at St. Albans Country Club (now defunct) in Queens, New York, from 1915 to 1938. In 1939, Sylvester was the head professional at the Pomonok Country Club on Long Island where that year's PGA Championship was contested. As the home professional, he was exempt from qualifying. For reasons unknown, however, the official records for the tournament do not reflect Sylvester as being in the starting field. Sylvester's golf career was put on hold when he was called up for duty to serve during World War I. It was reported in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle on November 29, 1918 that Sylvester was wounded when he was shot in his calf while fighting in France. The report went on to say that Sylvester did not think the wound would affect his professional career and that he had done more teaching than playing since his 1913 appearance at Brookline. In 1936 he was paired with Babe Ruth in a pro-am best-ball tournament at the Rockville Country Club on Long Island. Sylvester's game suffered as he was \\"distracted\\" by the large crowds that followed Ruth. 1919 PGA Championship In the 1919 PGA Championship, contested from September 16‚Äì20 at the Herbert Strong- designed Engineers Country Club in Roslyn Harbor, New York, Sylvester made it into the round of 32. He then lost his next match to Otto Hackbarth by the margin of 5 and 4. His final placement was a tie for 17th. He won $50 in prize money. 1920 PGA Championship Sylvester had his best major championship finish in the 1920 PGA Championship which was played from August 17‚Äì21 at the Flossmoor Country Club outside Flossmoor, Illinois, a suburb south of Chicago. The field of 32 golfers qualified by sectional tournaments. They then competed in 36-hole match play rounds in a single-elimination tournament. Sylvester opened up play with a first round victory over Tom Boyd, winning 4 and 3. In the next round, however, he lost convincingly to James Douglas Edgar by the score of 11 and 9. Sylvester's final position in the tournament was a tie for ninth place, winning $60. 1921 PGA Championship In the 1921 PGA Championship, held September 27 to October 1 at the Inwood Country Club in Inwood, New York, Sylvester again made it into the round of 32. He lost in the first round to Emmett French 8 and 7, finishing in a tie for 17th place. He won $50 in prize money. Death and legacy Sylvester died on October 28, 1976, presumably in New York state. Sylvester was a frequent competitor in both the U.S. Open and the PGA Championship. He was granted a patent for a golf club design in 1937.

She was also a film actress, writer, and painter. She starred in the highly popular films Liu Qiao'er (1956) and Flowers as Matchmakers (1964), both adapted from her operas. Xin was married to Wu Zuguang, a prominent playwright and an outspoken critic of government policies. When Wu was denounced as a \\"rightist\\" in Mao Zedong's Anti-Rightist Campaign, Xin refused to divorce him and was herself denounced as a result. She was later severely persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, becoming disabled after a beating and was later paralyzed due to a stroke. No longer able to perform, she dedicated the remainder of her life to teaching, writing, and painting. She studied painting with her godfather Qi Baishi, a master of Chinese painting, and studied writing with her husband. She published a two- million-word memoir, which has been translated into English and Urdu. Xin Fengxia pioneered her own style of pingju, now called the \\"Xin\\" (which also means \\"new\\") style. It has become one of the most important styles of the opera. In 2014, the China Pingju Institute created the new pingju opera Xin Fengxia to commemorate her life. Early life and career Xin Fengxia was born in Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. When she was a toddler she was sold by human smugglers to Tianjin in northern China, and was given the name Yang Shumin (). She was trained as an opera performer from a young age. At that time, the theatrical world in China was controlled by gangsters. Actors, even renowned performers, had little personal freedom. She originally trained for Peking opera under her \\"older sister\\" Yang Jinxiang, but later changed to pingju. She toured extensively, and by the 1940s, her fame had rivalled well known female stars such as Liu Cuixia, Bai Yushuang, and Fu Ronghua. Xin Fengxia in Liu Qiao'er After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Xin moved to Beijing. Her first performance, in the modern pingju Little Erhei's Marriage, was well liked and attracted the attention of the original novelist Zhao Shuli and the well known writer Lao She. Her next performance, in Liu Qiao'er, was even more successful, making her a household name in China. In the opera Flowers as Matchmakers (Hua Wei Mei), she transformed the traditional melancholy tunes of pingju into joyous ones, and enriched the pingju repertoire by creating many new melodies. It is now considered a classic of the Xin style pingju. Liu Qiao'er was made into a film in 1956, which was followed by Flowers as Matchmakers in 1964. Both starred Xin and were extremely popular. Premier Zhou Enlai and his wife Deng Yingchao were both her fans. Zhou once said: \\"I can live without tea for three days, but not without watching Xin Fengxia.\\" Marriage and persecution In 1951, Lao She introduced Xin Fengxia to the famous playwright Wu Zuguang. Like many intellectuals at the time, Wu held high hopes for the new People's Republic and returned to China from British Hong Kong. Xin, who had acted in one of Wu's plays, admired his talent. They married that year, despite the fact that they were from differing socioeconomic backgrounds; she had no formal education and was nearly illiterate, while he was from a prominent family of scholars. Wu helped her to study reading, writing, and calligraphy. She also studied painting with Qi Baishi, one of the most celebrated masters of Chinese painting, who took her as his goddaughter. Xin Fengxia and Wu Zuguang Wu Zuguang, an outspoken critic of government cultural policies, was denounced in 1957 as a \\"rightist\\" in Mao Zedong's Anti-Rightist Campaign, and was sent to the Great Northern Wilderness in Heilongjiang to be \\"reformed through labour.\\" Xin was pressured to divorce her husband, but refused. Citing a legendary love story from one of her operas, she said \\"Wang Baochuan waited 18 years for Xue Pinggui, and I will wait 28 years for Wu Zuguang.\\" As a result, she was herself labeled a rightist and went through struggle sessions. Wu returned to Beijing after three years of hard labour, but six years later, China fell into the even greater turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, which began in 1966. Xin Fengxia and Wu Zuguang were both denounced at the beginning of the period. She was severely beaten by a junior actor of the China Pingju Institute; her left knee was broken and she never fully recovered from the injury. The couple's friend Lao She drowned himself after being similarly tortured. After her beating Xin served seven years of forced labour. In December 1975, she became paralyzed after suffering a stroke. Wu took care of her for the rest of her life. Post-Cultural Revolution After the Cultural Revolution, Xin Fengxia was politically rehabilitated in 1979, but was unable to return to the stage because of her disability. Her performance in Flowers as Matchmakers in 1964 proved to be her last. She devoted her energy to writing, painting, and training the younger generation of pingju performers. In 1997, she published her two-million-word memoir, which has been translated into English and Urdu. Ye Shengtao, the renowned writer and publisher, greatly encouraged her to write. He composed two poems praising her courage and talent. Her paintings, which were decorated with her husband's calligraphy, were also popular, and an exhibition of them was held at the China Military Museum in 1994. She was elected as a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In April 1998, while visiting Changzhou, her husband's hometown, she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. She was sent to Changzhou No. 1 People's Hospital, where she died after a week, on 12 April 1998. Legacy Family portrait Xin Fengxia and Wu Zuguang had three children. Their son, Wu Huan, is also a writer, painter, and calligrapher. After the deaths of Xin in 1998 and of Wu Zuguang in 2003, he organized the exhibition \\"A Hundred Years of the Wu Family\\" at the Poly Art Museum in Beijing. It was also shown in France, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The \\"Xin\\" style of pingju pioneered by Xin Fengxia has become one of the most important styles of the opera. In 2014, the China Pingju Institute created a new opera entitled Xin Fengxia to commemorate her life, with focuses on her reformation of the opera, and the love story of Xin and Wu. It is written by Huang Weiruo (), and directed by Guo Xiaonan ().

The statement then became an official slogan for the Iranian Revolution which resulted in the establishment of an Islamic Republic under Khomeini's rule.  Application  Responding to Iran's request for extradition of the Shah of Iran Muhammad Reza Pahlavi, the President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, provided for the Shah's travel plans to Panama with the deliberate intention of eliminating the possibility of the extradition in exchange for hostages who were held by the revolutionary Iran for 444 days (November 4, 1979, to January 20, 1981) after a group of Iranian revolutionary students affiliated with Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line broke into and entered the Embassy of the United States of America in Tehran, and took its diplomatic staff hostage, in contravention of international law, in response to the US providing political asylum for the Shah. A week after the incident, the sheets and finances of Iran were confiscated by US.

The media also provides a habitat for aerobic bacteria and composting earthworms that purify the wastewater by removing pathogens and oxygen demand. The \\"trickling action\\" of the wastewater through the media dissolves oxygen into the wastewater, ensuring the treatment environment is aerobic for rapid decomposition of organic substances. Vermifilters are most commonly used for sewage treatment and for agro- industrial wastewater treatment. Vermifilters can be used for primary, secondary and tertiary treatment of sewage, including blackwater and greywater in on-site systems and municipal wastewater in large centralised systems. Vermifilters are used where wastewater requires treatment before being safely discharged into the environment. Treated effluent is disposed of to either surface or subsurface leach fields. Solid material (such as fecal matter and toilet paper) is retained, de-watered and digested by bacteria and earthworms into humus that is integrated into the filtration media. The liquid passes through the filtration media where the attached aerobic microorganisms biodegrade pathogens and other organic compounds, resulting in treated wastewater. Vermifiltration is a low cost aerobic wastewater treatment option. Because energy is not required for aeration, vermifilters can be considered \\"passive treatment\\" systems (pumps may be required if gravity flow is not possible). Another advantage is the high treatment efficiency given the low space requirement. Terminology Alternative terms used to describe the vermifiltration process include aerobic biodigester, biological filter with earthworms, or wet vermicomposting. The treatment system may be described using terms such as vermi-digester and vermi-trickling filter. When this kind of sanitation system is used to treat only the mixture of excreta and water from flush toilets or pour flush toilets (called blackwater) then the term \\"toilet\\" is added to the name of the process, such as vermifilter toilet. Overview Vermifiltration was first advocated by researchers at the University of Chile in 1992 as a low cost sustainable technology suitable for decentralised sewage treatment in rural areas.Meiyan Xing, Xiaowei Li and Jian Yang. Treatment performance of small-scale vermifilter for domestic wastewater and its relationship to earthworm growth, reproduction and enzymatic activity, African Journal of Biotechnology, November 2010 Vermifilters offer treatment performance similar to conventional decentralised wastewater treatment systems but with potentially higher hydraulic processing capacities. Vermifilters are a type of wastewater treatment biofilter or trickling filter but with the addition of earthworms to improve treatment efficiency. Vermifilters provide an aerobic environment and wet substrate that facilitates microorganism growth as a biofilm. Microorganisms perform biochemical degradation of organic matter present in wastewater. Earthworms regulate microbial biomass and activity by directly or/and indirectly grazing on microorganisms.Jiang, L., Liu, Y., Hu, X., Zeng, G., Wang, H., Zhou, L., Tan, X., Huang, B., Liu, S., Liu, S., 2016. The use of microbial-earthworm ecofilters for wastewater treatment with special attention to influencing factors in performance: A review. Bioresour. Technol. 200, 999‚Äì1007 Biofilm and organic matter consumed by composting earthworms is then digested into biologically inert castings (humus).Liu, J., Lu, Z., Yang, J., Xing, M., Yu, F., Guo, M., 2012. Effect of earthworms on the performance and microbial communities of excess sludge treatment process in vermifilter. Bioresour. Technol. 117, 214‚Äì21 The vermicast is incorporated into the media substrate, slowly increasing its volume. As this builds up it can be removed and applied to soil as an amendment to improve soil fertility and structure. Microorganisms present are heterotrophic and autotrophic. Heterotrophic microorganisms are important in oxidising carbon (decomposition) whereas autotrophic microorganisms are important in nitrification. As a result of oxidation reactions, biodegradation and microbial stimulation by enzymatic action, organic matter decomposition and pathogen destruction occurs in the vermifilter. In a study where municipal wastewater was treated in a vermifilter, removal ratios for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) were 90%, chemical oxygen demand (COD) 85%, total suspended solids (TSS) 98%, ammonia nitrogen 75% and fecal coliforms eliminated to a level that meets World Health Organisation guidelines for safe re-use in crops.  Process types  Vermifilters can be used for primary, secondary and tertiary treatment of blackwater and greywater.  Primary treatment of blackwater  Primary treatment domestic vermifilter with solids pile on surface (comprising feces and toilet paper) sitting on vermicast humus substrate (1m2 surface area) Vermifilters can be used for aerobic primary treatment of domestic blackwater.Rajiv K. Sinha, Gokul Bharambe, Uday Chaudhari. Sewage treatment by vermifiltration with synchronous treatment of sludge by earthworms: a low-cost sustainable technology over conventional systems with potential for decentralization, Environmentalist, 2008 28:409-420 Untreated blackwater enters a ventilated enclosure above a bed of filter medium. Solids accumulate on the surface of the filter bed while liquid drains through the filter medium and is discharged from the reactor. The solids (feces and toilet paper) are aerobically digested by aerobic bacteria and composting earthworms into castings (humus), thereby significantly reducing the volume of organic material. Twin chamber constructed primary treatment vermifilter fed by a domestic flush toilet. Primary treatment vermifilter reactors are designed to digest solid material, such as contained in raw sewage. Twin-chamber parallel reactors offer the advantage of resting one reactor while the other is active, to facilitate hygienic removal of humus with reduced pathogen levels. Worms actively digest the solid organic material. An equilibrium is reached whereby volume digested by a stable population of worms matches the input volume of solid waste. Seasonal and environmental factors (such as temperature) and variable influent volumes can cause buildup of solid waste as a pile. Although oxygen is excluded from the centre of this \\"wet\\" compost pile, worms work from the outside in and introduce air as necessary into the pile to meet their nutritional requirements. This food resource buffer ensures primary treatment vermifilters have a level of resilience and reliability, provided space is provided for a pile to build up. There is some evidence that the wet environment facilitates digestion of solid waste by worms.C. Furlong, W. T. Gibson, M. R. Templeton, M. Taillade, F. Kassam, G. Crabb, R. Goodsell, J. McQuilkin, A. Oak, G. Thakar, M. Kodgire, R. Patankar. The development of an onsite sanitation system based on vermifiltration: the \\"Tiger Toilet\\", Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development, January 2015 The volume of vermicast humus increases only slowly and occasionally needs to be removed from the primary treatment reactor. Primary treatment of wet mixed blackwater can also include greywater containing food solids, grease and other biodegradable waste. Solid material is reduced to stable humus (wormcastings), with volume reductions of up to tenfold.C. Furlong, M.R. Templeton, W.T. Gibson. Processing of human faeces by wet vermifiltration for improved on-site sanitation, Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development 4(2):231, June 2014 The process produces primary treated blackwater, with much of the solid organic material removed from the effluent. Because liquid effluent is discharged almost immediately on entering the digester, little dissolved oxygen is consumed by the wastewater through the filtration stage. However, oxygen demand is leached into the wastewater flow through the filter as worms digest retained solids.Taylor, M. Clarke, W. P., Greenfield, P. F. The treatment of domestic wastewater using small-scale vermicompost filter beds, Journal of Ecological Engineering, December 2003 21: 197‚Äì203 This oxygen demand can be removed with secondary treatment vermifilter reactors. Primary treatment vermifilters provide a similar level of liquid effluent treatment to a septic tank,A.S. Molla , P. O. Antwi , R.A. Buamah , H.M. Essandoh , E. Awuah The Potential of Subsurface Infiltration for the Treatment of Biofil Toilet Technology Effluent, Management Studies, December 2015 but in less time because digestion of solids by worms takes place rapidly in the aerobic environment. The liquid effluent is either discharged directly to a drain field or undergoes secondary treatment before being used for surface irrigation of soil. Secondary treatment Secondary treatment domestic vermifilter for wastewater showing drippers Secondary and tertiary treatment vermifilters can be underneath the primary vermifilter in a single tower but are typically single reactors, where several reactors can be chained in series as sequential vermifilters. Drainage within the reactor is provided by filter media packed according to the hydraulic conductivity and permeability of each material that is present within the vermifilter. The filter packing retains the solid particles present in the effluent wastewater, increases the hydraulic retention time and also provides a suitable habitat for sustaining a population of composting earthworms. This population requires adequate moisture levels within the filter media, but also adequate drainage and oxygen levels. Sprinklers or drippers can be used in secondary and tertiary treatment vermifilter reactors (see image). Hydraulic factors (hydraulic retention time, hydraulic loading rate and organic loading rate) and biological factors (earthworm numbers, levels of biofilm) can influence treatment efficiency.  Design  Vermifilters are enclosed reactors made from durable materials that eliminate vermin entry, usually plastic or concrete. Ventilation must be sufficient to ensure an aerobic environment for the worms and microorganisms, while also inhibiting entry of unwanted flies. Temperature within the reactor needs to be maintained within a range suitable for the species of compost worms used.  Influent entry  Influent entry is from above the filter media. Full-flush toilets can have the entry point into the side of the reactor, whereas micro-flush toilets, because these do not provide sufficient water to convey solids through sewer pipes, are generally installed directly above the reactor. For primary treatment reactors, sufficient vertical space must be provided for growth of the pile. This is dependent on volume of solids in the influent and decomposition rate. Secondary and tertiary treatment reactors can use sprinklers or tricklers to distribute the influent wastewater evenly over the filter media to improve treatment efficiency of the filter media.  Sections  Vermifilter reactors may have three different filter sections: an organic filter as the top layer that provides habitat for the earthworms; the inorganic or inert filter - constituting a layer of gravel and a layer of sand; and the drainage layer or equalizer (a sump where the treated effluent is discharged and/or recirculated to the top of the reactor). The filter media may be suspended above a sump in a basket. Alternatively the filter media might sit on a drainage layer of coarse gravel or pervious plastic drainage coil. Synthetic geotextile cloth is used to retain the filter media in place above the drainage layer. To remain aerobic, adequate ventilation must be provided, along with an outlet for the liquid effluent to drain away.  Filter substrate  Drainage within the vermifilter reactor is provided by the filter media. The filter media has the dual purpose of retaining the solid organic material while also providing a habitat suitable for sustaining a population of composting worms. This population requires adequate moisture levels within the media, along with good drainage and aerobic conditions. Common filter packing materials include sawdust,Arora, S., Rajpal, A., Kumar, T., Bhargava, R., Kazmi, A.A., 2014. Pathogen removal during wastewater treatment by vermifiltration. Environ. Technol. 35, 2493‚Äì2499.Arora, S., Rajpal, A., Kazmi, A.A., 2016. Antimicrobial Activity of Bacterial Community for Removal of Pathogens during Vermifiltration. J. Environ. Eng. 142 (5). wood chips, coir, bark, peat, and straw for organic packing. Gravel, quartz sand, river bed gravel, pumice, mud balls, glass balls, ceramsite and charcoal are commonly used for inert packing. Surface area and porosity of filter packing materials influence treatment performance.Dahab, M.F. 1982 Effect of media design on the performance of fixed-bed anaerobic filters. Water Science & Technology, 15, 369‚Äì383. Thus materials with low granulometry and large surface area may improve the performance of the vermifilter. Sizing  Vermifilters can be constructed as single tower systems, or separate staged reactors (either gravity or pump operated) for the treatment of wastewater according to design requirements (primary, secondary, tertiary treatment).

A comparative study for pathogen removal using different filter media during vermifiltration. Water Sci. Technol. 70, 996‚Äì1003. and organic loading rate. Hydraulic retention time and hydraulic loading rate both affect treatment and effluent quality. Hydraulic retention time is the actual time the wastewater is in contact with the filter media and is related to the depth of the vermifilter (which may increase over time due to the accumulation of earthworm vermicastings), reactor volume and type of material used (porosity). The hydraulic retention time determines wastewater inflow rate (hydraulic loading as influent volume per hour). In principle, provided the environment is aerobic, the longer the wastewater remains inside the filter, the greater the BOD5 and COD removal efficiency will be, but at the expense of hydraulic loading. Wastewater requires sufficient contact time with the biofilm to allow for the adsorption, transformation, and reduction of contaminants.Hughes, R.J., Nair, J., Ho, G., 2008. The toxicity of ammonia/ammonium to the vermifiltration wastewater treatment process. Water Sci. Technol. 58, 1215‚Äì20. Hydraulic loading rate is an essential design parameter and equates to the volume and of wastewater that a vermifilter can reasonably treat in a given time. For a given system, higher hydraulic loading rates will cause hydraulic retention time to decrease and therefore reduce level of treatment. Hydraulic loading rate may depend on parameters such as structure, effluent quality and bulk density of filter packing, along with method of effluent application.Siegrist, R.L., 1987. Soil Clogging During Subsurface Wastewater Infiltration as Affected by Effluent Composition and Loading Rate. J. Environ. Qual. 16(2): 181-187.

Common densities vary between 10 g L‚àí1 and 40 g L‚àí1 per filter packing material.Tomar, P., Suthar, S., 2011. Urban wastewater treatment using vermi-biofiltration system.

Water Res. 44(8), 2572‚Äì82. An abundance of earthworms improves treatment efficiency, in particular BOD5, TSS and NH4+ removal. This is because earthworms release organic matter into the filter media and stimulate nitrogen mineralization. Earthworm castings may have substances which contribute to higher BOD5 removal.Louren√ßo, N., Nunes, L.M., Submitted. Optimization of a vermifiltration process for treating urban wastewater. Ecological Engineering. Operation and maintenance Sawdust Shredded olive branches A vermifilter has low mechanical and manual maintenance requirements, and, where gravity operated, requires no energy input. Recirculation, if required for improved effluent quality, would require a pump. An annual application of dry organic materials on the top of the filter media may be required for secondary and tertiary treatment vermifilters. The volume of vermicast increases only slowly and occasionally vermicompost needs to be removed from the vermifilter. Solids accumulate on the surface of the organic filter media (or filter packing). The liquid fraction drains through the medium into the sump or equaliser and is either discharged from the reactor or recirculated to the top entry for further treatment. Wastewater is discharged to the surface of the filter packing by direct application or by sprinklers, drippers or tricklers. Examples * A household pour flush toilet combined with primary vermifiltration and direct effluent soakage to soil, called the \\"Tiger Toilet\\", has been tested by Bear Valley Ventures and Primove Infrastructure Development Consultants in rural India. Unlike in a pit latrine, it was found that there was virtually no accumulation of fecal material over a one-year period. In the effluent there was a 99% reduction in fecal coliforms. User satisfaction was high, driven mainly by a lack of odour. This system is now being marketed commercially in India where over 2000 of these toilets and treatment systems had been sold and installed by May 2017. * \\"Tiger worm toilets\\" are also being promoted by Oxfam as a sanitation solution in refugee camps, slums and peri-urban areas in Africa, for example in Liberia. * Low-flush vermifilter toilet systems with direct subsoil soakage are being marketed in Ghana and other African countries by the Ghana Sustainable Aid Project (GSAP) with support by Providence College in the U.S. and the University of Ghana. * Biofilcom is a company active in Ghana which is marketing the process under the name of \\"Biofil Digester\\". * In Australia and New Zealand, there are numerous suppliers offering vermifilter systems for domestic greywater and/or blackwater treatment, with primary treated effluent disposal to subsurface leach fields.

They competed against other military teams, and also won some semi-professional tournaments. While in the military, Dugan had surgery to remove warts on his feet; this led to an infection, and caused him to walk with a limp for the rest of his life. After the war, Dugan returned to the University of Kansas, where he served as head coach of the baseball team in 1946. The team had a record of 4‚Äì6, playing all of their games within the Big Six Conference, and finishing in fifth place in the conference. Dugan earned a degree in physical education and became a teacher. He later worked in Hiawatha, Kansas, for 30 years as a coach and teacher. He also served in the Kansas National Guard until 1968. Dugan died in Hiawatha in 1992. He was a widower, and was survived by a daughter.

OATH is composed of the:New York City Charter ¬ß 659(a); \\"There shall be an independent board of standards and appeals located within the office of administrative trials and hearings.

Although the ECB is empowered to impose penalties under the New York City Charter and has promulgated penalty schedules, the ECB is in the process of repealing all penalty schedules in its rules so that they can be relocated to the rules of the enforcement agencies with primary rulemaking and policymaking jurisdiction with the expertise to adopt appropriate penalties to address violations, and help clarify to the public that OATH ECB is a neutral third party that hears and tries cases brought by other City agencies and is not an enforcement agency.OATH ECB Proposed Repeal of the Noise Code Penalty ScheduleOATH ECB Proposed Repeal of Parks' Penalty Schedule Procedure Unlike state criminal courts (such as the New York City Criminal Court), OATH does not guarantee a right to counsel, a fine is the most serious outcome, and a failure to appear results in a default judgment not an arrest warrant. When an individual or business is fined and does not attend a hearing of the Environmental Control Board (ECB) or pay within the required time period, the ECB adds a penalty and oversees interest. Related courts OATH adjudicates for all city agencies unless otherwise provided for by executive order, rule, law or pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. However, except as to issues involving employee discipline, OATH hearings are the exception rather than the rule. In 2003, New York City had roughly 61 city agencies employing an estimated 500 lawyers as administrative law judges and/or hearing officers/examiners. Non-OATH tribunals that also operate in New York City include: * The city DOF Parking Adjudications Division (Parking Violations Bureau) adjudicates parking violations. * The state DMV Traffic Violations Bureau adjudicates non-parking traffic violations. * The city Tax Appeals Tribunal adjudicates disputes regarding city-administered taxes other than real estate assessment claims, which are adjudicated by the city Tax Commission. The New York City Criminal Court and New York City Civil Court are part of the New York State Unified Court System. History OATH was created by Mayor Ed Koch with Executive Order 32 on July 25, 1979, and by an amendment to the New York City Charter at the general election on November 8, 1988.

The embroidery, which has a fine finish, appears like a woven cloth but is made with use of red and black threads with a white cotton cloth background. Both sides of the embroidered fabric are usable and the Toda people are proud of this heritage. Both men and women adorn themselves with the embroidered cloaks and shawls. This handicraft product is listed as a geographically tagged product and is protected under the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration & Protection) Act (GI Act) 1999 of the Government of India. It was registered by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under the title \\"Toda Embroidery\\" and recorded at GI Application number 135 under Class 24, Class 25, and Class 26 as Textiles and Textile Goods, clothing, and Embroidery, respectively, in March 2013. A certificate of the GI registration was formally presented to the community leaders in June 2013. This was first initiated in 2008 and the agencies who supported this registration are the Toda Nalavaazhvu Sangam, Keystone Foundation, and Poompuhar. Location This art heritage is practiced by the Toda tribals based in the Nilgiris (literally meaning 'neelam', the \\"Blue Hills\\") located in an elevation range of . History The Todas (also known by names such as Tudas, Tudavans, and Todar) who make this embroidery live as one small community, population of 1,600 spread over 69 settlements, and about 400 of them are stated to be engaged in the embroidery work) in the Nilgiri Hills in the higher elevations of the Niligiri plateau, in Tamil Nadu. Apart from their vocation as herdsmen of buffaloes and cultivation in the grass lands, they are also involved in the tradition of making many handicrafts items which includes traditional black and red embroidery practiced by the women of the community; the embroidery is usually made on their cloaks called \\"pootkhul(zh)y\\" which is draped by both their men and women. Murray Emeneau, a well known linguist of the Toda language, had referred to nine Toda embroidery designs in his paper published in 1937. There are earlier mention in the ancient ethnographic documents of the Toda women working on this art form in the western region of the Nilgiri plateau. Production process The local terms used to describe the embroidery work are 'kuty' or 'awtty' meaning \\"stitching\\" and 'kutyvoy' meaning the embroidered piece. The materials used in this work are roughly woven white cloth, woolen black and red threads with use occasionally of blue threads and manufactured needles. The designs developed relate to nature and the daily cycle of life. The fabric used is coarse bleached half white cotton cloth with bands; the woven bands on the fabric consist of two bands, one in red and one band in black, spaced at six inches. Embroidery is limited to the space within the bands and is done by using a single stitch darning needle. It is not done within an embroidery frame but is done by counting the warp and weft on the fabric which has uniform structure by the reverse stitch method. To bring out a rich texture in the embroidered fabric, during the process of needle stitching, a small amount of tuft is deliberately allowed to bulge. Geometric pattern is achieved by counting the warp and weft in the cloth used for embroidery. Though their favorite study is related floral landscape, the patterns used in Toda embroidery do not cover many floral motifs but generally cover celestial bodies (like Sun and Moon), reptiles, animals, and horns of buffaloes, made in crimson and black colours. Rabbit ears are a constant depiction on the boundary of the embroidered cloth. Another common design in the form of black triangles in a box design is done in honour of their first priest. Women who do embroidery consider their work as a \\"tribute to Nature\\". A dead body is always wrapped in an embroidered fabric with traditional designs and then buried. However, coloured stripes are used in fabrics of daily use. As a traditional garment, it is worn by both men and women at all ceremonial occasions and also at funerals. Elderly people of the community wear this cloth daily. The inspecting agency to oversee the quality of embroidery is the Textile Committee of the Ministry of Textiles of the Government of India.

Nazeem Hussain later beat Laurina with 14 trials. * Brendan also won a special red star in this tucker trial. The red star, which was another world-first record, gave the celebrities several condiments to add flavor to their meal *All of the celebrities failed at trying to receive a star, but Julia Morris tried a go at receiving at least one star for the campers, unfortunately she also failed but the campers received three stars anyway Celebrity Chest Challenges Two or more celebrities are chosen to take part in the \\"Celebrity Chest\\" challenge to win luxuries for camp.

Haley described his releases as Com Truise as parts of a story about the world's first \\"Synthetic Astronaut\\" on his adventure to a planet, and Wave 1 is where he lands on a kind-of replica of Earth. Musically, Haley had to get inspiration from several artists as this part of the story is also where the music starts to change. The EP is a combination of styles including synth soul, drum and bass, synth funk and electro, and retains the bright and danceable vibe from Com Truise's debut album Galactic Melt (2011). Promoted with two pre-EP track releases, a music video for the track \\"Subsonic\\" and a February‚ÄìMarch 2014 tour, the EP was issued on the Ghostly International label in February 2014 to generally positive reviews, with critics praising the record's creativity. Commercially, it also landed in the top ten of the American Billboard Dance/Electronic and Heatseekers album charts. Background and composition In a June 2013 Twitter post, Seth Haley said he wrote Wave 1 without knowing it was a reflection of how he was living in the few months of his life before. He started taking care of his health, suffered through an ended relationship, and relocated to Brooklyn. He said that despite not usually revealing his personal life publicly, he said in an interview that when he makes his music, : \\"it's always just there, and it happens, but I don't focus on it. My music's all based on this story about an android that travels to this other planet. So I'm not really writing about myself, but then I realized I have been all along. It's all been about me.\\" Maintaining the bright and danceable feel from Com Truise's 2011 debut studio album Galactic Melt and garnering more of a melodic approach than previous releases of the project, Wave 1 is a combination of synth soul, drum and bass, synth funk, electro, and, in the words of a Pitchfork Media reviewer, \\"fussy 80s computer-pop\\". Seth Haley has described the character of Com Truise as the first ever \\"Synthetic Astronaut\\", and each release under the name shows the next part in this voyage to a planet. Wave 1 is a part of the story where he lands on a sort-of replica of Earth, and Haley thought there was \\"something eerie about it, something familiar but something peculiar as well.\\" Because this was also meant to be a part of the story where the music starts changing, he had taken inspiration from several acts including New Order and Prince to have a much broader range of tempos and styles in each track. Tracks The opener \\"Wasat\\" sets the scene of the story, starting with a short, atmospheric prelude before it moves into \\"an uptempo, hypercolor groove\\". The \\"VHS-quality dubstep\\" track \\"Mind\\" is where the record gets suspenseful, as the drums \\"threaten\\" to become, but doesn't entirely become, a fully developed hard-hitting four-on-the-floor beat. These two tracks were described by a Spectrum Culture critic as \\"a practice in coalescence; taking a moment to take shape and then defying one another‚Äôs difference until they too find their peaceful plane of existence.\\" The most melodic track on the EP, \\"Declination\\", as well as probably the \\"most straightforwardly melodic\\" cut in Com Truise's discography as of the release of the EP, \\"glides into your headphones like a starship slipping down out of hyperspace\\", featuring vocals of Joel Ford from the projects Ford & Lopatin, Airbird and Young Ejecta. As a reviewer analyzed, the track opens as \\"spine- tingling sci-fi dissonance\\" before turning into a 1980s-esque new wave song. Wave 1 decreases its tensions on \\"Subsonic\\", which goes through several \\"movements\\" of slow-building, evocative sounds, including a \\"hell of a squelchy bass\\", that the press release analogized to be \\"soundtracking\\" the creation of new stars. This evocative vibe continues into \\"Valis Called (Control)\\", its title referencing the works of one of the considered \\"gods of this retro synth phenomenon\\" Philip K. Dick, followed by the \\"futuristic R&B;\\" song \\"Meserere Mei\\", a track consisting of broken drum beats and spiky synth sounds. The Jamie xx-style title track of Wave 1 calmly ends the EP as the lead melody drifts far away into several \\"zipping\\" sci-fi textures and \\"clustered percussion.\\" Promotion and release The lead single for Wave 1 was \\"Declination\\", released on December 3, 2013. On January 23, 2014, \\"Subsonic\\" premiered on the website of Spin magazine, which announced the EP's track list and a North American tour promoting the record that lasted from February 11 to March 15. The EP was officially distributed on the Ghostly International label on February 18. On April 14, Vice magazine's electronic music channel Thump premiered the video for \\"Subsonic\\". Directed by Hans Lo, Thump summarized that the video \\"jacks us into a William Gibson novel, leading us through the gridded passages of the Information Superhighway.\\"Tucker, Graham (April 14, 2014). \\"Com Truise's New Video is More Sci-Fi Than Scientology\\". Thump. Vice. Retrieved January 31, 2016. Critical reception Wave 1 received generally positive reviews upon its release; the EP holds a weighted mean of an aggregate 69 out of 100 from Metacritic based on six reviews, indicating that, according to the site, the album's critical reception was favorable in general. Daniel Sylvester of Exclaim! called the EP \\"looser, more focused and much more imaginative\\" that Com Truise's past work, writing that while the artist has yet to make \\"a truly transcendent piece of art, Wave 1 shows the young beatmaker in transition, fearlessly searching for his definitive sound.\\" Similarly, Sputnikmusic reviewer hyperion praised Wave 1 for making a unique new sound with the chillwave palette instead of having limits from the genre, assuming that it could've been the peak of the microgenre if the record's other songs were as good as \\"Valis Called (Control)\\" and \\"Subsonic\\". Mark Jenkins reviewed it for The Washington Post, and mainly highlighted its unpredictable melodic and rhythmic moments, while Pat Levy, reviewing for Consequence of Sound, honored Haley for getting out of his comfort zone while still having the same sounds and style of his past records. Pitchfork Media's Paul Thompson liked the EP as \\"a mostly welcome return,\\" but criticized its focus of having perfectly-detailed sound instead of new musical ideas. In more mixed reviews, Derek Staples, writing for the site Spectrum Culture, wrote that with Wave 1, the artist was starting to lose his \\"inventive edge\\" in trying to recreate the same sound of his past releases for nostalgic purposes. A NME critic praised the sounds on the EP, but called it more \\"disjointed\\" and \\"disorienting\\" than his past albums due to its \\"abrasive\\" and glitchy sound and lack of a \\"steady groove.\\" A reviewer for the magazine XLR8R wrote that Wave 1 may interest listeners, but also was an indication Com Truise's creativity may decline with releases in his later career.

The building is close to the Church of Saint Mary Magdalen.  History and Description  Oratorio San Bartolomeo plaque The structure, named after Saint Bartholomew the Apostle, was built during the 15th century in the historic centre near the Church of Saint Mary Magdalen. The oratory underwent several changes, of which the most significant was in 1670. It is a single rectangular room decorated with a valuable organ purchased in 1804 by the organist of Oneglia Luigi Niggi. On the four walls of the room are four statues representing the four doctors of the Church: Ambrose, Gregory, Augustine and Jerome. The author is uncertain, it might be either Peter Notari or Peter Lucchesi. On the altar is a wooden statue of Saint Bartholomew, made by the Genoese Agostino Vignola in 1865. Behind it one can admire a painting of the eighteenth century The Virgin and Child, St. John, St. Bartholomew and St. Benedict. On the sides, there are two scenes of Life of St. Bartholomew, and on the ceiling a great image of the saint painted by the Roman Ernesto Sprega in 1892. Sprega was known at the time for his work at the palace chapel of the Prince's Palace of Monaco, dedicated to John the Baptist. The oratory is famous, as documented by a plaque on the facade, for the meeting of March 3, 1673 when representatives of the towns of Camporosso, Vallecrosia, San Biagio della Cima, Soldano, Borghetto San Nicol√≤, Vallebona, Sasso and Bordighera agreed on the separation from Ventimiglia and the establishment of the Magnificent Community of Eight Places .

He worked for The Wall Street Journal for 20 years between 1999 and 2019 and has been based in Brussels, Paris, and New York City. He has won the Pulitzer Prize twice and is well known for having exposed the fraudulent practices of the multibillion- dollar blood-testing company Theranos in a series of articles published in the Journal.  Early life and career  John Carreyrou was born to French journalist and an American mother. He grew up in Paris. Carreyrou graduated from Duke University in 1994 with a B.A. in political science and government. After graduation, he joined the Dow Jones Newswires. In 1999, he joined The Wall Street Journal Europe at Brussels. In 2001, he moved to Paris to cover French business and other topics such as terrorism. In 2003, he was appointed the deputy bureau chief for Southern Europe. He covered French politics and business, Spain, and Portugal. By 2008, he was the deputy bureau chief and later bureau chief of the health and science bureau in New York. In late 2015, Carreyrou began a series of investigative articles on Theranos, the blood- testing start-up founded by Elizabeth Holmes, that questioned its claim to be able to run a wide range of lab tests from a tiny sample of blood from a finger prick. Holmes had turned to Rupert Murdoch, whose media empire includes Carreyrou's employer, The Wall Street Journal, to kill the story. Murdoch, who became the biggest investor in Theranos in 2015 as a result of his $125 million injection, refused the request from Holmes saying that \\"he trusted the paper's editors to handle the matter fairly\\". In May 2018, Carreyrou's book- length treatment of the topic Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup was published by Knopf. Carreyrou also features prominently in a documentary about Theranos called The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley. In August 2019, Carreyrou left the Wall Street Journal opting for paid speaking engagements that are banned by the newspaper. For future plans he commented \\"I want to keep writing non-fiction books for the second part of my career\\".  Awards  In 2003, Carreyrou shared the Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting with a team of Wall Street Journal reporters for a series of stories that exposed corporate scandals in America. Carreyrou co- authored the article Damage Control: How Messier Kept Cash Crisis at Vivendi Hidden for Months, published Oct. 31, 2002. In 2003, Carreyrou won the German Marshall Fund's Peter R. Weitz Junior Prize for excellence in reporting on European affairs for his detailed coverage of the downfall of Vivendi Universal SA and its chairman, Jean-Marie Messier. In 2004, Carreyrou shared the German Marshall Fund's Peter R. Weitz Senior Prize for excellence in reporting on European affairs with a team of six Wall Street Journal journalists. In the five-part series titled The Disintegration of the Trans- Atlantic Relationship over the Iraq War Carreyrou contributed the article In Normandy, U.S.-France Feud Cuts Deep. Published on February 24, 2003, while Carreyrou was based in Paris, the article explored how France's Normandy region, site of the D-Day landings, was caught between gratitude for the U.S. role in World War II and France's opposition to war in Iraq. In 2015, Carreyrou shared the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting and the Gerald Loeb Award for Investigative with a team of investigative reporters at The Wall Street Journal for \\"Medicare Unmasked\\", a project that forced the American government in 2014 to release important Medicare data kept secret for decades, and in a sweeping investigative series uncovered abuses that cost taxpayers billions. Carreyrou co-authored four articles in the series: Taxpayers face big tab for unusual doctor billings, A fast-growing medical lab tests anti-kickback law, Doctor 'self-referral' thrives on legal loophole and Sprawling medicare struggles to fight fraud. In 2016, Carreyrou received the 67th annual George Polk Awards in Journalism for Financial Reporting in 2015, and the Gerald Loeb Award for Beat Reporting. His investigation of Theranos, Inc. \\"raised serious doubts about claims by the firm and its celebrated 31-year-old founder, Elizabeth Holmes\\". According to Vanity Fair, \\"a damning report published in The Wall Street Journal had alleged that the company was, in effect, a sham\\". Carreyrou wrote the report. A book-length treatment titled Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup (2018) won the Financial Times and McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award. A film version is in the works starring Jennifer Lawrence, written by Vanessa Taylor, and directed by Adam McKay.  Personal life  He currently lives in Brooklyn, New York with his wife Molly Schuetz, an editor at Bloomberg Newshttps://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/05/john-carreyrous-new-book-on- silicon-valley-bad-blood.html, and their three children.

It serves primarily as an alternative route to get to and from the Downtown Los Angeles area and the San Gabriel Valley. Route Description South Mission Road begins as a very narrow street adjacent to the Los Angeles River, near the bridge of 7th Street over the river in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles. From then on, it goes northbound, crossing 4th Street and 1st Street. At the intersection of 1st Street (), the Metro L Line passes on 1st Street, with a station nearby. In less than 2 blocks, the Hollywood Freeway (US 101) passed above the street with on and off ramps. Shortly after, it intersects with Cesar Chavez Avenue. After crossing the intersection, it is labelled as North Mission Road, and follows a straight path towards the Golden State Freeway. At the intersections of Daly Street /Marengo Street, Mission Road divides the boundary limits of Lincoln Heights and Boyle Heights neighborhoods respectively. Mission Road is also the northern terminus for two of the city's major streets. Upon crossing a bridge, Valley Boulevard is the first intersection, then comes Main Street. The road will then pass Lincoln Park before reaching Broadway. A few blocks ahead marks the end of North Mission Road. History In 2004, a portion of the northern terminus in El Sereno known as the Soto Street Bridge, where Soto Street becomes Huntington Drive North, was declared functionally obsolete and scheduled for replacement. The bridge was constructed in 1936 as joint venture between the state, city and Pacific Electric Railway as an overpass of its Red Car system. Since 2015, Caltrans has been working on major upgrades for this intersection. Once finished, Mission Road Huntington Drive, & Soto Street will all meet in a \\"T\\" intersection. This will enhance local residents because there will be more sidewalks to walk on and reduce traffic gradually. Transportation *Metro Local lines 78, 79, and 378 provides service via Mission Road/Huntington Drive to Arcadia.

Cotton sarees with solid border and Pata Anchal, duppatta with typical Buties / motifs, Scolrfs on cotton, silk, handloom stoles, and dress materials are all dyed with organic dyes. The natural dye is manufactured from the aul tree grown in this area. The Kotpad tussar silk saree with tribal art and Kotpad handloom fabrics with natural color is its specialty. Kotpad handloom fabric is the first item from Odisha that received the Geographical Indication of India tag, in 2005. The Mirgan community of Kotpad is famous for their exquisite organic dyed textile. They usually weave this textile for \\"Bhotada\\", \\"Dharua\\" and other motifs of their neighboring tribal communities. Recently, Biswanath Rath, an Indian Writer-Director, has made an English Documentary titled 'Kotpad Weaving : The Story of a Race Against Time' about Kotpad Handloom, dyeing and weaving which has been produced by PSBT in association with Doordarshan. This documentary was telecasted on DD National on 24 March 2018. The film explores the uniqueness of Kotpad Handloom, the issues and possible solutions for revival of Kotpad Weaving and Dyeing. In 2018, Gobardhan Panika, one of the master weavers of the craft, was honored by the Government of India with the fourth highest civilian honor of the Padma Shri.  Raw materials  Cotton yarn, Tussar silk and Aul tree roots are the main materials used for textile work. Using organic dye is the most important aspect of these textile products. It takes approximately 15 to 30 days for processing the color and dyeing threads into different colors. The main colors extracted are black and maroon. Sarees and shawls are the most important and attractive textile products from the Kotpad weaving community. The textiles are very comfortable to wear during summer and winter.  Natural dye colour  The characteristics of natural dye colouring are derived from the aul tree or madder dye (Morinda citrifolia) extracted from the root of the Indian madder tree. Since it is prepared out of natural resources which are non- toxic, the dye is not harmful to the skin. Even though it is only a limited colour range, it is eco-friendly and shades developed are very suiting and pleasant. The colours ranging from deep maroon to dark brown depend on the age of the root bark and the proportion of the dye used and is obtained with the addition of harikari or iron sulphate. These colours mixed with the natural unbleached off-white color of the cotton yarn produce dramatic results. The motifs used on the fabric are conch, boat, axes, crab, bow, temple, fish, and fan, which reflect the culture of the area. These motifs are developed by the extra wefts. By use of multi-shuttle by interlocking method, a solid border effect of the fabric is brought up by the pig by pig insertion of thread.

Begun in 1998, it was publicly exposed in January 2016 as a result of documents released by Edward Snowden. It has been called the worst intelligence breach in Israel's history. The Operation The operation was run out of GCHQ headquarters in Cheltenham, with most of the surveillance taken from RAF Troodos, a Royal Air Force highly advanced and sophisticated communications and intelligence installation in the Troodos Mountains of Cyprus, with RAF Menwith Hill, a joint US-British satellite surveillance base in Britain, also participating. The Israeli Air Force's UAV fleet was its primary target. Encrypted video transmissions between drones and their bases were intercepted from Troodos and analyzed using powerful advanced computing systems, as well as the open-source software tools ImageMagick and AntiSky, which allow users to patiently sort through the pixels in order to decrypt them. This was the preferred method over using the massive computing power it would have taken to unscramble the encrypted signals in near real time. Some images were clearer than others, as the success of the decryption varied. The intercepted images were largely low-resolution analog feeds used to check the condition of the drones, allowing the NSA and GCHQ to see the payloads the drones were carrying, but not the actual surveillance data. Surveillance feeds were, however, sometimes captured from small Israeli drones. GCHQ and NSA also successfully breached the security of Israeli military and communication satellites which were encrypted. Capturing these videos became very difficult as Israel shifted to using digital video feeds mixed with other data, with a 2010 GCHQ report noting that it lacked the systems to properly monitor the new Israeli technological capabilities. In addition to footage from drone cameras, the operation also tracked the movements of Israeli drones, using the transmissions drones sent off to update their bases on their location. Satellite surveillance systems at Menwith Hill were used to intercept transmissions between Israeli drones and satellites, capturing 20 separate videos in all. Training missions, as well as operations over the Golan Heights were monitored, with Israeli preparations for a possible strike on Iran watched extremely closely. One leaked report noted that Israeli drones were also being monitored due to Israeli UAV exports to many other countries, and Yedioth Ahronoth noted that this, along with the great interest shown in precisely what radar was mounted on the drones, indicated a commercial interest in the drones in addition to a security interest. While drones were the primary target, on January 3, 2008, computer technicians from Menwith Hill managed to capture 14 seconds of cockpit footage from an Israeli F-16 fighter jet on a bombing mission over Gaza, showing a target on the ground being closely tracked. A sub-operation of Operation Anarchist, code-named Operation Runway, tracked the Israeli Black Sparrow air-launched missiles, which were used as targeting missiles during tests of the Arrow missile. In addition to Israel, advanced weapons systems used by Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah were also hacked into. In particular, the operation managed to obtain footage of Iranian-made drones operated by Hezbollah and Syrian Armed Forces. Exposure On January 28, 2016, The Intercept, Der Spiegel, and Yedioth Ahronoth jointly broke the story, based on documents provided by NSA leaker Edward Snowden. Israel announced that it was disappointed, but not surprised by the reports. An Israeli security official referred to Operation Anarchist as \\"an earthquake‚Ä¶ the worst leak in the history of Israeli intelligence.\\" References * US, UK spied on Israel's drone and missile programs * US and UK 'hacked into Israeli drones and planes' * NSA, GCHQ used open source software to spy on Israeli, Syrian drones * Hacked Images from Israel's Drone Fleet * Israeli Drone Feeds Hacked by British and American Intelligence * Israel 'disappointed, not surprised' by massive US, UK spying Category:Secret government programs Category:National Security Agency Category:GCHQ ","title":"Operation Anarchist"},{"id":"49276918","text":"Kemangkon is a district within the Purbalingga Regency of Central Java.

The annual celebration is held between 1 and 11 February. Its beginning coincides with the date of Khomeini's arrival and its ending with the Iranian Revolution; a day called Islamic Revolution's Victory Day or 22 of Bahman. The ten days Ettela'at Newspaper titling Tomorrow Morning at 9 Meeting Imam (Khomeni) in Tehran. Arrival of Ayatollah Khomeini on 1 February 1979 Dahe-ye Fajr marks the anniversary of the ten-day period between Khomeini's return to Iran (1 February) until the Iranian Revolution (22 Bahman; 11 February) in 1979. 1 February (12 Bahman 1357) On 1 February 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran after a period of exile in France imposed by the Shah of Iran, Muhammad Reza Pahlavi. Several million people went to Mehrabad International Airport to welcome Khomeini. Khomeini then went to Behesht-e Zahra cemetery, where he gave a lecture. Khomeini said Shapour Bakhtiar's cabinet was illegal, and that he would crash in the mouth of Bakhtiar's government. 2 February (13 Bahman 1357) Khomeini spoke to a crowd of clerics. He said; \\"From the beginning, the royal regime was against reason ... each nation must determine their own destiny\\". Radio Moscow reported that Iranian students living in America were opposed to American interference in Iran's internal affairs, and mounted demonstrations against the White House. 3 February (14 Bahman 1357) A press conference attended by nearly 300 Iranian and foreign correspondents was held at 9:00 a.m. on Saturday 14 Bahman, at Allawi School No. 2. At the beginning, a summary of Khomeini's views was read, then the journalists' questions began. Khomeini's response was as follows: The first book on the Iranian crisis, written by Ahmad Naruqi and published in Paris, was called Iran Against the Shah. Israel's Minister of Justice announced \\"We have lost our most important provider of oil\\". 4 February (15 Bahman 1357) British foreign secretary David Owen discussed the situation in Iran with his American counterpart during a visit to the US. Baghdad sent a delegation to Saudi Arabia to review the situation in Iran and the region. In a council on the Islamic Revolution, Mehdi Bazargan was suggested as the Prime Minister of Iran's interim Government. A number of senior Air Force officers involved with the government were imprisoned. Because the Iranian monarchy was in danger, the American government opposed their own interests to sell weapons, including several AWACS aircraft. General Heiser then decided to cancel the contract so America's interests would not be jeopardized. Airmen held a rally in Behbahan to support Khomeini. Bakhtiar's government limited the people's access to their bank deposits. Javid Shari'atian was banned from Iran by Bakhtiar's administration. Several resigned members of Majlis visited Khomeini. Khosro Qashqaie, a leader of Qashqaees, returned to Iran after 25-years of exile in the US. Stansfield Turner, the director of the CIA said \\"We did not understand who Khomeini was and the support his movement had\\". Ayatollah Taleqani requested a general explanation from the government for the disappearance of a number of air force students. 5 February (16 Bahman 1357) Khomeini chose Mehdi Bazargan as prime minister of his interim government. Iran now has two governments. Henry Kissinger condemned recent events in Iran following the human rights law of the US. General Robert Huyser, US special envoy to Iran, left Tehran after a month. A number of military personnel supported Khomeini. 6 February (17 Bahman 1357) The Shah's Army fires at Bazargan's supporters in Zahedan. The staff of the prime minister's office announced their support for Bazargan with demonstrations. The revolutionaries announced Iran will leave the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Most members of Iran's parliament struck to topple Bakhtiar's government. Hojatoleslam Fallahi delivered a speech in the presence of Khomeini and his followers after an eight-year ban on lectures. The parliament ratified the dissolution of SAVAK, Iran's secret police service, and the trial of its former commanders. 7 February (18 Bahman 1357) On 7 February 1979, Khomeini spoke with the Kurdish community about the necessity of unity between Shia and Sunni sects of Islam. At a gathering of lawyers of the High Court, Khomeini expressed that colonialism's plot in create differences between people and clergy. The US Secretary of State announced the United States recognition of the Bakhtiar administration and said Bakhtiar must act in the will of the people. Khomeini's movement and the Army began to negotiate. Opposition groups including academics announced their support for the Bazargan government. People and clerics of Zanjan held a 50,000-strong rally to express their overwhelming support for Khomeini and his government. Hojatoleslam Aboulfazl Shakouri, on behalf of the people and the clergy, recited a 30-article resolution on the dissolution of the monarchy, the parliament and government of Bakhtiar and the legitimacy of Bazargan government. The army, which was fired because of its opposition to the Shah, declared support for Khomeini. Due to the people's disregard for the government-imposed curfew, its length was reduced. An American striker, who injured a driver in Isfahan, was condemned by a Sharia court and was released on payment of atonement. Iranian courts were not eligible to try American nationals. The creation of this court refers to the empowerment of Muslim people. The United Nations expressed its concern about the situation in Iran. 8 February (19 Bahman 1357) Iranian air force officers went to Khomeini's home and promised their loyalty to the revolution. 9 February (20 Bahman 1357) Millions of Iranians came on to the streets to welcome the return of the religious leader Ruhollah Khomeini. The street fights between people and imperial guard intensified. 10 February (21 Bahman 1357) On 10 February 1979, civilians were armed by the revolutionary personnel of the air force. A curfew was announced by Bakhtiar's government but Khomeini disparaged it and said people had to break it. The revolutionaries subjugated police stations, prisons, and governmental centers. 11 February (22 Bahman 1357) Senior military commanders announced that they were neutral in conflict between Bakhtiar's government and revolutionaries. Thus they withdrew from the streets. Bakhtiar resigned and went to Paris. Revolutionaries gained a victory in this day. Customs Dahe- ye Fajr is celebrated in various ways, including commemorations at Khomeini's mausoleum and rallies for the achievements of the revolution. The Fajr International Film Festival has been held every year since 1982 in Tehran during Dahe-ye Fajr. It is organised by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance, and is the largest public film, theater, and music festival in Iran.

It is part of Operational Command West and is based in Kolomyia. Formed in late 2015, the brigade fought in the War in Donbass between May and November 2016, defending positions around Marinka. It again deployed to the Donbass in September 2017, defending positions around Popasna.  History  The brigade was formed on 30 October 2015 in Koloymia, part of Operational Command West. It included the 24th Separate Assault Battalion, the former Aidar Battalion. The brigade's first commander was Colonel and Hero of Ukraine Vasyl Zubanych, a former battalion commander in the 128th Mechanized Brigade. In an interview at the time, Zubanych stated that the brigade would be deployed to the Donbass if necessary in a war with Russia. The main purpose of the brigade at the time was to protect Bukovina from Romanian territorial claims. The first group of recruits were 1,000 volunteers on a contract basis. There initially was a 25% pay increase offered to recruits, as recognition of their status as mountain troops. In January 2016, it was reported by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence that the brigade was ready to begin combat training. As of January 2016 the brigade was stationed at Bila Tserkva pending completion of new barracks in Kolomyia. In February 2016, it was decided by the Ukrainian Ground Forces to form a new Bukovina mountain battalion at Chernivtsi. The 8th Separate Motorized Infantry Battalion and the 46th Separate Special Purpose Battalion \\"Donbass-Ukraine\\" also became part of the brigade. The 8th Motorized Infantry, the 24th Assault, and the 46th Separate Special Purpose Battalion formed the entirety of the brigade, consisting of a few thousand men. The brigade fought in the War in Donbass from 25 May to November 2016. The brigade defended the area around Marinka, Krasnohorivka, Taramchuk, Stepne, and Solodke. Immediately after the brigade took over its sector, it was shelled by separatist and Russian artillery, mortars, and tanks, mainly at night. The brigade also defended against repeated assaults by Russian and separatist troops. On the Independence Day of Ukraine, 24 August 2016, President Petro Poroshenko presented the brigade its battle flag. Between September and October, four soldiers of the brigade were killed in action. After the end of its tour in the Donbass, the brigade returned to Kolomyia in November. It suffered a total of 22 soldiers killed in action during its combat tour. At this time the 24th Assault and 46th Separate Special Purpose Battalions were withdrawn from the brigade due to a desire to avoid stationing them far from their homes as 80% of their personnel were from eastern Ukraine. To replace the assault battalions, the 109th and 108th Separate Mountain Assault Battalions were formed on 5 and 11 December, respectively. They were initially understrength due to being drawn from cadres from the 53rd and 54th Mechanized Brigades. After its return to Kolomyia, the brigade began mountain training, which it had not had time to commence before being sent to the front. Its first mountain climb took place on 13 January 2017 on Veliky Verkh. In the second half of February, brigade personnel climbed Hoverla, the tallest peak in Ukraine, and planted a Ukrainian flag in honor of the Ukrainian dead at the Battle of Debaltseve on the mountain summit. In September it returned to the Donbass, defending positions around Popasna. A soldier from the brigade was killed in action on 23 September during fighting at Novooleksandrivka.  Current Structure  As of 2017 the brigade's structure is as follows: * 10th Mountain Assault Brigade, Kolomyia ** Headquarters & Headquarters Company ** 1st Mountain Assault Battalion ** 108th Mountain Assault Battalion ** 109th Mountain Assault Battalion ** Tank Battalion ** 8th Motorized Infantry Battalion ** Brigade Artillery Group *** Headquarters & Target Acquisition Battery *** Artillery Battalion (2A18 D-30) *** Self-propelled Artillery Battalion (2S1 Gvozdika) *** Rocket Artillery Battalion (BM-21 Grad) *** Anti-tank Artillery Battalion (MT-12 Rapira) ** Anti-Aircraft Missile Artillery Battalion ** Engineer Battalion ** Maintenance Battalion ** Logistic Battalion ** Reconnaissance Company ** Sniper Company ** Electronic Warfare Company ** Signal Company ** Radar Company ** CBRN-defense Company ** Medical Company  References   External links  * Brigade website Category:Brigades of the Ukrainian Ground Forces Category:Military units and formations established in 2015 Category:Mountain infantry brigades Category:Military units and formations of Ukraine in the War in Donbass ","title":"10th Mountain Assault Brigade (Ukraine)"},{"id":"49277094","text":"Asha Aravind is an Indian model and film actress active in the Malayalam film industry.

It has coarse, fibrous to flaky back on the trunk and larger branches, smooth grey to pinkish bark above. The adult leaves are linear to narrow lance-shaped, the flower buds are arranged in groups of seven, the flowers are white and the fruit is cylindrical or barrel- shaped.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus brevipes is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The bark on the trunk and larger branches is fibrous to flaky but smooth grey to pinkish on branches less than in diameter. The leaves on young plants and on coppice regrowth are linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide. The adult leaves are held erect, linear to narrow lance-shaped, long and wide with a fine, often hooked tip. The glossiness of the leaves increases as the plant matures. The flower buds are arranged in groups of seven in leaf axils on a peduncle long, the individual flowers on a pedicel long. The mature flower buds are oval to pear- shaped, long and wide with a conical or slightly beaked operculum long. Flowering occurs from July to September and the flowers are white or creamy white. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped to cup-shaped capsule long and wide on a pedicel long. Eucalyptus brevipes is similar to E. gracilis but can be distinguished by its erect leaves. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus brevipes was first formally described in 1986 by Ian Brooker and the description was published in the journal Nuytsia from a specimen he collected near Cunderin Hill, between Mukinbudin and Bonnie Rock. The specific epithet (brevipes) is from the Latin words brevis meaning ‚Äúshort‚Äù and pes meaning \\"foot\\", referring to the pedicels. Distribution and habitat Mukinbudin mallee is found among granite outcrops in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia between Mukinbudin and Nungarin where it grows on sandy-loamy soils. It is often found in open low scrub country along with Eucalyptus loxophleba, Eucalyptus kochii, and Acacia acuminata. There are 14 known populations of this species that are known ten of which occur on unallocated crown land. There is an estimated 320 mature plants in nine of the populations occurring over an area of . The main threats to the species are fire, road works, and firebreak maintenance. It is thought to be able to resprout from a lignotuber following a fire. Conservation Eucalyptus brevipes is classified as \\"endangered by the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia).

He currently serves as a Director and Delegate for the World Cube Association (WCA) and has been an organizer of every annual US Nationals Cubing Competition since 2010 (in addition to the World Cube Competition of 2015). Sheu previously served as the first Chair of the WCA‚Äôs Regulations Committee with Lucas Garron from 2012-2015, directing a complete redrafting of the official competition regulations and guidelines during his tenure. Recently, he has received media attention as the subject of several viral images and video clips at various college sporting events.  Speedcubing  Vincent Sheu has been an active speedcuber since 2006. He typically uses the CFOP method, a layer-by-layer system popularized by Jessica Fridrich in 1997. In 2011, Sheu tied the existing world record for a 2x2x2 single solve with a time of 0.96 seconds at the Berkeley Winter Cube Competition. During the 2014 US Nationals Competition, Sheu tied the existing world record for the Fewest Moves Competition (FMC), an event that requires participants to solve a 3x3x3 Rubik‚Äôs Cube in the fewest moves possible, with an average solve of 25 moves among three different solves. At the same competition, he also set the North American Record for a single solve in an FMC event with a solve of 22 moves. As a result, Sheu became the 2014 National Champion in the FMC category.  Media Appearances  In February 2014, Vincent Sheu was filmed at a Haas Pavilion men's college basketball game between rivals California Golden Bears and the Stanford Cardinal as he performed an impromptu Rubik's cube-solve behind sportscasters Bill Walton (color commentator) and Dave Pasch (play-by-play announcer), who were commentating at the game. Given his placement at the front of the California student section directly between and behind the announcers, Sheu's cube-solve was immediately visible to audiences watching the game on ESPN2. A film clip of the solve went viral as a YouTube video on the internet shortly thereafter. After the high popularity of his cube solve, Sheu was subsequently placed by ESPN2 producers to solve additional cubes and puzzles behind sportscasters during live broadcasts of California basketball games against the Utah Utes, Utah Valley Wolverines, and Arkansas Razorbacks. He was also featured by Bill Walton in a short ESPN2 segment about his participation at Rubik's Cube competitions and the Berkeley college experience during the California Golden Bears ‚Äì Arizona Wildcats game three weeks later. Following these events, Sheu was featured in a promotional video on student life by the University of California, Berkeley that aired on Pac-12 Networks. Vincent Sheu was one of several speedcubers to appear in \\"Will We Become God?,\\" Episode 8, Season 5 of Through the Wormhole, an American science documentary television series by actor Morgan Freeman. The episode aired on July 9, 2014. During a college basketball game between the Stanford Cardinal and University of California ‚Äì Los Angeles Bruins on February 5, 2014, Sheu was again the subject of internet and media attention. As Bill Walton commented the Pac-12 game on ESPN2, Sheu was filmed with a fellow student wearing \\"Stanford Law School\\" apparel and studying during the first half of the game as they sat in the student section with binders, textbooks, and casebooks. Although the film clip was later determined to have been spliced in shortly before the game actually began, the image proceeded to go viral and reached \\"meme\\" status on Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, and AboveTheLaw.com, prompting humorous discussion about the difficult academic workload of first year law students. Vincent Sheu was one of several speed cubers to make a cameo in Netflix's documentary, The Speed Cubers, which was released on Netflix on July 29, 2020.  Background  Vincent Sheu completed a joint degree at Stanford University. He received a J.D. from Stanford Law School and M.S. in Computer Science from the Stanford School of Engineering in June 2018. He previously graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a B.A. in Statistics and Molecular & Cell Biology (‚Äô12) and an M.Eng. in Bioengineering (‚Äô14). At Berkeley, he served as the President of the Berkeley Cube Club. As part of the University of California's Decal program, he taught the popular courses ‚ÄúLearn To Solve the Rubik‚Äôs Cube‚Äù (Math 98) and ‚ÄúSpeedsolving‚Äù (Math 198).

The Ipswich connection brought students to Magdalene, via Ipswich grammar school and John Dawes installed as master there with Kelke's help. They included Adam Winthrop, father of John Winthrop. Kelke continued to fill the office of master at Magdalene College until his death; during that time he was twice a candidate for the mastership of St John's College, in 1563 and again in 1569. On the former occasion he was actually elected, having been strongly recommended to William Cecil; but Cecil favoured another candidate, Richard Longworth. On 15 May 1563 he was collated to the archdeaconry of Stow, and in the following year he proceeded D.D. The opposition at Cambridge during the vestiarian controversy to Archbishop Matthew Parker's Advertisements included Kelke. With Whitgift and three others, he represented to Cecil that its requirements on clerical dress would be divisive. Kelke twice filled the university post of vice-chancellor; in 1567, for a few months only, on the death of Robert Beaumont, and again for the academic year 1571‚Äì2. On 8 August 1572 he was collated to the rectory of Teversham in Cambridgeshire. During all this time Kelke was living mostly in Ipswich,. During his second tenure of the vice-chancellorship the common council of Ipswich on 6 December 1571 had a preacher named Keyes to fill his place. Subsequently he accepted a salary from the corporation, on condition that he became resident, and preached every Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday, and also visited the sick and afflicted. He continued there until late in life. In 1564, on the occasion of a royal visit to Cambridge, Kelke obtained from the Duke of Norfolk a contribution towards the completion of the buildings of Magdalene College. His time in Ipswich, depressed the repution and credit of the college. Death and aftermath Kelke died on 6 January 1576, and was buried in the chancel of Great St Mary's Church, Cambridge. His epitaph mentioned his preaching and religious convictions. On 13 December 1574 a grant in perpetuity was made by the college to the crown, at a fixed rent, of an estate in London with which the society had been endowed by its founder Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden. The act was unlawful. Kelke, on his own account, induced the Fellows to agree to the transaction, which also stipulated that the transfer should be void unless, by a given day, the queen regranted it to Benedict Spinola, a Genoese merchant, and his heirs. Family Kelke's will, dated 12 December 1575, mentions his wife Rose, his daughter Abigail, his brother Francis, and his nephew Christopher, the son of Francis. Abigail married Nicholas Farrer of Pinner, or Nicholas Faunt.

It is an ancient practice in the Indian state of Odisha. Stone carving is practiced by artisans mainly in Puri, Bhubaneswar and Lalitgiri in the Cuttack district, though some carvings can be found in Khiching in the Mayurbhanj District. Stone carving is one of the major handcrafts of Odisha. The art form primarily consists of custom carved works, with the Sun Temple of Konark and its intricate sculpture and delicate carvings on the red vivid sandstone exemplifying the practice. Other noteworthy monuments include the Stupas of Udayagiri and Ratnagiri and the temples at Jagannath, Lingaraj, Mukteshwar and as well as other temples in the region. Stones Sandstone, soapstone, Serpentinite, Makrana marble, and granite were used in Konark stone carving. Skillful artists may use the soft, white soapstone, Khadipathara, or the slightly harder greenish chlorite or Kochilapathara. Rocks such as the pinkish Khandolite, Sahanapathara or Baulapathara and the hardest of all, black granite and Muguni Pathara are commonly used. Procedure An outline of sorts is first drawn on the cut-to- size stone. Once the outline is engraved, the final figure is brought out by removing the unwanted portions. For the harder stones, this is done by chiseling out the extra material. With softer stones, it is done by scraping out the extra material with a sharp flat-edged iron tool. Hammers and chisels of various sizes are used (e.g. the muna, patili, martual, thuk-thuki and nitana). Products Subjects are often traditional images, including mythological figures. Utilitarian items like candle stands, pen stands, paperweights, bookends, lamp bases and stoneware utensils are also created. Turning and polishing with a wooden lathe called Kunda, the craftsmen produce beautiful polished plates (Thali), containers (gina, pathuri), cups and glasses. These are used for Pujas, ritual worships and for daily eating. Stoneware containers are particularly good for storing curd as they do not react to acid. They are also filled with water and used for holding the legs of wooden almirahs to keep out the ants.

It was written and storyboarded by Lamar Abrams and Katie Mitroff. The episode was viewed by 1.384 million viewers. In this episode, Garnet tells Steven the story of how Ruby and Sapphire met each other, fused to create Garnet, began their romantic relationship, and eventually joined the Crystal Gems. The episode received a nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation and was adapted as a best-selling children's book. Plot Garnet (Estelle) awakens Steven (Zach Callison) at midnight on his birthday to tell him the tale of how Ruby (Charlyne Yi) and Sapphire (Erica Luttrell) first met and fused to become Garnet. 5,750 years in the past, the Gem Homeworld is in the process of colonizing Earth, but a group of rebels is halting progress. A team of diplomats is sent to Earth to investigate, among them being Sapphire and three Ruby bodyguards. Sapphire reports her vision of the future to Blue Diamond, the leader of the mission: in the upcoming battle, the rebels will defeat seven Gems, including Sapphire herself and two Rubies, but will be captured, ending the rebellion. The rebels‚ÄîRose Quartz (Susan Egan) and Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall)‚Äîattack the Sky Arena. The battle proceeds as Sapphire had foreseen, and once two of the Rubies have been defeated, Sapphire thanks the remaining Ruby for her efforts and prepares for the inevitable. Ruby refuses to accept this outcome and leaps towards Sapphire, saving her but unintentionally fusing with her and forming Garnet for the first time. The crowd of diplomats stares in surprise and disgust at the confused Garnet, and Rose and Pearl flee during the distraction. Garnet immediately unfuses, and Ruby takes the blame for the failure of Sapphire's prediction and the illicit fusion. Blue Diamond sentences Ruby to be shattered, but Sapphire grabs her and escapes, jumping down to Earth's surface. On the ground, Ruby and Sapphire find shelter and discuss their feelings about the unexpected fusion. Over a montage of the two of them exploring Earth and getting to know each other better, they sing the song \\"Something Entirely New\\", trying to understand what it means to have become Garnet. They end with a fusion dance, fusing into Garnet once more. Having difficulty getting used to her body, Garnet tumbles down a hill into Pearl and Rose. Rose welcomes Garnet and encourages her to talk about how she feels. Garnet peppers Rose with questions about Ruby, Sapphire, and their fusion, but Rose tells Garnet that she already is \\"the answer\\" she seeks to all her questions. In the present, as Garnet finishes her story, Steven asks her what the answer was. She tells him: \\"love\\". Production Episodes of Steven Universe are written and storyboarded by a single team. \\"The Answer\\" was written by Lamar Abrams and Katie Mitroff, and directed by supervising director Joe Johnston, while Byung Ki Lee provided animation direction, and Jasmin Lai served as art director. The episode's art was inspired by Lotte Reiniger, an animator most well known for directing The Adventures of Prince Achmed, the oldest surviving animated feature film. Rebecca Sugar liked her for doing something new in an era where there wasn't much precedence for animation. Sugar herself has been compared to Reiniger for her milestone of being the first woman to independently create a series for Cartoon Network. Storyboarder Katie Mitroff called this her favorite episode. Music The episode features the song \\"Something Entirely New\\". The song was arranged by Aivi & Surasshu, the music team for the series, and written by series creator Rebecca Sugar. It features vocals by Charlyne Yi (as Ruby) and Erica Luttrell (as Sapphire). Jeff Ball plays violin for the song. The episode also features several instrumental songs by Aivi & Surasshu: \\"Happy Birthday, Steven/5,750 Years Ago\\", \\"Blue Diamond\\", \\"The Rebels/Garnet's First Fusion\\", \\"Escaping the Colony/Feelings of Love\\" and \\"The Answer\\". Broadcast and reception \\"The Answer\\" premiered on Cartoon Network on January 4, 2016. Its initial American broadcast was viewed by approximately 1.384 million viewers. It received a Nielsen household rating of 0.30, meaning that it was seen by 0.3% of all households. The episode was the first in a \\"StevenBomb\\", a programming schedule in which one new episode of Steven Universe airs daily during the regular work week. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, with particular praise going to the song \\"Something Entirely New\\" and the voice acting by Estelle. Several critics favorably compared the episode to a fairy tale. Lyn Muldrow of Autostraddle said that Steven Universe had \\"out- gayed\\" itself with this episode. Eric Thurm of The A.V. Club was somewhat critical of the episode, giving it a B+, and stating that it \\"doesn‚Äôt really tell us anything we couldn‚Äôt have guessed, or anything that we really needed to know\\". He also felt that Ruby and Sapphire were still one-note characters, not complex enough to compare to the other characters of the show. Sarra Sedghi of Paste listed \\"Something Entirely New\\" as the fifth best song of the show's first two seasons. Book adaptation A children's book adaptation of the episode was released on September 6, 2016. It was published by Cartoon Network Books and written by Rebecca Sugar, with art by Elle Michalka and Tiffany Ford. The book reached no. 7 of the New York Times Best Seller List for Children's Middle Grade Hardcover books on October 2, 2016.

In 1915 the French Ministry of Culture listed it as a monument of historical value. History Construction of the church began in 1235. Since then, the building has undergone several major renovations and modifications, notably in 1320, 1611, 1727, and 1780, when an underground chapel was added.Jean-Pierre de Gennes, Les chevaliers du Saint-S√©pulcre de J√©rusalem, M√©moire & documents, 2004, p. 326 In 1819 the relics of Saint Helena were transferred to the church from the Abbaye Saint-Pierre d‚ÄôHautvillers by the knights of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. When Boulevard de S√©bastopol was cleared in 1857, the church‚Äôs three chapels and apse were destroyed. A renovation project was undertaken by architects √âtienne-Hippolyte Godde and Victor Baltard. In 1875, after the Paris Commune, the reliquary of Saint Lupus of Sens was opened in order to carry out an anatomical analysis of the remains of Saint Helena. Based on the medical findings, Monsignor Richard, Archbishop of Paris, announced that the ‚Äúreliquary contained the almost-complete torso of Saint Helena‚Äù, that ‚Äúthe head was missing and the limbs compressed‚Äù, and that ‚Äúthe state of the body conserved in the reliquary of the √âglise Saint-Leu-Saint-Gilles corresponded to the descriptions known to the Bollandistes in the 18th century‚Äù.

Makrana marble is a type of white marble, popular for use in sculpture and building decor. It is mined in the town of Makrana in Rajasthan, India, and was used in the construction of several iconic monuments such as the Taj Mahal in Agra and the Victoria Memorial in Kolkata. The Makrana Marble is listed as a Global Heritage Stone Resource by International Union of Geological Sciences Geology In the Makrana area, marble is found as five steeply-dipping bands. They form part of the Ajmer Formation of the Delhi Supergroup, which is a sequence of sedimentary rocks that was deposited in the Delhi Basin during the Proterozoic. About 1450 Ma (million years ago) these rocks were affected by the Delhi Orogeny, causing the metamorphism that transformed the original limestones to marble and the folding that caused the steep dip and the current outcrop pattern. Properties Makrana is regarded as the oldest place in India with a marble quarry. Upon mining, Makrana marble is not subjected to any form of treatment, but used in cutting and chiseling straight away. Makrana marble is one of the two calcitic marble varieties in India, with all others being dolomitic. It has two varieties: white and albeta. The quantity of marble reserves in the region is estimated to be 55 million tonnes by the state government. About 120 thousand tonnes of the marble are produced annually from over 400 mines in the region. Makrana marble has a high percentage of calcium and is therefore resistant to water seepage. The water absorption of Makrana marble is said to be the lowest among all types in India, and the marble is claimed to contain 98 percent of calcium carbonate and only two percent of impurities, this property of Makrana marble helps it to stay the same proportion of white for a long period of time and because it contains 98 percent of calcium the polish of this marble is considered in the best. The different shades of Makrana marble are pure white, white with grey shades and white with pink shades, depending on the level of impurities. The close interlocking property of the marble makes it strong, hard and translucent. It is said to retain its shine and white color for a long period of time. Types of Makrana Marble Makrana Marbles splits into various categories according to its design and pattern. The following are the exclusive marbles that are mined and manufactured at Makrana. Makrana White Marble- Makrana marble is highly used in residential & commercial buildings and numerous temples, mosques, churches, and monuments, it can be used for decorative purpose in houses, hotels, corporate offices and Restaurants, western and Indian sculptures, handicrafts.

The stone is available in various forms such as natural blocks, large & small slabs, regular tiles. Dungri Marble- Dungri Marble is one of the oldest and finest quality marble of makrana based mines. This stone is widely used in flooring, and wall cladding due to its special qualities like no chemical reinforcement, no color changes, and no pin holes. Albeta Marble- Albeta Marble is one of the best as well as highly recommended stone for floor designs which gives luxury look to the home. The color of albeta makrana marble is milky white with a brown texture.Mahaveer Marble Pvt Ltd Types of Makrana Marble Notable monuments and buildings Victoria Memorial in Kolkata Prominent buildings/monuments that used Makrana marble in their construction are: * Taj Mahal, Agra, India * Victoria Memorial, Kolkata, India ‚Äì Makrana marble was chosen over various other European types in the construction of the Victoria Memorial, after several tests concluded Makrana marble to be superior. Sir Thomas Henry Holland, a British geologist, was given credit for recommending the use of Makrana marble in the construction of Victoria Memorial. * Sheikh Zayed Mosque, Abu Dhabi, UAE * Moti Masjid, Lahore, Pakistan * Dukhnivaran Sahib Gurdwara, Ludhiana, India Use and export Marble from Makrana is exported overseas mainly to the Persian Gulf countries, the European Union, Southeast Asia, Canada, Pakistan and Russia.

As a civic foundation, ALPF aims to provide information and research to the general public and decision makers on issues relating to policy, as well as provides a training outlet for future leaders. ALPF has approximately 100 combined fellows and staff members. The foundation refers to its members as ‚Äúfellows‚Äù, of which there are three levels: (1) Senior Fellows, (2) Full Fellows, and (3) Visiting Fellows. ALPF's logo represents the Tree of Liberty. The Foundation claims that the tree must be watered to maintain liberty or it will wither away. The group aims to provides evidence-based research on many topics, including potential threats that EMP may pose to the United States. In June 2015, ALPF published a report on Electromagnetic Pulse and Space Weather and the Strategic Threat to America's Nuclear Power Stations. The group's EMP research appears to have the support of Scott McBride, Idaho National Laboratory, Infrastructure Security, who stated, ‚ÄúI have reviewed the EMP & Space Weather and the Strategic Threat to America‚Äôs Nuclear Power Stations and found it to be an excellent presentation of what we know and what we don‚Äôt know about this very complex threat to all of our critical infrastructures, not just our nuclear stations.‚Äù The group claims their EMP research illustrates that the United States is not currently prepared for an EMP attack that could affect the U.S. nuclear grid. John Ostrich, U.S. Department of Energy, described the group's research by stating, \\"Overall you have provided an interesting and detailed case for a problem (threats to nuclear power plants from GMD and EMP) that few have examined.\\" Dave Lochbaum, Union of Concern Scientists, claimed that the group's EMP paper \\"...is a well- researched and solid analysis of black swan events that could result in the next Fukushima disaster unless the hazards are sincerely considered and steps undertaken to responsibly manage the risks.‚Äù In April 2016, ALPF co-hosted the first ever Texas Grid Security Summit with Texas State Senator Bob Hall. The summit was aimed at addressing \\"...the critical importance of protecting Texas from the threat of an EMP\\". In October 2017, ALPF had its EMP research cited in a congressional report entitled \\"North Korea Nuclear EMP Attack: An Existential Threat\\" submitted by the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack to the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security--Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency, urging Congress to take the threats posed to U.S. national security by a potential EMP strike seriously. According to Dr. Peter Pry, Chief of Staff, Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack, ‚ÄúThe independent study by ALPF supports the conclusions of the Congressional EMP Commission that nuclear reactors should receive high priority for EMP protection.‚Äù ALPF was the first organization to publicly address the safety and security risks posed by drones. As a result, the FAA later adopted recommendations requiring registration of drones. A safety and security assessment on drones in the U.S. airspace developed by ALPF was reported on by the Harvard Law School National Security Journal. The group also aims to counteract violent extremism by conducting educational town halls across the country, holding educational workshops, and disseminating educational materials and program flyers as a part of an information campaign the group calls Children Protected from Radicalization (CPR). ALPF is led by Founder and Chairman David Stuckenberg, Vice Chairman Stephen Dupuis, Board Member and Executive Secretary Dylan R. Bryant, and President of the Board David Liapis. Assisting in leadership are additional members of the Board of Directors consisting of Win Johnson, General Kenneth Chrosniak, and Dean A. Dohrman, Ph.D.; the Foundation also has a team of executive board members, organizational directors, and fellows.

Mehta, an Indian ophthalmologist, medical researcher and writer, is considered by many as the father of Phacoemulsification in India. He is the Chief Surgical and Medical Director at Mehta International Eye Institute, a Mumbai-based specialty eye hospital founded by him. He is known to be the first surgeon to perform a Radial keratotomy in India and is credited with the development of the first soft eye implant in the world, and the Keiki Mehta BP Valve Glaucoma Shunt, a medical implant used in the treatment of neovascular‚Äö congenital and uveitic glaucoma. He is a recipient of several honours including the Grand Honors Award of the National Eye Research Foundation, Chicago and the Triple Ribbon Award of the American Society for Cataract and Refractive Surgery. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 2008, for his contributions to Medicine.  Biography  Born in a Parsi family in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, Mehta graduated in medicine (MBBS) from the Christian Medical College and secured his post graduate degree (MS) from the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh. Moving to UK, he obtained a Diploma in Ophthalmology (DO) from the Moorefield's Eye Hospitals and Institute of Ophthalmology, London where he had the opportunity to train under renowned ophthalmologist, Harold Ridley, and secured another Diploma from Dublin, before going to US for advanced training. He returned to India in 1971 and started working on intraocular lenses (IOL) which was not available in India at that time. He founded Colaba Eye Hospital where he introduced the posterior chamber implant and started working on the development of a soft implant in 1976. The efforts resulted in the presentation of a paper at the All India Ophthalmological Society in 1977 and subsequently at the American Intra-ocular Implant Society, San Francisco in 1978. He also developed a round intraocular lens, a first time in India, which was surgically implanted in 1983. Keiki Mehta BP Valve Glaucoma Shunt is another of his inventions, which is a valved implant used in the treatment of glaucoma. Later, Mehta's focus shifted to Refractive surgery and did pioneering work on Radial Keratotomy and Excimer surgery. He wrote a book, Radial Keratotomy Principle & Practice, in 1990 which is a reference text on the subject. When Optikon, an Italian manufacturer of ophthalmological equipment, toured India with a Phacoemulsification machine for promotional purposes, Mehta bought the equipment from them and visited USA to receive training on phacoemulsification under William F. Maloney in 1988. His researches with the equipment resulted in the development of new techniques including vertical lens rotation, a tangential chop technique, and lens coring. In 2000, he founded Mehta International Eye Institute, attached to the Colaba Eye Hospital, for advanced research on ophthalmology, which has since been awarded the Big Brand Research Service Excellence Award for the Best Eye Hospital in Mumbai in 2011. He also established Netra Rukshak Rural Eye Hospital, a charity hospital in Karjat, a small village with tribal people as majority population.

He has made important contributions in the system of education of Moldova and in training of Moldovan mathematicians. As a member of the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences (Mathematics section), he spent a great scientific and organizational work in the field of mathematics education. About 30 of his students defended their theses and work in many countries. Valentin Belousov and Y.I.Neagu wrote Moldovan-Russian Dictionary of Mathematics, which has long been used by mathematicians Moldova. Together with I.I.Lupu and Y.I.Neagu V.D.Belousov published a book of mathematics in schools of Moldova (1812‚Äì1972). For many years, V.D.Belousov was the chairman of the jury of school mathematical Olympiads of Moldova.  Trainees and graduates  Under the direction of Valentin Danilovich 22 mathematics from different republics of the former Soviet Union and from abroad defended their theses, four of them also defended their doctoral dissertations.  Social work  In parallel with the scientific and pedagogical activity Valentin Danilovich spent big public work as a deputy Balti City Council (1960‚Äì1962), member of the District Committee of the CPM (1967‚Äì1973), member of the Supreme Council of Moldova (1975‚Äì1980), member of the Presidium of the Society \\"Knowledge\\", a member of editorial boards of various domestic and foreign publications, organizing committee member of many international conferences.  Family  Father Daniel Afinogenovich Belousov (1897‚Äì1956), was an officer in the army of Tsarist Russia (graduated from military school in Tbilisi). He took part in First World War. In Moldova, he worked at the post office in the city of Balti. Mother of Valentin Danilovich, Elena K. Belousov (Garbu) (1897‚Äì1982), also worked at the post office. Wife ‚Äì Belousov (Bondareva) Elizabeth Feodorovna (5 May 1925 ‚Äì 26 November 1991). Philologist, she taught at the State University of Moldova. Children: Alexander Valentinovich (03.10.1948 ‚Äì 3 September 1998), PhD in physics, senior research fellow of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova; Tatiana Valentinovna Kravchenko (born 16 February 1952), a doctor neurologist.

School of Belousov  The lifework of Belousov Valentin Danilovich is continued his numerous disciples and followers in various countries, whose number is constantly increasing. In 1994 at the initiative of the students of V.D.Belousov at the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science of the ASM was established scientific journal \\"Quasigroups and Related Systems(http://www.quasigroups.eu/)'\\", now known all over the world. For twenty years this magazine published many articles both Moldovan and foreign specialists in the theory of quasi-groups and regions close to it. Since 1995, the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science of the ASM annual birthday Valentin Danilovich (20 February) is carried out advanced algebraic seminar in memory of Valentin Danilovich Belousov. In this workshop, his disciples and followers from Moldova and other countries take stock of the past year, and report on new results in the theory of quasi- groups and related areas. Thanks to the productive scientific and pedagogical activity of V.D.Belousov in Republic of Moldova was founded on the theory of quasigroups school (Belousov's School on Theory of Quasigroups), consisting of his 22 disciples (http://belousov.scerb.com/) and more than 40 followers continue his work in Moldova and abroad.

Sampson, et al. \\"EnerJ: Approximate data types for safe and general low-power computation\\", In ACM SIGPLAN Notices, vol. 46, no. 6, 2011. One example of such situation is for a search engine where no exact answer may exist for a certain search query and hence, many answers may be acceptable. Similarly, occasional dropping of some frames in a video application can go undetected due to perceptual limitations of humans. Approximate computing is based on the observation that in many scenarios, although performing exact computation requires large amount of resources, allowing bounded approximation can provide disproportionate gains in performance and energy, while still achieving acceptable result accuracy. For example, in k-means clustering algorithm, allowing only 5% loss in classification accuracy can provide 50 times energy saving compared to the fully accurate classification. The key requirement in approximate computing is that approximation can be introduced only in non- critical data, since approximating critical data (e.g., control operations) can lead to disastrous consequences, such as program crash or erroneous output. Strategies Several strategies can be used for performing approximate computing. ; Approximate circuits : Approximate adders,J. Echavarria, et al. \\"FAU: Fast and Error-Optimized Approximate Adder Units on LUT-Based FPGAs\\", FPT, 2016.J. Miao, et al. \\"Modeling and synthesis of quality-energy optimal approximate adders\\", ICCAD, 2012 multipliers and other logical circuits can reduce hardware overhead.S. Venkataramani, et al. \\"SALSA: systematic logic synthesis of approximate circuits\\", DAC, 2012.J. Miao, et al. \\"Approximate logic synthesis under general error magnitude and frequency constraints\\", ICCAD, 2013R. Hegde et al. \\"Energy-efficient signal processing via algorithmic noise-tolerance\\", ISLPED, 1999. For example, an approximate multi-bit adder can ignore the carry chain and thus, allow all its sub-adders to perform addition operation in parallel. ; Approximate storage : Instead of storing data values exactly, they can be stored approximately, e.g., by truncating the lower-bits in floating point data. Another method is accept less reliable memory. For this, in DRAM and eDRAM, refresh rate can be lowered or controlled. In SRAM, supply voltage can be lowered or controlled. Approximate storage can be applied to reduce MRAM's high write energy consumption. In general, any error detection and correction mechanisms should be disabled. ; Software-level approximation : There are several ways to approximate at software level. Memoization can be applied. Some iterations of loops can be skipped (termed as loop perforation) to achieve a result faster. Some tasks can also be skipped, for example when a run-time condition suggests that those tasks are not going to be useful (task skipping). Monte Carlo algorithms and Randomized algorithms trade correctness for execution time guarantees.C.Alippi, Intelligence for Embedded Systems: a Methodological approach, Springer, 2014, pp. 283 The computation can be reformulated according to paradigms that allow easily the acceleration on specialized hardware, e.g. a neural processing unit.H. Esmaeilzadeh, et al. \\"Neural acceleration for general-purpose approximate programs\\", MICRO, 2012 ; Approximate system : In an approximate system, different subsystems of the system such as the processor, memory, sensor, and communication modules are synergistically approximated to obtain a much better system-level Q-E trade- off curve compared to individual approximations to each of the subsystems. Application areas Approximate computing has been used in a variety of domains where the applications are error-tolerant, such as multimedia processing, machine learning, signal processing, scientific computing, etc. Google is using this approach in their Tensor processing units (TPU, a custom ASIC). Derived paradigms The main issue in approximate computing is the identification of the section of the application that can be approximated. In the case of large scale applications, it is very common to find people holding the expertise on approximate computing techniques not having enough expertise on the application domain (and vice versa). In order to solve this problem, programming paradigms have been proposed. They all have in common the clear role separation between application programmer and application domain expert. These approaches allow the spread of the most common optimizations and approximate computing techniques.

Moshe Attias attended an Ottoman state school in Sarajevo ‚Äì open to all confessions but mainly attended by Bosnian Muslims ‚Äì and studied according to an Islamic curriculum. He then moved to Istanbul to perfect his studies on Islamic religion and culture. There he became a scholar of the 13th century Persian poet and mystic Muslih-uddin Sa'di, the author of \\"Gulistan\\". Attias may have even become a Jewish sufi. Attias got the title of effendi, a scholar of Islam, which is visible from the Latin inscription on his grave. He was known in his last years as \\"Zeki Effendi\\". He then returned to Sarajevo, where he joined the Ottoman civil service, working for the tax authorities. He remained in town as a financial advisor after the Austro-Hungarian takeover of the capital in 1878. He was the treasurer of the Sarajevo Jewish society La Benevolencija, for which he kept a correspondence with Angel Pulido in Madrid.Sefardiweb Zeki Effendi used to write in standard Castilian Spanish language, rather than in the Judeo-Spanish (Ladino) usually used by Sarajevo Jews, but still using the Hebrew alphabet. The poet Abraham Aaron Cap√≥n commissioned him to write an authoritative history of the Bosnian Jews. Zeki Effendi published it in the short-lived Sarajevo Ladino periodical, La Alborada, under the pen name '‚Äòel Amante de la Luz‚Äô (\\"the light-lover\\") ‚Äì a reference to his illuministic approach to historiography.Julia Phillips Cohen, Sarah Abrevaya Stein, Sephardic Scholarly Worlds: Toward a Novel Geography of Modern Jewish History, Jewish Quarterly Review, Volume 100, Number 3, Summer 2010, pp. 349‚Äì384 (Article) He published in 1901 \\"La historia de los judi√≥s de Bosna\\" (History of the Bosnian Jews), or \\"Konsezos de nuestros viezos\\".Sefardiweb His most well-known historiographic piece concerns Rabbi Moshe Danon, \\"the rabbi of Stolac.\\"Centre for Islamic Pluralism, Gedenken an Muhamed Neziroviƒã In 1908 his voice was recorded by Julius Subak on his trip to Sarajevo with Abraham A.

In 1911 Zeki Effendi made a tour of the Balkans together with the renowned Spanish scholar of Sephardic balladry, Don Manuel Manrique de Lara, recording oral texts from the Sefardi culture of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo. Zeki Effendi is buried in the Old Jewish Cemetery in Sarajevo. His gravestone contains inscriptions in three scripts: Latin, Hebrew, and Arabic.

One estimate is that perhaps more than 100 militants were involved in the attack. The attack lasted for about four hours, and the militants allegedly burnt children alive. The Nigerian Army was unable to fight the militants until reinforcements arrived, causing Boko Haram to retreat. Fleeing villagers were hunted down by the insurgents, and three female suicide bombers blew themselves up among people who had escaped to the neighbouring village of Gamori. The exact death toll is not known, but at least 86 people are confirmed to have been killed. 62 others were treated for burns at the State Specialist Hospital in Maiduguri. Large parts of Dalori village were completely destroyed in the attack. Questions have been raised over how the militants were able to attack a settlement so close to army headquarters in Maiduguri, how they were able to have likely driven past roads patrolled by soldiers and vigilantes unhindered and how they were able to attack the village for several hours before the army intervened and drove them out.

In later life, she became a philanthropist who controlled the Constance Travis Charitable Trust, one of the leading family grant-making trusts in Britain. Early life Constance Travis was born Constance Mary Edwards in Stockport in 1911. Her parents were shopkeepers who moved to Sussex for the sake of her father's health when she was 12. They ran a grocery shop in Shoreham-by-Sea. At the age of 15 she underwent a full- immersion baptism which she said put her off both the church and swimming.Constance Travis. The Times, 29 January 2016. Retrieved 31 January 2016. Widow of late Northampton timber merchant dies aged 104. Northampton Chronicle & Echo, 12 January 2016. Retrieved 31 January 2016. Career Edwards decided from an early age that she wanted to be an actress. She appeared in a summer review at the Palace Theatre on Brighton Pier and then in Topsy and Eva at the Gaiety Theatre in London's West End, aged just 17. The show was based on Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet Beecher Stowe. She had a leading role in The Dubarry (1932) and a long run as Milady de Winter in The Three Musketeers at the Theatre Royal. She had small screen parts in Nine Till Six (1932), the first film made at Ealing Studios after it converted to sound, and in Yes, Mr Brown with Jack Buchanan (1933). Family In 1936, Edwards married Ray Travis, son of Ernest Travis, co-founder of Travis Arnold that eventually became the Travis Perkins timber and building materials chain. Constance and Ray met in 1933 on the stairwell of a Bloomsbury building where they were both taking singing lessons. On the first morning of their honeymoon, Constance received a shock when the maid at their hotel brought the morning tea in with the words \\"He's gone, ma'am\\". It transpired that she was referring to the abdication of King Edward VIII rather than the desertion of Ray. Constance and Ray lived in Kingsthorpe and then Dallington, Northamptonshire. They moved to Quinton in 1964. They had children Tony and Hilary. Ray died in 1988. Later life At age 78, Travis suffered a stroke which meant that she was confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life. She found solace in distributing the funds of her charitable trust, the Constance Travis Charitable Trust, which she founded in the early 1980s and has become one of the leading family grant-making trusts in Britain. Its assets include ¬£27 million of Travis Perkins shares. On her 100th birthday Travis ensured that ¬£100,000 was given to each of her favourite charities.

According to a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between the Kerala State and the Ministry of Railways on 27 January 2016, commercially viable railway projects will be identified and handed over to the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) to be fast-tracked on a 51:49 per cent equity basis. SPV has discussed about the extension to . The currently proposed Sabarimala railway is under PMO - Pro active governs and timely implementation (Pragati); will be monitored by the Prime Minister's Office. The proposed railway line will be a great relief to the transportation problems faced by Idukki, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts.  Background  Periyar river Kerala's government started the land acquisition for the construction of this Sabarimala railway project and established special Thahasildhar offices at Perumbavoor and Palai in 2006 and at Muvattupuzha in 2010 for the land acquisition of Sabarimala railway. Railway and revenue department has conducted joint survey for the land acquisition of this railway line, laid boundary stone for the acquired land and notification for land acquisition up to proposed Ramapuram railway station in Kottayam district. 90% of railway line construction up to Kaladi railway station was completed by 2010. The revenue department of the Government of Kerala completed all formalities of land acquisition in Chelamattom village, Perumbavoor village, Koovapady village, Vengoor West village, Rayamangalam village, Asmannor village (on 19 August 2008) and Muvattupuzha village (on 28 October 2011) and declared the land value of acquired land for this railway line. But land price distribution to the land owners of these villages has not happened due to the lack of funding from the Railway Ministry of the Government of India. Although the Railway board has approved the revised estimate of Angamali- Perumbavoor reach of this railway line , has not given any fund for the completion of revised estimate approved reach. The Railway board has written to the Kerala government that without 50% of cost sharing by the state government, they could not allocate any further funding to Sabarimala railway project. The Railways have started the pre-non interlocking works in the Angamali Railway station on 3 August 2017 which aims at connecting the Sabarimala railway to the main line of Ernakulam-Shoranur. They also have decided to open the railway offices at Perumbavoor and Muvattupuzha for the fast acquisition of lands. Idukki, one of the districts in Kerala which has no railway station, will get railway connectivity and two railway stations through the line. The railway line will help the wood‚Äìbased and rice‚Äìbased industries concentrated in the Perumbavoor‚ÄìKalady area, and the tourist destinations of Ernakulam, Idukki and Kottayam districts.  Stations  Proposed new railway stations in I Phase are Kalady, Perumbavoor, Odakkali, Kothamangalam, Muvattupuzha, Vazhakulam, Thodupuzha, Karimkunnam, Ramapuram, Palai, Erattupetta, Kanjirappally and Erumeli. During II Phase stations at Ranni, Adoor, Pathanamthitta, Konni, Koodal, Pathanapuram will be connected to and there join Kollam‚ÄìSengottai branch line. Since it provides a railway facility to Sabarimala pilgrims and the number of pilgrims visiting Sabarimala temple is more than the total population of Kerala, this railway line was named Sabarimala railway. It is operated by division of the Southern Railway zone.

It is in Jajpur District in the Indian state of Odisha. This handicraft received the Geographical Indication tag by the Government of India in 2009. Tussar textiles are related to dhoti, joda, Shawl stole, scarves and saris. Process The process starts with drafting and crafting Thread Females usually assist in reeling the tussar threads holding 'natai' in their right hand and unwinding the thread around the cocoons with their other hand. Twisting the filament, the weaver winds the yarns on the wooden 'natai' at a continuous speed. Embellishments are done by hand, either with extra weft or extra warp with a 'bandha' pattern in hand. The embellishments increase the value of the fabric. Alternatively, reeling machines are available. Spinning Traditionally, thread is wound around the chadaki to fill the bobins (nali) for weft with the help of a spinning wheel (charakha). Gandhi charakha or wooden charakha have been replaced by a metal part. Weaving Fabric is woven using a 'cut shuttle technique', in which shuttles interlock with one another to form foda kumbha in the weft direction. Shuttles on both sides interlock with the main shuttle for the main body of the fabic. By tie and die bandha technique, the foda kumbha pattern is copied for multiple productions. Design Threads are dyed in different shades, such as maroon, red, plum and rust. Fabrics are designed in tussar and gheecha and enhanced with a weft and cut shuttle technique. Industry Fabrics are mainly marketed by PWCS and SHGs traders through the Boyanika (OSHWCS), Sambalpuri Bastralaya, SERIFED, Pvt. traders. Sales also take place at exhibitions and in local markets. According to a 2013-14 survey, 745 looms operate in this cluster. Around 5,000 people are dependent on this industry for income.

It is a basement built approximately 1300 by Cistercian monks. The basement was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 1 January 1959. The listing is officially \\"Den Gr√• Kannikeg√•rd\\" (English: The Grey Canon House) which refers to the entirety of the building on the address although only the basement beneath it is protected. The structure is situated in the historic Latin Quarter neighbourhood on Store Torv adjacent to the Cathedral.  Basement  The basement is a number of vaulted rooms with arched columns made of brick. It was constructed by Cistercian monks in the 1300s but not much else is known about it or the structure originally above it. The front entrance carries a sign stating that it was built by the monks and that they used it as a dining hall. There is, however, no evidence to support the latter claim. Another myth states that a secret tunnel leads from the basement to the nearby Cathedral but this is also not true.  Bar  The basement was first used as a bar in 1712 when the local postmaster operated a wine store there but it is not known for how long. In 1885 Albert Christian Thorup opened a new wine store and in 1903 he was granted permission to run a bar. Albert Thorup had strong religious convictions and forbade women from the premises since he believed the Old Testament stated the women were bad for wine. In 1919 Thorup moved to Bourdeaux to open a new business and his son Knud Thorup took over the bar in Aarhus. In 1942 Knud Thorup retired and gave the business to his daughter and son-in-law Kristen and Erik Thorup Christensen. The bar continued with no major changes to the rooms until 1959 when the basement was listed and protected. C. F. M√∏ller Architects have since renovated and decorated the rooms and the director of the Old Town Museum Helge S√∏gaard designed the chairs. Kirsten and Erik Thorup Christensen managed the bar until the mid-80s when it was sold to Albert Hill and since to Mike Wilson.

Each stack of speakers in this setup consists of two EAW SB1000 slanted baffle subwoofers (each contains two 18\\" drivers) and two EAW KF850 full-range cabinets for the mid and high frequencies. A professional audio store is a retail business that sells, and in many cases rents, sound reinforcement system equipment and PA system components used in music concerts, live shows, dance parties and speaking events. This equipment typically includes microphones, power amplifiers, electronic effects units (e.g., reverb and compression effects), speaker enclosures, monitor speakers, subwoofers and audio consoles (mixers).http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p3VD.pl?Function=getVD&TVD;=118464&CVD;=118471&CPV;=334310&CST;=01012012&CLV;=5&MLV;=5 Some professional audio stores also sell sound recording equipment, DJ equipment, lighting equipment used in nightclubs and concerts and video equipment used in events, such as video projectors and screens. Some professional audio stores rent \\"backline\\" equipment used in rock and pop shows, such as stage pianos and bass amplifiers. While professional audio stores typically focus on selling new merchandise, some stores also sell used equipment, which is often the equipment that the company has previously rented out for shows and events. Terminology Professional audio stores are also called \\"pro audio stores\\", \\"pro sound stores\\", \\"sound reinforcement\\" companies, \\"PA system companies\\" or \\"audio-visual companies\\", with the latter name being used when a store supplies a significant amount of video equipment for events, such as video projectors and screens. Stores often use the word \\"professional\\" in their name or the description of their store, to differentiate their stores from consumer electronics stores, which sell consumer-grade loudspeakers, home cinema equipment, and amplifiers, which are designed for private, in-home use. Products Pro audio stores carry a range of microphones that can be used for different live sound and recording applications. Pro audio stores carry a range of microphones used in live sound and recording, including specialized mics such as drum mics. Stores typically carry wireless systems which enable microphones and electric instruments to be played without cables. Recording gear includes audio interfaces, studio monitors, audio recorders, studio subwoofers, analog-digital and digital- analog converters, studio power amplifiers and duplication equipment. Live sound equipment includes sound reinforcement system loudspeaker enclosures, loudspeakers, monitor speakers, power amplifiers and subwoofers. Headphone equipment includes studio and DJ headphones, headphone amplifiers and headphone mixers. Audio consoles include live sound mixers, powered mixers (which have a built-in power amplifier), unpowered mixers and digital mixers. Signal processing gear includes DI boxes, crossovers and a range a of electronic effects, which are typically rackmountable units, including: microphone preamplifiers, electronic vocal processors, exciters, equalizers, compressors and limiters, feedback suppressors and noise gates. Some stores also sell audio software, such as DAW software, signal processing software and virtual instruments. Other products While some pro audio stores only sell audio equipment, others also sell products in other categories that are used in rock concerts and DJ events, such as portable stages, stage lights, par cans and light stands. Some stores sell coloured lights, lasers and strobe lights which flash, change colours and/or move according to the beat of the music; these lights are used in nightclubs and rave dance events. Some stores also sell fog machines, which are used in dances, concerts and theatre productions, often to enhance the appearance of the lighting and laser effects. Some pro audio stores sell a range of DJ equipment, such as direct drive turntables, record cartridges and styli, DJ CD players and DJ mixers.

Prior to working at the Brennan Center, he worked as a corporate litigator at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan and as a bankruptcy lawyer at Hahn & Hessen. Research and views Voting machines and registration As a deputy director for the Brennan Center for Justice, Norden is known for his research on voting machines and other election infrastructure in the United States. For example, a 2011 study by Norden found that as many as 60,000 votes cast in New York elections in 2010 were invalid because when casting them, the voters accidentally voted for multiple candidates, a problem the study attributed to both software errors and ambiguous instructions. In 2013, he told NPR that one in eight voter registration records is inaccurate, and that because registration \\"doesn't follow people when they move, even though a lot of people think it does,\\" poll workers cannot find the names of some voters on election day. Campaign finance reform Norden has argued that six decisions by the Roberts Supreme Court have transformed the way American political campaigns are funded, largely for the worse. He expressed concern about the increased amount of dark money spent on the 2014 midterm elections, which he attributes, in part, to the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision. He has advocated for requiring government contractors to disclose political spending and tax credits for small campaign donations to increase the political participation and voice of average citizens.

The film was directed by James Beveridge, who also produced and directed a similar NFB documentary, Look to the North. The film's French version title is Pi√®ge √† Nippon.  Synopsis  In 1943, Alaska and the north Pacific have become a theatre of war as Japanese forces threaten. For over a decade, Japan had begun training for warfare in a subarctic region, and had targeted the Aleutian Islands where they had maintained a foothold. Both Canadian and American forces are assembled to protect and defend the region, in what came to be known as the Aleutian Islands Campaign. In 1942, U.S. Army engineers created the Alaska Highway, carved out of the northern bush to bring American troops and supplies northward. Canada's role is to construct airfields alongside the military highway and train troops to fight in the extreme conditions of the region. Out of Canadian ports on the west coast, ship convoys carrying war materi√©l supply the various outposts of the northwest, while patrol bombers and lookouts keep a constant vigil. The Japanese invasion of the Aleutian Islands is countered by both a ground and air attack by Allied forces. With the defeat of the Japanese on American territory, Allied strategy moves from defence to taking the fight to the Japanese empire across the Pacific, striking at the heart of Japan. Production Typical of the NFB's documentary short films, Pincers on Japan was created as a morale boosting \\"polemic\\" or propaganda film during the Second World War.Morris, Peter. \\"Film Reference Library: Canada Carries On.\\" Canadian Film Encyclopedia. Retrieved: January 31, 2016. The film relied heavily on newsreel material including \\"enemy\\" footage, and combined multiple sources to create a story.Leach and Sloniowski 2003, p. 118.

Greene, known for his work on both radio broadcasts as a news announcer at CBC as well as narrating many of the Canada Carries On series.Bennett 2004, p. 254. His sonorous recitation led to his nickname, \\"The Voice of Canada\\", and to some observers, the \\"voice-of-God\\".Rist 2001, p. 84.

Reception Pincers on Japan was produced in 35 mm for the theatrical market and was shown over a six-month period as part of the shorts or newsreel segments in approximately 800 theatres across Canada and later, the United States. The NFB had an arrangement with Famous Players theatres to ensure that Canadians from coast- to-coast could see them, with further distribution by Columbia Pictures.Ellis and McLane 2005, p. 122. After the six-month theatrical tour ended, individual films were made available on 16 mm to schools, libraries, churches and factories, extending the life of these films for another year or two.

Education Ethel Spears was born in Chicago, Illinois, on October 5, 1903, and grew up in the Beverly area. After high school, she entered the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC), where she studied textiles and earned a certificate after completing a three- year program. Having already lost interest in textiles, she immediately re- enrolled in SAIC to study fine arts. Spears chose to study under the most avant-garde member of the faculty, muralist John W. Norton. With his mentorship, she won the opportunity to paint two murals in the SAIC tearoom. Around 1925, Spears graduated from SAIC and decided to move to Woodstock, New York to study with the sculptor Alexander Archipenko. Nine months later she moved to New York City, where she stayed for some five years. She took classes at the Art Students League and New York University and supported herself with odd jobs. Around 1929‚Äì30, she spent time in Paris, France, afterwards moving back to Chicago. Enrolling once more at SAIC, she earned her master's degree. Art and teaching Spears became known for her cartoonish, droll watercolors of daily life in Chicago and New York: in streets and parks, on playgrounds and beaches, and inside schools and apartments. She also painted a few rural landscapes. Like some of Ilonka Karasz's New Yorker covers, the outdoor scenes often show a bird's eye view of people all going their separate ways. The critic C. J. Bulliet wrote that her canvases \\"are alive with tiny figures\\" who are \\"doing humorous things without knowing it.\\" A master of composition, Spears packs her images with vivid and telling details. Her style has been compared to that of Peggy Bacon, though Spears's caricatures are less harsh. Spears worked mostly in watercolor, but also in oil and gouache. Spears exhibited regularly throughout her life, mostly in Chicago and New York, at galleries and museums such as the Brooklyn Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Corcoran Gallery. She was very active as a muralist, completing more than two dozen murals in the Chicago area alone, many of them through the Works Progress Administration. These included murals at the University of Illinois and at public buildings like schools and post offices; for example, she painted a mural of the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus at a school named for him. She was a member of the National Society of Mural Painters. In 1937, Spears was hired as an art teacher at SAIC, and she continued to teach classes there for 24 years. She taught a range of subjects, including design, painting, and ceramics. She established SAIC's departments of enamelling and silkscreen printing and taught those courses as well. Murals The Flagg-Rochelle Public Library contains a mural, Merry Go Round by Ethel Spears, painted and installed in 1938. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The WPA was the largest and most ambitious American New Deal agency, employing individuals to carry out public works projects. In 2019 several of Spears' WPA murals were removed from Chicago area middle schools because of concern that the subjects depicted are primarily white and do not match the diversity of the student body today. By the late 1950s, Spears was suffering from an illness that may have been lead poisoning from her work with enamelling.

It is used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1 or 4 infection in both treatment-na√Øve and treatment-experienced patients. Both elbasvir and grazoprevir were developed by Merck & Co. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug on 28 January 2016. Medical uses Elbasvir/grazoprevir received FDA approval in January 2016. Its indication is for treatment of chronic hepatitis C of the genotypes 1 and 4 for adults. Hepatitis C is a global disease that infects upwards of 150 million people worldwide, especially in older generations. Hepatitis C causes inflammation of the liver that eventually leads to diminished liver function or even failure. Zepatier is indicated for treatment with or without use of ribavirin, as well. Zepatier has shown enough efficacy to be considered a first line of treatment for first-time patients with GT 1a and 1b, with or without cirrhosis. It is recommended for non-naive patients of the same genotypes, in addition to patients of GT4. Dosing There is one FDA approved dosing regimen. It consists of 50 mg of elbasvir and 100 mg of grazoprevir. Genetic testing for genotype 1 is recommended to determine if the patient is NS5A resistant before the initial treatment. This resistance results in a likely decrease in SRV12. Dosage is taken once daily over the most common span of 12-weeks. Elbasvir/grazoprevir is oftentimes prescribed with ribavirin for patients with renal impairment. \\"Zepatier is available as a beige-colored, oval-shaped, film-coated tablet debossed with \\"770\\" on one side and plain on the other.\\" {  !Patient population !Treatment !Duration - Genotype 1a: Treatment-na√Øve or PegIFN/RBV-experienced without baseline NS5A polymorphisms Zepatier 12 weeks - Genotype 1a: Treatment-na√Øve or PegIFN/RBV-experienced with baseline NS5A polymorphisms Zepatier + ribavirin 16 weeks - Genotype 1b: Treatment-na√Øve or PegIFN/RBV-experienced Zepatier 12 weeks - Genotype 1a¬ß or 1b: PegIFN/RBV/PI-experienced Zepatier + ribavirin 12 weeks - Genotype 4: Treatment-na√Øve Zepatier 12 weeks - Genotype 4: PegIFN/RBV- experienced Zepatier + ribavirin 16 weeks - } Interactions and contraindications Grazoprevir is transported by the solute carrier proteins SLCO1B1 and SLCO1B3. Drugs that inhibit this proteins, such as rifampicin, ciclosporin, and a number of HIV medications (atazanavir, darunavir, lopinavir, saquinavir, tipranavir, cobicistat), can cause a significant increase in grazoprevir blood plasma levels. Combination of elbasvir/grazoprevir with these drugs is therefore contraindicated. on Zepatier. Both elbasvir and grazoprevir are degraded by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Combination with drugs that induce this enzyme, such as efavirenz, carbamazepine or St. John's wort, is contraindicated because it can lead to ineffectively low plasma levels of elbasvir and grazoprevir. Combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase plasma levels and is not recommended by the manufacturer. Side effects Common side effects during treatment include feeling tired, nausea, reduced appetite, and headache. Low red blood cell count has occurred when co-administered with ribavirin in some cases. The most important risks are Alanine transaminase elevation, hyperbilirubinemia, drug resistance development and drug interactions. Pharmacology Mechanism of action Elbasvir targets the NS5A protein, which effectively prevents the transcription of the HCV RNA and also prevents virion assembly. \\"Median EC50 values range from 0.2 to 3600 pmol/L, based on genotype.\\" Grazoprevir is an protease inhibitor targeting HCV NS3/4A serine protease. Effectively grazoprevir prevents cleavage of the necessary polyproteins for replication. Pharmacokinetics Clinical studies A C-SALVAGE Phase 2 trial on safety and efficacy was reported in 2015. One randomized, open-label study was done on patients that had previous failure of a ribavirin/peginterferon treatment. SVR24 occurred in 96% of the patients with only 3 individuals relapsing. Additional Phase 2 trials were examined under the names: C-SWIFT, C-WORTHY, and C-WORTHY Coinfection. The first trial studied shorter dosing periods of 4, 6, or 8 weeks. C-SWIFT showed that the longer the time of treatment, the better the SVR results among patients. C-WORTHY study combined elbasvir with grazoprevir and additionally ribavirin in cases of cirrhosis. This demographic of patients is the most treatment refractory and the study showed that the ribavirin did not improve effects. C-WORTHY Coinfection studied patients with HCV and HIV. Treatments of monoinfected patients and coinfected patients resulted in better SRV12 for the patients with coinfection and treated with ribrivin, too, at 97%. Phase 3 study results of the drug were released in 2016. Results from C-EDGE IBLD show high rates of sustained virological response (SVR) after the completion of the prescribed treatment. This was examined 12-weeks after (SRV12). Safety profiles were consistent with previous studies. This study was a randomized, double-blind and placebo- controlled. 93% of the patients included in these studies showed SVR12 and had been cured of the virus. C-EDGE CO-STAR showed high SVR after 24-weeks. This studied reaffirmed results from studies of the previous year. The study was double-blind and placebo-controlled. Patients had HCV GT1, GT4, or GT6 and were on opioid therapy. Upwards of 96% of the patients achieved SVR24. This study contributed to the knowledge of the incidence of HCV reinfection in patients who receive drug injection of opioid treatments. This is a demographic that the medical community is typically reluctant to treat due to concerns of reinfection and compliance. Society and culture Patents U.S. Patent No. 8871759 was published in 2014 for the specified compounds useful for hepatitis C virus NS5A inhibitors. The patent protects Merck's formulation for the drug and its other associated salt forms, hydrates, solvates, prodrugs and isomers. U.S. Patent No. 7973040 was published in 2011. The patent protects the invention by Merck of the macrocyclic compound within the formula as an inhibitor for NS3 protease. The patent describes the formulation of the compound and its salts, along with its uses and potential implications as an HCV antiviral treatment. Commercialization Elbasvir/grazoprevir was FDA approved in the United States, but has also been approved for use in the European Union, Canada, Japan, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Switzerland. Zepatier is one of a few non-interferon therapies that are market-available. Competing treatments include Gilead's Harvoni (sofosbuvir and ledipasvir) and AbbVie's Viekira Pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir). Sale projections for Zepatier are $636 million in 2016 and rising to $1.5 billion by 2020. With Merck's release of Zepatier early in 2016, they saw large bumps in share prices in quarters 1 and 2, but are expected to drop down a bit. Zepatier does not have as strong a market hold as other competitive HCV treatments. Cost Estimated costs for a 12-week treatment of elbasvir/grazoprevir are upwards of $54,600. Other treatments that work in a similar manner have effectively more costs. Some treatments for Hepatitis C are on the cheaper side, in some instances as low as $8,400. Additional ribavirin costs can add between $500 and $900. These cheaper prescriptions are however interferon-based treatments and do not target every genotype of the HCV. These regimens were the priority treatment before 2011. Two examples of these treatments are alfa-2a and alfa-2b costing $9250 and $8400, respectively.

Biography  Early life and education Matsak started taking dance classes when she was 4 years old.http://news.tut.by/culture/106161.html After dancing with the children's dance company Dudarik she went on to study ballet. From 1992 to 2000 Matsak studied at the Kiev State Ballet School. Her first significant performance on the stage of the National Opera House of Ukraine took place during her senior year. Along with her groupmate Andrey Gura she made a performance of pas de deux from Don Quixote (to the music of Ludwig Minkus). Getting started in the National Opera House of Ukraine After graduating from the Kiev State Ballet School, Matsak joined the ballet company of the National Opera House of Ukraine. At the same time the leadership of the ballet company was taken over by the principal dancer, People's Artist of Ukraine Victor Yaremenko, who was interested in working with young artists, who were open to new ideas and plot concepts. The 18-year-old ballerina's professional debut was a pas de trois in the Kingdom of the Shades in La Bayad√®re (to the music of Minkus) and the premiere of Viennese Waltz on the stage of the National Opera House of Ukraine in 2001 (to the music of Johann Strauss, musical composition of A. Baklan, ballet master Aniko Rekhviashvili). Principal dancer of the National Opera House of Ukraine In 2001 Matsak a received the new official title ‚Äî principal dancer of the National Opera House of Ukraine. This gave her access to the parts in the ballet of academic heritage such as Le Corsaire (A. Adam), Don Quixote (L. Minkus), Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty (P. Tchaikovsky), Raymonda (A. Glazunov) and others. In 2004 Matsak took part in the Fifth Serge Lifar International Ballet Competition in Kiev, receiving the Diploma of Laureate (2nd place). Within the competition she performed pas de deux from the classical repertoire (Swan Lake, Le Corsaire), and a modern dance called Dream Dance with Maksim Motkov (to the music of Kitaro-Chernenko, ballet master Aniko Rekhviashvili). In 2005 she won 3rd place in the Tenth Moscow International Ballet Competition and Contest of Choreographers. Among many of her performances, there was a variation of Odette from Swan Lake, a variation of Kitri from the 1st act of Don Quixote, a variation of Gamzatti from La Bayadere, a modern dance Say it Quieter, If You Can (ballet master Yevgeniy Chernov) and others. Matask's performance was recognised by Olga Lepeshinskaya, Yury Grigorovich, Mikhail Lavrovskiy, Natalia Bessmertnova, Natalia Makarova and others. This recognition led to the title in her home theater of prima ballerina of the National Opera House of Ukraine. In 2006 Matsak won first place (Gold medal in the senior group) in the Sixth Serge Lifar International Ballet Competition in Kiev. Of special interest to the audience and the award panel was the performance called \\"The Way\\", (to the music of J. Massenet, ballet master Dmitriy Klyavin).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wD-ImMGdNhM She won the highest prize. In the same year she received an invitation to play one of the main parts in the ballet Daniela (to the music of Mykhaylo Chemberzhi, ballet master Aniko Rekhviashvili). National Academic Bolshoi Opera and Ballet Theatre of Belarus As Kitri in \\"Don Quixote\\" From 2006 to 2008 Matsak was performing on the stage of the National Academic Bolshoi Opera and Ballet Theatre of Belarus in Minsk, where she had been invited by the artistic director of the theater Valentin Elizariev. Her performances included Swan Lake (2006), Gala concert dedicated to Elizariev's 60th anniversary (2007), and Don Quixote (2008). National Theater of Japan In January 2009 \\"An Evening with Igor Kolb\\" the principal dancer of the Mariinsky Theater took place in Tokyo. For this event Matsak performed Grand Pas Classique (to the music of Daniel Auber, choreography by V. Gzovskiy) in duet with Mikhail Kaniskin, the soloist of the ballet company of the Berlin State Opera.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34ZenXTxYRE Mikhailovsky Theater in Saint Petersburg In April 2009 the Ukrainian ballerina performed on the stage of Mikhailovsky Theater in St. Petersburg, where she played the part of Medora in the version of Le Corsaire (A. Adam) revised by Farukh Ruzimatov. At the same time she took part in the concert dedicated to the achievements of Yelena Scheglova, the Honored Artist of Russia and People's Artist of Tatarstan (Kazan, M. Dzhalil Tatar Academic State Opera and Ballet Theater). Cooperation with Boris Eifman As Carmen in \\"Carmen Suite\\" In August 2010 the first-night of Boris Eifman's I am Don Quixote (to the music of L. Minkus) took place on the stage of Alexandrinsky Theater in St. Petersburg. This was followed by 18 months of touring with the Eifman ballet across Europe and the US. Dortmund Opera House In 2011 in Dortmund Matsak worked with Raimondo Rebeck, a German ballet master (modern dance) and a graduate of the Berlin Ballet School. As a part of the ballet concert along with the ballet company of the Dortmund Opera House, she prepared a duet dance called Yesterday. Today. Tomorrow (to the music of Max Richter On the nature of the daylight) with Howard Lopez.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ygUQTx6M-g Tours During 2007-2011 Matsak was a regular guest at the International Festival of Classical Ballet named after Rudolf Nureyev in Kazan (–•–•-XXIV). The parts performed by her at the festival were Odette-Odile from Swan Lake, Medora from Le Corsaire, the Queen of the Dryads from Don Quixote, Gamzatti and Nikiya from La Bayad√®re, the Lilac Fairy from Sleeping Beauty. At the same time the ballerina constantly toured with the ballet companies of the National Opera House of Ukraine and other international theaters, performing on stages in Italy, Spain, Portugal, United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Korea. Honored Artist of Ukraine As Carmen in \\"Carmen Suite\\" Matsak's work was closely intertwined with performances on the stage of the National Opera House of Ukraine. Since 2008 Matsak she has been awarded with the title Honored Artist of Ukraine according to a Decree of the President of Ukraine Victor Yushenko. In April 2010 there was An Evening with Natalia Matsak which was dedicated to the first 10 years of her ballet career. The performances chosen to be staged were Carmen Suite (to the music of G. Bizet and Rodion Shchedrin, ballet master A. Alonso) and Scheherazade (to the music of N. Rimsky-Korsakov, choreography by M. Fokine, revised by V. Yaremenko). In winter 2014 Matsak took part in the project \\"Irina Kolesnikova invites...\\", held in the Palais des congr√®s de Paris, where she performed as Nikiya in \\"La Bayadere\\" and Odile-Odette in \\"Swan Lake\\" with Vadim Muntagirov, principal dancer with the Royal Ballet in London.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULPv4nt7tsw In summer 2015 an \\"Irina Kolesnikova season\\" took place in the London Coliseum, where she performed as Odile-Odette in \\"Swan Lake\\" with Kimin Kim, principal dancer with the Mariinsky Theater, and as Gamzatti in \\"La Bayadere\\" with Denis Rodkin, principal dancer of the Bolshoi Ballet Company.http://www.rutage.com/kolesnikova/ In December 2015 within the tour Ave Maya! in memory of Maya Plisetskaya she performed on the stages of Dnepropetrovsk, Kiev, Odessa and Chisinau (Moldova). 2016 started with performances in \\"Swan Lake\\" and \\"Nutcracker\\" in Amsterdam (the Netherlands) and Belgrade (Serbia), and also in \\"Don Quixote\\" in Riga (Latvia). Cooperation with Denys Nedak Matsak has performed in duet with Honored Artist of Ukraine, leading soloist of the National Opera House of Ukraine, Denys Nedak.

These conspiracy theories include claims that agribusinesses, especially Monsanto, have suppressed data showing that GMOs cause harm, deliberately cause food shortages to promote the use of GM food, or have co-opted government agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration or scientific societies such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Critics charge that GMO conspiracy theories are largely promulgated by those opposing the production and sale of GMOs, and instances of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories have lately occurred in the context of public health issues that are mostly unrelated to GMOs, including the 2015‚Äì16 Zika virus outbreak and concerns over food safety at Chipotle Mexican Grill. Context The existence of conspiracy theories relating to the fear over GMOs has been attested to by scientists, journalists, and skeptics who oppose much anti-GMO activism. Such commentators include Michael Shermer (writer of a monthly Skeptic column series for Scientific American),Shermer, Michael. \\"Conspiracy Central.\\" Scientific American 311.6 (2014): 94‚Äì94. Mark Lynas (an environmental activist and writer who opposed GMOs for years and recently switched positions), and Jon Entine (the founder and head of an advocacy organization dedicated to advancing the case in favor of genetic engineering in agriculture and biotechnology). Academics writing about bioethics and science communication have also taken note. A 2013 paper published in the journal PLOS ONE found statistical evidence that linked conspiracy theorist ideation as being a significant factor in the rejection of scientific propositions about genetically engineered food. One GMO conspiracy theory was identified by biochemist Paul Christou and horticulturalist Harry Klee as a claim that development and promotion of GMOs was done by pesticide companies to cause crops to become more vulnerable to pests and therefore require more pesticides, while philosopher Juha R√§ikk√§ identified a conspiracy theory that claims the lack of any reliable scientific evidence that show harmful effects of GMOs is due not to a lack of evidence but rather to a conspiracy to hide that evidence. Conspiracy theories involving GMOs and their promoters have been invoked in a variety of contexts. For example, in commenting on the S√©ralini affair, an incident that involved the retraction of a much-criticized paper which claimed harmful effects of GMOs in lab rats, American biologist PZ Myers said that anti-GMO activists were claiming the retraction was a part of \\"a conspiracy to Hide the Truth‚Ñ¢\\". A work seeking to explore risk perception over GMOs in Turkey identified a belief among the conservative political and religious figures who were opposed to GMOs that GMOs were \\"a conspiracy by Jewish Multinational Companies and Israel for world domination\\" while a Latvian study showed that a segment of the population of that country believed that GMOs were part of a greater conspiracy theory to poison the population of the country. A study of media rhetorical devices used in Hunan, China found that the news articles that were opposed to trials of golden rice promoted conspiracy theories \\"including the view that the West was using genetic engineering to establish global control over agriculture and that GM products were instruments for genocide\\". Likewise, a study of the rhetoric used in public policy debates about genetically modified food in Ghana showed that conspiracy theories were a feature of a civil society opposition to GMOs: > Government and scientists were denying the claim that GMO was discriminatory > and posed significant human health risk, as well as the call to action to do > something about GMOs. Civil society adapted the counter rhetoric of > insincerity, claiming that scientists had some kind of ‚Äúhidden agenda‚Äù > behind their claim, such as eagerness to just earn money from their patents > on GMOs. It is imperative that communication on GMOs includes the underlying > assumptions, the uncertainties and the probabilities associated with both > best and worst case scenarios. This is a necessary condition to minimise > misinformation on GMOs but may be insufficient to completely erase > conspiracy theories from the minds of the public especially when scientists > and government are perceived to be biased towards multinational corporations > that are ostensibly preoccupied with making profits. Social critic Margit Stange contextualized certain arguments adopted by GMO conspiracy theorists as being part of the larger controversy surrounding the subject: > The corporate push for genetically modified food arouses great suspicion. > Critics charge that GM food (\\"Frankenfood\\") is profitable to industry not > only because it can be patented but because crop uniformity will eventually > drive up pesticide demand. The charge that big food interests take advantage > of poverty to open new markets for GM food is restated by conspiracy > theorists, who describe a deliberate macroeconomic creation of food > shortages in impoverished nations in order to open the door to GM food. The > food industry's opposition to GM food labeling and precautionary measures > fuels such suspicions. This view was echoed by bioethicist Michael Reiss and moral philosopher Roger Straughan who explain in their book Improving Nature?: The Science and Ethics of Genetic Engineering that fears about the consolidation of power by a few agrochemical companies over farmers is a main argument against new genetic engineering technology in agriculture: \\"At its extreme, this fear belongs to the conspiracy-theory genre and, to caricature somewhat, envisages powerless farmers forced to pay ever increasing amounts to anonymous international companies who profit from the cost of the crop seed and from the cost of the herbicides used to spray them.\\" Political science professors Joseph Uscinski and Joseph M. Parent in their book American Conspiracy Theories summarized the people that have adopted GMO conspiracy theories thusly: > Another prototypical conspiratorial movement involves those opposed to > genetically modified organisms (GMO), in essence a protest against the > genetic engineering of food. Not everyone who opposes GMOs is a conspiracy > theorist: reasonable people can disagree about research and fail to see > small groups of people covertly working against the common good. But most > visible and vocal members of this movement, however, are conspiracy > theorists. They believe that genetically modified foods are a corporate > plot, led by the giant multinational Monsanto, to profit off unhealthy food. Uscinski, writing for Politico in the context of the 2016 United States presidential election, identified GMO conspiracy theories as one of the \\"honorable mentions\\" appended to his list of the \\"five most dangerous conspiracy theories of 2016\\". He specifically singled-out candidates Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein as promulgators. Michael Shermer and Pat Linse, writing for Skeptic magazine, specify that in terms of political ideology, \\"GMO conspiracy theories are embraced primarily by those on the left.\\" Scholars have identified ways that the internet has aided proliferation and connection between conspiracy theories including those about GMOs. For example, computer scientists Tanushree Mitra and Mattia Samory found in a 2018 study that \\"[to]pics [such as] ‚Äúbig pharma,‚Äù ‚Äúvaccines,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGMO,‚Äù for example, decry the corruption of health services while promoting the virtues of a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù lifestyle.\\" MIT Technology Review reported in February 2018 that Russian- backed disinformation campaigns were sowing public confusion about GMOs by promoting conspiracy theories. Monsanto A major aspect of many conspiracy theories is the fear that large agribusinesses, especially Monsanto are working to undermine the health and safety of the general public by introducing and promoting GMOs in the food supply. One claim is that Monsanto is deliberately hiding scientific evidence that GMOs are harmful. Some anti- GMO activists claimed that Monsanto infiltrated both the American Food and Drug Administration and the American Association for the Advancement of Science which is why the two organizations have supported the scientific evidence for the safety of the genetically engineered food available for human consumption. Jeffrey M. Smith is identified in the book American Conspiracy Theories as arguing that Monsanto has captured the FDA and many other countries. In the compendium Agricultural and Food Controversies, the authors who are social scientists and food scientists trace the conspiracy theory relating in particular to Monsanto back to events in the early 1990s: > There are some well-qualified dissenting scientists and a motivated group of > food activists behind them, pushing back against GM food. They believe a GM > crop is not substantially equivalent to traditional crops. Moreover, they > believe that the FDA follows the substantial equivalence rule not because of > the science, but because the FDA was corrupted by corporate influence. This > is not a belief that the authors' share, but there are smart people of high > character who do believe this conspiracy theory, and their side of the story > deserves to be heard. > > In The World According to Monsanto, author Marie-Monique Robin describes how > the substantial equivalence began with a 1992 policy statement by the FDA > under the leadership of a former Monsanto lawyer, who, after working in the > FDA, returned to Monsanto as vice president. Her story suggests that GM > regulations were the product of a revolving-door system where regulators are > former and/or future employees of the company being regulated (note that > some argue Monsanto wanted excess regulations to keep out competitors, but > that is not Robin's story). It is not hard to imagine a company rewarding > lenient regulators with a nice job, and food activists have websites listing > powerful government officials and their relation to Monsanto and other > corporations. If this sounds like a conspiracy theory (a term not meant as a > euphemism), it is. Belief that Monsanto is particularly problematic has inspired such actions as the March Against Monsanto and the singling out of Monsanto over other agribusinesses such as DuPont, Syngenta, Dow, BASF and Bayer, and has been identified as a salient feature of anti-GMO activism. An example of Monsanto- based conspiracy theorizing were the claims by some anti-GMO activists that Monsanto banned GMOs from their cafeterias while promoting them for sale and consumption by the public. Anti-GMO/chemtrail blogger Barbara H. Peterson, a retired correctional officer and rancher, complained that Monsanto \\"has painted those of us attempting to shed light on the dangers of genetically modified/engineered organisms (GMOs) as 'conspiracy theorists'....\\" She went on to attack Monsanto's suggestion that sabotage could be a possible explanation for the discovery of a few plants of experimental genetically modified wheat found inexplicably growing on a farm in Oregon as being a conspiracy theory itself. GMO cannabis hoax A 2015 internet hoax purporting to show that Monsanto was creating genetically modified cannabis to supply to the cannabis industry. The hoax was created by satirical fake news website World News Daily Report on April 9, 2015. Monsanto created a \\"standing denial\\" of the hoax on their \\"Myths About Monsanto\\" webpage, and tweeted a disclaimer prior to the 420 holiday in 2016, and on April 20, 2017 again tweeted \\"Happy 4-20. Time for our yearly reminder: Monsanto has not and is not working on GMO marijuana.\\"  Zika virus  In January 2016, concerns over a Zika virus outbreak were accompanied by claims first published on Reddit that the virus was being spread by a genetically modified mosquito. The fears were based in part because of a new mosquito abatement initiative led by Oxitec‚Äîmale mosquitoes (which do not bite) are genetically modified to be sterile, and released to mate with females, resulting in no offspring, thereby reducing the Aedes aegypti mosquito population that spreads tropical diseases such as Zika. The claims were identified as \\"unproven\\" by the debunking website snopes.com. Chipotle food safety In the context of ongoing concerns over food safety at Chipotle Mexican Grill certain commentators have implied that the outbreaks of food-borne illnesses were intentional sabotage by the biotech industry in retaliation over Chipotle's removal of GMOs from their menu. The claims were identified as \\"unproven\\" by the debunking website snopes.com. Ethical criticism In Scholars & Rogues, an online progressive political journal, David Lambert, a development program officer for the United Nations, compared the conspiracy theories supported by some in the anti-GMO movement to those supported in the anti-vaccination movement, > Like preventable childhood diseases, malnutrition is another great moral > failing of our time. GMOs such as golden rice‚Äîrice modified to contain high > levels of beta carotene in order to compensate for the vitamin A deficiency > which kills hundreds of thousands of children around the world and blinds > many more every year‚Äîand drought resistant crops, which will become > increasingly vital in the global south due to climate change, have vast > potential to help those who don't shop at Whole Foods. But real progress has > been stymied by the paranoid and misinformed, who clamor that GMOs, which > are biologically no different than \\"natural\\" foods, are somehow poisonous. > Behind it all is of course an evil corporation: Monsanto. Offering a similar critique Kavin Senapathy, a freelance writer and speaker who offers editorials from the perspective of the skeptical movement, wrote for Forbes that > Both [the anti-vaccine and anti-GMO movements] cite cherry-picked, > discredited, and retracted scientific studies, such as the 1998 Andrew > Wakefield study linking the MMR vaccine with autism, and the 2012 Gilles- > √âric S√©ralini rat study linking genetically engineered crops with cancer, > while ignoring the vast bodies of evidence against them.... And both lead to > injustice....It may seem that surely the anti-GMO movement is benign albeit > wrong, innocuous compared to anti-vaccine atrocities. It may appear that it > all boils down to some harmless non-GMO labels on grocery items. But it > turns out there is a human cost. The same movement that drives marketers to > source non-GMO ingredients also influences regulatory bodies around the > world. Crops are kept from regions in Africa where drought is a major > contributor to the complex causes of malnutrition, with researchers in > Tanzania forced to burn test fields of drought-tolerant corn rather than > feed starving local children. Disease-resistant crops languish due to > ideological regulations, with bananas resistant to xanthomonas wilt‚Äîwhich is > threatening food security in Uganda and eastern Africa where it‚Äôs a staple > crop‚Äîkept from farmers and people who need them.... Philosopher Giovanni Tagliabue argued that promoters of GMO conspiracy theories were being taken advantage of by anti-environmental corporate interests: > This ideological and political anti-corporate worldview, although sometimes > almost paranoid, is legitimate. Yet, while I do not argue whether this > attitude is good or bad, right or wrong, I maintain that the avowed anti- > industrial struggle in the field of green biotechnologies not only fails to > hit the supposed target, but benefits and supports a part of the industry > whose products have a stronger environmental impact than rDNA cultivars; in > addition, and more importantly, opposing GMOs generates heavy collateral > damage to public science, agricultural progress and the poor.

He is a planetary scientist and astrobiologist whose research focuses on understanding the differences between the evolution of planets, their atmospheres, and their potential for life. He has participated in NASA's Mars exploration program and contributed research to help find life elsewhere in the solar system and on planets orbiting other stars. He is also known for his work on the evolution of Earth's atmosphere and biosphere, particularly how Earth's atmosphere became rich in oxygen and allowed complex life to evolve.  Biography  David Catling completed a D.Phil. in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics at the University of Oxford in 1994. After working as a postdoctoral scholar and then research scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center from 1995-2001, he became a professor at the University of Washington in 2001. Since 2012, he has been a full professor at the University of Washington.  Research  In the area of the evolution of the Earth's atmosphere, Catling is known for a theory explaining how the Earth's crust accumulated large quantities of oxidized minerals and how the atmosphere became rich in oxygen. Geological records show that oxygen flooded the atmosphere in a Great Oxidation Event (GOE) about 2.4 billion years ago, even though bacteria that produced oxygen likely evolved hundreds of millions of years earlier. Catling's theory proposes that biological oxygen was initially used by reactions with chemicals in the environment; gradually, however, Earth's environment shifted to a tipping point where oxygen flooded the air. Atmospheric methane is the key part of this theory. Before oxygen was abundant, methane gas could reach concentrations hundreds of times greater than today's 1.8 parts per million. Ultraviolet light decomposes methane molecules in the upper atmosphere, causing hydrogen gas to escape into space. Over time, the irreversible atmospheric escape of hydrogen‚Äì a powerful reducing agent -caused Earth to oxidize and reach the GOE tipping point. Other studies about Earth's atmospheric oxygen have considered its second increase around 600 million years ago that acted as a precursor to the rise of animal life. Catling proposed looking at oxygen-sensitive variations in stable isotopes of selenium to trace atmospheric and seawater oxygen, and the results of such a study showed that Earth's second increase in oxygen occurred in fits and starts spread over about 100 million years. Catling also contributed to the first measurements of Earth's atmospheric thickness billions of years ago. He helped pioneer two techniques: using fossil raindrop imprints to set an upper limit on air density, which was applied to fossil imprints from 2.7 billion years ago, and using fossil bubbles in ancient lava flows, which suggests that air pressure 2.7 billion years ago was less than half that of the modern atmosphere. Catling has also researched the evolution of the atmosphere and surface of Mars. In the 1990s, he pioneered research on how the types of salts from dried-up lakes or seas on Mars could indicate the past environment and whether Mars was habitable. Since then, the discovery of salts and clays from former lakebeds has been a key success of missions to Mars by NASA and ESA. Catling was on the Science Team for NASA's Phoenix Lander mission, which in 2008 was the first spacecraft to land in the ice-rich high latitudes of Mars. Catling contributed to research that included the first scoops by a lander of water ice from below the surface of Mars and the first measurement of soluble salts in martian soil, including the soil pH. In experimental work with Jonathan Toner to examine low temperature solutions of perchlorate salts, as found on Mars, Toner and Catling discovered that such solutions supercool and never crystallize. The perchlorates form glasses (amorphous solids) around -120 ¬∞C. Glasses are known to be far better for preserving microbes and biological molecules than crystalline salts, which could be relevant to the search for life on Mars, Jupiter's moon Europa, and Saturn's moon Enceladus. In the field of planetary atmospheres, David Catling and Tyler Robinson have proposed a general explanation for a curious observation: the minimum air temperature between the troposphere (the lowest atmospheric layer where temperature declines with altitude) and stratosphere (where temperature increases with altitude in an 'inversion') occurs a pressure of about 0.1 bar on Earth, Titan, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. This level is the tropopause. Robinson and Catling used the physics of radiation to explain why the tropopause temperature minimum in these extremely different atmospheres occurs at a common pressure. They propose that a pressure around 0.1 bar could be a fairly general rule for planets with stratospheric temperature inversions. This rule could constrain the atmospheric structure on exoplanets and hence their surface temperature and habitability. Work by Catling and his students is also the first to accurately quantify the thermodynamic disequilibrium in planetary atmospheres of the Solar System, which has been proposed as a means to look for life remotely.

It was gazetted on 5 January 1888 under the provisions of the District Councils Act 1887 and included all the land defined by the hundreds of Black Rock Plain, Coomooroo, Erskine, Pekina, and Walloway in the County of Dalhousie. In 1898, it leased the new Orroroo Water District from the South Australian Government and became responsible for local water supply until 1963, when those responsibilities were transferred to the state Energy and Water Supply Department. It built its own powerhouse in 1923, and was responsible for electricity supply until 1962, when Orroroo was connected to the state grid. It had also undertaken a tree planting scheme at Orroroo, Pekina, Morchard, Yatina and Black Rock. In 1923, the municipality covered an area of 322,880 acres, approximately 500 square miles, and comprising the Hundreds of Black Rock Plains, Coomooroo, Erskine, Pekina and Walloway, each hundred having its own ward. It was responsible for 89¬Ω miles of main roads and 530 miles of district roads. It began sealing town streets in 1930, and finished all streets in the town by 1982.

Life and character Loanfoot House and its small estate no longer exists with only the name Loanfoot Avenue off Irvine Road next to Annanhill House commemorating its previous existence. When Robert inherited the estate from his father it was greatly in debt, however by the time of his death it was solvent.Purdie, Page 215 He worked as a wine and spirit merchant in Kilmarnock. Never of a strong constitution Robert died in 1788 at the age of only 29 from tuberculosis.Dougall, Page 212Purdie, Page 215 The Beanscroft Devil A most unusual story that has Robert Muir as a central participant with John Goldie the 'Philosopher' at its heart is the tale of the 'Beanscroft Devil' set at the time of the poet Robert Burns. The entrance lane to Beanscroft Farm. Beanscroft Farm lies on Grassyards Road in the parish of Fenwick in East Ayrshire a few miles to the west of Kilmarnock and the farmer there was known as a good, honest, hard work and God fearing member of the community, however strange happenings at the farmhouse and in the byres slowly convinced him and his family that he was being regularly tormented by none other a personage than the Devil himself. The other worldly disturbances had started in a minor way with sounds and movements that could be ascribed to the wind or the cat, however shifting furniture, strange shrieks and howls, etc. could not be so easily dismissed and the strange appearance of moving lights of different colours and the breaking of the ropes that tethered the cattle without signs of cutting were beyond any straight forward explanation. The farmer's son and heir had apparently done his best without success to solve the riddle, but his parents had always stayed rooted to the spot with fear in the farmhouse whilst the son ventured forth.Blair, Page 97 John Goldie the 'Philosopher' was God fearing, but had no truck with the presence on Earth of the Devil and made it known that he could solve this riddle in a Sherlock Holmes style of logical investigation. Despite his reservations the farmer invited him to the farm, accompanied by his friends, Mr Gillies of Kilmaurs the 'New Licht' minister and Robert Muir a Kilmarnock merchant and Kirk elder. After a number of questions relating to possible enemies and an inspection of the broken ropes he declared that this was the work of man and not the Devil. Swearing the farmer to secrecy he advised him to hide in the byre that night. Once darkness had fallen the farmer, hiding in the byre as instructed, became aware of the usual disturbances and suddenly saw a shadowy figure of a man holding a trumpet-like instrument with which he was making the unnatural sounds that had scared him so, rushing forward he seized the culprit only to find that it was his own son.Blair, Page 100 It transpired that the son had some knowledge of chemistry and had made what we would call coloured fireworks and that the ropes had been severed with Nitric Acid, then known as Aqua Fortis (strong water). John Goudie had logically deducted that the son, hoping to scare his father into retirement so that he could run the farm, was the 'Devil on Earth'. The 'philosophers' reputation was greatly enhanced whilst the son was mortified and humiliated to the extent that he left Ayrshire and was never seen in these parts again.Blair, Page 101 Association with Robert Burns Robert Burns Robert Muir first met the bard in 1786, probably at Kilmarnock's Bowling Green House Inn,Mckay, Page 230Mackay (1880), Page 132 and subscribed for no fewer that seventy-two copies of the 1786 Kilmarnock volume or \\"Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect\\" and forty of the 1787 Edinburgh Edition.Purdie, Page 215McKay, Page 234 He therefore played a central part in ensuring the publication of his friends poems.McKay, Page 139 He had tried to take sixty copies of the Edinburgh Edition but Burns, knowing his straightened circumstances, refused him, writing that \\"Your affair of sixty copies is also like you: but it would not be like me to comply.\\"Mackay, Page 262 He was one of the first people that Burns informed of the birth of his first twins carried by Jean Armour. Writing from Mossgiel Farm on the following morning of Friday 8 September 1786, Burns said: \\"My Friend My Brother, You will have heard that poor Armour has repaid my amorous mortgages double. A very fine boy and girl have awakened a thousand feelings that thrill, some with tender pleasure, and some with foreboding anguish, thro' my soul.\\"McKay, Page 195The Burns Encyclopaedia Burns' \\"Epitaph on Robert Muir\\" :- { border=\\"0\\" -  :\\"What Man could esteem, or what; :Woman could love,; :Was He who lies under this sod: :If Such Thou refusest admittance above, :Then whom wilt thou favor, Good God!Purdie, Page 215The Burns Encyclopaedia } On 13 December 1789 Burns wrote to Mrs Frances Dunlop in the strange 'conscience' letter about Highland Mary. Gilbert Burns wrote that the death of Robert, his closest Kilmarnock friend, in his thirtieth year deeply affected his brother,Mackay, Page 230 writing that \\"Mr Robert Muir, merchant in Kilmarnock, was one of those early friends that Robert's poetry procured him, and was dear to his heart.\\"Mackay (1880), Page 184 Burns stated that Robert Muir was one of those he hoped to meet : \\"if there is a world to come... There should I meet the friend, the disinterested friend of my early life: the man who rejoiced to see me, because he loved me and could serve meMckay, Page 209 \\\\- Muir, thy weaknesses were the aberration of Human-nature, but thy heart glowed with everything generous, manly and noble; and if ever emanation from the All-good Being animated a human form it was thine\\".Boyle, Page 87Purdie, Page 215The Burns Encyclopaedia Letters to Robert Muir This correspondence reveals a great deal about the significance of their relationship and gives deep insights into the personality of the poet: A letter of 20 March 1786 had an enclosed a copy of his poem Scotch Drink and promised plans for a convivial meeting: \\"I hope, sometimes before we hear the Gowk (Scots for a cuckoo), to have the pleasure of seeing you, at Kilmarnock, when, I intend we shall have a gill between us, in a Mutchkin-stoup, which will be a great comfort and consolation.\\"Mackay, Page 231 On 18 November 1786 Burns wrote a short note to Robert Muir and enclosed a copy of Tam Samson's elegy.Mackay, Page 244 On 15 December 1786 Burns wrote from Edinburgh saying: \\"I am still undetermined as to the future; and, as usual, never think of it. I have now neither house nor home that I can all my own, and live on the world at large. I am just a poor wayfaring Pilgrom on the road to Parnassus; thoughtless wanderer and sojourner in a strange land.\\"Mackay, Page 260 On 20 December 1786 Burns wrote to Robert who had tried to subscribe to sixty copies of the Edinburgh Edition but Burns, knowing his straightened circumstances, refused him, reducing it to forty, writing that \\"Your affair of sixty copies is also like you: but it would not be like me to comply.\\"Mackay, Page 262 In 1787 Burns wrote from Stirling expressing his high emotions at visiting the tomb of Sir John Graham of Sir William Wallace fame at Falkirk.Hogg, Page 159 as well as the site of the Battle of Bannockburn with its borestone where the Royal Standard was raised by Robert the Bruce.Hogg, Page 159Mackay, Page 335 On 7 March 1788 Robert Burns wrote to Robert Muir clearly expressing in detail his religious beliefs, also hoping that: \\"the Spring will renew your shattered frame and make your friends happy\\".McIntyre, Page 208 \\"If we lie down in the grave, the whole nun a piece of broke machinery, to moulder with the clods of the valley ‚Äî be it so; at least there is an end of pain, care, woes and wants: if that part of us called Mind, does survive the apparent destruction of the man - away with old-wife prejudices and tales! Every age and every nation has had a different set of stories; and as the many are always weak, of consequence they have often, perhaps always been deceived: a man, conscious of having acted an honest part among his fellow creatures; even granting that he may have been the sport, at times of passions and instincts; he goes to a great unknown Being who could have no other end in giving him existence but to make him happy; who gave him those passions and instincts, and well knows their force.\\"Purdie, Page 215The Burns Encyclopaedia Micro-history Robert was a Kilmarnock kirk elder.Blair, Page 100 Burns wrote that Gilbert kerr of Stodrig Farm near Kelso reminded him of Robert Muir.Hogg, Page 150 See also *John Goldie (philosopher) References Notes Sources and bibliography # Blair, Anna (1983).

It is located at 656 State Street in Bangor, and was previously known as the Eastern Maine Insane Asylum and the Bangor Mental Health Institute. It was established in 1895, and the main building on its campus is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Services and coverage area The Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center provides inpatient and outpatient care to the state's severest mentally ill in an area covering the eastern two-thirds of the state. It has 51 beds, and provides its services to both voluntary and involuntary (court-committed) patients. Its operations are governed by state legislation, and are overseen by the state's Department of Health and Human Services. History Maine's first psychiatric hospital was the Maine Insane Hospital, established in Augusta in 1835. That facility was repeatedly enlarged, until 1889, when it was determined to no longer be feasible to expand it further. The state appointed a committee to identify a location for a second facility, resulting in the selection of this location. The centerpiece of the campus is a sprawling, connected multi-building complex, at whose center is the hospital's first building, designed by the noted Portland architect John Calvin Stevens and completed in 1897. The wings, which were designed by Bangor architect George Coombs, were added in 1899‚Äì1901, when the facility formally opened its doors. The hospital continued to grow over the course of the 20th century, generally according to the principles of the Kirkbride Plan for the design and organization of mental hospitals. The main building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987; it is one of the state's largest public buildings. . When founded, it was known as the Eastern Maine Insane Hospital. Its name was changed in 1913 to Bangor State Hospital, and then to Bangor Mental Health Institute. In 2005 it was renamed the Dorothea Dix Psychiatric Center, in honor of Dorothea Dix, a pioneering 19th-century advocate for the improved treatment of the mentally ill. Campus The center's campus is located on Bangor's east side, between State Street (United States Route 2) and Mount Hope Avenue, with Saxl Park on its west side. In addition to the sprawling main building, the campus includes the Tubercular Center, Hedin Hall, the Pre- Release center, a maintenance building, and Pooler Pavilion.

Life De Vriendt was born at Zandenburg Castle, Veere, on 31 January 1559, to Jacques Jacobs de Vriendt and Maria de Lattre. The family was from Ghent and returned there soon after his birth. He graduated Bachelor of Arts from Leuven University on 6 March 1578, and then spent some time studying law at the University of Paris.G. Merlevede, \\"Vriendt (Vrientius), Maximiliaan de\\", Nationaal Biografisch Woordenboek, vol. 6 (Brussels, 1974), 995-1001. After touring Italy he returned to Ghent in 1579, but was banished from the city on 8 December 1583 for his opposition to the Calvinist regime that had come to power. He returned to Ghent in 1584, and on 14 or 15 May was apprehended and tortured. He was not released until 3 September 1584, when the city surrendered to the commander in chief of the Army of Flanders, the Prince of Parma. On 15 November 1584 he was appointed secretary to the city, and on 12 January 1585 captain of a company of the watch. His first wife, Josyne de Harduyn, died 4 March 1585, and their newborn child shortly afterwards. Late in 1585 he remarried, to Josyne Vyts, a widow. As secretary of the city his duties included writing speeches, poems, inscriptions and chronograms for special occasions such as the Joyous Entry into the city of a new ruler or governor. In July and August 1602 he attended the Siege of Ostend, reporting on events to the city council. On 19 April 1605 his daughter, Josyne, married Jean de Forneau, lord of Cruyckenburch. De Vriendt died in Ghent on 27 December 1614 and four days later was buried in the Dominican church. Works *\\"Descriptio Pompae et Gratulationis publicae, ... a senatu populoq.

Now owned by the Freeport Historical Society, this farm was in active use from at least 1831 until 1960. More than of its original have been preserved, as has the c. 1800 saltbox farmhouse. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and is part of the 1974 Harraseeket Historic District. The farm is located at the southern end of Pettengill Road in Freeport's Mast Landing area. (The name is erroneously spelled Pettengil on the street sign and, subsequently, on some maps.) The house faces south, looking down the Harraseeket River. The property's trails are open to the public daily from dawn to dusk. Location The Pettengill Farm occupies a significant portion of land at the head of the Harraseeket River, a tidal inlet that extends southwest to Casco Bay. The farm property is bounded on the south and west by the river, the north by Flying Point Road, and the east by Kelsey Brook, which empties into the river near the point where it opens into the wide channel. The farmstead is located on a terrace overlooking a bend in the narrow portion of the river, near the southern end of the property, and is about a walk down the access road from the public trailhead. The property, which is now no longer in agricultural use, has a combination of open fields and woods, with public trails now crossing them. The house and farm make up an unusually well-preserved 19th-century saltwater farm. The house, which dates to the late 18th or early 19th century, was once part of a larger group of agricultural outbuildings, none of which have survived. The farm was in active use until 1960, and the last of the Pettengills that lived on the farm died in 1981. Architectural style of farmhouse The farmhouse is a traditional New England saltbox house. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with an integral leanto section sloping down to the rear. It has a central chimney, its exterior is finished in wooden clapboards, and it rests on a stone foundation. The main facade faces south toward the river, and is four bays wide, with a single sash window to the left of the entrance, and two to the right. The windows of the second story match that of the first plus an additional one in line with door below. The door has a four-light transom above it. The northern (rear) facade has three windows a little off-center to the right. The western side has one window on the first floor, to the right of a side door. There are two windows on the second floor and one in the attic space. A bulkhead is located on the eastern side of the house. There are five windows on this side (with one where the door is on the opposite side). The house has never been modernized, and lacks plumbing, heating (beyond the central chimney), and electricity. History Lufkin brothers Aaron and Joseph began buying property on the land in the 1790s.\\"Destructive beetles discovered in historic Freeport farmhouse\\" - Portland Press Herald, November 23, 2015 In 1801, around a year after the house was constructed, Joseph sold his interest to his brother. In 1811, Aaron fell into financial difficulty and mortgaged the house to Daniel and Enoch Brewer of Freeport, and the land to David Curtis of Brunswick. Aaron died a year later and the property was sold, at auction, to Curtis, who kept the farm intact. The house was likely uninhabited from 1812 until 1831, at which point Curtis sold the property to Captain James Rodick, who made some improvements to the house. When Rodick died, in 1848, he left the property to his seven children, each of whom received a small lot and a large lot. Rodick's wife, Patience (b. 1782, d. 1838), died ten years before him. His son, Daniel, inherited the lot that included the house, and in 1861 he sold the house and 35 acres to Daniel Randall who was the owner until his 1866 death. In 1858, Charles Henry Pettengill, a farmer, former sea captain and store owner who lived at nearby Porters Landing, began purchasing parcels of the land. In 1877, he bought the house from Randall's widow, Rebecca, and eventually merged all of the acreage into one lot of about 120 acres. The Pettengills' dairy cattle grazed on the marsh grasses until milk distributors deemed that their end product was too salty for consumption. Pettengill's son, Wallace,Wallace Martin Pettengill and sleigh, Freeport, ca. 1920 - Maine Memory Network and daughter-in-law, Adelaide, lived on the property, where they raised three children ‚Äî Ethel, Frank and Mildred.Mildred, Ethel and Frank Pettengill, Freeport, ca. 1890 - Maine Memory Network Ethel died at age 16 or 17.A photo of Pettengill family members and friends in front of the house in the 1920s - Freeport Historical Society's Instagram post, September 12, 2019 After Wallace's death in 1925, the two remaining children, Frank and Mildred, carried on the farm, along with their dog, Trixie.Trixie, Pettengill farm dog, ca. 1920 - Maine Memory Network In 1959, they sold the farm, with a lease-back agreement, to Eleanor Houston Smith who, with her husband, Lawrence, founded Wolfe‚Äôs Neck Farm. The Smiths were preservationists and, fascinated by the Pettengills' lifestyle, provided life tenancy for them. The Smiths also bought back more of the original acreage that had been part of the farm. Mildred, the last family member, lived in the house part-time until 1965,Freeport Historical Society - Instagram, September 12, 2019 five years after the death of her brother. She died sixteen years later, in 1981, at the age of 98. In 1975, Eleanor Smith conveyed the house and some of the land to the Freeport Historical Society, and on her death in 1987, aged 77,\\"ELEANOR HOUSTON SMITH\\" - New York Times archive from September 7 1987 she left the remaining land and the contents of the house to the society. Freeport Historical Society has conducted eight archaeological surveys at the farm. Results from these surveys indicated that there may have been an earlier, smaller structure on the site of the current house, about one-third of its size. The earlier house may have burned down, as evidenced by charcoal being found in the soil. Clay pipe stems and other artefacts suggested that the original house was built during the late 1600s or, more likely, the 1700s. A hurricane in 1954 destroyed an adjacent 19th-century barn measuring approximately 40 x 34 feet.Pettengill farm, Freeport, ca. 1920 - Maine Memory Network In 2015, destructive beetles were discovered in the walls of the house.

The post and the funding for it come from a bequest by William Heather (c. 1563 ‚Äì 1627). Following the example of his friend William Camden who had left property to fund the establishment of a chair of history at Oxford in 1622, Heather founded a music lecture at Oxford and proposed to present the university \\"with some instruments and music books to promote a weekly music practice\\". He included specific instructions for music practice on Thursday afternoons during term times (except during Lent) and that there should be a Master of the Musicke. This master was to look after the musical instruments and the music books and to undertake rehearsals and provide both a theoretical and practical training in music.Wollenberg, Susan (1981-1982) Music in 18th-Century Oxford, Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association Vol. 108, pp. 69-99Deutsch, David (2015) British Literature and Classical Music: Cultural Contexts 1870-1945, Bloomsbury PublishingFauvel, John, Raymond Flood and Robin J.

He edited many manuscripts and was the President of the Higher Institute for Eastern, East European and African language and history. He was also a member of the Royal Academy for Language and Literature. His linguistic activities also saw him involved in Dutch orthography, as a co-author of the Word list of the Dutch language, a list of words of the Dutch language that was published in 1954. He was for many years the secretary of the commission that was set up by the respective ministers of education of the Netherlands and of Belgium in 1947; it was entrusted with standardising Dutch spelling. In the early postwar period, he became interested in Flemish nationalism and played a role in the Algemeen Nederlands Verbond. Later, he was active in the Vlaams Comit√© voor Federalisme and succeeded Corneel Heymans as its president. Together with Walloon federalists, he worked out a federal constitution for Belgium in 1954 and so he became involved in politics in that year by negotiating the election cartel Christian Flemish People's Union.

Bradford Hook and Ladder Fire House is a historic fire station at 212 Stafford Street in Bennington, Vermont. Built in 1893-94, it served for over a century as a fire house for the city, and survived modernizations with much of its historic fabric intact. It has been converted into artist studios and living space. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The Bradford Hook and Ladder Fire House is located just northeast of downtown Bennington, at the southwest corner of Safford and Gage Streets. The area is mainly residential, with a public park across the street and a manufacturing plant one block to the west. The station is built of brick, and is two stories in height. It has two equipment bays on the ground floor, one of which has an overhead door, and the other has been enclosed by a three-bay wall, with pedestrian entrances in the right two bays, and fixed windows above paneling in the leftmost bay. All three of these bays have two-level transom windows above. On the second floor above each equipment bay are three round-arch windows, with smaller windows flanking a larger one. The interior has retained a number of original finishes, including a wooden ceiling on the second floor. The station was built in 1893-94, and originally housed the W.H. Bradford Hook Company on one side, and the F.M. Tiffany Hose Company on the other. The equipment it housed was drawn by horses, and the facility include a tower for drying hoses, which were subject to rot. The tower was demolished in 1912, replaced by a shed which was itself removed sometime after 1921. Also in the 1920s, the left-hand bay was converted to house the office of the fire chief. The station remained in active service until 1997. It has since been converted into studio and living space.

As a two-year-old in 1981 he was one of the best colts of his generation in Europe, winning two of his five races including a victory over a strong field in the Group One William Hill Futurity. He won the Blue Riband Trial Stakes on his three-year-old debut, but his form deteriorated thereafter. He raced in North America in 1883 and 1984 but had very little success, winning one minor race from twenty-four attempts. He later stood as a breeding stallion in France but had no success as a sire of winners. Background Count Pahlen was a grey horse bred in the United Kingdom by Tony Villar. He was sired by Hotfoot who won the Coronation Stakes and finished second in both the Irish 2000 Guineas and the Prince of Wales's Stakes. The best of his other progeny included Hot Grove (runner-up in The Derby) and Tachypous (Middle Park Stakes). Count Pahlen's dam Tanara showed some ability as a racehorse, winning four minor races over middle distances. She was descended from the Irish Oaks winner Snow Maiden, the female-line ancestor of several major winners including King of Kings. Count Pahlen raced in the colours of Villar's wife and was sent into training with Bruce Hobbs at the Palace House stable in Newmarket. Hobbs had previously trained both Hotfoot and Tanara, as well as Tanara's sire Romulus. The colt was named after the Russian courtier Peter Ludwig von der Pahlen. Racing career 1981: two-year-old season Count Pahlen began his racing career in a seven furlong race at Great Yarmouth Racecourse in July. Looking less than fully fit he had considerable difficulty obtaining a clear run before finishing third behind Vin St Benet. When moved up in class for the Acomb Stakes at York Racecourse in August he was badly hampered in the last quarter mile and finished third to the filly Height of Fashion and the colt Ashenden, beaten two and three quarter lengths by the winner. At Newbury Racecourse in October he was one of twenty-two juveniles to contest the Haynes, Hanson and Clark Stakes over one mile. The large field split into two groups and although Count Pahlen proved the best of those racing up the far side of the course (the left hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint) he finished only fifth behind Super Sunrise and three others who raced on the stands side. The colt recorded his first success in a division of the Westley Stakes, a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in October, winning by half a length from Noble Gift in a twenty-two runner field. In late October Count Pahlen, ridden by Geoff Baxter, started a 25/1 outsider in a thirteen-runner field for the Group One William Hill Futurity over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. The favourite was the Henry Cecil-trained Paradis Terrestre, a seven-length winner of his only previous start while the other runners included Norwick (Royal Lodge Stakes), End of the Line (July Stakes), Assert, Jalmood (unbeaten in three starts), Super Sunrise and Ashenden. After tracking the leaders, Count Pahlen went to the front three furlongs out, got the better of a sustained struggle and held off the late challenges of Paradis Terrestre and Jalmood to win by half a length and a head. The colt's victory gave Baxter a first Group One win. 1982: three-year-old season On his first appearance as a three-year-old Count Pahlen contested the Group Three Blue Riband Trial Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Epsom Downs Racecourse in May and recorded his third consecutive victory, beating Steel Bay (to whom he was conceding ten pounds) by a neck. In May he ran in the Dante Stakes (a major trial race for The Derby) over ten and a half furlongs at York Racecourse and finished fourth behind Simply Great, Palace Gold and Be My Native. In the 203rd running of the Epsom Derby on 2 June he started a 33/1 outsider. He was briefly in contention entering the straight but faded in the closing stages and finished ninth of the eighteen runners behind Golden Fleece. Count Pahlen was unplaced in his two remaining races in Europe, ending his season by finishing seventh behind Time Charter in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket in October. 1983 & 1984: later career Count Pahlen was bought by Dogwood Stable and was sent to race in North America where he was trained by William Curtis, Jr. He made no impact in 1983, finishing second once and third once in eleven attempts in allowance races. He won an allowance at Fair Grounds Race Course on his first appearance of 1984, but finished no better than third in twelve subsequent races. Assessment In the official International Classification for 1981, Count Pahlen was rated the third-best two-year-old in Europe behind Green Forest and Wind and Wuthering. The independent Timeform organisation gave the colt a rating of 127, five pounds inferior to their best two-year-old Wind and Wuthering. In their annual Racehorses of 1981 Timeform described Count Pahlen as \\"a strong, good sort of colt who carries plenty of condition\\" and likely to become a serious contender for the Epsom Derby. He was rated 115 by Timeform in 1982. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Count Pahlen returned to Europe and stood as a breeding stallion in France. His last reported foals were born in 1988.

It occurs at elevations of 1000 ‚Äì 1500 m in moist to wet forests, and even in swampy grassland, across Sub-Saharan Africa; it is recorded from Guinea, Nigeria, Cameroon, the Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Swaziland, and Angola. In Kenya its roots are heavily collected, and this often kills the plant. Some initiatives propagate the species to supply the commercial demand and attempt to re-establish the species in the wild. With older stems becoming woody, it grows from a tuberous rootstock which has a ginger or liquorice taste and an aroma reminiscent of vanilla. The opposite leaves are large (100‚Äì300 x 50‚Äì150 mm) with a cordate base and 30‚Äì55 mm long petioles which, with the lower-surface veins, are often reddish-purple. The false stipules are large and fimbriaceous. The inflorescence is axillary and branched, flowers are short-lived, lasting 3‚Äì4 days. Petals are reddish- purple, ¬± 14 mm long and with a green edge. The flowers are unusually large for the subfamily Periplocoideae, and have a malodorous fruity scent which grows as the day progresses. The paired large fruits or follicles (75‚Äì100 x 44 mm) are semi-woody with a velvety surface. Mondia is from the Zulu word for the plant, 'umondi'. The species epithet commemorates A.S. White, a South African farmer, who sent specimens to Kew to John Croumbie Brown, Colonial Botanist at the Cape, who sent them on to Joseph Dalton Hooker, who described the species.

Its name derived from US General Henry H. Arnold, Chief of the United States Army Air Forces, the instigator of the scheme, which ran from June 1941 to March 1943. Background In the early years of the Second World War there was an acute need to train pilots for the Royal Air Force. The United Kingdom was considered largely unsuitable due to a combination of enemy action, high operational traffic at airfields, unpredictable weather and a shortage of training instructors. Several overseas training schemes were therefore established, including the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the British Flying Training Schools and the Arnold Scheme. The scheme was one product of the climate of greater co- operation between the United Kingdom and the then neutral United States following the introduction of Lend-Lease in March 1941. Introduction and operation In April 1941 General 'Hap' Arnold flew to London and met with RAF officers at the Air Ministry, offering to train four thousand British pilots alongside American aviation cadets. The British Air Council accepted the generous offer and planning began immediately. On 10 May 1941, in a telegram to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill referred to the \\"splendid offer which General Arnold made to us of one-third of the rapidly expanding capacity for pilot training in the United States to be filled with pupils from here\\", stating that \\"the first five hundred and fifty of our young men are now ready to leave\\". Unlike the British Flying Training Schools, training was to be carried out by the United States Army Air Corps and based at both military bases and contract civilian flying schools in the Southeast Air Corps Training Center area, one of three large geographical training centres established in the USA. Training was divided into separate primary, basic and advanced courses, held at various flying schools and bases, and each training centre headquarters was assigned one rated RAF administrative officer. Each school had a subordinate non-rated RAF administrative officer to handle discipline and pay. Prior to the USA's entry into the War following the Attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, RAF cadets were required to wear civilian clothes. Primary flying courses were run by experienced civilian American instructors and took place over 9 to 10 weeks at civilian contract schools at Woodward Field in South Carolina, Albany and Americus in Georgia, Carlstrom Field, Arcadia and Lakeland in Florida, and Tuscaloosa in Alabama. Basic flying training, under the instruction of USAAC and RAF flight instructors, lasted nine to ten weeks at either Cochran Field at Macon, Georgia or Gunter Field, Montgomery, Alabama. Advanced flying training schools conducted single-engine courses, held at Craig Field or Napier Field in Alabama, and multi-engine courses, originally at Maxwell Field and Napier Field, Alabama and Turner Field, Georgia, but later at Turner Field and Moody Field, Georgia. Between June 1941 and March 1943 a total of 7,885 RAF personnel entered the scheme. Of these, 3,392 were eliminated or 'washed out' and 81 were killed in training. Of the cadets who successfully completed training, 577 were retained for approximately one year as instructors, the remainder returning to the UK. Most successful students became sergeant pilots, but 1,070 were commissioned. Pilot officer Cyril Joe Barton, a graduate of the scheme, was later awarded the Victoria Cross. Sir Michael Beetham, who also trained under the scheme, later became a Marshal of the Royal Air Force.

She escaped to freedom from her slave master, James Noble, by shipping herself in an old sailor's chest from Baltimore to Philadelphia.  Biography   Early years  Lear Green was owned by the James Noble, a butter merchant, since she was a young child. When she was eighteen, she met a man by the name of William Adams, who asked for her hand in marriage. Adams was a free black man who worked as a barber. Lear declined the proposals at first because she refused to have children who would be born into slavery and risk Noble selling her children off. After repeated proposals, Lear accepted the proposal with the condition that she would marry Adams as a free person.  Escape  In 1850, Lear was advertised in The Sun, a Baltimore newspaper as a \\"NEGRO GIRL... about 18 years of age [with] black complexion, round featured, good looking and of ordinary size [wearing] a silk bonnet, a dark plaid silk dress, a light mouselin de laine, also, one watered silk cape and one tan colored cape.\\" Noble also knew of Lear Green and William Adam's relationship and Adam's plan to marry Lear. With confidence that the two ran away together, Noble also included a description about Adams, recounting him as \\"black, quiet spoken, 5 by 10 inches high, a scar on one side of his face running down into a ridge by the corner of his mouth about four inches long.\\" Noble offered $150 if Lear was \\"taken out of the State of Maryland and delivered to [him]; or fifty dollars if taken in the State of Maryland.\\" With the help of his mother, William Adams came up with a plan to smuggle Lear's freedom. Mrs. Adams, William's mother who was a free black woman, traveled to Baltimore to visit her son. After, she prepared for the trip home to New York aboard the Erricson line of steamers. With her was an old sailor's chest fastened by strong ropes containing a quilt, pillow, articles of raiment, a small amount of food, a bottle of water, and Lear Green. Despite her freedom Mrs. Adams was assigned to the deck. Fortunately for Lear, these prescribed rules existed, for Mrs. Adams was closer to the chest. About once or twice through the night during silent watches of the night, Mrs. Adams would untie the chest ropes around the claustrophobic chest, raise the lid, and give Lear a breath of fresh air while also checking on her welfare. Eighteen hours later, they arrived in Philadelphia. Without anyone questioning the contents of the chest, it was then placed on a jolting carriage ride with Lear still confined and to the American Anti-Slavery Society Office. Upon arriving, William Still, chairman of the Vigilance Committee, untied the chest and Lear emerged from it alive. Lear remained at the Still residence until traveling to her final destination in south central New York where her fianc√© was waiting.  Freedom Eventually, Lear, now a fugitive in a free state, was forwarded to Elmira, New York where William Adams awaited her arrival. Rather than traveling to St. Catherine's, Ontario in Canada, the last stop of the underground railroad, the two decided to remain in Elmira. They were then married and enjoyed three years of freedom before Lear died of unknown causes at the age of twenty-one.

Over this period nearly 34,000 East German political prisoners were \\"freigekauft\\" (ransomed). West Germany paid East Germany, generally in cash or goods, an average of approximately 40,000 Deutsche Marks per person. Political prisoners whose freedom had been purchased could choose to be expelled directly from their place of detention to West Germany, and frequently were given no notice or opportunity to communicate with their families, nor to say goodbye to fellow prisoners, before being transferred to the West. The practice ended in October 1989 when remaining political prisoners began to be released in the context of the Peaceful Revolution and the rapid succession of changes that led, formally in October 1990, to German reunification. Between 1964 and October 1989, it is believed that 33,755 political prisoners had their freedom purchased for a nominal total price of 3.5 billion Deutsche Marks in terms of the equivent currency's modern purchasing power. In addition to the release of political prisoners, approximately 250,000 exit visas were purchased by West Germany on behalf of East Germans who wished to emigrate. The cash payments helped support the economy of East Germany, which was in a state of permanent financial crisis from the 1970s till German reunification. The Evangelical Church's Stuttgart based German Evangelical Alliance played a facilitating role in mediating the transactions. Close relations between the East and West German Evangelical church communities were tolerated by East Germany's ruling SED (party). History The first trade in political prisoners took place over Christmas 1962: 20 prisoners and the same number of children were released in return for a delivery of three rail wagons loaded with potash fertilisers. The West German Chancellor at the time was still Konrad Adenauer. Adenauer had faced a crisis within the governing coalition earlier in the month, which had resulted in the appointment on 14 December 1962 of the lawyer-politician Rainer Barzel as the Minister of Intra-German Relations. Annual West German purchases of East German political prisoner releases (1963-1989) The prisoner release transactions were negotiated informally at government level, initially as individual deals, and later according to a more consistently established set of processes. The average price per prisoner was around 40,000 Deutsche Marks per person at the outset, but may have reached 100,000 Deutsche Marks by the time the practice ended in 1989. Officially the payments represented \\"damages\\" for the harm the prisoners were alleged to have done in East Germany and to compensate the East German state for the loss of value from the cost of training invested in the individuals released to the west. This offered a semi-official justification for the payments. In reality, the background was one in which the East German state was chronically short of cash in general, and of convertible currency in particular. The West German Deutsche Mark had become, by the early 1960s, a fully convertible currency. Selling political prisoners to the west addressed another problem for East Germany. The historian Stefan Wolle describes the arrangement as \\"a form of political toxic-waste disposal\\" (\\"eine Art politischer Giftm√ºllentsorgung\\"). The West German government was motivated, more simply, by humanitarian considerations. The actual logistics of the prisoner transfers were implemented discreetly by the East German authorities. For example, two West German Magirus-Deutz buses were provided with \\"rotating number-plates\\". While travelling in East German territory, the buses displayed East German license plates (registration plates) in order to avoid standing out. At the press of a button, on crossing to the west, these were replaced with West German plates. With Cold War tensions providing political context during the 1950s and early 1960s, the East German and West German governments both denied the existence of government contacts between the German states. In reality, the sale of the prisoner releases was negotiated, from the East German side, by a lawyer originally from Silesia called Wolfgang Vogel who evidently enjoyed the full confidence of the party leadership, but was also valued by the leadership in West Germany, described snappily on at least one occasion by Helmut Schmidt as \\"our mail man\\". Vogel's West German negotiating partners were government lawyers such as Walter Priesnitz and Ludwig A. Rehlinger, along with senior politicians, including Herbert Wehner, Helmut Schmidt and Hans-Jochen Vogel. Another politician who became closely involved in front-line government-level negotiations, as the veil of secrecy began to wear thin, was Hermann Kreutzer, a formerly East German political activist who in 1949 had been imprisoned for openly opposing the contentious political merger that had led to the creation of East Germany's ruling SED (party). Kreutzer's 25-year sentence had been cut short in 1956, during the Khrushchev Thaw and following intense political pressure from West Germany, when he had been bundled across the border into West Berlin. Ludwig Gei√üel of the Evangelical Alliance was also involved in purchasing the freedom of political prisoners, along with members and senior officers of the West Berlin City Council. Although the German governments attempted to keep the transactions secret, as more and more former detainees turned up in the west, awareness of the \\"H√§ftlingsfreikauf\\" programme seeped into public consciousness. In 1983 a scandal erupted in West Germany which threatened to undermine the humanitarian motives of West German governments. It was alleged that the long-standing, Minister of Intra-German Relations between 1969 and 1982 Egon Franke and a senior ministerial official, named Edgar Hirt, had presided over the questionable disappearance of 5.6 Million Deutsche Marks into East Germany. Both men were indicted. They stood trial at the end of 1986, during the run-up to a general election, for embezzlement and fraud in connection with the \\"H√§ftlingsfreikauf\\" programme. Franke was acquitted, but the court determined that Hirt had applied some of the \\"black funds\\" involved to non-humanitarian causes without the knowledge of his minister, and Hirt was sentenced to a three and a half year jail term. Criticism As H√§ftlingsfreik√§ufe became known to the public, criticism of it surfaced in the west and, after 1989, across Germany. There were suggestions that it implied acceptance of the detention of political opponents, and that it provided a pressure valve that weakened political opposition to the East German leadership, thereby reducing pressure on the party hierarchy and underwriting Germany's second one-party dictatorship. There was a suspicion that it might give an incentive to the East German authorities to increase the number of political prisoners, seeing them as a source of potential income. For example, in 1979 the standard prison sentence for serious \\"Republikflucht\\" cases (of attempting to escape from the country) was increased from five to eight years. An additional concern, from the western perspective, was that human rights organisations such as Amnesty International, which were better informed than most on the murky world of political prisoners in East Germany, were inhibited from campaigning against East Berlin's human rights abuses for fear of endangering the H√§ftlingsfreik√§ufe programme. Cost Sources are not consistent over the total amount paid by West Germany for the release of East German political prisoners, and the issue is further complicated by changes in the value of money - even of the Deutsche Mark - between 1962 and 1989. Some data may conflate payments made under the H√§ftlingsfreikauf scheme with costs for the purchase of exit visas of approximately 250,000 East German citizens who were not political prisoners but nonetheless made a convincing case for wishing to leave East Germany. Estimates tended to increase over time, with one source, in 1994, suggesting that the total cost to West Germany of the H√§ftlingsfreik√§ufe programme might have been as high as 8 billion Deutsche Marks.

It portrays Maria Maddalena Baroncelli, about whom very little is known. She is about 14 years old, and depicted shortly before her wedding to the Italian banker Tommaso Portinari. Maria is dressed in the height of late fifteenth-century fashion, with a long black hennin with a transparent veil and an elaborate jewel- studded necklace. Her headdress is similar and necklace identical to those in her depiction in Hugo van der Goes's later Portinari Altarpiece (c. 1475), a painting that may have been partly based on Memling's portrait. The panel is the right wing of a devotional and hinged triptych; the lost center panel is recorded in sixteenth-century inventories as a Virgin and Child, and the left panel depicts Tommaso.

Description Speculative reconstruction of the original triptych, with a Virgin and Child at center The half-length portrait shows Maria Portinari (born Maria Maddalena Baroncelli in 1456)Burn (1997), 36 in a three-quarter view turned to the left. She has somewhat Nordic features, and is dressed in the high fashion then found at the apex of Flemish and Italian high society. She is placed against a flat, opaque, dark background, with her hands clasped in prayer. In Memling's early portraits the backgrounds tend to be plain, as was invariably the case in the work of Jan van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden, and favored within Burgundian court circles. In contrast, Memling's later portraits are set within rich interiors or against landscapes framed by columns, such as in his ', a fact that has assisted in dating his work.Panofsky (1953), 348‚Äì49 Maria's face is idealised and conforms to contemporary ideals of beauty, especially in the raised eyebrows and elongated nose.Campbell (1990), 18 The art historian Lorne Campbell has noted her facial similarity to the Virgin in Memling's panel at the National Museum of Ancient Art, Lisbon.Campbell (1990), 18 In this work, Maria's frame is slightly undersized compared to her head, a common characteristic of contemporary northern portraiture, also found in similar works by Rogier van der Weyden and Petrus Christus.See van der Weyden's c. 1460 Portrait of a Lady and Christus' c. 1465‚Äì70 Portrait of a Young Girl Her elbows rest on an unseen parapet that coincides with the lower edge of the painted stone frame, acting as a trompe-l'≈ìil which situates her both in the same reality and in closer proximity to the viewer.De Vos (1994), 30‚Äì32 Maria wears a relatively modest wedding band lined with rubies and sapphire. Her necklace is colored with mostly red and blue jewels, similar to Hugo van der Goes's portrait of her in the Portinari Altarpiece.Franke (2007), 135‚Äì36 Double Portrait of Charles the Bold and Isabella of Bourbon. Unknown artist, 16th c. Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent The black hennin is long, truncated and relatively plainMcConnell (1991), 19 with a transparent veil which falls around the back of her neck, resting briefly on her shoulder. Probably it was kept relatively unadorned so as not to distract from the necklace. Her costume is mostly black or brown, with a wide but high neckline and white fur lined hems on the sleeves. Portinari has dark eyes, a strong nose, full lips and a pointed chin.Nash (2008), 126 Her visible hand, folded in prayer but unrealistically off center, wears what looks like a jeweled ring. The dark sleeves of her dress contain red or rouge velvet-like cloth tightened by a white belt. Her hair is shaved back to achieve the high forehead and sculptural look fashionable at the time.Gr√∂ssinger (1997), 60 Maria's necklace is gilded and studded with pearls, rubies and sapphires. It contains three open flowers; one white with a ruby jewel, another red with a sapphire, and one gray-blue with a pearl. The upper line contains a row of onyx beads, from which hang, according to the art historian Sophie McConnell \\"small teardrops\\" gold and bluish-grey enameled wire. The necklace is very similar to that worn by Margaret of York at her wedding to Charles the Bold in 1468, an occasion the Portinaris attended.Ainsworth (2009), 141Ainsworth, Maryan. \\"Tommaso di Folco Portinari (1428‚Äì1501); Maria Portinari (Maria Maddalena Baroncelli, born 1456)\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2011. Retrieved 7 February 2016 A depiction of Charles in a double Portrait with Isabella of Bourbon, now in Ghent, closely resembles that of Thomas in facial features, while Isabella and Maria look very similar.Franke (2007), 136 Dirk de Vos believes van der Goes may have seen Memling's panel when he stayed with Tommaso in Bruges c. 1497, and incorporated elements for his own depiction.De Vos (1994), 30‚Äì32 The panel is in very good condition and among the best preserved of Memling's work. Technical examination using x-radiography shows that the hennin originally contained pearls which formed the letters \\"T\\" and \\"M\\", standing for Tommaso and Maria. Similar pearl monograms, which would have been intended as a sign of marital connection, can be found in van der Goes's portraits of the couple.Franke (2007), 135 Maryan Ainsworth concludes that they were removed from the final composition as they may have been \\"deemed too conspicuous a show of opulence in the presence of the Virgin and Child, most likely the now lost object of Maria's veneration.\\"Ainsworth (1994), 85‚Äì86 Maria's ear was at one stage exposed, but was later covered by the wide frontlet of the hennin, a change of mind also found in the very similar portrait of the female donor in Memling's c. 1470s to early 1480 Donne Triptych.Campbell (1998), 286 Provenance Detail of Hugo's portrait of Tommaso, c. 1470 The panel has at various times been attributed to van der Goes and van Eyck, but was recognized as by Memling as early as the time of the seminal 1902 exhibition Exposition des primitifs flamands √† Bruges in Bruges, when it was lent by L√©opold Goldschmidt of Paris. In 1916 Max J. Friedl√§nder described it as \\"without doubt\\" by Memling, and c. 1475.Friedl√§nder (1916), 194‚Äì95 The art historian Catheline P√©rier-d'Ieteren, while noting that Memling's portrait faces were rarely underdrawn, wrote that this panel contains \\"thin yet confident incised lines\\" which may be preliminary drawings for Maria's face, perhaps made from life.P√©rier-d'Ieteren (2006), 210 Exposition des primitifs flamands √† Bruges The triptych was recorded in an inventory of Tommaso's holdings upon his death. The New York panels passed through Tommaso's son Francesco. The central panel was described in his 1544 will as \\"a small tabernacle with three movable wings, in which is depicted the glorious Virgin Mary and the father and mother of the donor\\" (unum tabernaculettum que clauditur con tribus sportellis, in qua est depicta imago Gloriossime virginis Marie et patris et matris dicti testatoris). Francesco bequeathed the triptych to the convent of the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova in Florence. Records indicate a small intact winged altarpiece which stayed in the hospital's possession until around the time of the Napoleonic occupation, when it was probably broken up. Maria's panel was sold as a Dieric Bouts for 6,000 francs in 1870. It later passed through several private collections before arriving in the possession of of Rome, who briefly returned it to Florence. Thereafter the panels were in London from 1901, from where they were sold to Villeroy Goldschmidt of Paris by for $426,500 in 1910. They were purchased, also in 1910, by the collector Benjamin Altman of New York on the advice of Max Friedl√§nder, along with works by Albrecht D√ºrer, Gerard David and Hans Holbein the Younger ‚Äì paintings whose \\"grave austerity seems to have been most in tune with his own taste\\".Haskell (1970), 275 Altman bequeathed his holdings to the Metropolitan on his death in 1913.Burn (1997), 37Haskell (1970), 260 Notes Sources * Ainsworth, Maryan.

Personal life  Pangeran Hidayatullah was born in 1822 in Martapura. His father was Sultan Muda Abdurrahman son of Sultan Adam Al-Watsiq Billah, and his mother was Ratu Siti binti Pangeran Mangku Bumi Nata bin Sultan Sulaiman. In 1852 the Sultan's heir-apparent died, and the Dutch replaced him by the illegitimate grandson Tamjied Illah. In vain, Sultan Adam and many nobles in 1853 sent an embassy to Batavia, pointing out iniquities perpetrated by the Dutch-designated heir and appealing for the Dutch to recognise instead Hidayatullah - a younger but legitimate son. Sultan Adam died in 1857 and was succeeded by Tamjied Illah. There ensued a struggle for power between Tamjied Illah and Hidayatullah, which divided the population, much of which stood behind Hidayatullah and highly resented the Dutch sponsoring of Tamjied Illah. In early 1859, a revolt against Tamjied's rule broke out and the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army intervened on his behalf, but in June 1859 Tamjied stepped down. Unable to find a suitable successor, the Dutch colonial government decided to annex the Sultanate of Banjar in June 1860. In early 1862, Hidayat surrendered to Dutch commander Verspijck in exchange for permission to settle on the island of Java. The last rebels surrendered in 1863. Hidayat died in Cianjur, Jawa Barat, 24 November 1904.

The company owed more than in debt and in taxes, while its credit card processor has withheld payments to the company. While under Chapter 11 bankruptcy, it plans to continue to fulfill orders but seeks potential buyers.

Crates Loot Crate's themes change monthly and can be anything from 'Invasion' to 'Anti-Hero' to 'Future'. Loot Crate teams up with companies such as DC, Marvel, and Nintendo to create a large array of merchandise in every crate. One-off crates with particular themes have been released, such as for Fallout 4 and Mass Effect. Loot Crate also operates a Loot Anime box with anime-related items. In January 2016 Loot Crate announced a Loot Gaming subscription option with boxes containing video game-related content.

Education Hargarten received his MD from the Medical College of Wisconsin and his MPH from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 1984. He completed an internship at the Gorgas Hospital in Panama. Career Hargarten joined the faculty of the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1989. In January 2010, he was named associate dean of the Office of Global Health at the Medical College of Wisconsin. In 2014, he became the director of the Center for International Health, which the Medical College of Wisconsin describes as \\"a collaborative of several institutions, including the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Marquette University\\". He has treated hundreds of gunshot victims during his medical career. Research Hargarten has been called \\"one of the nation's leading gun violence experts\\". In 2007, he and Bella Dinh-Zarr presented a study in Washington, D.C. as part of the Global Traffic Safety Week analyzing data on non-disease deaths of Americans overseas from 2004 to 2006. Gun violence activism Hargarten campaigned against a bullet, proposed by the Black Talon brand in the 1990s, that unfolded into a petal-like pattern after entering a victim, arguing that it could promote the spread of infections when surgeons tried to remove it from a wound. Also in the 1990s, he proposed three changes to reduce handgun deaths, which, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, were: \\"urging the use of trigger locks; an indicator to show that a gun is loaded; and a lock mechanism that allows only the owner to have use of the gun\\". His efforts opposing the bullet included writing an editorial on the subject in the Journal of Trauma and encouraging other physicians to campaign against it as well. He has said that armed civilians trying to stop mass shootings are more likely to exacerbate the situation than mitigate it, because they are less likely to hit their targets than police. Honors and awards Hargarten was elected to both the National Academy of Medicine (then known as the Institute of Medicine) and the Johns Hopkins Society of Scholars in 2011.

Height  The 380.6 m-high Calmont summit lies 293.1 metres above the Moselle, on which the lowest contour line on topographic maps is 87.5 m. It is also an average of about 270 metres above Bremm. Around 215 metres east-northeast of the summit is a spot height of 378.4 m.  Conservation  The Calmont lie within the protected area of Moselle Region from Schweich to Koblenz (Moselgebiet von Schweich bis Koblenz, CDDA No. 323051; established in 1979; 1187.48 km¬≤), in the Special Area of Conservation of Hillsides and Side Valleys of the Lower Moselle (Moselh√§nge und Nebent√§ler der unteren Mosel, FFH No. 5809-301; 162.73 km¬≤) and in the bird reserve of Woods between Wittlich and Cochem (W√§lder zwischen Wittlich und Cochem, VSG No. 5908-401; 235.52 km¬≤). Neither the SAC nor the bird reserve quite reach the banks of the Moselle river.  Gallo-Roman Ambulatory Temple  On the summit of the Calmont there was a Roman hill shrine from the 2nd to around the 4th century AD. In 2005 the first archaeological excavations took place; they continued in 2008. In connexion with the excavations this Gallo-Roman ambulatory temple was reconstructed and opened on 16 May 2009  Viniculture  In the late 20th century only part of the original vineyards were still being cultivated. The largest contiguous area is the Bremmer Calmont with 33 ha. On its steep slate hillsides grows a particularly good Riesling, however the vintners still have to use manual labour and muscle power (‚Üí steep vineyards). After winegrowing had declined for decades on the Calmont massif for economic reasons, since 2005 several vintners have been ready to restock their vineyards. They hope that the greater profile of the location will enable them to market their products better. A wine estate has meanwhile offered to rent vine stocks.  Monument and viewing plateau  665 metres (as the crown flies) west-southwest of the summit of the Calmont, near a spot height 372.5 m, is the Monument to the Wartime Generation (Mahnmal der Kriegsgeneration), a 12-metre-high summit cross that was erected around 1970 and is visible from a long way off. Next to the hut there, which is opened from Easter to October as a Strau√üwirtschaft, is an \\"observation plateau\\" from where there are good views, especially of the great loop in the Moselle, 285 m below, along with the nearby ruins of Stuben Abbey with, downstream, the villages of Neef, Bremm and Ediger-Eller.  Transport and Hiking  Along the southern foot of the Calmont, running from west to east between the Moselle villages of Bremm and Ediger-Eller is the B 49 federal highway. East to southeast of the ridge is the 4,205-metre-long Kaiser Wilhelm Tunnel which runs from north-northeast to south-southwest and carries the Moselle railway from Cochem to the station of Ediger-Eller and then over a 281-metre-long bridge over the Moselle. On the Calmont runs the Calmont Klettersteig, which was laid out by the German Alpine Club and opened on 4 May 2002 and on which can discover more about the hills and their flora and fauna.  Paragliding  Near the Monument to the Wartime Generation is a launch area for paragliders who can fly over the Moselle valley in suitable wind conditions. The Calmont massif is like a huge concave mirror in the Moselle valley and, with its southerly orientation and slate bedrock, offers ideal conditions for the creation of thermal upcurrents.

When water freezes, the volume of water increases by 9 %. When the volumetric moisture content exceeds 91 %, then the volume increase of water in the pores of the material caused by freezing cannot be absorbed by sufficient empty pores. This causes an increase in the internal pressure. If this pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the material, then micro-cracks occur. Visible frost damage develops after an accumulation of micro-cracks as a result of several freeze-thaw cycles.Scherer G.W. (2006). Internal stress and cracking in stone and masonry.

Concrete Frost damage of early-age concrete is particularly harmful for the concrete mechanical resistance because the ice volume expansion causes micro-cracks in the concrete structures, and as a consequence it lowers the compressive strength of concrete. Therefore, when concreting at cold temperature cannot be avoided, it is essential to have a minimum curing time at a temperature sufficiently above the freezing point of the concrete pore water, so that the early strength of concrete is high enough to resist the inner tensile stress caused by water freezing.

Engraving by Ignaz Alberti. The Theater an der Wien as it appeared in 1815 Vestas Feuer (\\"The Vestal Flame\\"Translation from Lockwood (2008:82); a more literal translation would be \\"Vesta's Fire\\".) is a fragment of an opera composed in 1803 by Ludwig van Beethoven to a German libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder. The plot involves a romantic intrigue in which the heroine temporarily becomes a Vestal Virgin (a keeper of the Vestal Flame in Ancient Rome.) Beethoven set to music only the first scene of Schikaneder's libretto, then abandoned the project. The fragment (about ten minutes of music) is rarely performed. Background Emanuel Schikaneder (1751-1812) was not just a librettist but also an actor, singer, playwright, and theater director. He had already achieved a form of immortality in 1791 by authoring the libretto of (and generally sponsoring) Mozart's opera The Magic Flute, a tremendous success at its premiere and still an important part of his company's repertoire. According to Lockwood The Magic Flute was an opera that Beethoven \\"loved ... and knew like the back of his hand\\".Lockwood (2008:81) In 1801, Schikaneder's company had abandoned the Theater auf der Wieden in which The Magic Flute had premiered, and moved into a larger and grander theater he had built, the Theater an der Wien. This theater was well suited to Schikaneder's preference for theatrical spectacle, with elaborate scenery and stage effects. The theater opened with an opera about Alexander the Great, composed by Franz Teyber; the libretto had been offered by Schikaneder first to Beethoven, who had declined it.Lockwood (2008:80) By 1803, the year of his Beethoven collaboration, the 51-year-old Schikaneder was already seeing his career go into decline (ultimately, it collapsed entirely), but at the time he was still an important figure in the Viennese theatrical and musical scene.Lockwood (2008:79) \\"Vestas Feuer\\" was his last libretto.Kolb, Fabian (2006) Exponent des Wandels: Joseph Weigl und die Introduktion in seinen italienischen und deutschsprachigen Opern. M√ºnster: LIT Verlag, p. 105 fn. For Beethoven, 1803 was a pivotal year.This opinion is given, for instance, by Lockwood (2008:93). He was 32, and during the eleven years he had spent in Vienna he had already established himself as a leading composer. He had recently begun an important shift in his compositional methods and goals, a shift that emphasized the musical portrayal of heroism and led to what today is often called his Middle Period. Already completed were important new works such as the Op. 31 piano sonatas,See articles on Op. 31, No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3. and on his desk were massive new works representing the Middle Period in full flower: the Waldstein Sonata and the Third Symphony. Schikaneder and Beethoven's collaboration Beethoven's collaboration with Schikaneder was only the latest in a series of experiences he had had since arriving in Vienna in 1792 paralleling the life experiences (patrons, colleagues, performing venues, travel itineraries) of Mozart, who had died in 1791; for discussion see Mozart and Beethoven. During the years he spent at the Theater auf der Wieden, Schikaneder had found it efficient to live where he worked; i.e. in the same apartment complex that included the theater; many of his colleagues lived there too. Schikaneder made sure he could continue this practice by incorporating into the new Theater an der Wien a four-story apartment house where he and a number of members of his theatrical company dwelt. In early 1803 Schikaneder made another attempt to collaborate with Beethoven: he asked him to compose an opera for his theater, providing as a partial incentive free housing in the apartment complex. Beethoven agreed and moved into the complex, where he was to live from about April 1803 to May 1804, apart from some summer visits (his custom) to nearby rural locations in Baden and Oberd√∂bling. Beethoven's younger brother Kaspar KarlBeethoven by Maynard Solomon pg.169, who was acting as his business manager at the time, also moved into one of the theater's apartments. Beethoven scheduled a concert of his works for the theater in April; and the theater was to continue as a favored venue for him.Source for this paragraph: Lockwood (2008:80). For Beethoven concerts at the Theater an der Wien, see the article on this theater. At first Beethoven was free of any obligations in the collaboration, since Schikaneder did not finish his libretto for Beethoven until late October. Beethoven was in any event fully occupied with composing other works (see above). He began work on Vestas Feuer in late November and kept at it for about a month. Plot and musical structure Ancient Roman statue of a Vestal Virgin Lockwood summarizes the plot of Vestas Feuer thus: > The plot centers on the heroine Volivia and her lover Sartagones, \\"a noble > Roman,\\" whose father is Porus's sworn enemy. Intrigues are hatched by the > jealous slave Malo and by other characters led by Romenius, a Roman > official. Romenius also loves Volivia and, for her, has abandoned his former > lover, Sericia. Romenius manages to banish both Porus and Sartagones from > Rome. Volivia seeks refuge from Romenius's advances by becoming a priestess > in the Temple of Vesta, thus giving Romenius and his soldiers a reason to > destroy the temple -- whereupon the sacred flame is extinguished. After > various episodes, including the reappearance of Porus and Sartagones, > Romenius has Malo drowned in the Tiber but is himself stabbed by his jealous > lover Sericia. When all the evildoers are dead, the sacred flame > miraculously reignites itself, the Vestal Virgins rejoice, and Volivia is > reunited with Sartagones and Porus amid general rejoicing.Lockwood (2008:82) The first scene was the only one set by Beethoven. The setting for this scene was given thus by Schikaneder: > The theater [i.e. stage ] is an enchanting garden of cypresses; a waterfall > gushes forth in the center and runs into a brook at the right. On the left > is a tomb with several steps leading down. Dawn is shining through the > trees.Translation from Westermann's (1983) edition of the work. Lockwood gives the action of the scene: > Malo has been spying on the lovers, Volivia and Sartagones, and he rushes on > to tell Porus he has seen them together, presumably all night since it is > not morning. Porus is furious, because he hates Sartagones, and declares he > will disown his daughter. ... Porus and Malo hide as the lovers appear. Now > Sartagones and Volivia swear to love each other, but she anxiously begs > Sartagones to ask her father's blessing, assuring him that Porus is good > hearted. Porus suddenly emerges and confronts Sartagones, evoking their > ancient family feud. Volivia pleads, but Porus is adamant. Then Sartagones > draws his sword, asking \\"Will not she be mine?\\" Porus refuses, whereupon > Sartagones points the sword at his own breast. But Porus, whose anger turns > in a flash to sympathy, strikes the sword at once from Sartagones's hand, > singing with Volivia, \\"Halt ein!\\" [\\"Stop!\\"] ... Now Porus immediately turns > magnanimous, ... declaring \\"Since you love her so much, I will bestow her > upon you\\" and affirms his friendship with Sartagones. Malo, upset by all > this, leaves the stage, whereupon the three main characters -- the father > and the two lovers -- close the first scene in a joyful trio of mutual > affection.Lockwood (2008:83) As Lockwood notes, Beethoven set this stage action in four musical sections, with keys as noted: #G minor: dialog of Malo and Porus #E flat major: love duet of Volivia and Sartagonese #C minor: \\"accompanied dialog recitative: confrontation of Sartagones and Porus, ending in their reconciliation\\" #G major: final trio The scoring of the work is for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, and strings.Westermann (1983:2) Influences of Mozart Beethoven's music for Vestas Feuer sounds unmistakably Beethovenian, indeed, characteristic of the emerging Middle Period of his career. Nonetheless, clear influences from Mozart have been discerned. Lockwood hears in the \\"Halt ein!\\" portion of the scene Beethoven set an echo of 'a parallel moment in The Magic Flute in which Papageno is saved by intervention of the Three Boys from suicide. The love duet between Volivia and Sartagones, in E flat major and 6/8 time, evokes Mozart's \\"Bei M√§nnern welche Liebe f√ºhlen\\" (sung by Pamina and Papageno in The Magic Flute), which has the same key and time signature and was the subject of a set of variations for cello and piano by Beethoven (WoO 46),Lockwood (2008:84) written 1801.Date taken from contents page of Complete sonatas and variations for cello and piano: from the Breitkopf & H√§rtel complete works edition. Courier Corporation, 1990. Lockwood also discerns a precedent set by Mozart involving formal structure: an Introduzione; i.e. Beethoven's scene forms a separable initial section of an opera having some degree of integrity of both plot and harmonic plan; Lockwood calls the Introduzione a \\"miniplay\\". Three of Mozart's operas begin with such an Introduzione: Don Giovanni, Cos√¨ fan tutte, and The Magic Flute.They narrate, respectively, the killing of the Commendatore, the conclusion of an ill-fated bet, and the Three Ladies' initial encounter with Tamino. Beethoven's Introduzione has a harmonic structure echoing that of The Magic Flute. The downward sequence of keys given above (g minor, E flat major, c minor, G major) echoes the upward sequence of similar keys in the Introduzione section of The Magic Flute: c minor, E flat major, G major, C major. Nedbal (2009) notes that Beethoven emphasizes moral over personal aspects of the libretto, an echo of the overt moralizing seen throughout The Magic Flute. In contrast, Joseph Weigl's setting of the same words (see below) emphasizes the feelings and experience of the characters. Abandoning the project Beethoven eventually felt as intolerable both the Vestas Feuer libretto and the task of collaborating with Schikaneder, and he dropped the project. He expressed his opinions in a letter to Johann Friedrich Rochlitz: > I have finally broken with Schikaneder, whose kingdom has been entirely > eclipsed by the light of the clever and thoughtful French operas. Meanwhile > he has held me back for fully six months, and I have let myself be deceived > simply because, since he is undeniably good at creating stage effects, I > hoped that he would produce something more clever than usual. How wrong I > was. I hoped at least that he would have the verses and the contents of the > libretto corrected and improved by someone else, but in vain. For it was > impossible to persuade this arrogant fellow to do this. Well, I have given > up my arrangement with him, although I had composed several numbers. Just > picture to yourself a Roman subject (of which I had been told neither the > scheme nor anything else whatever) and language and verses such as could > come out of the mouths of our Viennese women apple-vendors.Lockwood > (2008:80-81); bracketed commentary is from Lockwood. Lockwood speculates that Beethoven must have felt some empathy at this stage with the long-dead Mozart, who unlike him had managed to bring his Schikaneder collaboration to a successful conclusion. Vestas Feuer as embryonic Fidelio Early in 1804, after dropping Vestas Feuer, Beethoven began work on a different opera, then entitled Leonora; which ultimately became Fidelio, now a cornerstone of the repertory. Lockwood explains why the Leonora libretto was everything to Beethoven that the Vestas Feuer libretto was not: > Giving up on Schikaneder's feeble libretto after two months, Beethoven > turned gratefully to a drama that offered characters and actions he could > take seriously: Leonore, Florestan, Pizarro, and his underling Rocco, along > with the profoundly moving chorus of suffering political prisoners, confined > in Pizarro's dungeons, who yearn for the light that symbolizes freedom. At > the end appears the benevolent minister Don Fernando, who resolves all > troubles. All these individuals, bearer of meanings far beyond operatic > plots and intrigues, embody authentic human issues in way that permitted > Beethoven to integrate operatic conventions into his moral vision.Lockwood > (2008:90-91) As there was no likelihood of any performance of the single scene of Vestas Feuer that he had composed, Beethoven was free to turn its music to other purposes. In particular, the final trio, in which Volivia and Sartagones celebrate their love (with the blessing of Volivia's father Porus) is audibly a first draft of the duet \\"O namenlose Freude\\", between the reunited Leonora and Florestan, a climactic point in the plot of Fidelio. Lockwood says of the Vestas Feuer version that it is \\"on a much higher level than all that has preceded it [in the scene Beethoven wrote]\\".Lockwood (2008:87) Beethoven also made sketches for a second scene, which evidently was never fully composed. Musicologist Alan Gosman indicates that these sketches included \\"a solo aria for Malo ... reused ... for Pizarro‚Äôs Aria with chorus 'Ha! Welch‚Äô ein Augenblick!' in Fidelio.\\"Beethoven‚Äôs Sketches for Vestas Feuer and their Relationship to the ‚ÄòEroica‚Äô Symphony and Leonore,\\" talk given 1 November 2012 at the University of Alabama; abstract posted on line at . Both characters are villains. Aftermath Schikaneder did not give up on his libretto but offered it to Joseph Weigl, who set it to music in full; this opera was performed at the Theater an der Wien‚Äîby then no longer under Schikaneder's direction‚Äîin August 1805.Nedbal (2009:279) It disappeared from the repertory following a run of 15 performancesNedbal (2009:279 fn.) and was never published.A partial libretto was printed in 1809; see . Nedbal (2009:419) was able to study Weigl's score by consulting the manuscript, still preserved in the Austrian National Library. For Schikaneder the events of the time were the beginning of the end. Jan Swafford narrates > ... a shake-up that resolved Beethoven's sticky contract situation with his > nominal employer and ex-librettist Schikaneder. In the beginning of 1804, > Baron Peter Anton Braun, who managed both court theaters,These were the > Burgtheater and the K√§rntnertortheater. bought the Theater an der Wien. > Shortly after, Braun fired Schikaneder as director of the theater, whose > statue as Papageno presided over the entrance. At that point Beethoven's > contract with Schikaneder for an opera was terminated, and he had to move > out of the theater. That solved the friction over Vestas Feuer, but it was a > setback for Leonore. Beethoven had been going at the opera full tilt > ...Swafford, Jan (2014) Beethoven: Anguish and Triumph. Houghton Mifflin > Harcourt. Excerpts on line at The rest of Schikaneder's life involved a brief period rehired at the Theater an der Wien, followed by a period of playing the provinces, insanity, poverty, and his death in 1812 at age 61. Critical assessment In assessing Schikaneder's libretto, modern critics tend to agree with Beethoven (see above). Lockwood, in his Beethoven biography, calls it \\"a mediocre piece of hackwork.\\"Lockwood, Lewis (2003) Beethoven: The Music and the Life. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, p. 55. Barry Cooper describes it as \\"lamentable.\\"Barry Cooper (2008) Beethoven. Oxford: Oxford University Press. The cited material may be read on line: Paul Robinson, after noting an old letter indicating that Beethoven was looking for a \\"reasonable text\\" says: > Vestas Feuer is not a reasonable text. It is a ponderously heroic affair set > in ancient Rome (though the names of the characters suggest Parthia or > India) and replete with tedious intrigue. Schikaneder had lapsed from > pantomime into the stagnant backwash of Metastasio while retaining (in > Beethoven's words to Rochlitz) 'language and verses such as could only > proceed out of the mouths of our Viennese apple-women.'Robinson, Paul (1996) > Ludwig Van Beethoven: Fidelio. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. > Excerpted on line by Google: . Westermann (1983) evidently finds the first scene tolerable but goes on to say, \\"from here on the text deteriorates into a quagmire of complicated theatricality which Beethoven did well to abandon.\\"Westermann (1983:1) In contrast reviewers have expressed admiration for Beethoven's music. For instance, Alan Blythe, reviewing the 1997 Deutsche Gramophone recording for Gramophone, called it \\"really worth hearing\\" (in contradistinction to most of Beethoven's miscellaneous stage music).Blythe's review is posted at . In 1954, on the first publication of the work by Willy Hess (see below), the musicologist Donald MacArdle rejoiced: \\"For the concert-goer, Hess has brought back to life a melodious and dramatic composition which should be widely heard and enjoyed\\"McArdle (1954:134) (the intervening decades have not, it seems, brought this wish to fulfillment). Lockwood writes: > Vestas Feuer shows Beethoven advancing his knowledge of operatic technique > for the first time. We see him carefully fashioning an opening scene on the > Mozartean model, devoting himself to it with his usual concentration and > creative seriousness, determined to give it his best despite the triviality > of the text. This score and its sketches (the latter still unpublished) show > him working to rescue something of value from Schikaneder's libretto. More > than a few moments in the score -- Malo's running feet, the hero and > heroine's quiet pledge of love, Sartagones' confrontation with Porus, and > finally, the swiftly moving, well-knit Trio -- show the mature Beethoven > endeavoring to make something emotionally and musically effective from the > materials he had to work with. However modest its place in Beethoven's > larger development, Vestas Feuer is valuable for what it reveals: Beethoven, > in a crucial year of his artistic life, striving to master operatic > technique, poised between one of his greatest models, The Magic Flute, and > his own first complete opera to come.Lockwood 2008:91-93 Publication history Vestas Feuer was forgotten for decades. In 1865, Beethoven's biographer Alexander Wheelock Thayer pointed out \\"that the archives of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde contained a draft, complete in all significant details, of an operatic movement by Beethoven\\" (quotation from MacArdle 1954). Gustav Nottebohm published extracts of the unidentified material in 1872.Gustav Nottebohm (1872) Beethoveniana. Leipzig: C. F. Peters. Reprinted 1970: Johnson Reprint Corporation, New York and London. In 1930 the work was identified by Raoul Biberhofer as being the opening scene of Vestas Feuer by Schikaneder.MacArdle (1954:133).

He has been called \\"the father of Canadian ecology\\". He was the brother of meteorologist Patrick McTaggart-Cowan. Life and career McTaggart-Cowan was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and moved to North Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with his family when he was three years old. He completed studies at the University of British Columbia and then at the University of California at Berkeley, where he studied deer under Joseph Grinnell. Upon returning to Canada, he took up a position at the provincial museum in British Columbia (later renamed the Royal British Columbia Museum) for six years. He next took a professorship at the University of British Columbia, where he established the first university wildlife program in Canada. McTaggart-Cowan was active in early studies of British Columbia Provincial Parks and Canada's Rocky Mountain National Parks. More so than many other ecologists of the time, McTaggart-Cowan stressed the importance of studies of individual variation, in addition to population-based studies. McTaggart-Cowan supervised more than 100 graduate students; many became eminent scientists in academia and government. According to his own recollection, at one point, the wildlife division of every Canadian province that had one was being headed by one of McTaggart-Cowan's former students. Among the more than 275 publications which he authored or coauthored is the comprehensive, encyclopedic four-volume Birds of British Columbia, to which he was a major contributor. McTaggart-Cowan had secret annual meetings with American Aldo Leopold and other conservation biologists to discuss educating the public about nature conservation. He warned about the ecological dangers of pesticides and climate change long before they became well-known problems. McTaggart-Cowan acted as an environmental advocate within the confines of the political system, by writing to government ministers. He was influential in the field of wildlife management, ending the previously widespread practice of awarding bounties for the killing of \\"undesirable\\" wildlife species in Canada. McTaggart-Cowan was the head of the University of British Columbia's Zoology Department from 1953 to 1964, whereupon he became the Dean of Graduate Studies. After his retirement in 1975, McTaggart-Cowan served as the chancellor of the University of Victoria from 1979 to 1984. He was an avid hunter and a respected philatelist. He was a pioneer of science television, including hosting the series Fur and Feather, The Living Sea, and Web of Life. In total, he was the co-author of six teaching films on mammalian behaviour, 110 educational television programs, and more than 200 radio broadcasts. He was the first to broadcast microscope images of microorganisms on television. He also reportedly started the broadcasting career of David Suzuki by hiring him to follow in his footsteps. The Cowan Vertebrate Museum in Vancouver was named in his honour, as are a number of awards. He was the recipient of multiple honorary degrees, including honorary D.Sc. degrees from the University of British Columbia, the University of Victoria, and the University of Northern British Columbia, and LL.D. degrees from the University of Alberta and Simon Fraser University. At the time of his death in 2010, McTaggart-Cowan had received more awards than almost any other Canadian scientist. The Ian McTaggart-Cowan Archive, housed at the University of Victoria Special Collections and University Archives, incorporates more than 7,000 handwritten pages from his field research. Personal life McTaggart-Cowan was married for more than 70 years to Joyce McTaggart-Cowan (n√©e Racey), the daughter of his mentor Kenneth Racey. They had a son, Garry, and a daughter, Ann. Select awards and honours McTaggart-Cowan's awards and honours included: * Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada (1946) * Fellow of the Arctic Institute of North America (1955) * Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1955) * Fellow of the California Academy of Sciences (1955) * Canadian Centennial Medal (1967) * Officer of the Order of Canada (1972) * Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal (1977) * Officer of the Order of British Columbia (1991) References Further reading * Jakimchuck, R.

A forward, he played 14 seasons with the Newcastle Eagles of the British Basketball League (BBL). Smith has been considered one of the greatest BBL players ever, representing both the Eagles and Scottish Rocks and most notably winning the BBL Most Valuable Player Award in 2015. Originally from Philadelphia, he competed for Rider at the college level. His professional career spanned across several countries, including Austria, Turkey, Portugal, and Spain, although a majority of his years were spent in Great Britain. Smith's career achievements include winning the BBL Championship six times, the BBL Trophy five times, and the BBL Cup one time. He has been named MVP of each of the competitions on a total of six occasions. In addition, Smith has been a part of three different BBL Teams of the Year. He retired as the all-time leading scorer for the Newcastle Eagles and had his number retired by the team after the end of his career.  High school career  Smith played basketball as a center for Chichester High School in Boothwyn, Pennsylvania. As a junior at the District 1 Class AAAA playoffs, he scored 35 points in a loss to Glen Mills. In the senior season in 1993, Smith became one of the top scorers in his county. On January 6, he led Chichester to its first win over Glen Mills in seven years with 29 points. On January 29, he paced his team with 34 points and 15 rebounds in a win over Harriton. On February 3, Chichester defeated Academy Park behind Smith's team-best 25 points. He helped stage a 10-point comeback late in the game, scoring 15 points in four minutes of the fourth quarter. Smith commented, \\"This was definitely the best stretch of basketball I ever had.\\" In another notable performance on February 12, he scored a game-high 32 points against Chester. By the end of his final season, Smith was averaging 25.1 points, 11.0 rebounds and 4.0 blocks per game, and he was named Player of the Year in the Del-Val League.  College career  Smith began playing college basketball for the Rider Broncs.  Professional career  Shortly after college, Smith began playing at the professional level in Venezuela and Taiwan. He returned to Pennsylvania from 1997 to 1999, when he competed for the York City Cyclones of the Eastern Basketball Alliance (EBA). Smith played his first season in the British Basketball League (BBL) with the Newcastle Eagles in 1999‚Äì2000. He averaged 16.2 points and 6.2 rebounds per game.

His first year was 2000-2001 under coach Craig Lynch and since then apart from one year in Spain and 3 games for the Scottish Rocks he has remained an Eagle. Charles comes from a family background of basketball. Both his brothers play in Europe professionally. He starred for Rider University in New Jersey in his college days and since coming to England has demonstrated himself to be one of the smoothest and most complete scorers in BBL history. He has been MVP in no fewer than three separate final games. He now lives in the UK with his wife, Nicola, and three young daughters. Since retiring from Professional Basketball, Charles has started working at the Asda store in Washington.

It is held during Kirchweih festivals in the lower Gail Valley, where it has become a major tourist attraction. The ≈°tehvanje competition has also taken place every year in Savlje, Ljubljana and sometimes in neighboring villages since the 1930s. History It is commonly believed that ≈°tehvanje is the rustic form of a Roman knight game called quintain. It originated in conjunction with medieval tournaments, local blessings and Pentecostal games. It may have come from the Upper Italian Friuli and Istria regions, where it was popular in the 18th century. Carters brought this game with them as they traveled from Trieste to Vienna, passing Udine and Tarvisio. Slovene quintain in Achomitz (Zahomec), Gail Valley, 1951 The Slovene name derives from the German word stechen 'to stab', which indicates that in the beginning players stabbed a barrel with a long iron pole. However, because the pole was never sharp enough to stick into a wooden barrel, riders began to use an iron bat (Koliƒç). In 1804 Archduke John of Austria mentioned a Kufenstechen tournament he had witnessed in Sankt Stefan im Gailtal. The game has been present in the villages of Ljubljansko Posavje (Je≈æica, Savlje, Kleƒçe, Sto≈æice and Mala Vas) since 1935, when ethnomusicologist France Marolt presented this custom at a folklore festival in Ljubljana. The exercises were held under the leadership of Janko Zwitter from Achomitz (Slovene: Zahomec) in the Gail Valley.Opis enote ≈æive kulturne dedi≈°ƒçine. Ministrstvo za izobra≈æevanje, znanost, kulturo in ≈°port Variations Gailtaler Tracht, Feistritz At the Gail Valley quintain, a wooden pole is hammered into the ground. A wooden barrel, wrapped with hazel rings, is placed on the pole. Young men then ride past the barrel and hit it with metal bats, trying to cut hazel rings. They are dressed in Gailtal folk costumes (Trachten) and ride Noriker heavy horses. They ride three times to get a prize wreath. Then the boys sing a ceremonial song \\"God Give Us Good Time\\" (), which is followed by a ceremonial folk dance named the High Dance () or the First Dance (). Boys take girls likewise dressed in colorful Gailtal costumes, under the linden tree (na rej pod lipo). Dancing is accompanied with songs in Slovene and German. The quintain in Savlje has a more competitive nature. The men collect points when cutting hazel rings on the barrel. The winner is the one who scores the most points. They are dressed in Upper Carniola national costumes. After the game follows traditional Slovene festivities and a raffle.

As the director of Necrosoft Games, Sheffield has created various games for PlayStation Mobile, including Gunsport and Oh Deer!. After going through a breakup in 2014, Sheffield worked together with illustrator Dami Lee to create the webcomic No Girlfriend Comics, which chronicles his experiences of suddenly being single after a two-year relationship. Necrosoft Games As the director of Necrosoft Games, Sheffield has worked on a number of video games for PlayStation Mobile before the service discontinued in September 2015. In February 2015, Sheffield created Gunsport, a \\"cyberpunk volleyball\\" game on the PlayStation Vita. Together with video game composer Motohiro Kawashima, whom he met while visiting Ancient Corp's Yuzo Koshiro, Sheffield worked on the racing game Oh Deer!. Inspired by Outrun 2, the game's main mechanics were programmed by Decinoge. Sheffield was editor-in-chief of Game Developer Magazine and was senior contributing editor at Gamasutra. No Girlfriend Comics The first panel of No Girlfriend Comics final strip. After Sheffield broke up with his girlfriend in 2014, he started writing brief descriptions of his experiences, such as the awkwardness of leaving the house without a girlfriend and the depressing nature of going to bed alone. Though he felt his emotions were unique to himself, he realized that his reactions and resulting routines were very similar to those of other people that have gone through a break-up. At this point, Sheffield contacted illustrator Dami Lee to turn the stories into comic strips. This project resulted in the webcomic No Girlfriend Comics, which ran on Tapastic from August to December 2014. Sheffield believes Lee \\"added bits of herself here and there,\\" making the webcomic more relatable in the process. The series eventually consisted of twenty individual strips, despite fans wanting the series to continue. According to Lee, \\"it felt right to end it at 20 comics instead of continuing the series; it represented a passing phase that everyone goes through at some point. The comic came to its natural end, just like a lot of relationships.\\" Sheffield and Lee worked together again to create the webcomic Hot Comics for Cool People, which was syndicated in SF Weekly in 2016.

Albums were recorded from the late 1980s to late 1990s, with the band performing with various line-ups until 2012.  Biography  In 1982, Brucato and Reinhardt joined forces with Puleo and Greg Piontek and Rick McGirr to create Gamelon. In the mid-1980s, the classic line up of Puleo, Brucato, Ted Reinhardt, and brother Tom Reinhardt was formed, re-spelling their name to the more phonetically pleasing Gamalon. This lineup released their self-titled debut album Gamalon in 1987. Following that release the lineup was augmented by violinist Geoff Perry. They went on to record Aerial View and High Contrast. In 1995, Puleo left the band and was replaced by Tony Scozzaro. This lineup recorded one album, Held to the Light. After Scozzaro left, guitar duties were handled by Nori Bucci and Dave Schmeidler. After bassist Tom Reinhardt left the band, he was replaced at various times by Jim Wynne and Jack Kulp, before returning to the lineup in the 2000s. The band played a reunion show in 2012 in New York with the classic 4-piece lineup. Bruce Brucato died on January 15, 2014. On March 4, 2015, founding and core member Ted Reinhardt died in a plane crash. Reinhardt has also played with Rodan , Taxi, Willie and the Reinhardts , Ron Locurto and the Reinhardts , the Dave Constantino Band , Junction West , Left Hand of Darkness and Spyro Gyra. In 1973, playing with a Buffalo band called Rush, Ted opened for Genesis in Buffalo, NY. Three Gamalon members brothers Ted and Tom Reinhardt, and Bruce Brucato played in a band called Rodan in the 1970s, along with keyboardist Rick McGirr and bassist Bill Ludwig.

Commonly, comic conventions are multi-day events hosted at convention centers, hotels, or college campuses. They feature a wide variety of activities and panels, with a larger number of attendees participating in cosplay than most other types of fan conventions. Comic book conventions are also used as a vehicle for industry, in which publishers, distributors, and retailers represent their comic-related releases. Comic book conventions may be considered derivatives of science-fiction conventions, which began in the late 1930s. Comic-cons were traditionally organized by fans on a not-for-profit basis, though nowadays most events catering to fans are run by commercial interests for profit. Many conventions have award presentations relating to comics (such as the Eisner Awards, which have been presented at San Diego Comic-Con International since 1988; or the Harvey Awards, which have been presented at a variety of venues also since 1988). At commercial events, comic book creators often give out autographs to the fans, sometimes in exchange for a flat appearance fee, and sometimes may draw illustrations for a per-item fee. Commercial conventions are usually quite expensive and are hosted in hotels. This represents a change in comic book conventions, which traditionally were more oriented toward comic books as a mode of literature, and maintained a less caste-like differentiation between professional and fan. The first official comic book convention was held in 1964 in New York City and was called New York Comicon.Ballman, \\"The 1964 New York Comicon: The True Story Behind the World's First Comic Book Convention (The 1960s: The Silver Age of Comic Conventions) (Volume 1)\\"History Channel, \\"Superheroes Decoded: Comic-Con  History\\" Early conventions were small affairs, usually organized by local enthusiasts (such as Jerry Bails, later known as the \\"Father of Comic Fandom\\", and Dave Kaler of the Academy of Comic- Book Fans and Collectors), and featuring a handful of industry guests. The first recurring conventions were the Detroit Triple Fan Fair, which ran from 1965‚Äì1978, and Academy Con, which ran from 1965‚Äì1967. Many recurring conventions begin as single-day events in small venues, which as they grow more popular expand to two days, or even three or more every year. Many comic- cons which had their start in church basements or union halls now fill convention centers in major cities.Babka, Allison. \\"Wizard World Inc.: A roving comic con looks to corner the geek market,\\" The Riverfront Times (April 3, 2014). Nowadays, comic conventions are big business, with recurring shows in every major American city. Comic book conventions in name only, the biggest shows include a large range of pop culture and entertainment elements across virtually all genres, including horror, animation, anime, manga, toys, collectible card games, video games, webcomics, and fantasy novels. San Diego Comic-Con International, a multigenre entertainment and comic convention held annually in San Diego since 1970, is the standard bearer for U.S. comic-cons. According to Forbes, the convention is the \\"largest convention of its kind in the world;\\" and is also the largest convention held in San Diego. According to the San Diego Convention and Visitor's Bureau, the convention has an annual regional economic impact of $162.8 million, with a $180 million economic impact in 2011. However, in 2017, SDCC lost its record of the largest annual multigenre convention to S√£o Paulo's Comic Con Experience (first held in 2014). Internationally, the world's largest comic book convention, in terms of attendees, is Japan's Comiket (first held in 1975), which boasts annual attendance of over half a million people.McCarthy, \\"Manga: A Brief History\\", 500 Manga Heroes & Villains, p. 14. Italy's Lucca Comics & Games (first held in 1965) and France's Angoul√™me International Comics Festival (first staged in 1974) are the world's second and third largest comic festivals, respectively.  History   Origins  In 1961 or 1962, Jerry Bails was vital in the formation of the Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors (ACBFC), the first official organization of comic book enthusiasts and historians. The ACBFC brought fans of the medium together, administered the first industry awards, and assisted in the establishment of the first comic book conventions. The Academy's first order of business was to administer the Alley Awards, which traced their origin to \\"a letter to Jerry dated October 25, 1961,\\" by fellow enthusiast (and future comics professional) Roy Thomas, in which he suggested to Bails that his fanzine Alter-Ego create its own awards to reward fandom's \\"favorite comic books in a number of categories\\" in a manner similar to the Oscars.Schelly, Bill. \\"Jerry Bails' Ten Building Blocks of Fandom,\\" Alter Ego vol. 3, No. 25 (June 2003), pp. 5‚Äì8. The first Alley Awards, given for the calendar year 1961, were reported in Alter Ego No. 4 (Oct. 1962).  Alley Talley and other gatherings of 1964  On March 21‚Äì22, 1964, the first annual \\"Alley Tally\\" by ACBFC members was organized by Bails at his house in Detroit, with the purpose of counting \\"the Alley Award ballots for 1963.\\" This became notable in retrospect as the first major gathering of comics fans, predating the earliest comic book conventions, which were held later in the year.Skinn, Dez. \\"Early days of UK comics conventions and marts,\\" DezSkinn.com. Accessed March 3, 2013. Attendees included Ronn Foss, Don Glut, Don and Maggie Thompson, Mike Vosburg, and Grass Green. Comics historian Bill Schelly notes that the Alley Tally and \\"even larger fan meetings in Chicago . . . helped build momentum\\" for these earliest conventions. (The Chicago gathering occurred May 9‚Äì10, 1964; it featured \\"several dozen\\" attendees, a dealer room, and film showings.)Gabilliet, Of Comics and Men, p. 265. In addition, an unnamed convention held May 24, 1964, in the Hotel Tuller, Detroit, Michigan, was organized by teenagers Robert Brusch and Dave Szurek,Duncan & Smith, The Power of Comics, p. 183. with assistance from Bails and members of the Michigan Science Fiction Society.Cooke, Jon B. \\"Rich Buckler Breaks Out!

As befitting a convention run by the Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors, the Alley Awards were presented at all three Academy Cons. The 1965 Academy Con also featured one of the first recorded \\"superhero masquerades,\\" or costume contests. 1965 also saw the genesis of what became the annual Italian comic book convention Lucca Comics & Games.

In 1967, new conventions were inaugurated in St. Louis and Houston. The Houstoncon ran biennially and then annually until 1982. In 1968, two important conventions had their start. Taking over for the Academy Con, Brooklyn native and school teacher Phil Seuling hosted the International Convention of Comic Book Art at the Statler Hilton Hotel in New York City on July 4‚Äì7. The guests of honor were Stan Lee and Burne Hogarth.Schelly, Founders of Comic Fandom, p. 107. This annual convention, which later became known as the Comic Art Convention (CAC), hosted the presentation of the Alley Awards from 1968‚Äì1970. CAC ran annually (occasionally in Philadelphia) over Independence Day weekend, until 1983. In England, Phil Clarke produced Comicon '68 (British Comic Art Convention) at the Midland Hotel, Birmingham, from August 30 ‚Äì September 2, 1968. \\"Member\\"-guests include Alan Moore, Paul Neary, Jim Baikie, Steve Moore, and Nick Landau; there were 70 attendees. The British Comicon ran annually, variously in Birmingham, London, and Sheffield, until 1981.  The 1970s and explosive growth  Comic book conventions increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions of the modern era being established during the decade. In the early 1970s, conventions sprang up in almost every major American city (and some minor ones), as well as in London, with Comic Mart, a bimonthly trade show which ran regularly until the mid-1980s. Comic book creators, editors, and publishers began to make it part of their routine to attend conventions as official guests. On August 1‚Äì3, 1970, Shel Dorf produced the Golden State Comic-Con, held at the U.S. Grant Hotel, in San Diego. Official guests were Forrest J. Ackerman, Ray Bradbury, Jack Kirby, Bob Stevens, and A. E. van Vogt, and it drew It drew 300 people.Comic-Con Souvenir Book No. 40 p.61 (2009).

During this time, Creation branched out from comics and began producing conventions in the horror and science fiction genres; it was particularly known for its Doctor Who conventions. After 1988, the company stopped producing comic book conventions to focus on its other, more profitable, fan conventions.  The 1980s  Both the Heroes Convention and the multigenre Dallas Fantasy Fair debuted in 1982. HeroesCon is one of the largest independent comic book conventions still operating; during the heyday of the Dallas Fantasy Fair, it was one of the largest comics conventions in the country, third in attendance behind the San Diego Comic-Con and the Chicago Comicon. (The Dallas Fantasy Fair went defunct in 1995.) Comic book conventions spread to Canada and Switzerland in 1985; also debuting that year was the United Kingdom Comic Art Convention (UKCAC), first held September 21‚Äì22, 1985, at the University of London Union.

By the end of the 1980s, comic book conventions were evolving into sprawling affairs that promoted films, television shows, celebrity performers, video games, toys, and cosplay as much as (if not more than) comic books. Many historians date this shift to the release of Tim Burton's Batman film in 1989, which sparked the convention circuit's newfound embrace of Hollywood.  Great Eastern fills a gap  Great Eastern Conventions produced comic book conventions for nearly 20 years, but most actively during the years 1987‚Äì1996. In New York City, the Great Eastern shows filled the gap after the mid-1980s demise of the annual Comic Art Convention and Creation Conventions. From 1993‚Äì1995, Great Eastern hosted two New York City shows annually at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. (The 1995 show was the last comic book convention held at the Javits Center until the New York Comic Con in 2006.) Great Eastern also ran shows in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts,Doten, Patti. \\"Comics convention a real draw,\\" Boston Globe (Jan 21, 1995), p. 23. Oregon, Minnesota, Texas, and South Florida. Despite their large fan attendance and expansive venues, however, Great Eastern's large shows were criticized by many within the industry for pandering to dealers and spectacle. As frequent participant Evan Dorkin stated, \\"The New York shows are extremely unfriendly to both creators and fans. . . . There is limited programming, limited professional appearances at these shows.\\"\\"Newswatch: NYC Comics Convention Cancelled, Fans Irate,\\" The Comics Journal #185 (Mar. 1996), pp. 18‚Äì19. In March 1996, Great Eastern, at a very late point, cancelled what had been advertised as a larger-than-usual New York show, scheduled to be held at the New York Coliseum on 59th St. & Columbus Circle. As a substitute event, comic book retailer Michael Carbonaro and others on the spur of the moment mounted the first Big Apple Comic Con, now a long-running show. Greenberg and Great Eastern Conventions disappeared from the fan convention circuit from that moment forward  Small press conventions and comic book \\"festivals\\"  In response to the big conventions' shifting focus away from comic books themselves, a number of small conventions sprang up in the mid-1990s that turned the focus back onto comics, particularly those not published by the big mainstream companies DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Many of these \\"indy cons\\" were inspired by Cerebus creator Dave Sim. In 1992, Sim partnered with Great Eastern Conventions in promoting small conventions in over 20 U.S. locations,Hibbs, Brian. \\"Blood & Thunder: Who Bears the Burden: Retailer or Publisher,\\" The Comics Journal #148 (Feb. 1992), p. 7. including Indiana, Oregon, Texas, as well as in South Florida. And in 1995, Sim toured the country in a self-styled nine-stop \\"Spirits of Independence\\" tour.MacDonald, Heidi. \\"Have your CAKE in Chicago next June,\\" The Beat (Aug, 18, 2011): \\"Chicago being one of the original stops** on the Spirits of Independence tour that launched the entire indie comics show experience.\\" The antecedent to these new \\"comic festivals\\" may have been Berkeleycon 73, held April 20‚Äì22, 1973, at the Pauley Ballroom, ASUC Building, University of California, Berkeley. Berkeleycon was the first convention devoted to underground comix (which had their unofficial mecca in the San Francisco Bay Area). The first exclusively small press conventions were CAPTION, which debuted in Oxford, England in 1992; the Alternative Press Expo (APE), which debuted in San Jose, California in 1994; and the Small Press Expo (SPX), which premiered in Bethesda, Maryland in 1994.  Wizard takes over  Wizard Entertainment purchased the Chicago Comicon in 1997 to expand from its core publishing business into trade/consumer conventions.\\"News Watch: Wizard Magazine Buys Chicago Comicon\\". The Comics Journal. No. 195 (April 1997), p. 24. In just a few years, the now renamed \\"Wizard World Chicago\\" event boasted a weekend attendance of over 58,000 people. Wizard World Chicago was the template for a new kind of convention that shifted its focus from actual comic books to ancillary elements of pop culture fandom: celebrity performers, films, television, video games, and toys ‚Äî \\"comic conventions\\" almost in name only. In 2002, Wizard produced \\"Wizard World East\\" in Philadelphia, a still-ongoing show (now known as \\"Wizard World Philadelphia\\").Atchison, Lee. \\"Wizard World East,\\" Sequential Tart (June 2002).

Accessed January 30, 2016. and Boston in 2005. Beginning in 2009, Wizard made a concerted push to dominate the U.S. convention circuit, as it began acquiring existing conventions and starting new ones in various cities. To begin, Wizard World acquired the Big Apple Convention, New York City's longest-running multigenre pop culture convention. (Wizard gave up the New York market after 2013.) In 2009, Wizard World also acquired the Paradise Comics Toronto Comicon.Armitage, Hugh (June 25, 2009). \\"Wizard CEO buys Toronto Comicon\\". Digital Spy.\\"Wizard's Gareb Shamus Buys Toronto Comicon\\". Comic Book Resources. June 24, 2009 Beginning in 2010, Wizard Entertainment produced a \\"North American Comic Con\\" tour. City stops included Toronto, Anaheim, Philadelphia, Chicago, New York City, Austin, and Boston. By 2013, Wizard conventions included Portland Comic Con, St. Louis Comic Con, Philadelphia Comic Con, NYC Experience, Chicago Comic Con, Ohio Comic Con, Nashville Comic Con, Austin Comic Con, and New Orleans Comic Con. And in September 2013, Wizard World announced seven new stops for the 2014 tour: Sacramento, Louisville, Minneapolis, Atlanta, San Antonio, Richmond (Virginia), and Tulsa.MacDonald, Heidi. \\"Wizard World adds seven cities including Tulsa, Sacramento, and San Antonio,\\" The Beat (September 17, 2013). This explosion in Wizard-produced conventions brought accusations that the entertainment behemoth was deliberately trying to push its competitors out of business.Matt Fraction on HeroesCon/Wizard World, Comic Book Resources (July 22, 2005).MacDonald, Heidi. \\"Con Wars in Minneapolis as Wizard World schedules show two weeks before Spring Con,\\" The Beat (August 13, 2013) On the other hand, many praised Wizard's professional and standardized approach to producing conventions.  Conventions as big business  Starting in the mid-2000s, ongoing comic book conventions sprung up in most major U.S. cities, most of which are still ongoing. [See List of comic book conventions] These pop-cultural gatherings attract tens of thousands of fans and generate millions of dollars in revenue every year. In addition to the Wizard-run conventions, Comic-Con International runs the San Diego Comic-Con International, WonderCon, and formerly ran the Alternative Press Expo; while Reed Exhibitions runs the New York Comic Con and the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo.  Types  Since the first conventions in the mid-1960s, hundreds of local and regional comic book conventions have sprung up around the world either as one-time or annual events. At these conventions, fans of comic books come together with the professional writers, artists, editors, and publishers of the field to discuss its many aspects. Increasingly, comic conventions have expanded in scope to encompass the gamut of pop culture phenomena relating to comics, from film, television, and animation to gaming and collectibles. Some cities have a number of comic-cons. Nearly every weekend of the year now has at least one convention somewhere, and some conventions are held on holiday weekends where four or more days can be devoted to events. Commercial shows vs. volunteer conventions  An important distinction can be made between commercial events (often called \\"shows\\") ‚Äì those run by dedicated companies who specialize in con organization, or by local for-profit firms ‚Äì and volunteer-run cons. Usually run for profit, commercial events tend to charge for \\"tickets\\" or \\"admission\\" rather than having \\"memberships\\". A primary focus of commercial events is meeting celebrities, such as stars of TV shows and movies, professional wrestlers, glamour models, etc. There are frequently very long lines of people waiting for autographs at commercial events. While famous actors like William Shatner of Star Trek are paid tens of thousands of dollars per convention, minor and obscure bit players pay to set up booths to sell autographs and memorabilia. Commercial events also tend to have less small-scale programming; panels will more often be composed of famous actors, directors, etc. on press junkets, where the panels are held in very large rooms with very high attendance. The largest conventions (in terms of attendance) tend to be commercial ones. Commercial events tend to be more likely to be about popular visual media than volunteer cons, and they also tend to attract the younger generation, but this is not absolute by any means. Some commercial conventions have been known to aggressively go after fan-run conventions via their legal teams. Volunteer conventions, on the other hand, tend to be smaller in scope and more intimate in character. Although there are frequent autograph sessions, they tend to be less of an attraction for volunteer cons. Admission to volunteer cons is usually called \\"membership,\\" thus emphasizing that the fans themselves are the ones who make up the con, rather than the staff who run commercial cons. A community of fans who run such conventions has developed, and many of them share their best practices and keep convention- running traditions alive.  Comics festivals and \\"indy shows\\"  So-called \\"comics festivals\\" are based on a European model started by such long-running conventions as Lucca Comics & Games and the Angoul√™me International Comics Festival. Festivals are much more focused on the art and literature of the comics form, and only minimally on related pop culture expression and merchandising. In the U.S., comics festival and \\"indy shows\\" tend to highlight the \\"alternative comics\\" genre, not the work of \\"mainstream\\" publishers like DC Comics and Marvel Comics. Cosplaying is rarely if ever a feature of these conventions. Some notable North American small press conventions include: * Alternative Press Expo (APE), San Jose, California (1994‚Äì2017) ‚Äì produced in San Francisco for 15 years * Small Press Expo (SPX), Bethesda, Maryland (1994‚Äìpresent) * Small Press and Alternative Comics Expo (SPACE), Columbus, Ohio (2000‚Äìpresent) ‚Äì Produced by small-press publisher Back Porch Comics * East Coast Black Age of Comics Convention (ECBACC), Philadelphia (2002‚Äìpresent) ‚Äì focuses on black creators and characters * MoCCA Festival, New York City (2002‚Äìpresent) ‚Äì originally produced by the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art; now produced by the Society of Illustrators * Toronto Comic Arts Festival (TCAF), Toronto (2003‚Äìpresent) ‚Äì produced by the retailer The Beguiling * Comic Expo (Bristol International Comic & Small Press Expo), Bristol, England (2004‚Äì2014) ‚Äì produced by retailer Mike Allwood * Stumptown Comics Fest, Portland, Oregon (2004‚Äì2013) * STAPLE!, Austin, Texas (2005‚Äìpresent) * Comic Arts Brooklyn (CAB) (formerly known as Brooklyn Comics and Graphics Fest [BCGF]), Brooklyn, New York (2009‚Äìpresent) ‚Äì produced by the retailer Desert Island Comics * Cartoon Crossroads Columbus (CXC), Columbus, Ohio (2015‚Äìpresent)  \\"Comics-only\\" shows  Comics-only conventions emerged in response to the sprawling pop culture-focused conventions epitomized by Wizard Entertainment, San Diego Comic Con International, and the New York Comic Con. \\"Comics-only\\" shows tend to hearken back to the comic book conventions of the 1970s and 1980s: still focused on the genres of superhero, fantasy, horror, and crime; as well as dealers selling back issues and other collectibles, but without the domineering presence of the mainstream publishers, or film and television producers. Notable \\"comics-only\\" conventions include: * Baltimore Comic-Con (est. 2000 in Baltimore, MD) * Big Apple Comic Con (est. 1996 in New York City) * Heroes Convention (est. 1982 in Charlotte, NC) Organization and staffing Comic book conventions were traditionally run and staffed by volunteers, though venues may require certain activities to be contracted out. Event funding typically relies on convention registrations.Guidestar.org ‚Äì see Anthrocon, Anthropomorphic Arts and Education, Midwest Furry Fandom and the Oklahoma Association of Anthropomorphic Arts Nowadays, many of the larger conventions are incorporated as non-profit organizations, usually to achieve tax-exempt status and safeguard the organizers' personal assets ‚Äì in the US, some are 501(c)(3) charities, while others are registered as recreational clubs. The largest events may require up to a hundred volunteers. Volunteers often receive T-shirts or other benefits. Timing and duration Most comic book conventions take place over a weekend, with events scheduled between Friday evening and Sunday afternoon. Saturday is typically the busiest day, as most fans must return home on Sunday. One-day passes are sometimes sold at a reduced price. Reasons for this include: * Most fans would have to take a vacation from work or study to attend an event held during the workweek. * Transportation costs are often lower for weekend travelers. * Hotels have few business travelers during the weekend, making it much easier to reserve a block of rooms and secure space for programming at a reduced price. Many fans are students and have little discretionary income, so hotel and convention fees are important factors. In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, both WonderCon and Dragon Con have been canceled, and San Diego Comic-Con moved their programming online. Anatomy of a typical convention Although wide variations exist between different conventions, there is a general pattern to which most adhere.  Attendees  Attendees include artists and dealers offering products and services for sale to fans, and those wish to buy them. Others come for the programming, or to meet friends or other comic book fans in general. Many attend for all of these reasons. Some later publish a \\"con report\\" detailing their experiences. Attendees of major conventions receive a bag with the convention program, a lavishly illustrated volume featuring themed artwork, articles submitted by members and the official guests, along with a description of the event's programming, staff, rules, guests, and any charity being supported by the convention.Anthrocon 2006 convention book Local restaurant information and a combination pocket schedule and map may also be included. Sponsors often receive additional items such as T-shirts, pins, or ribbons, as well as faster registration badge pick-up and on-site meals. They may also be displayed prominently in convention publications. Official guests  Comic book conventions typically feature official guests or guests of honor. These guests are to some extent the headliners of the convention. A convention may have as many guests of honor as the convention committee wishes. A guest can be an industry figure ‚Äì some notable and frequently appearing examples of industry guests include Stan Lee, George P√©rez, and John Byrne. More and more, guests also can include film and television directors and actors, as more of these cultural products are based on comic books. Examples of this sort of guest, frequently seen on the convention circuit, include William Shatner, Bruce Campbell, and Norman Reedus. Comic conventions represent an opportunity for fans to interact with such individuals that may not be possible outside the event. Professionals at conventions Conventions provide a forum for fans to see first-hand and meet their favorite authors and artists. They also serve the interests of authors, editors, and other publishing professionals, providing opportunities for networking, promotion, and a convenient location for contract negotiations and other business meetings. A number of cons include a category for \\"Attending Professionals\\": professionals who pay a (possibly reduced) price to enter but also get a special name badge that proclaims them to be professionals in the field. In the early days of comic book conventions, there was little or no distinction made between the \\"pros\\" and the \\"fans.\\" (After all, many professionals in the field began as fans, and may still consider themselves fans; and more than a few fans have also worked professionally or semi- professionally in the field.) Nowadays, other than in the so-called \\"Artist Alleys,\\" there is more of a caste system among professionals and enthusiasts. = Artist Alley = Artist Alley is a fixture at most comic conventions. It is an area where creators display and sell their work (including original art), take commissions, sign autographs, and interact with fans. These areas may also include crafts, drawn art, self-published books or video, fanzines, and more. = Con suite = At North American conventions, a hospitality suite is often provided as a room reserved for light refreshments, a quiet conversation, and a place to briefly rest. The refreshments typically include coffee, tea, juice or soda, and light meals appropriate for the time of day. Depending on local liquor distribution and liability laws, the suite may serve alcohol. At conventions in the rest of the world, the hotel or convention center bar typically offers the same social function. At conventions in the United Kingdom, the provision of cask ale is generally considered essential.  Cosplay  Traditionally, conventions held a costume contest called a masquerade, where persons go on stage and compete for nominal prizes based on their skill in assembling and presenting genre-inspired outfits. This, however, would be more accurately labelled a \\"talent show\\" rather than the \\"fancy dress ball\\" that the term suggests (although British fandom sometimes uses the term \\"fancy dress\\"). From press coverage of comic book and anime conventions has arisen the widespread tendency of fans in general attendance at the con to dress up as their favorite characters in elaborate costumes (known as cosplay) that are time-consuming and/or expensive to assemble. = Weapons policies = At some conventions, attendees carry costume props that appear to be weapons. To forestall concerns about misuse of real weapons at such events, the security team \\"peace-bonds\\" anything that might look like a weapon.. (Peace-bonding is a conspicuous lock, tie, or mark which makes or identifies something unusable, such as a weapon, and shows that the owner's intentions are purely peaceful.) The event's \\"weapons policy\\" may offer objective criteria to determine what looks like a weapon. For example, a weapons policy may require a peace-bond for anything that a reasonable person might recognize as a weapon from a short distance in dim light. Real weapons, if allowed, are disabled, secured, and marked. For example, bright orange zip ties may be used to hold a sword in a scabbard or to hold a pistol in a holster. Simulated or costume props may require conspicuous marks, such as bright ribbons or zip ties, to show that security has deemed them safe to be carried. Simulated weapons or props which can be used as a weapon may be disabled or secured in the way as real weapons. Peace-bonding helps security control the use or abuse of real weapons at a convention or other event: anything that looks like a weapon but which is not peace-bonded is immediately deemed to be suspicious.  Programming  During panels at comic book conventions, the audience is sometimes invited to line up and ask questions using a dedicated microphone. Panel-led discussions, or Panels, usually fill up the daytime hours of most conventions with typically one-hour discussions involving some pre-determined topic, usually related in at least some way to comics. Panels usually come in two segments: the host puts on a presentation or does an interview with a guest, and then the fans are asked to give questions. The topic scope for panels is varied and can include things from new releases to author spotlights. There are also workshops, that are like panels but are more geared towards instructions through a major or specific task such as how to draw comics, or use industry-specific software. Another event at most comic book conventions include screenings of films and TV shows that can last through the day. Panel members (even professionals) are not customarily paid for their appearance, although many North-American conventions waive membership fees for program participants or rebate them after the convention. Special events Some conventions feature award ceremonies, in which the best works and most notable individuals are recognized for their contributions to the field. [See Awards, below] A convention may have one or more auctions. The Art Auction is an event where the most popular items from the art show are sold to the most interested buyers at the convention. Many conventions also have auctions for charities. Evening entertainment often includes a combination of official and unofficial events, including formal invitational dinners, and fandom-themed room parties. A few conventions and festivals have a closing ceremony to formally mark the end of the convention. Depending on the convention, this can be a major gathering of most of the membership, or it may be lightly attended or dispensed with entirely as members are occupied with packing up and checking out of the hotel. Exhibits and fixed functions An exhibit hall or dealers' room is a popular feature at comic book conventions. Publishing companies, distributors, and other proprietors often arrive to exhibit and/or sell their newest products to fans. Wares can include back issues of comic books, graphic novels & trade paperbacks, manga and anime media, action figures, apparel or pre-made costumes, music CDs, software, decorations, toys, art books, specialty foods, and many more. Many conventions have video rooms in which genre-related audiovisual presentations take place, typically commercial Hollywood movies, genre television show episodes, and anime. If there are multiple media rooms, each one may have themed content. Larger conventions may also have a genuine film room, for presentation of actual movies on film instead of video. Game rooms are also available at some conventions for attendees to play a variety of genre games, including collectible card games, role-playing games board games, and video games. Thematic Areas thumb Thematic areas are set up in the comics fairs where cosplayers and visitors can take photos in an environment that follows that of a specific comic, anime or video game or participate in various themed activities. These areas are set up by not for profit associations or sometimes by video game developers or Anime producers. Some examples of these areas are those dedicated to Star Wars, Fallout or to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Idiosyncrasy Many con-goers take pride in being interesting and unusual, and naturally many cons are highly idiosyncratic. Cons often have activities, running jokes, organizational methods, and other features that not only differentiate them from other cons but are often a point of pride. Most cons vary from the above outline in one or more important ways, and many have their own unique cultural characteristics. Most cons will tend to evolve many of their own idiosyncrasies along these lines. To fans, these are often part of the charm each convention offers.  Awards  Almost since their inception, comic book conventions have hosted comic awards. Two of the longest-running and most prestigious awards are the Eisner Award and the Harvey Award, both of which began in 1988 after the dissolution of the Kirby Awards. The Eisner Award has been presented at San Diego Comic-Con International since 1988; while the Harvey Awards, also inaugurated in 1988 and after being presented at many different venues for much of their life, have been presented at the Baltimore Comic-Con since 2006. The following is a list of conventions and the award presentations they host (or formerly hosted): Angoul√™me International Comics Festival (France) * Grand Prix de la ville d'Angoul√™me (1974‚Äìpresent) ‚Äì formerly known as the \\"Alfreds\\" (1974‚Äì1988) and \\"Alph-Art Awards\\" (Prix Alph- Art) (1989‚Äì2003). In addition, the Angoul√™me festival presents a number of other awards called \\"The Official Awards of the International Comics Festival\\" (le Palmar√®s Officiel du Festival international de la bande dessin√©e). from a pool of 40‚Äì60 albums, called \\"official selections.\\" From these are awarded the \\"Best Album\\" prize, five \\"Angoul√™me Essentials,\\" one \\"Revelation Essential\\" (given to new talent), and one Essential chosen by the public. The Heritage Essential (for reprinted material) and Youth Essential are selected from separate nominee pools.

It was the first U.S. city to host a convention (the 1964 \\"Tri-State Con\\"), but was poorly served for conventions from the late 1980s until the mid-to-late 1990s‚Äîdespite both major mainstream comic publishers, DC Comics and Marvel Comics, being headquartered in New York during that time. Presently, New York is flush with comic book conventions, with at least five annual shows being produced. The following is a timeline of New York City comic book conventions.  Timeline of British comic book conventions  England has hosted comic book conventions since 1968 (the British Comic Art Convention), but historically had trouble sustaining any one recurring show. As of 2020, however, England is host to two long-running, large annual conventions ‚Äî the MCM London Comic Con (est. 2002) and the London Film and Comic Con (est. 2004).

Marquardt was previously known for her screen-writing and directing of critically acclaimed short films. Her first full-length movie explored the emotional journey of a young female student who works as a sexual surrogate and falls in love with an unusually recalcitrant client. Certain aspects of Marquardt‚Äôs work have been contrasted to Ben Lewin's similarly themed feature film The Sessions that uses a diametrically opposite approach to the topic. Marquardt stated that she intended \\"not to write a love story, but an anti-love story.\\" Early life A child of German parents, Marquardt was born and raised in the divided city of Berlin, Germany. After completing her secondary school education, she enrolled in the interdisciplinary \\"Communication in Social and Economic Contexts\\" program at the Berlin University of the Arts. Marquardt started traveling extensively and lived for brief periods in Arizona, Granada, Strasbourg, and Laos. Career After graduating from the University of the Arts in Berlin, Marquardt spent a number of years working in film project development and production in Germany. Subsequently she worked in France as a commissioning Fiction editor for the Franco-German TV network ARTE. In 2007, Marquardt was accepted as a Dean's Fellow in the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University to pursue graduate studies in the Master of Fine Arts program. She led and collaborated on several short film projects as a writer, producer and director as well as in ancillary roles. Her short film \\"Thanksgiving\\", one of her earliest works, won the \\"best student short award\\" at the Cinequest Film Festival in 2009 and \\"best short film\\" at the 92YTribeca Showcase in 2010. A short documentary \\"Our Lady of Mercy\\" premiered in a screening at the Cannes Film Festival in 2009. Marquardt graduated from New York University with a MFA degree in 2013. Marquardt‚Äôs first full-length feature, the low-budget drama film She's Lost Control, was completed in 2014. The script was inspired by Marquardt's studies of Japanese caretaker robots who touch patients to make them feel calmer and the sex therapy concepts of Masters and Johnson. In the film, Marquardt explores the interactions and emotional stresses that arise in the triangle of a therapist, sexual surrogate and patient. The movie project was financed with seed funding from the German Consulate General in New York and through a Kickstarter campaign. It was executive-produced by award-winning director Oren Moverman. The film, which premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in Germany in 2014, won the Forum's section top award, the CICAE International Confederation of Art Cinemas Award. She's Lost Control had its premiere in the U.S. at the SXSW Film Festival and its initial screening in New York City at the New Directors/New Films Festival at the Film Society of Lincoln Center and MoMa, where the curators described it as a \\"stylish, deeply unnerving, and profound film on an intangible modern issue\\". The film was released to general audiences in the U.S. in March and in Germany in May, 2015. Awards In recognition of her prize-winning work in cinematography, Marquardt was awarded a prestigious Villa Aurora Fellowship in 2016. Filmography {  style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" ! B0C4DE;\\"  Year !

The original Georgian design was by architect John Nash and later remodelled by Inigo Thomas. History A view of part of the garden in 2004 The name predates the mansion and its Welsh name, Ffynnonau reflects the existence of a number of wells in the district. The Ffynone estate belonged at one time to the Morgan family of Blaenbwlan, from whom it was purchased by Captain Stephen Colby in 1752. The house, completed in 1799, was repaired in 1828 by W Hoare and Son of Lawrenny. In the 1830s the estate extended to 237 acres in Manordeifi parish with further lands in adjacent parishes. The parkland around the house was some 30 acres. There were many additions and improvements over future years to both house and estate. The property was passed down the Colby family to John Vaughan Colby, whose wife in 1902 commissioned architect and garden designer Inigo Thomas to remodel the house and lay out the terraced gardens, which was completed in 1907. John Vaughan died in 1919 and, having no sons, left the estate to his daughter Aline Margaret, who had married Captain Cecil John Herbert Spence-Jones, son of the Dean of Gloucester, in 1908; the marriage was a notable occasion, reported in great detail and an occasion for local celebration, despite there being no guests at the wedding and no reception owing to the bride's mother's state of health. Spence took the additional surname of Colby by royal licence in 1920 and subsequently sold the property in 1927 to a Glamorgan businessman. The house, in 20 acres of woodland, was bought and restored from 1988 onwards by Owen Lloyd George, 3rd Earl Lloyd- George of Dwyfor and his wife, who are credited with saving the house. After the death of the 3rd Earl in 2010 the house was put up for sale with an asking price of ¬£2.5 million. The estate records (to 1919) are held at the National Library of Wales. Architecture John Nash was commissioned to design the house in the early 1790s; construction work began in 1794 and was completed by 1799. Materials included locally quarried stone as well as from other parts of Britain. The house was laid out to a classical Georgian plan. 60,000 trees were sourced from John Mackie, a Norwich nursery man, and hundreds of tons of topsoil were brought in. Inigo Thomas, in contrast, remodelled the house in the style of an Italian palazzo. He added the east and west wings, creating a library, ornate dining room and music room with a cross vaulted tunnel roof. The mansion itself is a Grade I listed building, while a number of elements on the estate are listed Grade I, II* or II.

","title":"A Celebration of Harry Potter"},{"id":"49280879","text":"The 2016 PSOE crisis was a political conflict within the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), starting on 26 September 2016. Long-standing discontent with party Secretary General Pedro S√°nchez and the combination of a series of circumstances resulted in a party revolt to force S√°nchez's dismissal on 28 September, in an episode lasting until 1 October colloquially dubbed by some media and journalists as the \\"war of the roses\\". The ensuing power vacuum and S√°nchez's replacement by an interim managing committee, coupled with the party's turn to allow a PP minority government after a 10-month deadlock on government formation and the resulting worsening of relations with its sister party in Catalonia, the PSC, triggered a crisis of a scale unprecedented in the party's 137 years of existence. Andalusian President Susana D√≠az had been long considered the most prominent critic of Pedro S√°nchez and a potential contender for the party's leadership, being the leader of the largest and most important PSOE regional branch and, for years, the only person within the party holding an institutional position of importance. Ever since S√°nchez's election as Secretary General‚Äîhelped by D√≠az's own manoeuvres to hold off Eduardo Madina‚Äîboth leaders had developed an increasing distrust and rivalry between the two of them for the party's leadership and political strategy. After the 20 December 2015 and 26 June 2016 general elections had resulted in the worst electoral results for the PSOE in recent history, pressure on S√°nchez increased. His record as party leader had alienated many of his former allies and pushed them towards D√≠az's sphere. The immediate trigger to the crisis was the poor PSOE showing in the Basque and Galician elections, which led critics to call for S√°nchez's resignation. S√°nchez held out, and responded by announcing a party primary and congress for October‚ÄìDecember, enraging dissenters and prompting half the members of the party executive committee‚Äîthe party's day-to-day ruling body‚Äîto resign on 28 September, to trigger S√°nchez's removal and take command themselves. S√°nchez, instead, refused to step down and entrenched himself within the party's headquarters, generating the largest crisis in the party's history, as neither side acknowledged the legitimacy of the other to act in the party's name. This situation ended when S√°nchez resigned after losing a key ballot in the party's federal committee on 1 October, being replaced by a caretaker committee and leaving behind a shattered PSOE. Some predicted that this set of events was to help pave the way for the party to abstain in a hypothetical Rajoy's investiture, something which was confirmed on 23 October when the party's federal committee chose to backflip and allow the formation of a new PP government in order to prevent a third election from happening. PSC leader Miquel Iceta announced his party‚Äîassociated to PSOE since 1978‚Äîwould not abide by the committee's decision and would break party discipline by voting against Rajoy nonetheless, with PSOE leaders warning that failure to comply with the committee's decision would result in a \\"review of their relationship\\", implying that the schism could lead to a break up between both parties. Background Pedro S√°nchez, a member of the PSOE unknown to the public and much of the party membership, succeeded Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba as Secretary General of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party in 26 July 2014 party extraordinary congress, having won a leadership election held earlier that month with 48.7% of the membership vote to Eduardo Madina's 36.2%. Andalusia President Susana D√≠az's support for S√°nchez to hold off Madina was a determining factor in S√°nchez's victory, as the party's Andalusian membership voted overwhelmingly in favour of S√°nchez. Madina's move to trigger a primary election forced D√≠az‚Äîwho was said to be seeking an election by acclamation‚Äîout of the leadership race, prompting her to support S√°nchez in order to prevent a potential Madina victory. However, the alliance between S√°nchez and D√≠az was short-lived. D√≠az reportedly intended to become the PSOE candidate for the 2015 general election, putting her support behind S√°nchez's election in exchange for S√°nchez later paving the way for her arrival. However, S√°nchez's own political aspirations, coupled with his perceived failure to cope successfully with the newly founded Podemos party's growth in opinion polls, as well as personal differences, caused both leaders to grow increasingly distrustful of each other. Susana D√≠az took advantage of growing criticism of S√°nchez's behaviour among party members, seeking to sway their views in her favour and increase her strength in terms of the growing rivalry between the two. Such was the criticism of S√°nchez within the party that it succeeded in causing prominent PSOE members and former rivals such as Eduardo Madina and Susana D√≠az, Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba and Carme Chac√≥n, Felipe Gonz√°lez and Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, as well as six out of the seven PSOE regional presidents, to abandon their long-standing feuds and unite against S√°nchez. Government formation The 2015 general election had resulted in the most-fragmented parliament in decades, and the PSOE obtaining its worst election result since the Spanish transition to democracy, with 90 seats and 22.0% of the vote. Podemos and its allies together garnered 69 seats and 20.7%, fairly close to PSOE and threatening the party's hegemony as the main leftist political force in Spain. Under these circumstances, Pedro S√°nchez came under criticism for the poor results, as well as for his handling of the post-election situation. Then-acting Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and C's leader Albert Rivera both suggested a grand coalition between their parties and PSOE, but this proposal met with opposition from S√°nchez, who preferred to study alternative pacts. Pablo Iglesias of Podemos laid out stiff terms to even consider starting negotiations for a coalition with the PSOE, whereas Susana D√≠az warned S√°nchez that the party's position on coalition deals had to be decided \\"within a federal committee and not by the Secretary General\\", in a move seen as an attempt to limit S√°nchez's autonomy in pact-management. A party federal committee‚Äîthe highest party decision-making body between congresses‚Äîwas held on 28 December, outlining the PSOE's pact policy, including an express rejection of any pact with PP, or negotiations with parties that supported self-determination‚ÄîCatalan separatist parties, ERC and DL, but also Podemos, which had supported a referendum on independence for Catalonia as an election pledge. S√°nchez's critics did not hide their desire for S√°nchez to be replaced by someone else at the next party congress, due for February, to which S√°nchez responded by suggesting a postponement of the congress until after the formation of a government. The idea met with strong opposition from critics, who publicly proclaimed that the congress should be held \\"when it is due\\". Susana D√≠az was said to be seeking to replace S√°nchez as PSOE leader herself and eventually lead the party into a new general election, securing the support of several party factions which deemed S√°nchez's leadership too weak and unreliable in the event of a new general election being held. Valencian President Ximo Puig said during an interview that \\"if a new election is held, the PSOE must consider a change of candidate\\" while Castile-La Mancha President Emiliano Garc√≠a-Page commented that \\"no one disputes the ability of Susana Diaz to be Prime Minister\\". Debate over the date for the party congress focused on two clashing positions: that of the party's leadership, headed by S√°nchez, who wished the congress to be held in June, and that of S√°nchez's dissenters, who favoured it being held as early as April. The result was a victory for the critics' position during another federal committee held on 30 January, where the dates for both the party primary and congress were set for May. This meant that the leadership contest would be over in time for the event of a snap general election, which would not be held until June at the least. However, after Pedro S√°nchez announced he would allow party members to vote on any deal he reached with other parties, the Committee allowed Pedro S√°nchez to try to reach an agreement to be appointed Prime Minister, as long as he respected the agreed pact-making red lines. Party sources indicated the high likelihood of Susana D√≠az's candidacy if S√°nchez failed in his attempt at becoming Prime Minister. On 1 February, leaked recordings from the party's federal committee held two days earlier revealed Susana D√≠az openly questioning Pedro S√°nchez's performance throughout the month after the general election. She, alongside other regional party leaders, highlighted the party's red lines for negotiation and argued strongly against any possibility of an agreement with Podemos, intending to hamper S√°nchez's chances of becoming Prime Minister. After S√°nchez's two failed investiture votes, sources reported Susana D√≠az as being determined to challenge S√°nchez for the party's leadership, but viewing as undesirable the prospect of an attempt to open the issue of the PSOE succession amid government formation negotiations and with a new election looming for 26 June. Now seeking to postpone the congress, on 28 March it was decided that the PSOE leadership race should be delayed \\"indefinitely\\" \\"until the formation of a new government\\". Leadership crisis Timeline =Lead up to events= For months, the internal situation within the PSOE remained at a standstill. Criticism of S√°nchez by party dissenters for his hardline stance on Rajoy's investiture, said to be a contributing factor to the country's political deadlock, had been kept at bay by the party's performance in the 2016 general election, with threats from S√°nchez's critics to hold him to account for a hypothetical party collapse on 26 June narrowly failing to materialize. This all changed in the run-up to the Basque and Galician regional elections, scheduled for late September 2016. The PSOE branches in both regions were widely seen as being among S√°nchez's supporters, prompting dissenters to frame the elections as a test of S√°nchez and of the broader political mood in Spain after nine months of political impasse. Party figures such as regional premiers Susana D√≠az (Andalusia), Guillermo Fern√°ndez Vara (Extremadura), Javier Lamb√°n (Aragon) and Emiliano Garc√≠a-Page (Castile-La Mancha); as well as former figures such as Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba (S√°nchez's predecessor as PSOE leader), Eduardo Madina (S√°nchez's rival in the party's 2014 leadership contest), Elena Valenciano (former PSOE deputy leader) and Carme Chac√≥n (former Defence Minister), all became involved in a series of disputes with the national party leadership in the weeks leading up to the regional elections, weakening S√°nchez's standing and indicating a loss of support within the party. =26‚Äì27 September= The poor PSOE showing in both Galicia and the Basque Country, being overtaken by Podemos-led alliances and polling record low results, prompted dissenters‚Äîled by Susana D√≠az‚Äîto call for S√°nchez's immediate resignation on 26 September. S√°nchez refused to step down and announced his plan to hold a party primary election on 23 October, daring his critics to challenge him in a back-me-or- sack-me vote. This move further enraged his opponents, who considered staging a revolt in the federal committee scheduled for 1 October, seeking to topple S√°nchez and cancel his plan to hold an early party congress. With party discipline breaking down rapidly, S√°nchez's supporters praised his plan to hold an \\"express\\" party primary and called for \\"all out war!\\" against dissenters, suggesting that the S√°nchez‚ÄìD√≠az feud over leadership and political strategy had resulted in a deeply divided party fighting for its very existence. On 27 September, in her first public statements after S√°nchez's gamble, Susana D√≠az hinted at the possibility of becoming leader of the PSOE, expressing her discomfort with S√°nchez's plan to hold a party primary and congress in October while reminding the incumbent PSOE leader of his many electoral defeats throughout his tenure, in contrast to D√≠az's own electoral performance in the 2015 Andalusian regional election. Concurrently, a majority within the party's parliamentary group in the Congress of Deputies voiced their opposition to S√°nchez's plans to hold a party congress. =28 September= Former Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonz√°lez added to the pressure on S√°nchez by declaring that the PSOE was in no condition to attempt to form a government themselves, while stating that he felt \\"cheated\\" because S√°nchez had told him on 29 June that he would abstain in the second round of voting for Rajoy's investiture. S√°nchez's statements during an interview held earlier in the day claiming Gonz√°lez to be \\"on the [Rajoy's investiture] abstention side\\" and rhetorically asking \\"I'd like to know on which side Susana D√≠az is\\", coupled with an earlier warning that he would not step down even if 1 October federal committee voted down his plans for a party congress in late 2016, were said to be the straw that broke the camel's back for open revolution to unfold within the party. News emerged that opponents of S√°nchez planned to stage a mass resignation from the PSOE federal executive committee, the party's day-to-day governing body‚Äîaccording to party rules, the resignation or vacancy of 51% of its members would force the Secretary General to resign. Upon learning of this, Pedro S√°nchez went further and dared them to do so if they \\"did not feel committed\\" to his project, prompting dissenters to act ahead of schedule and resulting in 17 executive members, the required majority, resigning from their posts on 28 September. This triggered the body's dissolution, theoretically prompting S√°nchez's resignation. {  center; font-size:90%\\" - ! colspan=\\"2\\"  The 17 resigning executive members -  Micaela Navarro  President; 2nd Vice President of the Congress of Deputies -  Antonio Pradas  Secretary for Federal Policy -  Mar√≠a Jos√© S√°nchez Rubio  Secretary for Health -  Estefan√≠a Mart√≠n Palop  Secretary for Training -  Noem√≠ Cruz  Secretary for Development Cooperation -  Francisco Pizarro  At-large member -  Juan Pablo Dur√°n  Federal executive member -  Emiliano Garc√≠a-Page  At- large member; President of Castile-La Mancha -  Manuela Galiano  Secretary for Small Municipalities -  Luz Rodr√≠guez  Secretary for Labour -  Ximo Puig  Secretary for Democratic Reforms; President of the Valencian Government -  Tom√°s G√≥mez Franco  At-large member -  Eva Matar√≠n  Secretary for Immigration -  Carme Chac√≥n  Secretary for International Relations; former Minister of Defence -  Jos√© Miguel P√©rez  Secretary for Education -  Carlos P√©rez Anad√≥n  At-large member -  Mar√≠a Ascensi√≥n Murillo  At-large member } S√°nchez, however, refused to resign and remained in his position, with rebels responding that S√°nchez no longer had \\"any legitimacy to take decisions in the party's name\\" and urging him to \\"acknowledge party rules\\". S√°nchez was determined to keep the remaining executive functioning‚Äînow fully supportive of him after the critics' resignations‚Äîand rejected its dissolution, summoning it for an emergency meeting on the following day. =29 September= By the next day, the PSOE had descended further into chaos, as both sides refused to recognize the other's legitimacy to act and clashed on the interpretation of party rules, with S√°nchez barricading himself in the party's headquarters in Calle de Ferraz (Spanish for Ferraz street), Madrid, as his supporters accused dissenters of \\"staging a coup\\". Critics proclaimed that they were now in control of the party, and Ver√≥nica P√©rez, President of the federal committee and pupil of Susana D√≠az, claimed herself to be \\"the only authority that exists in the PSOE, whether [S√°nchez's supporters] like it or not\\" under party rules. Dissenters sought to convene the party's guarantees federal commission‚Äîan independent body tasked with resolving disputes within the party‚Äîto forcibly depose S√°nchez, but S√°nchez's supporters argued that they had no right to summon the guarantees commission and that their actions were \\"void\\". Nonetheless, three of the five commission members demanded that the body be convened and accused S√°nchez of \\"preventing them from acting\\", stating they would issue a dictum themselves if the body was not convened within 24 hours. S√°nchez persisted with his intention to stage a primary and congress, and set a timetable with hastened deadlines for them to be held. Party members found themselves evenly split between those that supported him and were \\"deeply embarrassed\\" by the \\"show\\" being staged by his opponents, and those that demanded S√°nchez's removal and the establishment of a caretaker committee to replace him in the interim. The fracture deepened as the crisis spread through the regions, with regional party branches picking sides either for or against S√°nchez. Susana D√≠az, in her first public speech after the revolt, criticized S√°nchez's record as party leader, accusing him of being motivated \\"out of personal interest\\" and offering herself to reconcile the party. D√≠az would seek instead to have the party congress be held \\"in due time\\", only after the political deadlock in Spain had been solved. =30 September= On 30 September, both sides were reportedly readying themselves for the meeting of the PSOE's 295-member federal committee scheduled for Saturday, 1 October. While the meeting of top party officials was initially expected to analyze the regional election results and to discuss and update the party's position on any future investiture, new developments had made the meeting key to determining the party's short-term future. The crippled PSOE executive committee under S√°nchez had convened the previous day to call a new federal committee for the same day and time as initially scheduled, now with the intention of approving S√°nchez's plan to hold an extraordinary congress to renew the party's leadership. Critics declared the new convention \\"illegal\\", instead only recognizing the meeting called for that date by the fully functional executive before the revolt. This meant that the two factions intended to hold two separate meetings, but at the same time and place. Meanwhile, 'officialists' supportive of S√°nchez struggled to keep control over the parliamentary party in the Congress of Deputies, with just half the 84 PSOE deputies remaining loyal to S√°nchez and the rest siding with the rebels. Also, for the first time since the mass resignation from the federal executive committee, S√°nchez's supporters acknowledged their status as an \\"interim\\" PSOE executive. Attempts from both sides to reach some sort of compromise to prevent all out war from raging at the next day's federal committee failed, with the two factions' positions seemingly irreconcilable in the short term. Police intervention was required ahead of Saturday's meeting to deal with possible unrest between party members in the area around the Madrid headquarters as the interim leadership pleaded with party supporters for \\"serenity\\" and \\"prudence\\" to prevent the conflict from escalating further. After S√°nchez chose not to convene the guarantees commission until after the federal committee, the three S√°nchez critics on the commission issued a report endorsing the executive committee's dissolution and calling for the federal committee to fill the power vacuum. They also deemed that party rules did not provide for the \\"interim\\" status that S√°nchez's executive had conferred upon itself, with any decision adopted in such circumstances being \\"completely without any statutory validity and null and void\\". Pedro S√°nchez immediately held a press conference‚Äîhis first since the crisis started‚Äîand challenged dissenters to vote on the party's position on a future Rajoy investiture vote, promising to step down if the federal committee decided to support an abstention. However, S√°nchez's critics were undeterred, retaining their plan to depose S√°nchez in Saturday's meeting nonetheless. =1 October= The two factions vying for control of PSOE faced the federal committee with no prospect of reconciliation and with diametrically opposing views. Pedro S√°nchez's officialists sought to retain control of the leadership until a congress to be held soon thereafter. Critics under Susana D√≠az intended to take full control of the party by deposing S√°nchez in the party assembly and appointing a caretaker team‚Äîexpected to be headed by D√≠az's close ally Javier Fern√°ndez, Asturian President‚Äîthat would deal with the political consequences of allowing a PP government. The party would then take time to hold a \\"refoundation congress\\" and a party primary which D√≠az would contest unopposed. The party was said to be at the brink of splitting into two if no peaceful solution to the conflict could be found quickly. Initially scheduled to begin at 9:00 CEST, disagreements between the two factions over the meeting's agenda and voting census delayed the start of the federal committee meeting by several hours. Seeking to gain time, S√°nchez proposed readmitting the 17 executive members who had resigned three days previously and calling the committee to convene the next week, but the rebels rejected this, declaring that they did not recognize him as party leader and describing S√°nchez's move as \\"insulting\\". S√°nchez repeatedly blocked D√≠az's attempts to vote on his position as the two sides failed to agree on the purpose of the committee. In the meantime, the ongoing turmoil attracted hundreds of journalists, policemen, party members and curious observers, who gathered outside the party's headquarters throughout the day. S√°nchez tried to force a secret ballot on his proposal for a party congress, but it was suspended after critics claimed the ballot box was \\"hidden\\" and unsupervised, accusing S√°nchez of vote rigging. This action was said to have cost S√°nchez support among his allies and prompted rebels to start procedures to trigger a censure motion against him. This was rejected by S√°nchez's supporters controlling the assembly, despite the rebels collecting the signatures of more than half of committee members‚Äîthus ensuring S√°nchez would have been ousted had the vote been allowed. Amid the turmoil, some people, including Susana D√≠az herself, were reported to have broken down in tears, while S√°nchez's supporters denounced an attempted assault on Pedro S√°nchez by D√≠az's deputy, Juan Cornejo. An agreement was finally reached between the two factions to vote again on S√°nchez's congress proposal‚Äîthis time by a show of hands‚Äîlinking the outcome of the vote to S√°nchez remaining in his post. Pedro S√°nchez lost the ballot by 132 to 107, prompting him to resign as PSOE leader. Following the vote, S√°nchez's critics appointed a caretaker commission to lead the party temporarily until a party congress could be held. It was implied that the events of this day may help pave the way for the formation of a new government and put an end to nine months of political deadlock, as the rebels considered an abstention in a potential forthcoming vote on Rajoy's investiture. { class =\\"\\" - ! width=\\"100\\" Faction ! width=\\"100\\" Portrait ! width=\\"150\\" Leader ! width=\\"150\\" Born ! width=\\"250\\" Most recent position ! width=\\"150\\" Party support ! width=\\"50\\" Share -  center;\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Critics  rowspan=\\"2\\" 100px  rowspan=\\"2\\" Susana D√≠az  (age )  Secretary General of the PSOE‚ÄìA; President of the Regional Government of Andalusia (2013‚Äìpresent)  rowspan=\\"2\\"  center;\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  center;\\" 52.17% -  colspan=\\"2\\" -  center;\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\" Officialists  rowspan=\\"2\\" 100px  rowspan=\\"2\\" Pedro S√°nchez  (age )  Secretary General of the PSOE; Leader of the Opposition (2014‚Äì2016)  rowspan=\\"2\\"  center;\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  center;\\" 42.29% -  colspan=\\"2\\" - style=\\"background- color:  colspan=\\"5\\"  center;\\" Undeclared  style=\\"text- align: center;\\" 14   center;\\" 5.53% } Reactions Members from the People's Party refused to get involved in the PSOE crisis and said they would not \\"comment on other parties' issues\\", just calling for the party to \\"solve its problems soon\\" so it could put an end to the political deadlock. Nonetheless, PP leaders were said to be \\"incredulous\\" and \\"concerned\\" with \\"all that was happening within PSOE\\", worried at the prospect of a party fracture that would leave Podemos as the dominant leftist force in Spanish politics. Foreign Minister Jos√© Manuel Garc√≠a-Margallo said that PSOE's situation was \\"schizophrenic\\" and that the party could not \\"afford for a new general election to be held at this time\\". In contrast, Podemos leaders openly accused PSOE rebels of committing \\"fraud\\" by attempting to remove S√°nchez through \\"undemocratic means\\", with the ultimate goal of ending the deadlock by helping Rajoy to get re-elected. Podemos' Secretary General Pablo Iglesias described the PSOE's turmoil as \\"the most important crisis since the end of the Civil War, in the most important Spanish party of the past century\\". Leaders from Citizens commented that the PSOE had to \\"take this opportunity\\" to \\"allow for a PP government checked from opposition\\". S√°nchez's supporters gathered at the PSPV headquarters in Valencia on 29 September to denounce Ximo Puig's support in the revolt against the PSOE leader, with chants of \\"Coup plotters out from the Socialist Party!\\" and \\"Ximo liar\\" being heard. The PSC announced its support for S√°nchez by planning to bring buses from Terrassa and other towns in Catalonia to Madrid in a show of their allegiance to the Secretary General, but this was later suspended after S√°nchez's executive appealed to party members' serenity to prevent conflict from escalating further. Nonetheless, party members who gathered outside PSOE's headquarters in Madrid shouted at critics attending the meeting by calling them \\"traitors\\" and \\"coup plotters\\", as chants against Susana D√≠az and in support of Pedro S√°nchez were heard. Reactions to Pedro S√°nchez's resignation were mixed. Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias commented that \\"supporters of a PP government have imposed themselves on PSOE\\" and called for opponents of the coup to rally behind Podemos as the only remaining leftist alternative in Spain to a Rajoy government. C's leader Albert Rivera praised Susana D√≠az's move and called for the PSOE to \\"help form a government\\". S√°nchez's ouster was reported as being \\"the most turbulent event\\" in the party's history, with some regarding the whole event as \\"shameful\\". Od√≥n Elorza, former San Sebasti√°n mayor and one of those present at the federal committee, stated that party colleagues had become \\"hopelessly crazy\\" and accused them of \\"killing the party\\". Some remarked that the party had emerged \\"fatally shattered\\", with the assembly \\"ending in the worst way possible\\". Others commented that PSOE had chosen to \\"commit suicide\\" after the \\"sorry spectacle\\" it had offered, with PSOE member and former minister Javier Solana commenting of S√°nchez's poor election results‚Äîcited as one of the motives behind his ejection‚Äîthat \\"when they become aware of the damages, they will all prefer 85 deputies\\". Former minister and S√°nchez ally Jordi Sevilla said he was leaving the party because he felt \\"deeply embarrassed\\" at the whole event. ;Pranks Shortly after Pedro S√°nchez had been sacked as party leader by the federal committee, while its members were appointing a caretaker team to replace him in the interim, the PSOE was the subject of a prank consisting of a massive pizza delivery. Forum members from both the ForoCoches and La Retaguardia websites had allegedly paid for the prank, with the latter posting a bill for ‚Ç¨117 for the delivery on their Twitter account. More pranks were staged over the following days, with several mariachi bands congregating at Ferraz's door to play songs caricaturing the figures of Pedro S√°nchez and Susana D√≠az. Struggle for opposition leadership With the rebel faction taking over the party, political relations with Podemos became strained. Susana D√≠az's opposition to any kind of pact with Iglesias' party was widely known, and she had blamed Podemos for the eruption of the PSOE crisis. However, D√≠az's actions to have her former protege removed‚Äîthrough what was dubbed by some as a \\"palace coup\\"‚Äîcaused a lot of damage to her public reputation, while leaving the party at the mercy of Mariano Rajoy, who subsequently began to push for conditions in exchange for avoiding a third general election. After being ousted, Pedro S√°nchez hinted at the possibility of standing in the forthcoming party primaries, indicating that the battle for the party's leadership was not over. On 7 October 2016 Pablo Iglesias of Podemos proclaimed himself to be the new Leader of the Opposition, on the basis of his party's strength in Congress‚Äî67 seats to PSOE's 84‚Äîand his claim that the now leaderless PSOE was poised to become PP's parliamentary partner by abstaining and facilitating PP rule. Subsequent events U-turn on investiture Javier Fern√°ndez was appointed to chair the interim managing body that would lead the party in the following months. While stating in a press conference on 3 October that the party remained opposed both to an abstention and a third election, he accepted that one of the two outcomes had to materialize eventually and asserted that \\"abstaining does not mean supporting Rajoy\\". However, he acknowledged that such a decision was a matter for a new federal committee and not his caretaker team. Ximo Puig, one of the most prominent critics of Pedro S√°nchez and a key figure in his sacking, argued against any PSOE facilitation of a Rajoy government and maintained the party should maintain its previous 'no' stance. Susana D√≠az, leader of the party rebellion and favourite to be picked as PSOE's new secretary general in the forthcoming congress, refused to reveal her stance on Rajoy's investiture and called for \\"leaving the [caretaker] committee to act\\", lamenting the \\"international spectacle\\" of \\"Saturday's federal committee\\". Fern√°ndez was aware that a revolt could break out within the party's parliamentary group if the decision‚Äînot planned to be submitted to the party's membership‚Äîto let Rajoy rule was taken. Substantial tension arose between the different factions within the parliamentary party as the Socialists' Party of Catalonia (PSC)‚ÄîPSOE sister party in Catalonia‚Äîannounced its 7 MPs would vote against Rajoy regardless of PSOE's final stance. Fern√°ndez replied to PSC's threat by maintaining that the party would not allow its deputies to break party discipline and vote in conscience, while deeming a new election as \\"the worst solution\\" for both PSOE and the country. A growing number of PSOE deputies followed the PSC line, refusing to be held accountable for the establishment of a new PP government. This included the Socialist Balearic, Basque and Cantabrian branches, as well as numerous deputies still loyal to former secretary general Pedro S√°nchez‚Äîand S√°nchez himself, who still kept his seat in Congress. Hoping to reduce the risk of a breakdown in party discipline during the vote for Rajoy's investiture, some PSOE members laid out an alternative plan that called for eleven deputies to either abstain or be absent during the vote, ensuring Rajoy would get elected if he could maintain the parliamentary support obtained during his first investiture attempt. Susana D√≠az's PSOE‚ÄìA rejected this manoeuvre and called for all deputies to keep party unity and respect the decision taken in a new federal committee scheduled for 23 October. D√≠az's deputy, Juan Cornejo, suggested that MPs refusing to \\"abide by the federal committee's decision\\"‚Äîin the eventuality an abstention to Rajoy was decided‚Äîshould resign their seats. Opinion polls conducted after the party crisis showed plummeting support for PSOE, with advocates of abstention arguing that it was no longer Rajoy's post under discussion, but whether he would be elected now or after a third election, expected to result in a landslide win for the PP. Members of the party's caretaker leadership were convinced they would be able to push the abstention choice through in the party's federal committee, but remained afraid this move would likely widen the rift opened within the party. At a meeting of the parliamentary party on 18 October, a majority of PSOE MPs expressed their support for abstention, while calling for \\"dedramatizing\\" this choice, but a faction of the party's group remained opposed. In a new convening of the PSOE federal committee on 23 October the party chose by a vote of 139 to 96 to unconditionally allow a Rajoy minority government through an abstention once Congress considered Rajoy's candidacy for a second time. However, party members clashed on how this decision was to materialize in terms of party discipline after some deputies declared they would not abide by the committee's decision regardless the outcome, with critics to the caretaker commission demanding for the party to allow them to vote in conscience. Javier Fern√°ndez, however, rejected this notion and confirmed the PSOE would abstain wholly with each deputy abstaining \\"literally\\". PSOE‚ÄìPSC rupture When PSOE voted to abstain in the second round of Rajoy's investiture and allow the formation of a PP minority government, most opponents of this decision agreed to respect the majority opinion within the party and maintain party discipline. However, some deputies declared that they intended to vote against Rajoy nonetheless, even in the face of threats of retaliation from the party. Among these were Aragonese Susana Sumelzo, Basque Odon Elorza, independent for Madrid Margarita Robles, as well as the likely opposition of Galician Roc√≠o de Frutos and the two Balearic Islands MPs. MP for New Canaries Pedro Quevedo‚Äîwith whom PSOE had agreed an electoral alliance in the Canary Islands for the 2015 and 2016 elections‚Äîalso announced his intention to vote against Rajoy. Pedro S√°nchez's final stance on such a vote remained unclear, with some sources suggesting he would break the party line and others that he would not attend the investiture, in order to avoid having to abstain. However, the most serious rebellion to the party's directive came from the Socialists' Party of Catalonia, with PSC leader Miquel Iceta signalling his intention to disregard the committee's decision to abstain and maintain a 'no' stance. Members from the party's governing committee stressed that the decision taken by the party's federal committee was binding for all MPs and that if PSC chose to vote otherwise, the relationship between the two parties would have to be reviewed. Some interpreted this to mean that public disobedience from the PSC could result in its expulsion from the parliamentary group as well as from PSOE's governing bodies, and even lead to the end of the alliance between the parties, in place since 1978. Eight regional party branches critical of the abstention called on Fern√°ndez to authorize only eleven MPs to abstain‚Äîthe minimum number required for Rajoy's investiture vote to pass‚Äîso as to prevent further splits, but he replied that the federal committee's decision was final and that a \\"minimum abstention\\" of this kind was not up for discussion. By late 24 October, the party's interim leadership predicted that about 15 deputies would rebel and threatened them with outright expulsion from the party, into the unaffiliated grouping in Congress. However, this move backfired when a further group of MPs, opposed to abstention but initially willing to follow the party line, condemned any retaliation against conscience voters and expressed their willingness to join the rebel faction in solidarity with the PSC. By 25 October, with a new investiture hearing scheduled for 26‚Äì29 October, a total of 18 deputies were said to be willing to break the party line regardless of the consequences, and a further three were considering it \\"because of the threats issued by the managing committee's spokespeople\\"; the expulsion of all these MPs would have left Unidos Podemos as the largest opposition group in Congress. Later that day, the PSC leadership formally agreed on their 'no' position, appealing to PSOE \\"to accept differences and manage discrepancies\\" and calling for both parties to \\"keep walking together\\" as Iceta sought to prevent the split, but PSOE replied that this decision represented a \\"unilateral breach\\" of the relationship between the parties. On 28 October, it was reported that the PSC was exploring the possibility of contesting the next Catalan regional election in alliance with Ada Colau's En Com√∫ Podem, Podemos' \\"confluence\\" alliance in Catalonia. In response, the PSOE started proceedings for the expulsion of the PSC from its governing bodies, and a review of their relationship, to be triggered after Rajoy's investiture. Rajoy's investiture and consequences The second Mariano Rajoy's investiture session started on 26 October at 18:00 UTC. Antonio Hernando, PSOE's spokesperson in Congress and speaking on behalf of the party after S√°nchez's dismissal, justified their impending abstention by citing the country's need for a government after months of deadlock. Hernando reiterated that his party still did not trust Rajoy, promising to provide a strong opposition to his policies regardless. Hernando's speech did not convince neither those unwilling to abstain nor Pedro S√°nchez himself, who hours before the second and final round of voting announced his resignation as an MP‚Äîto avoid either abstaining and break his own electoral pledges or setting a bad precedent of a former PSOE leader breaking party discipline‚Äîwhile hinting at the possibility of standing in a future party leadership election. Finally, 15 PSOE MPs chose to break the party line and vote against Rajoy in spite of the possible consequences threatened by the party's interim leadership. Right after government formation, in an exclusive interview for laSexta's Salvados news show, Pedro S√°nchez publicly accused his party's apparatus‚Äîled by Susana D√≠az‚Äîand \\"financial powers\\", including El Pa√≠s media outlet, of having coerced him into avoiding a left-wing pact with Podemos and nationalist parties throughout the entire government formation process, revealing they triggered the internal revolt within PSOE to oust him once he considered a serious attempt at forming such a government and after repeatedly opposing to allow a PP government to form. Throughout the ensuing weeks, the party proceeded to marginalize and \\"punish\\" critics in a number of ways. As an immediate consequence, disciplinary procedures were filed against those MPs breaking vote discipline, expected to lead to fines up to ‚Ç¨600. Subsequently, a reorganization of the parliamentary group resulted in most rebels being either expelled from the party's parliamentary leadership or degraded in the different parliamentary committees. This affected even some MPs respecting the party line‚Äîdeputies but also senators, who had no vote in the investiture‚Äîthat, nonetheless, were critical of the managing committee's direction. This move further aggravated internal differences, being dubbed by those affected as \\"a shame\\", \\"revenge\\" and \\"marginalization\\" for \\"staying loyal to S√°nchez until the end\\". Meanwhile, the crisis with the PSC remained severe. Members from both parties favoured avoiding a total break up, but PSOE leaders strongly argued for \\"reviewing\\" their mutual relationship protocol, in effect since 1978. As both parties set themselves a timetable of two months to review their alliance, the PSOE's managing committee reportedly started preparations to exclude the PSC from the incoming PSOE Federal Congress.

The bridge is long and wide and carries Township Road 43 over Bullard Creek. It is built of angle sections riveted together, as recommended in the engineering textbook The Design of Highway Bridges published in 1908. During this time, the state government was attempting to standardize design and construction of bridges by financial incentives, rather than proposing legislation. The county commissioners of Goodhue County decided in late 1907 to build a bridge over Bullard Creek, but they were dissatisfied with the first round of bids. In the spring of 1908, Louis P. Wolff proposed a bridge that would comply with Minnesota Highway Commission rules and regulations. By building a bridge that complied with the rules, the state would subsidize the cost of the bridge through road and bridge appropriations. The county commissioners approved of these ideas and paid Wolff $100 for the plans and blueprints. William P. Glardon from Red Wing, Minnesota was the contractor, and the Minneapolis Steel & Machinery Company fabricated the steel. The bridge is listed on the Iron and Steel Bridges in Minnesota Multiple Property Submission.
