Protolith was a Proterozoic-Early Paleozoic upper mantle dunite peridotite that has been multiply metamorphosed during the Devonian, Permian, and Mesozoic. Tightly folded serpentinite from the Tux Alps, Austria. Closeup view about 30cm × 20cm. Serpentinite is a rock composed of one or more serpentine group minerals, the name originating from the similarity of the texture of the rock to that of the skin of a snake. Minerals in this group, which are rich in magnesium and water, light to dark green, greasy looking and slippery feeling, are formed by serpentinization, a hydration and metamorphic transformation of ultramafic rock from the Earth's mantle. The mineral alteration is particularly important at the sea floor at tectonic plate boundaries. == Formation and petrology == Serpentinization is a geological low-temperature metamorphic process involving heat and water in which low- silica mafic and ultramafic rocks are oxidized (anaerobic oxidation of Fe2+ by the protons of water leading to the formation of H2) and hydrolyzed with water into serpentinite. Peridotite, including dunite, at and near the seafloor and in mountain belts is converted to serpentine, brucite, magnetite, and other minerals – some rare, such as awaruite (Ni3Fe), and even native iron. In the process large amounts of water are absorbed into the rock increasing the volume, reducing the density and destroying the structure.Serpentinization: The heat engine at Lost City and sponge of the oceanic crust The density changes from 3.3 to 2.7 g/cm3 with a concurrent volume increase on the order of 30-40%. The reaction is highly exothermic and rock temperatures can be raised by about , providing an energy source for formation of non-volcanic hydrothermal vents. The magnetite-forming chemical reactions produce hydrogen gas under anaerobic conditions prevailing deep in the mantle, far from the Earth's atmosphere. Carbonates and sulfates are subsequently reduced by hydrogen and form methane and hydrogen sulfide. The hydrogen, methane, and hydrogen sulfide provide energy sources for deep sea chemotroph microorganisms. ===Formation of serpentinite === Serpentinite can form from olivine via several reactions. Olivine is a solid solution of forsterite, the magnesium-endmember, and fayalite, the iron-endmember. Reaction 1c describes the hydration of olivine to yield serpentine and Mg(OH)2 (brucite). Serpentine is stable at high pH in the presence of brucite like calcium silicate hydrate, (C-S-H) phases formed along with portlandite (Ca(OH)2) in hardened Portland cement paste after the hydration of belite (Ca2SiO4), the artificial calcium equivalent of forsterite. Analogy of reaction 1c with belite hydration in ordinary Portland cement: After reaction, the poorly soluble reaction products (aqueous silica or dissolved magnesium ions) can be transported in solution out of the serpentinized zone by diffusion or advection. A similar suite of reactions involves pyroxene-group minerals, though less readily and with complication of the additional end-products due to the wider compositions of pyroxene and pyroxene-olivine mixes. Talc and magnesian chlorite are possible products, together with the serpentine minerals antigorite, lizardite, and chrysotile. The final mineralogy depends both on rock and fluid compositions, temperature, and pressure. Antigorite forms in reactions at temperatures that can exceed during metamorphism, and it is the serpentine group mineral stable at the highest temperatures. Lizardite and chrysotile can form at low temperatures very near the Earth's surface. Fluids involved in serpentinite formation commonly are highly reactive and may transport calcium and other elements into surrounding rocks; fluid reaction with these rocks may create metasomatic reaction zones enriched in calcium and called rodingites. In the presence of carbon dioxide, however, serpentinitization may form either magnesite (MgCO3) or generate methane (CH4). It is thought that some hydrocarbon gases may be produced by serpentinite reactions within the oceanic crust. or, in balanced form: Reaction 2a is favored if the serpentinite is Mg-poor or if there isn't enough carbon dioxide to promote talc formation. Reaction 2b is favored in highly magnesian compositions and low partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The degree to which a mass of ultramafic rock undergoes serpentinisation depends on the starting rock composition and on whether or not fluids transport calcium, magnesium and other elements away during the process. If an olivine composition contains sufficient fayalite, then olivine plus water can completely metamorphose to serpentine and magnetite in a closed system. In most ultramafic rocks formed in the Earth's mantle, however, the olivine is about 90% forsterite endmember, and for that olivine to react completely to serpentine, magnesium must be transported out of the reacting volume. Serpentinitization of a mass of peridotite usually destroys all previous textural evidence because the serpentine minerals are weak and behave in a very ductile fashion. However, some masses of serpentinite are less severely deformed, as evidenced by the apparent preservation of textures inherited from the peridotite, and the serpentinites may have behaved in a rigid fashion. ===Hydrogen production by anaerobic oxidation of fayalite ferrous ions=== Serpentine is the product of the reaction between water and fayalite's ferrous (Fe2+) ions. The process is of interest because it generates hydrogen gas: The reaction can be viewed simplistically as follows: This reaction resembles the Schikorr reaction observed in the anaerobic oxidation of the ferrous hydroxide in contact with water. ===Extraterrestrial production of methane by serpentinization=== The presence of traces of methane in the atmosphere of Mars has been hypothesized to be a possible evidence for life on Mars if methane was produced by bacterial activity. Serpentinization has been proposed as an alternative non-biological source for the observed methane traces. Using data from the Cassini probe flybys obtained in 2010–12, scientists were able to confirm that Saturn's moon Enceladus likely has a liquid water ocean beneath its frozen surface. A model suggests that the ocean on Enceladus has an alkaline pH of 11–12. The high pH is interpreted to be a key consequence of serpentinization of chondritic rock, that leads to the generation of H2, a geochemical source of energy that can support both abiotic and biological synthesis of organic molecules. ==Impact on agriculture== Soil cover over serpentinite bedrock tends to be thin or absent. Soil with serpentine is poor in calcium and other major plant nutrients, but rich in elements toxic to plants such as chromium and nickel.\\"CVO Website - Serpentine and serpentinite\\" , USGS/NPS Geology in the Parks Website, September 2001, accessed 27 February 2011. ==Uses== ===Decorative stone in architecture=== Grades of serpentinite higher in calcite, along with the verd antique (breccia form of serpentinite), have historically been used as decorative stones for their marble-like qualities. College Hall at the University of Pennsylvania, for example, is constructed out of serpentine. Popular sources in Europe before contact with the Americas were the mountainous Piedmont region of Italy and Larissa, Greece.Ashurst, John. Dimes, Francis G.

Inuit made tools and more recently carvings of animals for commerce.

Ofenstein), a carved stone base beneath a cast iron stove.Talcose-schist from Canton Valais. By Thomags Bonney, (Geol. Mag., 1897, N.S., [iv], 4, 110--116) abstract ===Neutron shield in nuclear reactors=== Serpentinite has a significant amount of bound water, hence it contains abundant hydrogen atoms able to slow down neutrons by elastic collision (neutron thermalization process). Because of this serpentinite can be used as dry filler inside steel jackets in some designs of nuclear reactors. For example, in RBMK series it was used for top radiation shielding to protect operators from escaping neutrons. Serpentine can also be added as aggregate to special concrete used in nuclear reactor shielding to increase the concrete density (2.6 g/cm3) and its neutron capture cross section. ==Cultural references== It is the state rock of California, USA and the California Legislature specified that serpentine was \\"the official State Rock and lithologic emblem.\\"California Government Code § 425.2; see In 2010, a bill was introduced which would have removed serpentine's special status as state rock due to it potentially containing chrysotile asbestos. The bill met with resistance from some California geologists, who noted that the chrysotile present is not hazardous unless it is mobilized in the air as dust. ==See also== * * , also useful for silicate and oxide reactions in mineralogy * * – FMQ: fayalite-magnetite- quartz * * (analogous to forsterite hydration) * * * , involving also the formation of magnetite and hydrogen by a very similar mechanism * , a soil derived from serpentine minerals * , the main minerals comprising serpentinite * * *Hydrogen Cycle == References == == External links == * The Lost City hydrothermal field, Mid-Atlantic ridge: serpentinization, the driving force of the system. * H2-rich fluids from serpentinization: Geochemical and biotic implications: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

He was one of the first music broadcasters in the United Kingdom to champion hard rock and heavy metal in the early 1980s, providing the only national radio forum for both bands and fans. The Friday Rock Show that he hosted gave new bands airtime for their music and fans an opportunity to hear it. His radio show was a factor in the rise of the new wave of British heavy metal. He used a personal tag-line of \\"TV on the radio\\". His voice was heard by millions around the world announcing the Wembley Stadium acts at Live Aid in 1985. ==Early life== Born Richard Anthony Crispian Francis Prew Hope-Weston in Eynsham, Oxfordshire, 11 July 1940. His grandmother owned a travelling repertory company, his father was an electronics engineer and his mother a former singer and dancer. Expelled from school at 15 for truancy, Vance got his first job as trainee manager at the Hyde Park Hotel, London. He joined the merchant navy in 1956, aged 16, as a cabin boy. It was while docked in New York, listening to US radio, that Vance first toyed with becoming a disc jockey. He had been brought up on the British broadcasting of the 1950s and, like a number of his contemporaries, fell in love with the brash sound of American commercial radio. When Vance returned to the UK, he worked as a mechanic for a jukebox company so that he could hear music for free. Unable to find an opening in British radio he enrolled at a Northern Irish college, becoming a part-time actor/stage hand. He joined the Ulster Bridge Repertory Company, run by the actor James Ellis, as a stage manager. ==Career== ===KOL Seattle and KHJ Los Angeles=== Moving to Vancouver in pursuit of his first wife, Fern, in 1964, he joined KOL Seattle as its prime drive-time jock, contrary to other reporting, under the name Tommy Vance. He got into a pay dispute with KOL and quit and went on to voice his displeasure on rival KJR where he cohosted for a few days with KJR's prime time jock Pat O'Day. From there Vance moved to Los Angeles where he was offered a show by programming consultant Bill Drake on KHJ radio (aka Boss Radio), holding the evening airshift at KHJ for several months in late 1965. The programme had originally been intended for another presenter who had pulled out of the deal at the last moment, the jingles and pre-launch publicity could not go to waste continuing under the name \\"Tommy Vance\\", \\"The station asked if I would take the name as they had already made the jingles for him. I said, for that kind of money you can call me what you like, mate.\\" KHJ was one of the most successful and influential Top 40 stations of the era and California in 1965 was a great place to be. However, America was then involved in a war in Vietnam and when Tommy got his draft papers for the US Army, he decided it was time to head back to the UK. ===Offshore Pirate Radio=== Vance returned to the UK in 1965 just before Christmas with British musician Ian Whitcomb who lent him the fare. Tommy knocked on the door of Caroline House in London, no programme controller was going to pass up on the opportunity to employ a KHJ boss jock and Caroline's Bill Hearne was no exception. He was hired by Radio Caroline South, where his colleagues included Johnnie Walker, Dave Lee Travis, Tony Blackburn and Emperor Rosko. On 3 January 1966 Vance presented his first show on Caroline South, his slogan was \\"TV on radio\\" and used Jack Costanzo's version of the \\"Naked City Theme\\" as his signature tune. In 1966, Vance released a handful of singles, \\"You Must Be the One\\" a covers of Herman's Hermits', 'Silhouettes' and a cover of The Rolling Stones, \\"Off the Hook\\". Vance’s Wife was not best pleased with the idea that her husband was going to be on a ship two weeks out of three and it would mean she would be living in an unfamiliar city on her own, So Vance left Radio Caroline after a few months and moved to Radio Luxembourg. The marriage did not last so when Radio Caroline's Ronan O'Rahilly suggested Tommy should return to the ship there was nothing to stop him, and he rejoined in December 1966. During the summer of 1967 it became apparent that the government was going to legislate against the offshore stations. Tommy heard a rumour that Philip Birch, boss of Wonderful Radio London, was negotiating to move his station to France and he wanted to be a part of it. In July 1967 he transferred to Radio London. Unfortunately Big L failed to find a base on the continent. Rather than break the new law, it chose to close down on 14 August so Tommy's stay with the station was brief. ===Radio 1, BBC World Service and Capital Radio=== After the pirates were closed down in 1967, the BBC's new station, BBC Radio 1, adopted much of their musical philosophy and took on many of their personnel including Caroline colleagues Tony Blackburn and Johnnie Walker, and Radio London's John Peel. Vance co-hosted the \\"progressive\\" show Top Gear with John Peel. When the programme was given to Peel to present solo, Vance moved to the BBC World Service in the late 1960s, launching \\"Pop Club\\", a hugely popular radio programme on the BBC World Service. Tommy Vance dubbed \\"TV on the radio\\", hosted the show throughout its duration. Each installment of the programme started with a song from Cliff Richard, who was the nominal president of the club. Listeners to the BBC World Service from all over the world would apply to become members of Pop Cub receiving a membership card, special badges and gifts. Every week Tommy Vance would read listeners' letters and played requests with one being chosen as the \\"letter of the week\\". Frustrated with his lack of progress, however, Vance joined Radio Monte Carlo International with Dave Cash and Kenny Everett. In October 1973 all three would join the new London-based Capital Radio, Britain's first legal commercial pop station, initially co-presenting the morning show with Joan Shenton and then playing reggae and soul music on a weekend show. In 1975 Vance made a film appearance as disc jockey, Ricky Storm, in Richard Loncraine's Slade in Flame, a vehicle for the group Slade.Film end credits By 1976, Vance was also on the Portsmouth ILR station Radio Victory. Vance hosted Capital's first reggae show and, at a time when punk was being shunned by the press, he carried out the first in-depth interview with Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols in 1977, in which Rotten talked at length about his love of reggae music, at a time when the group were given very little media exposure elsewhere. ===BBC and the Friday Rock Show=== Vance returned to Radio 1 in November 1978 to begin a 15-year stint hosting the show for which he is best remembered — the Friday Rock Show. He was to become associated with heavy metal and rock music; his deep, resonant, booming voice and catch-phrase 'classic cuts' have been much imitated. The first record which he played on the show, and with which he finished on his final programme in 1993, was 'Rock 'n' Roll Damnation' by AC/DC. A 1983 edition was the first radio programme to use only compact discs. His signature music was \\"Take It Off the Top\\" by Dixie Dreggs and then he would say in his gravelly voice, \\"Hi, this is TV on the radio and welcome to the programme that we call the Friday Rock Show.\\" Vance had a two-year stint (10 January 1982 to 1 January 1984) hosting the Sunday-afternoon Top 40, where he showed knowledge of and enthusiasm for a wide range of music and displayed a similar keenness when he hosted Top of the Pops around the same time. He also deputised on the Top 40 for Richard Skinner (in 1984 and 1985), Bruno Brookes (in 1987) and Mark Goodier (in 1991 and 1992). Vance was a daily presenter on BFBS from 1976 to 1987 and so he also became known in Germany, where BFBS was popular among a civilian audience despite being aimed officially at British military personnel. He also presented a weekly chart show for BFBS as well as other programmes such as Soul Bowl. As well as presenting the best-selling singles chart of 1982 and 1983, he also presented the equivalent show in 1991 despite not presenting the weekly chart at the time. From 1984 to 1985, Vance hosted a Thursday night AOR programme on Radio 1, \\"Into the Music.\\" This was in place for about a year before being taken off in favour of Andy Kershaw. At a similar time, the \\"Friday Rock Show\\" gained an extra hour on MW only, during which the rock charts were played. When the BBC's new radio station for London, Greater London Radio (GLR), was launched in 1988, Vance presented the drivetime show, mixing album-oriented rock and current affairs dubbed \\"rock and rolling news\\". He also became the continuity announcer for BBC2 in the early 1970s as well as Sky One in the late 1980s and interviewed for the BBC World Service. Vance was a frequent choice as master of ceremonies at award shows, concerts and festivals; such as Monsters of Rock at Donington Park. Vance departed Radio 1 in March 1993, however, he continued to host Rock Salad for BBC World Service for many years. ===Later years=== Tommy was a key player in the launch of Virgin Radio in March 1993, presenting the Drivetime show, a move he later regretted as the station dropped its adventurous format in favour of an ad-driven playlist. Vance co-founded the internet radio station Rock Radio Network with his former Radio 1 producer Tony Wilson, music promoter Andy King and journalist Malcolm Dome in 1997, rebranding as TotalRock in 2000. Vance developed business interests with the Silk Sound studios in Soho, later joined by The Bridge. He revived the Friday Rock Show for the digital channel VH1 which ran for some years until 2002. He featured twice in the Channel 4 comedy series, The 11 O'Clock Show, the spot was called Tommy Vance's News Slam in which he took a minute to read out news headlines. He was presenter and voiceover for the Channel 5 series Dumber and Dumber and had a much quoted appearance on Brass Eye. Perhaps his most memorable TV appearance came in 2004 when he walked out of ITV's Hell's Kitchen. He decided to leave the show after escaping a scalding from boiling fat and foulmouthed abuse from the celebrity chef, Gordon Ramsey. Vance's agent stated that he felt the environment was \\"dangerous\\" and that he was a risk to himself and the other contestants due to his age. When Vance moved to Spain, it was with the intention of a gentle semi-retirement. It was not long before he was back on the air playing music for the tourists and ex-pats on the Costa del Sol's Spectrum FM. Vance came back to Britain and threw himself into work again, doing commercials, appearing on television and returning to Virgin to present a weekly show on their DAB and internet offshoot, Virgin Classic Rock. == Death == Vance died at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford, Kent in the early hours of 6 March 2005, three days after suffering a stroke at his home.DJ Tommy Vance dies at Daily Telegraph. Retrieved 27 February 2015 He said of death, \\"When you're gone, you're gone, I don't want anybody weeping for me.\\" Vance is survived by his ex-wife, their son and daughter. == Tributes == On 11 March 2005, five days after Vance's death, TotalRock ran Rock On, Tommy Day, a 15-hour live broadcast celebrating his life and work, including much music, numerous testimonials from artists and colleagues, and also from people who wrote down their thoughts on Tommy at a special Forum, In Memoriam: Tommy Vance, put up at the TotalRock website. As a finale, after the actual live broadcast had ended, the last Friday Rock Show Vance recorded for BBC Radio 1 in 1993 was re-broadcast. Author Paul Stenning dedicated his biographies of Iron Maiden and Slash to Vance.Iron Maiden: 30 Years of the Beast (2006). .Slash: Surviving Guns N' Roses, Velvet Revolver And Rock’s Snakepit (2007). . On 31 March 2006, a Tommy Vance Tribute Night, in association with the Teenage Cancer Trust foundation, was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Judas Priest, Scorpions and Ian Gillan all performed to pay tribute. There were also special stage appearances by Roger Daltrey and Bruce Dickinson. In early 2018, it was announced that a new festival, Stonedeaf, would be naming their stage after Tommy Vance. In true Monsters of Rock fashion with one day and one stage, held at Newark Showground on the same weekend. == References == == External links == * Merchant Navy records held at the National Archives * January 1998 Radio London interview * Radio Rewind page * * Category:1940 births Category:2005 deaths Category:English radio DJs Category:English radio people Category:English sailors Category:Offshore radio broadcasters Category:People from Eynsham Category:Pirate radio personalities Category:Virgin Radio (UK) Category:BBC Radio 1 presenters Category:Radio Luxembourg (English) presenters Category:Golders Green Crematorium ","title":"Tommy Vance"},{"id":"1439773","text":"Dagobert III (c.699–715) was Merovingian king of the Franks (711–715).

It is owned by the National Trust, who bought the property at auction in October 2014 for £450,000.CP Bigwood Auction Results It was formerly for many years part of Birmingham City Council's Outdoor Learning Service, providing outdoor education, and with links to the climbing community. ==Thomas Telford== Located on the London to Holyhead A5 road (Great Britain), Ogwen developed as a stage coach inn and the present stores building was once stabling for horses. The nearby Tin Can Alley was a source of honing stones used to sharpen tools during the construction of the A5 by Thomas Telford. This mammoth project started in 1815 and it was 1836 by the time the first mail coach crossed the Menai Straits via Telford's bridge. Telford designed the milestones and the hexagonal toll houses every five miles. Toll houses survive in Capel Curig and Bethesda, Wales whilst in the middle stands Ogwen. ==Climbers== The centre is informally referred to as \\"The Cott\\" and has been used as a base for climbers since the nineteenth century. During the 1890s climbers stayed at Ogwen or the Pen-y-Gwryd and early accounts make mention of Mrs Jones of Ogwen Cottage; \\" Mrs Jones at Ogwen Cottage always most good naturedly received and fed us if we turned up, no matter at what hour.” In 1895 Archer Thompson ascended Twll Du, climbing the ice with an unusual tool; \\"According to tradition Thor was armed with a hammer for his battle with the Frost Giants, and with such a weapon, we too, were luckily provided in the form of a hatchet, surreptitiously removed from Mrs Jones' coal cellar at Ogwen.” The 1894 Climbers' Club Journal contained an advert for The Cott citing it as \\"the chief centre for climbers visiting Snowdonia….the cottage is on the high road and conveyances meet visitors at Bethesda Station if so desired.” Geoffrey Winthrop Young, a noted alpinist with many first ascents to his credit, stayed at Ogwen between visits to the Alps in the early 1900s. ==Mountaineering School== 1959 saw Ron James, Trevor Jones and Tony Mason-Hornby purchasing The Cott from Mrs Williams and opening it as a mountaineering school. Ogwen became a climbing base and Mrs Williams gave the new owners advice on mounting rescues; \\"Fire a red flare in the car park – get the climbers together and put the one with the cleanest boots in charge.” With increasing leisure time and improved transport links, Ogwen grew as a climbing mecca and The Cott's instructors regularly became involved in rescuing climbers in trouble and gradually a specialist mountain rescue team evolved into what is now the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Organisation. == Birmingham City Council == Ron James remained chief instructor for another five years after Birmingham City Council purchased The Cott in 1964. Over the next 45 years thousands of Birmingham people attended courses at Ogwen. Until the 1980s courses were for a fortnight but economic considerations and the need to take more students meant a reduction to six days. The Adventurous Activities Licensing Service (AALLS) pays regular visits and while the activities may not be as extreme as they once were, Ogwen is probably the only centre in the UK to programme multi-pitch climbing for secondary school students. ==Activities== The traditional core of mountaineering activities remains with an emphasis on mountain walking and climbing but the programme has expanded to include kayaking, gorge walking, canoeing, ski trips, orienteering, expeditions. A student might ascend Hope on the Idwal Slabs as their first ever climb, before descending Suicide Wall by abseil. An evening of orienteering and then the next day might see a kayak descent of the Afon Llugwy or a walk up Tryfan. ==Residential experience== Ogwen now offers self- catering bunkhouse style accommodation and runs National Governing Body Awards and adventure courses for adults. Students look after themselves, help serve meals, wash and tidy up. ==Sale in 2014== In October 2014 it was sold off by Birmingham City Council, which had to close its outdoor education service due to funding cuts and an increasing number of schools switching to different venues for educational trips.

Due to its position on the banks of Windermere, the town has become a tourist honeypot. Although their mutual growth has caused them to become one large settlement, the town is distinct from the town of Windermere as the two still have distinguishable town centres. Historically part of Westmorland, in 2012, Bowness was one of the official stop off points for the Olympic torch before it made its way to the Olympic Games opening ceremony. ==Etymology== 'Bowness' (originally 'Bulnes') means \\" 'the headland where the bull grazes', from OE 'bula', 'bull' and OE 'næss' 'headland', perhaps referring to the keeping of the parish bull.\\" The 'on-Windermere' part was added later (found on the Ordnance Survey map of 1899), presumably to distinguish this 'Bowness' from other Cumbrian ones. ('OE' = Old English). ==History== The town's ancient parish church of St Martin was built in 1483 but of an older foundation. The former rectory is said to have been built in 1415. A grammar school was founded in about 1600. A new building was opened in 1836, funded by local landowner John Bolton of Storrs Hall. The foundation stone was laid by William Wordsworth. During the 19th century, Bowness grew from a small fishing village to a town living almost entirely off tourism and holiday homes. It was the centre of the boat-building industry that provided the sailing yachts, rowing boats and steam launches used on the lake. A large number of hotels and boarding houses gave employment to the permanent population of the town. Queen Adelaide visited Bowness in 1840, staying at the Royal Hotel. The arrival of the railway in 1847 in Windermere (the residents of Bowness had opposed a station in their own town) provided much of the momentum for the growth. Bowness-on-Windermere became a civil parish in 1894 and an urban district council was formed for the town at the same time. In 1905, the council merged with that of Windermere, and the two civil parishes merged in 1974 under the name of Windermere. The civil parish is governed by a town council. ==Transport== Windermere railway station offers train and bus connections to the surrounding areas, Manchester, Manchester Airport and the West Coast Main Line, and is about from the lakefront. Both Stagecoach and the local council provide frequent connecting buses from Bowness Pier; Stagecoach's open-top double-decker buses travel through the centre of town and continue to Ambleside and Grasmere, while the council's wheelchair- accessible minibuses run around the edge of town. The Windermere Ferry, a car carrying cable ferry, connects Bowness at Ferry Nab on the eastern side of the lake with Ferry House Far Sawrey on the western side of the lake, a trip of approximately 10 minutes. For those looking for a more leisurely way to travel, Windermere Lake Cruises operate regular lake cruises running from Bowness Bay to the north end of the lake at Ambleside and south end at Fell Foot. ==Media== Readers of Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons series of books will recognise Bowness as the lakeside town of 'Rio'.

He joined the South African Broadcasting Corporation in 1943, introducing for several years a programme called Rhythm Club. Moving to England in the 1950s, Dell worked on Radio Luxembourg (which then had recording studios in London), the BBC Light Programme and its successor Radio 2 until shortly before his death. == The Dance Band Days == Dell's most celebrated programme, The Dance Band Days, ran from 1969 (initially and a little incongruously on Radio 1, the BBC's \\"pop\\" channel, launched in 1967 as a replacement for the offshore pirate stations) until 1995 and, in later years, did so in a sequence on Monday evenings with Dell's \\"other side\\", The Big Band Sound. The former included recordings by the likes of Jack Hylton, Ambrose, Henry Hall, Geraldo and other dance bandleaders. The main elements of these programmes were retained for a number of years after Dell's death, in a Sunday night programme introduced on Radio 2 by Malcolm Laycock. == Other work for the BBC == Though Dell mostly presented programmes of music from the dance band and swing eras, he was also an early presenter of Pick of the Pops in 1956 and, in his later years, of Sounds Easy, a Sunday afternoon programme on Radio 2 which was notable for its attention to the recordings of Frank Sinatra and Peggy Lee (both of whom he pre-deceased) and Henry Mancini with the \\"Mancini moment\\". He won a 1983 Grammy Award in the Best Historical Album category for The Tommy Dorsey/Frank Sinatra Sessions - Vols. 1, 2 & 3\\\\. ===Digital technology=== In the 1980s, with the onset of digital technology, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation used the Packman Audio Noise Suppressor, a machine developed by a sound engineer, Robert Parker (1936–2004), to produce stereophonic sound of high quality from 78rpm mono recordings (see The Stage, 1 March 2005). Dell provided the sleeve notes for Dance Bands UK (1988), a BBC compact disc of ABC \\"transfer\\" recordings, thereby illustrating his authority as a historian of such music. == External links == * * The History of Radio 2 - Alan Dell profile at bbc.co.uk DEAD LINK * == References== Category:1924 births Category:1995 deaths Category:British radio DJs Category:British radio people Category:BBC Radio 2 presenters Category:Grammy Award winners Category:20th-century British musicians Category:South African emigrants to the United Kingdom ","title":"Alan Dell"},{"id":"1439807","text":"Logan Glacier is a glacier in the U.S. state of Alaska and province of Yukon, Canada.

He is best known for his 1816 compilation Kentucky Harmony, which is the first Southern shape-note tunebook.\\"Four leading shape-note tune books of this period, each containing a number of folk hymns, are Ananias Davisson's Kentucky Harmony (the first Southern shape-note tunebook, Harrisonburg, VA, 1816)...\\" \\"the very first shape-note book produced south of the Mason-Dixon line, Ananias Davisson's Kentucky Harmony, published in Harrison, Virginia, in 1816\\" According to musicologist George Pullen Jackson, Davisson's compilations are \\"pioneer repositories of a sort of song that the rural South really liked.\\" == Life and career == Davisson was born February 2, 1780, in Shenandoah County, Virginia. His wife was named Ann (surname unknown); they had no children. In 1804 he bought land in Rockingham County, supplementing his income as a farmer by conducting singing classes in the Shenandoah Valley. He established a printing shop in Harrisonburg in 1816, and in that year published the Kentucky Harmony, the first Southern shape note tunebook. As a printer, he cultivated a network of singing school teachers and composers in Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky who sold his tunebooks and sent him their own compositions.David W. Music, \\"Ananias Davisson, Robert Boyd, Reubin Monday, John Martin, and Archibald Rhea in East Tennessee, 1816-26\\", American Music Vol. 1, No. 3 (Autumn, 1983), pp. 72-84. He spent his last years living on a farm at Weyer's Cave, about 14 miles from Dayton, Virginia, and died October 21, 1857. He is buried in the Massanutten-Cross Keys Cemetery, Rockingham County, Virginia. Davisson was a member and ruling elder of the Presbyterian Church, active in the Presbytery of Winchester and the Synod of Virginia. == The Kentucky Harmony and early printing activities == There are records of a printing firm in Harrisburg called Davidson and Bourne active 1812-1816; there are reasons for believing that Davidson is a variant spelling of Davisson, who obtained shape note fonts and began a separate enterprise for publishing music in 1816.\\"Although Davisson's last name is spelled Davisson in his Kentucky Harmony, the Rockingham County Deed Books of this period also record Ananias Davis and Ananias Davidson, indicating a likely variance in the custom of spelling his name, as well as the increased probability that he was the same person associated earlier with Bourne in the printing business.\\" The Kentucky Harmony was printed early in 1816, and the same fonts were used later in the year to publish Joseph Funk's \\"Allgemein nützliche Choral-Music\\", a Mennonite tunebook in German, so it is believed that Davisson was the printer of Funk's tune book.\\"Further support of the view that Choral-Music was printed with Davisson's music fonts is found by comparing the music symbols of this tunebook with those of Kentucky Harmony, which have similar lines, and signs for clefs and note heads.\\" The invention of shape notes in Philadelphia in 1801 had greatly enlarged the market for printed music. \\"As its story is usually told, America’s home-grown, accessible notation in triangles, circles, squares, and diamonds moved southward from Philadelphia and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Harrisonburg and Winchester, Virginia in the 1810s. Here, Ananias Davisson’s Harrisonburg print-shop became a major publishing center for shape-note hymnody, and the tradition quickly spread throughout the MidAtlantic and Southern United States.\\" Even during the Davidson and Bourne days, Davisson traveled extensively to supplement his income by teaching singing schools. Sometime during 1815-1816 he acquired shape note fonts and began to print music. Following the pattern of John Wyeth, who targeted his Repository of Sacred Music (1810, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania) to Calvinists, and the Part Second of the Repository (1813) to Methodists and Baptists, Davisson targeted the Kentucky Harmony to his fellow Presbyterians, and the Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony to Methodists. However, the idea, first used in the Repository, Part Second of 1813, of collecting folk tunes, harmonizing them, and using them as vehicles for hymn texts, was followed by Davisson from the very first. In contrast, the music advocated in New England and the Midwest by the \\"Better Music Boys\\" (e.g. Lowell Mason, Thomas Hastings, and others) sought to emulate European styles, while denigrating William Billings and other composers of the First New England School. The 1816 Kentucky Harmony has no European compositions, retains the best of the New England fuging tunes, makes extensive use of regional folk tunes, and has 60% of its songs in the minor key.\\"The editions of The Kentucky Harmony and The Tennessee Harmony are roughly 60% minor; even the early editions of The Easy Instructor are over 50% minor.\\" == A Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony == A Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony (Harrisonburg, Virginia: 1820) went through three editions.The 1825 edition of A Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony is available on-line at . It was notable for its inclusion of English, Scottish and Irish folk tunes pared with spiritual texts. It included very little New England hymnody or church hymns. Davisson specifically dedicated it to his \\"Methodist friends\\" for use in their camp meetings. > The author's principle design in offering his Supplement is, that his > Methodist friends may be furnished with a suitable and proper arrangement of > such pieces as may seem best to animate a zealous Christian in his acts of > devotion; and while they sing with the spirit, let them learn to sing with > the understanding also.Of the camp meetings songs from the Supplement that > have been republished in the Shenandoah Harmony (2013), recordings of 319 > Salutation (and others) are easily found on YouTube. The folk tunes themselves would have been familiar to the participants, making it easier to pair the religious texts. This was at a time when the Methodists were a much smaller, out of the mainstream religion. == Other publications == Other books published by Davisson were Introduction to Sacred Music, Extracted from the Kentucky Harmony and Chiefly Intended for the Benefit of Young Scholars, (Harrisonburg, Virginia: 1821), and A Small Collection of Sacred Music (Harrisonburg, Virginia: 1825). In addition to his own tunebooks, Davisson also printed Songs of Zion by James P. Carrell (1821) and Mennonite tunebooks for Joseph Funk. == Idumea == Davisson's iconic tune first appeared in the Kentucky Harmony in 1816, based on a folk song, with treble and bass voices composed by Davisson, as a setting for Isaac Watts's \\"My God, my life, my love\\" (93 in Horae Lyricae: Poems, Chiefly of the Lyric Kind, 1707).It appears on page 33 of the facsimile of the Kentuck Harmony (sic), as made available by the University of Kentucky Library: . Following the convention of using a toponym for the tune name, he called it \\"Idumea\\" (the name of Biblical Edom during the Roman period), pronounced \\"Eye-DEW-mee-a\\" or \\"Eye- DEW-mee\\" by traditional singers.As observed by Charles Wells (mathematician), who in the same article says \\"The words are both existentialist and apocalyptic at the same time and call up something deep and terrified in me every time I sing it.\\" The first appearance of the tune with the present words (\\"And am I born to die?\\"; Charles Wesley 1763, Hymn 59) is in the Southern Harmony (1835) by William Walker, who omitted the alto. When he again published the song in Christian Harmony (1867), Walker composed a new alto part, the one that is used today. The song has a Roud Number of 6678. It has been covered by numerous folk music groups, such as The Watersons and The Young Tradition. The tune is also featured in the motion picture Cold Mountain (2003), during the scene depicting the Battle of the Crater; (the other shape song song in the film, led in a church by Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) is \\"I'm Going Home,\\" page 282 in the Sacred Harp). The 1996 album Black Ships Ate the Sky by British experimental group Current 93 features nine versions of \\"Idumea\\", each by a different vocalist.Available here: The tune has been arranged for SSATB choir and two violins by Richard Bjella, and during 1993–1996 Larry Bell composed an \\"Idumea Symphony\\" (Symphony No. 2, op. 40). == Davisson's songs today == Singing Davisson's \\"Retirement\\" at his graveside, following an all-day singing from the Shenandoah Harmony (June 7, 2015). Davisson's songs and the tunes he collected are in continuous use both in small group singings and at all-day shape note singing events. The Shenandoah Harmony (2013) contains 24 compositions by Davisson, 52 other songs from the Kentucky Harmony, and 46 songs from Supplement to the Kentucky Harmony, and is used in over a dozen all-day singings worldwide.Fourteen are listed here: The Missouri Harmony (2005 edition) contains 7 compositions and 8 arrangements, and the Christian Harmony contains Idumea, Imandra, and \\"The Lord's Supper.\\" The Sacred Harp only has \\"Idumea,\\" but it has been sung 2667 times at all-day singings during the period 1995-2019, and was the second most popular song in 2019, sung at 140 different all-day singings held around the world. In small- group singings, where novices are given a turn to chose a song that will then be led by an experienced singer, the new singer often apologizes for the choice, as though everyone else must be sick of this song by now. Modern popular culture may thrive on novelty, but old time singing is not that way; Davisson's songs have a remarkable staying power, and the words he set to music deserve new consideration every day. ==References== ==Further reading== * * Category:1780 births Category:1857 deaths Category:American male composers Category:American music publishers (people) Category:American Presbyterians Category:People from Augusta County, Virginia Category:People from Shenandoah County, Virginia Category:Shape note Category:19th-century Presbyterians Category:19th-century American composers Category:Musicians from Virginia Category:19th-century male musicians ","title":"Ananias Davisson"},{"id":"1439820","text":"Kathoey working in a go-go bar in Bangkok's Nana Plaza entertainment neighborhood The term go-go bar originally referred to a nightclub, bar, or similar establishment that featured go-go dancers; while some go-go bars in that original sense still exist, the link between its present uses and that original meaning is often more tenuous and regional. Speaking broadly, the term has been used by venues that cover a wide range of businesses, from nightclubs or discotheques, where dancers are essentially there to set the mood, to what are in essence burlesque theaters or strip clubs, where dancers are part of a show and the primary focus. ==United States== The term go-go bar is often used for certain sorts of strip clubs. In regions where the term is used, go-go bars are considered lower in class when compared to gentlemen's clubs, which offer a more coordinated and show-centric experience. In these bars: *There is no champagne court. *Dress codes are more lax for both patrons and performers. *There are no staging, choreography, or special effects considerations. *A House Mother monitors activity and assists performers in the dressing area. *Feature performers usually do not perform at go-go bars. ==Southeast Asia== In Southeast Asia, and particularly in Thailand and parts of the Philippines, Go Go bars can include a wide variety of indoor bars with dancers and/or hostesses; these typically do not offer striptease. These are most often venues for prostitution, and the dancers are usually available to be bar fined by customers. These are often, but not exclusively, found in red light districts catering to foreigners. ==Etymology== The origin of the term go-go dancing goes back to a 1949 British film Whisky Galore!. This film tells the story of the sinking of a ship loaded with whiskey. The French title of this film was Whisky à gogo !, \\"à gogo\\" being Parisian slang for \\"galore\\". During the period that this film was showing in France, discotheques were just introduced as a new form of entertainment. Due to the success of the film and the snob appeal of drinking whiskey in France, a number of discotheques were given the name \\"Whiskey à Go-Go\\". The first Whisky à Gogo nightclub opened in Paris in 1947, drawing the \\"Whisky\\" part of its name from the whisky labels that lined its walls. In 1953 it became the first discotheque. The club was franchised, first in Chicago in 1958 and then in Los Angeles in 1964. In May 1964 the Los Angeles club was featured in Life magazine and by 1965 clubs called Whisky à Go-Go (or Whiskey à Go-Go) had appeared in Milwaukee, Washington, San Francisco and Atlanta. In the Los Angeles club a new style of dance was taking place, as go-go dancers in short, fringed skirts and high boots danced in a glass booth above the patrons. The first recorded occurrence of topless go-go dancing was in the Condor nightclub in San Francisco in 1964, and topless go-go dancing quickly became a part of the adult entertainment industry. During this time, several dance styles were becoming popular in which dancers danced separately from their partner or with no partner at all. American discos, often using the same name (“Whiskey A Go-Go”) as their French predecessor, introduced young women dancing alone in these new styles as a form of entertainment, creating the concept of a \\"go-go dancer\\".A.O.

Their style incorporates both Chicago blues and Texas blues. ==Career== Funderburgh was born in Plano, Texas, United States. Anson was with The Bee's Knees in 1976 and recorded \\"Cold Hearted Woman\\". In 1977 the Rockets began with Anson, Mark Hickman on Fender bass, David Watson on drums and vocalist Darrell Nulisch. In 1981, Funderburgh released the Rockets' debut album Talk to You By Hand from New Orleans, Louisiana based Black Top Records. The band consisted of Anson, with Darrell Nulisch on vocals and harmonica. The album included a cover version of Earl King's song, \\"Come On\\". Talk to You By Hand was also the first ever release by the record label. Before the debut album's release in 1981, Funderburgh participated that same year with The Fabulous Thunderbirds in recording of their Butt-Rockin' album. Funderburgh and the Rockets appeared at the 1984 San Francisco Blues Festival. When Nulisch left the band in 1985, Funderburgh invited the blues harmonica player Sam Myers from Jackson, Mississippi to fill in the spot. He stayed with the band until his death on July 17, 2006, appearing on eight albums with them. The first Rockets' recording featuring Myers was My Love Is Here To Stay which came out in 1986. Anson Funderburgh and the Rockets appeared in the 1994 film China Moon, starring Ed Harris and Madeleine Stowe. They are shown playing \\"Tell Me What I Want To Hear\\" from the self-titled release. As well as the studio recordings, in 1990 the band played the Long Beach Blues Festival. The same year, they appeared on show number 109 of the NBC television program, Sunday Night. In 1989 and 1990 the band's bassist was Mike Judge, future animator and creator of Beavis and Butt-head and King of the Hill. Their song \\"Can We Get Together\\" was also featured in the film, 21 Grams in 2003. In 2007, Funderburgh played on and produced John Németh's album, Magic Touch. Németh had briefly replaced Myers in Funderburgh's backing band. In 2011, The Mill Block Blues album was released. The CD was unique in that a portion of the sales of the album was donated to help fellow musicians in need via the HART Fund. The HART Fund (Handy Artist Relief Trust) is a service provided by the Blues Foundation which provides for acute, chronic and preventive medical and dental care as well as funeral expenses for blues musicians. In October 2012, was the first U.S. and European tour of Golden State / Lone Star Revue, an All Star package that included Funderburgh, Little Charlie Baty on guitar, former Rockets drummer Wes Starr, bassist Richard W. Grigsby and leader, harmonicist and singer Mark Hummel. The quintet was featured on Hummel's 2014 release on Electro-Fi Records, The Hustle Is Really On, nominated for a Blues Music Award for 'Best Traditional Blues Album' in 2015. In 2013, Funderburgh produced and featured on The Andy T Band's Drink Drank Drunk, released on Delta Groove. In 2014, he was nominated for a Blues Music Award in the 'Best Instrumentalist – Guitar' category.

Johnny Beerling career summaryThe events of 1 September 1988 perhaps best sum up the glamour of Johnny Beerling's eight years as controller of BBC Radio 1, BBC NewsRadio 1 – The Inside Scene, , 18 April 2008, Trafford Publishing Audio version read by Beerling via Amazon,com ==Early life== Beerling attended the Sir Roger Manwood's School in Sandwich, Kent. ==Career== ===National Service=== He began his radio career during national service from 1955–7, when he ran a radio station for the Royal Air Force station British Forces Aden in the Aden Protectorate, acting as its station manager, studio engineer and morning DJ. ===BBC=== In 1957, he joined the BBC as a Technical Operator and soon became a Studio Manager. In the early sixties he was appointed as a producer in the Gramophone Department where he worked on a number of popular programmes such as Housewives' Choice, Midday Spin, and Two Way Family Favourites as well as late evening shows like Music to Midnight. Beerling brought in Simon Dee from the pirate radio scene and he was also the first producer of Terry Wogan. As an admirer of the pirate radio stations he devised a fast moving new radio show on Saturdays called Where It's At, one of Kenny Everett earliest shows. Beerling was one of the few employees of the BBC Light Programme in the mid-1960s to regard the model of offshore pirate radio as one which the BBC would have to follow and to that end he managed to take a trip to visit Radio London to see for himself how they operated. ===Radio 1=== In 1967 the Marine Offences Bill led to the close down of the pirate radio stations and the BBC decided to set up Radio 1 to provide a legal alternative. Johnny was at the forefront of this process, recruiting the DJ talent and devising the jingles, subsequently producing the first ever show with Tony Blackburn. He became an Executive Producer in 1972 and the following conceived and launched the show for which he is best known, the Radio 1 Roadshow. This grew from a small caravan operation on Newquay Beach to an 80-foot mobile stage show housed in a series of articulated trucks, supported by a giant outdoor TV display visited by 500,000 people a year. In 1985, he was appointed Controller of the Radio 1 Network, responsible for the entire output including such major projects as the sound for Live Aid. During his time there he cultivated the \\"Smashie and Nicey\\" image despite appointing more music oriented presenters like Mark Goodier, Nicky Campbell and Simon Mayo. He oversaw the transfer of the network from AM to a better quality FM transmission system. In programming, he was responsible to for increasing the number of social action campaigns, extending news coverage and increasing the coverage of live concerts and music sessions recorded in Radio 1 studios. He also introduced comedy onto the airwaves of Radio 1 with shows like The Mary Whitehouse Experience and Victor Lewis Smith. While Controller of Radio 1, he removed Jimmy Savile from the BBC Radio airwaves \\"because his programme was tired and boring\\". Of Savile's abusive behaviour, he said: \\"Jimmy Savile was a loner. He rarely socialised with any of the DJ’s or staff at Radio 1...I was not aware of any sexual improprieties which have now been uncovered.\\" During this time, Beerling was affectionately known, and referred to on air by some such as Steve Wright in his afternoon show, as \\"Johnny Bee- Leg\\". Whilst he was controller, Radio 1 began broadcasting 24 hours a day in May 1991. Beerling took enforced early retirement, aged 55, from the station in October 1993, and many of the station's veteran DJs either resigned or were sacked when Matthew Bannister succeeded him as controller. The network's ethos, music policy and target audience changed dramatically. Beerling publicly criticised the new regime at the BBC, specifically Director-General John Birt. In May 1995, the BBC re-hired Beerling on a short-term contract to organise the \\"Music Live '95\\" event in Birmingham, which was broadcast across all the BBC national networks, including Radio 1. ===Radio Data System=== Johnny Beerling was involved with the Radio Data System from 1985 onwards when the BBC appointed him Chairman of the Programme Experts Group tasked with promoting the system worldwide and ensuring compatible radios became generally available. His responsibility extended across European territories, via the European Broadcasting Union, which represented the public broadcasters for Western Europe. Beerling commissioned the design of the RDS logo and encouraged car manufacturers to factory-fit compatible radios in their vehicles. He remained involved as Chairman of the RDS Forum for 30 years until he resigned in 2016. ===Unique Productions=== After his departure from Radio 1, Beerling went to work alongside Noel Edmonds, with his production company Unique Productions where he was Chairman of Unique Special Projects and responsible for \\"Music Live '95\\" production for the BBC. Since 2007, he has lectured regularly about broadcasting and popular music on ships operated by Cunard, Fred Olson Cruise Lines, Saga Cruises, Thomson Cruises, P&O; Cruises and Cruise & Maritime Voyages. ==Awards and honours== In 1992, he was the first non-broadcaster to receive a Ferguson Award for an Outstanding Contribution to Music Radio from the Radio Academy. The following year, he was elected President of the Television and Radio Industry Club of Great Britain. He also became a governor of the BRIT School for Performing Arts and Technology in May 1993, and in the same month was presented with a Sony Award for Outstanding Services to the Radio Industry. In 2005 was made a Fellow of the Radio Academy. ==Personal life== In 1959 he married Carol Ann Reynolds, with whom he has a son, David Beerling, and daughter, Julie Margaret Wood.

Their headquarters was located in San Francisco, California, United States. From October 2007 to February 2008 (following a transfer of assets) the company was known as P2 Entertainment. The company was best known for its development of two MMOs: Star Trek Online and Gods & Heroes: Rome Rising. ==Products== As Perpetual Entertainment, the company had previously developed to beta status Gods & Heroes: Rome Rising, which was put on indefinite hold in October 2007 after several rounds of layoffs. At that time, the company announced an intent to focus exclusively on Star Trek Online. On or after 14 January 2008 it was reported that the company had ceased development of the Star Trek license, which was transferred to Cryptic Studios.Cryptic Studios now developing Star Trek Online Perpetual was also developing the Perpetual Entertainment Platform (PEP), a complete solution for developing, hosting, monitoring, and operating any networked online game.

Bowie's own interpretation of the character evolved throughout his career. \\"Space Oddity\\" (1969) depicts an astronaut who casually slips the bonds of the world to journey beyond the stars. In the song \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" (1980), Bowie reinterprets Major Tom as an oblique autobiographical symbol for himself. Major Tom is described as a \\"junkie, strung out in heavens high, hitting an all-time low\\". This lyric was interpreted as a play on the title of Bowie's album Low (1977), which charted his withdrawal following his drug abuse in the United States. Additionally, the choked and self-recriminating tone used in the lyrics \\"Time and again I tell myself I'll stay clean tonight.\\" reinforces an autobiographical and retrospective interpretation. A short time later, there is another reversal of Major Tom's original withdrawal, turning 'outwards' or towards space.Roy Carr & Charles Shaar Murray (1981). Bowie: An Illustrated Record: pp.109–116 German singer Peter Schilling retold and continued the story of Major Tom in his late 1982 release \\"Major Tom (völlig losgelöst)\\", which reached number one in Germany and Austria in early 1983. The English-language version, \\"Major Tom (Coming Home)\\", peaked at number 14 in the United States in late 1983. Other artists who have subsequently made substantial contributions to the Major Tom story include K.I.A. (\\"Mrs. Major Tom\\"). Due to some similarities in Elton John's \\"Rocket Man\\", there is a possible connection between the Rocket Man and Major Tom, a connection notably made by Bowie himself, who while singing \\"Space Oddity\\" in concert would sometimes call out, \\"Oh, Rocket Man!\\"Was \\"Major Tom\\" the astronaut a real person? from The Straight Dope ==Major Tom in Bowie's work== In \\"Space Oddity\\", from the album David Bowie (1969, later retitled Space Oddity), Major Tom's departure from Earth is successful and everything goes according to plan. At a certain point during the travel ('past one hundred thousand miles'), he claims that \\"he feels very still\\" and thinks that \\"my spaceship knows which way to go\\" and proceeds to say: \\"Tell my wife I love her very much.\\" Control then informs him: \\"Ground Control to Major Tom: your circuit's dead, there's something wrong\\" and attempts to reestablish contact with Major Tom. Tom's final words in the song (possibly not heard by Ground Control) are: > \\"Here am I floating 'round my tin can, far above the moon. Planet Earth is > blue, and there's nothing I can do.\\" In the promotional film from 1969, David Bowie plays as Major Tom, Ground Control (GC), and the Countdown Announcer. When the lyrics \\"And the stars look very different today\\" are said, two lovely women appear, portraying either angels or aliens, or perhaps both. The moment \\"Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles, I'm feeling very still\\" are said, the two women can be seen removing Major Tom's helmet and spacesuit. Later, a still fully outfitted Major Tom can be seen spinning around in space, with a panicked Ground Control attempting to contact him; the spinning Major Tom is either the reality of the situation, or Ground Control's imagination. The music video ends with Major Tom sitting in his \\"tin can\\", far above the world, with the two women by him in a ménage à trois formation. Bowie created a sequel entitled \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" (1980). The song, which peaked at Number 1 in the UK music charts and had a respectable showing in other international music charts, was featured on his LP Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps). The song actually says little about Major Tom, except to call him a \\"junkie\\", slang for a person with a heroin addiction or other compulsive habit. The context of the lyrics seems to indicate that the song is mainly about Bowie's own soul searching, rather than a literal continuation of the Major Tom story. There is an inclusion saying \\"strung out in heaven's high, hitting an all time low\\" referring to him getting high on cocaine, while his life is low. Given Bowie's own history of drug problems, it is quite possible that the \\"Major Tom\\" line could also be autobiographical. Alternatively, the song can be interpreted to provide detailed information on Tom's story. The song refers an event happening much later, after \\"Space Oddity\\". Ground control receives a message from the \\"Action Man\\", referring to Tom, and he says: \\"I've loved all I've needed to love. Sordid details following...\\" He talks about how the shrieking of nothing is killing him, how all he has are his pictures of women to keep him company, and how he now has neither money nor hair. He wants to kick the habit but the planet is \\"glowing\\"; essentially he cannot quit whatever is influencing him—and killing him—because the feeling is too pleasurable and addictive. The exact source of the influence is not defined. The later verses seem to reflect more on Bowie's literal battle with addiction, specifically about wanting to stay clean but being stuck with a \\"valuable friend\\". The song again refers directly to Tom toward the end, where he has become more of a legend, but not for his heroics. He has become a nursery rhyme in the minds of the public, with mothers warning against drug use by telling their children if they want: \\"...to get things done, you'd better not mess with Major Tom.\\" Bowie released a song entitled \\"Hallo Spaceboy\\" on his album Outside (1995). While this song itself does not directly reference Major Tom, references to Major Tom do appear in the remixed version that Bowie released with the Pet Shop Boys in 1996. This remix contains lyrics from \\"Space Oddity\\" that are sung by Pet Shop Boys vocalist Neil Tennant. Although never mentioned in the song, an astronaut, possibly Major Tom, does make an appearance in the music video for the song \\"Slow Burn\\" on Bowie's 2002 album Heathen. In the music video of Bowie's 2015 song \\"Blackstar\\" (on the album of the same name, released in 2016 two days prior to the artist's death), a dead astronaut is depicted. His skull is retrieved by an alien female who takes it back to what could be considered a cult which subsequently worships the relic. This astronaut was speculated to be a depiction of Major Tom's final fate. Video director Johan Renck said on a BBC documentary \\"to me, it was 100% Major Tom\\". That cites an interview which was only available in the UK on the date of access. ==Appearances in songs by other artists== In Peter Schilling's song \\"Major Tom (Coming Home)\\" (1983) Tom sends a final message, \\"Give my wife my love...\\", after which transmission ceases. People on Earth mourn Tom, not realizing that he is still alive. He then declares \\"Now the light commands / This is my home / I'm coming home\\", possibly referring to the afterlife. The associated music video shows an object falling back through the atmosphere, presumably either Major Tom or his ship. In this song the word \\"light\\" in \\"now the light commands\\" is often heard or transcribed as \\"life\\" but the liner notes of the LP Error in the System (and the original German) confirm the word \\"light.\\" The German-language version \\"Völlig losgelöst\\" is contained in Schilling's German LP Fehler im System (1983). Both albums also contain a different song without lyrics entitled \\"Major Tom, Part II\\". Schilling's song was recorded in French by Plastic Bertrand in 1983, but with slightly altered lyrics, in which Major Tom prefers to stay away from Earth and its selfishness and danger of nuclear war. At the Drive-In's song \\"Cosmonaut\\" (2000) was sometimes introduced at live shows by a recorded \\"final message\\" from Major Tom before he dies in space. The message does not appear in the recorded version of \\"Cosmonaut\\", which itself has no apparent connection to Major Tom. K.I.A. created a song entitled \\"Mrs. Major Tom\\" (2002) on his Adieu Shinjuku Zulu album, where the song is sung by Larissa Gomes. Here the story is told from the perspective of Major Tom's wife left at home. \\"Mrs. Major Tom\\" was covered by Sheryl Crow on William Shatner's album Seeking Major Tom (2011). The Tea Party created a song entitled \\"Empty Glass\\" on its album Seven Circles (2004). The song is written from the perspective of an unnamed person who is questioning Major Tom intensely about the purpose of life. The song also references Ground Control and the Bowie phrases \\"star man\\" and \\"diamond dogs\\". The New Zealand comedic folk duo Flight of the Conchords allude to the character in their tribute song \\"Bowie\\" (2008) where they place Bowie himself in space, and give him the rank of Lieutenant. In 2011, Jimmy Fallon appeared on the Piers Morgan Tonight television program, playing the guitar and singing a broad parody of \\"Space Oddity\\" along the lines of: \\"This is Tim Tebow to Jesus Christ\\", using a Bowie-esque vocal style. He also performed the song on his late night talk show Late Night with Jimmy Fallon in the character of an amalgamation of Tim Tebow and David Bowie called \\"Tebowie\\". Major Tom also has had and continues to have passing references in other popular songs, such as: Five Star's \\"Rain or Shine\\" (1986), Def Leppard's \\"Rocket\\" (1987), Marilyn Manson's \\"Apple of Sodom\\" (1997), The Clay People's \\"Calling Spaceship: Damien Grief\\" (1998), Lorraine Bowen's \\"Space\\" (2002), The Mars Volta's live rendition of the song \\"Cicatriz\\" (2005) featuring a lengthy jam which would evolve into the song \\"Cassandra Gemini\\", Cold's \\"Happens All The Time\\" (2005), Alphabeat's \\"Fantastic 6\\" (2007), Shiny Toy Guns' cover of Schilling's \\"Major Tom\\" (2009), The Cab's \\"Angel with a Shotgun\\" (2011), Lana Del Rey's \\"Terrence Loves You\\" (2015) which is interpreted by many fans to be a homage to Bowie and his brother Terrence, and Stephen Pearcy's \\"Ten Miles Wide\\" (2017). In 2018, the reference to “Major Tom” is made in the A Perfect Circle song “So Long and Thanks for All the Fish”, and by Lemaitre in their song \\"Rocket Girl\\" (feat. Betty Who). ==Other references in popular culture== Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield performed \\"Space Oddity\\" on board the International Space Station (ISS). With the express permission of Bowie it was released on YouTube on 13 May 2013. This was the first music video to be made in space. In 2013, Drum Corps International (DCI) world class corps Carolina Crown created a show that told a story of Major Tom. The show went on tour in 2014 and is called \\"Out of This World\\" it includes quotations from David Bowies own music. During the show Major Tom is communicating with Ground Control (GC) for the launch. Once in orbit Major Tom sees a shining spinning object in the distance and promptly loses contact with GC. At the end of the show Major Tom regains contact with GC and enters earth's atmosphere and is back home. British astronaut Timothy Peake was regularly referred to by the media as \\"Major Tim\\", during his tour of duty on board the ISS, 15 December 2015 - 18 June 2016, (Expeditions 46 and 47). This was a direct reference to Bowie's fictional astronaut. Peake was on the ISS at the time of Bowie's death and tweeted a tribute to him from there. In 2017, author Clive Gifford wrote a book aimed at children about Peake's time on board the ISS, titled \\"Ground Control to Major Tim: The Space Adventures of Major Tim Peake\\".\\"Ground Control to Major Tim: The Space Adventures of Major Tim Peake,\\" Book Depository. Retrieved 3 April 2018. Video game designer, director, and producer Hideo Kojima's admiration for Bowie inspired several elements in the Metal Gear series. In the first mission of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, the character Major Zero codenames himself Major Tom, and in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Midge Ure's cover of Bowie's \\"The Man Who Sold the World\\" is played multiple times in the story, and is also related to the plot. Additionally, the main paramilitary faction featured in the game is named after Bowie's song and album Diamond Dogs. In season 3 episode 13 of Rugrats, \\"Destination Moon\\", Tommy says, \\"This is Major Tom, to ground control, requesting permission for lift off\\". This is in reference to the song \\"Space Oddity\\". In The Venture Bros. season 1 episode \\"Ghosts of the Sargasso\\", a character named Major Tom had a major role in the plot. He first appeared in the opening scene in a flashback as having been a pilot who died in 1969 after TVC 15, an experimental aircraft which shares the name with another song by David Bowie, was piloting crashed into the ocean within the Bermuda Triangle, and his ghost later appears in the present in the episode. In addition, the opening scene's dialogue references lyrics from both \\"Space Oddity\\" and \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", and the episode introduces recurring character The Action Man, his name itself a reference to a lyric in the latter song. The show contains many other references to Bowie's work, including Bowie \\"himself\\" in several episodes. ==References== == External links == * Analysis of Schilling's \\"Major Tom (Coming Home)\\" Category:David Bowie Category:Fictional astronauts Category:Fictional characters introduced in 1969 Category:Fictional drug addicts Category:Fictional majors Category:Fictional skeletons Category:Outer space themed songs Category:Recorded music characters ","title":"Major Tom"},{"id":"1439850","text":"Janice Berry Long (née Chegwin; born 5 April 1955) is an English radio broadcaster best known for her work with BBC Radio. She has appeared on BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 2, and currently BBC Radio Wales and Greatest Hits Radio. On Radio 2 she presented a weekday night time show from 2000 to 2017 from midnight. Long was presented with a BASCA Gold Badge award on 3 October 2016 for her unique contribution to music. ==Early life== Long grew up in Liverpool, the older sister of Keith Chegwin who also had a career in radio and television. Following two years employed by Laker Airways as cabin crew and work as a shop assistant, in telesales and as an insurance clerk, Long became a station assistant at BBC Radio Merseyside in Liverpool in mid-1979. Shortly afterwards she started presenting her own show Streetlife for the station on Sunday evenings, focusing on local bands in the thriving Liverpool music scene. Frankie Goes to Hollywood did their first radio session for her show after Long had seen them perform at Eric's Club. After interviewing Paul Gambaccini for her new afternoon show, the latter recommended her to Radio 1. In July 1978 she appeared on the very first episode of the gameshow, 3-2-1. ==Broadcasting career== === Radio 1 and television === Long joined Radio 1 in 1982, making her debut on 4 December with her own Saturday evening show from 7:30 pm to 10 pm, after being presented as the 'newcomer' on Top of the Pops two nights earlier. From 1984 to 1987 she presented the Monday–Thursday Janice Long Show from 7:30 pm to 10 pm, a mix of new music and current affairs, and record review programme Singled Out on Friday evenings from 5:45 pm to 7 pm. On television, Long was a regular presenter of the BBC 1 chart show Top of the Pops between January 1983 and August 1988, often in partnership with John Peel after the departure of David Jensen with whom she struck up a solid friendship. Long returned to co-present the final show in July 2006. GLR, Radio 5 and Radio X In 1989, she joined London station BBC GLR, taking over from Nick Abbot on the breakfast show. At the time GLR was being run by future Radio 1 controller Matthew Bannister and future Radio 1 executive Trevor Dann. In 1991 Long left the breakfast show of her own volition but continued to work for the station, where she took over a weekend show. In addition to this, she was heard presenting and producing occasional shows on the old BBC Radio 5. Long became involved with Radio X in London when it had a restricted service licence, and played a crucial part in its bid for a permanent licence. Crash FM In 1995, Long moved back up to Liverpool, where she set up her own radio station Crash FM. With support from Bob Geldof, Boy George and Primal Scream amongst others, she put together an RSL and a successful bid for a permanent licence. ===BBC Radio 2=== In 1999, Long started appearing on BBC Radio 2, presenting a Saturday afternoon show from 3 pm to 6 pm. In April 2000, she began as a weekday presenter. She hosted originally from Birmingham but since April 2008 from BBC Radio 2 studios in London. Long has promoted a number of acts through live music sessions on her show, from Adele, the Zutons, Primal Scream, Kasabian, Amy McDonald, Hard Fi, Faithless, the Manic Street Preachers, Marillion, Josh Ritter, the Stranglers, Paul Weller, Morrissey, Moby, the Dandy Warhols, Stereophonics, Aslan and a significant number of new and unsigned bands such as Elle S'Appelle, Vijay Kishore, Damien Dempsey, Senses and Sam Isaac. Amy Winehouse performed her first radio session after Long was the first presenter to give her airtime. From late 2007, Long began to champion her listeners under the group name 'the two percenters'. This came about due to a word choice game that employed tricks to produce the same answer for all that played it. However, most of the listeners to Janice Long did not produce the intended answer and thus were said to fall into the 'two percent category' of people for whom the game does not work. In January 2010, due to a reorganisation of the breakfast schedule on Radio 2, her show was cut to two hours, and ran from midnight to 2 am, Monday to Friday. At the time Long was earning £137,000 a year. In her Spoken Words Session in April 2014 she interviewed John Walsh on the rerelease of his lost Henry VIII film Monarch. With the announcement of the new After Midnight programme on Radio 2 from October 2014, the show was on Mondays to Thursdays, midnight to 3 am. Long left Radio 2 after further changes to its schedule. Her final show was on 26 January 2017. She returned to Radio 2 standing in for Jo Whiley for a week commencing 10 April 2017. === BBC Radio 6 Music === From the station's founding and launch in 2002 to 2004 Long presented the Dream Ticket on BBC Radio 6 Music, which aired from 10 pm to midnight five days a week, with a Saturday and Sunday early morning follow-up from 6 am to 8 am. ===BBC WM and BBC Radio Wales=== As well as a daily show on Radio 2, Long presented for a time on BBC WM on Saturday mornings from 9 am to noon, but left in July 2010. On 28 March 2017 the BBC announced that she would start presenting a new evening show on BBC Radio Wales from 22 May, airing Mondays to Thursdays from 7:00pm–10:00pm. She took time away from the programme from 11 December 2017 following the death of her younger brother, Keith Chegwin. Adam Walton stood in for Long during her absence. She returned to the show on 18 December 2017. ===Greatest Hits Radio=== In addition to her show on BBC Radio Wales, from February 2020, Long started a Saturday afternoon show 1pm-4pm, on the DAB station Greatest Hits Radio, and on AM and FM across the UK as part of the Bauer Media brand. Long's show is broadcast from Radio City Tower in Liverpool, amid schedule changes at the station including the hiring of her BBC colleagues Alex Lester, Simon Mayo, and Paul Gambaccini. ==Other work== Long has appeared on the X Factor, Countdown and The Biography Channel, and provides the voiceover for the documentary Desperate Midwives on BBC Three television channel. She was one of the personalities at the Live Aid concert in 1985, in which she mainly interviewed the performers backstage. In the mid-'90s she presented a programme on the BBC World Service which was a mix of science and popular music called Pop Science. Long won The Weakest Link DJ celebrity special, shown on BBC One on 5 September 2009. She also presented The Janice Long Review Show on Vintage TV. She currently hosts The 2ube on local TV station Made in Liverpool (Sky 117, Freeview 7, Virgin Media 159). ==Personal life== Janice Chegwin married Trevor Long in Liverpool in 1977 and they divorced in 1982.

Mesopotamian Arabic, also known as South Mesopotamian Arabic and Iraqi Arabic, is a continuum of mutually-intelligible varieties of Arabic native to the Mesopotamian basin of Iraq as well as spanning into Syria,Arabic, Mesopotamian  Ethnologue Iran, southeastern Turkey,Arabic, North Mesopotamian  Ethnologue and spoken in Iraqi diaspora communities. Mesopotamian Arabic has an Aramaic Syriac substrate, and also shares significant influences from ancient Mesopotamian languages of Akkadian, Sumerian and Babylonian, as well as Persian, Turkish, Kurdish and Greek. Mesopotamian Arabic is said to be the most Aramaic-Syriac influenced dialect of Arabic, due to Aramaic-Syriac having originated in Mesopotamia, and spread throughout the Middle East (Fertile Crescent) during the Neo-Assyrian period, eventually becoming the lingua franca of the entire region before Islam. Iraqi Arabs and Assyrians are the largest Semitic peoples in Iraq, sharing significant similarities in language between Mesopotamian Arabic and Syriac. ==History== Aramaic was the lingua franca in Mesopotamia from the early 1st millennium BCE until the late 1st millennium CE, and as may be expected, Iraqi Arabic shows signs of an Aramaic substrate. The Gelet and the Judeo-Iraqi varieties have retained features of Babylonian Aramaic. Due to Iraq's inherent multiculturalism as well as history, Iraqi Arabic in turn bears extensive borrowings in its lexicon from Aramaic, Akkadian, Persian, Turkish, the Kurdish languages and Hindustani. The inclusion of Mongolian and other Turkic elements in the Iraqi Arabic dialect should also be mentioned, because of the political role a succession of Turco- Mongol dynasties played after Mesopotamia was invaded by Mongol-Turkic colonizers in 1258 that made Iraq became part of Ilkhanate (Iraq is the only Arab country that was influenced by Mongols), and also because of the prestige Iraqi Arabic dialect and literature enjoyed in the part of Arab world, which was often ruled by sultans and emirs with a Turkic background. ==Phonology== ===Vowels=== ===Consonants=== ==Varieties== Mesopotamian Arabic has two major varieties. A distinction is recognised between Gelet Mesopotamian Arabic and Qeltu Mesopotamian Arabic, the names deriving from the form of the word for \\"I said\\". The southern (Gelet) group includes a Tigris dialect cluster, of which the best-known form is Baghdadi Arabic, and a Euphrates dialect cluster, known as Furati (Euphrates Arabic). The Gelet variety is also spoken in the Khuzestan Province of Iran.

Cypriot Arabic shares a large number of common features with Mesopotamian Arabic; particularly the northern variety, and has been reckoned as belonging to this dialect area. ==See also== * Varieties of Arabic * North Mesopotamian Arabic * Baghdad Arabic ==References== Category:Arabic languages Category:Mashriqi Arabic Category:Languages of Iraq Category:Languages of Iran Category:Languages of Syria Category:Languages of Turkey Arabic, Mesopotamian ","title":"Mesopotamian Arabic"},{"id":"1439872","text":"Annie Avril Nightingale (born 1 April 1940) is an English radio and television broadcaster. She was the first female presenter on BBC Radio 1 in 1970, and is its longest-serving presenter. ==Early life and career== She was born in Osterley, Middlesex, the daughter of Celia and Basil Nightingale. After attending St Catherine's School, Twickenham,People of Today 2017, ed. Lucy Hume, Debrett's Ltd, 2017. Lady Eleanor Holles School, Hampton, Middlesex (by scholarship), and the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster) School of Journalism, Nightingale began her career as a journalist in Brighton, East Sussex. Nightingale began her career as a journalist, broadcaster, columnist, TV host and fashion boutique owner, embracing the revolutionary years of her youth in the 1960s and 1970s amid the leading characters The Beatles, Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, David Bowie, The Byrds, The Beach Boys, leading pop artists and writers. In the 1960s and 1970s, she wrote columns for the Daily Express, the Daily Sketch, Petticoat and Cosmopolitan magazine. She broke through the no-women DJs ban at BBC Radio 1 in 1970 and has remained a broadcaster there ever since. Nightingale has specialised in championing new and underground music, she has also led the movement and encouraged other women to become DJs and broadcasters. Annie is the world's first female DJ on the BBC. She is BBC Radio 1’s longest serving broadcaster and holds the Guinness Book Of Records Award for the longest ever running radio show. ==Presenter and writer== Her first broadcast on the BBC was on 14 September 1963 as a panellist on Juke Box Jury, and she contributed to Woman's Hour in 1964 and hosted programmes on the BBC Light Programme in 1966. She started at BBC Radio 1 on 8 February 1970 with a Sunday evening show. The show was short-lived and in April she became one of the hosts of the singles review show What's New before graduating to a late-night progressive rock show, which was simulcast on the BBC Radio 2's FM frequency. In the mid-to late 1970s, she presented a Sunday-afternoon request show, and in the early 1980s she presented a Friday night show and the non- music-based Radio 1 Mailbag and Talkabout. In 1978, Nightingale became the main presenter of The Old Grey Whistle Test on BBC2 as a replacement for long- time host Bob Harris. During her tenure, the show moved away from its traditional bias under Harris towards country music, blues rock and progressive rock and embraced popular modern styles such as punk rock and new wave. She left the series in 1982. She had begun The Sunday Request Show in September 1975, originally on Sunday afternoons until the end of 1979. It began its second and most famous run in December 1982, for most of its run in a slot immediately after the Top 40. The show was one of the first on British radio to regularly play music from CDs, taking advantage of its FM carriage before BBC Radio 1 had its own higher-quality frequencies. A gimmick was to allow the intro of the first song in the show to play uninterrupted before saying \\"Hi\\" in the very last second before the vocals started. In 1994, Nightingale moved to a weekend overnight dance music show initially called The Chill Out Zone. She can still be heard in the early hours of Friday, later Wednesday mornings on BBC Radio 1 BBC Radio 1Xtra and BBC Asian Network. From the mid 2000s she hosted a breaks show, often featuring major breaks DJs such as Plump DJs, Freestylers, Noisia and Meat Katie. Until embracing the Trap scene and certainly had her hand in popularising the genre. Nightingale regularly DJs live at clubs and festivals around the UK and Europe. As a DJ, Nightingale has travelled and performed all over the world from Ibiza to Paris, New York, Los Angeles, Austin, Barcelona, Warsaw and at major European festivals such as Sziget in Budapest, Roskilde in Denmark as well as at all the major British festivals such as Glastonbury, Bestival, Wickerman, Rockness, Lovebox, Kendal Calling and numerous others. She has also broadcast TV and Radio documentaries during visits to Russia, Romania, Iraq, Chile, The Philippines, USA, France, Ibiza, Japan, China, India and Cuba. At the same time she has become a regular contributor to BBC Four news programmes such as The Today Programme, The World At One and The World This Weekend. While in Havana in 1996, she was injured during a mugging, resulting in multiple injuries requiring an air-lift to a London hospital, since which she has worn the distinctive shades, now part of her image. In 2002, Nightingale was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire for her services to radio broadcasting. The award recognised her in-depth coverage of the radio scene. In 2004, she was the first female DJ from Radio 1 to be inducted into the Radio Academy Hall of Fame. Nightingale has published two autobiographical books: Chase The Fade (1981) and Wicked Speed (1999) . She has compiled three albums: Annie on One (1996, Heavenly Recordings), in which she included the then unsigned and undiscovered Daft Punk, her own instalment of the Breaks DJ mix series Y4K (2007, Distinctive Records), and 'Masterpiece' on the Ministry of Sound compilation series of that name (July 2015) On 30 September 2007, the 40th anniversary of BBC Radio 1 was celebrated, Nightingale co-hosted a special return of the Request Show with Annie Mac featuring contributions from musicians such as Paul McCartney and Chemical Ed, excerpts from the original show and Nightingale's recollections of regular contributors such as \\"Night Owl of Croydon\\". The show featured many classic tracks which had been requested over the years and closed with one of Nightingale's favourites, Cristina's version of \\"Is That All There Is?\\". A version of The Smiths song \\"Panic\\" interpreted by Mancunian cult comedian Frank Sidebottom dedicates its choruses to \\"Anne the DJ\\" (in place of the original song's \\"Hang the DJ\\") and asks \\"Anne Nightingale what's your blinking game; I waited for your roadshow, but your roadshow never came\\". In 2014, she appeared in The Life of Rock with Brian Pern as herself. On 20 May 2011, she was featured in the BBC Four documentary Annie Nightingale: Bird on the Wireless, documenting her life and passion for music. The film has been shown a total of 3 times on BBC Four and it features tributes from Paul Weller and Tinie Tempah and interviews with Paul McCartney, Mani from The Stone Roses and Primal Scream, DJ Starscream and The Clash’s Mick Jones. In 2011 Nightingale won the Best Radio Award for the sixth year running at the International Breakbeat Awards, and the BBC A&M; award for the mammoth A Night With Annie Nightingale on BBC Radio 1. Nightingale was made an honorary Doctor of Letters at the University of Westminster in December 2012. She is an ambassador at Prince Charles’ The Prince's Trust and a patron of Sound Women, an organisation to promote women in broadcasting. In 2011 The BBC launched its new BBC Archive Centre and named one of its vaults after Annie Nightingale, where she is in the company of Michael Palin and Sir David Frost. In 2013, Nightingale was featured in the BBC Radio 4 programme Getting on Air: the Female Pioneers, presented by Jane Garvey. In 2015, it was revealed that Nightingale had been approached by the BBC to sign a letter warning Prime Minister David Cameron that his plans to reform the corporation would damage it. Nightingale, one of the letter's 29 signatories, revealed later on that she had not read the letter prior to signing it. In 2015, she was commissioned by Paul McCartney to write the accompanying fully illustrated book as part of the deluxe re-release of his classic albums Tug Of War and Pipes Of Peace. In the same year she appeared at ITV's gala spectacular The Nation's Favourite: The Beatles No One. In July 2020, Annie appeared as a guest on the long-running BBC Radio 4 show \\"Desert Island Discs,\\" choosing a saxophone as her luxury item and \\"Space Oddity\\" as the one track she would save in the event of a tropical storm. Already Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), Nightingale was also appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to radio broadcasting. She is the only BBC Radio 1 broadcaster ever to receive this honour. ==50th Anniversary at Radio 1 & Radio 2== This year Annie Nightingale celebrates her 50th anniversary in broadcasting with a series of BBC specials, and a compilation album on Ministry Of Sound. This features tracks by the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney who have never before granted permission for their music to appear on compilations. Annie's 50th anniversary at Radio 1 will be marked by two documentaries on BBC TV and the release of her new memoir on 3 September 2020, published by White Rabbit Books, an imprint of Weidenfeld & Nicolson. The book looks at pop culture and social history over five decades, covering never before seen interviews with artists ranging from the Beatles to Billie Eilish, and includes Bob Marley, Marc Bolan, Primal Scream, the Streets, Dusty Springfield, Keith Moon, Elvis Costello, Little Simz and more. The memoir covers Annie's 50 years at BBC Radio 1, having been the first female DJ, she is now also the longest serving broadcaster on the station of any gender. The book also contains recollections of Paris in the 1950s, early raves in London, the Falklands War of the 1980s and the LA Riots of 1992. ==Radio 2== In April 2012, Nightingale presented a show on BBC Radio 2 called Annie Nightingale's Eternal Jukebox. She has continued presenting this on an occasional basis, usually on bank holidays. The Eternal Jukebox showcases \\"enjoyably unexpected musical pairings.\\" Listeners are invited to suggest a song and Annie pairs it up with another song often of a different genre and suggests a link between the two songs. On 25 June 2012, she also presented a documentary for BBC Radio 2 called Is It Worth It?, about the Falklands Conflict. It was described on the Radio 2 website as \\"30 years on from the Falklands conflict, Annie Nightingale considers the impact of the war through the song Shipbuilding.\\" Nightingale returned to BBC Radio 2 on 1 January 2014 for another one-off show entitled Annie Nightingale: Whatever Next?, broadcast between 8pm and 10pm. The show featured a variety of genres from the seven decades from the 1950s onwards. ==References== ==External links== * *Annie Nightingale presents...

Its principal business is operating guided tours of New York City from its base at Pier 83 in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood. ==History== Circumnavigation of Manhattan became possible in 1905 with the construction of the Harlem Ship Canal, the first regularly scheduled trip being the Tourist captained by John Roberts in 1908. On June 15, 1945 Frank Barry, Joe Moran and other partners merged several companies to form Circle-Line Sightseeing Yachts, offering boat tours of New York operating out of Battery Park. Circle Line cruise, 1973. Photo by Arthur Tress. The Circle Line XVII touring the Harlem River In 1955 it began operating at Pier 83 in Midtown. In 1962 it bought the famous and venerable Hudson River Day Line, keeping it as a separate brand until 1985. Fireworks at Pier 83 in 2006. In 1981, the Circle Line split into two companies--Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises and Circle Line Downtown. In 1988 the company bought World Yacht's operating upscale dining cruises from Chelsea Piers - currently World Yacht Dining Cruises. In 1998 the 42nd Street company also launched The Beast, a speedboat ride which takes tourists around the Statue of Liberty and goes 45 mph. In 2007, the United States National Park Service said it was going to terminate Circle Line Liberty franchise and give a 10-year contract to Hornblower Cruises which provides service to Alcatraz. It was noted in the announcement that since 1953 Circle Line has transported 70 million people to Liberty Island. Among the items cited in the transfer was a newer fleet (although Hornblower will have to buy the Circle Line boats) and the possibility of new service to Gateway National Recreation Area. The New York Times reported on December 8, 2007 that the price of the Circle Line boats to be sold to Hornblower was in arbitration, forcing Hornblower to bring in new boats. In 2009, Circle Line took delivery of the third of three new vessels constructed by Gladding-Hearn Shipbuilding in Somerset, Massachusetts. In January 2017, Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises purchased New York Water Taxi-- among the assets acquired was the latter company's Circle Line Downtown brand, reuniting both Circle Lines under one owner. == Awards == Circle Line was awarded with proclamations by two New York City mayors. In 1985, then Mayor Ed Koch proclaimed April 23 \\"Circle Line Day.\\" Approximately 20 years later current Mayor Mike Bloomberg proclaimed September 17 \\"Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises Day\\" in 2008. == Rescue == Video from 20 minutes after US Airways Flight 1549 landed in the Hudson River, with numerous ferries and rescue boats surrounding the aircraft Coast Guard, FDNY, NYPD, and ferryboats In 2001, Circle Line vessels helped transport victims of the September 11 attacks back to New Jersey. After US Airways Flight 1549 was forced to land in the Hudson River in 2009, Circle Line Sightseeing vessels were among the first to respond. ==Fleet== Currently, Circle Line Sightseeing operates 8 vessels with an additional two under construction, including: *Sightseer XII - commissioned in 1933 as the United States Coast Guard patrol boat Argo, sold in 1955 and later acquired by Circle Line. *Circle Line XVI - commissioned in 1934 as the USCG patrol boat Nike, decommissioned in 1964 and sold to Circle Line in 1966. *Circle Line XVII - commissioned in 1934 as the USCG patrol boat Triton, decommissioned in 1967 and sold to Circle Line in 1973. *Circle Line Manhattan - purpose-built in 2008 to replace Circle Line XI. *Circle Line Brooklyn - purpose-built in 2009. *Circle Line Queens - purpose-built in 2009. *The Beast - speedboat that entered service with Circle Line in 2011. *Circle Line Bronx - built by Gladding-Hearn Shipbuilding and delivered in January 2017. *Circle Line Staten Island - built by Gladding-Hearn Shipbuilding and delivered in May 2017. *Circle Line Liberty - built by Gladding-Hearn Shipbuilding and delivered in March 2018. The Bronx, Staten Island, and Liberty constitute Circle Line's new Empire-class boats, which claim to be state-of-the-art, and include modern amenities like digital screens and improved sound systems. Additionally, while she has been retired from service, the Circle Line X is retained by Circle Line. Circle Line X was originally built for the US Navy in 1944 as a Landing Craft Infantry (Large), designated USS LCI(L)-758. 758 participated in several landings during the Pacific Theater of World War II, including those during the battles of Leyte, Ormoc Bay, Mindoro, and Lingayen Gulf. 758 was decommissioned in 1946 and sold to Circle Line, who converted her into a tourist vessel and renamed her Circle Line X. She served in this role until her retirement in 2007, and as of 2015 Circle Line plans to turn her into a floating museum and terminal alongside Pier 83. == Today == The Beast prepares to cast off Circle Line Sightseeing continues to operate on the Hudson River and is dedicated exclusively to sightseeing. ===Cruise types=== *Full Island Cruise - navigates the entire island of Manhattan. *Semi Circle Cruise - goes through half of the island of Manhattan, circles sights twice. *Liberty Cruise - sails directly past the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. *Harbor Lights Cruise - same route as the Semi Circle cruise at sunset. *The BEAST Speedboat Ride - New York's first speedboat, cruises up to 45 mph on the Hudson to the Statue of Liberty and back. *Special Events Cruises - Santa Cruise, New Year's Eve, etc. *Kids Cruises - cruises themed specifically for kids, often with kids-specific entertainment. *Private Charters *Groups ==References== ==External links== * Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises (official website) Category:Ferries of New York City Category:Ferry companies of New York City Category:Port of New York and New Jersey Category:Travel and holiday companies of the United States Category:Tourism in New York City Category:Transport companies established in 1945 Category:1945 establishments in New York (state) Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises"},{"id":"1439882","text":"The Kentucky Harmony is a shape note tunebook, published in 1816 by Ananias Davisson.

Davisson released four more editions: 1817 (which expanded the book to 160 pages), 1819, 1821 and 1826. The 1817 edition used fewer northern tunes but included more Southern folk melodies; the three subsequent editions made only slight changes to the 1817 edition. The Kentucky Harmony was influenced by the work of John Wyeth and his two \\"Repositories of Sacred Music\\", with 98 of the tunes in Kentucky Harmony also being found in Wyeth's books. But Davisson rarely printed any piece of music exactly as it appeared in the books of others. Unlike some books printed prior to and after it, the Kentucky Harmony consistently contained four part settings for its tunes. Fifty-seven of the 143 tunes of the first edition are fuguing tunes, and the first Southern fuging tunes appear, such as Reubin Monday's \\"New Topia,\\" in which there is call-and-response between dueting voices (alto & bass for 4 measures, followed by treble & tenor for 4 measures), rather than individual voices coming in soon after one another. Roughly 60% of the tunes are minor. The influence of the Kentucky Harmony can be seen in later tunebooks, even as late as Walker's Southern Harmony and B. F. White's Sacred Harp. Irving Lowens considered the Kentucky Harmony \\"one of the most important and influential collections of American folk hymnody ever compiled...\\" Despite the name Kentucky Harmony, Davisson lived most of his life in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. ==References== *Kentucky Harmony.

The song, which is a city dweller's lamentation over the loss of a simpler and freer existence in the hills of Tennessee, is one of Tennessee's ten official state songs and has been recorded by dozens of artists from multiple musical genres worldwide since its publication. In U.S. college athletics, \\"Rocky Top\\" is associated with the Tennessee Volunteers of the University of Tennessee (UT), whose Pride of the Southland Band has played a marching band version of the song at the school's sporting events since the early 1970s. The Osborne Brothers' 1967 bluegrass version of the song reached No. 33 on the U.S. Country charts, and Lynn Anderson's 1970 version peaked at No. 17 on the U.S. Country charts. In 2005, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ranked \\"Rocky Top\\" number seven on its list of 100 Songs of the South.Bryan Perry (producer), Shane Harrison, Sonia Murray, Nick Marino, and Soyia Ellison, 100 Songs of the South. Retrieved: September 20, 2009. ==Background== \\"Rocky Top\\" was written by married songwriting duo Boudleaux Bryant (1920-1987) and Felice Bryant (1925-2003) in 1967. At the time, the Bryants were working at The Gatlinburg Inn in Gatlinburg, Tennessee on a collection of slow-tempo songs for a project for Archie Campbell and Chet Atkins. Writing the fast-paced \\"Rocky Top,\\" which took about 10 minutes to write, served as a temporary diversion for them. While the song became a staple of the Osborne Brothers concerts in the late 1960s, the song did not achieve mass popularity until the early 1970s, when Lynn Anderson's version reached number seventeen on the Billboard Country Top 100. In 1972, UT's Pride of the Southland Band first played the song as part of one of its drills, the idea and arrangement being primarily the work of band arranger Barry MacDonald. The song was deemed popular enough to be played at a halftime country music show by guest saxophone soloist Boots Randolph at a game in Knoxville against Alabama on October 21, 1972, gaining fans' attention. Randolph reprised his jazzy \\"Rocky Top\\" solo when Tennessee played LSU on New Year's Eve, 1972 in the Astro- Bluebonnet Bowl at the Houston Astrodome. UT recognized the song's appeal and the band started playing Rocky Top at every game. Longtime band director W.J. Julian stated that if Rocky Top was ever not played, then there would be a mutiny among Vol fans, reflecting the song's deep-rooted foundation in UT sports.

In the song's opening verse, the singer longs for a place called \\"Rocky Top,\\" where there is no \\"smoggy smoke\\" and there are no \\"telephone bills.\\" The singer reminisces about a love affair he once had on Rocky Top with a woman \\"wild as a mink\\" and \\"sweet as soda pop.\\" The song's second verse recalls a story about two \\"strangers\\" (apparently revenue agents) climbing Rocky Top \\"looking for a moonshine still,\\" but never returning (conflict between moonshiners and \\"revenuers\\" is a common theme in Appalachian culture).For discussion of moonshining in Southern Appalachia, see Horace Kephart's Our Southern Highlanders (1922) and Joseph Dabney's Mountain Spirits (1974). The song says that the soil on Rocky Top is too rocky to grow corn, so the people of Rocky Top \\"get their corn from a jar\\". In the third and final verse (which consists of just four lines), the singer again longs for the \\"simple\\" life, likening life in the city to being \\"trapped like a duck in a pen.\\" ===College fight song=== \\"Rocky Top\\" is a favorite of UT fans, alumni, and others who sing it while the Vols play at Neyland Stadium and Thompson–Boling Arena. House of Bryant has granted the University of Tennessee a perpetual license to play the song as much and as often as success on the field dictates.

However, UT's official fight song is \\"Down the Field\\".University of Tennessee -- Songs of Tennessee . Retrieved: September 20, 2009. Regardless of its lack of official status, in 2015, \\"Rocky Top\\" was designated the #1 fight song in college football, based on a \\"cumulative data-based ranking of America's most engaged fan bases\\" by USA Today. One Tennessee tradition related to the song and similar to that of other schools is to have the team's quarterback conduct the marching band in performing the song after a big win, with Peyton Manning popularizing the tradition when he was Tennessee quarterback.Rocky Top (University of Tennessee Feature) YouTube ===Location of Rocky Top=== Rocky Top and the Appalachian Trail While the Bryants never indicated that \\"Rocky Top, Tennessee\\" refers to a specific place, some have suggested that a barren summit known as \\"Rocky Top\\"-- located in the Great Smoky Mountains along the Tennessee-North Carolina border-- is the best fit, due in large part to its proximity to Gatlinburg, where the song was written.Robert Silvers, \\"Hit Song Born at Gatlinburg Inn.\\" Saturday Evening Post, June 26, 2009.

The name \\"Rocky Top\\" is sometimes used as a nickname for East Tennessee, the city of Knoxville, and the University of Tennessee (especially its two major athletic venues, Neyland Stadium and the Thompson–Boling Arena). \\"Rocky Top\\" is also a popular name for East Tennessee businesses, among them a real estate agency and a chain of convenience stores. In 2014, Rocky Top became a true geographic place name after Lake City, Tennessee changed its name to Rocky Top after an effort by the House of Bryant to enjoin the city was denied by a federal court. ===Operation Rocky Top=== \\"Operation Rocky Top\\" was the FBI's code name for a public corruption investigation into the Tennessee state government in the late 1980s which resulted in the eventual suicide of the Tennessee Secretary of State, Gentry Crowell, and the incarceration of several other individuals, most notably state House Majority Leader Tommy Burnett. The focus of the investigation was the illegal sale of bingo licenses. ==Notable covers== Phish played \\"Rocky Top\\" regularly from 1987 to 2003 and, after reforming, again in 2009. There have been additional cover versions of the song by artists such as The Schwag, Dillard and Clark and country artists such as Buck Owens, Lynn Anderson, Dolly Parton, John Denver, Albert Lee, Conway Twitty, Billie Jo Spears, Dottie West, and John Stewart. Columbus, Ohio-based all-female rock trio Scrawl, included a cover of the song on their Nashville-recorded 1988 album \\"He's Drunk\\". Many contemporary groups and artists have performed the song while performing in Knoxville, including Rascal Flatts, Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, and Dierks Bentley. The country rock group the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band tackled the song on their 1976 compilation album Dirt, Silver and Gold. The 2011 pilot episode of NBC's sitcom Up All Night featured Christina Applegate and Will Arnett singing \\"Rocky Top.\\" The song is also frequently played in multiple parks at Walt Disney World, including the Magic Kingdom, and by the Liberty Singers at Epcot. ==See also== *Good Old Mountain Dew ==References== Category:1967 singles Category:1970 singles Category:Appalachian culture Category:Southeastern Conference fight songs Category:Osborne Brothers songs Category:Lynn Anderson songs Category:Music of East Tennessee Tennessee Category:Tennessee Volunteers and Lady Volunteers Category:Tennessee culture Category:Songs written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant Category:Songs about Tennessee ","title":"Rocky Top"},{"id":"1439909","text":"Westmoreland is the westernmost parish in Jamaica, located on the south side of the island. It is situated south of Hanover, southwest of Saint James, and northwest of Saint Elizabeth, in the county of Cornwall. The chief town and capital is Savanna-la-Mar. Negril, a famous tourist destination, is also situated in the parish. ==History== The earliest inhabitants of Westmoreland were the Arawak and Ciboney Indians. The Ciboney were first to arrive, from the coast of South America, around 500 BC. Known as \\"cave dwellers\\", they lived along the cliffs of Negril. The labyrinth of caves and passageways beneath what is now the Xtabi Hotel in Negril are one of the first known settlements of Ciboney Indians in Jamaica. Christopher Columbus stopped at what became Westmoreland on his second voyage when he landed in Jamaica. One of the first Spanish settlements was also built at present-day Bluefields in this parish. The English took over the island from Spanish rule in 1655. Colonists named the parish Westmoreland in 1703, for it was the most westerly point of the island. In 1730, Savanna-la-Mar, a coastal port, was designated to replace Banbury as the capital of the parish. A fort was built in the 1700s to defend the port against pirates. Today it is one of the historic sites of the parish. The name Westmoreland appears to stem from Dr John Drummond (1744-1804) who had several plantations on the island (foremost being the Drummond Estate) plus vast lands at Savanna-la-Mar which had been owned by his parents. He was surgeon to the Westmoreland Regiment of Foot from 1784. This British regiment was officially on the island from 1802 to 1813 but the name appears to pre-date this, for John Drummond refers to his \\"Westmoreland estate\\" in his will of 1793. In 1938, riots at the Frome sugar estate changed the course of Jamaica's history. In the wake of these riots, the legislature passed legislation for universal adult suffrage in 1944, as well as a new constitution, which was approved by the Crown. This put Jamaica on the road to self-government and eventually independence. The two national heroes, Sir Alexander Bustamante and Norman Washington Manley, emerged as political leaders during this time. ==Geography== Westmoreland has an area of , making it Jamaica's eighth-largest parish. Westmoreland's population of 144,817 is made up of a large percentage of ethnic East Indians, descendants of indentured laborers who came to Jamaica from India to work after Britain abolished slavery in 1833 and the demand for labor remained high. Many intermarried with people of African descent, and the multi-racial descendants are known locally as \\"half indian\\". There are over of morass land, the largest part of which is called the Great Morass. This contains plant and animal material collected over centuries. The morass can be mined as peat, an excellent source of energy. The marsh serves as a natural and unique sanctuary for a wide variety of Jamaican wildlife and birds. The remaining area consists of several hills of moderate elevation, and alluvial plains along the coast. Numerous rivers run through the parish. The Cabaritta River, which is 39.7 km long, drains the George's Plain and can accommodate ships weighing up to eight tons. Other rivers include the Negril, New Savanna, Morgan's, Gut, Smithfield, Bowens, Bluefields, Robins, Roaring, Great and Dean. The westernmost tip of the island, Negril Point, is the site of the Negril Lighthouse. ==Commerce== As a result of the fertile plains, the parish thrives on agriculture, mainly sugarcane, which offers direct employment. Other agricultural products include bananas, coffee, ginger, cocoa, pimento, honey, rice, and breadfruit. Pastoralism is also practised; the rearing of cattle, horses, and mules, as well as fishing—there are 19 fishing beaches with over 90 boats engaged in the industry. Manufacturing is the third largest sector. Manufactured items include food and drink, tobacco, animal feeds, textile and textile products. Negril is one of the main tourist destinations in Jamaica. Since the 1950s tourism has been the fastest-growing sector. The major hotels are Couples Swept Away (the northern half of which is technically in Hanover),UK Directorate of Overseas Surveys 1:50,000 map of Jamaica sheet A, 1959 Poinciana Beach Resort and Negril Beach Club.

Taylor (1925–1965), a naval aviator who was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously for his heroism in the Vietnam War. ==Construction== Taylors keel was laid down by Bath Iron Works Corp., Bath, Maine, on May 5, 1983. She was launched November 5, 1983, and commissioned December 1, 1984 in Bath, Maine. Taylor was sponsored by Barbara A. Taylor, the widow of the ship's namesake, and Diane Taylor-Oeland as matron of honor. ==History== Taylor was homeported in Charleston, South Carolina, from 1985 to 1993. The ship deployed to Northern Europe as part of the Standing Naval Forces Atlantic in 1987, and the Persian Gulf in 1988 and 1990. She participated in Operation Earnest Will. In 1993, Taylor changed homeport to Mayport, Florida, with the closing of Charleston Naval Station. Up to 2015, Taylor was homeported at Naval Station Mayport, and was part of Destroyer Squadron 14. In August 2008, Taylor entered the Black Sea conducting a pre-planned routine visit to the region to interact and exercise with NATO partners Romania and Bulgaria. It joined ships from Poland, Germany and Spain. In September 2010, Taylor was buzzed by a Russian Tu-95 bomber.

Population: ==Etymology== The place name is said to have originated from the Mordvin ksty, meaning \\"strawberry\\". ==History== The village of Kstovo was mentioned as early as the 14th century. With the construction of Novogorkovsky Oil Refinery, which started operations on August 18, 1958,. Translated from Khimiya i Tekhnologiya Topliv i Masel, No. 8, pp. 1–4, August 1968) a new settlement was built a few kilometers to the northwest of the old village of Kstovo, on the high ground between the Volga and the Kudma Rivers. Since then, the western part of the town centered on the original village of Kstovo, and, still quite rural in character, has been commonly referred to as the Old Kstovo (Staroye Kstovo), while the newer eastern part, built in the 1950s and still expanding, is known as the New Kstovo (Novoye Kstovo). As the New Kstovo expanded over the years, it completely or partially displaced several smaller villages. Kstovo was granted urban-type settlement status in 1954 and town status in 1957. ==Administrative and municipal status== Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kstovo serves as the administrative center of Kstovsky District.Order #3-od As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Kstovsky District as the town of district significance of Kstovo. As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Kstovo is incorporated within Kstovsky Municipal District as Kstovo Urban Settlement.Law #169-Z ==Economy== The heat and power plant is located in the industrial area south of the town and can be seen from many apartments Kstovo's main industrial zone is located south of the town, on the southern side of the Kudma River. It is centered on the petrochemical plants of Lukoil- Nizhegorodnefteorgsintez (formerly NORSI-Oil and Novogorkovsky Oil Refinery), a subsidiary of Lukoil, which is the town's main employer, and, historically, the reason for the town's existence. The \\"BVK\\" plant, which started operation in 1973 and was closed in 2003, used n-paraffins (produced by the oil refinery nearby) as feed for yeast, in order to produce the so-called \\"protein and vitamin concentrate\\" (single-cell protein) for use as animal food.Soviet Plant to Convert Oil to Protein for Feed; Use of Yeast Involved, By THEODORE SHABAD. the New York Times, November 10, 1973.RusVinyl – Summary of Social Issues (EBRD) The facility was originally run by the Soviet Ministry of Microbiological Industry.Первенец микробиологической промышленности (Microbiological industry's first plant), in: Станислав Марков (Stanislav Markov) «Кстово- молодой город России» (Kstovo, Russia's Young Town) As of 1990, it produced some 300,000 tons of its product per year.\\"Practitioners' forum perestroika and soviet biotechnology\\".

A cogeneration power plant supplies electricity into the regional electric grid (305 MWt) and hot water for heating town apartment buildings. In November 2008, the local power company announced its plans to increase the power plant's electricity production capacity to 605 MWt; the new power generation unit was scheduled to be brought online by the end of 2011. The town has a large farmer's market, and a decent selection of supermarkets and retail stores. ===Transportation=== Kstovo is served by the Moscow–Nizhny Novgorod–Kazan Highway (M7), a river tanker port on the Volga, an electric railway branch, and a number of oil and oil-product pipelines, such as the Sever Pipeline. The town has a history of building bypass roads to keep some of the transit traffic (either the east-west traffic on M7, or traffic headed for the petrochemical industrial area south of the town) off the town streets, only to see the development overtake them a decade or so later, the \\"bypass\\" not being a true bypass anymore. Most recently, in 2003 a highway bypass was completed a few kilometers south of the town (cutting through a section of the Zelyony Gorod forest) both taking M7 away from the town and providing convenient road access to the Lukoil area. The Kstovo railway branch is primarily used to serve the needs of the oil refinery. Although commuter trains from Nizhny Novgorod's Myza terminal stop not far from both the Old and the New Kstovo, the stations are not particularly conveniently located. Throughout most of the town's history, commuter trains were fairly slow and only ran two or three times a day, and thus were popular mostly with retirees and other persons eligible for free or discount fares. Around 2011 or 2012, the passenger rail service to Kstovo was discontinued altogether.Кстово просит электрички. Железной дороге предложили совместный проект (Kstovo asks for commuter trains. A joint project has been proposed to the railway) Gudok, No. 43, 2013-11-22. As of 2013, the local authorities have proposed the resumption of the commuter rail service between Nizhny Novgorod and Kstovo; the proposal includes the construction of a new, more conveniently located passenger station in Kstovo, as well as straightening of the railway line. A commuter train in Kstovo Volga hydrofoil boats used to stop at Kstovo in the 1970s and 1980s, but the town no longer appears in the boat schedules. Therefore, most of passenger travel between Kstovo and Nizhny Novgorod is by road. Commuter buses and routed taxis to Nizhny Novgorod, as well as suburban buses to villages throughout Kstovsky District, run from a bus station on the west side of New Kstovo. Some long-distance buses between Nizhny Novgorod and the destinations to the east (Lyskovo, Cheboksary, etc.) stop there as well. There are also shuttle buses from Kstovo's Lenina Square to the Mega shopping mall in Fedyakovo, in the western part of Kstovsky District. Most summers, during the beach season, ferry boat service operates between Kstovo and the beach area on the north bank of the Volga. ==Education== The Military Engineering College An Oil Industry Community College trains skilled workers and technicians for the petrochemical industry. Nizhny Novgorod Technological University offers evening classes in Kstovo for the students studying in its distance education chemical engineering program.Nizhny Novgorod Technical University, Kstovo Branch (Accessed 2006 October 24) . Nizhny Novgorod Military Engineering College, founded in 1801 in St. Petersburg and moved in 1960 to Kaliningrad, received its current name in 1995, when it was transferred to Kstovo.Colonel (retired) Boris Mikhailovoch Denisov, \\"Forgotten Anniversary\\". \\"Russky Pereplet\\" magazine, November 3, 2006 ==Culture and recreation== The town has a puppet theater, a Palace of Culture, a public library, and an active chess club. The movie theater was popular with the residents during the Soviet era, but closed down after the advent of home video. Part of its premises were used by an Eldorado electronics store for a few years in the early 2000s. Indoor water park Atoll was opened in February 2015 in Kstovo's Lenin Square. This is the first facility of this kind in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, and is intended to serve the entire Nizhny Novgorod metropolitan area.Кстовский аквапарк \\"Атолл\\" готовится к росту загрузки.

Its origins go back to 1964, when the first local Sambo club was formed. In October 1976, a Sambo School building was opened on the western edge of the town; in 1995, in time for the Sambo World Cup, a new, taller building was constructed next to it, the facility becoming known as the \\"World Academy of Sambo\\".\\"Михаил Бурдиков: После оглушительных успехов наших самбистов иностранные журналисты долго пытались отыскать на карте мира маленький город Кстово\\" (An article on the history of Sambo in Kstovo) (RIA Kreml, November 2004) ==Religion== The Church of Our Lady of Kazan in Old Kstovo Christians are served by four Orthodox churches in the town and immediately adjacent villages. The Church of Our Lady of Kazan in Old Kstovo was built in the late 19th century, closed during the Soviet era, when its building was used for a printshop, and re- opened in the early 1990s. A new church of St Sergius of Radonezh, located halfway between the Old and New Kstovo was completed in 2016 and consecrated on September 14, 2016.14 сентября в городе Кстово митрополит Нижегородский и Арзамасский Георгий освятит храм во имя преподобного Сергия Радонежского Closer to the town center is another Church of Our Lady of Kazan. Although it can be seen from many apartment buildings on Kstovo's new northeast side, this historic building (constructed in 1792 and is now protected as a heritage site) is actually located in the nearby village of Veliky Vrag just northeast of the town.

Many pubs are centuries old, from a time when their customers were often illiterate, but could recognise pictorial signs. Pub names have a variety of origins, from objects used as simple identification marks to the coats of arms of kings or local aristocrats and landowners. Other names come from historic events, livery companies, and occupations or craftsmen's guilds. Unlike Ireland, where the names of pubs tend to be based on the name of the owner, or a former owner, in mainland Britain this has been unusual, probably because pubs wanted names that could be related to an image on their pub sign, a key means of identifying them in an age of restricted literacy. In Australia a high proportion of older pubs have names ending in \\"hotel\\", and generally their names reflect hotel naming conventions. ==Methodology== Although the word \\"the\\" appears on much pub signage, it is ignored in the following examples; the word \\"ye' is likewise ignored as it is only an archaic spelling of \\"the\\". \\"Y\\" represents an obsolete character (þ, the letter Thorn, which is nowadays used only in Icelandic) for the th sound. Its later forms resembled a blackletter y, and it was never pronounced with a y sound. Similarly, other archaic spellings such as \\"olde worlde\\" are not distinguished below. ==Animals== Names like Fox and Hounds, Dog and Duck, Dog and Gun, Hare and Hounds, etc., refer to shooting and hunting. Animal names coupled with colours, such as White Hart and Red Lion, are often heraldic. A white hart featured as a badge of King Richard II, while a red lion was a badge of John of Gaunt and a blue boar of the Earls of Oxford. Dolphin, Wisbech, Isle of Ely (now closed), dolphins were caught and presented to the lord of the manor in earlier times, however it may just be a nautical reference to the port. The Black Bear, Walsoken actually had a black bear (stuffed) at the entrance to the premises years ago. ==Branding== Some pub chains in the UK adopt the same or similar names for many pubs as a means of brand expression. The principal examples of this are \\"The Moon Under Water\\", commonly used by the JD Wetherspoon chain (and inspired by George Orwell's 1946 essay in the Evening Standard, \\"The Moon Under Water\\"), and the \\"Tap and Spile\\" brand name used by the now defunct Century Inns chain. The \\"Slug and Lettuce\\" is another example of a chain of food-based pubs with a prominent brand; founder Hugh Corbett had owned a small number of pubs, to which he gave humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. ==Found objects== The 'Crooked Billet', Worsthorne, Lancashire Before painted inn signs became commonplace, medieval publicans often identified their establishments by hanging or standing a distinctive object outside the pub. This tradition dates back to Roman times, when vine leaves were hung outside tabernae to show where wine was sold. * Boot * Copper Kettle * Crooked Billet (a bent branch from a tree) Sometimes the object was coloured, such as Blue Post or Blue Door. ==Heraldry== The ubiquity of the naming element arms shows how important heraldry has been in the naming of pubs. The simpler symbols of the heraldic badges of royalty or local nobility give rise to many of the most common pub names. Five common colours are gules (red); sable (black); azure (blue); vert(green); and purpure (purple). The metals are or (gold) and argent (silver), although in practice they are usually depicted as yellow and white. ===Items appearing in coats of arms=== * Antlers: although this is often seen as a derivation of Richard II's white hart emblem, it may also be an echo of a pagan figure, Herne the Hunter. * Bear and Ragged Staff: a badge of the earls of Warwick. Refers to bear baiting (see Dog and Bear in the Sports section). * Black Griffin: a pub in Lisvane, Cardiff, named after the coat of arms carried by the lords of the manor. * Old Black Lion is the name of an ancient pub opposite the railway station in Northampton. * Blue Boar, the name of many pubs in Westminster, Norwich, Billericay, Maldon, Witney and elsewhere, from the badge of the Earls of Oxford. * Castle: sometimes originally referred to the Coat of Arms of Castile in Spain, and meant that Spanish wines were available within. * Checkers or Chequers: often derived from the coat of arms of a local landowner (see Chequy), this name and sign originated in ancient Rome when a chequer board indicated that a bar also provided banking services. The checked board was used as an aid to counting and is the origin of the word exchequer. The last pub to use the older, now American spelling of checker was in Baldock, Hertfordshire, but this closed circa 1990; all pubs now use the modern \\"q\\" spelling (but see also Chequers, in Plants and horticulture below). * Cross Keys, Wisbech, derived from the town's coat of arms and the town's church of SS. Peter & Paul. * Eagle and Child, Oxford, derived from the arms of the Earls of Derby, was a meeting place of the Inklings. * Elephant and Castle: apocryphally a corruption of the words \\"Infanta of Castile\\", more probably taken from the crest of the Cutlers' Company. * Lamb and Flag: a common religious symbol, with the Agnus Dei holding the red cross flag that represented the Resurrection of Christ earlier than it was the flag of England. This was the device of the Middle Temple, a legal society in London, which was given a charter in 1608 to occupy lands formerly owned by the Knights Templar. It is one of the four Inns of Court, still training barristers today. The Lamb & Flag (Oxford) is one of many pubs with this name. * Olde Man and Scythe, Bolton, taken from the crest of the Pilkington family. * Ostrich feathers have been used as a royal badge since the time of Edward III, particularly the Three Feathers badge of the Prince of Wales. * Red Dragon of Cadwaladr: the symbol of Wales, and a heraldic badge of Henry VII and many other royal figures. * Red Lion is the name of over 600 pubs. It thus can stand for an archetypal British pub. The lion is one of the most common charges in coats of arms, second only to the cross, and thus the Red Lion as a pub sign probably has multiple origins: in the arms or crest of a local landowner, now perhaps forgotten; as a personal badge of John of Gaunt, founder of the House of Lancaster; or in the royal arms of Scotland, conjoined to the arms of England after the Stuart succession in 1603. * Rising Sun: symbol of the east and of optimism. The Sun in Splendour was also a livery badge of Edward IV * Silver Lion, Lilley, Hertfordshire: from the arms of the Sowerby family. * Spread Eagle: from the heraldic depiction of an eagle 'displayed'; probably derived from the arms of Germany, indicating that German wines were available within. * Swan, a badge of many Lancastrian figures—see Dunstable Swan Jewel * Talbot or Talbot Arms refers to an actual breed of hunting dog, now extinct, which is also a heraldic hound, and is the badge of the Talbot family, Earls of Shrewsbury. Old Talbot, Wisbech (now closed) * Unicorn * White Bear * White Hart: the livery badge of King Richard II of England.

The dynastic conflicts between their descendants are collectively called the Wars of the Roses. In 1485 Henry Tudor, a descendant of Lancaster, defeated Richard III of the York dynasty and married Richard's niece Elizabeth of York. Since then the combined red-and-white Tudor rose, often crowned, has been a symbol of the monarchy of England. A 'Royal Oak' in Fishguard, Wales * Royal Oak: After the Battle of Worcester (1651) in the English Civil War, the defeated Prince Charles escaped the scene with the Roundheads on his tail. He managed to reach Bishops Wood in Staffordshire, where he found an oak tree (now known as the Boscobel Oak near Boscobel House). He climbed the tree and hid in it for a day while his obviously short-sighted pursuers strolled around under the tree looking for him. The hunters gave up, Prince Charles came down and escaped to France (the Escape of Charles II). He became Charles II on the Restoration of the Monarchy. To celebrate this good fortune, 29 May (Charles' birthday) was declared Royal Oak Day and the pub name remembers this. The Royal Naval ship HMS Royal Oak gets its name from the same source. Early ships were built of the heartwood of oak. Bath, England Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem * Saracen's Head and Turk's Head: Saracens and Turks were among the enemies faced by Crusaders. This is also a reference to the Barbary pirates that raided the coasts from the Crusades until the early 19th century. * Trafalgar: commemorating the Battle of Trafalgar. There are many pubs called the Nelson, and an Emma Hamilton pub in Wimbledon Chase where Nelson lived with her. A famous pub is the Trafalgar Tavern, part of the Greenwich Maritime World Heritage site at Greenwich. * Olde Trip to Jerusalem, Nottingham, one of the claimants to the title of oldest pub in Britain, said to have been a stopping- off place for the Crusaders on the way to the Holy Land. \\"Trip\\" here has the old meaning of a stop, not the modern journey. The pub was once called the Pilgrim, which is probably the real story behind the name. The pub has the date 1189 painted on its masonry, which is the year King Richard I ascended to the throne. Like many elderly pubs, the Trip carries \\"Ye\\" before its name, with an E on the end of \\"old\\" another \\"olde worlde\\" affectation. ==Literature== The Moon Under Water, Watford, named after George Orwell's description ===Names from books=== * Cat and Custard Pot in Shipton Moyne is said to originate from the book Handley Cross or Mr Jorrocks's Hunt by R.

R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Here Gaffer Gamgee recounted to the other regulars his stories about Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, who were about to throw a magnificent joint birthday party.The Fellowship of the Ring, \\"A Long-expected Party\\". The most likely real-world source is an Edgbaston pub called the Ivy Bush, near where Tolkien lived when he was growing up in Birmingham.Blackham, Bob, 'Tolkien's Birmingham', in Mallorn, the journal of The Tolkien Society (U.K.) issue 45, Spring 2008, p.27 ==Myths and legends== Images from myths and legends are evocative and memorable. * Black Horse (Black Bess): usually named after the legendary overnight ride from London to York in 1737 by Dick Turpin. This fictional account was popularised in a novel, Rookwood (1834), resulting in a surge of Dick Turpin nostalgia and associated pub names. *The Bucket of Blood, is a public house in Phillack, Hayle, Cornwall, owned by St Austell Brewery. It is thought to be named after an incident where the landlord brought up a bucket of blood from the building's well, as a murdered smuggler had been dropped there. * Fiddler's Green, a legendary place in the afterlife where existence consists of all leisure and no work. * George and Dragon: St George is the patron saint of England and his conflict with a dragon is essential to his story. This sign is a symbol of English nationalism. * Green Man: a spirit of the wild woods. The original images are in churches as a face peering through or made of leaves and petals; this character is the Will of the Wisp, the Jack of the Green. Some pub signs will show the green man as he appears in English traditional sword dances (in green hats). The Green Man is not the same character as Robin Hood, although the two may be linked. Some pubs which were the Green Man have become the Robin Hood; there are no pubs in Robin's own county of Nottinghamshire named the Green Man but there are Robin Hoods. The 1973 film The Wicker Man features a Green Man pub. * Moonrakers: In the 17th century, some Wiltshire yokels hid their smuggled liquor in the Crammer (a pond in Devizes) and used rakes to recover their stash. They were caught in the act by customs officials and they claimed they were trying to rake in a cheese, which was in fact the reflection of the full moon. The customs officials left thinking that the locals were a bit simple, whilst the locals recovered the smuggled goods without any more interference. The name Moonrakers has been used as a nickname for Wiltshire folk ever since and is the name of pubs in Devizes and Swindon. * Robin Hood, sometimes partnered by his second in charge to form the name Robin Hood and Little John. Other Robin Hood names can be found throughout Arnold, Nottinghamshire. These were given to pubs built in the new estates of the 1960s by the Home Brewery of Daybrook, Nottinghamshire: Arrow, Friar Tuck, Longbow, Maid Marian and Major Oak. * Silent Woman, Quiet Lady or Headless Woman: The origin is uncertain, with various local stories, such as a landlady whose tongue was cut out by smugglers so she couldn't talk to the authorities, or a saint beheaded for her Christianity. The pub signs sometimes have an image of a decapitated woman or the couplet: \\"Here is a woman who has lost her head / She's quiet now—you see she's dead\\". * Captain's Wife, near the medieval trading port of Swanbridge on the south Wales coast near Penarth. The pub was converted during the 1970s from a row of fishermen's cottages. There is a local legend of a ghostly wife keeping endless vigil after her husband's boat was lost in a storm. ==Paired names== Common enough today, the pairing of words in the name of an inn or tavern was rare before the mid-17th century, but by 1708 had become frequent enough for a pamphlet to complain of 'the variety and contradictory language of the signs', citing absurdities such as 'Bull and Mouth', 'Whale and Cow', and 'Shovel and Boot'. Two years later an essay in the Spectator echoed this complaint, deriding among others such contemporary paired names as 'Bell and Neat's Tongue', though accepting 'Cat and Fiddle'. A possible explanation for doubling of names is the combining of businesses, for example when a landlord of one pub moved to another premises. Fashion, as in the rise of intentionally amusing paired names like 'Slug and Lettuce' and 'Frog and Firkin' (see Puns, Jokes and Corruptions below) in the late 20th century, is responsible for many more recent pub names. ==Personal names or titles== The Marquis of Granby, after whom a number of pubs are named. Some pubs are known by the names of former landlords and landladies, for instance Nellie's (originally the White Horse) in Beverley, and Ma Pardoe's (officially the Olde Swan) in Netherton, West Midlands. The Baron of Beef, Welwyn, Hertfordshire is named after a nineteenth-century landlord, George Baron, listed in Kelly's Directory for 1890 as \\"Butcher and Beer Retailer\\".

The Hero of Norfolk at Swaffham, Norfolk, portrays Nelson as did Norfolk Hero at Wisbech. * Guy Earl of Warwick, in Welling, Dartford, dates from at least 1896. and is thought to be the \\"Halfway House\\" which appears in Charles Dickens' 1861 Great Expectations. * Duke of Wellington * The Shakespeare, Redland, Shakespeare’s Tree, Bidford-on-Avon, Warwickshire: Used to celebrate the Bard's genius. ==Places== * Tavistock Inn, as for example at Poundsgate, Dartmoor. * The Bailey Head a new name for the former Castle Tavern or Eagles sited on the Bailey Head, the name of the market square in Oswestry * Beachy Head * Horse Shoe Hole Inn, Leverington was located near the River Nene horse shoe feature. * London Inn * Mutley Tavern in Mutley Plain, Plymouth * Plymouth Inn * Twelve Pins or Na Beanna Beola (Finsbury Park, London): the Twelve Pins mountain range in the west of Ireland.History of the Twelve Pins (brief).

The more usual derivation is for the Duke of Bedford whose seat is at the nearby Woburn Abbey. ==Plants and horticulture== Hoop and Grapes, Aldgate High Street, London The most common tree-based pub name is the Royal Oak, which refers to a Historical event. * Bush, Holly Bush, Mulberry Bush etc. refer to plants, but note that Bull and Bush refers to a battle (see Historical event above). * Chequers from the Wild Service Tree or \\"Chequer(s) Tree\\", the fruit of which was used to flavour beer before the introduction of hops. * Crabtree would refer to a crab apple tree growing nearby or in the grounds, as pubs are often free standing. * Flower Pot, Mirfield, Maidstone, Kent, Aston, Oxfordshire, Henley-on-Thames and Wisbech, Isle of Ely. Flowerpots, Cheriton, Hampshire. * Hand and Flower, Hammersmith, London, also Ham, Surrey. Hand and Flowers, Marlow. * Major Oak, Nottingham. Named after an ancient tree, and locally associated with Robin Hood * Pineapple, e.g. in The Pineapple, Kentish Town, also Berkshire and Oldham. * Pink Geranium, a pub in Pontardawe. * Rose Tavern, a pub in Wisbech, Isle of Ely. * Tulip, Chelmsford. * Vine or Grapes possibly harks back to the Roman custom of displaying a vine outside a tavern or wine-shop, as in The Hoop and Grapes in Aldgate High Street, London (reputed to be the city's oldest pub) and the Vine, Wisbech (now closed). * Wheatsheaf, a Wetherspoon pub in Wisbech. ==Politically incorrect== * All labour in vain or Labour in vain. At various locations. Probably of Biblical origins, in past times the name was often illustrated by a person trying to scrub the blackness off a black child. Such signs, now deemed offensive, have been mostly replaced with more innocuous depictions of wasted effort.\\"The present sign is the innocuous replacement for one that became the centre of a storm a dozen or so years ago. As readers may remember, the original illustration was of a white couple trying to scrub the blackness off a black child in a tub. It was deemed by many to be in poor taste and potentially offensive, but there was an outcry when it was removed following a protest by two schoolgirls.\\" * There are numerous old pubs and inns in England with the name of the Black Boy, many now claimed to refer either to child chimneysweeps or coal miners, or to a (genuine) historic description of King Charles II. The Black Boy Inn, Caernarfon, North Wales, has received at least a dozen complaints from visitors over the name, which dates back at least 250 years. However, the police say they have not received any formal complaints. * The Black Bitch, a pub in Linlithgow, West Lothian, is named after the local legend of a black greyhound who is said to have repeatedly swum to an island in the town's loch to bring food to its imprisoned master, only to suffer the same fate when its efforts were discovered. The pub's name has caused more than a few surprised tourists to question the name or decry it as racist. ==The pub itself (including nicknames)== ===The pub building=== The Crooked House, Himley, known for its extreme lean, caused by mining subsidence * Candlestick, West End, Essendon, Hertfordshire: Once the Chequers, lit by a single candle and plunged into darkness when the landlord took the candle to the cellar to fetch beer. * Crooked Chimney, Lemsford, Hertfordshire: The pub's chimney is distinctively crooked. * Crooked House, nickname of the Glynne Arms, Himley, Staffordshire. Because of mining subsidence, one side of the pub has a pronounced list. * Cupola House, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, has a cupola on its roof. * Hippodrome : a former cinema. This March, Isle of Ely premises was once a cinema. * Hole in the Wall. The official name or nickname of a number of very small pubs. One such at Waterloo, London, is spacious but built into a railway viaduct. The Hole in the Wall, Gibraltar was an iconic bar well frequented by the navy workers. * Jackson Stops, Stretton, Rutland: The pub was once closed for a period when the only sign on the outside was that of London estate agent Jackson Stops. The name stuck. * Kilt and Clover, Port Dalhousie, Ontario, named after the owners. The husband is of Scottish descent, and the wife is of Irish heritage. The split theme runs throughout the pub. * New Inn. Pubs can bear this name for centuries. * Nutshell, Bury St Edmunds: one of the foremost claimants to be the smallest pub in the UK and maybe the world. * Push Inn, Beverley: At one time the pub had no external sign except for that on the entrance door which read, simply, PUSH. * Red House, Newport Pagnell, and on the old A43 between Northampton and Kettering: red or reddish painted buildings. * Swiss Cottage was built in Swiss chalet style. It gave its name to an underground station and an area of London. * Swiss Gardens, Shoreham-by-Sea, originally the pub of a Swiss-themed Victorian picnic garden and amusement park. * Vaults, a number of pubs, not all having vaults as an architectural feature; the word also had the general meaning of 'storeroom'.'A place of this kind used as a cellar or storeroom for provisions or liquors.' Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition, 1989; online version June 2011. ; accessed 1 September 2011. By extension 'the vaults' was formerly used to designate a particular type of bar. At a time (mid 19th-mid 20th century) when the several areas in a pub served different clientele, 'the vaults' would cater largely for working-class drinkers and would most usually be men-only. * White Elephant, Northampton, Northamptonshire. Originally built as a hotel to accommodate visitors to the adjacent Northampton Racecourse, the building became a \\"white elephant\\" (useless object) when horse racing was stopped at Northampton Racecourse in 1904. ===Services provided by the pub=== The Farriers Arms, Shilbottle * Coach & Horses, for a coaching inn * Farriers Arms, for a pub with a farrier who could re-shoe the traveller's horses * Free Press, named for when part of the building in Cambridge was used to print a newspaper. * Horse & Groom, where the traveller's horse would be cared for while the traveller drank * Wheelwrights, for a pub where a coach's wheels could be repaired or replaced ===Beer and wine=== The Barley Mow, Clifton Hampden Many traditional pub names refer to the drinks available inside, most often beer. * Barley Mow: a stack (or sheaf) of barley, the principal grain from which beer is made. * Barrels: A cask or keg containing 36 Imperial gallons of liquid, especially beer. Other sizes include: pin, 36 pints; firkin, 9 gallons; kilderkin, 18 gallons; half-hogshead, 27 gallons; hogshead, 54 gallons; butt, probably 104 gallons. * Brewery Tap: A pub originally found on site or adjacent to a brewery and often showcasing its products to visitors; although, now that so many breweries have closed, the house may be nowhere near an open brewery. * Burton Stingo, Wisbech thought to be named after the Burton ales and Stingo on sale within. * Bushel (and New Bushel), Wisbech, Isle of Ely: named after a unit of volume used in a corn exchange to trade including barley used in brewing. * Cock and Bottle, or simply Cock: The stopcock used to serve beer from a barrel, and a beer bottle. * Hop Inn: Hop flowers are the ingredient in beer which gives it its bitter taste, though this name is often intended as a pun. * Hop Pole: The poles which support wires or ropes up which hops grow in the field. * (Sir) John Barleycorn: A character of English traditional folk music and folklore, similar to a Green Man. He is annually cut down at the ankles, thrashed, but always reappears—an allegory of growth and harvest based on barley. * Leather(n) Bottle: A container in which a small amount of beer or wine was transported, now replaced by a glass bottle or can. * Malt Shovel: A shovel used in a malting to turn over the barley grain. * Mash Tun: a brewery vessel used to mix grains with water. * Pint Shop : unit of volume. * Three Tuns: Based on the arms of two City of London guilds, the Worshipful Company of Vintners and the Worshipful Company of Brewers. ===Food=== Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, Fleet Street, London Other pub names refer to items of food to tempt the hungry traveller. For example, The Baron of Beef in Cambridge refers to a double sirloin joined at the backbone. * Shoulder of Mutton, Wisbech is another pub named for a joint of meat. ==Puns, jokes and corruptions== Pub heritage: Nowhere Inn Particular, now closed Although puns became increasingly popular through the twentieth century, they should be considered with care. Supposed corruptions of foreign phrases usually have much simpler explanations. Many old names for pubs that appear nonsensical are often alleged to have come from corruptions of slogans or phrases, such as \\"The Bag o'Nails\\" (Bacchanals), \\"The Cat and the Fiddle\\" (Caton Fidele) and \\"The Bull and Bush\\", which purportedly celebrates the victory of Henry VIII at \\"Boulogne Bouche\\" or Boulogne-sur-Mer Harbour. Often, these corruptions evoke a visual image which comes to signify the pub; these images had particular importance for identifying a pub on signs and other media before literacy became widespread. Sometimes the basis of a nickname is not the name, but its pictorial representation on the sign that becomes corrupt, through weathering, or unskillful paintwork by an amateur artist. Apparently, many pubs called the Cat or Cat and Custard Pot were originally Tigers or Red Lions with signs that \\"looked more like a cat\\" in the opinion of locals. * Axe and Gate: Possibly from \\"ax (or ask) and get\\". * Bag o'Nails: Thought by the romantic to be a corrupted version of \\"Bacchanals\\" but really is just a sign once used by ironmongers. The pub of this name in Bristol, England was named in the 1990s for the former reason, though the latter is more prevalent. * Barge Inn. A play on words 'barge in'. The Barge Inn in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire is however actually on a canal, where barges tie up. * Beartown Tap, Congleton, Cheshire. 'Beartown' is the nickname for Congleton, as local legend claims its townsfolk once 'sold the bible to buy the bear', that is, spent money set aside to buy a parish Bible on providing bear-baiting at their fair. Congleton history website * Bent Brief, once close to the Honest Lawyer on Lodge Road, Southampton. * Bird and Baby, the familiar name used by the Inklings for the Eagle and Child pub in Oxford (see above under Heraldry). * Buck and Ear in the Steveston area of Richmond, British Columbia. The name alludes not only to the maritime heritage of the area but also to a previous establishment at the same location that was called \\"The Buccaneer\\". * Bull and Mouth: Believed to celebrate the victory of Henry VIII at \\"Boulogne Mouth\\" or Harbour. Also applies to Bull and Bush (Boulogne Bouche). * Case is Altered: The title of an early comedy by Ben Jonson, first published in 1609, based on a remark by lawyer Edmund Plowden which entered into common currency. Also said to be a corruption of the Latin phrase Casa Alta ('high house') or Casa Altera ('second house'). There are several examples in England, such as at Hatton, Warwickshire The Case is Altered (now closed) and a later new build pub 'The Case' also now closed both in Wisbech, Isle of Ely. * Cat and Fiddle: a corruption of Caton le Fidèle (a governor of Calais loyal to King Edward III). Alternatively from Katherine la Fidèle, Henry VIII's first wife. * Cock and Bull: a play on \\"cock and bull story\\". This term is said to derive from the Cock and the Bull, two pubs in Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire, which are close neighbours and rival coaching inns. * Dew Drop Inn: A pun on \\"do drop in\\". * Dirty Duck: The Black Swan, as in Stratford-on-Avon; also The Mucky Duck in Portsmouth and the Students Union pub at the University of Warwick * Dirty Habit: Sited on the route of the Pilgrims' Way, the name is a play on the contemptuous phrase and a reference to the clothing of monks who passed by on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Elephant and Castle pub sign near Bury St Edmunds, interpreting the name as a howdah * Elephant and Castle: By folk etymology, a corruption of \\"la Infanta de Castile\\". It is popularly believed amongst residents of Elephant and Castle that a 17th-century publican near Newington named his tavern after the Spanish princess who was affianced to King Charles I of England. The prohibition of this marriage by Church authorities in 1623 was a cause of war with Spain so it seems unlikely to have been a popular name. A more probable and prosaic explanation is that the name derives from the arms of the Worshipful Company of Cutlers, a London trade guild; an elephant carrying a castle-shaped howdah can also be seen on the arms of the City of Coventry. * Fawcett Inn (\\"force it in\\"), Portsmouth. * Gate Hangs Well, common in the Midlands: \\"This Gate Hangs Well, and hinders none. Refresh and pay and travel on.\\" Also frequently found as 'Hanging Gate'. * Goat and Compass[es]: Possibly based on the arms of the Worshipful Company of Cordwainers, whose coat of arms contains three goats, together with the Worshipful Company of Carpenters, whose coat of arms contains three compasses. (either that, or from \\"God encompass us\\") * Honest Lawyer Folkestone, The Honest Politician, Portsmouth. * Hop Inn: similar to the Dew Drop Inn. A double pun in that hops are a major ingredient in beer making. * Jolly Taxpayer in Portsmouth. * Letters Inn (\\"let us in\\") * Library: So students and others can say they're in 'the library', * Nag's Head. Pub signs can play on the double meaning of Nag – a horse or a scolding woman. * Nowhere, Plymouth; Nowhere Inn Particular, Croydon: Wife calls husband on his mobile and asks where he is. He answers truthfully \\"Nowhere\\". * Office: as above. * Ostrich, Ipswich: originally Oyster Reach (the old name has since been restored on the advice of historians). * Paraffin Oil Shop (now closed, at the crossing of A5080 and B5179 in eastern Liverpool, Google Earth view here: So people could say that they are going to buy paraffin. * Pig and Whistle: a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon saying piggin wassail meaning \\"good health\\". * Swan With Two Necks: In England and Wales, wild mute swans swimming in open water have traditionally been the property of the reigning monarch, who had the right to grant swan marks. In the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I granted the right to ownership of some swans to the Worshipful Company of Vintners. To tell which swan belonged to whom, the Vintners' swans' beaks would be marked with two notches, or nicks. The word 'nick' was mistaken for 'neck', and so the Vintners spotted that a Swan With Two Necks could afford them a rather clever pun, and a striking pub sign. When Swan Upping is carried out nowadays rings are used in lieu of nicking beaks. * Three Chimneys, Biddenden: During the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) it is said that up to 3,000 French prisoners were kept at nearby Sissinghurst Castle. The French seamen were placed on parole in the surrounding area and were allowed out as far as the pub building. At the time locals referred to this as the 'Three Wents' (or three ways) but the prisoners called it Les Trois Chemins. The unique name of the Three Chimneys therefore derives from the French term for the junction of three roads. ==Religious== Lion and Lamb, Farnham The amount of religious symbolism in pub names decreased after Henry VIII's break from the church of Rome. For instance, many pubs now called the King's Head were originally called the Pope's Head. * Anchor, Hope & Anchor, Anchor & Hope: From the Letter to the Hebrews (6:19): \\"We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope.\\" * Cross Keys: The sign of St Peter, the gatekeeper of Heaven. Often found near a church dedicated to St Peter. When people walked to the Sunday service they often stayed afterwards, at a house near the church, to drink beer and to watch or participate in sporting events. These venues became known as pubs and would use the sign of the saint to which the church was dedicated - the Cross Keys for St Peter, an Eagle for St John, a Lion for St Mark. The sporting events might include the racing or fighting of dogs, bulls, cocks or pheasants, or the hunting of foxes, with or without hounds - thus giving rise to further pub signs. * Lamb & Flag: From the Gospel of John (1:29): \\"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.\\" The Lamb is seen carrying a flag (usually of St. George) and is the symbol of the Knights Templar, the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors, and St John's College, Oxford.

The two surveys most often cited, both taken in 2007, are by the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) and CAMRA. According to BBPA, the most common names are: #Red Lion (759) #Royal Oak (626) #White Hart (427) #Rose and Crown (326) #King's Head (310) #King's Arms (284) #Queen's Head (278) #The Crown (261) and according to CAMRA they are: #Crown (704) #Red Lion (668) #Royal Oak (541) #Swan (451) #White Hart (431) #Railway (420) #Plough (413) #White Horse (379) #Bell (378)In 2008 it was claimed that the total number of names incorporating the word 'Bell' totalled 412. #New Inn (372) A more current listing can be found on the Pubs Galore site, updated daily as pubs open/close and change names. As of 18 December 2019, the top 10 were: #Red Lion (558) #Crown (509) #Royal Oak (432) #White Hart (317) #Swan (296) #Plough (294) #Railway (294) #White Horse (286) #Kings Arms (245) #Ship (244) The number of each is given in brackets. ==Curiosities== The pubs with the shortest and longest names in Britain are both in Stalybridge: Q and The Old Thirteenth Cheshire Astley Volunteer Rifleman Corps Inn. The longest name of a London pub, I am the Only Running Footman, was used as the title of a mystery novel by Martha Grimes. There is a \\"pub with no name\\" in Southover Street, Brighton, and another near to Petersfield, Hampshire, so known (despite having an actual name), because its sign on the nearest main road has been missing for many years.https://www.whitehorsepetersfield.co.uk/ The Salley Pussey's Inn at Royal Wootton Bassett is said to have been named after Sarah Purse, whose family owned The Wheatsheaf pub in the 19th century.

In pre-World War II Germany, two high school students, Peter Müller and Thomas Berger, attempt to be swing kids by night and Hitler Youth by day, a decision that acutely impacts their friends and families. ==Historical background== In the 1930s, some young German teens favored American and British pop culture; they hung out in secret underground clubs where bands played swing music and listened to contemporary music by acts like Benny Goodman and Duke Ellington. The film's screenwriter, Jonathan Marc Feldman, based the film on this eponymous Swing Kids movement. ==Plot== In Hamburg in 1939, Peter Müller and Thomas Berger join their friends Arvid and Otto at a swing club called the Bismarck. They have a good time, dancing and enjoying the music. Peter goes home to find his mother in an argument with the Nazi Blockleiter (block leader). Herr Knopp, head of the local Gestapo, arrives and curtly dismisses the Blockleiter. Herr Knopp begins asking Frau Müller questions about some of her late husband's friends. Herr Müller had been accused of being a communist, and was irreparably damaged by an interrogation at the hands of Nazi agents. At Arvid's house, Thomas accidentally ruins one of Arvid's prized records. Upset, Arvid kicks Thomas, Peter and Otto out. To apologize to Arvid, Peter and Thomas steal a radio (which Peter knows was stolen from a ransacked Jewish home) from a bakery. Thomas escapes, but Peter is caught. Herr Knopp, who is attracted to Peter's mother, intercedes for him; in return, Peter must enroll in the Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth). Peter, who has a job delivering books, is asked to spy on his boss, whom the Nazis suspect is working against the Reich. In HJ school, the boys are encouraged to spy on their friends and families. Thomas accuses his father of insulting Hitler, hoping to cause trouble for him, but is unnerved when the Nazis come to his home and take his father away. His subsequent attempts to resume his friendship with Peter and persuade him to collaborate with the Nazis are tinged with fear. Arvid, who is working at a jazz club, refuses to play a German song, lashing out at the club's patrons for being blind to the Nazi agenda. Peter is sympathetic but Thomas loudly argues the Nazi side. Peter angrily proclaims Thomas to be a \\"fucking Nazi\\" and storms off. After he is badly beaten by Nazis, leaving him struggling to play the guitar, Arvid realizes there is nothing for him in Germany and dies by suicide. As Thomas begins to believe fully in Nazi ideology, Peter feels as though there is no hope for him. Peter, disenchanted with how his life is coming apart, dresses up and goes to a swing club which is scheduled to be raided by members of the Hitlerjugend. As Thomas begins assaulting the club's patrons he attacks Peter; however, during the fight Peter is able to reach Thomas. Thomas begs Peter to run away but Peter won't. Willie Müller is there and as Peter is driven away by the police, he loudly screams \\"Swing Heil!\\" over and over again, proud that his brother stood up for being a swing kid. ==Cast== * Robert Sean Leonard as Peter Müller * Christian Bale as Thomas Berger * Frank Whaley as Arvid * Barbara Hershey as Frau Müller * Tushka Bergen as Evey * David Tom as Willi Müller * Julia Stemberger as Frau Linge * Kenneth Branagh as SS-Sturmbannführer Knopp * Noah Wyle as Emil Lutz * Jessica Hynes as Helga * Martin Clunes as Bannführer * Jayce Bartok as Otto ==Reception== Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives it a score of 56% (based on 18 reviews) and an average score of 4.93/10.

On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 39 (based on 20 reviews). The Tech called it \\"amazing\\" saying the \\"well-researched film is wonderfully acted\\".Strong acting allows Swing Kids to overcome slow plot A contemporary film reviewer wrote: > In the eyes of today's teenagers, Nazis are simplistic villains who get > outsmarted, out-gunned and outmaneuvered by Indiana Jones in 'Raiders of the > Lost Ark' and other simplistic action-adventure tales.

Nevertheless, they were still referred to as \\"dependencies of Norway\\" in later official documents. Also the Treaty of Kiel states: \\"...and provinces, constituting the kingdom of Norway, [..], together with their dependencies (Greenland, the Faroe Isles, and Iceland, excepted); [...] shall belong in full and sovereign property to the King of Sweden,...\\", clearly indicating that they were until 1814 regarded as a part of Norway.

Norway claimed Bouvet Island and looked further south, formally inquiring with Foreign Office about the international status of the area between 45° and 65° south latitude and 35° and 80° west longitude. Following a second such diplomatic démarche by the Norwegian Government dated 4 March 1907, Britain replied that the areas were British based on discoveries made in the first half of the 19th century, and issued the 1908 Letters Patent incorporating the British Falkland Islands Dependencies with a permanent local administration in Grytviken established in 1909.Odd Gunnar Skagestad.

These were adopted by the Church Fathers as the seven virtues. ==Cardinal virtues== The Greek philosophers Aristotle and Plato, regarded Temperance, wisdom, justice, and courage as the four most desirable character traits. The Book of Wisdom is one of the seven Sapiential Books included in the Septuagint. Wisdom 8:7 states that the fruits of Wisdom \\"...are virtues; For she teaches moderation and prudence, justice and fortitude, and nothing in life is more useful for men than these.\\" The moral virtues are attitudes, and good habits that govern one's actions, passions, and conduct according to reason; and are acquired by human effort.CCC §1804 Immanuel Kant said, \\"Virtue is the moral strength of the will in obeying the dictates of duty\\".Rickaby, John. \\"Fortitude.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 6 April 2017 The cardinal virtues are prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance. * Prudence from (meaning \\"seeing ahead, sagacity\\") is the ability to govern and discipline oneself by the use of reason.Prudence—Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Merriam-webster.com (2012-08-31). It is called the Auriga virtutum (the charioteer of the virtues) as it guides the other virtues.CCC §1806 * Justice is the virtue which regulates man in his dealings with others. Connected to justice are the virtues of religion, piety, and gratitude. * Fortitude which Thomas Aquinas ranks third after prudence and justice and equates with brave endurance. Patience and perseverance are virtues related to fortitude. * Temperance is the virtue which moderates in accordance with reason the desires and pleasures of the sensuous appetite. Related to temperance are the virtues of conscience, humility, and meekness. Philosophers recognized the interrelatedness of the virtues such that courage without prudence risks becoming mere foolhardiness. Aquinas found an interconnection of practical wisdom (prudentia) and moral virtue. This is frequently termed \\"the Unity of the Virtues.\\"Annas, Julia. The Morality of Happiness (Oxford; Oxford University Press, 1993), pp. 73–84 Aquinas also argued that it not only matters what a person does but how the person does it. The person must aim at a good end and also make a right choice about the means to that end. The moral virtues direct the person to aim at a good end, but to ensure that the person make the right choices about the means to a good end, one needs practical wisdom.Aquinas. Commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics, Book VI, Lecture XI, ##1279–1280 ==Theological virtues== The traditional understanding of the differences in the natures of Cardinal and Theological virtues, is that the latter are not fully accessible to humans in their natural state without assistance from God. \\"All virtues have as their final scope to dispose man to acts conducive to his true happiness. The happiness, however, of which man is capable is twofold, namely, natural, which is attainable by man's natural powers, and supernatural, which exceeds the capacity of unaided human nature. Since, therefore, merely natural principles of human action are inadequate to a supernatural end, it is necessary that man be endowed with supernatural powers to enable him to attain his final destiny. Now these supernatural principles are nothing else than the theological virtues.\\" ==Seven virtues and the seven capital sins== A list of seven virtues that oppose the seven deadly sins appeared later in an epic poem titled Psychomachia, or Battle/Contest of the Soul. Written by Aurelius Clemens Prudentius, a Christian governor who died around AD 410, it entails the battle between good virtues and evil vices. The enormous popularity of this work in the Middle Ages helped to spread the concept of holy virtue throughout Europe. After Pope Gregory released his list of seven deadly sins in AD 590, the seven virtues became identified as chastity, temperance, charity, diligence, patience, kindness, and humility. Practicing them is said to protect one against temptation from the seven deadly sins. { class=\\"sortable \\" !Virtue !Latin !Gloss !Sin !Latin - Chastity Castitas Purity, abstinence Lust Luxuria - Temperance Temperantia Humanity, equanimity Gluttony Gula - Charity Caritas Will, benevolence, generosity, sacrifice Greed Avaritia - Diligence Industria Persistence, effortfulness, ethics Sloth Acedia - Patience Patientia Forgiveness, mercy Wrath Ira - Kindness Humanitas Satisfaction, compassion Envy Invidia - Humility Humilitas Bravery, modesty, reverence Pride Superbia } These seven virtues do not correspond to the seven heavenly virtues arrived at by combining the cardinal and theological virtues. Furthermore, efforts in the Middle Ages to set the seven heavenly virtues in direct opposition to the seven capital sins are both uncommon and beset with difficulties. \\"[T]reatises exclusively concentrating on both septenaries are actually quite rare.\\" and \\"examples of late medieval catalogues of virtues and vices which extend or upset the double heptad can be easily multiplied.\\" And there are problems with this parallelism. ==See also== * Holy obedience * Aristotles' List of Virtues ==References== ==External links== * Hoopes, Tom. \\"Seven Passion Sins and Virtues\\", National Catholic Register Category:Asceticism Category:Catholic doctrines Category:Christian ethics 7 Seven virtues Category:Spirituality Category:Virtue Category:Christian terminology ","title":"Seven virtues"},{"id":"1439960","text":"Bor () is a town in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Russia, located on the left (northern) bank of the Volga River, across from Nizhny Novgorod.

The Parys Affair ==Career== Rakowski was born in a peasant family, operated a lathe as a teenager. He served as an officer in the Polish People's Army from 1945 to 1949. He began his political career in 1946 as a member of the Polish Workers' Party, and from 1948 to 1990 he was a member of the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR), serving on its Central Committee from 1975 to 1990. He received a doctorate in history from Warsaw's Institute for Social Sciences in 1956. Rakowski served as the second-to-last communist Prime Minister of Poland from September 1988 to August 1989 (Czesław Kiszczak then served less than a month as the last Communist to hold the post, before the accession of Tadeusz Mazowiecki). He was the last First Secretary of the PZPR from July 1989 to January 1990. However, he was not, unlike his predecessors, the de facto leader of the country; the PZPR had given up its monopoly on power in early 1989. Rakowski was also known as one of the founders and, from 1958 to 1982, first deputy and then chief editor of the weekly newspaper Polityka, one of the most influential publications at the time (Polityka continues to exist and is regarded by many as the most prestigious weekly in Poland). Today some people still remember him as a journalist and editor rather than a politician. Rakowski was involved in the Communist government during suppression of the Solidarity movement.

A prominent member of Conservative Party of Canada from 2004 till his death, he became an influential strongman in the Party's parliamentary caucus. Appointed to the Canadian senate on recommendation of Brian Mulroney on 1993, he was designated as speaker pro tempore in 2013 before being promoted to the office of Speaker of the Senate in November 2014. He held the office till his death on April 23, 2015. == Life before politics == Nolin was born in Montreal, Quebec, and attended the University of Ottawa. He received a Degree in Law in 1975. In 1976, Nolin married Camille Desjardins, with whom he had three children, Simon, Louis and Virginie. == Quebec senator == Nolin was appointed to the Senate of Canada on the recommendation of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney on June 18, 1993. He had been an influential supporter of Mulroney in Quebec politics since 1976, when Mulroney made his first attempt at becoming the Progressive Conservative Party's leader. For ten years, Nolin worked actively as a high-profile member of the PC Party Senate Caucus. In 2002, Nolin raised eyebrows by chairing the Canadian Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs and supporting its recommendations to legalize but not decriminalize the use of marijuana in Canada. Nolin supported the merger of the PC Party and the Canadian Alliance in 2003 that created the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC). Nolin supported auto-parts magnate Belinda Stronach during the 2004 CPC leadership election. Between former Tory MP André Bachand's departure from politics in June 2004 and January 2006, Nolin surreptitiously became the \\"Quebec strongman\\" in the new Conservative Party's parliamentary caucus. Nolin is largely seen as an influential Red Tory, which is in line with most of the Conservatives who have come from Quebec in recent decades. In January 2005, Nolin announced that the Quebec wing of the CPC would be introducing several \\"moderate\\" principles to the March 2005 CPC Policy Convention in Montreal, including a motion to support the rights of married same-sex couples to equal status in the courts of law. Many of the new Tory party's Quebec-wing motions passed, but with amendments. In the 2006 Canadian federal election, the new Tories managed to elect 10 MPs from Quebec, that party's best showing since 1988. Nolin was elected Speaker pro tempore of the Canadian Senate on November 20, 2013 and, a year later, was appointed Speaker of the Senate by Prime Minister Stephen Harper effective November 27, 2014, as a result of the retirement of his predecessor, Noël Kinsella. == Illness and death == Nolin was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in 2010. He died on April 23, 2015 at the age of 64, leaving the Canadian Senate in midst of crisis. Nolin's funeral was held in Montreal's Notre-Dame Basilica. Senator Leo Housakos would continue in the role as acting Speaker of the Senate until a new person is appointed.

Sejanus His Fall was performed at court in 1603, and at the Globe Theatre in 1604. The latter performance was a failure. According to Jonson, an unnamed co-author \\"had good share\\" in the version of the play as it was \\"acted on the public stage\\". For reasons unknown the play was accused of promoting \\"popery and treason\\". Jonson was questioned, but no action was taken. Jonson published the play in a revised version, replacing the contributions of his co-author with his own words. The published version was accompanied by copious marginal notes citing its historical sources, in quarto in 1605 and in folio in 1616. ==Stage history== Sejanus His Fall was first performed by the King's Men in 1603, probably at court in the winter of that year.. In 1604 it was produced at the Globe Theatre. The play's reception in 1603 is unrecorded, but the 1604 performance at the Globe was \\"hissed off the stage\\".. According to Park Honan, Shakespeare's own later Roman works carefully avoided \\"Sejanus's clotted style, lack of irony, and grinding moral emphasis.\\"Park Honan, Shakespeare: A Life, Oxford University Press, New York, 1999, p. 342. The published cast list in Jonson's 1616 folio identifies the principal actors as Richard Burbage, Augustine Phillips, William Sly, John Lowin, William Shakespeare, John Heminges, Henry Condell, and Alexander Cooke (listed in that order). It is not known which parts were played by which actors. David Grote argues that the published list probably mixes two separate productions, as Lowin did not join the King's Men until after the first production. However Grote suggests that the most likely roles for these performers can be identified: > Sejanus, the largest role and a classic over-reacher in the Richard III > manner, was obviously played by Burbage. The proud Silius, whose > confrontation with Tiberius occupies the core of the first three acts and > whose suicide is a traditionally noble Roman death, most likely would have > gone to Heminges, with the more military Condell as the Guards Captain > Macro. Phillips, who had been playing dissolute men for some time, would > seem very likely for Tiberius if not for Jonson's hint that it was actually > Shakespeare. Still, with Shakespeare as Tiberius, there is a very large role > for an indignant speechmaker, Arruntius, that would have taken advantage of > Phillips's rhetorical skills.David Grote, The Best Actors in the World: > Shakespeare and His Acting Company, Greenwood Press, Westport, 2002, p. 121. Grote further suggests that the unnamed other members of the company, Samuel Crosse, William Sly, and Robert Armin, played the roles of Lepidus, Terentius, and Sabinius. From 1604 on, there is no record of a performance of Sejanus His Fall until 1928, when it was put on by William Poel.. According to the play's modern editor Philip Ayres, Poel \\"cut the play by roughly a quarter\\" to \\"get away from the 'literary' 1605 published version to the 'hidden' stage play\\".. ==Printing history== The play was entered in the Stationers' Register by Edward Blount on 2 November 1604.. On 6 August 1605 Blount transferred his copyright to Thomas Thorpe, who published it in quarto that year (STC 14782), printed by George Eld.. The printed text is accompanied by \\"copious marginal notes\\" citing the play's historical sources, which Jonson informs his readers were \\"all in the learned tongues, save one, with whose English side I have little to do\\".. The play is prefaced by an epistle \\"To the Readers\\" by Jonson, and commendatory verses by George Chapman, Hugh Holland, 'Th. R.', generally assumed to be Sir Thomas Roe, John Marston, William Strachey, one 'Everard B.',Ayres states that this was not, as earlier assumed, Edmund Bolton; . and two poets who signed their verses as 'Cygnus' and 'Philos'. A 1616 edition in folio features Jonson's Epistle to Lord Aubigny, in which the dramatist again indicates that Sejanus was a flop when staged at the Globe Theatre. ==Allegations of treason== In the winter of 1618–19 Jonson told his friend William Drummond that the Earl of Northampton was his \\"mortal enemy\\" because Jonson had beaten one of the Earl's servants, and that Northampton had had Jonson called before the Privy Council on an accusation of \\"Popery and treason\\", based on Sejanus.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 367. What led to these accusations is unknown. It might have been something in the text or the performance of the play. Nor is it known exactly when this accusation was made, though it is likely to have been in the early period of James I's reign. However, according to Jonson expert James Loxley, \\"no action was taken, as far as we know\\".James Loxley, Complete Critical Guide to Ben Jonson, Routledge, New York, 2001, p. 25. There have been several theories about what may have led to the accusation. One theory is that the fall of Sejanus was thought to mirror that of the Earl of Essex, who had been executed in 1601. Another writer, Samuel Daniel was brought before the Privy Council in 1604 because his play Philotas was thought \\"to be a reflection of the dangerous matter of the dead Earl of Essex\\".Ian Grant Donaldson, Jonson's Magic Houses:Essays in Interpretation, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1997, p. 37. However Philip Ayres has argued that Sejanus was thought to parallel the 1603 trial of Walter Raleigh, who had been found guilty of conspiring with Spanish Catholics to murder James I in the Main Plot. This might explain how a play set in ancient Rome was suspected of promoting \\"Popery\\".Philip Ayres, \\"Jonson, Northampton, and the Treason in Sejanus\\", Modern Philology, 80 (1983), 356–63 It has also been suggested that the central theme of the play, the dangers of rule by royal favourites, was the problem. In the early years of his reign, 1603–05, James was especially sensitive to criticism of his supporters, given the several conspiracies against him, culminating in the 1605 Gunpowder plot.Evelyn May Albright, Dramatic Publication in England, 1580–1640: A Study of Conditions Affecting Content and Form of Drama, Modern Language Association of America: New York, 1927, p. 146. ==Co-author== Jonson's epistle \\"To the Readers\\" in the 1605 quarto states that an unnamed author had \\"good share\\" in the version of the play which was performed on the public stage: > Lastly I would inform you that this book, in all numbers, is not the same > with that which was acted on the public stage, wherein a second pen had good > share; in place of which, I have rather chosen to put weaker (and no doubt > less pleasing) of mine own, than to defraud so happy a genius of his right > by my loathed usurpation.. Jonson's reference to \\"happy genius\\" have led some to speculate that William Shakespeare was Jonson's co-author on the original version of Sejanus, which has not survived.Andew Gurr, The Shakespeare Company, 1594–1642, Cambridge University Press, 15 Apr. 2004, p. 144. Shakespeare is known to have been connected with the play as an actor. Another candidate for co-authorship is George Chapman, who later wrote a poem praising the play.Anne Barton, Ben Jonson, Dramatist, Cambridge University Press, 1984, p. 91. Jonson was certainly collaborating with Chapman in this period, as his next play, Eastward Ho, was co-written with Chapman and John Marston. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * Chambers, E.

The English translation by Alfred Birnbaum was released in 1991. A strange and dreamlike novel, its chapters alternate between two bizarre narratives—\\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland\\" (a cyberpunk-like, science fiction part) and \\"The End of the World\\" (a virtual fantasy-like, surreal part). ==Plot summary== The story is split between parallel narratives. The odd-numbered chapters take place in the 'Hard-Boiled Wonderland', although the phrase is not used anywhere in the text, only in page headers. The narrator is a , a human data processor/encryption system who has been trained to use his subconscious as an encryption key. The Calcutecs work for the quasi-governmental System, as opposed to the criminal who work for the Factory and who are generally fallen Calcutecs. The relationship between the two groups is simple: the System protects data while the Semiotecs steal it, although it is suggested that one man might be behind both. The narrator completes an assignment for a mysterious scientist, who is exploring \\"sound removal\\". He works in a laboratory hidden within an anachronistic version of Tokyo's sewer system. The narrator eventually learns that he only has a day and a half before his consciousness leaves the world he knows and delves forever into the world that has been created in his subconscious mind. According to the scientist, to the outside world this change will seem instantaneous, but in the Calcutec's mind, his time within this world will seem almost infinite. The even-numbered chapters deal with a newcomer to \\"The End of the World\\", a strange, isolated Town, depicted in the frontispiece map as being surrounded by a perfect and impenetrable wall. The narrator is in the process of being accepted into the Town. His Shadow has been \\"cut off\\" and this Shadow lives in the \\"Shadow Grounds\\" where he is not expected to survive the winter. Residents of the Town are not allowed to have a shadow, and, it transpires, do not have a mind. The narrator is assigned quarters and a job as the current \\"Dreamreader\\": a process intended to remove the traces of mind from the Town. He goes to the Library every evening where, assisted by the Librarian, he learns to read dreams from the skulls of unicorns. These \\"beasts\\" passively accept their role, sent out of the Town at night to their enclosure, where many die of cold during the winter. It gradually becomes evident that this Town is the world inside of the narrator from the Hard- Boiled Wonderland's subconscious (the password he uses to control different aspects of his mind is even 'end of the world'). The narrator grows to love the Librarian while he discovers the secrets of the Town, and although he plans to escape the Town with his Shadow, he later goes back on his word and allows his Shadow to escape the Town alone. The two storylines converge, exploring concepts of consciousness, the subconscious or unconscious mind, and identity. In the original Japanese, the narrator uses the more formal first- person pronoun watashi to refer to himself in the \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland\\" narrative and the more intimate boku in the \\"End of the World\\". Translator Alfred Birnbaum achieved a similar effect in English by putting the 'End of the World' sections in the present tense.Rubin, Jay. Haruki Murakami and the Music of Words. ==Characters== In both narratives, none of the characters are named. Each is instead referred to by occupation or a general description, such as \\"the Librarian\\" or \\"the Big Guy.\\" ===Hard-boiled Wonderland=== ;The Narrator: A Calcutec in his mid-thirties (35) who, aside from his unusual profession, lives the life of a typical Tokyo yuppie. Although very observant, he gives little thought to the strangeness of the world around him. ;The Old Man/the scientist: A great, yet absent-minded, scientist who hires the narrator to process information. He is researching \\"sound removal\\". He has developed a way of reading the subconscious and actually recording it as comprehensible, if unrelated images. He had the inspiration of then editing these images to embed a fictional story into the subconscious of his subjects, one of whom is of course the narrator. He did this by working with the System due to the attractiveness of its facilities, though he disliked working for anyone. He later goes to Finland, as said by his granddaughter, to escape. ;The Chubby Girl: The 17-year-old granddaughter of the Old Man, who looks as though she was in her 30s. She is described as morbidly overweight, yet attractive. She helps the Narrator in his journey through the sewers and decides to move in his apartment after the 2 worlds of his will converge. ;The Librarian: The always-hungry girl who helps the narrator research unicorns and becomes his 48-hour girlfriend. ;Junior and Big Boy: Two thugs who, on unknown orders, confront the narrator, leaving his apartment destroyed and inflicting a deliberately non-lethal but serious slash across his lower abdomen. ;INKlings: Short for Infra-Nocturnal Kappa. Sewer-dwelling people described as \\"Kappa\\" who have developed their own culture. They are so dangerous that the scientist lives in their realm, protected by a repelling device, to keep away from those who want to steal his data. It is said that they worship a Tilapia fish with violent tendencies (and leeches). They also do not eat fresh flesh; rather, once they catch a human, they submerge him in water for a few days to let him rot before eating him. ===End of the World=== ;The Narrator: A newcomer to \\"the End of the World\\". As an initiation into the Town, his Shadow is cut off and his eyes pierced to make him averse to daylight and give him the ability to \\"read dreams\\", his allotted task. He cannot remember his former life nor understand what has happened to him, but he knows that the answers are held in his mind, which his Shadow preserves. ;The Narrator's Shadow: Apparently human in form. He retains the narrator's memory of their former life together, but he is doomed to die, separated as he is, and is harshly (but not cruelly) treated by his custodian, the Gatekeeper. Upon his death, the narrator would then cease to have a \\"mind\\". The Shadow longs to escape from the Town and be reunited with the world where he and the narrator rightfully belong. ;The Gatekeeper: The guardian and maintenance foreman of \\"the End of the World\\". He instructs the narrator in his duties, and keeps the narrator’s Shadow effectively a prisoner, putting him to work – disposing of dead beasts who die during winter. ;The Librarian: The Town’s Librarian who keeps the beasts' skulls in which the \\"dreams\\" reside. She assists the narrator in his work. She has no \\"mind\\", but her mother did, and the narrator becomes increasingly convinced that her mind is in fact only hidden, not irretrievably lost. The connection between this Librarian and the other, in Hard-Boiled Wonderland, is never made explicit, although the narrator repeatedly mentions that she looks familiar. ;The Colonel: An old man, the narrator's neighbor, who provides advice and support, and nurses him when he falls sick. ;The Caretaker: A young man who tends the Power Station in the Town's dangerous Woods. He is an outsider who provides a miniature accordion, a possible key in the narrator's efforts to recover his mind and memories. The Caretaker is banished to the Woods because he still has a semblance of a mind, and cannot be allowed to live within the Town. ==Influences== Murakami has often referred to his love of Western literature and particular admiration for hard-boiled pioneer Raymond Chandler.. \\"Hard-Boiled Wonderland\\" owes much to American \\"hard-boiled\\" detective fiction, as well as to science fiction and cyberpunk, but the book does not belong in any of those categories. The \\"end of the world\\" has much in common with The Castle by Franz Kafka.https://www.bookwitty.com/reading_list/five-novels-that-influenced- haruki-murakamis/597f49ac50cef7495a265030 Both deal with newcomers to strange villages who are both intrigued and horrified by the behavior of the villagers. The image of losing one's shadow when approaching the end of the world is found in Knut Hamsun's 1898 novel Victoria. The same idea appeared earlier, in the 1814 story of \\"Peter Schlemihls wundersame Geschichte\\" (\\"Peter Schlemihl's Remarkable Story\\") by Adelbert von Chamisso. The theme of the human brain storing encrypted data is found in William Gibson's short story Johnny Mnemonic, but in interviews Murakami says this was not an influence. ==Critical reception== Jay Rubin, who has translated many of Murakami's later works into English, said that Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World is his favorite Murakami novel and that it \\"is just a shock after reading the black and white, autobiographical fiction that is such the norm in Japan.\\". The novel has received critical acclaim both domestically and internationally receiving praise from literary critics published in magazines such as The Japan Times, Publishers Weekly, and Kirkus Reviews. Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World was awarded the Tanizaki Prize in 1985. The book has been cited by filmmaker Rian Johnson as one of his favorite science fiction books and as an influence on his 2012 film Looper.https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/10f1ky/iam_rian_johnson_filmmaker/?limit=500 Murakami himself stated that Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World is his favorite among the books he wrote.http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2/the-art-of-fiction- no-182-haruki-murakami ==Influences in other works== The \\"End of the World\\" narrative is one of the inspirations for Yoshitoshi ABe in creating his Haibane Renmei, originally produced as a manga and later adapted as an anime series. Both works contain a city that people are not allowed to leave, a wall, a river, a library and a clock tower.. ==References== ==Further reading== * .

MobaHO! used the ISDB digital broadcast specification. The satellite, MBSat 1,MBSat (Gunter's Space Page) providing this service was jointly owned by SK Telecom of South Korea and Mobile Broadcasting Corporation (MBCO) of Japan; TU, South Korea's now defunct S-DMB mobile television service under SK Telecom, used to share same satellite. A number of receivers were available for this service: portable receivers with built-in QVGA LCD screens, car-use, a laptop-use PC card receiver, a mobile phone (by DoCoMo) and more. == Satellite == https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/mbsat-1.htm The service used the MBSat 1 (Mobile Broadcasting Satellite, also known as Hanbyul, COSPAR 2004-007A) satellite. The satellite was a joint venture of SK Telecom of South Korea and Mobile Broadcasting Corporation of Japan. The satellite was launched 13.03.2004 on an Atlas IIIA rocket. It was a Geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite, located at 120 degrees West. The broadcasting of the satellite ceased 31 March 2009. After the bankruptcy of MobaHO!, the satellite was sold to Asia Broadcasting Satellite (ABS) of China in 2013 and moved to 75 degrees East and renamed ABS 2i. Later it was named ABS 4 (Mobisat). ==Technical information== This service used ISO MPEG-4 Version 1 Simple Profile @ L3 video and AAC audio encapsulated in MPEG transport stream. The maximum supported resolution was 320x240 pixels (QVGA), and the maximum video bitrate was 384 kbit/s at a frame rate of 15 frames per second. Audio conformed to the ISO/IEC 13818-7 AAC LC (Low Complexity) profile, with maximum bitrate of 144 kbit/s and sampling rates up to 48 kHz. The transmission was scrambled using the MULTI2 cipher for conditional access. This service was broadcast over 2.6 GHz S-band by MBSat at 144.0°E. Left Circular polarized beam covered Japan, while Right Circular polarized beam covered South Korea. These beams were intended to be received by portable devices with omni-directional antennas. A single 150 W Ku band transponder on MBSat, operated at 12.226 GHz and Symbol rate of 18433 was used to broadcast identical contents to \\"Gap-fillers\\" (re- transmission devices) which were planned to be installed in train stations and subways, and other areas where the S-band satellite beam would not reach. This repeater broadcast was also scrambled using MULTI2. ==Financial issues== The company had expected to attract a million subscribers by 2008, but had only reached about a hundred thousand. The company ceased operations on March 31, 2009. ==Receiver devices== MTV-S10 by Toshiba, 4E-MB1 by SHARP, MBR0101B by MBCO, MBT0102A by MBCO - PC card type. This was the only device which allowed recording broadcasts. However, DRM technology was used to prohibit playback of recorded content without the receiver card present. Hardware encryption chip and presumably receiver serial number was used to encrypt the recording. * Mobile phone: Music Porter X by DoCoMo * and more ==Program Channels== Most MobaHO! music channels were produced in-house and featured popular genre in the Japanese and Korean languages for their respective markets.

Toward the end, they also carried New York City's WQXR, America's highest rated Classical music station, then owned by the New York Times. With a licensed bandwidth equal to that of both Sirius and XM, MobaHO! was able to offer approximately thirty predominantly music, audio channels plus seven video channels, including news, horse racing, and family and children's programming. ==See also== *Satellite - Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (S-DMB) *ISDB ==References== Category:Broadcasting in Japan ","title":"MobaHo!"},{"id":"1440020","text":"A radio reading service or reading service for the blind is a public service of many universities, community groups and public radio stations, where a narrator reads books, newspapers and magazines aloud for the benefit of the blind and vision-impaired. It is most often carried on a subcarrier, with radio receivers permanently tuned to a given station in the area, or an HD Radio subchannel of the offering station. Some reading services use alternative methods for reaching their audiences, including broadcasting over SAP, streaming Internet radio, cable TV, or even terrestrial TV. The International Association of Audio Information Services (IAAIS) serves as the primary member organization for radio reading services, and has member services or has consulted with and assisted local organizations in Canada, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, Panama, New Zealand, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. The first radio reading service in the United States was the Minnesota Radio Talking Book Network, started in 1969 by C. Stanley Potter and Robert Watson. After six years of researching the concept, a Kansas philanthropist learned of the Minnesota service, and with their help in 1971 Petey Cerf founded Audio- Reader, the second reading service in the nation, in Lawrence. In the late 1970s, Audio-Reader director Rosie Hurwitz and Stan Potter served as the first two presidents of the Association of Radio Reading Services, which came to be known as the National Association of Radio Reading Services, and, finally, IAAIS. The first radio reading service in Canada was founded by Richard Moses and Gordon Norman in Oakville, Ontario, in the basement of the Woodside Branch of the Oakville Public Library in the mid-1970s. In the United States, many public radio stations carry a local or regional reading service on an FM subcarrier. They are commonly affiliated with universities, libraries and other non-profit institutions. Reception of these stations require a special receiver, available at no cost to the listener, though most organizations require certification that the potential listener is unable to use normal printed material. Stations in other countries also carry such a service in this fashion. Some radio reading services are broadcast on standard FM stations. WRBH in New Orleans was the first full-time open channel radio reading service, although WRKC in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania has been broadcasting a two-hour-a-day service, the Radio Home Visitor, since 1974. WYPL in Memphis, Tennessee, run by volunteers of the Memphis Public Library, devotes nearly its entire broadcast day to a mixture of live readings and prerecorded readings overnight.

The American translation and its British adaptation, dubbed the \\"only official translations\\" (English) are by Jay Rubin and were first published in 1997. For this novel, Murakami received the Yomiuri Literary Award, which was awarded to him by one of his harshest former critics, Kenzaburō Ōe. == Publication history == The original Japanese edition was released in three parts, which make up the three \\"books\\" of the single volume English language version. # # # In English translation, two chapters were originally published in The New Yorker under the titles \\"The Zoo Attack\\" on July 31, 1995, and \\"Another Way to Die\\" on January 20, 1997.

In addition, the character name Noboru Wataya appears in the short story \\"Family Affair\\" in The Elephant Vanishes. While having a similar personality and background, the character is not related to the one in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle of the same name.

In May 2010, Harvill Secker published the Limited Centenary Edition of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle to celebrate its one hundred years of publishing. It was limited to 2,500 copies.The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: Limited Centenary edition ==Plot summary== The first part, \\"The Thieving Magpie\\", begins with the narrator, Toru Okada, a low-key and unemployed lawyer's assistant, being tasked by his wife, Kumiko, to find their missing cat. Kumiko suggests looking in the alley, a closed-off strip of land behind their house. After Toru stays there for a while with no luck, May Kasahara, a teenager who had been watching him camping out in the alley for some time, questions him. She invites him over to her house in order to sit on the patio and look over an abandoned house that she says is a popular hangout for stray cats. The abandoned house is revealed to possibly contain some strange omen, as it had brought bad luck to all of its prior tenants. It also contains an empty well, which Toru uses later to crawl into and think. Toru receives sexual phone calls from a woman who says she knows him. He also receives a phone call from Malta Kano who asks to meet with him. Kumiko calls Toru to explain that he should meet with the clairvoyant Malta Kano, who will help with finding the cat. Malta Kano had come recommended from her brother Noboru Wataya, which is also the name of the cat. Kumiko's family believes in fortune-telling and had previously stipulated that the couple meet with an elderly man, Mr. Honda, for consultations on a regular basis, which they did for some time. (Instead of giving advice, he spends most of their sessions retelling the same story of his experience in the Kwantung Army in the lost tank battle with the Russians at Nomonhan on the Manchukuo-Russian border during World War II.) Toru meets the mysterious Malta Kano at a busy hotel restaurant, and she tasks her sister Creta Kano to further the work. Both sisters wear unusual clothing: Malta a large red hat and Creta unstylish 1960's clothing. Creta meets Toru at his home and begins to tell him the story of her past, involving being raped by Noboru, but abruptly leaves. Toru notices Kumiko is wearing perfume that has been gifted to her by some unknown person. The cat remains missing. Toru is contacted by Lieutenant Mamiya, who informs Toru that Mamiya's old war friend corporal Honda has died and that Mamiya wishes to visit Toru to drop off an item that Honda had bequeathed to him. The first section ends with Lieutenant Mamiya arriving and telling Toru a long tale about his eerie and mystical wartime experiences in Manchukuo in the Kwantung Army, where he sees a man skinned alive. Mamiya was also left to die in a deep well before being saved by corporal Honda. The gift from Honda is an empty box. Kumiko is revealed to be missing at the start of the second part, \\"Bird as Prophet\\". Shortly after, Toru finds out through a meeting with Noboru and Malta that Kumiko has apparently been spending time with another man and wants to end her relationship with Toru. Confused, Toru tries several things to calm himself and think through the situation: talking and taking up work with May Kasahara, hiding at the bottom of the well, and loitering around the city looking at people. Work with May involves tallying up people with some degree of baldness at a subway line for a wig company. While at the bottom of the well (of the abandoned house), Toru reminisces about earlier times with Kumiko, including their first date to an aquarium where they looked at jellyfish. He also experiences a dreamlike sequence where he enters a hotel room and speaks with a woman, and notices a strange blue mark on his cheek after he leaves the well. While loitering in the city, he spends most of the day sitting outside a donut shop and people-watching. Through this activity, Toru encounters a well-dressed woman and also a singer he recognizes from his past, whom he follows and beats with a bat after getting ambushed by him. \\"The Birdcatcher\\", the third, final, and lengthiest part, ties up most loose ends while introducing a few new characters. The well-dressed woman Toru met while people-watching is revealed to be Nutmeg, whom he sees again when he reverts to people-watching. She hires him to relieve clients, middle-aged or older women, of some kind of inner turmoil that develops inside of them. The blue mark is involved in this somehow, though its power is never fully explained. In return, Toru receives pay and partial possession of the abandoned house that had been purchased to resell by some property agency. Cinnamon, Nutmeg's son, maintains the house and refits the well with a ladder and pulley to open and close the well cap from the bottom. Toru periodically goes to the bottom of the well to think and attempt to revisit the hotel room. The cat, who has been hardly mentioned following Kumiko's disappearance, shows up at Toru's home after nearly a year of being missing. Toru discusses Kumiko's disappearance with Noboru directly and indirectly (through his mole Ushikawa) and eventually arranges for a talk with her through the Internet, using her recollection of the jellyfish date as a means to verify her identity. Finally, Toru is able to travel to the hotel room from the well and confronts the woman, realizing that she is Kumiko and breaking the spell. It is revealed in this reality that Noboru has been beaten into a coma by a bat, with the assailant described to look just like Toru. An unknown man enters the hotel room and attacks Toru, the intruder, with a knife. Toru fights back with the bat and kills the man, before escaping back to the well. In the well, bruised and unable to move, Toru passes out after the well fills with water. Cinnamon saves him, and some days later Nutmeg notifies him that in this reality Noboru had a stroke and is now in a coma. Kumiko sends him a message on the computer to let him know she is alright but intends to kill Noboru by pulling the plug on the life support. She reveals that she did not cheat on Toru with just one man, in fact there were several, and all of them were Noboru's agents – his obsession with their middle sister, continued with Kumiko, triggered sex addiction in her until Noboru stepped in. Subsequently, in a discussion between Toru and May, Toru says Kumiko was successful and is now serving time in jail after admitting the deed—time of her own volition, because she is waiting for the media circus to end so neither she nor Toru are targeted. Toru says that he will wait for her, and bids May goodbye. ==Main characters== While this book has many major and minor characters, these are among the most important: *Toru Okada: The narrator and protagonist, Toru is a passive and often apathetic young man living in suburban Japan. He is Kumiko's husband and continually follows the orders or wishes of others. Toru is portrayed as an average man and the embodiment of passivity. He is a legal aid who is considering a law degree but has chosen to leave his job at a legal firm. He spends his days doing house chores, cooking pasta, listening to the radio, and searching for their missing cat. At the beginning of the novel, his life is mundane. Toru spends a lot of time alone and the reader can see that he is not in control of many aspects of his life. It is the search for their missing cat that leads him into interesting adventures. *Kumiko Okada: Kumiko is Toru's wife and, as the breadwinner of the couple, is the more autonomous of the two. She works in the publishing business. Following the disappearance of their cat, she disappears as well. Kumiko's childhood was stifling because her parents wanted her to take the place of an older sister who had committed suicide at a very young age, an event that became an obsession of their older brother, Noboru Wataya. *Noboru Wataya: Noboru is Kumiko's older brother. He is presented as a mediagenic figure; the public loves him, but Toru cannot stand him. Noboru first appears as an academic, becomes a politician during the course of the story, and has no apparent personal life. He is said to be hidden behind a façade — all style, and no substance. He is the antagonist. Noboru is constantly changing his image to defeat his opponents, but nobody seems to notice his inconsistencies except Toru. The relationship between Toru and Noboru can be compared to that of good versus evil. (\\"Noboru Wataya\\" is also the name Toru and Kumiko gave to their pet cat, whom Toru later renames Mackerel; the character name also appeared in \\"The Elephant Vanishes\\" and \\"Family Affair\\", both translated by Jay Rubin, in The Elephant Vanishes collection.) *May Kasahara: May is a teenage girl who should be in school, but, by choice, is not. Toru and May carry on a fairly constant exchange throughout a good deal of the novel; when May is not present, she writes letters to him. Their conversations in person are often bizarre and revolve around death and the deterioration of human life. Even more bizarre is the cheerful and decidedly non-serious air with which these conversations take place. *Lieutenant Mamiya: Lieutenant Tokutaro Mamiya was an officer in the Kwantung Army during the Japanese occupation of Manchukuo. He meets Toru while carrying out the particulars of Mr. Honda's will. (Honda had been a Corporal, therefore Mamiya had been his superior.) He has been emotionally scarred by witnessing the flaying of a superior officer and several nights spent in a dried-up well. He tells Toru his story both in person and in letters. *Malta Kano: Malta Kano is a medium of sorts who changed her name to \\"Malta\\" after performing some kind of \\"austerities\\" on the island of Malta. She is enlisted by Kumiko to help the Okadas find their missing cat. *Creta Kano: Malta's younger sister and apprentice of sorts, she describes herself as a \\"prostitute of the mind.\\" Her real given name is Setsuko. She had been an actual prostitute during her college years but quit after a session with a young Noboru Wataya, who effectively raped her with a foreign object as he was impotent. Disturbingly for Toru, Creta's body bears a near-identical resemblance to Kumiko's from the neck down. *Nutmeg Akasaka: Nutmeg first meets Toru as he sits on a bench watching people's faces every day in Shinjuku. The second time they meet she is attracted to the blue-black mark on his right cheek. She and Toru share a few strange coincidences: the wind-up bird in Toru's yard and the blue-black cheek mark appear in Nutmeg's World War II-related stories, and also Nutmeg's father and Lieutenant Mamiya (an acquaintance of Toru's) are linked by their experiences with violence and death in Manchukuo and the rise and dissolution of the Kwantung Army during World War II. \\"Nutmeg Akasaka\\" is a pseudonym she chose for herself after insisting to Toru that her \\"real\\" name is irrelevant. *Cinnamon Akasaka: Cinnamon is Nutmeg's adult son who has not spoken since the age of 6, owing to some events involving the cry of a wind-up bird and shock of finding a live heart buried under their garden tree. He communicates through a system of hand movements and mouthed words. Somehow, people who've just met him (who presumably have never lipread or used sign language) find him perfectly comprehensible. \\"Cinnamon,\\" too, is a pseudonym created by Nutmeg. He is described as a perfect reflection of his well groomed mother. * The Cat: Named Noboru Wataya after Kumiko's older brother, the cat symbolizes marital happiness between Kumiko and Toru. The cat leaving signifies the leaving of happiness in Kumiko and Toru’s marriage. Once the cat leaves, Kumiko and Toru suffer many difficulties but when the cat returns, though a little changed, it signifies that Toru is now ready to communicate with Kumiko and save her from the trap she has been placed in by her brother. == Themes == * Desire: The feeling of desire arises throughout the novel in a variety of characters. Throughout the novel, desire seems to manifest itself in negative and almost sickening ways. One example, is displayed through Noboru Wataya, who desires power. This desire for power unfortunately brings him to commit incestuous acts with his two younger sisters. One sister being alive with the other sister being deceased. In the beginning, Toru desires to make his wife happy by going on these long day trips to find her missing cat. His desire for her leads him to strange places where he discovers more about his inner self. Kumiko has many sexual desires which leads her to be unfaithful to Toru, resulting in Kumiko catching an STD. Throughout the novel desire leads the characters to dark places. * Power: The characters in the novel are constantly gaining or losing power and the plot develops around this ever-changing factor. Noboru Wataya is mainly focused on gaining power which in turn causes his younger sister Kumiko to lose power to him, she becomes a victim of his desire for power. The loss of power of the character Kumiko leads Toru to gain power. Once Kumiko goes missing, this event forces Toru to find power within him to step out if his normalcy and comfort zone to find Kumiko and save her from her brother. This leads him on a mission to set Kumiko free of the reins her brother holds her in. Translating to a gain in his sense of power. He finds power within himself and his desire to set Kumiko free. Power also shows in the characters as they try to gain control over their own emotions. * Polar opposites: Throughout the novel, one can see many examples of the characters being polar opposites. One main polar opposite occurs in the beginning of the book between the two women in Toru's life. The mysterious woman who calls Toru throughout the beginning presents herself very sexually and powerful. She is very confident in speaking with Toru even while he is resistant to hearing what she has to say. Where as, Kumiko, Toru's wife, is very shy and soft spoken in the interactions with Toru. Another example of polar opposites is between Noboru Wataya, Kumiko's Brother, and Toru. Noboru Wataya is hungry for power and is presented as a strong and disrespectful character. Whereas, Toru is presented as a very shy, soft spoken, respectful, and down to earth character. Creta Kano points out this polar opposite within the novel stating “Noboru Wataya is a person who belongs to a world that is the exact opposite of yours.” The contrast of polar opposite characters provides more depth and individuality to each character alone. * Alienation: Throughout the novel the characters are obviously related to each other but they never feel like they connect to one another. All of the characters develop independently and tend to live solitary lifestyles. This can be presented in Toru and Kumiko’s marriage. Throughout the novel, Toru presents himself to be one who seeks solitude. One example is presented as he completes an everyday task, “I went to the Municipal pool for a swim. Mornings were the best, to avoid the crowds”. His desire for solitude also is shown when he quits his job to take care of the house alone while Kumiko goes to work. He enjoys being home alone. In the relationship between Kumiko and Toru, both characters seem to be developing in solitude. Both characters hide many of their thoughts from one another and even though they are married Toru ponders on the fact that he may not know much about his wife. ==Missing chapters and parts== Some chapters and paragraphs of the Japanese paperback edition were not included in the English translation. Translator Jay Rubin cut about 61 of 1,379 pages, including three chapters (Book 2 Chapters 15, 18, and part of 17; and Book 3 Chapter 26).Lost Chapters in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: A Translation and Commentary – Kieran Maynard's analysis of chapters missing in the English version Combining the original three-volumes (Japanese) would have been too long, and so the publisher requested that ~25,000 words be cut for the English translation.Translating Murakami, an email roundtable, with Jay Rubin and Philip Gabriel (translators of Murakami), and Gary Fisketjon (Murakami's editor at Knopf). These chapters contain plot elements not found elsewhere in the book. For example, the two missing chapters from the second volume of the original three-volume elaborate on the relationship between Toru Okada and Creta Kano, and a \\"hearing\\" of the wind-up bird as Toru burns a box of Kumiko's belongings (Book 2 Chapter 15). In the third volume, the computer conversation between Toru and Noboru Wataya (Book 3 Chapter 26) and Toru's encounter with Ushikawa at the train station are also omitted.Lost Chapters in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: A Translation and Commentary – Kieran Maynard's analysis of chapters missing in the English version In addition to reducing the word count, some chapters were moved ahead of others, taking them out of the context of the original order. At the start of Book 3 the chapters have been rearranged. Rubin combined two chapters called “May Kasahara’s POV” and moved the “Hanging House” chapter to make the chronology of events consistent.Lost Chapters in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: A Translation and Commentary – Kieran Maynard's analysis of chapters missing in the English version Book 2 chapter 15 summary: In chapter 15 Toru awakens to Creta Kano who mysteriously appeared in his bed the night before. She tells him that she has lost her name and asks if he would like to flee Japan with her. To this request he agrees and leaves behind memorabilia of his old life with his wife. While Toru is in town gathering supplies for his flee he reads an article about Noboru Wataya, the article explains that Noboru is now trying to become a politician. Chapter 17 is not completely removed, instead the excerpt where Toru takes passport photos is removed and the very lengthy conversation Toru has with his uncle about buying real estate is condensed into one English paragraph. Book 2 Chapter 18 summary: Creta Kano returns to Japan and Toru tells her that he will not be fleeing with her. After this he meets with May Kasahara and they watch the demolition of the Miyawaki house. Later in the chapter Toru is swimming at the ward pool where he dreams in the pool about floating at the bottom of the well, presented in earlier chapters, and hearing horses dying during an eclipse. This leads him to the realization that the mysterious woman on the phone was actually his wife. Ending book 2 with this cliff hanger. ==Translation== The English translation of the novel was carried out by Jay Rubin. In addition to notable differences between the Japanese and English versions, there are also differences between the original Japanese hardcover and paperback editions. Further differences exist between the American and British editions, but these are much more superficial. The German translation by Giovanni and Ditte Bandini is based on the English translation, not on the Japanese original.Haruki Murakami, Mister Aufziehvogel, Cologne 1998, p. 3 The Dutch translation by Jacques Westerhoven was translated directly from the Japanese original, therefore includes the missing parts and chapters, and follows the same order as the Japanese version. ==Adaptation== An adaptation of the novel was created by Stephen Earnhart, a live production of it premiered in 2011 at the Edinburgh International Festival.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/edinburgh- festival/8707226/Edinburgh-Festival-2011-Stephen-Earnhart-on-The-Wind-Up-Bird- Chronicle.html ==Notes== ==External links== *East Meets West, the New York Times Book Review *The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle – Literary Encyclopedia *Exorcising Ghosts Page with plenty of links to reviews * The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, reviewed by Ted Gioia (The New Canon) * The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle at Complete Review *The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle Multimedia Theatre Production Stephen Earnhart's multimedia adaptation of Murakami's novel *Lost Chapters in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: A Translation and Commentary Kieran Maynard's analysis of chapters missing in the English version Category:Novels by Haruki Murakami Category:1994 novels Category:1995 novels Category:Japanese magic realism novels Category:Shinchosha books Category:Books with cover art by Chip Kidd Category:Three-volume novels Category:Novels about cats ","title":"The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle"},{"id":"1440036","text":"Northern Seminary is a Christian seminary in Lisle, Illinois. ==History== It was founded in 1913 by the Second Baptist Church of Chicago as Northern Baptist Theological Seminary to prepare students for church leadership and it continues to represent a theologically conservative alternative within its association with American Baptist Churches USA (historically the Northern Baptist convention).

From 1980 to 2014, it organized and sanctioned role-playing games worldwide. ==History== Frank Mentzer, one of the first full-time employees of TSR, Inc., the original publishers of the Dungeons and Dragons game, conceived of the Role Playing Game Association (RPGA) in order to promote quality roleplaying and to allow fans of roleplaying games to meet and play games with each other. Mentzer founded RPGA in November 1980 primarily to run tournaments at gaming conventions using TSR's top sellers: AD&D;, Gamma World and Top Secret. At each tournament, a Dungeon Master and four to eight players would play a 4-hour adventure supplied by the RPGA. Each player was given a pre-generated character with a background, equipment, and some limited information about the other characters at the table. At the end of the adventure, the players and Dungeon Master would select one player at the table as the \\"winner\\" of the adventure, based on his or her knowledge of the rules and role-playing ability. All players were awarded experience points based on how well they did in competitive events, and could add to that experience point total at the next event, allowing them, over time to advance to higher levels. Membership was originally paid by a yearly fee, and included a subscription to Polyhedron magazine. In the early years, membership was largely limited to North America, but in 1989, the RPGA Network branched out into Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the U.K., Israel, and Australia. In 1987, Instead of presenting single adventures that were not linked to any previous or subsequent adventures, RPGA conceived of a long-term endeavour, called a living campaign, where the actions of the players would have an impact on the overall campaign story arc. The first campaign of this type was Living City, a series of adventures set in the city of Raven's Bluff. The first \\"Living City\\" module was \\"Caravan\\" released in August of 1987 at Gen Con. Unlike previous RPGA tournament play, where players were given a pre-generated character, Living City adventures required each player to provide their own character. Previously, experience points had been accumulated by the player, but now experience points were accumulated by the player's character. Bringing the same character back to subsequent adventures allowed that character to accumulate more experience points and greater powers. In order to have an effect on the overall storyline, at the end of each adventure, the players would send the result of their play to RPGA headquarters for compilation. Success or failure by a majority of players would result in a change to the campaign storyline. For example, if most players in a particular adventure succeeded in lifting a curse, the curse would not appear in future adventures. Living City proved to be a popular concept, and in the first decade of the twenty-first century, RPGA created a variety of living campaigns. The largest was Living Greyhawk, played by thousands of people around the world from 2000 to 2008. At this point, RPGA had members on all continents of the world except Antarctica. In 2002, RPGA membership became free, but the subscription to Polyhedron was no longer included as a membership benefit because the magazine had been bought by Paizo Publishing, who then published it as a section of Dungeon. In 2014, WotC shut down the RPGA, replacing it with the D&D; Adventurer's League. ==See also== *Living campaigns ==References== Category:Role-playing game associations ","title":"RPGA"},{"id":"1440068","text":"According to the Hebrew Bible, the Zuzim or Zuzites (meaning \\"restless\\" or \\"roaming\\") were a tribe who lived in Ham, a land east of the Jordan River between Bashan and Moab.

The Talaud Islands are also the northernmost region of Eastern Indonesia, bordering south of the Philippines' Davao Region. The group, with a total area of 495 square miles (1,281 square km), includes Karakelong (the largest), Salibabu, Kabaruan, and numerous islets. The coast of Karakelong Island is steep except on the southern shore, which is fringed by a wide reef. The seven tiny Nanusa Islands lie north-east of Karakelong. They are forested and with hills rising to 2,231 feet (680 metres). ==Description== The islands were declared a regency of North Sulawesi in 2000 as Kabupaten Kepulauan Talaud. Talaud's capital is Melonguane. The largest islands of the Talaud group are Karakelong Island, Salibabu Island, Kabaruan, the Nanusa Islands (the largest of which are Merampit and Karatung) and Miangas to the north. Population was 83,441 according to the 2010 census; the latest official estimate (as at 2018) is 91,599.Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2019. Grouping Talaud together with Sangihe, there are 77 islands in the Talaud-Sangihe archipelagos, of which 56 are inhabited. The total population of the Talaud and Sangihe islands was 209,574 in 2010. Most of the population are involved in agriculture, which includes coconuts, vanilla, nutmeg, and cloves. Numerous volcanoes produce very fertile volcanic soil on many of the islands.

Depending on various points of view, such a scenario is presented as a desirable one-state solution to resolving the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, or as a calamity in which Israel would ostensibly lose its character as a Jewish state and the Palestinians would fail to achieve their national independence within a two- state solution. Increasingly, Isratin is being discussed not as an intentional political solutiondesired or undesiredbut as the probable, inevitable outcome of the continuous growth of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the seemingly irrevocable entrenchment of the Israeli occupation there since 1967. == Popular support == The belief of both proponents and detractors of the Isratin scenario is that a single state in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, would provide citizenship and equal rights in the combined entity for all its inhabitants, without regard to ethnicity or religion. It is precisely for such reason that such a scenario is regarded by the majority of Israelis and Palestinians as unthinkable. The Israeli political left-wing, both Jewish and Arab, argues that continuing Jewish West Bank settlement is creating a situation whereby Israel and the West Bank would become either an apartheid state with full civil rights for Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs and limited autonomy for Palestiniansas currently practiced under the Palestinian Authorityor a bi-national state in which Zionist Israel would cease to exist as a homeland of the Jewish people. Similar arguments are raised by Palestinian leaders, who frequently warn Israelis and the international community that time is rapidly running out for the implementation of the two- state solution as the Jewish West Bank settlements continue to expand. Despite their diaspora-style support of the Palestinian cause, a large majority of Israeli Arabs fiercely oppose any political solution which would reduce their status as purely Israeli citizens, including any one-state solution which would effectively merge them with the West Bank Palestinians from which they have developed separatelyboth economically and politicallyfor over 70 years. Israeli Arabs are economically much better off than their Palestinian cousins. In a positive sense, while some advocate Isratin as a one-state solution for ideological reasons, others feel that due to the reality on the ground, it is the only practicable solution.Logic of Implosion at the Reut Institute. A bi- national solution enjoys the support of about a quarter of the Palestinian electorate, according to polls conducted by the Jerusalem Media and Communications Center.Poll No. 63 by JMCC A multi-option poll by Near East Consulting (NEC) in November 2007 found the bi-national state to be less popular than either \\"two states for two people\\" or \\"a Palestinian state on all historic Palestine\\".Near East Consulting November 2007 However, in February 2007 NEC found that around 70% of Palestinian respondents backed the idea when given a straight choice of either supporting or opposing \\"a one-state solution in historic Palestine where Muslims, Christians and Jews have equal rights and responsibilities\\".Near East Consulting February 2007 Among Palestinians, opponents of the idea include Islamists, who argue that it would run contrary to the goal of an Islamic State and some Arab nationalists, who criticize it for going against the idea of Pan-Arabism. Israeli opponents argue that one state would erode the notion of Israel as a Jewish state. The main obstacle is the fact that demographic trends show the likelihood of a near-term majority Arab population west of the Jordan River (including the land within the internationally recognized borders of the state of Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza). The probability that Palestinians would constitute an electoral majority in a bi-national state is seen by many Israeli Jews as a threat to the very premise of Israel, explicitly created as a Jewish state in the aftermath of the Holocaust. A 2000 poll soon after the outbreak of the second intifada found 18% of Israeli Jews supported a binational solution.Public Opinion Polls by JMCC == Modern background == Israel's capture of the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt in the Six-Day War of 1967 recommenced the pre-1948 discourse concerning the one-state scenario, while at the same time giving the two-state solution arguably the only window of opportunity to become a reality. Israel's victory over its neighbours was greeted by euphoria within Israel, but some critical Israeli and foreign observers quickly recognised the new territories could pose a major long-term problem, and a considerable debate followed about what to do next. One option was the one-state solution: to annex the newly acquired territories (extend Israeli law and sovereignty to the new territories) and give the Palestinians living in these territories Israeli citizenship, similar to the Israeli Arabs who were absorbed into Israel as a result of the 1948 war. However, the vast majority of Israelis, left and right, including political parties supporting the West Bank settlement movement, feared that such a solution would significantly dilute Israel's Jewish majority. In the early 1980s, the pro- settlements Likud Prime Minister Menachem Begin, supported Palestinian autonomy under eventual Israeli sovereignty. The Labour Party supported territorial compromise with a Jordanian-Palestinian state under Hashemite rule. The abject defeat of Arab armies in 1967 led to an initial rejectionist attitude in some Arab circles, most notably the Khartoum Resolution a few months after the war, which stated there would be “no peace, recognition of, or negotiations” with Israel. However, this position eased over time, ultimately leading to an almost dogmatic Palestinian acceptance of the notion of a two-state solution which persisted until the rise of Hamas in the 2000s. The outcome of the 1973 Yom Kippur War prompted a fundamental political rethink among the Palestinian leadership. It was realised that Israel's military strength and, crucially, its alliance with the United States made it unlikely that it could be defeated militarily. In December 1974, Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), then regarded as a terrorist group by the Israeli government, declared that a bi-national state was the only viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The change in policy was met with considerable confusion, as it was official PLO policy to replace Israel with a secular and democratic state with a full right of return for all displaced Palestinians, including the Jews who were living in Palestine before 1948. This would effectively have ended Israel's Jewish majority and, by secularising the state, would have weakened its exclusive Jewish character. In short, a bi-national state on the PLO's terms would mean a very different kind of Israel or no Israel at all. This prospect was always strongly opposed by all sides in Israeli politics. But while the Arab side was re-adjusting its position, the two-state solution was dealt a heavy blow as Israel (in the 1980s) and subsequently the powerful, semi-autonomous settlement movement (in the 1990s and thereafter), implemented the controversial policy of Jewish settlements in the territories, establishing \\"facts on the ground\\" while keeping open the question of the Palestinians' long-term fate. As early as 1973, the prospect of a bi-national state was being used by prominent figures on the Israel left to warn against holding on to the territories. For example, Histadrut Secretary General I. Ben-Aharon warned in a March 1973 article for The Jerusalem Post that Israel could not have any real control over a bi- national state and that Israelis should be satisfied with a state already containing a sizable Arab minority in Israel proper. With the advent of the Oslo peace process in the 1990s, the two-state solution appeared to be the sole option on the table, the general understanding being that its implementation would require evacuation of the non-contiguous and isolated Jewish settlements. The idea of resolving the original conflict by establishing a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in return for peace, while retaining the large settlement blocs contiguous to pre-1967 Israel, seemed to present a modicum of fairness. Although the initial reaction of the Palestinians and of the neighboring Arab states was not encouraging, after 1993 diplomatic pressure from the United States, Russia, European countries, and the United Nations served to begin the process of almost institutionalizing the concept of the two-state solution as the only decent approach to the problem. The two-state solution has become a virtual dogma in Israeli–Palestinian official discussions: it was the basis of the Madrid Conference (1991), the Oslo Accords (1993), the Interim agreement (1995), the Hebron Protocol (1997), the Wye River Memorandum (1998), and so-called \\"Road Map\\" (2002). However, these agreements are rejected by various factions on the Palestinian side, most notably Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The Oslo Accords were never fully adopted and implemented by both sides. After the Second Intifada in 2000, many believe that the two-state solution is increasingly losing its feasibility. On the Israeli side, Likud and Labour both opposed withdrawal to the pre-1967 borders or setting up a Palestinian state, and both supported building more Jewish settlements in the territories and maintaining exclusive Israeli control over Jerusalem. However, Labour argued for building strategic settlements only in areas Israel intended to keep, such as the Jordan Valley and the surroundings of East Jerusalem, while handing the rest back to Jordan, claiming that the alternative would result in a bi-national state and so \\"the end of the Zionist endeavour\\". Many on the left of Israeli politics were already warning that without a clean separation from the Palestinians, the outcome would be either a bi-national state by default (thus ending Israel's Jewish character) or a South African-style \\"Bantustan\\" with a Jewish minority forcibly ruling a disenfranchised Arab majority (thus ending Israel's claims to be a democracy). Despite this, opposition to bi-nationalism was not absolute. Some of those on the Israel right associated with the settler movement were willing to contemplate a bi-national state as long as it was established on Zionist terms. Originally, members of Menachem Begin's Likud government in the late 1970s were willing to support the idea if it would ensure formal Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank and Gaza. Begin's chief of staff, Eliahu Ben-Elissar, told the Washington Post in November 1979 that \\"we can live with them and they can live with us. I would prefer they were Israeli citizens, but I am not afraid of a bi-national state. In any case, it will always be a Jewish state with a large Arab minority.\\" The construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier after 2003, strongly opposed by the ideological part of the West Bank Jewish settler movement, was widely deemed as an attempt to not only curtail Palestinian suicide bombings but also to define where a future international border might run and eventually extricate Israel from most of the West Bank. This impression was reinforced by the Israel's unilateral disengagement plan implemented by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in the Gaza Strip and the northern West Bank in 2005, which was then widely regarded as the death knell of the trans-security barrier settlements. However, since such time, these settlements have continued to grow considerably, not as a result of Israeli government policy (which often opposed such growth) but rather as a result of the organizational and economic abilities of the powerful and highly motivated settlement movement. The majority of Israelis do not cross the security barrier into Palestinian- populated areas, and know little or nothing of these developments on the ground which could have a fateful influence on the future of Israel. Among Palestinians, Israel's opposition to a bi-national state led to another change of position which evolved gradually from the late 1970s onwards. The PLO retained its original option of a single secular bi-national state west of Jordan, but began to take the position that it was prepared to accept a separate Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza in land from which Israel had withdrawn under Security Council Resolution 242. Israeli settlements would need to be dismantled and Palestinian refugees allowed to return (to Israel as well as the new Palestine). This new position, formally adopted in December 1988, was overwhelmingly rejected by Israeli public and the main political parties but was later used as the basis of peace discussions in the 1990s. Various Israelis and Palestinians who oppose a one-state solution have come to believe that it may come to pass. Israeli Prime Minister Olmert argued, in a 2007 interview with the Israeli daily Haaretz, that without a two-state agreement Israel would face \\"a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights\\" in which case \\"Israel [would be] finished\\".\\"Olmert to Haaretz: Two- state solution, or Israel is done for\\", Haaretz, Nov. 29, 2007. This echoes comments made in 2004 by Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei, who said that if Israel failed to conclude an agreement with the Palestinians, that the Palestinians would pursue a single, bi-national state. Several other high- level Fatah Palestinian Authority officials have voiced similar opinions, including Hani Al-Masri. In 2004, Yasser Arafat said “time is running out for a two-state solution” in an interview with Britain's The Guardian newspaper. Many political analysts, including Omar Barghouti, believe that the death of Arafat harbingers the bankruptcy of the Oslo Accords and the two-state solution. The prominent proponents for the one-state solution include Muammar al-Gaddafi of Libya (see also Saif Islam Qaddafi Isratin proposal), Palestinian author Ali Abunimah, Palestinian-American producer Jamal Dajani, Palestinian lawyer Michael Tarazi, Jeff Halper, Israeli writer Dan Gavron, Israeli historian Ilan Pappé, Palestinian-American law professor George Bisharat,\\"Two-State Solution Sells Palestine Short,\\" CounterPunch, January 31-February 1, 2004 Lebanese-American academic Saree Makdisi, and American academic Virginia Tilley. They cite the expansion of the Israeli Settler movement, especially in the West Bank, as a compelling rationale for bi- nationalism and the increased unfeasibility of the two-state alternative. They advocate a secular and democratic state while still maintaining a Jewish presence and culture in the region. They concede that this alternative will erode the dream of Jewish supremacy in terms of governance in the long run.Arab News  World  One-state solution gains supporters == Saif al-Islam Gaddafi Isratin proposal == The Gaddafi Isratin proposal intended to permanently resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict through a secular, federalist, republican one-state solution, which was first articulated by Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of Muammar Gaddafi of Libya, at the Chatham House in London and later adopted by Muammar Gaddafi himself. Its main points are: * Creation of a binational Jewish-Palestinian state called the \\"Federal Republic of the Holy Land\\"; * Partition of the state into 5 administrative regions, with Jerusalem as a city-state; * Return of all Palestinian refugees; * Supervision by the United Nations of free and fair elections on the first and second occasions; * Removal of weapons of mass destruction from the state; * Recognition of the state by the Arab League. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi's proposal was eventually incorporated in Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi's White Book of 8 May 2003, which served as his official guide to address the Arab–Israeli conflict and how to solve it. Despite the suggestion of \\"Federal Republic of the Holy Land\\" as the name of this hypothetical new state, the name Isratin (, ; , ), a portmanteau of the names \\"Israel\\" and \\"Falastin\\" (\\"Palestine\\" in Arabic and Hebrew)variously spelled in English as \\"Isratine\\" or \\"Israteen\\" and sometimes rendered \\"Israstine\\"has been used as a \\"working title\\" for the notion of a single state in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with Palestinians and Jewish inhabitants of all three having citizenship and equal rights in the combined entity. Muammar Gaddafi again championed the \\"Isratin proposal\\" in an op-ed article for the New York Times as the \\"only option\\" for a solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The timing of the article approximately coincided with the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the U.S. and with the cease-fire that apparently marked the end of the Gaza War (2008–09). Gaddafi argued that this solution would avoid the partitioning of West Bank into Arab and Jewish zones, with buffer zones between them. == Criticisms == Palestine. The Isratin scenario is generally criticized by a majority of both Israelis and Palestinians. Critics on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute argue that such an entity would destroy the rights of both societies to self-determination. Israeli Jews generally assume that a one-state scenario would negate Israel's status as a homeland for the Jewish people. When proposed as a political solution by non-Israelis (as distinct from gradually sliding into an Isratin situation by virtue of continuous Jewish West Bank settlement) the natural assumption is that the idea is most probably being put forward by those who are politically motivated to harm Israel. Most Israelis, including Israeli Jews, Israeli Druze, the majority of Israeli Bedouin, many Israeli Christian Arabs and some Israeli Muslim Arabs, fear the consequences of amalgamation with a population that may carry a different culture, level of secularism and level of democracy. (Israeli Druze and Bedouin serve in the IDF and there are sometimes rifts between these groups and Palestinians.) Critics state that the existing level of rights and equality for all Israeli citizens would be put in jeopardy.One-state solution a pipedream Ynetnews. Furthermore, residents of the large Israeli Arab population centers in Wadi Ara and the Triangle, contiguous with the West Bank, have expressed fierce opposition to their areas being annexed to the Palestinian state within a land swap in the final status agreement and assumedly would respond similarly to an Isratin proposition under which they would by default be deemed to be more Palestinian than Israeli. Students of the Middle East, including erstwhile critic of Israel Benny Morris, have argued that the one-state solution is not viable because of Arab unwillingness to accept a Jewish national presence in the Middle East.Jeffrey Goldberg, \\"No Common Ground,\\" New York Times, May 20, 2009 In a 2007 poll of 580 Israelis, 70% of Israeli Jews stated that they support the two-state solution. A 2005 poll of 1,319 Palestinians indicated that a small majority of those in the West Bank and Gaza Strip support the two-state solution based on the 1967 borders. == See also == * Hannah Arendt * Hugo Bergmann * Ghada Karmi * Multiculturalism * Israel, Palestinians, and the United Nations * Two Stars for Peace solution == References == == External links == * Settlers and Palestinians who prefer a bi-national state, Ha'aretz. * Proposal for an Alternative Configuration in Palestine-Israel by Alternative Palestinian Agenda. * Israel: The Alternative by Tony Judt. * The One-State Solution by Virginia Tilley. * The One-State Solution by Daniel Lazare. * What’s Wrong with the One-State Agenda? by Hussein Ibish. * One-state solution a pipedream by Ray Hanania. * Why advocating a one-state solution does not help the Palestinians by Dan Fleshler. == Bibliography == * Abunimah, Ali, One Country, A Bold Proposal to End the Israeli-Palestinian Impasse New York: Metropolitan Books, 2006 * \\"Palestine – Divided or United?

Khokhloma (also Hohloma, ; ) or Khokhloma painting (, Khokhlomskaya rospis) is the name of a Russian wood painting handicraft style and national ornament, known for its curved and vivid mostly flower, berry and leaf patterns. Often Firebird, the figure from the Russian fairytale, is also depicted. A combination of red, black, and gold are typical colors for Khokhloma. When painted on wood, in most cases red, black, green, yellow and orange are used over a gold background. The effect it has when applied to wooden tableware or furniture, making it look heavier and metallic. ==History== Khokhloma painting on a wooden ladle in the shape of a swan, made in alt= The style is named for the village of Khokhloma () in Koverninsky District, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, Volga region, where it first appeared in the second half of the 17th century. The production of painted dishes in Khokhloma is first mentioned in 1659 in the letter of a boyar called Morozov to his bailiff, containing an order for the following: \\"One hundred painted dishes polished with powdered tin, both large and medium, of the very same kind possessed by us earlier, not forgetting twenty large painted wine bowls, twenty medium, and twenty somewhat smaller\\".Khokhloma Ware: Folk art for the masses by Stuart King The handicraft owes its origin to the Old Believers, who, fleeing from persecutions of officials, took refuge in local woods. Even earlier, however, local villagers had experience in making tableware from soft woods. Among the schismatics there were icon-painters, who taught local craftsmen the special technique of painting wood in a golden color without the use of genuine real gold. Ivan Bakanov. Khokhloma artists at work. alt= Articles carved out of wood (mostly tableware) were usually primed with clay mortar, raw linseed oil, and tin powder (nowadays aluminum is used). A floral pattern was then painted on top of this coating with a brush. After that, the articles were coated with linseed oil (nowadays, synthetic oil) and hardened in a kiln at high temperatures. There are two principal wood painting techniques used in the Khokhloma, such as the so-called \\"superficial technique\\" (red and black colors over the goldish one) and the \\"background technique\\" (a goldish silhouette- like design over the colored background). In its early days Khokhloma became known in the Orient and the art of wood were produced for Indian and Persian markets. Through an exhibition in Paris at the end of the 19th century, the Khokhloma style became known in the west. The style seemed to be fading away in the early 20th century, but it revitalized during the Soviet times. The Khokhloma craftsmen united into artels in the 1920s to early 1930s. In the 1960s, the Soviets built a factory called the Khokhloma Painter near the Khokhloma village and an industrial association called the Khokhloma Painting in a town of Semyonov. These two factories have become the Khokhloma centers of Russia and produce tableware, utensils (mostly spoons), furniture, souvenirs etc. Unique works of Khokhloma art can be seen in a Khokhloma Museum that was opened in the factory of Semyonov in 1972. Among them there is a huge Khokhloma spoon 2 meters and 67 cm large and a bowl one and a half meter large. ==Gallery== File:Nischni Nowgorod PD 2010 070.JPGKhokhloma during production File:Khokhloma Hochloma 20090814 02.JPGKhokhloma wares File:Nischni Nowgorod PD 2010 072.JPGKhokhloma giant spoon ==See also== *List of Russian inventions ==References== ==External links== Category:Russian handicrafts Category:Handicrafts Category:Russian inventions ","title":"Khokhloma"},{"id":"1440103","text":"Limbach Flugmotoren (Limbach Aero Engines) is a German company that produces aircraft engines. ==History== The company is named after Peter Limbach who expanded his father's engine repair business in the 1970s in Königswinter.

Spending most of his time in the magical warehouse of the priest, Brachetti learnt all kind of magic tricks. At the age of 15, using costumes borrowed from the seminary's theatre, he invented and performed his first quick-change act, an art introduced to the world by Leopoldo Fregoli (1867-1936). His professional career began in 1978 in France at the parisian cabaret Paradis Latin, under the direction of Jean Marie Rivière. This led to a starring role in André Heller's German production of \\"Flic Flac\\"(1981).

The name Stroviol refers to a violin, but other instruments have been modified with the amplification device, including the viola, cello, double bass, ukulele, mandolin, and guitar. John Matthias Augustus Stroh, an electrical engineer in London, invented the instrument in 1899. ==Description== Busker playing a Stroh violin in alt=Playing a Romanian: Vioara cu goarnă in Antwerp The Stroh violin has two horns, one positioned at the end of the fingerboard to project the sound to an audience or recording horn, and a smaller monitoring horn that allowed the player to hear their own sound more clearly. The Stroh violin is much louder than a standard wooden violin, and its directional projection of sound made it particularly useful in the early days of phonographic recording. Wooden violins recorded poorly with the early acoustic-mechanical recording method, and the Stroh violin improved this by producing a fuller, louder sound. Stroh violins were common in recording studios, but became rarer after record companies switched to the new electric microphone recording technology in the second half of the 1920s. ==Invention== On 4 May 1899, Stroh applied for a UK patent, GB9418 titled Improvements in Violins and other Stringed Instruments which was accepted on 24 March 1900. This described the use of a flat metal (other materials are also mentioned) diaphragm in the voice-box (reproducer) of a violin to mechanically amplify the sound. Then on 16 February 1901 he applied for a second UK patent, GB3393 titled Improvements in the Diaphragms of Phonographs, Musical Instruments, and analogous Sound-producing, Recording and Transmitting Contrivances. Which was accepted on 14 December 1901. This effectively extended the first concept to now use a conical resonator with corrugations at its edge, allowing a more 'rigid' diaphragm. His failure to register his inventions in the USA allowed John Dopyera and Geo Beauchamp to subsequently obtain US patents for the tricone and single cone designs used in National brand instruments. ==Usage== Stroh violin at the Museu de la Música de Barcelona Man playing a Stroh violin in a New Orleans Mardi Gras parade The Stroh violin was an expensive instrument: in 1911 it was offered by the London dealers Barnes & Mullins for nine guineas (£9.45, then equal to $37.80) or twelve guineas (£12.60/$50.40) at a time when a reasonable factory violin could be had for two guineas. It was listed as being especially suitable for use in small theaters and music- halls. In 1920s Buenos Aires, Julio de Caro, a renowned Tango orchestra director and violinist, used the Stroh violin in his live performances, and was called violín-corneta (cornet violin) by the locals. A number of musicians, including Tom Waits, Carla Kihlstedt, Thomas Newman, Bat for Lashes, A Hawk and a HacksawPicture of the duo on their homepage with Heather Trost holding a Stroh violin. and Eric Gorfain continue to use the Stroh violin for its distinctive sound. Shakira featured a Stroh violin on her 2010/11 The Sun Comes Out World Tour, with multi-instrumentalist Una Palliser playing it on some songs. Palliser also played Stroh violin on a Tom Hickox album and live with Bitter Ruin.http://www.meewella.com/artist/gallery/bitterruinjuly2012/Una+Palliser+-+Strohviol3.JPG.html Pinky Weitzman plays the Stroh violin for various New York experimental ensembles, including her own project (Not Waving but Drowning), as well as Flare, LD & the New Criticism, and as part of the onstage ensemble for Stephin Merritt's My Life as a Fairy Tale. A Stroh violin is regularly played by Andy Stein of Vince Giordano's Nighthawks, a New York–based band specializing in the music of the 1920s and 1930s. They Might Be Giants used a Stroh violin in their song \\"I Can Hear You\\", recorded on a wax cylinder at the Edison Laboratory. Lindsey Stirling features a Stroh violin in her video \\"Roundtable Rival\\". ==Similar designs== Other makers created similar designs, such as Howson, which made brass-horned phono instruments including single-stringed phono fiddles and four-stringed phono ukuleles. The violinophone was made in Prague in the early 20th century. This instrument has a diaphragm mounted vertically in a violin body under the bridge. The sound is carried through a tube to the horn which protrudes from the violin to a long horn which wraps around the shoulder. —a violin that amplifies its sound through a metal resonator and metal horns rather than a wooden sound box as on a standard violin. Willy Tiebel in Markneukirken Germany made Stroh violin copies in the 1920s. The Stroh violin is closely related to other horned violins using a mica sheet-resonating diaphragm, known as phonofiddles. In the present day, many types of horn-violin exist, especially in the Balkans. == Romanian horn- violin == The Romanian horn-violin is similar to the Stroh violin. It was built through the 20th century. It has the same length as the Stroh violin, but its horn is narrower and yields a more directional sound. The structure of the instrument is based on the tungsten element of a gramophone. Amateurs or small workshops could easily build it and, perhaps for that reason, many variants exist in Eastern Europe. The vibrations of the strings and bridge are transmitted by a thin rod to the membrane of the gramophone-element. The membrane transforms these vibrations into sound waves, which are amplified by the horn or beaker. The horn-violin is harder to play than a normal violin because the reaction of the bow on the strings is less flexible, and the instrument's weight is less evenly distributed. This causes an imbalance on the shoulder. The instrument is still used in Romanian folk-music for playing horas and doinas, and mixes well with the characteristic sound of the pan- flute. It is generally used sparsely due to its tone. Instruments like the Stroh violin and other types of horn-violin remain a curiosity; they are quite rare in the orchestra. The horn-violin is especially used in folk music of the Bihor region of Romania. Famous practitioners of this music style include fiddler Gheorghe Rada, singers Florica Bradu, Florica Ungur, Florica Duma, Leontin Ciucur, Cornel Borza, Vasile Iova, Maria Haiduc, Viorica Flintașu, and renowned folk ensembles Crișana or Rapsozii Zarandului. image:Horn- violin_(also_called_trumpet-violin)_with_its_(normal)_violin_bow.jpgRomanian horn-violin and its bow image: @_Horn-violin_(Trumpet-violin)_Detail.jpgThe diaphragm of an old-fashioned gramophone serves as the receiver of the vibrations that are transformed into sound waves in the horn ==See also== * Fiddle * Hardanger fiddle * Kontra * Låtfiol * Rabeca ==References== ==External links== * Delta Violin—Article considering the context of Stroh and other related Horn Violins * YouTube Video—Louise played on the Stroh Fiddle (Violin) by Corwin Zekley * Video Siperkov plays the horn-violin * Historic Vitaphone Recording—Jazzmania Quintet, with Georgie Stoll on Stroh violin, playing \\"I Ain't Got Nobody\\" * The violinophone is one of the interesting Instruments of Amazonas * Antique Stroh violin Nr. 722 by Armin Sternberg, Budapest, approx. 1910 Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Romanian musical instruments Category:Violins ","title":"Stroh violin"},{"id":"1440122","text":" John Adam Treutlen, born Hans Adam Treuettlen (January 16, 1734 – March 1, 1782), arrived in Colonial America as an indentured servant and rose to become a wealthy merchant and landowner. He was a leader in Georgia during the American Revolution and helped write Georgia's first constitution. In 1777, he was elected Georgia's first (post-British) governor. He was one of Georgia's few governors to die by violence. Although much of his life has been surrounded by mystery and controversy, more details have emerged in recent years.Susan Exley. The life and times of John Adam Treutlen, Effingham Herald, August 30, 2012. ==Early life== Hans Adam Treuettlen was born to Hans Michel Treuettlen, a cooper, and Magdalena Clara, née Job, in the city of Kürnbach, now in Germany, then a condominium of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt and the Duchy of Württemberg. Treutlen's home was located in the part of the city that was ruled by Württemberg. His parents were married in 1731 after having two illegitimate children. He was the second child born after his parents married. It was Hans Michel's second marriage; his first marriage was to Maria Regina and they had seven children. Maria Regina died in 1727. The Treutlens were Protestants. In parts of the German-speaking lands, Protestants were persecuted by Catholic authorities, and many left for America seeking religious freedom. Clara, however, was a Catholic. Thus, the Treutlens were also very likely persecuted by the Protestant establishment for Clara's religion and also because the family had two children outside the marriage bond. That situation probably caused the 56-year-old Hans Michel to take, in late April 1744, his wife and four of their children on the arduous and dangerous voyage to seek a new life in America. The four children who went on this voyage were Friedrich, from Hans Michel's first marriage, Hans Philipp, one of the illegitimate children, and John Adam and Jonathan, the two youngest children.John Adam Treutlen: Recent Research Findings, Georgia Salzburger Society The Treutlens traveled first to Gosport on the southern coast of Britain. In November 1745, Clara and three of the children left Gosport for Georgia with a group of Lutheran Salzburgers who had been expelled from their Catholic-dominated homeland (see Salzburg#Religious conflict). The mother and children embarked on the ill-fated Judith. Hans Michel and one of the children, Hanß Philipp, remained in Britain. During the voyage across the Atlantic, there was an outbreak of typhus fever on the Judith. Thirteen individuals died, including the ship's captain. The first mate also became seriously ill. The Judith was in danger of not making the trip safely for death and illness left no one skilled at navigating a ship on the high seas. However, Rev. Bartholomäus Zuberbühler, who had no prior experience sailing, used his knowledge of geometry to figure out how to navigate the Judith safely to Georgia. Upon their arrival in Georgia, Clara and the three Treutlen children were indentured to Michael Burckhalter of Vernonburg. Pastor Johann Martin Boltzius of the Salzburgers in Ebenezer took notice of the extraordinary talents of John Treutlen and endeavored to remove him to Ebenezer in order to enroll him at the school there. However, Boltzius found it difficult to arrange for permission for Treutlen's attendance at the school because of Clara's history of abandoned husbands, illegitimate children, and Catholicism. Treutlen's \\"wicked and worldly parents\\" were also probably the reason that his true origins have remained hidden for so long. For 200 years, it was believed that he was born in Berchtesgaden, Austria. According to that story, the Treutlens, on their way to America, were attacked and the father captured and imprisoned by Spanish pirates. The father was supposed to have died in a Spanish prison in 1744. This story avoids many of the facts of Hans Michel's and Clara's lives together that people of the 18th century would find disagreeable. The story thus gained credence and then took on a life of its own over the next 200 years. However, marriage, birth, and other documents, which were recently discovered in Europe, have provided a more accurate picture of the Treutlens' European origins and their voyage to America. ==Early career== Overcoming the burden of his parents' past, Treutlen was enrolled in the school at Ebenezer. He did extremely well in his studies at Ebenezer and acquired a broad education in a wide variety of subjects in Latin, French, German, and English. He profited from growing up among the Salzburgers. As an adult, he was described as a man who possessed \\"an enlightened reason, Adam's natural intelligence and ability to give a name to every animal, knowledge of the laws of the land, and some discernment of practical religion.\\" In 1756, Treutlen married Marguerite Dupuis, an orphan who was also educated at Ebenezer. He soon began acquiring land and established for himself a large plantation and a successful merchant business. In 1768, he was appointed Justice of the Peace. He served as Commissioner and Surveyor of Roads, and several terms in the 1770s as Ebenezer's representative in the Georgia Commons House of Assembly. Treutlen assumed an active role in the religious life at Ebenezer. He was a teacher at the school there. He was a leader of the Rabenhorst faction in the sometimes-violent conflicts between the Ebenezer pastors, the Reverend Christoph Triebner and the Reverend Christian Rabenhorst. His association with Rev. Rabenhorst indicated Treutlen's religious sympathies. Ministers such as Rev. Rabenhorst and Rev. John Joachim Zubly of Savannah, found comfort in the writings of such German theologians as Rev. Johann Joachim Spalding. Those ministers accepted the many differences among the people in the colonies as a result of the different countries and cultures of those people. In their practical day-to-day activities of ministering to the diverse population, those ministers found it most effective to employ various strategies in the gracious work of conversion. Treutlen's religious views, formed by his association with Rev. Rabenhorst, undoubtedly helped him to develop his support for the democratic political institutions that seemed so agreeable with this diversity. In July 1775, Treutlen represented Ebenezer at the Provincial Congress. He took an active role in the revolution. He quickly became a leader, along with Button Gwinnett and George Wells, of the radical faction. In February 1777, Treutlen, Gwinnett, and Wells were on the committee that drafted Georgia's first constitution. As a result, the constitution included such democratic provisions as virtually-universal suffrage and annual elections of office holders. On May 8, 1777, the immensely-popular Treutlen was elected by a wide margin as Georgia's first governor under this new constitution. With the selection of Treutlen, Georgia chose a man who \\"possesses native intelligence\\" and could, under pressure, reply \\"coolly and laconically\\" to his political opponents and was thus well suited for the difficult task of leading the new state. ==Governorship== Treutlen monument in Ebenezer, Georgia. Bust of Treutlen at the Washington-Wilkes Historical Museum Treutlen's term as governor was marked by political conflicts between the radical and the conservative factions of the patriots. The conservatives opposed the democratic provisions of the new constitution that allowed many of those from the lower classes, with backgrounds like the former indentured servant Treutlen, to be elected to positions of power in the government. The radicals referred to the conservatives as Tories and, in some cases, treated them accordingly. The radicals and the conservatives clashed over the issues of civil control of the military, the conduct of the war and the conservatives' initiative to merge Georgia with South Carolina. The radicals were defeated in their attempts to remove the conservative General Lachlan McIntosh from his position of leadership in the continental army in Georgia when national leaders, such as George Washington, sided with McIntosh.Helene M.

Throughout the war, those political conflicts erupted into violent and tragic confrontations. In February 1777, the conservative Joseph Habersham killed the radical Lieutenant Nathaniel Hughes in a dispute at the opening of the convention that was called to write Georgia's first constitution. On May 16, 1777, the conservative General McIntosh mortally wounded the radical Gwinnett. On February 16, 1780, the conservative James Jackson killed the radical Wells. Treutlen and the radicals lost many of their battles with the conservatives. The Revolutionary War was particularly hard on the Salzburgers at Ebenezer. During the war, \\"when the English left, the Americans came, when the Americans went, the English came back,\\" but one thing remained the same: no matter who was there, the Salzburgers were plundered. Some were plundered as many as ten times during the years of war. ==Fall== On December 30, 1776, Rev. Rabenhorst died, leaving Ebenezer with no spiritual guidance. Thus, when John Houstoun was elected governor in January 1778, Treutlen dropped out of statewide politics and returned to Ebenezer to see what he could do to help the community and people that had provided him with so much during his three decades in America. At Savannah, he became a Freemason by joining the first Masonic Lodge established in Georgia, named Solomon's Lodge, No. 1., constituted in 1735 by the Grand Lodge of England, was founded in the Georgia Colony by the English Freemason James Oglethorpe on February 21, 1734. Treutlen's name is listed on the Lodge's Masonic membership roles in 1779 along with Archibald Bulloch, George Walton, General Samuel Elbert and many other Georgia leaders of the Revolution.Solomon's Lodge, No. 1, F.& A. M. Late in 1781, Treutlen re-entered statewide politics as Ebenezer's elected representative to the Georgia Assembly. He served in the January 1782 session. In 1782, the conservatives, whom Treutlen had opposed five years earlier, controlled the government of Georgia. Treutlen was one of the few radical democrats in the government that year. The imbalance in power between the radicals and the conservatives helped to create an atmosphere where the conservatives felt free to seek revenge for old scores and wounds. ==Murder== On a night in March 1782, by some accounts, five men rode up to the Treutlen home. They demanded for Treutlen to come outside, but he refused. The men then set fire to the home, forcing Treutlen, his wife and children to come outside. The men seized Treutlen and killed him in full view of his family. Other accounts of Treutlen's death are considerably different as to the details of the attack.Finck, William J. Lutheran landmarks and pioneers in America: a series of sketches of colonial times. Philadelphia: General Council Publication House, 1913. Some versions even place his death in South Carolina, not Georgia, and give a later date (late 1782 or early 1783), but there is no dispute that he died by some kind of mob violence. Historians continue to speculate about what person or group was behind the killing and what was the motive. Some contemporary accounts claimed Treutlen was killed by Tories angry about the American victory in the Revolutionary War. Others blamed the killing on South Carolinians who resented his opposition to merging Georgia into South Carolina during the war. There was also speculation at the time that the motive was a purely-personal grudge. The multiplicity of accounts and theories of his death indicates that there was never a consensus about the cause of the event. ==Legacy== Treutlen County is named after him. ==See also== * List of U.S. state governors born outside the United States ==References== ==Further reading== * Edward J.

The term was coined by computer writer Andy Ihnatko as a joke (a jibe at then outdated Macintosh 512K)Andy Ihnatko on Macs, Writing, Innovation, and the Macquarium but Macquariums have since been built both by Ihnatko himself and by others. Ihnatko originally designed his Macquarium to use the Compact Macintosh-style shell. In the early 1990s several Mac models in this form factor (the Macintosh 128K, Macintosh 512K and Macintosh Plus) were becoming obsolete, and Ihnatko considered that turning one into an aquarium might be \\"the final upgrade\\" — as well as an affordable way to have a color Compact Mac. He has mentioned in interviews that he had seen previous, over-complex attempts at Macintosh aquariums at trade shows that among other drawbacks suffered from noticeable water level lines across the \\"screen\\" that spoiled the illusion of a \\"really good screensaver\\", which drove him to design a version without a visible water line and which allowed the external case of the donor Mac to remain intact. Ihnatko's slant-front tank design, made of glass, had a nominal capacity of approximately 10 liters (2.2 UK gallons or 2.5 US gallons). Some subsequent designs have utilized acrylic glass or lexan. Because of its small capacity relative to most other aquariums, the Macquarium is considered a form of pico aquarium, which requires a higher level of diligence to maintain proper water chemistry and cleanliness. Some of the Macquariums built by others on an individual basis, the versions that Ihnatko refers to as \\"overly complex\\", were constructed with parts from two sources located closer to Apple headquarters a 1 Infinite Loop on De Anza Blvd in Cupertino, CA. Across the street from each other was the Tropical Fish Factory and a retail location for Tap Plastics, a supplier of scrap and custom acrylic plastic.Staff writer: A Macintosh Aquarium. The Cupertino Courier, SVCN, LLC., 1989. The Tropical Fish Factory was one of Northern California's largest aquarium products and live fish retailers. Both businesses are now gone, but their impact on Macquariums will remain. How these Macquariums differed is that the actual Macintosh shell was the aquarium where vent holes and the screen was sealed so that it could hold water. Macquariums are often stocked with 2-3 goldfish which do not require tank heaters and are cheap. But because goldfish grow large, have high oxygen requirements and are messy eaters they require much larger tanks for survival,The Golden Rules - Goldfish Guide Siamese fighting fish and small shrimp are better options. Other Mac models have similarly been made into aquariums such as the Macintosh TV, the Apple Lisa and the Power Mac G4 Cube.The Apple Collection - The Mac Aquariums Various iMac models have been used to make \\"iMacquariums\\". By 1995, a Macquarium based on a Macintosh LC 575 appeared in a Macintosh magazine titled \\"Macquarium '95\\".

The zoo has over 1,000 animals representing over 250 species. Attendance for 2013 was 224,000. Abilene zoo has been an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) since 1985. The zoo participates in the AZA Reciprocal Admissions Program, allowing members to obtain free or reduced admissions at many other American zoos. The zoo is primarily funded by the City of Abilene and the Abilene Zoological Society. ==History== Zoo's entrance black rhinos In 1985, the zoo first received accreditation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). In 2006, $1.1 million was raised through a bond issue for zoo improvements. This bond funded converting part of the Discovery Center into the Creepy Crawly Center, expansions to the giraffe exhibit and the parking lot, and creating a South American Trails exhibit, the Wetlands Boardwalk, and the Elm Creek Backyard exhibit. In 2007, one of the zoos elephants died at age 49 amidst some controversy over conditions for the elephants at the zoo, and the other was sent to the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco, Texas. The elephant exhibit was then turned into an exhibit for black rhinoceroses. The new $3.7 million Adventure Center (visitor services, administration, and education, all privately funded) and the new Creepy Crawler Center were also opened in 2007. In 2008, the zoo saw the opening of the maned wolf exhibit, which was initially home to a mother and son acquired from the Wild Canid Survival and Research Center in Eureka, Missouri. In June 2009, the zoo received an 8 year old white Bengal tiger named Havar from Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in Florida. The 325 pound male tiger went on display 2 June 2009. Also in 2009, the Elm Creek Backyard exhibit was completed with funds from the 2006 bond issue plus a $525,000 grant from the Grover Nelson Foundation. In 2013, a new Caribbean Cove section opened, featuring exotic birds, reptiles, and mammals from Caribbean countries. In March 2009, extension of the AZA accreditation for the zoo was tabled. In November, the majority of the issues had been addressed, including the lack of adequate veterinary and quarantine facilities. In March 2010, the zoo's accreditation was extended through 2014. In March 2014, the AZA once granted accreditation without any reservations. ==Exhibits== ===Giraffe Safari=== This exhibit includes a bridge crossing over it which allows visitors to pet and feed the giraffes. Construction began on a new $3.8 million Giraffe Safari exhibit, and opened in April 2016. The new exhibit doubled the size of the old habitat, and includes the zoo's new male giraffe and two females. ===Caribbean Cove=== This exhibit displays wildlife from South America, such as macaws, monkeys, and assorted amphibians. It also includes a large sand area for kids, while their parents take a break at the nearby tables and chairs. ===Reptile House=== The zoo's herpetarium, opened in December 2007 in what was part of the Discovery Center. The exhibit was designed and built by the zoo's management and staff, and contains 50 naturalistic exhibits with 80 species of reptiles and amphibians. The Tropical Aviary Also part of the Discovery center, the Tropical Aviary is a climate controlled indoor aviary that is home to the zoos tropical birds. The zoo also has Bird Gardens which house other birds in its possession. ===Elm Creek Backyard=== Completed in 2009, this area houses species native to the Elm Creek area of Texas, including cougars, coyotes, porcupines, raccoons, bobcats, ringtails, armadillos, skunks, and river otters, as well as a some birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. The Wetlands Boardwalk ===Wetlands of the Americas=== An elevated boardwalk that lets visitors get a close look at animals that inhabit the wetlands exhibits at the zoo. The various wetlands exhibits are home to a variety of wetland dwellers including alligators, flamingos, waterfowl, and Attwater's prairie chicken. ===Nakuru Lagoon=== This $300,000 project opened in March 2018. As soon as guests walk through the gate, they'll see this new exhibit, which houses African birds: lesser flamingos and yellow-billed ducks. ==Other facilities== The Adventure Center, which opened in 2007, is a complex that includes admissions, customer relations, and a gift shop, as well as administrative offices and classrooms that can hold up to 150 people. ==The future== The current master plan, developed by Wichita, Kansas-based WDM Architects for the zoo, includes an Africa project, to be built on of undeveloped zoo property to the North of the current zoo at an estimated cost of $20 million. Construction has begun on a new Giraffe Safari exhibit at the heart of the zoo. The new exhibit will include a large feeding deck to allow guests to interact with the animals. The larger space allowed for the acquisition of a bull giraffe in October 2014. He will be on exhibit with two females in spring 2016, when the new exhibit opens. ==NotesCategory:Zoos in Texas Category:Buildings and structures in Abilene, Texas Category:Tourist attractions in Taylor County, Texas Category:Zoos established in 1966 Category:1966 establishments in Texas ","title":"Abilene Zoological Gardens"},{"id":"1440155","text":"Seoul Metro Corporation (Hangul: 서울메트로) was a municipal-owned corporation owned by the Seoul Metropolitan Government.

Satellite facilities include the Offshore Safety and Survival Centre (OSSC) training centre in Foxtrap, the Safety and Emergency Response Training Centre (SERT) in Stephenville, harbour-side facilities at pier 25 in St. John's and Holyrood, and ships of up to in length. ==Academia== Marine is academically organized into three primary structures, the school of fisheries, the school of maritime studies, and the school of Ocean Technology ===School of Fisheries=== The school of fisheries focuses on the use, sustainability and management of aquatic resources and the marine environment; primarily, aquaculture, harvesting, food processing and safety. It encompasses the Centre for Sustainable Aquatic Resources (CSAR) and the Centre for Aquaculture and Seafood Development (CASD). ===School of Maritime Studies=== The school of maritime studies focuses on the marine transport industry and its related fields; primarily, ship operations and vessel design. It encompasses the Offshore Safety and Survival Centre (OSSC) and the Centre for Marine Simulation (CMS).Marine Programs at the Institute ===School of Ocean Technology=== The School of Ocean Technology was established in May 2007 with a $1 million investment from the government of Newfoundland and Labrador. The school will focus on technologies that enable safe, efficient, and effective activity in ocean industries. This includes ocean instrumentation and equipment, marine information and communication technologies, ocean mapping and underwater technology. The school will also provide education and training as well as industrial outreach for the Ocean Technology sector. ==Student life== ===Atmosphere=== Marine is a small school, with small class sizes and close instructor-student interaction. The Canadian Forces had a naval training detachment within the school up until 2015, so at one point it was common to see students in military uniform. ===MISU=== MISU is the Marine Institute Student Union, a Canadian Federation of Students associated student organization. Some of the provided services include extended health and dental insurance, tutor arrangements, and club ratifications. ===Marine Socials=== Every Friday evening, MISU hosts a well-attended social function in the Mariner's Lounge; with relatively affordable beverages and live entertainment. ==See also== * Memorial University of Newfoundland * Webb Institute * Higher education in Newfoundland and Labrador * Canadian university scientific research organizations ==References== ==External links== * Category:Universities and colleges in Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Memorial University of Newfoundland Category:Maritime colleges in Canada ","title":"Marine Institute of Memorial University of Newfoundland"},{"id":"1440171","text":"Statue of mayor Józef Dietl in Kraków by Xawery Dunikowski Xawery Dunikowski (; 24 December 1875 – 26 January 1964) was a Polish sculptor and artist, notable for surviving Auschwitz concentration camp, and best known for his Neo-Romantic sculptures and Auschwitz-inspired art. == Biography == Dunikowski was born in Kraków, a city he had an affinity for and would also use as the basis for a collection of art. When he was twelve his family moved to Warsaw, and after finishing his education in a technical school he studied sculpture under Boleslaw Syrewicz and Leon Wasilkowski. At twenty one, Dunikowski moved back to Kraków to study sculpture at the School of Fine Arts under Konstanty Laszczka, admirer of Auguste Rodin, and under Alfred Daun. He studied painting with Jan Stanisławski and after being enrolled for three years, he graduated with honors. Figuration/abstraction: stratégies for public sculpture in Europe, 1945-1968 by Charlotte Benton In 1902 Dunikowski began teaching sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, a professorship he would hold until 1909 when he was appointed the Chair of Sculpture Department at the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków. On January 18, 1905, amid a quarrel in a Warsaw restaurant, he shot and killed Wacław Pawliszczak, a fellow artist and popular Warsaw society figure. As a result, he was arrested and then released on a 2,000 rubles bail, while being charged with manslaughter (crime of passion). However, he was never really tried by the Tsarist justice apparatus, which at that time was busy with the Revolution of 1905, as well as other problems. Being an Austrian subject, he was subsequently allowed to return to Kraków, and never actually did any jail time or paid any retribution for his crime to the victim's family. Heading to Paris shortly before the beginning of World War I, Dunikowski remained in France from 1914-1920 (he served 5 years in the French Foreign Legion) until he returned to Kraków in 1921 to take the position of Head of Faculty of Sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts there. While working at the Academy, he educated many Polish sculptors including: Jerzy Bandura, Zygmunt Gawlik, Józef Gosławski, Maria Jarema, Ludwik Konarzewski (junior), Jacek Puget and Henryk Wiciński, and Polish-American woodcarver Adam Dabrowski. Dunikowski did not leave Kraków until 1940 when he was arrested by the Gestapo. == War years == Dunikowski was arrested by the Germans on 15 May 1940 and deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp on 26 June 1940. In Auschwitz, he was assigned the number 774. The detainment has interrupted his work on a series of sculptures entitled Heads from the Kraków Palace, based on busts found up on the ceilings of Renaissance castles. Auschwitz had demoralized the artist up to a point where he said that he had died there and refused all requests, mainly by Schutzstaffel (SS) guards, who urged him to make a model of the camp. Being already of an advanced age, in 1942 Dunikowski fell sick and readily was selected to be killed, until his name was crossed out by a fellow Pole of the list of prisoners doomed to be gassed. Narrowly escaping death, he once again nearly met his fate when in September 1943 he was accused of belonging to a resistance movement within the camp, and was therefore sentenced to be shot . However, due to further illness, he was sent back to the infirmary and had his sentence reduced . By 1944, still hospitalized, he began to draw portraits of fellow prisoners. Each drawing had to be smuggled out, and the ones that have made it were sent back to Kraków. Dunikowski had still not fully recovered by 27 January 1945, when the Soviet Red Army liberated Auschwitz, but by 1946 he has returned to his position at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków. He has also resumed his work on the Heads from the Kraków Palace series of sculptures. == Postwar period == Tomb of Xawery Dunikowski in Warsaw By the time he had returned to his normal life and recovered from his illness, Dunikowski was already seventy years old, and had started to create larger art to coincide with many of his Auschwitz-themed drawings and sculptures. His postwar interests started to drift toward architecture and tying it further to sculpture, as well as public monuments, most notably the Monument of the Liberation of the Region of Warmia and Mazury and the Revolutionary Effort, located in Olsztyn and at Góra Świętej Anny. Dunikowski had lived to see his works on display both in his hometown of Kraków, as well as exhibited in Warsaw, and at other venues, which by the early- to mid-1950s have included Moscow and Venice. In 1955, Dunikowski was the subject of a film documentary themed around his workshop, titled Idę do słońca (I am Going toward the Sun), but he took little interest in the film itself nor in its director, Andrzej Wajda. Featured in the documentary was another famous series of sculptures by Dunikowski titled Kobiety brzemienne (Pregnant Women). In the same year Dunikowski became the professor of the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw, thus leaving Kraków for good. He also held professorship at the State Higher School of Visual Arts in Wrocław. In 1964, at the age of eighty-eight, Xawery Dunikowski died, leaving behind a legacy of art including some of his more famous sculptures, Macierzyństwo (Motherhood, 1900), Skupienie (Concentration), Fatum (Fate, 1904), Dante, sculpture series including the Women of Nieborów and the Jesuits' Circle, along with many illustrations, portraits, and other works. Considered to be the best 20th century Polish sculptor, Dunikowski is buried in the Alley of the Meritorious in Powązki Military Cemetery, Warsaw; his tomb sculpture was created by a former pupil, Barbara Zbrożyna. == Museum == The former Warsaw palace of Królikarnia houses a museum dedicated to Dunikowski.

Formally, is a symmetric polynomial if for any permutation of the subscripts one has . Symmetric polynomials arise naturally in the study of the relation between the roots of a polynomial in one variable and its coefficients, since the coefficients can be given by polynomial expressions in the roots, and all roots play a similar role in this setting. From this point of view the elementary symmetric polynomials are the most fundamental symmetric polynomials. A theorem states that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials, which implies that every symmetric polynomial expression in the roots of a monic polynomial can alternatively be given as a polynomial expression in the coefficients of the polynomial. Symmetric polynomials also form an interesting structure by themselves, independently of any relation to the roots of a polynomial. In this context other collections of specific symmetric polynomials, such as complete homogeneous, power sum, and Schur polynomials play important roles alongside the elementary ones. The resulting structures, and in particular the ring of symmetric functions, are of great importance in combinatorics and in representation theory. ==Examples== The following polynomials in two variables X1 and X2 are symmetric: :X_1^3+ X_2^3-7 :4 X_1^2X_2^2 +X_1^3X_2 + X_1X_2^3 +(X_1+X_2)^4 as is the following polynomial in three variables X1, X2, X3: :X_1 X_2 X_3 - 2 X_1 X_2 - 2 X_1 X_3 - 2 X_2 X_3 \\\\, There are many ways to make specific symmetric polynomials in any number of variables (see the various types below). An example of a somewhat different flavor is :\\\\prod_{1\\\\leq i where first a polynomial is constructed that changes sign under every exchange of variables, and taking the square renders it completely symmetric (if the variables represent the roots of a monic polynomial, this polynomial gives its discriminant). On the other hand, the polynomial in two variables :X_1 - X_2 \\\\, is not symmetric, since if one exchanges X_1 and X_2 one gets a different polynomial, X_2 - X_1. Similarly in three variables :X_1^4X_2^2X_3 + X_1X_2^4X_3^2 + X_1^2X_2X_3^4 has only symmetry under cyclic permutations of the three variables, which is not sufficient to be a symmetric polynomial. However, the following is symmetric: :X_1^4X_2^2X_3 + X_1X_2^4X_3^2 + X_1^2X_2X_3^4 + X_1^4X_2X_3^2 + X_1X_2^2X_3^4 + X_1^2X_2^4X_3 == Applications == === Galois theory === One context in which symmetric polynomial functions occur is in the study of monic univariate polynomials of degree n having n roots in a given field. These n roots determine the polynomial, and when they are considered as independent variables, the coefficients of the polynomial are symmetric polynomial functions of the roots. Moreover the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials implies that a polynomial function f of the n roots can be expressed as (another) polynomial function of the coefficients of the polynomial determined by the roots if and only if f is given by a symmetric polynomial. This yields the approach to solving polynomial equations by inverting this map, \\"breaking\\" the symmetry – given the coefficients of the polynomial (the elementary symmetric polynomials in the roots), how can one recover the roots? This leads to studying solutions of polynomials using the permutation group of the roots, originally in the form of Lagrange resolvents, later developed in Galois theory. == Relation with the roots of a monic univariate polynomial == Consider a monic polynomial in t of degree n :P=t^n+a_{n-1}t^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+a_2t^2+a_1t+a_0 with coefficients ai in some field k. There exist n roots x1,…,xn of P in some possibly larger field (for instance if k is the field of real numbers, the roots will exist in the field of complex numbers); some of the roots might be equal, but the fact that one has all roots is expressed by the relation :P=t^n+a_{n-1}t^{n-1}+\\\\cdots+a_2t^2+a_1t+a_0=(t-x_1)(t-x_2)\\\\cdots(t-x_n). By comparison of the coefficients one finds that :\\\\begin{align} a_{n-1}&=-x_1-x_2-\\\\cdots-x_n\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{n-2}&=x_1x_2+x_1x_3+\\\\cdots+x_2x_3+\\\\cdots+x_{n-1}x_n = \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{1\\\\leq i These are in fact just instances of Viète's formulas. They show that all coefficients of the polynomial are given in terms of the roots by a symmetric polynomial expression: although for a given polynomial P there may be qualitative differences between the roots (like lying in the base field k or not, being simple or multiple roots), none of this affects the way the roots occur in these expressions. Now one may change the point of view, by taking the roots rather than the coefficients as basic parameters for describing P, and considering them as indeterminates rather than as constants in an appropriate field; the coefficients ai then become just the particular symmetric polynomials given by the above equations. Those polynomials, without the sign (-1)^{n-i}, are known as the elementary symmetric polynomials in x1,…,xn. A basic fact, known as the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials states that any symmetric polynomial in n variables can be given by a polynomial expression in terms of these elementary symmetric polynomials. It follows that any symmetric polynomial expression in the roots of a monic polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial in the coefficients of the polynomial, and in particular that its value lies in the base field k that contains those coefficients. Thus, when working only with such symmetric polynomial expressions in the roots, it is unnecessary to know anything particular about those roots, or to compute in any larger field than k in which those roots may lie. In fact the values of the roots themselves become rather irrelevant, and the necessary relations between coefficients and symmetric polynomial expressions can be found by computations in terms of symmetric polynomials only. An example of such relations are Newton's identities, which express the sum of any fixed power of the roots in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. == Special kinds of symmetric polynomials == There are a few types of symmetric polynomials in the variables X1, X2, …, Xn that are fundamental. === Elementary symmetric polynomials === For each nonnegative integer k, the elementary symmetric polynomial ek(X1, …, Xn) is the sum of all distinct products of k distinct variables. (Some authors denote it by σk instead.) For k = 0 there is only the empty product so e0(X1, …, Xn) = 1, while for k > n, no products at all can be formed, so ek(X1, X2, …, Xn) = 0 in these cases. The remaining n elementary symmetric polynomials are building blocks for all symmetric polynomials in these variables: as mentioned above, any symmetric polynomial in the variables considered can be obtained from these elementary symmetric polynomials using multiplications and additions only. In fact one has the following more detailed facts: *any symmetric polynomial P in X1, …, Xn can be written as a polynomial expression in the polynomials ek(X1, …, Xn) with 1 ≤ k ≤ n; *this expression is unique up to equivalence of polynomial expressions; *if P has integral coefficients, then the polynomial expression also has integral coefficients. For example, for n = 2, the relevant elementary symmetric polynomials are e1(X1, X2) = X1+X2, and e2(X1, X2) = X1X2. The first polynomial in the list of examples above can then be written as :X_1^3+X_2^3-7=e_1(X_1,X_2)^3-3e_2(X_1,X_2)e_1(X_1,X_2)-7 (for a proof that this is always possible see the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials). === Monomial symmetric polynomials === Powers and products of elementary symmetric polynomials work out to rather complicated expressions. If one seeks basic additive building blocks for symmetric polynomials, a more natural choice is to take those symmetric polynomials that contain only one type of monomial, with only those copies required to obtain symmetry. Any monomial in X1, …, Xn can be written as X1α1…Xnαn where the exponents αi are natural numbers (possibly zero); writing α = (α1,…,αn) this can be abbreviated to Xα. The monomial symmetric polynomial mα(X1, …, Xn) is defined as the sum of all monomials xβ where β ranges over all distinct permutations of (α1,…,αn). For instance one has :m_{(3,1,1)}(X_1,X_2,X_3)=X_1^3X_2X_3+X_1X_2^3X_3+X_1X_2X_3^3, :m_{(3,2,1)}(X_1,X_2,X_3)=X_1^3X_2^2X_3+X_1^3X_2X_3^2+X_1^2X_2^3X_3+X_1^2X_2X_3^3+X_1X_2^3X_3^2+X_1X_2^2X_3^3. Clearly mα = mβ when β is a permutation of α, so one usually considers only those mα for which α1 ≥ α2 ≥ … ≥ αn, in other words for which α is a partition of an integer. These monomial symmetric polynomials form a vector space basis: every symmetric polynomial P can be written as a linear combination of the monomial symmetric polynomials. To do this it suffices to separate the different types of monomial occurring in P. In particular if P has integer coefficients, then so will the linear combination. The elementary symmetric polynomials are particular cases of monomial symmetric polynomials: for 0 ≤ k ≤ n one has :e_k(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n)=m_\\\\alpha(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n) where α is the partition of k into k parts 1 (followed by n − k zeros). === Power-sum symmetric polynomials === For each integer k ≥ 1, the monomial symmetric polynomial m(k,0,…,0)(X1, …, Xn) is of special interest. It is the power sum symmetric polynomial, defined as :p_k(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n) = X_1^k + X_2^k + \\\\cdots + X_n^k . All symmetric polynomials can be obtained from the first n power sum symmetric polynomials by additions and multiplications, possibly involving rational coefficients. More precisely, :Any symmetric polynomial in X1, …, Xn can be expressed as a polynomial expression with rational coefficients in the power sum symmetric polynomials p1(X1, …, Xn), …, pn(X1, …, Xn). In particular, the remaining power sum polynomials pk(X1, …, Xn) for k > n can be so expressed in the first n power sum polynomials; for example :p_3(X_1,X_2)=\\\\textstyle\\\\frac32p_2(X_1,X_2)p_1(X_1,X_2)-\\\\frac12p_1(X_1,X_2)^3. In contrast to the situation for the elementary and complete homogeneous polynomials, a symmetric polynomial in n variables with integral coefficients need not be a polynomial function with integral coefficients of the power sum symmetric polynomials. For an example, for n = 2, the symmetric polynomial :m_{(2,1)}(X_1,X_2) = X_1^2 X_2 + X_1 X_2^2 has the expression : m_{(2,1)}(X_1,X_2)= \\\\textstyle\\\\frac12p_1(X_1,X_2)^3-\\\\frac12p_2(X_1,X_2)p_1(X_1,X_2). Using three variables one gets a different expression :\\\\begin{align}m_{(2,1)}(X_1,X_2,X_3) &= X_1^2 X_2 + X_1 X_2^2 + X_1^2 X_3 + X_1 X_3^2 + X_2^2 X_3 + X_2 X_3^2\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= p_1(X_1,X_2,X_3)p_2(X_1,X_2,X_3)-p_3(X_1,X_2,X_3). \\\\end{align} The corresponding expression was valid for two variables as well (it suffices to set X3 to zero), but since it involves p3, it could not be used to illustrate the statement for n = 2\\\\. The example shows that whether or not the expression for a given monomial symmetric polynomial in terms of the first n power sum polynomials involves rational coefficients may depend on n. But rational coefficients are always needed to express elementary symmetric polynomials (except the constant ones, and e1 which coincides with the first power sum) in terms of power sum polynomials. The Newton identities provide an explicit method to do this; it involves division by integers up to n, which explains the rational coefficients. Because of these divisions, the mentioned statement fails in general when coefficients are taken in a field of finite characteristic; however it is valid with coefficients in any ring containing the rational numbers. === Complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials === For each nonnegative integer k, the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial hk(X1, …, Xn) is the sum of all distinct monomials of degree k in the variables X1, …, Xn. For instance :h_3(X_1,X_2,X_3)=X_1^3+X_1^2X_2+X_1^2X_3+X_1X_2^2+X_1X_2X_3+X_1X_3^2+X_2^3+X_2^2X_3+X_2X_3^2+X_3^3. The polynomial hk(X1, …, Xn) is also the sum of all distinct monomial symmetric polynomials of degree k in X1, …, Xn, for instance for the given example :\\\\begin{align} h_3(X_1,X_2,X_3)&=m_{(3)}(X_1,X_2,X_3)+m_{(2,1)}(X_1,X_2,X_3)+m_{(1,1,1)}(X_1,X_2,X_3)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=(X_1^3+X_2^3+X_3^3)+(X_1^2X_2+X_1^2X_3+X_1X_2^2+X_1X_3^2+X_2^2X_3+X_2X_3^2)+(X_1X_2X_3).\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} All symmetric polynomials in these variables can be built up from complete homogeneous ones: any symmetric polynomial in X1, …, Xn can be obtained from the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials h1(X1, …, Xn), …, hn(X1, …, Xn) via multiplications and additions. More precisely: :Any symmetric polynomial P in X1, …, Xn can be written as a polynomial expression in the polynomials hk(X1, …, Xn) with 1 ≤ k ≤ n. :If P has integral coefficients, then the polynomial expression also has integral coefficients. For example, for n = 2, the relevant complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials are and . The first polynomial in the list of examples above can then be written as :X_1^3+ X_2^3-7=-2h_1(X_1,X_2)^3+3h_1(X_1,X_2)h_2(X_1,X_2)-7. As in the case of power sums, the given statement applies in particular to the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials beyond hn(X1, …, Xn), allowing them to be expressed in terms of the ones up to that point; again the resulting identities become invalid when the number of variables is increased. An important aspect of complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials is their relation to elementary symmetric polynomials, which can be expressed as the identities :\\\\sum_{i=0}^k(-1)^ie_i(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n)h_{k-i}(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n)=0, for all k > 0, and any number of variables n. Since e0(X1, …, Xn) and h0(X1, …, Xn) are both equal to 1, one can isolate either the first or the last term of these summations; the former gives a set of equations that allows one to recursively express the successive complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, and the latter gives a set of equations that allows doing the inverse. This implicitly shows that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of the hk(X1, …, Xn) with 1 ≤ k ≤ n: one first expresses the symmetric polynomial in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials, and then expresses those in terms of the mentioned complete homogeneous ones. === Schur polynomials === Another class of symmetric polynomials is that of the Schur polynomials, which are of fundamental importance in the applications of symmetric polynomials to representation theory. They are however not as easy to describe as the other kinds of special symmetric polynomials; see the main article for details. ==Symmetric polynomials in algebra== Symmetric polynomials are important to linear algebra, representation theory, and Galois theory. They are also important in combinatorics, where they are mostly studied through the ring of symmetric functions, which avoids having to carry around a fixed number of variables all the time. ==Alternating polynomials== Analogous to symmetric polynomials are alternating polynomials: polynomials that, rather than being invariant under permutation of the entries, change according to the sign of the permutation. These are all products of the Vandermonde polynomial and a symmetric polynomial, and form a quadratic extension of the ring of symmetric polynomials: the Vandermonde polynomial is a square root of the discriminant. ==See also== * Symmetric function * Newton's identities * Stanley symmetric function * Muirhead's inequality ==References== * * Macdonald, I.G.

Steeples are very common on Christian churches and cathedrals and the use of the term generally connotes a religious structure. They may be stand-alone structures, or incorporated into the entrance or center of the building. ==Architecture== Towers were not a part of Christian churches until about AD 600, when they were adapted from military watchtowers. At first they were fairly modest and entirely separate structures from churches. Over time, they were incorporated into the church building and capped with ever-more- elaborate roofs until the steeple resulted. Towers are a common element of religious architecture worldwide and are generally viewed as attempts to reach skyward toward heavens and the divine. Some wooden steeples are built with large wooden structural members arranged like tent poles and braced diagonally inside both with wood and steel. The steeple is then clad with wooden boards and finished with slate tiles nailed to the boards using copper over gaps on corners where the slate would not cover. ==Threats to steeples== Steeples can be vulnerable to earthquakes. A number of Romanian churches feature unusually slender steeples, and over half of these have been lost to earthquakes. Because of their height, steeples can also be vulnerable to lightning, which can start fires within steeples. An example of this is Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Luxemburg, Iowa, which lost its steeple in a fire believed to have been started by a lightning strike. ==See also== *Bell-gable *Bell tower *Minaret ==References== ==External links== Category:Church architecture Category:Timber framing eo:Spajro ","title":"Steeple"},{"id":"1440226","text":"Kerry Head Kerry Head is a headland located in County Kerry, Ireland that stretches into the Atlantic Ocean just north of Banna Strand.

These three bays surround the container port of Glebe Island which has been attached to the shoreline as part of the extensive reclamation of Rozelle Bay and White Bay which had begun in the 1890s.Land and Property Information NSW, Central Mapping Authority Sheets U0945-32, U0945-33, note 33 ==History== Rozelle Post Office, 1901 (National Archives of Australia) By 1877 the population of Balmain West had increased and the Balmain post office was inadequate for their needs as a growing suburb. Residents petitioned for a post office of their own and in 1880 Balmain West post office was established in Joseph Gosling's grocery shop at the junction of Weston Road (now Victoria Road) and Withecombe Street. Over the next 10 years the population of Balmain West grew further and in 1891 work started on a new post office on the corner of Weston Road and Darling Street. In December 1892, prior to the opening of the new post office, the Postmaster-General declared Rozelle (named after the nearby Rozelle Bay to the south east) as the new name for the Balmain West post office. The new Rozelle post office opened in 1894 and by the early 1900s, both the suburb itself and local residents had adopted the name. The name Rozelle and Rozelle Bay (often shown as \\"Rozella Bay\\" on old maps), originated from the parrots found in abundance at Rose Hill (near Parramatta) the first suburb of Sydney, established as a prime farming area for the new colony. The parrots, also in abundance in the inner west Bay area of Sydney, were commonly called \\"Rose Hill parrots\\" or \\"Rose-hillers\\" then Rosella.Book of Sydney Suburbs, Frances Pollon (Angus and Robertson) 1990, p.231 == Heritage listings == Rozelle has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Callan Park: Sewage Pumping Station 27 * Victoria Road: White Bay Power Station ==Landmarks== *A dominant structure on the landscape, the coal-fired White Bay Power Station supplied electricity to Sydney for 70 years during the 20th century and was last used in 1983. The station now lies derelict at the junction of Roberts and Victoria Road at White Bay. Next door stood the White Bay Hotel, which opened in 1916 but fell victim to lack of customers in 1992 and was destroyed by fire in 2008. *On the western side of the peninsula, the moderne-style Iron Cove Bridge, which opened in 1955, crosses the Parramatta River linking Rozelle with the suburb of Drummoyne. Alongside the bridge on the Rozelle side is the site of the Balmain Power Station, which was demolished in 1996 to make way for residential apartments. *On the eastern side stands the Anzac Bridge, completed in 1996, it is the main arterial link between the inner west and Sydney city. Below the bridge lies its predecessor, the Glebe Island Bridge, which opened in 1901. * Callan Park was an insane asylum between 1878 and 1914. Many of the original sandstone buildings survive to this day and the extensive parklands are open to the public. * St Paul's Presbyterian Church, Darling Street, was designed by E.J. Bowen and built in 1904. It is a brick building with stone trimmings and a slate roof. It is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/40 * Rozelle Public School, corner Darling Street and Victoria Road, was designed by John Horbury Hunt and built of sandstone in 1877.

The term can also refer to low-priority cargo used to fill out transport capacity which would otherwise ship underweight. In the context of shipping manufactured goods, dunnage refers to the packing material used as protective fill inside the carton, box or other type container used to prevent the merchandise from being damaged during shipment. These materials include bubble wrap; wadded, crumbled or shredded paper; styrofoam; inflated air packs; and other materials. ==International laws== When unloading a ship, sometimes there is a problem as to what to do with the dunnage. Sometimes the dunnage cannot be landed because of customs duties on imported timber, or quarantine rules to avoid foreign insect pests getting offshore, and as a result often the unwanted dunnage is later furtively jettisoned overside and adds to the area's driftwood problem. According to U.S. and International Law (MARPOL 73/78) it is illegal for ships to dump dunnage within of the shore. Currently, the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), an international regulatory agency, mandates its 134 signatory countries to comply with the ISPM 15, which requires all dunnage to be heat-treated or fumigated with pesticides and marked with an accredited seal. There are several instances in which foreign insects have entered by land and caused devastation to the ecosystem, even ruining crops. ==Construction== In construction, dunnage is often scrap wood or disposable manufactured material whose purpose is to be placed on the ground to raise construction materials to allow access for forklifts and slings for hoisting, and to protect them from the elements. Dunnage can also refer to a structural platform for mechanical equipment. Typically, these are open steel structures located on the roof of a building, consisting of steel beams supported on posts or bearing walls. They are used to raise equipment off the roof for various reasons, including maintenance access to both the roof surface and equipment itself, or to provide clearance to keep equipment out of any snow or rain that may collect on the roof. In this use, the dunnage is typically a permanent part of the building structure for the life of the equipment being supported. ==Dunnage bags== Stabilizing capabilities of dunnage bags in container Application of dunnage bags in container Dunnage bags are air-filled pouches that can be used to stabilize, secure and protect cargo during transportation. Dunnage bags are placed in the voids between the cargo items. Dunnage bags can be used in all modes of transportation; road, railway, ocean or air. Originally rubber bags were used to brace pallets inside trucks. They evolved into kraft paper bags with a plastic-bag interior. As metal strapping has become less popular, many companies now use polyethylene- or vinyl-based bags because of their low cost. It is important to match the size of the bag to the void. Starting in the 1950s, several US railroad freight carriers began rostering boxcars equipped with load-securing devices to prevent shifting during transit. These cars were usually labeled \\"Damage Free\\" or simply \\"DF\\". The interior equipment helped to eliminate the need for customer-supplied dunnage. In the 21st century, Amazon began air-filling dunnage bags on site during packing in order to minimize environmental impact, shipping weight, and cost of packing materials. == Ships == Dunnage for securing cargo in holds of ships has evolved from wooden boards forming \\"cribs\\" to modern mechanical, spring-loaded post-and-socket systems, exemplified by the \\"pogo sticks\\" used on US Navy Combat Logistics Force (CLF) ships which provide underway replenishment of stores, spares, repair parts, ammunition, ordnance, and liquids in cans and drums. Dunnage segregates cargo in the hold and prevents shifting of the cargo in response to ship motions. == Shipbuilding == During the shipbuilding process, dunnage is commonly used to describe items such as welding machines, hoses, ladders, and scaffolding which are not part of the ship and will not remain aboard after it is completed. == Miscellaneous uses of term == Outfitters and mule packers use the term dunnage when they transport freight, such as camping gear and food supplies, but do not carry passengers. In fishing net products \\"dunnage\\" may refer to a reinforcement of the edges of the net. It has historically been widely used in the United Kingdom for a sailor's personal belongings, as in, \\"Stow your dunnage and report to the First Mate\\". Many manufacturing facilities use the term dunnage to refer to the containers and packaging used for their finished goods. This can be anything from wood boxes or steel bins to wire baskets and plastic trays. Commonly this packaging is designed specifically to hold the product being manufactured and is proprietary to that manufacturing facilities requirements. On some vessels, it is used as a euphemism for human waste. ==See also== *Cushioning, package protection inside containers ==References== ==External links== *Dunnage Category:Material-handling equipment Category:Construction Category:Nautical terminology Category:Wood Category:Packaging materials ","title":"Dunnage"},{"id":"1440259","text":"Talking blues is a form of folk music and country music. It is characterized by rhythmic speech or near-speech where the melody is free, but the rhythm is strict. Christopher Allen Bouchillon, billed as \\"The Talking Comedian of the South,\\" is credited with creating the \\"talking blues\\" form with the song \\"Talking Blues,\\" recorded for Columbia Records in Atlanta in 1926, from which the style gets its name. The song was released in 1927, followed by a sequel, \\"New Talking Blues,\\" in 1928. His song \\"Born in Hard Luck\\" is similar in style. ==Form== A talking blues typically consists of a repetitive guitar line utilizing a three chord progression which, although it is called a \\"blues\\", is not actually a twelve bar blues. The vocals are sung in a rhythmic, flat tone, very near to a speaking voice, and take the form of rhyming couplets. At the end of each verse, consisting of two couplets, the singer continues to talk, adding a fifth line consisting of an irregular, generally unrhymed, and unspecified number of bars, often with a pause in the middle of the line, before resuming the strict chordal structure. This example, from \\"Talking Blues\\" by Woody Guthrie, a cover of \\"New Talking Blues\\" by Bouchillon, serves to explain the format: > Mama's in the kitchen fixin' the yeast > Papa's in the bedroom greasin' his feets > Sister's in the cellar squeezin' up the hops > Brother's at the window just a-watchin' for the cops > Drinkin' home brew ... makes you happy. The lyrics to a talking blues are characterized by dry, rural humor, with the spoken codetta often adding a wry commentary on the subject of the verse, like Bob Dylan's \\"Talkin' Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues\\". > Now, I don't care just what you do > If you wanta have a picnic, that's up t' you > But don't tell me about it, I don't wanta hear it > Cause, see, I just lost all m picnic spirit > Stay in m' kitchen, have m' own picnic. . . > In the bathroom. ==Development of the genre== Woody Guthrie and his song \\"Talking Hard Work\\" is a title-tribute to Bouchillon's \\"Talking Blues\\" and \\"Born in Hard Luck\\". The \\"Talking Blues\\" begins with the line: \\"Well, if you want to get to heaven,/ Let me tell you what to do,/ Got to grease your feet into little mutton stew.\\"/ Several sources of the 1940s - 1950s, including the Almanac Singers, wrongly credited Guthrie as the creator of the talking blues. By the 1940s, what had started as a comedic country music genre became a more pronounced form of wry political protest singing. This sample lyric, from \\"Talking Union\\" by Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, and Millard Lampell shows the development of the genre into a vehicle for political commentary: > Now, if you want higher wages, let me tell you what to do > You got to talk to the workers in the shop with you > You got to build you a union, got to make it strong > But if you all stick together, boys, it won't be long > You'll get shorter hours, better working conditions, vacations with pay ... > take your kids to the seashore. In 1958, the musician and folk music scholar John Greenway recorded an album collection called \\"Talking Blues\\" on the Folkways label. His compendium included 15 talking blues songs by Guthrie, Tom Glazer, and others, and was, according to the music historian Manfred Helfert, the \\"obvious source\\" for the many 1960s forays into the genre by Bob Dylan.\\"John Greenway - Obvious Source of Dylan's Talking Blues\\" by Manfred Helfert The best known of Dylan's talking blues is \\"Talking World War III Blues\\" from 1963: > Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell > And I leaned my head and I gave a yell > \\"Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man!\\" > A shotgun fired and away I ran > I don't blame them too much, though ... he didn't know me > Dylan's fame and his repeated use of the talking blues form contributed to the genre becoming a widely popular vehicle for the composition of songs with political content. When the country singer Johnny Cash recorded a song that described his trip to Vietnam with his wife June Carter Cash, he chose the talking blues format to describe his dissent against the Vietnam War. Talking blues is also popular as a medium for parody, as in \\"Like a Lamb to the Slaughter\\", Frank Hayes's talking-blues parody of Matty Groves: > One high, one holy holiday, on the first day of the year, > Little Matty Groves to church did go, some holy words to hear > When in come old Lord Arnold's wife, she looked at him and said, > \\"Come here often? What's your sign?\\" And off they went to bed. > In the interests of brevity, we'll omit some of the more repetitive parts > of the song. > Like the part where they get undressed. > All forty-seven verses of it. ==Notable examples== * \\"Talking Blues\\" (1926) and \\"New Talking Blues\\" (1928) by Christopher Allen Bouchillon * \\"Talking Dust Bowl Blues\\" (1940), \\"Talking Fishing Blues\\", \\"Talking Centralia\\", \\"Talking Columbia\\", \\"Talking Hard Work\\", \\"Talking Sailor\\", and \\"Talking Subway\\" by Woody Guthrie. * \\"Talking Union,\\" by Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, and Millard Lampell. * \\"Atomic Talking Blues\\" (a.k.a. \\"Talking Atom\\", \\"Old Man Atom\\") by Vern Partlow * \\"Talking Inflation Blues\\" by Tom Glazer * \\"Talking World War III Blues\\" (1963), \\"Talking New York\\", \\"Talking Hava Negiliah Blues\\", \\"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\\", \\"I Shall Be Free No. 10\\", and \\"Talkin' Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues\\" by Bob Dylan, all recorded during the 1960s * \\"Alice's Restaurant\\" (1967) by Arlo Guthrie * \\"Talkin' Candy Bar Blues\\" by Peter, Paul & Mary on A Song Will Rise (1965) * \\"Singing in Viet Nam Talking Blues\\" by Johnny Cash * \\"Talking Birmingham Jam\\" (1963), \\"Talking Airplane Disaster\\" (1963), \\"Talking Cuban Crisis\\" (1963), \\"Talking Vietnam (1964) by Phil Ochs *\\"Talking Thunderbird Blues\\" (1973), \\"Fraternity Blues\\" (1977) by Townes Van Zandt * “Talking New Bob Dylan” by Loudon Wainwright III on his album History (1992). ==See also== *Sprechgesang *Talking Timbuktu *Spoken word *Rapping *Hip hop music *Recitation song ==References== ===Further reading=== *van der Merwe, Peter (1989).

Gary (1903–1977). Gary was laid down on 18 December 1982 at Todd Pacific Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California; launched on 19 November 1983, co-sponsored by Mrs. Dorothy G. Gary, widow of the late Cmdr. Gary, and Mrs. Joyce Leamer, the late Medal of Honor recipient's niece; and commissioned on 17 November 1984 at Naval Station Long Beach, Commander Harlan R. Bankert Jr. in command. The Gary was decommissioned from the US Navy on 5 August 2015 with the Taiwanese crew taking possession on 13 March 2017, and arrived at the ROCN Zyoying Naval Base on 13 May. She was formally commissioned into ROCN as the ROCS Feng Jia (PFG-1115) on 8 November 2018. == Background == Gary is the forty-fifth ship of the of guided missile frigates. These ships were built to provide air, surface and sub-surface protection for underway replenishment groups, convoys, amphibious groups and other military and merchant shipping. While a capable surface combatant in these traditional warfare areas, Garys role has expanded from that of the early 1980s to meet the threats and contingencies of the 21st century. Being the smallest multi-mission surface combatant in the U.S. Navy, Garys shallow draft gives her an advantage over larger cruisers and destroyers in the littoral operations that have characterized recent conflicts. Garys engineering plant is computer-controlled and monitored, reducing the number of watchstanders required in the engineering spaces themselves. Two marine gas turbine engines provide propulsion. Digital electronic logic circuits and remotely operated valves are monitored in a central control station and make Gary capable of getting ready to get underway in less than ten minutes rather than the eight hours required by steam-powered ships. One of the U.S. Navy's premiere anti-submarine warfare platforms, Gary routinely deploys for bilateral anti-submarine exercises and real-world contingency operations in the western Pacific and Indian Oceans. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, she displayed her versatility, deploying to the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Gulf of Aden and Red Sea, conducting carrier escort and air defense, intelligence gathering and presence missions, terrorist interdiction operations, rescue at sea and escorted dozens of merchant and military supply ships through the Strait of Hormuz and Bab-el-Mandeb strait. From 1999 to 2007, Gary was forward-deployed to Yokosuka, Japan, as part of the United States Seventh Fleet. During 2007, Gary completed a hull-swap/crew-swap with and to be home- ported at Naval Station, San Diego. == Notable history == Gary in 2002, before removal of her missile launcher. An Iranian mine damaged guided missile frigate in the Persian Gulf on 14 April 1988. On 18 April the U.S. launched retaliatory Operation Praying Mantis against the Iranian-occupied Rakhsh, Salman (Sassan), and Sīrrī-D (Nassr) oil platforms. As the Task Unit Commander of joint forces in the Northern Persian Gulf, Gary coordinated her efforts with naval, Air Force and Army aircraft as well as special operations boat units while protecting Mobile Sea Bases Hercules and Wimbrown VII during the fighting. She even claimed to have shot down a Silkworm missile, but this was never officially credited nor was she officially commended for her actions due to political reasons at that time.\\"America's First Clash with Iran: The Tanker War\\" by Lee Allen Zatarain, Chapter 17: \\"Multiple Silkworms Inbound\\" While aircraft carrier , guided missile destroyer , and Gary, with an embarked an SH-60B Seahawk of Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron (Light) (HSL) 51 Detachment 5, passed through the Strait of Malacca, en route to the Indian Ocean, on 7 October 2001, they rescued five Indonesian fishermen from their sinking 40-foot fishing vessel. On 13 March 2003, Gary, with an SH-60B of HSL-51 embarked, assisted in the rescue of all eight Iraqi fishermen from dhow Kaptain Muhamadat when she lost steerage and propulsion in heavy seas and capsized 20 miles south of the Iranian coast. On 9 February 2007 Gary docked at the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville. It is the first time since the Vietnam War that an American warship has docked in Cambodia. In the summers of 2012 and 2014, Gary took part in the largest Rim of the Pacific multi-national naval exercise including 23 nations and over 40 ships. While Gary, with a Coast Guard law enforcement detachment team embarked, deployed for Operation Martillo (Spanish for \\"Hammer\\"), a counter-narcotics patrol, in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, she intercepted a suspicious vessel on 4 January 2013. The Coast Guardsmen and Sailors from the ship's \\"visit, board, search, and seizure\\" (VBSS) team boarded the suspected smuggler and seized of cocaine with an estimated street value of $22 million. \\"This was one of those vessels we were chasing in the dark,\\" Leatrice Daniels, Garys embarked Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) agent explained, \\"There was great open communication with everybody involved. Everything just flowed, from pursuit to initial contact and boarding.\\" The investigators deemed the smuggler a hazard to navigation and sank her. This case concluded a hectic week in which Garys crewmembers and Coast Guardsmen boarded three boats, disrupting more than of cocaine destined for the United States with a street value of $272 million. On the night of 8 January 2013, Gary encountered a small vessel loaded with cargo. The boat displayed several indicators that she was involved in illicit trafficking, and the VBSS team and the Coast Guardsmen boarded the vessel. While they searched the boat, she suffered a temporary steering casualty, rendering her dangerous to operate. Gary rigged a tow until the Americans and the mariners restored the boat's steering. The intervening time enabled the boarders to complete their search and they failed to discover any narcotics on board, and the vessel resumed her voyage two days later. The ship capped her deployment by seizing an additional vessel smuggling more than of cocaine valued at $81 million. \\"It was a complex operation,\\" Lt. (j.g.) Christian Gotcher, the ship's navigation officer, recalled, \\"involving a law enforcement boarding, boat and helicopter searches, precision driving, detainee handling, and multiple deck operations, but Garys crew proved they were fully capable of handling it and scored a big win.\\" Gary was decommissioned on 23 July 2015 at Naval Base San Diego, California. The ship was inactivated on 5 August 2015 and then prepared for transfer to Taiwan. The Republic of China Navy inaugurated the ship as the ROCS Feng Jia (PFG-1115) on 8 November 2018. == References == == External links == * *Yokosuka Naval Base Community Website * * navysite.de: USS Gary *MaritimeQuest USS Gary FFG-51 pages *Eye on the Fleet Photo Gallery *USS Gary News *USS Gary command histories at the Naval History & Heritage Command Uss gary-m.jpgUSS Gary (FFG-51) USS Gary VBSS Team - Pearl Harbor Hawaii - 2006.jpgGary's VBSS Team training at Naval Station Pearl Harbor.

Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a phenomenon in which a force is exerted on a dielectric particle when it is subjected to a non-uniform electric field. This force does not require the particle to be charged. All particles exhibit dielectrophoretic activity in the presence of electric fields. However, the strength of the force depends strongly on the medium and particles electrical properties, on the particles shape and size, as well as on the frequency of the electric field. Consequently, fields of a particular frequency can manipulate particles with great selectivity. This has allowed, for example, the separation of cells or the orientation and manipulation of nanoparticles and nanowires. Furthermore, a study of the change in DEP force as a function of frequency can allow the electrical (or electrophysiological in the case of cells) properties of the particle to be elucidated. ==Background and properties== Although the phenomenon we now call dielectrophoresis was described in passing as far back as the early 20th century, it was only subject to serious study, named and first understood by Herbert Pohl in the 1950s. Recently, dielectrophoresis has been revived due to its potential in the manipulation of microparticles, nanoparticles and cells. Dielectrophoresis occurs when a polarizable particle is suspended in a non-uniform electric field. The electric field polarizes the particle, and the poles then experience a force along the field lines, which can be either attractive or repulsive according to the orientation on the dipole. Since the field is non- uniform, the pole experiencing the greatest electric field will dominate over the other, and the particle will move. The orientation of the dipole is dependent on the relative polarizability of the particle and medium, in accordance with Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars polarization. Since the direction of the force is dependent on field gradient rather than field direction, DEP will occur in AC as well as DC electric fields; polarization (and hence the direction of the force) will depend on the relative polarizabilities of particle and medium. If the particle moves in the direction of increasing electric field, the behavior is referred to as positive DEP (sometime pDEP), if acting to move the particle away from high field regions, it is known as negative DEP (or nDEP). As the relative polarizabilities of the particle and medium are frequency-dependent, varying the energizing signal and measuring the way in which the force changes can be used to determine the electrical properties of particles; this also allows the elimination of electrophoretic motion of particles due to inherent particle charge. Phenomena associated with dielectrophoresis are electrorotation and traveling wave dielectrophoresis (TWDEP). These require complex signal generation equipment in order to create the required rotating or traveling electric fields, and as a result of this complexity have found less favor among researchers than conventional dielectrophoresis. ==Dielectrophoretic force== The simplest theoretical model is that of a homogeneous sphere surrounded by a conducting dielectric medium. For a homogeneous sphere of radius r and complex permittivity \\\\varepsilon_p^* in a medium with complex permittivity \\\\varepsilon_m^* the (time-averaged) DEP force is: :\\\\langle F_\\\\mathrm{DEP} \\\\rangle = 2\\\\pi r^3\\\\varepsilon_m \\\\textrm{Re}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon^*_p - \\\\varepsilon^*_m}{\\\\varepsilon^*_p + 2\\\\varepsilon^*_m}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} abla \\\\left\\\\vec{E}_{rms}\\\\right^2 The factor in curly brackets is known as the complex Clausius-Mossotti function and contains all the frequency dependence of the DEP force. Where the particle consists of nested spheres - the most common example of which is the approximation of a spherical cell composed of an inner part (the cytoplasm) surrounded by an outer layer (the cell membrane) - then this can be represented by nested expressions for the shells and the way in which they interact, allowing the properties to be elucidated where there are sufficient parameters related to the number of unknowns being sought. For a more general field-aligned ellipsoid of radius r and length l with complex dielectric constant \\\\varepsilon_p^* in a medium with complex dielectric constant \\\\varepsilon_m^* the time-dependent dielectrophoretic force is given by: :F_\\\\mathrm{DEP} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi r^2 l}{3}\\\\varepsilon_m \\\\textrm{Re}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon^*_p - \\\\varepsilon^*_m}{\\\\varepsilon^*_m}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} abla \\\\left\\\\vec{E}\\\\right^2 The complex dielectric constant is \\\\varepsilon^* = \\\\varepsilon + \\\\frac{i\\\\sigma}{\\\\omega}, where \\\\varepsilon is the dielectric constant, \\\\sigma is the electrical conductivity, \\\\omega is the field frequency, and i is the imaginary unit. This expression has been useful for approximating the dielectrophoretic behavior of particles such as red blood cells (as oblate spheroids) or long thin tubes (as prolate ellipsoids) allowing the approximation of the dielectrophoretic response of carbon nanotubes or tobacco mosaic viruses in suspension. These equations are accurate for particles when the electric field gradients are not very large (e.g., close to electrode edges) or when the particle is not moving along an axis in which the field gradient is zero (such as at the center of an axisymmetric electrode array), as the equations only take into account the dipole formed and not higher order polarization. When the electric field gradients are large, or when there is a field null running through the center of the particle, higher order terms become relevant, and result in higher forces. To be precise, the time- dependent equation only applies to lossless particles, because loss creates a lag between the field and the induced dipole. When averaged, the effect cancels out and the equation holds true for lossy particles as well. An equivalent time-averaged equation can be easily obtained by replacing E with Erms, or, for sinusoidal voltages by dividing the right hand side by 2. These models ignores the fact that cells have a complex internal structure and are heterogeneous. A multi-shell model in a low conducting medium can be used to obtain information of the membrane conductivity and the permittivity of the cytoplasm. For a cell with a shell surrounding a homogeneous core with its surrounding medium considered as a layer, as seen in Figure 2, the overall dielectric response is obtained from a combination of the properties of the shell and core. : \\\\varepsilon_{1eff}^*(\\\\omega)= \\\\varepsilon_2^*\\\\frac{(\\\\frac{r_2}{r_1})^3+2\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_1^*-\\\\varepsilon_2^*}{\\\\varepsilon_1^*+2\\\\varepsilon_2^*}}{(\\\\frac{r_2}{r_1})^3-\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_1^*-\\\\varepsilon_2^*}{\\\\varepsilon_1^*+2\\\\varepsilon_2^*}} where 1 is the core (in cellular terms, the cytoplasm), 2 is the shell (in a cell, the membrane). r1 is the radius from the centre of the sphere to the inside of the shell, and r2 is the radius from the centre of the sphere to the outside of the shell. ==Applications of dielectrophoresis== Dielectrophoresis can be used to manipulate, transport, separate and sort different types of particles. Since biological cells have dielectric properties,Pethig R. Dielectric Properties of Biological Materials, 1979. dielectrophoresis has many medical applications. Instruments that separate cancer cells from healthy cells have been made. Platelets have been separated from whole blood with a DEP-activated cell sorter. Dielectrophoresis can be used to manipulate, transport, separate and sort different types of particles. DEP is being applied in fields such as medical diagnostics, drug discovery, cell therapeutics, and particle filtration. DEP has been also used in conjunction with the semiconductor chip technology for the development of DEPArray technology (Menarini Silicon Biosystems) for the simultaneous management of thousands of cells in a microfluidic device. Single microelectrodes on the floor of a flow cell are managed by the CMOS chip to form thousands of “Dielectrophoretic Cages”, each capable of capturing and moving one single cell under control of a routing software. The most effort in studying DEP has been directed towards satisfying the unmet needs in the biomedical sciences. As biological cells have dielectric properties dielectrophoresis has many medical applications. Instruments capable of separating cancer cells from healthy cells have been made Polzer et al, EMBO 2014, Molecular profiling of single Circulating Tumor cells with diagnostic intention Polzer Et all EMBO 2014 DOI 10.15252/emmm.201404033Mesquita et al, Nature 2016, “Molecular analysis of circulating tumor cells identifies distinct copy-number profiles in patients with chemosensitive and chemorefractory small-cell lung cancer”, https://doi.org/10.1038/nm.4239Bolognesi et al, Scientific Reports, 2017, “Digital Sorting of Pure Cell Populations Enables Unambiguous Genetic Analysis of Heterogeneous Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Tumors by Next Generation Sequencing, https://doi.org/10.1038/srep20944 as well as isolating single cells from Forensic mixed samples. Fontana et al, FSI 2017, “Isolation and genetic analysis of pure cells from forensic biological mixtures: The precision of a digital approach”, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsigen.2017.04.023 DEP has made it possible to characterize and manipulate biological particles like blood cells, stem cells, neurons, pancreatic β cells, DNA, chromosomes, proteins and viruses. DEP can be used to separate particles with different sign polarizabilities as they move in different directions at a given frequency of the AC field applied. DEP has been applied for the separation of live and dead cells, with the remaining live cells still viable after separation or to force contact between selected single cells to study cell- cell interaction.Tellez Gabriel , EJCB, 2017, “Analysis of gap junctional intercellular communications using a dielectrophoresis-based microchip”, DOI.org/10.1016/j.ejcb.2017.01.003 *Strains of bacteria and virusesBurt, J.P.H., R. Pethig, and M.S. Talary, Microelectrode devices for manipulating and analysing bioparticles. Transactions of the Institute of Measurement and Control, 1998. 20(2): p. 82-90 red and white blood and cells. DEP can also be used to detect apoptosis soon after drug induction measuring the changes in electrophysiological properties.Chin, S., et al., Rapid assessment of early biophysical changes in K562 cells during apoptosis determined using dielectrophoresis. International Journal of Nanomedicine, 2006. 1(3): p. 333-337 ===DEP as a cell characterisation tool=== DEP is mainly used for characterising cells measuring the changes in their electrical properties. To do this, many techniques are available to quantify the dielectrophoretic response, as it is not possible to directly measure the DEP force. These techniques rely on indirect measures, obtaining a proportional response of the strength and direction of the force that needs to be scaled to the model spectrum. So most models only consider the Clausius-Mossotti factor of a particle. The most used techniques are collection rate measurements: this is the simplest and most used technique – electrodes are submerged in a suspension with a known concentration of particles and the particles that collect at the electrode are counted;Labeed, F.H., Coley, H.M., Hughes, M.P. (2006), Biochim Biophys Acta 1760, 922-929 crossover measurements: the crossover frequency between positive and negative DEP is measured to characterise particles – this technique is used for smaller particles (e.g. viruses), that are difficult to count with the previous technique;Hughes, M.P., Morgan, H., Rixon, F.J., Burt, J.P.H., Pethig, R. (1998), Biochim Biophys Acta 1425, 119-126 particle velocity measurements: this technique measures the velocity and direction of the particles in an electric field gradient;Watarai, H., Sakomoto, T., Tsukahara, S. (1997) Langmuir 13, 2417-2420 measurement of the levitation height: the levitation height of a particle is proportional to the negative DEP force that is applied. Thus, this technique is good for characterising single particles and is mainly used for larger particles such as cells;Kaler, K.V., Jones, T.B. (1990) Biophysical Journal 57, 173-182 impedance sensing: particles collecting at the electrode edge have an influence on the impedance of the electrodes – this change can be monitored to quantify DEP.Allsop, D.W.E., Milner, K.R., Brown, A.P., Betts, W.B. (1999) Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics 32, 1066-1074 In order to study larger populations of cells, the properties can be obtained by analysing the dielectrophoretic spectra. ==Implementing dielectrophoresis== ===Electrode geometries=== At the start, electrodes were made mainly from wires or metal sheets. Nowadays, the electric field in DEP is created by means of electrodes which minimize the magnitude of the voltage needed. This has been possible using fabrication techniques such as photolithography, laser ablation and electron beam patterning. These small electrodes allow the handling of small bioparticles. The most used electrode geometries are isometric, polynomial, interdigitated, and crossbar. Isometric geometry is effective for particle manipulation with DEP but repelled particles do not collect in well defined areas and so separation into two homogeneous groups is difficult. Polynomial is a new geometry producing well defined differences in regions of high and low forces and so particles could be collected by positive and negative DEP. This electrode geometry showed that the electrical field was highest at the middle of the inter-electrode gaps. Interdigitated geometry comprises alternating electrode fingers of opposing polarities and is mainly used for dielectrophoretic trapping and analysis. Crossbar geometry is potentially useful for networks of interconnects.A. D. Wissner-Gross, \\"Dielectrophoretic architectures\\", Bio-Inspired and Nanoscale Integrated Computing 155-173 (ed. M. Eshaghian-Wilner, Wiley, 2009). ===DEP-well electrodes=== These electrodes were developed to offer a high-throughput yet low-cost alternative to conventional electrode structures for DEP. Rather than use photolithographic methods or other microengineering approaches, DEP-well electrodes are constructed from stacking successive conductive and insulating layers in a laminate, after which multiple \\"wells\\" are drilled through the structure. If one examines the walls of these wells, the layers appear as interdigitated electrodes running continuously around the walls of the tube. When alternating conducting layers are connected to the two phases of an AC signal, a field gradient formed along the walls moves cells by DEP. DEP-wells can be used in two modes; for analysis or separation. In the first, the dielectrophoretic properties of cells can be monitored by light absorption measurements: positive DEP attracts the cells to the wall of the well, thus when probed with a light beam the well the light intensity increases through the well. The opposite is true for negative DEP, in which the light beam becomes obscured by the cells. Alternatively, the approach can be used to build a separator, where mixtures of cells are forced through large numbers (>100) of wells in parallel; those experiencing positive DEP are trapped in the device whilst the rest are flushed. Switching off the field allows release of the trapped cells into a separate container. The highly parallel nature of the approach means that the chip can sort cells at much higher speeds, comparable to those used by MACS and FACS. This approach offers many advantages over conventional, photolithography-based devices but reducing cost, increasing the amount of sample which can be analysed simultaneously, and the simplicity of cell motion reduced to one dimension (where cells can only move radially towards or away from the centre of the well). Devices manufactured to use the DEP-well principle are marketed under the DEPtech brand. ===Dielectrophoresis field- flow fractionation === The utilization of the difference between dielectrophoretic forces exerted on different particles in nonuniform electric fields is known as DEP separation. The exploitation of DEP forces has been classified into two groups: DEP migration and DEP retention. DEP migration uses DEP forces that exert opposite signs of force on different particle types to attract some of the particles and repel others. DEP retention uses the balance between DEP and fluid-flow forces. Particles experiencing repulsive and weak attractive DEP forces are eluted by fluid flow, whereas particles experiencing strong attractive DEP forces are trapped at electrode edges against flow drag. Dielectrophoresis field-flow fractionation (DEP-FFF), introduced by Davis and Giddings, is a family of chromatographic-like separation methods. In DEP-FFF, DEP forces are combined with drag flow to fractionate a sample of different types of particles. Particles are injected into a carrier flow that passes through the separation chamber, with an external separating force (a DEP force) being applied perpendicular to the flow. By means of different factors, such as diffusion and steric, hydrodynamic, dielectric and other effects, or a combination thereof, particles (<1 μm in diameter) with different dielectric or diffusive properties attain different positions away from the chamber wall, which, in turn, exhibit different characteristic concentration profile. Particles that move further away from the wall reach higher positions in the parabolic velocity profile of the liquid flowing through the chamber and will be eluted from the chamber at a faster rate. ===Optical dielectrophoresis=== The use of photoconductive materials (for example, in lab-on-chip devices) allows for localized inducement of dielectrophoretic forces through the application of light. In addition, one can project an image to induce forces in a patterned illumination area, allowing for some complex manipulations. When manipulating living cells, optical dielectrophoresis provides a non-damaging alternative to optical tweezers, as the intensity of light is about 1000 times less.Dongqing Li, ed. \\"Encyclopedia of Microfluidics and Nanofluidics\\".

Ijolite is a rare rock type of considerable importance from a mineralogical and petrological standpoint. The word is derived from the first syllable of the Finnish words such as Iivaara, Iijoki, common as geographical names in Finland, and the Ancient Greek Xiflos, a stone. Ijolite occurs in various parts of the Kainuu region of eastern Finland and in the Kola Peninsula of northwest Russia on the shores of the White Sea. Ijolite was first defined and named by Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay. The pyroxene is , yellow or green, and is surrounded by formless areas of nepheline. The accessory minerals are apatite, cancrinite, calcite, titanite and iivaarite, a dark-brown titaniferous variety of melanite-garnet. This rock is the plutonic and holo- crystalline analogue of the nephelinites -volcanic equivalent and nepheline- dolerites; it bears the same relation to them as the nepheline syenites have to the phonolites. A leucite-augite rock, resembling ijolite except in containing leucite in place of nepheline, is known to occur at Shonkin Creek, near Fort Benton, Montana, and has been called missourite, but is now regarded as a variety of leucitite. ==References== * Category:Plutonic rocks ","title":"Ijolite"},{"id":"1440339","text":"Funday PawPet Show is an Internet-based puppet show created by Randy \\"Yappy\\" Fox in November 1999, broadcast on Sunday nights from 18:00 to 22:00 ET from his home in Kissimmee, Florida. Before November 25, 2007 the show aired from 19:00 to 23:00 EST, but this was changed due to an increasing international audience, and until September 20, 2015, was broadcast from 18:00 to 22:00 EST. The show is also performed live at the Megaplex furry convention, held in Kissimmee, Florida, as well as at Anthrocon, held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Funday PawPet Show has sparked a few imitations, such as Fluff & Such Productions, PawPets West, and PawPet North Coast. Other puppetry events, such as Lionel Scritchie's Dormitory at Eurofurence were partially inspired by the Funday PawPet Show. On September 12, 2017, it was announced on the show's official main page that the show's original run had come to an end and would no longer be airing with new episodes, after almost 18 years of broadcasting and a total run of 756 episodes. The reasons cited were the end of Furstre.am and increasing audio license issues due to the music industry making it too difficult to legally use songs in their show. Video copyright complications also played a role. It was also decided that ending abruptly would be easier for the cast than doing an emotional last show, thus giving it an unexpected end. On September 2, 2018, the Funday Pawpet Twitter account officially announced the show would be revived with new episodes once again on Sunday September 9, 2018 through different platforms by means of streaming. This was after rumors were confirmed about the series' making a comeback as the series resulted in a year hiatus. Unlike the show's original run however, the revival will not have new episodes on a weekly basis, so it will now run on a semi- weekly or monthly basis. On top of that, licensed content such as copyrighted music will no longer be used in the show due to royalty issues, so they must use entirely fan-created pieces or public domain music. Copyrighted videos will no longer be in the series' run as well. ==Cast and characters== * K.P. as Ezra Shorts (sheepdog), Tod Ferret (ferret), and Spoiler (donkey) * Yappy Fox as Rummage (raccoon) G.O.F Grey Old Fox (silver fox) BAWWK!

The Funday PawPet Show's website has an archive of all art submitted since 1999. Prior to Art Jams officially starting, viewers started sending in their artwork on their own. It was shared throughout the show. ; Picture Captions: The viewers are asked to send in a suitable caption for a certain picture. The captions are broadcast near the end of the show. ; Roll Call: One of the cast members or guests reads the nicknames of those in the show's IRC channel while the \\"Jarabe tapatío\\" is played. For some broadcasts, such as ones with notable guests or upcoming holidays, a song matching the guest or holiday may be used instead. The verbal roll call was discontinued on episode 500; the chat room names are now listed in the show's closing credits. ; Spits-or-Swallows: The cast eats or drinks something their viewers have sent in, often a food or drink that is generally viewed as displeasing to many. ; Subservience: Inspired by Burger King's The Subservient Chicken, this segment consists of a cast member appearing on camera and performing actions based on suggestions from the audience. It usually features fursuiters, though there have been exceptions, such as Episode 315's Subservient Rasvar,Episode 315 Episode 362's Subservient Captain Jack Sparrow, and Episode 369's Subservient BassMan. ; The Pink Flamingo Challenge: Show visitors are treated to some sort of pastry (preferably of a chocolatey nature) which they are encouraged to eat while viewing a short clip from the ending to the movie Pink Flamingos (in which \\"(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?\\" is played, while Divine chews and swallows dog feces). Since this portion of the film is disturbingly graphic, only the audience's reaction is shown to viewers. On some occasions, a substitute food item (such as a burrito) is offered; on rarer occasions, such as a fursuiting guest, no item is offered. ; Paw Tweets: Announcements, such as birthdays or shout-outs, sent in by viewers up to 140 characters are read aloud. This usually takes place late in the show to allow time for submissions to be made. ; Garrison Skunk's Top 60 Quotes of the Night: A weekly listing of the current episode's funniest/oddest statements is read by Poink, who alternates even/odd numbered quotes with others, including Simba, Yappy, Ezra and Liesel. The feature was begun by longtime viewer and contributor Garrison Skunk who wanted to preserve some notable quotes when it was announced that episode 324 was not being taped due to a machine error. As a joke, the feature retains the number 60 in its title despite growing to over 80 quotes a week, although there have been two alterations. In honor of episode 350, the name was changed to 'Top 350 Quotes of the Night', leading Ezra and Poink to rush through the first page's quotes 350 – 342, only to find that quotes 341 – 61 consisted of a picture of cast member Eaglebeagle saying \\"Bloop!\\", with page 3 continuing as normal. The second time this occurred was after the cast took a three-week hiatus, when Garrison presented the 'Top 20 Things Said in Channel Over the Past Three Weeks'. ==Memorable shows== The Funday PawPet Show had many episodes with unusual or memorable topics. Frequently, themed shows celebrate major holidays such as Christmas, New Year's, Halloween, Valentine's Day, Thanksgiving, the Fourth of July, and Christmas in July. On many occasions, the cast went out to various sites to film sequences. Some of the most notable of these shows include trips to conventions such as Fx and MegaCon to interview many of the guest celebrities. The cast did interviews with the actors from the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. In that show, \\"Mutt\\" kept getting thrown from one star to the next for asking them \\"stupid questions\\". Other celebrities interviewed on the show include: Jason Marsden (Max Goof from A Goofy Movie), Jay North (Dennis the Menace), Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett from Star Wars), and Noel MacNeal (Bear from Bear in the Big Blue House). The show also had \\"bumpers\\" or intros done by various individuals including the a cappella group Toxic Audio. The show had many recurring gags. On the Easter shows, the viewers were challenged to find new and creative ways to destroy chocolate rabbits in \\"Chocolate Bunny Deaths\\". During the Christmas and Christmas in July shows, the cast took part in white elephant gift exchanges on the air, from which some cast members received things like edible underwear, half of a sub sandwich, and a 5-pound container of lard. A Halloween show featured video of purple monsters attempting to scare the Trick or Treaters that appear at the front door of the house where the show is filmed. ; \\"The Ferret Takeover Show\\": Inspired by the film Being John Malkovich, the cast one by one enter a strange back door in the stage and transform into ferrets. ; \\"The Drunk Show\\": Inspired by an episode of WKRP in Cincinnati and intended to celebrate the show's 21st episode (the drinking age in Florida, although for various reasons the topic was ultimately pushed back to the 23rd show), the cast (all of whom agreed to give up their car keys and spend the night in the studio) took one shot of Rumple Minze for every half- hour of broadcast time. This show is considered a somewhat controversial episode of PawPets. ; \\"The Sinkhole Show\\": This was another controversial show. This Halloween show ran a quick disclaimer at the very beginning of the broadcast stating that \\"the show is a dramatization.\\" The disclaimer was run only once. During the course of the broadcast, cast members began talking about a sinkhole that had really formed elsewhere in Orlando. Later, the cast began to describe a fictitious sinkhole forming in the front yard of the house that was threatening to destroy it. At the end of the program, the cast tipped over the stage and severed all connections and feed lines, making it appear as if the house had indeed fallen into a sinkhole. Portions of this episode were repeated in show # 352 (November 4, 2007) where Mutt explained \\"Yappy had literally ripped all of the plugs and power out of the wall (except for one in the bedroom) so no matter how techie you were, it looked like the entire show just dropped, there was no server, there was no nothing.\\" Ezra: \\"JR and I tipped the stage forward, Rasvar moved the lighting truss and Simba dropped a piece of drywall and a couple other things in front of the stage to make it look like everything was happening. Yappy had every single connection in the house yanked out of the wall, except for one, and that was the one that we had in the kitchen, and we were all huddled around one laptop, watching everyone's reaction when everything went dark.\\" Ezra continued: \\"Within about two minutes, every cellphone in this house started ringing, asking us how we were doing.\\" Poink: \\"They were pissed for weeks.\\" Mutt: \\"But about a month later, that was voted the best show ever.\\" ; \\"The Arthur Awards\\": Named after the PawPet Show character Arthur Braunschweiger, this is a parody of the Oscars held on the Sunday night closest to the show, and features categories such as \\"Best Running Joke\\" and \\"Best Song they Never Play on the Show Anymore\\". Topics are selected about two months prior to the show, and viewers were able to vote on them from the PawPet Show's website. ; \\"9/11 Special\\": On the night of September 11, 2001 the cast quickly assembled for an impromptu show to help calm people and find out who in the community was directly affected by the 9/11 attacks. This is the only show that was intentionally never made available for the weekly download. As such, it has not yet resurfaced online. Viewers sent the cast thank-you letters and awards for their efforts. ; \\"2007 Telethon\\": On November 11, 2007, the show raised $10,052 by the end of the show. This count does not include the auctions that were still going on or the donations being sent in via mail. The goal for this year's telethon was $6,000. Also, a new audience record was set with 225 viewers in the chat room. ;\\"2012 Gary Gnu Call-In\\": On May 13, 2012, the voice of Gary Gnu, from \\"The Great Space Coaster\\" called in to the show \\"accidentally\\" while attempting to call his mother, Gnatalie Gnu, for Mother's Day. Immediately following the Gary Gnu call-in, puppeteer Jim Martin, who voiced the character, called in to talk about a fundraiser for the restoration of the program tapes and preservation in possible museums. When the episode started, the fundraiser had been underway for several weeks and had raised $185. By the end of this episode, over $1200 has been raised. Jim later thanked the \\"Furry community\\" for their generosity and the Funday Pawpet Show for \\"getting the word out\\". The goal amount for kickstarting the project was reached. ;\\"End of the world show\\": On December 16, 2012, the entire show revolved around a fictitious asteroid, which would strike at 9:50 and end the show and the world. During the show, various videos showing asteroids travelling toward the earth are shown, Meanwhile, Blitz names the asteroid \\"Apawcalypse\\". The episode ends with President Obama holding an emergency broadcast about the meteor hit. ;\\"It Ends\\": On September 3, 2017, the official final episode of Funday Pawpet Show aired as the following week was a vacation due to Hurricane Irma and the announcement of the show's ending coming September 12. ;\\"It Restarts!\\": On September 9, 2018, the series has officially came back with a new episode resulting in a revival run, with many of its cast returning after a year long hiatus. The series now continues with new episodes on a semi-weekly or monthly basis. ==References== ==External links== * Official web site * Official LiveJournal * Poink's LiveJournal * Tod's LiveJournal * Press coverage * YouTube Page Unofficial * Folkmanis, Inc.

Dulwich Picture Gallery, London. Venetia Anastasia Digby (née Stanley) (December 1600 – 1 May 1633) was a celebrated beauty of the Stuart period and the wife of a prominent courtier and scientist, Kenelm Digby. She was a granddaughter of Henry Percy, 8th Earl of Northumberland. == Life == Venetia Stanley was the third daughter of Sir Edward Stanley (died 1629?), of Tong Castle, Shropshire, a baronet (and grandson of Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby),Grandson of the Earl of Derby via his father Sir Thomas Stanley, Sir Edward was made a baronet and invested as a Knight of the Bath. His family tomb in Tong church inscribed with reference to daughter \\"Venesie\\" surviving him. and Lucy Percy (daughter and co-heiress of the Earl of Northumberland who had been imprisoned for treason for his part in a Catholic plot against Elizabeth I). Lucy Stanley died a few months after giving birth to Venetia. According to The Oxford Dictionary of English Christian Names, \\"Venetia\\" is most likely a Latinization of \\"Gwyneth\\", and the name was popularized by Venetia Stanley. A celebrated beauty, Venetia was presented at the court of James I in her teens. At some point around this time she re-encountered Kenelm Digby, whom she had known in childhood, and they fell in love, exchanging a lock of hair of Venetia's for a diamond ring from Digby. Michael Foster, \\"Digby, Sir Kenelm\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Digby, not yet of age, was sent off on a Grand Tour of Europe by his mother, who disapproved of the relationship. Later he recorded that in 1620, in Angers, France, he caught the eye of Marie de' Medici, queen mother of France. In order to remove himself from this situation, when fighting broke out in Angers, he let it be understood that he had died, and shortly after he joined the English monarchy’s diplomatic mission to Spain. However in England, Digby’s secret letters of reassurance to Venetia that he was alive were withheld by his mother, and Venetia was overcome with grief. It may be during this period that her behaviour caused the gossip later reported as fact by the antiquary John Aubrey, who claimed that she was the \\"concubine\\" of either the courtier Sir Edmund Wylde or Richard Sackville, Earl of Dorset, the latter of whom, Aubrey said, had children by her and settled upon her an annuity of £500 per annum.Oliver Lawson Dick, ed. Aubrey's Brief Lives. Edited from the Original Manuscripts, 1949, s.v. \\"Sir Kenelm Digby\\", p. 98 However Wylde had died in 1620, before the reports of Digby’s death, and Dorset’s will makes no reference to any children by Venetia, even as twentieth-century biographers refer to their child as fact.Will of Dorset: Foster, \\"Kenelm Digby\\", ODNB. Supposed children: see, for example, the claim by R.T. Petersson, Sir Kenelm Digby, The Ornament of England (Harvard University Press, 1956), not merely that they had had a child, and Dorset had left a bequest to her, but that Digby later filed a lawsuit when it was withheld. Yet John Aubrey’s view of her is the one that has prevailed, such as his report that Digby was supposed to have replied to concerns over Venetia's virtue with the comment that \\"A handsome lusty man that was discreet might make a virtuous wife out of a brothel-house.\\" Digby’s return did not immediately mend the breach caused (on Venetia’s side) by Digby’s lack of communication, and (on Digby’s), by rumours of Dorset’s supposed pursuit of Venetia. It was only in 1624, when Digby was attached to the delegation to France, to make arrangements for the soon-to-be King Charles I of England to Henrietta Maria, that Venetia sold her jewellery for Digby to use as living expenses, and Digby understood the depth of her feeling for him. Foster, \\"Kenelm Digby\\", ODNB Digby and Venetia married, most likely in January 1625, in his mother’s absence – she was quarrelling with Lord Stanley, and fears for Venetia’s inheritance may have been at the root of the need for secrecy. In another of Digby’s absences on diplomatic missions, in October 1625, Venetia gave birth to their first child, Kenelm, still in secret, with a single servant to attend her.Mendelson, \\"Venetia Digby\\", ODNB She later bore Digby another three sons, John, George and Everard, the latter of whom died in infancy; she also miscarried twins. Mendelson, \\"Venetia Digby\\", ODNB Venetia was a devout Catholic. According to her husband, who insisted that she conducted herself \\"blamelessly\\" throughout their marriage, she heard Mass daily and prayed for at least several hours a day. She also joined a lay Franciscan group and visited the poor in London. She founded her charity work through a gambling habit, with unusually good luck at the card table and a scheme to save up her profits. She was painted at least three times by Van Dyck in the 1630s: a family portrait, an allegorical portrait as Prudence, and a deathbed portrait, as well as a number of miniatures, including an early one by Isaac Oliver, where she is possibly dressed for a court masque.Now at Sherborne Castle, see Catharine MacLeod, Elizabethan Treasures: Miniatures by Hilliard and Oliver (National Portrait Gallery, 2019) Henri Toutin, posthumous enamel miniature, 1637 In April 1633, Venetia Digby died suddenly in her sleep. Distraught at her loss, Digby permitted an autopsy, not a routine event at the time. She had, he said, been suffering occasional headaches through the previous eight years, for which she took \\"viper-wine\\" (which could have been one of several concoctions involving vipers or their venom in wine, but which is unlikely to have been toxic). The physicians reported finding her brain much putrifyed and corrupted: all the cerebellum was rotten, and retained not the forme of the braine but was meere pus and corrupted matter. (Digby, Letter-Book, 134 Venetia's death was a tragedy for Digby, probably the defining event of his life. Although he had not been faithful while his wife was alive Letter-Book, 448 and he carried out a long relationship with another woman after her death, he never remarried,Foster, \\"Kenelm Digby\\", ODNB and the event separated the two great phases of his life: one in which he was a bright young courtier jockeying for position, and one in which he was a melancholy scientist and Catholic apologist. He commissioned plaster casts made of her head, hands, and feet, and had Van Dyck, a good friend, paint Venetia on her deathbed before she was buried at Christchurch, Newgate, in London, in an elaborate tomb of marble topped with a portrait bust. Soon after, Digby sent his children to live with their grandmother, and himself moved to Gresham College. There he initially spent his time writing letters eulogizing his wife, which, collected together with verses by Ben Jonson and other poets patronized by Digby, eventually formed a volume titled In Praise of Venetia. Around this time he commissioned a portrait of himself from Van Dyck, bare-headed, bearded, and wearing mourning black. Afterwards, he took up in seriousness the scientific experimentation that he was to be known for through the rest of his life. He lost possession of Venetia’s deathbed portrait in one of his flights from England during the English Civil War. (It is now in the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London, and another version is at Althorp.) Shortly before his death in 1665, Digby included in his will his desire to have his \\"dust lie by hers who was my greatest worldly blessing\\",National Archive, PRO, PROB 11/325, f.130 and he was therefore buried in the same black marble and copper tomb Venetia had been buried in three decades earlier. Following his wishes, no inscription was added to hers. Just a year later, the church fell within the area burned in the Great Fire of 1666. John Aubrey later reported seeing in a shop window the gilded bronze bust of Venetia from the top of her tomb, but \\"the fire had got off all the gilding\\". Later, he added, the bust was melted down altogether. Sir Kenelm wrote a \\"Private Memoir\\" of their courtship which is one of the major sources of information about her.Kenelm Digby, Loose Fantasies, ed. V. Gabrieli, 1968 It uses the pseudonyms Theagenes and Stelliana for the main characters, and Digby appears to have revised it intermittently throughout his life. These Private Memoirs were published in London in 1828, in a bowdlerised form. The cut scenes, mostly sexual in nature, were first privately circulated in a pamphlet, and eventually included as an appendix to a later printing within a year or two of the first publication. The book describes the childhood romance of \\"Stelliana\\" and \\"Theagenes\\", various obstacles throughout their adolescence, and final union in a secret marriage, after which child is secretly born in Stelliana's father's house. The book ends with Theagenes on a maritime expedition (modelled after Digby's own exploits), looking forward to his return home to his wife and sons. Yet there is no evidence to verify the document's factual basis. It is not known, for example, the exact identity of \\"Mardontius,\\" the rival suitor to whom \\"Stelliana\\" was engaged during the period in which \\"Theagenes\\" was presumed dead. Aubrey attempted to identify him as Richard Sackville, 3rd Earl of Dorset, but the identification does not hold up to any historical examination. Over the centuries, the most widely disseminated information about Venetia came from John Aubrey's Brief Lives, but Aubrey’s information was hearsay. Vittorio Gabrieli, an Italian scholar, published English-language editions of both In Praise of Venetia and The Private Memoirs in Rome in the second half of the 20th century. An indirect Digby descendant, Roy Digby Thomas, produced a 1956 biography of Sir Kenelm Digby, The Gunpowder Plotter's Legacy, but it contains much now-discredited material. The Dulwich Picture Gallery's catalogue, Death, Passion, and Politics (ed. Ann Sumner), published in conjunction with their exhibition of Van Dyck's portraits of George Digby and Venetia, also contains some errors (for example, referring to Venetia as impoverished – she was not – and referring to her hair as \\"somewhat coarse\\", when Digby specifically stated in his letters that her hair was fine). Nonetheless, it is probably the best current visual resource. ==In fiction== Venetia Digby and her husband are the subjects of the 2014 literary novel Viper Wine by Hermione Eyre.London: Jonathan Cape. ==Portraits== *Isaac (or Peter?)

He distinguished himself at the Battle of Chickamauga and as the father of the annual Juneteenth celebration. ==Early life== Granger was born in Joy, Wayne County, New York, in 1821 to Gaius Granger and Catherine Taylor. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1845 placed thirty-fifth in the class of forty-one.Eicher, p. 263. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant and assigned to the Second Infantry Regiment stationed in Detroit, Michigan. In 1846 he transferred to the newly constituted Regiment of Mounted Riflemen at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. ==Mexican–American War== During the Mexican–American War, Granger fought in Winfield Scott's army. He took part in the Siege of Veracruz, the Battle of Cerro Gordo, the Battle of Contreras, the Battle of Churubusco, and the Battle for Mexico City. Granger received two citations for gallantry and in May 1847 received his regular commission as a second lieutenant. After the war, he served on the western frontier first in Oregon, then in Texas. In 1853 he became a first lieutenant.Biographical register of the officers and graduates of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.: from its establishment, in 1802, to 1890, with the early history of the United States Military Academy / by George W. Cullum, vol. 2. Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1891. ==Civil War== When the Civil War started, Granger was on sick leave. He was temporarily assigned to the staff of General George B. McClellan in Ohio. After recovering, he transferred back to the Regiment of Mounted Riflemen where he was promoted to captain in May 1861. As an adjutant of General Samuel D. Sturgis he saw action at the Battle of Dug Springs and observed the Union defeat at Wilson's Creek in August 1861 in Missouri, serving as a staff officer to General Nathaniel Lyon.The New York Times, August 18, 1861. Granger was cited for gallantry at Wilson's Creek, became a brevet major and was made a commander of the St. Louis Arsenal. In November 1861, Granger assumed command of the 2nd Michigan Cavalry Regiment at Benton Barracks in St. Louis, becoming a colonel of volunteers. One of the Union veterans wrote in a memoir that Granger's \\"military genius soon asserted itself by many severe lessons to the volunteer officers and men of this regiment. He brought them up to the full standard of regulars within a period of three months,\\" and \\"though a gruff appearing man, had succeeded in winning the respect of his regiment by his strict attention to all the details of making a well disciplined body of soldiers out of a mass of awkward men from every walk of life.\\"Conner, p. 41. In February 1862, on the orders of General John Pope, the 2nd Michigan proceeded from St. Louis to Commerce, Missouri, where Pope assembled near 20,000 Union troops for an advance on New Madrid, Missouri. Granger assumed command over the Third Cavalry Brigade consisting of the 2nd and the 3rd Michigan cavalry regiments. After the 7th Illinois joined the brigade, it was reorganized into a cavalry division.Conner, p. 43. On March 26, 1862, Granger was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers and commanded the Cavalry Division, Army of the Mississippi during the Battle of New Madrid and the Siege of Corinth. He was promoted to major general of volunteers on September 17, 1862, and took command of the Army of Kentucky. He conducted cavalry operations in central Tennessee before his command was merged into the Army of the Cumberland, becoming the Reserve Corps. Granger is most famous for his actions commanding the Reserve Corps at the Battle of Chickamauga. There on September 20, 1863, the second day of the battle, he reinforced, without orders, Major General George H. Thomas' XIV Corps on Snodgrass Hill by ordering James B. Steedman to send two brigades under his command to help Thomas.Conner, p. 96. Asked by Thomas if he could counterattack a Confederate force on the Union flank, Granger replied, \\"My men are fresh and they are just the fellows for that work. They are raw troops and don't know any better than to charge up there. This action staved off the Confederate attackers until dark, permitting the Federal forces to retreat in good order and thus helping Thomas to earn the sobriquet \\"Rock of Chickamauga\\".Mark Greenbaum. The Rock of Chickamauga, The New York Times, September 22, 2013. After the battle, Granger wrote in his report, \\"being well convinced, judging from the sound of battle, that the enemy were pushing him [Thomas], and fearing that would not be able to resist their combined attack, I determined to go to his assistance at once.\\"Conner, p. 95. Admiral David Farragut & General Gordon Granger Granger's effective leadership at Chickamauga earned him command of the newly formed IV Corps in the Army of the Cumberland commanded by General Thomas, and he was promoted brevet lieutenant colonel of the U.S. Army. Under his command, the IV Corps force distinguished itself at the third Battle of Chattanooga. Two of the IV Corps' divisions, those commanded by Thomas J. Wood and Philip Sheridan, were among the units that assaulted the reinforced center of the Confederate line on top of Missionary Ridge. There, the Union forces broke through and forced the Confederates, under General Braxton Bragg, to retreat. After Chattanooga, Granger took part in lifting the siege at Knoxville, Tennessee. Despite these successes, his outspokenness and bluntness with the superiors including General Ulysses S. Grant, who disliked Granger,Conner, p. 186. prevented him from gaining more prominent commands at the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. He was sent to the Department of the Gulf under General E. R. S. Canby, and commanded a division that provided land support to the naval operations conducted by Admiral David Farragut in the Gulf of Mexico. Granger led the land forces that captured Forts Gaines and Morgan in conjunction with the Union naval operations during the Battle of Mobile Bay. Granger commanded the XIII Corps during the Battle of Fort Blakeley, which led to the fall of the city of Mobile, Alabama. ==Postbellum== General Order No. 3, June 19, 1865 When the war ended, Granger was given command of the District of Texas.Dupuy, p. 290 On June 19, 1865 in the city of Galveston, one of the first orders of business was to read to the people of Texas Granger's General Order No. 3 which began with:From Texas: Important Orders by General Granger. The New York Times, July 7, 1865. This set off joyous demonstrations by freedmen, originating the annual Juneteenth celebration, which commemorates the abolition of slavery in Texas. Granger remained in the Army after mustering out from volunteer service. In July 1866, he was assigned as a colonel to the reconstituted 25th Infantry Regiment. He was reassigned as colonel of the 15th Infantry Regiment, December 15, 1870. He was given command of the District of New Mexico, from April 29, 1871, to June 1, 1873. He was on sick leave of absence to October 31, 1875; and then was again in command of the District of New Mexico, October 31, 1875, to January 10, 1876.George W. Cullum's Register of Officers and Graduates of the United States Military Academy, Vol. II, 1891, p.237, 1265 Gordon Granger On January 10, 1876, Granger died in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he was serving in command of the District of New Mexico.Gen.

The trustworthy Chronicle of Edessa gives his date as 451-452 (Hallier, No. lxvii); and the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian makes him contemporary with Nonus, who became the 31st bishop of Edessa in 449. He is to be distinguished from Isaac of Nineveh, a Nestorian writer on the ascetic life who belongs to the second half of the 7th century. As to the identity and history of the author considerable difficulty has arisen. The statements of ancient writers, Eastern and Western, were collected by Assemani (B.O. i. 2072 14). According to these accounts Isaac flourished under Theodosius II, and was a native either of Amid (Diyarbakir) or of Edessa. Several writers identify him with Isaac, the disciple of St. Ephraim, who is mentioned in the anonymous Life of that father; but according to the patriarch Bar Shushan (d. 1073), who made a collection of his homilies, his master was Ephraim's disciple Zenobius. He is supposed to have migrated to Antioch, and to have become abbot of one of the convents in its neighborhood. According to Zacharias Rhetor he visited Rome and other cities, and the Zuqnin Chronicle by Pseudo-Dionysius of Tell-Mahr informs us that he composed poems on the Secular Games of 404, and wrote on the destruction of Rome by Alaric I in 410. He also commemorated the destruction of Antioch by an earthquake in 459, so that he must have lived till about 460. Unfortunately these poems have perished. When we examine the collection of homilies attributed to Isaac, a difficulty arises on two grounds. #The author of some of the poems is a fervent proponent of Chalcedonian orthodoxy (see especially Nos. 1-3 in Bickell's edition =62-64 in Bedjan), in other and more important homilies (such as Bickell 6, 8=Bedjan 59, 61, and especially Bedjan 60) the doctrine is monophysite, even though Eutyches and Nestorius are equally condemned. #One of the monophysite homilies, the famous poem of 2136 lines on the parrot which uttered the Trisagion in the streets of Antioch (Bickell, 8=Bedjan 61), appears to have been written at Antioch after Peter the Fuller (patriarch 471-488) raised the dispute about the addition to the doxology of the words qui crucifixus es pro nobis. It is therefore scarcely possible that the author of this homily should be the same who composed the lost poems on the secular games in 404 and on the sack of Rome. Moreover, T. J. Lamy (S. Ephraemi hymni et sermones, iv. 361-364) and Bedjan (Homiliae S. Isaaci, i. pp. iv-ix) have called attention to statements made by Jacob of Edessa (708) in a letter to John the Stylite. He says there were three Isaacs who wrote in Syriac, two Monophysite and one Chalcedonian: #The first, he says, a native of Amid, and pupil of S. Ephraim, visited Rome in the time of Arcadius (395-408), on his return journey suffered imprisonment at Constantinople, and afterwards became a priest in the church of Amid. #The second was a priest of Edessa, and flourished in the reign of Zeno (474-491). He went up to Antioch in the time of Peter the Fuller. Jacob then tells the story of the parrot (see above). #The third was also an Edessene. At first in the days of Bishop Paul (510-522) he was monophysite, but afterwards in the time of the Chalcedonian bishop Asclepius he wrote poems setting forth \\"Nestorian\\" (i.e. Chalcdonian) doctrine. With such conflicting evidence it is impossible to arrive at a certain result. But Jacob is an early witness: and on the whole it seems safe to concltide with Bedjan (p. ix) that works by at least two authors have been included in the collection attributed to Isaac of Antioch. Still the majority of the poems are the work of one hand the 5th-century monophysite who wrote the poem on the parrot. A full listi of the 191 poems existing in European MSS. is given by Bickell, who copied out 181 with a view to publishing them all: the other 10 had been previously copied by Pius Zingerle. But the two volumes published by Bickell in his lifetime (Gießen, 1873 and 1877) contain only 37 homilies. Bedjan's edition, of which the first volume has alone appeared (Paris, 1903) contains 67 poems, viz. 24 previously published (18 by Bickell), and 43 that are new, though their titles are all included in Bickells list. The writer's main interest lies in the application of religion to the practical duties of life, whether in the church or in the world. He has a great command of forcible language and considerable skill in apt illustration. The zeal with which he denounces the abuses prevalent in the church of his day, and particularly in the monastic orders, is not unlike that of the Protestant reformers. He shows acquaintance with many phases of life. He describes the corruption of judges, the prevalence of usury and avarice, the unchastity which especially characterized the upper classes, and the general hypocrisy of so-called Christians. His doctrinal discussions are apt to be diffuse; but he seldom loses sight of the bearing of doctrine on practical life. He judges with extreme severity those who argue about religion while neglecting its practice, and those who though stupid and ignorant dare to pry into mysteries which are sealed to the angels. \\"Not newly have we found Him, that we should search and pry into God. As He was He is: He changeth not with the times. ... Confess that He formed thee of dust: search not the mode of His being: Worship Him that He redeemed thee by His only Son: inquire not the manner of His birth.\\" Some of Isaac's works have an interest for the historian of the 5th century. In two poems (Bickell II, I2=Bedjan 48, 49), written probably at Edessa, he commemorates the capture of Beth-Uur, a city near Nisibis, by the Arabs. Although the historical allusions are far from clear, we gather that Beth-UUr, which in zealous paganism had been a successor to Uaran, had been in earlier days devastated by the Persians; but for the last 34 years the Persians had themselves suffered subjection. And now had come a flood of Arab invaders, sons of Hagar, who had swept away the city and carried all its inhabitants captive. From these two poems, and from the 2nd homily on Fasting (Bickell 14=Bedjan 17) we gain a vivid picture of the miseries borne by the inhabitants of that frontier region during the wars between Persia and the Romano-Greek empire. There are also instructive references to the heathen practices and the worship of pagan deities (such as Baalti, Uzzi, Gedlath and the planet Venus) prevalent in Mesopotamia. Two other poems (Bickell 35, 36=Bedjan 66, 67), written probably at Antioch, describe the prevalence of sorcery and the extraordinary influence possessed by Chaldeans and enchanters over women who were nominally Christians. The date of Isaac of Nineveh is now known from the Liber fundatorum of Ish-dlnah, an 8th-century writer; see Bedjan's edition, and Chabot, Livre de la chastete, p. 63\\\\. Assemani (B.O. i. 445) had placed him late in the 6th century, and Chabot (De S. Isaaci Ninivitae vita, &c.;) in the second half of the 5th. Lamy (op. cit. iv. 364-366) has pointed out that several of the poems are in certain MSS. attributed to Ephraim. Possibly the author of the orthodox poems was not named Isaac at all. Assemani's list of 104 poems (B.O. i. 254-234) is completely covered by Bickell's. The metre of all the published homilies is heptasyllabic. ==References== * Category:Syriac writers ","title":"Isaac of Antioch"},{"id":"1440373","text":"Social conservatism in Canada represents conservative positions on issues of family, sexuality and morality. In the European and North American context, social conservatives believe in natural law as well as traditional family values and policies. ==Background== Canada's political and social history stems from long established ties to conservative institutions and ideals. The major founding institutions of pre-Confederation Canada, both in English and French Canada, were religious organizations. Groups such as the Jesuits in Quebec and various Anglican missions in Ontario gave rise to the founding educational, political and social hierarchies of the ensuing centuries. The Catholic Church's control and influence in Quebec was insurmountable for nearly 3 centuries prior to the Quiet Revolution. Similarly, British Toryism and Protestant puritanical ideals in Ontario were so deeply entrenched after the migration of conservative United Empire Loyalists fleeing the American Revolution that laws regarding alcohol, tobacco sales and gambling are still strictly regulated in Ontario. At the turn of the 20th century, Toronto had strict moralistic by-laws (which included a ban on Sunday sports into the 1950s as well as Sunday shopping into the 1980s). To this day, Ontario has some of the strictest liquor laws outside the Near and Middle East. The extent to which social conservatism was embedded in 19th and 20th-centuries is evidenced by the power and influence of Tory factions in pre-Confederation Canada, such as the Family Compact and the Chateau Clique, the prominence of the Conservative Party of Canada after Confederation and the pronounced stifling of left-leaning or progressive views until after the Second World War. Even to this day, social conservatism in Canada has a wide base of support outside the major urban centres of Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. In modern times, however, social conservatism has not been as influential in Canada as in the past. The main reason is that right-wing, neoliberal politics as promoted by leaders such as Paul Martin and Prime Minister Stephen Harper have not been linked to moral or social conservatism.John Middlemist Herrick and Paul H. Stuart, eds. Encyclopedia of social welfare history in North America (2005) p. 143 That is, there is no large political party behind it, and social conservatives have divided their votes.David M. Haskell, Through a lens darkly: how the news media perceive and portray evangelicals (2009) p 57 Social conservatives demand a return to traditional morality and social mores, often through civil law or regulation. Social change away from traditional values is generally regarded as suspect, while social values based on tradition are generally regarded as tried, tested and true. It is a view commonly associated with religious conservatives, particularly Evangelicals or conservative Roman Catholics. Socially conservative values do not necessarily coincide with those of right-wing fiscal conservatism. Fiscally left-leaning politicians may embrace socially conservative values. Examples of socially conservative Canadians include Christian Heritage Party leader Jim Hnatiuk former leader Ron Gray and former leader of the Conservative Party of Canada Andrew Scheer. ==Political impact== Stockwell Day In modern Canadian politics, social conservatives often felt that they were being sidelined by officials in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. Many of them felt shunned by a party that was largely led and run by Red Tories for the last half of the twentieth century. Many eventually made their political home with the Reform Party of Canada and its forerunner the Social Credit Party of Canada. Despite Reform leader Preston Manning's attempts to broaden the support of the Reform movement through populism, the party was dominated by social conservatives. Manning's reluctance to allow his party to wholly embrace socially conservative values contributed to his deposition as leader of the new Canadian Alliance in favour of Stockwell Day.Murray Dobbin, Preston Manning and the Reform Party (1991) The social conservative movement remained very influential in the Canadian Alliance even after Day's defeat at the hands of Stephen Harper in 2002. In the Conservative Party of Canada that emerged from a coalition of Canadian Alliance members and Progressive Conservatives, social conservatives are still a force to be taken into account, but many Conservative Party supporters have been disappointed with what they regard as the minimal influence of social conservatism in the Stephen Harper government. In part this minimal influence can be explained by the fact of a minority government, but some would blame it also on Harper's own lack of enthusiasm for the changes social conservatives would advocate. There is a large relationship between fiscal liberalism and social conservatism among Canadian ethnic communities. These communities have for the last twenty years voted conservative-leaning. The Christian Heritage Party of Canada is also socially conservative, as are its provincial wings like the Christian Heritage Party of British Columbia. There are other socially conservative provincial parties such as the Family Coalition Party of Ontario or the Alberta Social Credit Party. ===Geography=== Social conservatism is strongest in Alberta, long Canada's most conservative province, where the Social Credit movement preached evangelical values and came to power in the 1930s.Robert Alexander Grambell, Toward defining the prairies: region, culture and history (2001) p. 29 It is a factor as well in parts of British Columbia outside of the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island.Robert K. Burkinshaw. Pilgrims in Lotus Land: Conservative Protestantism in British Columbia 1917-1981 (Mcgill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion, 1995) Social conservatives are strongest in rural settings, especially in Western Canada, however, social conservatism is not limited geographically to any one area or to any one political party.

Carr (1924-1944), who was awarded a posthumous Silver Star Medal for his heroism on board the destroyer escort during the Battle off Samar. Carr was laid down on 26 March 1982 by the Todd Pacific Shipyards Co., Seattle Division, Seattle, Wash.; launched on 26 February 1983; sponsored by Goldie Carr Bensilhe, GM3 Carr's widow; and commissioned on 27 July 1985, Commander Robert J. Horne in command. ==History== ===Operation Earnest Will=== Carrs original homeport was in Charleston, South Carolina. Her first operational deployment was to the Persian Gulf, where Carr was involved in Operation Earnest Will, escorting re-flagged oil tankers through the Strait of Hormuz. While Commander, Destroyer Squadron 14, was the senior officer present, Commander Wade C. Johnson, the captain of Carr, was the next senior officer in the area and was routinely assigned the duties of Convoy Commander during escort missions. During one of these, Iranian small boats approached the tankers and were chased off by bullets from Carrs deck-mounted M2 .50-caliber machine guns and the Bushmaster 25mm chain gun on the starboard main deck. ===Bonefish disaster=== Carr returned to Charleston in late March 1988, and 31 days later, was ordered underway to replace another ship that had been unable to get underway. Sent to sea to conduct anti-submarine exercises with the aircraft carrier and submarine . On 24 April 1988, Carr was first on the scene to help rescue the crew of the attack submarine Bonefish, which had suffered a battery fire while submerged. Deploying her 26-foot whaleboat and five inflatable life rafts, Carr helped rescue 89 of Bonefishs crew, using the whaleboat, life rafts, its embarked SH-60B Seahawk of Helicopter Squadron (Light) HSL-44, with crew; Lt. Lee, AWs Laster and Hendrix, the SH-3H Sea King helicopters from John F. Kennedy. The ship communicated to the land-based Commander, Atlantic Fleet watch center using the Joint Operational Tactical System's (JOTS) \\"opnote\\" capability. Crew muster lists were sent ashore as rescued crew members were identified. For her professionalism in the rescue, Carr was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation. ===Exercises in the Caribbean=== In October 1988, Carr made a port visit to Tampa, Florida, at the request of the local Navy League chapter, mooring at Harbor Island pier. Public tours were held for several days in celebration of Navy Week, honoring the Navy's birthday. The commissioning commanding officer, Captain Robert Horne, was stationed at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa and was there to greet the ship. In March 1989, Carr was sent to Fleet Training Group, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for Refresher Training (REFTRA). While the ship conducted exercises in all departments, Mikhail Gorbachev was making a visit to Havana, Cuba. News crews from NBC, headed by Henry Champ, and ABC, by Bob Zelnick, each spent a day aboard Carr to observe the training. In summer 1989, while Carr was heading to the Puerto Rican Operation Area (PROA) for the Middle East Force Exercise (MEFEX), both of the ship's laundry washers broke down. With the permission of the Squadron Commodore running MEFEX, Carrs Seahawk helicopter flew into Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, and the Supply Officer purchased a household washing machine from the Navy Exchange. The washer was unboxed on the ramp at the airfield, loaded in the helicopter and flown to the ship, where it was plumbed in to the water system and served as the crew laundry for the next several weeks. ===Hurricane Hugo=== On 18 September 1989, Carr sailed from Charleston to be on station off the Naval Station Mayport for the week to provide a practice flight deck for the SH-60B Seahawk squadrons. That night, an officer of HSL-44 came aboard and informed the captain that the helicopters would be flying to Georgia the following day in preparation for the impending arrival of Hurricane Hugo. On the morning of 19 September, Carr entered Naval Station Mayport and moored, awaiting further instructions. At midnight on the 20th, Carr got underway and headed south to the Strait of Florida to avoid the storm. Once the hurricane was safely past, the captain ordered the ship to sail towards Charleston. Carr was the first Navy vessel to return to the port of Charleston the morning after Hurricane Hugo made landfall there. Carr remained anchored for three days, unable to enter port, as essentially all navigation aids were moved or destroyed by the hurricane. One of the Coast Guard ships at anchor sent a small boat to the USCG Station in Charleston, taking along Carrs Sonar Technician Chief Petty Officer Steven Hatherly. STGC Hatherly made his way to the Naval Station, where he phoned most of the crew's families and reported their status to the ship via bridge- to-bridge VHF radio that evening. From their anchorage, the crew could easily see the bridge between the Isle of Palms and the mainland in the air, as well as the demolished houses along the shore. Local television stations were returning the transmitting and the crew had little to do besides consider the condition of their families and possessions ashore. Carr was ordered to proceed to Naval Station Mayport. Arriving the next morning, the local community had staged relief supplies to be taken to Charleston. The next day, Carr was directed to return to her homeport. Upon arrival, there were no shore services, so the Engineering Department kept the engineering plant on line to provide power, air-conditioning, fresh water and other support services. Crew members were dispatched, during the day, to assist in the clean up of the Naval Station, the Naval Weapons Station and the local community. As time permitted, they also helped each other's families secure their belongings and clean up their homes. For this response the natural disaster, Carr was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal. ===Change of command and return to the Persian Gulf=== In early October 1989, the first formal ceremony of any type at the Naval Station held was the change of command for Carr, with Commander Edward \\"Ned\\" Bagley, III, USN relieving Commander Wade C. Johnson, USN. The Change of Command was held in the morning and that afternoon, Commander, Destroyer Squadron 4 held their change of command. On 31 October 1991 Carr sailed from Charleston for her second operation deployment, assigned to the Commander, Middle East Force. En route the Red Sea, Carr made port visits to the Alicante, Palma Majorca, Spain, Naples Italy, Athens Greece and Hiafa Israel, then transited the Suez Canal. During this deployment, Carr spend the first half assigned to tanker escort duties in the Strait of Hormuz and Maritime Interdiction Force in support of UN sanctions of Iraq. The later part of the cruise was spent operating in the Northern Red Sea, conducting electronic surveillance and early warning duties for the units operating to the south. Carr left the Red Sea the end of March 1991 and returned to Charleston a month later. Change of Command and Final Two Deployments In October 2010, Carr's final change of command took place pier side in Norfolk, Virginia when Commander Patrick Kulakowski relieved Commander Eric Ver Hage. Carr completed a dry-docking availability at NORSHIPCO in Norfolk to close out 2010 before completing a January-February COMPTUEX in preparation for deployment. In June, 2011 Carr arrived in Staten Island, NY for New York City Fleet Week and Boston, MA for Dorchester Day. On 14 June, 2011 (returned 15 Nov, 2011) Carr departed for a combined Northern European Theater Security Cooperation Deployment and Caribbean Countering Illicit Traffic deployment. Countries visited included the Azores, England, Russia, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Norway, Scotland, Cuba, Panama, Costa Rica, and Curacao. On 1 June, 2012 (returned 30 Nov, 2012) Carr departed Norfolk, VA on its final deployment to conduct Counter Illicit Trafficking in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific. On 30 November 2012, Carr delivered 1.5 tons of cocaine and almost two tons of marijuana to Mayport, Florida, before continuing back to Norfolk.\\"4TH Fleet Frigate Off-Loads $114 Million in Drugs.\\" Decommissioning On 13 March 2013, Carr was decommissionedhttp://www.navytimes.com/news/2012/03/navy-11-ships-to-be- decommissioned-in-fiscal-2013-031412w/ pierside at Naval Station Norfolk.

An inscription was found engraved on stone, consisting of 72 lines of verse (trochaic tetrameters, hexameters, ionics), mainly in the Doric Greek dialect. It is preceded by two lines of prose stating that the author was Isvllus, an Epidaurian, and that it was dedicated to Asclepius and Apollo of Malea. It contains a few political remarks, showing general sympathy with an aristocratic form of government; a self-congratulatory notice of the resolution, passed at the poets instigation, to arrange a solemn procession in honor of the two gods; a paean (no doubt for use in the procession), chiefly occupied with the genealogical relations of Apollo and Asclepius; a poem of thanks for the assistance rendered to Sparta by Asclepius against \\"Philip\\", when he led an army against Sparta to put down the monarchy. The offer of assistance was made by the god himself to the youthful poet, who had entered the Asclepieum to pray for recovery from illness, and communicated the good news to the Spartans.

The father was born in Kingston, in 1759, and the mother in Brentwood, in 1761. They came to Readfield in 1784, where they had a family of twelve children, eight daughters and four sons, two of whom died in childhood. John was the eldest son. The father was a physician and farmer and for a time was prosperous, but misfortune overtook him and he finally lost a greater part of his property. His father died April 22, 1838, and his mother died October 20, 1847. John in his boyhood days had only the advantages of the district school of his town, and when he was sixteen years old he had spent only ten months in a high school. He was a young man of great muscular power, and his strength was utilized in carrying on the work of the farm, of which he had charge. Having resolved to get an education, he devoted all his spare hours to study until he was nineteen years old. In 1813, then in his twentieth year. his father gave him fifteen dollars and a horse. With this outfit John started for Dartmouth College to learn the requirements for entering that institution, and then immediately commenced to fit himself for complying with them. He rode to Albany, New York, where he engaged as tutor in a private family, devoting all his leisure hours to study. So good progress had he made in the work of preparing himself for his contemplated collegiate course, that in one year he was able to pass the examination for admission to the Sophomore class. Entering Dartmouth in 1814, he graduated in the class of 1816, with high rank, especially in the department of mathematics. After his graduation he became Principal of the Academy at Hallowell, where he taught two years to earn money to pay the debts incurred in college. He then accepted a flattering offer to go to Dinwiddie County, Virginia, to teach at an academy. Here he remained two years, and having decided to take medicine as a profession, he entered the Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, in 1820, receiving his diploma as Doctor of Medicine in 1822. During his former residence in Virginia, Mr. Hubbard had made many friends, and upon graduating from the medical school, he resolved to go to that State and practice his profession. Here he remained seven years, until 1829, during which time he had built up a very successful business. In 1825 he married Miss Sarah [Hodge] Barrett[Hodge, Orlando John “Hodge Genealogy from the First of the Name in This Country to the Present Time: With a Number of Allied Families and Many Historical Facts pub 1900 p.266] of Dresden, Maine. They had two children, one of whom died in Virginia. A brother, Thomas, who had fitted himself for a doctor, followed John to Virginia, and just as he was entering upon a most promising professional career was stricken with disease and died. ==Coping with loss== The loss of his child and brother so disheartened Doctor Hubbard and his wife that they resolved to return to Maine. Before doing this he thought it best to spend some time in the hospitals and medical school in Philadelphia, in more thoroughly perfecting himself in his profession. This he did, and then in 1830 became a permanent resident of Hallowell, Maine. Here he gained a wide reputation as a medical practitioner. He was a man of great physical force and of vigorous intellect, and his experience and immense energy of body and mind soon placed him in the front rank of physicians in the State. He would often drive seventy-five miles to visit patients or consult with other physicians in dangerous cases, and it is said that he kept four horses in almost constant use. No distance seemed too long or deprivation too great for him, and he was ready at all times, night or day, to answer calls for his services. Though devoted to his profession and engrossed in its cares and labors, Doctor Hubbard did not neglect his political duties. Espousing the principles of the Democratic Party in his younger years, he was always an ardent adherent to it and gave it his unqualified support. In 1843 he was elected to the Maine Senate and served with distinction. During the session, an effort was made to pass a law to obstruct the operations of the Fugitive Slave Law passed by Congress in 1793. Doctor Hubbard was chairman of the Committee to which this bill and all petitions supporting it were referred. While he was an outspoken enemy of slavery, he argued that to pass this bill would be an unconstitutional act and a violation of the federal compact. His arguments prevailed, and the bill was killed in the Senate. ==Hubbard the governor== In 1849 Doctor Hubbard was nominated by his party as its candidate for governor and was elected over his Whig opponent, E. L. Hamlin, brother of future Vice President Hannibal Hamlin. He was re-elected in 1850, the Whig candidate this time being William G. Crosby. By an amendment in the Constitution the beginning of the political year was restored to the first Wednesday in January, and the Government, by an act of the Legislature, was continued over without an election in 1851. Governor Hubbard was re-nominated in 1852, but while he received a large plurality of the popular vote he failed to get a majority, and William G. Crosby, the Whig candidate, was elected by the Legislature after a severe contest. During his term of office, Governor Hubbard advocated the establishment of a reform school, the establishment of an agricultural college, the establishment of a female college, and suitable appropriations for the support of academies and colleges, nearly all of which measures were subsequently adopted. He urged that all the lands lying in this state owned in common or in severalty by Massachusetts and Maine be purchased by the state. A resolve was passed in 1852 authorizing him to take such action as he deemed proper, and the Governor with Anson Morrill and John A. Poor entered into negotiations that finally resulted in the purchase of these lands at most satisfactory prices by the state. In 1851 he, as governor, signed the first prohibition act known as the \\"Maine law\\". This caused considerable dissatisfaction in his party, and no doubt was the cause of his defeat that year. ==Last years== Hubbard was conscientious in the discharge of his official duties, doing what he believed to be right, regardless of friends or foes. He was the earnest supporter of every cause which he thought would advance the moral, social, or personal welfare of the people. In 1859 he was appointed a commissioner under the Reciprocity Treaty concluded between the United States and Great Britain in 1854, in which the fisheries questions were involved. This was his last official position. The death of son John Hubbard, who fell in the attack on Port Hudson, in May 1863, in the Civil War, was a sorrow that clouded his last years. His son, Colonel Thomas Hamlin Hubbard served in the Maine Militia and survived the war. He lived to see the end of the war, but not that entire restoration of peace between the North and South he greatly desired. He died suddenly, at his home in Hallowell, February 6, 1869. ==Sources== *Representative Men of Maine: A Collection of Biographical Sketches of all the Governors since the formation of the State.

P. Jacobsen\\" (and pronounced \\"I. P. Jacobsen\\"). He began the naturalist movement in Danish literature and was a part of the Modern Breakthrough. ==Biography== Jacobsen was born in Thisted in Jutland, the eldest of the five children of a prosperous merchant. He went to school in Copenhagen and was a student at the University of Copenhagen in 1868. As a boy, he showed a remarkable talent for science, in particular botany. In 1870, although he was already secretly writing poetry, Jacobsen adopted botany as a profession. He was sent by a scientific body in Copenhagen to report on the flora of the islands of Anholt and Læsø. Around this time, the discoveries of Charles Darwin began to fascinate him. Realizing that the work of Darwin was not well known in Denmark, he translated The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man into Danish. When still young, Jacobsen was struck by tuberculosis which eventually ended his life. His illness prompted travels to southern Europe, cut him off from scientific investigation, and drove him to literature. He met the famous critic Georg Brandes, who was struck by his powers of expression, and under his influence, in the spring of 1873, Jacobsen began his great historical romance, Marie Grubbe. Jacobsen was an atheist.Flynn, T. (2007). The new encyclopedia of unbelief. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books. \\"Danish atheists include the authors...Jens Peter Jacobsen.\\" ==Literary works== Jacobsen's canon consists of two novels, seven short stories, and one posthumous volume of poetry – small, but enough to place him as one of the most influential Danish writers. ===Prose=== The historical novel Fru Marie Grubbe (1876, Eng. transl.: Marie Grubbe. A Lady of the Seventeenth Century 1917) is the first Danish treatment of a woman as a sexual creature. Based upon the life of a 17th-century Danish noblewoman, it charts her downfall from a member of the royal family to the wife of a ferryman, as a result of her desire for an independent and satisfying erotic life. In many ways the books anticipates the themes of D. H. Lawrence. Jacobsen's second novel Niels Lyhne (1880, English translation 1919) traces the fate of an atheist in a merciless world: his lack of faith is \\"tested\\" by tragedies and personal crises until he dies in war, disillusioned but unrepentant. According to biographer Morten Høi Jensen, the novel anticipates the work of Albert Camus. Jacobsen's short stories are collected in Mogens og andre Noveller (1882, translated as Mogens and Other Tales, 1921, and Mogens and Other Stories, 1994). Among them must be mentioned Mogens (1872, his official debut), the tale of a young dreamer and his maturing during love, sorrow and new hope of love. Et Skud i Taagen (A Shot in the Fog) is a Poe-inspired tale of the sterility of hatred and revenge. Pesten i Bergamo (The Plague of Bergamo) shows people clinging to religion even when tempted to be \\"free men\\". Fru Fønss (1882) is a sad story about a widow's tragic break with her egoistic children when she wants to remarry. Mogens og andre Noveller and Niels Lyhne were both highly praised by Rainer Maria Rilke in his letters to Franz Xaver Kappus, translated as Letters to a Young Poet. ===Poetry=== The poems of Jacobsen are more influenced by late romanticism than his prose. Many of them are wistful, dreamy and melancholic but also naturalistic. Most important is the great obscure poem Arabesque to a Hand- drawing by Michel Angelo (about 1875) the idea of which seems to be that art is going to replace immortality as the meaning of life. They significantly inspired the Danish symbolist poetry of the 1890s. ==Legacy== Unlike many of his colleagues Jacobsen did not take much interest in politics, his main interests being science and psychology. He is primarily an artist: his ability to create \\"paintings\\" and arabesque-like scenes both in his prose and his poetry (which has sometimes been criticized as \\"mannered\\") is one of the secrets of his art. It has been said that his novels are a presentation of various snapshots rather than tales of action. In spite of his not very extensive oeuvre Jacobsen's international influence has been quite strong. In Germany both his novels and poems were widely read and they are known to have influenced Thomas Mann, as well as the Englishmen George Gissing and D. H. Lawrence. Gissing read the Reclam edition of Niels Lyhne in 1889 and again in 1890 when he wrote 'which I admire more than ever'.Coustillas. Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist, Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, pp.156-7 and 211-2. Jacobsen's works also greatly inspired Rainer Maria Rilke's prose: in Briefe an einen jungen Dichter (trans. Letters to a Young Poet) (1929) Rilke recommends to Franz Xaver Kappus to read the works of Jacobsen, adding that Rilke always carried the Bible and Jacobsen's collected works. Further, Rilke's only novel Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge (translated as The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge) (1910) is semi-autobiographical but is heavily influenced by Jacobsen's second novel Niels Lyhne (1880) which traces the fate of an atheist in a merciless world. Jacobsen also influenced many other authors of the turn of the 20th century, including Henrik Ibsen, Sigmund Freud, Hermann Hesse, Stefan Zweig, and T. E. Lawrence, who all commented on his work. Thomas Mann once told an interviewer that \\"perhaps it is J. P. Jacobsen who has had the greatest influence on my style so far.\\" He also had a musical influence: Frederick Delius's Fennimore and Gerda and Arnold Schönberg's Gurre-Lieder are based upon themes from Jacobsen's books. Schoenberg also set a Jacobsen text, translated by Robert Franz Arnold, as No. 4 of his Six Songs, Op. 3. Jacobsen's Samlede Skrifter is featured in the Hong Kong Disneyland theme park in Tarzan's Treehouse as one of the books salvaged from a shipwreck. ==Works== * Mogens (1872) * Fru Marie Grubbe (1876) * Niels Lyhne (1880) * Pesten i Bergamo (1881) * Mogens og andre Noveller (1882) * Digte (1886) * Skitser og Udkast (1886) ===About J.

He ended his career at the end of 2006–07 season. ==Club career== On the club level, Zdravkov has played for Levski Sofia (1989–1995), Istanbulspor (1997–1999 and 2000–2002), Adanaspor (1999–2000), Cherno More (2002–2003), Litex Lovech (2003–2004) and Çaykur Rizespor (2004–2007). December 2002 until January 2003, Zdravkov spent a trial period with Arsenal F.C., but did not eventually sign with the then-reigning FA Premier League champions. ==International career== For Bulgaria, Zdravkov has been capped 70 times. He made his debut on 24 April 1996, against Slovakia in Trnava. He was the starting goalkeeper for his country at the Euro 1996, 1998 World Cup and Euro 2004. Halfway through the France World Cup in 1998, with Bulgaria having played two games (0–0 against Paraguay and a 0–1 loss to Nigeria), Zdravkov was ranked as the 2nd best goalkeeper in form. Although he went on to concede 6 goals in Bulgaria's loss to Spain in the next game, Zdravkov was an exceptional performer at the World Cup. Six years later, at UEFA Euro 2004, Zdravkov's age began to show, as he was completely outclassed by Swedish, Danish and Italian attackers. Bulgaria lost 0–5 to Sweden, 0–2 to Denmark and 1–2 to Italy, and this was to be Zdravkov's final tournament as national team goalkeeper. ==Personal== Zdravkov participated in the third season of Survivor BG, in Panama, but was evacuated due to serious health problems.

Åndalsnes is the administrative center of Rauma Municipality. It is located along the Isfjorden, at the mouth of the Rauma River, at the north end of the Romsdalen valley. The village of Isfjorden lies about to the east, Veblungsnes lies just to the west across the Rauma River, and Innfjorden lies about to the southwest via the European Route E136 highway. The town has a population (2018) of 2,403 and a population density of . Åndalsnes has an association football club, Åndalsnes IF. The local church is Grytten Church, but its actually located across the river in Veblungsnes. The town's newspaper, Åndalsnes Avis, had a circulation of 4,125 in 2007. The harbour is called \\"Tindekaia\\", and is visited every year by many cruise ships, including Costa Marina, MS Thomson Celebration, Costa Victoria, and Costa Atlantica (the largest ship that currently comes to Åndalsnes). ==Geography== Åndalsnes is located at the mouth of the river Rauma, at the shores of the Romsdalsfjord, one of the first Norwegian rivers to host English fly fishermen in the nineteenth century. The river's salmon population is currently undergoing restoration after seeing strong declines in the 1980s following an infestation with the salmon parasite Gyrodactylus salaris. As many other infested rivers, the river Rauma is experiencing an increase in the population of sea trout. The river flows through the Romsdalen valley, which features some of the most spectacular scenery in the entire country. Trollveggen (the Troll Wall) one of the cliff formations in the valley, has a vertical drop of over . It was an early launch site for European BASE jumpers. ==Transportation== The European route E136 highway and Norwegian County Road 64 both pass through Åndalsnes. County Road 64 heads to the towns of Molde and Kristiansund to the north and the E136 highway heads to the town of Ålesund to the west and to Dombås to the southeast. The Rauma Line terminates at the port of Åndalsnes, with bus connections to the nearby towns of Molde and Ålesund. ==History== The village of Åndalsnes was the administrative centre of the old municipality of Grytten from 1838 until 1964 when Grytten was merged with several other municipalities to form the new Rauma Municipality. Åndalsnes then became the administrative centre of the new municipality of Rauma. After the German World War II invasion of Norway in April 1940, British troops landed in Åndalsnes as a part of a pincer movement to take the mid-Norwegian city of Trondheim. The northern arm of the attack was based in Namsos. Lacking control of the air, the forces at Åndalsnes were withdrawn in early May 1940. In 1996, the municipal council of Rauma Municipality declared Åndalsnes a town (). ==Media== The newspaper Romsdalsbladet was published in Åndalsnes from 1947 to 1948. == Gallery == File:Åndalsnes.jpgÅndalsnes File:Winter in Åndalsnes.jpgWinter in Åndalsnes File:Aandalsnes fra kjerringplassen.jpgView of the port area and mouth of the river ==See also== *List of towns and cities in Norway ==References== Category:Cities and towns in Norway Category:Populated places in Møre og Romsdal Category:Rauma, Norway Category:Romsdal ","title":"Åndalsnes"},{"id":"1440455","text":" USS Halyburton (FFG-40), an , is a ship of the United States Navy named for Pharmacist's Mate Second Class William D. Halyburton, Jr. (1924-1945). Halyburton was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism while serving with the 5th Marines, during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945. ==Construction== Halyburton was laid down on September 26, 1980 by the Todd Pacific Shipyards Co., Seattle Division, Seattle, Washington; launched on October 13, 1981, sponsored by Mrs. William David Halyburton, Sr., mother of PhM2 Halyburton; and commissioned on January 7, 1984, Commander Robert K.

Halyburton was also one of the escorts for on July 21, 1997 as \\"Old Ironsides\\" celebrated her 200th birthday and her first unassisted sail in 116 years. ===Maersk Alabama incident=== On April 8, 2009, Somalia pirates captured U.S.-flagged motor vessel and her 22 crewmembers, 300 miles from the Somali coast. The crew recaptured their ship along with one of the pirates, but the three surviving pirates held the vessel’s master, Capt. Richard Phillips, hostage on a lifeboat. Halyburton was part of a U.S. Navy rescue mission, along with amphibious assault ship , guided missile destroyer , off the Horn of Africa. A ScanEagle unmanned aircraft system provided timely intelligence during the confrontation. U.S. Navy SEALs, on board Bainbridge, brought the standoff to an end by simultaneously shooting and killing all three pirates in the lifeboat, then being towed by Bainbridge, and rescued Phillips on April 12. The fourth pirate was on board at the time of the shooting, negotiating the hostage's release, and was taken into custody. ===Constable's Dues ritual=== On July 16, 2009, Halyburton visited the Port of London, mooring in South Dock, West India Quay for three nights. On Saturday July 18, she became the first non-British ship to take part in the Tower of London's Constable's Dues ritual. Dating back to the 14th century, the ceremony involved the crew being challenged for entry into the British capital, mirroring an ancient custom in which a ship had to unload some of its cargo for the sovereign to enter the city. Commander Michael P Huck and Ship's Officer, Lieutenant Commander Tony Mortimer led the crew to the Tower's West Gate, where after being challenged for entry by the Yeoman Gaoler armed with his axe, they were marched to Tower Green accompanied by Beefeaters, where they delivered a keg of Castillo Silver Rum, representing the dues, to the Tower's Constable, Sir Roger Wheeler. ===2014=== Halyburton departed her homeport of Naval Station Mayport in January 2014, for her final deployment. She was scheduled to be decommissioned in late 2014. On February 6, 2014, a Panamanian helicopter crashed while working with Halyburton on illicit trafficking operations. The Bell 412 helicopter had nine people aboard, one of whom died in the crash. Halyburton was ceremonially decommissioned on September 6, 2014 at Naval Station Mayport. Halyburton was formally decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register, September 8, 2014. Ex-Halyburton was listed as being berthed at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She may be transferred to the Turkish Navy in 2015.

At age 17 he joined the U.S. Navy to apprentice at sea; he became a midshipman. Naturally inclined toward exploration, he commanded an 1843 (1845 by some sources) exploratory expedition to the interior of Brazil, Province of São Paulo. In 1848 he began an exploration of the peninsula of Lower California; he worked with the U.S. Mexican Boundary Commission. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1850. Lieutenant Strain was a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia; the Historical and Geographical Institute of Brazil; and the American Ethnological Society of New York. In 1849 he explored parts of South America and wrote Cordillera and Pampa, Mountain and Plain: Sketches of a Journey in Chili and The Argentine Provinces in 1849, published in New York in 1853. Leading a United States at peace, and in exercise of Manifest Destiny to expand from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific Ocean, U. S. President Franklin Pierce envisioned an Atlantic to Pacific canal route through the Isthmus of Darién, a region also known as the Darién Gap, located in Colombia, presently Panama. Henceforth, Secretary of the Navy James C. Dobbin in late 1853 ordered Lieutenant Strain to form and lead the United States Navy Darien Exploring Expedition in 1854. Setting forth from the Atlantic side of the Isthmus of Darién, his expedition into the Isthmus of Darién began January 20, 1854. It was in the densely jungled Darién that France and England had sent explorers of their own. The Englishman Gisborne had put pen to perhaps fallacious or inaccurate, but certainly misleading, journals that would lend ambiguity and deaths to Strain's route for traversing the Gap. The Strain party, in part proceeding upon Gisborne's records, wandered circuitously, split, and became plagued by deteriorating equipment, unreliable and often dangerous native guides, malnourishment, foot-soreness, flesh-embedding parasites, and infectious tropical diseases. Six of Strain's party of 27 died by starvation. The courageous but ill-fated expedition nevertheless contributed to future establishments of land routes, a railroad, and the eventual linking of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by a Panama Canal. The canal was completed in 1914, 60 years after Strain's expedition. == Notes == *Commander Matthew Fontaine Maury of the United States Naval Observatory pushed hard for the Darién Expedition of 1854 (as he also did with William Lewis Herndon's exploration of the Valley of the Amazon ) to the Secretary of the Navy. His nephew, s:Darien Exploring Expedition (1854) Lieutenant John Minor Maury USN, (not to be confused with Lieutenant John Minor Maury USN, M. F. Maury's _brother_ who died of malaria while in the U. S. Navy) had been working at the Naval Observatory with his uncle Matthew and was well prepared with both knowledge and equipment. Lieutenant Maury was appointed by Strain as the expedition's 1st assistant-engineer, as well as assistant-astronomer and secretary. Lieutenant Strain later worked on another project for Commander M F Maury, taking depth soundings of the ocean floor of the Atlantic Ocean that were compiled into sea-floor charts. *The U.S. Naval Observatory was also known as the National Observatory. Both terms were used for ten years until an order was finally passed down to use Naval Observatory. This is why many old writings of that time use \\"National Observatory\\", the original name given when President John Quincy Adams signed the bill for its creation. * Middle name (Grier) source: The New York Times Jan.7, 1859 ==References== *s:Darien Exploring Expedition (1854) United States Navy Darien Exploring Expedition of the Isthmus of Panama 1854. https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Darien_Exploring_Expedition_(1854) *Balf, Todd; The Darkest Jungle: The True Story of The Darien Expedition and America's Ill- Fated Race to Connect The Seas, 2003, Crown Publishers, New York, . *Crosby, Hon.

For nine seasons he played in 275 matches and scored 25 goals. Ivankov was a champion of Bulgaria in 2000, 2001 and 2002 and the national cup winner for 1998, 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2005. He joined Turkish club Kayserispor in June 2005. On 7 May 2008 he played a vital role in Kayseri winning the Turkish Cup, saving 3 penalties and scoring two himself. Thus, he became the fourth Bulgarian to win the Turkish Cup. During three seasons with the club Ivankov earned 94 appearances playing in the Süper Lig, and scored six goals. On 9 June 2008 he signed a contract with Bursaspor. He scored a crucial goal against Fenerbahçe in the 95th minute. His goal made the game 2–1 to Bursapor. In 2010, he scored the 42nd senior goal of his career, putting him in third place for the most goals scored by goalkeepers worldwide. He won the Turkish Süper Lig with Bursaspor in 2010. On 23 June 2011, Ivankov signed a contract with Cypriot First Division side Anorthosis Famagusta. The contract with Anorthosis was terminated by mutual agreement on 8 August, after Europa League exit. ==International career== Ivankov earned his first cap with Bulgaria in 1998 and has since earned 64 caps for his country.

He was Australia's 6th last surviving World War I veteran. Smout served in the army as a stretcher bearer. He was notably one of the first on the scene upon the landing of Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron, after he had been shot down and was witness to his final words. He was also the last surviving witness of Richthofen's death. ==Biography== Smout was born in Brisbane, Queensland in 1898. He joined the Australian Army Medical Corps in September 1915 at the age of 17, giving his age as 18 years 8 months. Upon arrival in France, he was posted to the 3rd Sanitary Section of the Australian Army Medical Corps where he served as a stretcher bearer. During an engagement near the Somme River on 21 April 1918, Smout was an eyewitness to the final moments in the life and career of the famous German flying ace Manfred von Richthofen (aka the \\"Red Baron\\"), whose aeroplane had landed nearby after he was fatally shot. Smout reported that Richthofen's last word was \\"kaputt\\" (\\"finished\\") just before he died.Unsolved History: Death of the Red Baron, 2002, Produced by Termite Art Productions for Discovery Channel Smout said later in life that he resisted the temptation to souvenir the Red Baron's boots and Iron Cross. He was discharged on 8 September 1919. He was awarded France's highest honour, being made a Chevalier (Knight) of the Legion d'Honneur in 1998 and also received the Medal of the Order of Australia for service to the community. A regular participant in Anzac Day marches, Smout became one of the most celebrated war veterans in Queensland as one of Australia's last surviving WWI veterans. He died at 106 years old, leaving a widow of 69 years, Ella and son, Dr Westall \\"Westy\\" Smout, himself a WWII \\"Bomber Navigator\\" veteran. According to historical journalist Jonathan King, \\"Ted Smout's legacy is in the hundreds of newspaper articles written about him, the book he wrote Three Centuries Spanned, hours and hours of video footage instructing Australians not to get involved in conflicts like Iraq or Afghanistan.

Thus it is a form of revision control. Most common versioning file systems keep a number of old copies of the file. Some limit the number of changes per minute or per hour to avoid storing large numbers of trivial changes. Others instead take periodic snapshots whose contents can be accessed with similar semantics to normal file access. == Similar technologies == === Backup === A versioning file system is similar to a periodic backup, with several key differences. * Backups are normally triggered on a timed basis, while versioning occurs when the file changes. * Backups are usually system-wide or partition-wide, while versioning occurs independently on a file-by-file basis. * Backups are normally written to separate media, while versioning file systems write to the same hard drive (and normally the same folder, directory, or local partition). === In comparison to revision control systems === Versioning file systems provide some of the features of revision control systems. However, unlike most revision control systems, they are transparent to users, not requiring a separate \\"commit\\" step to record a new revision. === Journaling file system === Versioning file systems should not be confused with journaling file systems. Whereas journaling file systems work by keeping a log of the changes made to a file before committing those changes to that file system (and overwriting the prior version), a versioning file system keeps previous copies of a file when saving new changes. The two features serve different purposes and are not mutually exclusive. === Object Storage === Some Object storage implementations offers object versioning such as Amazon S3. ==Implementations== ===ITS=== An early implementation of versioning, possibly the first, was in MIT's ITS. In ITS, a filename consisted of two six-character parts; if the second part was numeric (consisted only of digits), it was treated as a version number. When specifying a file to open for read or write, one could supply a second part of \\">\\"; when reading, this meant to open the highest-numbered version of the file; when writing, it meant to increment the highest existing version number and create the new version for writing. Another early implementation of versioning was in TENEX, which became TOPS-20.Daniel G. Bobrow, Jerry D. Burchfiel, Daniel L. Murphy, Raymond S. Tomlinson, TENEX, A Paged Time Sharing System for the PDP-10 (Communications of the ACM, Vol. 15, pp. 135-143, March 1972) ===Files-11 (RSX-11 and OpenVMS)=== A powerful example of a file versioning system is built into the RSX-11 and OpenVMS operating system from Digital Equipment Corporation. In essence, whenever an application opens a file for writing, the file system automatically creates a new instance of the file, with a version number appended to the name. Version numbers start at 1 and count upward as new instances of a file are created. When an application opens a file for reading, it can either specify the exact file name including version number, or just the file name without the version number, in which case the most recent instance of the file is opened. The \\"purge\\" DCL/CCL command can be used at any time to manage the number of versions in a specific directory. By default, all but the highest numbered versions of all files in the current directory will be deleted; this behavior can be overridden with the /keep=n switch and/or by specifying directory path(s) and/or filename patterns. VMS systems are often scripted to purge user directories on a regular schedule; this is sometimes misconstrued by end-users as a property of the versioning system. ===Linux=== On February 8, 2004, Kiran-Kumar Muniswamy-Reddy, Charles P. Wright, Andrew Himmer, and Erez Zadok (all from Stony Brook University) proposed an application that was user friendly to many of the users who tested the app. The system was developed with Linux software, so it was first operated on Linux. * NILFS - A log-structured file system supporting versioning of the entire file system and continuous snapshotting. In this list, this is the only one that is stable and included in the mainline kernel. * Tux3 - Most recent change was in 2014. * Next3 - Most recent update was in 2012. * ext3cow - Most recent release was in 2005. ===LMFS=== The Lisp Machine File System supports versioning. This was provided by implementations from MIT, LMI, Symbolics and Texas Instruments. Such an operating system was Symbolics Genera. ===macOS=== Starting with Lion (10.7), macOS has a feature called Versions which allows Time Machine-like saving and browsing of past versions of documents for applications written to use Versions. This functionality, however, takes place at the application layer, not the filesystem layer; Lion and later releases do not incorporate a true versioning file system. ===SCO OpenServer=== HTFS, adopted as the primary filesystem for SCO OpenServer in 1995, supports file versioning. Versioning is enabled on a per-directory basis by setting the directory's setuid bit, which is inherited when subdirectories are created. If versioning is enabled, a new file version is created when a file or directory is removed, or when an existing file is opened with truncation. Non-current versions remain in the filesystem namespace, under the name of the original file but with a suffix attached consisting of a semicolon and version sequence number. All but the current version are hidden from directory reads (unless the SHOWVERSIONS environment variable is set), but versions are otherwise accessible for all normal operations. The environment variable and general accessibility allow versions to be managed with the usual filesystem utilities, though there is also an \\"undelete\\" command that can be used to purge and restore files, enable and disable versioning on directories, etc. === Others === * Subversion has a feature called \\"autoversioning\\" where a WebDAV source with a subversion backend can be mounted as a file system on systems that support this kind of mount (Linux, Windows and others do) and saves to that file system generate new revisions on the revision control system.Version Control with Subversion: Next Generation Open Source Version Control * The commercial Clearcase configuration management and revision control software has also supported \\"MVFS\\" (multi version file system) on HP- UX, AIX and Windows since the early 1990s. === Related software === The following are not versioning filesystems, but allow similar functionality. * ZFS supports Instantaneous snapshots and clones * Btrfs supports snapshots http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/servers-storage-admin/advanced- btrfs-1734952.html Snapshots, Clones, and Seed Devices\\" \\"snapshots\\" sub bullet. * HammerFS in DragonFlyBSD has the ability to store revisions in the filesystem. * NILFS, which supports snapshotting. * Plan 9's Fossil file system can provide a similar feature, taking periodic snapshots (often hourly) and making them available in \`/n/snap\`. Fossil can forever archive a snapshot into Venti (usually one snapshot each day) and make them available in \`/n/dump\`. If multiple changes are made to a file during the interval between snapshots, only the most recent will be recorded in the next snapshot. * Write Anywhere File Layout - NetApp's storage solutions implement a file system called WAFL, which uses snapshot technology to keep different versions of all files in a volume around. * pdumpfs, authored by Satoru Takabayashi, is a simple daily backup system similar to Plan 9's /n/dump, implemented in Ruby. It functions as a snapshotting tool, which makes it possible to copy a whole directory to another location by using hardlinks. Used regularly, this can produce an effect similar to versioning.pDumpFS Homepage *Microsoft Windows ** Shadow Copy - is a feature introduced by Microsoft with Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2012 as well as Windows 7, 8, and 10. Shadow Copy allows for taking manual or automatic backup copies or snapshots of a file or folder on a specific volume at a specific point in time. ** RollBack Rx - Allows snapshots of disk partitions to be taken. Each snapshot contains only the differences between previous snapshots, and take only seconds to create. Can be reliably used to keep a Windows OS stable and/or protected from malware. ** GoBack (discontinued) - The GoBack software for Windows from Symantec enables reversion of files, directories or disks to previous states. It can record a maximum of 8GB in changes, and temporarily stops recording each change in the event of high I/O activity. ** Versomatic - Versomatic software by Acertant automatically tracks file changes and preemptively archives a copy of a file before it is modified. * Cascade File System exposes a Subversion or Perforce repository via a file system driver.

Variations in isotopic abundance are measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry, and can reveal information about the ages and origins of rock, air or water bodies, or processes of mixing between them. Stable isotope geochemistry is largely concerned with isotopic variations arising from mass- dependent isotope fractionation, whereas radiogenic isotope geochemistry is concerned with the products of natural radioactivity. ==Stable isotope geochemistry== For most stable isotopes, the magnitude of fractionation from kinetic and equilibrium fractionation is very small; for this reason, enrichments are typically reported in \\"per mil\\" (‰, parts per thousand). These enrichments (δ) represent the ratio of heavy isotope to light isotope in the sample over the ratio of a standard. That is, :\\\\delta \\\\ce{^{13}C} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\ce{^{13}C}}{\\\\ce{^{12}C}} \\\\right)_{sample}}{\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\ce{^{13}C}}{\\\\ce{^{12}C}}\\\\right)_{standard}} -1 \\\\right) \\\\times 1000 ‰ ===Hydrogen=== Hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry ===Carbon=== Carbon has two stable isotopes, 12C and 13C, and one radioactive isotope, 14C. The stable carbon isotope ratio, δ13C, is measured against Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB). The stable carbon isotopes are fractionated primarily by photosynthesis (Faure, 2004). The 13C/12C ratio is also an indicator of paleoclimate: a change in the ratio in the remains of plants indicates a change in the amount of photosynthetic activity, and thus in how favorable the environment was for the plants. During photosynthesis, organisms using the C3 pathway show different enrichments compared to those using the C4 pathway, allowing scientists not only to distinguish organic matter from abiotic carbon, but also what type of photosynthetic pathway the organic matter was using. Occasional spikes in the global 13C/12C ratio have also been useful as stratigraphic markers for chemostratigraphy, especially during the Paleozoic. The 14C ratio has been used to track ocean circulation, among other things. ===Nitrogen=== Nitrogen has two stable isotopes, 14N and 15N. The ratio between these is measured relative to nitrogen in ambient air. Nitrogen ratios are frequently linked to agricultural activities. Nitrogen isotope data has also been used to measure the amount of exchange of air between the stratosphere and troposphere using data from the greenhouse gas N2O. ===Oxygen=== Oxygen has three stable isotopes, 16O, 17O, and 18O. Oxygen ratios are measured relative to Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) or Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB). Variations in oxygen isotope ratios are used to track both water movement, paleoclimate, and atmospheric gases such as ozone and carbon dioxide. Typically, the VPDB oxygen reference is used for paleoclimate, while VSMOW is used for most other applications. Oxygen isotopes appear in anomalous ratios in atmospheric ozone, resulting from mass- independent fractionation. Isotope ratios in fossilized foraminifera have been used to deduce the temperature of ancient seas. ===Sulfur=== Sulfur has four stable isotopes, with the following abundances: 32S (0.9502), 33S (0.0075), 34S (0.0421) and 36S (0.0002). These abundances are compared to those found in Cañon Diablo troilite. Variations in sulfur isotope ratios are used to study the origin of sulfur in an orebody and the temperature of formation of sulfur- bearing minerals.Rollinson, H.R. (1993). Using Geochemical Data: Evaluation, Presentation, Interpretation Longman Scientific & Technical. ==Radiogenic isotope geochemistry== Radiogenic isotopes provide powerful tracers for studying the ages and origins of Earth systems. They are particularly useful to understand mixing processes between different components, because (heavy) radiogenic isotope ratios are not usually fractionated by chemical processes. Radiogenic isotope tracers are most powerful when used together with other tracers: The more tracers used, the more control on mixing processes. An example of this application is to the evolution of the Earth's crust and Earth's mantle through geological time. ===Lead–lead isotope geochemistry=== Lead has four stable isotopes: 204Pb, 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb. Lead is created in the Earth via decay of actinide elements, primarily uranium and thorium. Lead isotope geochemistry is useful for providing isotopic dates on a variety of materials. Because the lead isotopes are created by decay of different transuranic elements, the ratios of the four lead isotopes to one another can be very useful in tracking the source of melts in igneous rocks, the source of sediments and even the origin of people via isotopic fingerprinting of their teeth, skin and bones. It has been used to date ice cores from the Arctic shelf, and provides information on the source of atmospheric lead pollution. Lead–lead isotopes has been successfully used in forensic science to fingerprint bullets, because each batch of ammunition has its own peculiar 204Pb/206Pb vs 207Pb/208Pb ratio. ===Samarium–neodymium=== Samarium–neodymium is an isotope system which can be utilised to provide a date as well as isotopic fingerprints of geological materials, and various other materials including archaeological finds (pots, ceramics). 147Sm decays to produce 143Nd with a half life of 1.06x1011 years. Dating is achieved usually by trying to produce an isochron of several minerals within a rock specimen. The initial 143Nd/144Nd ratio is determined. This initial ratio is modelled relative to CHUR - the Chondritic Uniform Reservoir - which is an approximation of the chondritic material which formed the solar system. CHUR was determined by analysing chondrite and achondrite meteorites. The difference in the ratio of the sample relative to CHUR can give information on a model age of extraction from the mantle (for which an assumed evolution has been calculated relative to CHUR) and to whether this was extracted from a granitic source (depleted in radiogenic Nd), the mantle, or an enriched source. ===Rhenium–osmium=== Rhenium and osmium are siderophile elements which are present at very low abundances in the crust. Rhenium undergoes radioactive decay to produce osmium. The ratio of non-radiogenic osmium to radiogenic osmium throughout time varies. Rhenium prefers to enter sulfides more readily than osmium. Hence, during melting of the mantle, rhenium is stripped out, and prevents the osmium–osmium ratio from changing appreciably. This locks in an initial osmium ratio of the sample at the time of the melting event. Osmium–osmium initial ratios are used to determine the source characteristic and age of mantle melting events. ==Noble gas isotopes== Natural isotopic variations amongst the noble gases result from both radiogenic and nucleogenic production processes. Because of their unique properties, it is useful to distinguish them from the conventional radiogenic isotope systems described above. ===Helium-3=== Helium-3 was trapped in the planet when it formed. Some 3He is being added by meteoric dust, primarily collecting on the bottom of oceans (although due to subduction, all oceanic tectonic plates are younger than continental plates). However, 3He will be degassed from oceanic sediment during subduction, so cosmogenic 3He is not affecting the concentration or noble gas ratios of the mantle. Helium-3 is created by cosmic ray bombardment, and by lithium spallation reactions which generally occur in the crust. Lithium spallation is the process by which a high-energy neutron bombards a lithium atom, creating a 3He and a 4He ion. This requires significant lithium to adversely affect the 3He/4He ratio. All degassed helium is lost to space eventually, due to the average speed of helium exceeding the escape velocity for the Earth. Thus, it is assumed the helium content and ratios of Earth's atmosphere have remained essentially stable. It has been observed that 3He is present in volcano emissions and oceanic ridge samples. How 3He is stored in the planet is under investigation, but it is associated with the mantle and is used as a marker of material of deep origin. Due to similarities in helium and carbon in magma chemistry, outgassing of helium requires the loss of volatile components (water, carbon dioxide) from the mantle, which happens at depths of less than 60 km. However, 3He is transported to the surface primarily trapped in the crystal lattice of minerals within fluid inclusions. Helium-4 is created by radiogenic production (by decay of uranium/thorium-series elements). The continental crust has become enriched with those elements relative to the mantle and thus more He4 is produced in the crust than in the mantle. The ratio (R) of 3He to 4He is often used to represent 3He content. R usually is given as a multiple of the present atmospheric ratio (Ra). Common values for R/Ra: * Old continental crust: less than 1 * mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB): 7 to 9 * Spreading ridge rocks: 9.1 plus or minus 3.6 * Hotspot rocks: 5 to 42 * Ocean and terrestrial water: 1 * Sedimentary formation water: less than 1 * Thermal spring water: 3 to 11 3He/4He isotope chemistry is being used to date groundwaters, estimate groundwater flow rates, track water pollution, and provide insights into hydrothermal processes, igneous geology and ore genesis. * (U-Th)/He dating of apatite as a thermal history tool * USGS: Helium Discharge at Mammoth Mountain Fumarole (MMF) ==Isotopes in actinide decay chains== Isotopes in the decay chains of actinides are unique amongst radiogenic isotopes because they are both radiogenic and radioactive. Because their abundances are normally quoted as activity ratios rather than atomic ratios, they are best considered separately from the other radiogenic isotope systems. ===Protactinium/Thorium – 231Pa / 230Th=== Uranium is well mixed in the ocean, and its decay produces 231Pa and 230Th at a constant activity ratio (0.093). The decay products are rapidly removed by adsorption on settling particles, but not at equal rates. 231Pa has a residence equivalent to the residence time of deep water in the Atlantic basin (around 1000 yrs) but 230Th is removed more rapidly (centuries). Thermohaline circulation effectively exports 231Pa from the Atlantic into the Southern Ocean, while most of the 230Th remains in Atlantic sediments. As a result, there is a relationship between 231Pa/230Th in Atlantic sediments and the rate of overturning: faster overturning produces lower sediment 231Pa/230Th ratio, while slower overturning increases this ratio. The combination of δ13C and 231Pa/230Th can therefore provide a more complete insight into past circulation changes. ==Anthropogenic isotopes== ===Tritium/helium-3=== Tritium was released to the atmosphere during atmospheric testing of nuclear bombs. Radioactive decay of tritium produces the noble gas helium-3. Comparing the ratio of tritium to helium-3 (3H/3He) allows estimation of the age of recent ground waters. * USGS Tritium/Helium-3 Dating * Hydrologic Isotope Tracers - Helium ==See also== * Cosmogenic isotopes * Environmental isotopes * Geochemistry * Isotopic signature * Radiometric dating * Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry *Sulfur isotope biogeochemistry ==Notes== ==References== ===General=== *Allègre C.J., 2008.

The broad summit region contains overlapping craters up to wide along with several lava domes. Several flank vents occur along a northwest trending fissure. __NOTOC__ == Eruption history == Eruptions with a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 3 have occurred in 1650 ± 50, 1928 and 1972. On 16 January 2005, there were signs of a possible eruption, causing the mountain to be placed under alert status. ===1928=== The biggest eruption (VEI 3) occurred on August 4, – September 25, 1928, the eruption caused a tsunami and earthquake. The population of Palu'e island was 266 people at that period. ===2012–2013=== In late 2012 the mountain became quite active, spewing volcanic ash. In November 2012, and continuing into 2013, a 3 km exclusion zone was set up and residents living around the mountain were evacuated or moved to Maumere city on the main island of Flores. In the first 8 months of 2013 there was regular activity from the lava dome including repeated ash plumes – generally reaching altitudes of 2–3 km – dome collapses, explosions, avalanches and pyroclastic flows. August 2013 On 10 August 2013, the mountain erupted for about seven minutes and spewed ash about into the air. Initial reports had the death toll at six. The victims were three adults and two children, and the age of the sixth victim is unclear. The bodies of the adults were recovered from Ponge beach in Rokirole village, but the remains of the children were not found. A number of the island residents refused to leave the island after an earlier mandatory evacuation order had been issued; they had grown accustomed to the volcanic activity. == References == == External links== *Paluweh *Landsat Thermal Sensor Lights Up from Volcano's Heat Category:Active volcanoes of Indonesia Category:Stratovolcanoes of Indonesia Category:Volcanoes of the Lesser Sunda Islands Category:Mountains of Indonesia ","title":"Paluweh"},{"id":"1440528","text":"Jimmy may refer to: ==Arts and entertainment== ===Film and television=== * Jimmy (2008 film), 2008 Hindi thriller directed by Raj N.

This barrier between 'fact' and 'value' implies it is impossible to derive ethical claims from factual arguments, or to defend the former using the latter.Prior, AN (1960). The Autonomy of Ethics, Australasian Journal of Philosophy, 38(3): 199–206. The fact–value distinction is closely related to, and derived from, the is–ought problem in moral philosophy, characterized by David Hume (1711–1776). The terms are often used interchangeably, though philosophical discourse concerning the is–ought problem does not usually encompass aesthetics. ==David Hume's skepticism== In 'A Treatise of Human Nature' (1739), David Hume discusses the problems in grounding normative statements in positive statements, that is, in deriving ought from is. It is generally regarded that Hume considered such derivations untenable, and his 'is–ought' problem is considered a principal question of moral philosophy. Hume shared a political viewpoint with early Enlightenment philosophers such as Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) and John Locke (1632–1704). Specifically, Hume, at least to some extent, argued that religious and national hostilities that divided European society were based on unfounded beliefs. In effect, Hume contended that such hostilities are not found in nature, but are a human creation, depending on a particular time and place, and thus unworthy of mortal conflict. Prior to Hume, Aristotelian philosophy maintained that all actions and causes were to be interpreted teleologically. This rendered all facts about human action examinable under a normative framework defined by cardinal virtues and capital vices. \\"Fact\\" in this sense was not value-free, and the fact-value distinction was an alien concept. The decline of Aristotelianism in the 16th century set the framework in which those theories of knowledge could be revised. ==Naturalistic fallacy== The fact–value distinction is closely related to the naturalistic fallacy, a topic debated in ethical and moral philosophy. G. E. Moore believed it essential to all ethical thinking.Casimir Lewy 1965 - G.E. Moore on the naturalistic fallacy However, contemporary philosophers like Phillipa Foot have called into question the validity of such assumptions. Others, such as Ruth Anna Putnam, argue that even the most \\"scientific\\" of disciplines are affected by the \\"values\\" of those who research and practice the vocation.Putnam, Ruth Anna. \\"Perceiving Facts and Values\\", Philosophy 73, 1998. This article as well as her earlier article, \\"Creating Facts and Values\\", Philosophy 60, 1985 , examines how scientists may base their choice of investigations on their unexamined subjectivity, which undermines the objectivity of their hypothesis and findingsSmart, J.C. \\"Ruth Anna Putnam and the Fact-Value Distinction\\", Philosophy 74, 1999. Nevertheless, the difference between the naturalistic fallacy and the fact–value distinction is derived from the manner in which modern social science has used the fact–value distinction, and not the strict naturalistic fallacy to articulate new fields of study and create academic disciplines. ==Moralistic fallacy== The fact–value distinction is also closely related to the moralistic fallacy, an invalid inference of factual conclusions from purely evaluative premises. For example, an invalid inference \\"Because everybody ought to be equal, there are no innate genetic differences between people\\" is an instance of the moralistic fallacy. As for the naturalistic fallacy one attempts to move from an \\"is\\" to an \\"ought\\" statement, with the moralistic fallacy one attempts to move from an \\"ought\\" to an \\"is\\" statement. ==Nietzsche's table of values== Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) in Thus Spoke Zarathustra said that a table of values hangs above every great people. Nietzsche points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of esteeming, of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to act on those values.Nietzsche, Friedrich. Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Book Two \\"On the Virtuous\\": \\"You who are virtuous still want to be paid! Do you want rewards for virtue, and heaven for earth, and the eternal for your today? And now you are angry with me because I teach that there is no reward and paymaster? And verily, I do not even teach that virtue is its own reward.\\" The willing is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche.Nietzsche, Friedrich. Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Book Four \\"On Old and New Tablets\\": \\"To redeem what is past in man and to recreate all 'it was' until the will says, 'Thus I willed it! Thus I shall will it!' - this I called redemption and this alone I taught them to call redemption.\\" \\"A thousand goals have there been so far,\\" says Zarathustra, \\"for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal.\\" Hence, the title of the aphorism, \\"On The Thousand And One Goals.\\" The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. Max Weber and Martin Heidegger absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical endeavor, as well as their political understanding. ==Criticisms== Virtually all modern philosophers affirm some sort of fact–value distinction, insofar as they distinguish between science and \\"valued\\" disciplines such as ethics, aesthetics, or the fine arts. However, philosophers such as Hilary Putnam argue that the distinction between fact and value is not as absolute as Hume envisioned. Philosophical pragmatists, for instance, believe that true propositions are those that are useful or effective in predicting future (empirical) states of affairs. Far from being value-free, the pragmatists' conception of truth or facts directly relates to an end (namely, empirical predictability) that human beings regard as normatively desirable. Other thinkers, such as N. Hanson among others, talk of theory-ladenness, and reject an absolutist fact–value distinction by contending that our senses are imbued with prior conceptualizations, making it impossible to have any observation that is totally value-free, which is how Hume and the later positivists conceived of facts. === Functionalist counterexamples === Several counterexamples have been offered by philosophers claiming to show that there are cases when an evaluative statement does indeed logically follow from a factual statement. A. N. Prior points out, from the statement \\"He is a sea captain,\\" it logically follows, \\"He ought to do what a sea captain ought to do.\\"Alasdair MacIntyre, After Virtue (1984), p. 57 Alasdair MacIntyre points out, from the statement \\"This watch is grossly inaccurate and irregular in time-keeping and too heavy to carry about comfortably,\\" the evaluative conclusion validly follows, \\"This is a bad watch.\\"ibid., p. 68. John Searle points out, from the statement \\"Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars,\\" it logically follows that \\"Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars.\\" The act of promising by definition places the promiser under obligation.Don MacNiven, Creative Morality, pp. 41–42. === Moral realism === Philippa Foot adopts a moral realist position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a \\"committal in a new dimension\\".Philippa Foot, “Moral Beliefs,” Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, vol. 59 (1958), pp. 83–104. She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word \\"injury\\". Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old naturalist fallacy? Foot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness. ==See also== * Baden School * Empiricism * Is–ought problem * Non-overlapping magisteria * Relativism ==References== ==Bibliography== * Hume, David.

Throughout his career, Bojinov has played for sixteen different clubs during his various spells in Italy, as well as in England, Portugal, Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, China and Switzerland. At international level, he also played for the Bulgarian national team. His surname is sometimes transliterated as Bozhinov. ==Biography== Born in Gorna Oryahovitsa, Bulgaria, Bojinov moved to Malta at the age of 12 with his mother Pepa, a former Bulgaria women's national football team player, and stepfather Sasho Angelov, who had played for the Bulgarian national football team during the 1990s. Bojinov was discovered at the age of 14 by Lecce sports director Pantaleo Corvino while playing for Pietà Hotspurs, and signed for just 30,000,000 ITL (around €15,000). ==Club career== ===Lecce=== Bojinov settled in the city of Lecce and continued his studies there while playing for Lecce's youth teams. He debuted in the Italian Serie A on 22 January 2002 at the age of 15 years and 11 months, becoming the youngest foreign player to make an appearance at the top level of Italian football. He scored his first goal in the top division on 6 January 2004 in a 1–2 home defeat against Bologna, becoming the youngest non-national to score in Serie A. ===Fiorentina=== Bojinov was acquired by Fiorentina in January 2005.Football Italia – Player of the Week: Born-again Bojinov He made his club debut against Palermo, playing the full match on 2 February 2005.Fiorentina - Palermo On 26 February 2005, he scored his first goal for Fiorentina, against Udinese.Fiorentina - Udinese Calcio On 8 May 2005, Bojinov scored a winning goal in 79th minute against Chievo at Stadio Marc'Antonio Bentegodi in 1–2 away win.Chievo - Fiorentina During the 2004–05 season, Bojinov has played a total of nine matches, scoring two goals. ===Juventus=== For the 2006–07 season, Fiorentina loaned Bojinov to Juventus, which had just been relegated to Serie B. ===Manchester City=== On 3 August 2007, it was reported that Bojinov had completed his move to English Premier League club Manchester City, signing a four-year contract in an undisclosed fee deal. On 11 August 2007, he made his debut for the club in a 0–2 away win against West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground, entering as a substitute for Rolando Bianchi in the 60th minute in league play. Bojinov was ruled out of action for five months after he suffered a knee ligament injury against Manchester United in August 2007. He returned to full training on 22 January 2008, scoring five goals in a bounce game. On 11 February 2008, Bojinov played in a Manchester City reserve game, where he came on as a substitute and scored a header from a cross by Émile Mpenza. Manchester City manager Sven-Göran Eriksson told Bojinov that he would not be ready to play in the game against Everton on 25 February 2008. He did not manage to make a comeback to the first-team squad in the 2007–08 season, but he did make some appearances for the reserve squad and was included in City's tour of Asia. Bojinov scored his first goal for the club in over a year in a pre-season friendly against Stockport County. He also scored the winning goal in a friendly against Milan on 9 August 2008. On 17 August 2008, Bojinov was ruled out for six months after suffering an Achilles injury as he was running on to the pitch to warm up against Aston Villa. In mid-February 2009, Manchester City manager Mark Hughes declared that Bojinov was going to play a practice match \\"behind closed doors\\", as he was nearing his return to first- team football. He played 65 minutes for the reserves on 17 February 2009. He even scored a penalty against rivals Manchester United in a reserve game while regaining match fitness. Bojinov made his return to Premier League football by coming on as an 89th-minute substitute against West Ham on 1 March 2009. He then appeared again as a late substitute for Manchester City by entering as an 83rd-minute substitute for Elano against Aston Villa. Bojinov made his first start since 2007 in a 1–0 home win over Sunderland on 22 March 2009, but was substituted in the 65th minute for the return of injured Craig Bellamy. He scored his first league goal in the 2–1 loss against Tottenham Hotspur on 16 May 2009, four minutes after coming on as a substitute for compatriot Martin Petrov in the 61st minute away at White Hart Lane. ===Parma=== It was announced on 29 July 2009 that Bojinov would be joining Italian side Parma on a season-long loan deal. He decided to wear number 86. On 23 September 2009 he scored his first official goal for Parma against Lazio at Stadio Olimpico. He also won a penalty for his team; the match ended in a 1–2 away win. On 24 March 2010, Bojinov scored against Milan in 90th minute in 1–0 home win. During the 2009–10 season, Bojinov played 31 matches in all competitions, scoring eight goals. On 4 July 2010, it was confirmed that Parma had completed the permanent signing of Bojinov. However, Bojinov endured a difficult season, largely restricted to the bench thanks to a combination of his own sub-par performances; the regular use of just one forward in the team; and regular goals coming from Hernán Crespo and Amauri in the early and late parts of the season, respectively. ===Sporting CP=== On 6 July 2011, Portuguese side Sporting CP signed Bojinov on a five-year contract, paying €2.6million for 80% of his registration rights, which could have risen to €3.5 million depending on his performances. His transfer to Sporting saw Chilean midfielder Jaime Valdés move on loan to Parma as part of the exchange. During his time with the Lisbon outfit, he was primarily used by coach Domingos Paciência as a substitute. He made his first-team debut on 25 August against Danish side Nordsjælland in a UEFA Europa League play-off tie. He would score for Sporting for the first time on 24 October against Gil Vicente. A brace against the Barcelos side saw Bojinov help his side demolish the opposition 6–1 in a gameweek eight Primeira Liga fixture. On 20 January 2012, Sporting declared Bojinov persona non-grata, forbidding the player from entering the stadium or the training academy, due to his actions in a Taça da Liga match against Moreirense played the previous day. At 92 minutes, Sporting was conceded a decisive penalty kick that would, if scored, give the team the victory. The regular penalty taker for Sporting, Matías Fernández, prepared to take the shot, but Bojinov took the ball from him, pushing him away and insisting that he would take the shot, despite him having never taken a penalty for Sporting, nor that he had not scored a penalty in an official game since 2006. He failed to score, infuriating the supporters and Sporting's managers, who subsequently banned Bojinov on the basis that he disrespected the decision of the coach and therefore the rules of the club. He then joined his former club Lecce on a loan deal. Loan spells to Verona and Vicenza On 31 August 2012, it was announced that Bojinov became an official Verona player, joining on a year- long loan deal. On 17 January 2013, however, he signed with second-division side Vicenza on a separate six-month loan deal. He scored his first goal in his second game for Vicenza against Juve Stabia on 2 February. Bojinov would score again on 26 February, a brace against Grosseto in a 2–1 away win. On 6 September 2013 the contract between Bojinov and Sporting was terminated. ===Levski Sofia=== On the last day of January 2014, it was confirmed that Bojinov had signed with Bulgarian side Levski Sofia, the first time in his career he would play for a club in his home country. He scored a goal on his unofficial debut on 7 February in a 2–4 loss in a friendly match against Czech side Teplice. Bojinov netted his first goal in an official match on 12 March in a 3–1 win over Botev Plovdiv in a Bulgarian Cup game. On 11 May 2014, Bojinov scored two goals in the 2–3 home loss against champions Ludogorets Razgrad. ===Ternana=== In September 2014, Bojinov cancelled his contract with Levski and joined Italian Serie B side Ternana as a free agent on a one-year contract. He made his debut against Bologna on 23 September, playing the full 90 minutes. On 4 November, against Virtus Entella at the Stadio Comunale, Bojinov scored his first goal for Ternana with a 49th-minute equaliser in a 2–1 loss. On 17 January 2015, Bojinov scored a brace in 2–1 home win over Crotone; the second goal was a fantastic 40-meter strike. ===Partizan=== On 14 June 2015, Bojinov signed a two-year contract with Serbian team Partizan. Former Partizan player and Bulgarian international Ivan Ivanov recommended Partizan to Bojinov. Bojinov took number 86 on the jersey and said that it was his lucky number and chose to wear it on the jersey. He made his official debut for the club in a second qualifying round UEFA Champions League against Dila Gori on 14 July 2015. In the match, he spent 77 minutes on the field without scoring. On 17 July 2015, against Metalac, Bojinov scored his first goal for Partizan. In that match, he scored one goal and had two assists in a 4–0 home win. On 25 July 2015, Bojinov scored twice against Jagodina in a 6–0 home win. On 22 October 2015, Bojinov was in the starting XI against Athletic Bilbao in his first time 2015–16 UEFA Europa League group stage. On 13 December 2015, Bojinov entered the game as a substitute for Ivan Šaponjić in the 59th minute and scored a brace against Rad. In the winter of 2016, Partizan declined separate €2 million offers from both Sporting de Gijón and Rayo Vallecano for Bojinov. In January 2016, during an interview, he promised to any teammate who would assist one of his goals that he would give them €500. On 17 February 2017, he terminated his contract with Partizan by mutual consent. ===Meizhou Hakka=== In March 2017 he signed with Chinese second level club Meizhou Hakka. ===Lausanne=== In July 2017, Bojinov signed a two-year contract with Swiss side Lausanne; however, in October, he cancelled his contract with the club. ===Rijeka=== In February 2018, Bojinov signed for Rijeka in Croatia as a free agent. He was initially signed until June 2018 with an extension option. He made his official debut for the club in the semi- final of the 2017–18 Croatian Football Cup against Dinamo Zagreb on 4 April 2018, coming on as a substitute in the 78th minute. In his league debut against Inter Zaprešić on 8 May 2018, Bojinov came on as a substitute in the 76th minute and within three minutes on the field made an assist for Rijeka's fifth goal. On 5 June 2018, Bojinov's contract was extended for another season. On 20 August 2018, HNK Rijeka and Bojinov mutually agreed to terminate his contract with the club. ===Return to Bulgaria=== Bojinov played for Levski Sofia during the spring of 2019, scoring the decisive playoff goal against Etar that helped the team qualify for the UEFA Europa League. His time at the \\"bluemen\\" was sandwiched between two spells with Botev Vratsa - one in the second half of 2018, during which he established himself as an important player for the club, and a short, disappointing stint in the autumn of 2019. ===Pescara=== In February 2020, Bojinov joined Serie B club Pescara. On 23 February 2020, he was sent off before being able to make his debut (while sitting on the substitutes' bench against Crotone) by the match referee for insulting language. He appeared for the first time in an official match on 4 March, after coming on as a second half substitute in the 0–2 away loss against Spezia. ===Third spell at Levski Sofia=== In September 2020, Bojinov rejoined Levski Sofia for the third time in his career. ==International career== Bojinov (right) playing for Bulgaria in November 2010 Bojinov made his debut for Bulgaria at UEFA Euro 2004; on 22 June 2004, he came on as a substitute in the 1–2 loss against Italy. He earned his second cap on 19 August 2004 in the 1–1 away draw against the Republic of Ireland in a friendly match during which he also scored his first international goal. On 17 November 2005, Bojinov scored a goal against Mexico in a friendly match in the United States at NRG Stadium, contributing to a 3–0 win. On 6 September 2006, Bojinov scored his first international goal in a competition match, against Slovenia, in 3–0 home win in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying. It was also Bulgaria's first goal in the Euro 2008 qualifying. ==Style of play== Once considered to be a highly promising prospect in his youth, Bojinov is known for his skill and goalscoring abilities as a striker, and is capable of scoring with either foot, due to his powerful and accurate striking ability, which also enabled him to play alongside another forward as a second striker, or as winger on either flank, as well as in the centre of the pitch; a fast footballer in his prime, he was also known for his speed over short distances, agility, and explosive acceleration, as well as his quick feet, and close control in limited spaces. In spite of his talent, however, he has also garnered a reputation throughout his career for being inconsistent. ==Personal life== Bojinov dated Bulgarian singer Alisia. On 12 September 2007, he became father of a baby son. His son is also named Valeri. He was married to Bulgarian Playboy Playmate from 2011 to 2015.","title":"Valeri Bojinov"},{"id":"1440558","text":"Business area in Tallinn New city center of Vilnius Baltic Tiger is a term used to refer to any of the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania during their periods of economic boom, which started after the year 2000 and continued until 2006–2007. The term is modeled on Four Asian Tigers, Tatra Tiger, and Celtic Tiger, which were used to describe the economic boom periods in parts of Asia, Slovakia, and Ireland, respectively. ==Overview== Economically, parallel with the political changes, and the democratic transition, – as a rule of law states – the previous command economies were transformed via the legislation into market economies, and set up or renewed the major macroeconomic factors: budgetary rules, national audit, national currency, central bank Generally, they shortly encountered the following problems: high inflation, high unemployment, low economic growth and high government debt. The inflation rate, in the examined area, relatively quickly dropped to below 5% by 2000. Meanwhile, these economies were stabilized, and sooner or later between 2004 and 2013 all of them joined the European Union. New macroeconomic requirements have arisen for them; the Maastricht criteria became obligatory. Later the Stability and Growth Pact set stricter rules through national legislation by implementing e g the regulations and directives of the Sixpack, because the financial crisis was a shocking milestone. After 2000, the Baltic Tiger economies implemented important economic reforms and liberalisation, which, coupled with their fairly low-wage and skilled labour force, attracted large amounts of foreign investment and economic growth. Between 2000 and 2007, the Baltic Tiger states had the highest growth rates in Europe. In 2006, for example, Estonia grew by 10.3% in gross domestic product, while Latvia grew by 11.9% and Lithuania by 7.5%. All three countries by February 2006 saw their rates of unemployment falling below average EU values. Additionally, Estonia is among the ten most liberal economies in the world and in 2006 switched from being classified as an upper- middle income economy to a high-income economy by the World Bank. All three countries joined the European Union in May 2004. Estonia adopted the Euro in January 2011, Latvia in 2014 and Lithuania entered the Eurozone in 2015. In 2008, the global financial crisis triggered the collapse of the Baltic property markets, causing some of the most severe recessions in Europe. In 2008, Latvia's GDP shrank by −4.6% and Estonia's −3.6% while Lithuania's slowed to 3.0%. As the crisis swept across Eastern and Central Europe the economic reversal intensified: Estonia's GDP dropped by -16.2% year-on-year, Latvia's by −19.6% and Lithuania's by −16.8%. By mid-2009, all three countries experienced one of the deepest recessions in the world. In 2010 the economic situation in the Baltic states stabilized and in 2011 the Baltic states experienced the fastest recoveries in the European Union, after having lost a substantial part of their populations through emigration, particularly Lithuania. Estonia's GDP grew by 8.3% in 2011, Lithuania's GDP grew by 5.9% and Latvia's GDP by 5.5%.

It is an auxiliary route of parent I-69 that also carries portions of US Highway 24 (US 24), US 30, and US 33 around the urban parts of Fort Wayne. It is in length. The Interstate was originally conceived as a bypass for US 24 around the south and east ends of Fort Wayne. Due to heavy traffic on US 30 through the city, support was gained to connect the bypass to I-69 on the city's north end. I-469 was given the name Ronald Reagan Expressway in 2005. I-469 was the most expensive civic project in the history of Allen County, costing over $207 million. As a bypass route, I-469 has been ineffective at helping with north–south traffic along I-69. However, the route has served effectively as an east–west bypass around the city, removing heavy truck traffic from passing through Fort Wayne. ==Route description== I-469 at its southern terminus with I-69 I-469 begins at I-69 exit 296 and Lafayette Center Road in southwestern Allen County. The freeway heads east as a four-lane freeway, running concurrently with US 33\\\\. The highway begins to turn southeast, passing through farmland. The route has a diamond interchange at Lafayette Center Road East and at Indianapolis Road, before turning due east and passing just south of Fort Wayne International Airport. The next interchange is at the northern terminus of the southern section of State Road 1 (SR 1) and serves the airport via Bluffton Road. After curving northeasterly, I-469 has an interchange with Winchester Road and another with US 27\\\\. At the interchange with US 27, US 33 leaves I-469 heading south concurrently with US 27. The freeway then curves northeasterly, with interchanges at Marion Center Road and Tillman Road. Then, I-469 passes southeast of New Haven, with an interchange at Minnich Road. After the Minnich Road exit, the road begins to curve due north along the east side of New Haven. The freeway has an interchange with US 30/SR 930, at SR 930's eastern terminus; US 30 begins running concurrently with I-469. After the interchange at US 30 is a bridge over Norfolk Southern railroad tracks and an interchange with US 24\\\\. This is the eastern end of the concurrency with US 24. I-469 proceeds north, concurrent with both US 24 and US 30\\\\. The freeway crosses the Maumee River and begins to curve to the northwest, entering commercial areas. The next interchange is with the southern terminus of the northern section of SR 37, after which the route enters residential areas with a small amount of farmland. The highway then curves further west to an interchange at Maplecrest Road. At I-469's northern terminus, it has an interchange with I-69; US 24 and US 30 continue to the south along I-69. === Traffic flow === I-469 is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT). As of 2017, I-469's annual average daily traffic was 46,161 vehicles per day between Maplecrest Road and I-469's northern terminus, 34,651 near its interchange with US 30, 14,821 near its interchange with Marion Center Road, and 22,142 between the highway's southern terminus and its interchange with Lafayette Center Road East. By comparison, in 2017 I-69 saw over 60,000 vehicles per day in a majority of sections between the termini of I-469. A 2007 traffic count along I-469 found that only one section of the highway, between Maplecrest Road and I-469's northern terminus, saw traffic numbers close to anywhere along I-69's route around the city, while other sections are much more lightly traveled. John Stafford, who formerly worked for Allen County Plan Commission during planning for I-469, stated in 2008 that the highway was relatively new and would eventually spur growth. Since its construction, I-469 has been ineffective as a north–south bypass around Fort Wayne, in part because its length is longer than I-69's route around the city. However, officials have stated that heavy truck traffic along Coliseum Boulevard has almost entirely disappeared, and some have stated that I-469 functions better as an east-west bypass around Fort Wayne. ==History== I-469 West near mile marker 8 In the 1950s, Coliseum Boulevard was built as a \\"circumurban\\" highway, and US 30 was rerouted onto it to bypass the downtown area of Fort Wayne. I-69 was constructed in the 1960s around the west side of the city; its first section opened in October 1962. In 1970, Eli Samaan created a transportation plan for Fort Wayne, including north–south and east–west expressways through the city, along with a route along the city's south and east edges. Fort Wayne mayor Ivan Lebamoff supported the east–west expressway, and the route was approved by the state. However, the estimated $110 million needed for the project could not be allocated, so the project was scrapped. When the state began looking for a solution to traffic issues on US 24 through Fort Wayne, plans for a bypass began. In large part due to heavy traffic on Coliseum Boulevard, which became known for its commercial properties and issues with bottlenecks, the idea gained support. The original plans for the bypass were to connect I-69 to US 24 east of Fort Wayne. By 1981, these plans were expanded to connect to I-69 on the city's north side. Samaan stated that he had to convince Governor Otis Bowen in 1978 to expedite construction of the bypass. An additional factor appeared as contracts for the project were being awarded, when General Motors announced construction of an automotive plant in 1984 on Lafayette Center Road, where the bypass was planned to interchange with I-69. According to Samaan, this helped to accelerate construction when the state decided it would be beneficial to the new employer in the area, stating \\"I never have seen anything move that fast in my whole life.\\" Construction began in 1988, with the first section built between I-69 and Lafayette Center Road. In June 1989, the US 24 bypass received the I-469 designation. A temporary halt to construction occurred in 1991 when crews unearthed a lock that was once used in the Wabash and Erie Canal while constructing the interchange with US 24 east of New Haven. Upon the highway's completion in 1995, its construction was the most expensive in Allen County's history, with a cost of $207 million. In 1998, US 24 and US 30 were rerouted onto I-69 and I-469. In 2005, I-469 was given the name Ronald Reagan Expressway, in honor of the former United States president. ==Future== In early 2019, INDOT began construction on a project to reconfigure the interchange with US 24 in New Haven. With the completion of the Fort-to-Port project in 2012, US 24 is now a freeway from I-469 to the Ohio state line, except for the folded diamond interchange at I-469 that has traffic lights at the ramp terminals. The reconstructed I-469/US 24 interchange will be a partial cloverleaf configuration with a flyover ramp from US 24 westbound to I-469 southbound, thereby enabling free flow of traffic through the interchange when construction is completed in late 2020. Reconfiguration of the interchange was included in the 2002 final environmental impact statement and record of decision for the Fort-to-Port project, but its construction was deferred at the time due to funding issues. ==Exit list== ==References== ==External links== * Kurumi.com entry * Interstate-guide.com entry 69-4 69-4 4 Category:Transportation in Allen County, Indiana Category:Transportation in Fort Wayne, Indiana ","title":"Interstate 469"},{"id":"1440575","text":"Ward Hill is a hill and eponymous neighborhood located in the northeastern part of Staten Island, New York City.

There are three basic categories of written shorthand. Best known are pure symbol (stenographic) shorthand systems (e.g., Gregg, Pitman). Because the complexity of symbol shorthands made them time- consuming to learn, a variety of newer, alphabetic shorthands were created, with the goal of being easier to learn– e.g., Speedwriting, Stenoscript, Stenospeed, and Forkner shorthand. These systems used normally written letters of the alphabet, but also some number of symbols, alphabetic characters changed in shape or position, or special marks for punctuation; and so they are more accurately described as hybrid shorthand systems. In contrast, Personal Shorthand uses only the 26 letters of the alphabet, without any special symbols, positioning, or punctuation, and it can therefore be written cursively, printed, typed, or even entered in a computer without special typefaces or graphics. Given years of practice, symbol shorthand writers could sometimes acquire skills of 150 or even 200 words per minute, which might have qualified them for demanding positions such as court reporting, typically dominated today by machine shorthands. Due to the extensive time necessary, few achieved such a level. Most symbol shorthand writers in secretarial positions wrote between 80 and 140 words per minute. Hybrid shorthand systems with higher symbol content generally could be written faster than those with fewer symbols. In common with most hybrid shorthands, Personal Shorthand cannot be written as fast as symbol shorthands. However, like some hybrids, learning time is drastically reduced. Students of Personal Shorthand can acquire a useful shorthand skill (50 to 60 wpm) in a single school term, compared to the year or more for symbol system students to reach that same level. Without the complexity of symbols to memorize and practice writing, Personal Shorthand theory is relatively simple. There are six Theory Rules. Slightly more than a hundred high-frequency business vocabulary words are represented by a single written letter known as a Brief Form (\\"a\\" for \\"about\\", \\"t\\" for \\"time\\", \\"v\\" for \\"very\\", etc.). High-frequency letter groupings within words (\\"g\\" for \\"-ing\\", \\"s\\" for \\"-tion\\", etc.), known as Phonetic Abbreviations, are also written with a single letter. In most Personal Shorthand textbooks, the entire Theory is presented in just ten lessons, after which review and practice can lead to writing speeds of 60 to 100 words per minute. Authors of the contemporary version of Personal Shorthand are Carl W. Salser, C. Theo Yerian, and Mark R. Salser. ==External links== * Publisher, ERA Learning/National Book Co Category:Shorthand systems Category:Transcription (linguistics) ","title":"Personal Shorthand"},{"id":"1440600","text":"Weta, Wetas, wētā or WETA may refer to: ==Things== *Wētā, a common name for a group of about 70 species of insects endemic to New Zealand **Weta (genus), the scientific name for a genus including two species of these insects *Weta Trimaran, a dinghy *Weta Workshop, a special effects and prop company *Weta Digital, a digital visual effects company *Weta (band) (1995-2001), a New Zealand rock band *WETA-TV, a television station licensed to Washington, D.C., United States *WETA (FM), a radio station licensed to Washington, D.C., United States *San Francisco Bay Area Water Emergency Transportation Authority ==Places== * Weta, Burma, a village in Thanbyuzayat Township, Burma (Myanmar) * Weta, Ghana, a village in Volta Region, Ghana, also known as Wheta * Weta, Malawi, a village in Mangochi, Malawi * Weta, South Dakota, an unincorporated community in Jackson County, South Dakota, United States ","title":"Weta (disambiguation)"},{"id":"1440601","text":"S2000 may refer to : * Honda S2000, a 1999-2009 Japanese roadster * Peugeot 207 S2000, a rally Peugeot 207 concept car * Super 2000, a racing car classification * Mercedes-Benz S2000, a military truck and predecessor to the Mercedes-Benz Zetros ","title":"S2000"},{"id":"1440604","text":"Grymes Hill is a tall hill formed of serpentine rock on Staten Island, New York. It is the second highest natural point on the island and in the five boroughs of New York City. The neighborhood of the same name encompasses an area of and has a population of 8,263 people. The hill also includes parts of the Silver Lake neighborhood. The area includes part of zip codes 10301 and 10304. ==Etymology== The hill is named after Suzette Grymes, the widow of the first governor of Louisiana, William Charles Cole Claiborne, who settled on Staten Island in 1836 (she had remarried a prominent New Orleans lawyer, John R. Grymes, after Governor Claiborne died in 1817). ==Geography== Neighborhoods around Grymes Hill include Ward Hill to the north, Silver Lake to the west, Sunnyside and Emerson Hill to the south, to the southeast is Concord, and Stapleton and Stapleton Heights to the east. The east side of the hill is defined by Van Duzer Street and Richmond Road to the intersection with the Staten Island Expressway, which, with Clove Road, defines the southern side. On the west is Victory Boulevard. Some claim Cebra Avenue for the northern border, while others believe that the border is Louis Street. ===Topology=== Grymes Hill, which has views of Lower New York Bay and the Narrows, is the second highest point on Staten Island after Todt Hill, reaching its greatest elevation of above sea level. Hero Park, in size, is located at the intersection of Victory Boulevard and Louis Street, abutting the Notre Dame Academy property. The areas hillsides and trees are protected by the Special Hillsides Preservation Zoning District which went into effect in 1987. The Serpentine Art and Nature Commons (\\"SANC\\") owns and maintains several trails on preservation land. Ownership of of the hillside was assumed by the Trust for Public Land. They encouraged concerned neighbors to form SANC to maintain and improve the land as a nature preserve open to the community. Starting in the mid-19th century, breweries dug caves into the hill to use in the production of beer. Some of these caves off of Van Duzer Street were later incorporated into a popular restaurant, which provided catering for the movie The Godfather during shooting on Staten Island. The restaurant has since closed, and the entire site was redeveloped with a townhouse complex. ===Geology=== Grymes Hill was carved by a receding glacier. The Staten Island Serpentinite, which is the serpentine or soapstone area that extends from New Brighton to Richmond, includes the hill country of the island. In places where glacial erosion was limited the stone weathered into a soft, yellowish, fractured condition to which the name \\"soapstone\\" is applied, but where the weathered stone was eroded the rock is hard and dense in texture and dark green in color. The rock's green, yellow or brown colors are often mottled with red. ==History== The area was originally named Signal Hill after a British signal station. Deeds of 1836 and thereabout show that the hill was known as Castleton Heights. Grymes Hill was part of a land grant in 1687 to Thomas Dongan, who served as Governor of the Province of New York. Between the years 1830 and 1833 a local developer, Major George Howard, purchased 42 acres, which included all land between Eddy and Louis streets. Major Howard built many of the hill's earliest homes, and his name survives in Howard Avenue, the hill's main street; a portion of this street was known for a time as Serpentine Road due to the hill's bedrock consisting of serpentinite. ==Community== Grymes Hill is ranked the 4th safest neighborhood in New York City out of 229 according to Niche. The median household income is in the top 15% in the United States. Howard Avenue on Grymes Hill is considered one of the most exclusive and most expensive areas of Staten Island. ===Housing stock=== Most homes in the neighborhood are private residences, many of which were constructed for Manhattan businessmen. The neighborhood has many fine homes dating from the 1920s that overlook New York Harbor. Real estate developer Fred Trump constructed several hundred two- and three-bedroom residences in the late 1940s. These are 423 garden apartments along Howard Avenue and Arlo Road. Fred Trump's son, the developer and later U.S. president Donald Trump, sold these apartments to an unrelated corporation in 2007. Grymes Hill Manor Estates was built in 1953 as rental garden apartments, and switched to co-op status in 1983. It has 152 apartments centering on Seth Court, with many on both sides of Arlo Road, and a few on Howard Avenue and Stratford Avenue. Two high rise apartment buildings at the foot of Howard Avenue converted to condominiums following a major fire in one. There are several apartment buildings on Victory Boulevard. Two new apartment buildings have been constructed facing the Staten Island Expressway. One was turned into condominiums in 2004. The other is being offered as senior citizen housing. ==Green spaces== Hero Park Serpentine Ridge Nature Preserve The only public park on Grymes Hill is Hero Park, a 2-acre park donated in 1920 by Dr. and Mrs. Louis A. Dreyfus. However, Grymes Hill residents are within walking distance of the sprawling Silver Lake Park, whose facilities include a running path, a golf course, and several public tennis courts. The neighborhood also borders Clove Lakes Park, with ponds, baseball fields, and a row-boating house among its amenities. Grymes Hill also includes a steep hillside, known as the Serpentine Ridge Nature Preserve and part of the Special Hillsides Preservation District, which is a heavily wooded land area which remains in a natural state and is covered with native trees and plants including several rare, special concern, endangered, and threatened species. The Serpentine Art and Nature Commons maintains several trails on parts of the hillsides, which are owned by the Trust for Public Land. Grymes Hill includes two cemeteries, both located along Victory Boulevard. Woodland Cemetery dates back to the nineteenth century, and some headstones are in German, reflecting the population of the day. Silver Lake Cemetery also dates back to the nineteenth century, and was the original burial site for the Hebrew Free Burial Association. ==Education== Wagner College Grymes Hill is the home of two institutions of higher learning: Wagner College, and the Staten Island campus of St. John's University. The St. John's campus of was originally a small Catholic women's institution, Notre Dame College, which closed in 1971, when St. John's University took over the campus. Also on the hill is Notre Dame Academy, a Roman Catholic elementary and high school for girls which received an overall A Grade by Niche. Augustinian Academy Adjacent to (and owned by) Wagner College is the site of a former Roman Catholic high school, named Augustinian Academy after the order of friars who ran it; the school closed in 1969. Near the foot of the hill, on Foote Avenue, is P.S. 35, the Clove Valley School, a K-5 school which is ranked 10 out of 10 by GreatSchools.org, 85th of 2,395 New York elementary schools according to SchoolDigger and received an overall A Grade by Niche. Also located on Grymes Hill is Casa Belvedere, a center for Italian culture and studies in Italian language and culture which is located in the Louis A. and Laura Stirn House which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010, and designated a NYC Landmark in 2001. ==Transportation== Grymes Hill is served by the local and limited buses. The express buses provide rush-hour service to and from Manhattan. ==Notable past residents (by year of death)== * Governor Thomas Dongan (1634–1715) in 1687 was granted a 5,100-acre manor, of which Grymes Hill was a portion. * Daniel D.

The game was followed by another 2D scroller, Duke Nukem II, in 1993. The series made the jump to 3D graphics with Duke Nukem 3D in 1996, which became the most popular of the three games. ==Gameplay== Screenshot of gameplay The game consists of three episodes (of ten levels each). The main objective of the game is to get to the exit of each level, while destroying enemies and collecting points. Many objects onscreen can be shot including boxes, obstacles and blocks. Besides points, some collectibles include health powerups, gun powerups, and some inventory items with special abilities. The final level of each episode has no exit, and is instead completed by finding and defeating Dr. Proton. At the end of every level (with the exception of the last level in each episode), the player can receive up to seven 10,000 point bonuses, earned by making certain achievements in the level, such as destroying all cameras. At least two other Apogee titles, Duke Nukem II and Rise of the Triad, have similar end-of-level bonuses. ==Plot== The game is set in the year 1997. Dr. Proton is a madman, determined to take over the world with his army of Techbots. Duke Nukem, the eponymous hero, takes upon the task of stopping him. The first episode takes place in the devastated city of Los Angeles. In the second episode, Duke chases Dr. Proton to his secret moonbase. In the third episode, Dr. Proton escapes into the future, and Duke pursues him through time, to put an end to his mad schemes. ==Development== According to programmer and co- creator Todd Replogle, John Carmack helped him program some low-level parts of the game code in assembly language. ===Technical implementation=== Due to technical limitations the game world scrolls by shifting 8x8 \\"blocks\\" rather than individual pixels. Similar techniques are used in e.g. Zeliard, Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure and Duke Nukem II. Console and arcade platform games would typically perform this using dedicated hardware, such as the PPU in the NES which can scroll the background. The graphics borrowed heavily from other games, such as Turrican and the MS-DOS version of Mega Man. ===Legal concerns with the game name=== After the game's release, Apogee Software became aware that the Captain Planet and the Planeteers animated series featured a character with the same name (Duke Nukem) and therefore to avoid a lawsuit, the software house renamed the 2.0 version of its game Duke Nukum. It later turned out that Duke Nukem was not a registered name, so Apogee registered it and used the original Duke Nukem name in the sequels. ==Reception== Scott Miller estimates that the game eventually sold between 60,000 or 70,000 copies. ==References== ==External links== *Official Duke Nukem website * Category:1991 video games Category:Apogee games Category:DOS games Category:Duke Nukem Category:MacOS games Category:Linux games Category:Platform games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Video games set in 1997 Category:Side- scrolling platform games Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox ","title":"Duke Nukem (video game)"},{"id":"1440627","text":"Lung Leg lurking in the mirror in a self-portrait (2005) titled Lurking in the Mirror. Lung Leg in a ghastly self-portrait (2005) titled Ghastly Self- Portrait. Lung Leg (born Elisabeth Carr; July 8, 1963, in Minneapolis, Minnesota) is an American pin-up girl and actress perhaps best known for appearing on the cover of the Sonic Youth album EVOL. During the 1980s, she gained fame as a model and star of films made by the transgressive movement. == Film career == Lung Leg appeared in several Richard Kern films, notably starring in one of his longest features, the 1985 film You Killed Me First, as well as appearing in Worm Movie (1985) and Fingered (1986). She also appeared in two music videos directed by Kern, \\"Concubine\\" (1984) by Butthole Surfers and Sonic Youth song \\"Death Valley '69\\" (1985). After her film career in the 1980s, Lung Leg left the public sphere for several years. Nick Zedd wrote in his autobiography, Totem of the Depraved, that she relocated to Minneapolis, before moving back to New York City after a short romance with German musician Blixa Bargeld of Einstürzende Neubauten and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. She resumed her film career in 2005, appearing in the Mike Etoll film Sewer Baby. In it, she played a bartender dealing with Tiny Tim, various monsters, special effects and a primordial dwarf. In 2011, Lung Leg appeared in The Hagstone Demon, a film directed by Jon Springer. In 2010, Lung Leg appeared in the documentary Blank City featuring interviews with participants in the no wave cinema and transgressive cinema movements.IMDB Blank City (2010) There are few known interviews with her; one appeared in issue No. 12 of Film Threat magazine (1987), and another, by Duane Davis, appeared in the book, Deathtripping: The Cinema of Transgression (1995), edited by Jack Sargenthttp://filmsfromadangerousmind.blogspot.co.nz/2013/04/only-known- interview-with-lung-leg.html.

Delphi Corporation use either the MPC561 or MPC565 in the engine controllers they supply to General Motors, with nearly all 2009 model GM North America vehicles now using an MPC5xx in the engine controller. Bosch also used the MPC5xx throughout the ME(D)-9 series of Gasoline Engine Controllers, EDC-16 series of Diesel Engine Controllers as did the Cummins B series diesel engine ECU. They are generally considered microcontrollers because of their integrated peripheral set and their unusual architecture: no MMU, large on-chip SRAM and very large (as much as 1 MB) low latency access on-chip flash memories, which means their architecture is tailored to control applications. Instead of a block-address translation and a hardware-driven, fixed-page address translation prescribed by the first PowerPC specification, the 5xx cores provided a software-driven translation mechanism that supported variable page sizes. This model is the basis for the embedded MMU model in the current Power ISA specification. MPC5xx – All PowerPC 5xx family processors share this common naming scheme. The development of the PowerPC 5xx family is discontinued in favour for the more flexible and powerful PowerPC 55xx family. == Characteristics == The peripherals on each model vary, but frequently include analog-to-digital converters (ADC), Time Processor Units (TPU), GPIO, and UARTS/serial (QSMCM). The MPC5xx family descends from the MPC8xx PowerQUICC family core, which means it uses a Harvard architecture, single issue core. Unlike the 8xx family, the 5xx variants have a floating point unit. While some of the earlier chips like the MPC509 had an instruction cache, the recent chips have the capability to contain large amounts of NOR flash memory on-board which is capable of bursting instructions to the processor. Some low-cost chips omit the flash memory because it adds a lot of die area, driving up the price of the chip. Many controller applications run very long control loops where there is not a large dataset and low latency, deterministic access to both data and instruction routines is more important. If most of the data can be stored in the on-chip SRAM available to the datapath of the processor in a single cycle, performance can be quite good. If data must be accessed off-chip frequently, performance can be reduced because the chip cannot burst data accesses from external RAM and has a very slow bus access protocol. Because of the simple memory interface that can be programmed by setting a default memory location and writing a few base registers, the chips are quite popular with hobbyists as well as with automotive and industrial developers. == External links == * Freescale's MPC5xx page * MPC555, MPC565 Single Board Computers Category:Microcontrollers Category:PowerPC microprocessors Category:Freescale Semiconductor ","title":"MPC5xx"},{"id":"1440637","text":"alt=A view from the center of a freeway, looking across to homes on a wooded hill Emerson Hill is the name of a hilly area, and the neighborhood upon which the hill is situated in Staten Island, New York, one of the five boroughs of New York City, United States.

Since the gates are seldom closed and are not staffed by security personnel, it does not qualify as a gated community. Emerson Hill is separated from its equally exclusive neighborhoods of Grymes Hill just north of the Staten Island Expressway, and Todt Hill — where private roads also exist — borders on the south.

It recommends that no one below that age should be admitted to view a film with an 18 certificate in a cinema, and that 18-rated video recordings should not be sold or rented to anyone below that age. As with other British film certificates, the 18 certificate theoretically only has advisory power for films shown in public cinemas, with the ultimate say being held by local authorities. In practice, the local authorities tend to follow BBFC rulings in all but a few exceptional cases. For video and game sales, the BBFC rulings have statutory power, as under the terms of the 1984 Video Recordings Act all videos sold or distributed within the UK must be given a certificate by the BBFC, unless they fall into one of a number of exempt categories. Uncertificated recordings which are not exempt cannot legally be sold, regardless of content. The 18 certificate was created in 1982 as the successor of the previous X certificate, which in turn was the successor of the H certificate (with H standing for \\"horror\\"). See History of British Film Certificates for more details. Typical reasons for restricting films to the 18 certificate category have included hard drug use, supernatural horror, sexually explicit scenes, graphic violence, sadistic violence and sexual violence — the latter two of which have in the past led to a certificate not being issued at all, in effect banning the film in the UK. It was only around the start of the 21st century that the censors passed films with explicit ('hardcore') sexual acts despite the 18 certificate existing for many years. It is also issued by the Irish Film Classification Office. ==Sex and the 18 certificate== Until recently, 18 certificate films could not contain the depiction of actual sex acts, which more recently could only appear in films with an R18 certificate (when created in 1982 only simulated acts could be shown under an R18, but this was relaxed after legal challenges in 2000). Although the BBFC allowed the depiction of simulated sex scenes in 18 certificate films, actual sexual acts were still not allowed to be depicted in 18 certificate films until around 1999. This precedent appears to have been set when the BBFC granted 18 certificates for films containing short scenes of unsimulated sex, such as Catherine Breillat's Romance (1999) and Patrice Chéreau's Intimacy (2001). In October 2004, a new precedent appeared to be set when the BBFC granted an 18 certificate for Michael Winterbottom's film 9 Songs, which featured a number of lengthy explicit scenes of unsimulated sex. This was followed by certificates for Shortbus and Destricted. In the statement justifying the latter decision, it was stated that there is no limit to the number of images that can be considered to be justified. In 2004, the board was also challenged by some pornographic video distributors to award 18 certificates to material otherwise falling under the R18 guidelines. This could have greatly diminished the role of the R18 certificate but failed. This means there continues to be a form of artistic merit test requiring the work to be judged non-pornographic and the scenes in question \\"exceptionally justified by context\\" for a mainstream release. In its 2009 report (available on its website), the BBFC updated its standards stating that: \\"When it comes to sex in films for adults, the Board's policy is that explicit images of real sex should be confined to the ‘R18’ category, unless such images can be justified by their context. However, contextual justification is irrelevant if the primary purpose of the work is sexual arousal or stimulation (i.e. a sex work). Under the new Guidelines, the contextual justification for explicit images of real sex at ‘18’ no longer needs to be ‘exceptional’.\\" The main difference between this new policy and previous years' policies is that contextual justification for images of real sex no longer needs to be \\"exceptional\\" in an 18 rated work. In its 2010 report (available on its website), the BBFC updated its standards again stating that: \\"As in previous years, the Board's policy remains that explicit images of real sex should be confined to the ‘R18’ category unless such images can be justified by their context. Contextual justification, however, has less weight if the primary purpose of the work is sexual arousal or stimulation (i.e. a sex work).\\" The main difference between this new policy and previous years' policies is that contextual justification for images of real sex is no longer irrelevant if the primary purpose of the work is sexual arousal or stimulation; instead, it merely reduces the amount of justification that context can provide. In a sex work, any explicit and non-obscured sight of vaginal or anal penetration by any object whatsoever; any contact between the lips or tongue and genital/anal area; and ejaculation usually requires an R18. Any sight of a liquid resembling semen is also usually restricted to R18, even if the ejaculation is not visible: images of liquid splashing onto faces, breasts or being swallowed have been censored from 18 certificate films. The R18 versions contained these images unaltered. Further reasons for R18, as opposed to 18, include vigorous and/or extensive genital touching (brief genital touching may be passed \\"18\\"), implied triple penetration, extreme close-ups of spread female genitals or anuses (erections are now permissible at 18 however), and certain fetish material, especially urination and potentially dangerous sadomasochistic activities. However, under the new 2010 guidelines, explicit images of real sex can be passed 18 in a sex work provided there is exceptional justifying context. ==Violence, horror, and the 18 certificate== In the past, violence was one of the more problematic aspects when passing a film with an 18 certificate, whether it was sexualised or fantasised violence. Horror films were often the culprits for depicting graphic violence and this often resulted in criticism of the examiners. Particularly violent scenes must be removed before a certificate is awarded. With the advent of home video, films that were cut in the cinemas could be released uncut on video. This led to a moral panic concerning \\"video nasties\\" as coined by tabloid newspapers. The government passed the Video Recordings Act 1984 which meant all videos offered for sale must be assigned a classification agreed upon by an authority designated by the Home Office, which was the BBFC. As a result of this, many films previously cut for cinema (such as The Evil Dead and Dawn of the Dead) had to be cut further in order to get a legal release on video. In recent times, the BBFC has been more lenient towards fantasised violence, and so former 'video nasties' have since passed uncut. Current concerns include content such as \\"any detailed portrayal of violent or dangerous acts which is likely to promote the activity\\", and sexualised violence. The BBFC also takes into account whether the scenes are considered to glamorise sexual assault. In 2002, the board passed Gaspar Noé's Irréversible without any cuts. It said that the rape depicted in the film does not contain any explicit sexual images and is not designed to titillate. Less than a month later, Takashi Miike's Ichi the Killer had to be cut by three minutes and twenty-five seconds due to sexual violence. In this case, the scenes were felt to be potentially glamourising assault. Another example of cuts for sexual violence, as well as child protection issues, is A Serbian Film, a horror film about a retired porn star lured back into performing. Over four minutes of cuts were required, primarily to remove material involving children in sexual and sexually violent scenarios. The initially banned 1980 Italian film Cannibal Holocaust had five minutes and forty-four seconds of cuts to scenes of sexual violence and actual animal cruelty on its first submission in 2001, reduced to only a single cut of three seconds in 2011. References or scenes of suicide or dangerous stunts, which can be easily imitated by youth, can lead to a DVD being given an 18 certificate. Volume 3 of the anime Paranoia Agent (which is normally rated 12 or 15) is rated 18 because of suicide references and violence, mostly in the episode \\"Happy Family Planning\\", which made light of suicide and featured a scene of someone pretending to hang himself, a scene which was edited by the BBFC. An episode of House titled \\"Under My Skin\\" became the first and only one to be passed with an 18 certificate due to scenes depicting a suicide technique that can easily be imitated in real life. Most of the Jackass films are also given an 18 certificate because of dangerous and imitable stunts. ==See also== * Motion picture rating system * Obscene Publications Act * R18 certificate * X certificate ==References== ==External links== * Screen Online: 18 certificate Category:British Board of Film Classification ","title":"18 (British Board of Film Classification)"},{"id":"1440657","text":"The cusp of Carabelli, or Carabelli's tubercle, or tuberculum anomale of Georg Carabelli is a small additional cusp at the mesiopalatal line angle of maxillary first molars. This extra cusp is usually found on the first molar, and becomes progressively less likely in the second, third molars. This cusp is entirely absent in some individuals and present in others in a variety of forms. In some cases, the cusp of Carabelli may rival the main cusps in size. Other related forms include ridges, pits, or furrows. This additional cusp was first described in 1842 by the Hungarian Georg Carabelli (Carabelli György), the court dentist of the Austrian Emperor Franz. The cusp of Carabelli is an heritable feature. Kraus (1951) proposed that homozygosity of a gene is responsible for a pronounced tubercle, whereas the heterozygote shows slight grooves, pits, tubercles or bulge. Later studies showed that the development of this trait is affected by multiple genes. The cusp of Carabelli is most common among Europeans (75-85% of individuals) and rarest in Pacific Islands (35-45%), although no study is referenced here to back up that claim. Although it is sometimes referred to in textbooks as the Cusp of Carabelli, it is actually a tubercle, as it is may be made only of enamel, and may not contain dentin but never has a root underneath. It is unlikely, but entirely possible for the cusp to have a pulp horn. If the cusp is large, approaching the size of a regular cusp, then it will typically be formed of dentin and enamel. ==See also== *Dens evaginatus *Talon cusp *Tubercle == References == == Further reading == * Simon Hillson. 1996.

(ed), Encyclopedia of New York, Yale University Press, 1995 (and not to be confused with the neighborhood of the same name in the borough of Queens), Lighthouse Hill acquired its present name when the Staten Island Range Light, towering 141 feet (43 m)Staten Island Range Lighthouse, New York at Lighthousefriends.com above the Lower New York Bay, was built there in 1912.White, N. & Willensky, E., AIA Guide to New York City (4th Ed.), Three Rivers Press, 2000 Its original light could be seen as far as 21 miles (34 km) away. The former name of Richmond Hill survives in Richmond Hill Road, located at the southern edge of the hill. Lighthouse Hill is the southernmost of the chain of hills that radiate from the northeast corner of Staten Island and separate its East Shore from the region behind the hills, usually referred to as Mid-Island by island residents. Richmond Creek flows near the bottom of the hill's eastern ridge, and it is surrounded on all sides by parks belonging to the Staten Island Greenbelt, with the LaTourette Golf Course at the hill's southern margin. ==Features== Like the other hilltop neighborhoods of Staten Island, Lighthouse Hill is noted for having some of the most opulent homes on Staten Island, rivaled only in grandeur by the Todt Hill neighborhood. In addition to the commanding views of historic Richmondtown and New York Harbor, Lighthouse Hill is also the site of the following notable locations: The Jacques Marchais Museum of Tibetan Art is the oldest Himalayan style architecture in the United States, and it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Crimson Beech is the only residence in New York City designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, and it was declared a landmark in 1990. The LaTourette House, built as a farmhouse in 1836, now serves as the clubhouse for LaTourette Golf Course, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==Notable residents== Some notable residents include Edward Arlington Robinson (poet), best known for his poem \\"Richard Corey\\" (a staple in American high school and college literature classes). During his stay at LaTourette, Edward Arlington Robinson corresponded with Kermit Roosevelt, son of President Theodore Roosevelt. In his letters to Kermit Roosevelt, Robinson lauded the President for helping the poet obtain a job at the United States Customs House in Manhattan, which was essentially a \\"no-show\\" job that enabled Robinson to support himself while he wrote poetry. Robinson, by his own admission, wrote his least popular works - i.e., the plays \\"Van Zorn\\" and \\"Porcuipine\\" - while staying at LaTourette. Arthur Anderson, a radio, TV, and film personality who is best known as the \\"Voice of the Lucky Charms Leprechaun\\" lived on Edinboro Road for the first twelve years of his life. Anderson worked with Orson Welles in the Mercury Theatre and the radio series The Mercury Theatre on the Air which featured Shakepearean classics. Modernist painter Henry Fitch Taylor, a student of Claude Monet, lived in the LaTourette House from 1913 to 1915 with his wife, Clara Sidney Davidge. Mrs. Davidge is credited with organizing the first Armory Show in 1913 in which the American public was exposed to the European Impressionists.

It is part of the Drepana subgenus Watsonalla. It is found in most of Europe except the far north. It is quite common in England and Wales but not found in Scotland and only recently in Ireland. The species was first described by Johann Siegfried Hufnagel in 1767. The sexes differ in size (male wingspan about 30 mm, female about 35 mm) but are similar in colour. The forewings are orange brown with three narrow yellow fascia (the outer one being faint and sometimes absent) with two dark discal spots between the inner two fascia. Sometimes these occur, but weaker, on the rear wings. The apex of the forewing is hook shaped, giving the species its name. The hindwings are lighter orange, again with three yellow fascia. Usually two broods are produced each year, the adults flying in May and June and again in August . Second-generation moths are much smaller and slightly lighter coloured than those of the first. They are very similar to Watsonalla cultraria which also has a yellowish-brown colour. Two black twin points on the front wings are the clearest differentiator. The species sometimes flies during the day but usually flies at night and is attracted to light. The larva is brown with yellow markings and shows the typical drepanid shape with a tapered tail. It usually feeds on oak but has also been recorded on alder, beech and birch. The species overwinters as a pupa. #The flight season refers to the British Isles.

The museum has many flying and static aircraft, along with several rare examples under restoration. ==History== Planes of Fame Air Museum was founded by Edward T. Maloney on January 12, 1957, in Claremont, California, to save historically important aircraft. At that time, it was called \\"The Air Museum\\". A small group of volunteers, including future museum president Steve Hinton, set out to make the museum's aircraft flyable. In 1962, after the museum's collection of aircraft and memorabilia outgrew its original home, it moved to nearby Ontario Airport, California.Mormillo 1983, p. 58. In 1970, redevelopment of the airport at Ontario forced the museum to move again. The nonflyable aircraft became part of the \\"Movie World: Cars of the Stars and Planes of Fame Museum\\" in Buena Park, California, near Knott's Berry Farm, while the flyable aircraft moved to Chino Airport, about 30 mi (48 km) away. This airport was formerly the home of Cal-Aero Academy, an Army Air Corps facility that trained more than 10,000 pilots before the end of World War II. When Movie World closed in 1973, the name \\"Planes of Fame\\" was transferred, along with the static planes, to the flying collection at Chino. As more aircraft were restored and the collection grew, an additional display facility was opened in 1995 at Valle, Arizona. Located halfway between Williams, Arizona, and the south rim of the Grand Canyon, it houses more than 40 of the museum’s aircraft, many flyable. The Chino facility opened its Enterprise Hangar in 2002. Designed to resemble the hangar deck of a World War II aircraft carrier, it contains a number of items from the USS Enterprise (CV-6) donated by members of her crew and flight squadrons. It also houses many aircraft typical of those that served on the Enterprise during the war. The Chino facility was further expanded in 2004-08, adding two new hangars, new offices, a gift shop, library, and the Hands-On Aviation youth education center. Display areas for jets and other aircraft of the Korean War, Cold War, and Vietnam War were added. In October 2009, another new hangar was dedicated, this one built by the 475th Fighter Group to store their memorabilia and house the museum’s rare Lockheed P-38 Lightning. ==Collection== B-17, Piccadilly Lilly II, is undergoing restoration to flight capability. In January 2013, the restoration continued. The museum's collection of Japanese aircraft is the largest of its type in the world. This collection includes the only authentic airworthy example of the Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter in the world, with its original Sakae engine and an Aichi D3A featured in the movie Tora! Tora! Tora!. Many other rare aircraft are maintained in flyable condition, such as a North American P-51A Mustang, a Boeing P-26A Peashooter, a Lockheed P-38J Lightning, and a Republic P-47G Thunderbolt. Many of the museum's roughly 150 aircraft were built in Southern California, and about 30 are flyable.Ogden, Bob.

Each mini-airshow starts with one or more talks or seminars given by people involved with the featured aircraft (such as combat pilots), followed by a flight demonstration of two or three aircraft related to that day's theme. The museum flies all of its airworthy aircraft, as well as many other warbirds visiting from other museums or brought by private owners, during its annual airshow. This event is the largest gathering of warbirds in the western US. Many aircraft are rare or one of a kind. ==Military vehicles== The Military Vehicle Corps, often referred to as the Motor Pool, is a small group within the Planes of Fame Air Museum. The Military Vehicles in their collection are primarily from World War II and are maintained and operated by a group of Museum volunteers. These vehicles are used in parades, public events (e.g. Marching Thru History), and WWII re-enactments. The following vehicles are some of those that are on display at Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, CA. *M4A1 Sherman Tank *1941 WC-54 Dodge Ambulance *GMC CCKW ==475th Fighter Group== A flyable P-51 Mustang hangared.

It was the first all- Lockheed P-38 group and the only one formed overseas in Australia. Many people have donated time, skills and memorabilia to preserve the history and proud heritage of the many valiant men of the 475th. This new museum was dedicated on October 1997, at the expanding March Field Air Museum complex at the former March Air Force Base near Riverside, California, where the first test flight of the P-38 took place. The March Field Museum chronicles the history of U.S. military aviation since 1917. Legally known as The 475th Fighter Group Historical Foundation, Inc., the museum was housed in a modern steel building reminiscent of a World War II military hangar. In 2005, the museum's board decided to merge the museum into The Air Museum Planes of Fame. As of 2015, a hangar at Planes of Fame was under construction for the 475th. ==See also== *Yanks Air Museum, another air museum located at the Chino Airport. *List of aerospace museums ==References== * Mormillo, Frank B. \\"Chino's 'Planes of Fame'\\".

An ECN is generally an electronic system that widely disseminates orders entered by market makers to third parties and permits the orders to be executed against in whole or in part. The primary products that are traded on ECNs are stocks and currencies. ECNs are generally passive computer-driven networks that internally match limit orders and charge a very small per share transaction fee (often a fraction of a cent per share).Lemke and Lins, Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities, §2:27 (Thomson West, 2013-2014 ed.). The first ECN, Instinet, was created in 1969. ECNs increase competition among trading firms by lowering transaction costs, giving clients full access to their order books, and offering order matching outside traditional exchange hours. ECNs are sometimes also referred to as alternative trading systems or alternative trading networks. ==Function== To trade with an ECN, one must be a subscriber or have an account with a broker that provides direct access trading. ECN subscribers can enter orders into the ECN via a custom computer terminal or network protocols. The ECN will then match contra- side orders (i.e. a sell-order is \\"contra-side\\" to a buy-order with the same price and share count) for execution. The ECN will post unmatched orders on the system for other subscribers to view. Generally, the buyer and seller are anonymous, with the trade execution reports listing the ECN as the party. Some ECN brokers may offer additional features to subscribers such as negotiation, reserve size, and pegging, and may have access to the entire ECN book (as opposed to the \\"top of the book\\") that real-time market data regarding depth of trading interest. ECNs are generally facilitated by electronic negotiation, a type of communication between agents that allows cooperative and competitive sharing of information to determine a proper price. ===Negotiation types=== The most common paradigm is the electronic auction type. As of 2005, most e-business negotiation systems can only support price negotiations. Traditional negotiations typically include discussion of other attributes of a deal, such as delivery terms or payment conditions. This one-dimensional approach is one of the reasons why electronic markets struggle for acceptance. Multiattributive and combinatorial auction mechanisms are emerging to allow further types of negotiation. Support for complex multi-attribute negotiations is a critical success factor for the next generation of electronic markets and, more generally, for all types of electronic exchanges. This is what the second type of electronic negotiation, namely Negotiation Support, addresses. While auctions are essentially mechanisms, bargaining is often the only choice in complex cases or those cases where no choice of partners is given. Bargaining is a hard, error-prone, ambiguous task often performed under time pressure. Information technology has some potential to facilitate negotiation processes which are analyzed in research projects/prototypes such as INSPIRE, Negoisst or WebNS. The third type of negotiation is automated argumentation, where agents exchange not only values, but also arguments for their offers/counter-offers. This requires agents to be able to reason about the mental states of other market participants. ===Technologies=== One research area that has paid particular attention to modeling automated negotiations is that of autonomous agents. If negotiations occur frequently, possibly on a minute per minute basis in order to schedule network capacity, or negotiation topics can be clearly defined it may be desirable to automate this coordination. Automated negotiation is a key form of interaction in complex systems composed of autonomous agents. Negotiation is a process of making offers and counteroffers, with the aim of finding an acceptable agreement. During negotiation, each offer is based on its own utility and expectation of what other . This means that a multi criteria decision making is need to be taken for each offer. ==In the stock market== For stock trading, ECNs exist as a class of SEC-permitted alternative trading systems (ATS). As an ATS, ECNs exclude broker-dealers' internal crossing networks – i.e., systems that match orders in private using prices from a public exchange. ECNs, as alternative trading systems, have increased competition with institutional trading systems. Alternative trading systems have been found to have lower execution costs, however as new ECNs emerge, some of this cost reduction has dissipated. Simultaneously, the growth of ECNs has been found to disrupt institutional trading. An analysis of impact of ECNs on NASDAQ found \\"tighter spreads, greater depths, and less concentrated markets\\". ECNs provide historical orders and price data to subscribers. As a result, ECNs compete through their ability to attract \\"more informed orders\\" during \\"periods of high volume and return volatility\\". Today \\"ECN’s capture 40% of the volume in NASDAQ securities\\", and are considerably changing the securities trading market (Hendershott). ECNs have influenced the stock market by eliminating dealer functions in order- matching. With the automation of orders on mass scale, the role of intermediary traders has been reconfigured. While the ECNs don’t execute decision-making algorithms to the extent of algorithmic trading, nevertheless they have impacted the role of human traders in financial exchange. ==Fee structure== ECN's fee structure can be grouped in two basic structures: a classic structure and a credit (or rebate) structure. Both fee structures offer advantages of their own. The classic structure tends to attract liquidity removers while the credit structure appeals to liquidity providers. However, since both removers and providers of liquidity are necessary to create a market, ECNs must choose their fee structures carefully. In a credit structure ECNs make a profit from paying liquidity providers a credit while charging a debit to liquidity removers. Credits range from $0.002 to $0.00295 per share for liquidity providers, and debits from $0.0025 to $0.003 per share for liquidity removers. The fee can be determined by monthly volume provided and removed, or by a fixed structure, depending on the ECN. This structure is common on the NASDAQ market. NASDAQ Price List. Traders commonly quote the fees in millicents or mils (e.g. $0.00295 is 29.5 mils). In a classic structure, the ECN will charge a small fee to all market participants using their network, both liquidity providers and removers. They also can attract volume to their networks by giving lower prices to large liquidity providers. Fees for ECNs that operate under a classic structure range from $0 to $0.0015, or even higher depending on each ECN. This fee structure is more common in the NYSE, however recently some ECNs have moved their NYSE operations into a credit structure. ==Currency trading== The first ECN for internet currency trading was New-York based Matchbook FX formed in 1999. Back then, all the prices were created & supplied by Matchbook FX's traders/users, including banks, within its ECN network. This was quite unique at the time, as it empowered buy-side FX market participants, historically always \\"price takers\\", to finally be price makers as well. Today, multiple FX ECNs provide access to an electronic trading network, supplied with streaming quotes from the top tier banks in the world. Their matching engines perform limit checks and match orders, usually in less than 100 milliseconds per order. The matching is quote driven and these are the prices that match against all orders. Spreads are discretionary but in general multibank competition creates 1-2 pip spreads on USD Majors and Euro Crosses. The order book is not a routing system that sends orders to individual market makers. It is a live exchange type book working against the best bid/offer of all quotes. By trading through an ECN, a currency trader generally benefits from greater price transparency, faster processing, increased liquidity and more availability in the marketplace. Banks also reduce their costs as there is less manual effort involved in using an ECN for trading. ==History== The term ECN was used by the SEC to define, \\"any electronic system that widely disseminates to third parties orders entered therein by an exchange market maker or OTC market maker, and permits such orders to be executed against in whole or in part\\". The first ECN, the Instinet, was released in 1969 and provided an early application of the advances in computing. The spread of ECNs was encouraged through changes in regulatory law set forth by the SEC, and in 1975 the SEC adopted the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, encouraging the \\"linking of all markets for qualified securities through communication and data processing facilities\\". ECNs have complicated stock exchanges through their interaction with NASDAQ. One of the key developments in the history of ECNs was the NASDAQ over-the-counter quotation system. NASDAQ was created following a 1969 American Stock Exchange study which estimated that errors in the processing of handwritten securities orders cost brokerage firms approximately $100 million per year. The NASDAQ system automated such order processing and provided brokers with the latest competitive price quotes via a computer terminal. In March 1994, a study by two economists, William Christie and Paul Schultz, noted that NASDAQ bid–ask spreads were larger than was statistically likely, indicating \\"We are unable to envision any scenario in which 40 to 60 dealers who are competing for order flow would simultaneously and consistently avoid using odd-eighth quotes without an implicit agreement to post quotes only on the even price fractions. However, our data do not provide direct evidence of tacit collusion among NASDAQ market makers\\". These results led to an antitrust lawsuit being filed against NASDAQ. As part of NASDAQ's settlement of the antitrust charges, NASDAQ adopted new order handling rules that integrated ECNs into the NASDAQ system. Shortly after this settlement, the SEC adopted Regulation ATS, which permitted ECNs the option of registering as stock exchanges or else being regulated under a separate set of standards for ECNs.Christie, William G. and Schultz, Paul H. \\"Why Do NASDAQ Market Makers Avoid Odd-Eighth Quotes?\\" The Journal of Finance 49:5 (December 1994), pp. 1813–1840.\\"Statement on the Structure of the Nasdaq Stock Market\\" , Financial Economists Roundtable, September 18, 1995. At that time major ECNs that became active were Instinet and Island (part of Instinet was spun off, merged with Island into Inet, and acquired by NASDAQ), Archipelago Exchange (which was acquired by the NYSE) and Brut (now acquired by NASDAQ). ECNs enjoyed a resurgence after the adoption of SEC Regulation NMS, which required \\"trade through\\" protection of orders in the market, regardless of where those orders are placed. In the past, many ECNs were \\"closed book\\"—i.e., allowing participants to interact only with other participants in that network. However, increasingly ECNs have adopted an \\"open book\\" format, addressing the potential fragmented liquidity by integrating orders with those of other ECNs or market makers, thus increasing the overall pool of orders.Lemke and Lins, Soft Dollars and Other Trading Activities, §2:27 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). ==See also== * TAE * Extended hours trading * NASDAQ * NYSE Arca * Inet * Island ECN ==References== ==External links== * Special Study: Electronic Communication Networks and After-Hours Trading * ECNs/Alternative Trading Systems Category:Stock market ","title":"Electronic communication network"},{"id":"1440685","text":"Project 621 was a project by the Dornier company with the intention of producing a sounding rocket with liquid-fuel propulsion.

There are about 10 employees on the payroll, but significant work is done by student volunteers (writing, taking photos, copy editing). The Martlet is funded partially by student fees, and partially by advertisements. As of 2017, each full-time student pays $3.75 per semester to the Martlet. The newspaper is distributed freely around the UVic campus and various locations around greater Victoria every second Thursday during the school year, and on a monthly basis in the summer. The Martlet Publishing Society is a non-profit society governed by a volunteer- run, five-position board of directors. All staff, paid or otherwise, must answer to the board, and welcomes all students to attend board meetings. The Martlet’s website is frequently updated with new web-exclusive content. The Martlet is now a member of Free Media. The Martlet is the only independent campus newspaper at the University of Victoria, and therefore one of the only publications that has the time and resources to fully hold both the University of Victoria and the University of Victoria Students' Society (UVSS) accountable. The Martlet regularly reports on UVic Board of Governors and Senate meetings, as well as University of Victoria Students' Society Board meetings and elections. Today, the Martlet has a wide circulation and can be found in coffee shops, theatres, grocery stores, offices, and street corners throughout Victoria, British Columbia. The newspaper maintains its strong editorial line and commitment to politics and activism. Many national journalists and columnists in Canada have gotten their start in writing journalism at the Martlet and it continues to produce opportunities for student writers to become professionals. Notable Martlet alumni include Andrew MacLeod of the Tyee, Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps, and Leader of the B.C. Green Party Andrew Weaver. In recent years, the Martlet has broken stories about UVSS spending deficits, UVic's reputational enhancement project, divestment lobbying efforts by UVic student activists, issues with UVic's sexualized violence policy, the arrival of Starbucks on campus, problems in the UVic Sociology department, international student tuition hikes, student groups' support of the Unist'ot'en First Nation camp, pro-life vs. pro-choice protesters on campus, racism and antisemitism on campus, and the ongoing battle for UVic student Lilia Zaharieva to receive her life-saving medication for her cystic fibrosis. The Martlet is currently undergoing a transformation as it slowly transitions to more exclusive web-only content, in line with the shifting tendencies of journalism worldwide. Along with the 5000 physical papers circulated around the UVic campus and the local community, the Martlet has over 3600 followers on Twitter and 1900 followers on Facebook. www.martlet.ca receives an annual average of 30,000 audience members via organic web search, and 17,000 audience members via social media channels. Martlet stories are regularly picked up by larger publications including the CBC, CTV News, the Times Colonist, and Chek News. ==History== The Martlet was founded when UVic was Victoria College, and the original name was the Microscope. The paper takes its name from a heraldic bird with no feet. Three martlet birds appear on the crest of McGill University, and the University of Victoria grew out of the McGill University College of British Columbia. For a brief period in the early 1970s, the Martlet was renamed the 'Cougar City Gazette' after an armed takeover by a loose coalition of disgruntled former students and at least one former(?) professor who were dissatisfied with the perceived blandness of the newspaper - perusal of the content of the Cougar City Gazette clearly reflects the change of editorial direction. The Cougar City Gazette was often quite controversial, and its existence came to an abrupt end after it published a captioned photograph that prompted Playboy magazine to threaten the paper with legal action. In 1971, the Martlet was partly responsible for bringing about the resignation of the university's president, Bruce J. Partridge, when it erroneously reported that he had obtained his law degree from a correspondence school under investigation as a \\"degree mill.\\" In 2001, the Martlet Publishing Society issued an apology to Partridge for publishing articles that made reference to these events in an anniversary book. A 2003 Martlet article by Patrick White stated that, though Partridge legitimately acquired his degree by correspondence, rumours about Partridge's qualifications spread throughout the university. He resigned in November 1971. An article with a statement from Partridge can be found in an archived 1971 issue of the University of British Columbia's paper the Ubyssey. Until 2004 the Martlet had an \\"advertising boycott list\\", which has been dropped to allow for an assessment of each individual advertisement. The Martlet has received criticism for running advertisements that some readers have interpreted as sexist, notably in fall 2004 when they ran ads for \\"Canada's Search for the Coors Light Maxim Girl.\\" ==See also== *List of student newspapers in Canada *List of newspapers in Canada *The Ring - UVic's community newspaper, published by UVic Communications *Nexus - A student newspaper from neighbouring Camosun College ==References and works cited== * Article on Newspaper * Apology to Bruce Partridge * Martlet article on UVic scandals * Ubyssey article from 1971(includes article on page 3 about Bruce Partridge) * Op-ed on Coors Maxim sexism debate and some letters on the issue ==External links== * Martlet homepage * University of Victoria Students' Society * UVic's CFUV Radio * UVic's Cinecenta Movie Theatre Category:University of Victoria Category:Student newspapers published in British Columbia Category:Mass media in Victoria, British Columbia Category:Publications with year of establishment missing Category:Weekly newspapers published in British Columbia Category:Biweekly newspapers published in Canada ","title":"The Martlet"},{"id":"1440695","text":"In mathematics, specifically in commutative algebra, the elementary symmetric polynomials are one type of basic building block for symmetric polynomials, in the sense that any symmetric polynomial can be expressed as a polynomial in elementary symmetric polynomials. That is, any symmetric polynomial is given by an expression involving only additions and multiplication of constants and elementary symmetric polynomials. There is one elementary symmetric polynomial of degree in variables for each nonnegative integer , and it is formed by adding together all distinct products of distinct variables. ==Definition== The elementary symmetric polynomials in variables , written for , are defined by :\\\\begin{align} e_0 (X_1, X_2, \\\\dots,X_n) &= 1,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[10pt] e_1 (X_1, X_2, \\\\dots,X_n) &= \\\\sum_{1 \\\\leq j \\\\leq n} X_j,\\\\\\\\\\\\ e_2 (X_1, X_2, \\\\dots,X_n) &= \\\\sum_{1 \\\\leq j < k \\\\leq n} X_j X_k,\\\\\\\\\\\\ e_3 (X_1, X_2, \\\\dots,X_n) &= \\\\sum_{1 \\\\leq j < k < l \\\\leq n} X_j X_k X_l,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} and so forth, ending with : e_n (X_1, X_2, \\\\dots,X_n) = X_1 X_2 \\\\cdots X_n. In general, for we define : e_k (X_1 , \\\\ldots , X_n )=\\\\sum_{1\\\\le j_1 < j_2 < \\\\cdots < j_k \\\\le n} X_{j_1} \\\\dotsm X_{j_k}, so that if . Thus, for each non-negative integer less than or equal to there exists exactly one elementary symmetric polynomial of degree in variables. To form the one that has degree , we take the sum of all products of -subsets of the variables. (By contrast, if one performs the same operation using multisets of variables, that is, taking variables with repetition, one arrives at the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials.) Given an integer partition (that is, a finite non-increasing sequence of positive integers) , one defines the symmetric polynomial , also called an elementary symmetric polynomial, by : e_\\\\lambda (X_1, \\\\dots,X_n) = e_{\\\\lambda_1}(X_1, \\\\dots, X_n) \\\\cdot e_{\\\\lambda_2}(X_1, \\\\dots, X_n) \\\\cdots e_{\\\\lambda_m}(X_1, \\\\dots, X_n). Sometimes the notation is used instead of . ==Examples== The following lists the elementary symmetric polynomials for the first four positive values of . (In every case, is also one of the polynomials.) For : :e_1(X_1) = X_1. For : :\\\\begin{align} e_1(X_1,X_2) &= X_1 + X_2,\\\\\\\\\\\\ e_2(X_1,X_2) &= X_1X_2.\\\\,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} For : :\\\\begin{align} e_1(X_1,X_2,X_3) &= X_1 + X_2 + X_3,\\\\\\\\\\\\ e_2(X_1,X_2,X_3) &= X_1X_2 + X_1X_3 + X_2X_3,\\\\\\\\\\\\ e_3(X_1,X_2,X_3) &= X_1X_2X_3.\\\\,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} For : :\\\\begin{align} e_1(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4) &= X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4,\\\\\\\\\\\\ e_2(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4) &= X_1X_2 + X_1X_3 + X_1X_4 + X_2X_3 + X_2X_4 + X_3X_4,\\\\\\\\\\\\ e_3(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4) &= X_1X_2X_3 + X_1X_2X_4 + X_1X_3X_4 + X_2X_3X_4,\\\\\\\\\\\\ e_4(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4) &= X_1X_2X_3X_4.\\\\,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} ==Properties== The elementary symmetric polynomials appear when we expand a linear factorization of a monic polynomial: we have the identity :\\\\prod_{j=1}^n ( \\\\lambda - X_j)=\\\\lambda^n - e_1(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n)\\\\lambda^{n-1} + e_2(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n)\\\\lambda^{n-2} + \\\\cdots +(-1)^n e_n(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n). That is, when we substitute numerical values for the variables , we obtain the monic univariate polynomial (with variable ) whose roots are the values substituted for and whose coefficients are up to their sign the elementary symmetric polynomials. These relations between the roots and the coefficients of a polynomial are called Vieta's formulas. The characteristic polynomial of a square matrix is an example of application of Vieta's formulas. The roots of this polynomial are the eigenvalues of the matrix. When we substitute these eigenvalues into the elementary symmetric polynomials, we obtain, up to their sign, the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial, which are invariants of the matrix. In particular, the trace (the sum of the elements of the diagonal) is the value of , and thus the sum of the eigenvalues. Similarly, the determinant is, up to the sign, the constant term of the characteristic polynomial; more precisely the determinant is the value of . Thus the determinant of a square matrix is the product of the eigenvalues. The set of elementary symmetric polynomials in variables generates the ring of symmetric polynomials in variables. More specifically, the ring of symmetric polynomials with integer coefficients equals the integral polynomial ring . (See below for a more general statement and proof.) This fact is one of the foundations of invariant theory. For other systems of symmetric polynomials with a similar property see power sum symmetric polynomials and complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials. == Fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials == For any commutative ring , denote the ring of symmetric polynomials in the variables with coefficients in by . This is a polynomial ring in the n elementary symmetric polynomials for . (Note that is not among these polynomials; since , it cannot be member of any set of algebraically independent elements.) This means that every symmetric polynomial has a unique representation : P(X_1,\\\\ldots, X_n)=Q\\\\big(e_1(X_1 , \\\\ldots ,X_n), \\\\ldots, e_n(X_1 , \\\\ldots ,X_n)\\\\big) for some polynomial . Another way of saying the same thing is that the ring homomorphism that sends to for defines an isomorphism between and . === Proof sketch === The theorem may be proved for symmetric homogeneous polynomials by a double mathematical induction with respect to the number of variables and, for fixed , with respect to the degree of the homogeneous polynomial. The general case then follows by splitting an arbitrary symmetric polynomial into its homogeneous components (which are again symmetric). In the case the result is obvious because every polynomial in one variable is automatically symmetric. Assume now that the theorem has been proved for all polynomials for variables and all symmetric polynomials in variables with degree . Every homogeneous symmetric polynomial in can be decomposed as a sum of homogeneous symmetric polynomials : P(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n)= P_{\\\\text{lacunary}} (X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n) + X_1 \\\\cdots X_n \\\\cdot Q(X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n). Here the \\"lacunary part\\" is defined as the sum of all monomials in which contain only a proper subset of the variables , i.e., where at least one variable is missing. Because is symmetric, the lacunary part is determined by its terms containing only the variables , i.e., which do not contain . More precisely: If and are two homogeneous symmetric polynomials in having the same degree, and if the coefficient of before each monomial which contains only the variables equals the corresponding coefficient of , then and have equal lacunary parts. (This is because every monomial which can appear in a lacunary part must lack at least one variable, and thus can be transformed by a permutation of the variables into a monomial which contains only the variables .) But the terms of which contain only the variables are precisely the terms that survive the operation of setting to 0, so their sum equals , which is a symmetric polynomial in the variables that we shall denote by . By the inductive assumption, this polynomial can be written as : \\\\tilde{P}(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{n-1})=\\\\tilde{Q}(\\\\sigma_{1,n-1}, \\\\ldots, \\\\sigma_{n-1,n-1}) for some . Here the doubly indexed denote the elementary symmetric polynomials in variables. Consider now the polynomial : R(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{n}):= \\\\tilde{Q}(\\\\sigma_{1,n}, \\\\ldots, \\\\sigma_{n-1,n}) \\\\ . Then is a symmetric polynomial in , of the same degree as , which satisfies :R(X_1, \\\\ldots, X_{n-1},0) = \\\\tilde{Q}(\\\\sigma_{1,n-1}, \\\\ldots, \\\\sigma_{n-1,n-1}) = P(X_1, \\\\ldots,X_{n-1},0) (the first equality holds because setting to 0 in gives , for all ). In other words, the coefficient of before each monomial which contains only the variables equals the corresponding coefficient of . As we know, this shows that the lacunary part of coincides with that of the original polynomial . Therefore the difference has no lacunary part, and is therefore divisible by the product of all variables, which equals the elementary symmetric polynomial . Then writing , the quotient is a homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree less than (in fact degree at most ) which by the inductive assumption can be expressed as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric functions. Combining the representations for and one finds a polynomial representation for . The uniqueness of the representation can be proved inductively in a similar way. (It is equivalent to the fact that the polynomials are algebraically independent over the ring .) The fact that the polynomial representation is unique implies that is isomorphic to . === Alternative proof === The following proof is also inductive, but does not involve other polynomials than those symmetric in , and also leads to a fairly direct procedure to effectively write a symmetric polynomial as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric ones. Assume the symmetric polynomial to be homogeneous of degree ; different homogeneous components can be decomposed separately. Order the monomials in the variables lexicographically, where the individual variables are ordered , in other words the dominant term of a polynomial is one with the highest occurring power of , and among those the one with the highest power of , etc. Furthermore parametrize all products of elementary symmetric polynomials that have degree (they are in fact homogeneous) as follows by partitions of . Order the individual elementary symmetric polynomials in the product so that those with larger indices come first, then build for each such factor a column of boxes, and arrange those columns from left to right to form a Young diagram containing boxes in all. The shape of this diagram is a partition of , and each partition of arises for exactly one product of elementary symmetric polynomials, which we shall denote by ) (the is present only because traditionally this product is associated to the transpose partition of ). The essential ingredient of the proof is the following simple property, which uses multi-index notation for monomials in the variables . Lemma. The leading term of is . :Proof. The leading term of the product is the product of the leading terms of each factor (this is true whenever one uses a monomial order, like the lexicographic order used here), and the leading term of the factor is clearly . To count the occurrences of the individual variables in the resulting monomial, fill the column of the Young diagram corresponding to the factor concerned with the numbers of the variables, then all boxes in the first row contain 1, those in the second row 2, and so forth, which means the leading term is . Now one proves by induction on the leading monomial in lexicographic order, that any nonzero homogeneous symmetric polynomial of degree can be written as polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials. Since is symmetric, its leading monomial has weakly decreasing exponents, so it is some with a partition of . Let the coefficient of this term be , then is either zero or a symmetric polynomial with a strictly smaller leading monomial. Writing this difference inductively as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials, and adding back to it, one obtains the sought for polynomial expression for . The fact that this expression is unique, or equivalently that all the products (monomials) of elementary symmetric polynomials are linearly independent, is also easily proved. The lemma shows that all these products have different leading monomials, and this suffices: if a nontrivial linear combination of the were zero, one focuses on the contribution in the linear combination with nonzero coefficient and with (as polynomial in the variables ) the largest leading monomial; the leading term of this contribution cannot be cancelled by any other contribution of the linear combination, which gives a contradiction. ==See also== *Symmetric polynomial *Complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial *Schur polynomial *Newton's identities *MacMahon Master theorem *Symmetric function *Representation theory ==References== * * Category:Homogeneous polynomials Category:Symmetric functions Category:Articles containing proofs ","title":"Elementary symmetric polynomial"},{"id":"1440696","text":"Rear Admiral Clarence Wade McClusky, Jr., (June 1, 1902 – June 27, 1976) was a United States Navy aviator during World War II and the early Cold War period.

Both of his parents were born in Pennsylvania, but had spent their adulthoods in Buffalo. Wade, Sr. was a Presbyterian of Scotch-Irish ancestry, while May was an Irish Catholic. Wade, Sr. refused to raise the children in the Catholic faith, and forbade May from attending Catholic Mass. Wade, Sr. died in an automobile crash on October 8, 1928, after which May returned to the Catholic Church. May persuaded one of McClusky's sisters to convert to Catholicism, but McClusky himself became an Episcopalian. McClusky disliked his first name Clarence, and always signed his name as \\"C.

As his family's financial situation was strained, he sought employment instead of applying to colleges. His first job involved cleaning the interiors of railroad tanker cars, and associated exposure to various chemicals. McClusky's son Philip recalled in 2015: \\"He told me once that it was a miserable job and as a result he was determined to go to college or the academy!\\" ==Naval aviator and instructor== McClusky graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1926, the same class as Max Leslie, and became a Naval Aviator three years later. Over the next decade, he served in several air units, as well as on command staff, as an instructor at the Naval Academy and at shore facilities. In 1940, he was assigned to Fighting Squadron Six (VF-6), based on , and assumed command of that squadron in April 1941. ==World War II== Lieutenant Commander McClusky became Enterprise's air group commander in April 1942. During the Battle of Midway, while leading his air group's scout bombers on June 4, 1942, he made the critical tactical decision that led to the sinking of two of Japan's fleet carriers, ' and '. When McClusky could not find the Japanese carriers where he expected them, and with his air group's fuel running dangerously low, he began a box search and on the second leg spotted the steaming north at flank speed. The Arashi had stayed behind to attack the submarine ', which had been harassing the Japanese fleet. Surmising that the Arashi must be following the main fleet, McClusky ordered a change in course in the same direction as Arashi. This led him directly to the enemy carriers. McClusky gave an order to attack, which resulted in confusion with both squadrons of 31 aircraft diving on the closer carrier, Kaga. Doctrine called for McClusky's forward squadron to attack the further carrier, Akagi, and squadron behind his to attack Kaga. Thus the two carrier attacks would occur at the same time and make it harder for Japanese Zeros to respond. Lieutenant Richard Best, who commanded the other squadron and was considered to be its best pilot, noticed the error and pulled out with two wingmen to attack the Akagi, with Best scoring a direct hit amidship and a wingman a near miss at the rear of the ship, which disabled the rudder and rendered the Akagi immobile. The other 28 dive bombers, some of which nearly collided with each other, scored at least four hits on Kaga, leaving it a burning wreck. As he pulled out of his dive, McClusky's plane was pounced on by two Zeros, which put 52 holes in his plane and a bullet through his shoulder. After his gunner shot down one of the Zeros, McClusky was able to land his plane safely on the Enterprise even with partially shot up controls. The confused attack order was later explained as a radio error due to multiple people speaking at the same time. As a fighter pilot new to the dive bombing squadron, McClusky was not familiar with dive bombing doctrine, as was Best. This explains McClusky's decision to lead his squadron in attacking the closer Kaga. Meanwhile, a squadron from the Yorktown, led by Max Leslie, had taken off an hour later, but it used a more recent, and hence more accurate, sighting for the location of the Japanese carriers. It arrived at the same moment as the Enterprises bombers and attacked the '. Within minutes, three of the four Japanese carriers had been turned into burning hulks. The actual sinking of all four carriers was done by torpedoes from Japanese escort ships as the Japanese were unable to move their crippled carriers and did not want them to be captured. McClusky, for his vital contribution to the outcome of this pivotal battle, was awarded the Navy Cross. Later in World War II, he commanded the escort carrier . ==After the war== McClusky served in a variety of staff and shore positions in the later 1940s. During the Korean War, he was chief of staff to the commanders of the First and Seventh Fleets. He commanded Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois, in 1952–53, and the Boston Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet in 1954–56. McClusky retired from active duty in July 1956. At that time, in recognition of his vital contributions to the outcome of World War II, he was advanced to flag rank. ==Namesakes== was named in his honor.

MacDonald, an anti-semitic conspiracy theorist, white supremacist and a retired professor of evolutionary psychology. MacDonald claims that evolutionary psychology provides the motivations behind Jewish group behavior and culture. Through the series, MacDonald asserts that Jews as a group have biologically evolved to be highly ethnocentric and hostile to the interests of white people. He asserts Jewish behavior and culture are central causes of antisemitism, and promotes conspiracy theories about alleged Jewish control and influence in government policy and political movements. The overwhelming majority of academic and journalistic reviews of MacDonald's work have dismissed it as pseudoscience grounded in conspiracy theories, and replete with misrepresentations and cherry-picking of sources. The work is regarded as having been motivated by MacDonald's antisemitic bias, rather than being an honest product of academic research.MacDonald - Schatz: 2 of 3 The trilogy includes: * A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism As a Group Evolutionary Strategy, With Diaspora PeoplesMacDonald, K. B. A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism As a Group Evolutionary Strategy, With Diaspora Peoples, (Praeger 1994) * Separation and Its Discontents Toward an Evolutionary Theory of Anti-SemitismMacDonald, K.

B. The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements, (Praeger 1998) (Preface online ) ==Series== The first books constitute what is known as MacDonald's \\"trilogy.\\" In this trilogy he describes Judaism as a \\"group evolutionary strategy\\" to enhance the ability of Jews to out-compete non-Jews for resources. He argues that Judaism fosters in Jews a series of marked genetic traits, including above-average verbal intelligence and a strong tendency toward collectivist behavior. MacDonald also notes a negative shift in tone from the first book to the third, and attributes it to having learned more, read more, and \\"changed greatly\\" in that time. MacDonald's trilogy has been described as significant for \\"its potential to forge a standardized anti-Semitic critique in the far right.\\"George Michael, Professor Kevin MacDonald's critique of Judaism: legitimate scholarship or the intellectualization of anti-semitism?, Journal of Church and State September 22, 2006 The trilogy was followed by additional writings on the topic published by the Occidental Quarterly, a periodical MacDonald currently edits: *Understanding Jewish Influence: A Study in Ethnic ActivismMacDonald, K. B. Understanding Jewish Influence: A Study in Ethnic Activism, with an Introduction by white nationalist political writer Samuel T. Francis, (Occidental Quarterly November, 2004) Part1 Part2 Part3 *Can the Jewish Model Help the West Survive?TOQ-Kevin MacDonald-Model-Vol 4 No 4 ===A People that Shall Dwell Alone (1994)=== MacDonald describes Judaism as having or being a \\"group evolutionary strategy\\" aimed at limiting exogamy, enforcing cultural segregation, promoting in-group charity and economic cooperation, and regulating in-group marriage and births to achieve high levels of intelligence, ability to acquire resources, parenting care, and group allegiance. He examines evidence from Jewish history, culture, and genetics supporting his thesis, arguing that Judaism is based on a strong -- and possibly genetically based -- predisposition to ethnocentrism characteristic of Middle Eastern cultures generally but exacerbated as a result of selective effects resulting from Jewish cultural practices. He considers the use of the complex and extensive Jewish scriptures and the high prestige of Rabbinic learning as eugenic mechanisms for promoting Jewish verbal intelligence and dexterity. ===Separation and Its Discontents (1998)=== Developing his work in A People that Shall Dwell Alone, MacDonald examines antisemitism as a test case for an evolutionary analysis of ethnic conflict in general, applying social identity theory to three critical periods of institutionalized antisemitism: the Roman Empire in the fourth century; the Iberian inquisitions from the fourteenth century; and German Nazism in the period 1933-45. He argues that antisemitism can be analysed as a consequence of resource competition between groups in which each group is rationally pursuing its own interests, rather than as a manifestation of irrational malice by non-Jewish out-groups, and asserts that Jews, particularly strongly identified Jews, will be relatively prone to self-deception by ignoring or rationalizing negative information about themselves and their in-group. Finally, he discusses whether Judaism has ceased to be an evolutionary strategy because of the current levels of intermarriage among some groups of diaspora Jews, arguing that it has not ceased to be so and that it continues to flourish. ===The Culture of Critique (1998)=== MacDonald examines Boasian anthropology, political radicalism, psychoanalysis, the Frankfurt School, and The New York Intellectuals, arguing that Jews dominated these intellectual movements and that a strong sense of Jewish identity was characteristic of the great majority of the individuals in these movements. He argues that these individuals were pursuing a Jewish ethnic agenda in establishing and participating in these movements, while writing that the Jewish community does not constitute a unified movement and that only a small and elite minority of that community participated in these movements. He claims Jewish efforts to shape United States immigration policy were in opposition to what he sees as the interests of the peoples of non-Jewish European descent, particularly the peoples of Northern and Western Europe. He concludes the book by claiming that intellectual movements he examines are movements that are either \\"Jewish\\" by nature or Jewish-controlled, with baleful results: \\"the result has been a widening gulf between the cultural successes of Jews and Gentiles and a disaster for society as a whole.\\" Describing the evolution of his thinking over the course of his writing the trilogy, MacDonald says in his preface to the 2002 paperback edition of The Culture of Critique: > I think there is a noticeable shift in my tone from the first book to the > third simply because (I'd like to think) I knew a lot more and had read a > lot more. People often say after reading the first book that they think I > really admire Jews, but they are unlikely to say that about the last two and > especially about CofC. That is because by the time I wrote CofC I had > changed greatly from the person who wrote the first book.preface to the > paperback edition of The Culture of Critique ===Understanding Jewish Influence (2004)=== With an introduction by Samuel T. Francis, Understanding Jewish Influence outlines what MacDonald claims are the \\"background traits\\" of Jewish influence. To MacDonald these traits consist of: *Hyper-ethnocentrism *High verbal intelligence and consequent wealth *Psychological intensity *Social and political aggression He goes on to assert the influence of these traits upon current events concerning Zionism, neoconservatism, immigration, and Middle Eastern warfare waged by Western powers. ==Criticism== The series has been widely criticized by academics and researchers as antisemitic and scientifically unsupportable. Slate magazine carried an article by Judith Shulevitz, then Art and Entertainment editor of the Culturebox, entitled \\"Evolutionary Psychology's Anti-Semite,\\" continuing the discussion followed by an attempted rebuttal by MacDonald. According to Shulevitz, MacDonald's arguments are prescriptive: \\"Toward the end of the third book, MacDonald lays out his solution for restoring what he calls 'parity' between the Jews and other ethnic groups: systematic discrimination against Jews in college admission and employment and heavy taxation of Jews 'to counter the Jewish advantage in the possession of wealth'\\".Evolutionary Psychology's Anti-Semite - Judith Shulevitz - Slate Magazine MacDonald replied that in the actual passage from The Culture of Critique quoted by Shulevitz, he was speaking hypothetically of the consequences of competition between ethnic groups of differing abilities.quote Mark Potok of the Southern Poverty Law Center has said of MacDonald that \\"he put the anti-Semitism under the guise of scholarly work... Kevin MacDonald’s work is nothing but gussied-up anti-Semitism. At base it says that Jews are out to get us through their agenda... His work is bandied about by just about every neo-Nazi group in America.\\"CSULB Online 49er: volLIVno119: Academic dishonesty punished more leniently The Anti-Defamation League has included MacDonald in its list of American extremists, Extremism in America, and has written a reportKevin MacDonald, Extremism in America on his views and ties. According to the ADL, MacDonald's views on Jews mimic those of antisemites from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. ===Academic response=== In a letter to Slate magazine, Harvard University psychology professor Steven Pinker wrote: > The suggestion that scholars \\"can't ignore bad ideas\\" is a nonstarter. In > science there are a thousand bad ideas for every good one. \\"Doing battle\\" > against all of them is not an option for mere mortals, and doing battle > against some of them is a tacit acknowledgment that those have enough merit > to exceed the onerous threshold of attention-worthiness.

A paper by David Lieberman, a Holocaust researcher at Brandeis University, alleges that MacDonald has distorted evidence and chosen evidence selectively for rhetorical purposes.MacDonald - Schatz: 1 of 3 John Tooby, past president of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society and a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, insists that MacDonald is not an evolutionary psychologist, and that he advocates a generally discredited view of natural selection. Tooby, the founder of MacDonald's field of evolutionary psychology, criticized MacDonald in an article for the Salon website in 2000: \\"MacDonald's ideas—not just on Jews—violate fundamental principles of the field\\". Reviewing MacDonald's A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy in The Jewish Quarterly Review, Sander Gilman, professor of the Liberal Arts and Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago describes MacDonald's arguments about a Jewish group evolutionary strategy as \\"bizarre\\". According to Gilman, \\"MacDonald recasts all of the hoary old myths about Jewish psychological difference and its presumed link to Jewish superior intelligence in contemporary sociobiological garb\\". Gilman also charges that \\"MacDonald manipulates his sources rather shamelessly\\", including Gilman's own work. Gilman concludes that MacDonald's book \\"is the most recent chapter in the continued myth-building concerning Jewish superior intelligence and achievement. It is, like the numerous earlier works, of interest in how positive images turn into the means by which Jewish difference is stressed and Jewish acculturation is shown to be pathological\\". Reviewing Macdonald's A People That Shall Dwell Alone in the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Eugen Schoenfeld, Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Georgia State University, commented that \\"the book is controversial, not only because of its theoretical approach, but also, and perhaps primarily, because of sloppy scholarship\\". Schoenfeld writes that Macdonald \\"selects historical incidents that can be used to support his thesis and conveniently omits others that challenge his thesis\\". Schoenfeld points to what he sees as Macdonald's \\"unfamiliarity with both the sociological frame of reference and historical knowledge\\", and as an example, notes that Macdonald's comparison of Jewish collectivism during the biblical period with eighteenth- and nineteenth- century English individualism \\"indicates a total ignorance of the impact of industrialization on Western societies\\".Eugen Schoenfeld. Review: A People That Shall Dwell Alone: Judaism as a Group Evolutionary Strategy by Kevin MacDonald. Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. Vol. 34, No. 3 (Sep., 1995):408-410. On the other hand, Laurence Loeb of the University of Utah, writing for the Jewish Folklore and Ethnology Review in 1997, gave A People That Shall Dwell Alone a mostly positive review, calling it a \\"tour-de-force\\" that, despite containing \\"quite a number of errors, some of them glaring\\", nonetheless represented a \\"watershed contribution to the understanding of Judaism and Jewish life\\" based on a \\"cautious, careful assembling of evidence\\".Jewish Folklore and Ethnology Review, 19(1-2), 36-38, 1997. Reviewing Macdonald's Separation and Its Discontents in the American Jewish Society Review in 2000, Zev Garber, Professor of Jewish Studies at Los Angeles Valley College, wrote that MacDonald works from the assumption that the dual Torah is the blueprint of the eventual Jewish dominion over the world and that he sees contemporary antisemitism, the Holocaust, and attacks against Israel as \\"provoked by Jews themselves. In this scenario, Jews imagine themselves as innocent victims of hatred and violence.\\" Garber concludes that Macdonald's \\"rambling who-is-who-isn't roundup of Jews responsible for the 'Jewish Problem' borders on the irrational and is conducive to misrepresentation\\".Seth Garber.

Daniel Kriegman, an evolutionary psychologist, produced a 50-page analysis criticizing MacDonald's work as \\"pseudo-scientific theorizing\\", although it does not appear that he ever published it: he did send it to MacDonald, who has since responded. He wrote that MacDonald \\"believes his own nonsense\\". Kriegman remarked in an email, \\"MacDonald is not the first person to avoid the narcissistic injury of having his ideas rejected by concluding that there was a conspiracy against him rather than becoming aware of the substandard nature [as evidenced in his trilogy] of his thinking.\\"Heidi Beirich: Promoting Hate - California Professor is Font of Anti-Semitism. Southern Poverty Law Center. Spring 2007. Retrieved on 2007-09-04. A history professor at MacDonald's university, Don Schwarz, called MacDonald's claims about Jewish history \\"unsupportable\\". Philosophy Professor Warren Weinstein said that MacDonald's work was not science at all, but \\"something else, masquerading as science\\": and that \\"It is in the great tradition of Nazi and Stalinist science which clearly and scientifically proved that their respective insanities were objectively true and defensible.\\" Academic Jaff Schatz has accused MacDonald of misrepresenting and misusing his work.David Lieberman: Scholarship as an Exercise in Rhetorical Strategy: A Case Study of Kevin MacDonald's Research Techniques.

John Hartung, the former associate editor of the Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology and an associate professor of anesthesiology at the State University of New York, said that MacDonald's The Culture of Critique was \\"quite disturbing, seriously misinformed about evolutionary genetics, and suffering from a huge blind spot about the nature of Christianity\\". In a 2000 review in the journal Shofar, reviewer Jefferson A. Singer wrote that he considered the book to be \\"written out of a deep and destructive hatred for Jews\\", and questioned the editorial policy of the books' publisher, Praeger, in \\"bringing a book of such dubious scientific merit to a larger audience and in giving it an air of legitimacy it does not deserve\\".Jefferson A. Singer. Review of Separation and its discontents by Kevin McDonald. Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies, 2000;Vol 19, Issue 2. In March 2018, Nathan Cofnas, a philosophy graduate student at the University of Oxford, published a critique of MacDonald's theory in the journal Human Nature where he concluded that MacDonald relied \\"on systematically misrepresented sources and cherry-picked facts\\". The paper was popular, being downloaded more in a single month than the rest of the journal's articles typically get in a full year. Cofnas' article prompted a response defending MacDonald from Edward Dutton, a theologian and anthropologist affiliated with the Ulster Institute for Social Research. Dutton's response was rejected by Human Nature, and was instead published by Evolutionary Psychological Science. The attention prompted by Cofnas's paper was itself commented on. Anthropologist Robert Boyd of the Arizona State described the topic itself as \\"totally toxic\\", Steven Pinker described MacDonald's and Dutton's arguments as \\"extraordinarily weak\\", while Aryeh Tuchman of the Anti-Defamation League said that the renewed attention falsely implied that MacDonald's antisemitic tropes have academic legitimacy. ==See also== *Dominant minority *Middleman minority *Ethnocentrism *Model minority *Scientific racism == References == ==External links== *\\"The Marx of the anti-Semites\\" – critical review by John Derbyshire in The American Conservative. *\\"The Conservatism of Fools\\" – MacDonald's reply to Derbyshire's review *John Derbyshire's comments on responses to his review *\\"Jews Will Be Jews: A Scientific Racialism for the 21st Century\\" – critical review by David Isadore Lieberman.

He was previously Minister of Information and Publicity from 2000 to 2005 and again from 2013 to 2015. He was elected to the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe as an independent candidate in 2005 and 2008. He is considered the core architect of the AIPPA and POSA restrictive legislation. ==Kenya== In 1993 he was program director for the Ford Foundation in Nairobi. He departed under a cloud after allegations that he had embezzled US$88,000 from the organisation. As of 2018 he was still under indictment in Kenya. ==South Africa== In January 1998 he moved to South Africa, to the University of Witwatersrand (WITS) to work on a project entitled The Future of the African Elite sponsored by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. WITS later claimed that he had absconded with part of a 100 million rand research grant for the project.

Swarns, \\"Vote in Zimbabwe Shows Opposition Making Big Gains\\", The New York Times, 27 June 2000. ===Minister of Information and Publicity (2000-2005)=== During his 2000 to 2005 tenure, he crafted and defended, helped by Patrick Chinamasa, the Broadcasting Services Act (BSA) (2001), the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (Commercialisation) Act (2003),\\"Moyo blows Charamba's cover\\" , The Financial Gazette, 28 July 2005 (accessed 2 July 2008) the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) (2002), the Public Order and Security Act (2002), and the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (Commercialisation) Act (2003). This led to widespread criticism that he was attacking freedom of speech. When Moyo brought the AIPPA to parliament, the chairman of the Parliamentary Legal Committee, Dr Eddison Zvobgo, said, \\"I can say without equivocation that this Bill, in its original form, was the most calculated and determined assault on our liberties guaranteed by the Constitution, in the 20 years I served as Cabinet minister.\\" Since being expelled from government, he has denied and rejected outright that he was the architect of these laws. As Minister of Information, Moyo fought personal and government battles with the media from July 2000 until 2005, when he was expelled from ZANU-PF.\\"Mugabe's rule close to a 'nasty, short and brutish' end, says former right-hand man\\", The Guardian, 28 March 2007 (accessed 2 July 2008)\\"Why Give Jonathan Moyo Time and Space\\" , Association of Zimbabwe Journalists, 20 September 2006 (accessed 7 February 2008)\\"MoyoWas It Perostroika or a Palace Coup in Tsholotsho\\" , Africanewsflash\\"Propaganda chief who turned Zimbabwe into 'Planet Moyo'\\", The Telegraph, 23 January 2003 (accessed 2 July 2008)\\"Moyo eyes Tsholotsho\\" , The Insider, 2003 (accessed 2 July 2008)\\"Jonathan Moyo sued for $25 mln\\" , The Financial Gazette, 17 June 2004\\"We have forgiven Moyo but have not forgotten\\", The Zimbabwe Times He beamed with pleasure and satisfaction when Chief Justice Gubbay resigned after being threatened by Joseph Chinotimba and company. When the Daily News was shut down, he said \\"The Daily News is a victim of the rule of law which it had been preaching since 1999.\\" In the mere space of seven years, Moyo went from being a fervent critic of the government of Robert Mugabe to being its fiercest defender and then again to being one of its foremost critics, a fact that renders him a mystery to many Zimbabweans. Analysts and observers and ordinary people have labelled him an opportunist because of this puzzling behaviour, including George Charamba, his former friend and ally. He has said: \\"I have always been a critic of government policy. I was in government for more than five years.

Earlier, in February 2004, the commercial farms that Moyo had received in the Zimbabwe land redistribution had been placed on the SDN list. ===2017 coup d'état and aftermath=== On 19 November 2017, Moyo was expelled from ZANU–PF by the party's central committee. Other prominent G40 politicians, including Grace Mugabe, Saviour Kasukuwere, Patrick Zhuwao, Ignatius Chombo, Walter Mzembi, Shadreck Mashayamombe, Makhosini Hlongwane, Innocent Hamandishe, Samuel Undenge, and Sarah Mahoka were also expelled from the party. Moyo fled the country after his removal, and from his unknown location threatened bloodshed if Mugabe was not restored to power. Even while a cabinet minister, Moyo was charged with corruption, and following his ouster investigations resumed. The main charges are that Moyo improperly used Zimdef (Zimbabwe Manpower Development Fund) funds for political patronage in his home district of Tsholotsho. In his defense, Moyo claimed that he did not convert the money for his own use, and that Tsholotsho, being one of the poorest Zimbabwean districts, deserved the largess. ==Tsholotsho== His philanthropy, including scholarship programs and support for sport over many years, has earned Moyo a respected place in Tsholotsho, his family area. This philanthropy increased during the days leading up to the March 2005 parliamentary election, a fact that critics feel made his win for the parliamentary seat in the area inevitable. In the lead-up to the 2004 party meeting, he held an unofficial meeting in Tsholotsho, of Zanu-PF political heavyweights including six provincial party chairmen, Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa, and a militant war veterans' leader, Joseph Chinotimba. It was aimed at contesting one of the two vice-presidential seats after the recent death of Simon Muzenda on 20 September 2003, seen as a stepping stone to the presidency in light of Mugabe's presumed retirement in 2008. He was heavily censured at the later Zanu-PF meeting, with other attendees. Joyce Mujuru won the vice-presidency at the party meeting. The subsequent decision to set aside the Tsholotsho seat in the 2005 parliamentary election for female candidates was widely interpreted as punishing those who organised the unauthorised meeting, and in particular Moyo. In February 2005 Moyo registered to run as an independent for the seat.\\"Mugabe's spin doctor to go solo\\", BBC News, 19 February 2005 Doing so earned the wrath of Mugabe, who expelled him from the party and the cabinet. He won the seat in the elections, held on 31 March.\\"Mugabe 'can change constitution'\\", BBC News, 2 April 2005. Standing again as an independent, Moyo was re-elected to the House of Assembly from Tsholotsho North constituency in the March 2008 parliamentary election. He received 3,532 votes, defeating MDC candidate Mgezelwa Ncube, who received 3,305 votes, as well as Zanu-PF candidate Alice Dube, who received 2,085 votes.\\"Zimbabwe election results 2008\\" , newzimbabwe.com, 2 April 2008. He was the first independent candidate in Zimbabwe to ever win re-election.Lindie Whiz, \\"Outright Tsvangirai or Mugabe victory unlikelyMoyo\\" , newzimbabwe.com, 1 April 2008. The mainstream MDC did not field a candidate in this constituency on the understanding that Moyo's victory would be good in the fight to remove Mugabe from power. However, no sooner had Moyo won did he start taking potshots at the MDC and openly defending and supporting Mugabe in newspaper articles. Some say he was angling for a cabinet position, something that did not happen. Moyo was defeated in Tsholotsho North constituency by the MDC-T's Roselene Nkomo in elections which took place on 31 July 2013. Moyo tried to force through a recount of the votes but his attempt was blocked when Bulawayo High Court judge Justice Lawrence Kamocha barred the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) from conducting a vote recount in the constituency without an order of such effect from the Electoral Court and finalisation of the application of review. Despite Moyo's defeat, Mugabe appointed him as Minister of Information on 10 September 2013. Mugabe fiercely criticised Moyo in June 2014, saying that Moyo was \\"plant[ing] seeds of division\\" in ZANU-PF by attacking his opponents within the party through the media. According to Mugabe, Moyo had appointed newspaper editors sympathetic to the opposition.

After two years as Minister of Information, and after winning a by-election in Bulawayo on 6 June 2015, Moyo was moved to the post of Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education on 6 July 2015.\\"Chombo, Moyo, Tyson reassigned\\", The Herald, 7 July 2015. In that position he had control over Zimdef funds which he used for various purposes in Tsholotsho including funding Zanu PF political rallies and the purchase of bicycles that he distributed to political workers. ==Education== Moyo attended the University of Zimbabwe and the University of Southern California.

In 2005, journalist and agronomist Asher Tarivona Mutsengi, then a student leader at Solusi University, criticised Moyo saying \\"... he will go down in the annals of history as a minister who lacked foresight and for pouring vitriol against his perceived opponents, his shopping spree in South Africa of scarce foodstuffs, causing unemployment to a multitude of journalists and a penchant for uncivilized propaganda.\\" He went on to say, \\"... my final analysis is that he is heading for the precipice and his political prospects even if he wins the Tsholotsho seat that he is vying for as an independent are drab. He might be a spin-doctor and intelligent as some claim, but I don't subscribe to that myself.\\"-Student Leader says Moyo the worst politician in Zimbabwe Innocent Madawo, a Zimbabwean journalist and columnist for the Toronto Sun newspaper said in an interview about Moyo, \\"If it were not for Jonathan Moyo I would not be here and I am sure I am not the only one who feels like this. Even those who may have been showered with favours by the good professor, I know for certain that they too were burdened by his attentions and demands and right now, a lot are embarrassed that they ever knew him.\\" ===Columnist=== In recent times since parting ways with Mugabe, Jonathan Moyo has written for some online news publications critical of Mugabe's government. Ironically, most of the editors of these publications are victims of media laws supported or sponsored by Moyo during his days as information minister. He seems to have been embraced and given a platform to express his anger at the government of Mugabe.\\"Why Mugabe should go now\\" , Zimbabwe Independent, 29 November 2006 ==Wikileaks== In May 2011, Moyo sued the Daily News for US$60,000 for reprinting former articles about his expulsion from Zanu-PF in 2005. He rejoined later. In September he sued the paper again, this time for a 6 September report which cited a 2007 US diplomatic cable in which Moyo voiced support for sanctions against President Robert Mugabe. In a follow-up article the next day it reported that Moyo had suggested which senior members of the party should be targeted by sanctions.Zimbabwe politician sues paper over WikiLeaks revelations Guardian ==Quotes== ===General=== \\"Perennial wisdom from divine revelation and human experience dictates that all earthly things great or small, beautiful or ugly, good or bad, sad or happy, foolish or wise must finally come to an end.

He was born in the island of St Thomas in the Danish West Indies, where his father was French consul. Together with his elder brother Charles he was educated in Paris at the collège Rollin. In 1844, having graduated as a doctor of medicine and doctor of science, he was appointed to organize the new faculty of science at Besançon, where he acted as dean and professor of chemistry from 1845 to 1851. Returning to Paris in the latter year he succeeded Antoine Jérôme Balard at the École Normale, and in 1859 became professor at the Sorbonne in place of J. B. A. Dumas, for whom he had begun to lecture in 1853. He died at Boulogne-sur-Seine. In 1841, he began his experiments with investigations of oil of turpentine and tolu balsam, in the course of which he discovered toluene. But his most important work was perhaps in inorganic and thermal chemistry. In 1849 he discovered anhydrous nitric acid (nitrogen pentoxide), a substance interesting as the first obtained of the so-called \\"anhydrides\\" of the monobasic acids. In 1854, he succeeded in obtaining metallic aluminium, and ultimately he devised a method by which the metal could be prepared on a large scale by the aid of sodium, the manufacture of which he also developed. Together with Friedrich Wöhler, he discovered silicon nitride in 1857. With Jules Henri Debray (1827–1888) he worked at the platinum metals, his object being on the one hand to prepare them pure, and on the other to find a suitable metal for the standard metre for the International Metric Commission then sitting at Paris. With Louis Joseph Troost (born 1825) he devised a method for determining vapour densities at temperatures up to 1400˚C, and, partly with F. Wöhler, he investigated the allotropic forms of silicon and boron. The artificial preparation of minerals, especially of apatite and isorhor-phous minerals and of crystalline oxides, was another subject in which he made many experiments. But his best known contribution to general chemistry is his work on the phenomena of reversible reactions, which he comprehended under a general theory of \\"dissociation.\\" He first took up the subject about 1857, and it was in the course of his investigations on it that he devised the apparatus known as the \\"Deville hot and cold tube.\\" In 1885, the rue Sainte-Claire-Deville in the 12th arrondissement de Paris was named in his honour. == See also == * History of aluminium == Selected publications == * \\"De l'aluminium et de ses combinaisons chimiques\\", Comptes-rendus de l'Académie des sciences (1854), article analysé sur le site BibNum. * \\"Mémoire sur la fabrication du sodium et de l'aluminium\\", Annales de chimie et de physique, 46 (1856), 415-58 * \\"De l'aluminium, ses propriétés, sa fabrication et ses applications\\", 1 vol., in-8°, Paris, Mallet-Bachelier, 1859,176 pages * \\"L'état naissant des corps\\", la Revue scientifique, 22 janvier 1870. * \\"L'internat dans l'éducation\\", la Revue scientifique, 2 septembre 1871. ==References== *Catholic Encyclopedia article * * * Category:1818 births Category:1881 deaths Category:University of Paris faculty Category:French chemists Category:Members of the Société Ramond Category:People from Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands Category:École Normale Supérieure faculty Category:Burials at Père Lachaise Cemetery ","title":"Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville"},{"id":"1440716","text":"Jonas Valley between Crawinkel and Arnstadt Jonastal (Jonas Valley), situated in the Ilm-Kreis district in Germany between Crawinkel and Arnstadt and near to the town of Ohrdruf, was a scene of military construction under the National Socialist regime during the last years of the Second World War. Thousands of prisoners from the Buchenwald concentration camp under the command of SS General Hans Kammler were forced to dig 25 tunnels into the surrounding mountain and the whole operation was performed under the strictest secrecy. The site was not completed and construction was abandoned before the end of the war. The exact aim of the operation remains uncertain although it is now believed to have been either a potential final headquarters for the führer Adolf Hitler, a military communications post or a possible center for V-2 rocket and Wunderwaffe weapon production and research. The latter is given some credence by the fact that SS General Hans Kammler was in overall charge of the construction efforts. Ohrdruf, its forced labour camp and the nearby Jonas Valley were captured by American troops on April 4, 1945, by the 4th Armored Division and the 89th Infantry Division. The camp was the first Nazi concentration camp liberated by the U.S. Army. At the end of the war, the Soviet Army, which took over the site from the Americans, immediately classified it as a restricted zone and then used it as a military training ground. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the site was taken over by the German armed forces who continue to use the area. ==Rumours== In 1962, East German officials interviewed contemporary witness who claimed to have sighted atomic weapons tests on the training ground in March 1945. Cläre Werner, for example, a former administrator of the adjacent Veste Wachsenburg who is now deceased, assured officials that she had seen a glowing light, as bright \\"as hundreds of bolts of lightning,\\" red inside and yellow on the outside, at approximately 9:30 p.m. on March 4, 1945. Werner went on to describe how a powerful squall had moved across the mountains. The next day, she said, she and others in the areas had had nosebleeds, headaches, and sensations of pressure in their ears. She also claimed that she had heard another loud noise on March 12 at 10:15 p.m. A book by Rainer Karlsch, Hitlers Bombe, published in 2005, alleges that Kurt Diebner's team tested some type of nuclear related device in Ohrdruf, which is very close to Jonastal. Moreover, Ohrdruf is located at the end of the hill, which starts at Jonas Valley and where there are still the remains of excavations and blocked tunnels. Ohrdruf itself is located at almost the same elevation as the excavation site. It is suggested that there were tunnel exits somewhere around Ohrdruf too. The existence of easy transportation links and a railway in Ohrdruf may support this approach. Documents on which Karlsch's book is based shed light on the motivations of the German scientists working on the paths of nuclear reactors and isotope separation; the historian of science Mark Walker also published his analysis in 2005. The area has also been searched for the legendary Amber Room. The Amber Room was located in the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg. It was a spectacularly beautiful room sometimes called the \\"Eighth Wonder of the world.\\" The Amber Room was looted during World War II by Nazi Germany and brought to Königsberg. Knowledge of its whereabouts was lost in the chaos at the end of the war. ==Current status== Jonas Valley Memorial Jonastal itself remains within a military training area and entry is strictly prohibited. This, however, does not prevent the site from being regularly visited by explorers and would-be treasure hunters who risk arrest and a fine if caught. Monuments have been erected in Jonastal and nearby and are dedicated to the victims of the nearby Ohrdruf camp. ==See also== *Project Riese, a set of seven unfinished Nazi-era underground works in southwest Poland *Weingut I, an incomplete underground facility for manufacturing the Junkers Jumo 004 jet engine ==Literature== * Rainer Karlsch - Hitlers Bombe (March 2005) * John Douglas-Gray in his thriller The Novak Legacy (June 2011) ==References== ==External links== * *Photographs of the Jonanstal site *German Spiegel article in English *US article regarding Jonastal rumours Category:Research and development in Nazi Germany Category:Nazi subterranea Category:Valleys of Thuringia ","title":"Jonas Valley"},{"id":"1440723","text":"Pinking may refer to: *Engine knocking, the noise indicative of improper combustion in internal combustion engines *Pinking shears *An alternative name for pargeting ==See also== *Pinky (disambiguation) ","title":"Pinking"},{"id":"1440724","text":"Terje \\"Valfar\\" Bakken (3 September 1978 – 14 January 2004) was the lead singer and founder of the Norwegian black metal band Windir. Windir was started as a one-man project, but it was expanded into a full band with the release of their third album, 1184. Valfar originally sang his lyrics in Sognamål, a dialect of Norwegian, but eventually switched to English in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience. ==Biography== Terje was born and grew up in Sogndal which he was very proud of and one can clearly see the importance of Sogndal in his lyrics. Terje decided to form Windir into a full band while he was at college, with some of his classmates becoming the other band members. Valfar released two demos, Sogneriket and Det Gamle Riket. His second studio album, Arntor, was the last Windir album recorded by a line-up consisting solely of Valfar. Despite his vocal style, Valfar did not relate his music to black metal, probably because of how the scene acted and was stereotyped. He instead dubbed Windir's musical style as \\"Sognametal\\". Other bands that have a Sognametal sound are Cor Scorpii, Vreid, Feigd, Mistur, and Sigtyr. He read a lot about Sogndal history that his poems stemmed from it. ===Death=== On 14 January 2004 Valfar went for a walk towards his family's cabin at Fagereggi, but he never arrived. Three days later, authorities found his body at Reppastølen in the Sogndal Valley. Valfar had been caught in a snow storm and died from hypothermia.

He is a member of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2003. He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Perlmutter shared the 2006 Shaw Prize in Astronomy, the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, and the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics with Brian P. Schmidt and Adam Riess for providing evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. ==Education== Saul Perlmutter was born one of three children in the Ashkenazi Jewish family of Daniel D. Perlmutter, professor emeritus of chemical and biomolecular engineering at University of Pennsylvania, and Felice (Feige) D. Perlmutter (née Davidson), professor emerita of Temple University’s School of Social Administration. His maternal grandfather, the Yiddish teacher Samuel Davidson (1903–1989), emigrated to Canada (and then with his wife Chaika Newman to New York) from the Bessarabian town of Floreşti in 1919. Perlmutter spent his childhood in the Mount Airy neighborhood of Philadelphia. He went to school in nearby Germantown; first Greene Street Friends School for the elementary grades, followed by Germantown Friends School for grades 7 through 12. He graduated with an AB in physics from Harvard magna cum laude in 1981 and received his PhD in physics from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1986. Perlmutter's PhD thesis titled \\"An Astrometric Search for a Stellar Companion to the Sun\\" described the development and use of an automated telescope to search for Nemesis candidates under Richard A. Muller. At the same time, he was using this telescope to search for Nemesis and supernovae, which would lead him to his award-winning work in cosmology. Perlmutter attributes the idea for an automated supernova search to Luis Alvarez, a 1968 Nobel laureate, who shared his idea with Perlmutter's research adviser. ==Work== Perlmutter heads the Supernova Cosmology Project at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It was this team along with the competing High-z Supernova Search Team led by Riess and Schmidt, which found evidence of the accelerating expansion of the universe based on observing Type Ia supernova in the distant universe. Type Ia supernova occurs whenever a white dwarf star gains enough additional mass to pass above the Chandrasekhar limit, usually by stealing additional mass from a companion star. Since all Type Ia supernovae are believed to occur in essentially the same way, they form a standard candle whose intrinsic luminosity can be assumed to be approximately the same in all cases. By measuring the apparent luminosity of the explosion from Earth, researchers can then infer the distance to supernova. Comparing this inferred distance to the apparent redshift of the explosion allows the observer to measure both the distance and relative velocity of the supernova. The Supernova Cosmology Project concluded that these distant supernovae were receding more quickly than would be expected due to the Hubble expansion alone, and, by inference, the expansion of the universe must have been accelerated over the billions of years since the supernovae occurred. The High-z Team also came to a similar conclusion. The two teams' reports were published within weeks of each other, and their conclusions were readily accepted by the scientific community due to corroborating theories. This conclusion has subsequently been supported by other lines of evidence. These findings reinvigorated research into the nature of the universe, and especially into the role of dark energy. For this work Perlmutter was awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, shared jointly with Riess and Schmidt. Perlmutter is also a lead investigator in the Supernova/Acceleration Probe project, which aims to build a satellite dedicated to finding and studying more supernovae in the distant universe. The goal is to more precisely determine the rate at which the universe has been accelerating. He is also a participant in the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project, which aims to increase our understanding of recent global warming through improved analyses of climate data. Perlmutter is a professor and currently teaches at UC Berkeley. ==Awards and recognition== Perlmutter, Adam Riess, and Brian P. Schmidt being awarded the 2006 Shaw Prize in Astronomy. The trio would later be awarded the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Perlmutter presenting his Nobel lecture at Aula Magna In 2002, Perlmutter won the Department of Energy's E. O. Lawrence Award in Physics. In 2003, he was awarded the California Scientist of the Year Award, and, in 2005, he won the John Scott Award and the Padua Prize. In 2006, he shared the Shaw Prize in Astronomy with Adam Riess and Brian P. Schmidt. The same year, Perlmutter won the Antonio Feltrinelli International Prize. Perlmutter and his team shared the 2007 Gruber Cosmology Prize (a $500,000 award) with Schmidt and the High-Z Team for discovering the accelerating expansion of the universe. In 2010, Perlmutter was named a Miller Senior Fellow of the Miller Institute at the University of California Berkeley. In 2011, Perlmutter and Riess were named co-recipients of the Albert Einstein Medal. Perlmutter shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics with Riess and Schmidt. The Nobel Prize includes a SEK 10 million cash award (approximately US$1.5 million). Perlmutter received one- half of the cash prize, while Riess and Schmidt shared the other half. In 2014, Perlmutter received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Perlmutter, Schmidt, Riess and their teams shared the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics with $3 million to be split among them. A United States Department of Energy 2020 supercomputer is named Perlmutter in his honor. ==Family== Saul Perlmutter has two sisters: Shira Perlmutter (b. 1956), a lawyer, and Tova Perlmutter (b. 1967), a nonprofit executive. He is married to Laura Nelson, an anthropologist at University of California, Berkeley, and has one daughter, Noa. ==Popular culture== Reference to Saul Perlmutter was made on the CBS television comedy series The Big Bang Theory during the 2011 episode \\"The Speckerman Recurrence\\". In the episode, the character Sheldon Cooper watches the Nobel award ceremony on his laptop, and jealously berates Perlmutter: \\"Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there, clutching that Nobel prize. What's the matter Saul, you afraid somebody's going to steal it? Like you stole Einstein's cosmological constant?\\" Then later: \\"Oh, now Perlmutter's shaking the King's hand. Yeah, check for your watch, Gustaf, he might have lifted it.\\" Perlmutter was also referenced in the 2011 episode of The Big Bang Theory, \\"The Rhinitis Revelation\\". In a conversation with his mother, Sheldon says, \\"I’ve got a treat for us tomorrow, Mom. I’m taking you to see Saul Perlmutter give a lecture about his Nobel Prize-winning work in cosmology. And the best part is, at the Q and A afterward, I’ve worked up a couple of Q’s that will stump his sorry A.\\" Later in the episode, Sheldon criticises the lecture and questions the decision to award Perlmutter a Nobel Prize. ==Technical reports and conference/event proceedings== * Perlmutter, S., et al. \\"Progress Report on the Berkeley/Anglo- Australian Observatory High-redshift Supernova Search\\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (November 1990). * Perlmutter, S., et al. \\"Discovery of the Most Distant Supernovae and the Quest for {Omega}\\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (May 1994). * Perlmutter, S., et al. \\"Discovery of a Supernova Explosion at Half the Age of the Universe and its Cosmological Implications\\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (December 16, 1997). * Perlmutter, S., et al. \\"The Distant Type Ia Supernova Rate\\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (May 28, 2002). * Perlmutter, S., et al. \\"The Supernova Legacy Survey: Measurement of Omega_M, Omega_Lambda, and w from the First Year Data Set\\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (October 14, 2005). * Perlmutter, S. \\"Supernovae, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Universe: How DOE Helped to Win (yet another) Nobel Prize\\", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, (January 13, 2012). ==See also== * List of Jewish Nobel laureates * Cosmological constant * Dark energy * Dark matter ==References== ==External links== *Supernova Cosmology Project Website *Supernova Cosmology Project *Shaw Prize Press Release * *Nobel Prize in Physics Press Release *List of scholarly publications as provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) abstract server.

Although the precise form varies, it is essentially relatively 'free-form' fighting, with enough rules, customs, or agreements to minimize injuries. By extension, argumentative debate is sometimes called sparring. ==Differences between styles== The physical nature of sparring naturally varies with the nature of the skills it is intended to develop; sparring in a striking art such as Chun Kuk Do will normally begin with the players at opposite sides of the ring and will be given a point for striking the appropriate area and will be given a foul for striking an inappropriate area or stepping out of the ring. Sparring in a grappling art such as judo might begin with the partners holding one another and end if they separate. The organization of sparring matches also varies; if the participants know each other well and are friendly, it may be sufficient for them to simply play, without rules, referee, or timer. If the sparring is between strangers, there is some emotional tension, or if the sparring is being evaluated, it may be appropriate to introduce formal rules and have an experienced martial artist supervise or referee the match. WTF taekwondo sparring match In some schools, permission to begin sparring is granted upon entry. The rationale for this decision is that students must learn how to deal with a fast, powerful, and determined attacker. In other schools, students may be required to wait a few months, for safety reasons, because they must first build the skills they would ideally employ in their sparring practice. Sparring is normally distinct from fights in competition, the goal of sparring normally being the education of the participants. == Use and sport== The educational role of sparring is a matter of some debate. In any sparring match, precautions of some sort must be taken to protect the participants. These may include wearing protective gear, declaring certain techniques and targets off-limits, playing slowly or at a fixed speed, forbidding certain kinds of trickery, or one of many other possibilities. These precautions have the potential to change the nature of the skill that is being learned. For example, if one were to always spar with heavily padded gloves, one might come to rely on techniques that risk breaking bones in one's hand. Many schools recognize this problem but value sparring nonetheless because it forces the student to improvise, to think under pressure, and to keep their emotions under control. The level of contact is also debated, lighter contact may lead to less injuries but hard contact may better prepare individuals for competition or self-defense. Some sport styles, such as sanda, taekwondo, tang soo do, Kyokushin kaikan, kūdō, karate, kendo, and mixed martial arts use full contact sparring, though some of them, such as taekwondo (WT) and kendo make use of full-body protective gear. == Brazilian Jiu Jitsu == Brazilian Jiu Jitsu sparring is full contact and injuries are rare as it does not involve striking but rather forcing the opponent to submit using grappling techniques. == MMA == There is much controversy in mixed martial arts about the benefits of full contact sparring vs career threatening injuries. Former Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter Jamie Varner came to an early retirement because he had much head trauma in full contact sparring. UFC former welterweight champions Robbie Lawler and Johny Hendricks don't do full contact sparring. == Names and types == Sparring has different names and different forms in various schools. Some schools prefer not to call it sparring, as they feel it differs in kind from what is normally called sparring. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners 'Rolling' * In Western fencing, including historical fencing, the combat is called in English \\"free play,\\" \\"sparring,\\" the \\"assault,\\" or simply \\"fencing,\\" depending on the form of fencing studied. * In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu sparring is commonly called rolling. * In boxing, sparring is commonly called sparring. * In capoeira, the closest analogue to sparring is jogo (playing in the roda). * In Chinese martial arts, sparring is usually trained at first as individual applications, eventually combined as freestyle training of long, medium and short range techniques. See sanshou, pushing hands. * In many Japanese martial arts, a grappling-type sparring activity is usually called randori. **In judo, this is essentially one-on-one sparring. **In most forms of aikido it is a formalized form of sparring where one aikidoka defends against many attackers. * In karate, sparring is called kumite (組手), see also randori. * In kūdō it is called sparring * In taekwondo, sparring is called kyorugi by the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) or matsogi by the International Taekwon-Do Federation (ITF). **In the WTF, the majority of the attacks executed are kicking techniques, whereas the ITF encourages the use of both hands and feet. The ITF does not always spar with head guards, but it is known to occur in some organizations practicing this form. * In silat, the act of sparring may either be referred to as berpencak or bersilat. Another form of competition is silat pulut in which the pracitioners take turns reversing each other's moves. * In the Indian martial art, Shastarvidya, sparring is done in the form of martial games called Sonchi. The level changes from indicating strikes, to touches and in advanced level, landing full contact blows. However, caution is always maintained in order to avoid any kind of injury or trauma. ==See also== Aliveness (martial arts) ==References== Category:Mock combat ","title":"Sparring"},{"id":"1440756","text":"The Thunder 380 is a lightweight, relatively small semi-automatic pistol series chambered in the popular .380 ACP caliber made by Argentine firearms manufacturer Bersa, S.A. It is similar in design to the compact Beretta 70 pistol, but also with design features in common with the Walther PPK; although it sells for about half the price of a PPK. ==Development== The Thunder 380 is part of the current Bersa product lineup that also includes the Thunder 32, Thunder 22, Thunder 22-6, Thunder 32, Thunder 380 Deluxe, Thunder 9, Mini Thunder 9, Mini Thunder 40, and Mini Thunder 45. A light variant of the Thunder 380, called the 'Concealed Carry' model (or 380CC), and a 15-round capable \\"Bersa Thunder 380 plus\\" were released by Bersa in the United States, and variants 'Firestorm 380' and 'Firestorm 22' are sold by Firestorm SGS of New Jersey; assembled from parts manufactured by Bersa. ==Intended market== The Thunder 380 is suited for concealed carry due to its small size and rounded trigger guard. One reviewer calls it \\"very easy to maintain\\". The Thunder 380 is quite popular in many South American countries, where the .380 ACP is often the most powerful cartridge allowed to civilians. A number of military and law enforcement forces have included Bersa 380s in their inventory, including the Ecuadorian Air Force. ==Design advantages== The Thunder 380 has a light aluminum alloy frame that reduces weight for easier carry, yet the pistol still retains enough mass (weight) to help tame recoil. Due to the small frame, the pistol is very well suited for female shooters, and males with smaller hands. The magazines, however are designed with an extra section of grip, so that all fingers of the firing hand are accommodated. The blowback, fixed-barrel design theoretically aids accuracy, and it appears that the vast majority of Thunder 380 users report favorably on that issue. The nearly straight-in alignment of the chamber and the topmost cartridge in the magazine seems to be responsible for the pistol's reliable chambering and cycling. The frame features a long rearward tang over the grips, which effectively protects the shooter's thumb web from hammer-bite or slide-bite. There are several safety features built into the Thunder 380: a slide mounted manual safety and decocker that blocks the hammer, a magazine disconnect safety that prevents firing if a magazine is not inserted, a long double-action (DA) first trigger pull, an inertial firing pin, and (in some models) an integral key-operated trigger lock. Some versions also feature an automatic firing pin block. The pistol has a rear sight windage adjustment. ==References== ==External links== *Manual *Review of the Bersa Thunder 380 at Gunblast.com *Bersa/Firestorm Parts *Ballistics By The Inch performance test including the Bersa/Firestorm .380.

Originally broadcast on MTV in 2001, only 13 episodes were created. It has since been shown on Comedy Central in the United States, Teletoon in Canada, and Trouble in the United Kingdom. The show was conceived by Pete Williams, when he dropped out of college at the age of 19. Williams performs most of the voices on the show. The series was produced by David McGrath. ==Overview== The show depicts what might be a typical first-year college experience. Characters in the show represent stereotypical college types; including the everyman (Nitz), the \\"frat boy\\" (Rocko), the \\"ladies' man\\" (Cal), the nerd (Gimpy), the cool girl (Jessie), and the \\"ditz\\" (Kimmy). Typical situations depicted in the show include student loans, bad cafeteria food, questioning of identity, fraternity rivalries, odd traditions, unpleasant RAs, money problems, peer pressure, and the \\"freshman fifteen\\". Few episodes depict the characters in class; the one exception is Rocko's ROTC class in the episode, Financial Aid. The location in the show has never been named. It appears to be a typical North American college town. However, it has been hinted in several episodes that the show takes place in New England, and Pete Williams, the show's creator, attended a university in this region. Episode 2, Traditions, features the \\"Xposed Xpo,\\" a naked run, and a classic tradition of the University of Vermont. In episode 12, Risk, there is a free Ben & Jerry's day, as well as a Spring Fling, another UVM tradition. In the episode Drunks, both Jessie and Nitz hold fake New York state driver's licenses. The episode Identity Crisis takes place at the start of the second semester and reveals bare trees and snow, conditions more likely to be found in northern states in January. However, in episode 1 Gimpy disguises Mump as a California Highway Patrol Officer to follow Rocko. ==Characters== ===Main=== * Parker \\"Nitz\\" Walsh (Voiced by Pete Williams) is the protagonist. He is shy and attends State U, a generic university. He often finds himself torn between hanging out with his old high school friends, the new friends he's made at college, and pining after his high school crush, Kimmy Burton. Nitz is based on series creator, Pete Williams. * Rocko (Voiced by Pete Williams) is a boorish, alcoholic fratboy. He attends the local community college Central State Junior Community College and is a member of the Alpha Alpha fraternity, although he is viewed with contempt by his frat brothers. His only interests are alcohol and women, although most women do not reciprocate his clumsy advances. He openly despises Cal. * Calvin \\"Cal\\" Evans (Voiced by Pete Williams) is Nitz's roommate. Although he is not too bright, his good looks make him very popular with women. He speaks in a high-pitched voice and frequently drools, and often ends his sentences with the word \\"guy.\\" * Justin \\"Gimpy\\" Taylor (Voiced by Pete Williams) is a nerd. He attends the tech institute Tekerson Tech and almost never leaves his room, primarily communicating with his friends via video conference. Gimpy uses the online alias \\"G Prime\\" and commands a group of fellow geeks to act as his minions. He is an extreme Star Wars fan. ===Supporting=== * Jessie (Voiced by Jene Yeo) a friend of Nitz, also goes to State U. Jessie has a very laid back, punk-girl-type personality on campus. She often accompanies Nitz on his misadventures and often provides a level- headed and mature point of view. Although Nitz openly pines for Kimmy Burton throughout the show's run, Jessie develops a crush on Nitz to which he is oblivious. Jessie's frustration with Nitz eventually results in outright spite for Kimmy. The character is voiced by Jene Yeo, upon whom the character is based. * Kimmy Burton (Voiced by Susan Quinn) is a redheaded girl Nitz has had a crush on since high school. Kimmy attends State U and tries to be involved with all of the on-campus activities. Spacey and self-centered, she is completely oblivious to Nitz's affections. Kimmy is romantically interested in Mark, another drama student at the college, but does not realize he is gay. * Mump (Voiced by Robert Tinkler) attends Tekerson Tech and is Gimpy's lead minion and sidekick. He is a short and overweight. Mump is fiercely protective of his friendship with Gimpy and often agrees with him regardless of whether he should or not. Mump is a member of ROTC. ===Recurring=== * Doug (The Dougler) (Voiced by Pete Williams) is the resident assistant at the State U dorms where Nitz and Cal reside. He is depicted as a social relic from the 1960s, sporting an overall hippie-like motif. He always wears a bathrobe, which he tells Cal is an unofficial uniform for State U RAs. He is something of a social inept, with a forced way of speaking, refers to himself in the third person, and often denies himself opportunities to partake in unofficial student events and fun. Other students appear indifferent to him. * Craig (Voiced by James Kee) is the leader of Rocko's fraternity. He along most of the other fraternity brothers dislikes Rocko but often takes pity on him. * Charity (Voiced by Katie Griffin) is Jessie's air-head roommate. She is obsessed with her ex-boyfriend Jonah, who left her prior to the series' beginning. She briefly dates Rocko when he tries to use her to make his ex- girlfriend jealous. * SHE PRIME (Voiced by Sunday Muse) is a female hacker at Tekerson Tech. According to the episode guide on the series' official website, her name is Tabitha. After hacking Gimpy, the two of them begin a brief online relationship that ends badly due to Gimpy's self-sabotage. Although they never meet in person, SHE-Prime and Gimpy's dorm rooms are immediately next to one another. If the show were to have continued, she would have had a love/hate relationship with Gimpy. * Spud (Voiced by Peter Oldring) is a diehard Trekkie and Gimpy's rival. He was the original leader of Tekerson Tech's students, but was supplanted once Gimpy moved into the Tekerson residence. * Mark, (Voiced by Richie Favalaro) the drama guy. He attends State U and is found often by Kimmy's side. Both Kimmy and Nitz are oblivious to the fact Mark is gay (which he makes little attempt to hide). * Lance, Mark's boyfriend who also attends State U. He is more often than not mentioned by Mark than seen on screen, though he is seen briefly carrying a couch in Roommates and singing showtunes at the end of Screw Week. * Rob Brodie (Voiced by Josh A. Cagan) is one of Jessie's friends. He is a film student who is frequently caught over-hyping whatever he's involved with. He often introduces himself when entering a room, even to people he knows. * Kruger (Voiced by Yannick Bisson) is another of Jessie's friends. Kruger is a foul-mouthed smoker and a pessimist who often disagrees with everyone. * Dan (Voiced by Pete Williams) is a friend of Jessie's who has no speaking lines in the entire series - all he does is laugh. * Gimpy's Minions are a troupe of nerds and geeks led by Gimpy at Tekerson Tech, much like a private army. Mump is a nominal second-in-command to Gimpy. Aside from Gimpy and Mump themselves, none of this group are identified by name. * Rita (Voiced by Jenny Kim) is the tyrannical Resident Assistant of Gimpy's dorm at Tekerson Tech. She wears glasses, has her hair in a bun and wears an 'RA' armband. Her slippers are shaped like sharks. She dislikes Gimpy and frequently tries to foil his plans. She has a brief fling with Cal when Gimpy uses him to distract her. * Stoner Dave (Voiced by Yannick Bisson) is a stereotypical \\"stoner\\", recognizable by his black shirt, slouch and large nose. * Studious Dave (Voiced by Garnet Harding) is a bespectacled African-American student at State U who is obsessed with finding things that will look good on his application to Wharton. ==Episodes== Note: All episodes were directed by Jerry Popowich ==Cancellation and attempts at revival== Airing to extremely mixed reviews and failing to attract much of an audience, Undergrads was regarded as both a critical and financial failure. As such, it was canceled before the second season could be produced. The series was originally set to continue, with Teletoon and Decode Entertainment producing as they did for the first season. However, at the last minute, MTV discontinued its funding, which halted production. The show was taken to Comedy Central to see if they would renew the show, but this attempt failed. Pete Williams stated that he was interested in reviving Undergrads, and Teletoon and Decode maintained for a time that they too were interested in continuing the series, but the funding did not present itself. In a blog post on January 27, 2006, Williams stated that he still wished to continue with the program. Williams stated that Teletoon had put up half of the production cost for its second season, and urged fans to add Undergrads as a MySpace friend to encourage a possible second season. On July 18, 2006, Williams urged fans to bombard both Cartoon Network and Comedy Central with emails and letters asking them to revive Undergrads. Teletoon soon after agreed to a second season, subject to finding another major broadcaster to pick up the second season. In a blog post on December 18, 2008, Williams stated that Teletoon had passed on a second season. Williams added that he had pitched them an entirely new animated concept entitled We Got Issues, in which he would reintroduce characters from Undergrads. The pitch never made it to development. Williams also expressed interest in \\"producing some kind of UG comic book or webisodes in lieu of a second season\\", and had been in talks with Decode Entertainment about the proposal. Williams and co-writers Andy Rheingold and Josh A. Cagan appeared together at a panel for the Calgary Expo in 2012. They have stated they do not have any legal rights to the series and will continue to bring it back. The creators have since started an Official Facebook \\"Groupville\\" in hopes of getting a second season green-lit. Fans have shown their support by posting fond memories of the show as well as \\"Bring Back Undergrads\\" videos, which are planned to be used for a viral campaign to spark interest in the continuation of the show. The first official \\"Bring Back UnderGRADS\\" video went live on YouTube on August 21, 2013. To help the revival of the show, on April 26, 2013, Williams started an official \\"Bring Back Undergrads\\" Facebook page in hopes to \\"garner a healthy 'like' count to prove that the series still has a fan base.\\" Williams attended ConBravo in July 2013 where he answered fan questions about the creation of the show as well as the current status of bringing the show back. During the panel he mentioned that the creators were \\"pretty close\\" on getting permission from MTV and DHX to continue the story. Williams added that they were currently unsure on if they would fund a full second season, do a one time movie answering the lingering questions left over from season one, or do a movie to \\"re-introduce UnderGRADS to a new audience and try to get the second season that way.\\" On the podcast My So Called 8-Bit Life Pete Williams, Josh A. Cagan and Andy Rheingold talked about being in talks with both companies, and how it was a long process to get even as close as they are to some sort of revival to the series. They were also quick to say that one of the biggest hurdles even if they were to get the permission to make more content would be the cost. Williams has also stated that he, Rheingold and Cagan are currently finishing up a treatment for a one-off Undergrads movie. Once approval is made by DHX and MTV, production on a script, followed by the movie, shall commence. On June 3, 2018, it was announced on the \\"Bring Back Undergrads\\" Facebook page that Williams has secured film rights from MTV to make an Undergrads movie. Williams subsequently announced on July 6, 2018, via the same Facebook page, that a Kickstarter campaign would be launched to help fund an Undergrads movie. The campaign was successfully funded on October 27, 2018. ==Music== The theme song, \\"The Click\\", is written and performed by the band Good Charlotte, who appear in the episode Risk. Much of the music featured in Undergrads include songs from various indie rock bands and Canadian artists, such as Vibrolux, Alkaline Trio, Knacker, Sam Roberts, Reggie and the Full Effect, Sloan, Planet Smashers, The Brodys, and The Rosenbergs, among others. The score of the show was composed and produced by Jono Grant. A list of bands and songs used in each episode can be found at the show's official website. ==References* *https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1512555460/undergrads-the- movie/description Category:2000s American adult animated television series Category:2000s American college television series Category:2000s American teen sitcoms Category:2001 American television series debuts Category:2001 American television series endings Category:2000s Canadian adult animated television series Category:2000s Canadian teen sitcoms Category:2001 Canadian television series debuts Category:2001 Canadian television series endings Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:Canadian adult animated comedy television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Good Charlotte Category:MTV cartoons Category:Teletoon original programming Category:Television series by DHX Media Category:Teen animated television series ","title":"Undergrads"},{"id":"1440769","text":"thumb Sphinx is the designation of an American test satellite.

From 1847 to 1856 he taught chemistry at the Polytechnic, where from 1883 to 1892 he was the director. From 1856 to 1866 he was on the staff of the military high school. In 1866 he was appointed professor of chemistry at the university, and retained that chair until his retirement from active work in 1891. A friend and colleague of Ludwig A. Colding, who was one of the early advocates of the principle of conservation of energy, Thomsen did much to found the field of thermochemistry. In particular, between 1869 and 1882, he carried out a great number of determinations of the heat evolved or absorbed in chemical reactions, such as the formation of salts, oxidation and reduction, and the combustion of organic compounds. His collected results were published from 1882 to 1886 in four volumes under the title Thermochemische Untersuchungen, and also a resume in English under the title \\"Thermochemistry\\" in 1908. In 1857 he established in Copenhagen a process for manufacturing soda from cryolite, obtained from the west coast of Greenland. Thomsen was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1880, and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1884. He was awarded the Royal Society's Davy Medal in 1883. Katherine Alice Burke translated his book on systematic researches in thermochemistry into English. This translation appeared in print in 1905. ==Family== His brother, Carl August Thomsen (1834-1894), was lecturer on technical chemistry at the Copenhagen Polytechnic, and a second brother, Thomas Gottfried Thomsen (1841-1901), was assistant in the chemical laboratory at the university until 1884, when he abandoned science for theology, subsequently becoming minister at Norup and Randers. ==References== ==See also== *Marcellin Berthelot ==Further reading== *Thermochemistry by J.

By this it is meant that if a system is varied between two end points, as the time for the variation between the end points is increased to infinity, the variation of an adiabatic invariant between the two end points goes to zero. In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process is a change that occurs without heat flow; it may be slow or fast. A reversible adiabatic process is an adiabatic process that occurs slowly compared to the time to reach equilibrium. In a reversible adiabatic process, the system is in equilibrium at all stages and the entropy is constant. In the 1st half of the 20th century the scientists that worked in quantum physics used the term \\"adiabatic\\" for reversible adiabatic processes and later for any gradually changing conditions which allow the system to adapt its configuration. The quantum mechanical definition is closer to the thermodynamical concept of a quasistatic process, and has no direct relation with adiabatic processes in thermodynamics. In mechanics, an adiabatic change is a slow deformation of the Hamiltonian, where the fractional rate of change of the energy is much slower than the orbital frequency. The area enclosed by the different motions in phase space are the adiabatic invariants. In quantum mechanics, an adiabatic change is one that occurs at a rate much slower than the difference in frequency between energy eigenstates. In this case, the energy states of the system do not make transitions, so that the quantum number is an adiabatic invariant. The old quantum theory was formulated by equating the quantum number of a system with its classical adiabatic invariant. This determined the form of the Bohr–Sommerfeld quantization rule: the quantum number is the area in phase space of the classical orbit. == Thermodynamics == In thermodynamics, adiabatic changes are those that do not increase the entropy. They occur slowly in comparison to the other characteristic timescales of the system of interest, and allow heat flow only between objects at the same temperature. For isolated systems, an adiabatic change allows no heat to flow in or out. === Adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas === If a container with an ideal gas is expanded instantaneously, the temperature of the gas doesn't change at all, because none of the molecules slow down. The molecules keep their kinetic energy, but now the gas occupies a bigger volume. If the container expands slowly, however, so that the ideal gas pressure law holds at any time, gas molecules lose energy at the rate that they do work on the expanding wall. The amount of work they do is the pressure times the area of the wall times the outward displacement, which is the pressure times the change in the volume of the gas: : dW = P dV = {N k_B T \\\\over V} dV If no heat enters the gas, the energy in the gas molecules is decreasing by the same amount. By definition, a gas is ideal when its temperature is only a function of the internal energy per particle, not the volume. So : dT = {1 \\\\over N C_v} dE Where C_{v} is the specific heat at constant volume. When the change in energy is entirely due to work done on the wall, the change in temperature is given by: : N C_v dT = - dW = - {N{k_B}T \\\\over V} dV This gives a differential relationship between the changes in temperature and volume, which can be integrated to find the invariant. The constant k_B is just a unit conversion factor, which can be set equal to one: :\\\\, d(C_v N \\\\log T) = - d( N \\\\log V) So :\\\\, C_v N \\\\log T + N \\\\log V is an adiabatic invariant, which is related to the entropy :\\\\, S = C_v N \\\\log T + N \\\\log V - N \\\\log N = N \\\\log (T^{C_v} V/N) So entropy is an adiabatic invariant. The N log(N) term makes the entropy additive, so the entropy of two volumes of gas is the sum of the entropies of each one. In a molecular interpretation, S is the logarithm of the phase space volume of all gas states with energy E(T) and volume V. For a monatomic ideal gas, this can easily be seen by writing down the energy, :E= {1\\\\over 2m} \\\\sum_k p_{k1}^2 + p_{k2}^2 + p_{k3}^2 The different internal motions of the gas with total energy E define a sphere, the surface of a 3N-dimensional ball with radius \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sqrt{2mE}. The volume of the sphere is :{2\\\\pi^{3N/2}(2mE)^\\\\over {\\\\Gamma(3N/2)}, where \\\\Gamma is the Gamma function. Since each gas molecule can be anywhere within the volume V, the volume in phase space occupied by the gas states with energy E is :{2\\\\pi^{3N/2}(2mE)^V^N\\\\over {\\\\Gamma(3N/2)}. Since the N gas molecules are indistinguishable, the phase space volume is divided by N! = \\\\Gamma(N+1) , the number of permutations of N molecules. Using Stirling's approximation for the gamma function, and ignoring factors that disappear in the logarithm after taking N large, : S= N \\\\big( 3/2 \\\\log(E)- 3/2 \\\\log(3N/2)+\\\\log(V)-\\\\log(N)\\\\big ) : = N \\\\big( 3/2 \\\\log(\\\\scriptstyle{\\\\frac 2 3} \\\\displaystyle E/N)+\\\\log(V/N)\\\\big ) Since the specific heat of a monatomic gas is 3/2, this is the same as the thermodynamic formula for the entropy. === Wien's law – adiabatic expansion of a box of light === For a box of radiation, ignoring quantum mechanics, the energy of a classical field in thermal equilibrium is infinite, since equipartition demands that each field mode has an equal energy on average and there are infinitely many modes. This is physically ridiculous, since it means that all energy leaks into high frequency electromagnetic waves over time. Still, without quantum mechanics, there are some things that can be said about the equilibrium distribution from thermodynamics alone, because there is still a notion of adiabatic invariance that relates boxes of different size. When a box is slowly expanded, the frequency of the light recoiling from the wall can be computed from the Doppler shift. If the wall is not moving, the light recoils at the same frequency. If the wall is moving slowly, the recoil frequency is only equal in the frame where the wall is stationary. In the frame where the wall is moving away from the light, the light coming in is bluer than the light coming out by twice the Doppler shift factor v/c. : \\\\Delta f = {2v\\\\over c} f On the other hand, the energy in the light is also decreased when the wall is moving away, because the light is doing work on the wall by radiation pressure. Because the light is reflected, the pressure is equal to twice the momentum carried by light, which is E/c. The rate at which the pressure does work on the wall is found by multiplying by the velocity: :\\\\, \\\\Delta E = v{2E \\\\over c} This means that the change in frequency of the light is equal to the work done on the wall by the radiation pressure. The light that is reflected is changed both in frequency and in energy by the same amount: : {\\\\Delta f \\\\over f} = {\\\\Delta E \\\\over E} Since moving the wall slowly should keep a thermal distribution fixed, the probability that the light has energy E at frequency f must only be a function of E/f. This function cannot be determined from thermodynamic reasoning alone, and Wien guessed at the form that was valid at high frequency. He supposed that the average energy in high frequency modes was suppressed by a Boltzmann-like factor. This is not the expected classical energy in the mode, which is 1/2\\\\beta by equipartition, but a new and unjustified assumption that fit the high-frequency data. :\\\\, \\\\langle E_f \\\\rangle = e^{-\\\\beta h f} When the expectation value is added over all modes in a cavity, this is Wien's distribution, and it describes the thermodynamic distribution of energy in a classical gas of photons. Wien's Law implicitly assumes that light is statistically composed of packets that change energy and frequency in the same way. The entropy of a Wien gas scales as the volume to the power N, where N is the number of packets. This led Einstein to suggest that light is composed of localizable particles with energy proportional to the frequency. Then the entropy of the Wien gas can be given a statistical interpretation as the number of possible positions that the photons can be in. == Classical mechanics – action variables == Suppose that a Hamiltonian is slowly time varying, for example, a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with a changing frequency. : H_t(p,x) = {p^2\\\\over 2m} + {m \\\\omega(t)^2 x^2\\\\over 2} \\\\, The action J of a classical orbit is the area enclosed by the orbit in phase space. : J = \\\\int_0^T p(t) {dx \\\\over dt} dt \\\\, Since J is an integral over a full period, it is only a function of the energy. When the Hamiltonian is constant in time and J is constant in time, the canonically conjugate variable \\\\theta increases in time at a steady rate. : {d\\\\theta \\\\over dt} = {\\\\partial H \\\\over \\\\partial J} =H\\\\,'(J) \\\\, So the constant H\\\\,' can be used to change time derivatives along the orbit to partial derivatives with respect to \\\\theta at constant J. Differentiating the integral for J with respect to J gives an identity that fixes H\\\\,': : {dJ\\\\over dJ } = 1 = \\\\int_0^T \\\\bigg( {\\\\partial p \\\\over \\\\partial J} {dx \\\\over dt} \\\\+ p {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial J} {dx \\\\over dt} \\\\bigg) dt = H\\\\,' \\\\int_0^T \\\\bigg({\\\\partial p \\\\over \\\\partial J}{\\\\partial x \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta} - {\\\\partial p \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta}{\\\\partial x \\\\over \\\\partial J}\\\\bigg) dt \\\\, The integrand is the Poisson bracket of x and p. The Poisson bracket of two canonically conjugate quantities like x and p is equal to 1 in any canonical coordinate system. So 1 = H\\\\,' \\\\int_0^T \\\\\\\\{ x,p \\\\\\\\}\\\\, dt = H\\\\,'\\\\, T \\\\, and H\\\\,' is the inverse period. The variable \\\\theta increases by an equal amount in each period for all values of J – it is an angle- variable. ; Adiabatic invariance of J The Hamiltonian is a function of J only, and in the simple case of the harmonic oscillator. :\\\\, H= \\\\omega J \\\\, When H has no time dependence, J is constant. When H is slowly time varying, the rate of change of J can be computed by re-expressing the integral for J : J = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} p {\\\\partial x \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta} d\\\\theta \\\\, The time derivative of this quantity is : {dJ\\\\over dt} = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\bigg({dp \\\\over dt} {\\\\partial x\\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta} + p {d\\\\over dt} {\\\\partial x \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\bigg) d\\\\theta \\\\, Replacing time derivatives with theta derivatives, using d\\\\theta = \\\\omega dt \\\\, and setting \\\\omega:=1\\\\, without loss of generality (\\\\omega being a global multiplicative constant in the resulting time derivative of the action), yields : {dJ \\\\over dt} = \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} \\\\bigg({\\\\partial p \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta} {\\\\partial x \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta} + p {\\\\partial \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta} {\\\\partial x \\\\over \\\\partial \\\\theta} \\\\bigg) d\\\\theta \\\\, So as long as the coordinates J, \\\\theta do not change appreciably over one period, this expression can be integrated by parts to give zero. This means that for slow variations, there is no lowest order change in the area enclosed by the orbit. This is the adiabatic invariance theorem – the action variables are adiabatic invariants. For a harmonic oscillator, the area in phase space of an orbit at energy E is the area of the ellipse of constant energy, : E = {p^2\\\\over 2m} + {m\\\\omega^2 x^2\\\\over 2} \\\\, The x-radius of this ellipse is \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sqrt{2E/\\\\omega^2m}, while the p-radius of the ellipse is \\\\scriptstyle \\\\sqrt{2mE}. Multiplying, the area is 2\\\\pi E/\\\\omega. So if a pendulum is slowly drawn in, so that the frequency changes, the energy changes by a proportional amount. === Old quantum theory === After Planck identified that Wien's law can be extended to all frequencies, even very low ones, by interpolating with the classical equipartition law for radiation, physicists wanted to understand the quantum behavior of other systems. The Planck radiation law quantized the motion of the field oscillators in units of energy proportional to the frequency: : E= h f = \\\\hbar \\\\omega \\\\, The quantum can only depend on the energy/frequency by adiabatic invariance, and since the energy must be additive when putting boxes end to end, the levels must be equally spaced. Einstein, followed by Debye, extended the domain of quantum mechanics by considering the sound modes in a solid as quantized oscillators. This model explained why the specific heat of solids approached zero at low temperatures, instead of staying fixed at 3k_B as predicted by classical equipartition. At the Solvay conference, the question of quantizing other motions was raised, and Lorentz pointed out a problem, known as Rayleigh–Lorentz pendulum. If you consider a quantum pendulum whose string is shortened very slowly, the quantum number of the pendulum cannot change because at no point is there a high enough frequency to cause a transition between the states. But the frequency of the pendulum changes when the string is shorter, so the quantum states change energy. Einstein responded that for slow pulling, the frequency and energy of the pendulum both change but the ratio stays fixed. This is analogous to Wien's observation that under slow motion of the wall the energy to frequency ratio of reflected waves is constant. The conclusion was that the quantities to quantize must be adiabatic invariants. This line of argument was extended by Sommerfeld into a general theory: the quantum number of an arbitrary mechanical system is given by the adiabatic action variable. Since the action variable in the harmonic oscillator is an integer, the general condition is: : \\\\int p dq = n h \\\\, This condition was the foundation of the old quantum theory, which was able to predict the qualitative behavior of atomic systems. The theory is inexact for small quantum numbers, since it mixes classical and quantum concepts. But it was a useful half-way step to the new quantum theory. == Plasma physics == In plasma physics there are three adiabatic invariants of charged particle motion. === The first adiabatic invariant, μ === The magnetic moment of a gyrating particle, :\\\\mu = \\\\frac{mv_\\\\perp^2}{2B} is a constant of the motion to all orders in an expansion in \\\\omega/\\\\omega_c, where \\\\omega is the rate of any changes experienced by the particle, e.g., due to collisions or due to temporal or spatial variations in the magnetic field. Consequently, the magnetic moment remains nearly constant even for changes at rates approaching the gyrofrequency. When μ is constant, the perpendicular particle energy is proportional to B, so the particles can be heated by increasing B, but this is a 'one shot' deal because the field cannot be increased indefinitely. It finds applications in magnetic mirrors and magnetic bottles. There are some important situations in which the magnetic moment is not invariant: * Magnetic pumping: If the collision frequency is larger than the pump frequency, μ is no longer conserved. In particular, collisions allow net heating by transferring some of the perpendicular energy to parallel energy. * Cyclotron heating: If B is oscillated at the cyclotron frequency, the condition for adiabatic invariance is violated and heating is possible. In particular, the induced electric field rotates in phase with some of the particles and continuously accelerates them. * Magnetic cusps: The magnetic field at the center of a cusp vanishes, so the cyclotron frequency is automatically smaller than the rate of any changes. Thus the magnetic moment is not conserved and particles are scattered relatively easily into the loss cone. === The second adiabatic invariant, J === The longitudinal invariant of a particle trapped in a magnetic mirror, :J = \\\\int_a^b p_\\\\parallel d s where the integral is between the two turning points, is also an adiabatic invariant. This guarantees, for example, that a particle in the magnetosphere moving around the Earth always returns to the same line of force. The adiabatic condition is violated in transit-time magnetic pumping, where the length of a magnetic mirror is oscillated at the bounce frequency, resulting in net heating. === The third adiabatic invariant, \\\\Phi=== The total magnetic flux \\\\Phi enclosed by a drift surface is the third adiabatic invariant, associated with the periodic motion of mirror-trapped particles drifting around the axis of the system. Because this drift motion is relatively slow, \\\\Phi is often not conserved in practical applications. ==References== * §10 * pp. 85–89 ==External links== * lecture notes on the second adiabatic invariant * lecture notes on the third adiabatic invariant Category:Classical mechanics Category:Quantum mechanics Category:Thermodynamics Category:Plasma physics Category:Physical systems ","title":"Adiabatic invariant"},{"id":"1440793","text":"Tinto from Lanark Racecourse.

The Chaliyar is also known as Chulika River or Beypore River as it nears the sea. Nilambur, Edavanna, Areekode, Kizhuparamba, Cheruvadi, Edavannappara, Mavoor, Peruvayal, Feroke and Beypore are some of the towns/villages situated along the banks of Chaliyar. It mainly flows through Malappuram district. A small portion of the river flows through Kozhikode district too. ==Name== The river has two names - Chaliyar and Beypore puzha, of which the former is more popular. The river meets the Lakshadweep Sea at an 'azhi' (estuary), the southern part of which is known as Chaliyam and northern part as Beypore. Thus the river gets the names Chaliyar and Beypore River. Unlike many other rivers in Kerala, Chaliyar does not dry up during the drought season in March and April. ==Course== The Chaliyar originates in the Western Ghats range at Elambalari Hills in the Wayanad Plateau of Kerala and flows through Malappuram District for most of its length and then for around 17 km it forms the boundary between Malappuram District and Kozhikode District before entering the city of Kozhikode for its final 10 km journey and finally empties into the Lakshadweep Sea. Six major streams Chaliyarpuzha, Punnapuzha, Kanjirapuzha, Karimpuzha, Iruvahnipuzha and Thottumukkam Puzha (Cherupuzha) constitute the Chaliyar River drainage system. Other important tributaries are Kurumanpuzha, Pandipuzha, Maradipuzha, Kuthirapuzha and Karakkodupuzha. Most of these rivers have their origin in the Nilgiri hills in the east and Wayanad hills in the north, where they form a number of rapids and waterfalls. Near the origin of river are the Meenmutty Falls at coordinates by Vaduvanchal, Wayanad ==Economy== During late 19th century and early 20th century, the Chaliyar was extensively used as a waterway for carrying timber from the forest areas in and around Nilambur to the various mills in Kallai of Calicut city. Rafts made of logs were taken downstream during the monsoon season to Kallayi, where these were sawn to size in the timber mills dotting the banks of the river. Kallai was during this period one of the most important centers in the world for timber business. The place was famous for wood of superlative strength and durability like teak, rosewood, etc. Towards the second half of the 20th century, the activity came down drastically as tree felling was banned or strictly controlled with a view to stop deforestation. Many mills still operate in Kallai, though with far less output. Many have closed down. ==Ecology== Chaliyar river at Cheruvannur, Feroke Boat service in Chaliyar at Elamaram thumbHanging bridge across Chaliyar River in Nilambur, which connects to Conolly Teak Plantation. Chaliyar River was in the news a few years ago because of the ecological damage caused by a pulp factory at Mavoor, that released effluents into the river and affected the marine life. This factory has since closed down. K. A.

It is situated near Edavannappara in Malappuram District of Kerala. This village is very scenic as it is on the bank of Chaliyar. There is a ferry service here that can take you to the northern side of the Chaliyar river. The ticket is Rs.5.00 and the motor boat service is available every half an hour between 6.40 a.m. and 8.40 p.m. including Sundays. == Ghost Town== Across the river Chaliyar lies the abandoned Grasim Industries factory which once employed 2,000 employees. Environmental agitations in 1998 caused the closure of the factory and the entire village went bankrupt because of the sudden development and eleven people even committed suicide because of not being able to face unexpected poverty. ==Pilgrimage== The Konnara Dargah is three kilometres away from Elamaram on the bank of the Chaliyar river.

He authored geographical and geological descriptions of the Altai, Xinjiang (1845), and Asia Minor (1853-1869). One of the Altai mountain ranges is named after him. ==Education== He was born in the Large Gatchina palace, the summer residence of the dowager empress Maria Fyodorovna. His father was Alexander Petrovich Chikhachyov, a retired colonel of the Preobrazhensky regiment. Getting home education in Tsarskoye Selo, under the direction of lyceum professors, Chikhachyov finished his education abroad, attending the lectures of famous geologists and mineralogists, and then worked in Paris. Not a professional scientist, Chikhachyov, with sufficient money and scientific preparation, could completely give himself up to his interest in scientific expeditions and research. These produced essential scientific results, due to the observation of their author and careful treatment of the scientific material collected during expeditions, to which Chikhachyov attracted prominent specialists in different fields. ==Expeditions and research== Chikhachyov's independent scientific activity began in 1841, when he published geological descriptions of Monte Gargano in South Italy and the environs of city of Nice. In 1842, he published a geological description of the southern provinces of the Neapolitan kingdom. Portrait of Chikhachyov by Karl Bryullov (1835) In the same year he took charge of a large expedition to the Altai. He reached the sources of the rivers Abakan, Chu, and Chulyshman. Traveling across the Southern Altai, Chikhachyov reached territories hitherto undiscovered. He investigated also the Sayan Mountains, about which the most fantastic stories were told, not only in Western Europe but also in Russia. In the Northern Altai he found the richest coal deposits in the world, which he called the Kuznetsk Coal Basin. He also studied the culture, life, and customs of various nomadic and settled tribes of this region. In 1845, he published a voluminous work about Altai, entitled Voyage scientifique dans l'Altai Oriental et les parties adjacentes de la frontière de Chine, and presented a report on his Siberian explorations and the results of study of the collected material. Chikhachyov soon began a comprehensive study of Asia Minor, to which he devoted twenty years of his life. After the Altai trip, he became the attaché of the Russian embassy in Constantinople. He took advantage of his two-year stay there to study Turkish, and then, leaving the diplomatic service, undertook during 1847-1863 a series of expeditions in Asia Minor, during which he made extensive scientific researches and collections. The results were published by Chikhachyov in an enormous work, Asie Mineure: Description physique, statistique et archéologique de cette contrée. This work, embracing the geography, geology, climatology, zoology, botany, and paleontology of Asia Minor, represents the classic work of Chikhachyov in cooperation with numerous experts on different branches of the natural sciences. After completing his Asia Minor researches, Chikhachyov ended his great travels and expeditions, having reached old age, but did not stop scientific work. In early 1878, at the age of 71, he visited Algeria and Tunis, and in 1880 he published a description of his travel under the title Espagne, Algérie et Tunisie. Besides his geographical and natural-historical works, Chikhachyov published a number of political works on the Eastern Question. ==Death== A commemorative plaque in Gatchina In 1890, he published a few natural-scientific articles under the title Etudes de géographie et d'histoire naturelle. These represent fragments from what Chikhachyov conceived as a large scientific work on the world's deserts which he did not have time to finish, dying in 1890 of pneumonia. In encouragement of travelers across Asia, Chikhachyov left to the French Academy of Sciences the sum of 100,000 francs. ==Named in honor== Chikhachyov Range * Chikhachyov Range (Chikhachev Range) - a mountain range in Altai near the border of Russia, China and Kazakhstan. * Centaurea tchihatcheffii - a flowering plant found in Turkey * Prix Tchihatcheff (Prix Tchihatchef; Prix Chikhachev) - prize awarded by the French Academy of Sciences (Grigorii Grumm, 1893;The Quest for Forbidden Lands: Nikolai Przhevalskii and his Followers on Inner Asian Tracks by Alexandre I.

He was the son of John IV of Armagnac and Isabella of Navarre. ==Life== Styled Viscount de Lomagne while his father lived, John succeeded him as Count of Armagnac when he died (5 November 1450); soon after, he started a relationship with his sister Isabelle, Lady of the Four-Valleys (Dame des Quatre-Vallées), ten years his junior, whom the chronicler Mathieu d'Escouchy accounted one of the great beauties of France and whose betrothal to Henry VI of England had been under consideration. When word got out that two boys (John and Anthony) had been born in the castle of Lectoure, the couple promised to reform their controversial behavior. But within a few months John solemnized the union between the two by claiming to have obtained a papal dispensation from Pope Callixtus III, shortly after their third child, a daughter called Rose (or Mascarose) was born. Other serious breaches ensued: John refused to seat a bishop of Auch selected by the King and assented to by the Pope, installing an illegitimate half-brother of his in the seat. Events came to a head in May 1455. Authorities were alerted, and a brief was issued for John's arrest, when an investigation revealed that he had forced a forged dispensation out of Antoine d'Alet, Bishop of Cambrai, a magistrate in the court of Rome. Tried in absentia in 1460 before a parlement of Charles VII, he was convicted of lese- majeste, rebellion and incest.Richard Vaughan, Charles the Bold: The Last Valois Duke of Burgundy, (The Boydell Press, 1973), 45. Forces were sent to capture him but he escaped punishment by fleeing to his cousins in Aragon. Though he pleaded his case in Rome, the couple were separated and the sons declared bastards and barred from inheritance. Within a few years a new King of France, Louis XI, reinstated John in his domains, where John rashly undid his father's acts and broke faith with his promises. Betraying Louis, Armagnac was part of the league that called themselves Bien public and threatened Paris at the head of 6,000 mounted men. In 1469, Louis responded, under the pretense that John was treating with ambassadors from England, and sent an army under Antoine de Chabannes to rout him. John fled to Spain, only to reappear in 1471 in the train of the king's rebellious brother, the duc de Guyenne. Louis had John besieged in his stronghold of Lectoure. John opened the gates of the city on 5 March 1473 but he died the next day, stabbed by men-at-arms.Charles Samaran, La maison d’Armagnac au XVe siècle et les dernières luttes de la féodalité dans le Midi de la France, Paris, Alphonse Picard et fils, 1907, pp.193-194. In Lectoure on 19 August 1469, John married Joan (b. aft. 1454 - d. Pau, aft. 10 February 1476), daughter of Count Gaston IV of Foix and Queen Eleanor of Navarre, later monarch of Navarre. Pregnant at the time of her husband's death, Joan was transported to the castle of Buzet-sur-Tarn and lived still several years,Charles Samaran, La maison d’Armagnac au XVe siècle et les dernières luttes de la féodalité dans le Midi de la France, Paris, Alphonse Picard et fils, 1907, pp.221-222. contrary to Père Anselme's suggestion that she was forced to drink a potion (un breuvage) which made her give birth to a stillborn child in ca. April 1473 so that the \\"race of the Count could be ended\\" (il ne restât aucun de la race du comte).Père Anselme, Tome III, p. 424, citing \\"archives de Rodez\\". The title of Count of Armagnac passed, first fruitlessly to his younger brother Charles, and in 1497 to his cousin of the cadet branch, Armagnac-Nemours. His union with his sister Isabelle of Armagnac (b. 1430 - d. Castelnau, 4 August 1476), produced three children: #John of Armagnac (d. 1516), Seigneur of Camboulas, married in 1507 with Jeanne de La Tour. No issue. #Anthony of Armagnac (d. ca. 1516), called the \\"Bâtard d'Armagnac\\".

Having had treatment for breast cancer in 1991, aged 26; the disease returned in 2000 throughout her body. During the next six years, Tomlinson completed the London Marathon three times, the London Triathlon twice, the New York Marathon once and cycled across Europe and the United States. Jane Tomlinson died in 2007, aged 43. ==Early life== Jane Emily Goward was born in Wakefieldhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jane- tomlinson-5544695.html in Yorkshire in 1964, the sixth of ten children of a dentist. When she was aged 11, the family emigrated to Australia but returned after three years. In 1990, Tomlinson applied to study Mathematics at the University of Leeds. However, when she found a lump in her breast and had a lumpectomy, she enrolled instead at Leeds General Infirmary and trained as a radiographer. By this time, she had married Mike Tomlinson and had two daughters, Suzanne and Rebecca. They later had a son, Steven. Qualifying in 1993, Tomlinson later studied to postgraduate level and became a paediatric radiographer. Three years after having a lumpectomy the cancer returned and she had a second mastectomy, and two rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In 2000, Jane Tomlinson was told that the cancer had spread to her bones and lungs, and was given about 12 months to live. ==Charity fundraising== Jane raised over £1.85 million through a series of gruelling challenges including several long-distance bike rides, marathons, triathlons and a full Ironman triathlon. Since her death the charity that she founded has announced a new fundraising target of £5 million. As of February 2015 £7.6 million has been raised, and in September 2017 the campaign announced fundraising had surpassed £10m. ==Last years== In July and August 2006, Tomlinson spent nine weeks cycling 3,800 miles across the United States, raising £250,000. This was her final athletic challenge. Having published The Luxury of Time in 2005, she released the second volume of her memoirs You Can't Take It With You in 2006. In January 2007, Mike and Jane Tomlinson launched Jane Tomlinson's Run For All, a 10 km charity run that took place in June that year. Having had four courses of chemotherapy, she developed chronic heart disease. Having been elevated to a CBE in June 2007, Jane Tomlinson died in St Gemma's Hospice, Leeds, West Yorkshire less than three months later on 3 September. Her Requiem Mass, which was conducted by Arthur Roche, Roman Catholic Bishop of Leeds, was held at the Roman Catholic Leeds Cathedral on 14 September 2007. Later that day she was cremated in a private family ceremony. On 15 November 2007 Tomlinson's ten-year-old son, Steven, collected her CBE from Charles, Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace.

Born in Mei (present-day Mei County, Shaanxi), Bai Qi served as the commander of the Qin army for more than 30 years, being responsible for the deaths of over one million, earning him the nickname (; ). According to the Shiji, he seized more than 73 cities from the other six hostile states, and to date no record has been found to show that he suffered a single defeat throughout his military career. He was named by Chinese historians as one of the four greatest generals of the Warring States period, along with Li Mu, Wang Jian, and Lian Po. ==Life== In 293 BC, Bai Qi led the Qin army to victory against Wei () and Han () forces at the Battle of Yique (in present-day Longmen (), southeast of Luoyang, Henan), reportedly slaughtering around 240,000 enemy soldiers in total while capturing some cities.http://www.chinaknowledge.de/History/Zhou/personsbaiqi.html In 292 BC, he was promoted from Zuo Shu Zhang (左庶長; Vice Prime Minister of Qin) to Da Liang Zao (大良造; Prime Minister of Qin) by King Zhaoxiang of Qin. In 278 BC, he led the Qin army to capture Ying (), the capital city of Chu, in the process seizing considerable amounts of territory.Hawkes, 162 As a reward, he was given the title Lord Wu'an (武安君; literally: Lord of Martial Peace). Reportedly drowning 100000 people in a flood attack. In 273 BC, the Qin army under his command defeated the joint armies of Zhao () and Wei at Huayang (華陽; south of present-day Zhengzhou (), Henan), where he massacred the submitting soldiers, reportedly numbering around 150,000 troops in total: 130,000 Wei soldiers with a further 20,000 Zhao soldiers being killed and thrown into a river.史记·卷七十二·穰侯列传 In 264 BC, he successfully besieged 5 Han fortresses and thereafter decapitated the 50,000 enemy soldiers.史记·卷七十三·白起王翦列传 During the Battle of Changping in 260 BC, he succeeded Wang He as the commander of the Qin army, and soon defeated the Zhao army commanded by the inexperienced Zhao Kuo, who himself had replaced Lian Po as acting commander. The Zhao army was split into two parts and its supply lines and retreat route cut off by Bai Qi. More than 400,000 Zhao soldiers, including the Shangdang people who surrendered after Zhao Kuo was shot dead by Qin archers, were slain (坑殺; buried alive) on the orders of Bai Qi. Bai Qi wanted to end Zhao once and for all, as they were weary and psychologically affected by the losses incurred from the Battle of Changping, but the prime minister of Qin, Fan Ju (), who was persuaded by a talker from Zhao, feared Bai Qi's rising power, and recommended that the king stop the attack on the pretext that the Qin troops ought to be rested, and to accept a ceded territory negotiation. Bai Qi stopped the attack; on his return journey to the State of Qin, he fell ill. According to the Shiji, in the year 257 BC, Qin started to besiege Handan, the capital of Zhao. Because Bai Qi was ill, the Qin king used another prominent general, Wang Ling (), who subsequently lost the battle. After about four months, when Bai Qi seemed to have recovered, the king asked him to return to his post as commander, but Bai Qi held a different opinion, he argued that Qin no longer had enough resources for such a long-range war, and the other states would soon attack Qin since Qin had been contrary to the negotiation. However, the king insisted on continuing the attack. Bai Qi refused the king's command, using his illness as an excuse. The king, therefore, had to use Wang He (), another prominent Qin general, instead of Bai Qi, as the commander. This decision did not help the Qin army in the battle at all; Chu and Wei soon sent troops to assist Zhao. After more than five months of continuous defeat at Handan, Qin had suffered major losses. The king asked Bai Qi to become commander again, but he once more used his illness to refuse the request. In the Zhan Guo Ce, his true intentions were supposedly revealed when he stated that he would rather be executed for refusing the king's order, than lose his long undefeated fame on the battlefield. Having been refused several times, the king became angry, removed all titles from Bai Qi, and forced him to leave Xianyang, the Qin capital. In addition, Fan Ju persuaded the king that Bai Qi would join another state as a general and become a threat to the State of Qin. Convinced by Fan Ju's information, the king then forced Bai Qi to commit suicide in Duyou (). Before he committed suicide, Bai Qi stated that he deserved such a tragic ending after having killed so many people. ==Legacy== Bai Qi sometimes appears as a door god on Chinese and Taoist temples, usually paired with Li Mu. He is noted in Chinese history as a symbol of brutality rather than for his military talent. The traditional Tofu dish of Gaoping,就是俺们这里的：高平烧豆腐 today's Changping, called Bai Qi meat, is well known. Some stories have been written about Bai Qi suffering for his brutal actions, such as one mentioned in the Chronicles of the Eastern Zhou Kingdoms, which says that an ox with two Chinese characters, 'Bai Qi', tattooed on its back, was executed by lightning during the Tang Dynasty. Human remains used to and still continue to be found at the site of the Battle of Changping around Gaoping. The Emperor Xuanzong of Tang once decided to dedicate a temple over a collection of the remains there. ==In popular culture== *Bai Qi is played by Sun Ting in the 2012 television series The Qin Empire II: Alliance and by Xing Jiadong in its 2017 sequel The Qin Empire III. *Bai Qi, also known by the Japanese reading of his name, \\"Haku Ki\\", is the leader of the Six Generals of Qin in the manga series Kingdom.

He was a successful painter of Paris society before moving to London in 1871. He became famous as a genre painter of fashionably dressed women shown in various scenes of everyday life. He also painted scenes and characters from the Bible. ==Early life== Jacques Tissot was born in the city of Nantes in France and spent his early childhood there. His father, Marcel Théodore Tissot, was a successful drapery merchant. His mother, Marie Durand, assisted her husband in the family business and designed hats. A devout Catholic, Tissot's mother instilled pious devotion in the future artist from a very young age. Tissot's youth spent in Nantes likely contributed to his frequent depiction of shipping vessels and boats in his later works. The involvement of his parents in the fashion industry is believed to have been an influence on his painting style, as he depicted women's clothing in fine detail. By the time Tissot was 17, he knew he wanted to pursue painting as a career. His father opposed this, preferring his son to follow a business profession, but the young Tissot gained his mother's support for his chosen vocation. Around this time, he began using the given name of James. By 1854 he was commonly known as James Tissot; he may have adopted it because of his increasing interest in everything English. ==Early career== The Circle of the Rue Royale, a scene in Paris seen from the balcony of the Hôtel de Coislin overlooking the Place de la Concorde In 1856 or 1857, Tissot travelled to Paris to pursue an education in art. While staying with a friend of his mother, painter Elie Delaunay, Tissot enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux- Arts to study in the studios of Hippolyte Flandrin and Louis Lamothe. Both were successful Lyonnaise painters who moved to Paris to study under Jean- Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Lamothe provided the majority of Tissot's studio education, and the young artist studied on his own by copying works at the Louvre, as did most other artists of the time in their early years. Around this time, Tissot also made the acquaintance of the American James McNeill Whistler, and French painters Edgar Degas (who had also been a student of Lamothe and a friend of Delaunay), and Édouard Manet. In 1859, Tissot exhibited in the Paris Salon for the first time. He showed five paintings of scenes from the Middle Ages, many depicting scenes from Goethe's Faust. These works show the influence in his work of the Belgian painter Henri Leys (Jan August Hendrik Leys), whom Tissot had met in Antwerp earlier that same year. Other influences include the works of the German painters Peter von Cornelius and Moritz Retzsch. After Tissot had first exhibited at the Salon and before he had been awarded a medal, the French government paid 5,000 francs for his depiction of The Meeting of Faust and Marguerite in 1860, with the painting being exhibited at the Salon the following year, together with a portrait and other paintings. ==Mature career== Portrait of James Tissot by Edgar Degas, c. 1866–67 Émile Péreire supplied Tissot's painting Walk in the Snow for the 1862 international exhibition in London; the next year three paintings by Tissot were displayed at the London gallery of Ernest Gambart. In James Tissot - Un Dejeuner about 1863, Tissot suddenly shifted his focus from the medieval style to the depiction of modern life through portraits. During this period, Tissot gained high critical acclaim, and quickly became a success as an artist. Like contemporaries such as Alfred Stevens and Claude Monet, Tissot also explored japonisme, including Japanese objects and costumes in his pictures and expressing style influence. Degas painted a portrait of Tissot from these years (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), in which he is sitting below a Japanese screen hanging on the wall. Still on Top, 1873 Tissot fought in the Franco-Prussian War as part of the improvised defence of Paris, joining two companies of the Garde Nationale and later as part of the Paris Commune. His 1870 painting La Partie Carrée (The Foursome) evoked the period of the French revolution. Either because of the radical political associations related to the Paris Commune (which he was believed to have joined mostly to protect his own belongings rather than for shared ideology), or because of better opportunities, he left Paris for London in 1871. During this period, Seymour Haden helped him to learn etching techniques. Having already worked as a caricaturist for Thomas Gibson Bowles, the owner of the magazine Vanity Fair, as well as exhibited at the Royal Academy, Tissot arrived with established social and artistic connections in London. Tissot used the name Coïdé in Vanity Fair from 1869 to 1873. Tissot quickly developed his reputation as a painter of elegantly dressed women shown in scenes of fashionable life. By 1872 Tissot had bought a house in St John's Wood, an area of London very popular with artists at the time. According to The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists, \\"in 1874 Edmond de Goncourt wrote sarcastically that he had 'a studio with a waiting room where, at all times, there is iced champagne at the disposal of visitors'\\". He gained membership of The Arts Club in 1873. Paintings by Tissot appealed greatly to wealthy British industrialists during the second half of the 19th century. During 1872 he earned 94,515 francs, an income normally only enjoyed by those in the echelons of the upper classes. In 1874, Degas asked him to join them in the first exhibition organized by the artists who became known as the Impressionists, but Tissot refused. He continued to be close to these artists, however. Berthe Morisot visited him in London in 1874, and he travelled to Venice with Édouard Manet at about the same time. He regularly saw Whistler, who influenced Tissot's Thames river scenes. In 1875–6, Tissot met Kathleen Newton, a divorcee who became the painter's companion and frequent model. He composed an etching of her in 1876 entitled Portrait of Mrs N., more commonly titled '. She gave birth to a son, Cecil George Newton in 1876, who is believed to be Tissot's son. She moved into Tissot's household in St. John's Wood in 1876 and lived with him until her death in the late stages of consumption in 1882. Tissot frequently referred to these years with Newton as the happiest of his life, a time when he was able to live out his dream of a family life. After Kathleen Newton's death, Tissot returned to Paris. A major exhibition of his work took place in 1885 at the Galerie Sedelmeyer, where he showed 15 large paintings in a series called '. Unlike the genre scenes of fashionable women he painted in London, these paintings represent different types and classes of women, shown in professional and social scenes. The works also show the widespread influence of Japanese prints, as he used unexpected angles and framing from that tradition. He created a monumental context in the size of the canvases.By Jules Claretie in his book L'Art français en 1872 and by Philippe Burty (1830–1890) in ' Tissot was among many Western artists and designers influenced at the time by Japanese art, fashion and aesthetics.

Many of his artist friends were skeptical about his conversion, as it conveniently coincided with the French Catholic revival, a reaction against the secular attitude of the French Third Republic. At a time when French artists were working in impressionism, pointillism, and heavy oil washes, Tissot was moving toward realism in his watercolors. To assist in his completion of biblical illustrations, Tissot traveled to the Middle East in 1886, 1889, and 1896 to make studies of the landscape and people. His series of 365 gouache (opaque watercolor) illustrations showing the life of Christ were shown to critical acclaim and enthusiastic audiences in Paris (1894–5), London (1896) and New York (1898–9), before being bought by the Brooklyn Museum in 1900. They were published in a French edition in 1896–7 and in an English one in 1897–8, bringing Tissot vast wealth and fame. During July 1894, Tissot was awarded the Légion d'honneur, France's most prestigious medal. Tissot spent the last years of his life working on paintings of subjects from the Old Testament. Although he never completed the series, he exhibited 80 of these paintings in Paris in 1901 and engravings after them were published in 1904.

His grave is in the chapel sited within the grounds of the chateau. Widespread use of his illustrations in literature and slides continued after his death with The Life of Christ and The Old Testament becoming the \\"definitive Bible images\\". In 1906, filmmaker Alice Guy-Blaché used the Tissot Bible as reference material for her largest production at Gaumont to date, The Passion, creating twenty-five episodes, with approximately three hundred extras. His images provided a foundation for contemporary films such as the design for the Ark of the Covenant in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and lifestyle themes in The Age of Innocence (1993). In the first half of the 20th century, there was a re-kindling of interest in his portraits of fashionable ladies and some fifty years later, these were achieving record prices. ==Gallery== Image:Tissot self detail.jpgTissot in 1898 (detail of a self-portrait on silk).

He established Morden College in Blackheath, south- east London as a home for retired merchants; as a charity, it continues to provide residential care over 300 years later. ==Early life== Born in London, the son of a goldsmith (George Morden), Morden was apprenticed to Sir William Soame, a wealthy London merchant and member of the British East India Company, in 1643. After a posting in Aleppo in Turkey, Morden returned to London in 1660 having amassed a substantial fortune and become a member of the East India company himself. It is said that, having decided to return to England, Morden loaded his complete fortune into three ships, none of which arrived at the expected time, prompting his deep despair. However, their eventual arrival after difficult voyages led him to rejoice and made him determined to help merchants who had fallen on hard times. In 1669, he purchased (for £4,200) Wricklemarsh Manor (now part of Lee) in south-east London, an estate of over 250 acres (1 km²) with a mansion house. Created a baronet in 1688 by King James II, in 1691 he became Commissioner of Excise under King William III, and was Member of Parliament for Colchester from 1695 until 1698. ==Foundation of Morden College== In 1695, after serving two years as Treasurer of Bromley College, a home for clergy widows, he resigned to establish – at a cost of £10,000 – his own hospice or almshouse for 'poor Merchants...and such as have lost their Estates by accidents, dangers and perils of the seas or by any other accidents ways or means in their honest endeavours to get their living by means of Merchandizing'. Morden College was built (to a design sometimes attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, but largely carried out by Edward Strong, his master mason) on the north-east corner of the Wricklemarsh estate and was intended to house 40 single or widowed men. College trustees were drawn from the East India Company and Turkey Company. The building was visited and written about by John Evelyn and Daniel Defoe. Evelyn's Diary for 9 June 1695 records: :\\"Went afterwords to see Sir Jo: Mordens Charity or Hospital on Black-heath now building for the Reliefe of Merchands that have failed, a very worthy Charitye, nobel building.\\" Defoe wrote about the college in his Tour Through Great Britain, published in 1724: :\\"It was built by Sir John Morden, a Turkey merchant of London, but who liv'd in a great house at the going off from the heath, a little south of the Hospital, on the road to Eltham. His first design, as I had it from his own mouth the year before he began to build, was to make apartments for forty decay'd merchants, to whom he resolved to allow £40 per annum each, with coals, a gown (and servants to look after their apartments) and many other conveniences so as to make their lives as comfortable as possible, and that, as they had liv'd like Gentlemen, they might dye so.\\" Sir John Morden died in 1708, aged 86, and was buried in Morden College chapel crypt. Created c. 1717–1725, statues of Sir John and his wife, Lady Susan Morden, adorn the western front of the college.Public Monument and Sculpture Association National Recording Project, (Accessed: 28 November 2011) The college has since expanded several times and continues its charitable work. Apart from the college, Sir John's name lives on in the name of pubs on Brand Street (Greenwich) and Campshill Road (Lewisham), and local street names in the Royal Borough of Greenwich. ==References== * Category:1623 births Category:1708 deaths Morden, John, 1st Baronet Category:English MPs 1695–1698 Category:English philanthropists Category:17th-century English merchants Category:17th-century philanthropists ","title":"Sir John Morden, 1st Baronet"},{"id":"1440903","text":"Wu Qi Wu Qi (, 440–381 BC) was a Chinese military leader, Legalist philosopher, and politician in the Warring States period. ==Biography== Born in the State of Wei (), he was skilled in leading armies and military strategy. He had served in the states of Lu and Wei (魏, not to be confused with Wèi, as in previous note). In the state of Wei he commanded many great battles and was appointed Xihe Shou (Mayor of Xihe county). Xihe was the area between the Yellow and Luo Rivers that Wei had just taken from Qin. Later, after he became estranged from the lord of Wei and was forced into exile, Wu Qi went to the State of Chu where he was appointed Prime minister by King Dao of Chu (). His reforms made Chu a strong state at that time. The reforms he instituted enraged the old nobility of Chu and he was killed after the death of King Dao. Wu's reforms, which started around 389 BC, were generally aimed at changing the corrupt and inefficient government. The nobility and officialdom were terribly corrupt and the government was burdened with the costs of paying them and a horde of other minor officials. Wu first lowered the annual salary of Chu officials, then dismissed officials who were useless or incompetent. He also eliminated hereditary privileges after three generations. The money saved by cutting costs was used to create and train a more professional army. Another of Wu's actions was to move all the nobles to the borders on the frontier, away from the capital, in order to reduce their power and at the same time populate those areas, making them more useful to the state government. He is also credited with devising a set of building codes in Ying, in order to make the city look less \\"barbaric\\", and more in line with 'civilized' Chinese architectural aesthetics. Although his reforms soon started to make Chu a powerful country, the nobles and Daoists of Chu hated him. Nobles accused him of trying to change the old ways, and even managed to find fault with the building codes. Daoists accused him of being a \\"warmonger\\" and an \\"admirer of force and weaponry\\", even going as far as to say that he was \\"a threat to humanity\\". He was accused of not returning for the mourning period of his mother's death and for murdering his own wife (who was the daughter of a noble from the rival state of Qi) in order to gain trust from the ruler of the state of Lu. There is no definitive evidence to the truth of these accusations, and it is possible they were manufactured by Wu Qi's political enemies to slander him. In the wake of Wu Qi's reforms, Chu's prowess was quickly manifest: Chu defeated the Yue state in the south and the Wei in the north, dealing with each in quick succession. However, King Dao died that same year. The old nobles plotted to assassinate Wu Qi at King Dao's funeral, where he would be separated from the army. Wu Qi spotted the assassins armed with bows, and rushed to the side of King Dao's body. He was killed, but many arrows struck the dead King. The new King Su (), furious at his father's body being mutilated, ordered all nobles involved to be executed, along with their families. ==Wei Liaozi== According to the Wei Liaozi, a treatise on military matters dating from the late 4th or early 3rd century BC, the general Wu Qi was once offered a sword by his subordinates on the eve of battle. However Wu Qi refused to accept the weapon on the basis that banners and drums, the tools to lead and command, were the only instruments a general required. In his words, \\"to command the troops and direct their blades, this is the role of a commander. To wield a single sword is not his role.\\" The point here is to highlight the idea that the general was the brain of the army, whereas the soldiers were to behave as the limbs. Heroic individual actions were disincentivized in preference to complete obedience and perfect coordination as a unit, a concept which the Wei Liaozi elucidates upon in another parable concerning Wu Qi: Prior to the beginning of a battle, one of Wu's soldiers broke from his ranks in his enthusiasm and charged the enemy line, slaying two men, and trotted back to his former position along with their heads as trophies. Wu immediately ordered the man to be put to death. When his officers protested that he was a fine warrior, Wu Qi answered, \\"He is indeed a fine warrior, but he disobeyed my orders.\\" As with Sun Tzu and his Art of War, Wu Qi emphasized discipline and obedience before bravery as the most important traits in soldiery. == Popular culture == He and Sun Zi are often mentioned in the same sentence (Sun-Wu, 孙吴) as great military strategists of similar if not equal importance. His military treatise, the Wuzi, is included as one of the Seven Military Classics. It is said there were two books on the art of war by Wu Qi, but one was lost, hence leaving the Wuzi as the only existing book carrying Wu Qi's military thoughts. Wu Qi is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game series Romance of the Three Kingdoms (video game) by Koei. == See also == * Wuqi County ==Footnotes== ==References== * * Wu, Rongzeng, \\"Wu Qi\\".

After the 1960s, erotic photography began to be less commonly referred to as such, and to be increasingly described as glamour photography. Erotic photography generally produces a composed image of a subject in a still position. Though the subjects of erotic photography are usually completely or mostly unclothed, that is not a requirement. Erotic photography is often distinguished from nude photography, which contains nude subjects not necessarily in an erotic situation, and pornographic photography, which is of a sexually explicit nature. Pornographic photography is generally defined as \\"obscene\\" and lacking in artistic/aesthetic value. However, the line between art and pornography has been both socially and legally debated, and many photographers have created work that intentionally ignores these distinctions. Erotic photographs are normally intended for commercial use, including mass-produced items such as decorative calendars, pinups and for men's magazines, such as Penthouse and Playboy, but many art photographers have also dabbled in explicit or erotic imagery. Additionally, sometimes erotic photographs are intended to be seen only by a subject's partner. The subjects of erotic photographs may be professional models, celebrities or amateurs. Very few well-known entertainers have posed nude for photographs. The first entertainer to pose nude for photographs was the stage actress Adah Isaacs Menken (1835–1868). On the other hand, a number of well-known film stars have posed for pinup girl photographs and been promoted in photography and other media as sex symbols. Traditionally, the subjects of erotic photographs have been female, but since the 1970s erotic images of men have also been published. ==Beginnings== File:Nude woman in colored daguerreotype by Félix-Jacques Moulin.jpgColoured daguerreotype by Félix-Jacques Moulin, c.1851–1854 File:Nu féminin allongé Amélie.jpgRecumbent female nude, Amélie by Félix-Jacques Moulin, c.1852–1853 File:19th century nude.jpg19th-century nude photograph by unknown photographer File:Vintage nude bust photograph of a young denuded lady.jpgBust photograph of a young nude lady by unknown photographer, 19th century Before 1839, depictions of nudity and erotica generally consisted of paintings, drawings and engravings. In that year, Louis Daguerre presented the first practical process of photography to the French Academy of Sciences. Unlike earlier photograph methods, his daguerreotypes had stunning quality and did not fade with time. Artists adopted the new technology as a new way to depict the nude form, which in practice was the feminine form. In so doing, at least initially, they tried to follow the styles and traditions of the art form. Traditionally, in France, an académie was a nude study done by a painter to master the female (or male) form. Each had to be registered with the French government and approved or they could not be sold. Soon, nude photographs were being registered as académie and marketed as aids to painters. However, the realism of a photograph as opposed to the idealism of a painting made many of these intrinsically erotic. In Nude Photography, 1840–1920, Peter Marshall notes: \\"In the prevailing moral climate at the time of the invention of photography, the only officially sanctioned photography of the body was for the production of artist's studies. Many of the surviving examples of daguerreotypes are clearly not in this genre but have a sensuality that clearly implies they were designed as erotic or pornographic images\\". The daguerreotypes were not without drawbacks, however. The main difficulty was that they could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use negatives. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for portraiture. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for a long time. Another limitation was the monochrome image that the technology could produce. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one of two or more people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her genitals. The cost of the process also limited the spread of the technology. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society. Stereoscopy was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes, including the erotic images. This technology produced a type of three dimensional view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than £GB 10,000. === The calotype process === In 1841, William Fox Talbot patented the calotype process, the first negative-positive process, making possible multiple copies. This invention permitted an almost limitless number of prints to be produced from a glass negative. The technology also reduced the exposure time and made possible a true mass market for low cost commercial photography. The technology was immediately employed to reproduce nude portraits, classified by the standards of the time as pornographic. Paris soon became the centre of this trade. In 1848 only thirteen photography studios existed in Paris; by 1860, there were over 400. Most of them made income from the sale of illicit nude images to the masses who could now afford it. The pictures were also sold near train stations, by traveling salesmen and women in the streets who hid them under their dresses. They were often produced in sets (of four, eight or twelve), and exported internationally, mainly to England and the United States. Both the models and the photographers were commonly from the working class, and the artistic model excuse was increasingly hard to use. By 1855, no more photographic nudes were being registered as académie, and the business had gone underground to escape prosecution. === The Victorian tradition === Eadweard Muybridge: Woman walking with fishing pole (detail) The Victorian pornographic tradition in Britain had three main elements: French photographs, erotic prints (sold in shops in Holywell Street, a long vanished London thoroughfare, swept away by the Aldwych), and printed literature. The ability to reproduce photographs in bulk assisted the rise of a new business individual, the porn dealer. Many of these dealers used the postal system to distribute erotic photography, sending the photographic cards to subscribers in plain wrappings. Victorian pornography had several defining characteristics. It reflected a very mechanistic view of the human anatomy and its functions. Science, the new obsession, was invoked to ostensibly study the nude human body. Consequently, the sexuality of the subject is often depersonalised, and is without any passion or tenderness. At this time, it also became popular to depict nude photographs of women of exotic ethnicities, under the umbrella of science. Studies of this type can be found in the work of Eadweard Muybridge. Although he photographed both men and women, the women were often given props like market baskets and fishing poles, making the images of women thinly disguised erotica. Parallel to the British printing history, photographers and printers in France frequently turned to the medium of postcards, producing great numbers of them. Such cards came to be known in the US as \\"French postcards\\".The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States, Philip Herbst. Intercultural Press, 1997, . p.86. ==French influence== File:French Nude circa 1910 C.jpgJean Agélou File:JA-Serie-040 French postcard-number2.JPGJean AgélouDe l'académisme à la photo de charme, Christian Bourdon.

Picture postcards allowed and encouraged many individuals to send images across national borders, and the legal availability of a postcard image in one country did not guarantee that the card would be considered \\"proper\\" in the destination country, or in the intermediate countries that the card would have to pass through. Some countries refused to handle postcards containing sexual references (such as of seaside scenes) or images of full or partial nudity (including images of classical statuary or paintings). Many French postcards featured naked women in erotic poses. These were described as postcards but whose primary purpose was not for sending by post because they would have been banned from delivery. Street dealers, tobacco shops, and a variety of other vendors bought the photographs for resale to tourists. The sale of erotica was banned, and many of these postcards were sold \\"under the counter\\". Instead, nude and erotic photographs were marketed in a monthly magazine called La Beauté that was ostensibly targeted for artists looking for poses. Each issue contained 75 nude images which could be ordered by mail, in the form of postcards, hand-tinted or sepia toned. ==Early 20th century== File:Bellocq Storyville undamaged.jpgPortrait by Bellocq, c.1912 (1900–1917) File:Akt mit Schuhen.jpgNude on couch by Julian Mandel, c.1910–1930 File:Old porn 8.jpgErotic photography around 1910 The early 1900s saw several important improvements in camera design, including the 1913 invention of the 35 mm or \\"candid\\" camera by Oskar Barnack of the Ernst Leitz company. The Ur- Leica was a compact camera based on the idea of reducing the format of negatives and enlarging them later, after they had been exposed. This small, portable device made nude photography in secluded parks and other semi-public places easier, and represented a great advance for amateur erotica. Artists were enamored with their new ability to take impromptu photos without carrying around a clunky apparatus. Early 20th century artist E. J. Bellocq, who made his best known images with the older style glass plate negatives, is best remembered for his down-to-earth pictures of prostitutes in domestic settings in the Storyville red light district of New Orleans. In contrast to the usual pictures of women awkwardly posed amid drapery, veils, flowers, fruit, classical columns and oriental braziers, Bellocq's sitters appear relaxed and comfortable. David Steinberg speculates that the prostitutes may have felt at ease with Bellocq because he was \\"so much of a fellow outcast.\\" Other photographers of nude women of this period include Alexandre-Jacques Chantron, Jean Agélou and Alfred Cheney Johnston. Chantron was already an established painter before experimenting with photography, while Agélou and Johnston made their career in photography. Julian Mandel (possibly a pseudonym) became known in the 1920s and 1930s for his exceptional photographs of the female form. Participating in the German \\"new age outdoor movement,\\" Mandel took numerous pictures in natural settings, publishing them through the Paris-based studios of Alfred Noyer and P-C Paris, Les Studios and the Neue Photographische Gesellschaft. The models often are found in highly arranged classical poses, photographed both in-studio and outdoors. The images are composed artfully, with exquisite tones and soft use of lighting—showing a particular texture created by light rather than shadow. Another noteworthy photographer of the first two decades of the 20th century was the naturist photographer Arundel Holmes Nicholls (1923-2008). His work, featured in the archives of the Kinsey Institute, is artistically composed, often giving an iridescent glow to his figures. Following in Mandel's footsteps, Nicholls favored outdoor shots. Many photographs from this era were intentionally damaged. Bellocq, for instance, frequently scratched out the faces of his sitters to obscure their identities. Some of his other sitters were photographed wearing masks. Peter Marshall writes, \\"Even in the relatively bohemian atmosphere of Carmel, California in the 1920s and '30s, Edward Weston had to photograph many of his models without showing their faces, and some 75 years on, many communities are less open about such things than Carmel was then.\\" ==Later 20th century== Nude photographers of the mid-20th century include Walter Bird, John Everard, Horace Roye, Harrison Marks and Zoltán Glass. Roye's photograph Tomorrow's Crucifixion, depicting a model wearing a gas mask while on a crucifix caused much controversy when published in the English Press in 1938. The image is now considered one of the major pre-war photographs of the 20th century. === The Second World War === During the Second World War, pin-up girl photographs reached a wide audience. Unlike earlier erotic photographs, whose subjects were usually anonymous, a number of well-known film stars posed for pin-up photographs and they were promoted as sex symbols. The emphasis was initially on bare legs, short skirts or swim suits and shapely figures; but in the 1950s such photos started to show naked breasts. === Playboy and Penthouse === Playboy magazine, founded in 1953, achieved great popularity and soon established the market for men's and lifestyle magazines. Erotic photography soon became closely associated with it and gained increasing public attention. Founded in 1965, Penthouse magazine went a step further than Playboy and was the first to clearly display genitals, initially covered with pubic hair. The models looked usually directly into the camera, as if they would enter into relationship with the mostly male viewers. === Cleo and male nude === In the 1970s, in the mood of feminism, gender equality and light humour, magazines such as Cleo included male nude centrefolds. Unlike the traditional erotic photographs, which use any attractive female subjects, the male nude photographs are usually of celebrities. === Internet === The spread of the Internet in the 1990s and increasing social liberalization brought a renewed upsurge of erotic photography. There are a variety of print and online publications, which now compete against the major magazines (Playboy, Penthouse) and cater for the diverse tastes.Mark Gabor: The Illustrated History of Girlie Magazines. Random House, New York 1984. There are a large number of online erotic photography sites, some of which describe themselves or are so described by others as pornography. Where the subject is presented in a romantic or sexually alluring manner, it may be described as glamour photography. == See also == * Ken Marcus * Andrew Blake * Blue Movie by Andy Warhol * Erotic art * Erotica * Helmut Newton * History of erotic depictions * Michael Ninn * Nude photography (art) * Philip Mond * Radley Metzger * Tinto Brass ==References== ==Further reading== * Hix, Charlesm and Michael Taylor. \\"Dream Lovers\\", in their Male Model: the World Behind the Camera (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1979; ), p.

It occurs in Europe from the north Mediterranean to the arctic. In Scotland, it is often known simply as bluebell. Campanula rotundifolia produces its violet-blue, bell-shaped flowers in late summer and autumn. ==Taxonomy== Campanula rotundifolia was first formally described in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus. , no varieties or subspecies of Campanula rotundifolia are accepted in Plants of the World Online. Several species have been previously described as varieties or subspecies of C. rotundifolia: * Campanula alaskana (Campanula rotundifolia var. alaskana or hirsuta) * Campanula giesekiana (C. r. var. dubia or var. groenlandica) * Campanula intercedens (C. r. var. dentata or intercedens) * Campanula kladniana (C. r. subsp. kladniana) * Campanula macrorhiza (C. r. var. aitanica or alcoiana) * Campanula moravica (C. r. subsp. moravica) * Campanula nejceffii (C. r. var. bulgarica) * Campanula petiolata (C. r. var. petiolata) * Campanula ruscinonensis (C. r. var. ruscinonensis) * Campanula willkommii (C. r. subsp. willkommii) While it is now commonly known as harebell or bluebell, it was historically known by several other names including blawort, hair-bell, lady's thimble, witch's bells, and witch's thimbles. Elsewhere in Britain, \\"bluebell\\" refers to Hyacinthoides non-scripta, and in North America, \\"bluebell\\" typically refers to species in the genus Mertensia, such as Mertensia virginica (Virginia bluebells). ==Description== Campanula rotundifolia is a perennial, slender, prostrate to erect herb, spreading by seed and rhizomes. The basal leaves are long-stalked, rounded to heart-shaped, usually slightly toothed, with prominent hydathodes, and often wither early. Leaves on the flowering stems are long and narrow and the upper ones are unstemmed. The inflorescence is a panicle or raceme, with 1 to many flowers borne on very slender pedicels. The flowers usually have five (occasionally 4, 6 or 7) pale to mid violet-blue petals fused together into a bell shape, about long and five long, pointed green sepals behind them. Plants with pale pink or white flowers may also occur. The petal lobes are triangular and curve outwards. The seeds are produced in a capsule about diameter and are released by pores at the base of the capsule. Seedlings are minute, but established plants can compete with tall grass. As with many other Campanula species, all parts of the plant exude white latex when injured or broken. The flowering period is long and varies by location. In the British Isles, harebell flowers from July to November. In Missouri, it flowers from May to August; in Minnesota, from June to October. The flowers are pollinated by bees, but can self-pollinate. ==Distribution and habitat== Campanula rotundifolia occurs from Spitzbergen, extending in mainland Europe from northernmost Scandinavia to the Pyrenees and the French Mediterranean coast. It also occurs on the southern coasts of Greenland, on Iceland and on southern Novaya Zemlya. It is not found in Canada (see other Campanula species, such as Campanula alaskana). It occurs as tetraploid or hexaploid populations in Britain and Ireland, but diploids occur widely in continental Europe.McAllister, H.A. 1973. The experimental taxonomy of Campanula rotundifolia L. Ph.D. Thesis, University of Glasgow In Britain, the tetraploid population has an easterly distribution and the hexaploid population a westerly distribution, and very little mixing occurs at the range boundaries. Harebells grow in dry, nutrient-poor grasslands and heaths. The plant often successfully colonises cracks in walls or cliff faces and stable dunes. C. rotundifolia is more inclined to occupy climates that have an average temperature below 0 °C in the cold months and above 10 °C in the summer.Shetler SG. 1982 Variation and evolution of Nearctic harebells (Campanula subsect. Heterophylla). Phan. Monogr. 11. 1-516 (1982)- En Abstr. in Excerpta Bot., A, 39(1): p.20 (1982). ==In culture== The harebell is dedicated to Saint Dominic. In 2002 Plantlife named it the county flower of Yorkshire in the United Kingdom.Plantlife website County Flowers page William Shakespeare makes a reference to 'the azured hare-bell' in Cymbeline: :With fairest flowers, :Whilst summer lasts, and I live here, Fidele, :I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack :The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor :The azured hare-bell, like thy veins; no, nor :The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander, :Out-sweeten’d not thy breath.William Shakespeare, Cymbeline (iv. 2), Arviragus speechIn Jessica Kerr's and Opelia Dowden's Shakespeare's Flowers published in 1970 they infer that Shakespeare was actually making reference to Hyacinthoides non-scripta. Christina Rossetti (1830–1894) wrote a poem entitled 'Hope is Like A Harebell': :Hope is like a harebell, trembling from its birth, :Love is like a rose, the joy of all the earth, :Faith is like a lily, lifted high and white, :Love is like a lovely rose, the world’s delight. :Harebells and sweet lilies show a thornless growth, :But the rose with all its thorns excels them both.Christina G Rossetti, A Nursery Rhyme Book, Macmillan and Co., London, New York (1893) Emily Dickinson uses the harebell as an analogy for desire that grows cold once that which is cherished is attained: :Did the Harebell loose her girdle :To the lover Bee :Would the Bee the Harebell hallow :Much as formerly? :Did the paradise – persuaded :Yield her moat of pearl :Would the Eden be an Eden :Or the Earl – an EarlEmily Dickinson, Did the Harebell loose her girdle, Volume: Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson, first published in 1955 ==Notes== ===References=== rotundifolia Category:Flora of Europe Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Campanula rotundifolia"},{"id":"1440920","text":"James Oscar McKinsey (June 4, 1889 – November 30, 1937) was an American accountant, management consultant, professor of accounting at the University of Chicago, and founder of McKinsey & Company.Flesher, Dale L. and Tonya K.

Routledge, 5 feb. 2014. p. 17 McKinsey continued to study law at the University of Arkansas, where he obtained his law degree one year later, in 1913. In 1914 he studied bookkeeping at the St. Louis University, and started his working career by teaching bookkeeping at St. Louis University. Next McKinsey entered the University of Chicago, where in 1917 he obtained his BPhil degree. After serving in the U.S. Army in World War I, he returned to the University of Chicago. There in 1919 he obtained his MA in commerce and passed the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination, to act as certified public accountant in the State of Illinois. === Further career === In 1917 McKinsey had joined the accounting faculty of the University of Chicago, and would continue to lecture there on and off until 1935. In 1926 he was promoted to full professor. In the college year 1920-21 he had lectured accounting at Columbia University, and in 1921 had joined a private accounting practice. In 1922 he published his first major work, entitled Budgetary Control. In 1926 McKinsey founded his own consultancy firm, McKinsey & Company, in Chicago, where he served as senior partner until 1935. In 1935 he accepted the appointment as chairman of the board at Marshall Field & Company, a department store in Chicago, and made Andrew Thomas Kearney managing partner of the Chicago office. In 1936 he was also elected chairman of the American Management Association. Flesher & Flesher explained that McKinsey \\"soon turned Marshall Field's red ink into profit, but he may have done so at the cost of his health. He died of pneumonia on November 30, 1937.\\" == Work == Management theory was still in its infancy when James O. McKinsey (or Mac, as he was known by friends and colleagues) founded the firm that bears his name in 1926. He had left his academic career to build a firm that provided finance and budgeting services but quickly gained a reputation for providing advice on organization and management issues. McKinsey is credited with the first textbook on business budgeting, Budgetary Control, published in 1922, and the first textbook in management accounting Managerial Accounting, published in 1924. McKinsey was determined to help senior management in American companies solve their most important business problems. In an era when \\"management engineers\\" were largely efficiency experts, McKinsey set out to enlarge the profession's scope by persuading clients that his young firm could not only help inefficient companies but also assist healthy companies in reorienting themselves to thrive in a turbulent business environment. == Selected publications == * Hodge, Albert Claire & James Oscar McKinsey, Principles of accounting, Chicago, Univ. of Chicago Press, 1920. * McKinsey, J.O.

National Highway (old NH 220 Kollam - Theni now NH 183) connects Kanjirapally to major nearest cities. Kanjirappally is also known as the Gateway of Highrange as it is the geographic entrance to the 'Malanad' or the Hill country of Kerala that extends to Idukki district and then to Tamil Nadu. Kanjirapally is one of the most busiest towns in the Kottayam district. The nearest Airport is Nedumbassery International Airport (). The nearest railway station is Kottayam Railway Station (). ==Economy== Rubber plantations are a major source of income for the local population. Part of the Syrian Christian belt under Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Changanassery, the place has a large population of Syrian Catholic Christians. The Christians of Kanjirapally are known to be the earliest agrarian group in Kerala to have switched to plantation agriculture by the beginning of the 20th century. The place is, therefore, home to many legendary Syrian Christian families of Kerala who owe their affluence to plantation agriculture, particularly to the production of latex. == Business == Kanjirappally is one of the major agrarian business towns in Kerala, with a large production of latex, spices, jack fruits, etc. being exported. Kanjirappally has many business headquarters, including: * St Mary's Rubber * Oxygen * Eloit * Heavecrumb ==Film shooting== Since the early 1980s, scores of Malayalam movies depicted the region as a pocket of Christian affluence. The term 'Achayan', which is colloquially used among the Nasranis of Central Travancore, has always been synonymous with Kanjirapally and neighboring towns like Mundakayam, Ponkunnam, Erumely , Erattupetta etc. The film 'Thopil Jopan' was shot in the Kanjirapally cathedral church. ==Syrian Christian Settlements== The Syrian Christian colonization of Kanjirappally had a profound impact on the history of commerce and agriculture in these parts. The Christians claim their roots from early settlements at Nilackal or Chayal on the banks of Pamba River, in the Sabarimala Hills of eastern Kerala. There is also a strong belief that the flourishing Christian community here was founded by Saint Thomas the Apostle himself. The place was in the forest recesses far away from seats of power. Nilackal became an important depot for spices like pepper, cardamom, etc., and the Christians were engaged in this lucrative trade as procures and sorters. Following a catastrophic event in the mid 14th century, the Christian inhabitants of Nilackal fled the region, a large section of whom migrated to the present day Kanjirapally, which is 30 miles northwest of the ancient town. The direct descendants of these settlers constructed the Pazhayapally Akkarappally (meaning the 'Old Church') in the middle of the town. Following the agrarian expansion of the 19th century, the Syrian Christians spread to places around Kanjirapally, such as Manimala, Ponkunnam, Erumely, Mundakayam and their surrounding regions, clearing forests and setting up farms. ==Climate== Kanjirapally has the highest number of rainy days in Kerala. It receives the highest amount of summer rains, winter rains and northeast monsoons (Thulaam Mazha) in Kerala, making it one of the very few places in India enjoying equatorial rainforest type climate, with no distinct dry season. The well-distributed rainfall pattern of Kanjirapally is the primary reason for the phenomenon of high yield of latex from Rubber plantations in and around the town. The average annual rainfall is 4156 mm. ==Religion== Kanjirappally bishop Mar Mathew Arackal with Fr. Prasant Payyappilly Palakkappilly and other priests at the tomb of Mar Varghese Payyappilly Palakkappilly The population in the town area is a mixture of Syrian Christians, Muslims, and Hindus. However, the Syro Malabar Christians constitute the vast majority in the interior regions of Kanjirapally, where agriculture thrives. They also make up the dominant socio-economic community of the region. Born again Christians are also found in certain areas. Ganapathy Koil is a Hindu temple built in granite. Hindus from Kerala come here to offer prayers. It was built by the Vellala community of Tamil Nadu, but this 900-year-old structure is almost in ruins today, although the carvings and inscriptions on its granite pillars are still visible. *Madhura Meenakshi Temple is another temple in the heart of Kanjirapally Town. Devi Madhura Meenakshi is worshipped there. *St. Dominic's Syro-Malabar Catholic Cathedral is the mother church of the Diocese of Kanjirappally and was built in 1826. The 150th anniversary of St. Dominic's Cathedral was celebrated in 1977. *Nainaru Mosque is one of several mosques in the region, and attracts Muslims from the town as well as the surrounding areas to offer their prayers. ==Transportation== The K. K. Road (NH 183: Kollam-Theni) (Kottayam-Kumily Road) connects Kanjirapally to major nearest cities like Mundakkayam (), Kottayam (), Kuttikkanam (), Kumily () and Ponkunnam (). *Pamba - Chemmalamattam - Erattupetta - Neriyamangalam (SH44) connects Kanjirapally to Sabarimala (), Erumely (), Pamba (), Erattupetta () and Thodupuzha (). *Main Eastern Highway (Muvattupuzha-Pala-Manimala - Pathanamthitta-Punalur Road) connects Kanjirappally to other major towns. *Kanjirappally-Manimala () road connects Changanassery easily. Chenappady () connects Ranni (). *A link road that connects Pala () directly from Kanjirappally through Thambalakkadu (). *Parathanam - Mundakayam - Parathode - Podimattam - 26th Mile - Kanjirappally () The nearest international airport is Cochin International Airport in Nedumbassery, the nearest railway station is in Kottayam, Changanacherry and the nearest KSRTC bus station is in Ponkunnam. The area between Ponkunnam and Kanjirapally is gradually reducing with rapid commercialization. The nearest Medical College is at Kottayam. Proposal for a long-awaited, not happening soon railway station is expected to be built at Kanjirappally as a part of Angamaly-Sabarimala rail route in future. ===Sabarigiri International Airport=== On 19 July 2017, the Kerala Government has announced the construction of the 5th International Airport in Kerala, Sabarigiri International Airport at Cheruvally Estate of Harrisons Plantations at Manimala, Erumely, situated at the Border of Kottayam District and Pathanamthitta district to facilitate travel of Sabarimala pilgrims. ==Administration== Kanjirappally mini civil station Kanjirappally assembly constituency is part of Pathanamthitta (Lok Sabha constituency). Previously it was part of Muvattupuzha (Lok Sabha constituency). Most of the local administration offices like PWD, Railway Reservation Counter, Employment Exchange, Taluk offices etc. are now located in the recently constructed Mini Civil Station. ==Celebrities== == School Education == ===Engineering Colleges=== *Amal Jyothi College of Engineering Koovappally, Kanjirappally - 5 km from Kanjirappally town ===Arts and Science Colleges=== * College of Applied Science IHRD (under MG University) Petta Junction, Kanjirappally. * SVRV NSS College, Vazhoor * St Dominic's College, 27th Mile Kanjirappally * Sree Sabareesa College, Murikkumvayal, Mundakayam (Aided) * Govt.

Zelt-Musik-Festival 2017 in Freiburg, Germany Helge Schneider (born 30 August 1955 in Mülheim an der Ruhr) is a German comedian, jazz musician and multi-instrumentalist, author, film and theatre director, and actor. Schneider's works are an unconventional mixture of horseplay humor, parody, and jazz-influenced music. They involve spontaneity and improvisation as important elements. == Biography == After dropping out of high school, he started an apprenticeship as a construction draftsman. He soon changed plans and was admitted to the Duisburg conservatory to study piano, after passing an entrance exam for particularly gifted applicants (it later turned out that his diploma was invalid since he dropped out of high school too early). He then toured as a little-known jazz musician and as an entertainer, basically a stand-up comedian, in local clubs. Schneider is a multi-instrumentalist, playing various instruments such as the Hammond organ, acoustic and electric guitar, ukulele, drums, piano, accordion, trumpet, cello, saxophone, clarinet and others. He became a popular comedian in the 1990s and is still one of the best known German comedians. He toured and still tours (alone and with his bands \\"Hardcore\\", \\"The Firefuckers\\" and others) through major concert halls with a mixture of music and comedy. He frequently appears on German TV, and is probably best known for his song Katzenklo (Kitty Litter Box): \\"Katzenklo, Katzenklo, ja das macht die Katze froh\\" (\\"Kitty litter tray, kitty litter tray, that's what makes the kitty gay [happy].\\"), which spent 17 weeks on the German music charts in 1994, peaking at number 13. He has written, directed and starred in four Low-budget movies. He has also composed and performed music for numerous films, including some of his own films like Texas – Doc Snyder hält die Welt in Atem and Jazzclub – Der frühe Vogel fängt den Wurm. In 2007 he appeared as Adolf Hitler in a satirical film: My Führer – The Really Truest Truth about Adolf Hitler. Schneider has written nine books, including an autobiography (\\"My whole life's in this book, up to right now. The second part will come in thirty or forty years\\") and a musical, \\"Mendy – das Wusical\\", which appeared at Bochum Theatre in 2004. His comic techniques are often referred to as highly unique, extremely anarchic (also by himself) and include parody, use of the Ruhr Region local dialect Ruhrdeutsch, the unexpected use of infantile language and other unexpected stylistic transitions, slapstick/physical humour, Dada-esque absurdity, sudden and unexpected use of crude/sexual humour, references to national and international highbrow and lowbrow culture, and phonetic and declamatory playfulness and exaggeration. Vast parts of his material are deeply rooted in German language and do not translate well into other languages. == Discography == Helge Schneider 2002 * 1987: The Last Jazz * 1989: Seine größten Erfolge (His greatest hits) * 1990: New York, I'm Coming * 1991: Hörspiele Vol.1 (1979–1984) (Radio dramas) * 1992: Hörspiele Vol.2 (1985–1987) * 1992: Guten Tach (Hello there) * 1993: Es gibt Reis Baby (We're gonna have some rice, baby) * 1993: Die Geschenkkassette (5 CDs; The gift box) * 1995: Es rappelt im Karton (Rumble in the cardboard box) * 1997: Da Humm * 1998: Helge 100% live – The Berlin Tapes * 1999: Eiersalat in Rock (Egg salad in rock, released as Helge and the Firefuckers) * 1999: Jazz (& Hardcore) * 2000: Hefte raus – Klassenarbeit!

Triangulations of a three-dimensional volume would involve subdividing it into tetrahedra (\\"pyramids\\" of various shapes and sizes) packed together. In most instances, the triangles of a triangulation are required to meet edge-to-edge and vertex-to-vertex. ==Types== Different types of triangulations may be defined, depending both on what geometric object is to be subdivided and on how the subdivision is determined. * A triangulation T of \\\\mathbb{R}^d is a subdivision of \\\\mathbb{R}^d into d-dimensional simplices such that any two simplices in T intersect in a common face (a simplex of any lower dimension) or not at all, and any bounded set in \\\\mathbb{R}^d intersects only finitely many simplices in T. That is, it is a locally finite simplicial complex that covers the entire space. * A point set triangulation, i.e., a triangulation of a discrete set of points \\\\mathcal{P}\\\\subset\\\\mathbb{R}^d, is a subdivision of the convex hull of the points into simplices such that any two simplices intersect in a common face of any dimension or not at all and such that the set of vertices of the simplices are contained in \\\\mathcal{P}. Frequently used and studied point set triangulations include the Delaunay triangulation (for points in general position, the set of simplices that are circumscribed by an open ball that contains no input points) and the minimum-weight triangulation (the point set triangulation minimizing the sum of the edge lengths). * In cartography, a triangulated irregular network is a point set triangulation of a set of two- dimensional points together with elevations for each point. Lifting each point from the plane to its elevated height lifts the triangles of the triangulation into three-dimensional surfaces, which form an approximation of a three- dimensional landform. * A polygon triangulation is a subdivision of a given polygon into triangles meeting edge-to-edge, again with the property that the set of triangle vertices coincides with the set of vertices of the polygon. Polygon triangulations may be found in linear time and form the basis of several important geometric algorithms, including a simple approximate solution to the art gallery problem. The constrained Delaunay triangulation is an adaptation of the Delaunay triangulation from point sets to polygons or, more generally, to planar straight-line graphs. * A triangulation of a surface consists of a net of triangles with points on a given surface covering the surface partly or totally. * In the finite element method, triangulations are often used as the mesh underlying a computation. In this case, the triangles must form a subdivision of the domain to be simulated, but instead of restricting the vertices to input points, it is allowed to add additional Steiner points as vertices. In order to be suitable as finite element meshes, a triangulation must have well-shaped triangles, according to criteria that depend on the details of the finite element simulation; for instance, some methods require that all triangles be right or acute, forming nonobtuse meshes. Many meshing techniques are known, including Delaunay refinement algorithms such as Chew's second algorithm and Ruppert's algorithm. * In more general topological spaces, triangulations of a space generally refer to simplicial complexes that are homeomorphic to the space. ==Generalization== The concept of a triangulation may also be generalized somewhat to subdivisions into shapes related to triangles. In particular, a pseudotriangulation of a point set is a partition of the convex hull of the points into pseudotriangles, polygons that like triangles have exactly three convex vertices. As in point set triangulations, pseudotriangulations are required to have their vertices at the given input points. ==External links== * * ","title":"Triangulation (geometry)"},{"id":"1440972","text":"David Sheepshanks in 2014 David Richard Sheepshanks CBE DL is the founding and current Chairman of the St George's Park National Football Centre and former Chairman of Ipswich Town FC.

Retrieved 19 February 2006. and was appointed chairman in 1995. During his time at Ipswich he oversaw a complete reorganisation of the Club, instigated his famous 5-year plan, 4 years in the play-offs culminating with promotion to the Premiership through the play off in 2000, then two seasons in the UEFA Cup however a period of administration followed relegation between February and May 2003. The other two relegated clubs that season, Leicester and Derby, suffered a similar fate when the new August transfer window took effect and the League's broadcaster, On Digital, went bankrupt. On behalf of the Board and Shareholders, he led a search for a buyer for the Club and in October 2007 it was announced that the club had secured a £44 million investment from Marcus Evans, and Sheepshanks would remain in post. The deal went ahead in December 2007. On 1 July 2009 Sheepshanks stood down as chairman and took an unpaid non-executive role at the club. In 1997, he was appointed chairman of the Football League for two years where he helped with the re- structuring of the league and appointed Richard Scudamore as CEO. He subsequently served the boards of the Football Association (FA) and FL for 12 years, as well as UEFA and the FIFA Marketing Committee 2002-2004.

Triangulation is useful in determining the properties of a topological space. For example, one can compute homology and cohomology groups of a triangulated space using simplicial homology and cohomology theories instead of more complicated homology and cohomology theories. ==Piecewise linear structures== For topological manifolds, there is a slightly stronger notion of triangulation: a piecewise-linear triangulation (sometimes just called a triangulation) is a triangulation with the extra property – defined for dimensions 0, 1, 2, . . . inductively – that the link of any simplex is a piecewise-linear sphere. The link of a simplex s in a simplicial complex K is a subcomplex of K consisting of the simplices t that are disjoint from s and such that both s and t are faces of some higher-dimensional simplex in K. For instance, in a two-dimensional piecewise-linear manifold formed by a set of vertices, edges, and triangles, the link of a vertex s consists of the cycle of vertices and edges surrounding s: if t is a vertex in this cycle, t and s are both endpoints of an edge of K, and if t is an edge in this cycle, it and s are both faces of a triangle of K. This cycle is homeomorphic to a circle, which is a 1-dimensional sphere. But in this article the word \\"triangulation\\" is just used to mean homeomorphic to a simplicial complex. For manifolds of dimension at most 4, any triangulation of a manifold is a piecewise linear triangulation: In any simplicial complex homeomorphic to a manifold, the link of any simplex can only be homeomorphic to a sphere. But in dimension n ≥ 5 the (n − 3)-fold suspension of the Poincaré sphere is a topological manifold (homeomorphic to the n-sphere) with a triangulation that is not piecewise- linear: it has a simplex whose link is the Poincaré sphere, a three- dimensional manifold that is not homeomorphic to a sphere. This is the double suspension theorem, due to R.D. Edwards in the 1970s. (reprint of private, unpublished manuscripts from the 1970's) The question of which manifolds have piecewise-linear triangulations has led to much research in topology. Differentiable manifolds (Stewart Cairns, J. H. C. Whitehead, L. E. J. Brouwer, Hans Freudenthal, James Munkres), and subanalytic sets (Heisuke Hironaka and Robert Hardt) admit a piecewise-linear triangulation, technically by passing via the PDIFF category. Topological manifolds of dimensions 2 and 3 are always triangulable by an essentially unique triangulation (up to piecewise-linear equivalence); this was proved for surfaces by Tibor Radó in the 1920s and for three-manifolds by Edwin E. Moise and R. H. Bing in the 1950s, with later simplifications by Peter Shalen. As shown independently by James Munkres, Steve Smale and J. H. C. Whitehead, each of these manifolds admits a smooth structure, unique up to diffeomorphism. In dimension 4, however, the E8 manifold does not admit a triangulation, and some compact 4-manifolds have an infinite number of triangulations, all piecewise-linear inequivalent. In dimension greater than 4, Rob Kirby and Larry Siebenmann constructed manifolds that do not have piecewise-linear triangulations (see Hauptvermutung). Further, Ciprian Manolescu proved that there exist compact manifolds of dimension 5 (and hence of every dimension greater than 5) that are not homeomorphic to a simplicial complex, i.e., that do not admit a triangulation. == Explicit methods of triangulation == An important special case of topological triangulation is that of two-dimensional surfaces, or closed 2-manifolds. There is a standard proof that smooth compact surfaces can be triangulated. Indeed, if the surface is given a Riemannian metric, each point x is contained inside a small convex geodesic triangle lying inside a normal ball with centre x. The interiors of finitely many of the triangles will cover the surface; since edges of different triangles either coincide or intersect transversally, this finite set of triangles can be used iteratively to construct a triangulation. Another simple procedure for triangulating differentiable manifolds was given by Hassler Whitney in 1957, based on his embedding theorem. In fact, if X is a closed n-submanifold of Rm, subdivide a cubical lattice in Rm into simplices to give a triangulation of Rm. By taking the mesh of the lattice small enough and slightly moving finitely many of the vertices, the triangulation will be in general position with respect to X: thus no simplices of dimension < s = m − n intersect X and each s-simplex intersecting X * does so in exactly one interior point; * makes a strictly positive angle with the tangent plane; * lies wholly inside some tubular neighbourhood of X. These points of intersection and their barycentres (corresponding to higher dimensional simplices intersecting X) generate an n-dimensional simplicial subcomplex in Rm, lying wholly inside the tubular neighbourhood. The triangulation is given by the projection of this simplicial complex onto X. == Graphs on surfaces == A Whitney triangulation or clean triangulation of a surface is an embedding of a graph onto the surface in such a way that the faces of the embedding are exactly the cliques of the graph. Equivalently, every face is a triangle, every triangle is a face, and the graph is not itself a clique. The clique complex of the graph is then homeomorphic to the surface. The 1-skeletons of Whitney triangulations are exactly the locally cyclic graphs other than K4. == References == == Further reading == * Category:Topology Category:Algebraic topology Category:Geometric topology Category:Structures on manifolds Category:Triangulation (geometry) ","title":"Triangulation (topology)"},{"id":"1440986","text":"is a Tokyo-born Japanese actor.

A packet generation model is a traffic generation model of the packet flows or data sources in a packet-switched network. For example, a web traffic model is a model of the data that is sent or received by a user's web-browser. These models are useful during the development of telecommunication technologies, in view to analyse the performance and capacity of various protocols, algorithms and network topologies . ==Application== The network performance can be analysed by network traffic measurement in a testbed network, using a network traffic generator such as iperf, bwping and Mausezahn. The traffic generator sends dummy packets, often with a unique packet identifier, making it possible to keep track of the packet delivery in the network. Numerical analysis using network simulation is often a less expensive approach. An analytical approach using queueing theory may be possible for simplified traffic model, but is often too complicated if a realistic traffic model is used. ==The greedy source model== A simplified packet data model is the greedy source model. It may be useful in analyzing the maximum throughput for best-effort traffic (without any quality-of-service guarantees). Many traffic generators are greedy sources. ==Poisson traffic model== Another simplified traditional traffic generation model for circuit- switched data as well as packet data, is the Poisson process, where the number of incoming packets or calls per time unit follows the Poisson distribution. The length of each phone call is typically modelled as an exponential distribution. The number of simultaneously ongoing phone calls follows the Erlang distribution. ==Long-tail traffic models== However, the Poisson traffic model is memoryless, which means that is does not reflect the bursty nature of packet data, also known as the long-range dependency. For a more realistic model, a self-similar process such as the Pareto distribution can be used as a long-tail traffic model. ==Payload data model== The actual content of the payload data is typically not modelled, but replaced by dummy packets. However, if the payload data is to be analyzed on the receiver side, for example regarding bit-error rate, a Bernoulli process is often assumed, i.e. a random sequence of independent binary numbers. In this case a channel model reflects channel impairments such as noise, interference and distortion. ==Standardized Internet traffic models== There are at least two standardized traffic generation models for packet-switched wireless networks: the 3GPP2 model and the 802.16 model. The 3GPP2 model is much more complex to implement but it is supposed to give more precise results. The 802.16 model is much simpler in realization. === 3GPP2 model === The 3GPP2 model is described in.CDMA2000 Evaluation Methodology Version 1.0 (Revision 0) This document describes the following types of traffic generators: * Downlink: ** HTTP/TCP ** FTP/TCP ** Wireless Application Protocol ** near real-time Video ** Voice * Uplink: ** HTTP/TCP ** FTP/TCP ** Wireless Application Protocol ** Voice ** Mobile Network Gaming The main idea is to partly implement HTTP, FTP and TCP protocols. For example, an HTTP traffic generator simulates the download of a web-page, consisting of a number of small objects (like images). A TCP stream (that's why TCP generator is a must in this model) is used to download these objects according to HTTP1.0 or HTTP1.1 specifications. These models take into account the details of these protocols' work. The Voice, WAP and Mobile Network Gaming are modelled in a less complicated way. === 802.16 model === The 802.16 model is much simpler. It was proposed in several 802.16 TG3 contributions.802.16 TG3 contributions The idea is to define three basic models: * Interrupted Poisson Process (IPP) * Interrupted Discreet Process (IDP) * Interrupted Renewal Process (IRP) * VoLTE network (vps) and mix them together in order to simulate different kinds of web-traffic. Every interrupted process may be either in ON or OFF state. The packets are generated only in ON state. The lengths of ON and OFF periods, sizes of the packets and intervals between them are defined separately in each model, so these models differ in the way their parameters are defined. These models may be mixed together, for example: 4IPP means a mix of four IPP flows with different parameters. HTTP and FTP is simulated as 4IPP; VoIP is simulated as IDP, 2IDP, 4IDP; Video is simulated as 2IRP. ==See also== * Channel model * History of network traffic models * Measuring network throughput * Mobility model * Network emulation * Network traffic simulation * Network simulator * Packet erasure channel * Radio propagation model * Queueing theory * Packet generator * Packet sniffer ==References== Category:Computer network analysis Category:Teletraffic Category:Queueing theory ","title":"Traffic generation model"},{"id":"1441005","text":"An airstone, also called an aquarium bubbler, is a piece of aquarium furniture, traditionally a piece of limewood or porous stone, whose purpose is to gradually diffuse air into the tank, eliminating the noise and large bubbles of conventional air filtration systems, and providing other benefits to the health of the fish. \\"Airstone\\" is also a brand name stone or brick veneer used by homebuilders. Airstones are sold in a very wide variety of shapes, sizes, and levels of coarseness – from extremely rough, producing larger (though still typically unnoticeable) bubbles and letting in more oxygen – to very fine, producing minuscule bubbles. Airstones are increasingly being made from bonded glass beads and synthetic products like fiberglass. There is some controversy as to the efficiency of airstones versus the conventional powerhead system. Arguments can be made in favor of both systems, and both possess certain advantages and disadvantages. Among aquarists, the choice is very much a matter of personal preference, quite often discussed in internet forums. ==Protein skimming== The original method of protein skimming, running pressurized air through a diffuser to produce large quantities of micro bubbles, remains a viable, effective, and economic choice, although newer technologies may require lower maintenance. The air stone is most often an oblong, partially hollowed block of wood, most often of the genus Tilia. The most popular wooden air-stones for skimmers are made from limewood (Tilia europaea or European limewood) although basswood (Tilia americana or American Linden), works as well, may be cheaper and is often more readily available. The wooden blocks are drilled, tapped, fitted with an air fitting, and connected by air tubing to one or more air pumps delivering at least 1 cfm. The wooden air stone is placed at the bottom of a tall column of water. The tank water is pumped into the column, allowed to pass by the rising bubbles, and back into the tank. To get enough contact time with the bubble, these units can be many feet in height. Air stone protein skimmers may be constructed as a DIY project from pvc pipes and fittings at low cost and with varying degrees of complexity . While this method has been around for many years, many regard it as inefficient for larger systems or systems with large bio-loads. ==See also== * Aeration ==External links== *Information on the airstone controversy Airstone veneer: * Category:Aquariums ","title":"Airstone"},{"id":"1441008","text":"Golubac fortress Tabula Traiana in Đerdap National Park The Đerdap National Park ( / ) stretches along the right bank of the Danube River from the Golubac Fortress ( / ) to the dam near Novi Sip, Serbia. It was established in 1974 and spreads on . The park management office is in the town of Donji Milanovac on the Danube. Across the river is the Parcul Natural Porțile de Fier in Romania. In July 2020 the wider area of the national park was designated as the UNESCO global geopark, as the first protected area from Serbia labeled that way. Apart from the Iron Gates Gorge, the geopark includes parts of the Miroč and Kučaj mountain massifs, with total area of . == Geography == The main feature and attraction of the Đerdap National Park's natural beauty is the Đerdap gorge - the famous Iron Gate - the grandiose gateway through the southern slopes of the Carpathian mountains where the longest and biggest river accumulation in former Yugoslavia is located. The Đerdap gorge, which is some long (from Golubac to Tekija), is actually a compound river valley made up of four gorges (Gornja klisura, Gospođin vir, Veliki and Mali kazan and Sipska klisura), separated from each other by ravines. In Gospođin vir, one of the greatest river depths in the world has been measured (). The cliffs of the canyon in Kazan are about high while the riverbed in this part is narrowed down to . The terrain is mountainous (Miroč mountain) with numerous caves, pits, gorges, depressions, springs (karstic spring of Blederija on Miroč) and lakes. There are several excellent natural scenic viewpoints, like the Veliki štrbac and Mali štrbac on the Miroč, above the Kazan gorge. Panoramic view includes mountains of Deli Jovan and Veliki Krš in Serbia and the Carpathians in Romania. Viewpoint Greben was named by Jovan Žujović as the \\"most beautiful hill in the Balkans\\" at the 1900 Geology congress in Budapest. Another popular feature above the Danube is the hill of Kapetan Mišin breg. The Đerdap is the longest breakthrough type gorge in Europe. === Blederija === The Blederija river springs from two karstic springs at an altitude of , under the Topla Bara peak. The springs are away from each other and one has a water temperature around , while the other has a constant . The river forms several cascades in the heavily forested area before creating the Blederija waterfall, tall. The average discharge varies greatly and during the catastrophic 2014 Southeast Europe floods, the river heavily flooded its lower valley causing damage. There are several caves left of the waterfall and the scenic viewpoint on the location of former medieval town. The waterfall is away from the closest village, Reka, from Brza Palanka and from the municipal seat of Kladovo. According to the folk mythology, the water fairies bath under the waterfall. The valley of the river is known for quality honey production. Surrounding area is rich in animal life, especially deer and wild boar, and there are two protected hunting grounds in the vicinity, Vratna and Ploče. The Blederija continues in the southeast direction and receives rivers of Sokolovica and Suvaja. After receiving the Ravna reka, it continues into the Danube. The area is today heavily forested and scarcely populated, but in the Roman period, the legionaries built a road through this valley, as a shortcut between the locations where the modern towns of Donji Milanovac and Brza Palanka are. It was used by the Roman army until the emperor Trajan cut the road through the Iron Gates gorge itself. == Name == Both Đerdap and former Serbian name for it, Demir-kapija, are Turkish in origin. Demir-kapija means \\"iron gate\\" (demirkapı) and a translation of it entered most of the other languages as the name of the gorge. Đerdap comes from girdap which means whirlpool, vortex. == Power plants == The territory of the national park is filled with a series of other important features: abundant and diversified animal and especially plant life, attractive surroundings and landscapes, cultural and historical monuments and other anthropogenic tourist attractions, including a Handbook on Yugoslavia (1987); Federal Secretariat for Information-Belgrade; Jovan Đ. Marković (1990): Enciklopedijski geografski leksikon Jugoslavije; Svjetlost-Sarajevo; Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1986); Prosveta; artificial Lake Đerdap, the largest lake in Serbia, formed by the construction of an Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station (or \\"Đerdap\\"). The plant was finished in 1972, being fourth-largest in the world at the time (according to the staff at the power plant). It was a big collaboration project between Yugoslavia and Romania. The power plant employs a large number of the residents of the nearby town of Kladovo. The \\"Đerdap\\" power plant record power production was in 1980 of over 7 terawatt-hours (TW·h) electric power. With the building of the second power plant Iron Gate II Hydroelectric Power Station (or \\"Đerdap\\" II, 1977–84) and the adjoining Lake Đerdap II , the original power plant became better known as \\"Đerdap I\\". The plans to build \\"Đerdap III\\" were also made. It wouldn't be a classical power plant with another dam, but was planned to use the hydro-electrical potential of the already existing Lake Đerdap. The reversible hydro plant was projected in the vicinity of Donji Milanovac, on the park territory in the Pesače section. The original projects are from the late 1960s, when Đerdap I was still in construction. Some preparatory works have been done in the 1970s on the location of Debelo Brdo, upstream of the mouth of the Boljetinska reka into the lake, but the idea was abandoned due to the worsening of the economic situation in Yugoslavia in the late 1970s and the power plant was never built. The concept envisioned the lifting of the lake water by the pumps from the height of , to the projected pools of Pesača and Brodica, with the capacity of , and only in the periods of the electricity surplus. During the dry or winter periods, Đerdap II would work as the classical hydro plant but using only stored waters which would fall for onto the turbines. As the entire facility and the auxiliary objects would be built on the bank of the Danube, it would be cheaper than building them on the land, as in thermo-electrical plants, and it would have twice the capacity of the Đerdap I or Kostolac thermal plant. The plant would produce 2,400 megawatts of electricity, which would cover the present consumption in the state and made Serbia an exporter of the electricity. Also, due to the mechanism of the electricity production, it wouldn't have negative consequences on the park's eco-system. == Wildlife == === Plants === Some 1,100 plant species inhabit the park. The include Tertiary relicts like Turkish hazel, walnut tree, European yew, largeleaf linden, downy oak and European holly. The Đerdap's tulip (Tulipa hungarica Borbás), became extinct after the reservoir was formed. Out of 15 species which can be found only on the Balkans are Pančić's maple and certain species of heartsease, wild thyme and meadow fescue. There are also Carpathian endemites like sweet carrot and Seseli rigidum. Internationally protected are floating fern, Fritillaria degeniana, water caltrop, Bulbophyllum loroglossum and cat grass. === Animals === The park is also a home to 150 bird species. In December 2018, a group of Dalmatian pelicans landed on the lake, close to the power plant. Their closest habitat is the Danube Delta, and they haven't been spotted in the Đerdap since 1914. The group left soon, but the pelicans returned in January 2019. == Human history == The national park is dotted with many natural and cultural values which are included in a special protection programme. Lepenski Vir is the 11,500-year-old archaeological site with exceptionally important traces of settlements and the life of the Mesolithic and later Neolithic people. Lepenski Vir was discovered in 1967 by Dragoslav Srejović, but from 1965 to 1971 over 30 sites were discovered ranging from the Mesolithic to the Late Middle Ages. Around 800 BC it was part of the transit route of the Triballi, Dacians ant the Autariates while Romans arrived in the first century BC. Đerdap was part of the border zone of the empire and was on the route of the western extension of the Via Militaris. Some remnants of the road still survive. Roman Emperor Trajan built in 105 AD a famed Trajan's Bridge, from which the several pillars survived today so as the Tabula Traiana. There was also a Roman fortress Diana in Kladovo. Altogether, there are 4 cultural monuments and 19 archaeological finds. Major medieval monument is the Golubac fortress with numerous artifacts discovered in it: pottery, iron tools, hatchets, pickaxes, spears, bolts, etc. In the vicinity of the fortress are the remnants of the Turkish bath and the memorial drinking fountain dedicated to Zawisza the Black, Polish knight who was killed defending the fortress during the 1428 Siege of Golubac. The region is known for many myths which developed in time. Two of the most popular include the one about the devil face's midget with goat ears and legs, long white beard and the conical hat. He lives in the Danube's whirlpools and shows only at night. He ascends from the depths to drown people who swim in the river or fall off their boats. The other myth is about \\"beluga\\", a gigantic sturgeon which arises from the bottom to attack people. There are 27 settlements in the park territory with the total population of 35,000. == Protection == Apart from being a national park since 1974, Đerdap is also an Important Bird Area and Important Plant Area, and has been nominated for the European Geoparks Network. == Tourism == The Đerdap National Park has become one of the most visited tourist regions in Serbia especially after the construction of the dam and the formation of the large lake. The gorge and the hydroelectric power plant can be visited from Belgrade and other cities downstream from it. There are a number of tourist points in the park with hotel and other facilities, offering tourists rest and swimming and tours of the cultural and historical monuments and natural values. Though the Danube river is quite polluted by international standards, fishing is still very popular.

His birth name was ,While the stage names of all kabuki actors have retained traditional order (Surname-Givenname) on Wikipedia, birth names of those born after the Meiji Restoration are in Western order (Givenname-Surname). and his name was legally changed several times, first to , and later to , separate from his performing name. Six months after his birth in Kyoto he became the adopted son of . He made his kabuki acting debut at the age of 15 under the name . In 1951 he was adopted by and was renamed as Ichikawa Raizō VIII. In 1954 he began a career as a film actor. He received breakout acclaim for his performance in Enjō and received several awards for the performance including the Blue Ribbon Award and the Kinema Junpo Award, both for the category of Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role. Among his fans he was referred to lovingly as \\"Rai-sama.\\" In June 1968 he was diagnosed with and underwent surgery for rectal cancer, but it metastasized to his liver and he died the following year. Ichikawa Raizō appeared mostly in period dramas (jidaigeki). He is best known for the Sleepy Eyes of Death (Nemuri Kyoshirō) series, Ninja (Shinobi no Mono) series and Nakano Spy School (Rikugun Nakano Gakkō) series (based on the Nakano School). Raizō worked many times with director Kenji Misumi. Their collaborations include The Sword (Ken) (from a book by Yukio Mishima) and Destiny's Son (Kill!). Other great works include An Actor's Revenge (Yukinojo henge). He was so admired for his gracefulness that in his lifetime he was called \\"the genius who thinks with his body.\\" == Biography == === Birth and adoption by Ichikawa Kudanji III === Ichikawa Raizō was born in the Nakagyō ward of Kyoto on August 29, 1931. At the time of his birth, he was named Akio Kamezaki. At six months of age he was adopted by Ichikawa Kudanji III, who renamed him Yoshio Takeuchi.雷蔵, 雷蔵を語る (Raizō, Raizō ga Kataru), Chronology. According to the film critic Rikiya Tayama, the details of his adoption are as follows: While Raizō's mother was pregnant, Raizō's father was transferred to Nara as an in the Imperial Japanese Army, leaving her behind at his family's home. She was persecuted by his family and attempted to reach out to him for help but was ignored. When she could no longer bear it she fled to her own family's home, where Raizō was born.Tayama 1988, pp. 14-15.ノーベル書房 (Nōberu Shobo) (collected) 1991, p. 265. The relationship between her and her husband having deteriorated, Raizo's mother intended to raise him on her own. At this point she received repeated petitions from her husband's brother-in-law, Ichikawa Kudanji III, to allow him to raise the child. She initially refused these offers, but ultimately relented, and Raizō was officially adopted by Kudanji at the age of six months.Tayama 1988, pp. 15-17. Raizō was not aware of his adoption until he was 16 years old, and he did not meet his mother in person until he was 30.ノーベル書房 (Nōberu Shobo) (collected) 1991 pp. 264-266. === Kabuki Debut (1934 – May 1949) === In 1934, about two years after his adoption by Ichikawa Kudanji III, Raizō moved from Kyoto to Osaka. Kudanji did not train him as a kabuki actor during his childhood,Ichikawa 1995 p. 16. but in 1946, when he was in his third and final year at Osaka Prefectural Tennoji High School, Raizō elected to withdraw from school to pursue an acting career.On the experience of becoming a kabuki actor, Raizō himself said that as he was on the verge of quitting junior high school and simply spending his time about the house instead, he got something of an interest in the world of kabuki and somehow ended up as a kabuki actor,（Ichikawa 1995, pp. 16-18）but in fact he had attempted to join the Japanese Imperial Navy as an officer or a doctor. His myopia made officership unattainable, and he ended up abandoning hope of becoming a doctor as well.（Tayama 1988, p. 18, Hosaka 2001, p. 321）Tayama 1988, p. 18.Hosaka 2001, p. 321. In November 1946, at the age of 15, Raizō made his kabuki debut at the Osaka Kabukiza theater under the name Ichikawa Enzō III (Kudanji had previously used the name Ichikawa Enzō II).わたしの雷蔵 (Watashi no Raizō), p. 260.Tayama 1988, pp. 18-19. His first role was the part of Lady Ohana (Musume Ohana) in the play Nakayamashichiri. In May 1949, a little over two years after his first performance, Raizō formed a study group with two other young kabuki performers. These were Rishō Arashi (known later in his kabuki career as Arashi Kichisaburō VIII, and as Yatarō Kitagami in his acting career) and Nakamura Taro II. They called this group the , which can be translated as \\"exhaustive meeting,\\" and together they focused diligently on training. However, there was one obstacle that this training could not overcome: Kudanji had been the son of a member of a minor politician in Kyoto rather than a kabuki actor, and had only been apprenticed (to an actor known as Ichikawa Sadanji II) because of Kudanji's own strong desire to enter the world of kabuki. Thus Kudanji was forever labeled as a montei agari – someone born and raised outside of the kabuki world and its \\"lineage\\" and later apprenticed into it – and doomed never to exceed a supporting role.Tayama 1988, p. 17. That being the case, no matter how hard Raizō trained, he was unlikely to gain noteworthy roles as a kenmon performer as long as he remained the son of Kudanji. === Adoption by Ichikawa Jūkai III (June 1949 – June 1951) === Commemorative photo of Ichikawa Raizō VIII on the day of his adoption by Ichikawa Jukai III in April, 1951 In 1949, in the same period that Raizō was establishing the Tsukushikai, a kabuki theater director named Tetsuji Takechi was scouting for young, talented kabuki performers to join his traditionalist troupe, Tetsuji Kabuki.Takechi Kabuki’s first production opened in December 1949. The members of the Tsukushikai participated in this troupe and thus made the acquaintance of Tetsuji. Tetsuji thought very highly of Raizō's acting talents, but realized that so long as he remained known as Kudanji's son he would never be able to truly shine in the world of kabuki and his talent would be wasted.ノーベル書房 (Nōberu Shobo) (collected) 1991, p. 195. To that end Tetsuji formed a plan to have Raizō take the name of , which had been unused for a quarter century, but Nakamura Jakuemon III – who was no longer performing, but still alive – was dissatisfied with Raizō's thus-far inability to gain real recognition and refused to allow the name's use.Tayama 1988, p. 21-22. After that, it is known that Tetsuji intended to apprentice Raizō under the childless .\\"I've heard that when Rokusuke Ei was a child, there was a plan to have him adopted by Ichikawa Jukai III. Ei refused, saying he didn't want to become a kabuki actor.\\" (「編集手帳」(Henshū Techō) 読売新聞 (Dokubai Shimbun) September 6, 2014). In December 1950, Ichikawa Jukai III attended a meeting of the Tsukushikai in an observational capacity. He was highly impressed by Raizō's performance as Minamoto no Yoriie in the play Shuzenji Monogatari. Jukai had been the son of a kimono-maker and thus had had no connection to the world of kabuki through his lineage, but despite this, through great effort on his part, Jukai had become quite renowned in the Kansai kabuki scene during and after the Second World War. By the time he met Raizō in 1950, Jukai had become the president of the Kansai Kabuki Actors Guild, a position of great influence. Furthermore, the name \\"Jukai\\" had been bestowed upon Ichikawa Jukai III by both of the actors who had used it before: Ichikawa Danjūrō VII and Ichikawa Danjūrō IX; and he had even been granted usage of the and yagō and kamon traditionally used by the head of the Ichikawa line.The “Kotobuki Ebi” is currently used by Ichikawa Ebizō, representative of the Ichikawa line, as an alternative to his usual kamon as his acting symbol. With the help of some mutual friends, Tetsuji was successful in his efforts and Jukai agreed to officially adopt Raizō.Tayama 1988, pp. 22-23. At this point Jukai wished to give Raizō the name , a name with deep roots in the Ichikawa house stretching back to the 1600s, but the chief cabinet secretary of the Ichikawa house, Ichikawa En'ō II, viciously fought against this wish, stating \\"We can't bestow a name with such deep family ties to some unknown performer from an unknown line.\\"It was hoped that Ichikawa Shinzō V, who was adopted by Ichikawa Danjurō IX, would someday take the name “Ichikawa Danjurō X,” but he fell ill and died young, so this never came to pass. After long negotiations they finally settled on the name \\"Ichikawa Raizō.\\"Tayama 1988, p. 27. The adoption was finalized in April 1951, and the ceremony for the succession of the \\"Ichikawa Raizo\\" name was carried out in June of the same year.Tayama 1988, pp. 27-28.市川1995, pp. 297-298. According to the film director Kazuo Ikehiro, around this time rumors began to circulate that Ichikawa Jukai III was actually Raizō's biological father.Muro'oka 1993, p. 208. Upon his second adoption Raizō's legal name was changed again as well, to Yoshiya Ōta. This name was chosen by Raizō himself, as he was weary of being judged by his current family name.Muramatsu 2006, pp. 234-236. According to Akinari Suzuki, the studio president of Daiei Kyoto Studio, Raizō often advised those around him to consider changing their names, and it's said that some 20 to 30 people related to the film studio did so upon Raizō's recommendation. In fact, Masako Nagata, the woman Raizō would eventually marry, was originally named Kyōko, and changed her given name after Raizō suggested she do so.Tayama 1988, p. 74. === Transition into Film Acting (July 1951 – 1957) === Raizō became Jukai's adopted son in 1951, but Jukai believed that the 20-year-old Raizō was still too young to take on major roles and adopted a policy of only giving him minor roles for the time being.Tayama 1988, p. 28. As a result of this Raizō decided to pursue a film career in 1954 and joined the Daiei film studio.Tayama 1988, pp. 28-30. Regarding his transition to film acting, Raizō maintained that he did it simply because it seemed like a good opportunity and he wanted to try it out.市川1995, pp. 20-21. Rikiya Tayama has said that the real reason was that Raizō, dissatisfied with the treatment he received over the years, was extremely upset when he was cast as an idiot without a single line in the Osaka Kabukiza's performance of Kōya Hijiri in June 1954,Raizō, who had been pining after a role in Kōyahijiri, said to Tetsuji Takechi, “thanks to this, I’ll be stuck as a supporting actor for all time.”（ノーベル書房 (Nōberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, 196.） and thus decided to leave the world of kabuki for good. Fortuitously he received an offer from Daiei Films who intended to position him as a star in their jidaigeki – period dramas – and accepted it, leaving the kabuki world for film.Tayama 1988, pp. 28-30. From that time forwards, Raizō only performed in a single kabuki play: the January 1964 production of Kanjinchō directed by Tetsuji Takechi at the newly completed Nissay Theater, in which he played Yasuie Togashi. On that occasion Raizō said, \\"In Kabuki you're no good unless you're old. In film you're no good once you're old. While I'm still young I'll make a living in film, once I've gotten older I'll try kabuki again.\\"Tayama 1988, pp. 76-77. Once he had decided to pursue a film career, Raizō began to frequent the movie theater to study the performances of Yorozuya Kinnosuke in jidaigeki produced by Toei.Hosaka 2001, p. 324. Raizō made his film debut on August 25, 1954 in The Great White Tiger Platoon (Hana no Byakkotai). While Raizō had been held back in the world of kabuki by the circumstances of his parentage, he was treated with great respect in the world of film, as the son of Ichikawa Jukai III, president of the Kanto Kabuki Guild. Daiei's management intended to position Raizō as a successor to the popular Kazuo Hasegawa, and gave Raizō the starring role in his fifth and sixth films, The Young Swordsman (Shiode Kushima Binan Kenpō), released December 22, 1954, and The Second Son (Jinanbō Garasu), released January 29, 1955.Tayama 1988, pp. 34-35. In 1955, two years after his film debut, Raizō received great attention for his portrayal of Taira no Kiyomori in director Kenji Mizoguchi's Shin Heike Monogatari, released on September 21 of that year. Tokuzō Tanaka, director of 16 of Raizō's films, stated that at first it seemed as though it would be difficult to make Raizō into a great success, but that impression changed instantly with Shin Heike Monogatari.Muro'oka 1993, p. 102. Kazuo Ikehiro, who directed another 16 of Raizō's films, said that until that point it had seemed that Raizō was simply imitating Kazuo Hasegawa, but bit by bit his innate acting talent had begun to shine through.Muro'oka 1993, p. 210. The film critic Tadao Sato wrote that until now Raizō had \\"portrayed only handsome young samurai and yakuza, as though following in the footsteps of Kazuo Hasegawa\\" but that now he \\"has come to be a distinguished actor worthy of high praise, giving fresh performances in elegant dramas, rather than only performing in chanbara – samurai films with an action focus.Satō 2006, p. 298. In the wake of Shin Heike Monogatari, Raizō performed in over 10 films released in the period of a single year. He worked tirelessly, giving up holidays and weekends to continue filming.Tayama 1988, p. 47. Raizō had weak legs, and would often become faint when standing or walking.Tayama 1988, p. 34.Muro'oka 1993, pp. 254, 270. Masayoshi Tsuchida, then head of Daiei's planning department, said that it must have been an incredible adventure to play \\"Kiyomori, the youth who pierced the heavens\\" for the physically frail Raizō. Raizō was self-conscious about the weakness of his legs and joined the sumo club at Doshisha University in an attempt to train and strengthen them, but it was no use. Whenever photos were taken of Raizō, the photography staff took special precautions to frame the shot in such a way as to avoid showing Raizō's weak legs.Muro'oka 1993, p. 254.ノーベル書房 (Nōberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, pp. 282-283. According to Kenji Misumi, director of 18 of Raizō's films, Raizō deeply loathed the physical frailty of his body, but when he finally managed to overcome that loathing and accept himself he became capable of incredible composure. === Rise to Stardom (1958 – May 1968) === In 1958 Kon Ichikawa cast Raizō in the lead role of the film Enjō, based on the novel The Temple of the Golden Pavilion by Yukio Mishima. The film was released on August 19 of that year. According to Ichikawa, Hiroshi Kawaguchi was originally intended for the role, but Ichikawa argued against this selection based on an instinctive feeling that Raizō was the right choice for the role and ultimately succeeded in convincing the studio president, Masaichi Nagata, to cast Raizō instead.Muro'oka 1993, pp. 11-12. There was some resistance within the studio, as it was felt that a newcomer with a stammer should not be given such a large role in his second film with the studio,Muro'oka 1993, pp. 12, 271. but he was ultimately given the part, stating \\"we need to give the young actor Ichikawa Raizō a chance if we want to make him into a success.\\"Ichikawa 1995, p. 32. Raizō rose to the occasion and gave an excellent performance. Ichikawa praised Raizō's acting, saying \\"I give it a perfect score, 100 of 100. There's simply nothing else to say.\\"Muro'oka 1993, p. 23. It's often said that Raizō's performance in Enjō reflected his childhood. Ichikawa said, \\"He's expressing something of his true self through his performance,\\" and \\"He's overcome something through his acting ... some sort of burden he had been carrying; and his indescribable life can be seen in his expression.\\"Muro'oka 1993, pp. 17-18. Tokuzō Tanaka said that Raizō's complicated childhood had caused something like a base part of his heart to emerge, merging with and adding depth to his performance.Muro'oka 1993, p. 107. Kazuo Ikehiro said that precisely because of this \\"hidden part of his childhood,\\" or \\"base part of his heart,\\" that Raizō was perfectly equipped for the performance.Muro'oka 1993, pp. 206-208. Once, when a member of the Daiei planning department named Hisakazu Tsuji mused aloud that he felt as though his performance in Enjō reflected Raizō's childhood, Raizō did not refute it.Tayama 1988, p. 57. For his performance in Enjō, Raizō received the Kinema Junpo Award for best male actor in a leading role, and the Blue Ribbon Award for best performer in a leading role, among others. Raizō's position as a star had been secured.Tayama 1988, pp. 54-57. The Nemuri Kyoshirō series of films, which began in 1963 and are known as Sleepy Eyes of Death in the west, are considered to be the representative work of Raizō's later years. According to Tokuzō Tanaka, playing the part of the protagonist, Kyoshirō, was an extreme challenge for Raizō. Speaking of the first film in the series, Sappōchō, even Raizō himself said that \\"the characteristic 'hollowness' of Kyoshirō simply didn't come out at all\\" and deemed the film a failure.Ichikawa 1995, pp. 218-220. It wasn't until the fourth film, Joyōken, that Raizō succeeded in bringing the hollowness, dandyism and nihilism of the character to life.Muro'oka 1993, p. 113-116. The actor Shintarō Katsu described Raizō's performance in the Nemuri Kyoshirō films, saying \\"When he was playing Kyoshirō he had a real animal magnetism about him, didn't he. Maybe you could say it came from this sense of the shadow of death hanging over him. It really is the face people make when they die, that expression.\\" “When he’d walk by, Rai-chan would cut you with his face. Not with a sword, with his face,” he reminisced, “Rai-chan didn’t become Kyoshirō through his fight scenes or the delivery of his lines, he did it through his face; that’s my opinion, anyway.”Muro'oka 1993, p. 256. Kazuo Ikehiro said, “without speaking, without any kind of facial expression, simply by the way he walked around as though he were carrying his past on his back”Tayama 1988, pp. 72-73. Akira Inoue, director of the seventh film in the series, Tajōken, said that there were other actors who played Kyoshirō, but none of them could compare to Raizō when it came to portraying Kyoshirō's soul.Hosaka 2001, pp. 328-329. Raizō went on to hold the starring role in 12 films in the series, which represents a majority of the starring roles for which Raizō was cast. According to Kazuo Ikehiro, as Raizō's experience as an actor accumulated he began to desire to take a larger role in film creation through directing. Ikehiro advised Raizō to pursue the role of producer, rather than director, as he would then be able to make decisions about subject matter, scripts, and casting in addition to direction.わたしの雷蔵 (Watashi no Raizō), pp. 38-39. In January 1968, Raizō said “I want to assemble a new dramatic production, the likes of which has never been seen before,” and began the process of establishing a new theater company called “Teatoro Kaburaya” at which he would take a producer role, but as soon as it was founded he fell ill and the company never began operations.ノーベル書房 (Nōberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, pp. 325-333. According to Seiji Hoshikawa, director of 14 of Raizō's films, Raizō said to Hoshikawa and Kenji Misumi, “Cinema might not have that much time left. Let’s stage a play sometime, the three of us. Let’s give a new job a shot,” and more specifically “Let’s try to capture Kawatake Mokuami’s works through a modern lens.”Hosaka 2001, pp. 319. === The Final Years and Premature Death at Age 37 (June 1968 – July 17th, 1969) === In June 1968, while in the process of filming Seki no Yatappe, Raizō visited a doctor because of bloody stool, and was soon admitted to the hospital.Tayama 1988, p. 86. The results of his examinations clearly indicated rectal cancer, but the diagnosis was not made known to Raizō.Ōta 2009 (\\"Bungeishunjū\\" May 2009 special issue, p. 361.) On August 10, Raizō underwent surgery and was released from the hospital, but his family received a prognosis from his doctor stating that Raizō would “relapse in about half a year.” Raizō had possessed a weak digestive system from birth,Tayama 1988, p. 58. and had previously visited a doctor for the same symptoms in January 1961, after filming Kutsukake Tokijirō. At that time he had been told simply that “there is a wound in the rectum” when examined. There's also a record of him confiding to Tetsuji Takechi, “I’m tormented by diarrhea,” in 1964, at the occasion of his performance of Kanjinchō at the Nissay Theater.Tayama 1988, p. 79. After leaving the hospital, Raizo performed in the films Nemuri Kyōshirō: Akujo-gari (released January 11, 1969), and Bakuto Ichidai: Chimatsuri Fudō (released February 12, 1969), but his physical strength was rapidly dwindling, and they had to resort to a body double with voice-over for all of his scenes involving walking and movement.Muramatsu 2006, p. 243. In February 1969, complaining of physical unwellness, Raizō was admitted to the hospital once again. After his second surgery Raizō was so weak that he couldn't swallow soup,太田2009(\\"'Bungeishunjū'\\" May 2009 special issue, p. 362.） but he deeply wished to play the role of a naval officer in the film Aa, Kaigun, and began talks with people related to the film. His recovery was not complete by the time filming began, and Daiei cast Nakamura Kichiemon II as a substitute in order to begin filming. After learning of the recast by reading it in the newspaper, Raizō never again spoke about work.Muramatsu 2006, p. 260. He died several months later, on July 17, of liver cancer, at the age of 37. His funeral was held on July 23, at the Ikegami Honmon-ji temple in the Ōta ward of Tokyo. His grave is at the same temple. It has been said that in the time before his death, Raizō deliriously entreated that nobody be allowed to see his face when he died.ノーベル書房 (Nōberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, p. 257. His wife, Masako Ōta, staunchly denies these claims, stating “Raizō never gave up on recovery, even until the end; he never even wrote a will.”太田2009(\\"'Bungeishunjū'\\" May 2009 special issue, p. 362-363.） Nevertheless, after his death Raizō's face was wrapped in two layers of white cloth, which remained in place even as he was cremated.Tayama 1988, pp. 6-7. According to Masako, Raizō had said only “I don’t want anyone to see how dreadfully thin I've become,” and because of that wish she had not allowed anyone aside from his adopted father, Jukai, and his company president, Nagata, to see his face after his death. Raizō's final film, Bakuto Ichidai: Chimatsuri Fudō, was an example of the then-popular ninkyō eiga – pro-yakuza films – produced by Toei Studios. Raizō was reluctant to participate, saying “Should I just reheat the scraps left by Kōji Tsuruta?” – Tsurata being an actor well known for performing in such films – but Masayoshi Tsuchiya convinced him, saying “I’ll make sure you get the next role you want to play.” The following year Tsuchiya expressed deep regret that this role which Raizō had not wanted to play had become his last. In 1971, two years after Raizō's death, Daiei Studios filed for bankruptcy. Seiji Hoshikawa reflected on this, saying “Raizō’s death was a precursor to Daiei’s bankruptcy.”Muro'oka 1993, p. 122. === Raizō's Legacy (July 17, 1969 – Present) === Raizō and Jukai's names can be seen inscribed on this tōrō, which is located at the Yasaka Shrine in Gion, Kyoto.In 1974, five years after Raizō's death, a fan club called “Raizō- kai” was formed.わたしの雷蔵 (Watashi no Raizō), Foreword and colophon. This fan club is still functioning as of this writing in 2012. According to Masaki Matsubara, once president of Daiei Kyoto Studios, Raizō's fans were drawn in by his acting and his humanity, and thus, unlike many other stars of the time, his fanbase had the rare characteristic of having many intelligent and educated female fans. “You didn’t see the type that only squealed and caused a big fuss,” he said.Hosaka 2001, p. 311. The “Ichikawa Raizo Film Festival,” in which a selection of his films are shown, became an annual event, held each year on the anniversary of his death, July 17. From December 2009 until May 2011 an especially large event was held and his performances were screened to commemorate the 40th anniversary of his passing. In 2000, Kinema Junpō published an article titled “Film Stars of the 20th Century: Male Actors.” Raizō placed 6th. In the same issue's “Readers’ Choice: Male Film Stars of the 20th Century\\" he was ranked 7th. In the 2014 list of “All Time Best Japanese Film Stars” he was ranked 3rd in the list of male actors. In a 2014 blog post, Ichikawa Ebizō XI implied that the honorific name Ichikawa Raizō was under his care, and thus it can be seen as having been returned to the Ichikawa house and line following Raizō's death. == Family == Raizō married Masako Nagata, daughter of Masaichi Nagata, in a private wedding ceremony in 1962.太田2009(\\"'Bungeishunjū'\\" May 2009 special issue, p. 357.） She took his name, becoming Masako Ōta, and they had three children together.太田2009(\\"'Bungeishunjū'\\" May 2009 special issue, p. 358.） Raizō had told Masako “I never want [my family] in the public eye,” when he was alive,Hosaka 2001, p. 332. and she continued to uphold his wishes after his death太田2009(\\"'Bungeishunjū'\\" May 2009 special issue, p. 354.） until 40 years had passed, when a special issue of Bungeishunjū was published in 2009, featuring a memoir by Masako Ōta titled “A love letter to my husband, Ichikawa Raizo, 40 years later.” == Awards == Data taken from “雷蔵, 雷蔵を語る” (Raizō, Raizō ga Kataru) * January 1959: Kinema Junpō – Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Enjō) * February 1959: Blue Ribbon Award – Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, NHK Film – Excellence in a Male Leading Role (Enjō, Benten Kozō) * September 1959: Cinema Nuovo – Excellence in a Male Role (Enjō) * November 1964: Tokyo Citizens’ Film Festival – Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Ken) * February 1967: NHK Film – Excellence in a Male Leading Role, Kinema Junpō – Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Hanaoka Seishū no Tsuma) * November 1968: Tokyo Citizens’ Film Festival – Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role (Hanaoka Seishū no Tsuma) * November 1969: Tokyo Citizens’ Film Festival – Makino Shōzō Prize == Acclaim == === Acting === The screenwriter Fuji Yahiro said of Raizō's manners, “Regardless of to whom he was speaking, he was always polite and proper, without arrogance or effusive emotion,” and that shone through in his acting style. According to Yahiro, “Even among the great number of jidaigeki actors, nobody else had his good manners – and I mean that in a good way – not a single other actor felt like a true bushi-like swordsman the way he did.”ノーベル書房 (Nōberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, p. 245. Kazuo Ikehiro said that Raizō's childhood cast a “shadow of heartlessness” over him, and because of that a “shadowed part” and a “true background part\\" of his life were exposed. Moreover, they were not merely exposed, but thrust forward willfully, in Ikehiro's estimation. Kazuo Mori, the director with whom Raizō produced the greatest number of films, said that Raizo carried “a human pain of which he didn’t speak to anyone” which he sublimated into each of his performances.Hosaka 2001, p. 325. In an interview between Mori and the film critic Sadao Yamane, the two agreed that Raizō had a “refreshing sorrow” about him. Yamane explained this further, saying “while it’s true that he played a great many tragic roles, it wasn’t simply with a dark depression or gloom; he had a very crisp presentation. There wasn’t a single other actor who was equipped with both this sorrow and this cool crispness the way that Raizō was.” Tadao Satō said of Raizō's acting, that whether in jidaigeki or in modern dramas, “whether the most miserable role or the most comedic, he acted with elegance and lent sophistication and grace to the final product.”Satō 2006, p. 368. Film critic Saburō Kawamoto said of Raizō's acting, “even when he’s here, he’s not here,” and clarified, “even in this filthy world, there was a sense of purity about him, as though he were a glimpse into a faraway place.” “Some people might take my saying ‘sense of purity’ as some sort of posturing phrase, but it's not.”Kawamoto 2005, p. 164. Two of Raizō’s contemporaries, Sakata Tōjūrō IV and Nakamura Jakuemon IV, also attempted to change careers from kabuki to film, but failed to find success and returned to the kabuki stage. When asked his thoughts on this, Akinari Suzuki said that he felt that Raizō had found success in film because he was not steeped in kabuki in his young childhood, and thus avoided being totally stained by it.Muro'oka 1993, p. 390. === Appearance === Raizō usually looked plain, not eye-catching, but when his makeup was applied for a film shoot he would completely transform. Many people in the film industry spoke about this particular quirk. According to Arashi Ichikawa, Raizō’s essence was “hardness divided by simplicity,” and in stark contrast to other stars when playing their popular characters, Raizō's unmade-up simplicity “would transform completely with makeup,” he said of this peculiar quirk.Muro'oka 1993, pp. 12-13, 48-50. According to Akira Inoue, when given makeup Raizō's usual appearance would become completely different and beautiful. “Makeup would change him so suddenly, to the point where you’d say ‘woah! Who’s this?’” he said.ノーベル書房 (Nōberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, p. 287. Tokuō Tanaka said, “this guy, with his disarming warmth and aura of purity; as soon as work began he’d transform into an actor, he’d stiffen his shoulders and become immediately commanding, steadfast, dignified and strikingly good-looking. For someone like me who knew his usual face, it was so surprising that it made my eyes pop open.” According to Inoue, at the time of his debut, Raizō, along with Shintarō Katsu and Takeshi Hanayagi, received makeup instruction from the star Kazuo Hasegawa. The other two actors applied their makeup exactly as told, but Raizō alone had a number of points where he made personal alterations to the makeup plan. In particular, Raizō's original designs could be seen in the makeup around his eyes and eyebrows. Furthermore, Raizō carried out the most important points of his makeup application himself, and wouldn't allow anyone to see him while doing it. Inoue theorizes that the application of makeup was a crucial part of his process for immersing himself in a role, and thus he didn't want to be observed while doing so.Hosaka 2001, pp. 327-328. Yoshio Shirasaki, screenwriter of Kōshoku Ichidai Otoko (First-generation Lecher), said of Raizō's transformation that he normally looked like a company man, but “when he appeared on the screen he’d have undergone a complete change; and in the midst of all the light was this youthful star, fighting against emptiness and loneliness.”ノーベル書房 (Nōberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, p. 258. Inoue said that the reason that so many of Raizō's movie posters feature an image of him from behind with his head turned to face the camera was because many directors felt that this view of him best showed off his \\"intriguing emptiness\\".Hosaka 2001, p. 328. == Parallels and Comparison to Shintarō Katsu == Raizō, Ayako Wakao, and Shintaro Katsu (1959) Raizō, as written above, was the son of Ichikawa Kudanji III, a supporting actor by trade, and for a time was known as Ichikawa Enzō II. Shintarō Katsu was the son of Kineya Katsutōji, a nagauta performer and shamisen player, and for a time was known as Kineya Katsumaru II. Both Raizō and Katsu signed on with Daiei in 1954, and joined the company in the same term. Both born in 1931, having made a hurried transition from kabuki to the new world of film, there were many similar circumstances about the pair of young actors. As previously mentioned, Daiei's management intended from the start to position Raizō as a successor to the star Kazuo Hasegawa,Tayama 1988, pp. 34-35. and it “proceeded smoothly along the tracks.”Muramatsu 2005, p. 78. Tokuzō Tanaka shared the opinion that Katsu, who was the first of the two to make his debut, was “like a second helping of Hasegawa” when he played an attractive young man in his white-faced film makeup;Muro'oka 1993, pp. 103-104. but as the director and supporting cast could hardly be described as first-rate, it was a long time before Katsu managed to become a real success.Muramatsu 2006, pp. 99-100. It wasn't until the 1960s and the release and success of the Akumyō and Zatoichi series that Katsu became widely discussed and surpassed Raizō in earnings.Muramatsu 2006, pp. 94, 100-101, 134-135. Akinari Suzuki said of Katsu, “It wasn’t until after shooting 70 or 80 films without a single real hit, that he finally became of use with the release of Akumyō.”Muro'oka 1993, p. 393. According to Tokuzō Tanaka, audience reception to Shiranui Kengyō, released in 1960, was particularly terrible, despite Katsu's highly acclaimed performance, to the point that Tanaka received complaints from movie theater owners about his constant use of Katsu in his films.Muramatsu 2006, p. 99. Reflecting on the state of things in 1959, Katsu said “The banzuke was totally different,” referring to the document listing sumo wrestlers’ ranks before a tournament. “We already knew that Raizō was an ōzeki or a yokozuna. I still hadn’t entered the san’yaku,” meaning that Raizō could be considered to be among the very highest regarded stars, while Katsu was still a relative unknown.Muro'oka 1993, p. 228. Eventually the pair became treated as a unit, with the name “KATSURAISU,” taking Katsu's surname and the first half of Raizō's given name to create a name which happened to sound like the food dish “katsu rice.”Hosaka 2001, p. 309. When the two appeared on movie posters and in films together under this slogan, they were often made to appear in contrast to one another in their appearance and style, and it was widely believed that there was a strong rivalry between them. However, their usage of friendly nicknames like “Rai-chan” and “Katchan” for each other indicates that their relationship certainly wasn't bad, and in fact might even have been quite friendly. In fact, Raizō had a close friendship with Katsu's wife, Tamao Nakamura, from childhood, as her father, Nakamura Kanjirō II, was a Kansai-based kabuki actor like Raizō's adopted fathers.市川1995, p. 264. The author Tomomi Muramatsu indicated that for Raizo, who had “worriedly spent his days in the world of kabuki, which is so dominated by lineage and ceremony, without ever receiving a large role,”Muramatsu 2005, p. 82. and Katsu, whose father had been involved in the backstage world of kabuki,Muramatsu 2005, p. 86. shared “the same complex, this large problem to be solved,” and that they were both equipped with “a similar factor which served as a sort of energy source” for them. ; Acting Style and Ability : Raizō was known for constantly offering all manner of suggestions during the pre-production process, and thus acquired the nickname “Goterai,” seemingly a pun on goteru, a Japanese word meaning “to fuss about, to harp on.” However, once he was satisfied in his understanding, he never complained or grumbled, and once filming began he would stop making these sorts of suggestions altogether.Tayama 1988, p. 36.Muro'oka 1993, p. 104.ノーベル書房 (Nōberu Shobo) (Complete) 1991, pp. 243-244.Muramatsu 2006, pp. 102-103, 137. On the other hand, Katsu would go through the entire pre- production phase without saying a word, but start making suggestions and impromptu changes as soon as filming began which was a frequent source of trouble for the staff of his films.Muro'oka 1993, pp. 104-106.Muramatsu 2006, p. 103. : According to Akira Inoue, Raizō was quite capable of working together with the methodologies of various directors when acting. For example, even within the same Nemuri Kyōjiro series, the films made under different directors are said to have a different flavor to them. On the other hand he said when speaking of Katsu, “When it comes to Zatoichi, it’s Katchan’s Zatoichi, in all of them.”Muro'oka 1993, pp. 265-266. Akinari Suzuki has made similar statements regarding the two actors.Muramatsu 2006, pp. 135-136. Tomomi Muramatsu, said that Katsu was the kind of actor where “no matter what he does, it always ends up in the vein of Shintarō Katsu,” but that Raizō, even though he was established as a mainstream Japanese film star in the ranks of Kazuo Hasegawa and Chiezō Kataoka, would always be very flexible and receptive to direction, which was highly unusual for the stars of that era.Muramatsu 2005, pp. 84-85. : Tokuzō Tanaka, who directed films with both actors, compared their fighting scenes speaking largely favorably of Raizō, “his lower body always feels somewhat undetermined, but despite that his movement is quite real enough;” but he had to declare Katsu the superior of the two, saying “Katchan is just unbelievably agile.”Muro'oka 1993, p. 118. ; Personality : According to Kazuo Ikehiro, even when working with someone he didn’t like, Katsu could “usually manage to get along,” but “when [Raizō] disliked someone, he disliked them completely” to the point where there had been cases when he had said “I don’t even want to see your face” directly to someone. Ikehiro said that Raizō was particularly bothered by people who took their jobs lightly and did sloppy work.Muro'oka 1993, p. 208. : Speaking of their interactions with other film staff Yoshinobu Nishioka, who worked as a production designer on many of Daiei’s films, said that Katsu was the sort to go out drinking with other actors, while Raizō would often socialize with the production staff.Muramatsu 2006, p. 90. Tokuzō Tanaka corroborates, saying that Raizō was incredibly friendly and helpful with the staff, often inviting people to his home for dinner and other such activities.Muro'oka 1993, p. 106. According to Seiji Hoshikawa, Raizō didn’t much like “glitzy and neon-decked or famous restaurants,” but instead “would nearly always eat regular restaurants, without any regards to social standing,” where he would “happily argue and discuss life and films.”Hosaka 2001, p. 320. : Fujio Morita, who served as cinematographer on Raizō’s Nemuri Kyoshirō: Enjō-ken and Katsu’s Zatoichi: Nitan-kiri at about the same time, said of their personalities that Raizō was very diligent and serious, while describing Katsu as desperate.Muro'oka 1993, p. 300. ==Filmography== The filmography of Ichikawa Raizō includes 158 films:http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p0154900.htm accessed 22 January 2009 ===1950s=== (1950s is complete) * 1954: * 1954: * 1954: * 1954: * 1954: * 1955: * 1955: * 1955: * 1955: a.k.a.

A fajã () is a Portuguese-language term of obscure origin designating supratidal talus- platform geology constructed from landslides or lava flows, that are relatively common coastal features, occurring on the toe of cliffs.G. Lameiras et al. (2009), p.827 Although they exist throughout the world, they are distinct features of the islands of the Azores and Madeira, as well as of the Canary Islands, where the equivalent term in Spanish is fajana. The term also designates a flat land of small extension, generally located by the sea and cultivable, formed of materials detached from the cliffs. ==Geology== The detritic platform of Caldeira de Santo Cristo, with its emblematic lagoon Calheta Fajãs are created from collapsing cliffs or lava flows and are identifiable along the coast as \\"flat\\" surfaces (relative to the other geology). Tides and tidal currents are minor influencers of the coastal morphology, and therefore, sedimentation and deposits became permanent. Composed of fertile soils, these microclimates allow the cultivation of a variety of staple and exotic plants, such as coffee. ===Azores=== These debris fields exist in all the archipelago of the Azores, but are concentrated on the island of São Jorge . The island is volcanic in character with steep cliffs running down to the coast, and where fajãs extend into the sea caused by the collapse of these cliffs. The long fetch of the Azores is a high-energy wave climate, and the steep submarine slopes and absence of shallow shelves produce localized patterns of wave shoaling, refraction and diffraction: especially during storms. This leads to the fragmentation of the coast into a number of dynamic cells whose sediment alongshore is limited by impermeable boundaries. There are fajãs on both sides of the island: along the southern coast are the notable fajãs of Velas, Vimes, Bodes, Além, São João, Cardoso and Alabaçal, while in the north there are a succession of smaller fajãs (resulting from the collapse of lands cut by small ravines). The exception to this are the Fajãs of Caldeira do Santo Cristo (with an underwater cave and an open lagoon); the Fajã dos Cubres (with closed lagoon ecosystem) crystalline lake; the Fajã do Ouvidor, a dendritic fajã extending into the sea, used by fishers. Although many of these fajãs have been abandoned, the settlements which include abandoned homes, mills and fountains continue to be iconic outposts on hiking trails. The fajãs are fertile and, historically, used in the cultivation of yams, maize and vegetables, although coffee, vineyards and tropical fruits were also grown. Here, several fajãs are scattered along the northern and southern coast, including the fajãs of Santo Cristo and Cubres, with their distinctive saltwater lagoons. One of the more original harvests happens at Fajã of Caldeira do Santo Cristo, where the lagoon supports cockles: this makes Santo Cristo a popular destination for the unique gastronomic cuisine in the Azores. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * Category:Coastal and oceanic landforms Category:Portuguese words and phrases ","title":"Fajã"},{"id":"1441022","text":"Divčibare (; ) is a town and mountain resort situated on the mountain Maljen (1104 m) in western Serbia, south-east of Valjevo, at the altitude of 980 metres above sea level.

The town lies north of Belfast and some south-west of Lydenburg. Dullstroom lies within the Highveld plateu that is found in South Africa, and is part of the reason that the climate is so different from the surrounding areas. Along with Underberg, it is one of South Africa's premier flyfishing destinations. The town features the highest railway station in South Africa at above sea level as well as at the foot of De Berg, the highest point in the province at . ==History== The area was occupied in the mid-19th century by the Southern Ndebele people under the rule of King Mabhoko (called Mapoch by white settlers). Like his son Nyabêla, Mabhoko used Mapoch's Caves as a hideout during conflict with troops of the South African Republic (ZAR). The most violent fighting took place from 1882 to 1883. The nearby Fort Mapoch and a statue of Nyabêla are major attractions in Dullstroom. Dullstroom was established as the work of a settlement company founded in 1883 by its namesake Dutchman Wolterus Dull, at the invitation of State President of the South African Republic Paul Kruger, to settle Dutch immigrants. Dull, a merchant from Amsterdam, chairman of a committee which rendered assistance to families who had suffered losses during the First Anglo-Boer War. The element stroom, ‘stream’, refers to the Crocodile River nearby. The company purchased the farms Groot Suikerboschkop and Elandslaagte as the nucleus of the fledgling settlement, including housing for the settlers on the former. The village was proclaimed a town by Kruger in Dull's honor in October 9, 1893. Settlers continued to immigrate from 1884 to 1887. By 1893, the population had reached 48 people in eight houses, served by three stables, ten cattle pens, and a small trading company and store. While many of the men joined the rebels in the Second Boer War, the women and children were held in the British concentration camp in Belfast. After the Battle of Bergendal, guerrilla fighting continued in the area for a while. During the war, the town was destroyed and most of the settlers returned to the Netherlands. Some of the residents returned to rebuild the town, however. In 1921, the first city council met. After fly fishing, originally a New England pastime, became popular with the wealthy residents of Johannesburg, properties with trout dams were purchased, which are still used today. ==Climate== Due to its high elevation (Dullstroom being the highest town in South Africa itself), Dullstroom has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen: Cwb). From October to April, the town sees a significant amount of rainfall (higher than nearby Johannesburg to the west), in contrast with winter, where precipitation lacks. Its relatively cool and temperate climate has made Dullstroom the only place in South Africa where beech and elm trees grow, which were originally planted by Dutch colonists. ==Culture== The Dullstroom \\"Hervormde Kerk\\", Afrikaans for 'Reformed Church' Inspired by the Bavarian Oktoberfest, the annual Ducktober Beer Fest is a beer, food and music festival held in Dullstroom and is the highest beer festival in Southern Africa, at 2100m above sea level. The festival is organised by Proudly Dullstroom and the inaugural event was hosted at The Duck & Trout in September 2017. The Dullstroom Winter Festival is held every July and brings the whole community together. It also attracts people from all over South Africa. Music by local South African artists is the main attraction. The festival also hosts a kid's zone for young visitors as well as food stalls, artist exhibits, and whisky pairings stands. The Dimitrov Art Gallery is run by the well established artist Branko Dimitrov who also does on site commissioned portrait paintings. The Robert Badenhorst Art Gallery sells South African art from paintings to sculptures. The Anvil Ale Brewery on the outskirts of town is a microbrewery that produces a Blonde Ale, a Pale Ale and a Baltic Porter. ==References== ==External links== *Dullstroom accommodation and info Category:Populated places in the Emakhazeni Local Municipality Category:Populated places established in 1893 ","title":"Dullstroom"},{"id":"1441034","text":"The Fuller's Griffin Brewery is an English brewery based in Chiswick, West London, founded in 1845 and having been a family-run regional brewery until January 2019, when the brewing division of Fuller, Smith & Turner PLC was sold to Japanese international beverage giant Asahi.

Akutan Peak, at , is the highest point on the caldera of the Akutan stratovolcano. Akutan contains a 2 km-wide caldera formed during a major explosive eruption about 1600 years ago. Recent eruptive activity has originated from a large cinder cone on the NE part of the caldera. It has been the source of frequent explosive eruptions with occasional lava effusion that blankets the caldera floor. A lava flow in 1978 traveled through a narrow breach in the north caldera rim to within 2 km of the coast. A small lake occupies part of the caldera floor. Two volcanic centers are located on the NW flank: Lava Peak is of Pleistocene age; and, a cinder cone lower on the flank which produced a lava flow in 1852 that extended the shoreline of the island and forms Lava Point. An older, mostly buried caldera seems to have formed in Pleistocene or Holocene time, while the current caldera formed in a VEI-5 eruption c. 340 AD. AVO has recorded 33 confirmed eruptions at Akutan, making it the volcano with the most eruptions in Alaska. The volcano erupted most recently in 1992, but there is still fumarolic activity at the base of Lava Point and there are hot springs North-East of the caldera.

At various times, the neighborhood was known as Jacksonville (c. 1830) and Lowville (c. 1850). Its present name was given to it by a local physician, Dr. John T. Harrison, and refers to the elm trees that could be found on the doctor's estate. The last exit on New York State Route 440 before the Bayonne Bridge is in Elm Park, which also contains one of two Catholic cemeteries on Staten Island named St. Mary's Cemetery; the other cemetery, located in Grasmere, is much larger than the Elm Park cemetery. This often causes confusion. In 2008 Senator Charles Schumer and other Staten Island representatives proposed a Park and Ride under the bridge, for users of bus service to Bayonne, New Jersey. Residents have been opposed to this move, yet local businesses, according to the Staten Island Advance, support it. ==Demographics== A residential street in the southern part of Elm Park. In the early 20th Century a large number of Polish-American families settled in Elm Park, and they still constitute a percentage of its population; many of these families are parishioners of St. Adalbert's Church, a Roman Catholic church located in the community, which later received some African-American and Hispanic arrivals, particularly in the westernmost blocks bordering Mariners Harbor. As of the 2010 census, the area was 43.2% Hispanic, 24.1% White, 23.1% Black, 7% Asian, and 2.6% Other This is using a definition of Census Tract 239, and Block Group 2 of Tract 223. ==Transportation== Elm Park was served by the Staten Island Railway's North Shore Branch at Elm Park, until it closed in 1953.

In the United Kingdom, a tied house is a public house required to buy at least some of its beer from a particular brewery or pub company. That is in contrast to a free house, which is able to choose the beers it stocks freely. A report for the UK government described the tied pub system as \\"one of the most inter‐woven industrial relationships you can identify in the UK, with multiple streams of payments running in both directions, from the pub tenant to the pubco and vice versa, generally negotiated on a pub‐by‐pub basis.\\" == Free and tied houses == The pub itself may be owned by the brewery or pub company in question, with the publican renting the pub from the brewery or pub company, termed a tenancy. Alternatively, the brewery may appoint a salaried manager while retaining ownership of the pub; that arrangement is a \\"managed house\\". Finally, a publican may finance the purchase of a pub with soft loans (usually a mortgage) from a brewer and be required to buy his beer from it in return. The traditional advantage of tied houses for breweries was the steadiness of demand they gave them; a tied house would not change its beer supplier suddenly so the brewer had a consistent market for its beer production. However, the arrangement was sometimes disadvantageous to consumers, such as when a regional brewer tied nearly every pub in an area so that it became very hard to drink anything but its beer. This was a form of monopoly opposed by the Campaign for Real Ale, especially when the brewer forced poor beer onto the market from the lack of competition from better breweries. Some or all drinks were then supplied by the brewery, including third party spirits and soft drinks, quite often at an uncompetitive price relative to those paid by free houses. From 1989 to 2003, some tied pubs in the UK were legally permitted to stock at least one guest beer from another brewery to give greater choice to drinkers. == Outside the United Kingdom == === Canada === In Canada, alcohol laws are the domain of the provinces. Tied houses were eventually banned in all provinces in the aftermath of the repeal of total alcohol prohibition. In the 1980s the concept of the Brew Pub or Microbrewery was introduced to Canada beginning in the Province of British Columbia. Through the 1980s and 1990s this concept expanded to other provinces but was not a return to fully tied houses in the traditional sense. Very few alcohol producers or distributors survived prohibition, creating a concentrated market ripe for abuses. For example, in British Columbia in 1952 there were “no licensed restaurants or private liquor stores and only about 600 bars and clubs” compared to “over 9000 licensed establishments, including 5,600 restaurants” in 2011. A proposal to loosen the restrictions was put forward by the government of BC in 2010, in response to these changes, but regulation to implement the law was still under debate in 2012. === United States === In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, saloons across America were often tied houses, with breweries having exclusive contracts with drinking establishments, including helping business start-ups. Competition was fierce among competing breweries' tied houses within cities. This system ended with the enactment of nationwide Prohibition in the United States in 1919. Although Prohibition was repealed in 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution grants the states broad power to regulate the alcoholic beverage industry. Tied-house restrictions have been construed as forbidding virtually any form of vertical integration in the alcoholic beverage industry. As the Supreme Court of California explained in a landmark 1971 decision: In recent years, several major alcoholic beverage makers have been successful in securing very specific exceptions to California's strict tied-house laws.Dispatches from the Wine Law Wars, speech by James Seff at Stanford University, 9/28/10. ==References== ==Further reading== Category:Pubs in the United Kingdom Category:Types of drinking establishment Category:Alcohol law in Canada ","title":"Tied house"},{"id":"1441082","text":"Sir Owen Seaman, Bt. Sir Owen Seaman, 1st Baronet (18 September 1861 – 2 February 1936) was a British writer, journalist and poet. He is best known as editor of Punch, from 1906 to 1932. ==Biography== Born in Shrewsbury, he was the only son of William Mantle Seaman and Sarah Ann Balls. He distinguished himself academically both at Shrewsbury School and later Clare College, Cambridge. Following this, he worked as a schoolmaster at Rossall School (1884) and Magdalen College School, Oxford (1887-8),A History of Magdalen College School Oxford, Second Edition, Blackwells, 1958, p. 168 professor of literature at Durham College of Science, Newcastle upon Tyne (1890–1903), and became a barrister of the Inner Temple in 1897. Seaman's first successful submission to the satirical and humorous magazine Punch was \\"Rhyme of the Kipperling\\", an 1894 parody of Rudyard Kipling. The same year he published a full volume of parodies entitled Horace at Cambridge. After several years of submitting work which showed \\"a remarkable gift for the composition of light verse,\\" he was invited to join the staff in 1897, becoming assistant editor in 1902 and finally editor in 1906.

The thickness of such a layer is several Debye lengths thick, a value whose size depends on various characteristics of plasma (e.g. temperature, density, etc.). A Debye sheath arises in a plasma because the electrons usually have a temperature on the order of magnitude or greater than that of the ions and are much lighter. Consequently, they are faster than the ions by at least a factor of \\\\sqrt{m_\\\\mathrm{i}/m_\\\\mathrm{e}}. At the interface to a material surface, therefore, the electrons will fly out of the plasma, charging the surface negative relative to the bulk plasma. Due to Debye shielding, the scale length of the transition region will be the Debye length \\\\lambda_\\\\mathrm{D}. As the potential increases, more and more electrons are reflected by the sheath potential. An equilibrium is finally reached when the potential difference is a few times the electron temperature. The Debye sheath is the transition from a plasma to a solid surface. Similar physics is involved between two plasma regions that have different characteristics; the transition between these regions is known as a double layer, and features one positive, and one negative layer. ==Description== Positive ion sheaths around grid wires in a thermionic gas tube, where ⊕ represents a positive charge (not to scale) (After Langmuir, 1929) Sheaths were first described by American physicist Irving Langmuir. In 1923 he wrote: :\\"Electrons are repelled from the negative electrode while positive ions are drawn towards it. Around each negative electrode there is thus a sheath of definite thickness containing only positive ions and neutral atoms. [..] Electrons are reflected from the outside surface of the sheath while all positive ions which reach the sheath are attracted to the electrode. [..] it follows directly that no change occurs in the positive ion current reaching the electrode. The electrode is in fact perfectly screened from the discharge by the positive ion sheath, and its potential cannot influence the phenomena occurring in the arc, nor the current flowing to the electrode.\\"Langmuir, Irving, \\"Positive Ion Currents from the Positive Column of Mercury Arcs\\" (1923) Science, Volume 58, Issue 1502, pp. 290-291 Langmuir and co-author Albert W. Hull further described a sheath formed in a thermionic valve: :\\"Figure 1 shows graphically the condition that exists in such a tube containing mercury vapor. The space between filament and plate is filled with a mixture of electrons and positive ions, in nearly equal numbers, to which has been given the name \\"plasma\\". A wire immersed in the plasma, at zero potential with respect to it, will absorb every ion and electron that strikes it. Since the electrons move about 600 times as fast as the ions, 600 times as many electrons will strike the wire as ions. If the wire is insulated it must assume such a negative potential that it receives equal numbers of electrons and ions, that is, such a potential that it repels all but 1 in 600 of the electrons headed for it.\\" :\\"Suppose that this wire, which we may take to be part of a grid, is made still more negative with a view to controlling the current through the tube. It will now repel all the electrons headed for it, but will receive all the positive ions that fly toward it. There will thus be a region around the wire which contains positive ions and no electrons, as shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1. The ions are accelerated as they approach the negative wire, and there will exist a potential gradient in this sheath, as we may call it, of positive ions, such that the potential is less and less negative as we recede from the wire, and at a certain distance is equal to the potential of the plasma. This distance we define as the boundary of the sheath. Beyond this distance there is no effect due to the potential of the wire.\\"Albert W. Hull and Irving Langmuir, \\"Control of an Arc Discharge by Means of a Grid\\", Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1929 March 15; 15(3): 218–225 ==Mathematical treatment== === The planar sheath equation === The quantitative physics of the Debye sheath is determined by four phenomena: Energy conservation of the ions: If we assume for simplicity cold ions of mass m_\\\\mathrm{i} entering the sheath with a velocity u_0, having charge opposite to the electron, conservation of energy in the sheath potential requires :\\\\frac{1}{2}m_\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\,u(x)^2 = \\\\frac{1}{2}m_\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\,u_0^2 - e\\\\,\\\\varphi(x), where e is the charge of the electron taken positively, i.e. e=1.602 x 10^{-19} \\\\mathrm{C}. Ion continuity: In the steady state, the ions do not build up anywhere, so the flux is everywhere the same: :n_0\\\\,u_0 = n_\\\\mathrm{i}(x)\\\\,u(x). Boltzmann relation for the electrons: Since most of the electrons are reflected, their density is given by :n_\\\\mathrm{e}(x) = n_0 \\\\exp\\\\Big(\\\\frac{e\\\\,\\\\varphi(x)}{k_\\\\mathrm{B}T_\\\\mathrm{e}}\\\\Big). Poisson's equation: The curvature of the electrostatic potential is related to the net charge density as follows: :\\\\frac{d^2\\\\varphi(x)}{dx^2} = \\\\frac{e (n_\\\\mathrm{e}(x)-n_\\\\mathrm{i}(x))}{\\\\epsilon_0} . Combining these equations and writing them in terms of the dimensionless potential, position, and ion speed, :\\\\chi(\\\\xi) = -\\\\frac{e\\\\varphi(\\\\xi)}{k_\\\\mathrm{B}T_\\\\mathrm{e}} :\\\\xi = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\lambda_\\\\mathrm{D}} :\\\\mathfrak{M} = \\\\frac{u_\\\\mathrm{o}}{(k_\\\\mathrm{B}T_\\\\mathrm{e}/m_\\\\mathrm{i})^{1/2}} we arrive at the sheath equation: :\\\\chi = \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{2\\\\chi}{\\\\mathfrak{M}^2} \\\\right)^{-1/2} - e^{-\\\\chi}. ===The Bohm sheath criterion=== The sheath equation can be integrated once by multiplying by \\\\chi': :\\\\int_0^\\\\xi \\\\chi' \\\\chi\\\\,d\\\\xi_1 = \\\\int_0^\\\\xi \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{2\\\\chi}{\\\\mathfrak{M}^2} \\\\right)^{-1/2} \\\\chi' \\\\,d\\\\xi_1 - \\\\int_0^\\\\xi e^{-\\\\chi} \\\\chi'\\\\,d\\\\xi_1 At the sheath edge (\\\\xi = 0), we can define the potential to be zero (\\\\chi = 0) and assume that the electric field is also zero (\\\\chi'=0). With these boundary conditions, the integrations yield :\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\chi'^2 = \\\\mathfrak{M}^2 \\\\left[ \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{2\\\\chi}{\\\\mathfrak{M}^2} \\\\right)^{1/2} - 1 \\\\right] + e^{-\\\\chi} - 1 This is easily rewritten as an integral in closed form, although one that can only be solved numerically. Nevertheless, an important piece of information can be derived analytically. Since the left-hand-side is a square, the right-hand-side must also be non-negative for every value of \\\\chi, in particular for small values. Looking at the Taylor expansion around \\\\chi = 0, we see that the first term that does not vanish is the quadratic one, so that we can require :\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\chi^2\\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathfrak{M}^2} + 1 \\\\right) \\\\ge 0, or :\\\\mathfrak{M}^2 \\\\ge 1, or :u_0 \\\\ge (k_\\\\mathrm{B}T_\\\\mathrm{e}/m_\\\\mathrm{i})^{1/2}. This inequality is known as the Bohm sheath criterion after its discoverer, David Bohm. If the ions are entering the sheath too slowly, the sheath potential will \\"eat\\" its way into the plasma to accelerate them. Ultimately a so-called pre-sheath will develop with a potential drop on the order of (k_\\\\mathrm{B}T_\\\\mathrm{e}/2e) and a scale determined by the physics of the ion source (often the same as the dimensions of the plasma). Normally the Bohm criterion will hold with equality, but there are some situations where the ions enter the sheath with supersonic speed. === The Child–Langmuir law === Although the sheath equation must generally be integrated numerically, we can find an approximate solution analytically by neglecting the e^{-\\\\chi} term. This amounts to neglecting the electron density in the sheath, or only analyzing that part of the sheath where there are no electrons. For a \\"floating\\" surface, i.e. one that draws no net current from the plasma, this is a useful if rough approximation. For a surface biased strongly negative so that it draws the ion saturation current, the approximation is very good. It is customary, although not strictly necessary, to further simplify the equation by assuming that 2\\\\chi/\\\\mathfrak{M}^2 is much larger than unity. Then the sheath equation takes on the simple form :\\\\chi = \\\\frac{\\\\mathfrak{M}}{(2\\\\chi)^{1/2}}. As before, we multiply by \\\\chi' and integrate to obtain :\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\chi'^2 = \\\\mathfrak{M} (2\\\\chi)^{1/2}, or :\\\\chi^{-1/4}\\\\chi' = 2^{3/4} \\\\mathfrak{M}^{1/2}. This is easily integrated over ξ to yield :\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{w}^{3/4} = 2^{3/4} \\\\mathfrak{M}^{1/2} d, where \\\\chi_\\\\mathrm{w} is the (normalized) potential at the wall (relative to the sheath edge), and d is the thickness of the sheath. Changing back to the variables u_0 and \\\\varphi and noting that the ion current into the wall is J=e\\\\,n_0\\\\,u_0, we have :J = \\\\frac{4}{9} \\\\left(\\\\frac{2e}{m_i}\\\\right)^{1/2} \\\\frac{\\\\varphi_w^{3/2}}{4\\\\pi d^2}. This equation is known as Child's law, after Clement D. Child (1868–1933), who first published it in 1911, or as the Child–Langmuir law, honoring as well Irving Langmuir, who discovered it independently and published in 1913. It was first used to give the space-charge-limited current in a vacuum diode with electrode spacing d. It can also be inverted to give the thickness of the Debye sheath as a function of the voltage drop by setting J=j_\\\\mathrm{ion}^\\\\mathrm{sat}: : d = \\\\frac{2}{3} \\\\left(\\\\frac{2e}{m_\\\\mathrm{i}}\\\\right)^{1/4} \\\\frac{\\\\varphi_\\\\mathrm{w}^{3/4}}{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi j_\\\\mathrm{ion}^\\\\mathrm{sat}}}. == See also == * Ambipolar diffusion * Double layer (plasma), especially the section Current-carrying double layers formed by single, zero temperature beams * List of plasma (physics) applications articles == Footnotes == <div style=\\"font-size: 95%;> Category:Plasma physics Category:Peter Debye ","title":"Debye sheath"},{"id":"1441114","text":"Ohrigstad (Afrikaans for Ohrig city), formerly Andries Orieg Stad, is a small town to the north of Lydenburg in the Limpopo province, South Africa. ==History== A fort was established by a group of Voortrekkers under the leadership of Andries Hendrik Potgieter with the help of a Dutch merchant Gregorius Ohrig.

The road, constructed as a sealed two-lane single carriageway, travels through remote and largely arid landscapes. Carnarvon is the only large settlement on the highway, and is an oasis within the harsh surrounding environment. The entire highway is allocated National Route 1, part of Australia's Highway 1, and parts of the highway are included in tourist routes Batavia Coast Tourist Way and Cossack Tourist Way. Economically, North West Coastal Highway is an important link to the Mid West, Gascoyne and Pilbara regions, supporting the agricultural, pastoral, fishing, and tourism industries, as well as mining and offshore oil and gas production. In Geraldton, the highway begins at a grade separated interchange with Brand Highway and roads providing access to the port and town centre. Two major roads link the North West Coastal Highway to the inland Great Northern Highway: Geraldton–Mount Magnet Road in Geraldton, and Nanutarra Munjina Road at Nanutarra, further north. Several roads link provide access to coastal towns and attractions, including Shark Bay Road, Onslow Road and Karratha Road. With few towns on the highway, roadhouses are the only settlements for long stretches. North West Coastal Highway ends at Great Northern Highway, out from Port Hedland. North West Coastal Highway was created in 1944 from existing roads and tracks through remote pastoral areas. However, it was a hazardous route that could be dusty in the dry season, and boggy or washed away in the wet season. Economic growth and development in northern Western Australia prompted initial improvement efforts in the late 1940s, and a sealed road was constructed from Geraldton to Carnarvon by 1962. The impact of cyclones and seasonal flooding resulted in a realignment inland of the Carnarvon to Port Hedland section, which was constructed and sealed between 1966 and 1973, and required thirty new bridges. Various upgrades have been carried out in sections across the length of the highway, including the Geraldton Southern Transport Corridor project which grade-separated the highway's junction with Brand Highway. ==Route description== North West Coastal Highway is the coastal route through Western Australia's remote north- west. From the Mid West city of Geraldton, the highway heads north to the small town of Northampton, and another to Carnarvon, the only large settlement along the route. It continues north-east for to Roebourne, beyond the turnoff to Karratha, and ends further east at Great Northern Highway, out from Port Hedland. Apart from Whim Creek, between Roebourne and Port Hedland, roadhouses serving the highway are the only settlements on the long stretches of rangeland expanses between these towns. The highway provides access to tourist destinations including Shark Bay, Coral Bay, and Exmouth. North West Coastal Highway supports the diversified economies of the Mid West and Gascoyne regions, including mining, agriculture, fishing and tourism, transitioning to primarily mining, pastoral stations and offshore oil and gas production in the Pilbara. The entire highway is allocated National Route 1, part of Australia's Highway 1, and parts of the highway are included in the tourist routes Batavia Coast Tourist Way (Tourist Drive 354) and Cossack Tourist Way (Tourist Drive 351). The vast majority of the highway is a two-lane single carriageway with a speed limit of , except in and around built up areas where it drops down to . Main Roads Western Australia monitors traffic volume across the state's road network, including various locations along North West Coastal Highway. In the 2012/13 financial year, the recorded traffic volumes ranged from 13,350 vehicles per day west of Geraldton–Mount Magnet Road down to 370 north of Minilya–Exmouth Road. The highest percentage of heavy vehicles was 45.5%, west of Karratha Road. Reports commissioned by the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia (RAC) in 2006 and 2008 gave most of the highway a four-star safety rating out of five, but with a significant proportion rated at a three-star level. The overall highway network was generally rated as three-star or four- star, with around 10% in 2006 and 5% in 2008 receiving a two-star rating. === Geraldton to Carnarvon === View south along North West Coastal Highway, about south of the Wooramel Roadhouse North West Coastal Highway commences at a diamond interchange at the northern end of Brand Highway. It heads east from the interchange and curves round to the north, past a traffic-light intersection with Geraldton–Mount Magnet Road. The highway continues north through Geraldton's outer suburbs for before the landscape transitions to scrubland. Between Geraldton and Carnarvon, the highway passes through remote and dry semi-desert areas. Apart from Northampton, out from Geraldton, the only settlements over this stretch are four roadhouses. Binnu Roadhouse is south of Kalbarri Road, the turnoff to Kalbarri; Billabong Roadhouse is south of the Shark Bay turnoff, where the Overlander Roadhouse is located; and the Wooramel Roadhouse is near the Wooramel River crossing. Carnarvon, at the mouth of the Gascoyne River, is the only large town between Geraldton and Karratha, and is an oasis within an arid region. East of the town, the landscape near the river features banana and other horticultural plantations, while the vegetation in the surrounding region is primarily shrublands. The highway skirts east of Carnarvon, and crosses the Gascoyne River north-east of Robinson Street, the main road into the town. === Carnarvon to Port Hedland === North of Carnarvon, the highway passes through desert and becomes very flat. Bridges span many ephemeral rivers and creeks, with strands of eucalyptus along their floodplains. The next roadhouse, beyond Carnarvon, is the Minilya Roadhouse adjacent to the Minilya River. further on is the turnoff to the North West Cape area, including Cape Range National Park, Coral Bay and Exmouth. Crossing the Ashburton River North West Coastal Highway reaches the Pilbara after , where it deviates further inland. The highway continues north- east for , crossing the Ashburton River close to Nanutarra Roadhouse. Nearby it intersects Nanutarra Munjina Road, an access road to the mining towns of Tom Price and Paraburdoo, and the ghost town of Wittenoom. Over the next , the road crosses the Robe River, near the turnoff to Pannawonica, the Fortescue River, adjacent to the Fortescue River Roadhouse, and Maitland River, before it reaches Karratha Roadhouse. The roadhouse is located at the turnoff to Karratha, the nearby town of Dampier, and the Burrup Peninsula. east, Roebourne is the gateway to Wickham, Point Samson, and the ghost town of Cossack. The highway continues east to the locality of Whim Creek, crosses the Yule River after a further , and finishes beyond at Great Northern Highway, south-west of Port Hedland and South Hedland. ==History== ===Origins=== Before the mid-1920s, travelling north from Geraldton necessitated going through Mullewa, Dairy Creek and Gascoyne Junction. In 1926, a direct route joining Geraldton and Carnarvon was constructed, shortening the trip by . At first, this was little more than a rough bush track, at least partly used for extracting sandalwood. As there was often little water along this route, tanks with catchment roofs were built at eight locations along the track. The tanks were named for their distance from Carnarvon, at 40, 55, 85, 110, 125, 150, 180, and 200 miles. These tanks provided a life-saving function but when the road was later sealed, they became less important and were gradually removed except for Number 8 tank. Number 8 tank is still used by travellers and marks a point from Geraldton, from Carnarvon. Western Australia's Nomenclature Advisory Committee proposed in October 1940 that a highway name be used to describe the main route from Midland to Geraldton, and extending to areas further north. The suggested name was Great Northern Highway, following on from the naming of the Great Eastern and Great Southern highways. By July 1941, the committee's proposal had expanded to three highway names for the roads in the state's northern areas: Great Northern Highway for the Midland Junction to Wyndham road, Geraldton Highway for Walebing–Mingenew–Geraldton route, and North West Coastal Highway for \\"the road from Geraldton to De Grey, via Northampton, Galena, Carnarvon, Boolaganoo, Winning Pool, Giralia, Yanrey, Onslow, Peedamullah, Mardie, Karratha, Roebourne, Whim Creek, Mundabullangana and Port Hedland\\". The proposal was well received by the local municipal councils and road boards. The flooded Gascoyne River in Carnarvon, 1942, with water rushing over the deck of the bridge. During such floods, roads could become bogs or be completely washed away. The name North West Coastal Highway was gazetted on 21 April 1944, under section 10 of the Land Act, 1933–1939. However, the highway was mostly a series of tracks through remote pastoral areas, with the sealed road ending just past Northampton, approximately north of Geraldton. Driving was difficult and hazardous all year round. The road was very dusty in the dry season, and some sections of the road were effectively impassable sand, while other sections contained limestone outcrops that damaged tyres. During the wet season, when rivers flooded, sections of road were essentially bogs, or worse still, were completely washed away. Economic growth and development in Western Australia's northern regions in the 1940s prompted the state to quadruple road funding between 1946 and 1952. Two \\"gangs\\" of workers were allocated to a length of North West Coastal Highway. Given the vast distance the highway travelled, and destructive cyclones in the Pilbara and Gascoyne that could destroy multiple weeks worth of work, the overall improvement was relatively insignificant. Over time, though, the road was improved. ===Sealing=== In the late 1950s a significant project was undertaken to seal the highway between Geraldton and Carnarvon. The sealed road had progressed northwards in the preceding years, but only by approximately each year. The rate of work increased rapidly, and by 1960, a stretch extending south from Carnarvon had been sealed. By the middle of that year, the sealing reached beyond Geraldton and came south of Carnarvon, with a gap. The project was completed in 1962 when the two sections converged at the 455-mile peg, and was officially opened on 1 September. Completion of the sealed road resulted in increased tourist traffic, and a longer tourist season. A large cyclone swept through the Carnarvon area in February 1961, causing much devastation to the road network. Many floodways were completely washed away, and North West Coastal Highway was immersed in flood water for either side of Onslow. Carnarvon was cut off from general traffic for two weeks, and the damage to the roads in the region took months to repair. Approval was given to realign the road further inland, where it would be less susceptible to flooding. By the 1960s North West Coastal Highway had become a crucial connection for development in the Pilbara – including the pastoral industry, tourism, and the emergence of iron ore mining. In 1966 the traffic volume was up to 125 vehicles per day, and the unsealed road needed constant maintenance to cope with this demand. There were also frequent delays due to flooding. In 1966 the state government announced that the sealed road would be extended to Port Hedland, over a nine-year period. Substantial portions of the highway would also be relocated above the flood plain. The new alignment on higher ground would be shorter, and would make bridging rivers easier. Work started at Carnarvon, and had been completed by 1969. Locally available material was used to great extent during construction, with techniques adjusted based on what was available; however, some resources were transported across vast distances. Water, scarce in the dry climate of the North West, was conveyed up to , aggregate up to , and bitumen up to . The project required thirty bridges, over riverbeds that could be dry all year, but might receive as much as of rainfall in three months, as had been the case at Onslow in 1961. The bridges were designed to withstand twenty-year floods, but more severe possibilities were anticipated – the approaches were built lower than the bridge decks, so that excess water would flow around the bridges, rather than over them. The sealing of North West Coastal Highway was nearing completion in 1973; additional resources provided to complete the work resulted in the final section, Port Hedland to Roebourne, being finished in only five months. An official opening ceremony was held at South Hedland on 6 December 1974, with the road pronounced open by Premier Charles Court. The final cost of the project was approximately $31 million, substantially more than the initial estimate of $17 million. This was mainly due to two factors: increased construction standards, and inflation, which rose from 4% to 13% between 1970 and 1974. ===Further improvements=== In the 1980s the highway's flood resistance was improved with the construction of new, higher-level bridges to replace lower crossings. Galena Bridge over the Murchison River opened on 9 December 1983, and a new bridge over the Harding River near Roebourne was opened on 22 March 1985. In the late 1980s the various sections of road across Western Australia's road network were upgraded or reconstructed, with the worst segments prioritised. In August 1988, work on upgrading of North West Coastal Highway was completed, the final section between Geraldton and Carnarvon to have been brought up to standard. In the following two years, segments with a combined length of were resealed, and was widened from , with a sealed shoulder on each side. Maitland River bridge following Cyclone Monty, 2004The northernmost section of the highway, from Great Northern Highway to Port Hedland, was made part of Great Northern Highway in early 1996. Over a ten-year period from 1996 to 2006, numerous improvements were made to the highway, with sections widened, reconstructed, and realigned. Intersections and stretches through townsites were also redesigned, existing bridges were strengthened, and new bridges replaced older bridges or floodways. Additional work was necessary to repair damage from natural events. Sections washed away by floods in January 2003 were rebuilt, and opened in October of that year, and repairs to the damage from Cyclone Monty in March 2004 were completed that November. The biggest individual project in this period, across all of rural Western Australia, was Stage 1 of the Geraldton Southern Transport Corridor. The project, constructed between March 2004 and December 2005 at a cost of $92.5 million, involved the relocation of railway tracks, worth of road works, and grade separation of roads. North West Coastal Highway's southern terminus at Brand Highway was upgraded from a roundabout to an interchange, and an overpass was built for Durlacher Street to cross North West Coastal Highway. The highway was also made into a dual carriageway in the vicinity of the interchange. Stage 2 of the project, constructed between December 2008 and December 2009, provided a single carriageway connection from a traffic light-controlled intersection on the highway to Geraldton–Mount Magnet Road, with access to Geraldton Airport. In 2013 work began on a project to seal the highway's shoulders from Yannarie River at Barradale to the Onslow turn-off; it is expected to be completed by mid-2015. Further work to widen the highway between Minilya and Barradale, including replacing two floodways with bridges, is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * Highways in Australia * List of highways in Western Australia ==Notes== ===Coordinates=== ==References== ==External links== Category:Highways in rural Western Australia Category:Pilbara Category:Highway 1 (Australia) ","title":"North West Coastal Highway"},{"id":"1441121","text":"Edward Lloyd IV (December 15, 1744 – July 8, 1796) was an American planter from Talbot County, Maryland.

The conservation park encompasses of coastline, which include views across Backstairs Passage to Kangaroo Island. The conservation park consists of mainly rolling coastal hills, the gullies of which contain orchids and ferns, while the hilltops have stunted scrub and low windswept trees. Walking trails (including part of the famous Heysen Trail) provide access to most of the conservation park. It is classified as an IUCN class II protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate. == Notable walks == There are many walks in the conservation park, ranging from easy walks, through to moderate and hard hikes. Overnight treks are also possible by linking walks. ;Easy Walks * Stringybark Loop Walk: An easy 20-minute nature trail through stringybark and yacca-bush forest. Information boards are located at intervals along the way. * Forest Circuit Walk: An easy walk through the forest near Stringybark Campground. * Spring Wildflower Walk: A walk that follows fire trails from Stringybark Campground. ;Moderate Hikes * Deep Creek Waterfall from Tent Rock Road: Descends steeply to the Deep Creek Waterfall. The walk is not long and the track is well maintained with steps in steeper sections. The return walk is mostly uphill. * Deep Creek Cove from Trig Camping Area: Descends moderately to Deep Creek Cove. The return walk is a long moderate ascent. * Aaron Creek Circuit Hike: A circuit hike that crosses the open areas at the higher sections of the conservation park before descending toward Eagle Waterhole Campground. Plenty of Western grey kangaroos can be seen on this hike. ;Hard Hikes * Deep Creek Cove from Tapanappa Lookout: A spectacular and challenging hike that involves some steep hills and scrambling in some places. Hiking boots are required as there are steep and slippery sections in close proximity to cliff edges. * Blowhole Beach Hike: Descends to Blowhole Beach from Cobbler Hill. Can be incredibly windy. The track is not especially rough but the ascent on the return hike is long and steep. * Deep Creek Waterfall from Tapanappa Lookout: Another spectacular and challenging hike that has some long and steep undulations. This walk goes right into the dense Deep Creek vegetation and is not a leisurely stroll. * Aaron Creek Hike: Follows the creek to the coast, many creek crossings involved, and stunning views. ;The Heysen Trail * The Heysen Trail enters the conservation park near Blowhole Beach, not far from its starting point at Cape Jervis. It traverses the conservation park via Eagle Waterhole, Trig Campground, and Deep Creek Waterfall, and exits at Boat Harbour beach before continuing to Tunkalilla Beach. It is well marked with the red and white Heysen Trail track markers. == Camping == The conservation park has five camping areas available with various facilities. * Stringybark: A sheltered forest setting with 16 sites, hot showers, toilets and rain water.

Mondex was conceived by Tim Jones and Graham Higgins of the National Westminster Bank in the United Kingdom. The system was initially developed between 1990 and 1993, with internal trials being carried out by approximately 6,000 London-based NatWest staff from 1992. The system was publicly unveiled in December 1993. Initial public trials of the payment system were carried out from July 1995, by the newly incorporated Mondex International in Swindon, Wiltshire. The public phase had required the development and manufacture of numerous merchant devices and smart cards, with BT, NatWest and the Midland Bank sponsoring and installing retail terminals at the car parks, payphones, buses and 700 of the merchants in the town, and issuing Mondex cards to the residents. In 1992 Ron William then CEO of Europay International, previous responsible executive for the Mondex team at Natwest, brought the concept and technology Natwest had developed to the attention of the Europay International and MasterCard International Executives. 1997 Visa and MasterCard agreed to what was known at the West side Trial. Visa deployed Visa Cash their electronic purse and MasterCard deployed Mondex to see if the population in the designated regional on Manhattan Island would embrace the concept and the technology as a means of replacing cash. At the same time other Financial Institutions, Telecom operators and countries invested in and joined as owners of Mondex International. The system was subsequently sold to MasterCard International in 2001. MasterCard by then already owned 49% of the company. Mondex launched in a number of markets during the 1990s, expanding from the original trial in Swindon to Hong Kong, New York and Guelph, Canada. It was also trialled on several British university campuses from the late 1990s, including the University of Edinburgh, University of Exeter (between 1997 and 2001), University of York, University of Nottingham, Aston University and Sheffield Hallam University. Mondex's Canadian pilot ended after three years, in 1998, when partners backed out.

With an elevation of ,The topographic map shows an elevation of (1,800 m) its summit is the highest point on the island. Makushin is one of the most active among the 52 historically active volcanoes of Alaska. It has erupted at least two dozen times over the past several thousand years, with the last eruption occurring in 1995. ==Etymology== NASA satellite view of Unalaska Island. Makushin is the prominent white snowy area to the northwest In 1792, Sarichev called the volcano \\"Ognedyshushchaya Gora\\" meaning \\"fire- breathing mountain\\", i.e. volcano in Russian. In 1825, it was known as Makuschkin Volcano, possibly from the Russian word makushka, meaning \\"the top (of the head)\\". Its native name was Aigagin, a derivative of the word Aigak in the native tongue of the Aleuts. Makushin was also the native village here on the northern shore of the Makushin Bay where the foreman or bidarshik of the Russian American Company lived. There were six huts (yourts) where 35 natives lived. Alaska Volcano Observatory has identified \\"Ajagin Wesselow\\", \\"Makushin Volcano\\", \\"Ajagisch\\", \\"Makouchine\\", \\"Ognedieshutshai Gora\\", \\"Ayagsh\\", \\"Aiyagin\\", \\"Cheerful Mtn.\\", \\"Ayyagyh\\", \\"Ayagish\\", \\"Makuschkin Volcano\\", \\"Ognedyshushchaya Gora\\" and \\"Makishinskaia sopka\\" as alternate names for the Makushin Volcano. Specifically identified here are the four features namely, Red Cinder Dome, Pakushin cone, the Sugarloaf and the Point Kadin vents. ==History== ===Origins=== The history of the volcano has been identified with the early Pliocene age. However, the caldera of the volcano is dated to a comparatively recent history of 8000 years. The “Sugarloaf cone on the ENE flank, and a cluster of about a dozen explosion pits and cinder cones at Point Kadin on the WNW flank” is attributed to the Holocene age. According to the history recorded by the Alaska Volcano Observatory: “The first episode began in Pliocene or early Pleistocene time (the oldest known age of lavas is 0.93 Ma [Nye, 1990]) and produced extensive flows and subordinate pyroclastic deposits of basaltic and andesitic composition, which enlarged the island by several kilometers along the northwest coast. Radial dips of flows suggest that Makushin Volcano itself was the principal vent area. The older flows are extensively glaciated, which implies a minimum age of late Pleistocene. The summit of Makushin subsequently collapsed, forming a summit. Andesitic pyroclastic-flow and debris flow deposits occur in glaciated valleys on the north and south sides of the volcano indicating a Holocene age for the caldera-forming eruption.\\" ===Activity=== George Davidson in 1867 who conducted some important geographical and geological research into the volcano and the Makushin valley. Historically, Makushin is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands, erupting at least two dozen times over the past several thousands years, the last in 1995. Seventeen explosions or eruptions of the Makushin Volcano have been recorded since 1786, though the magnitude has been termed as “small-to-moderate”. These were recorded in the years 1768–69, 1790?, 1792?, 1802, 1818?, 1826–38?, 1844?, 1865, 1867?, 1883, 1907, 1912?, 1926, 1938, 1951, 1952?, 1980, 1987 and 1995. Makushin's pinnacle last erupted on January 30, 1995, which generated ash extending to an altitude of 2.5 km. In the 1987 eruption, which occurred on March 2, the plume rose to above the volcano. The 1980 eruption was comparatively of smaller magnitude emanating from a vent on the southern side about below the volcanic peak. Although the volcano has not erupted since 1995, studies conducted between July 1996 and August 2000 recorded some 176 minor earthquakes registering between 0.1 and 3.2 on the Richter Scale, occurring on average 2 to 3 times a month. The hypocenters of the earthquakes generally occur in two cluster areas, the first is the larger and more active, located about southeast of the summit of the volcano at depths ranging from and the second, about east of the summit under Unalaska Bay occurs at depths of . The volcano was climbed by English born American geographer George Davidson in 1867 who conducted some important geographical and geological research into the volcano area and the Makushin valley. ==Geography== Makushin Volcano in 1982 Mount Makushin is located on the northern Unalaska Island, which is situated to the west of the town of Dutch Harbor. The Unalaska Bay, which is wide, separates the Dutch Harbor and Unalaska towns. The volcano is truncated, with a width of , forming the triangular northwest extension of the Unalaska Island. The caldera, which crowns the volcano, has a width of ( is also mentioned in another reference). Compared with the other Aleutian strato-volcanoes in the region, which have steep profiles, the Makushin volcano is a contrast that exhibits a broad and dome like structure with an ice field coverage of . Fumaroles and hot springs in area form a roughly linear trend. About to the south of this volcano is the “composite Pakushin cone” that has multiple craters, which is 4000 years old eruption; pyroclastic flows and surges have been reported here. The southeast flank of the volcano has rock exposures, at elevation. The pyroclastic flows deposited by the eruptions forming the Caldera have engulfed valleys in the eastern, northeastern, northern, and western valleys of the valley with depths up to 100 m. The northeast border of the volcano is also filled with volcanic lava, which is called the “Lava Ramp” spreading to an area of . A subsidiary cone formed is the Pakushin Cone), on the south. In the east and southeast part of the volcano hot springs and fumaroles have been created, at the summit and in valleys. A valley of the same name stretches to the northeast of the volcano from Broad Bay in Captain's Bay and was identified as a glacial valley after a survey in 1873. The terrain surrounding the volcano is very rugged but most of the surface surrounding the volcano is vegetated. However, it is generally less pronounced in the area of pyroclastic flows and deposits. Areas of short and tall grass grow in the volcano area, ranging from less than 20 cm high to over 1 meter. John Muir, the Scottish-born American naturalist (1838–1914), in his book \\"The Cruise of the Corwin (1881)\\", has vividly described this volcano: Unalaska town The closest town to the Volcano is the Unalaska town which is located from Anchorage on the Aleutian Archipelago at the northern end of the Island. It is situated on a well protected bay. This was at the cross roads of shipping and trade during Russian occupation (1741–1867). Dutch Harbor another important harbor town across the Unalaska town was a major naval base during the World War II. Fishing and crabbing industries have been the mainstay of the economy of Unalaska island. ==Research studies== The high-temperature geothermal resources study of volcanoes in Alaska has covered the geothermal areas in the summit caldera peak and also on the southeastern and eastern flanks of the Makushin. It is recorded as a subduction-related volcanic arc in the middle of the great Aleutian chain. Energy resources from the geothermal reservoir beneath the volcano have been assessed in a study carried out by the Alaska Power Authority to meet the power demands of the town of Unalaska and the Dutch Harbor. The study has established that such an energy generation from the geothermal resources would be cheaper than the diesel power system existing on the island. ==See also== *List of mountain peaks of North America **List of mountain peaks of the United States ***List of mountain peaks of Alaska *List of Ultras of the United States *List of volcanoes in the United States ==References== ==Sources== * Global Volcanism Program * Volcanoes of the Alaska Peninsula and Aleutian Islands-Selected Photographs * Alaska Volcano Observatory *Volcanoes USGS ==External links== Category:Landforms of Aleutians West Census Area, Alaska Category:Stratovolcanoes of the United States Category:Active volcanoes Category:Mountains of Alaska Category:Volcanoes of Alaska Category:VEI-5 volcanoes Category:Aleutian Range Category:Unalaska Island Category:Calderas of Alaska Category:Mountains of Unorganized Borough, Alaska Category:Volcanoes of Unorganized Borough, Alaska Category:Subglacial volcanoes of Alaska Category:Subglacial calderas in Alaska ","title":"Makushin Volcano"},{"id":"1441150","text":"Raymond C.

It is headquartered in Rio de Janeiro. Oi's major subsidiaries include Telemar and Brasil Telecom. In 2013, Oi announced its merger with Portugal Telecom, the largest telecommunication company in Portugal, in order to strengthen the Brazilian firm and simplify its ownership structure. In June 2015 Portugal Telecom was acquired by Altice Group. On June 20, 2016, Oi filed for a 19 billion (65 billion) bankruptcy protection, the largest on record for Brazil. In March 2017, Oi had 63 million revenue generating units (UGRs), including 40 million for personal mobile service, 16.3 million for landline, 6.5 million for B2B (large corporations and microentrepreneurs). Nowadays, it has 2 million hotspots to Oi WIFI network around Brazil.https://www.oi.com.br/oi/sobre-a-oi/empresa/informacoes/perfil-oi In March 2019, Oi reported a fourth-quarter net loss of 3.359 billion reais ($858 million), widening 66 percent from its year-earlier loss. Total revenue fell 7.9 percent. ==Corporate governance== Oi's chief executive officer (as of January 2018) is Eurico Teles, who also serves as the company's chief financial officer and director of investor relations. ==History== Telemar logo, 1999–2007 Oi (then known as Telemar) was formed as Tele Norte Leste to merge sixteen state-owned incumbent local exchange carriers, during the privatization of Brazilian telecommunications system. Each carrier served a particular Brazilian state in the northern, northeastern and southeastern part of the country. In the break-up of Telebras in 1998 it was sold to a consortium led by the Brazilian construction firm Andrade Gutierrez (21.2%) and Inepar Holdings (20%) as well as other Brazilian corporate and individual investors. The consortium paid 3.434 billion reais. The states that formed the base of Telemar at its inception were Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte, Piauí, Ceará, Maranhão, Pará, Amazonas, Amapá and Roraima, corresponding to 65% of the Brazilian territory and 20 million households. Initially, Telemar was allowed to offer only local voice and data services and interstate long- distance voice services. Today, Telemar and its subsidiaries offer local, long-distance and international voice and data services, besides a growing mobile phone network. In April 2006, it was announced that Telemar would restructure itself, merging its three holding companies into a single company, that would have been named either Telemar Participações S.A. or Oi Participações S.A. However, those plans failed, since there was no consensus between Telemar shareholders. But on March 1, 2007, Telemar rebranded itself to \\"Oi\\",\\"Telemar announces rebranding to Oi\\" unifying all of its companies and services under the Oi umbrella. The company is still legally known as \\"Telemar Norte Leste S.A.\\", \\"Tele Norte Leste Participações S.A.\\" and \\"Telemar Participações S.A.\\". Oi owns the brands: * Oi Fixo (landline service, formerly Telefone Telemar) * Oi Móvel (mobile service, cornerstone of the Oi brand) * Oi Velox (ADSL, 3G formerly Velox) * Oi Internet (ISP) * 31 (long-distance and international calling) * Oi Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi access, at home or via hotspots) * Oi TV (DTH pay TV) * Oi Voip (Voice over IP) In 2010, Portugal Telecom acquired 22.4% of Oi shares. In February 2014, Oi announced it would raise $5.9 billion in a share offering as part of the firm's merger process with Portugal Telecom. ==Subsidiaries== ===Oi Móvel=== Oi launched its mobile network in 2002 in its license states. It was the first network using GSM in Brazil. Oi has the practice of not calling its phones \\"cell phones\\", but rather \\"Ois\\". In 2007, Oi started selling only unlocked handsets, focusing on SIM card and plan sales. In October 2007, Oi acquired a license to operate with GSM in São Paulo, where the network went live on October 24, 2008. In December 2007, Oi purchased licenses to operate a 3G network in its area, including São Paulo, but with the exception of the Franca area. That network is expected to go live in 2009. Also in December 2007, Oi announced its purchase of Amazônia Celular, which was a condition of the sale of its sister company, Telemig Celular, to Vivo. ===Oi Internet=== Oi Internet is an ISP that was launched in 2004. Oi Internet started services with a promotion that offered 31% off the dial-up connection costs on the subscriber's bill. However, Anatel, the Brazilian telecom regulator, did not allow this practice. Later, the ISP relaunched the promotion, offering 31% of the dial-up connection costs deposited in the subscriber's bank account or twice of that on a prepaid Oi phone. The Oi Internet dial-up dialer can send SMS messages to Oi phones. In early 2005, Oi Internet launched its broadband services, initially available only for Oi's Oi Velox DSL subscribers, but now also available for Brasil Telecom Turbo and Telefónica Speedy subscribers. ===Brasil Telecom purchase=== In 2008, Oi announced it would purchase Brasil Telecom, creating a major Brazilian telecommunications company, already nicknamed \\"Supertele\\" or \\"SuperOi\\". That takeover required changes in legislation, which at the time prohibited a fixed telephone company from purchasing another fixed telephone company in a different license area. That legislation has changed since, and Oi completed its purchase of Brasil Telecom on January 9, 2009. Rollout of the Oi brand in the Brasil Telecom area starts with prepaid mobile service on May 17, 2009. ==Criticism== Oi has been criticized and fined by Anatel due to not being able to meet quality goals in their mobile phone service;http://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2013/02/anatel-multa-oi- em-r-34-mi-por-descumprir-metas-de-qualidade.html they have also been criticized for poor customer service. ==Sponsorships== *Brazilian Olympic Committee *Sandro Dias *São Paulo Fashion Week (Spring/Summer 2009 edition) *Fashion Rio - Rio Fashion Week *2007 Pan American Games, held in Rio de Janeiro *Oi Casa Grande - teatro no Rio de Janeiro *Oi FM - online radio station *Oi Fashion Rocks Brasil 2009, 2010 *X Games Brasil *2014 FIFA World Cup BrazilBrazilian telecommunications company becomes first World Cup sponsor for Brazil 2014 ==Slogans== * 2002-2013: Simples assim.

St. Michael orphanage and Chapel on Arthur Kill Road, early 20th century Greenridge or Marshland is a name sometimes used to denote the western part of Eltingville, a neighborhood on Staten Island's South Shore. The area's earliest settlers were French Huguenots, who are also responsible for a nearby South Shore neighborhood being named Huguenot. The Dutch called it Kleine Kill, or Little Creek, and the British called it Fresh Kills, into which Richmond Creek, which forms its western boundary, empties. The area appears to have received its present name (sometimes spelled Green Ridge) about 1876. In 1921, a highly popular restaurant and amusement place resembling today's Chuck E. Cheese's opened at the northwest corner of Arthur Kill Road and Richmond Avenue. Known as Al Deppe's, it was forced out of business in the late 1960s when its property was condemned to make way for the proposed Richmond Parkway. However, due to intense opposition -- much of it from environmental activists -- the parkway section that would have passed over Deppe's location was never built. Only the section south and west of this point was constructed. It opened in the autumn of 1972, overlaying a pre-existing thoroughfare named Drumgoole Boulevard, in honor of the Roman Catholic priest John C. Drumgoole who founded an orphanage in Pleasant Plains. Greenridge has seen much development -- a great deal of it commercial -- in recent decades, including the construction of a public transit center, the Eltingville Transit Center, in the early 2000s.

These are interesting texts in that they seem to be contemporary with the tradition of Johannes Liechtenauer, but not directly influenced by it. Gladiatoria is thus one of very few glimpses into the characteristics of a potentially independent German martial tradition.Hils, Hans Peter. \\"Gladiatoria: Über drei Fechthandschriften aus der ersten Hälfte des 15. Jahrhunderts.\\" Codici Manuscripti 13. Verlag Brüder Hollinek, 1987. pp. 1-54. Print. The core of the Gladiatoria group is a series of devices of armored fencing following the typical progression of a judicial duel: beginning with spears and small shields called ecranches, moving to longswords, then employing daggers on foot and on the ground. (Traditional dueling would begin on horseback before going to foot combat, and the ecranche is designed for mounted fencing, but Gladiatoria skips that stage entirely.) The diverse manuscripts in the group generally describe other kinds of fighting as well, such as the sword and buckler of the Codex Guelf 78.2 August 2º or the longshield of the Ms. German Quarto 16, but these teachings lack some of the common elements of the core Gladiatoria complex and are not considered to be part of it. There are five known versions of the Gladiatoria treatise, found in the Ms. KK5013, the Ms. German Quarto 16 (the only version with a title page), the Ms. U860.F46 1450, the Codex Guelf 78.2 August 2º, and the Ms. CL23842. Hans-Peter Hils described a sixth lost manuscript identified as Ms. T in his 1987 edition of Gladiatoria, but this was later determined to be identical with the MS U860 F46 1450 (which Hils did not have access to). Aside from these five, there are a few other extant manuscripts that some scholars have ascribed to the group. These include the Cod.11093 and part C of the Codex Wallerstein. In each case, there are disqualifying factors that ultimately exclude them from the group. While the three oldest texts in the Gladiatoria complex present a fairly identical set of devices, the slightly later Wolfenbüttel version of the treatise contains significantly more material, primarily in the dagger section. The origin of this additional material is unknown, and the textless nature of that version makes it difficult to place these plays in any sort of context. However, their existence may signify that the archetype was much more extensive than any known copy. == Gallery == Here is a selection of images from the Ms. Germ. Quart. 16.

He began his architectural training under Göran Josua Adelcrantz (1668-1739). After receiving a state scholarship, he left Sweden for studies abroad in 1721, first going to Paris, where he spent four years as a student at the Royal French Academy of Architecture and the French Academy of Art. He later continued to Italy and was called back to Sweden while in Venice in 1727. In 1728, upon the death of Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, Hårleman was appointed court intendant and subsequently in 1741, after Tessin's son Carl Gustaf Tessin had been made a member of the privy council, his successor as court superintendent. He was elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1744, was created a baron in 1747 and appointed Master of Ceremonies of the Royal Orders in 1748. Hårleman completed the Royal Palace in Stockholm, begun by Nicodemus Tessin the younger after fire had destroyed the medieval castle, in 1697. He was particularly responsible for the interiors and employed a large number of qualified artisans for the work. The work on the interiors of the palace had a beneficial effect on the state of furniture-making and other crafts in Sweden and helped introduce the rococo style to the country. Hårleman restored Uppsala Cathedral and parts of Uppsala Castle, both of which had been severely damaged in the Uppsala city fire of 1702, with the ruins of the castle having also been used as a quarry for the palace project in Stockholm. On behalf of Uppsala University, he built the Consistory House (konsistoriehuset) and the conservatory building for the botanical garden of Linnaeus. ==Personal life== Hårlemanska malmgård at 88A Drottninggatan street in central Stockholm was the Hårleman family house. The property was owned in the late 1600s by Carl Hårleman's father Johan Harleman. The house was rebuilt and fitted with a new interior in 1748 by Carl Harleman in connection with his wedding. In 1748 he married socialite and lady-in-waiting Henrika Juliana von Liewen (1709-1779). Hårleman died in 1753 and was buried in the Klara Church in Stockholm. His last great work, made in the year of his death, was to design the new church in Landskrona, later named Sofia Albertina Church.Swedish Encyclopedia \\"Lilla Uppslagsboken\\" 1958, Förlagshuset Norden AB, Malmö, volume 6 of 10, article \\"Landskrona\\" (column 227), comment - article only states that he designed the new church in Landskrona, but it seems plausible that this must have been his last greater task. The old church was demolished in 1753, the same year as Hårleman died. ==Works== Among his other works are Fredrikshovs house, Stockholm (1731), the Orangery, Linnaean Garden, Uppsala (1744), the main tower of the Holmentornet industrial works, Norrköping (1750), the Sätuna manor near Uppsala (1752), the Stockholm Observatory (1753), Hörningsholm Castle (c. 1746) in Mörkö in the Södertälje Municipality, and the \\"King's Gate\\" (1748), Tureholm Castle (1740s) in Trosa Municipality, Åkerö manor house (1752–57) (completed by Carl Gustaf Tessin after Hårleman's death) in Södermanland, and the royal entrance to the Sveaborg island fortress off Helsinki, in Finland (then part of the Kingdom of Sweden), and which was featured on the Finnish 1000 FIM banknote issued in 1986. ==Gallery of works by Carl Hårleman== File:Fredrikshovs slott, södra huset.JPGFredrikshovs house, Stockholm (1731) File:Linnéträdgården 1.jpgOrangery, Linnaean Garden, Uppsala (1744) File:Holmentornet 2012.jpgHolmentornet tower, industrial works, Norrköping (1750) File:Sätuna säteri.jpgSätuna Manor near Uppsala (1740s?)

On the National Rail network it is measured from . ==Facilities== ===Railway station=== West Croydon (2008 image) with Southern branding The main entrance is on London Road, a short distance from the main shopping area. There are ticket barriers protecting the platforms. Trains run to London Victoria, , , and Sutton and from there to west Surrey and West Sussex. By December 2009 station remodelling and tracklaying were completed for the southern extension of the East London Line, of which West Croydon is a terminus. The space occupied by former bay platform 2, out of use since the Wimbledon service was withdrawn in 1997 and replaced by Tramlink in 2000, has been utilised to extend platform 3, the London-bound platform. Bay platform 1 has been retained. There is no Platform 2. In April 2012 a new entrance was constructed in Station Road, allowing direct access to the railway station from the adjacent bus and tram stops. ===Bus station and tram stop=== The tram and bus interchange at West Croydon. The white building in the distance is the original station entrance West Croydon Bus Station (this building has since been demolished) A Croydon tram in 2000 A short distance from the main entrance is Station Road, where West Croydon bus station and tram stop are located. The tram stop is next to, but was for a long time physically separate from, the rail platforms, until the construction of the new entrance. All Tramlink routes use West Croydon, which is a single platform stop on the unidirectional loop around central Croydon. The bus station is a hub for London Buses, with 25 bus routes terminating or passing through. A new bus station opened in 2016. ==History== A 1908 Railway Clearing House map of lines around the Brighton Main Line between South Croydon and Selhurst/Forest Hill, and surrounding lines From 1809 to 1836 the site was the terminal basin of the Croydon Canal. The canal was drained and became part of the route of the London & Croydon Railway, opening on 5 June 1839. In 1845 the L&C; inaugurated the atmospheric system of propulsion; it worked for about a year but was not successful. On 23 September 1846, a fire broke out in a lamp room, severely damaging the station and destroying thirteen carriages. Damage was estimated at £10,000. The station was originally named Croydon; in April 1851 it became West Croydon. The canal basin was served by a short private branch from the terminus of the Surrey Iron Railway (SIR) at Pitlake. From 1855 the station was the terminus of the West Croydon to Wimbledon Line, which followed much of the route of the SIR. This line closed on 31 May 1997, to be replaced by Tramlink. Platform 2, the terminal bay for the Wimbledon line, was trackless until 2008. Very little remains of this platform apart from a little section at the western end, as most of it was filled in to extend platform 3 to allow trains to stop closer to the stairs. In 1912 the composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875–1912), who was a resident of Croydon, collapsed whilst on the station. This was due to overwork and pneumonia. He died at home a few days later. During the 1930s the station saw major alterations and reconstruction. A new ticket office was built on London Road. The original station buildings, ticket office and entrance in Station Road were closed and are still standing, converted to a shop. ==Services== Trains are provided by Southern and London Overground.

It was the largest aquarium in the world until it was surpassed by the Georgia Aquarium in 2005. The aquarium has the theme of “Encounter the Okinawan Sea”. ==History== In 1975, the World's Exposition or World's Fair was held in Okinawa, Japan at the Ocean Expo Park. Afterward, the park began to lose tourism and it was believed that a new aquarium would help revive the area and celebrate Okinawa's marine tradition. The aquarium was designed by Yukifusa Kokuba and was opened on 1 November 2002. \\"Churaumi\\" was selected as the name of the aquarium by public vote amongst Japanese people. \\"Chura\\" means \\"beautiful\\" or \\"graceful\\" in the Okinawan language, and \\"umi\\" means \\"ocean\\" in Japanese. == Aquarium == Visitors at the Kuroshio Sea main tank Rays and sharks at the Churaumi Aquarium The public aquarium is a part of the Ocean Expo Park located in Motobu, Okinawa. The aquarium is made up of four floors, with tanks containing deep sea creatures, sharks, coral and tropical fish. The aquarium is set on 19,000 m2 of land, with a total of 77 tanks containing 10,000 m3 of water. Water for the saltwater exhibits is pumped into the aquarium from a source 350 m offshore, 24 hours a day. The main tank, called the Kuroshio Sea, is long, wide and deep. It holds of water and features an acrylic glass panel measuring with a thickness of , the largest such panel in the world when the aquarium was opened.The size of this panel was surpassed in 2008 when a larger panel was installed in the Dubai Mall Aquarium Whale sharks and manta rays are kept alongside many other fish species in the main tank. The world's first birth of a manta ray in captivity was at the aquarium in 2007 and involved the reef manta ray (this species and the giant oceanic manta ray were only recognized as separate species in 2009, meaning that all were listed as Manta birostris until then). As of July 2010, there have been a total of four reef manta rays born in the aquarium. Since 2018 they also keep giant oceanic manta ray. The first attempt of keeping whale sharks in an aquarium was initiated in 1980 by the Ocean Expo Park (the predecessor of Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium) and it remains one of the few aquariums that maintain the species. Most were obtained from incidental catches in coastal nets set by fishers (none after 2009), but two were strandings. Several of these were already weak from the capture/stranding and some were released, but initial survival rates were low. After the initial difficulties in maintaining the species had been resolved, some have survived long-term in captivity. The record for a whale shark in captivity is an individual that, as of 2017, has lived for more than 18 years in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium. Okinawa Churaumi is trying to breed whale sharks in captivity, which has never been achieved by an aquarium. Their oldest male reached sexual maturity around 2012 and began to show an interest in females in 2014. The current female on display (another is maintained offshow) is long and expected to reach sexual maturity when . The aquarium holds 80 species of coral. Their corals have spawned every year at the aquarium since 2001. In 2016 the aquarium attempted to house a great white shark but it died after just three days, leading to criticisms from animal rights groups. == Other activities == A traditional Okinawan house Close to the Aquarium there are two different dolphin shows in which viewers can touch them and watch them perform in a show. They are bottlenose dolphin and false killer whale. There is also a manatee exhibit featuring manatees presented to the aquarium by the Mexican government. There is also Emerald Beach which is accessible by the 200 yen tram. Ocean Expo Park which holds the aquarium also has a selection of other activities. A native Okinawan Museum, Oceanic Culture Museum, Tropical Dream Center, and a Tropical & Subtropical Arboretum to a historic village. ==References== == External links == * (English) * Ocean Park Homepage in English * Bus Timetable from Asahibashi Sta. to the Aquarium * Category:Aquaria in Japan Category:Tourist attractions in Okinawa Prefecture Category:2002 establishments in Japan Category:Buildings and structures in Okinawa Prefecture Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium"},{"id":"1441194","text":"Risk arbitrage, also known as merger arbitrage, is an investment strategy that speculates on the successful completion of mergers and acquisitions. An investor that employs this strategy is known as an arbitrageur. Risk arbitrage is a type of event-driven investing in that it attempts to exploit pricing inefficiencies caused by a corporate event. == Basics == === Mergers === In a merger one company, the acquirer, makes an offer to purchase the shares of another company, the target. As compensation, the target will receive cash at a specified price, the acquirer's stock at specified ratio, or a combination of the two. In a cash merger, the acquirer offers to purchase the shares of the target for a certain price in cash. The target's stock price will most likely increase when the acquirer makes the offer, but the stock price will remain below the offer value. In some cases, the target's stock price will increase to a level above the offer price. This would indicate that investors expect that a higher bid could be coming for the target, either from the acquirer or from a third party. To initiate a position, the arbitrageur will buy the target's stock. The arbitrageur makes a profit when the target's stock price approaches the offer price, which will occur when the likelihood of deal consummation increases. The target's stock price will be equal to the offer price upon deal completion. In a stock merger, the acquirer offers to purchase the target by exchanging its own stock for the target's stock at a specified ratio. To initiate a position, the arbitrageur will buy the target's stock and short sell the acquirer's stock. This process is called \\"setting a spread\\". The size of the spread positively correlates to the perceived risk that the deal will not be consummated at its original terms. The arbitrageur makes a profit when the spread narrows, which occurs when deal consummation appears more likely. Upon deal completion, the target's stock will be converted into stock of the acquirer based on the exchange ratio determined by the merger agreement. At this point in time, the spread will close. The arbitrageur delivers the converted stock into his short position to close his position. === Predictors of merger success === Baker and Savasoglu contend that the best single predictor of merger success is hostility: only 38% of hostile deals were successfully consummated, while so-called friendly deals boasted a success rate of 82%. Cornelli and Li contend that arbitrageurs are actually the most important element in determining the success of a merger. Since arbitrageurs have made significant financial bets that the merger will go through, it is expected that they will push for consummation. For this very reason, the probability that the merger will consummate increases as arbitrageur control increases. In their study, Cornelli and Li found that the arbitrage industry would hold as much as 30%-40% of a target's stock during the merger process. This represents a significant portion of the shares required to vote yes to deal consummation in most mergers. Thus, takeovers in which arbitrageurs bought shares had an actual success rate higher than the average probability of success implied by market prices. As a result, they can generate substantial positive returns on their portfolio positions. === Active vs. passive risk arbitrage=== The arbitrageur can generate returns either actively or passively. Active arbitrageurs purchase enough stock in the target to control the outcome of the merger. These activist investors initiate sales processes or hold back support from ongoing mergers in attempts to solicit a higher bid. On the other end of the spectrum, passive arbitrageurs do not influence the outcome of the merger. One set of passive arbitrageurs invests in deals that the market expects to succeed and increases holdings if the probability of success improves. The other set of passive arbitrageurs is more involved, but passive nonetheless: these arbitrageurs are more selective with their investments, meticulously testing assumptions on the risk-reward profile of individual deals. This set of arbitrageurs will invest in deals in which they conclude that the probability of success is greater than what the spread implies. Passive arbitrageurs have more freedom in very liquid stocks: the more liquid the target stock, the better risk arbitrageurs can hide their trade. In this case, using the assumption that a higher arbitrageur presence increases the probability of consummation, the share price will not fully reflect the increased probability of success and the risk arbitrageur can buy shares and make a profit. The arbitrageur must decide whether an active role or a passive role in the merger is the more attractive option in a given situation. == Risk-return profile == The risk-return profile in risk arbitrage is relatively asymmetric. There is typically a far greater downside if the deal breaks than there is upside if the deal is completed. === Deal-level risks === Risk \\"arbitrage\\" is not risk-free. Its profits materialize if the spread, which exists as a result of the risk that the merger will not be consummated at its original terms, eventually narrows. Risk arises from the possibility of deals failing to go through or not being consummated within the timeframe originally indicated. The risk arbitrageur must be aware of the risks that threaten both the original terms and the ultimate consummation of the deal. These risks include price cuts, deal extension risk and deal termination. A price cut would lower the offer value of the target's shares, and the arbitrageur could end up with a net loss even if the merger is consummated. An unexpected extension to the deal completion timeframe lowers the expected annualized return which in turn causes a decline in the stock to compensate assuming the probability of the deal completing remains constant. However, the majority of mergers and acquisitions are not revised. Therefore, the arbitrageur need only concern himself with the question of whether the deal will be consummated according to its original terms or terminated. Deal termination can occur for many reasons. These reasons may include either party's inability to satisfy conditions of the merger, a failure to obtain the requisite shareholder approval, failure to receive antitrust and other regulatory clearances, or some other event which may change the target's or the acquirer's willingness to consummate the transaction. Such possibilities put the risk in the term risk arbitrage. Additional complications can arise on a deal-by-deal basis. An example includes collars. A collar occurs in a stock- for-stock merger, where the exchange ratio is not constant but changes with the price of the acquirer. Arbitrageurs use options-based models to value deals with collars. The exchange ratio is commonly determined by taking the average of the acquirer's closing price over a period of time (typically 10 trading days prior to close), during which time the arbitrageur would actively hedge his position in order to ensure the correct hedge ratio. A 2010 study of 2,182 mergers between 1990 and 2007 experienced a break rate of 8.0%. A study conducted by Baker and Savasoglu, which replicated a diversified risk arbitrage portfolio containing 1,901 mergers between 1981 and 1996, experienced a break rate of 22.7%. === Market risk === Several authors find that the returns to risk arbitrage are somewhat uncorrelated to the returns of the stock market in typical market environments. However, risk arbitrage is not necessarily insensitive to the performance of the stock market in all market conditions. When the stock market experiences a decrease of 4% or more, the beta (finance) between merger arbitrage returns and risk arbitrage returns can increase to 0.5. This suggests that the exposure to market risk is asymmetric: the arbitrageur does not participate in market rallies, but tends to suffer losses in downturns. === Returns === In the long run, risk arbitrage appears to generate positive returns. Baker and Savasoglu replicated a diversified risk arbitrage portfolio containing 1,901 mergers between 1981 and 1996; the portfolio generated excess annualized returns of 9.6%. Maheswaran and Yeoh examined the risk-adjusted profitability of merger arbitrage in Australia using a sample of 193 bids from January 1991 to April 2000; the portfolio returned 0.84% to 1.20% per month. Mitchell and Pulvino used a sample of 4,750 offers between 1963 and 1998 to characterize the risk and return in risk arbitrage; the portfolio generated annualized returns of 6.2%. The arbitrageur can face significant losses when a deal does not go through. Individual deal spreads can widen to more than fifty percent in broken deals. The HFRI Merger Arbitrage Index posted a maximum one-month loss of -6.5% but a maximum one-month gain of only 2.9% from 1990 to 2005. Merger arbitrage is significantly constrained by transaction costs. Arbitrageurs could generate abnormally high returns using this strategy, but the frequency and high cost of trades negate much of the profits. == Example == Suppose Company A is trading at $40 a share. Then Company X announces a plan to buy Company A, in which case holders of Company A's stock get $80 in cash. Then Company A's stock jumps to $70. It does not go to $80 since there is some chance the deal will not go through. In this case, the arbitrageur can purchase shares of Company A's stock for $70. He will gain $10 if the deal is completed and lose $30 if the deal is terminated (assuming the stock returns to its original $40 in a break, which may not occur). According to the market, the probability that the deal is consummated at its original terms is 75% and the probability that the deal will be terminated is 25%. The arbitrageur has three choices: # Purchase Company A's stock at $70. They would do this if he believes the probability that the deal will close is higher than or in-line with the odds offered by the market. # Short sell Company A's stock at $70. They would do this if he believes the probability that the deal will be terminated is higher than the odds offered by the market. If the arbitrageur believes the probability the deal will be occur is greater than 50% (that is, they believe the acquisition will still occur) but less than the probability assigned by the market (say, 60% in this example), they must also assume that the market will assign a probability of deal occurrence closer to their belief at some point before the close of the acquisition. # Do not get involved in the deal at this point in time. ==References== == External links == * Risk Arbitrage - Risk Encyclopedia Category:Arbitrage Category:Financial markets Category:Hedge funds ","title":"Risk arbitrage"},{"id":"1441200","text":"British racing green, or BRG, is a colour similar to Brunswick green, hunter green, forest green or moss green (RAL 6005). It takes its name from the green international motor racing colour of the United Kingdom. This originated with the 1903 Gordon Bennett Cup, held in Ireland (then still part of the UK), as motor-racing was illegal in England. As a mark of respect, the British cars were painted shamrock green. Although there is still some debate as to an exact hue for BRG, currently the term is used to denote a spectrum of deep, rich greens. \\"British racing green\\" in motorsport terms meant only the colour green in general – its application to a specific shade has developed outside the sport. ==Origins of the association== 1928 Bentley 4½ Litre. The lighter colour is painted metalwork, the darker a fabric body In the days of the Gordon Bennett Cup, Count Eliot Zborowski, father of inter-war racing legend Louis Zborowski, suggested that each national entrant be allotted a different colour. Every component of a car had to be produced in the competing country, as well as the driver being of that nationality. The races were hosted in the country of the previous year's winner. When Britain first competed in 1902, they had to choose a different colour from the national flag colours of red, white and blue, because those had already been taken for the 1900 race by America, Germany and France respectively. When Selwyn Edge won the 1902 Gordon Bennett Cup race for England in his Napier it was decided that the 1903 race would be held in Ireland, at that time a part of the United Kingdom, as motor racing at the time was illegal in Great Britain. As a mark of respect for their Irish hosts the English Napier cars were painted shamrock green. In keeping with these Irish/Napier roots, many of the earliest greens used on British racing cars were of a lighter olive, moss or emerald green. Later, darker shades became more common, though there was a return to lighter greens by HWM and other teams in the 1950s. Initially the colour use only applied to the grandes épreuves, but was later codified in the Code Sportif International (CSI) of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) for use in all international-level motor racing events. ==International rise to prominence== 1954 Jaguar D-type The foremost British participant in International Motor Racing at the highest echelons both before and after the Great War was Sunbeam (from 1920 part of the STD Motors Combine). Green liveried Sunbeam Racing Cars won the 1912 Coupe de l’Auto as well as being the first (and last for several decades) British team to win the European Grand Epreuves Grand Prix in both 1923 and 1924. The Green Sunbeams driven by the likes of Henry Segrave and K L Guinness were during the vintage period, the prominent competitors to watch for. In the 1920s Bentley cars were hugely successful at the Le Mans 24h races, all sporting a mid- to dark-green. The first recorded use of the darkest green shades was on the Bugatti of Briton William Grover-Williams, driving in the very first Monaco Grand Prix, in 1929. This colour has become known as British Racing Green. In the 1950s and 1960s British teams such as Aston Martin, Vanwall, Cooper, Lotus, and BRM were successful in Formula One and Sports car racing, all in different shades of green. The British Racing Partnership team used a very pale green. Scottish teams such as Ecurie Ecosse and Rob Walker Racing used a dark blue, which did not strictly conform to the CSI rules but was tolerated by officials. The Australian-owned but British- based and licensed Brabham team also used a shade of BRG, and this was augmented with a gold (later yellow) stripe, gold and green being the national sporting colours of Australia. Another British-based and licensed team, McLaren, made their debut at the 1966 Monaco Grand Prix with the McLaren M2B car painted white with a green stripe, to represent a fictional Yamura team in the John Frankenheimer´s film Grand Prix. Under pressure from a number of teams, most famously the Lotus team who wished to use the Gold Leaf livery on the Lotus 49, in sponsorship regulations were relaxed in F1. Subsequently, Lotus made their debut in this new livery at the 1968 Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the first works team to paint their cars in the livery of their sponsors.Team Gunston as a privateer team became the first Formula One team to paint their cars in the livery of their sponsors when they entered a private Brabham at the 1968 South African Grand Prix. In the FIA formally gave Formula One an exemption from the national colours ruling and the previously common green colour soon disappeared, being replaced by various sponsor liveries. This exemption has since been extended to all race series, unless specific regulations require the adoption of national colours. ==Modern usage== X-type Jaguar in metallic British Racing Green An Aston Martin DBR9, showing a modern metallic interpretation of a lighter shade of British Racing Green. The history of the famous greens was revived in 2000 by Jaguar Racing in Formula One, but after this team was sold to Red Bull by Ford in 2004, the new Red Bull Racing team used their own colours. Other traditionally British manufacturers have since followed suit. Bentley returned briefly to the Le Mans circuit in 2001, 2002 and 2003, winning with the Bentley Speed 8, painted in a very dark shade of BRG. In recent years Aston Martin has also returned to endurance racing, with their DBR9s painted in, a typically Aston, light BRG. Rocketsports Racing also used green for its Jaguar XK in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and American Le Mans Series and other. In 2010 the Lotus name returned to Formula One after a gap of 16 years with the Lotus Racing team's Lotus T127 car liveried in dark green with yellow. Although registered in Malaysia, the new team is based in Britain and chose BRG with the aim of \\"striking an emotional chord with young and old alike and evoking memories of some of motor racing most iconic moments\\". With the many successes of British racing teams through the years, British Racing Green became a popular paint choice for British sports and luxury cars. Originally a solid colour, British Racing Green is increasingly a metallic paint due to the limited range of solids offered by today's manufacturers. Paying tribute to the small British roadsters of the 1960s that inspired the Mazda MX-5 (such as the Triumph Spitfire, Austin-Healey Sprite, MG MGB and the Lotus Elan), Mazda produced a limited edition version of the model in 1991 and 2001 called the \\"British Racing Edition\\", which included green paint.http://www.edmunds.com/mazda/mx-5-miata/history.html Similarly, the modern BMW-owned Mini Hatchback marque, which is assembled at their Oxford, Birmingham and Swindon factories, includes a BRG colour option. Originally a somewhat murky dark olive, this was updated to a fresher shade of metallic green in the 2011 version. ==Historic paint mixing formulas== Imperial Chemical Industries, Belco Car Finishes, Colour Mixing Book 1953, as used on Jowett Cars 1948-1953 * British Racing Green, Code 284-8120: Light Brunswick Green 71%, Middle Brunswick Green 19%, White 7%, Black 3%. * Connaught Green, Code 284 - 97: Deep Brunswick Green 40%, Light Brunswick green 32%, Black 28%, Yellow Oxide Trace%. ==See also== * List of international auto racing colours * National colours of the United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== *1960 Road & Track article *1903 Leinster Leader article Category:Shades of green Category:Motorsport in the United Kingdom ","title":"British racing green"},{"id":"1441206","text":"is a Japanese gravure idol from Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan.

This village, in Kasi district of Laos, was the site of the first SSR program in Laos. It was set up by Big Brother Mouse, which publishes and distributes books to promote reading and literacy, with an emphasis on easy and fun books that children are eager to read.Sustained silent reading (SSR) is a form of school-based recreational reading, or free voluntary reading, where students read silently in a designated time period every day in school. An underlying assumption of SSR is that students learn to read by reading constantly. Successful models of SSR typically allow students to select their own books and require neither testing for comprehension nor book reports. Schools have implemented SSR under a variety of names, such as \\"Drop Everything and Read (DEAR)\\", \\"Free Uninterrupted Reading (FUR)\\", or \\"Uninterrupted sustained silent reading (USSR)\\". ==Value of Sustained silent reading== ===Advocates' perspective=== According to advocates such as educational researcher Stephen Krashen, SSR has been shown to lead to gains in several literacy domains. Krashen looked at a large number of studies to see what conclusions were supported by empirical evidence. He found that with respect to reading comprehension, SSR is successful; 51 of 54 studies found that students in an SSR program scored as well as, or better than, other students in this regard. It is most successful when used for longer periods of time.Krashen, S. 2007. \\"Extensive reading in English as a foreign language by adolescents and young adults: A meta-analysis.\\" International Journal of Foreign Language Teaching 3(2): 23-29. Furthermore, SSR was shown to create a reading habit. Several years after participating in a program, students reported more reading.Greaney, V., and M. Clarke. 1973. \\"A longitudinal study of the effects of two reading methods on leisure-time reading habits.\\" In Reading: What of the future? ed. D. Moyle. London: United Kingdom Reading Association, pp. 107-14, cited in Free Voluntary Reading by Stephen Krashen. One study found that a single SSR session was enough to change attitudes about reading. Long-term effects of SSR include better vocabularies, better writing skills, better spelling, and greater knowledge of literature, science, and \\"practical knowledge.\\"Krashen, Stephen D., 2011. Free Voluntary Reading. Santa Barbara: Libraries Unlimited, chapter 1. Several studies noted that children in poor neighborhoods had less access to books at home and in libraries, and often the books available to them were not books that they wanted to read.Worthy, J., M. Moorman, and M. Turner. 1999. What Johnny likes to read is hard to find in school. Reading Research Quarterly 34(10): 12-27. Prize- winning books were often not especially popular with children. Comic books, on the other hand, are often not available in libraries, but are popular with many boys, and reading comics was found to increase reading of other books.Ujiie, J., and S. Krashen. 1996. Is comic book reading harmful? Comic book reading, school achievement, and pleasure reading among seventh graders. California School Library Association Journal 19(2): 27-28. Three studies showed that providing rewards for reading did not improve reading development. Krashen believes this is because the presence of a reward suggests that an activity is work, and makes it less appealing.Krashen, Stephen D., 2011. Free Voluntary Reading. Santa Barbara: Libraries Unlimited, chapter 1. In two studies, teachers noted fewer discipline problems when an SSR program was being used.Krashen, Stephen D., 2011. Free Voluntary Reading. Santa Barbara: Libraries Unlimited, chapter 1. Advocates also point out that students in SSR programs have more positive attitudes toward reading than students who do not participate in SSR programs. ===National Reading Panel analysis of sustained silent reading studies=== The National Reading Panel (NRP) in the United States meta-analyzed all quasi-experimental and experimental studies of SSR and challenged the claim that SSR has positive effects. The panel stated that the literature contained insufficient numbers of quasi-experimental or experimental studies on SSR to validate its use as a sound educational practice. The panel also noted that the absence of quantitative evidence was not evidence against the practice in itself. They recommended further study of SSR. Jim Trelease, educator and author of The Read-Aloud Handbook, is one of many reading advocates who has disputed the impartiality of these findings. He points out that the NRP included only 14 research tests in their summary, out of 54 studies he identified that might have been used. In 10 of the studies used by NRP, SSR students performed the same as other students, and in 4 studies, SSR students did better.Trelease, Jim, The Read-Aloud Handbook Penguin Books, 2006. E-book version, no page reference available. However, some argue the NRP is not impartial at all. In fact, the NRP only included studies that were verifiable and with scientifically credible designs. The NRP had rigorous guidelines for the studies it would include. For example, the NRP did not include studies without control groups. The fact that the NRP only analyzed 14 SSR studies, shows that the other studies were not scientifically credible. In the full group of 54 studies, SSR students performed better in 25, worse in 3, and the same in 24. SSR students scored worse only in short- term studies of less than 7 months. In studies that lasted one year or longer, SSR students did better in 8 of 10, and there was no difference in the other two. The NRP found that most of the SSR studies were not valid or verifiable. Many studies were simply correlational. Thus, only 14 studies actually followed guidelines that could make them statistically significant. Of these studies, SSR was found ineffective. \\"Where do these negative SSR feelings come from?\\" Trelease asks. \\"Perhaps from the wonderful folks who make all those workbooks, textbooks, and score sheets that wouldn't be bought and used in class during the time students were lounging around reading books, magazines, and newspapers and getting so good at reading they might need even fewer of those sheets next year.\\" There is some support for this charge: A blog titled \\"Why Sustained Silent Reading (SSR) Doesn't Work\\" is posted by the publisher of four workbooks that sell for $89.99 each.http://penningtonpublishing.com/blog/reading/why-sustained-silent- reading-ssr-doesn’t-work/ accessed August 12, 2013. However, SSR was found ineffective by the NRP, not by publishing companies. ==Sustained silent reading practices== A range of practices have been associated with SSR, and some advocates suggest that teacher models of reading behavior (i.e., teachers read while the students read), a long-term commitment to SSR, availability of multiple level, high-interest texts, and a sense of reading community are particularly relevant. ==Free voluntary reading (FVR)== Free voluntary reading (FVR) or recreation reading, related to the comprehension hypothesis, is an educational theory that says many student gains in reading can be encouraged by giving them time to read what they want without too many evaluative measures. Sustained silent reading is a method of implementing recreational and FVR theory. ==In popular culture== *DEAR and SSR play a cameo role in the Ramona Quimby series of children's books by Beverly Cleary in Ramona Quimby, Age 8, in which young Ramona uses her assignment as an excuse not to talk to an annoying younger child. ==See also== * Extensive reading ==References== Category:Learning Category:Reading (process) ","title":"Sustained silent reading"},{"id":"1441221","text":"Axel Alarik Pehrsson-Bramstorp (born Axel Alarik Pehrsson; 19 August 1883 – 19 February 1954) was a Swedish politician and was Prime Minister of Sweden for a few months during 1936. As a parliamentarian he was known as Axel Pehrsson in Bramstorp, or just Bramstorp for short. In 1937 he officially added the name of his farm to his family name. ==Early life== Axel Pehrsson was a member of a farming family in Öja (now in Ystad Municipality) in Skåne. His father's death made it impossible for him to continue his schooling. After the age of 14, he later completed some adult education courses in a folkhögskola (the equivalent of community college). His parents' farm was of considerable size. At the time of his marriage he bought Bramstorp farm in the same parish and later took over the parental farm and bought several others as well. ==Political career== Pehrsson was active in local and regional politics, and in 1918 became a Member of the Second Chamber of the Riksdag, representing the Liberal Party, but he was not re-elected in 1921. He switched to the Agrarian Party Bondeförbundet (the \\"Farmers' League\\") and was elected a Member of the Second Chamber in 1929, where he served until 1949. He was chairman of the party from 1934 to 1949. After the Social Democratic cabinet of Per Albin Hansson was overthrown by a parliamentary majority in spring 1936, Pehrsson got the mandate of King Gustaf V to form a non-socialist coalition government. This turned out to be impossible and Pehrsson briefly headed a one-party cabinet as prime minister from 19 June to 28 September 1936. Since this cabinet was only in office during the summer it was called \\"The Holiday Government\\". He appointed himself Minister of Agriculture; after the elections to the Second Chamber in September he resigned as Prime Minister but remained as Minister of Agriculture in the new Hansson cabinet, which was a coalition of Social Democrats and the Agrarian Party. He continued in the same cabinet position in the national coalition cabinet which was formed under Hansson's prime ministership at the outbreak of World War II in 1939 and sat until the end of the war in 1945. ==Later activities== After the resignation of the war-time coalition cabinet, Pehrsson-Bramstorp held various important positions in agricultural organisations, while remaining chairman of his party and a member of parliament, until illness forced him to retire in 1949. He was awarded a knighthood of the Order of the Seraphim the same year, and lived the rest of his life on his farm. == References == Category:1883 births Category:1954 deaths Category:Members of the lower house of the Riksdag Category:Prime Ministers of Sweden Category:Centre Party (Sweden) politicians Category:Swedish Ministers for Agriculture Category:Leaders of political parties in Sweden Category:Great Depression in Sweden Category:People from Ystad ","title":"Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp"},{"id":"1441225","text":"Midnight Rose was a name taken by a group of United Kingdom science fiction and fantasy writers for a series of shared world anthologies published by the Penguin Books imprint Roc.

Contributors to individual anthologies included Marcus Rowland, Storm Constantine, Kim Newman, Charles Stross, Stephen Baxter, Colin Greenland, Graham Higgins, Paul Cornell and David Langford, among others. The anthologies were: ;Temps :Two volumes of superhero pastiches, set in a world where the United Kingdom and European Union demand registry of superhuman talents, whereupon the Talented are expected to be permanently \\"on call\\" as part-time superheroes, in exchange for a stipend. The popular perception of the British Civil Service is played up, with registering as a \\"Temp\\" being strangely similar to applying for Jobseeker's Allowance or other benefits. The two books were Temps (1991) and EuroTemps (1992). ;The Weerde :The concept behind The Weerde was that shapeshifting creatures had been living alongside humanity for millennia, mostly concealing themselves, but occasionally giving rise to legends of supernatural monsters. The books in this series were The Weerde Book One (1992) and The Weerde Book Two: Book of the Ancients (1993). ;Villains! :Villains! (1992) was a parody of heroic fantasy.

Since YAP supports inverse search (when the DVI file was compiled with source specials), it can be configured to launch a LaTeX editor for the source file, placing the cursor on the corresponding word under the cursor in YAP.

They play in the Belgian first division. The club was known as K.V. Red Star Waasland from 2002 until 2010, when they moved to the nearby stadium of defunct club Sint-Niklase and merged with K.S.K. Beveren. Waasland is the region where the towns of Haasdonk (a neighbourhood in Beveren) and Sint-Niklaas are located. KSK Beveren, a former Belgian champion and first division regular, had just finished at the last place in the second division and was struggling with financial problems. The club kept the history and matricule number of KV Red Star Waasland but moved from Sint-Niklaas to Beveren to play in a bigger stadium. ==History== The club was founded in 1936 as Red Star and registered to an amateur football association. In 1944, they joined the Royal Belgian Football Association and started playing in the lowest provincial league of West Flanders. Red Star Haasdonk first reached national football in 2000–01, and they finished first of the series in Promotion. They also reached the 2000–01 Belgian Cup round of 32, losing to first division club Gent. After their first season in the third division, they moved to the bigger stadium of defunct club Sint-Niklase SKE, the Puyenbekestadion, changing their name to KV Red Star Waasland. In 2003–04, they finished first in their series of the third division and promoted for the first time to the second division. In their first season at the second-highest level of football, Red Star Waasland finished 5th and qualified for the final round. The next season, they finished 4th, their best result as of 2010 but did not qualify for the final round. They reached again the round of 32 of the 2005–06 Belgian Cup, losing to neighbours KSK Beveren. In the 2007–08 Belgian Cup, Red Star Waasland reached the round of 16, their best cup result, by eliminating Lokeren. They lost to Anderlecht in the round of 16. The following season, they finished 4th again in the second division. In the summer of 2010 Red Star Waasland changed its name to Waasland-Beveren and moved to the bigger stadium of Beveren, the Freethiel Stadion. In 2011–12, they finished second in the Belgian second tier league and were promoted to the Belgian Pro League for the 2012–13 season. In 2019–20 Belgian First Division A due to the virus epidemic the league was forced to shut down its competition. At the time of the shut down Waasland Beveren was in 16th position and was expected to relegate having their last game scheduled against KAA Gent. After months of confusion the league decided to close the season the way it left off with one game remaining, without Waasland Beveren having a chance to save themselves competitively from relegation. Unfairly enough the first division B finalists were allowed to play their playoff games for promotion to the First Division A despite the league shutdown. Having seen the hypocrisy, Waasland Beveren decided to take legal action for unfair use of power. The court battle lasted for many weeks and finally justice was awarded in Waasland Beveren favour to remain in First Division. The league was forced to make reforms and change the way the league operated and thus the league comprised 18 teams instead of 16 which included Waasland Beveren and the two finalists from First Division B, both K Beerschot VA ( official champions) and OH Leuven. On the 13th of September 2020, it was announced that Waasland-Beveren would be taken over by American sports investment group, Bolt Football Holdings now having a 97% share in the club. ==Players== ===Current squad=== :As of 6 October 2020 ===Out on loan=== ==Managers== * Dirk Geeraerd (2005–2006) * Regi Van Acker (2006–2007) * Dirk Geeraerd (1 July 2010 – 18 November 2012) * Glen De Boeck (19 November 2012 – 29 October 2013) * Bob Peeters (5 November 2013 – 23 May 2014) * Ronny Van Geneugden (28 May 2014 – 30 December 2014) * Guido Brepoels (2015) * Stijn Vreven (2015–2016) * Čedomir Janevski (2017) * Philippe Clement (2017) * Sven Vermant (2018) * Yannick Ferrera (2018) * Adnan Čustović (17 November 2018 – 26 August 2019) * Arnauld Mercier (30 August 2019 – 2 March 2020) * Nicky Hayen (4 May 2020 – present) ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Association football clubs established in 1936 Category:Football clubs in Belgium Category:1936 establishments in Belgium Category:Organisations based in Belgium with royal patronage ","title":"Waasland-Beveren"},{"id":"1441251","text":"Fisher cat may refer to: * Fisher (animal), a relative of the weasel * Fishing cat, a wild cat found in Asia (Prionailurus viverrinus) * New Hampshire Fisher Cats, a minor-league baseball team in the US ==See also== * Swimming cat or Van cat, a landrace of domestic cat Category:Animal common name disambiguation pages ","title":"Fisher cat"},{"id":"1441263","text":"Neither Here nor There is a retrospective artbook by the Melvins, which was released in 2004 through Ipecac Recordings to celebrate their 20th anniversary.

Their highest charting single was \\"Someone's Singing New York New York\\" (1991) written by Hirst. It reached No. 29 on the ARIA Australian Singles Chart. ==History== ===Formation=== In Sydney in 1990, while Midnight Oil were taking a break, Hirst joined up with guitarist Andrew Dickson (The Narcs, NZ), drummer Dorland Bray (Do-Ré-Mi), guitarist Leszek Karski (Midnight Oil producer) and Hoodoo Gurus' Grossman to form a side project called Ghostwriters. The name refers to ghostwriters where famous writers wish to be anonymous. Ghostwriters' line-ups - both live and in the studio - changed considerably through the years, with only founders Hirst and Grossman being mainstays (and their driving force) at all times. Between successive album releases Hirst and Grossman returned to active involvement with Oils & Gurus respectively. ===Debut album=== The first album, Ghostwriters (1991), was released by Virgin Records and its credits illustrated the Ghostwriters concept as it did not list any band member's name. Session musicians were acknowledged by their first name and a single initial for the surname. (Later re-release of the album included band member names.) The album reached No. 96 on the Australian album charts. \\"Someone's Singing New York New York\\" was released as a single with the statement \\"written, played and produced by ghostwriters\\", the single reaching No. 29 on the Australian singles charts.Australian (ARIA) chart peaks: *Top 50 peaks: *Top 100 peaks to December 2010: ===Second album=== Second Skin (1996) followed on Mercury Records. By that time, Ghostwriters consisted primarily of Hirst and Grossman whose names were - along with those of the numerous guest musicians - now also listed in the album's liner notes. Videos were produced for the two tracks \\"Impossible Shame\\" and \\"Second Skin\\", but - as with the debut record - sales of the album as well as the singles fell short of the record company's expectations and the contract was not renewed. Consequently, the first two Ghostwriters albums went out of print quickly and were not available for the most part of the 1990s. ===Third album=== In 2000, Ghostwriters (now called Rob Hirst & The Ghostwriters) released Fibromoon. The band released it independently, on Ghostwriters Records, which meant that it was only available at a select number of stores, including some online outlets. Along with Fibromoon, the group re-released their two previous albums (with slightly altered artwork) through the same outlets. By 2006, all Ghostwriters albums were once again out of print and no longer available. ===Fourth album=== After a longer recording hiatus (during which the band did play a number of live sessions in various Sydney pubs), Ghostwriters started recording again in late 2006. The resulting album, Political Animal (2007), dropped the \\"Rob Hirst &\\" prefix and was released in Australia on 14 April 2007. It was released by Sony BMG Australia (also Midnight Oil's record company), marking the first time in over ten years that a Ghostwriters album became available through a major record company. Political Animal saw Hirst's former Midnight Oil musician Martin Rotsey formally join the band, and the title track features former Midnight Oil keyboard/guitarist Jim Moginie. Political Animal collects four new songs along with eight previously released tracks, with some partly re-recorded. While Midnight Oil were rumoured to be reuniting again for the Australian leg of the Live Earth concerts in July 2007, this was not to be the case. However, Ghostwriters did perform, playing their own songs \\"World is Almost at Peace\\" and \\"Second Skin\\" followed by the Midnight Oil classic \\"When The Generals Talk\\". ===Further Contributors=== Over the years, several other musicians contributed to Ghostwriters, both live and in studio. These include Warne Livesey (former Midnight Oil producer), Peter West, Hirst's brother Stephen Hirst, Brad Shepherd (Hoodoo Gurus), Charlie McMahon, as well as Jeremy Smith, Jack Howard and Michael Waters (all three from Hunters and Collectors). Hirst's fellow Midnight Oil members Jim Moginie and Bones Hillman made guest appearances at live gigs; both also contributed to Ghostwriters songs Moginie plays keyboards on the track \\"Political Animal\\" (2007), while Hillman sang backup vocals on the song \\"Neon Garden\\" from the Fibromoon. Oils guitarist Martin Rotsey had been a guest musician at a number of Ghostwriters concerts before officially joining in 2006. == Discography == ===Albums=== ===Singles=== * \\"Someone's Singing New York New York\\" (1991) Virgin Records (#29 Australia) * \\"Runaway Bay\\" (1992) Virgin Records * \\"World Is Almost At Peace\\" (1992) Virgin Records * \\"Second Skin\\" (1996) Mercury Records * \\"Impossible Shame\\" (1996) Mercury Records * \\"Start The Day\\" (2007) Sony BMG (promo only) ==Members== ===Core members=== * Rob Hirst - vocals, guitar, keyboard, drums, percussion * Rick Grossman - bass, guitar, vocals In addition to mainstays Hirst and Grossman, Ghostwriters consisted of: ===Additional personnel=== credited to: * Andrew Dickson - guitar * Dorland Bray (former Do-Ré-Mi drummer) - acoustic guitar, drums, vocals * Leszek Karski (former Midnight Oil producer) - guitar * Brad Shepherd (Hoodoo Gurus) - harmonica * Glad Reed - (red ochre) -trombone * David \\"DB\\" Claringbold (red ochre) - acoustic guitar * Stephen Hirst — piano, Hammond organ ===Second Skin (1996)=== credited to: * Mark Moffat - guitar, synthesizer * Chris Abrahams - Hammond organ, mellotron * Jan Preston - piano, rhodes organ, backing vocals (track 9) * Dominic 'Dom' Turner (from Australian blues band Backsliders) - slide guitar * Peter West - cello, mandolin, violin, string arrangement (track 3) * Jeremy Smith - French horn * Charlie McMahon - didgeridoo * Iva Davies - oboe * Jack Howard - trumpet * Michael Waters - trombone * Andrew Dickson — guitar (track 1) * Warne Livesey — bodhrán (track 2), percussion (track 9) * Paul De Como — guitar (tracks 6, 10) * Howlin' Wind — flute (track 9) * Colin Timms — Gamelan (track 9) * Sunil De Silva — congas, shaker ===Fibromoon (2000)=== * D.C.

It is the premier institution devoted to the aesthetic appreciation of folk art and creative expressions of contemporary self-taught artists from the United States and abroad. Its collection holds over 8,000 objects from the 18th century to the present. These works span both traditional folk art and the work of contemporary self-taught artists and Art Brut. In its ongoing exhibitions, educational programming, and outreach, the museum showcases the creative expressions of individuals whose talents developed without formal artistic training. Admission is free. The museum had record yearly attendance of more than 130,000 visitors. ==History== alt=American Folk Art Museum: Red Logo Since receiving a provisional charter in 1961, the American Folk Art Museum has continually expanded its mission and purview. At its inception, the museum lacked a permanent collection, an endowment, and a building. Despite lacking these institutional fixtures, founding Trustees Joseph B. Martinson and Adele Earnest had a vision: the advancement of the understanding and appreciation of American folk arts. In the museum's nearly sixty-year history, this dedication has held true. The museum's evolving mission reflects the shifting understanding of folk art internationally.For more information about the history of the American Folk Art Museum, see Gerard C. Wertkin, \\"Foreword,\\" in Stacy C. Hollander and Brooke Davis Anderson, American Anthem: Masterworks from the American Folk Art Museum (New York: American Folk Art Museum in association with Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 2001), pp. 10–13. The Museum of Early American Folk Arts, as it was known initially, held its first exhibition in a rented space on 49 West 53rd Street in 1961. The museum's collection was launched in 1962 with the gift of a gate in the form of an American flag, celebrating the nation's centennial. The gift reflected the museum's early focus on eighteenth and nineteenth-century vernacular arts from the northeast America. In 1966, after receiving a permanent charter, the museum expanded its name and mission. As the Museum of American Folk Arts, it looked beyond the traditional definitions of American folk art. Its exhibitions and collection began to reflect “every aspect of the folk arts in America – north, south, east, and west.”Folk Art, Summer 2001, 21. Founding curator Herbert W. Hemphill Jr. “expanded the notion of folk art beyond traditional, utilitarian, and communal expressions.”Brooke Davis Anderson, \\"The Contemporary Collection: Through The Lens of Language,\\" American Anthem: Masterworks from the American Folk Art Museum (New York: -, 15). Under his direction, the museum began to champion idiosyncratic and individualistic artwork from the fields of traditional and contemporary folk art. In doing so, the museum ushered in a new era in the field of twentieth-century folk art. The 1990s brought new focus to the diversity and multiculturalism of American folk art. Offering a more inclusive vision, the museum began to present African American and Latino artworks in their exhibitions and permanent collections. Director Gerard C. Wertkin announced American folk art's common heritage as “promoting an appreciation of diversity in a way that does not foster ethnic chauvinism or racial division.”Folk Art The museum further established its broadened outlook with the 1998 formation of the Contemporary Center, a division of the museum devoted to the work of 20th and 21st century self-taught artists, as well as non-American artworks in the tradition of European art brut. In 2001, the museum opened the Henry Darger Study Center to house 24 of the self-taught artist's works, as well as a collection of his books, tracings, drawings, and source materials. In 2001, the museum chose its current name, American Folk Art Museum. Recognizing that American folk art could only be fully understood in an international context, the word American functions as an indication of the museum's location, emphasis, and principal patronage rather than as a limitation on the kind of art it collects, interprets, or presents. The museum's current programming reflects this shift in focus. Past exhibits have included folk arts of Latin America, England, Norway, among other countries and continents. As the museum's mission developed, so did its effort to establish a permanent home. In 1979, the Museum's Board of Trustees purchased two townhouses on West 53rd Street, adjacent to Museum's rented quarters at 49 West 53rd Street. In 1984, while waiting to develop the West 53rd properties, the museum continued to organize exhibitions and educational programs from a former carriage house at 125 West 55th Street. Five years later, a new branch of the museum, the Eva and Morris Feld Gallery, opened at 2 Lincoln Square, New York, opposite Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. In 2001, a new building on the 45 and 47 West 53rd Street was inaugurated. Tod Williams and Billie Tsien designed the building. From 2001 to 2011, the midtown space served as the museum's main branch. However, facing increasingly high bond payments, the museum sold the midtown branch to the Museum of Modern Art. When MoMA announced that it was going to demolish the building in connection with its expansion, there was outcry and considerable discussion about the issue, but the museum ultimately proceeded with its original plans. Following the sale, the American Folk Art Museum used its facility at 2 Lincoln Square as its main exhibition and shop space. In 2014, the museum's archives, library, and administrative staff moved to Long Island City, Queens. In September 2017, the museum opened the Self-Taught Genius Gallery at its facility in Long Island City. The STG gallery shows art from the museum's collection in thematic exhibitions that change every few months. The STG Gallery is funded in large part by the Henry Luce Foundation. ==The collection== Standing as \\"one of New York City’s great treasures\\",Smith, Roberta (August 2, 2012). \\"Everyday Treasures Gaze Out to Sea\\". The New York Times. the museum's 7,000 plus collection has been formed almost entirely through gifts. Spanning a wide variety of mediums, the collection includes over 1,200 paintings on canvas or panel, 1,500 drawings and works on paper, 1,000 sculptural objects, 1,000 textile items, 200 ceramic objects, 100 pieces of furniture, 300 decorated household items from the Historical Society of Early American Decoration, and two large-scale architectural models. Additionally, the museum has a large collection of archives, artist files, films, recordings, photographs, original research, historical records, and other assorted and valuable ephemera. Most notably, the museum holds the largest collection of archival materials from self-taught artist Henry Darger. The collection ranges from early portraits by Sheldon Peck, Ammi Phillips, Asa Ames, and Samuel Addison Shute and Ruth Whittier Shute, quilts and schoolgirl needlework, furniture, and weathervanes to works by acclaimed masters such as Thornton Dial, Morris Hirshfield, Martín Ramírez, Judith Scott, Mary T. Smith and Bill Traylor. The museum continues to add to its growing collection. In recent years acquisitions have included a version of Edward Hicks's (1780–1849) famed The Peaceable Kingdom. Notably, this painting, which Hicks gave to his daughter, remained with Hicks's descendants for many years. The portraits Increase Child Bosworth and Abigail Munro Bosworth by Sheldon Peck (1797–1868), Pickman's Mephitic Models by Paul Laffoley (1935–2016), Plantation Life by Clemmentine Hunter (1886/87–1988), and Heavenly Children by William Matthew Prior (1806–1873). ===Selected collection highlights=== File:The Peaceable Kingdom, Edward Hicks (1790–1849).jpgEdward Hicks, Peaceable Kingdom, 1829–1831 File:Flag Gate, Artist unidentified.jpgArtist unidentified, Flag Gate, 1876 File:Bird of Paradise Quilt Top, Artist unidentified.jpgArtist unidentified, Bird of Paradise Quilt Top, 1858–1863 File:Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, Ammi Phillips (1788–1865).jpgAmmi Phillips, Girl in Red Dress with Cat and Dog, 1830-1835 File:Hudsonian Curlew Weathervane, Artist unidentified.jpgArtist unidentified, Hudsonian Curlew Weathervane, 1874 File:Master Burnham, Samuel Addison Shute (1803–1836) and Ruth Whittier Shute (1803–1882).jpgSamuel Addison Shute and Ruth Whittier Shute, Master Burnham, 1831-1832 File:Gift Drawing The Tree of Light or Blazing Tree, Hannah Cohoon (1788–1864).jpgHannah Cohoon, Gift Drawing: The Tree of Light or Blazing Tree, 1845 ==Exhibitions== Each year, the museum mounts a number of exhibitions, which span from the traditional folk arts to the more contemporary “self-taught” expressions. The museum's exhibits frequently examine the works of a specific artist or the significance of a particular medium, such as quilts or tinsel paintings. Through its exhibits, the museum continues to develop the understanding of folk and self-taught artists. Past exhibits have showcased the works of “undersung” masters, such as Thomas Chambers and Asa Ames.Roberta Smith, “As Folk Art Museum Teeters, a Huge Loss Looms,” The New York Times, September 19, 2011 Additionally, the museum has hosted solo exhibitions dedicated to the work of self-taught greats: Martín Ramírez, Eugene Von Bruenchenhein, Willem van Genk, Ronald Lockett, John Dunkley, Paa Joe, and Bill Traylor. Past exhibits have also positioned traditional folk art in conversation with more contemporary art. In the museum's 2008 exhibit, “The Seduction of Light: Ammi Phillips/ Mark Rothko Compositions in Pink, Green, and Red” explored the visual connections between Rothko's famed color blocks and Phillip's heightened color palette. In 2013, the museum invited thirteen fashion designers to create an original work, inspired by a piece in their collection. The resulting exhibit “Folk Couture: Fashion and Folk Art” ran from January 21 – April 23, 2014. Subsequent major exhibitions include 2016's Mystery and Benevolence: Masonic and Odd Fellows Folk Art, Securing the Shadow: Posthumous Portraiture in America, Eugen Gabritschevsky: Theater of the Imperceptible, Carlo Zinelli (1916–1974), 2017's War and Pieced: The Annette Gero Collection of Wartime Quilts, 2018's Vestiges & Verse: Notes From the Newfangled Epic, and, also in 2018, Charting the Divine Plan: The Art of Orra White Hitchcock (1796–1863). In 2019 the museum will show Made in New York City: The Business of Folk Art. At the Self- Taught Genius Gallery in Long Island City, the exhibitions have included Holding Space, Handstitched Worlds: The Cartography of Quilts, and Roadside Attraction. By raising traditional folk artists and self-taught artists from the periphery of the mainstream art world, the museum has continued to prove \\"the worth of instinctive, self-taught artistry.\\" Stacy C. Hollander is the museum's chief curator and director of exhibitions. She has been at the institution since 1985 and has held her current position since 1992. Since joining the museum in 2013, Dr. Valérie Rousseau has served as the curator of self-taught art and art brut. ===Notable exhibitions=== In 2014, the museum launched the exhibition, Self-Taught Genius: Treasures from the American Folk Art Museum. Featuring more than 100 works of art, \\"Self-Taught Genius\\" offered \\"an intellectually provocative effort to rethink the nature of artistic creativity\\" from the eighteenth century to the present. Following its New York premiere, the exhibition travelled to six cities, as part of a national tour funded by the Henry Luce Foundation's 75th anniversary initiative. ==Publications== In December 2013, the American Folk Art Museum launched a fully accessible digital archive of 117 issues of its in-house magazine, Folk Art, formerly known as The Clarion. From winter 1971 to fall 2008, Folk Art, was published on average of three times a year. It served as a forum for original research and new scholarship in the field of American folk art. Topics ranged from traditional arts, such as portraiture, schoolgirl arts, painted furniture, and pottery, to original discourses on under-recognized artists. ==Honors== In 2007, it was among over 530 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.Museum gift shopIn 2013, the Encyclopedic Palace, in the Museum's collection, served as the inspiration and theme for the 55th installation of the international Venice Biennale. Marino Auriti (1891–1980), a self-taught Italian American artist, created the work as an architectural model for imaginary museum that would house all worldly knowledge. Massimiliano Gioni, artistic director of the Biennale, detailed the enduring relevancy of Auriti's work. “Today, as we grapple with a constant flood of information, such attempts to structure knowledge into all-inclusive systems seem even more necessary and even more desperate.” ==Gift shop== Cited as one of the “World’s Best Museum Gift Shops,” the museum's gift shop offers gift items, handcrafted in the folk tradition, such as jewelry, personal accessories, frames, toys, objects for the home, as well as note cards, books, and catalogs. ==See also== *List of museums and cultural institutions in New York City ==References== ==Further reading== *Folk Art (formerly The Clarion).

He authored Thoughts on Political Economy (1820) and The Elements of Political Economy (1823). ==Economic theory== He theorized that \\"labor creates wealth,\\" which may have been an improvement based on the thinking of Adam Smith of Europe. He thought that the economy of England was actually the economy of the higher-ranking members of that society and not the economy of the entire nation. He held that wealth is not an aggregation of exchange values, as Adam Smith had conceived it, but the capacity or the opportunity to acquire the necessaries and conveniences of life by labor. He systematized the infant industry argument.Chang, Ha-Joon. \\"Kicking Away the Ladder: How the Economic and Intellectual Histories of Capitalism Have Been Re-Written to Justify Neo-Liberal Capitalism\\". Post-Autistic Economics Review. 4 September 2002: Issue 15, Article 3. Retrieved on 8 October 2008. ==Political theory== In 1845, he wrote a book entitled 'The Elements of Constitutional Law' which included basic definitions of a government, a sovereign state, a confederacy and a constitution. While these concepts have evolved, much of the basic theories which he outlined still have relevance in modern political analysis. His writings affected political developments in the United States. In his Elements on Political Economy, he represents himself as a protectionist. In Book II Chapter Nine, Of Protecting Duties, he says that protectionism is aligned with national interests and the government should put national interests ahead of individual interests. To Raymond, national interests are never in harmony with individual interests. The protective tariff represents national interests, Raymond conveys, and the advantage of protective tariffs is the leverage of a nation and the special treatment over foreigners in the nation's domestic commerce and industry of the nation. His policy was opposed by Adam Smith. Raymond believed national interests are monumental and trump individual interests. To Raymond, defending national interests over individual interests was like military strategy. He stated that the primordial perspective is that the army is one and the general the commander. Subordinate troops are not allowed to have the privileges of power or concerns or pursuits that directly oppose the general prosperity of the military unit. He then conveys that the principle that I political economy, no private interest or right may have authority over the general interest of the country, and if a political economy does not acknowledge that principle, it will forever remain in a dismal state. Raymond also expounded on his government philosophy. For him, the public good is above all forms of citizens, property, and individual rights. Government can seize private land and lay and collect taxes only in the name of the general good. The government has the right to take away land to use it for internal improvements or infrastructure. In addition, government has the prerogative and the absolute right to establish regulations for property or trade that benefits the general good. Raymond states that protectionism is vehemently opposed to laissez- faire. In Book II, Chapter VIII, \\"Monopolies and Colonial Systems,\\" Raymond wrote, \\"There is no hardship or injustice, in excluding foreign nations from a participation in our domestic trade, but there would be a very great hardship, as well as injustice, in excluding any portion of our own citizens from a participation in it.\\" === On unproductive labor === In Book I, Chapter XVII, Raymond considered the labor that laissez-faire advocates like not to be worthwhile to civilization. Protectionists understand what is a useful pursuit and what is a blight. Raymond stated that a destructive occupation is a detriment to civilization and that a pursuit fails to help society if it has no ability to increase the standards of the requirements and conveniences of life or to foster the joy and happiness of the society. Also, he said that when poets, painters and musicians cease to produce innocent enjoyments, they become uncongenial and unproductive. However, he considered the best example of an occupation that never suited society well to be the speculator and the stock-jobber (stock broker): \\"The object of those employed in these occupations, is not to produce any of the necessaries and comforts of life. Different persons may have other opinions of the moral character of these occupations, but all must agree that they are useless, and unproductive to the community.\\" He then finished the chapter by stating the duties of man and government: each man must endeavor to foster the longevity of civilization, and no man has the warranted right to be a mindless being, by using his time repugnantly or by engaging in uncongenial pursuit. For him, government is an imperative and a paramount concern to stifle all occupations that are grotesque and a blight to mankind and, as much as possible, not to facilitate them.Elements of Political Economy, Volumes I and II, 1964 ==ReferencesCategory:Enlightenment philosophers Category:American economists Category:American political writers Category:American male non- fiction writers Category:1786 births Category:1849 deaths ","title":"Daniel Raymond"},{"id":"1441316","text":"The National Reading Panel (NRP) was a United States government body. Formed in 1997 at the request of Congress, it was a national panel with the stated aim of assessing the effectiveness of different approaches used to teach children to read. The panel was created by Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) at the National Institutes of Health, in consultation with the United States Secretary of Education, and included prominent experts in the fields of reading education, psychology, and higher education. The panel was chaired by Donald Langenberg (University of Maryland), and included the following members: Gloria Correro (Mississippi State U.), Linnea Ehri (City University of New York), Gwenette Ferguson (middle school teacher, Houston, TX), Norma Garza (parent, Brownsville, TX), Michael L. Kamil (Stanford U.), Cora Bagley Marrett (U. Massachusetts- Amherst), S. J. Samuels (U. of Minnesota), Timothy Shanahan (educator) (U. of Illinois at Chicago), Sally Shaywitz (Yale U.), Thomas Trabasso (U. of Chicago), Joanna Williams (Columbia U.), Dale Willows (U. Of Toronto), Joanne Yatvin (school district superintendent, Boring, OR). In April 2000, the panel issued its report, \\"Teaching Children to Read,\\" and completed its work. The report summarized research in eight areas relating to literacy instruction: phonemic awareness instruction, phonics instruction, fluency instruction, vocabulary instruction, text comprehension instruction, independent reading, computer assisted instruction, and teacher professional development. The final report was endorsed by all of the panel members except one. Joanne Yatvin wrote a minority report criticizing the work of the NRP because it (a) did not include teachers of early reading on the panel or as reviewers of the report and (b) only focused on a subset of important reading skills. Timothy Shanahan, another panel member, later responded that Dr. Yatvin had received permission to investigate areas of reading instruction that the panel could not address within the limited time provided for their work. Shanahan noted that she had not pursued additional areas of interest despite the willingness of the panel to allow her to do so. In 2001, President George W. Bush announced that the report would be the basis of federal literacy policy and was used prominently to craft Reading First, a $5 billion federal reading initiative that was part of the No Child Left Behind legislation. ==Phonemic awareness== The NRP said results from phonemic awareness (PA) instruction were \\"positive\\" and helped students in kindergarten and grade one to improve their reading, spelling and comprehension, regardless of their Socioeconomic status (SES). However, disabled readers did not benefit in spelling. The report clearly specified that the most effective manner of teaching PA was to include it with letters and the manipulation of phonemes (i.e. segmenting and blending with Phonics), rather than limiting it to speech. ==Phonics instruction== The NRP reviewed 38 studies on the teaching of phonics and found that teaching children the relationship between letters and spelling patterns and pronunciation and how to decode words improved reading achievement. Young children who received such instruction did better with decoding words, nonsense words, spelling, fluency, and reading comprehension. Older disabled readers also benefited from such instruction in terms of improvement in decoding, but without commensurate gains in spelling or reading comprehension. Systematic phonics instruction — that is instruction based on a planned curriculum — was found to be superior to more opportunistic versions in which teachers tried to teach what they thought students needed. There were no statistical differences between synthetic phonics programs in which each letter sound is taught versus analytic phonics that analyzes the sounds within complete words. Finally, the panel emphasized that \\"phonics should not become the dominant component\\" and \\"should be integrated with other reading instruction to create a balanced reading program\\". ==Oral Reading Fluency== The NRP analyzed 16 studies showing that teaching oral reading fluency led to improvements in word reading, fluency, and reading comprehension for students in grades 1-4, and for older students with reading problems. Instruction that had students reading texts aloud, with repetition and feedback led to clear learning benefits. ==Encouraging Students to Read== The panel analyzed the published research on the effects of encouraging students to read. Most of the studies of this focused on the practice of sustained silent reading, in which teachers makes books and time available for students to read on their own without interference, interruption, or teacher involvement. There is a widely held belief that if teachers encouraged students to engage in voluntary reading it would lead to better reading achievement. Unfortunately, the panel found that research \\"has not clearly demonstrated this relationship\\". In fact, the few studies in which this idea has been tried \\"raise serious questions\\" of its efficacy. ==Vocabulary and Comprehension Strategy Instruction== Comprehension instruction includes several factors including vocabulary instruction which is a key to learning the connection between oral speaking, reading and writing, and comprehension. The NRP concluded that a variety of vocabulary instruction methods can be effective, although it was unable to recommend any single method. However, it suggested that vocabulary instruction should be both direct and indirect, and include repetition, exposures in different media, and rich contexts. It was also evident that teaching students how to think about the ideas in text can improve reading comprehension. Particularly powerful in this regard were teaching students to summarize the information that they had read, or having them ask (and answer) questions about the ideas. Additionally, it was also beneficial to guide students to do the following, a) monitor their comprehension, essentially paying attention to whether they were understanding during reading and taking some kind of action if they were not, b) use their prior knowledge, c) visualize the information described in text, or d) think about the structure of a text through story mapping. The NRP suggested there is a need for greater emphasis in teacher education on the teaching of reading comprehension. ==Computer Technology and Reading Instruction== Of the hundreds of studies including computer technology, only 5% met the standards of the NRP so they concluded that more research is required before they can make any recommendations. ==References== Category:1997 establishments in the United States Category:Organizations promoting literacy Category:Learning to read Category:Educational organizations based in the United States Category:Reading (process) ","title":"National Reading Panel"},{"id":"1441317","text":"Royale Union Saint-Gilloise, abbreviated to Union SG, unofficially simply called Union, is a Belgian football club originally located in the municipality of Saint-Gilles, in Brussels, although since the 1920s it has been based at the Stade Joseph Marien in the neighbouring municipality of Forest. The club is one of the most successful in the history of Belgian football, but currently plays in the second division. The club won eleven Belgian championships between 1904 and 1935, making it the most successful Belgian club before World War II. The team colours are blue and yellow and its matricule is the n°10. The team is traditionally popular with the Flemish- and French-speaking natives of Brussels and both the French and the Flemish speaking free universities. ==History== The club was founded in 1897 and obtained its first of eleven titles as Champion of Belgium in 1904. From 1933 to 1935 the team played 60 consecutive matches undefeated, setting a still unbeaten record in Belgium. In the early 1900s the club also had a dominant spell in some of the very first \\"European\\" Cup competitions that took place, prior to officially sanctioned UEFA competitions. Between 1958 and 1965 the club had a brief spell of European success, playing the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and reaching the semi-finals in the 1958–60 edition after a two legged victory against A.S. Roma. In 1963, however, the club was relegated to the second division, and in 1980 even fell as low as the Belgian Promotion division.

Their ultras are known as the Union Bhoys, and sit in the all-standing Tribune Est. The Union Bhoys have friendships with RFC Liège and Cercle Bruges supporters. Union share a Brussels city derby, also known as a \\"derby of the Zwanze\\" with Racing White Daring Molenbeek, which stems from their old rivalry with Daring Club Brussels, that has been encapsulated in the Brussels play Bossemans et Coppenolle. However, the two are said to have a love-hate relationship, having both experienced financial difficulty in the modern era, and organised friendlies together in support. Union also have a rivalry with neighbour RSC Anderlecht, although the two have met even fewer times in the modern era than RWDM and Union have.

He was named for the Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. ==Athletic career== Borzakovskiy's first major international success was a victory at the 2000 European Indoor Championships when he was only 18 years old. At the 2000 Summer Olympics he reached the 800 m final, in which he finished sixth. In 2001 he won the World Indoor title over 800 m but decided not to participate in the World Championships in Edmonton. On 24 August 2001, Borzakovskiy posted a time of 1:42.47 minutes. That currently makes him the 10th fastest man in history over that distance. In addition, Borzakovskiy was ranked No.1 in the world in that year. In 2002, Borzakovskiy ran the 400 m at the European Championships in Munich but was eliminated in the early stages. The following season he picked up a silver medal over 800 m at the World Championships in Paris. Borzakovskiy's greatest achievement was his victory in the 800 m race at the Athens Olympics in 2004. By this point, he was well known for sitting back until about the last 200 metres and then using a great kick to catch up and win, reminiscent of the tactics of U.S.'s Dave Wottle. At the Olympics he employed the same strategy, using this 'late charge' to come from behind in the last 150 meters to pass world record holder Wilson Kipketer, who was leading with only 20 metres to go, and take the victory. Borzakovskiy's decisive pass so deflated Kipketer that he allowed Mbulaeni Mulaudzi to nip him at the line. In the 2005 World Championships he took silver in the 800 m competition, overtaking everyone but Bahrain's Rashid Ramzi on the final straight. Ramzi was disqualified from the 2008 Olympics for doping violations but so far has been allowed to keep his prior medals. At the 2006 World Indoor Championships he won a bronze medal. Borzakovskiy won a bronze medal at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka. The final ran at a very slow pace and he was boxed in on the final lap which slowed down his sprint in the last 100 m. In 2008 he made an impressive comeback by posting a time of 1:42.79 minutes, his first time under 1:43 since 2001. He made the Olympic team at the Beijing Olympics but unexpectedly failed to qualify for the 800 m final, finishing only third in his semifinal heat. In 2009 he won gold at the European Indoor Championships in 1:48.55. On 23 August he placed fourth at the final of the 12th IAAF World Championships in Berlin in 1:45.57. Most of his 2010 season was lost due to an injury. In 2011, he achieved yet another podium finish with a bronze medal in the 800 meters at the 2011 IAAF World Outdoor Championships. In this race, Borzakovskiy ran most of the last lap in second place and was himself overtaken just before the finish line. In 2012, he won the European Championship 800 metre gold medal, in Helsinki. At the 2012 London Olympics, he failed to make the finals as he was eliminated in the semi-final round. ==References== Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:People from Ramensky District Category:Russian male middle-distance runners Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Russia Category:Olympic gold medalists for Russia Category:Mordvin people Category:World Athletics Championships medalists Category:European Athletics Championships medalists Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:World Athletics Indoor Championships winners ","title":"Yuriy Borzakovskiy"},{"id":"1441342","text":"A 1908 Railway Clearing House map of part of the Hayes Line, between Lower Sydenham and Elmers End, showing the now closed Addiscombe Line and W&SCR; branches off the Hayes Line.

The station is on Elmers End Road (A214), at the south- east corner of South Norwood Country Park. One former railway platform is now the terminus for Tramlink services to central Croydon. Work is underway to open a second tram platform and double the tram line to Arena to increase capacity. As of March 2019, vegetation has been cleared to make way for the new line. The platform is due to open in December 2020. ==History== ===Early years (1857-1922)=== The Mid Kent line was built by the Mid-Kent and North Kent Junction Railway (MK&NKJR;) and was opened on 1 January 1857 as far as Beckenham Junction. From opening the line was worked by the South Eastern Railway (SER). Seven years later the MK&NKJR; built an extension from a new junction station at New Beckenham to Croydon (Addiscombe Road) with an intermediate station at Elmers End, which again was operated by the SER from opening. The station was occupied in what was then a rural area with scattered farm houses and hamlets. The station building was located on the down side whilst a goods yard was provided on the up side. By 1914 Elmers End had almost become part of Beckenham on the east side of the railway. On the opposite side a sewage works, the Croydon Council refuse destructor, Beckenham Council's refuse destructor and electric power station as well as two brick works and Crystal Palace District Cemetery were all located. Sidings served the Croydon and Beckenham Council sites. The station was rebuilt in 1881/2 in anticipation of the opening of the Hayes branch. Bay platforms were provided on the up and down side and a new 43 lever signal box was provided immediately south of the station. New coal sidings, in anticipation of further suburban growth, were also provided on the up side. The Elmers End – Hayes section was built by the West Wickham & Hayes Railway, and left the existing line just south of the station on a tight 13 chain curve. It was sold to the South Eastern Railway in 1881 and opened on 29 May 1882. Initially 13 services each way were operated between Elmers End and Hayes with central London passengers having to change trains. In 1898 the South Eastern Railway and its bitter rivals the London Chatham and Dover Railway agreed to work as one railway company under the name of the South Eastern and Chatham Railway and Elmers End became an SECR station. ===Southern Railway (1923-1947)=== Following the Railways Act 1921 (also known as the Grouping Act), Elmers End became a Southern Railway station on 1 January 1923. The Mid-Kent line was electrified with the (750 V DC third rail) system and electric services commenced on 28 February 1926. Early electric services were worked by early Southern Railway 3-car Electric Multiple Unit trains often built from old SECR carriages. In connection with the electrification the track bed between Elmers End and Clock House area was raised in an effort to reduce flooding. Electrification led to further house building between Clock House and Elmers End stations. During World War 2 the station was hit three times by bombs during 1941. Some track alterations took place in 1947 which included the link between the Up Bay and Hayes line being removed, platform lengthening and direct access from the Hayes branch to the down bay. ===British Railways (1948-1994)=== After World War II and following nationalisation on 1 January 1948, the station fell under the auspices of British Railways Southern Region. Three-aspect colour light signals were installed at the station in 1956. The goods yard was closed on 6 May 1963. The station building was destroyed by fire on 16 December 1973 On 28 May 1975 all signalling came under the control of the London Bridge Signalling Centre and the 1882 signal box was closed. The down bay was taken out of passenger use and became an engineer's siding. Upon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: InterCity, operating principal express services; and London & South East (renamed Network SouthEast in 1986) who operated commuter services in the London area. Services to Sanderstead ceased in June 1983 with closure of the Woodside and South Croydon Joint Railway. ===The privatisation era (1994-Present Day)=== Following privatisation of British Rail on 1 April 1994 the infrastructure at Elmers End station became the responsibility of Railtrack whilst a business unit operated the train services. On 13 October 1996 operation of the passenger services passed to Connex South Eastern who were originally due to run the franchise until 2011. In 1997 the line to Addiscombe closed – up to this point it was generally worked by a 2-car EMU connecting to and from Hayes services. It re-opened in 2000 as part of the Croydon Tramlink network. Following a number of accidents and financial issues Railtrack plc was sold to Network Rail on 3 October 2002 who became responsible for the infrastructure.Network Rail closer to Railtrack takeover BBC News, 1 April 2016 On 27 June 2003 the Strategic Rail Authority decided to strip Connex of the franchise citing poor financial management and run the franchise itself.Basher Bowker pulls the plug on Connex The Telegraph 29 June 2003 Connex South Eastern continued to operate the franchise until 8 November 2003 with the services transferring to the Strategic Rail Authority's South Eastern Trains subsidiary the following day. On 30 November 2005 the Department for Transport awarded Govia the Integrated Kent franchise. The services operated by South Eastern Trains transferred to Southeastern on 1 April 2006. ==Services== Variobahn tram ===National Rail=== National Rail services at Elmers End are operated by Southeastern. The typical off peak service in trains per hour is: * 2 tph to London Charing Cross * 2 tph to London Cannon Street via Lewisham * 4 tph to On Sundays, the service is reduced to 2 tph and runs between London Cannon Street and Hayes. ===London Trams=== London Trams also operate services at Elmers End. Trams run every 10 minutes Monday-Saturday and every 15 minutes on Sundays to Wimbledon via Croydon Town Centre. ==Connections== London Buses routes 54, 356 and 289 serve the station. ==See also== * Addiscombe Line * Woodside and South Croydon Railway ==Notes== == References == == External links == Category:Railway stations in the London Borough of Bromley Category:Former South Eastern Railway (UK) stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1864 Category:Railway stations served by Southeastern Category:Tramlink stops in the London Borough of Bromley ","title":"Elmers End station"},{"id":"1441348","text":"The Battle of Guìlíng (桂陵之戰) was fought between the states of Qí and Wei in the Warring States period of Chinese history. In 354 BC, an army from Wèi was laying siege to Handan, the capital of the State of Zhao. The next year, Zhao turned to Qi for help. Tian Ji and Sun Bin, acting as co-commanders of Qi, led an army to save Zhao. Sun Bin moves south intentionally to make an unsuccessful attack on Pingling, intending to convince Pang Juan that the Qi Army was too weak to achieve victory. Pang Juan, falling for the ruse, pooled more of his forces to besiege Handan. Although defeated, the Zhao Army fought desperately and suffered heavy losses to the Wei Army in the subsequent battle. After feigning defeat at Pingling, Sun Bin led his army directly to the Wei capital, Daliang. Wei scouts reported that the Qi Army had committed small groups to attack the city. Upon hearing the report, Wei general Pang Juan took his crack cavalry and left his infantry and supplies at Handan, making a mad dash in an attempt rescue Daliang. Pang Juan's troops were exhausted as they crossed the Yellow River and were ambushed and destroyed at Guiling by Sun's numerically superior army. Pang Juan managed to escape alone to Wei.

The museum originally opened in 1988 as the American Museum of the Moving Image. The museum began a $67 million expansion in March 2008 and reopened in January 2011. The expansion was designed by architect Thomas Leeser. ==Description== Exhibit in the museum The Museum of the Moving Image is focused on art, history, technique and technology of film, television, and digital media. It collects, preserves, and provides access to moving-image related artifacts via multimedia exhibitions and educational programming. The exhibits include significant audio/visual components designed to promote an understanding of the history of the industry and an understanding of how it has evolved. Panel discussions about current movies are frequently held at the museum. The museum hosts regular monthly series in its two premium theaters. These ongoing series include “Changing the Picture,” “Fist & Sword,” “New Adventures in Nonfiction,” “Science on Screen,” and “Disreputable Cinema.” Each of these explore and celebrate many aspects of the art and culture of cinema. It is also home to one of the most significant collections of video games and gaming hardware. The museum's attendance has grown from 60,000 in 2000 to an expected figure of 120,000 in 2011. In 2017, the museum opened “the Jim Henson Exhibition,” a permanent exhibit honoring the life and ingenuity of Jim Henson and his creations. Further, an exhibit entitled, \\"Envisioning 2001: Stanley Kubrick's Space Odyssey\\", opened in January 2020. ==History== In 1970, the Astoria Motion Picture and Television Center Foundation took control of the former Astoria Studios in an effort to preserve the now-landmarked building, which was home to a number of significant productions. The foundation's work revitalized the site and consumers' interest in the industry, and plans were made to expand the consumer access to the studio in the form of a museum. Following seven years of work, and at a cost of $15 million, the American Museum of the Moving Image opened on September 10, 1988, in the former East Coast home of Paramount Pictures as the first museum in the United States that was devoted solely to the art, history and technology of film, television and video. This was followed, days later, by the opening of the British museum of the same name. The New York theater, ultramodern by 1988 standards, was equipped to present 70mm, 35mm, and 16mm film formats and was one of only two sites in New York with the ability to present old nitrate prints. It also re-created moments from television and video history and allowed visitors the opportunity to watch television in a TV lounge from the early days of television. In 2005, the museum was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. In March 2008, the museum broke ground for a $65 million expansion that doubled the museum's size and added a new theater and educational space. While the museum remained open during most of the construction period, with its old theater demolished and the new ones yet to be built, screenings series and other events were held off site, although the collection was still available to scholars. The museum opened its redesigned and expanded building, designed by Leeser Architecture, on January 15, 2011. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1988 establishments in New York (state) Category:Astoria, Queens Category:Cinema museums in the United States Category:Cinema of New York City Category:Mass media museums in New York (state) Category:Museums established in 1988 Category:Museums in Queens, New York Category:Telecommunications museums in the United States Category:Television preservation ","title":"Museum of the Moving Image"},{"id":"1441358","text":"Lacus Somniorum (Latin somniōrum, \\"Lake of Dreams\\") is a plain located in the northeastern part of the Moon's near side. It is located at selenographic coordinates 38.0° N, 29.2° E, and has a diameter of 384 kilometers. (It is the largest of the lunar features designated Lacus.) The name is Latin for Lake of Dreams, a title given to this feature by Riccioli. Lacus Somniorum is an irregular feature with complex, somewhat ill-defined borders. The surface has the same low albedo as the larger lunar mare found on the Moon, and its surface was formed by flows of basaltic lava. To the southwest this plain is joined to the Mare Serenitatis through a wide gap northwest of the crater Posidonius. This crater forms the western end of the southern border, which extends eastward to about longitude 41° before turning northwest. Along this southern border is attached the flooded crater Hall, and a 150-km-long rille named the Rima G. Bond for the small crater G. Bond south of Hall. The irregular eastern border comes close to the small crater Maury before continuing to the north until it reaches the crater remnant Williams. From there the edge continues to the west. A narrow border region separates the Lacus Somniorum from the smaller Lacus Mortis to the north. This strip of rough terrain includes the flooded impact craters Mason and Plana. Finally the lake curves back to the south, joining a region of rough terrain along the northern border of the Mare Serenitatis. In the southern half of this border area lies a rille system designated the Rimae Daniell. These were named for the crater Daniell, a small formation north of Posidonius that is encircled by the Lacus Somniorum.

He served as a colonel of the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War and served as a New Hampshire delegate to the Confederation Congress in 1785 and 1786. Pierse was the son of an Irish immigrant (also Pierse) who had originally traded with Portsmouth merchants from Ireland. Around 1730, he moved to Portsmouth to open a store. In Portsmouth, Pierse Sr. married and had two daughters and a son, Pierse, who was born in 1739. He died only a year or two later. Young Pierse received a limited education, then was apprenticed to another merchant, Robert Trail. After his apprenticeship, Pierse became a merchant in his own right, exporting timber to the West Indies and importing goods from England and Ireland. He prospered in business and became active in the militia and in civic affairs. As the Revolution neared, he became a member of Portsmouth's Committee of Safety. In 1774, he participated in the raid that removed gunpowder from Fort William and Mary. The following year, the town sent him to the revolutionary Provincial Congress held at Exeter. As New Hampshire reorganized the militia in preparation for war, he was named colonel of the Continental Army regiment raised in New Castle, New Hampshire called Long's Regiment. During the Saratoga campaign of 1777, he led the bulk of his regiment in the withdrawal from Fort Ticonderoga. They successfully delayed the British at the Battle of Fort Ann on July 8. Very soon thereafter, their enlistment terms expired, and most of the regiment was discharged. Long and a few of his men fought as volunteers in the Battle of Saratoga as a part of Enoch Poor's brigade. But, by the end of the year, he returned home to Portsmouth. He was confined to his home for nearly half a year by illness before resuming his mercantile activities. In 1784, New Hampshire named him as a delegate to the Continental Congress. In congress, he was active in developing some of the proposals for dealing with western lands. While not passed at the time, many of these became part of the Northwest Ordinance in 1787. On his return to New Hampshire, he served on the state council from 1786 until 1789. He was a member of the State's convention that ratified the U.S. Constitution in 1788. Long died at home in Portsmouth on April 13, 1789 and is buried in the Proprietor's Burying Ground there. ==Sources== *State Builders: An Illustrated Historical and Biographical Record of the State of New Hampshire.

Speculative demand arises from the perception that money is optimally part of a portfolio of assets being held as investments. ==Overview== In economic theory, specifically Keynesian economics, speculative demand is one of the determinants of demand for money (and credit), the others being transactions demand and precautionary demand. Speculative demand is the holding of real balances for the purpose of avoiding capital loss from holding bonds or stocks. The net return on bonds is the sum of the interest payments and the capital gains (or losses) from their varying market value. A rise in interest rates causes aftermarket bond prices to fall, and that implies a capital loss from holding bonds. Accordingly, the return on bonds can be negative. Thus, people may hold money to avoid the loss from bonds. Money is thus treated as a form of asset for storing wealth. The asset demand for money is inversely related to the market interest rate. This is because at a lower interest rate, more people will expect a rise in the interest rate (and thus a fall in aftermarket bond prices). As a result, more people will hold their wealth in money rather than bonds, i.e. the speculative balances will be greater at a lower interest rate. It also depends on investors' aversion to risk, the relative demand for and the supply of other financial assets and real assets, and the change in expectations of the economic climate. == See also == *Demand for money ==External links== *An Overview of Speculative Demand in Real Estate Category:Keynesian economics Category:Demand Category:Financial markets Category:Demand for money ","title":"Speculative demand for money"},{"id":"1441378","text":"Count Gyula Andrássy de Csíkszentkirály et Krasznahorka the Younger (; 30 June 1860 – 11 June 1929) was a Hungarian politician. ==Biography== The second son of Count Gyula Andrássy and Countess Katinka Kendeffy, the younger Andrássy became under-secretary in the Sándor Wekerle ministry in 1892; in 1893, he became Minister of Education, and, in June 1894, he was appointed minister in attendance on the king, retiring in 1895 with Wekerle. In 1898, with his elder brother, he left the Liberal Party but returned to it after the fall of the Bánffy ministry. In 1905, he was one of the leaders of the Coalition which brought about the fall of the Liberal Tisza ministry. In 1906 he became Minister of the Interior in the compromise Wekerle cabinet and held that office until the fall of the ministry in 1909. In 1912, he represented Austria-Hungary in the diplomatic endeavor to prevent the outbreak of the Balkan War. In 1915, he urged peacemaking and an extension of the franchise in Hungary.

The combatants were the State of Qi, who fought on behalf of the State of Han, and the State of Wei. This battle is well recorded in history texts and is famous for the tactics of Sun Bin, known as the \\"Tactic of Missing Stoves\\", in which one side is led to underestimate the other by creating an illusion of soldiers running away from the army. Pang Juan, commander of Wei, was lured to a narrow pass at night, where his army was ambushed by 10,000 archers from Qi. According to some sources, Pang Juan committed suicide whilst others say he was killed by Qi archers. Wei was defeated and its power decreased significantly thereafter, making the state unable to compete for Kingship of the Zhou Dynasty. In 342 BC, the state of Wei attacked the state of Han, and Han turned to its ally Qi for help. Sun Bin advised King Wei of Qi to provide military aid for Han, but only send out troops when the army of Wei had been depleted after prolonged fighting in order to preserve their own strength whilst garnering respect from Han. Han was misled to believe that they could rely on the army of their ally Qi, and thus fought without reserve. After a year of resistance, Han was no longer able to resist and asked for help from Qi a second time. Instead of sending troops to save Han directly, Sun Bin suggested they should aim for the capital of Wei, Daliang. When King Hui of Wei learned of the attack, he had to order Wei General Pang Juan, to retreat in order to defend against the oncoming army of Qi. Pang Juan was incensed at the news, because he was only days away from taking the capital of Han. King Hui of Wei appointed Prince Shen of Wei as chief commander and Pang Juan as commander, and ordered an army of 100,000 to mobilize against Qi. Learning from the Battle of Guiling, Pang Juan ordered his troops to go around the Qi troops, to avoid getting ambushed on the main path. Pang Juan also ordered his troops to make haste to the capital, before Qi could set up any effective ambushes. Instead of rushing and trying to ambush the high morale Wei troops, Sun Bin decided to let a great majority of his troops rest. These Qi troops were ordered to move slowly back into Qi and prepare equipment for an ambush when needed. Sun Bin took a smaller force to face Pang Juan. Once the two forces drew close to each other, Sun Bin immediately ordered a retreat from Jin. In order to mislead his enemy, Sun Bin ordered his soldiers to make less stoves (cookfires) day by day. On the first day, Qi had enough stoves for 100,000 people; on the second day, there were stoves for only 50,000 people. On the third day, there were only stoves for an army of 20,000. As Pang Juan saw this, he judged that the soldiers of Qi were deserting their army and decided to pursue the Qi army with a small elite cavalry. This unit was overconfident following their recent victory in Han. As Qi retreated into their own territory, Sun Bin ordered his troops to abandon some of their heavy artillery. This further gave the impression of a state of confusion amongst the Qi army. As Qi arrived at Maling, Sun Bin noticed a heavily wooded and narrow pass that could be used for ambush. Estimating the arrival of Pang Juan around nightfall, he ordered his men to cut down a tree, remove its bark, and carve the words \\"Pang Juan shall die in Malingdao, under this tree\\" on its trunk. This was a proverb spoken by the teacher of both Sun Bin and Pang Juan (both had been in the same class). Pang Juan had moved to Malingdao, and when he saw the warning message, he paid no attention, instead ordering the words to be scraped off. The army advanced when suddenly, a flush of Qi troops surrounded the Wei. In the darkness, Qi archers managed to shoot down many of the Wei soldiers, before the rest of soldiers charged in. The Wei troops did not expect Qi to still have so many troops under their command and were quickly overrun. Pang Juan, sensing his end was near, committed suicide. In some versions, Pang Juan was among the first of his troops to be shot to death. Even though Pang Juan had tricked Sun Bin and maimed him by removing his knee caps, Sun Bin felt very sad to see his former classmate dead. He had hoped they would make their relationship better after the battle. After the death of Pang Juan, Prince Shen was captured by Qi. The power of the state of Wei decreased considerably after this battle. == Sources == * Records of the Grand Historian Sima Qian Category:342 BC Maling 342 BC Category:4th century BC in China Maling Category:History of Henan Category:Qi (state) Category:Wei (state) ","title":"Battle of Maling"},{"id":"1441387","text":"Memories of My Melancholy Whores () is a novella by Gabriel García Márquez.

An IFF is designed to frontload aid to help meet the Millennium Development Goals. Bonds are issued on global capital markets, against the security of government guarantees to maintain future aid flows, which would be used to buy back the bonds over a longer period. This allows a large amount of aid to flow soon, at the expense of less aid in the future. Critics have raised concerns that the poorest countries in particular don't have the ability to efficiently spend such large amounts of aid (whilst avoiding corruption), and that their economies may not be able to cope with such rapid change either. ==International Finance Facility for Immunisation== The first IFF is the \\"International Finance Facility for Immunisation\\" (IFFIm), begun by France, the UK and other European countries in 2006. IFFIm was initiated to rapidly accelerate the availability and predictability of funds for immunisation. IFFIm sells bonds - officially called Vaccine Bonds - on the capital markets to raise funds for the GAVI Alliance, a public-private partnership which works to save children’s lives and protect people’s health by increasing access to vaccination in developing countries. IFFIm is, as of July 2012, backed by the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Australia and South Africa. Brazil has pledged to become IFFIm's tenth donor. To date, IFFIm has leveraged US$6.3 billion in donor pledges to raise US$4.5 billion (July 2013) on the world’s capital markets from both retail and institutional investors. The World Bank is IFFIm's treasury manager. Since IFFIm began in 2006, IFFIm funding has allowed GAVI to nearly double its expenditures in health programmes. US$2.2 billion in IFFIm funding already has been disbursed to support vaccine purchase and delivery for 70 developing countries. Health care consulting firm HLSP issued an independent evaluation of IFFIm in July 2011 that strongly commended its financial model and health care results. The report noted that not only do IFFIm-funded investments generate “extremely good returns,” but also that it likely helped GAVI save more than 2.1 million lives. The report focused on IFFIm’s cost-effectiveness, particularly the benefits of frontloading and its impact on creating large-scale immunity. IFFIm provides certainty of funding for both GAVI and recipient countries, aiding long-term planning and short- term needs. For example, US$545 million in proceeds from IFFIm funded tactical purchases that helped prevent 1.4 million deaths from yellow fever, polio and measles. Dedicated IFFIm funding also played a significant role in combating 600,000 cases of meningitis and maternal and neonatal tetanus. In addition, IFFIm helped GAVI fund breakthrough vaccines quickly and securely. IFFIm financed more than 90% of the guaranteed payment to UNICEF for initial doses of a pentavalent vaccine which immunises against five infectious diseases: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) and hepatitis B. GAVI could not have made that commitment and upfront cash payment without IFFIm. ==External links== *HM Treasury: International Finance Facility *International Finance Facility for Immunisation Category:International development organizations ","title":"International Finance Facility"},{"id":"1441402","text":"The Cray-3/SSS (Super Scalable System) was a pioneering massively parallel supercomputer project that bonded a two-processor Cray-3 to a new SIMD processing unit based entirely in the computer's main memory.http://www.techagreements.com/agreement-preview.aspx?num=121632 CCC Annual return to end 1994http://www.secinfo.com/dsVQy.a1u4.htm CCC 10Q May 1995 It was later considered as an add-on for the Cray T90 series in the form of the T94/SSS, but there is no evidence this was ever built. ==Design== The SSS project started after a Supercomputing Research Center (SRC) engineer, Ken Iobst, noticed a novel way to implement a parallel computer. Previous massively SIMD designs, like the Connection Machines, consisted of a large number of individual processing elements consisting of a simple processor and some local memory. Results that needed to be passed from element to element were passed along networking links at relatively slow speeds. This was a serious bottleneck in most parallel designs, which limited their use to certain roles where these interdependencies could be reduced. Iobst's idea was to use the super-fast scatter/gather hardware from the Cray-3 to move the data around instead of using a separate network. This would offer at least an order of magnitudes better performance than systems based on \\"commodity\\" hardware. Better yet, the machine would still include a complete Cray-3 CPU, allowing the machine as a whole to use either SIMD or vector instructions depending on the particulars of the problem. Now all that remained was the selection of a processor. Since the Cray-3 already had a vector processor for heavy computing, the SIMD processors themselves could be considerably simpler, handling only the most basic instructions. This is where the SSS concept was truly unique; since the problem with most SIMD machines was moving data around, Iobst suggested that the processors be built into the SRAM chips themselves. Memory is normally organized within the RAM chips in a row/column format, with a controller on the chip reading requested data from the chip in parallel across the rows, then assembling the results into 32- or 64-bit words for processing by the CPU. In the SSS concept, the chips would also be equipped with a series of single-bit computers operating on a particular column of all the rows are at once—this meant that the processors could access data at very high speeds, about 100x as fast as normal. Add to this the speed of the \\"network\\" implemented by the scatter/gather hardware, and the system could be scaled to sizes considerably greater than existing SIMD systems. Each processor could accept two commands every 200 nanoseconds, for an effective cycle rate of 100 ns (10 MHz). A fully equipped system with 1,024,000 processors would have an aggregate processing capability of 32 TFlops.Ken Iobst et al, \\"Processing in Memory: The Terasys Massively Parallel PIM Array\\", Computer, Volume 28 Issue 4 (April 1995) ==Construction== In August 1994 the NSA contracted Cray Computer Corporation (CCC) to build a 512,000 processor design with 2,048 processors per RAM chip.Norris Parker Smith, \\"Seymour & NSA Revive SIMD as Thinking Machines Buried\\" , Supercomputing Review , 26 August 1994 National Semiconductor was selected to produce Iobst's design, where Mark Norder and Jennifer Schrader modified the design and laid it out for production.

It is home to a group of megalithic tombs dating back to the 4th millennium BC, which sit on top of a range of hills. The hills and tombs are together known as Slieve na Calliagh (Sliabh na Caillí)Slieve na Calliagh/Sliabh na Caillí. Placenames Database of Ireland. and are the highest point in Meath. It is deemed one of the four main passage tomb sites in Ireland and is a protected National Monument. The area is also home to the Loughcrew Estate, from which it is named. ==The tombs== The inner passage of Cairn T Loughcrew is one of the four main passage tomb sites in Ireland (the others are Brú na Bóinne, Carrowkeel and Carrowmore). The site is spread across four hilltops: Carnbane East, Carnbane West, Carrickbrack and Patrickstown. These hills and the tombs themselves are together known as Slieve na Calliagh or Sliabh na Caillí, meaning \\"mountain of the Cailleach\\", the divine hag of Irish mythology. Legend has it that the monuments were created when a giant hag, striding across the land, dropped her cargo of large stones from her apron. No comprehensive dating programme has been conducted there, but the monuments are estimated to date from about 3300 BC. The sites consist of cruciform chambers covered in most instances by a mound. A unique style of megalithic petroglyphs are seen there, including lozenge shapes, leaf shapes, as well as circles, some surrounded by radiating lines.photos of megalithic art in Cairn T from knowth.com The orthostats and structural stones of the monuments tend to be from local green gritstone, which was soft enough to carve.

Brennan also discovered alignments in Cairn L (), Knowth, and Dowth in the Boyne Valley. The Cairn T alignment is similar to the well-known illumination at the passage tomb at Brú na Bóinne (Newgrange), which is aligned to catch the rays of the winter solstice sunrise. There are about twenty-three tombs in the Loughcrew complex in addition to Cairn L and Cairn T, along with additional archeological sites. ==Modern history== In more recent centuries Loughcrew became the seat of a branch of the Norman-Irish Plunkett family, whose most famous member became the martyred St Oliver Plunkett. The family church stands in the grounds of Loughcrew Gardens. With its barren isolated location, Sliabh na Caillí became a critical meeting point throughout the Penal Laws for Roman Catholics. Even though the woods are now gone an excellent example of a Mass Rock can still be seen on the top of Sliabh na Caillí today. The Plunketts were involved in running the Irish Confederacy of the 1640s and were dispossessed in the Cromwellian Settlement of 1652. Their estate at Loughcrew was assigned by Sir William Petty to the Naper Family c.1655. The Napers are descended from Sir Robert Napier who was Chief Baron of the Exchequer of Ireland in 1593.Bunbury, Turtle (2003, 2006) \\"Loughcrew House, Co. Meath - Gilded Magnificence\\" The Napers built an extensive estate of some 180,000 acres (730 km²) in north Meath in the subsequent centuries which mirrored that developed by their neighbouring Cromwellians, the Taylors of Headfort. Following a third and devastating fire, in 1964, the three Naper sons went to court and requested that the state allow the family trust to be broken up and the estate divided between the three sons. Subsequently the house and gardens have been restored by Charles and Emily Naper, who open the gardens and run an annual opera festival.Lyttelton, Celia (May 2009) \\"Interiors: aria condition,\\" Telegraph, UK. ==See also== * Archaeoastronomy * List of archaeoastronomical sites by country * List of megalithic monuments in Ireland ==References== ==External links== * Loughcrew at Voices from the Dawn * Art and astronomy at Loughcrew * Loughcrew Information and Images * Details of how to obtain access to the interior of Cairn T * From http://www.mythicalireland.com * A Visit to Loughcrew Megalithic Complex * Loughcrew on video * Loughcrew Megalithic Centre * Loughcrew Estate * Loughcrew Adventure Centre Category:Archaeological sites in County Meath Category:Mountains and hills of County Meath Category:National Monuments in County Meath Category:4th-millennium BC architecture ","title":"Loughcrew"},{"id":"1441413","text":"The Center for Architecture The Center for Architecture hosting an exhibit on \\"Building China\\" A number of partner organizations are housed at the Center for Architecture.

The Center for Architecture opened to the public in October 2003. ==Geothermal system== In the summer of 2003, the geothermal system for the Center for Architecture was installed. For three weeks, construction crews drilled two wells, each 1,260 feet (~ 384m) deep beneath the sidewalk. After drilling through layers or gravel, pea stone, overburden soil and bedrock, the wells were connected to make a closed loop system. The geothermal system consists of pipes, heat exchangers and pumps for groundwater to flow through. The geothermal system cools the Center for Architecture during warm weather and heats it during the cold months by circulating water through heat exchangers. The system is based on the fact that the earth's temperature at a thousand feet below Manhattan is a constant . The heat exchangers use the temperature of the water to cool (or heat as demand requires) the air released into the facility through air ducts.

In ancient times, a span was considered to be half a cubit. Sometimes the distinction is made between the great span (thumb to little finger) and little span (thumb to index finger, or index finger to little finger). ==History== Ancient Greek texts show that the span was used as a fixed measure in ancient Greece since at least archaic period. The word spithame (Greek: \\"σπιθαμή\\"), \\"span\\",σπιθαμή, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library is attested in the work of HerodotusHerodotus, The Histories, 2.106, on Perseus Digital Library in the 5th century BC; however, the span was used in Greece long before that, since the word trispithamos (Greek: \\"τρισπίθαμος\\"), \\"three spans long\\",τρισπίθαμος, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library occurs as early as the 8th century BC in Hesiod. Hesiod, Works and Days, 426, on Perseus Digital Library ==Size of the span== ===English usage=== See also: English unit ; 1 span := 9 inches := 0.2286 m ===Arabic usage=== In Arabic, the analogue of the great span is the šibr (شبر). It is used in Modern Standard Arabic and classical Arabic, as well as in modern-day dialects. ===Slavic usage=== In Slavic languages, the analogue of the span is various words derived from Proto-Slavic *pędь (Bulgarian педя, Polish piędź, Russian пядь, Slovenian ped, etc.). In various Slavic languages it is the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger or index finger. For example, Slovenian velika ped = great span (23 cm), mala ped = little span (9.5 cm); Russian piad = 4 vershoks = 17.8 cm. See Obsolete Russian weights and measures. ===African usage=== In Swahili, the equivalent of the great span (thumb to little finger) is the shubiri or shibiri while the little span (thumb to forefinger) is the morita or futuri. ===Hungarian usage=== In Hungarian, the span, or arasz, is occasionally used as an informal measure and occurs in two varieties: measured between the tips of the extended thumb and index finger, it is kis arasz (the \\"small arasz\\"); between the tips of the thumb and little finger, it is nagy arasz (the \\"large arasz\\"). The term \\"arasz,\\" used by itself without a modifier, is usually understood as referring to the \\"large arasz,\\" i.e., to the \\"span.\\" ===Asian usage=== In Hindi-Urdu and other languages of Northern India and Pakistan, the span is commonly used as an informal measure and called bālisht (Urdu: بالشت, Hindi: बालिश्त).Norman Lockyer, \\"Nature,\\" Nature Publishing Group, Macmillan Journals Ltd., 1922. In Marathi, it's called “Weet” /वीत“. In Malay, it is called \\"jengkal\\". In Nepal, where this method of measurement is still used in informal context, a span is called Bhitta. In Tamil, it is called \\"saaN\\". In Thai, it's called Khuep. ===Mongolian usage=== It's commonly used as traditional and informal measure. In Mongolia, the span is called as tuu (төө). Depending on the use of index or middle finger and the placement of the thumb, the span is named differently as tuu (төө) and mukhar tuu (мухар төө) etc. ===Portuguese usage=== The old Portuguese customary unit analogue to the span was the palmo de craveira or simply palmo. ; 1 palmo de craveira := 8 polegadas (Portuguese inches) := 1/5 varas (Portuguese yards) := 0.22 m ==See also== *Anthropic units *Hand (unit) * List of unusual units of measurement *Units of measure ==Notes== ==References== *Lyle V.

According to the Einstein field equation, this means that the stress–energy tensor also vanishes identically, so that no matter or non-gravitational fields are present. These are distinct from the electrovacuum solutions, which take into account the electromagnetic field in addition to the gravitational field. Vacuum solutions are also distinct from the lambdavacuum solutions, where the only term in the stress–energy tensor is the cosmological constant term (and thus, the lambdavacuums can be taken as cosmological models). More generally, a vacuum region in a Lorentzian manifold is a region in which the Einstein tensor vanishes. Vacuum solutions are a special case of the more general exact solutions in general relativity. ==Equivalent conditions== It is a mathematical fact that the Einstein tensor vanishes if and only if the Ricci tensor vanishes. This follows from the fact that these two second rank tensors stand in a kind of dual relationship; they are the trace reverse of each other: :G_{ab} = R_{ab} - \\\\frac{R}{2} \\\\, g_{ab}, \\\\; \\\\; R_{ab} = G_{ab} - \\\\frac{G}{2} \\\\, g_{ab} where the traces are R = {R^a}_a, \\\\; \\\\; G = {G^a}_a = -R. A third equivalent condition follows from the Ricci decomposition of the Riemann curvature tensor as a sum of the Weyl curvature tensor plus terms built out of the Ricci tensor: the Weyl and Riemann tensors agree, R_{abcd}=C_{abcd}, in some region if and only if it is a vacuum region. ==Gravitational energy== Since T^{ab} = 0 in a vacuum region, it might seem that according to general relativity, vacuum regions must contain no energy. But the gravitational field can do work, so we must expect the gravitational field itself to possess energy, and it does. However, determining the precise location of this gravitational field energy is technically problematical in general relativity, by its very nature of the clean separation into a universal gravitational interaction and \\"all the rest\\". The fact that the gravitational field itself possesses energy yields a way to understand the nonlinearity of the Einstein field equation: this gravitational field energy itself produces more gravity. This means that the gravitational field outside the Sun is a bit stronger according to general relativity than it is according to Newton's theory. ==Examples== Well known examples of explicit vacuum solutions include: *Minkowski spacetime (which describes empty space with no cosmological constant) *Milne model (which is a model developed by E. A. Milne describing an empty universe which has no curvature) *Schwarzschild vacuum (which describes the spacetime geometry around a spherical mass), *Kerr vacuum (which describes the geometry around a rotating object), *Taub-NUT vacuum (a famous counterexample describing the exterior gravitational field of an isolated object with strange properties), *Kerns–Wild vacuum (Robert M. Kerns and Walter J. Wild 1982) (a Schwarzschild object immersed in an ambient \\"almost uniform\\" gravitational field), *double Kerr vacuum (two Kerr objects sharing the same axis of rotation, but held apart by unphysical zero active mass \\"cables\\" going out to suspension points infinitely removed), *Khan–Penrose vacuum (K. A. Khan and Roger Penrose 1971) (a simple colliding plane wave model), *Oszváth–Schücking vacuum (the circularly polarized sinusoidal gravitational wave, another famous counterexample). *Kasner metric (An anisotropic solution, used to study gravitational chaos in three or more dimensions). These all belong to one or more general families of solutions: *the Weyl vacua (Hermann Weyl) (the family of all static vacuum solutions), *the Beck vacua (Guido Beck 1925) (the family of all cylindrically symmetric nonrotating vacuum solutions), *the Ernst vacua (Frederick J. Ernst 1968) (the family of all stationary axisymmetric vacuum solutions), *the Ehlers vacua (Jürgen Ehlers) (the family of all cylindrically symmetric vacuum solutions), *the Szekeres vacua (George Szekeres) (the family of all colliding gravitational plane wave models), *the Gowdy vacua (Robert H. Gowdy) (cosmological models constructed using gravitational waves), Several of the families mentioned here, members of which are obtained by solving an appropriate linear or nonlinear, real or complex partial differential equation, turn out to be very closely related, in perhaps surprising ways.

The main centres of production were London, Bristol and Liverpool with smaller centres at Wincanton, Glasgow and Dublin. English tin- glazed pottery was called \\"galleyware\\" or \\"galliware\\" and its makers \\"gallypotters\\" until the early 18th century; it was given the name delftware after the tin-glazed pottery from the Netherlands,Garner, F.H., English Delftware, Faber and Faber, 1948Carnegy, Daphne, Tin-glazed Earthenware, A&C; Black/Chilton Book Company, 1993, which it often copied, but \\"delftware\\" is not usually capitalized. Many everyday wares were made: tiles, mugs, drug jars, dishes, wine bottles, posset pots, salt pots, candlesticks, fuddling cups (that is, ale mugs joined in groups of three, four or five with connecting holes to confuse the drinker), puzzle jugs (similar to fuddling cups), barber's bowls, pill slabs, bleeding bowls, porringers and flower bricks. Humble undecorated items included chamberpots, colanders and small disposable ointment pots (gallipots), dispensed by apothecaries. Large decorative dishes, often called chargers, were popular, and included much of the most ambitious painting, often stretching the artists to the edge of their capabilities, and beyond. ==The nature of English delftware== English delftware pottery and its painted decoration is similar in many respects to that from Holland, but its peculiarly English quality has been commented upon: \\"... there is a relaxed tone and a sprightliness which is preserved throughout the history of English delftware; the overriding mood is provincial and naïve rather than urbane and sophisticated.\\" Caiger-Smith describes its mood as \\"ingenuous, direct, sometimes eccentric\\"; and Garner talks of its \\"quite distinctive character\\". Its methods and techniques were simpler than those of its continental counterparts. English tin-glaze potters rarely used the transparent overglaze applied by the more sophisticated Dutch and Italian potters. The enamels so popular on the continent in the 18th century were used only for a short time at Liverpool, where the so-called Fazackerly wares were made. ==Early wares== An English delftware jug has been found in East Malling, Kent, with a silver mount hallmarked 1550, which is presumed to be the earliest date of manufacture. (Malling jugs may be seen in the Museum of London and the Victoria and Albert Museum.) John Stow's Survey of London (1598) records the arrival in 1567 of two Antwerp potters, Jasper Andries and Jacob Jansen, in Norwich, where they made \\"Gally Paving Tiles, and vessels for Apothecaries and others, very artificially\\".Caiger-Smith, Alan, Tin-glazed Pottery in Europe and the Islamic World: The Tradition of 1000 Years in Maiolica, Faience and Delftware, Faber and Faber, 1973, In 1570 Jansen applied to Queen Elizabeth I for the sole right to practice \\"galleypotting\\" in London and soon set up a workshop at Aldgate to the east of the city. There were already other Flemish potters in London, two of them in Southwark recorded in 1571 as \\"painters of pottes\\". The earliest known piece with an English inscription is a dish dated 1600 in the Museum of London. It is painted in blue, purple, green, orange and yellow and depicts the Tower of London and Old London Bridge, surrounded by the words, \\"THE ROSE IS RED THE LEAVES ARE GRENE GOD SAVE ELIZABETH OUR QUEENE\\" and an Italianate border of masks and leaves. The rim is decorated with dashes of blue and can be considered the first in series of large decorated dishes so painted and called blue-dash chargers. ==Blue-dash chargers== Two chargers with William III of England Blue-dash chargers, usually between about 25 and 35 cm in diameter with abstract, floral, religious, patriotic or topographical motifs, were produced in quantity by London and Bristol potters until the early 18th century. As they were kept for decoration on walls, dressers and side-tables, many have survived and they are well represented in museum collections. Their name comes from the slanting blue dashes round the rim, seen in both examples at the left.Poole, 26 One of the most popular decorations on the blue-dash charger was a representation of Adam and Eve with the serpent in the Garden of Eden, produced from the 1630s to the 1730s. \\"The challenge of rendering the anatomy of Adam and Eve was inescapable, and as the subject became more and more freely repeated by painters of less and less competence, most of the anatomy gave trouble, particularly Adam's abdominal muscles, which eventually became grotesque and could not be wholly covered by his fig-leaf.\\" In later examples, \\"the images had declined to the level of coloured graffiti; Adam and Eve were cave dwellers, the Tree had become a mere cipher and only the serpent and the fruit proved simple enough to survive debasement.\\" ==Later wares== Chinoiserie bowl, Lambeth Pottery, c. 1760 Towards the end of the 17th changing taste led to the replacement of apothecary pots, tiles and large dishes by polite tablewares, delicate ornaments, punch bowls, teapots, cocoa pots and coffee-pots. The decoration became lighter and more informal. Changing taste was also reflected in chinoiserie decoration and greater use of a polychrome palette. In Bristol and Lambeth from the mid-18th century there was much use of a technique imported from Italy, bianco sopra bianco (white- on-white). The object was covered in a tin-glaze tinted with a small amount of colouring oxide, with decoration over it in white tin-glaze. The development of creamware, a very white and tough earthenware, by Wedgwood and other North Staffordshire potters spelled the end of English delftware. Decoration could be applied to the bisque ware from printed transfers, white pottery could be produced with a clear lead-glaze, and the result was pottery lighter and more durable than tin-glazed ware. The north Staffordshire potteries also introduced new wares and industrial techniques that disadvantaged the delftware makers,Poole, 2, 54, 74-88 and by the 19th century tin-glazed earthenware almost died out until its revival in the form of art pottery a hundred years later. ==Collections== There are good examples of English delftware in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, the Ashmolean Museum and the Fitzwilliam Museum. ==References== *Poole, Julia, English Pottery (Fitzwilliam Museum Handbooks), 1995, Cambridge University Press, *Dawson, Aileen, English & Irish Delftware, 1570-1840, 2010, London: British Museum, delftware delftware ","title":"English delftware"},{"id":"1441480","text":"Lombardi is an Italian surname, often held by the descendants of migrants from Lombardy and Northern Italy. * Alberto Lombardi (1893–1975), Italian Olympic equestrian * Armando Lombardi (1905–1964), archbishop and Vatican diplomat * Dean Lombardi (born 1958), president and general manager of the NHL's Los Angeles Kings * Ernie Lombardi (1908–1977), Major League Baseball player * Federico Lombardi S.J.

In 1959, Woluwe FC left the Stade Fallon to play in Kapelleveld in a stadium located Avenue Albert Dumonlaan.

After consulting with Alfred Vulpian and Jacques-Joseph Grancher and obtaining their assistance, Louis Pasteur agreed to inoculate the boy with spinal tissue from rabid rabbits, which he had successfully used to prevent rabies in dogs.

The current version of WSGI, version 1.0.1, is specified in Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 3333. WSGI was originally specified as PEP-333 in 2003. PEP-3333, published in 2010, updates the specification for Python 3. ==Background== In 2003, Python web frameworks were typically written against only CGI, FastCGI, mod_python, or some other custom API of a specific web server. To quote PEP 333: > Python currently boasts a wide variety of web application frameworks, such > as Zope, Quixote, Webware, SkunkWeb, PSO, and Twisted Web -- to name just a > few. This wide variety of choices can be a problem for new Python users, > because generally speaking, their choice of web framework will limit their > choice of usable web servers, and vice versa... By contrast, although Java > has just as many web application frameworks available, Java's \\"servlet\\" API > makes it possible for applications written with any Java web application > framework to run in any web server that supports the servlet API. WSGI was thus created as an implementation-agnostic interface between web servers and web applications or frameworks to promote common ground for portable web application development. ==Specification overview== The WSGI has two sides: * the server/gateway side. This is often running full web server software such as Apache or Nginx, or is a lightweight application server that can communicate with a webserver, such as flup. * the application/framework side. This is a Python callable, supplied by the Python program or framework. Between the server and the application, there may be one or more WSGI middleware components, which implement both sides of the API, typically in Python code. WSGI does not specify how the Python interpreter should be started, nor how the application object should be loaded or configured, and different frameworks and webservers achieve this in different ways. == WSGI middleware == A WSGI middleware component is a Python callable that is itself a WSGI application, but may handle requests by delegating to other WSGI applications. These applications can themselves be WSGI middleware components. A middleware component can perform such functions as: * Routing a request to different application objects based on the target URL, after changing the environment variables accordingly. * Allowing multiple applications or frameworks to run side-by-side in the same process * Load balancing and remote processing, by forwarding requests and responses over a network * Performing content post-processing, such as applying XSLT stylesheets ==Examples== ===Example application=== A WSGI-compatible \\"Hello, World\\" application written in Python: def application(environ, start_response): start_response('200 OK', [('Content-Type', 'text/plain')]) yield b'Hello, World ' Where: * Line 1 defines a functioni.e. \\"a function, method, class, or an instance with a \`__call__\` method\\" named \`application\`, which takes two parameters, \`environ\` and \`start_response\`. \`environ\` is a dictionary containing CGI environment variables as well as other request parameters and metadata under well-defined keys. \`start_response\` is a callable itself, taking two positional parameters, \`status\` and \`response_headers\`. * Line 2 calls \`start_response\`, specifying \\"200 OK\\" as the HTTP status and a \\"Content-Type\\" response header. * Line 3 makes the function into a generator. The body of the response is returned as an iterable of byte strings. ===Example of calling an application=== A full example of a WSGI network server is outside the scope of this article. Below is a sketch of how one would call a WSGI application and retrieve its HTTP status line, response headers, and response body, as Python objects. Details of how to construct the \`environ\` dict have been omitted. from io import BytesIO def call_application(app, environ): status = None headers = None body = BytesIO() def start_response(rstatus, rheaders): nonlocal status, headers status, headers = rstatus, rheaders app_iter = app(environ, start_response) try: for data in app_iter: assert status is not None and headers is not None, \\\\ \\"start_response() was not called\\" body.write(data) finally: if hasattr(app_iter, 'close'): app_iter.close() return status, headers, body.getvalue() environ = {...} # \\"environ\\" dict status, headers, body = call_application(app, environ) ==WSGI-compatible applications and frameworks== Numerous web frameworks support WSGI: * bjoern * BlueBream * bobo * Bottle * CherryPy * Django * Eventlet * Flask * Falcon (web framework) * Gevent-FastCGI * Google App Engine's webapp2 * Gunicorn * prestans * mod_wsgi for use with Apache * netius * pycnic * Paste component WebOb is specifically a WSGI extension.

It was a product of the disciplines of plant physiology and botany. ==Overview== Phytotrons unified and extended earlier piecemeal efforts to claim total control of the whole environment. In both walk-in rooms and smaller reach-in cabinets, phytotrons produced and reproduced whole complex climates of many variables. In the first phytotrons each individual room was held at a constant unique temperature. The Australian phytotron, for example, had rooms maintaining 9°C, 12°C, 16°C, 20°C, 23°C, 26°C, 30°C, 34°C. Because some of the earliest controlled environment experiments showed that plants reacted differently in daytime temperatures and nighttime temperatures, the first experiments to observe the effect(s) of varying the daytime versus the nighttime temperature saw experimenters move their plants from higher to lower temperatures over the course of a daily, or any other variable or constant, routine. This rendered the variable “temperature” experimentally controllable. Even a brute force approach that tested each successive environmental variable and every variety of plant would serve to pinpoint specific environmental conditions to maximize growth. Expecting that more knowledge would surely come from greater technology, the next generation of phytotrons expanded in technological reach, in their ranges of environmental variables, and also in the degree of control over each variable. The phytotron in Stockholm offered a humidity controlled room and a custom built computer, as well as a low temperature room that extended the temperature range down to -25°C for the study of Nordic forests. After that, phytotron technology compressed whole environments into smaller cabinets able to be set to any desired combination of environmental conditions, which are still in use today. The first phytotron was built under the direction of Frits Warmolt Went at the California Institute of Technology in 1949. It was funded by the Harry B. Earhart Foundation, and was officially known as the Earhart Plant Research Laboratory. It acquired its more distinctive nickname evidently from a joking conversation between Caltech biologists James Bonner and Sam Wildman. Recalling the origin sometime in 1980s Bonner noted that: \\"The Earhart Plant Research Laboratory [was] called an environmentally controlled greenhouse but my first postdoctoral fellow [Sam Wildman] and I, sitting around about 1950, having coffee, decided it deserved a better or more euphonious name [...]. We decided to call it a phytotron—phytos from the Greek word for plant, and tron as in cyclotron, a big complicated machine. Went was originally enormously annoyed by this word. But Dr. Millikan took it right up saying, ‘this edifice financed by Mr. Earhart, is going to do for plant biology what the cyclotron has done for physics,’ and he christened it a phytotron.\\"James Bonner.

Retrieved Jan 5, 2014 from the World Wide Web: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechOH:OH_Bonner_J, p. 17-18. A similar account was given by Bonner in response to a query by George Beadle about the origin of “phytotron.” As Bonner told him, “at a morning coffee session in the old Greasy Spoon at Caltech […] Sam and I started out with the hypothesis that anything as fancy as the proposed Earhart Laboratory shouldn’t be called an air-conditioned greenhouse or anything simple like that, but should have a more magnificent name. We ended up with “thermophotophytotron” but quickly slimmed it down to “phytotron.” Letter from Bonner to Beadle. Sept 9, 1970. James Bonner papers. File 20.1. Archives. California Institute of Technology. Phytotrons spread around the world between 1945 and the present day to Australia, France, Hungary, the Soviet Union, England, and the United States. Moreover, they have spurred variants such as the Climatron at the Missouri Botanical Garden, the Biotron at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Ecotron at Imperial College London and the Brisatron at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory. ==See also== * Biotron ==References== * David P.D.

In some cases \\"objects\\" can be concretely thought of as symbols and strings of symbols, here illustrated by a string of four symbols \\" ←←↑↓←→←↓\\" as composed from the 4-symbol alphabet { ←, ↑, →, ↓ } . When they are \\"known only through the relationships of the system [in which they appear], the system is [said to be] abstract ... what the objects are, in any respect other than how they fit into the structure, is left unspecified.\\" (Kleene 1952:25) A further specification of the objects results in a model or representation of the abstract system, \\"i.e. a system of objects which satisfy the relationships of the abstract system and have some further status as well\\" (ibid). A system, in its general sense, is a collection of objects O = {o1, o2, ... on, ... } and (a specification of) the relationship r or relationships r1, r2, ... rn between the objects. : Example: Given a simple system = { { ←, ↑, →, ↓ }, ∫ } for a very simple relationship between the objects as signified by the symbol ∫:Abstractly, the relationship ∫ is defined by the collection of ordered pairs { ( →, ↑ ), ( ↑, ← ), ( ←, ↓ ), (↓, →) } :: ∫→ => ↑, ∫↑ => ←, ∫← => ↓, ∫↓ => → A model of this system would occur when we assign, for example the familiar natural numbers { 0, 1, 2, 3 }, to the symbols { ←, ↑, →, ↓ }, i.e. in this manner: → = 0, ↑ = 1, ← = 2, ↓ = 3 . Here, the symbol ∫ indicates the \\"successor function\\" (often written as an apostrophe ' to distinguish it from +) operating on a collection of only 4 objects, thus 0' = 1, 1' = 2, 2' = 3, 3' = 0. :Or, we might specify that ∫ represents 90-degree counter-clockwise rotations of a simple object → . == The genetic versus axiomatic method == The following is an example of the genetic or constructive method of making objects in a system, the other being the axiomatic or postulational method. Kleene states that a genetic method is intended to \\"generate\\" all the objects of the system and thereby \\"determine the abstract structure of the system completely\\" and uniquely (and thus define the system categorically). If axioms rather than a genetic method is used, such axiom-sets are said to be categorical.Kleene 1952:26. This distinction between the constructive and axiomatic methods, and the words used to describe them, are Kleene's per his reference to Hilbert 1900. Unlike the ∫ example above, the following creates an unbounded number of objects. The fact that O is a set, and □ is an element of O, and ■ is an operation, must be specified at the outset; this is being done in the language of the metatheory (see below): : Given the system ( O, □, ■ ): O = { □, ■□, ■■□, ■■■□, ■■■■□, ■■■■■□, ..., ■n□, etc. } == Abbreviations == The object ■n□ demonstrates the use of \\"abbreviation\\", a way to simplify the denoting of objects, and consequently discussions about them, once they have been created \\"officially\\". Done correctly the definition would proceed as follows: ::: ■□ ≡ ■1□, ■■□ ≡ ■2□, ■■■□ ≡ ■3□, etc, where the notions of ≡ (\\"defined as\\") and \\"number\\" are presupposed to be understood intuitively in the metatheory. Kurt Gödel 1931 virtually constructed the entire proof of his incompleteness theorems (actually he proved Theorem IV and sketched a proof of Theorem XI) by use of this tactic, proceeding from his axioms using substitution, concatenation and deduction of modus ponens to produce a collection of 45 \\"definitions\\" (derivations or theorems more accurately) from the axioms. A more familiar tactic is perhaps the design of subroutines that are given names, e.g. in Excel the subroutine \\" =INT(A1)\\" that returns to the cell where it is typed (e.g. cell B1) the integer it finds in cell A1. ==Models== A model of the above example is a left-ended Post–Turing machine tape with its fixed \\"head\\" located on the left-end square; the system's relation is equivalent to: \\"To the left end, tack on a new square □, right-shift the tape, then print ■ on the new square\\". Another model is the natural numbers as created by the \\"successor\\" function. Because the objects in the two systems e.g. ( □, ■□, ■■□, ■■■□ ... ) and (0, 0′, 0′′, 0′′′, ...) can be put into a 1-1 correspondence, the systems are said to be (simply) isomorphic (meaning \\"same shape\\"). Yet another isomorphic model is the little sequence of instructions for a counter machine e.g. \\"Do the following in sequence: (1) Dig a hole. (2) Into the hole, throw a pebble. (3) Go to step 2.\\" As long as their objects can be placed in one-to-one correspondence (\\"while preserving the relationships\\") models can be considered \\"equivalent\\" no matter how their objects are generated (e.g. genetically or axiomatically): :\\"Any two simply isomorphic systems constitute representations [models] of the same abstract system, which is obtained by abstracting from either of them, i.e. by leaving out of account all relationships and properties except the ones to be considered for the abstract system.\\" (Kleene 1935:25) == Tacit assumptions, tacit knowledge == An alert reader may have noticed that writing symbols □, ■□, ■■□, ■■■□, etc. by concatenating a marked square, i.e. ■, to an existing string is different from writing the completed symbols one after another on a Turing-machine tape. Another entirely possible scenario would be to generate the symbol-strings one after another on different sections of tape e.g. after three symbols: ■■■□■■□■□□. The proof that these two possibilities are different is easy: they require different \\"programs\\". But in a sense both versions create the same objects; in the second case the objects are preserved on the tape. In the same way, if a person were to write 0, then erase it, write 1 in the same place, then erase it, write 2, erase it, ad infinitum, the person is generating the same objects as if they were writing down 0 1 2 3 ... writing one symbol after another to the right on the paper. Once the step has been taken to write down the symbols 3 2 1 0 one after another on a piece of paper (writing the new symbol on the left this time), or writing ∫∫∫※∫∫※∫※※ in a similar manner, then putting them in 1-1 correspondence with the Turing-tape symbols seems obvious. Digging holes one after the other, starting with a hole at \\"the origin\\", then a hole to its left with one pebble in it, then a hole to its left with two pebbles in it, ad infinitum, raises practical questions, but in the abstract it too can be seen to be conducive to the same 1-1 correspondence. However, nothing in particular in the definition of genetic versus axiomatic methods clears this up—these are issues to be discussed in the metatheory. The mathematician or scientist is to be held responsible for sloppy specifications. Breger cautions that axiomatic methods are susceptible to tacit knowledge, in particular, the sort that involves \\"know-how of a human being\\" (Breger 2000:227). == A formal system == In general, in mathematics a formal system or \\"formal theory\\" consists of \\"objects\\" in a structure: * The symbols to be concatenated (adjoined), * The formation-rules (completely specified, i.e. formal rules of syntax) that dictate how the symbols and the assemblies of symbols are to be formed into assemblies (e.g. sequences) of symbols (called terms, formulas, sentences, propositions, theorems, etc.) so that they are in \\"well-formed\\" patterns (e.g. can a symbol be concatenated at its left end only, at its right end only, or both ends simultaneously? Can a collection of symbols be substituted for (put in place of) one or more symbols that may appear anywhere in the target symbol-string?), * Well-formed \\"propositions\\" (called \\"theorems\\" or assertions or sentences) assembled per the formation rules, * A few axioms that are stated up front and may include \\"undefinable notions\\" (examples: \\"set\\", \\"element\\", \\"belonging\\" in set theory; \\"0\\" and \\" ' \\" (successor) in number theory), * At least one rule of deductive inference (e.g. modus ponens) that allow one to pass from one or more of the axioms and/or propositions to another proposition. == Informal theory, object theory, and metatheory == A metatheory exists outside the formalized object theory—the meaningless symbols and relations and (well-formed-) strings of symbols. The metatheory comments on (describes, interprets, illustrates) these meaningless objects using \\"intuitive\\" notions and \\"ordinary language\\". Like the object theory, the metatheory should be disciplined, perhaps even quasi- formal itself, but in general the interpretations of objects and rules are intuitive rather than formal. Kleene requires that the methods of a metatheory (at least for the purposes of metamathematics) be finite, conceivable, and performable; these methods cannot appeal to the completed infinite. \\"Proofs of existence shall give, at least implicitly, a method for constructing the object which is being proved to exist.\\"This is an intuitionist requirement: It formally proscribes the use of the law of excluded middle over infinite collections (sets) of objects. (p. 64) Kleene summarizes this as follows: \\"In the full picture there will be three separate and distinct \\"theories\\"\\" :\\"(a) the informal theory of which the formal system constitutes a formalization :\\"(b) the formal system or object theory, and :\\"(c) the metatheory, in which the formal system is described and studied\\" (p. 65) He goes on to say that object theory (b) is not a \\"theory\\" in the conventional sense, but rather is \\"a system of symbols and of objects built from symbols (described from (c))\\". == Expansion of the notion of formal system == === Well-formed objects === If a collection of objects (symbols and symbol-sequences) is to be considered \\"well-formed\\", an algorithm must exist to determine, by halting with a \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" answer, whether or not the object is well-formed (in mathematics a wff abbreviates well-formed formula). This algorithm, in the extreme, might require (or be) a Turing machine or Turing-equivalent machine that \\"parses\\" the symbol-string as presented as \\"data\\" on its tape; before a universal Turing machine can execute an instruction on its tape, it must parse the symbols to determine the exact nature of the instruction and/or datum encoded there. In simpler cases a finite state machine or a pushdown automaton can do the job. Enderton describes the use of \\"trees\\" to determine whether or not a logic formula (in particular a string of symbols with parentheses) is well formed.Enderton 2002:30 Alonzo Church 1934Church 1934 reprinted in Davis 1965:88ff describes the construction of \\"formulas\\" (again: sequences of symbols) as written in his λ-calculus by use of a recursive description of how to start a formula and then build on the starting-symbol using concatenation and substitution. Example: Church specified his λ-calculus as follows (the following is simplified version leaving out notions of free- and bound- variable). This example shows how an object theory begins with a specification of an object system of symbols and relations (in particular by use of concatenation of symbols): :(1) Declare the symbols: {, }, (, ), λ, [, ] plus an infinite number of variables a, b, c, ..., x, ... :(2) Define formula: a sequence of symbols :(3) Define the notion of \\"well-formed formula\\" (wff) recursively starting with the \\"basis\\" (3.i): :*(3.1) (basis) A variable x is a wff :*(3.2) If F and X are wffs, then {F}(X) is a wff; if x occurs in F or X then it is said to be a variable in {F}(X). :*(3.3) If M is well-formed and x occurs in M then λx[M] is a wff. :(4) Define various abbreviations: :* {F}[X] abbreviates to F(X) if F is a single symbol :* {{F}[X]}[Y] abbreviates to {F}(X,Y) or F(X,Y) if F is a single symbol :* λx1λx2[...λxn[M]...] abbreviates to λx1x2...xn•M :* λab•a(b) abbreviates to 1 :* λab•a(a(b)) abbreviates to 2, etc. :(5) Define the notion of \\"substitution\\" of formula N for variable x throughout MThe substitution gets complicated and requires more information (e.g. definitions of \\"free-\\" and \\"bound-\\" variables and three varieties of substitution) than has been given in this brief example. (Church 1936) === Undefined (primitive) objects === Certain objects may be \\"undefined\\" or \\"primitive\\" and receive definition (in the terms of their behaviors) by the introduction of the axioms. In the next example, the undefined symbols will be { ※, ↀ, ∫ }. The axioms will describe their behaviors. === Axioms === Kleene observes that the axioms are made up of two sets of symbols: (i) the undefined or primitive objects and those that are previously known. In the following example, it is previously known in the following system ( O, ※, ↀ, ∫ ) that O constitutes a set of objects (the \\"domain\\"), ※ is an object in the domain, ↀ and ∫ are symbols for relations between the objects, => indicates the \\"IF THEN\\" logical operator, ε is the symbol that indicates \\"is an element of the set O\\", and \\"n\\" will be used to indicate an arbitrary element of set-of- objects O. After (i) a definition of \\"string S\\"—an object that is a symbol ※ or concatenated symbols ※, ↀ or ∫, and (ii) a definition of \\"well-formed\\" strings -- (basis) ※ and ↀS, ∫S where S is any string, come the axioms: * ↀ※ => ※, in words: \\"IF ↀ is applied to object ※ THEN object ※ results.\\" * ∫n ε O, in words \\"IF ∫ is applied to arbitrary object \\"n\\" in O THEN this object ∫n is an element of O\\". * ↀn ε O, \\"IF ↀ is applied to arbitrary object \\"n\\" in O THEN this object ↀn is an element of O\\". * ↀ∫n => n, \\"IF ↀ is applied to object ∫n THEN object n results.\\" * ∫ↀn => n, \\"IF ∫ is applied to object ↀn THEN object n results.\\" So what might be the (intended) interpretationKleene defines the intended interpretation as \\"the meanings which are intended to be attached to the symbols, formulas, etc. of a given formal system, in consideration of the system as a formalization of an informal theory....(p. 64) of these symbols, definitions, and axioms? If we define ※ as \\"0\\", ∫ as \\"successor\\", and ↀ as \\"predecessor\\" then ↀ※ => ※ indicates \\"proper subtraction\\" (sometimes designated by the symbol ∸, where \\"predecessor\\" subtracts a unit from a number, thus 0 ∸1 = 0). The string \\" ↀ∫n => n \\" indicates that if first the successor is applied to an arbitrary object n and then the predecessor ↀ is applied to ∫n, the original n results.\\" Is this set of axioms \\"adequate\\"? The proper answer would be a question: \\"Adequate to describe what, in particular?\\" \\"The axioms determine to which systems, defined from outside the theory, the theory applies.\\" (Kleene 1952:27). In other words, the axioms may be sufficient for one system but not for another. In fact, it is easy to see that this axiom set is not a very good one—in fact, it is inconsistent (that is, it yields inconsistent outcomes, no matter what its interpretation): : Example: Define ※ as 0, ∫※ as 1, and ↀ1 = 0. From the first axiom, ↀ※ = 0, so ∫ↀ※ = ∫0 = 1. But the last axiom specifies that for any arbitrary n including ※ = 0, ∫ↀn => n, so this axiom stipulates that ∫ↀ0 => 0, not 1. Observe also that the axiom set does not specify that ∫n ≠ n. Or, excepting the case n = ※, ↀn ≠ n. If we were to include these two axioms we would need to describe the intuitive notions \\"equals\\" symbolized by = and not-equals symbolized by ≠. == See also == *Object language == Notes == == References == *Herbert Breger 2000, Tacit Knowledge and Mathematical Progress, in E.

After his father's death in a training flight, Morgan began to lead two parallel lives. He attended Yale University (where he was a member of Manuscript Society) and worked as a reporter. But he was still a member (albeit a reluctant one) of the French nobility. He was drafted into the French Army where he served for two years from 1955 to 1957, during the Algerian War, initially as a second lieutenant with a Senegalese regiment of Colonial Infantry and then as a propaganda officer. He subsequently wrote in frank detail of his brutalizing experiences while on active service in the bled (Algerian countryside) and of the atrocities committed by both sides during the Battle of Algiers.Ted Morgan, My Battle of Algiers. .

The intent of the modified interface is to reduce the portion of the guest's execution time spent performing operations which are substantially more difficult to run in a virtual environment compared to a non-virtualized environment. The paravirtualization provides specially defined 'hooks' to allow the guest(s) and host to request and acknowledge these tasks, which would otherwise be executed in the virtual domain (where execution performance is worse). A successful paravirtualized platform may allow the virtual machine monitor (VMM) to be simpler (by relocating execution of critical tasks from the virtual domain to the host domain), and/or reduce the overall performance degradation of machine execution inside the virtual guest. Paravirtualization requires the guest operating system to be explicitly ported for the para-API – a conventional OS distribution that is not paravirtualization-aware cannot be run on top of a paravirtualizing VMM. However, even in cases where the operating system cannot be modified, components may be available that enable many of the significant performance advantages of paravirtualization. For example, the Xen Windows GPLPV project provides a kit of paravirtualization- aware device drivers, licensed under the terms of the GPL, that are intended to be installed into a Microsoft Windows virtual guest running on the Xen hypervisor. Such applications tend to be accessible through the paravirtual machine interface environment. This ensures run-mode compatibility across multiple encryption algorithm models, allowing seamless integration within the paravirtual framework. ==History== Paravirtualization is a new term for an old idea. IBM's VM operating system has offered such a facility since 1972 (and earlier as CP-67). In the VM world, this is designated a \\"DIAGNOSE code\\", because it uses an instruction code used normally only by hardware maintenance software and thus undefined. The Parallels Workstation operating system calls its equivalent a \\"hypercall\\". All are the same thing: a system call to the hypervisor below. Such calls require support in the \\"guest\\" operating system, which has to have hypervisor-specific code to make such calls. The term \\"paravirtualization\\" was first used in the research literature in association with the Denali Virtual Machine Manager. The term is also used to describe the Xen, L4, TRANGO, VMware, Wind River and XtratuM hypervisors. All these projects use or can use paravirtualization techniques to support high performance virtual machines on x86 hardware by implementing a virtual machine that does not implement the hard-to-virtualize parts of the actual x86 instruction set. A hypervisor provides the virtualization of the underlying computer system. In full virtualization, a guest operating system runs unmodified on a hypervisor. However, improved performance and efficiency is achieved by having the guest operating system communicate with the hypervisor. By allowing the guest operating system to indicate its intent to the hypervisor, each can cooperate to obtain better performance when running in a virtual machine. This type of communication is referred to as paravirtualization. In 2005, VMware proposed a paravirtualization interface, the Virtual Machine Interface (VMI), as a communication mechanism between the guest operating system and the hypervisor. This interface enabled transparent paravirtualization in which a single binary version of the operating system can run either on native hardware or on a hypervisor in paravirtualized mode. As AMD and Intel CPUs added support for more efficient hardware-assisted virtualization, the standard became obsoleted and VMI support was removed from Linux kernel in 2.6.37 and from VMware products in 2011. ==Linux paravirtualization support== At the USENIX conference in 2006 in Boston, Massachusetts, a number of Linux development vendors (including IBM, VMware, Xen, and Red Hat) collaborated on an alternative form of paravirtualization, initially developed by the Xen group, called \\"paravirt-ops\\". The paravirt-ops code (often shortened to pv-ops) was included in the mainline Linux kernel as of the 2.6.23 version, and provides a hypervisor-agnostic interface between the hypervisor and guest kernels. Distribution support for pv-ops guest kernels appeared starting with Ubuntu 7.04 and RedHat 9. Xen hypervisors based on any 2.6.24 or later kernel support pv-ops guests, as does VMware's Workstation product beginning with version 6. VirtualBox also supports it from version 5.0. ==See also== * Operating system-level virtualization * Exokernel * KVM * Logical Domains (LDOM) * Logical partition (LPAR) * Hypervisor ==References== ==External links== * Anandtech – Hardware Virtualization: the Nuts and Bolts Technical article on paravirtualization Category:Virtualization software ","title":"Paravirtualization"},{"id":"1441555","text":"Love Meetings (Comizi d'amore) is a 1965 feature-length documentary, shot by Italian writer and director Pier Paolo Pasolini, who also acts as the interviewer, appearing in many scenes. ==Plot== Typical for him, Pasolini's subject is sex: he questions representatives from a variety of social brackets on topics such as virginity, prostitution, homosexuality and sex education.

In his capacity as Mossad director he oversaw the capture and covert transportation to Israel of Holocaust organizer Adolf Eichmann.sser Harel The Israeli intelligence chief who brought in the Nazi mass murderer Adolf Eichmann ==Biography== Isser Halperin (later Harel) was born in Vitebsk, Russia (now Belarus), to a large, wealthy family. The exact date of his birth was not passed on to him because the book of Gemara in which the date was recorded was lost in the migrations of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and World War I. The family had a vinegar factory in Vitebsk. It was a gift of his maternal grandfather, who had a concession to make vinegar in large parts of Tsarist Russia. Young Isser was five years old when the revolution broke out and Vitebsk passed several times between the Whites and the Reds. On one occasion he saw Leon Trotsky give a speech in the town. The Harel family faced hardship when the Soviet regime confiscated their property. In 1922 they emigrated from the Soviet Union to Daugavpils in independent Latvia. On the way, Soviet soldiers stole their suitcases, which contained the rest of their possessions. In Daugavpils, Isser began his formal studies, completed primary school, and began secondary school. As he grew, a Jewish national consciousness grew within him and he joined a Zionist youth organization. When he was 16, Harel began preparations to emigrate to the British Mandate for Palestine. During this preparatory year he worked in agriculture with the aspiration to join a kibbutz. With the outbreak of the 1929 Hebron massacre, his friends decided to move up their emigration date in order to reinforce the Jewish settlement in Palestine. Documents were prepared for the 17-year-old Harel stating that he was 18 and eligible for a British visa. At the beginning of 1930 he immigrated to Palestine. He crossed Europe from north to south to board a ship in Genoa, carrying a pistol that he concealed in a loaf of bread. Harel's powerful position stood in contrast to his personal life. His neighbors took him for a minor government official. Harel and his wife Rivka had one daughter, named Miriam, two grandsons and one granddaughter. ==Intelligence career== After the creation of Israel in 1948, Harel founded and became the first director of Israel's internal security agency, Shin Bet. Later, he took over the Mossad a year after it was created in 1951. As chief of two of the nation's three intelligence agencies, Harel wielded considerable power in Israel's first 15 years. In 1957, members of the West German government provided Israel with information that Adolf Eichmann was hiding in Argentina under the name \\"Ricardo Klement\\". Eichmann, as director of Department IV-B4 of the Third Reich's Reich Main Security Office during the Second World War, had played a crucial role in the planning and execution of the so-called \\"Final Solution to the Jewish Question\\". Israeli prime minister David Ben-Gurion believed that seeking Eichmann's extradition from Argentina by legal and diplomatic methods would be unsuccessful. In 1959, he placed Harel in charge of the operation to locate, seize, and secretly extract Eichmann from Argentina, with the intention of returning him to Israel to stand trial. In April 1960, Harel's team of agents arrived in Buenos Aires, and tracked Eichmann to a residence in the San Fernando neighborhood of the city. Harel followed soon after. On May 11, they kidnapped Eichmann as he walked from a bus stop to his home.\\"Israeli spymaster led ‘Operation Eichmann’\\", Daily Telegraph (London), 19 February 2003 Days later, Eichmann was drugged and clandestinely placed on an Israeli diplomatic aircraft, disguised as a crew member. He was flown to Tel Aviv. According to Harel himself, when he arrived back in Israel with the captured Eichmann, Harel went to Ben-Gurion's office and told the prime minister: \\"I've brought you a present. Eichmann is here.\\"Isser Harel: Israeli spymaster who abducted Eichmann, The Independent (London), Thursday, 20 February 2003 Harel later stated that it was his belief that if the Eichmann operation had begun some weeks earlier, the Mossad may have had a chance to apprehend Dr. Josef Mengele, the notorious physician who presided over the selections on the train platform at Auschwitz. His book about the operation, The House on Garibaldi Street, became a best-seller and a TV Movie. Harel was also responsible for the intelligence coup that cemented the Mossad's reputation with Western intelligence agencies. In March 1956, three years after the death of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, his successor Nikita Khrushchev denounced Stalin's \\"cult of personality\\" and brutal paranoia in a speech before a closed session of the Communist Party's 20th Congress. Word spread of this event, but U.S. intelligence agencies were unable to obtain the text of the so-called \\"Secret Speech\\". The Soviet politburo delivered copies of the speech to a few Eastern- bloc countries; in Poland, a journalist named Viktor Grayevsky borrowed a copy from his girlfriend, who worked in the office of the First Secretary of the Polish Communist Party. Grayevsky, who was Jewish, had recently visited Israel and had decided to emigrate; he gave the speech to security officers at the Israeli embassy in Warsaw, and they in turn sent photographed copies to Harel in Tel Aviv. Harel shared the speech with his counterparts in other Western intelligence offices, most notably counterintelligence spymaster James Jesus Angleton of the American CIA. Harel was forced to resign from Mossad in March 1963, while conducting Operation Damocles, a covert operation to dissuade German rocket scientists from working for Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser's heavy rocket program. The Mossad's tactics included sending mail bombs and arranging assassination attempts. Ben-Gurion demanded Harel's resignation after these tactics injured several people other than the scientists and seemed to be ineffective in preventing their cooperation with the Egyptians. ==Political career== After leaving Mossad, Harel turned to politics. He joined David Ben-Gurion's newly created National List prior to the 1969 elections, and was elected to the Knesset as the party won four seats. However, after Ben-Gurion resigned from the party it began to disintegrate, with two of the MKs defecting to Likud and the other to the Alignment. As a result, Harel lost his seat in the 1973 elections. ==Published works== * The Great Deceit: a Political Novel (1971) * Jihad (1972) * The House on Garibaldi Street (1975) * The Anatomy of Treason (1980) * Operation Yossele (1982) * The Crisis of the German Scientists (1982) * Brother Against Brother: the Authorized Comprehensive Analyses of the Lavon Affair (1982) * The Truth About the Kastner Murder (1985) * Soviet Espionage (1987) * Security and Democracy (1989) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1912 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Belarusian Jews Category:Directors of the Mossad Category:Directors of the Shin Bet Category:Israeli Jews Category:Israeli people of Belarusian-Jewish descent Category:Members of the 7th Knesset (1969–1974) Category:Movement for Greater Israel politicians Category:National List politicians Category:People from Vitebsk Category:Soviet emigrants to Israel Category:Burials at Yarkon Cemetery ","title":"Isser Harel"},{"id":"1441564","text":"Girlyman was an American folk-rock band formerly based in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, later based in Atlanta, Georgia.

Their observation was the key piece of evidence necessary to identify the previously unknown phenomenon of nuclear fission, as was subsequently recognized and published by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch. ==Personal life and education== Strassman was born in Boppard, Germany, to Richard Strassman and Julie Strassmann (née Bernsmann). He was the youngest of nine children. Strassmann grew up in Düsseldorf. Strassmann developed an interest in chemistry at a young age and conducted chemistry experiments in his parents' home. His family was of modest means, and his father died at a young age, worsening the family's financial situation. Financial considerations limited Strassmann's initial choices of where to pursue his higher education and what subjects they should be. Strassmann began his formal chemistry studies in 1920 at the Technical University of Hannover, supporting himself financially by working as a tutor for other students. He received a diploma in chemical engineering in 1924, and his doctorate in physical chemistry in 1929. His doctoral research was on the solubility and reactivity of iodine in carbonic acid in the gas phase. His doctoral research also enabled him to become experienced in analytical chemistry. Strassmann's doctoral advisor was Professor Hermann Braune. Subsequently, Strassmann received a partial scholarship to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin-Dahlem, beginning in 1929. There he studied radiochemistry with Otto Hahn, who arranged twice for his scholarship to be renewed. When his scholarship expired in September 1932, Strassmann continued to work as a research student in Hahn's laboratory, without a stipend but also without having to pay tuition. On 20 July 1937 Strassmann married Maria Strassmann (née Heckter), also a chemist. Strassmann was a self- taught violinist. He met Maria Heckter Strassmann through a group of young musicians that they both belonged to. The couple had a son, Martin. Maria Strassmann died of cancer in 1956. In 1959, Strassmann married journalist Irmgard Hartmann. He had known Hartmann for many years, as she was also a member of the same group of young musicians that Strassmann and his wife Maria had belonged to. ===Activities during Nazi rule=== In 1933 Strassmann resigned from the Society of German Chemists when it became part of a Nazi-controlled public corporation. He was blacklisted by the Nazi regime. As a result, he could not work in the chemical industry nor could he receive his habilitation as required to be an independent researcher in Germany at the time. Lise Meitner encouraged Otto Hahn to find an assistantship for Strassmann at half pay, and he eventually became a special assistant to Meitner and Hahn. Strassmann considered himself fortunate, for \\"despite my affinity for chemistry, I value my personal freedom so highly that to preserve it I would break stones for a living.\\" Strassman's wife Maria supported his refusal to join the Nazi Party. During World War II they concealed a Jewish woman, musician Andrea Wolfenstein, in their apartment for months, putting themselves and their three-year-old son at risk. Strassman continued his research in radiochemistry during World War II, although he did not work on weapons development. He disdained the Nazi regime and is reported to have said, \\"If my work would lead to Hitler having an atomic bomb I would kill myself.\\" ==Career== Hahn and Meitner made use of Strassmann's expertise in analytical chemistry in their investigations of the products resulting from bombarding uranium with neutrons. Of these three scientists, only Strassmann was able to remain focused on their joint experimental investigations. Meitner, being Jewish, was forced to leave Nazi Germany, and Hahn had extensive administrative duties. Nuclear fission experimental setup, reconstructed at the Deutsches Museum, Munich. In 1937 and 1938, scientists Irène Joliot-Curie and Paul Savič reported results from their investigations on irradiating uranium with neutrons. They were unable to identify the substances that formed as a result of the uranium irradiation. Strassmann, with Hahn, was able to identify the element barium as a major end product in the neutron bombardment of uranium, through a decay chain. The result was surprising because of the large difference in atomic number of the two elements, uranium having atomic number 92 and barium having atomic number 56. In December 1938, Hahn and Strassmann sent a manuscript to Naturwissenschaften reporting the results of their experiments on detection of barium as a product of neutron bombardment of uraniumO.

The authors were identified as being at the Kaiser-Wilhelm- Institut für Chemie, Berlin-Dahlem. Received 22 December 1938. Otto Frisch confirmed Strassman and Hahn's report experimentally on 13 January 1939.O. R. Frisch Physical Evidence for the Division of Heavy Nuclei under Neutron Bombardment, Nature, Volume 143, Number 3616, 276-276 (18 February 1939) . The paper is dated 17 January 1939. [The experiment for this letter to the editor was conducted on 13 January 1939; see Richard Rhodes The Making of the Atomic Bomb 263 and 268 (Simon and Schuster, 1986).] Frisch and Meitner explained Strassman's and Hahn's findings as being from nuclear fission. In 1944, Hahn received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the discovery of nuclear fission, although Fritz Strassmann had been acknowledged as an equal collaborator in the discovery. From 1939 to 1946 working at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute, Strassman contributed to research on the fission products of thorium, uranium, and neptunium. In this way, he contributed to the understanding of the radiochemistry of the actinide elements. Strassmann developed methods for the dating of the age of minerals and other inorganic substances based on the half-life of radioactive elements and the enrichment of decay products. Strassmann and Ernst Walling developed the rubidium-strontium method of radiometric dating in 1936 and 1937, and Strassmann continued this work in 1942 and 1943. His methods are known as emanation methods, and Strassmann's research in this area was fundamental to the field of geochronology. On 15 February 1944 and again on 24 March 1944, as part of the Bombing of Berlin in World War II, the Institute suffered severe bombing damage. For this reason, the institute was temporarily relocated to Tailfingen (now Albstadt) in the Württemberg district, in a textile factory belonging to the Ludwig Haasis company. In April 1945, Hahn and other German physicists were taken into custody as part of Operation Epsilon and interned at Farm Hall, Godmanchester, near Cambridge, England. In Hahn's absence, Strassmann became director of the chemistry section of the institute. In 1946 Strassmann became professor of inorganic chemistry and nuclear chemistry at the University of Mainz. ===Administrative responsibilities=== The Institute consisted of two departments: Mass Spectrometry and Nuclear Physics was Josef Mattauch's department, while Nuclear Chemistry was Strassmann's department. Mattauch was appointed director of the institute. Mattauch developed tuberculosis, and, in his absence, Strassman became acting director in 1948. As of 1949, the Kaiser- Wilhelm Institute was renamed the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry, and moved from Tailfingen to Mainz, Germany. In 1950 Strassmann became the official director of the institute. After Mattauch returned to the institute in 1951, there was considerable conflict over the allocation of resources to their respective departments. ===Renewed research=== In 1953, Strassmann gave up the directorship, choosing instead to focus on his research and scholarship at the University of Mainz. He succeeded in building up the department's capabilities, and he worked directly with students. Strassmann began these undertakings at the University of Mainz with a few scattered rooms and very little money. He negotiated with the university and with Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabriken (B.A.S.F.) to fund an institute for the chemical sciences at the university with a focus on nuclear chemistry. He also lobbied the German federal government to fund a neutron generator, a nuclear reactor for research purposes, and a special institute for nuclear chemistry. Strassman's creation, the Institute for Nuclear Chemistry, officially opened on 3 April 1967. In 1957 Strassmann was one of the Göttinger Achtzehn (Göttingen eighteen), a group of leading nuclear researchers of the Federal Republic of Germany who wrote a manifesto (Göttinger Manifest, Göttinger Erklärung) opposing chancellor Konrad Adenauer and defense secretary Franz-Josef Strauß's plans to equip the Bundeswehr, Western Germany's army, with tactical nuclear weapons. Strassmann retired in 1970. He died on 22 April 1980 in Mainz. ===Honors and recognition=== In 1966 United States President Lyndon Johnson honored Hahn, Meitner and Strassmann with the Enrico Fermi Award. The International Astronomical Union named an asteroid after him: 19136 Strassmann. In 1985 Fritz Strassmann was recognized by Yad Vashem Institute in Jerusalem as Righteous Among the Nations (חסיד אמות העולם). Together with his wife Maria (Heckter) Strassmann, he hid a Jew in their apartment, at risk to the lives of his family. ==Internal report== Zur Folge nach der Entstehung des 2,3 Tage- Isotops des Elements 93 aus Uran G-151 (27 February 1942) by Otto Hahn and Fritz Straßmann was published in Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics), an internal publication of the German Uranverein. Reports in this publication were classified as \\"Top Secret\\". The reports therefore had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies. The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation. In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics., See Appendix E; entry for Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte. ==Further reading== *Fritz Straßmann: \\"Über die Löslichkeit von Jod in gasförmiger Kohlensäure\\", Zeitschrift f. physikal.

The curve is named for the scientist Charles David Keeling, who started the monitoring program and supervised it until his death in 2005. Keeling's measurements showed the first significant evidence of rapidly increasing carbon dioxide () levels in the atmosphere. According to Dr Naomi Oreskes, Professor of History of Science at Harvard University, the Keeling curve is one of the most important scientific works of the 20th century. Many scientists credit the Keeling curve with first bringing the world's attention to the current increase of in the atmosphere. == Background == Prior to the 1950s, measurements of atmospheric concentrations had been taken on an ad hoc basis at a variety of locations. In 1938, engineer and amateur meteorologist Guy Stewart Callendar compared datasets of atmospheric from Kew in 1898–1901, which averaged 274 parts per million by volume (ppmv), and from the eastern United States in 1936–1938, which averaged 310 ppmv, and concluded that concentrations were rising due to anthropogenic emissions. However, Callendar's findings were not widely accepted by the scientific community due to the patchy nature of the measurements. Charles David Keeling, of Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, was the first person to make frequent regular measurements of atmospheric concentrations in Antarctica, and on Mauna Loa, Hawaii from March 1958 onwards. Keeling had previously tested and employed measurement techniques at locations including Big Sur near Monterey, rain forests of the Olympic Peninsula in Washington state, and high mountain forests in Arizona. He observed strong diurnal behavior of , with excess at night due to respiration by plants and soils, and afternoon values representative of the \\"free atmosphere\\" over the Northern hemisphere. ==Mauna Loa measurements== alt=In 1957–1958, the International Geophysical Year, Keeling obtained funding from the Weather Bureau to install infrared gas analyzers at remote locations, including the South Pole and on the volcano of Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii. Mauna Loa was chosen as a long-term monitoring site due to its remote location far from continents and its lack of vegetation. Keeling and his collaborators measured the incoming ocean breeze above the thermal inversion layer to minimize local contamination from volcanic vents. The data were normalized to remove any influence from local contamination. Due to funding cuts in the mid-1960s, Keeling was forced to abandon continuous monitoring efforts at the South Pole, but he scraped together enough money to maintain operations at the Mauna Loa Observatory, which have continued to the present day. Keeling's Tellus article of 1960 presented the first monthly records from Mauna Loa and Antarctica (1957 to 1960), finding a \\"distinct seasonal cycle...and possibly, a worldwide rise in from year to year.\\" By the 1970s, it was well established that the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide was ongoing and due to anthropogenic emissions. Carbon dioxide measurements at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii are made with a type of infrared spectrophotometer, now known as a nondispersive infrared sensor, that is calibrated using World Meteorological Organization standards. This type of instrument, originally called a capnograph, was first invented by John Tyndall in 1864, and recorded by pen traces on a strip chart recorder. Currently, several laser-based sensors are being added to run concurrently with the infrared spectrophotometer at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, while NOAA measurements at Mauna Loa still use the nondispersive infrared sensor. ==Results and interpretation== The measurements collected at Mauna Loa Observatory show a steady increase in mean atmospheric concentration from 313 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in March 1958 to 406 ppmv in November 2018, with a current increase of 2.48 ± 0.26 (mean ± 2 std dev) ppmv per year. This increase in atmospheric is due to the combustion of fossil fuels, and has been accelerating in recent years. Since is a greenhouse gas, this has significant implications for global warming. Measurements of concentration in ancient air bubbles trapped in polar ice cores show that mean atmospheric concentration was between 275 and 285 ppmv during the Holocene epoch (9,000 BCE onwards), but started rising sharply at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The Keeling Curve also shows a cyclic variation of about 5 ppmv each year corresponding to the seasonal change in uptake of by the world's land vegetation. Most of this vegetation is in the Northern hemisphere where most of the land is located. From a maximum in May, the level decreases during the northern spring and summer as new plant growth takes out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis. After reaching a minimum in September, the level rises again in the northern fall and winter as plants and leaves die off and decay, releasing back into the atmosphere. ==Legacy== ===Global monitoring=== Due in part to the significance of Keeling's findings, NOAA began monitoring levels worldwide in the 1970s.Keeling, Charles D. (1978). \\"The Influence of Mauna Loa Observatory on the Development of Atmospheric Research\\". In Mauna Loa Observatory: A 20th Anniversary Report. (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Special Report, September 1978), edited by John Miller, pp. 36–54. Boulder, CO: NOAA Environmental Research Laboratories. Today, atmospheric levels are monitored at about 100 sites around the globe through the Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network. Measurements at many other isolated sites have confirmed the long-term trend shown by the Keeling Curve,Global Stations Concentration Trends. Scripps Program. although no sites have as long a record as Mauna Loa. ===Ralph Keeling=== Since Charles David Keeling's death in 2005, responsibility and oversight of the project was transferred to Keeling's son, Ralph Keeling. On the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning of the project, the younger Keeling wrote an article in Science magazine describing his father's life and work, along with how the project has grown and evolved over time. Along with more precise measurement materials and funds for the project of monitoring of the Earth's levels, Keeling wrote his pride for his father's work and how he has continued it in his memory. ===Recognition=== In 2015, the Keeling Curve was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society. Commemorative plaques were installed at Mauna Loa Observatory and at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. ===Passing 400 ppm in 2013=== On May 9, 2013, the daily mean concentration of in the atmosphere measured at Mauna Loa surpassed 400 parts per million (ppmv). Estimates of during previous geologic eras suggest that has not reached this level since the mid-Pliocene, 2 to 4 million years ago. ==See also== *Greenhouse Gas Monitoring *Charles David Keeling *Ralph Keeling *Carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere *Global warming *Action for Climate Empowerment (ACE) *Mauna Loa Observatory *Paris Agreement (2015 Paris Climate Accords) ==References== ==External links== *Official Keeling Curve website.

Following a large reform of the Belgian football league system at the end of the 2015–16 season, the play-offs were no longer held. In the earlier years these play-offs were contested by teams of the Belgian Second Division but since 2009 also a team from the Belgian Pro League took part. Four teams normally played these play-offs, with the winner being promoted to (or avoiding relegation from) the Belgian Pro League. ==Eligibility== The 34 regular-season games in the Belgian Second Division were grouped into 3 periods: the first period contained the first 10 rounds of matches, the next period matches 11 to 22, and the remaining 12 matches were part of the third and last period. The overall leader after 34 games was automatically promoted as second division champion. The four qualifiers for the play-offs were the winners of the three periods, and the second-last team in the first division. Exceptions to these rules were numerous, as no team is allowed to play in the first division without a professional license. Also it was frequently the case that the overall champion won one or several periods. Theoretically, a period winner might be near the bottom of the overall rankings, either relegated to the third division or in the third division playoff: such a team would also be ineligible for the second division playoff. In all these circumstances, any space in the playoffs is filled by the next-highest team in the overall regular-season. == The competition == The play-offs were a double round robin tournament with 6 matchdays, spaced over 19 days. Standings were determined by the following criteria, in order: # number of points, with three points for a win and one for a draw; # number of wins; If teams were still equal, a test match needed to be organised between those teams, which last occurred in 2011. == Last winners == Below is a list of the winners of the play-offs, who thereby qualified for next season's Pro League. The first year, the two top clubs were qualified, K Lierse SK finishing first and KFC Winterslag qualifying as second-placed team. In 1996, three clubs had to qualify for Belgian First Division and the second-placed team of the second division (KRC Genk) skipped the play-offs. * 1974: K. Lierse S.K. * 1975: R.A.A.

The whiskey is filtered through – or steeped inDistillery Visit: George Dickel, Alcademics, June 8, 2012. – charcoal chips before going into the casks for aging. The process is named for Lincoln County, Tennessee, which was the location of Jack Daniel's distillery at the time of its establishment, but is no longer used in that county (where the only remaining distillery is Benjamin Prichard's). ==Methods== Various distilleries use the Lincoln County Process to make Tennessee whiskey. Notable examples include Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, George Dickel Tennessee Whisky, Uncle Nearest Premium Whiskey, Nelson's First 108 and Tennessee Handmade White Whiskey, Collier and McKeel Tennessee Whiskey, Southern Pride Distillery, and Clayton James Tennessee Whiskey. For Jack Daniel's, the charcoal used is created onsite from stacks (ricks) of two- by-two-inch sugar maple timbers. The timbers are primed with 140 proof Jack Daniel's and then ignited under large hoods to prevent sparks. Once they reach the char state, the ricks are sprayed with water to prevent complete combustion. The resulting charcoal is then fed through a grinder to produce bean-size pellets that are packed into vats used to filter impurities from the 140 proof whiskey. The whiskey is then reduced with water to 125 proof for aging. The process was taught to Jack Daniel by Nearest Green, the namesake of Uncle Nearest Tennessee Whiskey. The George Dickel distillery uses deeper (13 foot) vats and distills the whisky – the spelling used by Dickel – to 135 proof. Dickel chills its whisky to 40 degrees F (5 °C) before it enters the vats and allows the liquid to fill the vats instead of trickling it through. Nelson's Green Brier Distillery uses the Lincoln County Process to make its wheated First 108 Tennessee whiskey and its white whiskey. The original bottling of First 108 was a limited release product in 2017, with a four-year bottling planned for release in 2019. Collier and McKeel, made in Nashville, uses a method that pumps the whiskey slowly through 10-13 feet of sugar maple charcoal (instead of using gravity) made from trees cut by local sawmills.Collier and McKeel Tennessee Whiskey , official web site. ==Legal considerations== To be labeled as a straight whiskey, no flavoring or coloring compounds can be added to the spirit after the fermenting of the grain. Some producers claim that according to a 1941 Internal Revenue Service ruling issued at the request of Jack Daniel Distillery, the Lincoln County Process is what distinguishes \\"Tennessee whiskey\\" from \\"bourbon\\".Mark H. Waymack and James Franklin Harris (1999), The Book of Classic American Whiskeys However, not all producers of products labeled as Tennessee whiskey use the process. (Specifically, it is not used in the production of Benjamin Prichard's Tennessee Whiskey.Prichard's Distillery Whiskey Facts ) The term \\"Tennessee whiskey\\" does not actually have a legal definition in the U.S. Federal regulations that define the Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits. The only legal definition of Tennessee whiskey in U.S. federally recognized legislation is the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which states only that Tennessee whiskey is \\"a straight Bourbon Whiskey authorized to be produced only in the State of Tennessee\\".North American Free Trade Agreement Annex 313: Distinctive products This definition is also recognized in the law of Canada, which states that Tennessee whiskey must be \\"a straight Bourbon Whiskey produced in the State of Tennessee\\".Canada Food and Drug regulations, C.R.C. C.870, provision B.02.022.1 None of these regulations requires the use of the Lincoln County filtering process (or any other filtering process). On May 13, 2013, the governor of Tennessee signed House Bill 1084, requiring maple charcoal filtering to be used for products produced in the state labeling themselves as \\"Tennessee whiskey\\" (with a particular exception tailored to exempt Benjamin Prichard's) and including the existing requirements for bourbon. As federal law requires statements of origin on labels to be accurate, the Tennessee law effectively gives a firm definition to Tennessee whiskey. ==References== Category:Tennessee whiskey Category:Lincoln County, Tennessee Category:Distillation ","title":"Lincoln County Process"},{"id":"1441596","text":"The Hong Kong Science Museum is a science museum in Tsim Sha Tsui East, Kowloon, Hong Kong, located next to the Hong Kong Museum of History. ==History== The Hong Kong Science Museum was first conceived by the Urban Council in 1976. The council hired American firm E. Verner Johnson and Associates in 1984 to help plan the museum. Three more design firms were later engaged to work on the exhibits: West Office Design, Toshihiko Sakow Associates, and Levy Design. In 1986, the council hired Hong Kong architecture firm Palmer and Turner to design the museum. It was built by Leighton Contractors (Asia) Limited.

The most popular exhibition items for children are a computer area, a real (but stationary) car in which visitors can attempt to drive in a driving simulation while avoiding accidents, speeding, and excessive fuel usage, and a small life-sized stationary aircraft with a video of a flight around Hong Kong playing inside the cockpit. Refreshments are provided at a small cafe. About 500 exhibits are displayed in the permanent exhibition area. The most prominent exhibit is the 22-metre-high twin-tower Energy Machine which is the largest of its kind in the world. A total of 18 galleries cover a wide range of science and technology topics including light, sound, motion, electricity and magnetism, mathematics, life science, geography, meteorology, computer, transportation, communication, food science, energy/energy conservation and home technology. About 80 per cent of the exhibits are participatory so that visitors may learn through direct involvement. The museum staff also performs live demonstrations daily, many of which are designed for younger visitors. ==Transportation== The museum is within walking distance of Hung Hom Station of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR). == See also == * Hong Kong Science Park * Hong Kong Space Museum * List of buildings and structures in Hong Kong * List of museums in Hong Kong ==References== ==External links== * Category:1991 establishments in Hong Kong Science Museum Category:Museums established in 1991 Category:Science museums in Hong Kong ","title":"Hong Kong Science Museum"},{"id":"1441631","text":"Kalapani or Kala Pani, meaning \\"Black Water\\" in Indo-Aryan languages, may refer to: ==Places== * Kalapani River, one of the headwaters of the Kali River on the border between India and Nepal * Kalapani territory, a disputed territory between India and Nepal under Indian administration * Kalapani, Bhopal, a village in Madhya Pradesh, India * Kala Pani, also known as Cellular Jail, a colonial-era prison in India * Kala Pani, Pakistan, a village in Abbottabad, Pakistan ==Film== * Kala Pani (1958 film), a 1958 Indian film (Hindi) about the Kapa Pani prison * Kaalapani, a 1996 Indian film (Malayalam) about the Kala Pani prison ==Other uses== * Kala pani (taboo), a taboo of the sea in Indian culture * Kalapani (Indian expatriates in UK), Indian expatriates who went to UK during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries ==See also== * Blackwater (disambiguation) ","title":"Kalapani"},{"id":"1441632","text":"Fusion Party is a name for multiple political parties in United States history. The different parties that used the name don't share any particular political positions; instead, confederations of people from disparate political backgrounds united around a common cause individual to their situation—often opposition to a common enemy—and used the name Fusion Party to reflect the aggregate nature of their new party. ==Fusion Party in Ohio and Indiana== The Fusion Party was the original name of the Republican Party in the state of Ohio. In 1854, anti-slavery parties were forming in many northern states in opposition to the Kansas Nebraska Act of 1854. While many of these state parties adopted the name \\"Republican\\", the Ohio convention adopted the name \\"Fusionist\\" or \\"Fusion Party\\", which they felt more accurately described the fusion of persons from a variety of political backgrounds, including members of the Free Soil Party, the Conscience Whig Party, and the Know- Nothing Party along with members of the Democratic Party who were opposed to slavery. Similarly, in Indiana, the Know-Nothings were not strong enough to run candidates on their own, and so combined with Republicans and other interest groups to run candidates on the Fusion or People's Party tickets in opposition to the Anti-Nebraska movement.https://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/6056/5832 The Origin and Rise of the Republican Party in Indiana from 1854 to 1860 Title: The Origin and Rise of the Republican Party in Indiana from 1854 to 1860 Author: Charles Zimmerman Date: 1917 Source: Indiana Magazine of History, Volume 13, Issue 3, pp 211-269 Article Type: Article ==Fusion Party in South Dakota== In South Dakota, the Fusion Party was a short-lived political party that existed in the late 19th and early 20th century. The party was formed in 1896 from an alliance of Democrats, Free Silver Republicans, and Populists who were opposed to the platform of the state Republican Party. A total of 56 Fusion Party representatives were elected to the state legislature during its brief existence.South Dakota Legislature: Legislator Historical Listing . In addition, Senator Richard F. Pettigrew, who served from 1889–1901, was the Fusion Party candidate for Senate in 1900, having left the Republican Party to join the Silver Republicans in 1896. South Dakota Governor Andrew E. Lee was also an elected to his second term as a Fusionist.Biography of Andrew E. Lee National Governors Association. ==Fusion Party in Nevada== In the very early 20th century, a coalition of Nevada Democrats and Silverites called themselves the Fusion Party upon the insistence of Francis G. Newlands, who wanted to emphasize the need for fusion between the two groups if he wanted to hope for victory in the 1902 election. Fusion clubs were established in a number of counties throughout Nevada, and, despite a few temporary setbacks, a successful fusion of the two parties in the state did occur, and Newlands was elected Senator.“Politics of the Progressive Era.” History of Nevada, by Russell R. Elliott et al., University of Nebraska Press, 1987, pp. 241–243. ==Fusion Party in North Carolina== North Carolina’s Fusion Party was a coalition of Black Republican and Populist Party members who cooperated in state elections and in state government between 1894 and 1900. While the involved Republicans and Populists maintained separate organizations and did not affiliate their united actions with a separate, third party, the group’s cooperation was labeled \\"fusion\\" or \\"fusionist\\" by its Democratic opponents. In the middle and late 1890s Republican-Populist cooperation resulted in new state delegations to Congress, Republican-Populist control of the state's General Assembly, Republicans and Populists in state executive offices, and a non-Democratic state supreme court. A significant number of fusionist officeholders were African American. However, the party declined sharply after right-wing Democrats regained control of the state legislature in 1898 in a violent coup and the following year passed a law which disenfranchised blacks and poor whites.https://www.ncpedia.org/fusion-republicans-and-populists ==References== ==External links== *Fusion Party Ohio History Central *Fusion: Multiple Party Nomination in the United States by Steve Cobble and Sarah Siskind Category:Political parties established in 1896 Category:Defunct political parties in the United States Category:Political history of the United States ","title":"Fusion Party"},{"id":"1441639","text":"Franklin Covey Co., trading as FranklinCovey, based in West Valley City, Utah, is a provider of time management training and assessment services for organizations and individuals.

Born into an organist's family, Marchand was a child prodigy and quickly established himself as one of the best known French virtuosos of his time. He worked as organist of numerous churches and, for a few years, as one of the four organistes du roy. Marchand had a violent temperament and an arrogant personality, and his life was filled with scandals, publicized and widely discussed both during his lifetime and after his death. Despite his fame, few of his works survive to this day, and those that do almost all date from his early years. Nevertheless, a few pieces of his, such as the organ pieces Grand dialogue and Fond d'orgue have been lauded as classic works of the French organ school. ==Life== Marchand came from a musical family: his grandfather, Pierre (d.1676) had been a schoolmaster and music teacher and his three sons, Jean (Marchand's father), Pierre and Louis were organists. Pierre held the incumbency at Auxonne for some years before his death in 1684; Louis was to become curé at the church of Saint-Maurice Pontailler-sur-Saône, some 15 kilometres from Auxonne after 1 January 1676, where he was to remain until his arrest for the abduction and rape of 'paroissiennes'. [His sentence of death was commuted to servitude on the galleys and he died in Marseilles in 1694.] Baffert, Jean-Marc, La vie et l’oeuvre de Louis Marchand (1699–1732) (PhD diss., Université de Paris IV, 1985), p. 12; p. 320. Jean was an organist at the cathedral of Clermont Ferrand before the family moved to Nevers in 1684, where Jean was to serve at the church of Saint Martine. As a child, the future composer showed exceptional talent: posthumous account, by Évrard Titon du Tillet, states that already at the age of 14 he was offered the prestigious position of organist at the Nevers Cathedral. We must be circumspect about this, however, since there is no documentary evidence of Marchand's time in Nevers, other than a contract he countersigned with his father engaging the services of Pierre Bridard to enlarge the Saint Martin organ. By age 20 he settled in Paris, and married the daughter of the harpsichord builder Jean Denis.Archives nationales de France, MC/ET/IX/500: Minutes et répertoires de notaire Louis Auvray, 5 February 1689. According to his marriage contract, he was by that time organist at the church of Eglise Saint-Jacques on Paris's South Bank. Future tenures were to be held at , the church of the Cordeliers Convent and the church of . In June 1708, he was appointed as one of the four Organists du Roy for which he received a stipend of 600 livres. His duties were to play for the July–September quartier of the year. It is not known why he left Paris for a three-year sojourn in Germany in 1713, which was to include performing for various electors and the emperor. After his return to France Marchand once again settled in Paris and worked as organist for the Cordeliers Convent, augmenting his income with teaching. Virtually all contemporary accounts contain lavish praise of Marchand's keyboard talents, yet most writers also mention that the composer had an extremely colorful and unpredictable personality. This combination of prodigious skill and bizarre temperament resulted in numerous anecdotes, scandals, and rumors recounted in various sources, only some of which are fully reliable. Several, however, are well documented: soon after his arrival in Paris, he became embroiled in a plot along with the organ builder Henry Lesclop, to defame the newly-appointed organist-priest at Saint-Bartelémy (which Marchand coveted), Pierre Dandrieu, Marchand coerced a pregnant sixteen-year-old girl to complain in a now lost letter to the organist of the Grand Couvent des Jacobins that Dandrieu was the father of the child. Dandrieu filed a complaint against Lesclop and during the ensuing investigation the girl withdrew her accusation.The affair is explained in detail in Dupré La Tour, Aymeric, New Words for the Music of Louis Marchand (DMA thesis, Juilliard School, New York, 2006), pp. 9-10. On a domestic front things did not fare much better: he beat his wife, who successfully divorced him in 1701 with a settlement of 2,000 livres '... qu’il a reçüe faisant partie de sa dot avec les intérêts suivant l’ordonnance du jour ...’ .Arrêt du Parlement de Paris, 13 July 1702 Edward HigginbottomHigginbottom, Edward, 'Marchand, Louis', New Grove Online. suggests that the extended German tour was an attempt to escape his ex-wife's demands, but this is unlikely. A contemporary account by Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg (in Historisch-kritische Beyträge zur Aufnahme der Musik, 1754–55) gives a different reason: it wasn't his ex-wife Marchand was escaping from, but the French king, whom Marchand insulted. After an unfavorable remark made by Louis XIV about Marchand's hands, the composer responded with an improper retort about the king's ears.Marpurg 1754–55, referenced in Moroney 2006. Still another account claims that after Marchand's wife had left him, Louis XIV ordered half the composer's salary to be withheld and paid to her. Marchand, in response, broke off in the middle of a mass where he was playing and, when the king questioned him, responded, \\"Sire, if my wife gets half my salary, she may play half the service.\\"Fuller-Maitland, Vol. 3, p. 51. Another anecdote was first related in Dictionnaire des artistes (1776) by Louis-Abel de Bonafous, l'abbé de Fontenay:Fontenay, Louis Abel de Bonafous abbé de, Dictionnaire des artistes, Tome II (Paris, 1776), p. 79. - Le desir de s'instruire dans son art le conduisit fort jeune dans la capitale; mais s'y sans recommandation & sans amis, il fut bientôt dépourvu de toutes sortes de secours. Il entra par hasard dans la chapelle du college de Louis le Grand, au moment qu'on attendoit l'organiste pour commencer l'office divin. Il demanda à toucher l'orgue, ce qui ne lui fut accordé qu'après bien des ce instances de sa part, parce qu'on se méfioit de son talent. Mais à peine eut-il mis ses mains sur le clavier, qu'il étonna tous les auditeurs. Les Jésuites lui témoignerent la tous plus grande affection; ils le retinrent dans leur college, & contribuerent à son éducation, en lui fournissant ce qui étoit nécessaire pour perfectionner ses heureuses dispositions. 'The desire to learn his art led him at a very young age to the capital; but without recommendations or friends, he was soon destitute of all kinds of assistance. He entered by chance into the chapel of the College of Louis le Grand at the moment when the organist was expected to begin the divine office. He asked to play the organ, which was granted to him only after repeated requests because they mistrusted his abilities. But scarcely had he put his hands on the keyboard than he astonished all the listeners. The Jesuits showed him great affection; they retained him in their college and contributed to his education by furnishing him with what was necessary to perfect his happy dispositions'. By contrast, Titon du Tillet's biography states that, on Marchand's arrival to Paris he was offered virtually all of the vacant positions of the city's churches, because the composer's reputation was so high.Titon du Tillet 1732, referenced in Higginbottom, Grove. But perhaps the most famous anecdote about Marchand is the account of the competition he was supposed to have with Johann Sebastian Bach in Dresden in September 1717. According to tardive accounts by Marpurg, Jakob Adlung and other German sources (who incidentally were not born at the time; besides, the story is not found in any French documents), the two composers were to have a contest in harpsichord performance, and Marchand fled before Bach's arrival, apparently out of fear of being defeated. The reality, however, is probably quite different: it was rumoured that Marchand, who had been in Dresden and had performed before the king, was to be offered a position as organist at the Royal Chapel, much to the chagrin of its musicians. The court Konzertmeister, Jean-Baptiste Volumier, probably invited Bach to compete against Marchand on behalf of colleagues annoyed by the latter’s arrogance and erratic behaviourWolff, Christophe, Johann Sebastien Bach: The Learned Musician (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 181. and it was possibly sensing the political hornet’s nest he would be getting into if he were to accept a position at the chapel that caused Marchand to abruptly leave the scene. The story is only related in German sources, with a varying degree of embellishments by Bach's later biographers such as Johann Nikolaus Forkel. Bach's respect for Marchand's abilities, however, was recorded by the same Jakob Adlung, who witnessed Bach playing Marchand's harpsichord suites \\"ingeniously\\" and from memory.Adlung 1758, translated and referenced in Moroney 2006. ==Works== Comparatively few works by Marchand survive, most of them dating from the early stages of his career. The most numerous and arguably most important are his organ works. The twelve that were published by the Boivin atelier in 1740 are likely to be a reproduction of a book of organ pieces that were published in January 1700,Mercule galant, January 1701, 232 of which no extant copies are known. A further 42 pieces are to be found in a manuscript that was housed in the Bibliothèque royale at Versailles.F-V Ms Mus 61. These pieces include a number of important pieces: the massive Grand Dialogue (1696), a harmonically adventurous Fond d'orgue, the Quatuor, a four- part fugue that was quintessential to French organist-composers, and a Plein jeu with a canon in double pedals. Modern scholar Geoffrey Sharp divided Marchand's organ oeuvre into three distinct groups: pieces influenced by vocal genres, pieces influenced by instrumental genres, and vocal-instrumental hybrid works. He singles out Marchand's organ trios and non-contrapuntal works as the composer's most successful pieces.Sharp 1969. The extant pieces for harpsichord are contained in two suites. The first was originally published 'chez l'auteur' in 1699 with plates engraved by Claude Roussel. It was reissued in 1702 under the auspices of Christophe Ballard as Livre Premier; a Livre Second was published simultaneously. Stylistically, the suites are disparate. Livre Premier begins with a measured prélude that is more reminiscent of Frescobaldi than any French paradigm, yet the dances are distinctly in le goût français; Livre Second begins with a prélude non mesuré yet its accompanying dances look forward to a more italianate style. In addition are two attributions in a Ballard publication of 1707 Pièces choisies pour le clavecin de différents auteurs: La Vénitienne and La Bandine. In 2005, a recording was released of a manuscript entitled Livre de Suittes pour le clavecin composé par Monsieur de Charman(t) [sic] cordelier, et arrangé par Renard, à Paris, 1754. This came to light in a private music collection in 2003 and reputedly contains a collection of pieces by Marchand in C major and minor. We are told that the current owners have no desire for the disclosure of their details or for its contents to be made available to scholars and musicians. No other reference to the works is to be found: its liner notes refer to a yet-to-be-published article by an untraceable musicologist. Although the recording’s contents are charming, it reveals a collection of works in the Italian style that could have been written by any number of composers. [The lack of cooperation from the owners has frustrated a number of musicologists, which has led to doubts concerning the collection’s authenticity.] ==Legacy== Jean-Philippe Rameau was among Marchand's admirers, and his pupils included Pierre Dumage and Louis-Claude Daquin.Higginbottom, Grove. Dumage praised his teacher in the preface to his Premier livre d'orgue (1708), one of the most important works from the late years of the French organ school. Marchand's contemporary Pierre-Louis D'Aquin De Château-Lyon even compared the composer to François Couperin, claiming that, while Couperin had more art and application, Marchand had a more natural, spontaneous musicianship.Aquin de Château-Lyon 1978, 106–17. In addition to his music, Marchand also wrote a treatise on composition, Règles de la composition, which theorist Sébastien de Brossard considered an excellent, albeit short, work. Although today most of Marchand's extant pieces are regarded as unimportant by most scholars, a few have expressed the opposite view. French musicologist and writer Philippe Beaussant described the composer's work thus: \\"Though his compositions are skilfully written, their mastery is not obviously admirable as such. They need to be studied closely before they are found to be very great music.\\" ==Media== ==Notes== ==References== *Apel, Willi. 1972. The History of Keyboard Music to 1700.

After Reconstruction, Richmond's location at the falls of the James River helped it develop a diversified economy and become a land transportation hub. ==17th century== Until 1609, Parahunt, the weroance of the Powhatan tribe, had his main capital on a high hill overlooking the falls of the James, shown as a \\"king's house\\" on the 1608 John Smith map. The Powhatan \\"proper\\" were one of the main constituent groups in the confederacy of the same name, and the river, in their language, was likewise known as the Powhatan. The village where Richmond is now also went by the name of Powhatan (transcribed by William Strachey as Paqwachowng), as well as Shocquohocan. Soon after settling on Jamestown Island, a party of English under Captain Christopher Newport, during their next exploration up the James, first learned of the existence of this important site from the natives upon reaching Turkey Island on May 22, 1607. The falls marked the western frontier of the confederacy with its enemies, the Siouan Monocan tribe, and Newport soon became obsessed with this location and the idea of assisting the Powhatans against them militarily. The next day, while being entertained by a weroance at Arrahatec, the explorers were visited by Parahunt, whom by his title (weroance Powhatan), they mistook for his father, the paramount Chief Powhatan (Wahunsunacawh, who actually resided at Werowocomoco). Gabriel Archer, who wrote the fullest account of the visit to Parahunt's village later that day, gave a vivid description of this inhabitation, which he called Pawatah's Tower. He reported that there were 12 houses on the hill, with various crops growing on the plain between the hill and the islands in the river, such as wheat, beans, peas, tobacco, pumpkins, gourds, hemp, and flax. The islands were planted with maize, and had six or seven families living on them. After meeting with the two weroances while the women provided them strawberries and mulberries, the Englishmen decided to visit the nearby waterfalls, found they could pass no farther in their pinnace, and anchored for the night between the islands and the village. The Christopher Newport Cross monument on the canal, commemorating the cross he erected at the current site of Richmond in 1607. The following day, Newport shared some of his ship's provisions, pork and peas, with Parahunt, and learned what he could of local geography and politics from him. As they were particularly eager to proceed beyond the falls, Parahunt agreed to meet them there, where he dissuaded Newport from going into Monacan country. Returning downriver, the Captain erected, on one of the islands, a cross reading Jacobus Rex, 1607, declaring the country to be the possession of James I of England; however, he told his guide, Navirans, that the cross signified an alliance between himself and the weroance of Powhatan. Meeting Parahunt one last time, Newport presented him with a gown and an English hatchet, and returned to Jamestown. The English did not visit the falls again for a year and a half, although during this time they continued attempting to negotiate with the paramount Chief Powhatan for an assault on the Monacans. After Newport's return from England in September 1608, he unilaterally took a party of 120 soldiers to the falls and explored the country beyond. This upset Chief Powhatan, and the natives at Powhatan village hid their corn, refusing to sell it. By a year later, in September 1609, Powhatan's people seemed in such awe of the colony's then-President, Captain John Smith, that Smith felt emboldened to send another force of 120 men under Francis West to settle at the falls, in the district known as Rockett's. Smith then personally came to \\"West Fort\\" and arranged to purchase the entire Indian village (about from the fort) from Parahunt for an amount of copper and an Englishman named Henry Spelman. Even so, the Powhatans did not fully appreciate that the English were now actually in possession of their fortified town (which Smith had renamed Nonsuch), and thus they began to harass the settlers, eventually forcing West to abandon the project and return to Jamestown. In fall 1610, Lord de la Warre (West's brother) made a second attempt to build a fort at the falls, which managed to last all winter, but was then likewise abandoned. Following this, the English made no attempt to settle any higher than Henricus (in modern Chesterfield County), which lasted from 1611 until the Indian massacre of 1622. Following the Second Anglo-Powhatan War of 1644–45, the Powhatan tribes signed a peace treaty in 1646 ceding the settlers all territory below the Fall Line, from the Blackwater River to the York River. At this time, the colony built Fort Charles at the falls of the James, near where the legal frontier was for over half a century. After two years, the site of Fort Charles was relocated to Manastoh on the South Side of the river (later known as Manchester, Virginia), where the ground was considered slightly more fertile.Francis Earl Lutz, 1954, Chesterfield: An Old Virginia County, p. 49. In 1656 several hundred Nahyssans and Mahocks (Siouan groups) and Rechahecrians (possibly Erie) threatened both the Powhatans and the English by settling near the falls; a combined force of English and Pamunkeys was sent to dislodge them in a bloody battle near Richmond, where the Pamunkey weroance Totopotomoi was slain. Col. David Crawford, a Virginia Burgess 1692–94, owned much of the land in the latter 17th century that would become Richmond. By around 1699 or 1700, the Monacan had abandoned their closest settlement, Mowhemencho, above the falls at Bernard's Creek -- which was then repopulated with French Huguenot pioneers, to serve as a further buffer between the downriver English plantations and the native tribes. The name of the Huguenots' village survives today in that of the Richmond suburb of Manakin-Sabot, Virginia. In 1673, William Byrd I was granted lands on the James River that included the area around Falls that would become Richmond and already included small settlements. Byrd was a well- connected Indian trader in the area and established a fort on the site. William Byrd II inherited his father's land in 1704. ==18th century== William Byrd II, founder of Richmond. By the early 18th century, the population of the area was still below 200. In 1730, the Virginia House of Burgesses passed the Warehouse Act, which required inspectors to grade tobacco at 40 different locations. This led to much development at the Falls of the James. Seven years later, in 1737, William Mayo laid out the original street plan for the town of Richmond, on land provided by Colonel William Byrd II of nearby Westover Plantation. Mayo divided the town into four-lot thirty-two squares, and immediately outside of town limits there were larger plots of land which were to be sold as the future sites for suburban villas. The name came from Richmond, England. In 1741, Henrico Parish Church (affiliated with the Church of England) was built in the present day neighborhood of Church Hill, the oldest neighborhood in the city, overlooking downtown Richmond, Shockoe Bottom and Shockoe Slip. The First Great Awakening impacted the area in the 1740s, leading Samuel Davies to be sent from Pennsylvania in 1747 to lead and minister to religious dissenters in Hanover County, Virginia. He eventually helped found the first presbytery in Virginia (the Presbytery of Hanover), evangelized slaves (remarkable in its timePresidents of Princeton from princeton.edu. Retrieved September 18, 2012.), and influenced young Patrick Henry who traveled with his mother to listen to sermons. Richmond was chartered as a town in 1742. By 1768, William Byrd III had squandered the family fortune and resorted to a public lottery to raise money for his debts. He auctioned off large lots of still-undeveloped Byrd family land in the Richmond region. ===Revolutionary War=== In 1775, Patrick Henry delivered his famous \\"Give me Liberty or Give me Death\\" speech in what is now known as St. John's Church, during the Second Virginia Convention. This speech helped convince members of Virginia's House of Burgesses (that Governor Dunmore had tried to dissolve in Williamsburg the previous year) to pass a resolution delivering Virginia troops to what became the American Revolutionary War. Another year later, the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, and the colonists' revolt became official (and Virginia's delegates in turn signed the resolution drafted by Thomas Jefferson upon a Virginia model). Jefferson became Virginia's governor during the war, although he had to flee British raiders and pass through Richmond several times. In 1780, Virginia's state capital was officially moved from Williamsburg to Richmond. During the war, British troops captured Williamsburg and often raided Virginia towns accessible by water (including Richmond). The worst raid to befall Richmond (a port city at the falls of the James River) occurred in 1781, when troops under the command of the turncoat Benedict Arnold burned Richmond and its neighboring port at Warwick. Yet Richmond recovered, and grew such that in May 1782, the Virginia General Assembly meeting in Richmond incorporated it as a city. In 1785, the General Assembly laid the cornerstone for the Virginia State Capitol, which Jefferson designed. Also that year, it chartered the James River Company, with soon-to-be U.S. President George Washington as its honorary corporate president, in part because Washington had advocated westward canal development. Development of the James River Canal (ultimately to connect to the Kanawha River across the Appalachian Mountains) ensued. This led to Richmond's further development as a commercial (and slave- trading) center. The first bridge across the James River, named Mayo's Bridge after the town's founder, was built in 1787. The General Assembly passed the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, which Jefferson had drafted in 1779, in Richmond on January 16, 1786, which is now commemorated annually as National Religious Freedom Day. From 1785 to 1787, the oldest Masonic Hall in America still in continuous use was constructed on Franklin Street between 18th and 19th Streets in downtown Richmond. Virginia ratified the proposed U.S. Constitution on June 26, 1788, after a tumultuous and nearly month-long Virginia Ratifying Convention in Richmond. This averted the potential problem of a geographical split between states previously ratifying the document which created a stronger national government than in the previous Articles of Confederation. The Virginia Ratifying Convention also recommended adoption of a Bill of Rights modeled on one previously adopted in the Commonwealth, as eventually occurred on December 15, 1791. ==19th century== ===1800–1860: Antebellum period=== Depiction of the Richmond Theatre fire of 1811 For much of the 19th century, the institution of slavery shaped several local issues. Shockoe Bottom became a center for slave trading in the years after Congress prohibited the US-African Slave Trade in 1808. It is believed that between 1800 and 1865, 300,000 slaves were sent from Virginia, a majority of them from Richmond's Shockoe Bottom markets and auctions, to work in the deep south. The first cemetery dedicated expressly for negroes and slaves basis by the city of Richmond was in Shockoe Bottom and was noted on the 1809 Plan of Richmond as the \\"Burial Ground for Negroes\\". A historic marker at 15th and E. Broad overlooks the area to the north where the burying ground once existed. In 1810 free Black Richmonders petitioned for a new site, and in 1816 the Shockoe Bottom cemetery was closed and two new burying grounds were opened, The \\"Burying Ground for Free People of Colour\\", and the \\"Burying Ground for Negroes (Slaves)\\". Both plots consisted of one acre each and were located directly east of the Jew's Burying Ground (Hebrew Cemetery) on the opposite side of 5th St. at what is now Hospital St. It was established within the 28 1/2 acre city of Richmond Property on which the Poorhouse was located on Shockoe Hill. An extension of the original two acres was made before 1835, and again in 1850 that grew the burial ground to as many as 15 acres. It appears on the 1853 Map of Henrico County as the \\"African Burying Ground\\". This cemetery the \\"Shockoe Hill African Burying Ground\\", is also presently referred to as the \\"2nd African Burial Ground\\" or \\"second African Burying Ground\\"; it was a segregated part of the \\"Shockoe Hill Burying Ground\\" also known as the Shockoe Hill Cemetery. It is likely the largest burial ground for enslaved and free people of colour in the United States, with over 22,000 interments estimated. This burial ground has no historical marker, or signage of any kind. In the current records it is presently mis-defined, and on the surface it is invisible. It has suffered numerous atrocities over time, and to this day continues to be threatened. Following the Haitian Revolution of the late 18th century (1791-1804), slaveowners were faced with the prospect of similar slave uprisings in the American British Colonies. A thwarted major uprising known most popularly as Gabriel's Rebellion, occurred near Richmond in 1800. This uprising was rumored to have involved 1000–4000 free and enslaved Africans living in the Richmond-Henrico-Chesterfield-Dinwiddie-Caroline- Hanover areas, and perhaps as far southeast along the James River as Norfolk. By the start of the 19th century, the city's population had reached 5,730. Several other important events took place in Richmond early in the century, including the designation of Jefferson, Madison and Monroe as Richmond's first political districts in 1803; the charter of the Bank of Virginia, the city's first bank, was signed in 1804; and the first public library was established by the Library Society of Richmond in 1806. The first stagecoach lines to Richmond were established during the War of 1812, and the first regular steamboat service began on the James River in 1815. In 1816, the first City Hall was built. Industrial revolution Tredegar Iron Works, along the banks of the James River, in Richmond, Virginia. In the 1830s, the Industrial Revolution arrived in Richmond. In 1831, the Chesterfield Railroad Company opened its horse-drawn rail line between Manchester and the Chesterfield coal mines, just south of the city. In 1833, Rhys Davies, an engineer from Tredegar, South Wales, was hired by Richmond businessmen and industrialists to construct furnaces and rolling mills used in the iron and foundry business. By 1837 the rolling mills were merged with the Virginia Foundry, creating Tredegar Iron Works, the largest foundry in the South and the third-largest in the United States. The first steam locomotive service to the city began with the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad in 1836. Other railroads followed: the Richmond and Danville Railroad was chartered in 1847, and completed the circuit to Danville, Virginia by 1854. In 1838, the Medical College of Virginia was founded in the city. Besides transportation and industry, antebellum Richmond was also the center of regional communications, with several newspapers and book publishers, including John Warrock, helping shape public opinion and further the education of the populace. The aversion to the slave trade was growing by the mid-19th century, and in 1848, Henry \\"Box\\" Brown made history by having himself nailed into a small box and shipped from Richmond to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, escaping slavery to the land of freedom. ===1861–1865: The Civil War=== Map of Richmond during the war In February 1861, Jefferson Davis was inaugurated as President of the Confederate States of America in Montgomery, Alabama. Two months after Davis' inauguration, the Confederate army fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, and the Civil War had begun. With the outbreak of war, followed by Virginia's secession in May 1861, the strategic location of the Tredegar Iron Works was one of the primary factors in the decision to relocate the capital of the Confederacy to Richmond. From this arsenal came much of the Confederates' heavy ordnance machinery, making 723 tons of armor plating that covered the CSS Virginia, the world's first ironclad used in the two-day Battle of Hampton Roads in March 1862, against the USS Monitor. In 1862, the Peninsula Campaign, led by General George B. McClellan, was a Union attempt to take Richmond, beginning from Union-held Fort Monroe at the eastern tip of the Virginia Peninsula at Old Point Comfort. Efforts to take Richmond by the James River were successfully blocked by Confederate defenses at Drewry's Bluff, about downstream from Richmond. The Union march up the Peninsula by land culminated in the Seven Days Battles. Ruses to make the defending forces seem larger by General John B. Magruder, Richmond's defensive line of batteries and fortifications set up under General Robert E. Lee, a daring ride around the Union Army by Confederate cavalry under General J.E.B. Stuart, and an unexpected appearance of General Stonewall Jackson's famous \\"foot cavalry\\" combined to unnerve the ever-cautious McClellan, and he initiated a Union retreat before Richmond. Even as other portions of the South were falling, the failure of the Peninsula Campaign to take Richmond led to almost three more years of bitter and bloody warfare between the states. Bread riots in Richmond On April 2, 1863, the city was beset by a large bread riot as housewives could no longer afford very high food prices and broke into stores. The militia was called out.Michael B. Chesson, \\"Harlots or Heroines? A New Look at the Richmond Bread Riot.\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 92#2 (1984): 131-175. in JSTOR After a long siege, Union General Ulysses S. Grant captured nearby Petersburg in April 1865. As the fall of Petersburg became imminent, on Evacuation Sunday (April 2), President Davis, his cabinet, and the Confederate defenders abandoned Richmond, and fled south on the last open railroad line, the Richmond and Danville.http://www.vmi.edu/uploadedfiles/archives/manuscripts/00285weisiger/weisiger_fulltext_original.pdf The retreating Confederate soldiers received orders to set fire to bridges, the armory, and warehouses as they left. The fires spread out of control, and destroyed large parts of the city, reaching to the very edge of Capitol Square mostly unchecked. At dawn, Richmond's mayor and other civilians went to the Union lines east of Richmond on New Market Road (now State Route 5) and surrendered the city; Union troops entered and eventually quenched the flames.John A. Campbell, Recollections of the Evacuation of Richmond (Baltimore: John H. Murphy Co, 1880), available at http://www.supremecourthistory.org/assets/schs_publications-evacuation- richmond.pdf Shells of the buildings of Richmond, silhouetted against a dark sky after the destruction by Confederates, 1865. On April 4, President Abraham Lincoln toured the fallen city by foot with his young son Tad, and visited the former White House of the Confederacy and the Virginia State Capitol. Arriving as fires set by the retreating Confederates still smoldered, Lincoln went to the White House of the Confederacy, expecting a communication from the retreating forces. Some wanted him to make a public gesture of sitting at Jefferson Davis's own desk, symbolically saying to the nation that the President of the United States held authority over the entire land. Citizens and freed slaves greeted Lincoln as a conquering hero. One admirer reportedly said, \\"I know I am free, for I have seen the face of Father Abraham and have felt him.\\" When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, Lincoln replied, \\"Let 'em up easy.\\" In the meantime, the governor and top officials relocated briefly to Danville. About a week after Richmond's evacuation, Robert E. Lee surrendered to Grant, ending the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse. Within the same week, on April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was assassinated at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. by John Wilkes Booth. Northern leadership would deal much more harshly with the fallen states than Lincoln had planned. On May 25, 1865, Francis Harrison Pierpont of Fairmont, West Virginia, moved the seat of government of \\"restored\\" Virginia from Alexandria back to Richmond. The Virginia General Assembly was once again located in the State House in Richmond. During President Andrew Johnson's administration, Governor Pierpont was replaced as Governor on April 4, 1868, by General Henry H. Wells of New York, who was formerly under the command of Brever Major General John Schofield. Pierpont and his family returned home to Fairmont.Ambler, Charles H. Francis H. Pierpont: Union War Governor of Virginia and Father of West Virginia. University of North Carolina Press: Raleigh, 1937. ===1865–1880: Reconstruction and City growth=== The Donnan Block (1866), constructed in the ashes of the Evacuation Fire. In 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery. Richmond (and the South's) Reconstruction began. Richmond's Theological School for Freedmen, later becoming Virginia Union University, was established that year. (Today, the historic campus is located on Lombardy Street just north of the downtown area). In 1866, the first organized Memorial Day was celebrated in Richmond at Oakwood Cemetery near Church Hill on the Nine Mile Road. Many fallen Confederate troops were buried there and at Hollywood Cemetery, just west of the Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond. In 1869, the segregated public school system was started in the city. Black voters registered in the city's first municipal election since the end of the Civil War. One year later, Virginia was readmitted to the Union with a new Constitution and federal troops were removed from the city. 1870 has been called the Year of Disasters: the worst flood in 100 years occurred; overcrowding during a court hearing over Richmond's elections collapsed the third floor of the Virginia State Capitol, causing it to fall into the Hall of the House of Delegates, killing 60 and injuring 250; Robert E. Lee's death in Lexington, where he headed what is now Washington and Lee University, compounded grief, followed by the Spotswood Hotel fire, killing eight people. Over the next decade, the city's first high school, Richmond High School, opened in 1873. Cigarette manufacturing was introduced in Richmond by P.H. Mayo & Bros. Tobacco Co. in 1874, further expanding the city's economic importance to the tobacco industry. The last federal troops were removed from the South in 1877, and Reconstruction ended. Virginia politics underwent many power struggles in the 1870s and 1880s. Conservatives split over repayment of the state's pre-war debt. \\"Funders\\" wanted the full amount to be paid, much of which was held by northern interests. \\"Readjusters\\" wanted a portion to be paid by the new State of West Virginia, and formed the Readjuster Party, a coalition of Republicans, conservative Democrats, and free blacks led by railroad executive William Mahone. Mahone was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he served from 1881 to 1887, and the Readjuster's candidate, William E. Cameron, was elected as Virginia's governor, serving from 1882 to 1886. However, by 1883, Democrats were assuming power in state politics, which they held about 80 years, until the fall of the Byrd Organization in the late 1960s, following the death of former Governor and U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd in 1966. ===1880–1900: Monument Avenue, streetcars=== Richmond's population had reached 60,600 by 1880, and the James River and Kanawha Canal closed with tracks of the Richmond and Allegheny Railroad of Major James H. Dooley laid on its towpath. In 1885, the Robert E. Lee Camp Soldiers Home for Confederate Veterans opened. Monument Avenue was laid out in 1890, and would over the next several decades be gradually adorned with a series of monuments at various intersections honoring the city's Confederate heroes. Included (east to west) were J.E.B. Stuart, Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, Stonewall Jackson, and Matthew F. Maury. (The westernmost monument, honoring Richmond native and tennis star Arthur Ashe, was added in 1996.) Highland Park and other neighborhoods developed with the advent of the streetcar lines. Richmond had the first successful electrically powered trolley system in the United States. Designed by electric power pioneer, Frank J. Sprague, the trolley system opened its first line in January, 1888. Richmond's hills, long a transportation obstacle, were considered an ideal proving ground. The new technology soon replaced horsecars. As part of a national trend, in the late 19th century and early 20th century, the electrically powered street railway systems accelerated Richmond's expansion. To generate traffic and fuel sales of property, amusement parks were created at the end of the lines at Lakeside Park, Westhampton Park (now University of Richmond), and Forest Hill Park. The Richmond area's streetcar suburbs included Highland Park, Barton Heights, Ginter Park, Woodland Heights, and Highland Springs. Rails of interurban streetcar services formed a suburban network from Richmond extending north to Ashland and south to Chester, Colonial Heights, Petersburg and Hopewell. Another interurban route ran east along the Nine Mile Road and terminated at the Seven Pines National Cemetery at the end of the Nine Mile Road, where many Union Civil War dead were interred. Electrically powered trolleybuses, also using the Sprague technology, later operated in local service in nearby Petersburg for several years. Also at this time, many of Richmond's inner city neighborhoods began to grow rapidly, such as the Fan District, and Church Hill. In 1894, a new City Hall was built in Victorian Gothic style. The building, now called the \\"Old City Hall\\", is located just north of Capitol Square near the statue of Dr. Hunter Holmes McGuire. It is across the Broad Street from the current Richmond City Hall, which was built in 1971. In 1896, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that, \\"separate but equal\\" laws did not deprive blacks of civil rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Confederate Museum opened and the National Confederate Reunion (the first of five) was held in Richmond. One year later the Richmond Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy was established. ==20th century== An Emancipation Day celebration on Main Street, ca. 1905 ===1900–1930=== Former city flag of Richmond, dating from the 1910s. By the beginning of the 20th century, the city's population had reached 85,050. The theater mogul, Jake Wells, built a number of vaudeville theaters and opera houses in Richmond during the early 20th century. Other theaters and opera houses open on what became \\"Theater Row\\", to include The Bijou, the Colonial Theater, The Lyric Opera House. In 1903, African-American businesswoman and financier Maggie L. Walker chartered St. Luke Penny Savings Bank, and served as its first president, as well as the first female (of any race) bank president in the United States. Today, the bank is called the Consolidated Bank and Trust Company, and it is the oldest surviving African- American bank in the U.S. Merger with Manchester For over 250 years, the James River divided Richmond on the north bank from its sister, independent city of Manchester, located on the south bank. A major issue for Manchester and Richmond residents in the 19th century and early 20th century were the toll bridges over the James River. In 1910, Manchester agreed to a political consolidation with the much larger independent city of Richmond. Richmond's better-known name was used for both areas as it contained the location of Virginia's state capital. Key features of the consolidation agreement were requirements that a \\"free bridge\\" across the James River and a separate courthouse in Manchester be maintained indefinitely. Instead of a barrier between neighboring cities, under the consolidation the James River became the centerpiece of the expanded Richmond. Although Manchester is now defunct as an independent city, vestiges of the name can be found in the Manchester Bridge, Manchester Slave Trail, and the Manchester Courthouse. World War and the Roaring Twenties Broad Street in the 1920s. In 1914, Richmond became the headquarters of the Fifth District of the Federal Reserve Bank. It was selected due to the city's geographic location, its importance as a commercial and financial center, its transportation and communications facilities, as well as Virginia's leading regional role in the banking business. The bank was originally located near the federal courts downtown and moved to a new headquarters building near the Capitol in 1922 (today the Supreme Court of Virginia building), and finally to its present location overlooking the James River in 1978.\\"Richmond Federal Reserve Bank History.\\" RichmondFed.org. Retrieved on January 20, 2010. In 1919, at the end of World War I, Philip Morris was established in the city. . Richmond entered the broadcasting era in late 1925 when WRVA, originally known as the Edgeworth Tobacco Station and owned by Larus & Brothers, went on the air. The white ballad singers and black gospel quartets that were popular on the radio at the time were often urban and sometimes even professional men. At the time, Richmond was particularly self-conscious with its southern roots, and such music was seen as culturally inferior.Tyler-McGraw, Marie. \\"At the Falls: Richmond, Virginia, and Its People.\\" Published 1994, UNC Press, p. 257. Also during the 1920s, Richmond's entertainment venues developed further. In 1926, The Mosque (now called the Altria Theater) was constructed by the Shriners as their Acca Temple Shrine, and since then, many of America's greatest entertainers have appeared on its stage beneath its towering minarets and desert murals.Staff Writer. \\"Richmond's Landmark Theater.\\" Virginia.Org.

Loew's Theater was built in 1927, and was described as, \\"the ultimate in 1920s movie palace fantasy design.\\" It later suffered a decline in popularity as the movie-going population moved to the suburbs, but was restored during the 1980s and renamed as the Carpenter Center for the Performing Arts.Renouf, Norman; Renouf, Kathy. \\"Romantic Weekends.\\" Published 1999, Hunter Publishing, Inc. p. 42. In 1928, the Byrd Theater was built by local architect Fred Bishop on Westhampton Avenue (now called Cary Street) in a residential area of the city. To this day, the Byrd remains in operation as one of the last of the great movie palaces of the 1920s and 1930s.Trader, Carly. \\"A Grand Old House.\\" Inside Richmond. September 15, 1992. Retrieved on July 11, 2007. In 1926, the Carillon in Byrd Park was constructed as a memorial to the World War I dead. The Carillon still towers above Byrd Park in the city. In 1927, the dedication of Byrd Airfield (now Richmond International Airport) included a visit by Charles Lindbergh. The airport was named after Richard E. Byrd, the famous American polar explorer. The John Marshall Hotel opened its doors in October 1929. Model Tobacco factory was built along Route 1 in south Richmond ===1930–1945: Great Depression and World War II=== The Tobacco industry helped Richmond recover from the Great Depression. Within five years, Richmond's economy bounced back. Richmond attracted businesses relocating from other parts of the country as one of the northernmost cities of the right-to-work states. The population of the city had grown to 255,426 by 1936, and the value of new construction to the region was 250% over that of 1935. By 1938, Reynolds Metals moved its executive office from New York City to Richmond. By the end of World War II in 1945, more than 350,000,000 pounds of war supplies were being shipped through the Defense General Supply Center, located nine miles (14 km) south of the city. 1946 marked a crucial turning point for Richmond's economy. During that year, the highest level of business activity was recorded in the history of the city. Within one year, Richmond was the fastest growing industrial center in the United States. ===1945–1960: Postwar Richmond and Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike=== In 1948, Oliver Hill became the first black person elected to the city council since the Reconstruction era. Also in 1948, WTVR-TV, the \\"south's first television station\\" began broadcasting in Richmond. Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike under construction, bisecting Jackson Ward As roads improved in the early 20th century, streetcars were unable to compete with automobiles and buses. The Richmond-Petersburg area's interurban services were gone by 1939. The last streetcars ran in 1949 on the Highland Park line when they were replaced by buses. As the National Auto Trails system grew into a national network of highways, the area was served by the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway the busy north–south corridor in central Virginia shared by U.S. 1 and U.S. Route 301 through the cities of Richmond, Colonial Heights, and Petersburg. It crossed the James River on the Robert E. Lee Memorial Bridge. After World War II, with only four traffic lanes and long stretches of undivided roadway, the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway became a major area of traffic congestion, as well as the site of occasional spectacular and deadly head-on collisions. In 1955, prior to the creation of the U.S. Interstate Highway System, the Virginia General Assembly created the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike Authority as a state agency to administer the new Turnpike of the same name. The new toll road was planned with only 15 exits, and most of these were well away from the highly developed commercial areas along parallel U.S. 301. The Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike opened in 1958, and soon was granted the Interstate 95 designation in the Richmond area, splitting into Interstates 85 and 95 at Petersburg. The turnpike disrupted the urban fabric of central Richmond and the Jackson Ward neighborhood. ===1960–2000: Modern city development=== In the 1980s, the James Center was built on what was previously the Canal Basin, later a railroad yard. Natural gas was introduced to Richmond in 1950 to meet the growing energy demand. By 1952, cigarette production reached an all-time high for Richmond at 110 billion per year. Between 1963 and 1965, there was a huge, \\"downtown boom,\\" that led to the construction of more than 700 buildings in the city. In 1968, Virginia Commonwealth University was created by the merger of the Medical College of Virginia with the Richmond Professional Institute. Richmond suffered some severe flooding in 1972, when Hurricane Agnes dumped of rain on central Virginia. This flooded the James River to over the original 200-year-old record. In 1984, the city completed the Diamond ballpark, and the Richmond Braves, a AAA baseball team for the Atlanta Braves, began playing. Also in 1985, Richmond saw the opening of 6th Street Marketplace, a downtown festival marketplace, which was envisioned as a solution to the downtown area's urban erosion. The project ultimately failed, and the shopping center was closed and demolished in 2004.Ward, Mike. \\"6th Street to be torn down?\\" richmond.com. September 26, 2001. Retrieved on January 20, 2010. In 1990, Richmond native L. Douglas Wilder, the grandson of slaves, was sworn in as Governor of Virginia, the first elected African- American governor of any state in United States history. A multimillion-dollar floodwall was completed in 1995, in order to protect the city and the Shockoe Bottom businesses from the rising waters of the James River. Also during 1995, a statue of Richmond native and tennis star Arthur Ashe was added to the famed series of statues on Monument Avenue. Notwithstanding objections of purists in the country, Ashe was added to a group of statues that previously had consisted primarily of prominent Confederate military figures, as a sign of the changing nature of the city's population. Richmond skyline at the turn of the 21st century ==21st century== === 2000–present=== Richmond at night By the early 21st century, the population of the greater Richmond metropolitan area had reached approximately 1,100,000 although the population of the city itself had declined to less than 200,000. The floodwall downtown was expanded, and opened the doors for the development of the riverfront, stretching along the James River from the historic Tredegar Iron Works site, just west of 7th Street, to 17th Street downtown. Recent renovations included the rebuilt James River and Kanawha Canal and Haxall Canal, now designed as a Canal Walk. The riverfront project has brought this corridor back to life, with trendy loft apartments, restaurants, shops and hotels winding along the Canal Walk, along with canal boat cruises and walking tours. The National Park Service's Richmond Civil War Visitor Center, in the Tredegar Iron Works, brought three floors of exhibits and artifacts, films, a bookstore, picnic areas and more. Virginia Commonwealth University has also been aggressively developing its campuses downtown, with the new Stuart C. Siegel Center athletic complex, and RAMZ apartments. In 2002, the new, expanded Greater Richmond Convention Center opened for business, containing more than . The convention center, located in the heart of downtown Richmond, is the largest of its kind in the state. Renovation continues in the historic neighborhood of Jackson Ward, to bring the neighborhood off the National Trust Historic Preservation's list of one of America's most endangered historic places. Encompassing forty blocks, Jackson Ward was once deemed the \\"Black Wall Street\\" and the \\"Harlem of the South\\" in the 19th century. Restaurants such as Croaker's Spot and attractions like the Black History Museum and Cultural Center, keep Jackson Ward on the list as one of the Richmond area's most culturally significant stops for visitors to the area. On September 19, 2003, Hurricane Isabel's sustained winds of caused major power outages in the area. A year later, in September 2004, Tropical Storm Gaston swept through the area, bringing with it intense rain, causing severe flooding in the Shockoe Bottom business district, as well as major electrical outages throughout the metropolitan area.Crocker, Robb. \\"Gaston Aftermath.\\" September 2, 2004. Retrieved on January 20, 2010. On August 31, 2004, the Shockoe Bottom district was devastated by flooding brought on by torrential rains from the remnants of Tropical Storm Gaston. The storm lingered over the Richmond area, dumping nearly 12 inches (300 mm) of rain in the Shockoe Bottom watershed which then backed up behind the James River flood wall. A 20-block area, including most of Shockoe Bottom, was declared uninhabitable in the wake of the flood. The \\"Bottom\\" has recovered as a major restaurant and night club district after changes to the area's sewage system were made to prevent a re-occurrence. On November 2, 2004, former Virginia governor L. Douglas Wilder was elected as Richmond's first directly elected mayor in over 60 years. In 2008, the AAA baseball Richmond Braves left Richmond for Gwinnett County, Georgia, due to the lack of agreement from Richmond area governments to finance the construction of a new ballpark. They were replaced in 2010 with the Richmond Flying Squirrels, the Double-A affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. In the 2010 census the population in Richmond finally grew for the first time in 40 years due to revitalization of places like Shockoe Bottom, and rapid gentrification of neighborhoods like The Fan and The Museum District, Church Hill, Jackson Ward, and in more recent years, Manchester. ==See also== * Timeline of Richmond, Virginia, history *National Register of Historic Places listings in Richmond, Virginia *History of Virginia * List of newspapers in Virginia in the 18th-century: Richmond ==References== ==Further reading== ===General Histories=== * Dabney, Virginius.

Despite an approach from Strange to defect to the Royalists, Rosworm completed the town's makeshift fortifications on 23 September 1642. The siege began the following day and the town was defended until Strange's withdrawal on 1 October. Rosworm marshalled a counter-attack against the Royalists, capturing Leigh as a base for Parliamentarian forces in Lancashire. Now made Lieutenant Colonel in Ralph Ashton's regiment, he organised the fortification of Preston, following its capture on 9 February 1643. His original contract with Manchester having ended, he was retained on an annual salary of £60, forgoing his commission from Ashton and committing himself to the garrison in Manchester, improving its fortification. During service in the capture of Wigan, Rosworm claimed that Colonel Richard Holland had endangered his safety but Holland escaped censure owing to his strong political influence. A bitter enmity lingered between the two men. Rosworm was in action in the assault on Warrington and in the fortification of Liverpool before returning to Manchester, then under threat of attack by the William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle. Rosworm's strategy included defences as far afield as Blackstone Edge and Blackgate in the Pennines above Manchester. Newcastle thought better of his plan. Rosworm subsequently fought with Sir Thomas Fairfax at Nantwich and Sir John Meldrum at Liverpool as director of the siege to regain the town. Liverpool was won by Parliament on 1 November 1644. The years 1644 and 1645 saw renewed approaches from the Royalist faction, friction with Holland and increasing pay arrears. The Manchester townspeople petitioned parliament to help Rosworm's financial situation but to no avail. By 1648, Rosworm was in financially straitened circumstances and he visited London to press his cause. Over the next decade he enjoyed sporadic and reluctant reward from the people of Manchester, though he had firmly established his family there. In reply to his repeated petitions of parliament, in 1651, he was rewarded with a post in New Yarmouth to oversee preparations for defence against feared enemy landings. He was subsequently appointed engineer-general for England. After being appointed engineer-general of the army on 19 July 1659, there is no further record of him. It is thought that he died in exile following the Restoration. ==References== ;Attribution * Category:Roundheads Category:Dutch military engineers Category:German military engineers Category:British military engineers Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:17th-century German engineers ","title":"John Rosworm"},{"id":"1441665","text":"Matthew George Millen (born March 12, 1958) is a former American football linebacker and executive.

Millen assembled the personnel and coaching staff of the 2008 Lions, which became the first team to go 0–16. This was the worst single-season record in league history until it was tied by the 2017 Cleveland Browns.

You'll figure it out.\\" Millen was the Lions' CEO for seven full seasons, from 2001–07; during that time, the club compiled a record of 31–81 (with at least nine losses each season). Detroit's .277 winning percentage was among the worst ever compiled by an NFL team over a seven-year period; only the Chicago Cardinals of 1939-45 (10-61-3, .141) and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of 1983–1989 (26–86, .234) were less successful.

Sullivan said the punch made him \\"see stars\\" and that he required stitches. Millen later called the incident \\"a good hit\\". In December 2003, following a Lions 45–17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium, Millen came under fire after a postgame incident with former Lions and then-Chiefs wide receiver Johnnie Morton. Millen tried to congratulate some of the Chiefs players near the Chiefs locker room, when he confronted Morton, who claimed that he wasn't going to say anything to Millen. When he walked by him, Millen said, \\"Hey Johnnie.\\" Morton ignored him, and then Millen replied, \\"Nice talking to you\\", and Morton replied \\"Kiss my ass.\\" That's when Millen shouted, \\"You faggot! Yeah, you heard me. You faggot!\\" at Morton, which was heard by a member of the Chiefs public-relations staff and a Kansas City Star columnist. Millen apologized for the incident, and after he was informed of Millen's remarks, Morton replied, \\"I apologize for what I said, but I never expected anything like that. What he said is demeaning and bigoted.\\" There had been bad blood between the two since Morton was released by the Lions after the 2001 season, and Morton felt like Millen \\"tossed him aside.\\" On April 24, 2010, at the 2010 NFL Draft, Millen apparently referred to fellow ESPN commentator Ron Jaworski as a \\"Polack\\", after which he made an on-air apology, stating that he \\"didn't mean anything\\" by the remark. ==References== ==External links== * Matt Millen NFL statistics at databasefootball.com.

He played for the Washington Redskins and San Diego Chargers (now the Los Angeles Chargers) of the National Football League. He played high school football at Southwood High School and college football at Northeast Louisiana (now named the University of Louisiana at Monroe). He was selected by the Redskins in the sixth round of the 1988 NFL Draft. ==College career== Playing for Northeast Louisiana (now Louisiana–Monroe), Humphries was quarterback on the team that won the 1987 NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship Game. In two seasons, Humphries passed for 4,395 yards and 29 touchdowns. He still holds the record for 300-yard passing games with eight. ==Professional career== === Washington === Humphries was selected by the Redskins in the sixth round of the 1988 NFL Draft. He made his first pro start in 1990 in Phoenix against the Cardinals with regular starter Mark Rypien sidelined with an injury. Humphries went on to pass for 1,015 yards and three touchdowns in seven games in 1990. The following season, he won a Super Bowl ring with the Redskins as Rypien's backup. === San Diego === Humphries was traded to the San Diego Chargers before the start of the 1992 season following a preseason injury to starting Chargers QB John Friesz. The two teams ran the same offense, allowing Humphries to quickly make an impact. He passed for 3,356 yards, which ranked fifth in the league in 1992. He helped lead the Chargers, who were 4-12 in 1991 and stumbled out to an 0-4 start in 1992, to finish with an 11-5 record, winning the AFC West and ending the Chargers' decade-long playoff drought. To this day, the 1992 San Diego Chargers are the only NFL team to make the playoffs after an 0-4 start. He played with a separated left shoulder in the 1992 AFC Wild-Card Game, a 17-0 win over the Kansas City Chiefs, their first home playoff game since the 1980 AFC Championship game. Their season ended the next week in a 31-0 loss to the Miami Dolphins in the AFC Divisional Playoffs. In 1994, Humphries led the Chargers with clutch performances through an impressive series of victories in the NFL Playoffs. It started with the Chargers rallying from a 21-6 halftime deficit at home to defeat the Miami Dolphins (led by Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino) with a 22-21 victory in the AFC divisional playoffs, earning the Chargers a trip to the AFC Championship Game the next week at Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Steelers were favored by 10 points, and some Steeler players the week prior to the game had made a Super Bowl rap video, assuming they would be the ones going to the Super Bowl. In what would become one of pro football's all-time great upsets, the Chargers again rallied from a 13-3 deficit late in the 3rd quarter and held off a furious last-minute Pittsburgh drive with a goal-line stand to win the AFC championship 17-13 at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium. Thus the Chargers earned a trip to Miami and Super Bowl XXIX, the first and only Super Bowl appearance in franchise history. Humphries executed the first successful two-point conversion in the Super Bowl (which was adopted by the NFL at the start of the 1994 season), throwing a pass to Mark Seay. They were greeted by 70,000 fans at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium upon arriving back from Pittsburgh. Despite losing Super Bowl XXIX to the San Francisco 49ers 49-26, more than 100,000 fans greeted the Chargers when they arrived back in San Diego after the game. In 1997, Humphries was forced to retire after a series of concussions. During his career, he led the Chargers to three playoff appearances and the franchise's only Super Bowl appearance. Humphries started for San Diego for six years, making 81 starts in 88 games while completing 1,431 of 2,516 passes for 17,191 yards and 89 touchdowns. San Diego was 47-29 (62 percent) in regular-season games and 3-3 in playoff contests he started from 1992 to 1997. He was inducted into the San Diego Chargers Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2009, he was one of four quarterbacks named on the franchise's 50th anniversary team. In 2004, Humphries was also inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface. He was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. === Post-playing career === Humphries is currently a commentator for college football. He also hosts his namesake celebrity golf tournament, which has raised more than $1 million over the years for Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego. ==References== Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:American football quarterbacks Category:Louisiana–Monroe Warhawks football players Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:Washington Redskins players Category:Super Bowl champions Category:Sportspeople from Natchitoches, Louisiana Category:Sportspeople from Shreveport, Louisiana Category:Players of American football from Louisiana ","title":"Stan Humphries"},{"id":"1441680","text":"The Morning Journal is a daily newspaper based in Lorain, Ohio.

Caspar studied painting in Amersfoort with the relatively obscure Thomas Jansz van Veenendaal for 4 or 5 years and then with the better known Matthias Withoos for 7 years.Caspar van Wittel at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Piazza Navona, Rome His first extant works were made in Hoorn in 1672 to where he had fled after the French invasion and occupation of Amersfoort in the Rampjaar.Caspar van Wittel's jeugdjaren on website dedicated to Caspar van Wittel He returned to Amersfoort where he was active until 1674, the year in which he left for Italy together with his friend Jacob van Staverden, another pupil of Withoos.Jacob van Staverden at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Like his former teacher Withoos, he joined the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome. His nickname in the Bentveughels was \\"Piktoors\\" (Pitch-torch) or \\"Toorts van Amersfoort\\" (Torch of Amersfoort).Gasper van Wittel gebentnaamt de Toorts van Amersfoort in Arnold Houbraken's Schouburg He was also nicknamed ‘Gasparo dagli Occhiali’ (Gaspare with the spectacles). He worked in Rome together with the Flemish painter Abraham Genoels and may even have been his pupil. Other collaborators included Hendrik Frans van Lint who would become one of the leading vedute painters in the first half of the 18th century.Edgar Peters Bowron, Joseph J. Rishel, Art in Rome in the Eighteenth Century, Philadelphia Museum of Art; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, 2000, p. 236-237 View of the Tiber in Rome In 1697 van Wittel married Anna Lorenzani. His first son Luigi was born in 1700. Luigi became a famous architect and used the italianized family name of Vanvitelli. A second son was born in 1702. Van Wittel spent almost all his life in Italy where he arrived in 1674 and died in 1736. He lived mainly in Rome but, particularly between 1694 and 1710, he also toured the country and painted in Florence, Bologna, Ferrara, Venice, Milan, Piacenza, Urbino, and Naples. He became member of the Accademia di San Luca in Rome in 1711. He made his last dated work in 1730. ==Work== View of the Piazzetta from St Mark's Basin Van Wittel is one of the principal painters of topographical views known as vedute. He is credited with turning topography into a painterly specialism in Italian art. He may have been influenced by the drawings of the Flemish draughtsman Lieven Cruyl who had produced a series of cityscapes of Rome in the 1660s.Robert C. Smith, The Ruins of RomeEgbert Haverkamp-Begemann, Sir John Wyndham Pope-Hennessy. Fifteenth- to Eighteenth- century European Drawings: Central Europe, the Netherlands, France, England, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1999, p. 280 He is also considered to have influenced one of the major Italian vedutisti, the Venetian painter Canaletto. Some of the views he painted during his visit to Venice around 1697 anticipate Canaletto in their perspective layout and in the angle in which the scene is presented. An example is the View of the Piazzetta from St Mark's Basin (Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome). When van Wittel first arrived in Rome he drew 50 drawings illustrating the Dutch hydraulic engineer Cornelis Meyer's designs for restoring navigability to the River Tiber between Rome and Perugia.Facsimile of the L'Arte di restituire a Roma la tralasciata navigatione del suo Tevere His first vedute also originated from his collaboration with Meyer, who used drawings by van Wittel to illustrate one of his tracts with a series of engraved Roman views. Van Wittel used some of these drawings for tempera and oil vedute dating from the early 1680s. His style of vedute was formed about 10 years later. Crypta Neapolitana His work developed from that of the Dutch Italianate painters, whose work incorporated Roman ruins and other Roman sights. Their paintings always placed architecture within the surrounding landscape. Van Wittel's approach was derived from this and as result his views show buildings from a distance. He showed large architectural complexes in an overall view. His work should therefore be seen as a mixture of landscape and urban architecture painting rather than simple vedute. It is possible that he relied on the aid of a camera obscura in drawing his vedute. His compositional and perspectival principles remained the same from the 1690s, only the subject matter changed.Ludovica Trezzani. \\"Wittel, Gaspar van.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 23 February 2017 His work was very popular with travellers on their Grand Tour of Italy. Thomas Coke, the future 1st Earl of Leicester and builder of Holkham Hall, Norfolk, acquired at least seven vedute by van Wittel during his Grand Tour in the years 1715 and 1716.John Wilton-Ely. \\"Veduta.\\" Grove Art Online.

Structural unemployment is often brought about by technological changes that make the job skills of many workers obsolete. Structural unemployment is one of three categories of unemployment distinguished by economists, the others being frictional unemployment and cyclical unemployment. Because it requires either migration or re-training, structural unemployment can be long-term and slow to fix. == Causes and examples == From an individual perspective, structural unemployment can be due to: * Inability to afford or decision not to pursue further education or job training. * Choice of a field of study which did not produce marketable job skills. * Inability to afford relocation. * Inability to relocate due to inability to sell a house (for example due to the collapse of a real estate bubble or of the local economy). * Decision not to relocate, in order to stay with a spouse, family, friends, etc.Mismatch Unemployment, Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report No. 566, June 2013; accessed 2016-06-17] From a larger perspective, there can be a number of reasons for structural unemployment across large numbers of workers: * Technological obsolescence makes a specific expertise useless. For example, demand for manual typesetters disappeared with digitization of printing plate production. * Productivity increases reduce the number of workers (with the same or similar skills) needed to satisfy demand. * New technology significantly increases productivity, but requires a smaller number of higher- skilled workers. For example, fewer agricultural workers are needed when the work is mechanized; those that remain must be trained to operate equipment. Another common example is the use of industrial robots to automate manufacturing. A study by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne found in 2013 that almost half of U.S jobs are at risk of automation. * Competition causes the same jobs to move to a different location, and workers do not or cannot follow. Examples: ** Manufacturing jobs in the United States moved from what are now called Rust Belt cities to lower-cost cities in the South and rural areas. ** Globalization has caused many manufacturing jobs to move from high- wage to low-wage countries. ** Free trade agreements can cause jobs to move as competitive advantage changes. * Political changes, for example the collapse of the Soviet Union. Large-scale changes in the economy can be particularly challenging. For example, if a large company is the only employer in a given industry for a certain city, when it closes workers will have no competing company to move to, and the local education system and government will be burdened with many people who need job re-training all at once (possibly at the same time the local economy fails to create new jobs due to decreased overall demand). Employers may also reject workers for reasons unrelated to skills or geography, so for example structural unemployment can also result from discrimination. While temporary changes in overall demand for labor cause cyclical unemployment, structural unemployment can be caused by temporary changes in demand from different industries. For example, seasonal unemployment often affects farm workers after harvesting is complete, and workers in resort towns after the tourist season ends. The dot-com bubble caused a temporary spike in demand for information technology workers, which was suddenly reversed in 2000–2001. Structural unemployment is often associated with workers being unable to shift from industry to industry, but it can also happen within industries as technology changes the nature of work within a given field.The structure of the structural unemployment question, Macroblog, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, April 9, 2012; accessed 2016-06-17Production Skills Gap, Burning Glass Technologies, Jan. 8, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17 This is a driver of skills gaps as technology and globalization \\"hollow out\\" many middle-skill jobs, positions that traditionally have not required a college degree.Bridge the Gap: Rebuilding America’s Middle Skills, Harvard Business School, Accenture, and Burning Glass Technologies, Nov. 14, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17 == Relation to other unemployment == Structural unemployment is hard to separate empirically from frictional unemployment, except to say that for any given individual it lasts longer. As with frictional unemployment, simple demand-side stimulus will not work to easily abolish this type of unemployment. Seasonal unemployment may be seen as a kind of structural unemployment, since it is a type of unemployment that is linked to certain kinds of jobs (construction work, migratory farm work). The most-cited official unemployment measures erase this kind of unemployment from the statistics using \\"seasonal adjustment\\" techniques. Structural unemployment may also be encouraged to rise by persistent cyclical unemployment: if an economy suffers from long-lasting low aggregate demand, it means that many of the unemployed become disheartened, while their skills (including job-searching skills) become \\"rusty\\" and obsolete.\\"Long-Term Unemployment,\\" Rockefeller Foundation, May 2016; accessed 2016-06-17 Problems with debt may lead to homelessness and a fall into the vicious circle of poverty. This means that they may not fit the job vacancies that are created when the economy recovers. The implication is that sustained high demand may lower structural unemployment.\\"Consequences of Long-Term Unemployment,\\" Urban Institute, Aug. 20, 2013; accessed 2016-06-17\\"Are the Long-Term Unemployed on the Margins of the Labor Market?\\" Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Brookings Institution, Spring 2014; accessed 2016-06-17 This theory of persistence in structural unemployment has been referred to as an example of path dependence or \\"hysteresis.\\" ==Debates== There has been considerable debate over how much a role structural unemployment plays in the persistently high unemployment rates seen in much of the world since the 2007-09 global recession. Narayana Kocherlakota, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said in a 2010 speech that as much as 3 percent of the 9.5 percent unemployment rate at the time could be the result of a mismatch.\\"Inside the FOMC,\\" President's Speeches, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Aug. 17, 2010; accessed 2016-06-17 Other studies argued that a skills mismatch was a minor factor, since unemployment rose for nearly all industries and demographic groups during the \\"Great Recession.\\"Lagging Demand, Not Unemployability, Is Why Long-term Unemployment Remains So High, Economic Policy Institute, Aug. 19, 2014; accessed 2016-06-17 A Federal Reserve Bank of New York study found no strong evidence of mismatch for construction workers, a group often alleged to be prone to structural unemployment because of the regional nature of construction.\\"Skills Mismatch, Construction Workers, and the Labor Market,\\" Liberty Street Economics blog, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, March 29, 2012; accessed 2016-06-17 Some economists posit that the minimum wage is in part to blame for structural unemployment, although structural unemployment does exist even in the absence of a minimum wage. They assert that because the governmentally imposed minimum wage is higher than some individuals' marginal revenue product in any given job, those individuals remain unemployed because employers legally cannot pay them what they are \\"worth.\\"Robert Schenk. CyberEconomics: “Overview: Resource Markets.” Accessed June 29, 2012 Others believe that in such cases (for example, when a person is intellectually disabled or suffers a debilitating physical condition) it is the responsibility of the state to provide for the citizen in question. When a minimum wage does not exist, more people may be employed, but they may be underemployed and thus unable to fully provide for themselves. Management professor Peter Cappelli blames poor human resource practices for complaints that not enough qualified job applicants are found, such as replacing skilled HR workers with software that is less capable of matching resumes that exhibit the right combination of skills but without word-for-word alignment with a job posting. (This actually may be a form of frictional unemployment if a match will eventually be made, perhaps with a different employer.) Cappelli also points to a decrease in apprenticeships and hiring from within an organization. Instead, companies attempt to avoid the time and cost of on-the- job training by hiring people from who already have experience doing the same job elsewhere (including at a competitor). ==See also== *Classical unemployment *Deindustrialization *Involuntary unemployment *Natural rate of unemployment *Jobless recovery *Post-industrial society *Reserve army of labour *Types of unemployment == References == == Bibliography == * * == Further reading == * Ganapati, Priya.

The song was released as a single in the UK on 27 June 1983 when it reached No. 77 in the charts and again on 2 December 1991 as a follow-up to the successful reissue of Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. In 2014 the song was featured in the live stage show Monty Python Live (Mostly) which was followed by another single release on 13 April 2015, this time in collaboration with Stephen Hawking. == Premise and synopsis == The song originally debuted during the comedy sketch \\"Live Organ Transplants\\". The paramedic (John Cleese), upon failing to persuade Mrs. Brown (Terry Jones) to donate her liver, opens the refrigerator doors to reveal a man wearing a pink morning suit (Eric Idle). The man accompanies Mrs. Brown through outer space singing various statistics about the galaxy. The upshot of the song (which follows a synthesized instrumental montage that, in the movie, is accompanied by a computer-animated picture of a woman being impregnated) is that in the grand scheme of the universe, the likelihood of Mrs. Brown's existence was almost zero, but that she should \\"pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space, 'cause there's bugger all down here on Earth\\". The singer returns to the refrigerator, at which point Mrs. Brown admits that the singer convinced her to hand over her liver. == Accuracy of astronomical figures == The lyrics include a number of astronomical quantities, the vast majority of which are accurate to within one or two significant figures. A few statements are only approximately correct or have liberties with definitions, likely to fit within the meter of the song. * Idle sings that the Earth is \\"revolving at nine hundred miles an hour\\". The current estimate for the rotational speed at the equator is 1040 miles/hr (1670 kilometers/hour). 900 miles is correct if this is given in nautical miles, but it is more common to speak of knots in this case. He gives the Earth's orbital speed as per second, which is accurate to two significant figures. 2.978589*10^4 m/s is 18.51 miles per second * Idle states that the Sun is \\"the source of all our power\\". In fact, three notable sources of electrical power are not directly traceable to the Sun: The first is geothermal power, which is derived from geothermal energy, 20% of which remains from the original planet formation and 80% of which is derived from ongoing radioactive decay. The second source is the Moon's effects on tides and the associated methods of power generation. The third is nuclear power derived from uranium and other fissile elements. Ultimately, however, the overwhelming proportion of human-generated power derived from fossil fuels and thence from photosynthetic plants makes this line a very good approximation to the truth. The three other power sources are available because of the Sun's influence on our early solar system, so Idle's statement is correct in a literal (if somewhat pedantic) sense, even if not for practical purposes. * Idle's figures for the size of the Milky Way galaxy are roughly correct. He understates the speed at which the Sun orbits the \\"galactic central point\\" by an order of magnitude (12 million miles a day compared to \\"1 million miles a day\\"), but he gives an estimate accurate to one significant figure for the total time per orbit. This is \\"two hundred million years\\" according to the song, compared with accepted figures of 220 to 250 million years. 483000 miles/hour = 11.5 million miles/day * The song says that we are \\"thirty thousand light years from galactic central point\\", again correct to within one significant figure of 25,000 light years from the centre of the Milky Way. The song also states that the galaxy is \\"a hundred thousand light years side to side\\". This would make the galactic radius 50,000 light years, which is accurate. Australian astrophysicist Bryan Gaensler has stated that Idle's estimation of the thickness of the Milky Way, at 16,000 light years, is more accurate than the official 'textbook' figure of 6,000 light years. However, the song's position on this was later confused by Idle's performance of the song in his Not the Messiah show (2007) where the figure he sings is only 6,000 light years. The reason for the confusion has since been explained in a message from Idle on the official Monty Python website. \\"There was some smug website pulling apart all my original figures for the song (written circa 1981) so for the 2003 Tour (or maybe 2000) I 'updated' them. Now you tell me I was right all along! Not sure where I got my figures originally but tell the bastards to make up their minds.\\" * The last verse of the song explains that the universe is expanding, and furthermore, that the speed of light is the \\"fastest speed there is\\". Idle's estimate of the speed of light is a relatively accurate one: 12 million miles per minute, versus the standard figure of about 11.16 million miles per minute. (11 million would be a closer estimate, but Idle may have chosen \\"12\\" simply because the word \\"11\\" would not scan so well.) Contrary to what the verse implies, the expansion of the universe is not related to the speed of light, and it is in fact expanding much faster. == Remake == Eric Idle and Carol Cleveland performing the “Galaxy Song” at Monty Python Live (Mostly), in July 2014 Released in 1984, Jim Post's album Crooner From Outer Space features a remake called \\"Galaxy/Lighten Up\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjEOpfCcujE In 1999, Clint Black recorded a remake of \\"The Galaxy Song\\" on his album D'lectrified, as well as the \\"Outside Intro (To Galaxy Song)\\", which he co-wrote and sang with Idle. In late 2012, an updated version of \\"The Galaxy Song\\" aired on BBC Two in a trailer for Wonders of Life, hosted by physicist Brian Cox. It was called \\"The Galaxy DNA Song\\" by Idle. In 2014, the song was performed in the stage show Monty Python Live (Mostly). Idle emerges from a refrigerator and begins singing to an elderly woman (Carol Cleveland). At one point, they start dancing on stage as a clip shows them dancing among the stars with the galaxy in the background. After the song ends, the show cuts to a clip of Cox at Cambridge discussing the various scientific inaccuracies within the song. He is knocked over by Stephen Hawking going by in his motorized chair. Hawking tells Cox not to be so pedantic, and then starts to sing the song himself. Hawking's cover for the song was released as a Record Store Day single in 2015. In December 2016, the theme of the song was extended into the hour-long BBC Two The Entire Universe show. Written and co-presented by Idle and Professor Brian Cox, it took the form of a lecture by Cox interspersed with a \\"comedy and musical extravaganza with the help of Warwick Davis, Noel Fielding, Hannah Waddingham and Robin Ince, alongside a chorus of singers and dancers\\". The show closed with an ensemble rendition of \\"The Galaxy Song\\" with updated figures: the galaxy containing 500 billion stars instead of 100 billion; the galaxy rotation speed of 500,000 mph instead of 40,000; the galaxy thickness as 6,000 ly instead of 16,000, and a spiral arm thickness of 1,000 ly instead of 3,000. == Parodies and Other Uses == * Between 1988 and 1991, furniture retailor Courts ran a series of advertisements in the United Kingdom which featured a jingle using the tune of the Galaxy Song sung by a man mimicking Idle's vocal style.Courts UK Advert: \\"See You All In Courts\\" on YouTubeCourts UK Advert: \\"See You All In Courts: Winter Sale\\" on YouTube * The \\"Yakko's Universe\\" song from the animated show Animaniacs is a homage to the Python's song. * The \\"Meaning of Life Space Song\\" from the animated show the Amazing World of Gumball has many direct references to the Python's song == References == == External links == * A study of the Galaxy song * Annotations to the Galaxy song * - sung by physicist Stephen Hawking. * - official video posted by Monty Python Category:1983 songs Category:1983 singles Category:1991 singles Category:CBS Records singles Category:MCA Records singles Category:Monty Python songs Category:Songs about science Category:Songs written by Eric Idle Category:Songs written by John Du Prez Category:Songs written for films ","title":"Galaxy Song"},{"id":"1441691","text":"An interactive film, also known as movie game, is a video game that presents its gameplay in a cinematic, scripted manner, often through the use of full- motion video of either animated or live-action footage. ==Design== This genre came about with the invention of laserdiscs and laserdisc players, the first nonlinear or random access video play devices. The fact that a laserdisc player could jump to and play any chapter instantaneously (rather than proceed in a linear path from start to finish like videotape) meant that games with branching plotlines could be constructed from out-of-order video chapters, in much the same way as Choose Your Own Adventure books are constructed from out- of-order pages. Thus, interactive movies were animated or filmed with real actors like movies (or in some later cases, rendered with 3D models) and followed a main storyline. Alternative scenes were filmed to be triggered after wrong (or alternate allowable) actions of the player (such as 'Game Over' scenes). A popular example of a commercial interactive movie was the 1983 arcade game Dragon's Lair, featuring a full motion video (FMV) cartoon by ex-Disney animator Don Bluth, where the player controlled some of the moves of the main character. When in danger, the player was to decide which move, action, or combination to choose. If they chose the wrong move, they would see a 'lose a life' scene, until they found the correct one which would allow them to see the rest of the story. There was only one possible successful storyline in Dragon's Lair; the only activity the user had was to choose or guess the move the designers intended them to make. Despite the lack of choice, Dragon's Lair was very popular. The hardware for these games consisted of a laserdisc player linked to a processor configured with interface software that assigned a jump-to-chapter function to each of the controller buttons at each decision point. Much as a Choose Your Own Adventure book might say \\"If you turn left, go to page 7. If you turn right, go to page 8\\", the controller for Dragon's Lair or Cliff Hanger was programmed to go to the next chapter in the successful story if a player activated the correct control, or to go to the death chapter if they activated the wrong one. Because laserdisc players of the day were not robust enough to handle the wear and tear of constant arcade use, they required frequent replacement. The laserdiscs that contained the footage were ordinary laserdiscs with nothing special about them save for the order of their chapters and, if removed from the arcade console, would play their video on standard, non-interactive laserdisc players. Later advances in technology allowed interactive movies to overlay multiple fields of FMV, called \\"vites\\", in much the same way as polygonal models and sprites are overlaid on top of backgrounds in traditional video game graphics. ==History== The first example of interactive cinema was Kinoautomat (1967), which was written and directed by Radúz Činčera. This movie was first screened at Expo '67 in Montreal. This film was produced before the invention of the laserdisc or similar technology, so a live moderator appeared on stage at certain points to ask the audience to choose between two scenes. The chosen scene would play following an audience vote. The first interactive movie game was Nintendo's Wild Gunman, a 1974 electro-mechanical arcade game that used film reel projection to display live-action full-motion video (FMV) footage of Wild West gunslingers.Carl Therrien, Inspecting Video Game Historiography Through Critical Lens: Etymology of the First-Person Shooter Genre, Game Studies: The International Journal of Computer Game Research, Volume 15, issue 2, December 2015, ISSN 1604-7982 In the 1970s, Kasco (Kansei Seiki Seisakusho) released The Driver, a hit electro-mechanical arcade game with live-action FMV, projecting car footage filmed by Toei.Kasco and the Electro-Mechanical Golden Age (Interview), Classic Videogame Station ODYSSEY, 2001 An early attempt to combine random access video with computer games was Rollercoaster, written in BASIC for the Apple II by David Lubar for David H. Ahl, editor of Creative Computing. This was a text adventure that could trigger a laserdisc player to play portions of the feature film Rollercoaster (1977). The program was conceived and written in 1981, and it was published in the January 1982 issue of Creative Computing along with an article by Lubar detailing its creation, an article by Ahl claiming that Rollercoaster was the first video/computer game hybrid and proposing a theory of video/computer interactivity, and other articles reviewing hardware necessary to run the game and do further experiments. The first arcade laserdisc video game was Sega's Astron Belt, an early third-person space combat rail shooter featuring live-action full-motion video footage (largely borrowed from a Japanese science fiction film) over which the player/enemy ships and laser fire are superimposed. Developed in 1982, it was unveiled at the 1982 AMOA show in Chicago and released the following year. However, the game that popularized the genre in the United States was Dragon's Lair, animated by Don Bluth and released by Cinematronics shortly after. Around the same time, the laserdisc games Bega's Battle and Cliff Hanger were also released. Several laserdisc games added their own innovations to the genre. Bega's Battle, released by Data East in 1983, introduced \\"branching paths\\", in which there were multiple \\"correct moves\\" at certain points in the animation, and the move the player chose would affect the order of later scenes. Space Ace, another Don Bluth animated game released by Cinematronics the following year, also featured a similar branching formula. In 1984, Super Don Quix-ote, Esh's Aurunmilla and Ninja Hayate overlaid crude computer graphics on top of the animation to indicate the correct input to the player, which the 1985 games Time Gal and Road Blaster also featured. Because Dragon's Lair and Space Ace were immensely popular, they spawned a deluge of sequels and similar laserdisc games, despite the astronomical cost of the animation. To cut costs, several companies simply hacked together scenes from anime that were obscure to American audiences of the day. One such early example was Stern's Cliff Hanger, a 1983 game released around the same time which used footage from the Lupin III movies Castle of Cagliostro (directed by Hayao Miyazaki) and Mystery of Mamo. Another example released around that time was Bega's Battle, which used footage from Harmagedon, though it used a different approach, introducing a new form of video game storytelling: using brief full-motion video cutscenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages. Years later, this would become the standard approach to video game storytelling. Bega's Battle also featured a branching storyline. Time Gal (1985) added a time-stopping feature, where specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time; during these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character. In 1987, the game Night Trap, featuring full-motion video, was created for Hasbro's Control- Vision video game system (originally codenamed \\"NEMO\\"), which used VHS tapes. When Hasbro discontinued production of Control-Vision, the footage was placed into archive until it was purchased in 1991 by the founders of Digital Pictures. Digital Pictures ported Night Trap to the Sega CD platform, releasing it in 1992. In 1988, Epyx announced three VCR games including one based on its video game California Games. They combined videotape footage with a board game. In the late 1980s, American Laser Games started to produce a wide variety of live-action light gun laserdisc video games, which played much like the early cartoon games, but used a light gun instead of a joystick to affect the action. Meanwhile, Digital Pictures started to produce a variety of interactive movies for home consoles. When CD-ROMs were embedded in home computers, games with live action and full motion video featuring actors were considered cutting-edge, and some interactive movies were made. Some notable adventure games from this era are Under a Killing Moon, The Pandora Directive, Gabriel Knight 2: The Beast Within, Voyeur, Star Trek: Klingon, Star Trek: Borg, Ripper, Snatcher, Black Dahlia, The X-Files Game, Phantasmagoria, Bad Day on the Midway and The Dark Eye. Others in the action genre are Brain Dead 13 and Star Wars: Rebel Assault. Due to the limitation of memory and disk space, as well as the lengthy timeframes and high costs required for the production, not many variations and alternative scenes for possible player moves were filmed, so the games tended not to allow much freedom and variety of gameplay. Thus, interactive movie games were not usually very replayable after being completed once. From the time of its original introduction, the DVD format specification has included the ability to use an ordinary DVD player to play interactive games, such as Dragon's Lair (which was reissued on DVD), the Scene It? and other series of DVD games, or games that are included as bonus material on movie DVDs. Aftermath Media (founded by Rob Landeros of Trilobyte) released the interactive movies Tender Loving Care and Point of View (P.O.V) for the DVD platform. Such games have appeared on DVDs aimed at younger target audiences, such as the special features discs of the Harry Potter film series. Later video games used this approach using fully animated computer generated scenes, including various adventure games such as the Sound Novel series by Chunsoft, Shenmue series by Sega, Shadow of Memories by Konami, Time Travelers by Level 5, and Fahrenheit by Quantic Dream. During many scenes, the player has limited control of the character and chooses certain actions to progress the story. Other scenes are quick time event action sequences, requiring the player to hit appropriate buttons at the right time to succeed. Some of these games, such as the Sound Novel series, Shadow of Memories, Time Travelers, Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls and Detroit: Become Human, have numerous branching storylines that result from what actions the player takes or fails to complete properly, which can include the death of major characters or failure to solve the mystery. This idea was even further realized in Telltale's The Walking Dead series, where player actions can drastically change future games, for example, different characters may be alive in the end depending on choices made by the player in The Walking Dead season 1, but those same characters affect The Walking Dead: Season Two. Cast members' work during the 1990s on interactive movies' chroma key sets was different from traditional filmmaking: They performed multiple possible actions players choose in a game, usually looked into the camera to react to the player, and usually did not react to others on the set. Such products were popular during the early 1990s as CD-ROMs and Laserdiscs made their way into the living rooms, providing an alternative to the low-capacity cartridges of most consoles. As the first CD-based consoles capable of displaying smooth and textured 3D graphics appeared, the full-FMV game had vanished from the mainstream circles around 1995, although it remained an option for PC adventure games for a couple more years. One of the last titles released was the 1998 PC and PlayStation adventure The X-Files: The Game, packed in 7 CDs. That same year, Tex Murphy: Overseer became the first game developed specifically for DVD-ROM and one of the last \\"interactive movies\\" to make heavy use of live-action FMV. In 2014, the Tex Murphy series continued with a new FMV game, Tesla Effect: A Tex Murphy Adventure. With advances in computer technology, interactive films waned as more developers used fully digitized characters and scenes. This format was popularized by Telltale Games, achieving success in The Walking Dead series of adventure games. These have sometimes been called interactive movies, as while the player can make choices that affect the game's overall narrative, they do not have direct control over characters, making the experience comparable to watching a sequence of cut scenes. With the advent of YouTube annotations in 2008, a series of five Interactive Adventures were created by Chad, Matt & Rob that utilized the annotations to tell interactive stories that allowed the user to guide the narrative. The series included The Time Machine, The Murder, The Birthday Party, The Teleporter, and The Treasure Hunt. In the 2010s, streaming services like Netflix started to grow in popularity and sophistication. By 2016, Netflix had started experimenting with interactive works aimed at children, including an animated version of Puss in Boots and an adaption of Telltale's Minecraft: Story Mode. Netflix's first major interactive film with live-action scenes was Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, a film in the Black Mirror anthology series and released in December 2018. Netflix worked with Black Mirrors creator Charlie Brooker to develop a narrative that took advantage of the interactive format, while developing their own tools to improve caching of scenes and management of the film's progression to use on future projects. ==Specialized hardware formats== ===LaserDisc games === A LaserDisc video game is a video game that uses pre-recorded video (either live-action or animation) played from a LaserDisc, either as the entirety of the graphics or as part of the graphics. The first arcade laserdisc game was Sega's Astron Belt, an early third-person space combat rail shooter featuring live-action full-motion video footage (largely borrowed from a Japanese science fiction film) over which the player/enemy ships and laser fire are superimposed. Developed in 1982, the game's unveiling at the 1982 AMOA show in Chicago marked the beginning of LaserDisc fever in the videogame industry, and its release in Japan the following year marked the first commercial release of a LaserDisc game. However, its release in the United States was delayed due to several hardware and software bugs, by which time Dragon's Lair had beaten it to public release there. The first LaserDisc game to gain popularity in the United States was Dragon's Lair in 1983. It contained animated scenes, much like a cartoon. The scenes would be played back and at certain points during playback the player would have to press a specific direction on the joystick or the button to advance the game to the next scene, like a quick time event. For instance, a scene begins with the hero, a knight named Dirk, falling through a hole in a drawbridge and being attacked by tentacles. If the player presses the button at this point, Dirk fends off the tentacles with his sword and pulls himself back up out of the hole. If the player fails to press the sword button at the right time, or instead presses a direction on the joystick, Dirk is attacked by the tentacles and crushed. Each unsuccessful move, however, would produce a few moments of black screen, when the LaserDisc switched to the scene showing the death of the character, which interrupted the continuous flow of gameplay found in other videogame graphic systems of the time; this was a common criticism of some players and critics. Despite the high cost of the animation, a deluge of similar LaserDisc video games followed Dragon's Lair because of its immense popularity. To cut costs, several companies simply hacked together scenes from several Japanese anime movies that were obscure in America at the time, creating games like Cliff Hanger (from Hayao Miyazaki's Castle of Cagliostro and from Mystery of Mamo) and Bega's Battle (from Harmagedon), both of which were released roughly around the same time as Dragon's Lair. Later arcade LaserDisc games include Freedom Fighter, Badlands, Space Ace, and Road Blaster. Other LaserDisc video games followed the lead of Astron Belt by integrating more and more computer graphics with the pre-recorded video. For example, Funai's Inter Stellar in 1983 was a forward-scrolling third-person rail shooter that used computer graphics for the ships and full-motion video for the backgrounds. Similarly, M.A.C.H. 3 and Cube Quest were vertical scrolling shooters that used the LaserDisc video for the background and computer graphics for the ships. The Firefox arcade game included a Philips LaserDisc player to combine live action video and sound from the Firefox film with computer generated graphics and sound. The game used a special CAV LaserDisc containing multiple storylines stored in very short, interleaved segments on the disc. The player would seek the short distance to the next segment of a storyline during the vertical retrace interval by adjusting the tracking mirror, allowing perfectly continuous video even as the player switched storylines under control of the game's computer. This method of seeking was noted for being extremely strenuous on the player and frequently led to the machines breaking, slightly hindering the appeal of LaserDisc arcade games. In the 1990s, American Laser Games produced a wide variety of live-action light gun LaserDisc video games, which played much like the early LaserDisc games, but used a light gun instead of a joystick to affect the action. Bega's Battle, released by Data East in 1983, took a different approach and introduced a new form of video game storytelling: using brief full-motion video cut scenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages. Years later, this would become the standard approach to video game storytelling. Bega's Battle also featured a branching storyline. ===DVD games=== A DVD game (sometimes called DVDi, \\"DVD interactive\\") is a standalone game that can be played on a set-top DVD player. The game takes advantage of technology built into the DVD format to create an interactive gaming environment compatible with most DVD players without requiring additional hardware. DVD TV games were first developed in the late 1990s. They were poorly received and understood as an entertainment medium. However, DVD-based game consoles like the PlayStation 2 popularized DVD-based gaming and also functioned as a DVD video player. In addition, the format has been used to import some video games to the DVD format, allowing them to be played with a standard DVD player rather than requiring a PC. Examples include Dragon's Lair and Who Shot Johnny Rock?. The PC/console game Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness was released in 2006 as a DVD game entitled Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Action Adventure. Japanese games such as visual novels and eroge that were originally made for PC are commonly ported to DVDPG (a term that stands for DVD Players Game). Instead of standard save methods, DVDPGs use password save systems. Similar game types include BDPG (Blu-ray Disc Players Game) and UMDPG (Universal Media Disc Players Game). === Live interactive movies === The world's first live interactive movie was My One Demand filmed and premiered on 25 June 2015. Created by Blast Theory, the film was streamed live to the TIFF Lightbox on three successive nights. The cast of eight included Julian Richings and Clare Coulter. Audiences in the cinema used mobile phones to answer questions from the narrator, played by Maggie Huculak and their answers were included in the voiceover as well as in the closing credits. ==Reception== Although interactive movies had a filmic quality that sprite- based games could not duplicate at the time, they were a niche market— the limited amount of direct interactivity put off many gamers. The popularity of FMV games declined during 1995, as real-time 3D graphics gained increasing attention. The negative response to FMV-based games was so common that it was even acknowledged in game marketing; a print advertisement for the interactive movie Psychic Detective stated, \\"Yeah, we know full-motion video games in the past sucked.\\" Cost was also an issue, as live action video with decent production values is expensive to film, while video shot on a low budget damages the overall image of the game. Ground Zero: Texas cost Sega around US$3 million, about the same as a low-budget movie would cost in 1994. Though not as crucial an issue as the limited interactivity, another issue that drew criticism was the quality of the video itself. While the video was often relatively smooth, it was not actually full-motion as it was not of 24 frames per second or higher. In addition to this, the hardware it was displayed on, particularly in the case of the Sega CD, had a limited color palette (of which a maximum of 64 colors were displayable simultaneously), resulting in notably inferior image quality due to the requirement of dithering. Game designer Chris Crawford disparages the concept of interactive movies, except those aimed at elementary-school-age children, in his book Chris Crawford on Game Design. He writes that since the player must process what is known and explore the options, choosing a path at a branch-point is every bit as demanding as making a decision in a conventional game, but with much less reward since the result can only be one of a small number of branches. Defenders of the genre have argued that, by allowing the player to interact with real people rather than animated characters, interactive full-motion video can produce emotional and visceral reactions that are not possible with either movies or traditional video games. ==Other uses== Some studios hybridized ordinary computer game play with interactive movie play; the earliest examples of this were the entries in the Origin Systems Wing Commander series starting with Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger. Between combat missions, Wing Commander III featured cut-scenes with live actors; the game offered limited storyline branching based on whether missions were won or lost and on choices made at decision points during the cut-scenes. Other games like BioForge would, perhaps erroneously, use the term for a game that has rich action and plot of cinematic proportions--but, in terms of gameplay, has no relation to FMV movies. The term is an ambiguous one since many video games follow a storyline similar to the way movies would. == See also == * Web documentary * List of interactive movies * Interactive cinema * Interactive video * Interactive art * Art game * Interactive Adventures * Chad, Matt & Rob * Full motion video * Adventure game * LaserActive * Halcyon Game System * AnimePlay * Black Mirror: Bandersnatch ==References== == External links == * The Dragon's Lair Project: A repository of information about laserdisc video games * \\"Laser Daze\\", from The Dot Eaters: Videogame History 101 Category:Video game genres Category:Video game terminology ","title":"Interactive film"},{"id":"1441692","text":"Beckton Park DLR station is a station on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in the Docklands area of east London. The station is located by the north quay of the Royal Albert Dock (though no foot access is possible). The station is opposite Beckton District South Park, which is open space leading to housing in South Beckton. The station is located on the DLR's Beckton branch, between Royal Albert and Cyprus stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 3 and is the most lightly used station on the DLR. A previous railway station called Central was located largely on the same site from 1880 to 1940, on the former line from Custom House to Gallions. ==Layout== The station is unmanned, like most DLR stations. There is one ticket machine on each platform. There are three Oystercard readers — one on each platform between the ticket machines and a set of stairs, and a more recently added third reader at the approach to the station's connecting footbridge (thus, due to the position, this newer Oyster reader's pad is protected from rain). Along with neighbouring Cyprus station, Beckton Park station is of an unusual design. Between the two stations, the DLR runs in the median of a major highway built at the same time as the railway. The stations are located at highway intersections which take the form of roundabouts. On the approach to the roundabout, the road rises slightly whilst the railway dips slightly; the station is therefore situated in a cutting, under the centre of the elevated roundabout, with pedestrian access at surface level under the elevated roadways and arched over the railway. ==Connections== London Buses route 376 and school route 678 serve the station. ==Gallery== Image:Beckton Park stn eastbound.JPGLooking east towards Beckton Image:Beckton Park stn westbound.JPGLooking west towards London Image:Beckton Park stn signage.JPGSignage on westbound platform == References == == External links == * Docklands Light Railway website - Beckton Park station page Category:Docklands Light Railway stations in the London Borough of Newham Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1994 Category:Beckton ","title":"Beckton Park DLR station"},{"id":"1441699","text":"In the technical analysis of security prices, a bottom is a chart pattern where prices reach a low, then a lower low, and then a higher low.

They consist of three lakes - Lough Leane, Muckross Lake (also called Middle Lake) and Upper Lake. == Surroundings == The lakes sit in a low valley some above sea level. They are surrounded by the rugged slopes of MacGillycuddy's Reeks. Notable mountains in the range include Carrauntoohil, which, at is Ireland's highest mountain, Purple Mountain, at , Mangerton Mountain, at , and Torc Mountain, at . The N71 road from Killarney to Kenmare passes a viewpoint called Ladies View which offers a view of the lakes and valleys. On the occasion of Queen Victoria's visit in 1861, the point was apparently chosen by the queen's ladies-in- waiting as the finest in the land; hence the name. == Lough Leane == alt= Lough Leane () is the largest and northernmost of the three lakes, approximately in size. It is also the largest body of fresh water in the region. The River Laune drains Lough Leane to the north-west towards Killorglin and into Dingle Bay. Leane is dotted with small forested islands, including Innisfallen Island, which holds the remains of the ruined Innisfallen Abbey. On the eastern edge of the lake, Ross Island, more properly a peninsula, was the site of some of the earliest Copper Age metalwork in prehistoric Ireland.p142-146, Richard Bradley The prehistory of Britain and Ireland, Cambridge University Press, 2007, Ross Castle, a 15th-century keep, sits on the eastern shore of the lake, north of the Ross Island peninsula. == Muckross Lake == alt= Also known as Middle Lake or Torc Lake, Muckross is just south of Lough Leane. The two are separated by a small peninsula, crossed by a stone arched bridge called Brickeen Bridge. It is Ireland's deepest lake, reaching to in parts.

Mark Crispin Miller (born 1949) is professor of media studies at New York University. ==Background and career== Miller graduated from Northwestern University with a BA in 1971, Johns Hopkins University with an MA in 1973, and a Ph.D. in 1977. His parents, Jordan and Anita Miller, founded Academy Chicago Publishers. Miller is known for his writing on American media and activism advocating democratic media reform, his books include Boxed In: The Culture of TV, Seeing Through Movies, Fooled Again, How the Right Stole the 2004 Elections, and Mad Scientists, a study of war propaganda. In the introduction to Seeing Through Movies, Miller argues that the nature of American films has been affected by the impact of advertising. Miller has said that the handful of multinational corporations in control of the American media have changed the focus of youth culture away from values and more towards commercial interests and personal vanity. ==Political and social commentary== In a June 2001 profile in The New York Times, Miller told Chris Hedges of his desire \\"to, as a public intellectual, take a fresh look at the news that we take in daily from TV, news that is astonishingly empty and distorts reality\\". According to Miller's book, Fooled Again, the 2000 and 2004 U.S. Presidential election were stolen. Miller presents evidence supporting his contention that the outcome of both elections was altered and controlled by a small minority. He states that the American voting populace can no longer assume that their votes will be accurately assessed, and that the installation of electronic voting machines in state after state is a fundamental flaw in the U.S. electoral system. He appeared in the 2004 documentary Orwell Rolls in His Grave, which focuses on the hidden mechanics of the media, its role as it should be and what it actually is, and how it shapes (to the point of almost controlling) U.S. politics. Miller is a 9/11 truther. and is a signatory to the 9/11 Truth Statement. Interviewed by the New York Observer website, Miller said anyone using the conspiracy theory description \\"in a pejorative sense is a witting or unwitting CIA asset\\". Following a \\"truthers\\" symposium on 9/11, \\"Justice in Focus\\", Miller told Vice the official explanations for 9/11 and the assassination of John F. Kennedy \\"are just as unscientific as the ones that everybody feels comfortable ridiculing\\", referring to conservatives dismissal of global warming. Miller shows his students the anti-vaccination film Vaxxed made by the disgraced physician Andrew Wakefield. He has defended the false claims made in Vaxxed of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, and the assertion that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been involved in a cover-up. ==Books== Miller's books include: *Boxed In: The Culture of Television (1988)Boxed In: The Culture of Television, Northwestern University Press, 1988.

Note that this article is an attempt to be inclusive of the broader definitions of the areas which are often considered part of the Greater Richmond Region, based on their urban or suburban character and nature (as identified by architectural historians, urban planners, or the like), rather than by strictly political boundaries. ==Description of the Richmond Metro Region from a Quadrant Perspective== North Side, Southside, East End and West End The Greater Richmond area extends beyond the city limits into nearby counties. Descriptions of Richmond often describe the large area as falling into one of the four primarily geographic references which somewhat mirror the points of a compass: North Side, Southside, East End and West End. Since there is no one municipal organization that represents the Greater Richmond region, the boundaries of these subregions are loosely defined. The definitions are also affected by the James River which has separated Henrico County on the north bank and Chesterfield County to the south since the latter was formed in the 18th century. Until 1910, the James also separated the City of Richmond on the north bank from the City of Manchester on the south bank, until they merged by mutual agreement in 1910. A large portion of the river which divides the modern City of Richmond is part of the city's James River Park System. Except where the James River continues to define a boundary between the West End and Southside, drawing a theoretical line between quadrants of the metropolitan area is not well defined as one moves away from the city. This is especially true north of the James with the distinctions between East, North, and West end areas, all of which are north of the River. In the broadest context, each of these may be considered by some to include portions of Hanover County, which at its closest point, is only 5 miles from the current city limits. However, the Chickahominy River separates the Hanover from Henrico County at this closest point, which is in the Mechanicsville area. Some outlying areas meeting may be considered as independent or outside the Richmond area, such as Mechanicsville, Midlothian, or Short Pump. ==Downtown== There are several areas in Downtown Richmond, each with their distinct history and character. ===Court End=== Court End is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Richmond, and is composed of the most important residential structures in the city. Court End is North of the Capitol District and west of I-95. Its name is derived from the Virginia Supreme Court's proximity to the Capitol Building. This convenient location made Court End a convenient home to many prominent citizens of Richmond, including Wickham, Valentine and Benjamin Watkings Leigh. Some say that this small area contains some of the city's most valuable and unusual architecture. ===Jackson Ward=== Jackson Ward is a historically black neighborhood that at one time was known as the \\"Harlem of the South. \\" A center for black commerce and entertainment, it was frequented by the likes of Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, Lena Horne, Cab Calloway, Billie Holiday, Nat King Cole and James Brown. Jackson Ward was also home to Maggie L. Walker, the first woman to charter and serve as president of an American bank. The Maggie L. Walker House is now a U.S. National Historic Site. Jackson Ward is home to the Hippodrome Theater. During the construction of the Eisenhower Interstate highway system in the 1950s Jackson Ward was split in two, much to the detriment of the neighborhood. In the early 2000s, the Greater Richmond Convention Center and Visitors Bureau was built at the eastern edge of Jackson Ward. ===Monroe Ward=== Monroe Ward is the neighborhood defined by the following streets. East of Belvidere, South of Broad, North of Franklin, and West of 14th Street. Monroe Ward lies just north of the Midtown Neighborhood. ===Midtown=== Midtown is south of Monroe Ward. The neighborhood defined by the following streets. Franklin Street south to W. Canal St. Belvidere east to 7th St. ===The River District=== In 1999, the City of Richmond completed its canal walk project, a refurbishment of a 1.25-mile segment of the Haxall Canal and the James River & Kanawha Canal that had fallen into disuse. Developed as a tourist destination, the area surrounding the Canal Walk was branded by The River District Alliance (RDA) (a 501(c)6 public/private organization) as \\"The River District.\\". The actual boundaries of the River district are not defined, and include some businesses commonly thought to belong to other districts, like Shockoe Bottom and Shockoe Slip.http://www.richmond.com/riverdistrict/clientoutput.cfm?id=3280073 Similar Canal Walks were built in San Antonio, Texas, and Indianapolis, Indiana. ===Shockoe Slip=== Shockoe Slip is a collection of tobacco warehouses in which are located shops, restaurants, and offices. The name \\"slip\\" refers to the canal boat slips nearby where goods were loaded and unloaded. Shockoe Slip became developed as a commercial and entertainment district in the 1970s. The nightlife district came just after Richmond passed liquor-by-the-drink laws, and when the so-called fern bar became popular across the United States. The rough boundaries of Shockoe Slip include 14th Street, Main Street, Canal Street and 12th Street. ==East End== The East End of Richmond, Virginia is actually a collection of neighborhoods. Within the city, and in Henrico County, it roughly defined as including the area of Richmond north of the James River and east/northeast of the former Virginia Central Railroad - Chesapeake and Ohio Railway line (now owned by CSX Transportation and operated by the Buckingham Branch Railroad) which originated at Main Street Station, and south and west of I-295. Within the city, the East End includes neighborhoods such as Church Hill, Fairmount, Union Hill, Fulton, Fulton Hill, Montrose Heights, Fairfield Court, Creighton Court, Whitcomb Court, Mosby Court, Eastview, Brauers, Peter Paul, Woodville, Church Hill North, Chimborazo and Oakwood. The terminology \\"East End\\" also broadly includes much of eastern Henrico County and part of Hanover County as a portion the Richmond Metropolitan area. ===Church Hill=== The historic district of Church Hill encompasses the original land plot of the city of Richmond. There Patrick Henry gave his \\"Give me liberty or give me death\\" speech in St. John's Church. Chimborazo Park occupies the former site of the largest American Civil War Hospital. Church Hill is notable as one of the largest extant 19th century neighborhoods in America, with many fine examples of period architecture. This area has undergone significant gentrification in recent years. ===Fairmount=== ===Fulton Hill=== ===Libby Hill=== ===Shockoe Bottom=== Shockoe Bottom, just east of downtown along the James River, became a major nightlife, dining, and entertainment center in the last two decades of the 20th century. After centuries of periodic flooding by the James River, development was greatly stimulated by the completion of Richmond's James River Flood Wall in 1995. Ironically, the next flooding disaster came not from the river, but from Hurricane Gaston which brought extensive local tributary flooding along the basin of Shockoe Creek and did extensive damage to this area in 2004, with businesses being shut down and many buildings condemned. The city of Richmond had serious discussions about moving the Richmond Braves baseball stadium from its current location at The Diamond to Shockoe Bottom or Tobacco Row, These plans fell through and in 2009 the Richmond Braves moved to Gwinnett, GA.. ===Tobacco Row=== Just east of Shockoe Bottom, Tobacco Row is a collection of tobacco warehouses and cigarette factories adjacent to the James River and Kanawha Canal near its eastern terminus at the head of navigation of the James River. Beginning in the 18th century, many growers and shippers of Virginia's major cash-crop of tobacco maintained facilities there, as well as directly across the river at Manchester. Substantial multi-story brick buildings were constructed to protect the contents from loss due to fire. During the American Civil War (1861–1865), Tobacco Row was the site of infamous Libby Prison and nearby Castle Thunder, detention facilities of the Confederate government. The area was vacated by the tobacco companies by the late 1980s. Led by Richmond developer William H. Abeloff, many of the old warehouses of Tobacco Row were modernized and converted into developments of loft apartments, condominiums, offices, and retail space along part of the restored canal system. In 2006 the Richmond Housing Authority using HOPE VI grants worked with developer McCormack Baron Salazar to redevelop former warehouses in Tobacco Row into 250 mixed-income housing units.Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority Bi- Annual Report, Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 2008. ===Union Hill=== Union Hill is one of the oldest and most historically significant neighborhoods of Richmond and, as such, has been the recent focus of rapid gentrification and preservation. Its architectural and historical significance has earned the neighborhood designation on the National Register of Historic Places and the Virginia Landmarks Register. It is situated on the high western bluff above Shockoe Bottom. Houses of a remarkable mix are balanced along the irregular, picturesque and sometimes narrow streets that follow the curve of the hill. Those homes that line Jefferson Park have a clear view of downtown Richmond. Union Hill is bordered on the south by Jefferson Avenue, on the north by Venable Street, on the east by 25th Street, and by Mosby on the west. The term “Union Hill” first occurs in 1817 — probably referring to the combination of several hills that were joined by fill and grading over the years. Union Hill was featured in November 2007 on The Learning Channel's television program \\"Flip It Back.\\" The episode highlighted the opportunities for historic preservation and investment in the neighborhood while focusing on the efforts by local entrepreneurs to restore and market a turn-of-the-century double house located at 816 and 818 North 23rd Street. == Near West and West End== This section covers those neighborhoods that have at any point historically been considered part of the West End of Richmond. ===Byrd Park=== The Byrd Park neighborhood was in the Far West End of the City when it was planned in the late 1910s. This is a residential area, now in the Central neighborhoods of the City, bounded on the south by Byrd Park and Maymont Park, on the north by the Downtown Expressway, on the east by Meadow Street. The heart of the neighborhood is located north and east of its namesake and its three lakes; Boat, Swan and Shields. Homes include row houses built in the 1920s, two-story frame bungalows, brick Colonials, Cape Cods, tri-levels, ranchers and American Four Squares mostly built in the 1930s and 1940s. Westover Road hosts a number of large lakefront Spanish, Georgian and Colonial Revival mansions. The Fountain Lake area features upscale condos and apartments. A small, neighborhood retail section and a converted 1922 public school (now retirement home) is located along middle blocks Idlewood Avenue in the northern part of the neighborhood. ===Carver === The Carver neighborhood, also called Sheep Hill, lies north of Broad Street (Richmond, Virginia) to the west of Jackson Ward and downtown Richmond. Carver was first settled by blue- collar Jewish and German tradesmen, and became a thriving black community in the early 1900s before being cut through by major thoroughfares such as Jefferson Davis Highway, Belvidere Street and Interstate 95. As the years passed, more and more houses became vacant, and the neighborhood declined. By the 1950s, Carver began to sharply decline and was seen as a \\"dangerous\\" neighborhood. In modern times, Carver has seen new life, with redevelopment of older housing, some new homes, expansion to the north side of Broad Street of Virginia Commonwealth University facilities and student housing. Today, Carver is a diverse mix of students, singles, young families, and elderly residents. ===Carytown/Museum District=== Carytown is a residential and commercial area that generally consists of 1920s era homes and privately owned shops, clothing stores, cafes, and restaurants along Cary Street. The Byrd Theatre, located in this district, is a historic 1920s era movie palace that shows second run movies and that offers periodic performances of its Wurlitzer organ. The Museum District (also sometimes known as West of the Boulevard, and often the Upper Fan) is located just west of the Fan district (and the Boulevard) and north of Carytown. Historically, this area was a site where many Confederate Soldiers were hospitalized/lived after the American Civil War. Some large institutions in this district are the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the world headquarters for the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and the Virginia Museum of History & Culture. The architecture is predominantly from the 1920s, though other styles from Victorian through Art Deco, up to the modern period, are also represented. Most houses are attached, or semi-detached, with occasional apartment buildings, and large Mansions along Monument Avenue. Occasional houses are distinguished, but as in the neighboring Fan the most interesting aspect is the general preservation of the neighborhood—it has mostly been preserved as built. The Fan is one of many other Neighborhoods of Richmond Virginia ===The Fan District=== A residential neighborhood which is home to Virginia Commonwealth University, named for the fan-shaped grid of its streets. The fan district is dominated by late-19th century architecture. It lies immediately to the west of Downtown and east of Carytown/Museum district, between Broad Street and VA-195 (Downtown Expressway) ===Uptown=== Also known as the Lower Fan area. Neighborhood area popular with VCU students and containing much of the campus. (Campus is also contained in Midtown some, but the rest is mostly in Monroe Ward—where the name Monroe Campus comes from.) The area is defined by streets as follows: Meadow Street east to Belvidere. W. Canal St. north to Broad St. ===Newtowne West === Located west of Carver, Newtowne West is a residential neighborhood located north of Broad St. between Hermitage Rd. and Lombardy St., and south of Interstates 95 and 64. Newtowne West began as a working-class African-American neighborhood in the 1890s but gradually became a more self-sufficient community in the 1920s before falling into disrepair during the second half of the twentieth century. Selected in 1999 as a part of Richmond City's Neighborhoods in Bloom program, Newtowne West is currently a center of revitalization including the renovation of the historic Maggie L. Walker High School in 2001. ===Oregon Hill=== ===Randolph === This is a residential area bounded on the south by Colorado Avenue, on the north by the Downtown Expressway, on the east by several historic cemeteries and on the west by Meadow Street and Maymont Park. Randolph is notable for its access to the historic and scenic areas of Maymont Park, North Bank Park, and Hollywood Cemetery. The neighborhood is home to many blue-collar families. ===Scott's Addition === A neighborhood and National Historic District located across Broad Street from the Museum District, it is a former industrial neighborhood which has been redeveloped into a commercial hub, with numerous modern restaurants and bars. Scott's Addition is bounded on the south by Broad Street, on the east by Boulevard, on the north by I-95/I-64 and on the west by I-195. ===Three Corners District=== ===Windsor Farms=== ==North Side== Chestnut Hill-Plateau historic district of North Side's Highland Park Richmond's North Side is home to many diverse neighborhoods, including Barton Heights, Bellevue, Chestnut Hill-Plateau, Ginter Park, Rosedale, Washington Park, Hermitage Rd, Highland Park, Sherwood Park, etc. These neighborhoods are made up of houses with a variety of architectural styles, which include Arts and Crafts Bungalows, Victorian, Romanesque Revival, and Queen Anne houses among other styles. The city's North Side includes the campuses of Virginia Union University and Union Presbyterian Seminary, as well as regional attractions such as the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden, Bryan Park, Richmond Raceway, and the Richmond Staples Mill Road Amtrak train station. The terminology \\"North Side\\" also broadly includes much of central Henrico County to include Lakeside, Virginia. ==Southside== Chippenham Parkway (State Route 150) and Virginia State Route 288 are the main beltways through Southside Richmond, while the Powhite Parkway and I-95 are the primary limited-access highway routes into Downtown Richmond from Southside. ===Manchester=== Manchester is an industrial and residential area directly south of downtown Richmond across the James River from the Canal Walk. Not to be confused with the Manchester area of Chesterfield County, Manchester (also known as Old Manchester and South Richmond) has a distinguished history of its own. Originally known as Rocky Ridge, for over 200 years, Manchester was a separate town and later independent city on the south bank of the James River across from Richmond. It was commercially successful due to its agricultural mills and docks, where coal from the Midlothian area 13 miles west was transported on the Chesterfield Railroad, the first in Virginia, beginning in 1831. The City of Manchester merged with Richmond in 1910. In current times, the Manchester section of Richmond is mostly notable for its new development. With many new homes and recent commercial additions such as Overnight Transportation, Legend Brewery, refurbished industrial building loft condominiums, Sun Trust's Riverview Center, and the Plant Zero Cafe Art Works Studios and Galleries, and Plant Zero Event Space, it is seen as an area of rapid growth. Currently, these efforts of revitalization are moving the buzz word of the area, now known to locals as \\"Old Manchester.\\" Efforts from the city, developers, merchants, and local artists, and community members, are now maintaining an improved lifestyle. The former Southern Railway passenger station in Manchester now houses the Old Dominion Railway Historical Society's museum at 2nd and Hull Streets, near the south end of the Mayo Bridge. ===Woodland Heights=== ===Forest Hill=== The neighborhood of Forest Hill, one of Richmond's designated Historic Districts, is located along the southern banks of the James River, extending south to Reedy Creek and Bassett Avenue, east to Forest Hill Park, and west to Cedar Lane and Westover Hills Boulevard. One of the area's first trolley car suburbs, the neighborhood was built near the terminus of the trolley line which ran up Semmes Avenue and terminated at Forest Hill Park, where an amusement park and swimming lakes were located. The neighborhood was home to Frederick William Sievers, sculptor of the Matthew Fontaine Maury and Stonewall Jackson monuments on Monument Avenue as well as the Virginia Monument at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. There is a historical marker at the location of his workshop in the yard of a West 43rd Street home. ===Westover Hills === Westover Hills, one of Richmond's more established neighborhoods, is located directly south of the James River where State Route 161, a major north-south roadway through the city, crosses via the Boulevard Bridge (also known as the \\"Nickel Bridge\\", its original toll) from the City's Fan District. The neighborhood lies along both the east and west sides of Westover Hills Boulevard in that area. This location makes it near the geographical center of the City. Most of the homes were built during the 1920-1940 period. The styles are highly varied, with Cape Cods located next to Spanish Colonial and Tudor Revival, with the odd farmhouse or Arts and Crafts thrown in. Many housing sites feature large lots and a generally suburban feel. Some homes are located overlooking the banks of the James River, Westover Hills Boulevard, Forest Hill Ave. and Forest Hill Park. The neighborhood features well-established restaurants and businesses, along with churches and some arts establishments. ===Stratford Hills and Southampton=== Stratford Hills began life as a part of Chesterfield County, but was annexed by the City in the 1970s. Homes in the area are predominately 1950s-style ranchers and split-levels, with some larger, architecturally beautiful homes along stately Riverside Drive. The neighborhood is bound by Forest Hill Avenue to the south and the James River to the north, with Huguenot Rd. and Powhite Parkway roughly forming the west and east boundaries. The Pony Pasture and James River Park System are accessible from Cherokee Road in this neighborhood. === Bon Air === Bon Air is located just outside the city borders at the intersection of the Powhite Parkway (VA-76) and the Chippenham Parkway (VA-150) Bon Air is located in Chesterfield County just outside the city borders. Originally developed in 1877 as a seasonal resort along the Richmond and Danville train line, it evolved into a year-round village and is now an inner suburb of Richmond. The north-south oriented Buford Road connects various subdivisions between Huguenot Road to the North and Midlothian Turnpike to the South. The Powhite Creek runs through the area. The central portion of the Bon Air Village has been designated as a National Historic District with many structures of Victorian design from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The more recent (1950s-1960s) developments along Huguenot Road include the Bon Air Shopping Center as well as residential subdivisions like Woodmont, Brookwood Estates, and Oxford. Between Forest Hill Ave and Jahnke Roads is Grand Summit, Crestwood Farms, and the mid-century modern Highland Hills subdivisions. Other Bon Air subdivisions to the south of Jahnke include Brighton Green and Brown Road neighborhoods. While remnants of the 1916 village-era post office, 1902 Hazen Library, and Hotel Grounds (currently the Bon Air Community Association) still remain at the intersection of Rockaway and McRae Roads, current day \\"Old Town\\" Bon Air is generally not a tourism attraction. Bon Air is largely a bedroom community, surrounded by suburban shopping centers. In some cases, these shopping centers house independent businesses (butchers, coffee shops, restaurants) that are spinoffs from downtown Richmond's thriving independent business and restaurant scene. Bon Air is 10 minutes by car from the city or the West End via the Powhite Parkway or Chippenham Parkway. === Other Southside neighborhoods=== Places such as Midlothian, Brandermill, Chester, Virginia and the Jefferson Davis Corridor are more closely associated with Chesterfield County, Virginia but are sometimes included in the definition of Southside. The parts of Richmond that are within the city borders are sometimes referred to collectively as South Richmond. ==References== ==External links== *Richmond Planning Department Master Plan - Section on Neighborhoods *Richmond (VA) Neighborhoods *Randolph Richmond *Richmond Commission of Architectural Review Slide Collection from the collection of the VCU Libraries *Richmond Comprehensive Planning Slide Collection from the collection of the VCU Libraries * ","title":"Neighborhoods of Richmond, Virginia"},{"id":"1441716","text":"The Franklin Park Zoo is a zoo located in Boston, Massachusetts. It is currently operated by Zoo New England, which also operates the Stone Zoo in Stoneham, Massachusetts. The zoo is located in the northeast portion of Franklin Park, Boston's largest park and the last component of the city's famed Emerald Necklace. The zoo was opened to the public in 1912, and managed by the City of Boston until 1958, when the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) took control. Under the MDC's management, the zoo opened several new exhibits, including Bird's World (c. 1975), the Children's Zoo (1984), and the African Tropical Forest (1989). In 1991, the zoo's management was handed over to the Commonwealth Zoological Corporation (CZS), which also gained management of the Stone Zoo. (In July 1997, the CZS was renamed Zoo New England to \\"reflect the changing image of both zoos\\".) The zoo has been accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) since 1990. ==History== Frederick Law Olmsted, the original landscape designer of Franklin Park, created plans for a future zoological garden. This plan, however, was to be a naturalistic area for native animals, rather than a traditional zoo. The Franklin Park Zoo officially opened to the public on October 4, 1912 (although most sources say 1913). According to plans by Arthur A. Shurtleff, the new zoo represented a major departure from Olmsted's original plans, and included more exotic animals. However, Shurtleff's design for the zoo was modest and was intended to be in harmony with key elements of the plan, such as a half-mile long grassy mall called \\"the Greeting\\", which began at Peabody Circle. The zoo was managed by the Boston Parks Department, was free to all, and extremely popular. An estimated two-million people visited the zoo in 1920. Unfortunately, the zoo fell into disrepair starting around the time of the Depression and through World War II. In 1958, the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) took control of the Franklin Park Zoo. The MDC put up fences and gates and started charging admission to the zoo, and areas of the zoo that were difficult to take care of, such as the elephant house and the Bear Dens in Long Crouch Woods, were separated from the zoo property and left to deteriorate. Soon afterward, the zoo received its first professionally trained zoologist to serve as its director, Walter D. Stone. An animal hospital, administrative buildings, and the Children's Zoo (opened in 1962) were also added. In 1970, the Boston Zoological Society assumed some, but not all, management of the zoo, while the state continued to provide funding for the facility. In 1973, a new $24 million master plan, which would \\"recommend replacing 'the Greeting' with new zoo exhibits\\", was formulated to revitalize and expand the facility, and included several new domed pavilions, stressing an African theme. Construction began in 1978, but the process was prolonged due to inadequate funding and political complications. On July 1, 1984, after extensive renovations, the Children's Zoo was reopened; around this time it became the zoo's most popular exhibit. After eleven years of construction at a cost of $26 million, the new African Tropical Forest Pavilion opened on September 9, 1989. The zoo was finally accredited by the American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA) in 1990. At the time, it was the only zoo in the nation to be run by a state government (besides the Stone Zoo). After accreditation, the zoo's attendance jumped to 200,000. The number of visitors, however, would continue to fluctuate over the next few years. In 1991, Franklin Park Zoo's management was handed over to the Commonwealth Zoological Corporation (renamed Zoo New England in July 1997). This private, non-profit corporation also took over management of the Stone Zoo, which would reopen in June 1992 after being closed for 18 months due to state budget cuts. In the late 1990s, many new exhibits were built, including Bongo Congo (1997), Outback Trail (1998), and Butterfly Landing (1998). Also at this time, the zoo faced many problems, including multiple budget cuts and dwindling attendance. The zoo is now doing well financially and continues to grow, due to the kindness of many supporters. The 2011 movie Zookeeper, starring Kevin James, was filmed at the zoo in 2009, and was screened at the zoo on June 28, 2011 as a charity event. In 2015, one of the zoo's animals, a lion named Christopher who was born in 1993, was humanely euthanized. ==Exhibits== The zoo contains more than 220 species of animals and includes the following main exhibit areas. The Tropical Forest (known as the African Tropical Forest from 1989 to 1997), a building roofed by a huge Teflon-coated cloth dome. The building mimics the animals' natural environment with streams, moats, faux-rock structures, hidden fences and barriers, and free-flight birds. The exhibit includes gorillas, bats, dwarf crocodiles, ocelots, ring-tailed lemurs, pottos, Baird's tapirs, vultures, giant anteaters, de brazza's monkey, cotton- top tamarin and two pygmy hippos. This exhibit was included in the zoo's 1973 master plan, and was originally intended to house only African tropical species; however, more South American and Asian tropical animals began being displayed in the Tropical Forest by the late 1990s. One gorilla named Little Joe escaped his enclosure several times in 2003. He was later separated from the gorilla family, but later returned in 2007. Also in 2007, the zoo's gorilla exhibit was reopened after extensive renovations. As of 2011, a male giant anteater named Jockamo resides in the former warthog enclosure. In spring 2020, A wildlife trade exhibit showcasing artifacts will be displayed in the tropical forest public areas. The Capybara has joined in and the Zoo is deciding on potential replacement species since the exhibit has a water feature. The fish tank in Hippo Theater is also collected. Serengeti Crossing (known as Bongo Congo from 1997 to c. 2003), a grasslands exhibit with ostriches, blue wildebeests, Grant's zebras, and warthogs. The exhibit first opened in 1997, making it one of the first new exhibits to open at the zoo since the opening of the African Tropical Forest in 1989. Reconfigured to 1.25 acres in 2018, adding a new path and entry garden. The observation decks that once overlooked this exhibit have been collected. A new warthog boar has been brought in for female Kanunu to mate with. Kalahari Kingdom, a large Africa themed area housing two male African lion brothers. Visitors can view them through a replica of a land rover \\"crashed\\" into the exhibit, glass, or from over a moat. The opening of this exhibit in 1997 marked the first time lions had been exhibited at the zoo since the old Lion House was closed in the early 1970s. Other animals included are male and female Siberian tigers and Bengal tigers as well as some red river hogs, bongo, kori bustards, domestic Bactrian camels and African spurred tortoises. A new, male Red River Hog was brought in for breeding purposes with the resident female River Hog. Outback Trail, where visitors can view kangaroos, cockatoos, emus, North Island brown kiwis and Tawny Frogmouth. This exhibit opened around 1998, the same year the Butterfly Landing exhibit first opened. A seasonal budgerigar aviary offers opportunities to feed and be amongst the budgerigar. Giraffe Savannah, opened in 1999, is a large area containing 2 male and female Masai giraffes, 7 wattled cranes, and 2 grey crowned cranes. Seasonally, a group of, Grevy's zebras can be found coexisting with them. Bird's World, a large building with an Orient-themed exterior containing dozens of bird species in four different environments: swamp, rainforest, desert, and wetlands. Outside, there is a large flight cage for Andean condors and Steller's sea eagles, an aviary for kookaburras, Indian peacocks, and kea, with more free-flight birds, and a waterfowl pond. A three-year-old male Steller's Sea Eagle named O-washi debuted in May 2018. This building originally opened in 1912 (the same year the zoo itself opened to the public) and was renovated around the mid-1970s to exhibit birds in more naturalistic environments. In late 2018 a storm damaged the Chilean Flamingo exhibit resulting in the flock being moved on-show at the Tropical Forest and the exhibit being collected. In 2020, the former African- themed exhibit for the Greater Flamingo exhibit and the rainforest-themed exhibit for the Chilean Flamingo is joined with an Asian-themed exhibit with the White-naped Crane. In the Riverbank exhibit that once held the Tawny Frogmouth enclosure now houses a female and a male Green Iguana with the tawny frogmouth. Swifty, the Spurred Tortoise winters in the desert with finches. Butterfly Landing, a seasonal exhibit containing over 1,000 butterflies in free flight. This large outdoor \\"tent\\" also has streams and a waterfall surrounded by numerous plant species. The exhibit first opened in 1997. Nature's Neighborhood A Children's Zoo that is a three-acre complex which includes a new, walk-through aviary with assorted birds, prairie dogs, red pandas, turtles, and reeve's muntjac. There is also Franklin Farm, a barn with paddocks for livestock and an interaction area for goats with various outbuildings. Poitou Donkey, American Pony, Llama, Barn Owl, Chicken, Nigerian Dwarf Goat, Guinea Hog & Black Welsh Mountain Sheep. In 2020, a group of Java green peacocks joined the exhibit. There is also a spotted hyena exhibit, outside the Tropical Forest, that is part of any major area. It first opened in 2014. It housed an African wild dog. Also, all of the exhibits, seven for Siberian cranes, ten for king vultures, and another for the red-crowned cranes can be found in the same area. In 2020, the mandrills have joined the collection and was joined by De Brazza's monkeys.

For much of his career, he was president of the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), a non-profit human rights litigation organization based in New York City, and president of the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) based in Berlin. Ratner \\"will be most remembered for filing Rasul v. Bush, the first lawsuit challenging President Bush's wartime detentions.\\"David Cole, \\"Michael Ratner’s Army: The Fight Against Guantánamo\\", NYR Daily, 15 May 2016 He was co-counsel in representing the Guantanamo Bay detainees in the United States Supreme Court, which ruled for the detainees' right to test the legality of their detentions in United States court, saying that the Guantanamo base was effectively an extension of US territory and covered by US law.\\"Remembering Michael Ratner, Pioneering Lawyer Who Fought for Justice from Attica to Guantánamo\\", Democracy Now!, 12 May 2016. Ratner was also a president of the National Lawyers Guild (NLG) and the author of numerous books and articles, including the books The Trial of Donald Rumsfeld: A Prosecution by Book, Against War with Iraq, and Guantanamo: What the World Should Know, as well as a textbook on international human rights. Ratner was the co-host of the radio program, Law and Disorder. He and three other attorneys hosted the Pacifica Radio show that reported legal developments related to civil liberties, civil rights, and human rights. Ratner was the brother of Ellen Ratner, a radio talk show host and Fox News contributor, and Bruce Ratner, a real estate developer and former New Jersey Nets majority owner. He was a 1966 graduate of Brandeis University. He received his law degree from Columbia Law School, where he graduated first in his class. ==Academic, activist, attorney, and author== Press conference with Amnesty International and CCR in front of the US Supreme Court, 2006 ===Teaching posts=== Ratner taught law in the early 1970s. He taught at Columbia Law School and at Yale Law School. ===Activism=== Ratner opposed Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse and the Iraq War. In January 2006, he served as an expert witness at a mock tribunal staged by the Bush Crimes Commission at Columbia University. At the end of his life, Ratner was active defending Julian Assange and WikiLeaks, as well as speaking out on behalf of Jeremy Hammond and Chelsea Manning, alleged WikiLeaks sources. In June 2013, Ratner and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video supporting Chelsea Manning, who was facing court martial for disclosing files to WikiLeaks that included evidence of war crimes in Iraq. In May 2014, Michael Ratner submitted his resignation from the advisory board of the International Center for Ethics, Justice and Public Life at Brandeis, due to the university's president cutting ties with Al Quds, a Palestinian University, after a student demonstration there. Ratner declared his support for Al Quds' President, Dr Nusseibeh, and his promotion of \\"mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and the exchange of ideas\\" with Israelis. ===Civil liberties and human rights counsel=== Shortly after the US government began to detain prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba in 2002 during the so-called War on Terror, claiming they were beyond the reach of United States law as being \\"offshore\\" and military prisoners, Ratner was co-counsel with other attorneys and the CCR in a landmark case challenging the Bush position in court. They filed habeas corpus petitions on behalf of British men Shafik Rasul and Asif Iqbal, and Australians David Hicks and Mamdouh Habib, saying it was unlawful to hold the men indefinitely without determining their status. They lost in the lower courts, but in November 2003, over the objections of the administration, the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. These men and other detainees were being held incommunicado, without benefit of counsel and with no charges being brought against them. The administration had said US courts had no jurisdiction over them, but the Supreme Court disagreed, ruling in Rasul v. Bush (2004) that the detainees had habeas corpus rights as Guantanamo base was effectively an extension of US territory.Brian Duignan, \\"Rasul v. Bush\\", Encyclopædia Britannica, 2016 > It was the first time in history that the Court had ruled against the > president on behalf of alleged enemy fighters in wartime. And it was the > first of four Supreme Court decisions between 2004 and 2008 that rejected > President Bush's assertion of unchecked executive power in the \\"war on > terror.\\" This meant the detainees could be represented by counsel, and the CCR was among the groups that worked to obtain legal representation for each of the men. This led to hundreds of men being released after court challenges. Ratner and the CCR were also involved in other cases challenging the administration on its treatment of these men.\\"Historic case: 'Rasul v. Bush'\\", Center for Constitutional Rights website In 2007, Ratner filed a complaint in the courts of France requesting the criminal prosecution of US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and other US officials for the abuse and torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Ratner served as a special counsel to Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, assisting in the prosecution of human rights crimes. Ratner sued the George H. W. Bush administration to try to stop the Gulf War, the Clinton administration to try to stop the strategic bombing during the Kosovo War, and he won a case on behalf of victims of the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadžić, for war crimes. The Center for Constitutional Rights The Center for Constitutional Rights, which Ratner led, states that its mission is to defend civil liberties in the US. The group's efforts have included a legal challenge to the USA PATRIOT Act and a lawsuit on behalf of post-9/11 immigration detainees in the US. The Center also represented Maher Arar, a Canadian citizen who was \\"rendered\\", to Syria, where he was tortured. Ratner and his office have also sued two private military companies working as part of the occupation of Iraq, alleging their employees were involved in the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. ===Writings=== Ratner has published books and written newspaper articles about the Patriot Act, military tribunals, and the restriction of civil liberties since the 2001 US attacks. These writings include chapters in the books Disappeared in America, Freedom at Risk, It's a Free Country, Lost Liberties. He authored a textbook on the case of Joel Filártiga, a Paraguayan who won a 1984 judgment in a US court against the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner for his son's murder. That case established a legal precedent now used frequently by foreigners filing suit for human rights abuses, under the Alien Tort Claims Act, in US courts. ==Personal life and death== Ratner was married to Karen Ranucci. He died on May 11, 2016.

He played a leading role in disseminating the ideas of the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment, among the Jews of Bucharest.Feldman, Eliyahu, and Lucian-Zeev Herscovici. \\"Barasch, Julius.\\" Encyclopaedia Judaica. 2nd ed. Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. Vol. 3, pp. 134-135. Retrieved via Gale eBooks database, 2020-06-26; also available online via Encyclopedia.com. ==Biography== Yehuda ben Mordehai Barasch was born in Brody, Galicia (present- day western Ukraine, then in the possession of the Austrian Empire), on 17 July 1815 into a Hasidic family. As a youth he had a traditional Jewish education, before eventually engaging with the ideas of the Haskalah. He studied philosophy from 1836 at the University of Leipzig and in 1839 changed to a doctorate of medicine at the University of Berlin, which he completed in 1841. Barasch tried to settle in Moldavia, but the authorities refused to give him the licence to practice medicine, so he settled in Wallachia. In 1842, he was a physician in Călăraşi, then in 1845, in Craiova and finally settling in Bucharest. He taught natural sciences at the Saint Sava Academy in 1852 and then was a professor at Bucharest's School of Medicine and Pharmacy.Florin Manolescu, Literatura S.F., Editura Univers, Bucharest, 1980, p. 208 Beside working as a doctor, he became a radical and ardent Romanian patriot. A friend of C.A. Rosetti and Ion Heliade Rădulescu. He was a popularizer of medical science and of natural science in general, and the first Jewish Romanian journalist. In 1856—1859 he edited a journal Isis sau Natura (Isis or Nature), the first popular science magazine in Romania. The magazine published studies of astronomy, hypothetical articles about the plurality of worlds or about the most popular inventions of the time, such as aerostat and \\"submarine ships\\".Florin Manolescu, Literatura S.F., Editura Univers, Bucharest, 1980, p. 209-210 In 1858, Barasch was also the founder of the first children's hospital in Bucharest. In 1857, together with Aaron Aser and A. Vainberg, Barasch edited Israelitul Român (\\"The Romanian Israelite\\"), the first Romanian- language newspaper of the Jewish community in Romania, that was to remain in print for almost 100 years. He died in Bucharest on 31 March 1863, at the age of 47. He was buried in Bucharest in the Jewish cemetery on Sevastopol Street. After the abolition of this cemetery in the 1940s during the Ion Antonescu regime, his tomb was moved to the Philanthropy Cemetery and appeared on the List of Historical Monuments in Bucharest (2004). He is memorialized in Bucharest's historically Jewish Văcăreşti neighborhood, where the Baraşeum Theater, now home to the State Jewish Theater, the adjoining Baraşeum clinic, and the street that runs in front of the theater, formerly Ionescu de la Brad, now str.

First broadcast in 1995, the programme currently airs on Sky 1 and Sky Sports Football at 10.30am on Saturdays during the football season. As of 2010, it airs on a short broadcast delay in order to edit bad language and/or inappropriate content from guests. Its best-known presenters were Helen Chamberlain, who presented the show for 22 years, and Tim Lovejoy, who hosted from 1996 to 2007. As of 2019, its current presenters are John Fendley and ex- footballer Jimmy Bullard. ==Key features== ===Fans of the Week=== The \\"Fans of the Week\\" feature is a mainstay of the show - eight fans of a British football club feature as studio guests every week, seated in a section of the set known as the \\"Luther Blissett Stand\\", introduced in December 1997. They were featured in various aspects of the show, culminating in a team footballing challenge at the end of the programme. The feature was dropped for the 2015–16 season when the programme's running time was cut to 90 minutes. ===The car park game=== The challenge involves the fans attempting to kick a football through a number of holes within the sixty second time limit. The challenge has been renamed almost every season, along with the props and background music for the feature. The other studio guests all have the opportunity to attempt to score as well. Its various guises through the years include: *\\"Volley Challenge\\" (2015–present) - Fans must volley a shot and try and score past a \\"celebrity\\" 'keeper each week. The contestants are a set of football fans. *\\"The Champions League\\" (2012–2015) *\\"Wembley 2011\\" (2010–11) *\\"The Glory Hole\\" (2009–10) *\\"Road To Rome\\" (2008–09) – Fans now have a much larger hole to kick the ball through. The set now features a large Champions League trophy surrounded by players such as Steven Gerrard, Ryan Giggs, and Billy McNeill. Other features of the set include Julius Caesar holding up a red card and a red carpet displaying the Champions League logo along with the city in which the final will be played, Rome. *\\"Hollywood\\" (2007–08) – following David Beckham's move to the Los Angeles Galaxy, the game featured a Hollywood Walk of Fame-style \\"pavement\\" leading to the familiar target with a David Beckham mock-up alongside it. The stars included friends of the show with Jeff Stelling as the biggest star on the walkway. Noel Gallagher, Ricky Hatton, Mani, and Kasabian's Sergio Pizzorno also featured. *\\"Road to Wembley II\\" (2006–07) – a revision of 2005–06's \\"Road to Wembley\\" – a tongue-in-cheek response to the failure of Wembley Stadium to be completed in time for 2006 FA Cup Final. On 26 August 2006, Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno scored what was hailed to be the best goal on Soccer AM by Helen Chamberlain – flicking the ball up in front of him and unleashing a spectacular right footed volley clean through the hole target whilst wearing cowboy style boots. *\\"Road to Wembley\\" (2005–06) – the original edition was named to celebrate the return of the FA Cup Final to Wembley Stadium in May 2006, although remained unchanged despite The FA's announcement that the stadium would not be complete. The challenge was 'scoring' by hitting the ball through the hole in the letter \\"b\\" (of the inflated word \\"Wembley\\") as many times as possible in 80 seconds from 12 yards. Viewers are encouraged to text in and guess the number of times the \\"Fans of the Week\\" will get the ball through the \\"b\\". This is done with the background music of \\"Que Sera, Sera\\". Teams who score seven or more times won an \\"Easy\\" T-shirt for each member. *\\"We Are the Champions League\\" (2004–05) – celebrating Sky Sports' purchase of broadcasting rights for the Champions League, the central star of a 3D Champions' League logo was removed and made the target from 12 yards. The background music was, \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" by \\"The Ramones\\" *\\"Feed The Iron Curtain\\" (2002–03) – fans had to kick the ball through the Iron Curtain as many times as possible in one minute. Meanwhile, the Eastern European substitutes (wearing red TCCCP tracksuits - a pun on the old СССР shirts and TCP the antiseptic) would warm-up, a memorable moment from \\"Feed the Iron Curtain\\" was when one of the celebrities missed the \\"goal\\" and kicked the rebounding ball in frustration and the ball hit one of the eastern European substitutes in the face. This celebrity was Frank McAvennie and Tim and Helen loved it so much that they renamed the car park The Frank McAvennie Car Park in his honour. *\\"World Cup 2002\\" (2001–02) – a giant face of Sven- Göran Eriksson with his mouth wide open was the target, with the background music of \\"Sven, 'Gor-don', Eriksson, tra, lala, lala!\\" (to the tune of Brown Girl in the Ring). *\\"Feed the Goat\\" (2000–01) – the target being the mouth of a giant goat, with the background music of \\"Feed The Goat And He Will Score\\" (to the tune of Cwm Rhondda) – a popular terrace chant for Shaun Goater at Manchester City. *\\"Lob Star\\" (1999–00) – The target was a large net, held up by a lobster. The object being to chip the ball into the net from distance. Notably, Neil Lennon successfully found the target, only to be told he had done so before the whistle. Following the whistle, he repeated the feat. *\\"Chips\\" (1998–99) – As the name suggested, the ball had to be chipped into the target. This had to be done over a short \\"brick\\" wall. The ball boys at this time were American state troopers in the style of those in the popular TV show CHiPs. *\\"Rob Jones\\" (1996–1998) – A round target with a head shot photo of Liverpool defender Rob Jones glued onto it. The target was on a spring sticking out of a small box. Each week Tim would joke 'because Rob Jones hasn't scored for Liverpool in the 2/3/4/5 seasons he's been playing for them'. ===Soccerette=== The Soccer AM Soccerette was a feature of the show for several years. A young female modelling a Soccer AM T-shirt, which was redesigned each season acted as a competition prize. Viewers can win the T-shirt by guessing the number of goals scored by the \\"Fans of the Week\\" in their team challenge later in the show. The Soccerette was introduced by the male presenter and was asked a series of questions that almost inevitably led into premeditated gags and innuendo. The Soccerette was asked about her marital status, which results in rampant cheers if \\"single\\", and boos if the Soccerette \\"has a boyfriend\\" or \\"married\\" (although the latter was fairly rare), and a crew member would run on without a shirt and react. Former host Tim Lovejoy used to declare that the Soccerette's relationship will \\"never last\\", regardless of how long they had been together. Famous Soccerettes have included Natalie Sawyer, Jennifer Metcalfe, Lucy Pinder, Tamsin Greenway, Gemma Atkinson and Louise Cliffe. This segment was later dropped in 2015 after complaints about its outdated attitudes. ==Footballing features== ===Shocker Saturday / Sky Spoof News=== Shocker Saturday is a segment parodying Sky Sports News' Soccer Saturday, featuring Fendley playing the part of Jeff Stelling. The studio guests, standing in front of a green-screen in the studio, pretend to be match reporters. During his time co-presenting the show, Lloyd Griffith played a character named \\"Glen Stefani\\", an obvious reference to American singer-songwriter Gwen Stefani. Fendley and the \\"reporters\\" all typically link into humorous clips of various footballing antics, in addition to some non-football clips. Sky Spoof News was a segment featuring Lloyd Griffith playing a Sky Sports News presenter named \\"Glen Stefani\\", typically alongside one of the actual presenters from the channel. The segment typically features blunders from presenters and journalists, as well as entertaining football clips. On occasion, Griffith also presented from other events such as the PDC World Darts Championship. ===Unbelievable Tekkers=== Unbelievable Tekkers is a segment featuring a clip of football action from the past week, usually the best goal or piece of skill of the week. The phrase was apparently first used by Andy Ansah on Wayne Rooney's Street Striker, with the word \\"tekkers\\" meaning \\"technique\\". The introduction goes \\"Some tekkers are good...\\" (with clip of a great Wayne Rooney overhead kick), \\"Some tekkers are bad...\\" (with clip of David Dunn miskicking and falling over) \\"but some tekkers...\\" (Andy Ansah clip) \\"Unbelievable Tekkers!\\" The 2010–11 season Soccer AM T-shirt also featured this phrase. The segment is, as of 2019, called Obscene Skill, featuring a clip of football action, ending with a clip of Jamie Carragher saying \\"That's obscene that is!\\". ===Nutmeg Files=== A nutmeg is the term applied when a player plays the ball between his opponent's legs and regains control of the ball after going round him. Another ever- present feature of the show, the weekly edition of \\"The Nutmeg Files\\" shows a clip from the previous week's football matches of a player being nutmegged, while the \\"nutmegger\\" is superimposed shouting \\"NUTS!\\", \\"¡Caňo!\\" (Brazil/Portugal), \\"Tunnel\\" (Italy) and \\"Petit Pont\\" (France), depending on which country the \\"nutmegger\\" is from. This feature is (very loosely) based on The Rockford Files. The segment is, as of 2019, called Megnuts of the Week. ===Third Eye=== Third Eye has been a feature of the show from its outset, and involves viewers sending in often-comical mishaps from the television (generally football matches) that may well have been missed by the majority of the viewing audience. These typically involve people falling over or being caught doing something stupid. ===Taxi=== The feature Taxi!, accompanied by the theme tune of the US sitcom, consists of yet more clips from the previous week's live football. The clips chosen are typically embarrassing displays of showboating gone wrong. The embarrassed player's name is then suffixed to the voice-over phrase \\"TAXI FOR...\\". Concluding with the quote \\"Taxi is filmed in front of a live stadium audience.\\" The presenters highlight several embarrassing moments from the previous week's football, the worst comes last and is usually introduced with: \\"It's time for a trip to (stadium)\\". \\"Taxi for (name)!\\" ===Team Mates=== Team Mates is the section at the end of the show where a player from a football team is interviewed about their teammates, being asked questions such as which teammate is the best trainer or has the worst dress sense. ===The Crossbar Challenge=== \\"The Crossbar Challenge\\" is a feature that involves a weekly trip to the training ground of a British league football team. The entire squad, including willing coaching staff and managers, are filmed, one-by-one, introducing themselves and attempting to hit the crossbar of the goal from the halfway line. The feat is rarely accomplished - the majority of squads fail to hit the bar once. However, a successful strike generally provokes manic celebrations by the kicker and his teammates. The original background music is the instrumental \\"Seventeen Years\\" by Ratatat but this was changed to \\"Smiling\\" by The Beta Band. The current record is held by Wolverhampton Wanderers who hit the crossbar four times on 25 April 2009. The current player record is held by Graham Stack who has hit the bar three times for three different clubs (Wolves, Plymouth and Millwall). In 2007, the Ice Patrol Ship HMS Endurance's 1XI team carried out The Crossbar Challenge in Antarctica, with the goalposts semi buried in fresh snow. This was shown on the show and is acknowledged as the most southerly Crossbar Challenge, to date. ===Skill Skool=== A pre- recorded section where two members of a football team – usually a youth/academy side – pits their wits against each in showing off their best individual skills with the football. It involves a different side each week. Rocket presents this part with the two opponents, surrounded by their teammates, and with the appropriate drum and bass backing tune of \\"Don't Wanna Know\\" by Shy FX and T-Power. He begins by saying to the footballers (named Joe and Bob for example): \\"Joe, Bob, Welcome to Skill Skool. You know the rules, three rounds, best skill wins. Let's get the lesson on!\\" Sublime individual skills are shown by each competitor while being egged on by their teammates. After each have completed 3 rounds, Rocket says: \\"Joe/Bob, good skills. But there's only one winner.... Guys, give it up for Joe (cue cheering and applause). Give it up for Bob (bigger/lesser cheering and applause) Bob, you're the Skill Skool winner. Skills!\\" Rocket proceeds to thrust the ball into the mid-rift of the winner, while the teammates usually mob and even sometimes perform some prank. ===My Favourite Goal=== A famous footballer is asked to name his three favourite goals throughout his career so far, and the choices are played (in reverse order) at various stages throughout the show. Notable appearances have included Thierry Henry, Wayne Rooney, David Beckham, and Ryan Giggs. Ruud van Nistelrooy in this section was only asked to pick his top three favourite goals for Manchester United. The song used during the older version of 'My Favourite Goal' is \\"Strange and Beautiful (I'll Put a Spell on You)\\" by Aqualung. ===Our Man In A Caff=== This sketch involves crew member Trev, dressing up in a builders outfit, sitting in a café and reading the newspaper (presumably tabloid) and giving us his account of recent events in football and footballers all over the world, in a parody of James Richardson from Football Italia. This is a skit on the typical lazy English builder, having lunch in a café. Our Man In A Caff ends with Trev signing out with 'Over an Out' plus an added sign off from somebody or from somewhere. ===I'm an A League Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here=== This weekly sketch involves two crew members playing the part of Ant and Dec in Australia as if presenting the ITV show I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here, who introduce football clips from Australia's A-League, typically featuring former Premier League star Robbie Fowler, accompanied by a parody Australian commentary. While the football clip is playing, a guest attempts a \\"bushtucker trial\\" trying to find a star in \\"Georgie Thompson's box\\", a cardboard box with a picture of said Sky Sports News presenter on the front and shown to contain some form of unpleasant creature, a task at which the guest always fails. The end of the sketch generally sees \\"Ant\\" hit in the eyes by some kind of object or substance and shouting \\"I'm blind, Dec!\\", a reference to a scene from the teenage drama Byker Grove in which the real-life Ant and Dec first found fame. ==Other past comedy features== Current, and former performing crew members include \\"Fenners\\" (John Fendley), \\"Sheephead\\" (Joe Worsley), \\"Tubes\\" (Peter Dale), \\"Rocket\\" (James Long), Neil (Smythe), Robbie Knox (TRAMP! is sung every time he is mentioned to the tune of The Champ by The Mohawks), Jon Dyson, Chris Nutbeam and newest member Steve Sutcliffe. ===Tubes=== Crew member \\"Tubes\\" (Peter Dale) has had a regular feature on the show, where he has \\"one question and one question only\\" to one of the studio guests. Max asks \\"Who is your question for this week\\", and the answer results in a dimming of the studio lights and a spotlight on the questionee. After the question has been asked Tubes goes to shake the questionees hand thanking them as he does. Tubes' popularity has grown significantly - a public vote saw him being voted more popular than (crew member) Rocket - in part due to his woeful (but comic) rapping ability which he demonstrates every week before actually posing a question, his ability to keep a \\"straight\\" face is also one of his main attributes. Due to his weekly binge drinking exploits, Tim Lovejoy called for pub landlords across the country to ban Tubes from their establishments for his own good. Tubes' rapping has also been used in a parody of iTunes, where at the end instead of saying \\"iTunes\\", it says \\"iTubes\\". Some Of Tubes' Catchphrases include \\"Sickening\\" \\"Sick\\" and \\"Sickness\\". Tubes suffered a heart attack in January 2018 and spent time off show whilst recovering. ===The Dance-Off=== Each year, the Soccer AM Dance-Off is held which is a dancing competition usually involving all crew members. The crew have 15 seconds each to dance before the next contestant goes on, and each dance usually receives good natured laughing and booing from the audience. ==Former comedy features== Following Tim Lovejoy's departure, several of the crew members including \\"Fenners\\" (John Fendley), \\"Sheephead\\" and Robbie Knox also departed, which meant the end of some of the features of the show. ===Small Talk=== In Small Talk, Rocket and Arrogant Baby Elvis go around the streets of a chosen British town and ask a question related to a current event in the Football world e.g. in the episode from 13 September 2008, Baby Elvis asked people in Doncaster how they keep fit, following reports of Dimitar Berbatov being on an intensive fitness programme after his recent move to Manchester United. ===Big Stan Hibbert=== His catchphrase was \\"I'm Here All Week\\". ===Topless Weather=== A topless man reads the weather, with frequent references to gravy. ===Brad Bobley=== This is a sketch which was a parody of ex-Swansea manager Bob Bradley. The sketch is a light hearted take on the way Americans take \\"Soccer\\" and expressions used. ==Other features== ===Soccer AM webcam=== The Soccer AM Webcam was introduced in the start of the 10th season. Refreshing every 5 seconds, it gave viewers the opportunity to view a live feed from the Soccer AM Office. Due to popular demand, it was later upgraded to refreshing every 3 seconds. The webcam soon gained its own feature on the show - a soap picking out the best behind-the-scenes moments from the office, and concluding with a cliffhanger of a will he-won't he. The webcam broke in between seasons in the summer of 2006, but at the start of the following season the team announced that a new webcam had been installed with improved pictures as well as the ability for the team to zoom in on certain aspects of the office. ===The Ten- Yard Bucket Challenge=== Borne out of the link between professional footballers and golf, \\"The Ten-Yard Bucket Challenge\\" sees a professional footballer attempting to chip a golf ball into a bucket from a distance of ten yards. The football-golf link exists due mainly to the amount of free time footballers are allowed in the daytime after training sessions, and Soccer AM's homage to golf involves a single personality from the world of football who attempts the challenge. One notable attempt was from Ryan Taylor, then of Tranmere Rovers, who was not featuring in the challenge that week, but was accompanying teammate Jason McAteer. While cameras happened to be rolling, he had a go and accomplished the feat in a single attempt. Many overconfident amateurs have been known to run tallies of well over a hundred attempts. The background music to the challenge is \\"Ladyflash\\" by The Go! Team. ===Bullseye Challenge=== A part of the show where two players from a club compete to see who can hit the bullseye of a dart board first. The current holder with only two throws is Emmanuel Eboue whilst he was playing for Arsenal. ==Achievements== As its audience share grew, its influence grew in turn. Some of the show's notable influences have included: * The Save Chip campaign saw large \\"Save Chip\\" banners appear all over the world, not only in football matches. The full tag line was \\"Save Chip... Don't Let Sarah win!\\". The campaign involved a football fan's plea to help save him from his girlfriend Sarah, who would not let him watch his favourite sport. It became a cult when banners appeared at countless televised football matches across the country and also made airtime in WWE wrestling events, rugby matches and many more televised sporting (and non sporting) events. The banner also appears randomly in the first screens of the PC video game Championship Manager: Season 01/02 released by Sports Interactive. Marc Bridge-Wilkinson also promoted the campaign after scoring the winner in the 2001 LDV Final for Port Vale, lifting his shirt over his head revealing a shirt underneath which said \\"Save Chip\\" * Getting a golden star on the England football shirt. Sparked after France 98, when the French national team added a golden star to their shirt as soon as they won the FIFA World Cup, the Soccer AM team successfully campaigned to get a golden star on England's shirt to commemorate winning the World Cup in 1966. * Getting the word \\"bouncebackability\\" into the English dictionary has been credited to Soccer AM. Its creation is generally accredited to former Crystal Palace manager Iain Dowie's reference to his team's return to form in 2005, and the Soccer AM team took it upon themselves to continuously refer to the subject until their feat was accomplished later that year. The \\"Easy\\" logo from the male T-shirt *The Soccer AM regulars are immortalised in the computer game Football Manager 2005, as an unmanageable team called The Badgers. Amongst the 'players' are Rocket, Tubes, Sheephead, Paul Dalglish, Fenners, Phil Neal, John Wark and of course, Tim Lovejoy himself. All of the players can be signed by the player. They have also been featured in Football Manager 2012, featuring Max Rushden as captain. * The World of Wrestling sketch exploded into British culture in 2005. After destroying his opponent in a public place (e.g. a swimming pool), the masked \\"red\\" wrestler began a chant of \\"Easy! Easy!, whilst clapping his hands above his head, before stopping telling an observer \\"You shut up!\\" and resuming his chant of \\"Easy! Easy!\\". The sketch is a parody and play on words of the World of Sport wrestling, which had been repeated on TWC Fight! starting in early 2004. In the sketch, the masked wrestlers are based on Kendo Nagasaki, whilst the chanting is taken from Big Daddy. This chanting action has since been reintroduced thanks to the sketch and is now seen across the UK at all kinds of events - sporting or otherwise. ==Other content== *Tim Lovejoy offered five of \\"the queen's English pounds\\" to anyone who went to an English football match with a banner saying \\"Lovejoy is a legend\\", although he soon stopped after it ended up costing him too much money (mainly after Sky Sports's match coverage picked up on the competition, showing a number of banners before each match). *Tim Lovejoy and Bradley Walsh were flown by helicopter after the show to do Sky's fanzone commentary for the Arsenal v Chelsea FA Cup Final in 2002. Lovejoy has been ridiculed on Soccer AM ever since for saying \\"Oh it's okay, it's only Ray Parlour\\" moments before Parlour's spectacular opener in the 2–0 win, to which Walsh replied \\"That is some goal!\\". Whenever Parlour is mentioned, they find some way to bring this up. ==Football League Trophy Play Your Cards Right== For some seasons, Soccer AM had the privilege of being able to draw fixtures for each round of the Football League Trophy. This was normally done - in the style of British gameshow Play Your Cards Right - by the presenters cutting oversized cards onto large holders, and turning them over one at a time to generate football matches. This process was overseen by an independent adjudicator from the Football League Stuart Trigwell, known to Soccer AM as 'face', ridiculing a column in the Daily Mail referring to him as the 'Face of The Football League'. ==Merchandise== Four Soccer AM DVDs were released - The Top Ten Goals of All Time in November 2004, The Ten Greatest Players of the Last Ten Years the following year, The Greatest Matches of All Time in 2006, and Dream Team - The Greatest Team in the World in 2009. A soundtrack of indie and rock music featured in the show's goal compilations was released in June 2006. ==The Soccer AM Stadium== In July 2014, Soccer AM announced a partnership with non-league Basingstoke Town F.C.. The club's Camrose Stadium was renamed 'The Soccer AM Stadium' as part of the partnership – with the club featuring regularly on the show. \\"Soccer AM\\" producer, Rob Wakeling said \\"We’re really pleased to be supporting Basingstoke Town FC from now on – and we’ve got some very exciting things planned over the coming season\\". ==Football Walk Music== *Mr. Big Stuff (2004) (By Jean Knight) ==See also== * Sky Sports * Cricket AM * Soccer AM's All Sports Show ==References== ==External links== *Official Soccer AM website * * Category:1995 British television series debuts Category:1990s British sports television series Category:2000s British sports television series Category:2010s British sports television series Category:2020s British sports television series Category:British sports television series Category:Football mass media in the United Kingdom Category:Sky UK original programming Category:Sky Sports Category:Premier League on television Category:English Football League on television Category:English-language television shows ","title":"Soccer AM"},{"id":"1441786","text":"The Honeymoon Gang was a New York street gang of the mid 19th century. The gang was said to be so violent that they were denied protection often received by other street gangs from Tammany Hall politicians. Operating out of New York's East Side 18th Ward, the gang was notorious for their brutal attacks, especially on unsuspecting passersby at the corners between Madison Avenue and 29th Street. Known as \\"basher patrols,\\" these attacks were usually celebrated later at a local tavern. The attacks were so frequent that the neighborhood was considered unsafe for several years. The gang continued to control the 18th Ward with little, if any, interference from authorities until 1853, when New York Police Chief George W. Walling became Captain of the district. He formed a group of handpicked men, later known as the Strong Arm Squad.Walling, George W.

Wesleyville is a small coastal community in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. It is located on the Straight Shore of Bonavista Bay, on the northeast coast of Newfoundland, near the communities of Greenspond and Newtown. It was settled in the early 19th century, when residents relocated from nearby islands. ==History== The first settlers originally lived on Swain's Island, which is often called the \\"parent of Wesleyville.\\" They moved to the mainland between 1870 and 1930 to what is now called Wesleyville. Wesleyville was named in 1884 after John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist movement. By 1891 the population was close to 2,000. The town relied mostly on the Labrador fishery. With the decline of the fishery in the 1930s the population of Wesleyville began to decrease; there were less than 1,000 people living there by 1945. When roads, a hospital, and a highway were built in the 1950s, services and businesses began to improve, thus helping the population grow once more. In 1959, a central high school was also built in Wesleyville.Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador The population peaked in mid-century at about 1,200. Wesleyville is now part of the municipality of New-Wes-Valley, with a population of approximately 2,800. The municipality comprises the villages and towns of the area, including Pool's Island, Badger's Quay, Valleyfield, Brookfield, Wesleyville, Pound Cove, Templeman, and Newtown. The main employer today is a fish processing plant located in Valleyfield, owned by Beothic Fish Processors. Wesleyville is famous for its involvement, historically, in the sealing industry. ==Church history== In the 19th century there were only a few resident missionaries stationed in Newfoundland. For example, there was a resident minister in Greenspond who would visit surrounding communities to perform services there. The communities in which the missionaries were responsible for were divided up into missions and circuits. The Greenspond Mission between 1862 and 1884 grew so quickly that the missionaries found it too difficult to visit all the communities so they were broke up into circuits. For example, the growth of Methodists was so great in the late 19th century that by 1884 Wesleyville Circuit was established. The first minister for the Wesleyville Circuit was the Rev. George Bullen for one year, and then Rev. James Lumsden came in 1885 and left in 1888. The Methodist population had increased from 120 to 226 during Lumsden's ministry. The first Methodist church was built in 1874. A parsonage was built in Wesleyville in 1887, and a new section was built on the church in 1889. In 1892 there were 611 Methodists in Wesleyville; by 1912 a new Methodist church was built.

The Badr Brigade was the Iran-officered military wing of the Iran-based Shia Islamic party, Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI), formed in 1982. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq most of Badr's fighters have entered the new Iraqi army and police force. Politically, Badr Brigade and SCIRI were considered to be one party since 2003, but have now unofficially separated\\"The Supreme Council Undergoes Broad Changes in the Ranks… Hakim: We Paid a High Price in Previous Elections,\\" al- Rafidayn, Nov. 20, 2011 with the Badr Organization now an official Iraqi political party. Badr Brigade forces, and their Iranian commanders, have come to prominence in 2014 fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Iraq. It is a part of the Popular Mobilization Forces. ==History== ===SCIRI=== The organization was formed in Iran in 1982 as the military wing of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. It was based in Iran for two decades during the rule of Saddam Hussein and led by Iranian officers. It consisted of several thousand Iraqi exiles, refugees, and defectors who fought alongside Iranian troops in the Iran–Iraq War. The group was armed and directed by Iran. They briefly returned to Iraq in 1991 during the 1991 Iraqi uprising to fight against Saddam Hussein, focusing on the Shia holy cities of Najaf and Karbala. They retreated back into Iran after the uprising was crushed. In 1995, during the Kurdish Civil War, Iran deployed 5,000 Badr fighters to Iraqi Kurdistan. ===Post-invasion Iraq=== Returning to Iraq following the 2003 coalition invasion, the group changed its name from brigade to organization in response to the attempted voluntary disarming of Iraqi militias by the Coalition Provisional Authority. It is however widely believed the organization is still active as a militia within the security forces and it has been accused of running a secret prison and sectarian killings during the Iraqi Civil War. Because of their opposition to Saddam Hussein, the Badr Brigade was seen as a U.S. asset in the fight against Baathist partisans. After the fall of Baghdad, Badr forces reportedly joined the newly reconstituted army, police, and Interior Ministry in significant numbers. The Interior Ministry was controlled by SCIRI, and many Badr members became part of the Interior Ministry run Wolf Brigade. The Iraqi Interior Minister, Bayan Jabr, was a former leader of Badr Brigade militia. In 2006 the United Nations human rights chief in Iraq, John Pace, said that hundreds of Iraqis were being tortured to death or executed by the Interior Ministry under SCIRI's control.Andrew Buncombe & Patrick Cockburn, \\"Iraq's death squads: on the brink of civil war,\\" The Independent (Feb. 26, 2006). Retrieved 7 February 2015. According to a 2006 report by the Independent newspaper: 'Mr Pace said the Ministry of the Interior was \\"acting as a rogue element within the government\\". It was controlled by the main Shia party, the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (Sciri); the Interior Minister, Baqir Jabr al- Zubeidi, is a former leader of SCIRI's Badr Brigade militia, which was one of the main groups accused of carrying out sectarian killings. Another was the Mahdi Army of the young cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who is now part of the Shia coalition seeking to form a government after winning the mid-December election. Many of the 110,000 policemen and police commandos under the ministry's control are suspected of being former members of the Badr Brigade. Not only counterinsurgency units such as the Wolf Brigade, the Scorpions, and the Tigers, but the commandos and even the highway patrol police were accused of acting as death squads during this period over a decade ago. The paramilitary commandos, dressed in garish camouflage uniforms and driving around in pick-up trucks, were dreaded in Sunni neighbourhoods. People arrested by them during this period were frequently found dead several days later with their bodies bearing obvious marks of torture.' ===Military action against ISIL=== Following ISIL's successful Anbar campaign and June 2014 offensive, the Badr Organization mobilized and won a series of battles against ISIL, including the Liberation of Jurf Al Sakhr and the Lifting of the Siege of Amirli. In early February 2015 the group, operating from its base at Camp Ashraf, fought in Diyala Governorate against ISIL. Over 100 militia were killed in the fighting, including 25 in Al Mansouryah. Badr's leader, Hadi Al- Amiri, said his militiamen were committed to the safety of Sunnis, but deep mutual suspicions remained in the light of recent sectarian killings and the suspicion that some Sunni tribes were allied with IS. ==Structure== The Badr Corps consists of infantry, armor, artillery, anti-aircraft, and commando units with an estimated strength of between 10,000 and 50,000 men (according to the Badr Organization). *Quwat al-Shahid Muhammed Baqir al- Sadrhttps://jihadology.net/category/quwet-al-shahid-muhammed-baqir-al-sadr/ *Liwa al-Imam Muhammad al-Jawad *Liwa Karbala *Tashkil al-Karar *The Turkmen Brigade Northern Front *Quwat al-Shaheed al-Qa'id Abu Muntadhar al-Muhammadawi *Tashkil Malik al-Ashtar *Fayli Kurd Brigade \\\\- 16 June 2014http://www.alarshef.com/maqalat/m-alseyasia/2017-06-15-15-45-04 **Led by Secretary-General of Supreme National Front for Feyli Kurds, Maher al-Feyli **Size: 1000 - 5000http://www.basnews.com/ar/babat/144650 **Helped by: Saad al-Madlabi (from State of Law Coalition) and Mouin AlKazmi ==See also== * Private militias in Iraq * List of armed groups in the Iraqi Civil War * List of armed groups in the Syrian Civil War * Holy Shrine Defender ==References== ==External links== * Michele Norris & Ivan Watson, \\"Profile: Opposition Group Claiming to Represent Iraqi Shias Enters Northern Iraq,\\" All Things Considered (March 10, 2003), NPR. * Counter Extremism Project profile Category:Popular Mobilization Forces Category:Arab militant groups Category:Conservative parties in Iraq Category:Factions in the Iraq War Category:Military wings of political parties Category:Paramilitary forces of Iraq Category:Rebel groups in Iraq Category:Shia Islamic political parties Category:Anti-ISIL factions in Iraq Category:Anti-ISIL factions in Syria Category:Pro-government factions of the Syrian Civil War Category:Organizations designated as terrorist by the United Arab Emirates Category:Shia Islamist groups Category:Organizations designated as terrorist in Asia Category:Paramilitary organizations based in Iraq Category:Jihadist groups in Iraq Category:Axis of Resistance ","title":"Badr Organization"},{"id":"1441793","text":"The UEL Docklands Campus, The Square UEL Docklands Campus, Halls of Residence The University of East London Docklands Campus is a campus of the University of East London (UEL) situated in the Docklands area of east London.

He was educated at Winchester College where he was captain of cricket and football. On leaving school he was commissioned in the Coldstream Guards. He then went up to King's College, Cambridge where he graduated with a Master of Arts degree. ==Sporting career== He was a Cambridge blue in five different sports (cricket, football, rackets, squash and rugby fives) and captain in four\\"Public school headmaster, first class cricketer, president of MCC and rare sporting all-rounder\\" Daily Telegraph Wednesday 7 March 2018 and was a successful amateur cricketer for Cambridge University and Sussex (where he was captain in 1954).

He represented England in two Test matches versus the West Indies in 1950 (at Old Trafford and Lord's). Teaching commitments meant that he only played one full summer of county cricket, in 1954. He later held several offices in sports administration, such as President of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) (1981–1982), the Cricket Council (1981–1982), the English Schools Cricket Association (1965–2000) and the Cricket Society (1983–1998).

He has named or described over 2,800 new species and subtribes, more than one tenth of the number of species in the Asteraceae. This figure is also about one quarter of the number of flowering plants described by Carl Linnaeus. Robinson has written over 650 publications, mainly on the Asteraceae, mosses (Bryophyta), Marchantiophyta, and the long- legged fly family Dolichopodidae (describing over 200 new species and 6 new genera, such as Harmstonia and Nanomyina) and many other subjects. He received a B.S. from Ohio University in 1955, an M.S. from the University of Tennessee in 1957, a Ph.D. from Duke University in 1960. After a short stint (from 1960 to 1962) as assistant professor at Wofford College (Spartanburg, South Carolina), he became Associate Curator of lower plants at the Smithsonian Institution, Washington (1960–1962). Later he was appointed Associate Curator (1964–1971) and finally Curator of Botany from 1971. ==Research== Together with collaborators, he investigated the taxonomy of several bryophytes, green algae (co-naming a new genus Struveopsis), vines of family Hippocrateaceae (nom. cons.) (now a synonym of the staff vine family Celastraceae). He made a study of the phylogeny of the genus Houstonia, madder family (Rubiaceae). In 1974 he named a new subtribe Luziolinae of oryzoid (= rice-like) grasses Poaceae, but this was not supported by a recent molecular study (Duvall et al., 1993). He named the small genus Synanthes (P.Burns-Balogh, H.Rob. & Mercedes S.Foster) of epiphytic orchids from Paraguay. He also named 32 new species from the bromeliad family (Bromeliaceae), mostly in the genera Navia and Lindmania, Connellia, and Cottendorfia, such as Navia albiflora L.B.Smith, Steyermark & Robinson and Navia aliciae L.B.Smith, Steyermark & Robinson. In 1999 he merged Pepinia into Pitcairnia at generic level. (Harvard Papers in Botany Vol. 4 no.1 195 – 202). He made several illustrations for the Catalog of Botanical Illustrations, Smithsonian Institution, such as for Brewcaria duidensis (Bromeliaceae). But his major interest went to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). In the neotropical tribe Eupatorieae (Asteraceae), Robinson (with co-worker King) has named at least one species in 27 of the genera. He later worked on the reorganization of the tribes Senecioneae, Heliantheae, Liabeae and lately Vernonieae. The tribe Eupatorieae is known for the many secondary metabolite chemicals such as alkaloids, (poly)acetylenes, and terpenoids (see Ichthyothere). Robinson has made a detailed study of these chemicals, together with R.M. King and Ferdinand Bohlmann. This resulted in a large number of publications mostly in the journal Phytochemistry in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1970 Robinson and King stressed the need for diagnostic character analysis in his classic article entitled The new synantherology (Taxon 19: 6-11). In 1986 he gave a critical but constructive opinion on cladistics in the article. \\"A key to the common errors of cladistics\\". (Taxon. 35: 309-311). The genus Robinsonecio T.M.Barkley & J.P.Janovec (Asteraceae) is named for him. ==Awards== In 2010, Robinson received the Asa Gray Award, the highest honour of the American Society of Plant Taxonomists. == Selected works == * Rhyne, C. and H.

The neighborhood is known for its office and residential buildings, such as the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower and the MetroTech Center office complex. Since the rezoning of Downtown Brooklyn in 2004, the area has been undergoing a transformation, with $9 billion of private investment and $300 million in public improvements underway. The area is a growing hub for education. In 2017, New York University announced that it would invest over $500 million to renovate and expand the NYU Tandon School of Engineering and its surrounding Downtown Brooklyn-based campus. Downtown Brooklyn is part of Brooklyn Community District 2 and its primary ZIP Codes are 11201 and 11217. It is patrolled by the 84th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. ==History== ===Early development=== The Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, a prominent symbol of Downtown Brooklyn This area was originally inhabited by Lenape Native Americans, until the 17th century. Area close to the Wallabout Bay was called Rinnegokonk. At that time the Dutch arrived, gained control of the land, and called it Breuckelen. The waterfront area being sold by Indians to Joris Jansen Rapelje, who used the land for farm purposes. Until 1814, Downtown Brooklyn and Brooklyn Heights remained sparsely populated. Robert Fulton’s new steam ferry then began to offer an easy commuting option to and from downtown Manhattan. It made Brooklyn Heights Manhattan’s first suburb, and put Downtown Brooklyn on its way to becoming a commercial center, and the heart of the City of Brooklyn. The city was home to many prominent abolitionists at a time when most of New York was indifferent to slavery. Many Brooklyn churches agitated against legalized slavery in the 1850s and 1860s and some acted as safehouses as part of the Underground Railroad movement. Walt Whitman was fired from his job as a reporter at the Brooklyn Eagle due to his support for the Wilmot Proviso when he lived at Willoughby and Myrtle Avenues. A group of buildings at 223, 225, 227, 231, 233, and 235 Duffield Street, in addition to the African Wesleyan Methodist Episcopal Church located in MetroTech Center, were believed to be among the safehouses. The middle 19th century growth of the Port of New York caused shipping to spill over into the City of Brooklyn; many buildings now used for other purposes were built as warehouses and factories. Manufacturing intensified with the building of the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges; buildings from that time include the 1915 Sperry Gyroscope Company building, now known as the Howard Building of CUNY. New, extensive infrastructure served the Brooklyn Bridge trolleys. ===20th century=== Adams Street/Brooklyn Bridge Boulevard, a major corridor through Downtown Brooklyn Tillary Street, another major corridor Following World War II, the City Planning Commission, in conjunction with the Borough President’s Office, presented and adopted a Master Plan for the Civic Center, which included an ambitious public improvements program. The program included plans for new buildings for City and State agencies, significant street widening and major housing construction in adjacent areas. A study conducted eight years later highlighted the progress made, emphasizing the widening of Adams Street (and later Boerum Place), which created a long and sweeping approach to Downtown Brooklyn from a modernized Brooklyn Bridge. By the late 1960s, the patterns of transition that affected much of urban America initiated concern to protect the borough’s Central Business District from deterioration. In 1969, a comprehensive plan for the entire city was completed and in the report the City Planning Commission stated, “Downtown Brooklyn’s economy is vital to the borough and important to the entire metropolitan region.” In re-affirming Downtown Brooklyn’s central role and identifying its problems, the Plan was optimistic that a combination of public and private efforts would stimulate office and commercial construction. A 23-story privately financed office tower at Boerum Place and Livingston Street opened in 1971 and the anticipated growth of the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) succeeded far beyond expectations, giving this cultural institution an important role as a symbolic anchor amid increasing decay during the following decade. After suffering with the rest of New York through the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970s, Borough President Howard Golden, first elected in 1977, moved forward with a more aggressive economic development program to revitalize Downtown Brooklyn. He identified the need for greater equity in resource allocation between Manhattan and the city’s other boroughs. An important moment in the history of Downtown Brooklyn came in 1983 with the release of a Regional Plan Association report for the area. According to the document, Downtown Brooklyn could become the city’s third-largest business district because of its proximity to Lower Manhattan (closer by subway than Midtown). It also could serve as a prime location for high technology industries and new market-rate housing. The State Street Houses Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. ===Rezoning=== Historically, Downtown Brooklyn was primarily a commercial and civic center, with relatively little residential development. Housing included a few apartment buildings on Livingston Street, and seven 15-story buildings that make up the over 1,000 unit Concord Village co-op development on Adams Street, at the borders of both Brooklyn Heights and Dumbo.Lawrence Street in Downtown Brooklyn Since the rezoning of parts of Downtown Brooklyn in 2004 to allow for denser residential development, the area has seen the arrival of new condominium towers, townhouses, and office conversions. In all, 14,000 residential units were planned for Downtown Brooklyn at that time. A New York Sun article from November 7, 2007, reports on the arrival of Downtown Brooklyn as a 24/7 community, estimating that 35,000 residents will come to the area in the next five years. In January 2008, residents started moving into the new residential buildings, according to a New York Sun article. The New York City Department of City Planning approved another, significant rezoning for portions of Downtown Brooklyn, including the Fulton Mall area, which resulted in significant expansion of office space and ground-floor retail, such as those at City Point. The rezoning consists of \\"zoning map and zoning text changes, new public open spaces, pedestrian and transit improvements, urban renewal, [and] street mappings\\".Downtown Brooklyn, New York City Department of City Planning. Accessed October 9, 2007. The City Planning initiative also seeks to improve the connections between Downtown and the adjacent neighborhoods of Cobble Hill, Boerum Hill, and Fort Greene. , the rezoning of Downtown Brooklyn had caused gentrification in nearby neighborhoods. Affordable housing was created in the area after the 2004 rezoning, with 420 affordable units in 2014. The housing increase has also resulted in positive effects on other aspects of Downtown Brooklyn's economy as well, with revenues for the area's hospitality industry having tripled since 2004. Some of this gentrification was controversial, however. In 2007, the city government was to acquire the houses at 223–235 Duffield Street via eminent domain, then demolish the houses and replace them with 500 new hotel rooms, 1,000 units of mixed-income housing, more than 500,000 square feet of retail space, and at least 125,000 square feet of new office space in the area; however, only 231 Duffield Street was replaced by a hotel. Still, this caused historians to protest over the planned demolition of the historic houses because of their importance to abolitionists during the American Civil War. ==Structures== Brooklyn Borough Hall with holiday lighting Downtown Brooklyn is the civic and commercial downtown center of the former City of Brooklyn, which, as of 2010, has 2.6 million residents. The area includes Brooklyn Borough Hall, the Kings County New York State courthouse, and the Theodore Roosevelt Courthouse for the federal Eastern District of New York. Schools include Brooklyn Friends School, St. Francis College, St. Joseph's College, Brooklyn Law School, NYU Tandon School of Engineering, Center for Urban Science and Progress, New York City College of Technology, and Long Island University. Attractions within the area include the Fulton Mall, Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York Transit Museum and Barclays Center. Three days a week the Borough Hall Greenmarket, featuring fresh produce from local farmers, operates on the plaza fronting Borough Hall. Formerly called Supreme Court Plaza, the location was renamed as Columbus Park in 1986. ===Points of interest=== MetroTech Center, a business and educational center, lies between Flatbush Avenue and Jay Street, above the Jay Street – MetroTech subway station, north of the Fulton Street Mall, and south of the busy Tillary Street. The original location of Junior's, founded by Harry Rosen in 1950. The building, at the corner of DeKalb Avenue and Flatbush Avenue Extension, is 17,000 square feet of red-and-white-striped menus, flashbulb- adorned signs, rust-colored booths and a wooden bar. A shrine to the Brooklyn of old, it has become a must-visit for politicians from borough presidents to President Barack Obama, who bought two cheesecakes and a couple of black-and- white cookies during an October 2013 visit with Bill de Blasio. 9 DeKalb Avenue, a residential skyscraper currently under construction adjacent to the Dime Savings Bank of New York. Once complete, it will become the first supertall building in Brooklyn and the tallest structure in New York City outside of Manhattan. Cadman Plaza Park, named for a prominent evangelist, provides of green space in the neighborhood, and was recently renovated by the New York City Parks Department. These and other parks form a long mall from Borough Hall to Brooklyn Bridge. A new park is also planned for the area, known as the Willoughby Square Park. ==Bridge Plaza== At the northeastern corner of Downtown Brooklyn is Bridge Plaza, bounded by Flatbush Avenue Extension and Manhattan Bridge on the west, Tillary Street on the south, and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) on the north and east. The newer term RAMBO, an acronym for Right Around The Manhattan Bridge Overpass is sometimes applied to the area, comparing it to DUMBO. The neighborhood was connected to Vinegar Hill until the 1950s, when construction of the BQE effectively isolated it from surrounding areas. ==Post office and ZIP Codes== NRHP) Downtown Brooklyn is served by two ZIP Codes: 11201 north of DeKalb Avenue and 11217 south of DeKalb Avenue. The United States Postal Service operates the Brooklyn Main Post Office at 271 Cadman Plaza East. ==Transportation== Jay Street–MetroTech station entrance in the AVA DoBro Building Downtown Brooklyn is connected with Manhattan by the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. The neighborhood has extensive public transportation accessibility; it is served by the New York City Subway and many bus lines. All but one Manhattan trunk line in Lower Manhattan has a direct connection to Downtown Brooklyn. From south to north, the IRT Lexington Avenue Line () via the Joralemon Street Tunnel, the BMT Broadway and BMT Nassau Street Lines () via the Montague Street Tunnel, the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line () via the Clark Street Tunnel and the IND Eighth Avenue Line () via the Cranberry Street Tunnel provide that service. Slightly farther north, the Manhattan Bridge () and Rutgers Street Tunnel () also feed subway trains from the Lower East Side into Downtown Brooklyn. Major stations in the neighborhood are: * Jay Street–MetroTech () * Court Street–Borough Hall () * DeKalb Avenue () * Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets () * Nevins Street () * Atlantic Avenue–Barclays Center () A $130 million capital project to connect Lawrence Street–MetroTech () and Jay Street–Borough Hall (), which also included renovation of both stations, was completed on December 10, 2010. It features an underground corridor on Willoughby Street connecting both stations, which includes new escalator and elevator access to Lawrence Street. The Long Island Rail Road stops at the Atlantic Terminal, located at the intersection of Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues. ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in Brooklyn ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Downtown Brooklyn Rezoning, New York City Department of City Planning * The history of Downtown Brooklyn, and Cadman Plaza Park, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation * Dowtown Brooklyn Partnership. downtownbrooklyn.com Category:Neighborhoods in Brooklyn Brooklyn ","title":"Downtown Brooklyn"},{"id":"1441822","text":"The Natchez District was one of two areas established in the Kingdom of Great Britain's West Florida colony during the 1770sthe other being the Tombigbee District. The first Anglo settlers in the district came primarily from other parts of British America. The district was recognized to be the area east of the Mississippi River from Bayou Sara in the south (presently St. Francisville, Louisiana) and Bayou Pierre in the north (presently Port Gibson, Mississippi). It became a center of wealth in the antebellum years, as a trading center for slaves and cotton, and the center of cotton culture in the Old Southwest. Today, this area corresponds roughly with and includes most of the lands south of Interstate 20 and west of Interstate 55 in the state of Mississippi, in the southwest corner of the state. After the United States made the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 of large territories formerly controlled by France west of the Mississippi River, the lowlying delta area on the west side of the river became considered part of the Natchez District. Several parishes were developed for plantation cotton cultivation here in the antebellum era, unlike southern Louisiana, where sugar cane was the dominant commodity crop. The Louisiana Natchez District included the parishes of Carroll (split between East Carroll and West Carroll in 1877), Concordia, Madison and Tensas.John C. Rodrigue, Reconstruction in the Cane Fields: From Slavery to Free Labor in Louisiana's Sugar Parishes, 1862--1880, LSU Press, 2001, p. 176 ==History== ===Origins=== The district was the home of the Natchez and other people, before Europeans arrived. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchez_people Prior to its development in the late 18th century, this area had been known to Europeans for many years, primarily French explorers and colonists. The French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville had passed through the area in 1699 and had christened both the Amité and the Tangipahoa rivers. In the early 18th century, settlers from Louisiana began to introduce African slaves and the plantation system to the area. The first important plantation crop was tobacco. In 1774, Great Britain enlarged the boundaries of the West Florida colony—established in 1763 from territory along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast taken from France and Spain following the French and Indian War (the Seven Years' War)—from the 31st parallel north to 32° 22′ north. By 1776, a sizable colony of English-speaking planters had settled there. The area nearest the Mississippi River was developed first, as it had important transportation access via the river. Later, as a riverport, cotton and slave market, it became the wealthiest area in the antebellum South. At the end of the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain ceded West Florida to Spain as part of the 1783 Treaty of Paris. When this transaction was made however, West Florida's boundaries, which had changed while under British sovereignty, were not specified. As a result of this omission, control of the region was claimed by both Spain and the United States; resulting in a dispute commonly referred to as the West Florida Controversy. Spain claimed sovereignty over the region south of boundary established for West Florida by the British in 1774. The U.S. claimed that Spain had regained only the territory transferred to Great Britain in 1763that laying south of the 31st parallel. In 1784, the Spanish closed New Orleans and the Mississippi River Delta, which they controlled, to American goods coming down the Mississippi. After several years of negotiations, Spain and the United States signed a treaty of friendship October 27, 1795. Commonly called Pinckney's Treaty, the agreement defined the border between the United States and Spanish Florida, and guaranteed the United States navigation rights on the Mississippi River, and the right to transfer goods without paying cargo fees (right of deposit) when they transferred goods from one ship to another at the Port of New Orleans.Gerard H. Clarfield, \\"Victory in the West: A Study of the Role of Timothy Pickering in the Successful Consummation of Pinckney's Treaty.\\" Essex Institute Historical Collections 101.4 (1965): 333+. Nine months later, on August 3, 1796, the U.S. officially took possession of the region. Then, on April 7, 1798, the United States Congress established the Mississippi Territory (comprising both the Natchez and Tombigbee districts), with Natchez as its first capital. ===Cotton boom=== Eli Whitney’s development of the cotton gin in the late 18th century contributed to the development of the area, and the Deep South as a whole, as it made mechanized processing of short-staple cotton profitable. This type of cotton was better suited to the upland areas of the Deep South. Planters in the Natchez District became very wealthy by converting their tobacco plantations to cotton, for which there was a large market between 1785 and 1800. The rich loess soils proved very fertile for cotton cultivation. The planters developed new, more productive strains of cotton, improved cotton gins, and developed a large-scale system dependent upon both machinery and large numbers of slaves. Their model was expanded in the antebellum South, creating such a demand for slaves that more than one million were transported from the Upper South in the domestic slave trade. They were brought overland, by riverboat, and by ocean-going ships to New Orleans. This forced migration broke up families and transplanted a large new African-descended population (with also European and Native American ancestry among many) to the area. The Deep South developed as a strong center of African-American culture. Many cotton planters became so wealthy that they acquired thousands of acres and hundreds of African American slaves to work the lands. They built elegant mansions in and around the town of Natchez, and they hired overseers to manage their plantations in the countryside. Stephen Duncan (1787-1867) of Mississippi was reported to have owned more than 1,000 slaves, making him the richest cotton planter in the world at the time. In 1806, an improved Mexican variety of cotton made the commodity crop even more profitable. The Mexican variety was crossed with the older black-seeded species to make improved varieties that made the state of Mississippi famous. The most noted cotton varieties (Belle Creole, Jethro, Parker, and Petit Gulf) were bred in Mississippi. In 1803 the United States had made the Louisiana Purchase, acquiring vast territories west of the Mississippi River. The lowlying delta area west of the river across from Natchez also became informally considered part of the Natchez District. Unlike southern Louisiana, which was devoted to sugar cane cultivation, this area was developed for cotton plantations. When organized, the parishes included Carroll Parish, Louisiana (split between East Carroll and West Carroll in 1877), Concordia, Madison and Tensas. Following the American Civil War, African Americans here joined the Republican Party, as did others in the state. They were severely suppressed after Reconstruction. For example, whites allowed no black voters in East Carroll Parish, which was majority black, until a federal judge registered some in 1962.Adam Fairclough, Race & Democracy: The Civil Rights Struggle in Louisiana, 1915-1972, University of Georgia Press, 1999John Henry Scott, Cleo Scott Brown. Witness to the Truth: My Struggle for Human Rights in Louisiana, Univ of South Carolina Press, 2003, pp. 18-20 The cotton boom of the early 19th century spread across the South from two primary cultural hearths: coastal South Carolina and the Natchez District. Cotton plantations were developed throughout the Southeast. In the Carolinas, Georgia, and Alabama, the cotton-growing areas became known as the Black Belt. From Natchez, the cotton plantation system spread north into the Mississippi embayment region, and west along the rivers of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas. In the antebellum years, nearly all plantations were developed with frontage on a river, for transportation. The U.S. government recognized the strategic importance of Natchez early on, and as the city developed as a primary cotton port, Congress financed the building and improvement of roads leading to it. The U.S. Army widened the Natchez Trace, which connected the region to Nashville, Tennessee, in order to accommodate wagons. The road was placed under the oversight of the Postmaster General of the United States, making it one of the earliest national highways. ==See also== *West Florida *Battle of Baton Rouge (1779) *Fort Rosalie *History of Mississippi ==References== ==Further reading== * Aaron D.

An open mic (or open mike) (derived from the expression \\"open microphone\\") is a live show at a coffeehouse, nightclub, comedy club, strip club, institution or pub at which audience members who are amateur or professional may perform on stage, often for the first time, or to promote an upcoming performance. Typically, as the name suggests, the performer is provided with a microphone which is plugged into a PA system, to make the individual's performance loud enough for the audience to hear. Often the performers sign up in advance for a time slot with the host or master of ceremonies, typically an experienced performer or the venue manager or owner. The master of ceremonies may screen potential candidates for suitability for the venue and give individuals a time to perform in the show. These events are focused on performance arts like poetry and spoken word, music (often singer-songwriters who accompany themselves on guitar), and comedy. Less commonly, small groups, such as a small rock band duo/trio or a comedy duo may appear. Group performances are uncommon, because of the space and the logistics of loading in and soundchecking such a group. In strip club terms, amateur night is a contest for everyday women and men who compete for a cash prize by taking their clothes off just like professional strippers. Open mic nights may have no cover charge, or a very low cover charge, although the venue may have a gratuity jar, \\"pass the hat\\" for donations or hold a raffle with various prizes. Venues that have no charge make revenue from selling alcoholic beverages and food. The performers are not typically paid, although the venue may recompense the performers with a beverage or meal. The host or MC, as an experienced professional, is usually paid for their services. The host or MC may perform at some point during the evening, either a full set or to fill in when an amateur member is not available for their slot. Open mic events are somewhat related to jam sessions, in that in both cases amateur performers are given the opportunity to sing or play instruments. The difference is that jam sessions often involve musical ensembles, possibly even a house band or rhythm section and a jam session may involve the participation of professional performers, especially at a high-end jazz club. ==Music== A musician performs open mic at No Name Bar in Sausalito, California. These shows provide an opportunity for emerging musicians to gain experience performing to a live audience without having to go through the process of getting normal music gigs, which is very difficult to do without experience or a demo recording. Open mics provide an outlet for singer-songwriters. Prior to their popularity, the only outlet generally were folk clubs, which were not always friendly towards creators of new music, preferring traditional, well-known music. They also suggested that music performed by acoustic musicians or solo artists in this manner would necessarily be folk music, a misconception that still commonly exists today. Some organizers have chosen the title \\"acoustic night\\" or \\"acoustic club\\" in an attempt to indicate an event run broadly on the lines of a folk club, but with a much wider range of musical styles. Open mic events are most commonly held in the middle of the week or at the very end of the weekend when footfall through venues is low. They rarely occur on the hallowed Friday and Saturday night time slots when venues are busy with weekend revellers and any live performance is usually specifically booked, professional artists. The most common night for a UK open mic event is Thursday, followed by Wednesday. In the United Kingdom, the largest ongoing open mic-styled music contest is Open Mic UK, which regularly attracts 10,000 participants of all genres. The grand prize for the contest is an investment up to £30,000. The size of the event has necessitated that all participants sign up for performance slots beforehand, instead of simply walking onstage. Open mic blue jam, 2015 A popular open mic arrangement in the United States is the \\"Blues Night\\". In this format a bar or club will dedicate a particular night, usually in the middle of the week, as being \\"open mic blues night\\". The establishment may supply a house band, typically guitar, bass and drums, sometimes a keyboard. Singers, guitarists, harmonica performers who wish to play sign up, usually with the master-of-ceremonies or host. This person is tasked with screening the performers, choosing and ordering, and getting the performers on and off stage in a polite manner. Since the songs chosen need to be simple enough so that a band of musicians who have not played together can perform them without practice, blues standards are used. Songs might be announced as a \\"12-bar fast shuffle in C\\" or \\"slow 12-bar blues in F\\", or similar phrases, that should be familiar to all concerned. Lead singers, keyboards, horn players, (usually saxophones) and various percussion instruments are common additions. ==Comedy== Comedy, open-mic nights can be held at established comedy clubs, but they are more commonly held at other venues with or without a stage, often the upstairs or back room of a pub or bar, bookstores, colleges, rock clubs, and coffeehouses. They are also held in uncommon areas such as strip clubs and comic book shops. Open mic nights give emerging comedians the opportunity to practice stand-up comedy, something they cannot do without a live audience. The audience for a typical comedy open mic is other comedians. Those underage must have their parents attend clubs with them. More experienced comedians may use open mics as an unpaid opportunity to work out newer material or a new character. Open-mic comedy nights are most widespread in larger English- speaking cities with a well-established stand-up comedy scene (esp. London and New York City). Stand-ups also use open mics for networking to find both paid and unpaid work opportunities. ===Comedy format=== Stand-up comedy performances always use microphone and amplification as an industry standard. Open mics have no minimum requirements or experience needed to perform. The average format is \\"show and go.\\" In a typical open mic night, acts will get three to seven minutes of stage time. A first-time open mic-er needs approximately three minutes of material for a five-minute slot. All stand-up performed must be an original creation. An open mic should be no longer than ninety minutes or be more than fifteen acts. A comedy open mic will not normally exceed 30 people. Open mic hosts try to seat audience members close together and near the stage; a lack of close seating leads to less enjoyable shows. Performing first on an open mic roster puts the comic at a disadvantage, due to the audience being \\"cold,\\" and is considered the most challenging spot to perform. It is common practice for stand-ups to record their sets for later review and rehearsal. ===The light=== A comedian will get \\"the light\\" (often a mobile/cell-phone) one minute before their set is over, to finish up the joke they're on. Those who ignore the light might get banned from that mic. ===Other types of comedy open mics=== Other types include booked shows and bringer shows. Booked shows have a normal format, but performers reserve spots (one week to month) in advance. Bringer shows are presented in a showcase format, with each performer mandatorily bringing 5–15 people (with a cover charge and a two-drink minimum, per person) and is seen as exploitative. ==Poetry, rapping, and spoken word== Poetry and spoken word open mics feature a host, who is normally a poet or spoken word artist, poets and spoken word artists, and audience members. Sometimes open mic nights have featured readers, or are part of a writing workshop, but generally a sign-up sheet is available for anyone interested in participating. Each participant is then called to come to the microphone and read a selection or two. Writers may attend an open mic to try out a new piece for an audience or to find out more about the local writing community. Others attend poetry open mics just to listen. Poetry/spoken word open mics range from laid back, serene settings to lively sessions where readers and/or performers compete for audience applause. They are usually held in libraries, coffee houses, cafes, bookstores and bars. Each poet or spoken word artist is often asked to keep their performances to a minimum/specified time slot, giving each performer enough time to share some of their work with the audience. The host or MC acts as a \\"gatekeeper\\", determining which performers are suitable for the event. If a performer goes over their time limit, the host diplomatically thanks the performer for their contribution and asks them to yield the stage for the next performer. ==Strip club== In most strip clubs, amateur night is a contest held by the clubs themselves where women and men compete for cash by stripping just like their stripper counterparts. ==Rarer niche variations== The terms \\"open deck\\" (where deck refers to the kind of turntable used by a DJ) and \\"open reel\\" (where reel refers to a 35 mm film reel) are used for more niche open mic events where keen amateurs can meet to exhibit and critique their skills/artform.

Two dry docks and machine shops were established to the south at the western end for ship repairs by R & H Green & Silley Weir (later River Thames Shiprepairs Ltd). From the 1960s onwards, the Royal Albert Dock experienced a steady decline – as did all of London's other docks – as the shipping industry adopted containerisation, which effectively moved traffic downstream to Tilbury. It finally closed to commercial traffic along with the other Royal Docks in 1981. The dock viewed from the west in 1973. Redevelopment in the late 20th century included the construction of London City Airport which was built on the south bank of the dock with a single runway and completed in 1987. At the eastern end of the north bank the University of East London Docklands Campus opened in 1999. Redevelopment also included the London Regatta Centre which was built at the western end of the north bank and opened in 2000. In the early 20th century 'Building 1000' was built on the north bank of the dock at a cost of £70 million and was completed in 2004. In May 2013, the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced a development of the Royal Albert Dock which would be worth £6 billion to the capital’s economy and would create over 20,000 jobs. With CITIC Construction assigned as main contractor, and Multiplex assigned as principal sub-contractor, construction officially began on June 2017. Phase 1 of the project was completed in the first quarter of 2018, consisting of 21 buildings with 460,000 sq ft of office space and 140,000 sq ft of retail and public realm. Phase 2 is expected to begin late 2020, which will consist of further office and retail spaces, along with residential units and membership clubs. ==Gallery== File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-022.jpgView from the riverside File:RAD view from waterside.jpgA brand new waterside development and dynamic commercial district File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-069.jpgRAD London Altitude Lobby File:RAD London Singlo Square.jpgRAD London Singlo Square File:RAD London – Dauphin Square 1.jpgRAD London – Dauphin Square File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD- Hi-032.jpgView from the riverside File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-014.jpgView from the riverside File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-029.jpg File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-078 edited.jpg File:RAD entrance from Beckton Park DLR.jpgEntrance to the dock from Beckton Park DLR station File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-155.jpg File:0809-SK- ABP-RAD-Hi-141.jpg File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-142.jpg File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD- Hi-139.jpg File:Newham Dockside building (geograph 4037925).jpgBuilding 1000 ==See also== * Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital ==References== Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 1880 Category:Infrastructure in London Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Newham Category:Geography of the London Borough of Newham Category:London docks Category:Port of London ","title":"Royal Albert Dock, London"},{"id":"1441842","text":"The Minnesota Rail Service Improvement Program (MRSI) was created in 1976 to improve Minnesota railroad services.

Thach, widow of the namesake; and commissioned on 17 March 1984 at Long Beach, Cmdr. Dale H. Moses in command. Thachs mission was to provide anti-air, anti-surface, and anti-submarine protection for carrier battle groups, naval expeditionary forces, replenishment groups, convoys, and other military and merchant shipping. The new direction for the naval service remained focused on the ability to project power from the sea in the critical littoral regions for the world. Success in the warfare environment of the 1990s and beyond required thorough evaluation, rapid decision-making and almost instantaneous response to any postulated threat. The systems aboard Thach were designed to meet these demanding and dynamic prerequisites, and to do so with minimum human interface. The Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk's video data link system brought state-of-the-art computer technology to the warfare arena, as well as integrating sensors and weapons to provide a total offensive and defensive weapons system. In addition, computers controlled and monitored the gas turbine engines (the same engines installed on DC-10 aircraft) and electrical generators. Digital electronic logic circuits and remotely operated valves were monitored in Central Control Station which initiated engine start and resulted in a \\"ready to go\\" status in less than ten minutes. ==Service history== In 1986, the ship, part of Destroyer Squadron 21, deployed to the Western Pacific as part of a battleship battle group led by . Thach was the command ship of Operation Nimble Archer, the 19 October 1987 attack on two Iranian oil platforms in the Persian Gulf by United States Navy forces. The attack was a response to Iran's missile attack three days earlier on , a reflagged Kuwaiti oil tanker at anchor off Kuwait. The action occurred during Operation Earnest Will, the effort to protect Kuwaiti shipping amid the Iran–Iraq War. In late 2006 while deployed to the Southern Pacific, Thach caught fire as she attempted to put out a fire on a drug smuggling ship. == Fate == Thach was decommissioned at Naval Base San Diego on 1 November 2013, Cmdr. Hans E. Lynch in command. The ship was homeported in San Diego and was part of Destroyer Squadron 23. She was sunk on July, 14, 2016 during the major naval exercise RIMPAC 2016. == Crest == Like all heraldic Navy insignias, Thachs crest has special meaning. The blue and gold colors are traditionally associated with the Navy; blue for the sea and gold for excellence. The pair of wings in the upper crest refers to Admiral Thach’s contributions to naval aviation as a pilot and leader. One of the contributions to naval aviation as a pilot and leader was his invention of the \\"Thach Weave,\\" symbolized by the interlaced silver chevrons. This two-plane fighter tactic, used to cover each other from enemy fighters, is still used by fighter aircraft today. The three- pronged trident is shown pointing down from the sky, symbolizing naval aviation’s role of projecting power from the sky and the sea. The three tines of the trident also represent Fight Squadron Three, the unit Admiral Thach commanded during early Pacific carrier battles in World War II. The cross within its outlined border and the wreath refer to Admiral Thach’s first and second awards of the Navy Cross and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal. The anchor in the center of the insignia focused attention on the nautical nature of both Admiral Thach’s service to his country. The ship’s motto, “Ready and Able,” was representative of Admiral Thach’s preparation and success. == Gallery == File:USS Thach;ffg43 1 (2).jpgUSS Thach (FFG-43) File:CabrilloView.jpgUSS Thach entering San Diego Bay, 2004 == References == * * * == External links == * * * navysite.de: USS Thach *MaritimeQuest USS Thach FFG-43 pages *Navy.mil March 2006 article on Bahamas goodwill mission * USS Thach (FFG-43) command histories – Naval History & Heritage Command: **1984 • 1985 • 1987 • 1988 • 1989 • 1990 • 1991 • 1992 • 1993 • 1994 • 1995 • 1996 • 1999 • 2000 • 2001 • 2002 Category:Ships built in Los Angeles Category:1982 ships Category:Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates of the United States Navy Category:Maritime incidents in 2016 Category:Ships sunk as targets Category:Shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean ","title":"USS Thach (FFG-43)"},{"id":"1441851","text":"Map of New Spain along the Gulf of Mexico Nuevo Santander (New Santander) was a region of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, covering the modern Mexican state of Tamaulipas and extending into modern-day southern Texas in the United States.

The game is for 3-6 players and the box claims that the game should take 2-6 hours to play, though as with any serious multiplayer strategy game, this can entirely depend on the players. Age of Renaissance is set in the European Renaissance historical era and is somewhat of a sequel to Civilization. In 1997, Age of Renaissance won the Origins Award for Best Pre-20th Century Board Game of 1996. ==Game play== In Age of Renaissance, each player takes the role of one of six commercial capitals of Europe: Venice, Genoa, Barcelona, London, Paris, and Hamburg. Initially each player controls one city, their capital. As the game progresses, each player's financial empire grows to a larger number of cities which provide income each turn. Each region where a city can be established also produces one of a number of different commodities: stone, wool, timber, grain, wine, cloth, metal, fur, silk, spice, gold, or ivory. Control of commodities doesn't do anything alone, but when a commodity card is played, every player with stakes in that commodity cashes in. Commodities and income from cities provide players with their two main sources of income. Players then use that money to buy counters to expand their empire, and to buy civilization advances that have various effects on the game. There is a deck of cards that players draw from. Once the deck is depleted, a new batch of cards (and some of the used cards) are shuffled in and the game progresses to the second epoch. Once the deck is depleted again, more new cards (and again some of the used cards) are shuffled to form a new deck for the third epoch. Once the deck is depleted a third time, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. Score is determined by adding up the values of a player's advances and cash, less a penalty for the \\"misery\\" of their people. The rules also suggest shorter versions of the game that end after either one or two epochs. The game has many complexities and interesting rules that add to the gameplay. For instance, each player secretly bids for the number of units they want to control in a given turn. The player with the fewest units goes first, and the player with the most goes last. However, the rules for combat give a significant advantage in effectiveness to the players going early in a turn rather than later, leaving players with an interesting choice. Another noteworthy rule is the requirement that all diplomacy take place in the open at the table, thus not allowing any secret deals to be made and speeding up the game's pace slightly. Strategically, it is critical in a game of Age of Renaissance to recognize the player in the lead. There are many cards that can significantly hurt a specific player, and these are best used to keep the leader(s) in check lest they run away with the game. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Avalon Hill games Category:Board games introduced in 1996 Category:Don Greenwood games Category:Historical board games Category:Origins Award winners ","title":"Age of Renaissance"},{"id":"1441865","text":"Maia is a fantasy novel by Richard Adams, published in 1984. It is set in the Beklan Empire, the fictional world of Adams's 1974 novel Shardik, to which it stands as a loose prequel, taking place a few years earlier. ==Plot summary== ===Part 1: The Peasant=== Maia, at 15, lives in the Beklan Empire's province of Tonilda with her mother Morca, her three younger sisters, and her stepfather, Tharrin. Their small, poor farm is on the edge of Lake Serrelind, and Maia tends to shirk her chores by swimming in the lake all day. Although Morca is pregnant with Tharrin's child, he secretly seduces Maia. When Morca discovers the affair, she sells Maia to agents of the slave-dealer Lalloc. Maia is almost raped by Genshed, one of Lalloc's employees, but is saved by Occula, a black slave girl. Maia and Occula become very good friends and even lovers. To avoid debasement by being bundled in with a detachment of more ordinary slaves, Occula enlists Maia in frightening their captors with apparent supernatural powers. The two girls are sent to the city of Bekla. Occula relates her own past: her father, a jewel-merchant, brought her across the desert to Bekla. They were received by Fornis, a noblewoman whom a coup would shortly elevate to the priestess-like status of Sacred Queen. Fornis had Occula's father murdered and his emeralds incorporated into the Sacred Queen's crown. Occula was sold as a slave; since then, she has been employed in prostitution. Adams outlines Bekla's political situation in several chapters that bypass Maia. The \\"Leopard\\" faction led by the High Baron Durakkon, Fornis, the Lord General Kembri, and the High Counsellor Sencho came to power by ceding Suba, a western province, to the neighbouring kingdom of Terekenalt. They legalised slavery, and the capital's finances are now heavily based on taxation of it, including farms for breeding slaves. The Beklan army's central authority has largely withdrawn from the provinces unless paid to come enforce the law. Pockets of rebellion have sprung up around the empire. ===Part 2: The Slave-Girl=== High Counsellor Sencho is the spymaster of the Beklan Empire. He buys both Maia and Occula as \\"bed-slaves\\". Terebinthia, the woman in charge of Sencho's household, supervises and trains them. At intervals, a peddler named Zirek visits and exchanges cryptic conversations with Occula. Beautiful, young, and fun-loving, Maia shows promise of going far, and finds some professional satisfaction in providing Sencho's decadent pleasures. She is even surprised that she enjoys the spectacle when a fellow bed-slave, the tempestuous Meris, is whipped and sold for dereliction of duty. Terebinthia rents out the girls to other rich and powerful men. Using this means of contact, Lord General Kembri secretly enlists Maia and Occula as agents and charges Maia with gaining the trust of Bayub-Otal, the dispossessed heir to Suba and a potential ally of the rebels. Bayub-Otal is the son of a dancer nicknamed \\"Nokomis\\" (\\"dragonfly\\") and the baron of a neighbouring province whose jealous wife arranged Nokomis' death when Bayub-Otal was a boy. When Sencho becomes drastically ill, he comes to depend almost solely on Occula's intense caretaking. During a garden party, Occula lures Sencho out of sight and signals her rebel confederates (by implication Zirek and Meris) to stab Sencho to death. Maia and Occula are imprisoned in the Great Temple on suspicion of colluding in Sencho's murder. Queen Fornis takes Maia from the temple priests. As Maia fails to satisfy her sexual needs, Fornis gives her to Kembri; Maia seizes on this chance to interest the queen in Occula, hoping to save her friend from execution. Kembri sends Maia to Bayub-Otal with a cover story of having escaped from the temple. Bayub-Otal takes her with him as he secretly makes his way back to Suba. Maia learns that one reason for his extraordinary standoffish respect for her is that she looks (and dances) like his dead mother, Nokomis, who is still revered throughout the province. Bayub- Otal hopes to use the resemblance to rally Suban patriotism on behalf of an alliance with Terekenalt. At the rallying site, Maia falls passionately in love with the handsome young Zen-Kurel, an officer of Terekenalt. Zen-Kurel accepts her invitation to bed, but leaves quickly to take part in a surprise attack scheduled for that very night. The River Valderra, the boundary between the two countries, is thought to be uncrossably swift and rocky, but the Terekenalters plan to ford it with heavy ropes and strong men, thus surprising the detachment of Tonildan soldiers guarding the other side. In hopes of saving her fellow Tonildans' lives as well as her lover's, Maia swims the river by herself. Despite serious wounds, she warns the Beklan commander and thwarts the Terekenalter and Suban invasion. ===Part 3: The Serrelinda=== Maia returns to Bekla, freed and celebrated. The soldiers vote her a house and money. She gains an informal title as the \\"Serrelinda\\" after Lake Serrelind. Hoping to reunite with Zen-Kurel, she takes no lovers, despite expectations that she will find a rich husband or become an expensive courtesan. Her popularity and single status bring her under threat from Fornis, who is resisting pressure to retire as Sacred Queen; since the position is filled by popular acclaim, Maia is an obvious rival despite not wanting the crown. Maia sees her stepfather, Tharrin, dragged into Bekla as a rebel informant. He is condemned to be sacrificed by the Queen. Maia does her best to free him, but Fornis foils her plan and causes his death. However, during Tharrin's last conversation with Maia, he reveals to her that her real mother was not Morca but a pregnant girl who had fled to Morca's cottage and died there in childbirth; Maia deduces she is the daughter of Nokomis' younger sister. In grief at Tharrin's death, Maia makes a desperate attempt to kill Fornis, but is thwarted by Occula, who was indeed inducted into the queen's household. Occula intends to take her own revenge on Fornis when the time is right; meanwhile she is performing the sort of sado-masochistic services of which Maia had been incapable. As civil war breaks out in the city, Maia learns that Bayub-Otal and Zen-Kurel have been brought to Bekla as prisoners. In flight from Fornis' murderous fury, Maia frees the two men, and with them and Zirek and Meris (who have been hiding since assassinating Sencho), she flees Bekla. ===Part 4: The Suban=== The former prisoners are bitterly angry at Maia for betraying them at the Valderra, which she had idealistically considered an attempt to save their lives. Nevertheless, they agree to return with her to Suba or Terekenalt. Maia and her companions recover on a remote farm, then travel for a time with rebel freebooters. Meris, always a troublemaker, gets herself killed by one of them. Maia gradually regains Zen-Kurel's and Bayub- Otal's trust by her sincere efforts to help them. After an arduous boat escape from the Beklan Empire to Terekenalt, Bayub-Otal is killed and Maia receives a marriage proposal from the man she loves most. Two years later, Maia (with her little son) visits the capital of her new country and by chance meets Occula. Occula describes at length how she killed Fornis, aided by supernatural forces. She tells Maia that the rebels succeeded in overthrowing the Leopards' regime. The story ends with Maia refusing Occula's plea to go back to Bekla; she would rather help Zen-Kurel and his father manage their farm. ==Invented terms== Much as Adams had invented words of the Lapine language for the rabbits of Watership Down, he employs some \\"Beklan\\" vocabulary for honorifics, natural objects, and sexual terms; the last \\"allows adults to leave the book within reach of children.\\" Some are also used in Shardik. == Reception == The New Yorker quipped that though Maia's career as a Playboy Bunny was reminiscent of Watership Down, she seemed more like a fish, and her swimming \\"changes the course of much more than her career\\". It said \\"Mr. Adams's artistry distinguishes his work from those didactic fantasies which border on science fiction\\"; instead the aim was entertainment, as shown in the elaborate settings, and the reader has no reason to put the book down. == References == ==External links== * Category:British fantasy novels Category:1984 British novels Category:1984 fantasy novels Category:Novels by Richard Adams Category:Novels about slavery Category:Viking Press books ","title":"Maia (novel)"},{"id":"1441870","text":"Faria Alam (born 13 February 1966) is a former Football Association secretary. ==Early life== Alam was born in East Pakistan but raised in the United Kingdom. Her family emigrated to the UK, living in Manchester, Bradford, Newcastle upon Tyne, and London. When Alam was 19 years old her mother took her to Bangladesh and arranged a marriage to a doctor. Alam divorced and returned to England. ==Football Association== After modelling and working as an administrator, in July 2003, Alam took a job as personal assistant to executive director David Davies at The Football Association, based at the organisation's headquarters in Soho Square, London. Alam began an affair with chief executive Mark Palios. When the relationship with Palios ended, she had an affair with then England football team manager Sven-Goran Eriksson. At the time Eriksson was in a relationship with Nancy Dell'Olio, though shortly before he had had an affair with TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson. As Eriksson and Dell'Olio were often photographed, interviewed, and reported on in the media, when Alam's affairs came to the attention of the public in August 2004, a media scrum ensued and she resigned her post. On leaving her job with the FA, Alam hired publicity agent Max Clifford. After negotiations, Clifford and Alam posed for photographs outside Clifford's New Bond Street offices surrounded by a scrum of photographers. Clifford brokered a number of deals for Alam, who was reportedly paid £400,000 for publication of kiss-and-tell stories about Palios, and Eriksson in The Mail on Sunday and The News of the World. Alam was paid a further £150,000 for a television interview. In October 2004, Alam made claims against the Football Association of sexual harassment, unfair dismissal, and breach of contract. In September 2005, her claims were rejected by an industrial tribunal.

It is known to be a multicomponent system that always involves enzymes of the plasma membrane and those in the cytoplasm. The PTS system uses active transport. After the translocation across the membrane, the metabolites transported are modified. The system was discovered by Saul Roseman in 1964. The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) transports and phosphorylates its sugar substrates in a single energy-coupled step. This transport process is dependent on several cytoplasmic phosphoryl transfer proteins - Enzyme I (I), HPr, Enzyme IIA (IIA), and Enzyme IIB (IIB)) as well as the integral membrane sugar permease (IIC).The PTS Enzyme II complexes are derived from independently evolving 4 PTS Enzyme II complex superfamilies, that include the (1) Glucose (Glc),(2) Mannose (Man), (3) Ascorbate-Galactitol (Asc-Gat) and (4) Dihydroxyacetone (Dha) superfamilies. == Specificity == The phosphotransferase system is involved in transporting many sugars into bacteria, including glucose, mannose, fructose and cellobiose. PTS sugars can differ between bacterial groups, mirroring the most suitable carbon sources available in the environment every group evolved. In Escherichia coli, there are 21 different transporters (i.e. IIC proteins, sometimes fused to IIA and/or IIB proteins, see figure) which determine import specificity. Of these, 7 belong to the fructose (Fru) family, 7 belong to the glucose (Glc) family, and 7 belong to the other PTS permease families. == Mechanism == The phosphoryl group on PEP is eventually transferred to the imported sugar via several proteins. The phosphoryl group is transferred to the Enzyme E I (EI), Histidine Protein (HPr, Heat-stable Protein) and Enzyme E II (EII) to a conserved histidine residue, whereas in the Enzyme E II B (EIIB) the phosphoryl group is usually transferred to a cysteine residue and rarely to a histidine. E. coli and B. subtilis. The mannose PTS in E. coli has the same overall structure as the B. subtilis glucose PTS, i.e. the IIABC domains are fused into one protein. In the process of glucose PTS transport specific of enteric bacteria, PEP transfers its phosphoryl to a histidine residue on EI. EI in turn transfers the phosphate to HPr. From HPr the phosphoryl is transferred to EIIA. EIIA is specific for glucose and it further transfers the phosphoryl group to a juxtamembrane EIIB. Finally, EIIB phosphorylates glucose as it crosses the plasma membrane through the transmembrane Enzyme II C (EIIC), forming glucose-6-phosphate. The benefit of transforming glucose into glucose-6-phosphate is that it will not leak out of the cell, therefore providing a one-way concentration gradient of glucose. The HPr is common to the phosphotransferase systems of the other substrates mentioned earlier, as is the upstream EI. Proteins downstream of HPr tend to vary between the different sugars. The transfer of a phosphate group to the substrate once it has been imported through the membrane transporter prevents the transporter from recognizing the substrate again, thus maintaining a concentration gradient that favours further import of the substrate through the transporter. With the glucose phosphotransferase system, the phosphorylation status of EIIA can have regulatory functions. For example, at low glucose concentrations phosphorylated EIIA accumulates and this activates membrane-bound adenylate cyclase. Intracellular cyclic AMP levels rise and this then activates CAP (catabolite activator protein), which is involved in the catabolite repression system, also known as glucose effect. When the glucose concentration is high, EIIA is mostly dephosphorylated and this allows it to inhibit adenylate cyclase, glycerol kinase, lactose permease, and maltose permease. Thus, as well as the PEP group translocation system being an efficient way to import substrates into the bacterium, it also links this transport to regulation of other relevant proteins. In Serratia marcescens. == Structural analysis == Three-dimensional structures of examples of all the soluble, cytoplasmic complexes of the PTS were solved by G. Marius Clore using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, and led to significant insights into how signal transduction proteins recognize multiple, structurally dissimilar partners by generating similar binding surfaces from completely different structural elements, making use of large binding surfaces with intrinsic redundancy, and exploiting side chain conformational plasticity. == References == == External links == * Category:Enzymes ","title":"PEP group translocation"},{"id":"1441890","text":"The Islamic Fayli Grouping in Iraq or Iraqi Faili Islamic Gathering is one of two Iraqi political parties of Shi'a Fayli Kurds, the other being the Fayli Kurd Islamic Union.

Once a 3D model has been created, for instance in a video game or any other 3D computer animation, the graphics pipeline is the process of turning that 3D model into what the computer displays. Because the steps required for this operation depend on the software and hardware used and the desired display characteristics, there is no universal graphics pipeline suitable for all cases. However, graphics application programming interfaces (APIs) such as Direct3D and OpenGL were created to unify similar steps and to control the graphics pipeline of a given hardware accelerator. These APIs abstract the underlying hardware and keep the programmer away from writing code to manipulate the graphics hardware accelerators (AMD/Intel/NVIDIA etc.). The model of the graphics pipeline is usually used in real-time rendering. Often, most of the pipeline steps are implemented in hardware, which allows for special optimizations. The term \\"pipeline\\" is used in a similar sense to the pipeline in processors: the individual steps of the pipeline run parallel but are blocked until the slowest step has been completed. ==Concept== The 3D pipeline usually refers to the most common form of computer 3D rendering called 3D polygon rendering, distinct from raytracing and raycasting. In raycasting, a ray originates at the point where the camera resides, and if that ray hits a surface, the color and lighting of the point on the surface where the ray hit is calculated. In 3D polygon rendering the reverse happens - the area that is in view of the camera is calculated, and then rays are created from every part of every surface in view of the camera and traced back to the camera. == Structure == A graphics pipeline can be divided into three main parts: Application, Geometry and Rasterization.Tomas Akenine-Möller, Eric Haines: Real-Time Rendering, S. 11. (PDF) 550px === Application === The application step is executed by the software on the main processor (CPU). In the application step, changes are made to the scene as required, for example, by user interaction by means of input devices or during an animation. In a modern Game Engine such as Unity, the programmer deals almost exclusively with the application step, and uses a high-level language such as C#, as opposed to C or C++. The new scene with all its primitives, usually triangles, lines and points, is then passed on to the next step in the pipeline. Examples of tasks that are typically done in the application step are collision detection, animation, morphing, and acceleration techniques using spatial subdivision schemes such as Quadtrees or Octrees. These are also used to reduce the amount of main memory required at a given time. The \\"world\\" of a modern computer game is far larger than what could fit into memory at once. === Geometry === The geometry step (with Geometry pipeline), which is responsible for the majority of the operations with polygons and their vertices (with Vertex pipeline), can be divided into the following five tasks. It depends on the particular implementation of how these tasks are organized as actual parallel pipeline steps. 550px  Definitions  A vertex (plural: vertices) is a point in the world. Many points are used to join the surfaces. In special cases, point clouds are drawn directly, but this is still the exception. A triangle is the most common geometric primitive of computer graphics. It is defined by its three vertices and a normal vector - the normal vector serves to indicate the front face of the triangle and is a vector that is perpendicular to the surface. The triangle may be provided with a color or with a texture (image \\"glued\\" on top of it). Triangles always exist on a single plane, therefore they're preferred over rectangles.  The World Coordinate System  The world coordinate system is the coordinate system in which the virtual world is created. This should meet a few conditions for the following mathematics to be easily applicable: * It must be a rectangular Cartesian coordinate system in which all axes are equally scaled. How the unit of the coordinate system is defined, is left to the developer. Whether, therefore, the unit vector of the system is to correspond in reality to one meter or an Ångström depends on the application. * Whether a right-handed or a left-handed coordinate system is to be used may be determined by the graphic library to be used. : Example: If we are to develop a flight simulator, we can choose the world coordinate system so that the origin is in the middle of the earth and the unit is set to one meter. In addition, in order to make the reference to reality easier, we define that the X axis should intersect the equator on the zero meridian, and the Z axis passes through the poles. In a Right-handed system, the Y-axis runs through the 90°-East meridian (somewhere in the Indian Ocean). Now we have a coordinate system that describes every point on Earth in three-dimensional Cartesian coordinates. In this coordinate system, we are now modeling the principles of our world, mountains, valleys and oceans. : Note: Aside from computer geometry, geographic coordinates are used for the earth, ie, latitude and longitude, as well as altitudes above sea level. The approximate conversion - if one does not consider the fact that the earth is not an exact sphere - is simple: : \\\\begin{pmatrix} x\\\\\\\\\\\\ y\\\\\\\\\\\\ z \\\\end{pmatrix}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} (R+{hasl})*\\\\cos({lat})*\\\\cos({long})\\\\\\\\\\\\ (R+{hasl})*\\\\cos({lat})*\\\\sin({long})\\\\\\\\\\\\ (R+{hasl})*\\\\sin({lat}) \\\\end{pmatrix} with R=Radius of the earth [6.378.137m], lat=Latitude, long=Longitude, hasl=height above sea level. : All of the following examples apply in a right- handed system. For a left-handed system the signs may need to be interchanged. The objects contained within the scene (houses, trees, cars) are often designed in their own object coordinate system (also called model coordinate system or local coordinate system) for reasons of simpler modeling. To assign these objects to coordinates in the world coordinate system or global coordinate system of the entire scene, the object coordinates are transformed by means of translation, rotation or scaling. This is done by multiplying the corresponding transformation matrices. In addition, several differently transformed copies can be formed from one object, for example a forest from a tree; This technique is called instancing. : In order to place a model of an aircraft in the world, we first determine four matrices. Since we work in three-dimensional space, we need four-dimensional homogeneous matrices for our calculations. First, we need three rotation matrices, namely one for each of the three aircraft axes (vertical axis, transverse axis, longitudinal axis). : Around the X axis (usually defined as a longitudinal axis in the object coordinate system) R_x=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\cos(\\\\alpha) & \\\\sin(\\\\alpha) & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & -\\\\sin(\\\\alpha) & \\\\cos(\\\\alpha) & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} : Around the Y axis (usually defined as the transverse axis in the object coordinate system) R_y=\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\alpha) & 0 & -\\\\sin(\\\\alpha) & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sin(\\\\alpha) & 0 & \\\\cos(\\\\alpha) & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} : Around the Z axis (usually defined as vertical axis in the object coordinate system) R_z=\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\cos(\\\\alpha) & \\\\sin(\\\\alpha) & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\sin(\\\\alpha) & \\\\cos(\\\\alpha) & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} We also use a translation matrix that moves the aircraft to the desired point in our world: T_{x,y,z}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ x & y & z & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix}. : Remark: The above matrices are transposed with respect to the ones in the article rotation matrix. See further down for an explanation why. Now we could calculate the position of the vertices of the aircraft in world coordinates by multiplying each point successively with these four matrices. Since the multiplication of a matrix with a vector is quite expensive (time consuming), one usually takes another path and first multiplies the four matrices together. The multiplication of two matrices is even more expensive, but must be executed only once for the whole object. The multiplications ((((v*R_x)*R_y)*R_z)*T) and (v*(((R_x*R_y)*R_z)*T)) are equivalent. Thereafter, the resulting matrix could be applied to the vertices. In practice, however, the multiplication with the vertices is still not applied, but the camera matrices - see below - are determined first. : For our example from above, however, the translation has to be determined somewhat differently, since the common meaning of Up - apart from at the North Pole - does not coincide with our definition of the positive Z axis and therefore the model must also be rotated around the center of the earth: T_{Kugel} = T_{x,y,z}(0,0,R+{hasl})*R_y(\\\\Pi/2-{lat})*R_z({long}) The first step pushes the origin of the model to the correct height above the earth's surface, then it is rotated by latitude and longitude. The order in which the matrices are applied is important, because the matrix multiplication is not commutative. This also applies to the three rotations, as can be demonstrated by an example: The point (1, 0, 0) lies on the X-axis, if one rotates it first by 90° around the X- and then around The Y axis, it ends up on the Z axis (the rotation around the X axis has no effect on a point that is on the axis). If, on the other hand, one rotates around the Y axis first and then around the X axis, the resulting point is located on the Y axis. The sequence itself is arbitrary as long as it is always the same. The sequence with x, then y, then z (roll, pitch, heading) is often the most intuitive, because the rotation causes the compass direction to coincide with the direction of the \\"nose\\". There are also two conventions to define these matrices, depending on whether you want to work with column vectors or row vectors. Different graphics libraries have different preferences here. OpenGL prefers column vectors, DirectX row vectors. The decision determines from which side the point vectors are to be multiplied by the transformation matrices. For column vectors, the multiplication is performed from the right, i.e. v_{out} = M * v_{in}, where vout and vin are 4x1 column vectors. The concatenation of the matrices also is done from the right to left, i.e., for example M = T_x * R_x, when first rotating and then shifting. In the case of row vectors, this works exactly the other way round. The multiplication now takes place from left as v_{out} = v_{in} * M with 1x4-row vectors and the concatenation is M = R_x * T_x when we also first rotate and then move. The matrices shown above are valid for the second case, while those for column vectors are transposed. The rule (v*M)^{T} = M^{T}*v^{T}K. Nipp, D. Stoffer; Lineare Algebra; v/d/f Hochschulverlag der ETH Zürich; Zürich 1998, . applies, which for multiplication with vectors means that you can switch the multiplication order by transposing the matrix. The interesting thing about this matrix chaining is that a new coordinate system is defined by each such transformation. This can be extended as desired. For example, the propeller of the aircraft may be a separate model, which is then placed by translation to the aircraft nose. This translation only needs to describe the shift from the model coordinate system to the propeller coordinate system. In order to draw the entire aircraft, the transformation matrix for the aircraft is first determined, the points are transformed, and then the propeller model matrix is multiplied to the matrix of the aircraft, and then the propeller points are transformed. The matrix calculated in this way is also called the world matrix. It must be determined for each object in the world before rendering. The application can introduce changes here, for example change the position of the aircraft according to the speed after each frame.  Camera Transformation  Left: Position and direction of the virtual viewer (camera), as defined by the user. Right: Positioning the objects after the camera transformation. The light gray area is the visible volume. In addition to the objects, the scene also defines a virtual camera or viewer that indicates the position and direction of view from which the scene is to be rendered. To simplify later projection and clipping, the scene is transformed so that the camera is at the origin, looking along the Z axis. The resulting coordinate system is called the camera coordinate system and the transformation is called camera transformation or View Transformation. : The view matrix is usually determined from camera position, target point (where the camera looks) and an \\"up vector\\" (\\"up\\" from the viewer's viewpoint). First three auxiliary vectors are required: : Zaxis = normal(cameraPosition - cameraTarget) : Xaxis = normal(cross(cameraUpVector, zaxis)) : Yaxis = cross(zaxis, xaxis) : With normal(v) = normalization of the vector v; : cross(v1, v2) = cross product of v1 and v2. :Finally, the matrix: \\\\begin{pmatrix} {xaxis}.x & {yaxis}.x & {zaxis}.x & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ {xaxis}.y & {yaxis}.y & {zaxis}.y & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ {xaxis}.z & {yaxis}.z & {zaxis}.z & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ -{dot}({xaxis}, {cameraPosition}) & -{dot}({yaxis},{cameraPosition}) & -{dot}({zaxis},{cameraPosition}) & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} : with dot(v1, v2) = dot product of v1 and v2.  Projection  The 3D projection step transforms the view volume into a cube with the corner point coordinates (-1, -1, 0) and (1, 1, 1); Occasionally other target volumes are also used. This step is called projection, even though it transforms a volume into another volume, since the resulting Z coordinates are not stored in the image, but are only used in Z-buffering in the later rastering step. In a perspective illustration, a central projection is used. To limit the number of displayed objects, two additional clipping planes are used; The visual volume is therefore a truncated pyramid (frustum). The parallel or orthogonal projection is used, for example, for technical representations because it has the advantage that all parallels in the object space are also parallel in the image space, and the surfaces and volumes are the same size regardless of the distance from the viewer. Maps use, for example, an orthogonal projection (so- called orthophoto), but oblique images of a landscape cannot be used in this way - although they can technically be rendered, they seem so distorted that we cannot make any use of them. The formula for calculating a perspective mapping matrix is: \\\\begin{pmatrix} w & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & h & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & {far}/({near-far}) & -1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & ({near}*{far}) / ({near}-{far}) & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} : With h = cot (fieldOfView / 2.0) (aperture angle of the camera); w = h / aspectRatio (aspect ratio of the target image); near = Smallest distance to be visible; far = The longest distance to be visible. The reasons why the smallest and the greatest distance have to be given here are, on the one hand, that this distance is divided by in order to reach the scaling of the scene (more distant objects are smaller in a perspective image than near objects), and on the other hand to scale the Z values to the range 0..1, for filling the Z-buffer. This buffer often has only a resolution of 16 bits, which is why the near and far values should be chosen carefully. A too large difference between the near and the far value leads to so-called Z-fighting because of the low resolution of the Z-buffer. It can also be seen from the formula that the near value cannot be 0, because this point is the focus point of the projection. There is no picture at this point. For the sake of completeness, the formula for parallel projection (orthogonal projection): \\\\begin{pmatrix} 2.0/w & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 2.0/h & 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1.0/({near- far}) & -1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & {near} / ({near}-{far}) & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} : with w = width of the target cube (dimension in units of the world coordinate system); H = w / aspectRatio (aspect ratio of the target image); near = Smallest distance to be visible; far = The longest distance to be visible. For reasons of efficiency, the camera and projection matrix are usually combined into a transformation matrix so that the camera coordinate system is omitted. The resulting matrix is usually the same for a single image, while the world matrix looks different for each object. In practice, therefore, view and projection are pre-calculated so that only the world matrix has to be adapted during the display. However, more complex transformations such as vertex blending are possible. Freely programmable geometry shaders that modify the geometry can also be executed. In the actual rendering step, the world matrix * camera matrix * projection matrix is calculated and then finally applied to every single point. Thus, the points of all objects are transferred directly to the screen coordinate system (at least almost, the value range of the axes are still -1..1 for the visible range, see section \\"Window-Viewport- Transformation\\").  Lighting  Often a scene contains light sources placed at different positions to make the lighting of the objects appear more realistic. In this case, a gain factor for the texture is calculated for each vertex based on the light sources and the material properties associated with the corresponding triangle. In the later rasterization step, the vertex values of a triangle are interpolated over its surface. A general lighting (ambient light) is applied to all surfaces. It is the diffuse and thus direction- independent brightness of the scene. The sun is a directed light source, which can be assumed to be infinitely far away. The illumination effected by the sun on a surface is determined by forming the scalar product of the directional vector from the sun and the normal vector of the surface. If the value is negative, the surface is facing the sun.  Clipping  Clipping of primitives against the cube. The blue triangle is discarded while the orange triangle is clipped, creating two new vertices Frustum Only the primitives which are within the visual volume need to actually be rastered (drawn). This visual volume is defined as the inside of a frustum, a shape in the form of a pyramid with a cut off top. Primitives which are completely outside the visual volume are discarded; This is called frustum culling. Further culling methods such as backface culling, which reduce the number of primitives to be considered, can theoretically be executed in any step of the graphics pipeline. Primitives which are only partially inside the cube must be clipped against the cube. The advantage of the previous projection step is that the clipping always takes place against the same cube. Only the - possibly clipped - primitives, which are within the visual volume, are forwarded to the final step.  Window-Viewport transformation  Window-Viewport-Transformation In order to output the image to any target area (viewport) of the screen, another transformation, the Window-Viewport transformation, must be applied. This is a shift, followed by scaling. The resulting coordinates are the device coordinates of the output device. The viewport contains 6 values: height and width of the window in pixels, the upper left corner of the window in window coordinates (usually 0, 0) and the minimum and maximum values for Z (usually 0 and 1). : Formally: \\\\begin{pmatrix} x\\\\\\\\\\\\ y\\\\\\\\\\\\ z \\\\end{pmatrix}=\\\\begin{pmatrix} {vp}.X+(1.0+v.X)*{vp}.{width}/2.0\\\\\\\\\\\\ {vp}.Y+(1.0-v.Y)*{vp}.{height}/2.0\\\\\\\\\\\\ {vp}.{minz}+v.Z*({vp}.{maxz} - {vp}.{minz}) \\\\end{pmatrix} : With vp=Viewport; v=Point after projection On modern hardware, most of the geometry computation steps are performed in the vertex shader. This is, in principle, freely programmable, but generally performs at least the transformation of the points and the illumination calculation. For the DirectX programming interface, the use of a custom vertex shader is necessary from version 10, while older versions still have a standard shader. === Rasterisation === The rasterisation step is the final step before the fragment shader pipeline that all primitives are rasterized with. In the rasterisation step, discrete fragments are created from continuous primitives. In this stage of the graphics pipeline, the grid points are also called fragments, for the sake of greater distinctiveness. Each fragment corresponds to one pixel in the frame buffer and this corresponds to one pixel of the screen. These can be colored (and possibly illuminated). Furthermore, it is necessary to determine the visible, closer to the observer fragment, in the case of overlapping polygons. A Z-buffer is usually used for this so-called hidden surface determination. The color of a fragment depends on the illumination, texture, and other material properties of the visible primitive and is often interpolated using the triangle vertice properties. Where available, a fragment shader (also called Pixel Shader) is run in the rastering step for each fragment of the object. If a fragment is visible, it can now be mixed with already existing color values in the image if transparency or multi-sampling is used. In this step, one or more fragments become a pixel. To prevent that the user sees the gradual rasterisation of the primitives, double buffering takes place. The rasterisation is carried out in a special memory area. Once the image has been completely rasterised, it is copied to the visible area of the image memory. === Inverse === All matrices used are nonsingular and thus invertible. Since the multiplication of two nonsingular matrices creates another nonsingular matrix, the entire transformation matrix is also invertible. The inverse is required to recalculate world coordinates from screen coordinates - for example, to determine from the mouse pointer position the clicked object. However, since the screen and the mouse have only two dimensions, the third is unknown. Therefore, a ray is projected at the cursor position into the world and then the intersection of this ray with the polygons in the world is determined. == Shader == Programmable 3D-Pipeline. Classic graphics cards are still relatively close to the graphics pipeline. With increasing demands on the GPU, restrictions were gradually removed out to create more flexibility. Modern graphics cards use a freely programmable, shader-controlled pipeline, which allows direct access to individual processing steps. To relieve the main processor, additional processing steps have been moved to the pipeline and the GPU. The most important shader units are pixel shaders, vertex shaders, and geometry shaders. The Unified Shader has been introduced to take full advantage of all units. This gives you a single large pool of shader units. As required, the pool is divided into different groups of shaders. A strict separation between the shader types is therefore no longer useful. It is also possible to use a so-called compute-shader to perform any calculations off the display of a graphic on the GPU. The advantage is that they run very parallel, but there are limitations. These universal calculations are also called general-purpose computing on graphics processing units, or GPGPU for short. == See also == * Pipeline (computing) ** Instruction pipelining * Hardware acceleration == Sources == * Tomas Akenine-Möller, Eric Haines: Real-Time Rendering.

In summer of 2002, the Kapitan Dranitsyn took part in shooting an advertising film for the Ford Motor Company in the Spitsbergen Archipelago. === 2017 overwintering in Pevek === In January 2017, Kapitan Dranitsyn and Admiral Makarov escorted two ice-strengthened cargo ships carrying construction material for berth of the floating nuclear power plant Akademik Lomonosov from Arkhangelsk to Pevek. The mid-winter crossing along the Northern Sea Route was reportedly the first since the Soviet times at this time of the year. However, on the return voyage the convoy encountered a heavy ice barrier at the entrance to Chaunskaya Bay. While the two icebreakers could have overcome the wide ice field on their own, it would have not been safe for the ice class Arc5 cargo ships Sinegorsk and Iohann Mahmastal that were in ballast. Consequently, it was decided that the cargo ships should overwinter in Pevek. In addition, Kapitan Dranitsyn remained in Chaunskaya Bay to ensure their safety. The icebound ships were later connected to shore power and the regional government supplied them with fresh water and provisions. The three vessels were finally able to leave Pevek in May 2017. === MOSAiC Expedition === During the 2019–2020 MOSAiC Expedition, Kapitan Dranitsyn carried out resupply voyages to the ice-locked German polar research vessel Polarstern. On 3 February 2020, Kapitan Dranitsyn set off for the second resupply voyage to Polarstern that was, at the time, drifting close to the North Pole. While the diesel-electric icebreaker eventually reached the German research vessel on 28 February and became the first icebreaker ever to operate at such high latitudes in mid-winter under her own power, she had expended most of her fuel reserves while tackling up to thick ice that had, in places, piled up to hummocks thick. As a result, Admiral Makarov was dispatched from Murmansk on a refueling mission. ==References== ==External links== * Page devoted to the Kapitan Dranitsyn from VICTORY adventure EXPEDITIONS. * Page devoted to my Kapitan Dranitsyn trip to Antarctica in 2001 \\"Quark Expedition in the Kapitan Dranitsyn.\\" Category:Icebreakers of Russia Category:Research vessels of Russia Category:Icebreakers of the Soviet Union Category:Arctic research Category:1975 ships Category:Murmansk Shipping Company Category:Research vessels of the Soviet Union ","title":"Kapitan Dranitsyn"},{"id":"1441961","text":"Karakul sheep in Akron Zoo Karakul or Qaraqul (named after Qorako‘l, a city in Bukhara Province in Uzbekistan) is a breed of domestic sheep which originated in Central Asia. Some archaeological evidence points to Karakul sheep being raised there continuously since 1400 BC. Hailing from the desert regions of Central Asia, Karakul sheep are renowned for their ability to forage and thrive under extremely harsh living conditions. They can survive severe drought conditions because of a special quality they have, storing fat in their tails. Karakul are also raised in large numbers in Namibia, having first been brought there by German colonists in the early 20th century. They are currently listed as endangered. ==Use by humans== Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Founder of Pakistan, wearing a Karakul hat U.S. Department of Agriculture was conducting breeding experiments in 1936. A government breeding expert, is shown with one of the prize rams imported from Bokhara, Central Asia Karakul sheep are a multi-purpose breed, kept for milking, meat, pelts, and wool. As a fat-tailed breed, they have a distinctive meat. Many adult Karakul are double- coated; in this case, spinners separate the coarse guard hair from the undercoat. Karakul is a relatively coarse fiber used for outer garments, carpets and for felting. ===Karakul pelts=== Washing of slaughtered lambs in Namibia Very young or even fetal Karakul lambs are prized for pelts. Newborn karakul sheep pelts are called karakul (also spelled caracul), swakara (coined from South West Africa Karakul), astrakhan (Russian and French), Persian lamb, agnello di Persia, (Italian), krimmer (Russian) and garaköli bagana (Turkmen). Sometimes the terms for newborn lambs' and fetal lambs' pelts are used interchangeably. The newborn lambs have a tight, curly pattern of hair. The lambs must be under three days old when they are killed, or they will lose their black color and soft, tightly wound coils of fur. Dark colors are dominant and lambs often darken in color as they age. Fetal karakul lamb pelts are called broadtail, Breitschwanz (German), and karakulcha. Fetal karakul lambs are harvested through miscarriages, induced early delivery or by killing the mother sheep and removing the fetus. Rather than killing healthy female sheep, farmers will kill older sheep that have already given birth many times. People use the lamb pelts to create various clothing items, such as the Astrakhan or karakul hat. The pelts have also been used in haute couture. An Astrakhan collar has been used on women's suits and on expensive overcoats. King George V had a beaver-lined overcoat with an astrakhan collar that was later worn by his son, the Duke of Windsor. The astrakhan collar has appeared in more recent men's fashions, and astrakhan has been featured more extensively in the form of a Formula One-style driving suit made primarily of astrakhan. ==See also== *Karakul (hat) *Montera Spanish bullfighter's hat ==ReferencesAmerican Karakul Sheep Registry Category:Sheep breeds Category:Sheep breeds originating in Uzbekistan Category:Animal breeds on the GEH Red List ","title":"Karakul sheep"},{"id":"1441970","text":"USS Ford may refer to: * , named for John D.

Human Rights Watch has accused the Ethiopian government of stifling political dissent and criticism in Oromia, Ethiopia's most populous region. The government has denied these allegations, and cited the occurrence of an opposition rally attended by 250,000 people on May 8 as an example of political freedom in the country. Provisional results were scheduled to be announced on May 21, and official results June 8; however, due to hundreds of claims of election irregularities from all political parties involved, the provisional results were delayed until June 8 to allow the complaints to be fully investigated. On August 9, official results were released, acknowledging that the ruling EPRDF had won 296 of the total 524 seats - about 56 percent - enabling it to form a government. However, Berhanu Nega, vice-chairman of the Coalition for Unity and Democracy, had criticized the process, claiming that \\"The investigation process was a complete failure.

Additionally, general elections in the Somali Region were held on August 21. On September 5, the National Election Board of Ethiopia released its final results, in which the EPRDF retained its control of the government with 327 seats and opposition parties won 174 seats.http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=48905&SelectRegion;=Horn_of_Africa&SelectCountry;=ETHIOPIA ==2010 General election== A parliamentary election took place on 23 May 2010. , preliminary election results indicated that the ruling EPRDF party had won 499 of the 536 seats in parliament. The provisional results indicated the EPRDF had won a landslide victory in 9 of the 11 regions and cities. 90% of eligible voters participated the election. Chief European Union (EU) observer Thijs Berman reported that the elections were \\"peaceful and well organised\\", but noted an \\"uneven playing field\\" and criticized the use of state resources in the EPRDF campaign. The EU received numerous reports of intimidation and harassment, but indicated that this did not necessarily affect the outcome of the elections. The eight-party Medrek coalition won only a single seat in the capital Addis Ababa. Medrek had expected better results in the Oromia Region. Medrek leader Merera Gudina rejected the election results as being \\"completely fraudulent\\" and indicated that the coalition is considering what action to take. Human Rights Watch had condemned the election as \\"multi-party theatre staged by a single party state\\". Election and government officials have denied such charges. Opposition leaders have claimed that their supporters have been subject to harassment and beatings. In March 2010, an opposition politician was stabbed to death, but the government blamed the killing on a personal dispute. A Wall Street Journal article suggests that Medrek had spent much of its energy on coalition-building. International reporters have given the election wide media coverage. African Union (AU) election observers reported that the election was completely \\"free and fair\\" and met all AU election standards. In spite of the opposition's objections, the AU stated that the election \\"reflected voters' will.\\" The AU observers also reported that opposition party observers were present in most of the polling stations that the AU observed, and found no evidence to support the opposition's charges of pre-election intimidation. At the same time, chief AU observer and former President of Botswana Ketumile Masire noted that \\"the AU were unable to observe the pre-election period. The participating parties expressed dissatisfaction with the pre-election period. They did not have freedom to campaign. We had no way of verifying the allegations.\\" Masire said that the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) handled the election in a professional manner and did not interfere with the electoral materials. Prime Minister Meles Zenawi attributed the election results to the EPRDF's past performance, in particular citing the country's economic growth. According to the International Monetary Fund, Ethiopia's economy grew 9.9% in 2009 and was expected to grow 7% in 2010. Some analysts suggest that the result is a combination of the EPRDF's performance along with state-sponsored intimidation of the opposition. On 21 June 2010, the NEBE released the final election results, which confirmed the preliminary results from the previous month. The EPRDF won 499 of the 547 available parliamentary seats, opposition or independent candidates won two seats, and EPRDF-allied parties won the remaining seats. Additionally, the EPRDF won all but one of 1,904 council seats in regional elections. The opposition had filed appeals with the election board and the Ethiopian Supreme Court, but both appeals were rejected. On July 20, the Court of Cassation, Ethiopia's highest court, rejected the opposition's final appeal. ==2015 general election== Parliamentary elections were held in Ethiopia on 24 May 2015.

Voters must be at least 18 years old and Guinean citizens in full possession of civil and political rights. Candidates must be at 18, either Guinean by citizenship or naturalized and resident in the country for at least 10 years. There are also various disqualifications. ==History== When Guinea gained its independence from France in 1958, Ahmed Sékou Touré became its first president, as his Parti démocratique de Guinée (DPG, Democratic Party of Guinea) had won 56 of 60 seats in the 1957 Territorial Assembly election. By 1960, he had declared the DPG the only legal party, so, for the next 24 years, all the voters could do was elect the DPG candidates to the National Assembly, while Touré ran unopposed for the presidency three more times. After Touré's death in 1984, Colonels Lansana Conté and Diarra Traoré seized power in a bloodless coup d'état, with Conté assuming the presidency. In December 1990, a new constitution created a unicameral Parliament. In April 1992, legislation was passed making Guinea a multi-party state. The following year, Conté announced a return to civilian rule, with Guinea's first multi- party presidential election taking place in 1993, followed by a legislative election in 1995. Conté remained president, with 51.7% of the vote, while his Party of Unity and Progress (PUP, Parti de l'Unité et du Progrès) won 71 of the 114 seats in the Assembly. He was re-elected president in 1998, with 56.1% of the vote, and 2003, with 95.6% of the vote after all the major opposition leaders boycotted the election. His party also won 85 seats in the Assembly in 2002, with some opposition parties choosing to boycott. Shortly after Conté's death in December 2008, Moussa Dadis Camara seized power. In December 2009, Camara was shot in the head in an assassination attempt and left the country to obtain medical care. The following month, Camara agreed to a return to civilian rule. No candidate won a majority of the votes in the first round of the 2010 presidential election, so Cellou Dalein Diallo and Alpha Condé, the top vote-getters (with 43.69% and 18.25%, respectively), contested a second round, which was delayed several times. Condé finally emerged victorious, with 52.54% of the ballots. His Guinean People's Assembly party (RPG, Rassemblement du Peuple Guinéen) took 53 of the 114 Assembly seats in the repeatedly delayed 2013 election, and seven seats won by allies gave the RPG a majority. He himself was re-elected in 2015. ==Latest elections== === 2015 presidential election === Alpha Condé is re-elected. { class= style=text- align:right !Candidate !Party !Votes !% - align=leftAlpha Condéalign=leftRally of the Guinean People2,285,82757.85 - align=leftCellou Dalein Dialloalign=leftUnion of Democratic Forces of Guinea1,242,36231.44 - align=leftSidya Touréalign=leftUnion of Republican Forces237,5496.01 - align=leftFaya Lansana Millimounoalign=leftLiberal Bloc54,7181.38 - align=leftEl Hadj Papa Koly Kouroumaalign=leftGenerations for Reconciliation, Union, and Prosperity51,7501.31 - align=leftLansana Kouyatéalign=leftNational Party for Hope and Development45,9621.16 - align=leftGhandi Faraguet Tounkaraalign=leftGuinean Union for Democracy and Development19,8400.50 - align=leftMarie Madeilein Dioubatéalign=leftGuinea Ecologists Party13,2140.33 - align=left colspan=2Invalid/blank votes179,804– - align=left colspan=2Total4,131,026100 - align=left colspan=2Registered voters/turnout6,042,63468.36 - colspan=4 align=leftSource: CENI (98.2% of polling stations reporting) } ===2020 legislative election=== The elections were boycotted by the main opposition parties.

The National Assembly is directly elected, with the nominee of the party or alliance that receives the most votes becoming President.Executive Library of Congress Country Studies ==Electoral history== Elections were first held in what would become Guyana in the 18th century, at a time when the colonies of Berbice, Demerara and Essequibo were under Dutch control. A Court of Policy was established in 1732,Historical information events and dates on the Parliament of Guyana from 1718 to 2006 Parliament of Guyana which initially consisted of the Governor, five appointed officials (including the Fiscal Officer and the Vendor Master) and five colonists chosen by the Governor from a list of nominees submitted by the College of Kiezers, an electoral college consisting of Dutch planters.The arrival of Laurens Storm van Gravesande Guyana.org Sitting together, the Court of Policy and the College of Kiezers formed the Combined Court. After the British took control of Guiana in 1803, the College of Kiezers was abolished, and its duties were given to the Financial Representatives,The Beginning of British Guiana Guyana.org who were elected by the public in six constituencies, although with a severely limited franchise. The Court of Policy and Financial Representatives continued to form the Combined Court. The College of Kiezers was re-established in the 1830s,Early British administrative reforms Guyana.org with its members elected for life by planters. When a vacancy arose in the Court of Policy, the College would nominate two candidates, who the remaining members of the Court of Policy would hold a vote on.Central Government Guyana.org Constitutional reforms in 1891 led to the abolition of the College of Kiezers for a second time and the introduction of direct elections to the Court of Policy, with eight members elected from seven constituencies, in addition to the continued direct election of the six Financial Representatives, giving equal numbers of appointed and elected members in the Combined Court. Elections were held under this system in 1892, 1897, 1901, 1906, 1911, 1916, 1921 and 1926. However, the franchise remained severely limited, with only 11,103 people registered to vote from a population of 317,026 (3.5%) by the time of the 1926 elections;James G Rose (1992) British colonial policy and the transfer of power in British Guiana, 1945–1964 King's College London the figure had been just 1.1% for the 1921 elections.Silvius Elgerton Wilson (1997) The 1924 workers' incident at Riumveldt British Guiana and the development of Working People's Organisation University of Warwick, p183 The implementation of a new constitution in 1928 led to the abolition of the existing bodies and the establishment of the 30-seat Legislative Council. The new Council had 14 elected members, elected in single-member constituencies under a limited franchise, but they were now outnumbered by 16 appointees, as the authorities were concerned by the rise of the Popular Party, which had won a majority of the elected seats in 1926. Elections were held under the new system in 1930 and 1935, but World War II caused the next elections to be delayed until 1947, with reforms passed in 1943 reducing the number of appointed members to nine, giving the elected members a majority on the Council. A reduction in the income requirements to voters increased the electorate from 9,514 in 1935 to 59,193.The 1947 parliamentary elections in colonial British Guiana Stabroek News, 6 May 2010 As a result of the Waddington Commission, further constitutional reforms led to the creation of the House of Assembly to replace the Legislative Council. The new House had 28 members; 24 members elected in single member constituencies, a speaker appointed by the Governor and three ex officio members. Elections were held under the new system in 1953, and were convincingly won by the People's Progressive Party, which took 18 of the 24 seats. However, after assuming power, PPP leader Cheddi Jagan embarked on a series of policies that involved radical social reform, mainly directed at the colonial oligarchy. The British colonial authorities sent in troops in response to the alleged threat of a Marxist revolution and Governor Alfred Savage suspended the constitution in October (only 133 days after it had come into force) and set up a transitional government of conservative politicians, businessmen and civil servants.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, p354 The transitional government lasted until elections in 1957 to a reconstituted Legislative Council with 14 elected members. The PPP won all but two seats, although it had split into two factions, one led by Jagan and the other by Forbes Burnham. Another round of constitutional reform in 1961 led to the creation of the Legislature, consisting of an elected 36-member Legislative Assembly (35 members elected in single-member constituencies, who in turn elected a Speaker) and an appointed 13-member Senate. These elections were again won by the PPP, who took 20 of the 35 directly-elected seats. However, the PPP had only received 1.6% more of the vote than the new People's National Congress (PNC), but had won almost double the number of seats. This resulted in mass demonstrations led by the PNC, a general strike and severe inter-racial violence. After a few weeks the British authorities intervened by sending in troops and the Governor declared a state of emergency.Nohlen, p355 Following these events, further constitutional reforms were enacted to create a unicameral 54-member House of Assembly elected by proportional representation (53 members elected in a single nationwide constituency and a Speaker elected by MPs). The first elections held under the new system took place in 1964, and although the PPP again emerged as the largest party, the PNC was able to form a coalition government with the United Force, which together held 29 seats. Despite losing the elections Jagan refused to resign as Prime Minister, and had to be removed by Governor Richard Luyt, with Burnham replacing him. After independence in 1966, the House of Assembly was renamed the National Assembly. The electoral system remained unchanged, but the elections were rigged by the PNC, which had transferred responsibility for holding elections from the Electoral Commission to a government department.Nohlen, pp. 355–359 Unfair elections were held in 1968 and 1973. A new constitution promulgated in 1980 led to the creation of an executive president; the leader of the party that received the most votes in an election would automatically assume the post.Nohlen, p356 Two further fraudulent elections were held in 1980 and 1985, with the PNC winning an increasing number of seats on each occasion. Due to demands from Western countries and international organisations, democratic reforms were introduced in the late 1990s, and after several postponements, free and fair elections were held in 1992.Nohlen, p357 The result was a victory for the PPP, with Jagan returning to power after a 28-year hiatus. The PPP went on to win the next elections in 1997. In 2001 the electoral system was modified; the single 53-member nationwide constituency was replaced by a 40-member nationwide constituency and 10 multi-member constituencies based on the country's regions, which together elected a further 25 members. Elections later that year saw another PPP victory, which the party repeated in 2006 The 2011 elections saw the PPP won the largest number of seats (32), but fail to achieve a majority; however, although opposition parties held a majority of seats, the rule that the head of the largest party becomes President allowed new PPP leader Donald Ramotar to assume the position.Guyana: Minority government’s difficult choices Global, April 2012PPP suffers setback in Guyana elections Council on Hemispheric Affairs, 10 June 2015 Prior to the 2015 elections all parliamentary opposition parties (the Alliance for Change and the four-member APNU, which included the PNC) formed a single electoral list.

As of 2020, he is the oldest living chess grandmaster. He was born in Kaluga, Russia. He was chairman of the USSR Chess Federation from 1973 to 1978. ==Life and career== His father was German Jewish,Yuri Averbakh turns 85, Chessbase, 8-2-2007 and his ancestors came from Germany and were named Auerbach, meaning \\"meadow brook\\". His mother was Russian. Both sets of grandparents disapproved of their marriage because his father was likely an atheist and his mother was Eastern Orthodox, as well as the fact that his maternal grandmother died very young so his mother was expected to look after the family. Averbakh himself calls himself a fatalist. ===Tournament successes=== His first major success was first place in the Moscow Championship of 1949, ahead of players including Andor Lilienthal, Yakov Estrin and Vladimir Simagin. He became an International Grandmaster in 1952. In 1954 he won the USSR Chess Championship ahead of players including Mark Taimanov, Viktor Korchnoi, Tigran Petrosian, Efim Geller and Salo Flohr. In the 1956 Championship he came equal first with Taimanov and Boris Spassky in the main event, finishing second after the playoff. Later Averbakh's daughter, Jane, would marry Taimanov. Averbakh's other major tournament victories included Vienna 1961 and Moscow 1962. He qualified for the 1953 Candidates' Tournament (the last stage to determine the challenger to the World Chess Champion), finishing joint tenth of the fifteen participants. He also qualified for the 1958 Interzonal at Portorož, by finishing in fourth place at the 1958 USSR Championship at Riga. At Portorož, he wound up in a tie for seventh through eleventh places, half a point short of advancing to the Candidates' Tournament. He played in the 1993 Maccabiah Games in Israel, coming in fourth. ===Playing style=== His solid style was difficult for many pure attackers to overcome, as he wrote: :\\"...Nezhmetdinov, who if he had the attack, could kill anybody, including Tal. But my score against him was something like 8½–½ because I did not give him any possibility for an active game. In such cases he would immediately start to spoil his position because he was looking for complications.\\" He has plus records against the World champions Max Euwe and Tigran Petrosian. ===Writings=== Averbakh is also a major endgame study theorist. He has published more than 100 studies, many of which have made notable contributions to endgame theory. In 1956 he was given by FIDE the title of International Judge of Chess Compositions and in 1969 he became an International Arbiter. Averbakh is also an important chess journalist and author. He edited the Soviet chess periodicals Shakhmaty v SSSR and Shakhmatny Bulletin. From 1956 to 1962 he edited (with Vitaly Chekhover and others) a four-volume anthology on the endgame, Shakhmatnye okonchaniya (revised in 1980-84 and translated as Comprehensive Chess Endings, five volumes). ===Openings contributions=== Averbakh is the eponym of several opening variations. *King's Indian Defence: Averbakh Variation (E73): 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Be2 0-0 6.Bg5 *King's Indian Defence: Semi- Averbakh system (E73): 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Be2 0-0 6.Be3 *Modern Defense: Averbakh variation (A42): 1.d4 g6 2.c4 Bg7 3.Nc3 d6 4.e4 ==Honours and awards== * Honored Master of Sports of the USSR *Order of Friendship of Peoples (1981) *Medal \\"For Labour Valour\\" (1957) *Medal \\"For Distinguished Labour\\" (1970) *Jubilee Medal \\"In Commemoration of the 100th Anniversary since the Birth of Vladimir Il'ich Lenin\\" (1970) * Russian Imperial Family: Knight Commander of the Imperial Order of Saint Stanislaushttp://www.imperialhouse.ru/en/allnews-en/news/the-head-of-the- russian-imperial-house-and-her-heir-visit-moscow-april-23-29-2017.html ==Books== * Chess Endings: Essential Knowledge, by Yuri Averbakh, 1966, 1993, Everyman Chess, . *Comprehensive Chess Endings 1: Bishop Endings, Knight Endings by Averbakh and Chekhover, 1983, Pergamon, *Comprehensive Chess Endings 2: Bishop vs Knight Endings, Rook vs Minor Piece Endings by Averbakh, 1985, Pergamon, *Comprehensive Chess Endings 3: Queen Endings by Averbakh, 1986, Pergamon, *Comprehensive Chess Endings 4: Pawn Endings by Averbakh and Maizelis, 1987, Pergamon, *Comprehensive Chess Endings 5: Rook Endings by Averbakh, 1987, Pergamon, *Chess Tactics for Advanced Players, by Averbakh, 1985, Pergamon, *Chess Tactics for Advanced Players, by Averbakh, 2008, Lebate, * A History of Chess from Chaturanga to the Present Day, 2012, Russell Enterprises, *Journey to the Chess Kingdom, with Mark Beilin, 2014, Chess Evolution, *Centre-Stage and Behind the Scenes: A Personal Memoir *Chess Middlegames: Essential Knowledge *Averbakh's Selected Games *Rook v Minor Piece Endings *The World Chess Championship, with Mark Taimanov *Small Chess Dictionary ==Notes== ==References== * *Averbakh's Selected Games by Averbakh, 1998, Everyman Chess, *Interview in The Day Kasparov Quit by Dirk Jan ten Geuzendam ==External links== * *Interview Part 1 *Interview Part 2 Category:1922 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kaluga Category:Chess grandmasters Category:Chess theoreticians Category:Chess historians Category:Russian chess players Category:Soviet chess players Category:Soviet chess writers Category:Soviet male writers Category:20th- century Russian male writers Category:International Judges of Chess Compositions Category:Chess composers Category:Russian chess writers Category:Chess arbiters Category:Russian people of German-Jewish descent Category:Recipients of the Order of Friendship of Peoples Category:Honoured Masters of Sport of the USSR Category:Jewish chess players Category:Competitors at the 1993 Maccabiah Games Category:Maccabiah Games chess players Category:Maccabiah Games competitors for Russia Category:Recipients of the Order of Saint Stanislaus Category:Recipients of the Order of Saint Stanislaus, 2nd class ","title":"Yuri Averbakh"},{"id":"1442031","text":"The Siege of Przemyśl was the longest siege of the First World War,A War in Words, p.69, Svetlana Palmer & Sarah Wallis, Simon & Schuster 2003 and a crushing defeat for Austria-Hungary against Russian attackers. Przemyśl (German: Premissel) was a fortress town on the River San and a Galician stronghold. The investment of Przemyśl began on 16 September 1914, and was briefly suspended on 11 October, due to an Austro-Hungarian offensive. The siege resumed again on 9 November, and the Austro-Hungarian garrison surrendered on 22 March 1915, after holding out for a total of 133 days. == Background == In August 1914, Russian armies moved against both German East Prussia and Austria-Hungary's largest province of Eastern Galicia, straddling the present-day Poland/Ukraine border. Its advance into Germany was soon repulsed but its Galician campaign was more successful. General Nikolai Ivanov overwhelmed the Austro-Hungarian forces under Conrad von Hötzendorf during the Battle of Galicia, and the whole Austrian front fell back over to the Carpathian Mountains. The fortress at Przemyśl was the only Austrian post that held out and by 28 September, was completely behind Russian lines. The Russians were now in a position to threaten the German industrial region of Silesia, making the defense of Przemyśl of importance to the Germans as well as the Austro-Hungarians. of new trenches were dug and of barbed wire were used to make seven new lines of defence around the perimeter of the town. Inside the fortress a military garrison of 127,000, as well as 18,000 civilians, were surrounded by six Russian divisions. Przemyśl reflected the nature of the Austro-Hungarian Empire - orders of the day had to be issued in fifteen languages. Austrians, Poles, Jews and Ukrainians were together in the besieged town, that was hit constantly with artillery fire, and as the toll of dead and sick and wounded rose, and starvation threatened, so did mutual distrust and racial tension.A War in Words, p.70, Svetlana Palmer & Sarah Wallis, Simon & Schuster 2003 == First siege == Map of Przemysl and surrounding forts On 24 September, General Radko Dimitriev, commander of the Russian Third Army began the siege of the fortress. Dimitriev was without sufficient siege artillery when he began the investment and instead of waiting for the Russian high command to send him the artillery pieces, Dimitriev ordered a full-scale assault on the fortress before an Austrian relief force could be sent. For three days the Russians attacked and accomplished nothing at the cost of 40,000 casualties. While this was under way General Paul von Hindenburg launched an offensive against Warsaw in the north. In conjunction with the German attack on Warsaw, General Svetozar Boroevic von Bojna led a relief force towards Przemyśl. On 11 October, Dimitriev lifted the siege and withdrew across the San River. Conrad von Hötzendorf had hopes that a combined assault from Boroevic's army and the Przemyśl garrison would inflict a severe blow on the Russians. A month and a half on from the time when the Russians encircled the town, German troops helped the Habsburg troops to break the encirclement. Civilians were ordered to leave at once – in part to relieve the severe food shortage. == Second siege == By 31 October, Hindenburg had been defeated at the Battle of the Vistula River and withdrew from his assault on Warsaw. This caused Boroevic to pull back from the River San line, and abandon von Hötzendorf's proposed offensive against Russia. On November 9 the Russians resumed the siege of Przemyśl. Radko Dimitriev's force was withdrawn from the Przemyśl sector and moved north. The Russian Eleventh Army under General Andrei Nikolaevich Selivanov took up the siege operations. Selivanov did not order any frontal assaults as Dimitriev had, and instead settled to starve the garrison into submission. By mid-December, the Russians were pounding the fortress with ceaseless artillery fire seeking to compel the town's surrender. During the winter 1914–1915 the Habsburg armies continued to fight their way to the fortress. Months of fighting resulted in great losses, largely from frostbite and disease, but relieving forces failed to reach the garrison at Przemysl. In February 1915, Boroevic led another relief effort towards Przemyśl. By the end of February, all relief efforts having been defeated von Hötzendorf informed Hermann Kusmanek von Burgneustädten that no further efforts would be made. Selivanov was given sufficient artillery to reduce the fortress. The Russians overran the northern defenses on 13 March. An improvised line of defense held up the Russian attacks long enough for Kusmanek to destroy anything left in the city that could be of use to the Russians once captured. On March 19 Kusmanek ordered an attempt to break out but his sallies were repulsed and he was forced to retreat back into the city. With nothing useful left within the city, Kusmanek had no choice but to surrender. On 22 March, the remaining garrison of 117,000 surrendered to the Russians.Rothenburg, G. The Army of Francis Joseph. West Lafayette: Purdue University Press, 1976. p 185. Among the captured were nine generals, ninety- three senior staff officers, and 2500 other officers. == Life in Przemyśl under siege == Diaries and notebooks kept by various people in the town have survived. The diary of Josef Tomann, an Austrian recruited into military service as a junior doctor, reveals the results of the activities of garrison officers: \\"The hospitals have been recruiting teenage girls as nurses. They get 120 crowns a month and free meals. They are, with very few exceptions, utterly useless. Their main job is to satisfy the lust of the gentlemen officers and, rather shamefully, of a number of doctors, too [-] New officers are coming in almost daily with cases of syphilis, gonorrhea and soft chancre. The poor girls and women feel so flattered when they get chatted up by one of these pestilent pigs in their spotless uniforms, with their shiny boots and buttons.\\" Other accounts reveal the pervasive presence of starvation and disease, including cholera, and the diary of Helena Jablonska, a middle-aged, quite wealthy Polish woman, reveals class and anti-semitic and racial tensions in the town; \\" The Jewish women in basements rip you off the worst\\", and on March 18, 1915 – \\"The Jews are taking their shop signs down in a hurry, so that no one can tell who owns what. [-] They've all got so rich off the backs of those poor soldiers, and now of course they all want to run away!\\" Once the Russians arrived in March the fate of the Jews worsened and she noted: \\"The Cossacks waited until the Jews set off to the synagogue for their prayers before setting upon them with whips. There is such lamenting and despair. Some Jews are hiding in cellars, but they'll get to them there too.\\"A War in Words, p87-88 ==Mail communications== Airmail flights from Przemyśl during both sieges when airmail postcards, mostly military mail, were flown from the besieged city on twenty-seven flights. Following a forced landing, mail from one flight was confiscated by the Russians and sent to Saint Petersburg for postal censorship and onward transmission. Balloon mail, on some manned but mainly unmanned paper balloons, was also carried out of the city. Pigeon mail was also used to send messages out of the city. Statue commemorating the siege of Przemyśl in Budapest, Hungary == Results == The fall of Przemyśl led many to believe that Russia would now launch a major offensive into Hungary. This anticipated offensive never came, but the loss of Przemyśl was a serious blow to Austro-Hungarian morale. A further blow to Austria-Hungary was the fact that Przemyśl was only supposed to be garrisoned by 50,000, yet over 110,000 Austro-Hungarians surrendered with the fortress, a much more significant loss. The Russians held Przemyśl until the summer of 1915 when the Gorlice-Tarnow Offensive pushed back the Russian front in Galicia. Przemysl stayed in Austro- Hungarian hands until October 1918, at which point Eastern Galicia left the Austro-Hungarian Empire and became part of the newly created independent state of Poland. The Austro-Hungarian army never recovered from its losses in the winter of 1914–1915 and the Habsburgs would rely henceforth on German assistance both in their sector of the Eastern Front and in the Balkans.A War in Words, p.93 Meanwhile Austro-Hungarian attempts to relieve the fortress ended catastrophically as the poorly supplied and outnumbered imperial forces attempted offensive after offensive through the Carpathian Mountains. Casualties for January to April 1915, in the Carpathians, were officially reported as 800,000, mostly due to weather and disease rather than combat. Russian casualties were nearly as high, but easier to replace, and balanced out more by the surrender of 117,000 Austro-Hungarian troops at the end of the siege.Tucker, Spencer. \\"World War I: A Student Encyclopedia\\". ABC-CLIO Publishing. 2005. Page 349. All told, the siege and the attempts to relieve it cost the Austro-Hungarian army over a million casualties and inflicted on it significant damage from which it would never recover. == Notes == == References == * * ==Further reading== * Written in Blood: The Battles for Fortress Przemysl in WWI by Graydon A.

Pixar uses RenderMan to render their in-house 3D animated movie productions and it is also available as a commercial product licensed to third parties. In 2015, a free non-commercial version of RenderMan became available. ==Name== To speed up rendering, Pixar engineers did experiments with parallel rendering computers using Transputer chips called Pixar Image Computer. One engineer named Jeff Mock built a small version with a 2,5 × 5 inches/ 6,4 × 13 cm circuit board containing one Transputer that he could put in his pocket. During that time the Sony Walkman was very popular and Jeff Mock called his portable board Renderman. ==Technology== RenderMan defines cameras, geometry, materials, and lights using the RenderMan Interface Specification. This specification facilitates communication between 3D modeling and animation applications and the render engine that generates high quality images. Renderman uses the Reyes Rendering Architecture. The Renderman standard was first presented at 1993 SIGGRAPH, developed with input from 19 companies, with 6 or 7 big partners; with Pat Hanrahan taking a leading role. Ed Catmull said no software product met the Renderman Standard in 1993. Renderman met it after about two years. Additionally RenderMan supports Open Shading Language to define textural patterns. When Pixar started development, Steve Jobs described the original goal for RenderMan in 1991: Historically, RenderMan used the Reyes algorithm to render images with added support for advanced effects such as ray tracing and global illumination. Support for Reyes rendering and the RenderMan Shading Language were removed from RenderMan in 2016. RenderMan currently uses Monte Carlo path tracing to generate images. ==Awards== RenderMan has been used to create digital visual effects for Hollywood blockbuster movies such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Lion King, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Toy Story, Jurassic Park, Avatar, Titanic, the Star Wars prequels, and The Lord of the Rings. RenderMan has received two Academy Scientific and Technical Awards. Kite Jack The first was in 1993 honoring Pat Hanrahan, Anthony A. Apodaca, Loren Carpenter, Rob Cook, Ed Catmull, Darwyn Peachey, and Tom Porter. The second was as part of the 73rd Scientific and Technical Academy Awards ceremony presentation on March 3, 2001, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Board of Governors honored Ed Catmull, Loren Carpenter and Rob Cook with an Academy Award of Merit \\"for significant advancements to the field of motion picture rendering as exemplified in Pixar’s RenderMan\\".

It was developed in the mid-1980s by Loren Carpenter and Robert L. Cook at Lucasfilm's Computer Graphics Research Group, which is now Pixar.RenderMan@20: Ed Catmull and Dana Batali Reflect On Pixar's Killer App\\" It was first used in 1982 to render images for the Genesis effect sequence in the movie Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. Pixar's RenderMan is one implementation of the Reyes algorithm. According to the original paper describing the algorithm, the Reyes image rendering system is \\"An architecture for fast high-quality rendering of complex images.\\" Reyes was proposed as a collection of algorithms and data processing systems. However, the terms \\"algorithm\\" and \\"architecture\\" have come to be used synonymously and are used interchangeably in this article. == Name == Reyes is an acronym for Renders Everything You Ever Saw (the name is also a pun on Point Reyes, California, near where Lucasfilm was located) and is suggestive of processes connected with optical imaging systems. According to Robert L. Cook, Reyes is written with only the first letter capitalized, as it is in the 1987 Cook/Carpenter/Catmull SIGGRAPH paper. == Architecture == The architecture was designed with a number of goals in mind: *Model complexity/diversity: In order to generate visually complex and rich images, users of a rendering system need to be free to model large numbers (100,000s) of complex geometric structures possibly generated using procedural models such as fractals and particle systems. *Shading complexity: Much of the visual complexity in a scene is generated by the way in which light rays interact with solid object surfaces. Generally, in computer graphics, this is modelled using textures. Textures can be colored arrays of pixels, describe surface displacements or transparency or surface reflectivity. Reyes allows users to incorporate procedural shaders whereby surface structure and optical interaction is achieved using computer programs implementing procedural algorithms rather than simple look-up tables. A good portion of the algorithm is aimed at minimising the time spent by processors fetching textures from data stores. *Minimal ray tracing: At the time that Reyes was proposed, computer systems were significantly less capable in terms of processing power and storage. This meant that ray tracing a photo- realistic scene would take tens or hundreds of hours per frame. Algorithms such as Reyes which didn't generally ray trace run much faster with almost photo-realistic results. *Speed: Rendering a two-hour movie at 24 frames per second in one year allows 3 minutes rendering time per frame, on average. *Image quality: Any image containing unwanted, algorithm-related artifacts is considered unacceptable. *Flexibility: The architecture should be flexible enough to incorporate new techniques as they become available, without the need for a complete reimplementation of the algorithm. Reyes efficiently achieves several effects that were deemed necessary for film-quality rendering: Smooth, curved surfaces; surface texturing; motion blur; and depth of field. Reyes renders curved surfaces, such as those represented by parametric patches, by dividing them into micropolygons, small quadrilaterals each less than one pixel in size. Although many micropolygons are necessary to approximate curved surfaces accurately, they can be processed with simple, parallelizable operations. A Reyes renderer tessellates high-level primitives into micropolygons on demand, dividing each primitive only as finely as necessary to appear smooth in the final image. Next, a shader system assigns a color and opacity to each vertex of a micropolygon. Most Reyes renderers allow users to supply arbitrary lighting and texturing functions written in a shading language. Micropolygons are processed in large grids which allow computations to be vectorized. Shaded micropolygons are sampled in screen space to produce the output image. Reyes employs an innovative hidden-surface algorithm or hider which performs the necessary integrations for motion blur and depth of field without requiring more geometry or shading samples than an unblurred render would need. The hider accumulates micropolygon colors at each pixel across time and lens position using a Monte Carlo method called stochastic sampling. === Pipeline === The basic Reyes pipeline has the following steps: # Bound. Calculate the bounding volume of each geometric primitive. # Split. Split large primitives into smaller, diceable primitives. # Dice. Convert the primitive into a grid of micropolygons, each approximately the size of a pixel. # Shade. Calculate lighting and shading at each vertex of the micropolygon grid. # Bust the grid into individual micropolygons, each of which is bounded and checked for visibility. # Hide. Sample the micropolygons, producing the final 2D image. In this design, the renderer must store the entire frame buffer in memory since the final image cannot be output until all primitives have been processed. A common memory optimization introduces a step called bucketing prior to the dicing step. The output image is divided into a coarse grid of \\"buckets,\\" each typically 16 by 16 pixels in size. The objects are then split roughly along the bucket boundaries and placed into buckets based on their location. Each bucket is diced and drawn individually, and the data from the previous bucket is discarded before the next bucket is processed. In this way only a frame buffer for the current bucket and the high-level descriptions of all geometric primitives must be maintained in memory. For typical scenes, this leads to a significant reduction in memory usage compared to the unmodified Reyes algorithm. == Reyes renderers == The following renderers use the Reyes algorithm in one way or the other or at least allow users to select it to produce their images: *Digits 'n Art's 3Delight (link) *Aqsis (link) open source *jrMan (link) open source *Pixar's RenderMan Pro Server & RenderMan for Maya (link) up to version 20 (released in 2015) *Pixels 3d Renderer (link) *Pixie (link) open source *DotC Software's RenderDotC (link) *Side Effects Software's Mantra (link) *Poser's FireFly (link) *Bakery Relight (link) == References == * Robert L.

He is a controversial political figure in Portugal. ==Early years== Jardim was born on Madeira Island in 1943, son of Alberto Gonçalves Jardim (d. 1954) and wife Marceliana do Patrocínio de Jesus Cardoso (Funchal, São Pedro, baptized 2 September 1909 - 29 July 2006). He went to Coimbra in order to study at the local university, and he lived there for over a decade as a student. He was awarded a degree of Licentiate in Law from the Faculty of Law of the University of Coimbra in 1973. Jardim became a secondary school teacher. He was also director of the Instituto de Emprego e Formação Profissional da Ilha da Madeira (Employment and Vocational Training Centre of Madeira Island). As a journalist, he was director of \\"Jornal da Madeira\\", and wrote for different Portuguese newspapers and magazines. ==Politics== He was one of the Founders of the then Popular Democratic Party (PPD) in May 1974, a month after the Carnation Revolution, together with Francisco Sá Carneiro, Francisco Pinto Balsemão, Joaquim Magalhães Mota, Carlos Mota Pinto, João Bosco Mota Amaral, António Barbosa de Melo and António Marques Mendes, and co-founder of its Madeiran branch. First elected in 1978 at the age of 35, Alberto João Jardim was then successively elected President of the Regional Government of Madeira 10 times. He is a member of the: * Council of State of the Portuguese Republic as the President of the Regional Government of Madeira * State Defense Council of the Portuguese Republic * State Internal Defense Superior Council of the Portuguese Republic * Homeland Security Superior Council of the Portuguese Republic. He is one of the longest-serving, democratically elected leaders of any jurisdiction in the world. Alberto João Jardim is also a member and former Vice President (2000–2001) of the European Union Committee of the Regions. He is Honorary President of the European Summit of Regions & Cities. He is the founder and a member of the Assembly of European Regions. He was Vice President of European People's Party. On 19 February 2007, he resigned from his office in protest against the new law on regional finances enacted by the national government of José Sócrates. Due to his resignation, early elections had to be scheduled, which he won easily. The national government, nevertheless, announced that the law wouldn't be changed. On 8 January 2011, he suffered a heart attack but recovered and won elections again on 9 October 2011, after winning he promised to resign in early 2015. On 12 January 2015 he retired as President of the Social Democratic Party of Madeira, elections were held and Miguel Albuquerque succeeded him as President of the Social Democratic Party of Madeira. On 14 February 2015 during the carnival of Madeira which Alberto usually participated, he wore a Greek traditional hat, he stated that it was to show his solidarity for the people of Greece and Syriza. He also warned that the new government of Madeira that will replace him should be strong and not bow to the government of Lisbon, because the people of Madeira want strong leadership because Madeira has been robbed by Lisbon for 5 and half centuries, therefore justifying the financial hole that occurred during the later part of his Presidency and if they fail to deliver Je suis un Syriza (I am a Syriza) (It has been speculated that this could mean he would make a comeback if Madeira needed him). No desfile de Carnaval Jardim disse que está solidário com o povo grego, in RTP Madeira On 29 March 2015 regional elections were held and Alberto ruled himself out as he had said he would in 2011, Miguel Albuquerque won the election and became the new president on 20 April 2015. == Family == In 1968 he married Maria Ângela Andrade Martins (born 1940) and had three children: * Cláudia Sofia Martins Gonçalves Jardim (born August 24, 1970), married to David Gomes and mother of Maria Carlota Jardim Gomes (born 1998) * Pedro Alberto Martins Gonçalves Jardim (born January 8, 1972), single * Andreia Luísa Martins Gonçalves Jardim (born 1975), married to José Miguel Monteiro de Resende Tropa (born 1975) and mother of Pedro Afonso Gonçalves Jardim de Resende Tropa (born 2005), Maria Pilar Gonçalves Jardim de Resende Tropa (n. 2013) and João Francisco Gonçalves Jardim de Resende Tropa (2013). ==Controversies== A controversial personality, Jardim is usually seen as an outspoken populist, who is infamous for his often outspoken remarks about his political opponents, from left to right, including several journalists. As Madeira's democratically elected political leader for over 30 years, he has many supporters who view him as a responsible and proactive governor, particularly well regarded in the Archipelago of Madeira proper. Despite his confrontational, explosive and sometimes impolite personality, Jardim has claimed many benefits and privileges for Madeira, helping the region to improve in several fields throughout the years it has been under his leadership. However, the European Union assistance to its ultra-peripheral regions, which includes the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira, has played a major role in the region's development; Madeira's development has been massively aided by structural and cohesion funds allocated by the European Union to the regional government.Portugal-En In addition, Jardim's government of the autonomous region was financially supported, decade across decade, by massive public debt creation and wild over-expenditure. Jardim sobre Silva Lopes: \\"Esse senhor é um incompetente\\" , Diário de Notícias (September 13, 2011) An even more surprising scandal was reported on 16 September 2011, when Portugal's central bank said Madeira island had under-reported its debt since 2004, putting further pressure on the country to meet deficit targets under an international bailout. An evaluation conducted by the Bank of Portugal of Madeira's accounts showed it failed to report EUR1.1 billion ($1.53 billion) in debt from 2008 to 2010 alone. The Bank of Portugal called the omission \\"grave,\\" adding it doesn't know of any similar cases in the rest of the country.Island spending increases Portuguese debt load, CBS Moneywatch.com from September 16, 2011 The debt was finally totaled at €6 billion, €3 billion less than the total that Alberto said mainland Portugal owed Madeira. His name has been often associated with FLAMA, the archipelago's defunct far-right separatist terrorist organization that undertook 70 bombings in Madeira between 1975 and 1978. Although no FLAMA activists were ever brought to justice, Alberto João Jardim has often supported their cause, stating that \\"they should receive a reward not a punishment, since they're defenders of democracy and of the homeland\\".Fundadores da FLAMA asseguram que o ressuscitar do movimento separatista só interessa a Jardim , in Público (Portugal) ==Other affiliations== * He was a fan of C.S.

It was originally named Akwa Akpa, in Efik language. The city is adjacent to the Calabar and Great Kwa rivers and creeks of the Cross River (from its inland delta). Calabar is often described as the tourism capital of Nigeria, especially due to several initiatives implemented during the Duke Administration (1999–2007), which made the city the cleanest and environmentally friendliest city in Nigeria.Achum, T. Valentine http://789marketing.com.ng/calabar-restoring-tourism-glory- nigerias-pride/ Administratively, the city is divided into Calabar Municipal and Calabar South Local Government Areas. It has an area of and a population of 371,022 as at 2006 census. ==History== Duke Town Church, Calabar, late 19th century On 10 September 1884, Queen Victoria signed a Treaty of Protection with the King and Chiefs of Akwa Akpa, known to Europeans as Old Calabar. This enabled the United Kingdom to exercise control over the entire territory around Calabar, including Bakassi. Today, Calabar is a large metropolis with several towns like Akim, Ikot Ansa, Ikot Ishie, Kasuk, Duke Town, Henshaw Town, Cobham Town, Ikot Omin, Obutong. ===Seaport city=== Ship docked in Calabar port in 1981 Since the 16th century, Calabar had been a recognized international seaport, shipping out goods such as palm oil. During the era of the Atlantic slave trade, it became a major port in the transportation of African slaves and was named Calabar by the Spanish. By the 18th century, most slave ships that transported slaves from Calabar were English, with around 85% of these ships being owned by Bristol and Liverpool merchants. Old Calabar (Duke Town) and Creek Town, northeast, were crucial towns in the trade of slaves in that era. The first British warship to sail as far as Duke Town, where she captured seven Spanish and Portuguese slavers, may have been in 1815.Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, p. 129. The main ethnic group taken out of Calabar as slaves were the Igbos, from the neighboring Igbo land. African- American writer and slave John Jea was from the area. A small mulatto community of merchants was located there that had links to missionary and other merchant colonies in Igboland, Lagos, and across the Atlantic. ==Landmarks== The city was the home the first social club in Nigeria, The Africa Club. It hosted the first competitive football, cricket and field hockey games in Nigeria. Among the city's firsts were the first Roman Catholic Mass (held at 19 Bocco Street, Calabar – 1903) and the oldest secondary school (Hope Waddell Training Institution – 1895) in eastern Nigeria. The school later graduated Nnamdi Azikiwe, who was elected as the first President of Nigeria. The city has an international museum, a botanical garden, a Free Trade Zone/Port, an international airport and seaport, an integrated sports stadium complex, a cultural centre, one of the most prominent universities in the country – the University of Calabar, a slave history park and several historical and cultural landmarks. It also has several standard hotels, resorts and amusement parks. The former Liberian warlord Charles Taylor lived in the old colonial palace in the city, under an agreement that led to the end of his country's civil war, before fleeing extradition to Liberia in March 2006. The Tinapa Resort, a development by the Cross River State government, lies to the north of the city beside the Calabar Free Trade Zone. The Cross River State Annual Christmas Festival held every year attracts thousands from within and beyond Nigeria. The festival, includes music performance from both local and international artists. Other annual events include the Calabar Carnival, a boat regatta, fashion shows, a Christmas Village, traditional dances and the annual Ekpe Festival. == Climate == Under Köppen's climate classification, Calabar features a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen: Am) with a lengthy wet season spanning ten months and a short dry season covering the remaining two months. The harmattan, which significantly influences weather in West Africa, is noticeably less pronounced in the city. Temperatures are relatively constant throughout the year, with average high temperatures usually ranging from 25 to 28 degrees Celsius. There is also little variance between daytime and nighttime temperature, as temperatures at night are typically only a few degrees lower than the daytime high temperature. Calabar averages just over of precipitation annually. ==Political authority== Calabar has three principal landlord kingdoms, namely the Qua Kingdom of Ejagham (Ekoi)/Bantu origin, the Efut and the Efik Kingdoms. The Qua Kingdom has the Ndidem of the Qua nation as the Grand Patriarch, the Efut have the Muri munene as the Grand Patriarch, and the Efik Kingdom patriarch is known as the Obong. The Efik political authority as it concerns the Obong is hinged on a political tripod: Creek Town, made up of Ambo, Cobham and Eyo; Old Town, made up of Obutong; and Duke Town, or Atakpa, made up of Duke/Archibong, Eyamba, Ntiero, Henshaw and Cobham. Each leg of this tripod at one time or the other was ruled by a separate Obong. Within the last 100 years, a gentleman's agreement to merge these three zones into one, with a single titular head as the Obong, and the distribution or opening up of the title to all Efik wards, was reached. Each of the aspirants to the throne is eminently qualified, none no more so than the other. The title of the Obong of Calabar had been held by Nsa Effiom and Ekpo Nsa in the 17th century; these two gentlemen were from the Henshaw ward. Attempts by the Henshaw to have an Obong resulted in a war in 1870. The Henshaws did not attain this title again until within the last 50 years, when David Henshaw became Obong. Cobham Town, from which Bassey Ekpo Bassey hails, had its first and only Obong recently. All this was made possible because of \\"the contract\\". ==Calabar Kingdom== Before the colonial period, Calabar, originally known as Akwa Akpa, was a kingdom with the City of Calabar as the site of government, Calabar has three different monarchs, the Obong of Calabar as the ruler of the Efiks and the Ekpe secret society as the stool on which the Obong of Calabar sat. The Ndidem of calabar is the ruler of the Quas and paramount ruler of Calabar Municipality which is the seat of government. The muri munene of the Efuts who is the ruler of the Efuts and paramount ruler of Calabar South. ==Calabar people== Calabar people are mainly people from the Greater Calabar district – Calabar South, Calabar Municipality, Akpabuyo, Bakassi, Biase, Odukpani and Akamkpa, but as commonly used in Nigeria, the term \\"Calabar people\\" could also refer to the indigenes of Greater Calabar as well as the people of the original South Eastern State of Nigeria who are at present the people of Akwa Ibom State and Cross River State. ==Nigerian Navy== Calabar is the headquarters of the Eastern Naval Command. The city has a new model school, Nigerian Navy Secondary School, situated in Akpabuyo, about 10 minutes' drive from the airport. This new school complements the existing Nigerian Navy Primary School and Naval Officers Wives Association Primary School, both situated at Ikot Ansa Calabar. ==See also== * Banknotes of Scotland (featured on design) *Kalabari tribe *Efik people ==References and sources== ===References=== ===Sources=== *Marshall, John (1823–1835) Royal naval biography, or, Memoirs of the services of all the flag-officers, superannuated rear-admirals, retired-captains, post-captains, and commanders, whose names appeared on the Admiralty list of sea officers at the commencement of the present year 1823, or who have since been promoted ...

Dawson was born in Truro, Nova Scotia, a grandson of John Barnhill Dickie and educated at Dalhousie University and McGill University. His research included studies on the transformation of pneumococci and on the biological variants of the streptococcus and other microorganisms. Dawson's studies on the nature and treatment of arthritis made him a recognized authority in this disorder. He was a pioneer in penicillin therapy, and was the first in the world to prepare it and use it in human disease. This included the successful treatment of bacterial endocarditis with penicillin, and the use of gold salts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Dawson became the first person in history to stick a needle full of an antibiotic (penicillin) into a patient, on October 16, 1940. ==Military career== After he had graduated Dalhousie University in Halifax with a BA in 1916 he started serving in the Canadian forces in the First World War. Pte. M. Henry Dawson was with No. 7 Stationary Hospital at La Harve, France. He became a Capt. in the Nova Scotia Reg’t of Canadian Army Medical Corps. He was wounded in 1917 and again in 1918 and was awarded the Military Cross in 1917. ==Career as a researcher== Following the war Dawson attended McGill University in Quebec and received his M.D. degree in 1923. After graduating in Medicine he worked at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal. In 1926 he was appointed a National Research Fellow, assigned to the Rockefeller Institute in New York. As a National Research Council fellow he worked with Oswald Avery at the Rockefeller Institute. Over Avery's strong objections, Dawson recreated Fred Griffith's discovery that a soluble substance from dead bacteria of one type can effect a repeatable and inheritable change in bacteria of another type - a process Dawson termed transformation in his six articles on the subject - in which he was the first person in history to put the substance to work in a test tube and even to partially extract it. The phrase stuck and eventually Avery along with Colin Munro MacLeod proved the substance was in fact DNA. In 1929 Dawson became associated with the Presbyterian Hospital and the Department of Medicine at Columbia University. In 1942 Dawson became the victim of myasthenia gravis, a chronic progressively disabling disease. ==Career== *1916 B.A. Dalhousie University *1923 M.D. McGill University *1923 C.M.

Wood engraving from the guide-book, 1888. Now part of Norsk Folkemuseum An aerial photograph of the open-air museum at Stará Ľubovňa, Slovakia An open-air museum (or open air museum) is a museum that exhibits collections of buildings and artifacts out-of-doors. It is also frequently known as a museum of buildings or a folk museum. The concept of an open-air museum originated in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and spread widely. A comprehensive history of the open-air museum as an idea and institution can be found in Swedish museologist Sten Rentzhog's 2007 book Open Air Museums: The History and Future of a Visionary Idea. Living-history museums, including living-farm museums and living museums, are open-air museums where costumed interpreters portray period life in an earlier era. The interpreters act as if they are living in a different time and place and perform everyday household tasks, crafts, and occupations. The goal is to demonstrate older lifestyles and pursuits to modern audiences. Household tasks might include cooking on an open hearth, churning butter, spinning wool and weaving, and farming without modern equipment. Many living museums feature traditional craftsmen at work, such as a blacksmith, pewtersmith, silversmith, weaver, tanner, armorer, cooper, potter, miller, sawyer, cabinet-maker, woodcarver, printer, doctor, and general storekeeper. ==Definition== Open air is “the unconfined atmosphere…outside buildings…”Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD- ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009 In the loosest sense, an open-air museum is any institution that includes one or more buildings in its collections, including farm museums, historic house museums, and archaeological open-air museums. Mostly, 'open-air museum is applied to a museum that specializes in the collection and re-erection of multiple old buildings at large outdoor sites, usually in settings of recreated landscapes of the past, and often include living history. They may, therefore, be described as building museums. European open-air museums tended to be sited originally in regions where wooden architecture prevailed, as wooden structures may be translocated without substantial loss of authenticity. Common to all open-air museums, including the earliest ones of the 19th century, is the teaching of the history of everyday living by people from all segments of society. ==Origins== Part of the first open-air museum at Bygdøy, opened in 1881, around 1900 A view of Skansen, the first major open-air museum, around 1900 The idea of the open-air museum dates to the 1790s. The first proponent of the idea was the Swiss thinker Charles de Bonstetten, and was based on a visit to an exhibit of sculptures of Norwegian peasants in native costumes in the park of Fredensborg Palace in Denmark,\\"Valley of the Norsemen\\". He believed that traditional peasant houses should be preserved against modernity, but failed to attract support for the idea. The first major steps towards the creation of open-air museums was taken in Norway in 1881, when King King Oscar II transferred four historic farm buildings and the stave church from Gol to the royal manor at Bygdøy near Oslo (Christiania) for public viewing.Hegard, Tonte: Romantikk og fortidsvern. Historien om de første friluftsmuseer i Norge. Oslo, Universitetsforlaget 1984. , pp. 32-61 and 191-212 This, in turn, in 1884 and 1885 inspired Artur Hazelius, founder of the Nordic Museum in Stockholm, to establish his own open-air museum Skansen, adjacent to the Nordic Museum. Skansen, opened to the public in 1891, was a more ambitious undertaking, including farm buildings from across Sweden, folk costumes, live animals, folk music, and demonstrations of folk crafts. The success of the Nordic Museum and Skansen ensured that the open-air museum idea spread to countries across the world. Already in 1894 the Norwegian Folk Museum was founded in Oslo by Hans Aall, inspired by Skansen. Aall bought a large tract of land adjacent to King Oscar's royal collections, probably with a merger between them in mind. The open-air Norsk Folkemuseum was opened at Bygdøy in 1902. In 1907 the royal collections were incorporated after the death of King Oscar and the dissolution of the union with Sweden. Most open- air museums concentrate on rural culture. However, since the opening of the first town museum, The Old Town in Aarhus, Denmark, in 1914, town culture has also become a scope of open-air museums. In many cases, new town quarters are being constructed in existing rural culture museums. ==North American innovations== Traditional buildings in Colonial Williamsburg The North American open-air museum, more commonly called a living-history museum, had a different, slightly later origin than the European, and the visitor experience is different. The first was Henry Ford's Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan (1928), where Ford intended his collection to be “a pocket edition of America”.Kenneth Hudson, Museums of Influence, Cambridge University Press, 1987. Colonial Williamsburg (opened in 1934), though, had a greater influence on museum development in North America. It influenced such projects through the continent as Mystic Seaport, Plimoth Plantation, and Fortress Louisbourg. The approach to interpretation tends to differentiate the North American from the European model. In Europe, the tendency is to usually focus on the buildings. In North America, many open-air museums include interpreters who dress in period costume and conduct period crafts and everyday work. The living museum is, therefore, viewed as an attempt to recreate to the fullest extent conditions of a culture, natural environment, or historical period. The objective is immersion, using exhibits so that visitors can experience the specific culture, environment or historical period using the physical senses. Performance and historiographic practices at American living museums have been critiqued in the past several years by scholars in anthropology and theater for creating false senses of authenticity and accuracy, and for neglecting to bear witness to some of the darker aspects of the American past (e.g., slavery and other forms of injustice). Even before such critiques were published, sites such as Williamsburg and others had begun to add more interpretation of difficult history.Scott Magelssen, Living History Museums: Undoing History Through Performance, Scarecrow Press, 2007 ==List of open-air and living museums by country== ==See also== * Sculpture garden * Historical reenactment * Human zoo * List of Renaissance fairs * List of tourist attractions providing reenactment ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * Association for Living History, Farm and Agricultural Museums * Revista Digital Nueva Museologia Latin American Theory * Main open-air museums in Britain * European Open-air Museums An extensive list of Open-air museums in Europe. * America's Outdoor History Museums * Photos from Museum of Folk Architecture and Life ;Museum websites * Open Air Museum Bokrijk Leading open- air museum of Belgium, Flanders. * Přerov nad Labem open-air museum – photo gallery * Valachian Ethnographic Museum in Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, Czech Republic * Hjerl Hede, an open-air museum in Denmark showing life from the early days until about 100 years ago. * The Old Town (Den Gamle By), Aa open- air museum in Denmark showing urban life. * Jamtli – One of Sweden's largest and oldest regional open-air museums, in Östersund.

The original Royal Warrant was amended by a further Royal Warrant on 1 December 1909 to encompass acts of bravery by all industrial workers in factory accidents and disasters, creating two versions of the Edward Medal: Mines and Industry. In both case (Mines and Industry), the medal was divided in two grades: first class (silver) and second class (bronze), with the medal being a circular silver or bronze medal (as appropriate to the class awarded) suspended from a ribbon 1 3/8\\" wide and coloured dark blue and edged with yellow. The medal associated with mines depicted colliers at work whilst the industry medal had a female figure with an industrial complex in the background. Peculiarly, the cost of the Edward Medal (Mines) was borne by a fund established by a group of philanthropists (including prominent mine owners) and not the state. The Edward Medal (Mines) has been awarded only 395 times (77 silver and 318 bronze) and the Edward Medal (Industry) only 188 times (25 silver and 163 bronze, of which only two were awarded to women), making the Edward Medal one of rarest British gallantry awards. Only posthumous awards were made after 1949, and the Edward Medal (Industry) (1st class) has not been awarded since 1948.

The main performers on the show were Fiona Allen, Doon Mackichan and Sally Phillips. There were also regular appearances from Sarah Alexander, Darren Boyd and Cavan Clerkin. The show's theme tune was a version of the Dusty Springfield song \\"In the Middle of Nowhere\\", sung by Jackie Clune. In addition to the three principal cast members, the show was written by many writers, the core of which went on to write Green Wing and Campus. Among the show's regular themes were unsuccessful relationships, competition in the workplace and latent lesbianism, but sketches would also dip into the surreal. Two regular strands involved a series of different women making dating agency videos about their general likes and dislikes, and a musical parody that would close the show. ==History== The show was created by Victoria Pile after being commissioned by Caroline Leddy of Channel 4 and Peter Fincham at Talkback, who believed that audiences would welcome a female orientated sketch show. The show's title was intended as a spoof of the kind of stories that would feature in annuals aimed at young girls. Originally \\"Spot the Pony\\", it was changed at Kevin Lygo's suggestion to \\"Smack the Pony\\" which some people mistakenly assumed was some kind of sexual euphemism. A pilot was filmed featuring Sally Phillips, Fiona Allen and Amanda Holden. When a full series was commissioned Holden dropped out and Doon Mackichan took her place. Holden still appeared in four episodes of the first series. Other contributors making regular appearances were Sarah Alexander, Darren Boyd and Cavan Clerkin, while Miranda Hart also appeared in a first series episode. In Germany, the first transmission of the show aired on ProSieben, where the theme tune was changed to Texas' 2001 version of \\"I Don't Want a Lover\\", and featured a different title sequence. Deliberately silly and avoiding repetitive catchphrases, the show's surreal humour proved popular and the series had a regular audience of around 2.5 million viewers in the UK. In 2003 the show's leads announced that they would not be continuing with the format, preferring to quit while the show was a success rather than risk diminishing the quality of the material. The trio reunited for a skit in aid of Comic Relief for Red Nose Day 2017. == Selected characters == Most of the characters in the programme are non-recurring. Dating Agency Videos – A part of almost every episode, we see different women or often sisters/couples looking for a partner/partners. This was at first represented by a title screen featuring a picture of the person, and their name and age. This then was replaced by that of a website page. Irritating Flatmate – An irritating nurse who shares a flat with two of her colleagues. She emphasises everything, which often leads to her flatmates' doing something behind her back, such as adding soap and cleaning chemicals to her yoghurt. The Fake Diabetic – A woman who fakes diabetic hypoglycemia so she can have special offers and free items at shops and supermarkets, and which the staff treats seriously. This skit only happened from series 3 onwards. The Oblivious Women – Consists of three women (in different sketches) who are completely oblivious to very obvious things. Sketches included a dog-walking woman being asked to sign a petition so that owners could walk their dogs near the pond. She says that she is not a dog person and is actually phobic. The petitioner and woman look down causing the woman to realize she is walking a dog and then scream. Others included a woman not realising she was pregnant until being asked to sign a petition affecting children. Singing Match – In this sketch, a woman sings along to a tune on the radio, only to be outshone completely by her co-worker who takes over in the following verse. During the rest of the song, her singing becomes more and more intense and extreme as she tries to get back at the other singer, and she ends up screaming and excusing herself with a paper cut on her finger. This particular sketch was voted number 22 in the 2005 Channel 4 programme 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches, chosen by members of the public. It was written by Marie Findley of the Mediæval Bæbes and was also based on their antics. Competitive rivals – This involves the four women who try to 'outdo' each other by subtly showing off bigger and better items such as water bottles and gifts. Naked man – This recurring skit appears in a few first series episodes. The female cast members are going about their daily business when a totally naked man walks across the screen, gets off from bus etc. and causes the women to faint, then they pick themselves up. High-heeled woman – This sketch was spread over all the series, and had a woman performing sports (such as a relay race or surfing) wearing inappropriate high-heeled shoes. The \\"Vet\\" – The sketch featured more prominently from the second series. It featured a vet who had difficulty recognising animals, who would then recommend silly and unusual diagnoses to the animals, such as telling a woman her kitten needed glasses. The Ex – Another sketch that featured more in the second series. A woman clings to the leg of her ex-boyfriend constantly (at work, a nightclub, and even clinging to his leg at his wedding etc.), telling him that she's still in love with him, and hopes to reconcile (unsuccessfully, however). ==List of episodes== ===Series 1 (1999)=== *Episode 1: 19 March 1999 *Episode 2: 26 March 1999 *Episode 3: 2 April 1999 *Episode 4: 9 April 1999 *Episode 5: 16 April 1999 *Episode 6: 23 April 1999 *Episode 7: 30 April 1999 ===Series 2 (2000)=== *Episode 1: 14 April 2000 *Episode 2: 21 April 2000 *Episode 3: 28 April 2000 *Episode 4: 5 May 2000 *Episode 5: 12 May 2000 *Episode 6: 19 May 2000 *Episode 7: 26 May 2000 ===Series 3 (2002)=== *Episode 1: 11 January 2002 *Episode 2: 18 January 2002 *Episode 3: 25 January 2002 *Episode 4: 1 February 2002 *Episode 5: 8 February 2002 *Episode 6: 15 February 2002 *Episode 7: 22 February 2002 ===Specials (2002-2003)=== *Special 1: 26 December 2002 *Special 2: 3 January 2003 ==Awards== In 1999 and 2000, the first two series of Smack the Pony won the Emmy Award for the 'Best Popular Arts Show', and all three series were nominated for Bafta awards. Two sketches from the show made it onto Channel 4's 50 Greatest Comedy Sketches, the first being Saying Goodbye at number 39 and Singing Match at number 22. ==Video and DVD== In Britain, a VHS and DVD of The Best of Smack the Pony were released in 2002 and 2003 respectively.

The village is best known as the birthplace of the Petrović dynasty, which ruled Montenegro from 1696 to 1918, as well as the Montenegrin office of the serdar and guvernadur, held by the Radonjić family. The village is also significant for its well-preserved traditional folk architecture.

The village consists of the settlements: Dugi Do, Žanjev Do, Erakovići, Kopito, Vrba, Raićevići, Velji and Mali Zalazi, Majstori and Mirac. The name Njeguši is according to Ilija Ruvarac derived from Negusius Podcupica, mentioned in an 11th-century document.

According to the 2003 census, the village had 17 inhabitants, of whom 15 declared as Montenegrins, 1 as Serb, and 1 Unknown. According to 2011 census, there were 35 inhabitants, 33 of whom were Montenegrins, one did not want to reveal ethnicity and one was a Russian.Zavod za Statistiku Crne Gore. 2011. \\"Popis na nivou nasejla.\\" http://www.monstat.org/cg/page.php?id=536&pageid;=322 ==Famous people descending from Njeguši== *House of Petrović-Njegoš **Metropolitan Danilo I Petrović-Njegoš **Sava II Petrović Njegoš **Vasilije III Petrović-Njegoš **Petar I Petrović Njegoš **Petar II Petrović-Njegoš **Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro **Mirko Petrović-Njegoš **Nicholas I of Montenegro **Danilo, Crown Prince of Montenegro **Prince Mirko of Montenegro **Prince Peter of Montenegro **Princess Zorka of Montenegro **Princess Milica of Montenegro **Princess Anastasia of Montenegro **Elena of Montenegro **Princess Anna of Montenegro **Princess Xenia of Montenegro **Michael, Prince of Montenegro **Prince Milo of Montenegro *House of Radonjić-Rajićević **Staniša Radonjić, priest, chieftain and military commander **Stanislav Radonjić, guvernadur and military commander **Vukale Stanišić Radonjić, guvernadur and military commander **Jovan Radonjić, guvernadur and military commander **Vukolaj Radonjić, guvernadur and military commander *Rufim Njeguš, Metropolitan of Montenegro *Mašo Vrbica, vojvoda and military commander *Mladen Kašćelan, Montenegrin footballer *Vasko Ševaljević, Montenegrin handball player *Momčilo Otašević, Montenegrin actor ==References== Category:Populated places in Cetinje Municipality ","title":"Njeguši"},{"id":"1442093","text":"International Judge of Chess Compositions is a title award by FIDE via the World Federation for Chess Composition (WFCC; until 2010 Permanent Commission of the FIDE for Chess Compositions, PCCC) to individuals who have judged several chess problem or study tournaments and who are considered capable of judging such awards at the highest level.

She was the younger sister of vocalist Ina Ray Hutton. ==Early years== Hutton was born in Bloomington, Illinois. Her parents were Marvel Svea Williams and Odie Daniel Cowan. June and her older sister, Ina Ray Hutton, both grew up to be entertainers and performers during the Big Band era. Growing up in Chicago, Hutton attended Hyde Park High School, as did her older sister, Ina. While attending high school, she worked in the dress department at Marshall Fields department store. When she was 15, she left home to join her sister in pursuit of a singing career. ==Career== In her early days, she sang at the Astor Roof in New York City. After singing with her sister's orchestra in 1938, she was part of the Winston Trio, the Quintones, and the Sande Williams Band. She appeared with the Quintones in Hi Ya, Gentlemen, a failed musical with boxer Max Baer. In 1941, she became the female vocalist for the Stardusters, the singing group of Charlie Spivak & His Orchestra. After Jo Stafford left The Pied Pipers in 1944, Hutton replaced her, joining the group in May. She performed with the Pied Pipers for six years, recording several hit records including the song \\"Dream.\\" In 1950, Hutton left the Pied Pipers, going solo on Decca Records. (However, the trade publication Billboard reported in its December 10, 1949, issue that Hutton had already left the Pied Pipers and signed with Decca Records.) Hutton's post-Pipers solo career included her debut in New York at the Copacabana nightclub November 16, 1950. In 1951, Hutton married Axel Stordahl, a musical arranger for Tommy Dorsey. In 1952, she went to Capitol Records, backed by an orchestra led by her husband. She recorded three hit records at Capitol: \\"Say You're Mine Again\\", \\"No Stone Unturned\\", and \\"For the First Time\\". They also recorded a well-regarded 1955 album, Afterglow, featuring lush arrangements and the vocal group Boys Next Door. ==Later years== Stordahl died in 1963, and Hutton married actor Kenneth Tobey in 1968. They divorced in 1972. Hutton died in Encino, Los Angeles, on May 2, 1973, at the age of 52. She is buried beside Stordahl at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. ==Partial discography== *If You've Got the Money I've Got the Time/Tear Drops From My Eyes (1950, Decca #27329 with the Lee Gordon Singers.) *My Sweetie Went Away/More Than I Should (1950, Decca 27061) *All the Bees Are Buzzin' Round My Honey/For You, My Love (1950, Decca 24056) *Nothing/Bye, Honey, Bye-Bye (1951 Decca 27833) *Keep It a Secret/I Miss You So (1952, Capitol 2268) *For the First Time/If It's the Last Thing I Do (1953, Capitol 2667) *By the Light of the Silvery Moon (1953 Capitol with Gordon MacRae) *Full Dimensional Sound -- A Study in High Fidelity (1953 Capitol) Hutton was one of several artists included on a long-playing album to \\"demonstrate to audiophiles the full range and capabilities of sound reproducing systems.\\" *The Lights of Home/You Are My Love (1953 Capitol 2369) *I Had a Little Too Much to Dream Last Night/Song of the Sleigh Bells (1953 Capitol 2318) *Coney Island Boat/Open Your Arms (1954 Capitol 2784) *Gee/Too Little Time (1954 Capitol 2727) == References *Solid! page on June Hutton * Sisters, Secrets?

The stated mission of the site is to report events related to Chechnya and also to \\"provide international news agencies with news-letters, background information and assistance in making independent journalistic work in Caucasus\\". Since its inception it has broadcast views supporting independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and later the Caucasian Emirate and the mujahideen worldwide. The website is published in five languages: English, Arabic, Ukrainian, Russian, and Turkish. ==History== Founded in March 1999 in the city of Grozny in Chechnya, the KC was organized and headed by Movladi Udugov, former Minister of Information of Chechnya and then-leader of the \\"national information service\\". The organisation is banned in Russia. According to Dr Greg Simons from Swedish National Defence College, \\"not all of the content on Kavkazcenter can be classified as being extremist and dangerous. However, some material that appears on the website clearly is falling into the realm of extremist and terrorist material.\\" On the other hand, David McDuff, an editor with Prague Watchdog, has written that the Kavkaz Center is \\"thought by some observers to be a disinformation center run with the help of Russia’s special services.\\" The Kavkaz Center caused a major controversy in September 2004 when the server hosting it, located in Lithuania, was shut down by Lithuanian authorities (under pressure from Russian secret services) on hate speech charges, after a letter from the Chechen rebel commander Shamil Basayev claiming responsibility for the Beslan school hostage crisis and a series of photos from the preparations for the attack were published on the site. The website subsequently re-opened on a webserver at the Internet service provider PRQ, in Sweden, and then in April 2008 it moved to an Estonian server, supplied by the AS Starman. After the October 2005 Nalchik attack in the republic of Kabardino-Balkaria, the Kavkaz Center alleged that it was targeted by the FSB in a campaign to discredit them, which consisted on a massive worldwide distribution of spam mail, which supposedly came from the Kavkaz Center website. After receiving several DoS attacks, a message was published on the Kavkaz Center homepage, stating that they never sent the spam people received, and that it was a campaign to discredit them due their points of view. Another spam attack campaign was active again on November 29, 2005, soliciting donations to a bank account in Sweden. In 2006, Russian journalist and regular KC contributor Boris Stomakhin was sentenced by a Moscow court to five years in prison for \\"fueling religious hatred\\". Another Russian regular contributor, Pavel Lyuzakov, was sentenced to two years in a prison colony for illegally acquiring and possessing a firearm in 2005. While the majority of the website focused on Russian stories and ideas, there were also extensive links to \\"reporting\\" dealing with jihadist terrorism (which the site supported) and Israel (which it did not). One such story involved an alleged expose of a dormant Russia-Iraqi-Chechen plan to destroy Israel via an invasion starting in Iraq and going through Jordan, called \\"Dudayev's Plan\\". Another supported a jihadist who murdered French Jews and soldiers in 2012 before being killed by French security forces, outright lying that 18 out of 24 students at a French school supported a teacher who said a prayer for the dead jihadist and said he was framed for the attack by Nicolas Sarkozy (in reality, 18 out of 24 students had LEFT the classroom in disgust and reported the teacher to the school's head office; the teacher, Margaret Collin, was later permanently dismissed from teaching in France). Starting on 6 June 2012 and continuing for over two months, Kavkaz Center was the target of a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that peaked at 45 million packets per second. The attack was said to be among the largest on record and took the agency's main Sweden-based server and mirror sites offline in July 2012. Russia has also pressured Swedish authorities to take down the web site which is hosted by PRQ, a company owned by the founders of The Pirate Bay. According to rulings of the judicial bodies of the Russian Federation, materials published on the site are extremist and incite ethnic hatred.Райсуд в Забайкалье признал экстремистскими ряд публикаций «Кавказцентра» в 2007 году // РИА Новости- Сибирь, 29. 01.2009 г.

Seals, markings, or other techniques may be tamper indicating. ==Tampering== Tampering involves the deliberate altering or adulteration of information, a product, a package, or system. Solutions may involve all phases of product production, distribution, logistics, sale, and use. No single solution can be considered as \\"tamper proof\\". Often multiple levels of security need to be addressed to reduce the risk of tampering. Permanent tamper-evident seal for use on containers to protect integrity Some considerations might include: *Identify who a potential tamperer might be and what level of knowledge, materials, tools, etc. might they have. *Identify all feasible methods of unauthorized access into a product, package, or system. In addition to the primary means of entry, also consider secondary or \\"back door\\" methods. *Control or limit access to products or systems of interest. *Improve the tamper resistance by making tampering more difficult, time-consuming, etc. *Add tamper-evident features to help indicate the existence of tampering. *Educate people to watch for evidence of tampering. *Length of time available for tampering. Particularly in transit, anyone intending to tamper with tamper-evident-protected goods, valuables, cash and confidential documents generally only has a window of opportunity of a few minutes before discovery is likely. This makes it both difficult and unlikely that they will have time to open the packaging, examine or remove the items, and restore the packaging to its original untampered condition. ==Seals and signatures== Tamper-evident designs have been a feature of letters since ancient times, often using wax, clay, or metal seals to signify that the letter had not been opened since it was written. Roman signet rings for example, were unique to the person who owned them, and the ring was pressed into the hot wax seal forming a signature which could not be easily duplicated by somebody attempting to re-seal the letter. Similar practices continue today, from examples such as envelopes to carefully designed packaging for payslips. In modern contract law, it is common to see each page of a contract individually initialled and numbered, so that any addition or removal of pages can be detected. Meanwhile, most checks have a variety of features to defeat both tampering and duplication (these are often listed on the back of the check). Technicians at the National Security Agency developed anti-tamper holograph and prism labels that are difficult to duplicate.Sharon A. Maneki. \\"Learning from the Enemy: The GUNMAN Project\\". 2012. p. 26. Security seals are commonly employed on devices like electronic voting machines in an attempt to detect tampering. However, testing by Argonne National Laboratory and others demonstrates that existing seals can usually be quickly defeated by a trained person using low-tech methods. They offer ideas on countermeasures, and are exploring the promising option of \\"anti-evidence\\" seals. ==Product packaging== Tamper-evident currency bags have a seal that reveals if the bag has been tampered with A foil inner seal on a bottle Tamper-evident design is perhaps most visible in the process of product packaging and labeling, where it can be vital to know that the product has not been altered since it left the manufacturer. Cans of baby food were among the first high-profile cases, where manufacturers were extorted by persons claiming to have added various poisons to baby food and replaced them on supermarket shelves. The amount of stock which needed to be destroyed (because it was impossible to tell if a given item had been tampered with), and the threat of public fear, meant that tamper-evident design principles had the potential to save a lot of money in the future. Jars of food items soon started appearing with a metal bubble-top lid, commonly known as a \\"safety button\\", which—like the lid of a Mason jar—popped out if the jar had ever been opened and stayed flat if the jar was in pristine condition. Customers were advised to never buy a product with a popped lid. (These lids would also pop out if the jar was contaminated by gas-producing bacteria, which was an additional safety feature.) Presumably the seal was achieved by packaging the jars in a low-pressure atmosphere, although companies were reluctant to divulge details. Newer jars of food tend to come with a plastic wrap around the edge of the lid, which is removed when opening, although the springy-cap designs are still in common use. Tamper-evident packaging also extends to protect stores; there are some scale labels for meats and deli products that will tear if removed. The 1982 Chicago Tylenol murders involved over-the- counter medications. Due to FDA regulations, many manufacturers of food and medicine (as well as other products) now use induction sealing and other special means to help provide evidence of tampering. Break-away components which cannot be reattached are useful. Custom seals, security tapes, labels, RFID tags, etc. are sometimes added. The current epidemic of opioid abuse and drug abuse has led to a search for tamper-evident strategies to protect central vascular lines. Drug users who shoot drugs into their veins often acquire infections of the heart valves (endocarditis), liver, bones, lungs, and other organs. Treatment of these infections requires several weeks of intravenous antibiotics. During the treatment period, these patients can use the central intravenous line or peripherally inserted central line (PICC) to inject narcotics or other illicit drugs. Evidence exists that applying a tamper-evident device to the central line can deter illicit use of the line. Security packaging is needed to contain evidence of crimes. Items must be kept in an unaltered state until they are submitted in a legal proceeding. Packaging that tears open raggedly or otherwise cannot readily be resealed is sometimes used to help indicate tampering. Often, multiple layers or redundant indicators are used because no single layer or device is \\"tamper-proof\\". Consideration should be given to unique custom indicators (which should be changed regularly because these are subject to counterfeiting). End-users and consumers need to be educated to watch for signs of tampering, both at the primary means of entrance and at secondary or \\"back door\\" locations on a package. ==Credit cards, money, stamps, coupons== In financial terms, tamper- evident design overlaps a lot with anti-forgery techniques, as ways to detect monetary tokens which are not what they seem. Postage stamps, for example, may contain a layer of ultraviolet-reflective ink which changes state under pressure. The impact from a postmarking machine then leaves a UV-visible mark as well as an ink mark which identifies attempts to reuse stamps. In a similar vein, asset-numbering labels on corporate equipment (PCs and the like) are often designed to leave an imprint of either the serial number, or the word \\"VOID\\" if the label is peeled off. However, this can easily be defeated by warming up the label using a blow dryer so it will be more flexible and forgiving to removal (and reapplication). Road tax vignettes and price tags are often tamper-evident in the sense that they cannot be removed in one piece. This makes it difficult to move a vignette from one car to another, or to peel off a price tag from a cheaper article and reapply it to a more expensive one. Money is tamper-evident in the sense that it should be difficult to produce a financial token without authorization, even if starting from a token of lower value. For example, forgers may attempt to clean the ink from a banknote and print the image of a higher-denomination note on it, giving them the carefully guarded \\"banknote paper\\" which is otherwise very difficult to obtain. This may be one of the reasons why many countries use banknotes of different size in ascending order of value. A British £5 banknote issued by Bank of England is much smaller than a £50 banknote, and therefore can't be used to create a £50 note. ==Physical security== Tamper-evident physical devices are common in sensitive computer installations, for example network cabling is often run down transparent conduit in plain view and switches located in glass-fronted cabinets, where any unusual device attached to the network can easily be seen. Despite the easy availability of miniature key loggers, tamper-evident design is not often used in personal computers. While transparent computer cases and keyboards are common, they are mainly used for the decorative effect rather than security. Many PCs do have a switch to detect opening of the case, and this provides a visual notification when the computer is next turned on that the case has recently been opened. In any case, it has long been possible to complicate the task of tampering with electronic devices by sealing them with tamper-evident tape or sealing wax. Alternatively, radio-controlled alarm-devices (which transmit a silent alarm) can be installed, or cases can be glued shut in such a manner that tampering attempts will distort or fracture the casing. Fire alarms and other emergency switches are typically non-reversible, using a piece of glass which must be broken to activate the alarm. For example, Panic buttons in burglar alarm systems might require a plastic key to reset the switch. In very much the same manner as with fire alarms, many emergency handles and levers, or handles that are not meant to be opened regularly, are enclosed in a thin metal or plastic security seal. The seal is thin, so as not to prevent the handle from being used (in due time), but only to alert maintenance/security personnel that the handle was indeed used. Many times, large sea-going shipping containers have such a metal ring or seal attached to them at the source port. After traveling at sea (and perhaps by land as well), the containers reach their destination, where each container is checked to have the seal properly in place (against a list of doublets - container/seal). In police work, tamper-evident techniques must often be used to guard access to evidence, providing means of storing items and samples in a way which can be used to prove that they were not altered after their collection. It could be argued that CCTV systems perform a similar function in the handling of suspects. Video systems of course, can be given tamper-evident features by the use of timestamps generated by a suitably trusted clock. ==Computer systems== In cryptographic terminology, cryptographic hash functions and cryptographic signatures are used to add a tamper-evident layer of protection to document, often referred to as an electronic signature. Hardware-encrypted full disk drives utilise tamper- evident cases, so when it is retrieved the owner can be assured that the data has not been compromised, thus preventing costly further actions such as notifying the data owners.Nationwide wrote to all customers The document, email, or file to be protected is used to generate a signed hash, a number generated from the contents of the document. Any change to the document, no matter how trivial, such as changing a single bit from a 1 to a 0, will cause it to have a different hash, which will make the signature invalid. To alter a document while purposely maintaining the same hash, assuming the hash function and the program implementing it are properly designed, is extremely difficult.

With the exception of the nose and tail turrets, all armament was removed, as was all armor. The interior of the plane was made into a flying office for MacArthur, with extra windows, cooking facilities, and living space. To facilitate entry and exit, a drop-down door with steps was installed in the rear fuselage. A similar conversion was later made on a B-17F-40-VE (42-6036), which was redesignated YC-108. Between August 1943 and March 1944, another B-17E (41-2595) was converted to a cargo aircraft and designated XC-108A. Hoping to convert obsolete bombers into cargo aircraft, the United States Army Air Forces initiated a remanufacturing station at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The plane was stripped of armament, armor, and other military equipment. Crew locations were shifted, and the nose was modified to provide space for cargo and/or personnel. The cockpit was accessed via the crawlway under it or through the hinged solid nose cone that had replaced the original glazed bombardier station. To increase cargo space, several bulkheads were removed and the bomb bay doors were sealed closed. This allowed much of the fuselage volume to be used to carry cargo or personnel. A B-17F 42-30190 was converted (and given designation XC-108B) to tanker service. As in the XC-108A, it was devoid of armor and weapons, and the fuselage was modified to make space for its cargo. The fuselage was filled with fuel tanks. ==Operational history== Boeing XC-108. The XC-108 was personal VIP transport aircraft of General Douglas MacArthur in 1943. The XC-108A was used to fly material and personnel over the Himalayas to the B-29 base in Chengdu, China. Due to chronic engine difficulties, it proved an impractical cargo aircraft. In October 1944, it was returned to the United States. By the end of the war, it was disassembled and left in a junkyard in Maine, where it suffered from some parts being scrapped and others salvaged from the airframe. Since then it has been rescued and is under restoration back to B-17E configuration. ==Variants== CB-17G at Patterson Field, Ohio on January 1, 1946. ;XC-108 :B-17E converted to VIP transport standard for General Douglas MacArthur. ;YC-108 :B-17F converted to VIP transport standard for General Douglas MacArthur. ;XC-108A :B-17E converted to cargo or troop transport standard. ;XC-108B :B-17F converted for service as a tanker.

The 7878 caliber Eco-Drive movement used in this watch can run for up to 180 days on its secondary power cell. Four solar cell segments are just visible under the dial.

Citizen Eco-Drive METAL AW1365-19P featuring a light- absorbing \\"solar ring\\" instead of solar cell panels, allowing opaque metal dials to be used. Example of the invisible solar cells thanks to VITRO technology, using the CB0021-06E radio-controlled watch model (from 2011 to 2018). Eco-Drive is a model range of watches manufactured and marketed worldwide by Citizen Watch Co., Ltd., powered primarily by light. As of 2007, the company estimated the drive system had eliminated the disposal of ten million batteries in North America. Citizen introduced the Eco-Drive line to Asia, Latin America, and Europe in 1995 and to the United States in April, 1996. The Eco-Drive concept introduced several technical refinements over previous solar powered watches, including light-capturing cells that could be made virtually invisible behind the dial instead of highly conspicuous, enhancing the appearance of the watch. ==History== ===Eco-Drive concept=== The technical platform that made the Eco-Drive concept possible was the Eco-Drive caliber 7878 movement. This movement was the first light-powered movement where the solar cells could be mounted under the dial. Previous light powered watches from Citizen and other manufacturers had the solar cell(s) mounted directly on the dial. This innovation was enabled by marked improvements in thin film amorphous silicon solar cells, which, by the early 1990s had become significantly more efficient. By locating a sufficiently translucent dial material over the now more efficient solar cells, enough light could pass through the dial face to power the movement. Though the Eco-Drive caliber 7878 movement solar cells remained slightly visible through the dial, the physical styling of the light-powered watch was no longer constrained by visible solar cells. To store electrical energy the first Eco-Drive movements employed titanium lithium-ion rechargeable or secondary batteries. This battery type became available in the early 1990s, enabling an Eco-Drive 7878 movement to run 180 days on secondary power before requiring recharging via light exposure – a marked improvement in energy storage over previous light-powered watches. The movement also featured an \\"insufficient recharging\\" indicator. The accuracy of the quartz movement was stated as within ± 20 seconds per month at a normal temperature range of .Instruction manual for caliber 7878 movements ===Commercial history=== In addition to the first three Eco-Drive models introduced in 1995, Citizen marketed numerous other Eco-Drive models during the 1990s, including the thick Eco-Drive Slim of 1996. Where the first models offered hours, minutes, seconds and date features, ultimately the movements evolved to include a broad range of design features, including complex analog and digital-analog movements and the horological complications of chronographs, flyback chronographs and dive watches. In the early 2000s, while wristwatch sales declined with the advent of cell phones and their timekeeping capability, demand for Citizen watches in North America remained robust. Eco- Drive models were well received, generating a third of Citizen's North American revenues by 2000. In 2002 the VITRO technology (Eco-Drive VITRO) came on the market, where the solar cells were no longer even slightly visible under the dial. During the mid-2000s, wristwatch sales improved for Citizen thanks to further development of the Eco-Drive line and integration of radio- controlled timing with the 2002 Eco-Drive line. Later specialized tool watch designs were introduced like the Promaster Eco-Drive Professional Diver 1000M Titanium BN7020-09E in 2017. This is a very large watch, the titanium watch case has a diameter of 52.2 mm and thickness of 22 mm and features a helium release valve, designed for mixed gas saturation diving at great depths.Citizen Promaster Eco-Drive Professional Diver 1000M Titanium BN7020-09E Solarzilla - The Ultimate Tool Watch, A Review (plus Video)Hands-On With The Mighty Citizen Promaster Professional Diver’s 1000MSolarzilla: Reviewing the Citizen Promaster Eco-Drive Professional Diver 1000M Eco- Drive Concept Models Since 2009, Citizen has developed Eco-Drive Concept Models as technology demonstration and marketing tools.

As a result, errors caused by spatial orientation and positioning become less of a concern.Crystal Units / Crystal Oscillators Technical Guide The Caliber 0100 movement in 2018 was not available for sale to the public, the technology inside the movement will be introduced in future models.CITIZEN unveils world’s most accurate Cal.0100 Eco-Drive movement with annual accuracy ±1 second at BASELWORLD 2018 In March 2019 three limited edition wrist watch models with the Caliber 0100 movement were announced to become available for sale with deliveries expected around the 2019 fall.Baselworld 2019 Citizen Unveils its New Eco-Drive Caliber 0100 with +/- 1 Second Per Year Precision Recent history According to Citizen, by 2011 80% of their wristwatches featured Eco-Drive, and the company saw Eco-Drive type watches as the focus of new generations of watches.Eco-Drive is designed for the Future In 2012 Citizen offered over 320 Eco-Drive watch models in various types, styles and price ranges.CITIZEN Eco-Drive site ==Eco-Drive technology== ===Light as power source=== Most Eco-Drive type watches are equipped with a special titanium lithium ion secondary battery charged by an amorphous silicon photocell located behind the dial. Light passes through the crystal and dial before reaching the photocell. Depending on the electronic movement, a fully charged secondary power cell could run with no further charging from 30 days to 3,175 days (8.7 years), though most Eco-Drive men's watch models offer a six-month power reserve.Loading properties of Eco-Drive watch movements (German) If kept from light for an extended period, some Eco-Drive movement models can hibernate, where the hands of the watch stop and the internal quartz movement continues to track the correct time. When subsequently exposed to sufficient light, the hands move automatically (without human intervention) to the proper positions and resume regular timekeeping. ===Temperature difference as power source=== Citizen Eco-Drive Thermo watches were introduced in 1999 and use the temperature difference between the wearer's arm and the surrounding environment as a power source. The rare Eco-Drive Thermo watches use the Seebeck effect to generate thermo electricity that powers the electronic movement and charges the secondary power cell. In the sun or in the tropics the ambient temperature can come close to or exceed the temperature of the wearer's wrist causing the watch to stop generating thermo electricity. In case no power is generated, an Eco-Drive Thermo movement will save power by moving the second hand in ten second increments until the production of thermo electricity is resumed. Citizen has stopped making Eco-Drive Thermo watches. ===Hybrid Eco-Drive movements=== Citizen also built an automatic quartz powered watch, the Citizen Promaster Eco-Duo Drive (released in December 1998). Novel to this watch was the use of both mechanical power as well as a solar cell to power the electronic movement and charge the secondary power cell. This model was an attempt to enter higher-priced markets (at a cost of around $1,000 USD). The Eco-Duo Drive technology failed to attract consumer interest and Citizen has since stopped making use of the unique movement. ===Solar cell and secondary battery life expectancy=== According to Citizen, experimental data showed the solar cell and secondary battery will last for more than 10 years.Citizen Service & Support FAQ Eco_Drive According to Citizen Europe, laboratory tests showed that after 20 years the secondary battery retains a power storage capacity of 80% of its initial capacity.Citizen Watch Europe GmbH: ECO-DRIVE Technologie (German) (archived 2007) Newer Citizen claims state the rechargeable/secondary batteries will last up to 40 years and that it is highly unusual for these batteries to fail.FREQUENLY ASKED QUESTIONS CITIZEN ECO-DRIVE ==Maintenance== For water resistant and diving Eco-Drive watches Citizen recommends a watch gasket exchange every 2 or 3 years to preserve their water resistance because watch gaskets, which form a watertight seal, degrade as they age. Further, Citizen recommends maintenance for Eco-Drive watch movements in regular intervals in order to extend the life of the watch movement, since the gears used in running watch movements are subject to slow wear. Citizen states that when their lubricants for Long-Lasting Precision Equipment are used in watches, timepiece movements remain smooth for a long time as the oil does not harden even after 20 years. ==Gallery== File:Citizen gn4ws.jpgCitizen Eco-Drive Marinaut Titan GN 4W S.

It flows in a northeast direction to its terminus just west of Cape Best, with an eastern distributary almost reaching the west side of Fortuna Bay, on the north coast of South Georgia. It was named in about 1912, presumably after the whale catcher Fortuna, and is notable for two major events in the 20th Century. ==1916== In mid-April 1915, explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship Endurance, carrying the 27 members of his Antarctic expedition, became locked in the polar ice in the Weddell Sea just off Antarctica. In the spring of 1916, as the ice warmed and drifted north, the ship was crushed. The party used the lifeboats to get to Elephant Island, a desolate, uninhabited island at the edge of the Antarctic Peninsula. There they were stranded. Shackleton and five others crammed into a lifeboat, the James Caird, sailed across the Scotia Sea for , reaching South Georgia two weeks later. They landed on the island's uninhabited west side at King Haakon Bay. Poor weather prevented them from setting sail again to one of the whaling stations on the island's east side, which were the only human habitation on South Georgia. Instead they had to cross the largely unknown interior of the island. Shackleton beached his boat and with two others made his traverse of the island, crossing the Fortuna Glacier in the process. Thirty-six hours later they reached Stromness whaling station. ==1982== Fortuna Glacier in November 2009 When Argentina militarily occupied the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, the British Armed Forces recaptured the island in 'Operation Paraquet', thereby removing the Argentinian military presence and restoring the island to British Sovereignty. It was decided to land a mountain troop of Special Air Service and 42 Royal Marine Commandos on the glacier, to approach Grytviken from the most unlikely direction. After the troops were landed on the glacier in conditions of extremely poor visibility and gale extreme force winds on 21 April, their conditions deteriorated rapidly still further. During several repeated rescue attempts the following day by a Wessex 3 (Antrim) and two Wessex V (Tidespring) helicopters, the Wessex V aircraft crashed in extreme weather conditions. The Wessex 3, crewed by Lt Cdr Ian Stanley, Lt Chris Parry, Sub Lt Stewart Cooper and PO ACMN David Fitzgerald, succeeded in rescuing all troops and aircrew in an amazing feat of flying and navigation just before dark. On returning to Antrim, the Wessex 3 (which can be seen at the Fleet Air Arm Museum at Yeovilton, Somerset) held 16 personnel instead of its normal 4 capacity. ==See also== * List of glaciers in the Antarctic * Glaciology == References == Category:Glaciers of South Georgia Category:Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition Category:Falklands War in South Georgia ","title":"Fortuna Glacier"},{"id":"1442127","text":"is a town located in Tokachi Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan.

Pierce was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity. He was also elected to Cornell's oldest senior honor society, the Sphinx Head Society. Pierce served in the United States Army's Criminal Investigation Division during World War II. Pierce graduated from Cornell University in 1947 and received a law degree from Cornell Law School in 1949. He earned a master of laws degree from New York University School of Law in 1952. ==Political career== Pierce was an assistant United States attorney in New York from 1953 to 1955. A lifelong Republican, he first entered government when Eisenhower was president. He became an assistant to the Undersecretary of Labor in 1955. Pierce was appointed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to serve as a judge in New York City, 1959–1960. Pierce was named a partner of the law firm of Battle Fowler in 1961, the first African-American partner of a major New York firm, and was there until 1981 except for a period from 1970 through 1973 when—during the Nixon presidency—he was general counsel for the Department of the Treasury. Pierce argued before the United States Supreme Court on behalf of Martin Luther King Jr. and the New York Times in the important First Amendment case styled New York Times v. Sullivan. In 1981, Pierce became Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Ronald Reagan. Pierce was Reagan's only African American cabinet member and the only cabinet member to serve in his post throughout both of Reagan's terms as President. On June 18, 1981 during a luncheon for the US Conference of Mayors in Washington DC, President Reagan mistook Pierce for one of the mayors on the dais, with the famous \\"Hello, Mr. Mayor\\" comment. Due to his perceived low profile within the Reagan administration, he was sometimes derided as \\"Silent Sam.\\"Time magazine, \\"Silent Sam Speaks Up,\\" by Michael Riley, Nancy Traver and Samuel Pierce (September 18, 1989 – retrieved on August 7, 2010). During Pierce's tenure, HUD appropriations for low-income housing were cut by nearly half and funding all but ended for new housing construction. ==Political scandal== After leaving office, he was investigated by the United States Office of the Independent Counsel and the United States Congress over mismanagement, abuse and political favoritism that took place in the department during his tenure. These investigations found that under Pierce's stewardship the department engaged in political favoritism and trading of influence. Millions of dollars of federal government money was given to projects sought by connected politicians of both parties, in violation of rules governing such grants and expenditures. Through the 1990s many of Pierce's closest aides and confidants at the department were charged and convicted on felony charges related to the political favoritism and inappropriate expenditures that pervaded the department during Pierce's tenure (Thomas Demery, Phillip Winn, Joseph Strauss and Deborah Gore Dean). Pierce himself was not charged, however. ==Death== Pierce died at the Holy Cross Hospital outside Washington, D.C., on October 31, 2000, at the age of 78. ==See also== *List of African-American United States Cabinet Secretaries ==References== ==External links== * Samuel Pierce biography * Atlanta Journal- Constitution article from Pierce's tenure * Category:1922 births Category:2000 deaths Category:20th-century American politicians Category:African-American members of the Cabinet of the United States Category:Cornell Law School alumni Category:Distinguished Eagle Scouts Category:New York (state) Republicans Category:New York University School of Law alumni Category:Politicians from Glen Cove, New York Category:Reagan administration cabinet members Category:Reagan administration controversies Category:United States Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development ","title":"Samuel Pierce"},{"id":"1442134","text":"The People's Union (, Ittihad Al Shaab) was an electoral coalition in Iraq, led by the Iraqi Communist Party. ==2005 elections== The People's Union was the main communist party list in the January 2005 Iraqi legislative election.

Pinetown is situated 16 km west of Durban at an elevation of 1,000 to 1,300 feet (305 to 395 m). ==History== Pinetown was named after the governor of Natal, Sir Benjamin Pine. The town was established in 1850 around the Wayside Hotel, itself built in 1849 along the main wagon route between Durban and Pietermaritzburg. In the Victorian era Pinetown was known as health resort. During the Second Boer War, the British built a concentration camp in Pinetown to house Boer women and children. A number of German settlers made Pinetown their base and this accounts for the neighbourhood known as New Germany and the German Lutheran Church. Indeed, to this day imported German cakes and goodies pack the shelves at Christmas time in the Knowles Spar, the largest grocery store of Pinetown. One of the largest monasteries was located south of Pinetown in Mariannhill, home to the Mariannhill monastery founded by Abbott Francis Pfanner. The establishment of this monastery had huge influence in the expansion of the Catholic Church in KwaZulu Natal. The area of Clermont was a solely black residential zone during the apartheid era, with land tenure being on a freehold basis unlike the state-owned townships elsewhere in the Durban vicinity. This meant residents enjoyed an atmosphere of freedom and this led to Clermont being a base for some well-known political activists during the apartheid era such as the lawyer Archie Gumede. Other personalities associated with Clermont are relatives of the leader of the world-renowned Ladysmith Black Mambazo musical group. ==Municipality boundaries== Pinetown is part of the larger eThekwini Municipality and, for voting purposes, falls within the IEC electoral Ward 18. The area from Cowies Hill in the east, along Josiah Gumede (Old Main) Road/M1 to Westmead industrial area in the west, is commonly referred to as the Pinetown area; The foundations and structures of the original town can be found at the corner of Josiah Gumede (Old Main) Road and Stapleton Road. ==Infrastructure== King Cetshwayo Highway and N3 freeway at Paradise Valley, Pinetown ===Transport=== The first phase of a rapid bus system, GO!Durban, was due for implementation in September 2019, but was postponed when the eThekwini municipality was unable to integrate taxi associations in their plans. The first phase envisages a link between Pinetown CBD and KwaMashu’s Bridge City Mall. ===Shopping mall=== Pine Crest Centre, situated at 17 Kings Road, is the biggest retail center in town. It opened around 1988 as the Sanlam Center. In 2017 it was acquired by the JSE-listed company Vukile, and was upgraded to offer over 100 stores. ===Education=== One of five campuses of the University of KwaZulu-Natal is in Pinetown, on the corner of Richmond and Mariannhill Roads. The Edgewood campus was originally established in the 1970s as a college to train (mostly white) students as teachers for the apartheid government's schools serving the white community. The purpose-built facilities were superior to other colleges of education where students of other races were trained as teachers. The specialised facilities enabled the training of art, music, drama, science and physical education teachers, and included rooms with overhead viewing platforms for unobtrusive classroom lesson demonstrations. In 2001, as part of the central government's rationalisation of the higher education landscape, the Edgewood College of Education was incorporated into the University of Natal. Then in 2004, with the merger of the Universities of Natal and Durban-Westville to form the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Edgewood became the new University's 5th campus. Edgewood campus is wholly dedicated to the education of teachers and education professionals and is one of the largest producers of new teachers in South Africa. On this campus the University's School of Education offers a four-year full-time Bachelor of Education (B Ed) degree and one-year full-time Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) for those wanting a teaching qualification. Various other certificates are also offered as in-service training for teachers, as well as Honours, Masters and Doctoral degrees. The library collection is specially equipped to enable those studying education from undergraduate through to doctoral levels. ===Schools=== Main entrance of Pinetown Girls' High School in Josiah Gumede Road, Pinetown's main arterial road Schools in Pinetown include: * Pinetown Boys' High School * Pinetown Girls' High School * Benjamin Pine Primary School * Sarnia Primary School * Highway College (independent) * John Wesley School (independent) * Pinetown Junior & Senior Primary School * Browns School (special needs education) * St Benedict School Pinetown (independent) * Lyndhurst Primary School * New Germany Primary School * Ashley Primary School * St Francis College (independent) * Gelofte Skool, the only Afrikaans-medium school in the area * Margot Fonteyn Secondary School * Kloof High School * Mariannridge Primary School * St Wendolins Primary school * Kranskloof Primary School * Ndengetho Secondary School * Sarnia Primary School * Mathinta Secondary School * Thornwood Secondary School * KwaSanti Public Secondary * Nonopha Senior Primary school * IsiZinda Secondary school * Westmead Secondary school * Bahlebonke Primary school * Savannah Park Secondary * Jubilee Primary school ===Pre-Schools=== Pre-Schools in Pinetown include: * Kokkewiet Pre Pimêre Skool - Afrikaans * Stepping Stones Pre-Primary School - English * Whizz Kidz Pre-Primary School - English * Ehlophe Edu-Care School ===Local businesses=== Pinetown has a reputation as a \\"motor town\\", due to the high number of motor dealerships along Josiah Gumede Road (formerly Old Main Road). The city has several shopping centres, including Pine Crest and Pine Walk on Kings road, Knowles Spar superstore and St John's Checkers centre. A number of Do It Yourself (DIY) shops are located along Josiah Gumede Road. ===Medical facilities=== Pinetown's medical facilities include: * St Mary's, a government hospital in Mariannhill * Life Crompton Hospital, a private hospital * Medicross, a private medical centre ==Sport== ===Cricket club=== Pinetown Cricket Club, established in 1873, is believed to be the oldest cricket club in KwaZulu-Natal and amongst the oldest in South Africa. The club, originally located at the Civic Centre in central Pinetown, has subsequently moved to Lahee Park. Under the chairmanship of former Pinetown mayor Vernon Hall, Lahee Park hosted ten first class games between 1974 and 1979. Former internationals Norman Crookes (twice selected for the Springbok squad) and Tertius Bosch have previously represented the club. Khaya Zondo and Cameron Delport from the 2010 Dolphins team have a close association with the club, as do KZN \\"B\\" cricketers Bruce Kruger and Kyle Buckthorp. ===Comrades Marathon=== Pinetown is situated on the route of the popular Comrades Marathon, which runs along the Old Main Road from Westville, over Cowies Hill past the Civic Centre and on to Fields Hill, and vice versa. This event always attracts hundreds of spectators who line the route every year to catch a glimpse of their friends and loved ones in the marathon. ==References== ==External links== *durban.gov.za *St. Wendolins Ridge, Pinetown Category:1850 establishments in the Colony of Natal Category:Populated places established in 1849 Category:Populated places in eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality Category:Second Boer War concentration camps ","title":"Pinetown"},{"id":"1442145","text":"The Temple on Temple Island, the iconic starting point of Henley Women's Regatta. Henley Women's Regatta, often abbreviated to \\"HWR\\" or \\"Women's Henley\\", is a rowing regatta held at Henley-on-Thames, England. Chris Aistrop and Rosemary Mayglothling were jointly responsible for setting up the Regatta in June 1988 and Aistrop was the first chairman. It was first held in 1988, as a response to the absence of women's events at Henley Royal Regatta at that time. While Henley Royal Regatta now offers eight women's events, Women's Henley has continued to build and expand. Henley Women's Regatta now lasts three full days, and includes time trials for over-subscribed events. Henley Women's Regatta is held on the Thames River at Henley, using the same, but shortened, boomed course as Henley Royal. The Henley Women's Regatta course runs for 1,500m in comparison with Henley Royal's 2112m. The Henley Women's Regatta course begins at the top of Temple Island and has its finish line in front of the Remenham Club, where the Friends of Henley Women's Regatta enclosure is located. It takes place over a Friday, Saturday and Sunday in mid to late June. In 2004 the regatta has offered Intermediate, Senior and Elite categories instead of College, Club and Open. Junior categories are also offered. In 2011 the regatta also began to offer Adaptive events. On 1 December 2017 HWR announced that the Competition Structure events would be altered for the 2018 regatta to recategorise the events into Championship, Aspirational, Development, Junior, Junior under 16, and Para Rowing.

He is usually referred to as D. H. Hill, in part to distinguish him from unrelated Confederate general A. P. Hill, who served with him in the Army of Northern Virginia. He was known as an aggressive leader, being severely strict, deeply religious and having dry, sarcastic humor. He was brother-in-law to Stonewall Jackson, a close friend to both James Longstreet and Joseph E. Johnston, but disagreements with both Robert E. Lee and Braxton Bragg cost him favor with Confederate President Jefferson Davis. Although his military ability was well respected, he was underutilized by the end of the Civil War on account of these political feuds. ==Early life== D. H. Hill was born at Hill's Iron Works, in York District, South Carolina to Solomon and Nancy Cabeen Hill. His paternal grandfather, Col. William \\"Billy\\" Hill, was a native of Ireland who had an iron foundry in York District where he made cannon for the Continental Army. His maternal grandfather was a native of Scotland. Hill graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1842, ranking 28 out of 56 cadets, and was appointed to the 1st United States Artillery. As an infantry officer he distinguished himself in the Mexican–American War, being brevetted to captain for bravery at the Battle of Contreras and Churubusco, and brevetted to major for bravery at the Battle of Chapultepec. Among the slaves owned by the Hill family during Daniel Harvey's youth was Elias Hill, whom Daniel Harvey helped teach to read and write and who later became a preacher and led his congregation in emigrating to Liberia.Witt, John Fabian. Patriots and Cosmopolitans: Hidden Histories of American Law. Harvard University Press, Jun 30, 2009 p. 85–86, 128–149 In February 1849, Daniel Harvey Hill resigned his commission and became a professor of mathematics at Washington College (now Washington and Lee University), in Lexington, Virginia. While living in Lexington, he wrote a college textbook for the Southern United States market, Elements of Algebra, which \\"with quiet, sardonic humor, points a finger of ridicule or scorn at any and everything Northern.\\" While not all of the textbook's questions were \\"anti-Yankee\\", many were, such as: By contrast, \\"Southerners in his problems invariably appear in a favorable light.\\" In 1854, he joined the faculty of Davidson College, North Carolina, and was, in 1859, made superintendent of the North Carolina Military Institute of Charlotte. ===Marriage and children=== On November 2, 1848, he married Isabella Morrison, who was the daughter of Robert Hall Morrison, a Presbyterian minister and the first president of Davidson College, and through her mother, a niece of North Carolina Governor William Alexander Graham. They would have nine children in all. One son, Daniel Harvey Hill Jr., would serve as president of North Carolina State College (now North Carolina State University). Their youngest son, Joseph Morrison, would preside as the Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court from 1904 to 1909. In July 1857, Isabella's younger sister, Mary Anna, married Professor Thomas J. Jackson of the Virginia Military Institute. Hill and Jackson, who would later earn the nickname \\"Stonewall\\" as a Confederate officer, had crossed paths during the Mexican–American War, and later developed a closer friendship when both men lived in Lexington, Virginia in the 1850s.Bridges, Lee's Maverick General, pp. 21-25, 277. Also in 1857, Jackson endorsed Elements of Algebra as \\"superior to any other work with which I am acquainted on the same branch of science.\\" ==Civil War== At the outbreak of the Civil War, D.H. Hill was made colonel of the 1st North Carolina Volunteers, the \\"Bethel Regiment\\", at the head of which he won the Battle of Big Bethel, near Fort Monroe, Virginia, on June 10, 1861. Shortly after this, on July 10, 1861, he was promoted to brigadier general and commanded troops in the Richmond area. By the spring of 1862, he was a major general and division commander in the Army of Northern Virginia. He participated in the Yorktown and Williamsburg operations that started the Peninsula Campaign in the spring of 1862, and as a major general, led a division with great distinction in the Battle of Seven Pines and the Seven Days Battles. Hill's division was left in the Richmond area while the rest of the army went north and did not participate in the Northern Virginia Campaign. On July 22, 1862, Hill and Union Maj. Gen. John A. Dix concluded an agreement for the general exchange of prisoners between the Union and Confederate armies, known as the Dix-Hill Cartel.See Dix's report to Union Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, July 23, 1862, Official Records, Series II, vol. 4, pp. 265–68. This established a scale of equivalents, where an officer would be exchanged for a fixed number of enlisted men, and also allowed for the parole of prisoners, who would undertake not to serve in a military capacity until officially exchanged. (The cartel worked well for a few months, but broke down when Confederates insisted on treating black prisoners as fugitive slaves and returning them to their previous owners.) \\"Bloody Lane\\" in the sunken road after the Battle of Antietam, 1862. General D. H. Hill's Confederate troops received multiple assaults and an enfilading fire from several Union divisions leaving this bloody scene. In the Maryland Campaign of 1862, Hill's men fought at South Mountain. Scattered as far north as Boonsboro, Maryland when the fighting began, the division fought tooth and nail, buying Lee's army enough time to concentrate at nearby Sharpsburg. Hill's division saw fierce action in the infamous sunken road (\\"Bloody Lane\\") at Antietam, and he rallied a few detached men from different brigades to hold the line at the critical moment. Confederate defeat was largely due to the interception by McClellan of a Special Order from Lee to his generals, revealing the movements of his widely separated divisions. Some have claimed that D.H. Hill received two copies of this order, of which one went astray. But Hill said he only received one copy.Sears, Stephen W., Landscape Turned Red: The Battle of Antietam, 1983 (1985 Popular Library edition), .pp. 100–101, 126 Hill's division was largely unengaged at the Battle of Fredericksburg. At this point, conflicts with Lee began to surface. On the reorganization of the Army of Northern Virginia after Stonewall Jackson's death, Hill was not appointed to a corps command. He already had been detached from Lee's Army and sent to his home state to recruit troops. During the Gettysburg Campaign he led Confederate reserve troops protecting Richmond, and successfully resisted a half-hearted advance by Union forces under John A. Dix and Erasmus Keyes in late June. In 1863, he was sent to Gen. Braxton Bragg's newly reorganized Army of Tennessee, with a provisional promotion to lieutenant general, to command one of its corps. Hill had served under Bragg in Mexico and was initially pleased to be reunited with an old friend, but the warm feelings did not last long. In the bloody and confused victory at Chickamauga, Hill's forces saw some of the heaviest fighting. Afterward, Hill joined several other generals openly condemning Bragg's failure to exploit the victory. President Jefferson Davis came to personally resolve this dispute, in Bragg's favor, and to the detriment of those unhappy generals. The Army of Tennessee was reorganized again, and Hill was left without a command. Davis then refused to confirm Hill's promotion, effectively demoting him back to major general. Because of this, Hill saw less fighting throughout the remainder of the war. After that, D.H. Hill commanded as a volunteer in smaller actions away from the major armies. Hill participated in the Battle of Bentonville in North Carolina, the last fight of the Army of Tennessee. Hill was a division commander when he, along with Gen. Joseph E. Johnston, surrendered on April 26, 1865. ==Postbellum career== From 1866 to 1869, Hill edited a magazine, The Land We Love, at Charlotte, North Carolina, which dealt with social and historical subjects, and had a great influence in the South. In 1877, he became one of the first presidents of the University of Arkansas, a post that he held until 1884, and, in 1885, president of the Military and Agricultural College of Milledgeville, Georgia until August 1889, when he resigned due to failing health. General Hill died at Charlotte the following month, and was buried in Davidson College Cemetery.Bridges, Lee's Maverick General, pp. 277–279Owen and Owen, Generals at Rest, p. 176. ==In memoriam== The main library at North Carolina State University is named after Daniel Harvey Hill Jr. (1859–1924), the son of Gen.

It was originally intended to be a high-end Unix workstation, however Atari took two years to release a port of Unix SVR4 for the TT, which prevented the TT from ever being seriously considered in its intended market. In 1992, the TT was replaced by the Atari Falcon, a low-cost consumer-oriented machine with greatly improved graphics and sound capability, but with a slower and severely bottle-necked CPU. The Falcon possessed only a fraction of the TT's raw CPU performance. Though well priced for a workstation machine, the TT's high cost kept it mostly out of reach of the existing Atari ST market until after the TT was discontinued and sold at discount. The nascent open source movement eventually filled the void. Thanks to open hardware documentation, the Atari TT, along with the Amiga and Atari Falcon, were the first non-Intel machines to have Linux ported to them, though this work did not stabilize until after the TT had already been discontinued by Atari. By 1995 NetBSD had also been ported to the Atari TT. ==History== Atari Corporation realized that to remain competitive as a computer manufacturer, they needed to begin taking steps to exploit the power offered by more advanced processors in the Motorola 68000 series. At that time, the highest performance member was the 68020. It was the first true \\"thirty-two bit bus/thirty-two bit instruction\\" chip from Motorola. Unlike the 68000 used in the original STs, the 68020 was capable of fetching a 32-bit value in one memory cycle, while the older STs took two. The TT was initially designed around the 68020 CPU, however as the project progressed, Atari Corp. realized that the 68020 was not the best option for the TT. The 68020 still lacked certain important features offered by the next successor in the 68000 line, the new 68030. The new 68030 featured a full 32-bit address/data bus and internal registers; separate Supervisor, User, Program, and Data virtual memory spaces; built-in memory-management hardware; and 256-byte on-chip instruction and data caches. When the decision was made to switch from a 68020 to a 68030 CPU, it presented a whole new set of problems. The original specifications for the TT's clock speed was 16 MHz, which was selected to maintain backward compatibility. The existing ST chips used in the TT (DMA and video chips for example) could not handle anything over 16 MHz. Some software also had problems running at faster speeds. To make the system work with a 32 MHz 68030, Atari Corp. had to scale back their plans somewhat, and add a large amount of cache to the system. As a result, the processor runs at 32 MHz, while the system bus runs at 16 MHz. This is similar to the tactic employed by Apple with the ill-fated Macintosh IIvx and later employed by makers of PCs with an Intel 80486DX2 CPU which ran at double that of the system bus speed. TOS 3.01 was the operating system that came with the Atari TT. It was a 512 kB ROM specifically designed for the TT. However, it did not feature pre-emptive multitasking. Another variant, known as TT/X, used Unix System V R4 and WISH (motif extension). The TT030 was first introduced at CeBIT in Hannover, GermanyThe Power of a Workstation , The New Atari TT Computer, August 1989, Atari CorporationSub: The Atari TT: 68030 , Atari has announced its new TT 68030 based Computer at COMDEX and Hannover in recent months., Topic 35, Sat June 10, 1989, R.MOYER1, Atari Roundtables (BBS)on GEnieThe Future of Atari Computing:TT and STE Unveiled in Germany, By Andrew Reese, Start Editor, Start Vol. 4 No. 5 / December 1989 / p. 14 and launched in 1990. It retailed for $2995 with 2 MB RAM and a 50 MB hard drive. The US release came the following year. In 1993, Atari Corp.'s exit from the computer business marked the end of the TT. A number of TT machines were built as developer systems for Jaguar. ==Details== The TT featured a number of devices that had previously been unavailable for Atari Corp. systems. For example, an AppleTalk network port (there never was a driver for it, possibly due to license problems), VME expansion bus, new VGA video graphics modes, and a true SCSI port. Existing ST features such as MIDI ports, a cartridge port, and the ASCI/DMA port were retained in this system. One device that was left out was the BLiTTER graphics chip, which first appeared in the Atari Mega ST systems four to five years earlier. Using the existing 8mhz chip would have only served to bottleneck the TT's performance. To be useful, a new 32mhz blitter chip would have had to have been designed for the TT, however Atari chose not to do so. An Atari Corp. version of Unix System V was not released until mid-1992. By the end of that year, Atari Corp. dropped all Unix development. A special version of the TT, the TT/X, was supplied with UNIX System V R4 and WISH (an extension of OSF Motif), as well as a collection of free software utilities including GCC. In the boot screen for \\"Atari System V\\", as the manual called it, the operating system's kernel identified itself as \\"UniSoft UNIX (R) System V Release 4.0. == Technical specifications == All TTs were made up of both custom and commercial chips: *Custom chips **TT Shifter \\"TT Video shift register chip\\" -- Enabled bitmap graphics.

The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented puppeteer can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh. Shadow play is popular in various cultures, among both children and adults in many countries around the world. More than 20 countries are known to have shadow show troupes. Shadow play is an old tradition and it has a long history in Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia. It has been an ancient art and a living folk tradition in China, India, Iran and Nepal. It is also known in Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Greece, Germany, France and the United States. ==History== Shadow play probably developed from \\"par\\" shows with narrative scenes painted on a large cloth and the story further related through song. As the shows were mostly performed at night the par was illuminated with an oil lamp or candles. Shadow puppet theatre likely originated in Central Asia-China or in India in the 1st millennium BCE.Fan Pen Chen (2003), Shadow Theaters of the World, Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 62, No. 1 (2003), pp. 25-64 By at least around 200 BCE the figures on cloth seem to have been replaced with puppetry in Indian tholu bommalata shows. These are performed behind a thin screen with flat, jointed puppets made of colorfully painted transparent leather. The puppets are held close to the screen and lit from behind, while hands and arms are manipulated with attached canes and lower legs swinging freely from the knee. The evidence of shadow puppet theatre is found in both ancient Chinese and Indian texts. The most significant historical centers of shadow play theatre have been China, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. According to Martin Banham, there is little mention of indigenous theatrical activity in the Middle East between the 3rd century CE and the 13th century, including the centuries that followed the Islamic conquest of the region. The shadow puppet play, states Banham, probably came into vogue in the Middle East after the Mongol invasions and thereafter it incorporated local innovations by the 16th century. Little mention of shadow play is found in Islamic literature of Iran, but much is found in Turkish and 19th-century Ottoman Empire-influenced territories. While shadow play theatre is an Asian invention, hand puppets have a long history in Europe. As European merchant ships sailed in the search of sea routes to India and China, they helped diffuse popular entertainment arts and cultural practices into Europe. Shadow theatre became popular in France, Italy, Britain and Germany by the 17th century. In France, shadow play was advertised as ombres chinoises, while elsewhere they were called \\"magic lantern\\". Goethe helped build a shadow play theatre in Tiefurt in 1781. ===Prelude to cinematography=== According to Stephen Herbert, the popular shadow theatre evolved nonlinearly into projected slides and ultimately into cinematography. The common principle in these innovations were the creative use of light, images and a projection screen. According to Olive Cook, there are many parallels in the development of shadow play and modern cinema, such as their use of music, voice, attempts to introduce colors and mass popularity.Olive Cook (1963), Movement in Two Dimensions, Hutchinson, pages 47-58 ==India== Hanuman and Ravana in tholu bommalata, the shadow puppet tradition of Andhra Pradesh, India Shadow puppets are an ancient part of India's culture, particularly regionally as the keelu bomme and tholu bommalata of Andhra Pradesh, the togalu gombeyaata in Karnataka, the charma bahuli natya in Maharashtra, the ravanachhaya in Odisha, the tholpava koothu in Kerala and the thol bommalatta in Tamil Nadu. Shadow puppet play is also found in pictorial traditions in India, such as temple mural painting, loose- leaf folio paintings, and the narrative paintings.Lopes, Rui Oliveira. (2016) \\"A new light on the shadows of heavenly bodies. Indian shadow puppets: from still paintings to motion pictures\\". Religion and the Arts, vol. 20, no. 1-2, pp. 160-196. DOI: 10.1163/15685292-02001008 Dance forms such as the Chhau of Odisha literally mean \\"shadow\\". The shadow theatre dance drama theatre are usually performed on platform stages attached to Hindu temples, and in some regions these are called Koothu Madams or Koothambalams. In many regions, the puppet drama play is performed by itinerant artist families on temporary stages during major temple festivals. Legends from the Hindu epics Ramayana and the Mahabharata dominate their repertoire. However, the details and the stories vary regionally.Stuart Blackburn (1998), Looking Across the Contextual Divide: Studying Performance in South India, South Asia Research, Volume 18, Issue 1, pages 1-11, Quote: \\"If performance is the cultural organisation of behaviour, it is interesting that these cultural forms vary so widely from area to area. To return to south India, tales are told and songs sung throughout the region, but the same is not true for long narrative singing (epic and the like), or for dance, or for drama; even masks, so widespread in Kerala and other parts of south India, are not significant in Tamil culture.\\" During the 19th century and early parts of the 20th century of the colonial era, Indologists believed that shadow puppet plays had become extinct in India, though mentioned in its ancient Sanskrit texts. In the 1930s and thereafter, states Stuart Blackburn, these fears of its extinction were found to be false as evidence emerged that shadow puppetry had remained a vigorous rural tradition in central Kerala mountains, most of Karnataka, northern Andhra Pradesh, parts of Tamil Nadu, Odisha and southern Maharashtra. The Marathi people, particularly of low caste, had preserved and vigorously performed the legends of Hindu epics as a folk tradition. The importance of Marathi artists is evidenced, states Blackburn, from the puppeteers speaking Marathi as their mother tongue in many non-Marathi speaking states of India. According to Beth Osnes, the tholu bommalata shadow puppet theatre dates back to the 3rd century BCE, and has attracted patronage ever since. The puppets used in a tholu bommalata performance, states Phyllis Dircks, are \\"translucent, lusciously multicolored leather figures four to five feet tall, and feature one or two articulated arms\\". The process of making the puppets is an elaborate ritual, where the artist families in India pray, go into seclusion, produce the required art work, then celebrate the \\"metaphorical birth of a puppet\\" with flowers and incense. The tholu pava koothu of Kerala uses leather puppets whose images are projected on a backlit screen. The shadows are used to creatively express characters and stories in the Ramayana. A complete performance of the epic can take forty-one nights, while an abridged performance lasts as few as seven days. One feature of the tholu pava koothu show is that it is a team performance of puppeteers, while other shadow plays such as the wayang of Indonesia are performed by a single puppeteer for the same Ramayana story. There are regional differences within India in the puppet arts. For example, women play a major role in shadow play theatre in most parts of India, except in Kerala and Maharashtra. Almost everywhere, except Odisha, the puppets are made from tanned deer skin, painted and articulated. Translucent leather puppets are typical in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, while opaque puppets are typical in Kerala and Odisha. The artist troupes typically carry over a hundred puppets for their performance in rural India. ==Indonesia== Wayang kulit shadowplay performance in Semarang, Central Java Shadow puppet theatre is called wayang in Indonesia, wherein a dramatic story is told through shadows thrown by puppets and sometimes combined with human characters. The art form celebrates Indonesian culture and artistic talent; its origins are traced to the medieval-era spread of Hinduism and the arrival of tholu bommalata (leather-based puppet arts) from southern India.Wayang: Indonesian Theatre, Encyclopaedia Britannica (2012) Around 860 CE an Old Javanese charter issued by Maharaja Sri Lokapala mentions three sorts of performers: atapukan, aringgit, and abanol. Ringgit is described in an 11th-century Javanese poem as a leather shadow figure. Wayang kulit, a style of wayang shadow play, is particularly popular in Java and Bali. The term derived from the word wayang literally means \\"shadow\\" or \\"imagination\\" in Javanese; it also connotes \\"spirit\\". The word kulit means \\"skin\\", as the material from which the puppet is made is thin perforated leather sheets made from buffalo skin. Performances of shadow puppet theater in Bali are typically at night, lasting until dawn. The complete wayang kulit troupes include dalang (puppet master), nayaga (gamelan players), and sinden (female choral singer). Some of the nayaga also perform as male choral singers. The dalang (puppet master) performs the wayang behind the cotton screen illuminated by oil lamp or modern halogen lamp, creating visual effects similar to animation. The flat puppet has moveable joints that are animated by hand, using rods connected to the puppet. The handle of the rod is made of carved buffalo horn. On November 7, 2003, UNESCO designated wayang kulit from Indonesia as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. ==Cambodia== Cambodian shadow puppet depicting Sita In Cambodia, the shadow play is called Nang Sbek Thom, or simply as Sbek Thom (literally \\"large leather hide\\"), Sbek Touch (\\"small leather hide\\") and Sbek Por (\\"colored leather hide\\"). It is performed during sacred temple ceremonies, at private functions, and for the public in Cambodia's villages. The popular plays include the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics, as well as other Hindu myth and legends. The performance is accompanied by a pinpeat orchestra. The Sbek Thom is based on the Cambodian version of the Indian epic Ramayana, an epic story about good and evil involving Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, Hanuman and Ravana. It is a sacred performance, embodying Khmer beliefs built on the foundations and mythologies of Brahmanism and Buddhism. Cambodian shadow puppets are made of cow hide, and their size are usually quite large, depicting a whole scene, including its background. Unlike their Javanese counterparts, Cambodian shadow puppets are usually not articulated, rendering the figure's hands unmovable, and are left uncolored, retaining the original color of the leather. The main shadow puppet production center is Roluos near Siem Reap. Cambodian shadow puppetry is one of the cultural performances staged for tourists alongside Cambodian traditional dances. The Sbek Thom figures are unlike puppets because they are large and heavy, with no moveable parts. The Sbek Touch, in contrast, are much smaller puppets with movable parts; their shows have been more popular. The Sbek Thom shadow play involves many puppeteers dancing on the screen, each puppeteer playing one character of the Ramayana, while separate narrators recite the story accompanied by an orchestra. ==Thailand== Thai shadow play puppet and puppeteer Shadow theatre in Thailand is called nang yai; in the south there is a tradition called nang talung. Nang yai puppets are normally made of cowhide and rattan. Performances are normally accompanied by a combination of songs and chants. Performances in Thailand were temporarily suspended in 1960 due to a fire at the national theatre. Nang drama has influenced modern Thai cinema, including filmmakers like Cherd Songsri and Payut Ngaokrachang.Nang Yai from Mahidol University. ==Malaysia== Rama in Malaysian shadow play In Malaysia, shadow puppet plays are also known as wayang kulit. In Malay, wayang means \\"theater\\", while kulit means \\"skin/leather\\" and refers to the puppets that are made out of leather. Stories presented are usually mythical and morality tales. There is an educational moral to the plays, which usually portray a battle. Malay shadow plays are sometimes considered one of the earliest examples of animation. The wayang kulit in the northern states of Malaysia such as Kelantan is influenced by and similar to Thai shadow puppets, while the wayang kulit in the southern Malay peninsula, especially in Johor, is borrowed from Javanese Indonesian wayang kulit with slightly differences in the story and performance. The puppets are made primarily of leather and manipulated with sticks or buffalo horn handles. Shadows are cast using an oil lamp or, in modern times, a halogen light, onto a cotton cloth background. They are often associated with gamelan music. ==China== ===Chinese mainland=== This Chinese shadow puppet is illustrative of the ornate detail that goes into the figures. From the collection of The Children's Museum of Indianapolis. There are several myths and legends about the origins of shadow puppetry in China. The most famous one has it that Chinese shadow puppetry originated when the favorite concubine of Emperor Wu of Han (156 BCE – 87 BCE) died and magician Shao-weng promised to raise her spirit. The emperor could see a shadow that looked like her move behind the curtains that the magician had placed around some lit torches. It is often told that the magician used a shadow puppet, but the original text in Book of Han gives no reason to believe in a relation to shadow puppetry. Although there are many earlier records of all kinds of puppetry in China, clear mention of Chinese shadow play does not occur until the Northern Song dynasty (960–1127). A 1235 book mentions that the puppets were initially cut out of paper, but later made of colored leather or parchment. The stories were mostly based on history and half fact half fiction, but comedies were also performed. Shadow theatre became quite popular as early as the Song dynasty, when holidays were marked by the presentation of many shadow plays. During the Ming dynasty there were 40 to 50 shadow show troupes in the city of Beijing alone. The earliest shadow theatre screens were made of mulberry paper. The storytellers generally used the art to tell events between various war kingdoms or stories of Buddhist sources.Ewart, Franzeska G. [1998] (1998). Let the Shadows speak: developing children's language through shadow puppetry. Today, puppets made of leather and moved on sticks are used to tell dramatic versions of traditional fairy tales and myths. In Gansu province, it is accompanied by Daoqing music, while in Jilin, accompanying Huanglong music forms some of the basis of modern opera.Chinavista. \\"Chinavista.com.\\" The Shadow show. Retrieved on 2007-05-26. Chinese shadow puppetry is shown in the 1994 Zhang Yimou film To Live. ===Taiwan Ping=== The origins of Taiwan's shadow puppetry can be traced to the Chaochow school of shadow puppet theatre. Commonly known as leather monkey shows or leather shows, the shadow plays were popular in Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung as early as the Qing dynasty (1644-1911 A.D.). Older puppeteers estimate that there were at least a hundred shadow puppet troupes in southern Taiwan in the closing years of the Qing. Traditionally, the eight to twelve-inch puppet figures, and the stage scenery and props such as furniture, natural scenery, pagodas, halls, and plants, are all cut from leather. As shadow puppetry is based on light penetrating through a translucent sheet of cloth, the \\"shadows\\" are actually silhouettes seen by the audience in profile or face on. Taiwan's shadow plays are accompanied by Chaochow melodies which are often called \\"priest's melodies\\" owing to their similarity with the music used by Taoist priests at funerals. A large repertoire of some 300 scripts of the southern school of drama used in shadow puppetry and dating back to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries has been preserved in Taiwan and is considered to be a priceless cultural asset. ===Terminology=== A number of terms are used to describe the different forms. * 皮影戏, píyĭngxì is a shadow theatre that uses leather puppets. The figures are usually moved behind a thin screen. It is not entirely a show of shadows, as the shadow is more of a silhouette. This gives the figures some color on the screen; they are not 100% black and white. * 纸影戏, zhĭyĭngxì is paper shadow theatre. * 中国影戏, Zhōngguó yĭngxì is Chinese shadow theatre. ==Turkey== Shadow play Karagöz puppets from Turkey A more bawdy comedy tradition of shadow play was widespread throughout the Ottoman Empire, possibly since the late 14th century. It was centered around the contrasting interaction between the figures Karagöz and Hacivat: an unprincipled peasant and his fussy, educated companion. Together with other characters they represented all the major social groups in Ottoman culture.Emin Şenyer: Karagoz Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre It was usually performed by a single puppet master, who voiced up to dozens of characters, and could be assisted by an apprentice handing him the puppets. The show could be introduced by a singer, accompanied by a tambourine player. Its origins are obscure, though probably deriving from an Asian source. Karagöz theatre puppets have jointed limbs and are made from camel or buffalo hide. The hide is made transparent and colored, resulting in colorful projections. Puppets are typically 35–40 centimeters in height.Ersin Alok, \\"Karagöz-Hacivat: The Turkish Shadow Play\\", Skylife - Şubat (Turkish Airlines inflight magazine), February 1996, p. 66–69. During the 19th century these characters were adapted to the Greek language and culture, Karagöz and Hacivat becoming Karagiozis and Hadjiavatis, with each of the characters assuming stereotypically Greek personalities. This tradition thrived throughout Greece after independence as popular entertainment for a largely adult audience, particularly before competition arose from television. The stories did, however, retain the period setting in the late years of the Ottoman Empire. Karagiozis theatre has undergone some revival in recent years, with the intended audience tending to be largely juvenile. Karagöz theatre was also adapted in Egypt and North Africa.David Robinson in Light and Movement\\", Chapter 1, 1995 ==Europe== Shadow plays spread throughout Europe via Italy at the end of the 17th century. It is known that several Italian showmen performed in Germany, France and England during this period. In 1675 German polymath and philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz imagined a kind of world exhibition that would show all kinds of new inventions and spectacles. In a handwritten document he supposed it should include shadow theatre. French missionaries brought the shadow show from China to France in 1767 and put on performances in Paris and Marseilles, causing quite a stir. In time, the ombres chinoises (French for \\"Chinese shadows\\") with local modification and embellishment, became the ombres françaises and struck root in the country. The popularity of ombres chinoises reflected the chinoiserie fashion of the days. French showman François Dominique Séraphin first presented his shadow spectacle in a hôtel particulier in Versailles in 1771. He would go on to perform at the Palace of Versailles in front of royalty. In 1784 Séraphin moved to Paris, performing his shows at his permanent theatre in the newly opened Palais-Royal from 8 September 1784. The performances would adapt to the political changes and survived the French Revolution. Séraphin developed the use of clockwork mechanisms to automate the show. His nephew took over the show after Séraphin's death in 1800 and it was continued by his heirs until the theatre closed in 1870. In 1775, Ambrogio (also known as Ambroise and Ambrose) staged ambitious shows in Paris and London. Stagehands moving zinc figures behind the screen of the Théatre d'Ombres in Le Chat Noir The art was a popular entertainment in Paris during the 19th century, especially in the famous Paris nightclub district of Montmartre. The cabaret Le Chat noir (\\"The Black Cat\\") produced 45 Théatre d'ombres shows between 1885 and 1896 under the management of Rodolphe Salis. Behind a screen on the second floor of the establishment, the artist Henri Rivière worked with up to 20 assistants in a large, oxy-hydrogen back-lit performance area and used a double optical lantern to project backgrounds. Figures were originally cardboard cut-outs, but were replaced with zinc figures since 1887. Various artists took part in the creation, including Steinlen, Adolphe Willette and Albert Robida. Caran d'Ache designed circa 50 cut-outs for the very popular 1888 show L'Epopée. Musée d'Orsay has circa 40 original zinc figures in its collection. Other cabarets would produce their own versions; the ombres evolved into numerous theatrical productions and had a major influence on phantasmagoria.The Spirit of Montmartre: Cabarets, Humour and the Avant-Garde, 1875-1905. edited by Phillip Dennis Cate and Mary Shaw (1996) , excerpted on line as Henri Riviere: Le Chat noir and 'Shadow Theatre', Australian Centre for the Moving Image Part of the collection of the Museo del Precinema, Padua, Italy In Italy, the Museum of Precinema collezione Minici Zotti in Padua houses a collection of 70 French shadow puppets, similar to those used in the cabaret Le Chat Noir, together with an original theatre and painted backdrops, as well as two magic lanterns for projecting scenes. So far, the shadow plays identified are La Marche a l'étoile (introduced by Henri Rivière), Le Sphinx (introduced by Amédée Vignola), L'Âge d'or and Le Carneval de Venise, and it is supposed that the shadow puppets were created for a tour in France or abroad at the end of the 19th century. Nowadays, several theatre companies in France are developing the practice of shadow puppets: Le Théâtre des Ombres, Le Théâtre du Petit Miroir, Le Théâtre Les Chaises, and La Loupiote. ==Australia== Richard Bradshaw is an Australian shadow puppeteer known for his characters like \\"Super Kangaroo\\".Logan, D, Puppetry, p.13 Bradshaw's puppetry has been featured in television programs made by Jim Henson. The Shadow Theatre of AnaphoriaThe Shadow Theatre of Anaphoria (relocated to Australia from California) combines a mixture of reconstructed and original puppets with multiple sources of lights. The company is under the direction of Kraig Grady. Australian company Shadowplay Studios' debut game Projection: First Light was inspired by shadow puppetry and its art style replicates the traditional shadow play canvas using black props and sepia backgrounds. They visited Richard Bradshaw to gain more insight into shadow puppetry, to make their game more authentic and to get references for the game's shadow puppet characters. ==Shadow puppetry today== thumb In the 1910s the German animator Lotte Reiniger pioneered silhouette animation as a format, whereby shadow-play-like puppets are filmed frame-by-frame. This technique has been kept alive by subsequent animators and is still practised today, though cel animation and computer animation has also been used to imitate the look of shadow play and silhouette animation. Traditional Chinese shadow puppetry was brought to audiences in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s through the efforts of Pauline Benton. Contemporary artists such as Annie Katsura Rollins have perpetuated the medium, sometimes combining the form with Western theatre. Shadow theatre is still popular in many parts of Asia. Prahlad Acharya is one famous Indian magician who incorporates it into his performances. In the 2010s, performer Tom McDonagh introduced 3-D shadow puppets and the use of laser-cut objects. It also appears occasionally in western popular culture, for example in: *The Broadway musical The Lion King *The children's television show Bear in the Big Blue House *The 1983 film The Year of Living Dangerously, opens with a scene from an Indonesian wayang shadow play. *The 2004 video game Sudeki opens with a shadow puppet play setting the stage for the game. *The Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, Georgia has an extensive variety of Chinese shadow puppets in their Asian collection. *The 2010 film The Karate Kid * The Disney Channel show What a Life features shadow puppetry from Sunny Seki. ==Gallery== File:WayangKulit Scene Zoom.JPGIndonesian Wayang kulit as seen by the audience File:Wayang Bali.jpgWayang kulit puppet in Bali, Indonesia File:Yudistira-kl.jpgKing Yudistira (a.k.a.

He was inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2014. ==Early life and ancestry== Joseph Walter Jackson was born to Samuel Joseph Jackson (April 4, 1893 – October 31, 1993),https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/197645952/samuel-joseph-jackson a schoolteacher and Crystal Lee King (May 1907 – November 4, 1992) in Holly Grove, Arkansas on July 26, 1928. However, according to the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame and Katherine Jackson's book My Family, The Jacksons, his year of birth was 1929. He was the eldest of five children. His great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a US Army scout; family lore held that he was also \\"a Native American medicine man\\". Jackson recalled from his early childhood that his father was domineering and strict, and he described himself in his memoir The Jacksons as a \\"lonely child that had only few friends\\". After his parents separated when he was twelve, his mother, two brothers, and sister moved to East Chicago, Indiana, a suburb outside Chicago in Northwest Indiana, while he moved with his father to Oakland, California. When he was 18, his father remarried, and he moved to East Chicago to live with his mother, two brothers, and sister. He soon got a job in East Chicago at Inland Steel Company, but did not finish high school. While in East Chicago, he began to pursue his dreams of becoming a boxer and found success with the Golden Gloves program. While he was preparing for a professional boxing career, he met 17-year-old Katherine Scruse, who also lived in East Chicago and attended Washington High School. Joe was married to another woman, but was divorced in less than a year before he started dating Katherine. Joseph and Katherine were married on November 5, 1949, and in January 1950, they purchased a small two-bedroom home on 2300 Jackson Street near East Chicago in Gary, Indiana. Their first child, Maureen Reillette \\"Rebbie\\" Jackson, was born four months later on May 29, 1950 in the Jackson house. Still employed at Inland Steel, Jackson left his hopes of becoming a professional boxer in order to support his family, and began working there as a full-time crane operator. He later took a second part-time job at American Foundries in East Chicago. In the meantime, his wife Katherine tended to their growing family. During the late 1950s, she began working part- time at Sears in Gary. Joseph and Katherine went on to have ten children, as their son Brandon Jackson died just after he was born. During the early 1950s, Jackson briefly performed with his own blues band The Falcons, playing guitar. Despite their efforts, The Falcons did not get a recording deal and subsequently broke up after one of their members, Thornton \\"Pookie\\" Hudson, founded his own band in 1952. That band would go on to become a successful doo-wop group named The Spaniels. ==The Jackson 5== Joe Jackson began working with his sons' musical group in the early 1960s, first working with his three eldest sons Jackie, Tito and Jermaine. Younger sons Marlon and Michael eventually joined the backing band. Joseph began enforcing long and intense rehearsals for his sons. At first, the group went under The Jackson Brothers. Following the inclusions of Marlon and Michael in the group and Michael's increased vocal presence within the group, their name was changed to The Jackson 5. After a couple of years performing in talent contests and high school functions, Joseph booked them in more and more respectable venues until they landed a spot at the renowned Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York City. On November 21, 1967, The Jackson 5 were signed by Jackson to their first professional contract with Gordon Keith, owner and first president of Steeltown Records in Gary, Indiana. The group's first single \\"Big Boy,\\" with Michael as the lead singer, was released by Keith on January 31, 1968 on the Steeltown label. \\"Big Boy\\" became a local hit and the brothers became local celebrities after it was played on radio stations in the Chicago-Gary area. Within the year, Jackson helped to land his sons an audition for Motown Records in Detroit. The Jackson 5 were signed with Motown in March 1969. Jackson later moved his family to California and supervised every recording session the group made for Motown. The group began to receive nationwide fame after their first single for Motown, \\"I Want You Back\\", hit #1 following its release on October 7, 1969, followed by their first album, Diana Ross Presents The Jackson 5, in December 1969. After the Jackson 5's first four singles, \\"I Want You Back\\" (The Jackson 5, 1969), \\"ABC\\" (The Jackson 5, 1970), \\"The Love You Save\\" (The Jackson 5, 1970), and \\"I'll Be There\\" (The Jackson 5, 1970) sold 10 million copies in 10 months, setting a world record for sales, it became clear to Jackson that his dream to make his sons the first African- American teenagers to become internationally known recording stars had come true. In 1973, wanting to reassert his control, Jackson had his family, including youngest son Randy and daughters Rebbie, La Toya and Janet, perform at casinos and resorts in Las Vegas, inspired by the success of fellow family act The Osmonds. Joseph had also formed his own record label 'Ivory Tower International Records' and signed artists under his management in which they toured internationally with The Jackson 5 as opening acts in 1974. In 1975, the Jackson 5, with the exception of Jermaine, left Motown and signed a lucrative deal with Epic Records. Michael had brokered a deal where they could eventually produce their own songs, leading to Motown retaining the Jackson 5 name, so they renamed themselves The Jacksons in 1976. In 1978, Joseph's youngest son Randy released his solo single \\"How Can I Be Sure\\" on Joseph's record label. In 1982, Joseph established Janet Jackson's career at age 16 as a recording artist while managing her. He financed the recording of his daughter's first demo then, arranged her a recording contract with A&M; Records and began recording her debut album, overseen by him. == Marriage == Joseph was alleged to have a lasting extramarital affair. Katherine filed for divorce on March 9, 1973 with a Los Angeles County clerk, but she decided to drop the divorce papers. The following year, Joseph fathered a child with Cheryl Terrell. Their daughter Joh'Vonnie Jackson was born on August 30, 1974. This led Joseph and Cheryl to a 25-year-long affair while raising Joh'Vonnie. Katherine attempted once again to divorce her husband in 1982, but again was persuaded to drop the action. Joseph then moved to Las Vegas, with Katherine remaining at the Jackson family home Hayvenhurst in Encino, California. Despite living separately, Katherine and Joe remained legally married until his death in 2018. Katherine denied rumors that she and Joseph were estranged. ===Children=== Jackson had eleven children, ten with his wife Katherine Jackson (née Scruse). *Maureen Reillette \\"Rebbie\\" Jackson (b.

When he managed his family, he allegedly ordered each of them to call him \\"Joseph\\", which contributed to several siblings having been estranged from him. Michael claimed that from a young age he was physically and emotionally abused by his father, enduring incessant rehearsals, whippings and name-calling, but also admitting that his father's strict discipline played a large part in his success. Michael first spoke openly about his childhood abuse in a 1993 interview with Oprah Winfrey. He said that during his childhood, he often cried from loneliness.George, Nelson (2004). Michael Jackson: The Ultimate Collection booklet. Sony BMG. pp. 45–46Taraborrelli, p. 620 Michael recalled that Joseph sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as Michael and his siblings rehearsed and that \\"if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you.\\"Taraborrelli, p. 602 Joseph admitted to whipping his children with switches and belts as punishment, but said he did not do so at random, and claimed never to have used any hard object as he felt was implied by the word \\"beating.\\" Despite the abuse allegations, Michael honored his father with an annual \\"Joseph Jackson Day\\" at Neverland RanchMichael Jackson's Private Home Movies and ultimately forgave him, noting that Joseph's deep-South upbringing during the Great Depression and the Jim Crow years, and Joseph having endured the same physical discipline himself as a child, and his working-class adulthood hardened Joseph emotionally and made him push his children to succeed as entertainers.Jackson, Michael. \\"Heal the Kids.\\" Speech at the Oxford Union, March 2001. Both Joe and Katherine have denied the characterization of abuse. Katherine said that the whippings and physical punishments were common back then when Michael and his siblings grew up. Other siblings, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon, have denied that their father was abusive. Joe was played by Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs in the mini-series The Jacksons: An American Dream and by Frederic Tucker in the 2004 VH1 biopic Man in the Mirror: The Michael Jackson Story. ==Later years== Jackson at an event in 2007 In 2011, Jackson was inducted into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame. In 2014, Jackson accepted the award on behalf of his son Michael, when he was inducted into the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame with a Lifetime Achievement Award. The following year he was awarded The Rhythm & Blues 2015 Humanitarian Award. In June 2015, Jackson appeared at the BET Awards 2015 with his daughter Janet as she accepted the Ultimate Icon Award. On July 27, 2015, Jackson was rushed to a hospital after a stroke and heart arrhythmia while celebrating his 87th birthday in Brazil. He was not stable enough to fly out of the country for further treatment until two weeks later. Upon his arrival to Los Angeles on August 11, he was treated at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to correct his blurred vision following the stroke. In January 2017, Jackson's brother Lawrence died. == Death == On June 22, 2018, TMZ reported that Jackson was hospitalized in Las Vegas in the final stages of terminal pancreatic cancer. He died at a hospice in Las Vegas on June 27, two days after the ninth anniversary of his son Michael's death and less than a month before his 90th birthday. He was surrounded by his wife and surviving children. == References == ==External links== * Official website for Joseph Jackson * Profile at German branch of Random House * Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture entry Category:1928 births Category:2018 deaths Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:African-American people Category:American autobiographers Category:American blues guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American music managers Category:African-American record producers Category:American people who self-identify as being of Native American descent Category:Record producers from California Category:American rhythm and blues guitarists Category:American talent agents Category:Burials at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale) Category:Deaths from cancer in Nevada Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:Guitarists from Arkansas Category:Guitarists from Indiana Category:Guitarists from Los Angeles Category:Jackson family (show business) Category:People from Ashley County, Arkansas Category:People from East Chicago, Indiana Category:People from Gary, Indiana Category:People from Los Angeles Category:People from the Las Vegas Valley Category:Stroke survivors Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Joe Jackson (manager)"},{"id":"1442179","text":"Helblindi (Old Norse 'Helblind') is a jötunn in Norse mythology.

E. J. Collins, was an English cricketer and soldier. He held, for 116 years, the record of highest score in cricket: as a 13-year-old schoolboy, he scored 628 not out over four afternoons in June 1899. Collins's record-making innings drew a large crowd and increasing media interest; spectators at the Old Cliftonian match being played nearby were drawn away to watch the junior school house cricket match in which Collins was playing. Despite this achievement, Collins never played first-class cricket. Collins's 628 not out stood as the record score till January 2016 when an Indian boy, Pranav Dhanawade, scored 1009 in a single innings. Collins joined the British Army in 1902 and studied at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, before becoming an officer in the Royal Engineers. He served in France during the First World War, where he was killed in action in 1914 during the First Battle of Ypres. Collins had been mentioned in despatches and also represented the Royal Military Academy at cricket and rugby union. == Early life and education == Collins (left) with R. P. Keigwin at Clifton College, as the school racquets team in 1902 Collins was born in Hazaribagh, India, to Arthur Herbert Collins, a judge in the Indian Civil Service, and Mrs Esther Ida Collins. It had been thought that both of his parents had died by the time he began his education at Clifton College, Bristol, where he held a scholarship. However, the 1901 census shows that Arthur's mother was actually still alive. He joined Clifton College in September 1897,\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. ref no 5327: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April 1948 becoming a member of Clark's House, although he later moved to North Town House. Clifton had an excellent reputation for sport. W.G. Grace scored 13 first-class centuries on the Close (Clifton's first XI ground), and he sent his sons to the school. Collins played half-back for the rugby XV, and was also in the cricket XI. He won a bronze medal for boxing at the public schools tournament in Aldershot in 1901. Tim Rice, in a 9 June 1999 article for The Telegraph to celebrate the centenary of the score, entitled \\"On the seventh day AEJ Collins rested\\", described him thus: == The famous match == In 1899, as a 13-year-old schoolboy, Collins scored what was then the highest ever recorded cricket score of 628 not out.; This feat took place during a junior school house cricket match between Clarke's House and North Town House. Such matches were timeless, played to a finish however long they took. The match was played on an outfield off Guthrie Road, Bristol, now named Collins Piece. The ground had both a poor surface and a very unusual shape: it was very short (only long), with a wall only away forming the boundary on one side, while the other side was a gentle slope falling away towards the school sanatorium in the distance. The pitch occupied the central of the narrow field, with the boundary only behind each set of stumps. Hits to the long boundary, down the slope, had to be all-run, but the three short boundaries only counted for two runs. Plaque at Clifton College, fixed in 1962 The match commenced on Thursday, 22 June, to take advantage of two half-day holidays while the college team played their annual match against Old Cliftonians nearby. Collins, a right-handed batsman, won the toss for Clarke's House and chose to bat first. Collins hit his first stroke at around 3.30 pm. By the close of play at 6 pm, he had scored 200 runs, having been dropped on 50, 100 and 140. School lessons allowed another two-and-a-half hours' play on Friday, 23 June, and by then news of an exceptional innings had gone round the school. So brilliant was his play that even the crowd watching an Old Cliftonian match being played nearby lost its interest and a large crowd watched Collins's phenomenal performance. Collins's innings almost ended at 400 when an easy catch was dropped by the youngest player on the field, 11-year-old Victor Fuller-Eberle, but at around 5.30 pm, after batting for around five hours, rapturous applause broke out when he passed Andrew Stoddart's world-record score of 485. At the end of the second day, he remained unbeaten on 509 and the team on 680 for 8. His innings was reported as a world record in The Times newspaper on Saturday 24 June; the paper, however, gave Collins's score by the close of play on Friday as 501, his age as 14 and mis-reported his name as \\"A. E. G. Collins\\". The match resumed in the lunch hour on Monday, 26 June, at 12:30 pm, with a large crowd. By the end of play, Collins had been dropped again, on 556, to reach 598, but another wicket had fallen, and Collins was running out of partners. On Tuesday, 27 June, the school authorities extended the hours available for play in an attempt to finish the match. The crowds grew and media interest escalated, as The Times again reported on the match on Tuesday, and the disruption to school life was considerable. Collins hit out, with his approach being described as \\"downright reckless\\". He was dropped twice more, on 605 and 619. After just 25 minutes' play, Collins lost his final partner, Thomas Redfern, caught by Victor Fuller-Eberle at point for 13, with Collins's score on 628. Collins had played less than seven hours' cricket, carrying his bat through his side's innings. He had scored 1 six, 4 fives, 31 fours, 33 threes, 146 twos and 87 singles. The Times once again ran a report, giving the final figures for Collins's innings in its Wednesday edition of 28 June—once again, however, they misspelled his third initial. North Town House, demoralised, were bowled out for 87 in 90 minutes on Tuesday. The match resumed on Wednesday 28 June, when North Town's second innings went even worse, making 61 in just over an hour, so Clarke House won by an innings and 688 runs. Collins showed ability as an all-rounder, with his right-arm medium pace bowling taking 11 wickets for 63 runs. The scorebook hangs in the pavilion at Clifton to this day. The scorers faced a difficult task in accurately recording the innings. One of them, Edward Peglar, is said to have remarked that Collins's score was \\"628, plus or minus twenty shall we say\\". The other scorer for the match was J. W. Hall, whose father in 1868 had batted with Edward Tylecote, who later played Test cricket for England and whose name is on a poem kept with the Ashes urn. Tylecote had earlier set a world-record score of 404 not out in 1868, also at Clifton. Hall later wrote that \\"The bowling probably deserved all the lordly contempt with which Collins treated it, sending a considerable number of pulls full pitch over the fives courts into the swimming baths to the danger of the occupants.\\" Collins became public property for a long while after the match, forever associated with his great score. \\"Today all men speak of him\\", wrote one newspaper, \\"… he has a reputation as great as the most advertised soap: he will be immortalised.\\" After leaving school, he never wanted to be reminded of his famous innings; nevertheless, he has been remembered well beyond his own lifetime. Within two years, 31-year-old Australian Test cricketer Charles Eady came close to breaking the record, when he made 566 for Break-o'-Day against Wellington in Hobart in less than eight hours spread over three weeks in March 1902. This remained, for over a century, the closest challenge to Collins's record: his score was finally beaten in January 2016 by Pranav Dhanawade, a 15-year-old Indian boy who scored 1,009 not out from 327 balls for KC Gandhi School against Arya Gurukul School in Mumbai.; Only five other players, Prithvi Shaw (546), Dadabhoy Havewala (515), JC Sharp (505 not out), Malhotra Chamanlal (502 not out), and Brian Lara (501 not out) have ever scored more than 500 runs in one innings in any form of cricket. Lara is the only person to have achieved a score of over 500 runs in first-class cricket. == Military career == Collins chose to follow an army career, passing his entrance exams to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in September 1901 and representing the Royal Military Academy at both football and rugby as well as cricket, scoring a century in a match against the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He joined the British Army the following year, being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 21 December 1904. Despite the limitations on his sport that the military service caused, he played several matches for Old Cliftonians, his regiment, and the army, remaining a free-hitting batsman. He played at Lord's in 1913 for Royal Engineers Cricket Club against Royal Artillery Cricket Club, scoring 58 and 36 runs in the two innings, but he never played first-class cricket. He also joined Clifton Rugby Football Club in February 1905, but never rose above the 2nd XV. He served with the 2nd Sappers and Miners in India, and was promoted to lieutenant on 23 June 1907. Collins married Ethel Slater in the spring of 1914 and was sent to France when the First World War broke out later that year. He was killed in action on 11 November 1914 at the First Battle of Ypres, while serving as a captain with the 5th Field Company, Royal Engineers, at the age of 29. He was signalling for more men to protect the flank of his trench when he was wounded; he was dragged back into the trench by Sapper Farnfield (23900) but he died an hour later. The 5th Field Company carried out the burials of its Company on 12 November. Due to the continual fighting over this area for the next four years what remained of his grave and remains were never found, but his name is recorded at the Menin Gate Memorial in Belgium. Before his death, he had been mentioned in despatches. His younger brother Herbert (a lieutenant in the 24th Battalion of the Manchester Regiment and also an old Cliftonian) was killed in action on 11 February 1917, aged 27. Collins's wife, Ethel, lived as a widow for over fifty years, dying on 1 September 1966 in Haslemere. == See also == * List of cricket terms * History of cricket == Notes == == References == * * == External links == * Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:Royal Engineers officers Category:People educated at Clifton College Category:Graduates of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich Category:British military personnel killed in World War I Category:1885 births Category:1914 deaths Category:People from Hazaribagh Category:English cricketers of 1890 to 1918 Category:Schools cricket Category:Cricketers from Jharkhand ","title":"A.

In England, there are two routes available to gaining a PGCE – either on a traditional university-led teacher training course or school-led teacher training. In addition to gaining the PGCE qualification itself, those who have successfully completed the course in England or Wales are recommended for qualified teacher status (QTS) - the requirement to teach in state maintained schools in England and Wales. Those passing PGCEs in Northern Ireland are granted 'eligibility to teach' in Northern Ireland (equivalent to QTS). Though the QTS/eligibility to teach only applies in the Home Nation it was awarded in, applying for QTS/eligibility to teach in either of the other two Home Nations is a formality, and is nearly always awarded to PGCE holders. Furthermore, the PGCE is also widely recognised in Scotland and the rest of the world, allowing holders to easily register as teachers there. The PGCE was previously also offered in Scotland, but was renamed the Professional Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) from 2005 to 2006 (the exact year depending on the university offering it). It is identical in content to the previous PGCE. Like the PGCE, the PGDE is widely recognised throughout the rest of the United Kingdom and the rest of the world. Applications for admission to PGCE courses are handled by UCAS Teacher Training. Further and higher education lecturers are not usually required to hold QTS/eligibility to teach. However, many lecturers attend training courses to gain qualifications such as the Postgraduate Certificate in Further Education (PGCFE), which is comparable to the regular PGCE. There is also the PGCHE, for university practitioners.For example, see \\"PGCHE: Postgraduate Certificate in Higher Education\\" , University of Nottingham. ==Course content and structure== The PGCE is a professional qualification normally taught at a university or other higher education institution, with much of the course time spent on placements in local schools. A trainee teacher will have to meet the Standards for qualified teacher status and any course specific requirements to be awarded the PGCE. In England only, a trainee teacher also has to pass the professional skills tests before starting a course. The training provider will then recommend the trainee teacher for QTS to the relevant body: *The National College for Teaching and Leadership (England) * General Teaching Council for Wales (Wales) or eligibility to teach to the: * General Teaching Council for Northern Ireland (Northern Ireland) After gaining QTS, the candidate becomes a newly qualified teacher (NQT) and embarks on an induction programme in their first post. ==Equivalence== The Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE/PGCertEd) sits at Level 7 of the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications, while the Professional Certificate in Education (ProfGCE) sits a Level 6. The PGCE is not a postgraduate degree, it is instead an advanced but non-degree qualification (as it is directly related to a career, it is considered vocational). From 2005 to 2007, most universities attached credits towards a master's degree to their PGCertEds. PGCEs that do not carry master's credits are now known as Professional Graduate Certificate in Education. A recent review of the equivalence of qualifications in Scotland declared the PGCertEd to be equivalent to a postgraduate diploma (which in turn is equivalent to the taught element of a master's degree). This left the PGCE with a rather inappropriate name as a postgraduate certificate is a lower level than the postgraduate diploma, requiring only half the amount of work. As a result, the PGCE in Scotland were renamed to Professional Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE). The PGCE in Lifelong Learning or Post-Compulsory Education and Training (PCET) is considered to be equivalent to the Diploma in Teaching in the Lifelong Learning Sector (DTLLS) at QCF Level 7. The DTLLS was also taught at QCF Level 5. According to Education International, equivalency assessments place the PGCE as equivalent to a Masters Level degree in the United States and Canada. Although the program is shorter in delivery time than a typical masters level program, its intensive delivery model (specifically within Wales, offered by University of Wales Trinity Saint David) meets all requirements to confer this type of post-graduate degree in North America. https://www.uwtsd.ac.uk/teacher-education/pgce-application- advice/ ==Fees== For PGCE courses in England, a fee of £9,250 will normally be charged, which can be borrowed (at interest) from Student Finance England. In September 2012, the government introduced a new initiative with the aim of encouraging the best graduates into the teaching profession, particularly in mathematics, physics, computer science, chemistry and modern foreign languages. Training bursaries from September 2012 are based primarily on degree classification. In these subjects, trainees with a degree in the first division are entitled to a bursary of £30,000 in physics, those with a 2.2 or above receive £25,000 for maths, MFL, computing and geography, and those with a first division in chemistry and entitled to £25,000, with a 2:1 or 2:2 the bursary amount is £20,000 (rates for 2017 entry). A second band of subjects, listed as \\"other priority secondary specialisms and primary\\" (English, history, biology, geography, music, design and technology, and primary education) attract a bursary ranging from £3,000 – £15,000. Bursaries are paid each month in instalments, with graduates receiving the £15,000 and £25,000 bursaries also receiving \\"enhanced\\" payments\\" in January and at the end of their course. ==Independent schools== Teachers in independent schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are not required to hold any particular qualifications, although most schools now prefer applicants to have a PGCE, especially younger people going into teaching as a first career. This flexibility does allow them to occasionally hire older people who have practical experience, such as appointing ex-engineers as mathematics or physics teachers, or appointing people with high-level postgraduate qualifications but no formal teacher-training. ==Other qualifications== The PGCE is the main postgraduate route for teacher training in England and Wales, but there are a number of other ways to gain QTS.

They were West Coast counterparts of New York's Bowery Boys, Officially called the San Francisco Society of Regulators, the gang, mostly made up of thugs and criminals as well as former Mexican–American War veterans, would later become known as The Hounds. Controlled by the \\"Know Nothing\\" political party, the gang used patriotism in the aftermath of the Mexican–American War to drive foreigners from the recently discovered gold fields. The Hounds had early popular support despite their brutal tactics, as many of the gang attacked unarmed Mexican and Chilean immigrants in Clarks Point and extorted money from those few who were successful. The Hounds soon began demanding protection money from the city residents, indiscriminately looting and burning stores and killing anyone who resisted. On July 15, 1849 the Hounds attacked a Spanish \\"shantie town,\\" robbing and killing several immigrants. While city officials were previously hesitant to take action against the Hounds, this attack finally turned the public against them. With money collected for the city alcalde, Dr. T.M. Leavenworth along with Sam Brannan, Captain Beezer Simmons, and other citizens demanded the city take action and later 230 men were deputized to arrest the Hounds. However, most of the gang had fled the city by this time, although around 20 members, including a leader of the Hounds, Sam Roberts, were captured by troops led by merchant Isaac Bluxome, Jr.. Roberts and another member called Saunders were sentenced to ten years imprisonment, while the other members were given shorter sentences. However, the influence of \\"Know Nothing\\" politicians was able to overturn these convictions. The public resentment and hostility toward the gang, however, would prevent the Hounds from reorganizing. Most left the city shortly after their release. Some of these moved to the mining camps were they soon met harsher fates at the hands of the miners assemblies.

MHRA was formed in 2003 with the merger of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Medical Devices Agency (MDA). In April 2013, it merged with the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) and was rebranded, with MHRA identity being used solely for the regulatory centre within the group. The Agency employs more than 1,300 people. ==Structure== MHRA is divided into three main centres: * MHRA Regulatory (the regulator for the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries) * Clinical Practice Research Datalink * National Institute for Biological Standards and Control ==History== In 1999, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) took over control of the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) from Office for National Statistics. Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) merged in 2003 to form MHRA. In April 2012, the GPRD was expanded and relaunched as the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). In April 2013, MHRA merged with the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) and was rebranded, with MHRA identity being used for the parent organisation and one of the centres within the group. At the same time CPRD was formally declared a separate centre of MHRA, too. ==Roles== #Operate post-marketing surveillance for reporting, investigating and monitoring of adverse drug reactions to medicines and incidents with medical devices. #Assessment and authorisation of medicinal products for sale and supply in UK. #Oversee the Notified Bodies that ensure medical device manufacturers comply with regulatory requirements before putting devices on the market. #Operate a quality surveillance system to sample and test medicines to address quality defects and to monitor the safety and quality of unlicensed products. #Investigate internet sales and potential counterfeiting of medicines, and prosecute where necessary. #Regulate clinical trials of medicines and medical devices. #Monitor and ensure compliance with statutory obligations relating to medicines and medical devices. #Promote safe use of medicines and devices. #Manage the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and the British Pharmacopoeia. MHRA hosts and supports a number of expert advisory bodies, including the British Pharmacopoeia Commission, and the Commission on Human Medicine which replaced the Committee on the Safety of Medicines in 2005. As part of the European system of approval, MHRA or other national bodies can be the rapporteur or co-rapporteur for any given pharmaceutical application, taking on the bulk of the verification work on behalf of all members, while the documents are still sent to other members as and where requested. ==Funding== MHRA is funded by the Department of Health and Social Care for the regulation of medical devices, whilst the costs of medicines regulation is met through fees from the pharmaceutical industry. This has led to suggestions by some MPs that MHRA is too reliant on industry, and so not fully independent. ==Criticism== MHRA has been criticised by the House of Commons Health Committee for, among other things, lacking transparency, and for inadequately checking drug licensing data. MHRA (and US Food and Drug Administration) have been criticised in the book Bad Pharma, and by David Healy in evidence to the House of Commons Health Committee, for having undergone regulatory capture; advancing the interests of the drug companies rather than the interests of the public. Donald Light at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study summarised as such: > ...the industry has shaped the rules of the regulators, funded their > operations, and lobbied them constantly in a classic pattern of regulatory > capture.... Recent reclassification of CBD oil and other hemp products as a medicine thus effectively banning it has been criticized as cruel and disproportionate to those using it given that it has few if any side effects. ==See also== *Black triangle scheme *European Medicines Agency (EMA) *Food and Drug Administration (FDA) *List of pharmacy organizations in the United Kingdom *Regulation of therapeutic goods *Yellow Card Scheme ==References== ==External links== * *NIBSC homepage *CPRD homepage Category:2003 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Department of Health and Social Care Category:Executive agencies of the United Kingdom government Category:Health in the City of Westminster Category:Pharmacy organisations in the United Kingdom Category:Medical regulation in the United Kingdom Category:National agencies for drug regulation Category:Organisations based in the City of Westminster Category:Organizations established in 2003 Category:Regulators of biotechnology products Category:Regulators of the United Kingdom ","title":"Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency"},{"id":"1442208","text":"The Postgraduate Diploma in Education (PGDE), also known as a Graduate Diploma of Education (GradDipEd), is a one-year postgraduate course in several countries including Australia, Ghana, New Zealand, Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Hong Kong, Singapore and Zimbabwe for existing bachelor's degree holders leading to become a qualified teacher.

Originally called The Great C major to distinguish it from his Symphony No. 6, the Little C major, the subtitle is now usually taken as a reference to the symphony's majesty. Unusually long for a symphony of its time, a typical performance of The Great lasts an hour when all repeats indicated in the score are taken. The symphony was not professionally performed until a decade after Schubert's death. ==Composition and early reception== Schubert's letter concerning the Symphony No. 9, D. 944 For a long time, the symphony was believed to be a work of Schubert's last year, 1828. It was true that, in the last months of his life, he did start drafting a symphony – but this was the work in D major now accepted as Symphony No. 10, which has been realized for performance by Brian Newbould.Brian Newbould, Schubert and the Symphony, p. 212. Now it is known that the 'Great' was largely composed in sketch in the summer of 1825: that, indeed it was the work to which Schubert was referring in a letter of March 1824 when he said he was preparing himself to write 'a grand symphony' (originally listed as Gmunden-Gastein symphony, D 849 in the Deutsch Catalogue). By the spring or summer of 1826 it was completely scored, and in October, Schubert, who was quite unable to pay for a performance, sent it to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde with a dedication. In response they made him a small payment, arranged for the copying of the orchestral parts, and at some point in the latter half of 1827 gave the work an unofficial perfunctory play- through (the exact date and the conductor are unknown) – though it was set aside as too long and difficult for the amateur orchestra of the conservatory.Newbould, p. 214. A recent hypothesis suggests that the symphony may have received its first performance on 12 March 1829 in a Concert spirituel at the Landständischer Saal in Vienna.Otto Biba, \\"Die Uraufführung von Schuberts Großer C-Dur-Symphonie – 1829 in Wien. Ein glücklicher Aktenfund zum Schubert-Jahr\\", Musikblätter der Wiener Philharmoniker 51 (Vienna, 1997) p. 290. The evidence for this hypothesis is slender, however, and it contradicts contemporary sources which prove that Schubert's Symphony No. 6 (also in C major) was performed at this instance.Werner Aderhold (ed.): Preface. In: Sinfonie Nr. 8 in C. Neue Schubert-Ausgabe, Serie V, Band 4a. Bärenreiter, Kassel 2003 (BA 5554), ISMN M-006-49713-3. In 1836 Schubert's brother Ferdinand attempted to perform the final movement alone, yet there is no evidence that a public performance ever took place. In 1838, ten years after Schubert's death, Robert Schumann visited Vienna and was shown the manuscript of the symphony at the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde by Ferdinand Schubert. He took a copy that Ferdinand had given him back to Leipzig, where the entire work was performed publicly for the first time by Felix Mendelssohn at the Leipzig Gewandhaus on 21 March 1839. Schumann celebrated the event in the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik with an ecstatic article in which, in a phrase destined to become famous, he hailed the symphony for its 'heavenly length'.Schumann wrote of the \\"heavenly length of the symphony, like a thick novel in four volumes, perhaps by Jean Paul, who also never wanted to end, and for the best of reasons—in order to allow the reader to continue creating for himself... At first, we may feel a little uneasy because of the... charming variety of vital feeling... but in the end a delightful impression remains. We feel that the composer is the master of his tale, and that, in time, its connections will become clear... It would not give us or others any pleasure to analyze the separate movements; for to give an idea of the novelistic character that pervades the entire symphony, one would have to reproduce it whole.\\" (From: Translated in: ) The symphony, however, was found to be very difficult for orchestras of the day because of its extremely lengthy woodwind and string parts. When Mendelssohn took the symphony to Paris in 1842 and London in 1844, orchestras flatly refused to play it; in London, the violinists are reputed to have collapsed in laughter when rehearsing the second subject of the finale.William Mann: Notes from back of LP: \\"Schubert Symphony No. 9 in c major 'The Great',\\" conducted by Otto Klemperer, Philharmonia Orchestra,\\" Angel Records 35946, 1961. ==Numbering== There continues to be long-standing controversy regarding the numbering of this symphony, with some scholars (usually German-speaking) numbering it as Symphony No. 7. The most recent version of the Deutsch catalogue (the standard catalogue of Schubert's works, compiled by Otto Erich Deutsch) lists it as No. 8, while most English-speaking scholars list it as No. 9. ==Form== Following the standard symphonic form, there are four movements: ===I. Andante – Allegro ma non troppo – Più moto=== The first movement begins with an extensive introduction with its own miniaturised exposition, development and recapitulation. The opening theme is used in a modified form as secondary subject matter in the main section of the movement. The rest of the movement is in sonata form with two periods for each theme and several transition themes and extra material. The opening theme of the introduction is restated in the coda (b. 570) before the final cadences. : \\\\relative c' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"french horn\\" \\\\set Staff.midiMinimumVolume = #0.7 \\\\set Staff.midiMaximumVolume = #1.0 \\\\tempo \\"Andante\\" \\\\tempo 4 = 80 \\\\key c \\\\major \\\\time 2/2 c2->\\\\p d4 e4  a,4.-> b8 c2  f4.-> d8 e2  g-> d4 e  a,4.-> b8 c2  d4.-> e8 c2  d2.\\\\pp e4  c1 } ===II. Andante con moto=== The second movement is in a modified sonata form without a development section characterised as P1 S1 P2 S2 (or ABAB). ===III. Scherzo. Allegro vivace; Trio=== The third movement is a lengthy Scherzo and Trio which is structured in sonata form. ===IV. Finale. Allegro vivace=== The finale is in an extended sonata form. There are no less than six unique thematic elements in the main themes alone. The development section focuses on the third and sixth thematic elements. There is an extensive use of ostinato in accompaniment of two of the thematic elements. Midway through this final movement Schubert pays tribute to Beethoven by quoting from the finale of his Ninth Symphony. The recapitulation is unusual in that it begins in E-flat, modulates to F major, and then to the tonic (rather than everything being in the tonic as expected). ==Music== Often considered Schubert's finest piece for orchestra, this symphony is also one of the composer's most innovative pieces. Thematic development in the style of Beethoven is still present in the work, but Schubert puts far more emphasis on melody, which one might expect from the composer of some six hundred lieder. In fact, this new style prompted Robert Schumann to pursue his own symphonic ambitions. ==Instrumentation== The symphony is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets in A and C, 2 bassoons, 2 horns in C, 2 trumpets in A and C, 3 trombones, timpani, and strings. Beethoven had always used the trombone as an effect, and therefore very sparingly, or, in the case of his Ninth Symphony, also to double the alto, tenor, and bass parts of the chorus as was common in sacred music and opera at the time. However, in Schubert's Unfinished Symphony and the Ninth Symphony, the trombones become essential members of the orchestra playing throughout the piece, and even receive important melodic roles. ==See also== *Schubert symphonies ==Notes== ==References== * Brian Newbould, Schubert and the Symphony.

The electoral threshold is currently set at 3.25%, with the number of seats a party receives in the Knesset being proportional to the number of votes it receives.Israel ups threshold ReutersIsraeli electoral system Knesset website The Knesset is elected for a four-year term, although most governments have not served a full term and early elections are a frequent occurrence. Israel has a multi-party system based on coalition governments as no party has ever won a majority of seats in a national election, although the Alignment briefly held a majority following its formation by an alliance of several different parties prior to the 1969 elections. The legal voting age for Israeli citizens is 18. Elections are overseen by the Central Elections Committee, and are held according to the Knesset Elections Law. ==Electoral procedure== Ballot envelope, 2019 Under normal circumstances, Israel's Basic Law requires national elections for the Knesset to take place on a Tuesday in the Jewish month of Cheshvan (early October through mid-November) four years following the previous elections. However, it is possible, and it often happens, that early elections can take place prior to the date set in the basic law.Elections in Israel February 2009 Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs Early elections can be called by a vote of the majority of Knesset members, or by an edict of the President, and normally occur on occasions of political stalemate and of the inability of the government to get the parliament's support for its policies. Failure to get the annual budget bill approved by the Knesset by March 31 (3 months after the start of the fiscal year) also leads automatically to early elections. It is also possible to postpone the date of the election by a special majority of the Knesset members. Israel uses the closed-list method of party-list proportional representation;Israel's political system Council on Foreign Relations thus citizens vote for their preferred party and not for any individual candidates. The 120 seats in the Knesset are then assigned (using the D'Hondt method) proportionally to each party that received votes, provided that the party gained votes which met or exceeded the electoral threshold. Parties are permitted to form electoral alliances so as to gain enough collective votes to meet the threshold (if so, the alliance as a whole must meet the threshold, not the individual parties) and thus be allocated seats. The low threshold makes the Israeli electoral system more favourable to minor parties than systems used in most other countries. Two parties can make an agreement so that both parties' sum of surplus votes are combined, and if the combined surplus votes amount to an extra seat, the extra seat goes to the party with the greater number of surplus votes.The Distribution of Knesset Seats Among the Lists – the Bader- Offer Method, Knesset website Voting begins 12 days before election day for the general public in Israeli diplomatic missions worldwide for Israelis serving abroad in an official capacity and their families, and for Israeli sailors on Israeli ships at sea. Polling stations for serving soldiers open 72 hours before election day and soldiers may cast their votes from then up to the end of the election. Election day is a legally mandated national holiday. Most public polling stations are open between 7:00 AM and 10:00 PM, though if voters are still in line at 10:00 PM the station will remain open until everyone has voted. Polling stations in small communities with fewer than 350 residents, hospitals, and prisons are open between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM. Patients and staff in hospitals not able to vote during election hours are entitled to special permits allowing them to vote after polling stations in hospitals are closed to everyone else. Every resident eligible to vote is assigned to a particular polling station close to their registered address, which maintains a list of all voters eligible to vote at that station. At the polling station, officials check the identification of voters to ensure that they are assigned to that particular station, check off their names in the list of voters for that station, and hand the voter an envelope. The voter selects the ballot slip of his or her party of choice behind a divider, places the slip into the envelope, then emerges from behind the partition to place it in the ballot box. Special polling stations are set up in hospitals, prisons, diplomatic missions abroad, military bases, women's shelters, and Israeli ships to enable medical professionals, patients, diplomats and their families, Jewish Agency staff abroad, soldiers, prison inmates and staff, sailors, and residents of women's shelters to vote. Polling stations with accessibility for the handicapped are set up around the country and police officers on duty may vote at any polling station. However, to ensure that nobody votes twice, as they are still assigned to a particular polling station close to their registered place of residence, they must vote with what are referred to as double envelopes. The envelope containing their ballot slip is placed into a larger envelope which also contains their identifying information so that it can be checked against the list of voters at their assigned polling station to see if they were marked as having voted there before their double envelope vote is counted. Aside from double envelope voters, all citizens may vote only at their registered polling place. Once a regular polling station closes, officials at the polling station count the votes and send a document recording the results and the ballot box with the ballot slips inside it to one of 25 vote counting centers nationwide, where the documents are checked for any irregularities, then entered into the Central Elections Committee's software system, a closed system not connected to the Internet, and rechecked. Any irregularities detected by the software are brought to the attention of a district court judge present at the station throughout the vote counting process, who adjudicates all such cases. The results are published by the Central Elections Committee. The double envelope votes are brought to the Knesset and counted after all other votes have been counted. One team checks the identification details in the outer envelope against the list of voters at the person's assigned polling station to see if their name has been crossed out, which would mean that they had voted twice. The envelopes containing the ballot slips are then passed on to another team that opens them and counts the votes, thus preserving the anonymity of the votes. Any Israeli citizen over 21 may be elected to the Knesset, except holders of several high positions in the civil service and officers or career soldiers (those should resign from their post before the elections), soldiers in compulsory service, and felons who were convicted and sentenced to prison terms exceeding three months (until seven years after their prison term expired). The following people may not serve as a Member of Knesset (MK) due to their conflicting functions:Basic Law: The Knesset (1958) # The President of the State of Israel # The two Chief Rabbis of the State of Israel # Any judge in the judicial system, so long as they still hold office # Any dayan, or judge in the Rabbinical Court system, so long as they still hold office # The State Comptroller # Rabbis or Ministers of religions, while receiving salaries for such a position # Senior state employees and senior army officers of such grades or ranks and in such functions as shall be determined by law The following prevents a party from running a list in Knesset elections:Basic Law: The Knesset, Amendment 9 # Negating the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish people # Negating the democratic nature of the State # Incitement to racism # Support of armed struggle against the State of Israel After an election, the President, following consultations with the elected party leaders, chooses the Knesset member most likely to have the ability to form a viable (coalition) government. While this typically is the leader of the party receiving the most seats, it is not required to be so. In the event a party wins 61 or more seats in an election, it can form a viable government without having to form a coalition. However, no party has ever won more than 56 seats in an election; thus, a coalition has always been required. That member has up to 42 days to negotiate with the different parties, and then present his or her government to the Knesset for a vote of confidence. If the Knesset approves the proposed government (by a vote of at least 61 members), he or she becomes Prime Minister. As the coalitions often prove highly unstable - given the number and diverse views of the political parties involved - parties (or portions thereof) quite commonly leave them. However, so long as the coalition has at least 61 members (and it is free to recruit from parties not originally in the coalition) it is entitled to remain in power. Such a case occurred with the 19th Knesset: Ehud Barak and four other members left the Labor in 2011 to form the Independence Party, and continued their alignment with Likud, while the remaining eight Labor members remained with the party, but left the coalition; after all the changes, the Likud coalition retained the support of the minimum 61 members, and so, it remained in power. If a coalition fails a motion of no confidence, it ceases to be in power, but only if the motion names a specific replacement to be the prime minister. That individual then has a prescribed amount of time to form a new coalition, and new elections are called if this attempt is not successful (known as a constructive vote of no confidence). ==History== The electoral threshold for a party to be allocated a Knesset seat was only 1% until 1988; it was then raised to 1.5% and remained at that level until 2003, when it was again raised to 2%. On 11 March 2014, the Knesset approved a new law to raise the threshold to 3.25% (approximately 4 seats).Liberman Mocks Opposition 'Crybabies' as Governance Law Passes Israel National News, 11 March 2014 In 1992, in an attempt to produce more stable governments, Israel adopted a system of direct election of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister was directly elected separately from the Knesset in 1996, 1999 and 2001. The direct election of the Prime Minister was abandoned after the 2001 election, having failed to produce more stable governments. ==Voting method== Ballot box Israel's voting method is simplified by the fact that voters vote for a political party and not specific candidates in a closed list system. On election day, and upon entry to a polling station, the voter is given an official envelope, and shown to a voting booth. Inside the booth is a tray of slips, one for each party. The slips are printed with the \\"ballot letters\\" of the party (between one and three Hebrew or Arabic letters), the full official name of the party, and sometimes a slogan in small print. Each party publicizes their letters prior to election day, with most election posters featuring them. As many political parties in Israel are known by their acronyms, several parties can spell out their name in two or three letters, and thus use their name as their ballot letters (e. g., Meretz and Hetz). The voter chooses the relevant slip for their party, puts it in the envelope, seals it, and then places the envelope into the ballot box. The system is simple to use for those with limited literacy. This is especially important in Israel where many new immigrants struggle with the language. Each party must register its chosen letters with the Israeli Central Elections Committee, and certain letters are reserved. If a new party wishes to use letters from an older party, it must receive permission from that party. Example of reserved letters are Mem, Het and Lamedh for Likud and Shin and Samekh for Shas. Voting is by paper ballot and votes are counted manually before being entered into a computer system. Israel does not employ electronic voting due to fears that elections could be vulnerable to cyber threats from those trying to influence the results. == Legislative elections== Ballot slips used in Israeli elections { class= style=text-align:right !Election !Valid votes !Invalid votes !Total votes !Registered voters !Turnout - align=center1949434,6845,411440,095506,56786.9% - align=center1951687,4927,515695,007924,88575.2% - align=center1955853,21922,969876,1881,057,60982.8% - align=center1959969,33924,967994,3061,218,72481.6% - align=center19611,006,96430,0661,037,0301,274,28081.4% - align=center19651,206,72837,9781,244,7061,499,98883.0% - align=center19691,367,74360,2381,427,9811,758,68581.2% - align=center19731,566,85534,2431,601,0982,037,47878.6% - align=center19771,747,87023,9061,771,7762,236,29379.2% - align=center19811,920,12317,2431,937,3662,490,01477.8% - align=center19842,073,32118,0812,091,4022,654,61378.8% - align=center19882,283,12322,4442,305,5672,894,26779.7% - align=center19922,616,84121,1022,637,9433,409,01577.4% - align=center19963,052,13067,7023,119,8323,933,25079.3% - align=center19993,309,41664,3323,373,7484,285,42878.7% - align=center20033,148,36452,4093,200,7734,720,07567.8% - align=center20063,137,06449,6753,186,7395,014,62263.5% - align=center20093,373,49043,0973,416,5875,278,98564.7% - align=center20133,792,74240,9043,833,6465,656,70567.8% - align=center20154,209,46743,8694,253,3365,881,69672.4% - align=centerApr 20194,309,27030,9834,340,2535,943,25468.5% - align=centerSep 20194,436,80628,3624,465,1686,394,03069.8% - align=center20204,586,954 25,053 4,612,007 6,453,255  71.5% } ==References== ==External links== *Voting in Israel: A Right for All Citizens 2008 The Israel Project * Elections for the Knesset (includes Knesset Elections Results) Knesset website *Adam Carr's election archive *2015 Israel Election News Bulletins *MavenSearch Israel Elections 2009 *Israeli Politics for Dummies ","title":"Elections in Israel"},{"id":"1442244","text":"Elections in Jamaica provides information on elections and election results in Jamaica.

They take place within a political system where the King has extensive legislative and executive powers, retaining ultimate political control. The Prime Minister is selected by the King, the PM is then free to choose his own Cabinet. The parliament has quotas: three seats for Circassians and Chechens, nine for Christians and fifteen for women. The electoral system favours rural tribes and those of East Bank origin over urban areas that are primarily inhabited by those of Palestinian descent. The first general election was held during the Emirate of Transjordan in 1929. Even after Jordan gained independence in 1946, British influence caused elections to be held under block voting. Just three months into an elected government experiment in 1956, the former King Hussein then dismissed that government, declaring martial law and banning political parties. This lasted until general elections were reintroduced in 1989 after unrest over price hikes spread in southern Jordan. The 1989 general election under block voting saw opposition Islamist parties win 22 out of 80 seats in the House of Representatives. The electoral system was then changed in 1992 to a single non-transferable vote system, which became known as “one-man one-vote”, in order to suppress Islamist representation. Opposition parties back then including the Muslim Brotherhood’s Islamic Action Front (IAF) often boycotted elections due to the new law, even though political parties were relegalized and martial law was lifted. The 2011–12 Jordanian protests that occurred as part of the Arab Spring led to calls for political reform. Some reforms were introduced prior to the 2013 general election, which included the creation of an Independent Electoral Commission. The changes were however deemed insufficient by many opposition parties, and they continued their boycott. Large-scale reforms were put into place for the 2016 general election and the 2017 local elections. Opposition parties including the IAF have ended their boycott of the elections in 2016 after proportional representation was introduced, and together with their allies managed to win 16 seats out of 130, after they were expecting 20-30 seats. Proportional representation is seen as the first step toward establishing parliamentary governments in which parliamentary blocs, instead of the king, choose the prime minister. However, the underdevelopment of political parties in Jordan have slowed such moves. The latest general and local elections were considered to be fair and transparent by several independent international observers. ==Political system== First general election in Jordan's history was held on 2 April 1929. Compared to other Arab monarchies, Jordan is relatively pluralistic, with a tolerance for political and social opposition. Jordan a member of international treaties obliging it to hold regular elections with appropriate preparation and implementation, and that oblige it to respect the right to vote, the right to be elected and participate in public affairs, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, freedom of movement, and freedom of opinion. After parliament is dissolved, the constitution mandates elections be held within four months. Nonetheless, the monarchy retains ultimate political control, as it is imbued with wide executive and legislative authority, leading the King's royal court and advisers exercising more power than parliament. While in theory the military and General Intelligence Directorate (GID, a state security body) report to parliament, in practice they report to the monarchy. Important fields of policy, such as foreign relations, economic policy, and internal security are controlled by the King and royal advisors. The elected lower house of parliament is further constrained by an upper house of equal legislative responsibility whose members are chosen by the King. While the lower house can initiate legislation, the legislation must then be approved by the senate and the King. If the King returns the law unapproved, it must gain approval from two-thirds of both the house and the senate to go into effect. The King appoints a Prime Minister and Cabinet from the lower house, but is not required to consult parliament on his choice or choose based on the largest parties. Cabinet reshuffles within a single parliament can be frequent, and aside from a way to reward loyal MPs they are often used to counter public dissent, as the King can shift blame for issues onto the previous Cabinet while appearing above politics. Similarly, the King can dissolve parliament before the end of its term if he desires early elections, or suspend parliament entirely and rule by decree, which occurred twice in the 21st century, from 2001 to 2003 and 2009 to 2010. Outside of suspension, elections are held within four months of the dissolution of the previous parliament. Even after legalisation in 1992, political parties have long been weak, an intentional effect of the electoral system. They continue to have low membership, partly due to lingering fear of government discrimination of those holding a party membership. Instead, tribes have become effective political actors, playing roles traditionally associated with political parties, such as holding their own primaries and mobilising voters through their own electoral lists. Elections are therefore often based on patronage rather than politics, with votes falling along tribal or family lines. Politics mirrors the demographic split between those of Palestinian origin and those of East Bank origin. The state is dominated by East Bankers and they form the core of monarchical support, whereas Jordanian Palestinians have little political representation and a systematically discriminated against.Abdullah II, the King of Jordan, holds extensive legislative and executive powers. Electoral districts are delimited by the Cabinet upon the recommendation of the ministry of Interior. These constituencies followed administrative boundaries with some minor changes. Each constituency is unreflective of the populations within them. For example, in the 2013 elections the Amman government had 98,936 people per seat, whereas the Tafileh government had just 25,350. Irbid's seventh district had 48,701 registered voters leading to the winning candidate having 11,624 votes, whereas Ma’an's second district had just 6,733 registered voters and was won by a candidate who garnered only 1,648 votes. This gerrymandering means that often tribal representatives with local concerns rather than national platforms. As the election results are based on patronage rather than political alignment, parliaments is often ineffectual. The lack of political parties leads to it being very fractured, impeding reform. Elections are frequently manipulated by the state, from selective support of candidates with funding and media access, to in some cases direct electoral fraud through manipulating votes or manipulating turnout. This is frequently to the detriment of the Muslim Brotherhood’s political arm in Jordan, the Islamic Action Front. Suppression of the Muslim Brotherhood occurs alongside fear of electoral reform giving Palestinians increased political representation, as the IAF is seen as being supported by many Palestinians. The constraints and restrictions on the power of elected officials imposed by unelected officials has caused public apathy towards parliament. The Jordanian electorate however is largely aware of other electoral options and there is not much public discussion of flaws in the electoral system. While the government has frequently made rhetoric about improving the democratic system, this rhetoric far outstrips any actions it takes. ==Suffrage and quotas== The 2016 general election screening process in a Zarqa school. Jordan’s constitution has no provision guaranteeing universal suffrage. Article 6 prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, race and language, but notably makes no provisions for gender. Nonetheless, women obtained the right to vote in 1974, and quotas for parliamentary participation were introduced in 2003 and have increased since then, and currently each of the 12 governorates has one reserved seat, and each of the three “badia” electoral areas also has one, for a total of 15. Women can be elected to all public offices, and since the turn of the century there have regularly been female members of Cabinet. In 2010 a female was appointed attorney-general for the first time. However, despite the affirmative action utilised through the quota system, cultural issues are thought to impede the independence of women who vote, and some tribal primaries continue to hold male-only votes. Some smaller tribes who cannot reliably win normal seats also take advantage of the quota by nominating female representatives. Female candidates are thus often controlled by the tribes supporting them. Some ethnic and religious minorities have quotas in parliament as well, although these minorities must run in their allocated seats if they wish to enter parliament. Those of Circassian and Chechen descent share three allocated seats, while Christians are allocated nine seats. Both are over-representations in parliament compared to their presence in the overall population. Christians are often appointed to Cabinet ministerial positions, although by practice they do not achieve the highest positions such as Prime Minister and Head Military Commander. Bedouins have three special “badia” electorates, each of which provides three members to parliament, including one woman per badia. The badia divide the country into northern, central, and southern zones, but the ability to vote in these districts is determined not only by location but also by tribal membership, with only members of approved tribes able to vote in these electorates. The age of suffrage is 18. Those who are bankrupt or mentally disabled are not allowed to vote, and there have historically been no provisions to help absentee or special needs voters. Employees of the armed forces, state security services, public security services, Gendarmie, and Civil Defence forces cannot vote during their employment. Registration rules, which are determined by the Independent Electoral Committee (IEC), mandate registration in the district of residence, or in the district where a father or grandfather was born. An exception exists for Circassians, Chechens, and Christians, who may register in a neighbouring district if they reside in a district which lacks a seat for their quota. In the 2013 elections, there was an overall 400,000 voters who registered in districts they did not reside in. ==History== ===Martial law=== Under a constitution set up in 1952, political parties were allowed, and a Political Parties Law was passed in 1955 affirming this, although they had to register and be approved by the government. No majorities were elected, and this period produced coalition governments. However, upon the imposition of martial law in 1957 electoral activities and parties were banned. After this point party activity continued underground, and was expressed through other forms such as labour unions and professional organisations. Women received the right to vote and stand for office in 1974, although martial law was still in effect. A woman was first appointed to Cabinet in 1976, although during the 20th century participation was rare and mostly symbolic, with often just a token woman included. ===1989 liberalisation=== The monarchy's firm control over the political process was maintained until an economic crash in the late 1980s caused protests, even among East Bankers. This prompted an unprecedented political and social liberalisation, revoking martial law and holding an election. The 1989 election was run using block voting, with voters casting a number of votes equal to the number of representatives of their district, with the candidates with the highest votes in each district entering parliament. This system was much the same as the one that had been used during the British mandate. There were 20 constituencies, although they were not evenly distributed by population. Eight seats were set aside for Christians, and three for Cicassians and Chechens. While political parties remained banned, many candidates were clearly affiliated with various groups, such as the monarchy and the Muslim Brotherhood. Out of the 80 seas, the majority were won by opposition parties, including Islamists, secular leftists, and pan-Arab nationalists. This was not representative of the percentage of the vote, with 20% of votes for the Muslim Brotherhood winning 30% of the seats, and the 16% of seats won by independent Islamists similarly over-representative. The 60% of votes that went to pro-monarchy candidates won only 40% of the seats. This was in part due to the better organisation of Islamists, despite the lack of official party structures. Despite this, the resultant parliament is viewed more favourably with the public than any subsequent parliaments have been. ===One-man one-vote=== In order to suppress future Islamist votes, King Hussein instituted a new system prior to the 1993 elections. However, in 1992 he introduced a new Political Parties Law, allowing political parties to register with the Ministry of Interior, and providing recourse for judicial challenge if party formation is denied. Alongside new parties, many parties that had existed before the imposition of martial law reformed. The Muslim Brotherhood created a Jordanian political wing, registering the Islamic Action Front as their political party. Under the new system, the country was divided into 45 electoral districts, again providing disproportionate influence to rural East Bank communities while side-lining urban and Palestinian areas. Voting was held under a single non-transferable vote rule, where each voter has one vote even in multi-member districts. This weakened political parties as if they competed in multi-member districts with multiple candidates they risked diluting their vote between candidates and thus not winning any seats, whereas restricting the number of candidates they ran meant restricting the total number of seats they could possibly win. Political parties were also weak due to low membership, caused by public fear of discrimination against party members. The new electoral system the parties competed in became derisively known as the “one-man one-vote” system in Jordan, despite that phrase usually referring to a positive tenet of democracy. While the representation in parliament better lined up with voting proportions, the system was seen as restricting voter choice. As well as weakening parties it strengthened tribalism and sub-national identities, making elections local rather than national. Well-connected local individuals were able to gain electoral heft at the expense of national parties, and most independent MPs were conservative members of the state. Candidacies were often announced well before election campaigns officially began. The government was keen to further encourage female participation in politics, placing 99 women in the municipal committees that organised the 1994 local elections, leading to 20 women standing, one of whom won a mayoralty and nine others who won local council seats. By 2003 there was at least one woman in each municipal council. The new system was unpopular with political parties, and 11 parties led by the IAF boycotted the 1997 national elections. Changes prior to the intended 2001 elections led to an increase in MP numbers to 110. Although parliament was dismissed in June 2011 in line with its 4-year mandate, elections were delayed by the King until 2003. By 2003 there were 31 licensed political parties, which fell into four broad groups: Islamist, leftist, Arab nationalist, and centrist Jordanian nationalists. Despite these party memberships, candidates often still ran as independents, for fear of alienating tribal votes. The 2003 election saw the introduction of a quota for women in addition to the others of six of the 110 seats. These six seats would be allocated by a special panel if no women were elected in normal seats, which turned out to be the case. It also saw the lowering of the voting age to 18. The IAF held another partial boycott during the 2003 elections. A 2007 law mandated political parties have at least 500 members in at least 5 of Jordan's governorates, invalidating the existence of 22 political parties. The IAF however decided to participate in the 2007 elections, which was marred by reports of electoral fraud. King Abdullah II dissolved parliament in 2009, halfway into its four-year term. On 20 May 2010 he approved a new electoral law, which stated that the election would be overseen by judges and punishing those buying and selling votes. It raised the number of seats to 120, and upped the quota for women to 12. Four of the new seats were placed in urban areas, a move designed to reduce the pressure for electoral reform. While maintaining the basics of one-man one- vote, the new law changed how elections worked in multi-member districts. It divided them into multiple contiguous subdistricts, determined not by geography but by voter choice. Candidates chose which virtual subdistrict they would run in, and voters voted in the subdistrict of their choice. The government claimed it would reduce tribalisms, but analysts noted it would worsen the situation, with candidates dividing subdistricts between them prior to the elections. Thus insider candidates with privileged access to government had an advantage, although some felt that given their organisation Islamists may have benefitted to a slight extent. Additionally, voter mobilisation was impeded by the virtual districts. Nonetheless, the changes led to the November 2010 elections being boycotted by a wide range of parties led by the IAF. Despite this the government attempted to bolster the election's legitimacy. It introduced computer-based monitoring of results, and invited international monitors who felt it had been free of direct manipulation, unlike previous elections, although they noted there was no independent electoral commission. The government also launched a large campaign to increase voter turnout, although it only reported a turnout of 53%, and local NGOs estimated it to be as low as 40%. The low turnout was exacerbated by differences in turnout between different demographic groups, with nadirs of 20% in urban Palestinian districts, and highs of 80% in some rural areas. As a result, only 10% of MPs represented Palestinians. 2010 saw one female MP elected in an ordinary seat, in addition to those elected under quotas. Less than half of the public had confidence in the resultant parliament. ===Arab Spring=== Economic protesters in Amman in 2012 Grievances brought on by two decades of political and social stagnation, and in some cases backsliding on reforms, emerged as part of the wider protests during the Arab Spring. Protests spread beyond traditional opposition groups to the usually loyal East Bank communities. Alongside protests caused by economic hardship, calls emerged for greater political reform and reforms of the state security sector, although the more extreme calls, such as for an overthrow of the monarchy, never obtained wide public support. Unrest led to King Abdullah II to frequently change government, with five prime ministers being in power over the two years subsequent to the beginning of the protests. In response, the King promised reforms and a move towards constitutional monarchy, and in June 2011 established a 52-member National Dialogue Committee and a 10-member Constitutional Review Council. While both were mostly full of royal loyalists, they did propose changes. In September 2011, the Council proposed 42 constitutional amendments, including ones establishing an Independent Electoral Committee. The King requested that political parties join in the National Dialogue Committee, and while many opposition parties did the IAF refused to. The Committee recommended replacing one-man one-vote with proportional representation (PR) among electorates based on governorates, creating 115 PR seats at governorate levels and 15 at national levels, as well as increasing the quota for women and maintaining the other quotas. King Hussein and the current King Abdullah II. Institutional reluctance to reform was compounded by disagreements among reformists on the correct path forward, as well as caution regarding radical change due to the deteriorating situations in other Arab Spring affected countries, especially considering pre-existing East Bank-Palestinian domestic tensions. A July 2012 law banned the formation of political parties on the basis of religion. A new election law in 2012 expanded parliament to 150 members while keeping the same ethnic and religious seat quotas. It increased the woman's quota by three by mandating that one MP from each Bedouin badia constituency be a woman, maintaining the women's quota at 10% of overall seats. It created a mixed- electoral system by making 27 of the 150 seats elected on a proportional basis based on nationwide lists, while the others remained elected through one-man one-vote, 18 in single-member districts and 90 in multi-member districts. The King also promised to consult parliament when choosing a cabinet. Other recommendations however, such as a more substantial move to PR, were ignored. This, combined with the constitutional changes being mostly cosmetic, meant once Parliament was dissolved on 4 October 2013, the IAF and other opposition parties decided to boycott the elections. Despite this, the government tried heavily to encourage participation and campaigning, extending registration past the allotted time, and turning a blind eye to campaign violations such as the use of state symbols and images of the king and campaigning beyond the official deadline of midnight of election day in close proximity to polling stations. The addition of PR seats was expected to slightly rectify the underrepresentation of Palestinian voters. Many new parties were contested just to contest these seats, with a final total of 61 registered for the election. Many however lacked distinct political character. Each voter had two votes, one within their electoral district, and one for the 27 national-level seats. The new Independent Electoral Commission was regarded as having improved electoral administration, promoting electoral transparency and ensuring ballot secrecy. The PR seats were very fractured, with the largest party being the Islamic Centrist Party which received only 114,458 (8.89%) votes leading to three votes. 18 women were elected in 2013, 15 from the quotas, two as the head of PR lists, and one as a district candidate. In spite of the changes, a survey found 53% of respondents to not find the elections to be fair. ===Return to proportional vote=== governorate or part of a governorate. More reforms were touted in 2015, with the government promising the end of one-man one-vote. Furthermore, the government expressed that all licensed parties were part of Jordan's political fabric, explicitly mentioning the IAF. The final reforms were proposed on 31 August, and were seen as very similar to the popularly remembered 1989 elections. The new system reduced the seats to 130 while keeping all quotas at the same numbers. It fully eliminated one-man one-vote, restoring the block system whereby voters had votes equal to the number of seats in their district. In addition, they each also have a single vote for a multi-member party list. This was not the case in the 1989 elections, and reflected the PR experiment from the 2013 elections. Re- elections will be held in the case of ties. All candidates will run as members of lists, with open list PR used to determine all seats falling outside of quotas. For the Circassian/Chechen and Christian seats, the seat is given to the highest candidate from within those groups. The female quota seats however are assigned to women who would not otherwise be elected. There are 23 electoral districts: five in the Amman government, four in the Irbid governorate, two in the Zarqa governorate, one each for the other nine governorates, and three badia districts for the Bedouin quotas. The Circassian/Chechen and Christian quotas were included among seats assigned within the governorate districts. The female quota is divided so that there is one seat in each governorate, and one in each badia. While the division of population between districts remains imperfect, it was an improvement upon previous elections. After minor changes in both houses, the new law was approved by the King on 13 March 2016. Both government and opposition groups hailed the changes as progressive. This included the IAF, which hailed the changed as positive. Democracy advocates were pleased that the changes made the law very similar to the 1989 law, which had long been held in high regard. The election is set for 20 September 2016, and will again be run by the IEC, who are providing for the first time provisions for deaf and blind voters. There was some controversy over the reforms. Tribal leaders opposed them as they reduced their influence, and there was fear of increased influence in Palestinians through the IAF through the increasing through still unequal representation of urban areas. In 2015 internal divisions erupted within the Muslim Brotherhood, tacitly encouraged by the government. One splinter group, known as the Muslim Brotherhood Association, took advantage of the fact that the Muslim Brotherhood was affiliated with its Egyptian founding group rather than being registered as a Jordanian organisation, registering as the official Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan. The Muslim Brotherhood Association, which emphasises its Jordanian identity, was given official status in March 2015. Subsequent internal dissent among the original Muslim Brotherhood led to the resignation of hundreds of members. Two other splinter groups have also broken away from the Muslim Brotherhood. The Muslim Brotherhood Association leveraged its official status to launch lawsuits claiming ownership of Muslim Brotherhood property, and in April 2016 the lawsuits were decided in the favour of the Association, leading them to seizing control of a wide swathe of Muslim Brotherhood property. The government also prevented a celebration of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood. The IAF, despite being the political wing of the original and now-illegal Muslim Brotherhood, is registered as a Jordanian organisation and remains legal. Despite the fractures in the Muslim Brotherhood the IAF decided to end its boycott and compete in the 2016 elections after overwhelming support to do so in an internal vote, with 76% of members supporting participating in the election. 17% of members still opposed participation without substantial limitations to the King's constitutional powers. The government wants the IAF to participate to enhance the election's legitimacy in western eyes. It is thought that government pressure and the fear of obscurity led to IAF participation, and that they may be attempting to emulate the gains of elected Islamist parties in Tunisia and Morocco who co-operated with their governments, while avoiding suppression similar to that occurring in Egypt. ==Election results== ===2003=== ===2007=== ===2010=== ===2013=== ===2016=== ==Electoral administration== Prior to 2013, elections were run by the Ministry of Interior. Constitutional amendments created Article 67, which provided for the creation of an Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). The IEC is mandated to manage and supervise parliamentary elections, and may be asked by government to supervise other elections as needed. It was established with a five-member board which included one chairperson. These members are appointed for 6-year non-renewable terms. While its budget is controlled by the government, it is otherwise legally and administratively independent. ===Registration=== Upon registering for the 2013 vote, voters received a registration card which was required alongside their national identity card in order to vote. This was done to prevent electoral fraud, as national identity cards were seen as more easily forged. In addition, polling stations were assigned when registering, to guard against multiple voting, as prior to 2013 voting booths were chosen by voters on the day. The election had 4,069 polling stations. 2,282,182 people, 70% of the eligible population, registered for the 2013 elections, of which 1,178,864 (51.9%) were women. Unlike previous years, the 2013 registrations were viewed as accurate. Final turnout was 56.6%. A process known as family registration allowed voters to designate someone else to pick up their electoral card. This created fears of voting fraud, as it led to some registering for others without their consent, giving them the ability to ransom or sell voting cards. The IEC reported that 62% of cards were picked up by proxy, while other reports put the percentage as high as 85%. In part, vote-buying was encouraged by voter cynicism towards parliament. The IEC took action and caused the arrest of alleged vote-buyers shortly before the election, although this action was criticised as insufficient, and three of those arrested went on to win parliamentary seats that grant them immunity to prosecution. Registration became automatic based on lists provided by the Civil Service and Passport Division for the 2016 election. Registering as a candidate in 2013 required a 500 dinar fee. Some municipalities further required deposits to ensure candidates cleaned up campaigning materials after the election, although this was not general enforced. In addition to registering political parties, individuals could register their own lists for PR constituencies, so long as they included at least nine individuals. This opened the lists to abuse from wealthy individuals, who would put themselves at the top of lists and pay others to be in their lists, and contributed to fractured national results. ===Voting=== The IEC was created only shortly before the 2013 elections, and had only 8-months to prepare for it. It introduced pre-printed ballot cards designed to conform to international standards. Prior to this, voters needed to write down their preferred candidate's names. This meant illiterate voters could not vote in secret, as they had to ask voting staff to write down their vote, risking voting fraud. The new ballots also had enhanced security features to help ensure legitimacy. The IEC also introduced indelible ink, and for the first time all election staff, 32,000 at this election, were trained. Votes were counted four separate times to allow cross-checking, with almost 400 international observers. There were procedural misunderstandings and delays in the 2013 elections, but overall it ran smoothly. Election results were updated continuously and transparently after the election was carried out, with the final results being posted on 28 January, five days after voting. International observers widely regarded the IEC as being successful and an impartial arbiter of results. ==References== ==External links== * IDEA country profile ","title":"Elections in Jordan"},{"id":"1442247","text":"12th century Lampass Cross in the churchyard of St John the Baptist & St Michael & All Angels, Stanground.

He held the British Empire Middleweight Championship from 1933-39, and took the British Empire Light Heavyweight Title in April, 1937, by knocking out Eddie Phillips.\\"Jock McAvoy Dies\\", The Guardian, London, England, pg. 19, 22 November 1971 ==Early life== Bamford was born in Burnley, Lancashire, but was billed as being from Rochdale. ==Boxing career== Bamford adopted the name Jock McAvoy so that his mother did not realize he was boxing. Initially discovered, trained and managed by Joseph Tolley at Tolley's famous Rochdale Boxing Club, he was known as the Rochdale thunder bolt. During his career he held the British and Commonwealth middleweight and light heavyweight titles. McAvoy's bid to capture the European middleweight crown was derailed when he lost a unanimous decision to future world middleweight champion Marcel Thil of France in Paris on 15 January 1935. On August 10, 1931, McAvoy officially held the BBBofC Northern Area Middleweight Title when he defeated Joe Lowthner at King's Hall in Manchester, England. Lowthner's corner through in the towel, ending the bout in eight of fifteen rounds. ==Taking the British Empire Middleweight Title, April, 1933== On April 10, 1933, McAvoy took the BBBofC British Middleweight Title and British Empire Middleweight Title in a fifteen round points decision from Len Harvey in Manchester, England. In 1935 McAvoy travelled to the United States of America, where he outpointed Al McCoy in November. On 21 December 1935, McAvoy was matched against the World Middleweight boxing champion, Ed 'Babe' Risko at Madison Square Garden in a non-title bout. McAvoy, who outweighed his opponent by seven pounds floored Risko with a right to the jaw in the opening seconds. Risko was dropped five more times in the first round before being knocked out in 2:48.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9h1kAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=NnsNAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1598,6218464&dq;=jock- mcavoy+risko&hl;=en McAvoy had performed too well for his own good, and boxing politics being what they were, McAvoy was never allowed a rematch with the title at stake. McAvoy then decided to campaign as a light heavyweight in the United States. In November 1935 he made his debut in America, and won two fights in February 1936 before obtaining an NBA World Light Heavyweight Title shot against reigning world champion John Henry Lewis at Madison Square Garden in New York City. On 13 March 1936 he was outpointed over 15 rounds by Lewis. ===Attempting the British Heavyweight Title, April, 1936=== After his unsuccessful bid to capture the world light heavyweight crown from John Henry Lewis in 1936, McAvoy returned to England, and his next fight was for the British and British Empire heavyweight titles held by Welshman, Jack Petersen. Petersen won the fifteen round fight on points in Kensington, London on April 23, 1936. After a fast start, the action slowed and the crowd of 10,000, urged the boxers to mix. McAvoy picked up the pace, rocking Petersen with some flashy lefts, but was later down for a count of eight from a right uppercut. He fought well, if cautiously for the remainder of the bout, easily remaining on his feet throughout, despite Petersen's twelve pound weight advantage. McAvoy weaved continuously and fought from a crouch, methods he had observed fighting in America. Though there were few fouls, Petersen was repeatedly warned for blows to the back of McAvoy's head.\\"Jock McAvoy is Outpointed by Peterson\\", The Burlington Free Press, Burlington, Vermont, pg. 20, 20 April 1936\\"McAvoy Beaten by Heavy Champ in Long Battle\\", The Cincinnati Enquirer, Cincinnati, Ohio, pg. 16, 24 April 1936 ==Taking the BBBofC British Light Heavyweight Title, April, 1937== McAvoy took the BBBofC British Light Heavyweight Title from Eddie Phillips in a fourteenth round knockout on April 27, 1937 at Empire Pool at Wembley.

It consists of Weekend Edition Saturday and Weekend Edition Sunday, each of which airs for two hours, from 8:00 AM to 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, with refeeds until 2:00 p.m. Weekend Edition Saturday is hosted by Scott Simon, while Weekend Edition Sunday has been hosted by Lulu Garcia-Navarro since January 8, 2017. The programs feature longer stories than most NPR news magazines and more arts and culture stories. On Saturdays the program featured an exchange between the program's host and commentator, Daniel Schorr, during which they discussed the events of the past week. Until February 10, 2008, on Sundays the show broadcast Voices in the News, an audio montage of sound clips from the week's events. Sundays continue to have the \\"Puzzle\\" game with New York Times crossword puzzle editor Will Shortz. The puzzle segment usually airs approximately 40 minutes past the start of the second hour of the program. ==Format== Weekday sibling Morning Edition breaks up each hour into five segments, none more than twelve minutes long; Weekend Edition uses only three segments per hour, accommodating longer stories than Morning Edition typically accommodates. Weekend Edition begins with a sixty- second billboard. Both Simon and Garcia-Navarro use the billboard as a general discussion about what's coming up in the hour, infused with soundbites from selected stories. A standard five-minute NPR newscast follows, until six past the hour. A thirty-second music bed follows the newscast, allowing local stations an opportunity to promote programming or local news/weather/traffic. Segment A begins at 6:30 past the hour (duration 11:29). The most important news of the day is placed here. Regular features (such as, before his death, Daniel Schorr's weekly news wrap-up) appear in this segment. At eighteen minutes past the hour, a two-minute station break starts. The first minute is a music bed solely for use of the member stations. The second minute, from nineteen to twenty past, is a \\"headlines\\" segment in which the NPR newscaster on staff that morning recaps the major stories of the hour. Some stations decide to use the entire two minutes for local purposes, taking the opportunity to deliver their own headlines, underwriting or events calendars. At twenty past the hour, segment B begins, running 14:19 in length. NPR offers local stations a cutaway from the national feed at 34:20 past the hour. The cutaway is identified by the host when he or she says, \\"You're listening to Weekend Edition from NPR News\\". For stations that opt to stay with the national feed, a short interview or commentary piece is delivered, running 2:59 in length. Another two-minute station break, following the same music bed/headlines format as the first, ensues. Segment C, the longest segment of the hour, starts at 40:00 after the hour and runs for seventeen minutes, forty-nine seconds. Weekend Edition Saturday usually slots musical performances, arts stories or interviews in segment C. Weekend Edition Sunday uses the time for its weekly puzzle segment with Will Shortz, and interviews and light features. At the end of the segment, the host credits theme song composer B.J. Leiderman and signs off for the hour. Segment C is followed by a forty-second funding credit announcement, and then ninety seconds of music. ==Hosts== * Weekend Edition Saturday ** Scott Simon (1985–1992; 1993–present) ** Alex Chadwick (1992–1993) * Weekend Edition Sunday ** Susan Stamberg (1987–1989) ** Liane Hansen (1989–2011) ** Audie Cornish (2011–2012) ** Rachel Martin (2012–2016) ** Lulu Garcia-Navarro (2017–present) * Contributors: ** Joe Bevilacqua (won 2004 Silver Reel Award from the National Federation of Community Broadcasters for his personal essay, \\"A Guy Named Joe Bevilacqua\\") ==References== ==External links== *Weekend Edition Saturday *Weekend Edition Sunday *20 Years of Weekend Edition Sunday (audio) *Google group on NPR puzzle, with archive *Archive of synopses of Will Shortz puzzle segments Category:American news radio programs Category:NPR programs Category:1985 radio programme debuts ","title":"Weekend Edition"},{"id":"1442275","text":"Mary Ann Caws (born 1933) is an American author, translator, art historian and literary critic.\\"Mary Ann Caws.\\" Gale Literature: Contemporary Authors, Gale, 2010.

The Assembly was an institution within the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) established by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to provide 'provisional, democratic self-government' in advance of a decision on the final status of Kosovo. Kosovo, formerly a province of Serbia, came under UN administration in 1999 and unilaterally declared its independence in February 2008. The Assembly elected in 2007 continued in office after the declaration of independence. Since the Kosovo War, the country has held four parliamentary elections, one every three years, in 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010 respectively. The first two were administered by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the second two monitored by the international community, with the OSCE and other observing groups concluding that these elections were generally fair and free. Under Kosovo's Constitutional Framework, which established the PISG, elections were to be held every three years for the Assembly. The Assembly then in turn elects a president and prime minister. The Assembly had 120 members elected for a three-year term: 100 members elected by proportional representation, and 20 members representing national minorities (10 Serbian, 4 Roma, Ashkali and Egyptian, 3 Bosniak, 2 Turkish and 1 Gorani). Under the new Constitution of 2008, the guaranteed seats for Serbs and other minorities remains the same, but in addition they may gain extra seats according to their share of the vote. Kosovo has a multi-party system, with numerous parties and the system of proportional representation and guaranteed minority representation means that no one party is likely to have a parliamentary majority. In addition, a minimum number of Ministers were and remain reserved for Serbs and other minorities. The voting age in Kosovo is 18 years old.Kosovo. Youthpolicy.org.

In spite of this, Serbia carried out local elections in Kosovo in 2008; these were not recognized by UNMIK. The Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija is a local government created by the Serbian minority in the Kosovo city of Mitrovica in response to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence. The first elections for the Assembly took place on May 11, 2008 to coincide with the 2008 Serbian local elections. In the Brussels agreement, the government of Serbia agreed to integrate Kosovo Serb political structures into the government of Kosovo. ===Composition=== The seats in the Assembly are divided as follows: *Serbian Radical Party – 17 *Democratic Party of Serbia – 13 *Socialist Party of Serbia – 4 *Democratic Party – 3 *G17 Plus – 1 *Civic Initiative of Gora – 1 *Others – 4 DS is boycotting the Assembly for now, stating that it would wait until the new government is formed in Serbia which would then decide whether the Assembly is a good way of promoting the Kosovan Serbs' issues. ===International response=== The elections which are basis for the Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija were not recognized by the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) or the Republic of Kosovo. The creation of the assembly has been condemned as an act aimed at destabilizing Kosovo by Kosovar president Fatmir Sejdiu, while UNMIK denied that this election was a serious issue as the assembly will not have an operative role. ==See also== * Electoral calendar * Electoral system * List of political parties in Kosovo == Notes == { style=\\"margin-left:13px; line-height:150%\\" align=\\"right\\" valign=\\"top\\"a.  } ==References== ==External links== *Central Election Commission of the Republic of Kosovo *Adam Carr's Election Archive *Parties and elections *OSCE Mission in Kosovo, Elections *Assembly of Kosovo ","title":"Elections in Kosovo"},{"id":"1442281","text":"Elections in Kuwait are held for both the National Assembly and for the Municipality. Kuwait's constitution calls for elections to the unicameral National Assembly at a maximum interval of four years. Elections are held earlier if the Constitutional Court or Emir dissolve the parliament. ==Electoral districts== Kuwait was divided into five districts in the National Assembly elections between 1963 and 1975. Each district elected ten deputies to the Assembly. Before the 1981 elections the government redistricted Kuwait, creating a system of 25 districts. Following the redistricting, fewer Shi'ite candidates won seats in the Assembly. This was a deliberate result of the redistricting, and it followed the 1979 Revolution in Iran. Each of the 25 districts elected two members to the National Assembly, for a total of 50 elected members (additional members sit as appointed members of the cabinet). Each voter could cast ballots for two candidates, though it was also possible to vote for only one candidate. In each district the candidates who won the largest and second largest number of votes earned seats in the National Assembly. Currently there are 5 districts in the National Assembly. ==Election results== Political groups and parliamentary voting blocs exist, although most candidates run as independents. Once elected, many deputies form voting blocs in the National Assembly. Kuwaiti law does not recognize political parties. However, numerous political groups function as de facto political parties in elections, and there are blocs in the parliament. Major de facto political parties include: National Democratic Alliance, Popular Action Bloc, Hadas (Kuwaiti Muslim Brotherhood), National Islamic Alliance and Justice and Peace Alliance. ==Election history== The earliest modern elections in Kuwait were held in 1921. Elections were held again in June and then in December 1938 for a majlis al-tashri'i, or Legislative Council. The ruling family dissolved the second Council in 1939. Following independence in 1961 elections were held in 1962 to elect 20 members to the constitutional convention. ===Past results=== Elections were held in July 27, 2013. Voter turnout was an estimated 52.5%, which was higher than expected despite an opposition boycott, the voter turnout was only 7 percentage points lower than the turnout of the non- boycotted February 2012 elections (59%). Liberals were the biggest winners of the election. According to the Associated Press, liberal lawmakers gained at least six seats. The Congressional Research Service reported that liberals won 9 seats, making them the largest political bloc in the parliament after pro- government Independents. Fox News reported that the tribal bloc won at least 10 seats in the 50-member parliament. Two women were elected. Sunni Islamists won 3 seats. There are 10 Shia MPs.Sectarianism and authoritarianism in Kuwait Washington Post ==Latest results== Elections were held in November 28, 2016. The Emir had called for early elections due to a gridlock over economic policies. Voter turnout was an estimated 70%, which was the highest ever recorded.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/11/kuwait-poll-opposition-wins- parliament-161127060822207.html According to Aljazeera the opposition which around half consisted of Salafist and the Muslim Brotherhood won a total of 24 seats. The Shia minority was reduced to six seats from nine and one female was elected. ==Suffrage== Kuwait has universal adult suffrage for Kuwaiti citizens who are 21 or older. The constitution bars members of the ruling family from running for election to the National Assembly, though the constitution does not explicitly prohibit these members of the ruling family from casting votes. The franchise was expanded to include women in 2005. When voting was first introduced in Kuwait in 1985, Kuwaiti women had the right to vote. This right was later removed. In 2005, Kuwaiti women were re-granted the right to vote. Kuwait's citizenship law, in theory, gives citizenship to those who descend, in the male line, from residents of Kuwait in 1920. ==See also== *Politics of Kuwait ==References== ==External links== * Kuwait Politics Database ","title":"Elections in Kuwait"},{"id":"1442282","text":"Laos elects a legislature nationally and the public also participates in the election of village heads.

The assembly was to choose a prime minister and organize parliamentary elections in 2013. A process to write a constitution was also to be determined. Unrest driven by armed militias, ethnic minority and radical groups undermined the process and the government for the years following the overthrowing of Muammar Gaddafi. While internal apathy towards democratic reforms slowed the process, external bodies such as the European Union were still pressing for the establishment of a national dialogue to build consensus for the drafting of a new constitution to take place before the end of 2014. Parliamentary elections were scheduled to be held on 25 June 2014 in a move aimed at stabilizing the country and quelling the unrest. ==Electoral bodies== According to Article 157 of the 2017 draft Libyan constitution, the Libyan High National Election Commission (HNEC) is responsible for organising elections of national political bodies in Libya.

Luxembourg is a liberal representative democracy, with universal suffrage guaranteed under the constitution. Elections are held regularly, and are considered to be fair and free. Separate elections are held to elect representatives at communal, national, and European levels. The main institution to which members are elected is the Chamber of Deputies, the national legislature and the sole source of membership, confidence, and supply of the government. Luxembourg is represented by six MEPs to the European Parliament, who are elected simultaneously with elections held in other European Union member states. The country has a multi-party system, traditionally defined by the existence of three large political parties: the Christian Social People's Party (CSV), the Democratic Party (DP), and the Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party (LSAP). Historically, the three parties have won a large majority of the votes between them, but their total percentage has fallen recently, such that two additional parties, the Greens and the Alternative Democratic Reform Party (ADR) have recorded over 9% of votes at each of last two legislative elections. The CSV (and its predecessor) has provided the Prime Minister for all but 12 years since 1918, and has always been the largest party in the legislature. In this respect, Luxembourg has certain features of a dominant-party system, although coalition governments are the norm and the two most recent governments do not involve the CSV. ==Chamber of Deputies== Luxembourg's national legislature is the unicameral Chamber of Deputies (Luxembourgish Châmber vun Députéirten, French: Chambre des députés, German: Abgeordnetenkammer). The Chamber has 60 members, known as 'deputies', elected for a five-year term in four multi-seat constituencies, known as 'circonscriptions'. Seats are allocated by proportional representation, using the Hagenbach-Bischoff system. Voting is compulsory for all voters on the electoral register.. The most recent election took place in October 2018 and the next is scheduled for 2023. ===Eligibility=== The four legislative circonscriptions of Luxembourg are the constituencies for elections to the Chamber of Deputies. To be eligible to vote in elections to the Chamber of Deputies, one must fulfil the following criteria: * One must be a Luxembourgish citizen. * One must be eighteen years of age on election day. * One must never have been convicted of a criminal offence. * One must otherwise be in full possession of one's political rights (e.g. not be certified as insane). In addition to the criteria outlined above, to stand for election to the Chamber of Deputies, one must be resident in Luxembourg. Furthermore, one cannot be a candidate if one is a judge or a member of the Council of State. ===Circonscriptions=== Deputies are elected from four constituencies ('circonscriptions'). They are arranged geographically, as combinations of the twelve traditional cantons. The four circonscriptions are Centre, Est, Nord, Sud. As the constituencies are based on geographic region and traditional borders, they have greatly differing populations. To reflect this, each circonscription elects a different number of deputies; Sud, with 40% of the national population, elects twenty-three deputies, whilst Est, with only 12% of the population, elects seven. Voters can cast as many votes as their circonscription elects deputies (so, in Est, one can vote for up to seven candidates), which can be spread across party lists or concentrated behind one single party. ===Electoral system=== The seats are allocated according to the Hagenbach-Bischoff system. ===Latest election=== {class= style=text-align:right !Party !Votes !% !Seats !+/– - align=leftChristian Social People's Party999,38133.6621–2 - align=leftLuxembourg Socialist Workers' Party621,33217.6010-3 - align=leftDemocratic Party597,08016.9112-1 - align=leftThe Greens533,89315.129+3 - align=leftAlternative Democratic Reform Party292,3888.284+1 - align=leftThe Left193,5945.4820 - align=leftPirate Party Luxembourg227,5496.452+2 - align=leftCommunist Party of Luxembourg44,9161.2700 - align=leftParty for Full Democracy10,3200.290New - align=leftInvalid/blank votes16,837––– - align=leftTotal216,177100600 - align=leftRegistered voters/turnout259,88789.66–– - align=left colspan=5Source: Elections in Luxembourg, IFES } ==European Parliament== Since 1979, Luxembourg has elected members to the European Parliament, which is the primary representative organ of the EU, and, with the Council of the European Union, forms its legislative branch. Due to its small size, the Grand Duchy elects just six members out of a total of 732, which is more than only Malta (which elects five MEPs); nonetheless, Luxembourg's representation is disproportionately large compared to its population, and Luxembourg elects more MEPs per capita than any other country (see: Apportionment in the European Parliament). MEPs are elected to five-year terms. The exact date of elections is decided by Luxembourg, allowing it to schedule them on the same date as elections to the Chamber of Deputies (as is usually the case). ===Eligibility=== To be eligible to vote in elections to the European Parliament, one must fulfil the following criteria: * One must be a citizen of the European Union. * One must be eighteen years of age on election day. * One must never have been convicted of a criminal offence. * One must otherwise be in full possession of one's political rights (e.g. not be certified as insane) in one's own country of citizenship (Luxembourg or another member state). * If not a Luxembourgish citizen, must have been resident in Luxembourg for at least five of the past six years when enrolling on the electoral register. In addition to the criteria outlined above, to stand for election to the European Parliament, one must be resident in Luxembourg. There are also extra requirements if one is a non-Luxembourgish citizen, in which case, one must be in full possession of one's political rights in both Luxembourg and one's country of citizenship (if not a Luxembourgish national), and have resided in Luxembourg for the past five years (and not just five of the past six). ===Electoral system=== The seats are allocated according to the D'Hondt method. ===Latest election=== ===Past elections=== *1999 European election *2004 European election *2009 European election ==Local elections== Each commune (municipality) has an elected communal council. The number of councillors varies from 7 to 19 based on the number of inhabitants; the exception being the City of Luxembourg where its communal council consists of 27 members. The councillors are directly elected every six years on the second Sunday of October. The last elections were held on 8 October 2017. The law of 15 December 2017 further defines that, in case the parliamentary and communal elections coincide, the latter are held in June of that year. ==Referendums== The referendum was introduced into the Constitution of Luxembourg by the constitutional revision of 1919. The Constitution mentions the referendum in Article 51: \\"Voters will be asked to vote by way of referendum in the cases and under the conditions determined by law.\\" The only details about execution of referendums are found in Article 114 which deals with constitutional amendments. There are no other provisions regarding referendums in Luxembourg. The Constitution amendment first has to be passed by two-thirds absolute super-majority of the Parliament, and then: * either passed again after at least three months under the same terms, * or passed on the referendum, if a referendum is requested in first two months of the three-month period by ** either one quarter of members of the Parliament ** or 25 thousand registered voters. The referendum on constitutional amendment (defined in Article 114) is binding. Referendums in general (defined in Article 51) are not explicitly stated to be binding. The general framework of the organizational arrangements of referendums is established by \\"The Act of 4 February 2005 on the national referendum\\". There were four referendums in Luxembourg since 1919: * the referendum on head of state and economic union in 1919 * the referendum on banning the Communist party in 1937 * European Constitution referendum in 2005 *Luxembourg constitutional referendum in 2015 None of the referendums were constitutional amendments, so were non-binding. ==See also== * Electoral calendar * Electoral system ==Footnotes== == Further reading == * ==External links== *Luxembourg at Adam Carr's Election Archive *Luxembourg at Parties and Elections ","title":"Elections in Luxembourg"},{"id":"1442289","text":"Elections in Lithuania, are held to select members of the parliament, the president, members of the municipal councils and mayors, as well as delegates to the European Parliament. Lithuanian citizens can also vote in mandatory or consultative referendums. Lithuania was one of the first countries in the world to grant women a right to vote in the elections. Lithuanian women were allowed to vote by the 1918 Constitution of Lithuania and used their newly granted right for the first time in 1919. By doing so, Lithuania allowed it earlier than such democratic countries as the United States (1920), France (1945), and Switzerland (1971). 71 of the members in the 141-seat parliament, elected to a four-year term, are elected in single-seat constituencies, in a majority vote. The remaining 70 members are elected in a nationwide election based on proportional representation. The structure of the elections means that a large number of parties are represented in the parliament and coalition governments are common. The head of the state - the president - is elected to a five-year term in a majority vote, with the president eligible for up to two terms in office. More than 1500 municipal council members are elected in local elections to four-year terms, with the majority of the seats allocated using proportional representation and the mayors elected directly by residents in a majority vote. The Lithuanian representatives in the European Parliament, currently numbering 11, are elected using proportional representation every five years. 12 referendums have been organized in Lithuania, initiated by either citizens or the parliament. Of these, only four have seen the referendum question approved in a referendum deemed to have taken place. Voting in elections is generally open to all citizens of Lithuania who are at least 18 years of age. Citizens of other European Union countries that permanently reside in Lithuania can vote in the Lithuanian elections to the European Parliament. Voting in municipal elections is open to all residents of Lithuania, regardless of their citizenship. Voting process is organized by the Central Electoral Commission and subordinate electoral bodies and is monitored by local and international observers. The voters vote in a secret ballot and the elections have generally been assessed as free and fair, although allegations of irregularities have been common. == Elections to the Seimas == === Process and eligibility === Seimas Palace in VilniusThe parliament (Lietuvos Respublikos Seimas) has 141 members, elected to a four-year term, with 71 members elected in single-seat constituencies and 70 members elected by proportional representation. Lithuania exhibits a fragmented multi-party system, with a number of small parties in which coalition governments are common. Ordinary elections to the Seimas take place on the second Sunday of October. To be eligible for election, candidates must be at least 25 years old on the election day, not under allegiance to a foreign state and permanently reside in Lithuania. Persons serving or due to serve a sentence imposed by the court 65 days before the election are not eligible. Also, judges, citizens performing military service, and servicemen of professional military service and officials of statutory institutions and establishments may not stand for election. In addition, the Lithuanian law stipulates that a person who has been removed from office through impeachment may not be elected for four years after their removal, although the limit of four years has been suspended by the Lithuanian constitutional court, which stated that the Lithuanian constitution does not allow for persons impeached for a breach of constitution or their oath of office to stand in elections indefinitely. This provision of the constitution had been ruled to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Parliament members in the 71 single-seat constituencies are elected in a majority vote if the voter turnout in the constituency is at least 40%. If the voter turnout is less than 40%, the candidate with the most votes (and at least 20% of the votes) is declared a winner. If there are more than two candidates and no candidate wins in the first round, a second round of voting is held within 15 days. The two leading candidates from the first round are eligible for the second round of voting. The candidate that gets more votes in the second round is declared a winner, regardless of voter turnout. The remaining 70 seats are allocated to the participating political parties proportionally to the share of vote received, using the largest remainder method. Parties receiving less than 5% of the vote and joint multi- party electoral lists receiving less than 7% of the vote are not eligible to receive any seats, unless the remaining eligible parties received less than 60% of the vote. Candidates take the seats allocated to their parties based on the preference lists submitted before the election. The preference lists are adjusted by preference votes given by the voters. === Elections and results === Seven elections of the Seimas have been held in Lithuania since independence. The first election in independent Lithuania was held on 25 October 1992, with a run-off on 15 November. 24 parties and political movements contested the Seimas seats. The election was won by the (ex- communist) Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania, which gained 73 seats and 44% of the popular vote. Analysts attributed the victory to the support the party found among the Russian and Polish minorities, farmers, as well as to popular dissatisfaction with the economic situation, particularly the fuel shortage. Sąjūdis, which had led Lithuania into independence finished distant second with 30 seats. The 1996 parliamentary election was held on 20 October with the run-off on 10 November. This time, Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania suffered as a result of poor economic situation and financial scandals, including one involving former Prime Minister Adolfas Šleževičius. The election was won by the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Conservative Party, which gained 70 seats and 31% of the vote. Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party were distant second with 16 seats, followed by Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania with 12. The 2000 parliamentary election was held on 8 October. The election was held in the context of economic crisis brought about by Russian financial crisis of 1998, austerity and high-profile privatization. Liberal Union of Lithuania won the most seats of any party in the election, with 33, although a joint list \\"Social-Democratic Coalition of Algirdas Brazauskas\\" won the highest share of the popular vote with 31%. The Liberal Union formed the government with New Union (Social Liberals), Lithuanian Centre Union and the Modern Christian Democrats. The coalition was short-lived and Algirdas Brazauskas, a social democrat, became the prime minister less than a year later. The Social Democrats remained at the helm of the government after the 2004 parliamentary election, which was held on 10 October, with the run-off on 24 October. The party was the third-largest in the parliament after the election with 20 seats, behind Labour Party with 39 and Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives) with 25, but managed to govern together with New Union (Social Liberals) (11 seats), the Labour Party and the support of other parties. It was the first time since independence that a ruling government survived an election. The 2008 parliamentary election was held on 12 October, with a run-off on 26 October. Homeland Union won the election dominated by taxation and potential introduction of Euro. Rising inflation and potential economic downturn were also high on the agenda following several years of rapid growth. Homeland Union (45 seats) formed a coalition government with populist and short-lived National Resurrection Party (16 seats), Liberal Movement (11 seats) and Liberal and Centre Union (8 seats). Social Democrats was the largest party in opposition with 25 seats. The 2012 parliamentary election was held on 14 October, with a run-off on 28 October. The Social Democrats became the largest party in the Seimas and defeated the center-right coalition of Andrius Kubilius. The Social Democrats, with 38 seats, formed a government coalition with Labour Party (19 seats), Order and Justice (11 seats) and Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania (8 seats), with the latter party later withdrawing from the government. Homeland Union (33 seats) withdrew to the opposition after four years in government. The 2016 parliamentary election was held on 9 October, with a run-off on 23 October. The election was a surprise victory for Peasant and Greens Union, which won 54 seats in the parliament - the largest tally by a single party in Lithuania for 20 years. Homeland Union won the largest share of the vote (22.63%) and 20 mandates in the nationwide constituency, but a disappointing performance in single-member constituencies left the party a distant second with 31 seats. Peasants and Greens formed a coalition with the Social Democrats, who won 17 seats in the parliament. { class= style=text-align:right !rowspan=2Election !rowspan=2Turnout !colspan=3Largest party/list !colspan=32nd largest party/list !colspan=33rd largest party/list - ! !% !Seats ! !% !Seats ! !% !Seats - align=right199275.3%align=leftDemocratic Labour Party of Lithuania44%73align=leftSąjūdis21.2%30 align=leftCoalition: Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, Lithuanian Union of Political Prisoners and Deportees, Lithuanian Democratic Party 12.6%18 - align=right199652.9%align=leftHomeland Union - Lithuanian Conservatives31.34%70align=leftLithuanian Christian Democratic Party10.43%16align=leftDemocratic Labour Party of Lithuania10.01%12 - align=right200058.6%align=leftSocial-Democratic Coalition of Algirdas Brazauskas31.08%51align=leftLiberal Union of Lithuania17.25%33align=leftNew Union (Social Liberals)19.64%28 - align=right200446.1%align=leftLabour Party28.4%39align=leftWorking for Lithuania: Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, New Union (Social Liberals) 20.7%31align=leftHomeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives)14.8%25 - align=right200848.59%align=left Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats19.72%45align=leftSocial Democratic Party of Lithuania11.72%25align=leftNational Resurrection Party15.09%16 - align=right201252.93%align=leftSocial Democratic Party of Lithuania18.37%38align=leftHomeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats15.08%33align=leftLabour Party19.82%29 - align=right201650.64%align=leftLithuanian Peasant and Greens Union22.45%54align=leftHomeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats22.63%31align=leftSocial Democratic Party of Lithuania15.04%17 }  Results of the 2016 election  { class= style=text-align:right !rowspan=3 colspan=2Party !colspan=3 rowspan=2Nationwide constituency !colspan=6Single-member constituencies !rowspan=3Total seats !rowspan=3+/– - !colspan=3First round !colspan=3Second round - !Votes !%Percentage share of valid votes; Lithuanian Central Electoral Committee present figures including both valid and invalid votes. !Seats !Votes !% !Seats !Votes !% !Seats - style=\\"background-color: \\"  align=leftHomeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats276,27522.6320258,83421.571246,10827.941031–2 - style=\\"background-color: \\"  align=leftLithuanian Peasant and Greens Union274,10822.4519229,76919.150311,61135.383554+53 - style=\\"background-color: \\"  align=leftSocial Democratic Party of Lithuania183,59715.0413183,26715.270115,59913.12417–21 - style=\\"background-color: \\"  align=leftLiberal Movement115,3619.458139,52211.63070,0557.95614+4 -  align=leftAnti-Corruption Coalition (LCP–LPP)77,1146.32036,6213.0506,8760.7811New - style=\\"background-color: \\"  align=leftElectoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance69,8105.72563,2915.27213,5261.54180 - style=\\"background-color: \\"  align=leftOrder and Justice67,8175.55570,9585.91028,8943.2838–3 - style=\\"background-color: \\"  align=leftLabour Party59,6204.88079,8246.65025,8032.9322–27 -  align=leftLithuanian Freedom Union (Liberals)27,2742.23039,9873.33010,1301.1500New - style=\\"background-color: \\"  align=leftLithuanian Green Party24,7272.03011,0470.9205,6270.6411New - style=\\"background-color: #9c0000\\"  align=leftPolitical Party \\"Lithuanian List\\"21,9661.80017,5191.4608,7090.9911New -  align=leftLithuanian People's Party12,8511.0509,7670.810–––00 -  align=leftAgainst Corruption and Poverty (JL–LTS)6,8670.5604,1500.350–––0New - style=\\"background-color: \\"  align=leftThe Way of Courage3,4980.2904,6190.380–––0–7 - colspan=2 style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Independents–––50,7384.23037,9194.3044+1 - colspan=2 align=leftInvalid/blank votes52,469––72,789––32,895–––– - colspan=2 align=leftTotal1,273,427100701,272,7341003913,752100681410 - colspan=2 align=leftRegistered voters/turnout2,514,65750.64–2,514,65750.61–2,405,14337.99––– - align=left colspan=13Source: Central Electoral Commission } == Presidential elections == === Election process and eligibility === The President of Lithuania is the head of state of the country, elected to a five- year term in a majority vote.

The two leading candidates from the first round are eligible for the second round of voting and the candidate that gets more votes in the second round is declared a winner. If two or fewer candidates stand for election and none manage to win in the first round, a new election is held no more than three months after the election date. === Elections and results === Six presidential elections have taken place in Lithuania since independence. Algirdas Brazauskas, a former communist party leader, was the first elected president of independent Lithuania. Election took place on 14 February 1993, with Brazauskas defeating Stasys Lozoraitis, a Lithuanian diplomat, who had spent almost all his life in Italy and the United States representing interwar Lithuania. Brazauskas won with 60% of the vote. Brazauskas did not stand in the 1997-1998 presidential election, held on 21 December 1997, with the second round on 4 January 1998. In the election, Artūras Paulauskas, a former Prosecutor General of Lithuania won the first round with 44.7% of the vote, but was defeated in the second round by Valdas Adamkus, a former US civil servant, who got 50% of the vote compared to 49.2% by Paulauskas. Adamkus stood for reelection in the Lithuanian presidential election, 2002–2003, which took place 22 December 2002, with the second round on 5 January 2003. After leading in the first round with 35.1% of the vote, Adamkus was convincingly defeated in the second round by Rolandas Paksas, a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Vilnius who received 54.2% of the vote. Rolandas Paksas was subsequently impeached and removed from office, prompting early election in 2004. Valdas Adamkus became the first President of Lithuania to be elected for a second term, leading the first round with 30.2% of the vote and defeating Kazimiera Prunskienė in the second round with 51.8%. Valdas Adamkus was not eligible to stand for reelection in 2009 due to term limits. In the election that took place on 17 May 2009, European Commissioner Dalia Grybauskaitė won in the first round with more than 68% of the vote. Grybauskaitė became the country's first female president. Grybauskaite was reelected in the 2014 presidential election that took place on 11 May 2014, with a second round held on 25 May. Grybauskaitė received 45.9% of vote in the first round and defeated Zigmantas Balčytis in the second round with 57.9% of all votes. She became the first president of Lithuania to be reelected for a second consecutive term. { class= style=text-align:right !rowspan=2Election !colspan=2Turnout, % !colspan=3Winner, vote % !colspan=3Runner-up, vote % - !First round !Second round ! !First round !Second round ! !First round !Second round - align=right199378.07-align=leftAlgirdas Brazauskas60.03-align=leftStasys Lozoraitis38.28- - align=right1997-199871.4573.66align=leftValdas Adamkus27.5649.96align=leftArtūras Paulauskas44.7349.22 - align=right2002-200353.9252.65align=leftRolandas Paksas19.4054.15align=leftValdas Adamkus35.0644.83 - align=right200448.4052.46align=leftValdas Adamkus30.1851.83align=leftKazimiera Prunskienė20.6046.66 - align=right200951.76-align=leftDalia Grybauskaitė68.21-align=leftAlgirdas Butkevičius11.68- - align=right201452.2347.37align=leftDalia Grybauskaitė45.9257.90align=leftZigmantas Balčytis13.6240.10 }  Results of the 2014 election  { class= style=text- align:right - !rowspan=2Candidate !rowspan=2Party !colspan=2First round !colspan=2Second round - !Votes !% !Votes !% - align=leftDalia Grybauskaitėalign=leftIndependent612,48545.92701,99957.90 - align=leftZigmantas Balčytisalign=leftSocial Democratic Party of Lithuania181,65913.62486,21440.10 - align=leftArtūras Paulauskasalign=leftLabour Party160,13912.01colspan=2 rowspan=5 - align=leftNaglis Puteikisalign=leftIndependent124,3339.32 - align=leftValdemar Tomaševskialign=leftElectoral Action of Poles in Lithuania109,6598.22 - align=leftArtūras Zuokasalign=leftYES69,6775.22 - align=leftBronis Ropėalign=leftLithuanian Peasant and Greens Union55,2634.14 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Invalid/blank votes20,4511.5324,1611.99 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Total1,333,6661001,212,374100 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Registered voters/turnout2,553,33552.232,559,39847.37 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\" colspan=\\"6\\"Source: } == Municipal elections == === Election process and eligibility === Each municipality in Lithuania is governed by a municipal council and a mayor, who is a member of the municipal council. The number of members, elected on a four-year term, in each municipal council depends on the size of the municipality and varies from 15 (in municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents) to 51 (in municipalities with more than 500,000 residents). 1,524 municipal council members were elected in 2015. Members of the council, with the exception of the mayor, are elected using proportional representation. Starting with 2015, the mayor is elected directly by the majority of residents of the municipality. Before 2015, the mayors were elected by the municipal councils. Ordinary elections take place on a date proclaimed by the parliament no earlier than two months and no later than a month before the end of the current term. To be eligible for election, candidates must be at least 20 years old on the election day and permanently reside in the respective municipality. Persons serving or due to serve a sentence imposed by the court 65 days before the election are not eligible. Also, residents performing military service, and servicemen of professional military service and officials of statutory institutions and establishments may not stand for election. The mayor is elected in a majority vote if the voter turnout in the constituency is at least 40%. If the voter turnout is less than 40%, the candidate with the most votes (and at least 20% of the votes) is declared a winner. If there are more than two candidates and no candidate wins in the first round, a second round of voting is held within 15 days. The two leading candidates from the first round are eligible for the second round of voting. The candidate that gets more votes in the second round is declared a winner, regardless of voter turnout. Council seats (other than the seat of the mayor) are allocated to the participating political parties proportionally to the share of vote received. Parties receiving less than 4% of the vote and joint multi-party electoral lists receiving less than 6% of the vote are not eligible to receive any seats, unless the remaining eligible parties received less than 60% of the vote. Candidates take the seats allocated to their parties based on the preference lists submitted before the election. The preference lists are adjusted by preference votes given by the voters. === Elections and results === { class= style=text- align:right !rowspan=2Election !rowspan=2Turnout, % !rowspan=2Total mandates !colspan=2Largest party !colspan=22nd largest party !colspan=23rd largest party !rowspan=2Source - ! !Seats ! !Seats ! !Seats - 199544.851488align=leftHomeland Union - Lithuanian Conservatives428align=leftDemocratic Labour Party of Lithuania297align=leftLithuanian Christian Democratic Party247align=left - 199735.60Only includes turnout by 19:00 on election day, does not include votes by post or early voting1459align=leftHomeland Union - Lithuanian Conservatives493align=leftDemocratic Labour Party of Lithuania212align=leftLithuanian Christian Democratic Party180align=left - 200049.631562align=leftNew Union (Social Liberals)270align=leftLithuanian Peasant Union209align=leftHomeland Union - Lithuanian Conservatives199align=left - 200249.231560align=leftSocial Democratic Party of Lithuania332align=leftHomeland Union - Lithuanian Conservatives193align=leftUnion of Peasant and New Democracy Parties190align=left - 200741.301550align=leftSocial Democratic Party of Lithuania302align=leftHomeland Union - Conservatives, Political Prisoners and Deportees, Christian Democrats256align=leftLiberal and Centre Union182align=left - 201144.081550align=leftSocial Democratic Party of Lithuania328align=leftHomeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats249align=leftLabour Party165align=left } Direct elections for mayor were introduced in 2015. { class= style=text- align:right !rowspan=2Election !rowspan=2Turnout, % !rowspan=2Total mandates !rowspan=2Mayor mandates !colspan=3Largest party !colspan=32nd largest party !colspan=33rd largest party !rowspan=2Source - ! !Total seats !Mayors ! !Total seats !Mayors ! !Total seats !Mayors - 201547.18152359align=leftSocial Democratic Party of Lithuania37216align=leftHomeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats25811align=leftLiberal Movement2259align=left } == European elections == === Election process and eligibility === Lithuania joined the European Union in 2004. In the same year, the first election took place for 13 seats in the European Parliament allocated to Lithuania. As of 2014, the number of seats allocated to Lithuania was 11, down from 12 in 2009. Members of the parliament are elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. Ordinary elections take place on a Sunday on the same day as in other EU countries. Early voting is available during Wednesday and Thursday before the election. Mail-in voting and at-home voting is available for eligible voters. The vote is open to all citizens of Lithuania, as well as citizens of other EU countries that permanently reside in Lithuania, who are at least 18 years old on the election day. To be eligible for election, candidates must be at least 21 years old on the election day, citizen of Lithuania or citizen of another EU country permanently residing in Lithuania. Candidates are not allowed to stand for election in more than one country. Persons serving or due to serve a sentence imposed by the court 65 days before the election are not eligible. Also, judges, citizens performing military service, and servicemen of professional military service and officials of statutory institutions and establishments may not stand for election. The seats are allocated to the participating political parties or lists proportionally to the share of vote received. Parties or lists receiving less than 5% of the vote are not eligible to receive any seats, unless the remaining eligible parties received less than 60% of the vote. Candidates take the seats allocated to their parties based on the preference lists submitted before the election. The preference lists are adjusted by preference votes given by the voters. === Elections and results === Three elections to the European Parliament have taken place in Lithuania. Election in 2004 took place on 13 June 2004, together with the second round of the presidential election, resulting in a relatively high turnout of 48%. As with later elections, the election campaign in 2004 centered around domestic issues and not European policies, and populist parties featured prominently. The election was a disappointment for the governing Social Democrats, who received only 2 of the 13 seats, and their partners in the government, New Union (Social Liberals), who failed to win a seat. The biggest winners in the election were the populist Labor Party, who contested their first national election and walked away with 5 seats in the European Parliament. Election in 2009 took place on 7 June 2009. The onset of the financial crisis after years of economic growth led to economic and social security issues dominating the election agenda, despite the limited influence the European Parliament has over the economy of Lithuania. The election took place just three weeks after the presidential election and achieved a voter turnout of only 21% - the lowest turnout in any elections in post-communist Lithuania and one of the lowest in Europe. The election was a success for the governing Homeland Union, which increased its share of vote to more than 26%, up from 19.7% in the parliamentary election six months before. Homeland Union won 4 seats in the European Parliament, compared to 3 achieved by opposition Social Democrats. Election in 2014 took place on 25 May 2014. In a close election, governing Social Democrats and Order and Justice parties, as well as opposition Homeland Union and Liberal Movement won two seats each, with Homeland Union getting the highest share of the vote - 17.43%. The election was held together with the run-off of the presidential election, leading to a turnout of over 47%. { class= style=text-align:right !rowspan=3Political party/list !colspan=6Election - !colspan=22004 !colspan=22009 !colspan=22014 - !Seats !% of votes !Seats !% of votes !Seats !% of votes - align=leftLabour Party530.1618.56112.38 - align=leftSocial Democratic Party of Lithuania214.43318.12217.26 - align=leftHomeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats212.58426.16217.43 - align=leftLiberal and Centre Union211.23-3.38-1.48 - align=leftLithuanian Peasant and Greens Union17.41-1.8216.61 - align=leftElectoral Action of Poles in Lithuania-5.7118.2018.05 - align=leftOrder and Justice--211.90214.25 - align=leftLiberal Movement--17.17216.55 - align=left style=\\"background: #E9E9E9;\\"Total seats colspan=2 style=\\"background: #E9E9E9;\\" align=center13 colspan=2 style=\\"background: #E9E9E9;\\" align=center12 colspan=2 style=\\"background: #E9E9E9;\\" align=center11 - align=left style=\\"background: #E9E9E9;\\"Voter Turnout colspan=2 style=\\"background: #E9E9E9;\\" align=center48.32% colspan=2 style=\\"background: #E9E9E9;\\" align=center20.98% colspan=2 style=\\"background: #E9E9E9;\\" align=center47.35% } == Referendums == Two types of referendums can take place in Lithuania: mandatory referendums and consultative (advisory) referendums. Mandatory referendums must be held on these questions: # to amend Chapters I (The State of Lithuania) and XIV (Amending the Constitution) of the Constitution of Lithuania # to amend the June 8, 1992 Constitutional Act, \\"On Non-Alignment of the Republic of Lithuania to Post-Soviet Eastern Alliances\\" # to approve participation in international organizations if membership requires partial transfer of powers from state institutions A polling station in Lithuania on the 1991 Referendum day. Mandatory and consultative referendums can also be held on any other question if the proposal to hold the referendum is supported by at least 300,000 voters or the referendum is called by at least one quarter of all members of the parliament. The referendum is deemed to have taken place if more than half of the registered voters participate. The referendum question in a mandatory referendum is adopted if approved by more than half of all citizens participating in the referendum but no less than 1/3 of all citizens registered to vote. The following exceptions exist: * The provision of Article 1 of the Constitution (\\"The State of Lithuania is an independent, democratic Republic\\"), and the Constitutional Act of June 8, 1992 can only be amended upon approval of at least 3/4 of all citizens registered to vote. * Chapters I and XIV of the Constitution can only be amended upon approval of at least half of all citizens registered to vote. * Questions regarding participation in international organizations are adopted if approved by more than half of voters participating in the referendum. Questions in a consultative referendum are approved if supported by more than half of all citizens participating in the referendum. The parliament should then agree on the implementation of the question within one month. The parliament may still take into account the results of a consultative referendum even if it is invalid due to low participation. A total of 12 separate referendums have been organized in Lithuania (some of them with several referendum questions). Of these, four have seen the referendum question approved in a referendum deemed to have taken place. In February 1991, Lithuanian voter approved the independence of Lithuania from Soviet Union with 90.2% of voters participating (76.5% of voters eligible) voting in favor. In June 1992, the voters demanded through referendum an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops and compensation for damages from the Soviet Union. In October 1992 the Lithuanian Constitution was approved. In 2003, the Lithuanian membership in the European Union was approved 90% of participating voters (57% of all eligible voters). == Voting process == === Voters and voter lists === The minimum voting age in Lithuania is 18. Voting in elections for the parliament and the president, as well as participation in referendums is open to citizens of Lithuania. Voting in elections to the European Parliament is open to citizens of Lithuania, as well as citizens of other EU countries permanently residing in Lithuania, as long as they only vote in one country. Voting in local elections is limited to permanent residents of the respective municipalities, regardless of citizenship. Individuals who have been declared mentally incompetent by court are barred from voting. Voter lists or electoral rolls are compiled before each vote by the Central Electoral Commission. The electoral rolls should include every person eligible to vote, and include information about the person necessary to establish eligibility, such as name, surname, personal number, date of birth, passport or other ID number, as well as place of residence. The electoral roll of the Republic of Lithuania then forms the basis for electoral rolls of single-member constituencies and polling districts, that contain information necessary for individuals to vote. Electoral rolls are not public but voters may access information related to themselves in the electoral roll. Before the election, a poll card is sent to each voter, representing an invitation to vote. It may also be accessed and printed online. Citizens of Lithuania who do not reside in Lithuania but are entitled to vote, for example in the elections for the parliament, are entered in electoral rolls for the constituency in the territory where the parliament is situated. Voters who are aboard a ship and will not be able to return to Lithuania to vote, are entered on the electoral roll of the polling district on whose electoral roll the ship’s crew is entered. Voters who are in a penal institution and have not declared a place of residence, are entered on the electoral roll of the polling district where the penal institution is situated. === Candidates === The eligibility criteria for candidates varies depending on the election type and is covered more thoroughly above. Parties file the application and place the election deposits for their candidates in multi-seat and single-seat constituencies with the Central Electoral Commission, including providing all necessary additional information, such as tax returns. Individual candidates who nominate themselves file the application and place the deposits with the electoral commission of the constituency where they stand for election. The names of candidates and party lists are announced 30 days before the election. Upon announcement, the candidates in constituencies have equal rights to speak at voters' meetings or any other meetings, gatherings, conferences as well as through the state mass media, and to announce their respective election programmes. In addition, a candidate for the parliament gains immunity and may not be arrested without the consent of the Central Electoral Commission. === Election campaigns === Candidates have a right to campaign in fair manner and can be granted the right to use the Lithuanian National Radio and Television free of charge. The Central Electoral Commission distributes the time of the broadcasts in such a manner that the principle of equality is preserved. Debates on radio and television are financed by the state. Election programmes are published by the Central Electoral Commission for country-wide parties and candidates and the electoral committee of that constituency or municipality for local candidates. Political advertising is prohibited on the buildings of state administration, law-enforcement and other state and municipal institutions and establishments, vehicles belonging to state or municipal enterprises, motorways, streets and along them if it might interfere with traffic safety, sculptures and monuments.

With few exceptions, the voter must vote in the polling district where he or she is registered. At the entrance to the polling station, voters present their passports or other identity documents to an electoral committee member of the polling district.

The election observers and representatives of the media may participate in the counting of votes in polling districts and constituencies or municipalities, and also in the establishment of election results. Observers shall have the right to make remarks and claims to the electoral committees concerning violations of laws, but may not hinder the work of electoral committees. Observers can make written protests to the polling district committee, which is appended to the vote counting record of the polling district and delivered to the constituency electoral committee.

The Constitutional Court shall investigate and evaluate the decisions of the Central Electoral Commission within 72 hours. The Seimas may then declare the elections invalid or establish real election results if records are available. === Monitoring and assessment === Elections in Lithuania have been assessed as generally free and fair by domestic and international monitors, although voting irregularities and allegations of vote-buying have occurred, although OSCE highlight the overly broad interpretation of a definition of vote-buying as a possible explanation of the scale of allegations. Parties and candidates have the right to appoint election observers to each polling district. Observers have the right to observe elections, monitor voting and demand adherence to the election laws. 15-20 thousand observers observe the elections. A citizen initiative \\"white gloves\\" (Lithuanian: \\"baltosios pirštinės\\") was formed after the allegations of vote-buying in the 2012 election to Seimas and provide additional monitoring and reporting. ==See also== * Electoral calendar * Electoral system ==Notes== == References == ==External links== *Adam Carr's Election Archive *Parties and elections *Central Elections Commission of Lithuania ","title":"Elections in Lithuania"},{"id":"1442291","text":"The Mycological Society of America (MSA) is a learned society that serves as the professional organization of mycologists in the U.S. and Canada.

He was part of the group of Dutch and Flemish genre painters active in Rome in the 17th century known as the bamboccianti, who painted scenes from the everyday life of the lower classes in Rome and its countryside.Ludovica Trezzani. \\"Both.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 23 June 2017 ==Life== Both, pronounced , was born in Utrecht, the son of a glass painter. He studied under Abraham Bloemaert. His brother Jan was a genre and landscape painter. Andries resided in Rouen in 1633 and later traveled on to Rome where his presence is documented from 1635 to 1641. He first shared a studio with a fellow painter from Utrecht, Jan van Causteren. In 1638 his brother joined him. The brothers lived on the Via Vittoria in the parish of San Lorenzo in Lucina and both may have joined the Accademia di San Luca and the group of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists active in Rome called the Bentvueghels.Andries Both in the RKD Peasants in an interior In 1641 the brothers left Rome to travel back to the Netherlands. Andries died in Venice by drowning in a canal as he was returning from some festivities. ==Work== His work is noted for its humorous and outrageous quality, mixed with objectivity and harsh reality, depicting the seamier side of Italian life with broad strokes. The style, known as Bambocciata, after the nickname of its originator, the Dutch painter Pieter van Laer, who was known in Rome as il bamboccio,, which means \\"ugly doll\\" or \\"puppet\\". This was an allusion to van Laer's ungainly appearance, as he is said to have had unusually long legs, short chest and almost no neck.David A. Levine (December 1988). The Roman Limekilns of the Bamboccianti. The Art Bulletin (College Art Association) 70 (4): 569–589 These Bambocciata works were informed by existing traditions of depicting peasant subjects from 16th-century Netherlandish art. They were generally small cabinet paintings or etchings of the everyday life of the lower classes in Rome and its countryside., pp. 132–134. Andries Both's low- life genre paintings were also influenced by the older tradition of Pieter Brueghel the Elder as well as that of the Flemish genre painter Adriaen Brouwer who had worked in the Dutch Republic for an extensive period in the 1620s. ==List of known paintings== Sitting peasant couple *Scene in a brothel (Formerly also known as 'the return of the prodigal son'); Canvas, 44 x 51 cm **Bredius Museum; Inv.nr. 116-1946, Cat.nr.21 *Travellers by a Well (1635–1641); wood **NGV International, The Art Foundation of Victoria; accession no.

In 1665–66, Lubomirski's supporters paralyzed the proceedings of the Sejm. Lubomirski himself, with the support of part of the army and the levée en masse (pospolite ruszenie), defeated royal forces, at the Battle of Matwy (1666). The rebellion ended with the Agreement of Łęgonice, which forced the King to give up his planned reforms and the introduction of vivente-rege royal elections. Lubomirski himself, now a broken man, died soon after. == Background == The mid-17th century was one of the most tragic and difficult periods in the history of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The country was devastated by several wars, such as the Khmelnytsky Uprising and the Swedish invasion of Poland. Its international position was weakened, and the chaos was deepened by the ill-functioning system of nobles' democracy (see szlachta privileges, Golden Liberty). In 1652 a Lithuanian deputy to the Sejm, Wladyslaw Sicinski, for the first time in Polish history used the liberum veto, voiding a bill that was about to be introduced. The country was riven by internal conflicts among the magnates, and its central institutions did not function. King John II Casimir Vasa was aware of the condition of the Polish–Lithuanian state and initiated an attempt to reform its institutions. In 1658, he introduced a program of improvement of the government, which stipulated, among others, voting by majority, creating a government and general tax system. The Polish Senate tentatively agreed to the reforms, creating a special commission. The problem was the issue of the royal election (see Royal elections in Poland) – the king and his supporters wanted to introduce the Vivente rege system, while his opponents disagreed. The King and his wife Marie Louise Gonzaga began to look for supporters among the nobility and the magnates. Their opponents, acting on the initiative of Habsburg envoy Franz Paul de Lisola, created their own camp, with such members as Greater Poland's Łukasz Opaliński and Jan Leszczyński, as well as Lesser Poland's Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski. As a result, all attempts at the reform were defeated. == The rebellion == During the 1661 Sejm, the King urged all envoys to support extra taxes, needed to carry out election reform and pay the unpaid soldiers of the army. In response, the magnates opposed royal proposal, and upon inspiration of Lubomirski, a confederation called Holy Alliance was created both in the Kingdom of Poland and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Members of the confederation, which consisted mostly of unpaid soldiers, demanded their money. They were supported by some members of the nobility, who above all wanted to keep their ancient privileges, opposed any reforms and wanted to keep the so-called free royal election. Not all soldiers and nobility supported the rebellion – those who remained loyal to the King, under Stefan Czarniecki, created their own confederation, the so-called Pious Alliance. The 1662 Sejm opposed all attempts of reform of the government, allowing only to introduce extra tax for the army. The King, however, did not give up. Aware that Jerzy Lubomirski was the main source of his problems, in 1664 accused the magnate of treason. Sejm court found Lubomirski guilty, confiscated his properties, sentenced him to infamy and ordered to leave Poland. Lubomirski left for Habsburg-controlled Silesia, where he tried to organize an army (with financial support of the Habsburgs) to invade the territories of Poland controlled by the Royal Army. In 1665 Lubomirski announced a rebellion, and his army entered the Commonwealth. On 13 July 1666 he faced royal army under the King himself. Lubomirski's forces were victorious. After the battle, elite regiments, consisting of best soldiers of the Polish Army were murdered by the rebels (altogether, the army lost almost 4,000 of its most experienced men). On 31 July, at the village of Legowice, the King and Lubomirski signed an agreement. John II Casimir gave up his plans of a reform and declared amnesty for the rebels, while Lubomirski signed a letter of apology. In 1668, under the pressure of the Polish Parliament, the nobility and because of the sudden death of the Queen, the King abdicated. == Sources == * ==See also== * Rokosz * Confederation (konfederacja) * Zebrzydowski's Rokosz * Chicken War Category:Rebellions in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:17th-century rebellions Category:1665 in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:1666 in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth ","title":"Lubomirski's rebellion"},{"id":"1442307","text":"Kevin Hearn and Thin Buckle (originally Kevin Hearn and the Thin Buckle Band) are a Canadian band consisting of Barenaked Ladies multi-instrumentalist Kevin Hearn as the front man (typically on guitar or keyboards), bassist Chris Gartner and drummer Great Bob Scott.

The band has always had a sporadic live schedule, due in part to Hearn's touring commitments with Barenaked Ladies. Similarly, albums have often had wide gaps between recording and release (for example, Night Light was recorded in the summer of 2002, but not officially released until 2004). Their live performances are most commonly in the Toronto area, as the band members all reside in the city. Tours are infrequent, but have occurred; an example is a late-2004 tour through Canada, and the American northeast for which Hearn opened his own shows with his cousin Harland Williams playing material as the duo's album, \\"The Cousins\\". His shows are often informal, with any members of the band who are available joining Hearn, and others absent. Hearn plays solo sets within many shows. Musicians who are in the audience are often invited to perform as guests. Hearn's concerts typically include material from both his solo and Thin Buckle albums, songs he's written for Barenaked Ladies, and Hearn's songs from The Story of Harmelodia, as well as frequent covers of other artists. ==Discography== *H-Wing – 2001 *Night Light – 2004 *The Miracle Mile – 2006 *Havana Winter – 2009 ===Related albums=== The following albums contain songs by Hearn that the band currently plays. *Mothball Mint – 1997 (Hearn's debut solo album) *The Story of Harmelodia – 1999 (Rheostatics release featuring Kevin Hearn) *Cloud Maintenance – 2011 (Hearn's second solo album) == References == Category:Canadian alternative rock groups ","title":"Kevin Hearn and Thin Buckle"},{"id":"1442310","text":"Tuman or Tumen may refer to: * Tumen River, a river between China and North Korea * Tuman River, a river in Shufu County, Xinjiang, China * Tuman (Soviet patrol boat), a 1931 Soviet World War II warship * Tuman bay II (died 1517), medieval Egyptian sultan * Tuman monastery, a monastery in eastern Serbia * Tuman Tumanian (1879–1906), participant of the Armenian national liberation movement * Tuman (album), by Sofia Rotaru * \\"Tuman\\" (song), by the Russian band Kommunizm == See also == * Iranian toman, an Iranian currency * Teoman, a Turkish given name used for Touman, leader of a nomadic tribe in Asia * Tuman bay (disambiguation) * Tumandar, a title given to the leader of a Baloch or Pashtoon tribe in Pakistan * Tumen (disambiguation) * Tyumen, a city in Russia ","title":"Tuman"},{"id":"1442313","text":"Halifax at RAF Snaith Halifax crew hand in their parachutes after a raid on the Ruhr First British RC-135W (ZZ664) arrives at Waddington in November 2013 No. 51 Squadron of the Royal Air Force most recently operated the Nimrod R1 from RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire until June 2011.\\"Nimrod R1 makes final flight\\" Defence Management Journal, 28 June 2011.

Crews from No. 51 Squadron trained alongside the United States Air Force on the RC-135W Rivet Joint, which entered service with the RAF in 2014 under the Airseeker project. ==History== ===World War I=== 51 Squadron Royal Flying Corps flew B.E.2 and B.E.12 aircraft; the squadron formed at Thetford, Norfolk, before moving its headquarters to the airfield that later became RAF Marham. The squadron's primary role during the First World War was defence of the UK against German Zeppelin raids. It also used the Avro 504K to give night flying training to new pilots. The squadron disbanded in 1919. ===Interwar years=== The squadron was reborn when 'B' Flight of 58 Squadron was renumbered as 51 Squadron at Driffield in March 1937, flying Virginias and Ansons. At this time the squadron badge was being chosen and a goose was chosen as a play on words: the squadron was flying the Anson and the Latin for goose is Anser. It was also appropriate for a bomber unit to have a heavy wild fowl to represent it.Moyes 1976, p. 78. ===World War II=== 51 Squadron dropped leaflets over Germany on the very first night of the Second World War, using the Whitley aircraft; bombs replaced leaflets in early 1940. A brief period as part of Coastal Command patrolling against the U-Boats in the Bay of Biscay preceded the re-equipment with the Halifax in 1942. 51 spent the rest of the war in Europe flying as part of No. 4 Group RAF, RAF Bomber Command's strategic bombing offensive against the Nazis, operating from RAF Snaith in East Yorkshire. ===Postwar=== The squadron became part of Transport Command with Stirlings and later Yorks following the end of the European war, transporting men and material to India and the Far East. The squadron disbanded in 1950, after taking part in the Berlin Airlift. The squadron again reformed in the 'Special Duties' role when No. 192 Squadron RAF was renumbered at RAF Watton on 21 August 1958, moving to nearby Wyton in April 1963.Lake 2001, p. 130–131. It was only following the end of the Cold War that the signals intelligence role of the squadron was publicly recognised. Signals intelligence encompasses both Electronic Intelligence (Elint) and Communications Intelligence (Comint). The squadron flew this role using de Havilland Comets. The Comets were replaced by a modified version of the Hawker-Siddeley Nimrod in 1974. One of the three Nimrods on strength was retired at the end of November 2009 with the other two remaining in service until June 2011. The Nimrods were replaced by three Boeing RC-135W Rivet Joint aircraft. In January 2011 personnel from 51 Squadron began training at Offutt Air Force Base in the US for conversion to the RC-135. Crews were to be deployed on joint missions with the USAF 343rd Reconnaissance Squadron until the new aircraft became available. The first RC135W (ZZ664) was delivered to the Royal Air Force on 12 November 2013, and entered operational service in 2014, taking part in Operation Shader against ISIL in Iraq and Syria. ==Aircraft operated== Aircraft operated have included: *B.E.2 *B.E.12 *FE2b *Martynside Elephant G.100 *Avro 504K *Sopwith Camel *Vickers Virginia Mk10 *Avro Anson Mk1 *Armstrong Whitworth Whitley Mk 2–5 *Handley Page Halifax Mk B2 and B3 *Short Stirling Mk5 *Avro York *de Havilland Comet Mk2R *English Electric Canberra B2 *Hastings C1 *Nimrod R1 *Boeing RC-135W Rivet Joint ==See also== *Other Nimrod squadrons **No. 42 (Reserve) Squadron – Nimrod OCU **No. 120 Squadron **No. 201 Squadron **No. 206 Squadron *List of Royal Air Force aircraft squadrons *No. 51 Squadron RAF Regiment ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== *Ford, Keith S.

In 1518 Velázquez sent Olid to relieve Juan de Grijalva, but en route a hurricane caused the loss of Olid's anchors, and he returned to Cuba. On January 10, 1519, Olid sailed with Hernán Cortés's fleet, as his quartermaster, and took an active part in the conquest of Mexico.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, He fought at the Battle of Otumba on 14 July 1520, and also took part in the campaign against the Purépechas. During the Siege of Tenochtitlan, Cristóbal was one of Cortés' key captains, playing a critical role in the capture of Xochimilco. Cristobal was the Texcoco camp commander during the trial of Antonio de Villafana, for his plot to assassinate Cortes. Cristobal commanded one of four forces under Cortes, and acted as quartermaster. Olid helped save Cortes at one point, when he was seized by the Mexicans in one of the causeway battles. Cortés sent Olid to Michoacan, after he had married a Portuguese lady. In 1522, Olid led Spanish soldiers with Tlaxcalan allies in the conquests of Jalisco and Colima in West Mexico .Cristóbal de Olid, 1522 In 1523, Cortés made Olid the leader of an expedition to conquer Honduras, but while resupplying in Havana, Olid (at a suggestion by Velázquez) declared his independence from New Spain and set out to conquer Honduras for himself. Landing east of Puerto Caballos, he founded the settlement of Triunfo de la Cruz. Many of Olid's supporters moved to Naco, where there was good agricultural land and gold. When Cortés learnt of Olid's rebellion, he sent Francisco de Las Casas against Olid with two warships. Despite the fact that both these ships were destroyed in a storm and many of his soldiers defected to Olid, Las Casas defeated Olid in battle and captured him. Accounts of how Olid died vary; Bernal Díaz del Castillo asserts in his Verdadera Historia de la Conquista de Nueva España that Las Casas had him beheaded at Naco, while Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas wrote that Olid's own soldiers rose up against and then murdered him. ==See also== * Gonzalo de Sandoval * Pedro de Alvarado ==References== Category:1487 births Category:1524 deaths Category:People from Zaragoza Category:Spanish conquistadors Category:Colonial Mexico Category:16th-century Spanish people Category:Aztec Category:History of the Aztecs ","title":"Cristóbal de Olid"},{"id":"1442321","text":"H-Wing is the first album by Kevin Hearn and Thin Buckle.

The Constitution of Malta mentions the institute of referendum only in Article 66, sub-articles 3 and 4 (and even then implicitly). Those sub-articles requires that a bill be \\"[...] submitted to the electors [...] and the majority of the electors voting have approved the bill\\" in case it modifies: * sub-article defining the length of parliamentary term to be five years (article 76, sub-article 2), or * sub- articles defining this procedure (article 66, sub-articles 3 and 4) Such referendum is binding. This type of referendum has never taken place. The other categories of referendums are regulated by the Referenda Act. \\"Consultative\\" referendums (the Act does not use the term) can either take place prior to the assent of a bill in the House of Representatives or following the parliamentary procedure in a form of a conditional clause in the said bill. In the former case it would not legally bind Parliament to approve the said legislation irrelevant of the result of the said referendum, however the latter case, it would be conventionally binding on the President to promulgate the bill into law. There has been six referendums like this on a national level, one on a regional level (1973 Gozo Civic Council referendum) and a number of local referendums organised by single Local Councils. An abrogative referendum has never been held and, if invoked and successful, can abrogate pieces of legislation barring some exceptions, notably financial and constitutional law. There was a total of 6 national referendums in Malta. Of those, 3 referendums were held while Malta was a British crown colony. Those were referendums on: * eligibility of clergy to sit in the Council of Government in 1870 * integration with United Kingdom in 1956 * independence from United Kingdom in 1964 Three referendums were held in independent Malta: * European Union membership referendum in 2003 * referendum on divorce in 2011 * referendum on spring hunting in 2015 There was also one local referendum in 1973 in region of Gozo. All seven were non-binding on the colonial and independent government.

Universal suffrage was introduced in 1951,Past Election Results 1952 - 2009 Caribbean Elections and the 1952 elections were the first in which all adults on the island could vote. They saw the Montserrat Labour Party win all five elected seats in the Legislative Council. The MLP subsequently won elections in 1955, 1958, 1961 (when the Council was expanded to seven seats) and 1966. The 1970 elections saw the new Progressive Democratic Party (PDP) win all seven seats. The PDP also won the 1973 elections, but was defeated in 1978 when the People's Liberation Movement (PLM) won all seven seats. The PLM went on to win the 1983 and 1987 elections. The 1991 elections were won by the National Progressive Party, which won four of the seven seats. The 1996 elections resulted in a hung parliament, with the People's Progressive Alliance (PPA) and Movement for National Reconstruction (MNR) holding two seats, the NPP holding one, and the remaining seats taken by two independents. The island's first coalition government was formed by the MNR, NPP and an independent MP. A new electoral system was introduced for the 2001 elections as a result of the volcanic eruptions rendering four of the seven constituencies uninhabitable. The seven single-member constituencies were replaced with one nine-member constituency in which voters could vote for nine candidates. The elections were won by the New People's Liberation Movement (NPLM), which took seven of the nine seats. The 2006 elections resulted in another hung parliament, and although the Movement for Change and Prosperity (MCAP) emerged as the largest party with four seats, the NPLM and the Montserrat Democratic Party formed a coalition government together with the sole independent MP. Although the NPLM held three seats and the MDP one, MDP leader Lowell Lewis became Chief Minister. The 2009 elections were won by the MCAP, which took six of the nine seats. In 2011 the Legislative Council was abolished and replaced by the Legislative Assembly. In the first elections to the new body in 2014, the MCAP was defeated by the new People's Democratic Movement, which won seven seats. ==Electoral system== The nine members of the Legislative Assembly are elected for five-year terms in a single constituency in which voters can vote for nine candidates.General Election Results - 2 April 2001 Caribbean Elections The island is split into six polling divisions for vote counting.Polling Divisions Caribbean Elections ==References== ==External links== *Election Commission ","title":"Elections in Montserrat"},{"id":"1442340","text":"Myanmar is a unitary republic, with elected representatives at the national and, state or region levels. On the national level, the head of state, the President, is elected indirectly through an Electoral College. According to the 2008 constitution, the term durations of the legislature, the President, and the Cabinet are five years.Constitution of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (2008) (English). Sections 61, 119, 151, 168, 235. Voting occurred in all constituencies, excluding seats appointed by the military, to select Members of Assembly to seats in both the upper house (the House of Nationalities) and the lower house (the House of Representatives) of the Assembly of the Union, and State and Region Hluttaws. Ethnic Affairs Ministers were also elected by their designated electorates on the same day, although only select ethnic minorities in particular states and regions were entitled to vote for them. The country has so far had 16 general elections since 1922; the last election was in 2015 and the next is expected in 2020. All elections are regulated by the Union Election Commission. ==History== When Ne Win's one party rule system – the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) – collapsed in August 1988 following the 8888 Uprising, the military staged another coup d'etat the following September, stating that they were going to hold \\"free and fair\\" elections in 1990. The first elections to the lower house (the Pyithu Hluttaw or \\"People's Assembly\\") under the new military administration, renamed the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), were held on 27 May 1990. The major opposition party, the National League for Democracy, won a landslide victory with a majority of 392 out of the 492 seats; thus, under a parliamentary system, the NLD would form a new government. However, the SLORC refused to acknowledge the results, and as a result the People's Assembly never convened. The military junta placed the leader of the NLD, Aung Sang Suu Kyi, under house arrest following her party's victory. The SLORC was abolished in November 1997 and replaced by the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), but this was merely a cosmetic change. In August 2003, Prime Minister Khin Nyunt announced a seven-step \\"roadmap to democracy\\", which the government claimed it was in the process of implementing. There was no timetable associated with the government’s plan, or any conditionality or independent mechanism for verifying that it is moving forward, so it was greeted sceptically by observers. On 7 February 2008, SPDC announced that a referendum for the new Constitution would be held, and elections by 2010. The constitutional referendum was held on 10 May. Following this the first general election in 20 years was held in 2010, completing the fifth step of the roadmap to democracy, though the NLD was excluded from participating in it as the Election Commission declared them \\"null and void\\" in accordance with election laws. The NLD, were however, allowed to participate in the 2012 by- elections that followed, and Suu Kyi - released from house arrest in 2010 - won a seat in the Pyithu Hluttaw. In 2015 general election, the National League for Democracy won an absolute majority of seats, taking 86 percent of the seats in the Assembly of the Union well more than the 67 percent supermajority needed to ensure that its preferred candidates will be elected president and first vice president. ==2015 campaign== ===House of Nationalities=== A polling station used for 2015 elections.

Known more for humor and originality than in-depth analysis, he's best known for his creative reviews of bad films, clever skewering of glitzy performers, and passionate advocacy for those in whose talents he believed. ==Early life== Wasserman attended Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, California.; Wasserman was in the Class of 1955 Never having graduated from college, Wasserman worked at many jobs before landing a position at the Chronicle at age 24. His first attempts to get a journalism job were rebuffed. Finally, an opening for an assistant critic came up in the paper's entertainment department. His audition review, A GATHERING OF EAGLES with Rock Hudson, landed him the job. The paper's executive editor, Bill German, recalled that John's review \\"was the only one that didn't bore me.\\" ==Writing career== Wasserman's best writing years were 1970 to 1979, when he had his own column. His columns covered anything vaguely related to entertainment: film, theater, music, comedy, bodybuilding, and even live sex shows at the famous Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theater. He counted Woody Allen, Joan Baez, poet Michael McClure, Clint Eastwood, Lily Tomlin, Bill Graham and numerous other celebrities among his friends. He could count Jerry Lewis, Russ Meyer, countless music promoters and crowds of Osmond fans among his detractors. He was a highly visible presence in San Francisco. He was the first person Marty Balin asked to manage Jefferson Airplane. He taught an annual \\"Media and the Arts\\" extension course for San Francisco State. He served as a stand-in for George C. Scott on the set of PETULIA and Clint Eastwood on the set of THE ENFORCER. He also did a brief walk-on in the motorcycle film C.C. AND COMPANY. He wrote the first serious review of a male porn film, Kansas City Truckin, for the SF Chronicle. ==Death== He died in a car accident on February 25, 1979, south of San Francisco in which two others in another car were also killed. His blood alcohol level was found to be .26, nearly three times the legal limit at the time, and he was driving the wrong way on the freeway. ==Posthumous publications== A collection of more than 90 of his reviews and columns, and a narrative about his life based on interviews conducted after his death, by his sister, Abby Wasserman, was published by Chronicle Books in 1993.

Starting his artistic career at the age of 44, his work was admired and collected by the likes of Jean Dubuffet and Pablo Picasso and is generally accepted to be in the forefront of 20th-century outsider art. ==Early years== Born in Glasgow, Scotland, at 24 Ropework Lane, Wilson dropped out of school at the age of 8 to help subsidise his family's meagre income by, amongst other things, selling newspapers on the street. In 1906 he enlisted with the Scottish Rifles and subsequently served in India and South Africa. He bought himself out in 1911 but rejoined in 1914 during World War I to fight on the Western Front. At the end of the war he emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he owned and operated a second-hand shop. ==Artistic career== ===Beginning=== At the age of 44 he began doodling with one of the fountain pens that he collected for resale in his shop and discovered his passion for art. In his own words: > I’m listening to classical music one day – Mendelssohn – when all of a > sudden I dipped the bulldog pen into a bottle of ink and started drawing – > doodling I suppose you’d call it – on the cardboard tabletop. I don’t know > why. I just did. In a couple of days – I worked almost ceaselessly – the > whole of the tabletop was covered with little faces and designs. The pen > seemed to make me draw, and them images, the faces and designs just flowed > out. I couldn’t stop – I’ve never stopped since that > day.http://www.petulloartcollection.org/the_collection/about_the_artists/artist.cfm?a_id=62 It was there that he began his work, embodying a personal code of morality wherein characters called \\"evils and greedies\\" are juxtaposed with naturalistic symbols of goodness and truth. The first dealer to encounter Wilson’s work was a Canadian, Douglas Duncan, who displayed them in various gallery shows. While Wilson did not want to part with his drawings, he found the idea of an artistic career preferable to shopkeeping and attempted to solve the problem of raising money by staging travelling shows for viewing only and charging modest entrance fees or holding tray collections. ===Success=== After receiving recognition for his work in Toronto, he abruptly went to London in 1945 and continued to exhibit his drawings for modest fees while maintaining a deep distrust of dealers. A few months after his arrival he was persuaded by dealers to show in galleries, and had a solo exhibition at the Arcade Gallery in London, shown concurrently with other works by such 20th-century artists as Pablo Picasso, Giorgio de Chirico, Paul Klee, Joan Miró, amongst others. Wilson's rejection of commercialism was unabated, however, and he continued to sell his work on the street for a minute fraction of the prices the gallery owners were asking. He said of the working-class customers he attracted, \\"They're the intellect, you know\\". ===Later years=== Royal Worcester dinnerware by Scottie Wilson Wilson spent his remaining years in Kilburn, an area of northwest London, working alone in his small lodgings. In the early 1950s, he travelled to France at the persuasion of artist and outsider art fanatic Jean Dubuffet. There Wilson was met by not only Dubuffet, but also by Pablo Picasso; both were fans and owners of Wilson's work. According to art critic Bill Hopkins, a friend of Wilson who accompanied him on the trip: > When we arrived, not only was Dubuffet waiting, Pablo Picasso was with him. > Both owned a few of Scottie’s pieces, and Picasso had come to see – and > perhaps buy – some more. I vividly remember both artists eagerly admiring > Scottie’s work, squabbling in their fierce, theatrical, Gallic voices over > who would buy which piece. In the 1960s, Wilson began to create paintings on plates and was subsequently commissioned by Royal Worcester and had designed a series of dinnerware, which was produced until 1965. The pattern was based on totem poles and imagery from North America. His picture ‘Bird Song’ was chosen as a design for the 1970 UNICEF Christmas Card. He died in 1972 from cancer. Though he always complained of poverty, Wilson was discovered at the time of his death to have secreted a suitcase full of money under his bed and large sums in various bank accounts. ==Subject matter and style== The evolution of his style was notoriously non-existent and, because he did not date most of his works, it is very difficult to place his works in time apart from the few documentary records that exist. He stuck mainly to a narrow range of visual elements: botanical forms, birds and animals, clowns (self-portraits), and \\"Greedies\\" and \\"Evils\\" (malignant personifications). His work can be placed in a purely speculative chronological order by the subtle changes and progressions in his subject matter and style. His earlier pieces are thought to be generally more organic in composition and have less precise cross-hatching and detail. Certain images did become more prevalent, while others were used less frequently, and the level of detail is thought to have increased over time. As he once said: > When I'm working I can see what's happening, and I can imagine what's going > to happen. I can see best when I'm finishing my pictures with a pen. When > I'm making strokes; hundreds and thousands of strokes. ==References== ==External links== *Collection of photographs of Scottie Wilson by Ida Kar *Raw Vision magazines article on the life and work of Scottie Wilson Category:1888 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Outsider artists Category:Scottish artists Category:Jewish artists Category:People from Glasgow ","title":"Scottie Wilson"},{"id":"1442380","text":"Nauru elects on a national level a head of state (the president) and a legislature.

The percentages for National Assembly representatives were very similar to those the parties had received for their presidential candidate. The electoral quotient needed to win one of the 90 National Assembly seats was obtained by dividing the number of valid votes in each region by the number of representatives that had been assigned to each region, proportional to its population. Each party's \\"left over\\" votes—those insufficient to earn it a seat in a given region—were then added together and re-tallied nationally. The seats earned in this second count went to the next candidate on the party's slate in the regions where it had come closest to winning on the first round. In addition, any party getting at least 1% of the presidential vote (which all six losing parties did) was allowed a seat for its defeated presidential candidate.

According to the Electoral Law, to be formed, an association needed, among other things, to present to the Supreme Electoral Council a \\"written request signed by a minimum of 5% of the citizens on the electoral rolls corresponding to the respective electoral area\\". A total of 53 associations participated in the municipal elections. One of them (the Civic Association of Potosí) won the mayor's post. Despite winning only one municipality, an important number of association candidates finished in second or third place. In the nation's capital, Managua, two independent candidates; Pedro Solórzano of the Viva Managua Movement association and Herty Lewites of the Sol (sun) association competed against the AL and FSLN official candidates. ALN's Roberto Cedeño got the 28% of the votes followed closely by Solórzano with 26%, Carlos Guadamúz from the FSLN with 25.7% and Herty Lewites who became Managua's mayor four years later came in fourth place with 12.3%. The 1996 municipal election took place together with the Presidential election on October 20. Municipal Councils were elected in 145 municipalities nationwide. The final results for the elections were: *Liberal Alliance (AL) - 92 municipalities controlled *Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) - 51 municipalities controlled *Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) - 1 municipality controlled *Civic Association of Potosí (ACP) - 1 municipality controlled Source: 2000 In the 2000 municipal election 1,532,816 voters elected Municipal Councils in 151 municipalities nationwide.

The 2004 municipal elections represented a huge Sandinista victory. The FSLN- Convergence won 14 of the 17 departmental capitals, 87 of the 152 municipalities —including 5 of the 6 that make up Managua’s greater metropolitan area— and 25 of Nicaragua’s 42 largest cities. In total it will govern a little over 4 million inhabitants, nearly 71% of the national population. The Sandinista victory was attributed to the success of the FSLN- Convergence alliance. Of the 87 mayors elected on the FSLN ticket, 17 come from these allies: 5 are independents, 3 are from the Resistance, 3 belong to the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS), 2 are Conservatives, 2 are Liberals, 1 is from the Christian Unity Movement (MUC) and 1 is a Social Christian. Of the deputy mayors who ran with an FSLN mayoral candidate, 28 are Liberals, 16 are independent, 14 are from the MUC, 9 are Conservatives, 9 are from the MRS, 3 are from the Resistance and 1 is a Social Christian. These allied candidates allowed the FSLN to win 12 municipal governments for the first time.

The Senate has 109 members, elected for a four-year term: each of the 36 states are divided into 3 senatorial districts, each of which is represented by one senator; the Federal Capital Territory is represented by only one senator. Nigeria has a multi-party system, with two or three strong parties and a third party that is electorally successful.

The election follows controversy as to whether a Muslim or Christian should be allowed to become president given the tradition of rotating the top office between the religions and following the death of Umaru Yar'Adua, who was a Muslim, and Goodluck Jonathan, a Christian, assuming the interim presidency. Following the election widespread violence took place in the northern parts of the country. Goodluck Jonathan was declared the winner on 19 April. The elections was reported in the international media as having run smoothly with relatively little violence or voter fraud in contrast to previous elections, in particular the widely disputed 2007 election.

Elections in North Korea are held every four-to-five years for the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), the country's national legislature, and every four years for Local People's Assemblies. All seats are won by the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland. The founding and ruling Workers' Party of Korea dominates the Front and holds 87.5% of the seats, with 7.4% for the Korean Social Democratic Party, 3.2% for the Chondoist Chongu Party, and 1.9% for independent deputies. According to official reports, turnout is near 100%, and approval of the Democratic Front's candidates is unanimous or nearly so. ==Procedure== In reply to a question put forth by Michael Marshall, Li Chun Sik of North Korea stated at a meeting of the Association of Secretaries General of Parliaments (ASGP) of the Inter-Parliamentary Union: Only one candidate appears on each ballot. Elections are ostensibly conducted by secret ballot, and a voter may cross off the candidate's name to vote against them, but must do so by crossing out the name without secrecy. Voting is mandatory and turnout is habitually near 100%. Members of the Supreme People's Assembly are elected to five-year terms, and meet for SPA sessions up to ten days per year. The Supreme People's Assembly elects a standing committee known as the Presidium, which exercises legislative functions when the Assembly is not in session. It also elects the Chairman of the National Defence Commission, the country's chief executive, and the Premier. ===Local elections=== Local elections have been held since 1999. The people elect representatives to city, county, and provincial people's assemblies in local elections every four years. The number of representatives is determined by the population of each jurisdiction. Mayors and governors are technically elected. Their role is to work with the unelected and more influential city and province party secretaries. ==Criticism== The elections have been variously described as show elections or a political census. Seats are uncompetitive as all candidates are chosen by the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland. Because of the near-100% turnout, elections double as unofficial censuses. The inminban neighborhood watch reportedly watches the elections to identify and investigate no-shows. A voter may cross off the candidate's name to vote against him or her, but must do so in a separate booth without any secrecy–an act of defiance that many North Korean defectors have claimed is too risky to even attempt. In recent elections there have been separate boxes for \\"no\\" votes. Voting against the official candidate, or refusing to vote at all, is considered an act of treason, and those who do face the loss of their jobs and housing, along with extra surveillance. ==Latest election== The latest election was held on 10 March 2019. { class= style=text-align:right +Summary of the 10 March 2019 North Korea Supreme People's Assembly election results !Alliance !Party !Votes !% !Seats -  rowspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"left\\"Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea align=\\"left\\"General Association of Korean Residents in Japan   5 -  align=\\"left\\" Others   682 - align=left colspan=2Total 100687 - align=left colspan=2Registered voters/turnout 99.99– - align=left colspan=5Source: } ==Past elections== ===Parliamentary elections=== *1947 *1948 *1957 *1962 *1967 *1972 *1977 *1982 *1986 *1990 *1998 *2003 *2009 *2014 *2019 ===By-elections=== * 1959 ===Local elections=== *1946 *1947 *1949 *1950 *1956 *1959 *1963 *1967 *1972 *1975 *1977 *1979 *1981 *1983 *1985 *1987 *1989 *1991 *1993 *1999 *2003 *2007 *2011 *2015 *2019 ==See also== * Politics of North Korea * List of political parties in North Korea ==References","title":"Elections in North Korea"},{"id":"1442396","text":"Tenancingo de Degollado is a large municipality, and also the name of a town and the municipal seat of the municipality, in the State of Mexico, Mexico. Both are commonly known as Tenancingo. The municipality is located in the south of the state, in the Tenancingo Valley, just outside the Toluca Valley. Tenancingo de Degollado is often confused with Tenancingo, Tlaxcala, which is a town in a different state. It is a commercial area known for its industrious people who produce beautiful rebozos (a kind of shawl) which have been woven here since the colonial period on both backstrap and pedal looms. Several artisans also produce baskets and fine fruit liquors. Tenancingo is the home to more than 200 carpentry workshops that fashion furniture. There are many green houses in the region that produce cut flowers. In fact the flower industry is Tenancingo's largest source of income. It is the home of the Santo Desierto del Carmen, the name of both a monastery and a national park. ==The town== The seat of the municipality is the town of Tenancingo, surrounded by mountains and forest. The main elevation overlooking the town is the Cerro de las Tres Marías, topped by a giant white statue of Christ the King (Cristo Rey), built in 1985, designed by Hector Morret and visible from just about anywhere in the valley below. The monument is reachable by either climbing a staircase with 1,030 steps or by paved road. There is a lookout allowing for a 360-degree panoramic view. Since it is relatively isolated, Tenancingo has maintained much of its country feel and old traditions despite extensive economic growth and tourism. It has a colonial era layout, centered on a main plazas filled with young poplars, which replaced aged junipers that grew here before. Market (tianguis) days are still Thursdays and Sundays, which almost five square city blocks with stalls. The plaza contains a traditional kiosk as well as a notable marble statue of Miguel Hidalgo, which was sculpted here but was in the Jardín de los Martires in Toluca for many years before its return. It is said to be the oldest sculpture of its kind in the State of Mexico. The area is known for its rebozos, chairs painted with floral designs and a local sausage/cold cut called “Obispo,” which attract tourists, most of whom come to the area by buses that connect it with Toluca and Mexico City . View of the Cristo Rey from Casanova Street Facing this plaza is the municipal hall, built when the municipality was formed and the San Francisco Asis Parish. This church was built in the 17th century of sandstone. Its interior has a Baroque tabernacle dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary and a second chamber dedicatd to the Virgin Mary. Calvario Temple Another important church is the Calvario Temple, constructed century in Neoclassical style and finished in 1813. It is also known as the Our Lady of Sorrows Sanctuary and the Basilica of San Clemente, and was recently named a cathedral for the Tenancingo diocese. The interior, especially the cupola contains works by local painter Petronilo Monroy as well as large canvases with scenes of the Passion of the Christ by José María Monroy Briseño. However the latter are exhibited only during Holy Week. The municipal market was inaugurated in 1972 and the Flower Market was built sometime later, dedicated to the municipality's recent dedicated to the growing of cut flowers. The Teotla neighborhood (barrio) is one of the oldest in the town. It contains a small plaza and small church. ==The municipality== Desierto del Carmen monastery The municipality is in the south of the State of Mexico, 48 km from the state capital of Toluca. The municipality has one city, four neighborhoods (barrios), twenty ranches, fourteen villages, six “agricultural neighborhoods (colonias),” eight “urban neighborhoods (colonias),” ten “semi urban neighborhoods (colonias)” and two communities of a type called “internado,” which together form a territory of 160.18km2. The municipality borders the municipalities of Tenango del Valle, Joquicingo, Zumpahuacán, Malinalco and Villa Guerrero . The local government consists of a municipal president, one syndic, and ten representatives called “regidors.” Attractions in the municipality (outside the seat) include the Tecomatlán Parish, the chapels located in the communities of San Simonito, Zepayautla, Acatzingo and Teola and the former haciendas of Tenería, Monte de Pozo and Santa Ana. However, the major cultural landmark for the area is the Desierto del Carmen monastery and National Park, located twelve km south of the town of Tenancingo. It is a heavily forested area which centers on the Carmelite monastery, one of few in Mexico that still hosts monks and religious activities. The monastery was built in the late 18th century and consecrated in 1801 as a new home for the monks of the Desierto de los Leones, when they decided that they needed to be further away from the expanding Mexico City. The monastery was abandoned for a time in the early 20th century but the order retook the facility, establishing a school called the Colegio de Filosofía de los Carmelitas Descalzados in 1951 and in 1956, it was designated as a “house of prayer” open to all. It still hosts religious gatherings along with quiet spaces open to the public for prayer and contemplation. The monastery complex has a number of living facilities and storage units as well as former hermitages dedicated to John the Baptist, Saint Joseph and Mary Magdalene. The church contains a life-sized wood crucifix called the Cristo de las Siete Suertes. The surrounding forest has hiking trails and picnic areas as well as three lookout points: Balcon del Diablo, San Elias and Peña Colorada. ==Socioeconomics== Work in progress at the Inocencio Borboa workshop in Tenancingo Most of the population of the municipality lives in the valley floor, in or near the municipal seat. However, small communities can be found at very high elevations such as San José Chalmita and San Antonio Agua Bendita. The municipality is poor with 60.2% of the population suffering from either moderate (43.1%) or extreme (17.1%) poverty. 15.3 percent live in substandard housing and thirty percent live without one or more services such as running water and electricity. 42.1% percent are considered to have substandard access to nutrition. Average years of schooling for residents is 8.1 years, below the state average of 9.1. The municipality has 179 educational centers including 69 preschools, 63 primary schools, 33 middle schools, 14 high schools and four vocational schools. There are several campuses with higher studies such as the Escuela Central Agrícola de Tenería (est. 1927), the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México - Centro Universitario UAEM Tenancingo and the Centro Universitario Iberoamericano de Tenancingo. There are no educational facilities specifically targeting an indigenous population. Major local celebrations include Lunes de Carnaval (when residents elect an \\"Ugly King\\") and a procession of silence and passion play during Holy Week. The Carnival of Tenancingo was established in 1982. Other important dates include Epiphany, the Feria de Jarro on Ash Wednesday and the feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (July 16). These are popular dates for weddings and confirmation and feature native folk dance, religious services, fireworks, traveling amusement rides as well as local food specialties. There are two main ingredients in local cuisine: chayotes, once the main agricultural crop and so important that residents call themselves “chayotes”, and obispo, a kind of sausage or cold cut. Common dishes include chayotes con pipian, tinga (chicken or pork), carnero en salsa and chilacayotes con venas de chile. The main economic activities of the municipality are agriculture, commerce and handcrafts. Although a recent phenomenon, its main agricultural crop is cut flowers, grown in greenhouses with many exported. Cultivated species include gladiolas and roses. Other crops include avocados and peaches and there is some honey and other bee products now produced as a consequence of the flower trade. Santa Ana Ixtlahuatzingo is particularly noted for the growing of flowers, as is the community of San Miguel Tecomatlán. The main handcrafts produced by the municipality are rustic furniture, fruit liquors, sweaters, baskets and, by far the best known, rebozos. Furniture making is mostly concentrated in the La Campana neighborhood of the seat. The classic style of the area is lacquered in white or pastel colors, decorated with flowers painted by hand. Much of the fruit liquor production is exported. Most of the basket production is concentrated in the town of Chalchihuapan. Feria de Rebozo 2014 Rebozos have been made in the municipal area since the colonial period using both indigenous backstrap looms and Spanish pedal looms. This continues to this day with most production today concentrated in the town of Tenancingo and nearby Acatzingo. The municipality has about thirty weavers and over 180 “empuntadoras”, those who finger-weave the fringes. Making a rebozo require fifteen steps, from the ikat dying method to the weaving and the creation of the fringes. There are fringe weaves that take up to four months to do. Prices for rebozos generally run between 400 and 4,000 pesos each, depending on the quality of the thread, the tightness and complexity of the weave and the intricateness of the woven fringes. There are several notable rebozo weavers in Tenancingo. One of these is Evaristo Borboa, who received a National Galardon from the federal government for his work in 2014. His work has been exhibited in Mexico and abroad, in such countries as Japan and Germany. He has worked as a weaver all his life, starting when he was eight years old and is only one of two in Tenancingo who weaves with a backstrap loom (along with Salomon Gonzalez Pedraza) . He uses commercially made cotton thread and used to use natural dyes but has since switched to synthetics. Most of Evaristo's buyers are foreigners because of the publicity he has received. He has said that he will die with threads in his hand and knows the exact number of threads in each rebozo he makes. Another notable rebozo maker is Luis Rodriguez Martinez, who distributes his ware in various parts of Mexico including Puebla, Oaxaca, Morelos, Michoacán, Guanajuato, Guadalajara and Mexico City. Weaving is mostly done by men with women knotting the fringe. In Ixpuichapan, there is an association of women dedicated to the weaving of fringes. Luis Rodriguez Martinez has stated that the craft is in danger of disappearing from Tenancingo. Currently there are 35 weavers from 200 about 70 years ago and thirty of these have been in operation for more than sixty years. The main reason for the loss of artisans is the low prices of rebozos, including imitations from abroad. Weavers have taken to making other items such as neckties and bags using the same material as the rebozos. Children of weavers, including those of Evarito Borboa, are deciding not to follow in their parents’ footsteps. To help preserve the tradition, in 2014, the town hosted the first National Rebozo Contest, sponsored by FONART and the state tourism secretary. It attracts over thirty artisans and about 3,500 people each year with pieces available here running between 200 and 15,000 pesos. ==Geography and environment== The municipality is located in a small valley just southeast of the Toluca Valley. The ruggedness of the area is due to its formation by an eruption of the Nevado de Toluca volcano. It is possible that the valley was a lake, which eventually dried up as the rocks here are both volcanic and sedimentary. The average altitude is 2,300, varying between 2,060 and 2,490 meters above sea level. Major peaks include Peña Colorada, La Vibora, la Tezontlera, La Cantera and La Malinche, with the last two part of a small range called the Nixcongo. From the highest elevations of the municipality, it is possible to see the peaks of the Nevado de Toluca and Popocatepetl . Wild vegetation is still abundant in the municipality with numerous plants species native to the area. Wildlife includes squirrels, armadillos, cacomixtle, rabbits, coyotes, bats, opossums, various lizards and other reptiles and various bird species. The higher elevations are heavily forested. The municipality's climate is temperate and semi moist with a rainy season. Average annual precipitation is between 1,000 and 1,500mm with most of this falling in the late summer and early fall. The rest of the year is mostly dry. Average annual temperature is 18.2C. The only surface water is dams constructed to collect runoff located in San José Tenería, Ejido de Tenancingo, San Nicolás Tepetzingo, Colonia San Isido and Ixpuichiapan, which provide water both for drinking and agriculture. The main natural attraction is the Hermenguildo Galeana Park, a 343-hectare reserve established in 1980 about 10 km outside the municipal seat. It is accessed only by dirt road and is heavily forested, but offers cabins, palapas and areas for horseback riding and other sports. The Santa Ana Ixtlahualcingo Falls are four km outside the community of the same name which also has camping. One half km from here is another water fall called San Simonito. ==History== ===Designation=== The name is derived from Nahuatl phrase “tenamitl” which means “small walls or fortifications” and the suffix “co” meaning “place.” Changes in pronunciation are due to the influence of Spanish. The walls/fortifications refer to the natural steep formations of the mountains of the original indigenous settlement, which was difficult to access. The modern town is denoted by both a seal and an Aztec glyph. The seal depicts walls, as per its name as well as a rebozo, a garment which is manufactured here. The Aztec glyph is how the area was represented in pre Hispanic records. It also indicates walls. ===Pre Hispanic period=== The first human settlements in the area date back as far as 1800 BCE, found in Ixpuichiapan and the Cerro de las Tres Marías. Between 1300 and 800 BCE settlements spread to the Nixcongo, Exhacienda de Monte de Pozoa and the Texpoxtepec area, showing Olmec influence. The pre Hispanic town was located about five km south of the modern one, today called Acatzingo de la Piedra. The area abounds in artifacts such as ceramics and petroglyphs. During the pre Classic to the Classic period, remains from this area show Purépecha influence in the Nixcongo and Monte de Pozo areas with settlements in San Simonito, Tecomatlan and San Jose Chalmita showing Matlatzinca influence. With the rise of the Aztecs, the lord of Tenancingo allied himself with Axayacatl to help subdue Malinalco, Calpulli Coapipitzoatepec (Xochiaca), allowing it to remain independent. ===Colonial period=== After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the area became part of an encomienda given to Juan Salcedo, with the family controlling the lands for several generations. Evangelization of the same area was done by the Augustinians starting in 1537 and constructed the first hermitage here. In the first organization of New Spain in 1535, Tenancingo was part of the archbisphoric of Mexico in the eastern province. The modern town was founded in 1551 at the foot of what is now the Cerro de las Trés Marías, in the valley of Tenancingo 5 km from the indigenous town. The native population was relocated to an area now called Barrio de Salitre and were obligated to build a hermitage here dedicated to Our Lady of Refuge. The Augustinians constructed what is now the San Francisco parish. In 1561 priest Alfonso Martinez de Zayas took over evangelization efforts and also took control over large extensions of land in order to plant wheat. From 1565 to 1577 various Spaniards such as Angel Villafaña, Catalina de Ablornez and Francisco Bullon were granted lands here and by 1600 the Tenancingo region was divided into areas controlled by the towns of Tenancigo, Tepetzingo, Exlahutzingo, Talcoquiapan, Cultepec, Teculoyan, Icotlan, Chichualhucan and Tlaxomulco. The region became known for its cultivation of grapes, berries and olives. In 1613, the San Francisco Parish was expanded under the direction of the Franciscans . At least as far back as 1790, the town was noted for the making of rebozos. The first haciendas was established in 1771 in the small town of Chiquihuitepec, one of three that would remain until the Mexican Revolution . ===19th century=== In 1801, the Carmelite monastery in Tenancingo was finished, the new home for the monks formerly at the Desierto de los Leones. In 1812, the area was the scene of a battle of the Mexican War of Independence which pitted José María Morelos y Pavón against Royalist general Rosendo Porlier. Earlier, Porlier had taken control of the area but Morelos succeeded in driving these forces out. After the war, the area was partitioned from that of Malinalco to form a new municipality. The following decades saw this municipality change with the gain of the towns of San Simón de los Comales in 1837 and the towns of San Martin, Xochiaca and Zepayautla in 1847. The municipality lost the town of San Francisco Tepexocuca to Tenango del Valle in 1847 and the communities of Zumpahuacan, San Gaspar, San Pablo and San Antonio in 1875. In 1860, the town was sacked by a group rebelling against the government and set on fire. In 1861, Tenancingo was officially declared a town and gained the appendage “de Degollado” to its name, in honor of Santos Degollado. This was followed by city status in 1878. In 1866, an association of artisans was formed in the town to support those who make rebozos and other items. In the latter 19th century there was construction and other improvements with the Calvario Temple consecrated in 1863, the Capilla de Jesus in 1866 and the municipal palace and Alameda Park in 1878. The streets were realigned in 1871. In 1885 there was a skirmish between the towns of San José Chalmita and Zumpahuacan. ===20th century to the present=== The first decades of the 20th century brought conflict to the area; first the Mexican Revolution and then the Cristero War. Both resulted in the hindrance of economic development although the three main haciendas (including Teneria, then owned by prominent politician José Ives Limantour) were broken up and the land redistributed. At the start of the Cristero War, the churches were closed by the government but not the Carmelite monastery, which had already been abandoned when the last hermit, Friar Pedro de Santa Maria died in 1915. Reaction included attacks by a band of Cristeros under Benjamin Mendoza, which blocked the Tenancingo-San José Chalmita road and killing a number of people. In 1929, a smallpox and measles epidemic killed many of the municipality's inhabitants, especially the young. After these calamities, the rest of the 20th century is mostly marked by development of infrastructure and the economy. Paving of streets and sidewalks was begun in 1930 with one of the main streets named after Pablo Gonzalez Casanova in 1936. The civil hospital was inaugurated in 1937. Local newspapers of various types were established in the municipality starting in 1937 and a radio station, XEQ, went on the air in 1942, with the song “Tenancingo” by Manuel Rentaria Polanco. The municipal library was inaugurated in 1949. The Lux Cinema was established in 1952, the Petronilo Monroy middle school in 1957 and the Benito Juarez Plaza in 1970. For conservation and tourism purposes, in 1972, the State of Mexico government declared Tenancingo a “typical city” and a monument was constructed to mark the 100th anniversary of its declaration as s city. In 1979, the potable water and drainage system was expanded and improved, with the Casa de Cultura built in 1981 and the football stadium in 1982. However, there have still been economic problem in the municipality. In 1981, flower producers in Santa Ana Ixtlahuatzingo destroyed five rainwater capturing tanks as part of ongoing socio-political disputes, igniting a conflict between it and the seat of the municipality. Poverty and access to resources are still issues. Tenancingo was named a diocese by Pope Benedicto XVI in 2009, separating from the Toluca diocese with the Basilica named as cathedral. ==References== Category:Populated places established in 1551 Category:Populated places in the State of Mexico Category:Municipalities of the State of Mexico Category:1551 establishments in the Spanish Empire ","title":"Tenancingo, State of Mexico"},{"id":"1442397","text":"James Mark Cornette (born September 17, 1961) is an American author and podcaster who has previously worked in the professional wrestling industry as an agent, booker, color commentator, manager, promoter, trainer, and occasional professional wrestler. During his career, he has worked for the Continental Wrestling Association, Mid-South Wrestling, World Class Championship Wrestling, Jim Crockett Promotions, World Championship Wrestling, the World Wrestling Federation (now called WWE), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (now called Impact Wrestling), and Ring of Honor. From 1991 to 1995, he was the owner and head booker of Smoky Mountain Wrestling, and from 1999 to 2005, was the co-owner, head booker, and head trainer of Ohio Valley Wrestling. During the later years of his career, Cornette focused primarily on backstage positions and transitioned away from his role as an on-screen manager. In 2017, Cornette retired from managing. During a transitional period prior to the retirement, he worked as an on-screen \\"authority figure\\" character in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and Ring of Honor, promotions where he also held backstage positions. Cornette has also had an extensive commentary career, most recently serving as a color commentator for Major League Wrestling, What Culture Pro Wrestling, and the National Wrestling Alliance. Cornette is noted for his long-standing real-life feud with fellow professional wrestling booker Vince Russo; in June 2017, Russo filed a restraining order (EPO) against Cornette for stalking. The Cornette vs. Russo feud has been featured on two episodes of Viceland's Dark Side of the Ring series. Cornette, an atheist and democratic socialist, has made appearances on The Young Turks documenting his criticisms of religious and right-wing causes. ==Career== ===Early career=== James Cornette was born in Louisville, Kentucky on September 17, 1961. Cornette has had a life-long love for wrestling, claiming that, as a child, he installed a ten-foot antenna on top of his house so he could watch as much regional wrestling as possible. He began working at wrestling events at the age of 14, serving as a photographer, ring announcer, timekeeper, magazine correspondent, and public relations correspondent. During this time, from attending matches at the Louisville Gardens, Cornette got to know promoter Christine Jarrett, who was the mother of Jerry Jarrett, promoter of the Continental Wrestling Association (commonly known as the \\"Memphis territory\\"). ===Continental Wrestling Association (1982–1983)=== By 1982, Cornette was now also writing programs for arena shows, having photos published in wrestling magazines, and contributing to the Championship Wrestling Magazine. In August, he traveled to Memphis to see the TV match between Jerry Lawler and Ric Flair. After the show ended, Cornette was offered a wrestling managerial role on television by promoter Jerry Jarrett. As Cornette has recalled, despite his presence being tolerated at shows and TV tapings for nearly a decade, the first time he was allowed into the locker room was only after he had become a manager. Before making his managing debut, Cornette decided to adapt the ring name James E. Cornette in tribute to legendary wrestling promoter James E. Barnett. Cornette made his ringside debut on September 25, 1982, managing Sherri Martel, who herself would later become a wrestling manager. Cornette was given the gimmick of a rich kid turned inept manager whose clients kept firing him after one match. The most notable wrestlers in this angle were Dutch Mantell and Crusher Broomfield (who would later gain fame as One Man Gang and Akeem \\"The African Dream\\"). Over the next 14 months Cornette also managed Jesse Barr, Exotic Adrian Street, and a trio called the \\"Cornette Dynasty\\" consisting of Carl Fergie, Norman Fredrich Charles III, and the Angel. After a short-lived run in Georgia through a deal Jarrett had with Ole Anderson, Cornette returned to Memphis in July 1983, and worked as co-manager alongside Jimmy Hart. ===Mid-South Wrestling (1983–1984)=== In November 1983, Mid-South promoter Bill Watts recognized his business was down, and was looking to reinvigorate his territory. Watts asked Jerry Jarrett and Jerry Lawler to visit a TV taping and offer their opinions. Jarrett suggested a talent trade, and invited Watts to Memphis to see who he liked. After watching a Memphis TV taping, Watts took singles performers Dennis Condrey and Bobby Eaton to create a new tag team, and also took the existing team of Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson as The Rock 'n' Roll Express. Watts also noticed the brash young manager in Cornette, and in his own words, recalled \\"He was so obnoxious I wanted to slap him\\", and \\"I knew he was instant box office if he could get me that riled up\\". As the more senior Jimmy Hart was still required by Jarrett, Watts took Cornette to manage his new team, who decided on the name The Midnight Express. Notable wrestlers in the trade who left Mid-South for Memphis included Rick Rude and Jim Neidhart. Mid- South Wrestling had at that point been a territory featuring bigger wrestlers, and Cornette has stated that The Midnight Express, the Rock 'n' Roll Express, and himself were probably the five smallest members of the roster when he arrived. The influx of the new talent had an immediate impact, and business first rebounded and then skyrocketed. It was during this time that Cornette acquired his tennis racquet which became his trademark. He has stated he had seen a college movie at the time with an obnoxious rich kid carrying a badminton racquet with him (most likely the 1983 film Screwballs), so he decided on a tennis racquet. At times Cornette loaded the racquet with a horse shoe to guard against aggressive fans. Feud with Magnum TA and Mr. Wrestling II Cornette and The Midnight Express debuted on Mid-South television on November 23, 1983. After the first few weeks in the territory the team faced the Mid-South tag team champions Magnum T.A. and Mr. Wrestling II. At a TV taping for a contract signing for an upcoming championship match, the Midnights and Cornette attacked Magnum TA and tarred and feathered him. The feud continued through to early March 1984, when The Midnight Express won the Mid-South tag team titles after Mr. Wrestling II walked out on his partner during a match. The Last Stampede At a TV taping on March 14, 1984, Cornette and the Midnights staged a celebration for winning the tag team titles, complete with champagne and birthday cake. While Cornette's back was turned, The Rock 'n' Roll Express ran in and shoved Cornette's face in the cake. Cornette was enraged afterwards when Bill Watts replayed the incident on TV as he thought it was funny. This led to a heated altercation between the two, which ended with Watts slapping Cornette. In following weeks, the Midnight Express and Cornette attacked and bloodied Watts leading him to come out of retirement. In a series of matches termed \\"The Last Stampede\\", Watts and his masked teammate Stagger Lee (suspected to be Junkyard Dog under a mask) faced the Midnight Express and Cornette all through the territory. The stipulations were simple; if the Midnights won Cornette would run Mid-South Wrestling for 60 days; if they lost, Cornette would be stripped down and forced to wear either a diaper or a dress (the outfits varied by venue). Over 5 weeks, the Last Stampede series shattered box office records for Mid-South, with a record gate and attendance at the Sam Houston Coliseum in Texas, combined attendance of 20,000 people in Tulsa and Oklahoma City (on the same day), and a crowd of 23,000 people at the New Orleans Superdome. Rock 'n' Roll Express rivalry Cornette's time in Mid-South was also notable as it marked the beginning of the rivalry with the Rock 'n' Roll Express. Starting in May 1984 immediately following the Last Stampede series, the two teams feuded all through the remainder of the year to packed crowds all through the territory. In particular, the two teams set attendance records in Houston, Tulsa and Oklahoma City, making 1984 the most successful year in Mid-South history, and The Midnight Express and Cornette national stars. Watts' style and influence Cornette has consistently acknowledged that Bill Watts's philosophy of believable and credible wrestling, with an unwavering emphasis on toughness, athleticism and serious presentation, has had a major impact on how he thinks the business should be promoted. He has described the promotion as a military school for wrestling, where Watts' strict enforcement of kayfabe, exhausting travel schedule and passionate fans made it a learning experience like no other. Cornette maintains enormous respect for Watts as a promoter, citing his ability to attract huge TV ratings and consistently sold- out arenas in a low population area, and describing Watts as a genius. At the same time, he acknowledges the grind of constant matches, long drives, and fan riots was a grueling test of endurance. At one point Cornette worked 103 days straight before being ordered by doctors to have two to four weeks' bed rest. As events transpired, he took six days off before returning to action. In describing Mid-South Wrestling, Cornette has offered the following example: \\"Two weeks of our lives, fourteen days, we did two one hour TV shows, fifteen house shows, two all day promo sets, drove 4700 miles in a car while doing that, and I can't speak for anybody else, but I made—and I was only 22 years old, and just pleased as punch to be there—$5600 for two weeks. In 1984. Not bad.\\" ===World Class Championship Wrestling (1984–1985)=== The Midnight Express with Cornette had a short stay in World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) in Texas where they feuded mainly with The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers). When opportunities in WCCW looked to go nowhere, The Midnight Express started to look elsewhere for employment and what they found would give the team national and international exposure. Cornette later reflected that they were willing to give Dallas a try, as they welcomed living in a modern city, as well as the easier travel schedule when compared to Mid-South. However the inability to get any rivalry with the Von Erichs—and therefore main event money—made the decision to leave for Charlotte an easy one. ===Jim Crockett Promotions/World Championship Wrestling (1985–1990, 1993)=== Managing the Midnight Express With Cornette as manager, the team were two-time National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) world tag team champions and two- time NWA United States tag team champions. As a manager, Cornette was known for both his loud mouth and for his ever-present tennis racket, which Cornette often used to ensure victory for his wrestlers, with the implication that the racket case was loaded. Cornette was at his best as a heel manager; fans loved to see the constantly yelling Cornette and his equally annoying charges beaten and humiliated. He and the Midnights were so hated, in fact, that they had to be escorted by police to and from the ring at the house shows and have a police escort to the city limits for fear of being attacked by overzealous fans. Additionally, Cornette suffered a severe knee injury during a scaffold match between The Midnight Express and The Road Warriors at Starrcade '86. In a shoot interview, Cornette recounted that Dusty Rhodes convinced him to perform a dangerous stunt where he would fall off of the high scaffold, which Cornette estimated was twenty-five feet off the floor of the arena but about five feet less when measured from the ring mat to the top of the scaffold. The idea was that Paul Ellering, the manager of The Road Warriors, would chase Cornette up the scaffold. Once he was there, he would be met by Road Warrior Animal, who would assist him in getting underneath the scaffold, where Cornette would hang and then drop when ready. Cornette, however, suffered from a severe case of acrophobia and decided that the drop, which he estimated was a total of fourteen feet when he factored in his total body length of eight feet (height plus extended arm length), was, as he put it, \\"way too goddamn far.\\" Condrey, Eaton, and Cornette discussed an alternative: Big Bubba Rogers, another wrestler of Cornette's, would catch the manager. However, as Rogers was wearing dark sunglasses inside the arena he misjudged his position and Cornette actually landed flat on his feet, three feet away from Rogers. Cornette tore all the ligaments in one of his knees, broke a bone and damaged the cartilage. The injury was so extensive that when Cornette finally saw a doctor to have the knee drained, the amount of blood and fluid filled an entire bedpan. Cornette later said that he knew he might get seriously hurt when he was told he would have to fall off a scaffold, but that performing in front of such a large audience was more important than his own health. In 1989, Cornette became the color commentator for Jim Crockett Promotions' nationally syndicated NWA television show, and later took over the same role on the Saturday night TBS broadcasts alongside play-by-play announcer Jim Ross. In 1989, Cornette became a booker on WCW's creative team. As such, Cornette helped write storylines and shape the format of its television shows. Due to friction and animosity between himself and WCW head Jim Herd, Cornette quit the company after Halloween Havoc 1990. Return In January 1993 Cornette briefly returned to World Championship Wrestling (WCW) when WCW was doing a talent trade with Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). Bill Watts, who was the WCW executive vice president, brought The Rock 'n' Roll Express back to WCW and billed them as the Smoky Mountain tag team champions. This incensed Cornette since his team the Heavenly Bodies (Stan Lane and Tom Prichard) were the champions at the time.Pro Wrestling Illustrated, June 1993 issue, p.8. On the February 6, 1993 episode on WCW Saturday Night, Jim Cornette, the Bodies and Bobby Eaton (who Cornette once again began to manage) confronted the Express during an interview. Bill Watts came out and suggested the Bodies should wrestle the Express. Cornette objected since he claimed that they weren't dressed for it, but the match still took place. The Express won the match by DQ when Eaton interfered in the match, and after the match while Lane held Morton, Cornette put his tennis racket over Morton while Eaton delivered his \\"Alabama jam\\" on Morton. Cornette then struck referee Nick Patrick, and then Cornette helped his men beat up the Express. The following week, Watts came out with the SMW commissioner Bob Armstrong, who stated he was very upset with Cornette's recent actions, and demanded that Cornette come out to apologize for what he had done. Watts stated that the Express was scheduled to wrestle the Wrecking Crew (Rage and Fury) at SuperBrawl III, but then said the Express should wrestle the Bodies instead. Armstrong agreed with Watts and then told Cornette if his Bodies did not wrestle the Express at SuperBrawl III that he would be heavily fined, the Bodies would be stripped of the title, and that he would be suspended. Cornette was very angry and claimed \\"That he hated WCW!\\" and later came out to the ring with his men, and attacked two jobbers after a match, one being Joey Maggs. The Express then came out and attacked Cornette and his gang. During Cornette's second stint in WCW, his Heavenly Bodies teamed with Steve Austin and Brian Pillman in 8-man tag team matches against the Express and the Unified tag team champions Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas. The Bodies, Austin and Pillman lost two of those matches, one on a February 27 episode of WCW WorldWide by DQ when Cornette interfered, and one by pinfall.Wrestle America, June 1993 issue, p.25. The feud between the Bodies and Express would take place in both SMW and WCW. Bobby Eaton would go to SMW where he would team in 6-man tag team matches with the Bodies. In one of these matches, the Express had a person covered by a sheet in their corner, and after the match Cornette with his men came to the ring to see who was under the sheet and began poking, and kicking at the sheeted man. When Cornette pulled the sheet off, it was Arn Anderson, Eaton's former tag team partner in The Dangerous Alliance, who was underneath; Cornette then fell over in shock. Eaton then tried to shake Anderson's hand, but Arn decked him. Arn said the reason for this was because after he was injured by Erik Watts at a gas station, Eaton never once called him to see how he was doing. Cornette belittled Anderson and claimed that his men were far superior to him.Wrestle America, June 1993 issue, pp.62-63. Eaton was also very successful in Smoky Mountain, and under Cornette's guidance he won the SMW TV title.Wrestle America, June 1993 issue, p.60 When the Bodies faced the Express at SuperBrawl III, Eaton came out with Cornette, he was despite Cornette's protests forced to return to the dressing room. Like almost always Cornette tried to interfere in the match. When Cornette climbed onto the ring apron and began to argue with the referee, the Express won the match by pinfall when an illegal outside attempt from Eaton, who had since come back to the ring failed. ===Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1991–1995)=== A firm believer in \\"old-school\\" territorial wrestling, Cornette began the Smoky Mountain Wrestling promotion in 1991. SMW promoted shows in Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas. By this point, however, the nature of wrestling in the U.S. had already changed irrevocably, leading Cornette to seek a working relationship with the World Wrestling Federation in 1993. This did not change the new national perception that regional promotions were \\"minor league\\". The move also did not help the federation's finances, and Cornette closed SMW's doors in November 1995 and sold all SMW rights and videos to the WWF. Cornette later said that he chose the wrong time to start a wrestling federation because the business as a whole was in a recession. ===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1993–2005)=== Cornette went to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1993 while still serving as promoter of SMW. As he had done in other promotions, Cornette held several positions in the WWF, including manager, color commentator and member of the booking committee. Cornette's most notable managerial role in the WWF was as the \\"American spokesperson\\" of WWF Champion Yokozuna. Cornette joined the WWF full-time in 1996 after the demise of SMW, and had a major role in scouting and developing new talent. On screen, he led a top-heel stable of wrestlers referred to as \\"Camp Cornette\\". At any given time, Cornette's charges consisted of Yokozuna, Mantaur, Vader, Owen Hart and The British Bulldog. He also served as the manager of Tom Prichard and Jimmy Del Ray during their brief stint in the WWF. In 1997, Cornette became a member of the WWF announce team where he served as a color commentator. It was during this time that he also began performing a series of controversial \\"worked shoots\\" where he would praise what he felt was right and condemn what he felt was wrong in professional wrestling. Although the segments were produced by the WWF, Cornette did not hesitate to give praise to WCW wrestlers that he felt deserved it. Cornette also became active behind the scenes working on the booking committee for several years before being removed after frequently butting heads with writer Vince Russo. Cornette also was part of the television production staff during this time but eventually left this position as well due in part to constant conflict with producer Kevin Dunn and head writer Vince Russo. Cornette later recounted that things came to a head in Halifax, Nova Scotia in the summer of 1997. During the production meeting for Raw, which was to feature the newly signed The Patriot, Cornette repeatedly tried to steer the discussion toward the treatment of what he thought was a new top of the line heroic character. Dunn told Cornette that he found him to be \\"tiresome\\" for continuing to harp on the issue, which enraged Cornette to the point where he mocked Dunn's buck teeth and threatened to assault him in front of everyone in the room. He was eventually forced to apologize to Dunn for his actions. In 1998, Cornette led an NWA invasion, based on the old Crockett Promotions territory, with a stable including Jeff Jarrett, Barry Windham and The Rock 'n' Roll Express. Later that year, Cornette managed Dan Severn and The New Midnight Express before he stepped back from managing. Cornette then did some color commentating, primarily on Sunday Night Heat, before disappearing from television. Cornette returned to WWF television for one night at WrestleMania X-Seven in Houston, where he took part in the \\"gimmick battle royal\\" but was quickly eliminated by Hillbilly Jim. Cornette later became lead booker and part owner of Ohio Valley Wrestling, WWE's lead developmental territory at the time, run by \\"Nightmare\\" Danny Davis. As a talent developer, Cornette had previously been instrumental in developing current and former WWE Superstars such as Kane, D'Lo Brown, Sunny and Al Snow during his time running SMW. WWE credits Cornette with helping foster numerous successful superstars including John Cena, Dave Bautista, Randy Orton and Brock Lesnar. In May 2005, Cornette was suspended for several weeks by WWE after slapping OVW developmental wrestler Anthony Carelli backstage after Carelli had \\"no-sold\\" fellow wrestler The Boogeyman by laughing at him during a live OVW event. Shortly after Cornette returned from his suspension, a separate incident occurred and the WWE released him from his contract in July 2005. In the spring of 2007, Carelli, who had since been called up to the WWE as Santino Marella, appeared on a Canadian radio program where he publicly challenged Cornette to a match despite Cornette working for rival promotion TNA at the time. ===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2006–2009)=== In 2006, Cornette joined TNA Wrestling as the new face of TNA Management. He held the title of \\"Management Director\\" according to the press releases following his premiere at the Slammiversary PPV event on June 18, 2006 in Orlando, Florida. After a brief speech, he departed, but returned at the end of the show in light of the \\"Orlando Screwjob\\", taking the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt after Jeff Jarrett, Larry Zbyszko and Earl Hebner successfully executed a screwjob on Christian Cage and Sting. As the figurehead \\"Management Director\\" of TNA, Cornette did not usually take up more than ten minutes of the show, which could be attributed to both his quick tongue and TNA's lack of desire to create another Mr. McMahon. Matt Morgan had also become Cornette's on-screen bodyguard to prevent harm to his physical being, until leaving that post to become a full-time wrestler. Part of Cornette's gimmick was that when multiple situations build up at once, he often took care of them all swiftly by getting all the TNA wrestlers to come out to the Impact! Zone for a \\"company meeting\\" to hear his decisions, or exasperatedly deal swiftly with people who barge into his office. The clear impact of this feature was made evident right from the start, as the first \\"company meeting\\" (which aired on the edition of June 29, 2006 of TNA Impact!), where every wrestler was asked to come out and stand at either ramp, saw Cornette clear up several issues: *Forcing The Latin American Xchange to start wrestling again under the threat of termination. *Booking Raven and Zbyszko in a hair vs. hair match against each other for Victory Road 2006. *Disbanding Team Canada as a result of their overly cheating ways (he would later offer them a match which, if they won, would allow them to stay as a unit, with the winner to get a future shot at the championship of their choice; they would lose the match). *Firing Earl Hebner for his role in the \\"Orlando Screwjob\\" at Slammiversary 2006. (Hebner had since been rehired, due to a lie detector test on Jeff Jarrett). *Booking America's Most Wanted and Gail Kim in a match against Sirelda, A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels in an intergender six-person tag team matchup with Styles and Daniels' NWA World Tag Team Championship on the line. *Booking a fatal four-way between Christian Cage, Sting, Scott Steiner, and Samoa Joe for Victory Road 2006. *Finally declaring Jeff Jarrett the official NWA World Heavyweight Champion given that Jarrett defended his title against the winner of the fatal four-way at Victory Road. Cornette was released from TNA on September 15, 2009. He has said that he was released because he was not \\"100 percent\\" behind TNA's creative team, headed by Vince Russo. ===Return to ROH and OVW (2009–2012)=== Cornette (right) with Adam Pearce In 2009, Cornette signed a contract with Ring of Honor to be their Executive Producer for the Ring of Honor Wrestling show on HDNet. Cornette made his surprise return to ROH at Glory By Honor VIII: The Final Countdown on September 26, announcing he was the new executive producer for the show. Cornette made his first appearance on Ring of Honor Wrestling on the December 7 episode and immediately made waves by putting ROH champion Austin Aries into a four-way title match later that night and created the Pick 6 contender series. On September 8, 2010, Ohio Valley Wrestling announced that Cornette would resume his duties as the head booker of the promotion. Cornette left OVW in November 2011, when the promotion announced a working agreement with TNA. On the edition of January 21 of Ring of Honor television, Cornette announced that chairshots to the head were banned and anyone that did so would be fined $5,000. On the February 4 telecast, Cornette made another ban in which the piledriver—in any form—is banned. On October 8, 2012, it was reported that ROH had replaced Cornette as the head booker with Hunter Johnston, a wrestler who performed under the name Delirious. ROH wrote Cornette off television by having him suffer storyline injuries at the hands of Jay Lethal. As of November 2012, it was revealed that Cornette had left the promotion. The reason for Cornette's absence stems from an outburst he had at the November 3 ROH television taping. At the taping, ROH talent Steve Corino suffered an injury, and no ROH officials were still at the venue to be able to pay for Corino's immediate medical attention or even arrange for an ambulance to be called. This left Corino in pain for hours and Cornette to be the only person there with enough power to handle the situation. Following his departure from Ring of Honor, Cornette decided to take an extended break from professional wrestling to focus on his health and work on personal projects. === What Culture Pro Wrestling (2016–2017) === On October 6, 2016, Cornette made his first appearance doing color commentary in two years, debuting for What Culture Pro Wrestling at their Refuse to Lose event in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. He would be joined on the announce team by his long-time friend Jim Ross, who he had not done commentary with in over fifteen years. He then provided commentary for their next event True Legacy, which took place a few days later. Cornette returned to WCPW at their April 1, 2017 State of Emergency event. At the event, Cornette and Matt Striker provided commentary for the British promotion's debut in the United States. ===WWE appearances (2017–2018)=== On March 31, 2017, Jim Cornette made his first appearance with WWE in 12 years when he inducted The Rock 'n' Roll Express into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2017. Cornette was also featured in an episode of the WWE Network Original series \\"Table For 3\\" alongside Eric Bischoff and Michael Hayes. Since then Cornette made another appearance for WWE, starring in an episode of the WWE Network Original Series \\"Photo Shoot\\" in March 2018. ===Return to Impact Wrestling (2017)=== Cornette returned to Impact Wrestling, which had formerly been known as TNA, and was attempting to rebrand as Global Force Wrestling (GFW), on August 17, 2017, at Destination X and fired Bruce Prichard. Cornette stated that he was put in charge by Impact's parent company, Anthem Sports & Entertainment, to resolve the Unified GFW World Heavyweight Championship situation. Cornette made the decision to book Low Ki as the twentieth entrant in the GFW World Heavyweight Championship gauntlet match. On September 18, Cornette confirmed he was done with the company. He had been brought in by Jeff Jarrett and the original agreement only included one set of tapings. With Jarrett out of the company, the new creative team was said to be more focused on in-ring action and less on authority figures. According to Cornette, there was no \\"heat\\" between him and the company. ===National Wrestling Alliance (2018–2019)=== The National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) chose Jim Cornette to be the color commentator for the NWA 70th Anniversary show that took place on October 21, 2018. This was the first pay- per-view promoted by the NWA in years. Cornette was joined on commentary by Tony Schiavone for the main event NWA World Heavyweight Championship match between Nick Aldis and Cody Rhodes. He returned to the promotion for the NWA's Crockett Cup tournament on April 27, 2019. On September 12, Cornette was announced as part of the commentary team for the NWA's weekly studio series, NWA Power. However, on the NWA Power episode broadcast on November 19 during a match between Nick Aldis and Trevor Murdoch, Cornette made the remark \\"[Trevor Murdoch] is the only man I've ever known that can strap a bucket of fried chicken on his back and ride a motor scooter across Ethiopia. Trevor Murdoch can take care of himself!\\" Later on the same day, the NWA apologized for the perceived racial overtones of the comment and pulled down the episode to remove the remark. The next day, Cornette left the NWA. Cornette had previously made the same comment on commentary during the March 6, 1995 episode of Monday Night Raw. === Major League Wrestling (2019) === Cornette debuted for Major League Wrestling (MLW) as a color commentator for the March 2, 2019 event Intimidation Games in Chicago, Illinois. He then returned to the commentary desk for their April 2019 events, Rise of the Renegades and Battle Riot II. From the start, he would also work unofficially in an agent-like role for the company. This included coaching younger talent on their television presentation and promos. In March he confirmed he is not signed exclusively to the company, but is open to continually working with them. After immediately being uncertain of his future with them, Cornette continued to do commentary for them, working Fury Road in June and their following event in July. It was reported that following that show he was not signed on for any further shows, as Tony Schiavone had finished his sports commitments and returned to the MLW commentary table. == Controversies == Journalist Justin Barrasso of Sports Illustrated wrote in 2019 that \\"Cornette remains one of wrestling's more controversial personalities, but his beliefs are rooted in more than four decades of wrestling experience.\\" Cornette has been very vocal against other styles of wrestling, such as Paul Heyman's Extreme Championship Wrestling hardcore style, which he referred to as \\"hardcore bullshit\\". \\"Comedy wrestling\\" (that which is deemed silly or goofy as opposed to serious) has also been on the receiving end of his rants, with him routinely criticizing those he considers \\"comedy wrestlers\\" such as Joey Ryan, Kenny Omega, and Chuck Taylor. He has also criticized the physical appearance of wrestlers; for example Marko Stunt's height or Kevin Steen and Joey Janela's weight. Cornette has garnered some support from industry personalities including NWA Champion Nick Aldis, who wrote an article for Flagged Sports defending Cornette and his position as NWA commentator after a separate article asked promoters to stop hiring him. Independent wrestler Phil Earley accused Cornette of pressuring other wrestlers into having sex with his wife during the Speaking Out movement in 2020. Cornette has vehemently denied the allegations. ===Conflicts with Vince Russo=== Cornette worked with writer Vince Russo in the WWF during the 1990s and in TNA during the 2000s and regularly conflicted with him due to his views on the business, which emphasize entertainment storylines over actual in-ring action. Cornette has criticized Russo publicly since his departure from TNA in 2009, which Cornette has stated was a result of his lack of support for Russo's creative direction in the company. In March 2010, Cornette sent then-TNA official Terry Taylor an email in which he said: \\"I want Vince Russo to die. If I could figure out a way to murder him without going to prison, I would consider it the greatest accomplishment of my life.\\" TNA sent the letter to a California law firm, who characterized his comments as a \\"terroristic threat\\" and said \\"any further threats to contact Vince Russo or any other TNA personnel (directly or indirectly) shall be viewed as acts in furtherance of such threats and shall be pursued and prosecuted accordingly.\\" During a 2017 podcast, Cornette challenged Russo to a fight. Russo responded by filing a restraining order (EPO) against Cornette for \\"stalking him across state lines since 1999.\\" As a response, Cornette began selling autographed copies of the restraining order on his personal website, with all proceeds being donated to the Crusade for Children. The Russo vs. Cornette rivalry was prominently featured in Viceland's Dark Side of the Ring episodes covering the Montreal Screwjob and WWF's Brawl for All, which aired in 2019 and 2020 respectively. ==Personal life== Cornette and his longtime girlfriend Stacey Goff were married October 31, 2007. Goff had previously worked as a manager in Cornette's OVW promotion under the ring name \\"Synn.\\" Goff, as Synn, was the OVW manager of future WWE Champion Batista. Cornette currently hosts two podcasts, The Jim Cornette Experience and Jim Cornette's Drive-Thru. In early April 2020, Cornette's YouTube channel exceeded 100,000 subscribers, earning him a Silver Play Button. Cornette is a supporter of left-wing politics and has been described by Cenk Uygur as a \\"fire-breathing progressive.\\" In September 2009, during a podcast interview on Who's Slamming Who?, he voiced his support for President Barack Obama's health care reform plans. Cornette had previously described himself as a Democrat and acknowledged having voted for Obama in the 2008 presidential election. Cornette, inversely, is a fierce critic of right-wing politics, condemning what he considers \\"fearmongering\\" from the Republican Party as well as controversially labeling former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as \\"a useless twat.\\" His political beliefs and statements have earned him attention from the non-professional wrestling media, including an appearance on Internet talk show The Young Turks. On December 17, 2017, Cornette stated that he is a democratic socialist. In March 2018, Cornette voiced his support for the March for Our Lives rally; he made additional statements advocating for gun control and criticizing the NRA. Cornette is an atheist and is highly critical of religion. Cornette has a criminal record which includes a number of assaults, mostly stemming from incidents involving fights with fans who attacked him while he was a manager in the 1980s. The record has made it difficult for him to work in Canada, which resulted in him being turned away from the Canadian border in November 2010. Former Knox County, Tennessee, mayor Tim Burchett declared November 17, 2014 \\"Jim Cornette Day\\" during a Southeastern Championship Wrestling taping in Knoxville. ==Awards and accomplishments== *The Baltimore Sun **Non-Wrestler of the Year (2007) *Cauliflower Alley Club **Other honoree (1997) *Iconic Heroes Wrestling Excellence **Southern Wrestling Hall of Fame (2015)Texas Wrestling Hall Of Fame at Cagematch.net *National Wrestling Alliance **NWA Hall of Fame (Class of 2005) *New England Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame ** Class of 20152015 Hall of Fame Class *Pro Wrestling Illustrated **Manager of the Year (1985, 1993, 1995) *Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum **Class of 2012 *World Wrestling Federation ** Slammy Award (2 times) *** Best Dressed (1994) *** Blue Light Special for Worst Dresser (1996) *Wrestling Observer Newsletter **Best Booker (1993, 2001, 2003) **Best Non-Wrestler (2006) **Best on Interviews (1985–1988, 1993) **Manager of the Year (1984–1990, 1992–1996) **Best Pro Wrestling Book (2009) **Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 1996) ==References* * Category:1961 births Category:American atheists Category:American color commentators Category:American gun control activists Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:American men podcasters Category:American podcasters Category:American television writers Category:Critics of religions Category:Kentucky Democrats Category:Kentucky socialists Category:Living people Category:People charged with assault Category:American male television writers Category:Ohio Valley Wrestling Category:Professional wrestlers from Kentucky Category:Professional wrestling announcers Category:Professional wrestling executives Category:Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum Category:Professional wrestling managers and valets Category:Professional wrestling promoters Category:Professional wrestling trainers Category:Screenwriters from Kentucky Category:Smoky Mountain Wrestling Category:Sportspeople from Louisville, Kentucky ","title":"Jim Cornette"},{"id":"1442407","text":"Michael A. James Baldasaro (May 23, 1949 – June 9, 2016) was a Canadian political and religious figure from Hamilton, Ontario. He presided over a religious sect known as the Church of the Universe. Baldasaro received significant media coverage over his lifetime for his advocacy on behalf of marijuana legalization, as well as his status as a perennial candidate in numerous Hamilton-area elections. ==The Church of the Universe== Baldasaro was a member of the Church of the Universe, where he was commonly known as Brother Michael. The Church has been in existence since 1969, when it was founded by the late Walter Tucker,Nolan, Daniel. \\"Pot advocate Walter Tucker dies at 79\\" The Hamilton Spectator, April 27, 2012 and Baldasaro remained continuously active in its operations.Loehndorf, Daniel. \\"The Canadian Inquisition: History and Beliefs of the Church of the Universe,\\" Cannabis Culture Magazine, Issue 9, Summer 1997.

In 2004, after selling small amounts of marijuana on multiple occasions to an undercover police officer at their Barton Street, Hamilton residence, Baldasaro and Tucker were arrested and charged with trafficking.

A modified licence model was built by Oeffag for the Austro-Hungarian Air Service (Luftfahrtruppen). The D.III was flown by many top German aces, including Wilhelm Frankl, Erich Löwenhardt, Manfred von Richthofen, Karl Emil Schäfer, Ernst Udet, and Kurt Wolff, and Austro-Hungarian ones, like Godwin von Brumowski. It was the preeminent fighter during the period of German aerial dominance known as \\"Bloody April\\" 1917. ==Design and development== Ernst Udet in front of his Albatros D.III (serial D.1941/16) Albatros D.III fighters of Jasta 11 at Douai, France. The second closest aircraft was one of several flown by Manfred von Richthofen A lineup of Albatros D.III fighters of Jagdstaffel 50 - mid to late 1917. The subdued staffel scheme of black and white stripes and chevrons can be seen on the fuselage and tailplanes of most machines, which are otherwise in factory finish. An Albatros D.III wreck in Flanders, 1917 Development of the prototype D.III started in late July or early August 1916.Grosz 2003, p. 6. The date of the maiden flight is unknown, but is believed to have occurred in late August or early September. Following the successful Albatros D.I and D.II series, the D.III utilized the same semi- monocoque, plywood-skinned fuselage. However, at the request of the Idflieg (Inspectorate of Flying Troops), the D.III adopted a sesquiplane wing arrangement broadly similar to the French Nieuport 11. The upper wingspan was extended, while the lower wing was redesigned with reduced chord and a single main spar. \\"V\\" shaped interplane struts replaced the previous parallel struts. For this reason, British aircrews commonly referred to the D.III as the \\"V-strutter.\\" After a Typenprüfung (official type test) on 26 September 1916, Albatros received an order for 400 D.III aircraft, the largest German production contract to date.Grosz 2003, p. 8. Idflieg placed additional orders for 50 aircraft in February and March 1917.VanWyngarden 2007, p. 19. ==Operational history== The D.III entered squadron service in December 1916, and was immediately acclaimed by German aircrews for its maneuverability and rate of climb. Two faults with the new aircraft were soon identified. Like the D.II, early D.IIIs featured a Teves und Braun airfoil-shaped radiator in the center of the upper wing, where it tended to scald the pilot if punctured. From the 290th D.III onward, the radiator was offset to the right on production machines while others were soon moved to the right as a field modification. Aircraft deployed in Palestine used two wing radiators, to cope with the warmer climate. More seriously, the new aircraft immediately began experiencing failures of the lower wing ribs and leading edge, a defect shared with the Nieuport 17. On 23 January 1917, a Jasta 6 pilot suffered a failure of the lower right wing spar. On the following day, Manfred von Richthofen suffered a crack in the lower wing of his new D.III. On 27 January, the Kogenluft (Kommandierender General der Luftstreitkräfte) issued an order grounding all D.IIIs pending resolution of the wing failure problem.Grosz 2003, p. 11. On 19 February, after Albatros introduced a reinforced lower wing, the Kogenluft rescinded the grounding order.Grosz 2003, p. 13. New production D.IIIs were completed with the strengthened wing while operational D.IIIs were withdrawn to Armee-Flugparks for modifications, forcing Jastas to use the Albatros D.II and Halberstadt D.II during the interim.Grosz 2003, pp. 11, 13.Franks, Giblin, McCrery 1998, p. 59. At the time, the continued wing failures were attributed to poor workmanship and materials at the Johannisthal factory. In fact, the cause of the wing failures lay in the sesquiplane arrangement taken from the Nieuport. While the lower wing had sufficient strength in static tests, it was subsequently determined that the main spar was located too far aft, causing the wing to twist under aerodynamic loads. Pilots were therefore advised not to perform steep or prolonged dives in the D.III. This design flaw persisted despite attempts to rectify the problem in the D.III and succeeding D.V. Apart from its structural deficiencies, the D.III was considered pleasant and easy to fly, if somewhat heavy on the controls. The sesquiplane arrangement offered improved climb, maneuverability, and downward visibility compared to the preceding D.II. Like most contemporary aircraft, the D.III was prone to spinning, but recovery was straightforward. Albatros built approximately 500 D.III aircraft at its Johannisthal factory. In the spring of 1917, D.III production shifted to Albatros' subsidiary, Ostdeutsche Albatros Werke (OAW), to permit Albatros to concentrate on development and production of the D.V.Grosz 2003, p. 18. Between April and August 1917, Idflieg issued five separate orders for a total of 840 D.IIIs. The OAW variant underwent its Typenprüfung in June 1917.Grosz 2003, p. 19. Production commenced at the Schneidemühl factory in June and continued through December 1917. OAW aircraft were distinguishable by their larger, rounded rudders.Grosz 2003, pp. 21–22. Peak service was in November 1917, with 446 aircraft on the Western Front. The D.III did not disappear with the end of production, however. It remained in frontline service well into 1918. As of 31 August 1918, 54 D.III aircraft remained on the Western Front. ==Austro- Hungarian variants== Albatros D.III (Oeffag) series 153, with spinner removed Albatros D.III (Oeffag) series 253, with later production rounded nose In the autumn of 1916, Oesterreichische Flugzeugfabrik AG (Oeffag) obtained a licence to build the D.III at Wiener-Neustadt. Deliveries commenced in May 1917. The aircraft were officially designated as Albatros D.III (Oeffag), but were known as Oeffag Albatros D.III in Austro-Hungary, and just Oeffag D.III in Poland. The Oeffag aircraft were built in three main versions (series 53.2, 153, 253) using the 138, 149, or 168 kW (185, 200, or 225 hp) Austro-Daimler engines respectively. The Austro-Daimlers provided improved performance over the Mercedes D.IIIa engine. For cold weather operations, Oeffag aircraft featured a winter cowling which fully enclosed the cylinder heads. Austrian pilots often removed the propeller spinner from early production aircraft, since it was prone to falling off in flight.Grosz, Haddow, Schiemer 2002, p. 251. Beginning with aircraft 112 of the series 153 production run, Oeffag introduced a new rounded nose that eliminated the spinner. Remarkably, German wind-tunnel tests showed that the simple rounded nose improved propeller efficiency and raised the top speed by 14 km/h (9 mph). All Oeffag variants were armed with two 8 mm (.315 in) Schwarzlose machine guns. In most aircraft, the guns were buried in the fuselage, where they were inaccessible to the pilot. In service, the Schwarzlose proved to be somewhat less reliable than the 7.92 mm (.312 in) LMG 08/15, mainly due to problems with the synchronization gear. The Schwarzlose also had a poor rate of fire until the 1916 model was provided with a modification developed by Ludwig Kral. At the request of pilots, the guns were relocated to the upper fuselage decking late in the series 253 production run. It helped to warm up the guns on high altitude. This created a new problem; the Schwarzlose operated via blowback and the weapon contained a cartridge oiler to prevent cases from sticking in the chamber while the extractor ripped their rims off. With guns mounted directly in front of the pilot, oil released during firing interfered with aim. Oeffag engineers noted the wing failures of the D.III and modified the lower wing to use thicker ribs and spar flanges. These changes, as well as other detail improvements, largely resolved the structural problems that had plagued German versions of the D.III.Grosz, Haddow, Schiemer 2002, p. 249. In service, the Oeffag aircraft proved to be popular, robust, and effective. Oeffag built approximately 526 D.III aircraft between May 1917 and the Armistice (586 in totalMorgała (1997), p.154-156 according to other publications). ==Postwar== Albatros D.III (Oeffag) series 253 of Polish 7th Air Escadrille A captured Albatros D.III paraded through London, November 1918 After the Armistice, in early 1919 Poland bought 38 series 253 aircraft from the factory, ten more were rebuilt from wartime leftovers. Poland operated them in the Polish-Soviet War of 1919–20 in two fighter escadrilles (Nos. 7 and 13). Due to rare air encounters, they were primarily employed in ground- attack duties. The Poles thought so highly of the D.III that they sent a letter of commendation to the Oeffag factory. They remained in service until 1923. Poland also had 26 original Albatros D.III, mostly captured from former occupants, but they were withdrawn from use in December 1919 due to structural weaknesses.Morgała (1997), p.125-126 The newly formed Czechoslovak Air Force also obtained and operated several Oeffag machines after the war. ==Modern reproductions== An Austrian aviation enthusiast, Koloman Mayrhofer, has completed a pair of Albatros D.III (Oeffag) series 253 reproductions. Both are equipped with vintage Austro-Daimler engines. One aircraft will be flown and operated by a non-profit organization.

The program was first broadcast in 1989. Hosted by Kai Ryssdal since 2005, the show is produced and distributed by American Public Media. Marketplace is produced in Los Angeles with bureaus in New York, Washington, D.C., Portland, Baltimore, London, and Shanghai. It won a Peabody Award in 2000.60th Annual Peabody Awards, May 2001. ==History== Marketplace was founded in 1989 by James Russell in Long Beach, California. It was initially affiliated with KLON-FM at Cal State—Long Beach and distributed by American Public Radio, later renamed Public Radio International. The show nearly ran out of funding its first year, which Russell described, saying, \\"We were within three days of laying off our small staff and closing down.\\" The program survived through the help of the University of Southern California (USC), who acquired the show, and later, in 1990, with the underwriting of General Electric. USC became the only university in the US at the time to produce a daily news program distributed nationally. In 2000, Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) acquired Marketplace Productions from USC. This acquisition was the subject of a lawsuit by Public Radio International. In 2004, American Public Media was founded as the production and distribution arm of MPR, and is currently the producer and distributor of Marketplace. ==Demographics== As of 2014, Marketplaces programs reached upwards of 12 million listeners with an average income of $101,000. == Companion programs == A sister program, the Marketplace Morning Report, offers seven unique seven-minute, thirty-second morning broadcasts that replace the business news-oriented \\"E\\" segment of NPR's Morning Edition on many public radio stations. Since September 2014, Marketplace Morning Report has been incorporated into Morning Edition as a segment in the latter program's second hour. The Marketplace brand also took over the money advice program Sound Money, which was renamed Marketplace Money in 2005, with content oriented toward a personal finance theme. The three shows share reporters and editorial staff. Marketplace Money was replaced with Marketplace Weekend in June 2014. Marketplace Weekend was cancelled in 2018. ===Podcasts=== All four radio programs are made available as free podcasts, along with a podcast combining all shows. In 2015, Marketplace began to offer digital-only (non-broadcast content) podcasts: Actuality, Codebreaker, and Corner Office.

It is located about southwest of Philadelphia. Prior to 1996, Chadds Ford Township was known as Birmingham Township; the name was changed to allow the township to correspond to both its census-designated place and to distinguish itself from the adjacent Birmingham Township in Chester County. As of the 2010 census, Chadds Ford Township had a population of 3,640, up from 3,170 at the 2000 census. Chadds Ford was home to N.C. Wyeth, his son Andrew Wyeth, and grandson Jamie Wyeth. The Brandywine Battlefield (site of the Battle of Brandywine) is located in the township, along with the Brandywine River Museum, which houses much of the Wyeth collection. Weldon Brinton Heyburn (1852–1912), a U.S. senator from Idaho, was born in Chadds Ford. ==History== The original name of the township, Birmingham, was given to the territory by William Brinton in remembrance of the town of the same name in England.

It is published weekly and is now part of Hachette Filipacchi Médias, which is itself owned by the Lagardère Group.Madjar, Robert (1997). Daniel Filipacchi. Editions Michel Lafon On occasion, Paris Match has sold more than one million copies worldwide when covering major events such as the first flight by a French astronaut aboard the U.S. Space Shuttle in June 1985. Benoît Clair, a senior writer for Paris Match, was the first journalist allowed to join the shuttle crew members from training until the departure for the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. A series of reports on the training was published in Paris Match on 22 April 1985, 17 June 1985 and 20 January 1986.Baudry, Patrick (1985). \\"Aujourd'hui le soleil se lève 16 fois\\" avec Benoit Clair. Editions Michel Lafon. As of 1996 the magazine had an independent political stance. ==Circulation== Paris Match had a circulation of 1,800,000 copies in 1958. The 1988 circulation of the magazine was 873,000 copies, making it the best- selling news weekly in the country. In 2001 the weekly was the tenth largest news magazine worldwide with a circulation of 630,000 copies. Paris Match had a circulation of 656,000 copies during the 2007–2008 period. In 2009 the magazine was the best selling photonews magazine in France with a circulation of 611,000 copies. Its circulation was 578,282 copies in 2014. ==In popular culture== In Hergé's Tintin adventure The Castafiore Emerald (1963), reporters from the imaginary \\"Paris-Flash\\" magazine (a clear spoof on Paris Match, with a similar logo) play a major role in the plot's development. The magazine is satirized as sensationalist and inaccurate. ==References== ==External links== * Category:News magazines published in France Category:Photojournalistic magazines Category:French-language magazines Category:Weekly magazines published in France Category:Lagardère Active Category:Magazines established in 1949 Category:1949 establishments in France Category:Magazines published in Paris Category:Weekly news magazines ","title":"Paris Match"},{"id":"1442437","text":"__NOTOC__ The following is a list of recurring Saturday Night Live sketches, organized alphabetically by title.

Papua New Guinea elects on national level a legislature. The National Parliament has 111 members, elected for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies. Papua New Guinea has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. The first-past-the-post voting system was previously used, but in 2002 the limited Instant-runoff voting system was enacted into law and first used during the 2007 national election and 2008 local electionsElections in Papua New Guinea IFES ==Electorates== Members of Parliament represent the 111 single-member electorates. The 20 provinces, the Autonomous Region of Bougainville and the National Capital District each elect a governor, who is also a representative in the parliament. Additionally there are 89 local (\\"Open\\") electorates, of which three are in the National Capital District and 86 are in the provinces, with boundaries of the latter corresponding directly to administrative districts. The Electoral Boundaries Commission, reporting in February 2006, suggested an additional 26 Open electorates be created. Legally, electoral boundaries must be reviewed every ten years, but due to political instability, no review occurred for 30 years. The future of the provincial electorates is under debate. Lady Carol Kidu, after being elected as the only female Member of Parliament in the 2007 general election, called for seats to be reserved for women to improve the representation of women in Parliament. She suggested that the 20 provincial seats could be reserved for women by the 2012 election. ==Electoral system== Candidates are elected using limited instant-runoff voting where the voter has to rank 3 candidates, known locally as Limited preferential voting. A candidate has to have majority of votes to be elected. If no one has an absolute majority of first preference votes, the candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated, and the votes are transferred to the voters next preferred candidate until one candidate has at least half of the remaining votes. The current system was first used for a by- election in 2003, and subsequently for the 2007 Elections. Previously, first- past-the-post voting was used. ==Latest elections== ==Past elections== Parliamentary elections were held from 30 June 2007 to 10 July 2007. For the first time, the election did not use first past the post (which has in the past resulted in a very volatile political system, with the election of a candidate being largely a matter of chance due to the large number of candidates), but rather limited preferential voting. ==See also== * Electoral calendar * Electoral system ==References== ==External links== *PNG Electoral Commission *Adam Carr's Election Archive ","title":"Elections in Papua New Guinea"},{"id":"1442448","text":"Elections in Paraguay gives information on election and election results in Paraguay.

All processes are overseen and managed in whole by the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission; an autonomous agency of the executive branch of the government of Puerto Rico. ==Types of elections== Three types of electoral processes can take place in Puerto Rico: general elections, referendum (aka, plebiscites), and special elections. General elections are held every four years on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November. During these elections the people of Puerto Rico elect both local and central government candidates. These include the governor, resident commissioner, members of the legislative assembly, including senators and representatives, mayors, and municipal assembly representatives. Referendums can occur after a law has been enacted calling for a one. Special elections occur when an unexpected vacancy occurs on a post or for other similar matters. Citizens of the United States residing in Puerto Rico can not vote for their head of state, the President of the United States, due to the political status of Puerto Rico. The 2016 Puerto Rican general election was held on November 8, 2016 which resulted in the election of Ricardo Rosselló as governor, Jenniffer González as Resident Commissioner, the member elections of the 18th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico (including the 26th Senate of Puerto Rico and the 30th House of Representatives of Puerto Rico), and the election of the 2017-2020 mayors and their respective municipal assemblies. The latest referendum was held on June 11, 2017 and resulted in Puerto Ricans overwhelmingly expressing themselves in favor of statehood with 97% of the vote in favor, though there was a 23% vote turnout, an event that, given the long history of Puerto Ricans voter turnout in their elections, called into question the significance of the results. ==Requirements== Only American citizens (including Puerto Rican citizens) who meet all of the following requirements may vote: be a legal resident of Puerto Rico, be at least 18 years old by the date of the election, must have been qualified by the Puerto Rico State Commission on Elections before the election or on the very same day of the election after he presents himself to his nearest place of voting and shows proper documentation, and must have not been declared mentally incapacitated by a court. ==Processes== Citizens cast their votes in colleges () which are simply usually the nearest public school to where the voter declared as residence. Citizens are required by law to vote in secret, unless they have a physical impairment that does not allow them to. Those unable to travel to colleges due to medical impairments may vote at their place of residence (homes, elder homes, etc.) or wherever they are convalescing (hospitals, clinics, etc.). In both of these extraordinary cases, officials from the Puerto Rico State Commission on Elections will provide aid so that the citizens can cast their vote—either by using verbal or non-verbal communication—with members from the different political parties required to observe the process in order to ensure accuracy, fairness, transparency, order, and legitimacy. Ballots are published in both English and Spanish regardless of whether English is an official language or not. ===General elections=== At the central government's level, Puerto Rican elects a governor and a legislature. The island's governor is elected for a four-year term by the people. The Legislative Assembly (Asamblea Legislativa in Spanish) has two chambers: the Chamber of Representatives (Cámara de Representantes in Spanish) and the Senate (Senado in Spanish) which is elected for a four-year term concurrently with the governor. For the last several decades, three political parties have been present on the ballot, the PIP, the PNP, and the PPD, which two of the three parties dominating the results of the elections. In the 2008 elections, a fourth party participated, the Puertorriqueños por Puerto Rico (PPR). In 2012 six parties participated, the same four as in 2008 and two new ones: Partido del Pueblo Trabajador (PPT), and Movimiento Union Soberanista (MUS). In 2016, 2 independent candidates ran for governor, while the MUS and the PPR did not have any candidates running. ==Electoral system== The Senate of Puerto Rico currently has 27 members, including 16 members elected from 8 two-seat electoral districts through plurality at large (each Senate district comprises 5 House districts), plus 11 at-large members. The House of Representatives of Puerto Rico currently (2019) has 51 members composed of 40 members elected in single-seat electoral districts using first-past-the-post, plus 11 at-large members. In each house, 11 at-large members are elected from an island-wide district based on single non-transferable vote. To avoid vote splitting, the two major parties will typically nominate only 6 members and smaller parties typically only nominate one. Additionally, parties may choose the ballot order of its candidates in different districts, in an attempt to signal to voters the preferred method of voting. However, each voter is free to choose any candidate. As the electoral system is majoritarian, the section 7 of Article III of the Puerto Rican constitution s:Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico allows for additional members to be added to either chamber to enhance the opposition party's representation. Members of the opposition will be added to provide a minimum of 17 and 9 members of the House and Senate, respectively (one third of the original size). In the last election, 2 and 3 members were added to the House and Senate, respectively. When the majority party polls less than two-thirds of the vote for Governor of Puerto Rico, minority seats in the Senate or the House are distributed using a variant of the Hare quota largest remainder method according to the minority parties' share of the vote for governor, subject to a 3% threshold. A slightly different procedure is provided for in the event the majority party wins more than two-thirds of the vote for governor, which limits each minority party to a number of seats not in excess of its proportionate share of its vote for governor (excluding rounding differences). Additional seats assigned to a minority party first go to defeated at-large candidates with the largest vote totals, and then, if necessary, to district candidates with the largest proportion of the vote who have not been elected (sometimes called the \\"best loser\\" system). == See also == * Politics of Puerto Rico * Political party strength in Puerto Rico * List of political parties in Puerto Rico ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Elections in Puerto Rico *Adam Carr's Election Archive * ","title":"Elections in Puerto Rico"},{"id":"1442451","text":"Elections in Rwanda take place within the framework of a multi-party democracy and a presidential system. The President and majority of members of the Chamber of Deputies are directly elected, whilst the Senate is indirectly elected and partly appointed. ==Electoral history== ===Pre-independence=== The Decree of 14 July 1952 by the Belgian colonial authorities introduced an element of democracy to the Rwandan political system. A complicated electoral system was created, which involved several stages of elections to eventually elect the national Superior Council;Dolf Sternberger, Bernhard Vogel, Dieter Nohlen & Klaus Landfried (1978) Die Wahl der Parlamente: Band II: Afrika, Zweiter Halbband, p1699 notables elected Sub-Chiefdom Councils; sub-chieds and notables elected Chiefdom Councils; sub-chiefs and Chiefdom Council members elected Territorial Councils, with chiefs and Territorial Councils electing the Superior Council member. Elections were held under this system in 1953–54 and 1956–57. The first direct elections were held in September 1961, with MDR- Parmehutu winning 35 of the 44 seats in the Legislative Assembly. ===Post- independence=== Following independence in 1962 the country became a one-party state with MDR-Parmehutu as the sole legal party. General elections were held in 1965 in which Grégoire Kayibanda was re-elected President unopposed, whilst the party won all 47 seats in the National Assembly; in the presidential elections voters could vote for or against Kayibanda's candidacy, whilst in the National Assembly elections voters could approve the entire MDR-Parmehutu list or give a preferential vote to one candidate. The 1969 elections were held under the same system with the same result. Following a 1973 coup, the next presidential elections were held in 1978, in which voters could vote for or against the candidacy of coup leader Juvénal Habyarimana; 99% voted in favour. Parliamentary elections were delayed until 1981 and saw the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND), the sole legal party, win all 64 seats. Habyarimana was re-elected with 99.97% of the vote in 1983, with parliamentary elections a week later seeing the MRND win all 70 seats. Habyarimana was re-elected again in 1988, this time with 99.98% of the vote, whilst the MRND won all 70 seats again in the parliamentary elections the following week. Due to the Rwandan Civil War and the subsequent genocide, the next elections were not held until 2003, by which time the country had reverted to being a multi-party democracy. Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) was re-elected as president in August 2003 with 95% of the vote, whilst the RPF-led coalition won 40 of the 53 elected seats in the September 2003 parliamentary elections. The coalition won 42 seats in the 2008 parliamentary elections, with Kagame re-elected again in 2010 with 93% of the vote. The RPF coalition retained its majority in the 2013 parliamentary elections, winning 41 seats. ==Electoral system== The voting age in Rwanda is 18. ===President=== The President of Rwanda is elected in one round of voting by plurality.Rwanda IFES ===Chamber of Deputies=== The 80 members of the Chamber of Deputies consisted of 53 directly elected members elected by proportional representation in a single nationwide constituency,Electoral system IPU 24 women elected by electoral colleges formed in the provinces (six from Eastern, Southern and Western, four from Northern and two from Kigali) and three members elected by mini-committees, two representing youth (elected by the National Youth Council) and one representing disabled people (elected by the Federation of the Associations of the Disabled.General information about the parliamentary chamber: Chamber of Deputies IPU ===Senate=== The Senate has 26 members, of which 14 are indirectly elected and 12 are appointed.

The 12 appointed members include eight appointed by the President and four appointed by the Forum of Political Organisations.General information about the parliamentary chamber: Senate IPU === Local elections === Elections are established at every tier of local government, except the provincial level, where the Governor is appointed by the national government. Elections are only direct elections by the citizens at the cell level. Members of sector and district councils are elected indirectly from the level below, with reserved seats for representatives of the interest groups of women and of youth. No candidate at local elections can claim partisan affiliation. ==Referendums== Four national referendums have been held in Rwanda; the first in 1961 decided the future of the monarchy, with 80% voting in favour of abolishing it. A constitutional referendum in 1978 introduced a constitution that made the National Revolutionary Movement for Development the sole legal party, and was approved by 89% of voters. Another new constitution was introduced following a 2003 referendum in which it was approved by 93% of voters. A fourth referendum in 2015 saw amendments to presidential term limits and length approved by 98% of voters. ==References== ==External links== *National Electoral Commission *Rwanda Adam Carr's Election Archive *Elections in Rwanda African Elections Database ","title":"Elections in Rwanda"},{"id":"1442460","text":"Raymundo \\"Battling\\" Torres (17 February 1941 - 11 November 1972) was a Mexican junior lightweight who fought from 1957 to 1967.Boxing, Sports Illustrated (September 28, 1959) (\\"Raymundo Torres, 18-year-old Mexican lightweight known as Battling Torres, knocked Frankie Ryff to the canvas in the Los Angeles Olympic Auditorium at the beginning of the first round, seconds later dropped him in the opposite corner with a right, then put him away for the count with a left.

The transpose or algebraic adjoint of a linear map is often used to study the original linear map. This concept is generalised by adjoint functors. == Definition == Let denote the algebraic dual space of a vector space . Let and be vector spaces over the same field . If is a linear map, then its algebraic adjoint or dual, is the map defined by . The resulting functional is called the pullback of by . The continuous dual space of a topological vector space (TVS) is denoted by . If and are TVSs then a linear map is weakly continuous if and only if , in which case we let denote the restriction of to . The map is called the transpose of . The following identity characterizes the transpose of : for all and where is the natural pairing (i.e. defined by ). == Properties == The assignment produces an injective linear map between the space of linear operators from to and the space of linear operators from to . If then the space of linear maps is an algebra under composition of maps, and the assignment is then an antihomomorphism of algebras, meaning that . In the language of category theory, taking the dual of vector spaces and the transpose of linear maps is therefore a contravariant functor from the category of vector spaces over to itself. One can identify with using the natural injection into the double dual. * If and are linear maps then . * If is a linear map, , , and denotes the polar set of the set then * , and * implies * if and are convex, weakly closed sets containing 0 then implies . * If is a (surjective) vector space isomorphism then so is the transpose . * The kernel of is the subspace of orthogonal to the image of . * The linear map is injective if and only if the its image is a weakly dense subset of (i.e. the image of is dense in when is given the weak topology induced by ).

Alternatively, as is represented by acting to the right on column vectors, is represented by the same matrix acting to the left on row vectors. These points of view are related by the canonical inner product on , which identifies the space of column vectors with the dual space of row vectors. == Relation to the Hermitian adjoint == The identity that characterizes the transpose, that is, , is formally similar to the definition of the Hermitian adjoint, however, the transpose and the Hermitian adjoint are not the same map. The transpose is a map and is defined for linear maps between any vector spaces and , without requiring any additional structure. The Hermitian adjoint maps and is only defined for linear maps between Hilbert spaces, as it is defined in terms of the inner product on the Hilbert space. The Hermitian adjoint therefore requires more mathematical structure than the transpose. However, the transpose is often used in contexts where the vector spaces are both equipped with a nondegenerate bilinear form such as the Euclidean dot product or another real inner product. In this case, the nondegenerate bilinear form is often used implicitly to map between the vector spaces and their duals, to express the transposed map as a map . For a complex Hilbert space, the inner product is sesquilinear and not bilinear, and these conversions change the transpose into the adjoint map. More precisely: if and are Hilbert spaces and is a linear map then the transpose of and the Hermitian adjoint of , which we will denote respectively by and , are related. Denote by and the canonical antilinear isometries of the Hilbert spaces and onto their duals.

The dual representation is also known as the contragredient representation. If is a Lie algebra and is a representation of it on the vector space , then the dual representation is defined over the dual vector space as follows:Lecture 8 of : = for all . The motivation for this definition is that Lie algebra representation associated to the dual of a Lie group representation is computed by the above formula. But the definition of the dual of a Lie algebra representation makes sense even if it does not come from a Lie group representation. In both cases, the dual representation is a representation in the usual sense. ==Properties== ===Irreducibility and second dual=== If a (finite-dimensional) representation is irreducible, then the dual representation is also irreducible Exercise 6 of Chapter 4—but not necessarily isomorphic to the original representation. On the other hand, the dual of the dual of any representation is isomorphic to the original representation. ===Unitary representations=== Consider a unitary representation \\\\rho of a group G, and let us work in an orthonormal basis. Thus, \\\\rho maps G into the group of unitary matrices. Then the abstract transpose in the definition of the dual representation may be identified with the ordinary matrix transpose. Since the adjoint of a matrix is the complex conjugate of the transpose, the transpose is the conjugate of the adjoint. Thus, \\\\rho^*(g) is the complex conjugate of the adjoint of the inverse of \\\\rho(g). But since \\\\rho(g) is assumed to be unitary, the adjoint of the inverse of \\\\rho(g) is just \\\\rho(g). The upshot of this discussion is that when working with unitary representations in an orthonormal basis, \\\\rho^*(g) is just the complex conjugate of \\\\rho(g). ===The SU(2) and SU(3) cases=== In the representation theory of SU(2), the dual of each irreducible representation does turn out to be isomorphic to the representation. But for the representations of SU(3), the dual of the irreducible representation with label (m_1,m_2) is the irreducible representation with label (m_2,m_1). Exercise 3 of Chapter 6 In particular, the standard three-dimensional representation of SU(3) (with highest weight (1,0)) is not isomorphic to its dual. In the theory of quarks in the physics literature, the standard representation and its dual are called \\"3\\" and \\"\\\\bar 3.\\" Two nonisomorphic dual representations of SU(3), with highest weights (1,2) and (2,1) ===General semisimple Lie algebras=== More generally, in the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras (or the closely related representation theory of compact Lie groups), the weights of the dual representation are the negatives of the weights of the original representation. Exercise 10 of Chapter 10 (See the figure.) Now, for a given Lie algebra, if it should happen that operator -I is an element of the Weyl group, then the weights of every representation are automatically invariant under the map \\\\mu\\\\mapsto -\\\\mu. For such Lie algebras, every irreducible representation will be isomorphic to its dual. (This is the situation for SU(2), where the Weyl group is \\\\\\\\{I,-I\\\\\\\\}.) Lie algebras with this property include the odd orthogonal Lie algebras \\\\operatorname{so}(2n+1;\\\\mathbb C) (type B_n) and the symplectic Lie algebras \\\\operatorname{sp}(n;\\\\mathbb C) (type C_n). If, for a given Lie algebra, -I is not in the Weyl group, then the dual of an irreducible representation will generically not be isomorphic to the original representation. To understand how this works, we note that there is always a unique Weyl group element w_0 mapping the negative of the fundamental Weyl chamber to the fundamental Weyl chamber. Then if we have an irreducible representation with highest weight \\\\mu, the lowest weight of the dual representation will be -\\\\mu. It then follows that the highest weight of the dual representation will be w_0\\\\cdot(-\\\\mu)\\\\,. Exercise 10 of Chapter 10 Since we are assuming -I is not in the Weyl group, w_0 cannot be -I, which means that the map \\\\mu\\\\mapsto w_0\\\\cdot(-\\\\mu) is not the identity. Of course, it may still happen that for certain special choices of \\\\mu, we might have \\\\mu=w_0\\\\cdot(-\\\\mu). The adjoint representation, for example, is always isomorphic to its dual. In the case of SU(3) (or its complexified Lie algebra, \\\\operatorname{sl}(3;\\\\mathbb C)), we may choose a base consisting of two roots \\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha_1,\\\\alpha_2\\\\\\\\} at an angle of 120 degrees, so that the third positive root is \\\\alpha_3=\\\\alpha_1+\\\\alpha_2. In this case, the element w_0 is the reflection about the line perpendicular to \\\\alpha_3. Then the map \\\\mu\\\\mapsto w_0\\\\cdot(-\\\\mu) is the reflection about the line through \\\\alpha_3. Exercise 3 of Chapter 6 The self-dual representations are then the ones that lie along the line through \\\\alpha_3. These are the representations with labels of the form (m,m), which are the representations whose weight diagrams are regular hexagons. ==Motivation== In representation theory, both vectors in and linear functionals in are considered as column vectors so that the representation can act (by matrix multiplication) from the left. Given a basis for and the dual basis for , the action of a linear functional on , can be expressed by matrix multiplication, :\\\\langle\\\\varphi, v\\\\rangle \\\\equiv \\\\varphi(v) = \\\\varphi^Tv, where the superscript is matrix transpose. Consistency requires :\\\\langle{\\\\rho}^*(g)\\\\varphi, \\\\rho(g)v\\\\rangle = \\\\langle\\\\varphi, v\\\\rangle.Lecture 1, page 4 of With the definition given, :\\\\langle{\\\\rho}^*(g)\\\\varphi, \\\\rho(g)v\\\\rangle = \\\\langle\\\\rho(g^{-1})^T\\\\varphi, \\\\rho(g)v\\\\rangle = (\\\\rho(g^{-1})^T\\\\varphi)^T \\\\rho(g)v = \\\\varphi^T\\\\rho(g^{-1})\\\\rho(g)v = \\\\varphi^Tv = \\\\langle\\\\varphi, v\\\\rangle. For the Lie algebra representation one chooses consistency with a possible group representation. Generally, if is a representation of a Lie group, then given by :\\\\pi(X) = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\Pi(e^{tX})_{t = 0}. is a representation of its Lie algebra. If is dual to , then its corresponding Lie algebra representation is given by :\\\\pi^*(X) = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\Pi^*(e^{tX})_{t = 0} = \\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\Pi(e^{-tX})^T_{t = 0} = -\\\\pi(X)^T. Lecture 8, page 111 of ==Example== Consider group G of complex numbers of absolute value 1. The irreducible representations are all one dimensional, as a consequence of Schur's lemma. The irreducible representations are parameterized by integers n and given explicitly as :\\\\rho_n(e^{i\\\\theta})=[e^{in\\\\theta}]. The dual representation to \\\\rho_n is then the inverse of the transpose of this one-by- one matrix, that is, :\\\\rho_n^*(e^{i\\\\theta})=[e^{-in\\\\theta}]=\\\\rho_{-n}(e^{i\\\\theta}). That is to say, the dual of the representation \\\\rho_n is \\\\rho_{-n}. ==Generalization== A general ring module does not admit a dual representation. Modules of Hopf algebras do, however. ==See also== * Complex conjugate representation *Tensor product of representations * Kirillov Character Formula ==References== * .

He is commonly credited as one of the original founders of the city of Phoenix, Arizona. Swilling also played an important role in the opening of the central Arizona highlands to white settlement. His discoveries resulted in a gold rush to the region, and this in turn led to the establishment of Arizona's first territorial capital at the mining town of Prescott. John W. (Jack) Swilling (Sharlot Hall Museum) Swilling was both a Confederate States Army minuteman and a civilian aid to the United States Army during the American Civil War. He worked in a variety of disciplines throughout his life, including as a teamster, prospector, mine and mill owner, and saloon and dance hall owner, as well as a canal builder, farmer, rancher, and public servant. All of this was accomplished while he suffered from periods of excruciating pain resulting from major injuries he suffered in 1854. He took morphine to assuage the pain, which led to dependency problems for the rest of his life.Andrew Wallace (Spring 1961) John W. Swilling(Arizoniana. Vol. 2, No. 1 pp. 16-19. Arizona Historical Society) ==Biography== ===Early life=== John William \\"Jack\\" Swilling was born on April 1, 1830, at Red House Plantation, Anderson, South Carolina, to George Swilling and Margaret Farrar Swilling, the eighth of their 10 children. George Swilling was the son of the plantation manager, while Margaret Farrar's father, Thomas Farrar, was the owner. (Incidentally, Thomas Farrar's mother was Judith Jefferson, the sister of Peter Jefferson and aunt to the third president, Thomas Jefferson.) Farrar's parents did not approve of the marriage, so the young couple eloped. It took three years for her parents to accept the match. In time, George Swilling became owner of the plantation. When Jack Swilling was 14, the family moved from South Carolina to Georgia. Three years later he and an older brother enlisted in a mounted battalion of Georgia volunteers for service during the Mexican–American War. After the war, the two young men returned to Georgia. Jack Swilling's whereabouts are unknown for a brief time afterwards, although he was reported in Georgia for the Christmas of 1849. The next recorded events in his life are his marriage at Wetumpka, Alabama in 1852 to Mary Jane Gray and the birth of their daughter Elizabeth a year later. Swilling wrote in 1854 that he suffered serious injuries—a broken skull and a bullet lodged in his back—in unstated circumstances. Those injuries plagued him for the rest of his life and led to a dependency on drugs and alcohol. In 1856, on his 26th birthday, something happened to cause him to leave permanently for the West. There is more than a year's break in the historical record, but Swilling apparently joined the Leach Wagon Road Company at Fort Smith, Arkansas as a teamster in the summer of 1857, probably staying with the slow-moving oxen-drawn wagon train until its arrival a year later at Mesilla, in Traditional Arizona, which was then part of the New Mexico Territory. The years between Swilling's arrival in Arizona in 1858 and the founding of Phoenix almost a decade later were active and varied ones. After his arrival in Arizona, Swilling moved to southern California, where he joined in a gold rush near Los Angeles. A few months later he was drawn back to Arizona by the gold rush at Gila City, where he also worked for the Butterfield Overland Mail Company. ===Apache Wars and the American Civil War=== He was elected captain of the Gila Rangers militia company that was formed to provide protection from Apache stock raids on the miners and the stage company. The Gila Rangers, with the support of warriors from the friendly Maricopa tribe, made a January 1860 expedition to the unexplored Bradshaw Mountains of central Arizona in pursuit of Apache raiders. The expedition resulted in some noteworthy discoveries: the existence of the Hassayampa River and traces of mineral riches, including gold, in an area that appeared well-suited for ranching and farming. However, the area was too remote and dangerous for settlers at the time. Soon afterwards, the Gila City gold deposits ran out and Swilling followed his friend Colonel Jacob Snively to Pinos Altos, where he both mined and ran a saloon and dance hall. When the Union Army withdrew from the New Mexico Territory at the beginning of the Civil War, the men of Pinos Altos formed a militia company they named the Arizona Guards for defense against Apache attack. The secession of Confederate Arizona from the Union was officially declared in 1861, a territory which included all of the New Mexico Territory south of the 34th parallel. Swilling was elected second-in-command of the company, or First Lieutenant, and retained that rank when the Arizona Guards were absorbed into the Confederate Army. Swilling likely fought at the Battle of Pinos Altos, a Confederate victory and a battle which killed his commander, Captain Thomas J. Mastin (1839-1861). After a time spent defending against Apaches and acting as the de facto police force for the area around Pinos Altos, Swilling led a portion of the Arizona Guards that reinforced the garrison of Tucson in 1862. He is believed to have commanded a party of rebels who burned Stanwix Station and skirmished with the Union Army's California Column there in March. He was also involved in the noted incident at White's Mill at Casa Blanca, Arizona when Union Captain James McCleave was captured. Following the Union's capture of Tucson in May 1862, Swilling's company retreated and he became a civilian employee of the United States Army, first as a dispatch rider between General James Carleton's California Column and Union forces up the Rio Grande, and later as a scout in an anti-Apache campaign. He was involved in the campaign to take Mesilla which ended with a Union takeover of Confederate Arizona's capital. Near the end of that employment, he encountered the Joseph R. Walker exploratory party near Pinos Altos when Swilling led the capture of the famous Apache chief Mangas Coloradas. ===Further prospecting and marriage=== Swilling's war ended there and he convinced Joseph Walker and his group that there was gold in the central highlands of the new Arizona Territory. He then guided them to where the first Yavapai County mining district was formed, just a few miles south of present-day Prescott, on May 10, 1863. The expedition called it the Pioneer Mining District, and the rules they adopted were the area's first recorded laws. Swilling left the Walker party shortly after the formation of the Pioneer Mining District and joined up with the exploratory party of Pauline Weaver and Abraham Harlow Peeples (1842-1892), which arrived in the area shortly after the Walker group. He made a small fortune from the unusual surface gold mine at Rich Hill between Wickenburg and Prescott. News of his successes spread eastward when two gold samples from Swilling's claim sent to General James Henry Carleton were forwarded for presentation to President Abraham Lincoln. Next, Swilling was briefly part owner of a flour mill in Tucson, apparently in partnership with his neighbor Charles T. Hayden. Quickly tiring of Tucson, he returned to Yavapai County where he prospected, owned gold mines and gold milling operations, and farmed. In addition he also was the mail contractor between Prescott and the Pima villages below the Salt River Valley on the Gila River. In the midst of all this activity, Jack Swilling married a young Mexican woman of Spanish heritage named Trinidad Mejia Escalante (1847-1925). They were married on April 11, 1864, at Tucson's San Agustin Cathedral when Trinidad was about seventeen. Over the next fourteen years they had seven biological children, five girls and two boys, and adopted two Apache orphans, a boy and a girl. ===Swilling Irrigation and Canal Company=== Jack Swilling had the inspiration to form a canal company which would open the Salt River Valley to farming. On November 16, 1867, he formed the Swilling Irrigating and Canal Company at Wickenburg. Soon after, a small group of men headed by Jack Swilling started construction of the first modern-era irrigation canals in the Salt River Valley; other pioneers and travelers had seen and commented on ancient Hohokam canals in the area, but it was Swilling who organized the first successful modern irrigation project. The following summer, the first crops of wheat, barley and corn were harvested. He promoted the irrigation system, which was in part inspired by the ruins of the Hohokam canals. Swilling Irrigating and Canal Company started the small farming community of Phoenix that has since grown into one of the United States' largest metropolitan areas. Swilling claimed a quarter section south of what became Van Buren Street between 32nd and 36th Streets for his own farm. He built a nine-room, home there. His farm was a local showplace, featuring an artificial pond with tame ducks, a vineyard and an orchard with a variety of fruit trees. In the early days, Jack Swilling was one of the most prominent leaders of the Phoenix settlement. The first post office was established on June 15, 1868, in Swilling's homestead, with Swilling serving as the postmaster. He was also the first justice of the peace. He was involved in the planning and construction of additional canals, including the first ditch south of the Salt River in partnership with an old acquaintance and business partner, Charles T. Hayden, the founder of Tempe, Arizona and father of long-time Arizona Senator Carl T. Hayden. ===Death=== Once Phoenix was well-established and the so-called \\"original townsite\\" was located over three miles (5 km) to the west of his holdings, he lost interest and moved his growing family back to central Arizona. There he mined, farmed and ranched until he became a suspect in a stagecoach robbery near Wickenburg. By the spring of 1878, he and his family were living in the small mining community of Gillett, around the area of Black Canyon City. His health was failing, and his drinking had become a problem. Trinidad Swilling suggested that he go on a trip to recover and rebury the remains of their old friend, Colonel Jacob Snively, who had been killed by Apaches in the Wickenburg Mountains near the peak called White Picacho. While Swilling and two companions were on this journey, three hooded men—one tall, one medium-size, and one short—robbed a stagecoach near Wickenburg. This description matched that of Swilling and his companions and they became suspects in the robbery. Pima County Sheriff Wiley W. Standefer arrested Swilling and Andrew Kirby, but dropped the state charges so the federal courts could prosecute them and absorb the prosecution costs. Deputy U.S. Marshal Joseph W. Evans brought warrants for the two men to Prescott, where they were turned over to him, and Evans escorted them to the federal jail in Yuma. The sanitary conditions inside the prison at Yuma were very poor and, combined with the August heat plus the fact of his usage of a combination of narcotics and liquor to relieve the pain caused by old injuries ruined Jack Swilling's health further and eventually led to his death. He was released to the Hodges family, friends of the Swillings, and died in their home. The real culprits of the massacre were caught proving his innocence too late.Jack Swilling's Grave. The real robbers—led by a man Swilling and others had publicly accused—were identified only after Swilling's death. ===Yuma Pioneer Cemetery=== According to the written documents provided by Swillings' wife, Trinidad Swilling, her husband was released to their friends, the Hodges family, who resided in Yuma. She also stated that Swilling died in the Hodges family house. The Hodges family owned two lots in the Yuma Pioneer Cemetery behind the old Catholic Church, and Swilling was buried in one of lots before his family could be notified. A headstone once marked his grave, however for some unknown reason the headstone is no longer there.Jack Swilling's grave After his death, Swilling's reputation as a badman grew so fast that by the end of the 19th century a prominent Arizona historian described him as a \\"typical desperado.\\" By many accounts he was a joker and yarn spinner and while drinking he spread tall tales about his exploits to all who would listen. Friends remembered Jack Swilling as an honest, hard-working, and generous man always ready to help those in need of a meal or a place to sleep. He was known to put his own life at risk for others, literally riding to the rescue when help was needed in the face of an Apache attack. On Thursday afternoon, February 19, 1931, the Maricopa Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, in a simple ceremony with the presence of Arizona Governor George W. P. Hunt, unveiled and dedicated to the memory of Jack and Trinidad Swilling, a fountain which stands in the park directly in front of the courthouse building in Phoenix. The fountain has a small bronze plaque with the following inscription: \\"In memory of Lieut. Jack W. Swilling, 1831-1878, who built the first modern irrigation ditch, and Trinidad, his wife, 1850-1925, who established in 1868 the first pioneer home in the Salt River Valley.\\" ==See also== *Phoenix, Arizona *List of historic properties in Black Canyon City, Arizona ==References== ==Further reading== *Bates, Albert R.

It is part of the Tlacolula District in the east of the Valles Centrales Region. The town is also known for its handcrafted textiles, especially embroidered pieces and mezcal. The town also contains a museum which was closed without explanation in 1995, since when its entire collection of Zapotec and Mixtec cultural items has disappeared. The name “San Pablo” is in honor of Saint Paul, and “Mitla” is a hispanization of the Nahuatl name “Mictlán.” This is the name the Aztecs gave the old pre-Hispanic city before the Spanish arrived and means “land of the dead.” It is located in the Central Valleys regions of Oaxaca, 46 km from the city of Oaxaca, in the District of Tlacolula. ==Town== The town and municipal seat of Mitla is the commercial and tourism center for the area. Many of the houses in the modern town of Mitla are about 200 years old, in a rustic colonial style. In many of these houses are weaving and embroidery workshops which sell to the public. The town has a cultural center or “Casa de Cultura,” which offers classes such as those in traditional dance. There is a small open-air Handcrafts Market just outside the archeological zone. Most of crafts made and sold here are textiles, including hand-woven and hand- embroidered traditional clothing, hammocks, sarapes, rugs, handbags, tablecloths and other items. Necklaces and bracelets are braided from fibers and decorated with beads, seeds, small stones and/or ceramic figures. Many of the designs found on the textiles here come from pre-Hispanic codices and based on Zapotec mythological figures, but more moderns images such as those from modern Mexican painters can be found as well. The town has two churches, one dedicated to Saint John the Apostle and the other dedicated to Saint Paul. When the Spanish arrived in the 1520s, nothing rivaled pre-Hispanic Mitla as a religious center in the Oaxaca Valley. In 1544, the church of San Pablo was established on part of the ruins of the old Zapotec religious complex. The church sits on a pre-Hispanic platform which now functions as the atrium. Access to the church is through a portal decorated with pyramid-shaped crests and a niche. The church is 39 meters long and twelve wide, with three naves enclosed by lanterned octagonal domes. The vaults were constructed later, perhaps in the 19th century. The squared apse is closed with a circular dome and cupola is not as high as the nave and is likely from the 16th century. Behind it is a larger octagonal dome that encloses the sanctuary, with one other dome enclosing the choir. The wall of the south atrium was originally part of a pre-Hispanic structure and still contains the mosaic fretwork which defines the Zapotec site. The interior of the church is notable for a large number of 16th-century and other colonial-era santos (statues of the saints), many of them done in well-preserved polychrome.Santos in Oaxaca's Ancient Churches: San Pablo Mitla . Retrieved 2012-04-13. The patron saint of the town, Saint Paul, is celebrated in January with a procession that begins at the Church of San Pablo in the archeological site, passes through the town cemetery and ends at the town center. Drinks of mezcal are offered free to attendees. Most of the population participates in the procession as well as musical groups, and fantasy figures such as giant monkeys are made for the occasion. Part of the facade of the Frissell Museum building with sign stating that is it undergoing remodeling. On Benito Juarez Street in very near the Plaza Central is the Frissell Museum building. It was an inn named La Sorpresa, that operated mostly in the latter 19th century and early 20th by the Quero family. In the 1950s, the building was sold to American Edwin Robert Frissell. Frissell collected a large number of archeological pieces with which the museum was founded. The museum’s collection was enhanced with donations by Howard Leigh, who collected Zapotec art, and moved his collection here from the city of Oaxaca. The museum was inaugurated in 1950 and was sponsored by a civil association called the Junta Cultural Zapoteca de Mitla. The museum had various rooms in which the pieces were displayed to show the evolution of Zapotec and Mixtec art. Pieces included ceramics such as urns, jars, braziers and mortars, those made of jade and obsidian, a large number of idols, axes and other pieces. The museum's collection is estimated at between 40,000 and 80,000 pieces, and it was known as having the largest collection of Zapotec cultural items. The museum was closed without explanation in 1995 and from then until 2001, no one had any idea what was happening. From 2001 Rufino Aguilar Quero and attorneys investigated, and found contracts that specified the conditions of the donations of the pieces by Frissell to UDLA. Frissell stipulated that upon his death, the Mexico City College (today UDLA) would have control of the collection and could not cede it to another institution. Another stipulation was that none of the pieces could be separated from the collection. A local newspaper reported that the museum building had been sold to José Murat Casab for 1.5 million pesos, against Frissell’s stipulation that the pieces and the building remain together. Sometime between 1995 and 2007, the museum's entire collection disappeared, along with paintings by León Zurita, the visitor log and a stamp collection. In early 2007, Samuel Quero Martínez, Rufino Aguilar Quero and Robert Luís Arreola, residents of Mitla, denounced the sacking of the museum and sale of its pieces, with the government of Oaxaca being suspected of having a role in the affair. Formal charges were filed in 2008. The dean of UDLA has denied the charges, and denies that the pieces were in the school's responsibility when they were found to be missing, but rather the property of INAH as \\"property of the nation\\". The dean claims that the university is not fit to manage such a museum and handed over the management of it to INAH. He also denies selling the building to José Murat Casab, but did make it available to the government of the state of Oaxaca with the possibility of sale. The museum remains closed, supposedly for remodeling. Discussions about the fate of the museum and its collection resurfaced in June 2009, when a group of Mitla residents petitioned INAH for the return of at least thirty percent of the museum's collection. Meanwhile, the formal investigation is ongoing, as the site is being used as a restaurant and inn. ==Mitla archeological site== View of the Palace with intricate fretwork The main attraction is the ruins of the pre- Hispanic city of Mitla, which is best known for its buildings decorated with mosaics of small flat stones that fit together to create designs, especially fretwork. The Mitla is the second most visited archeological zone in the state of Oaxaca. Most of the town's economy is based on tourism to the site, being filled with restaurants, small hotels and shops selling handcrafts and mezcal. However, many residents here feel that the area is not promoted sufficiently by the government. Government sources say that the number of visitors coming to the site is increasing. Most visitors are Mexican nationals who come during the weekends from the neighboring states of Puebla and Veracruz. Most foreign visitors are from Europe. Approximately 500 people a day come to Mitla to visit. ==Municipality== Municipal Palace As municipal seat, the town of San Pablo Villa de Mitla has governing jurisdiction over the communities of San José del Paso, San Miguel Albarradas, Unión Zapata (Loma Larga), Xaagá, Santa María Albarradas, Don Pedrillo, El Tequio and El Rosario, which cover a territory of 82.93km2. The total population of the municipality as of 2005 is 11,219 people, of which 7,829 or about 70% live in the town proper. 3,655 or about a third of the population speaks an indigenous language. The municipality borders the municipalities of Santo Domingo Albarradas, Villa Díaz Ordaz, Tlacolula de Matamoros, San Lorenzo Albarradas and Santo Domingo Albarradas. Most of the territory is made up of rolling hills at the foot of the Sierra del Norte. The most notable elevation is the mountain called Dan Guido or Hill of the Temple. Another elevation is called Dan Belgo or Jar Hill. The only major river to cross here is the Grande River with a number of small streams that feed into it, many of which flow only during the rainy season. The climate is temperate and fairly dry. The rainy season is from June to September and in the winter it freezes regularly. The higher elevations have pine forests, with plants such as mesquite, maguey and nopal cactus at the lower, drier areas. The forested areas have small to medium-sized mammals such as wolves, coyotes, deer, wild boar, foxes etc. as well as birds and some poisonous snakes. About twenty percent of the population is dedicated to agriculture, with 80% working at crafts and/or tourism-related activities. Handcrafts, especially embroidered cloths and woven wool items are an important source of income. These include traditional clothing made on hand- operated looms, as well as hammocks, sarapes, rugs, tablecloths and other items. Many of these items are also embroidered. Jewelry made from natural materials is also available. The municipalities has some quarries for pink “cantera” stone used for building. To the south of the municipal seat is the Hacianda de Xaga, in which is a cross-shaped tomb decorated with fretwork and conserved its original painting. Another tomb was found at a hill called Guirui as well as the remains of a pre-Hispanic fortification. At a nearby hill called La Forteleza, anthropologists have found 21 skeletons of men, women and children that date back to 500 C.E. Jars, pottery pieces and a jaguar carved in stone have been found as well as corncobs. Excavation of the site was done by Gary Feinman and Linda Nocholas of the Field Museum of Chicago, who consider it one of the most important recent finds of this area. There is primitive camping available at a small lake located behind a hill that is behind the archeological site; however, a local guide and good camping gear is strongly recommended. Traditional music here is played by bands of wind instruments and marimbas. The chirimía, a reed instrument of Hispanic origin, can also be heard.Charles McNett, \\"The Chirimia: A Latin American Shawm,\\" The Galpin Society Journal 13 (1960): 44-51 The region’s cuisine is based on moles such as negro, verde, amarillo and Colorado. Another popular dish is liver with eggs. Local drinks include hot chocolate made with water instead of milk, corn atole, atole with panela cheese or chocolate, “tejate”, pozole (a fermented corn/cacao drink), a drink made from a fruit called cilacayota and tepache. Mezcal is an important distilled drink here bottled both straight and flavored with additives. The flavored mescals are called “cremas” (crèmes) and come in flavors such as orange, coconut, coffee, lime and others. In Mitla and the surrounding towns are \\"palenques\\", small producers of mezcal where they produce the drink by hand from the heart of the agave plant. 5 km from Mitla is a small village called Matatlán, which, due to the number of palenques, is called the \\"mezcal capital of the world\\". Day of the Dead is an important celebration here as the area has a history of being a place related to rest and the underworld. Ofrendas, or altars, are set up in homes for deceased loved ones. Celebrations begin at midday on 31 October with church bells ringing to receive first the visiting deceased children. On 1 November, families visit graves to clean, decorate and place offerings on family tombs. Fireworks are set off to help the deceased find their way to their former homes. From midday 1 November to midday 2 November, it is believed that the dead are among the living enjoying the food and drinks left on the ofrendas or altars. This activity is known here as “togolear” from the Zapotec word “togool” which means “dead.” On 3 November, a costume party is held in the central park of Mitla. Costumed attendees compete for cash prizes in categories such as originality. On the night of the 3rd, “krewes,” like those that put on events for Carnival, recreate traditional activities, such as weddings, while costumed as skeletons. On 4 November, paintings that have been on display since the 30th of October and judged and awarded prizes. ==Notable people== Restaurateur and author Bricia Lopez was born in San Pablo Villa de Mitla. ==References== Category:Municipalities of Oaxaca ","title":"San Pablo Villa de Mitla"},{"id":"1442482","text":"The Principate is the name sometimes given to the first period of the Roman Empire from the beginning of the reign of Augustus in 27 BC to the end of the Crisis of the Third Century in 284 AD, after which it evolved into the so- called Dominate.K Lowenstein, The Governance of Rome (1973) p. 370 The Principate is characterised by the reign of a single emperor (princeps) and an effort on the part of the early emperors, at least, to preserve the illusion of the formal continuance, in some aspects, of the Roman Republic.A history of Rome, M. Cary & H.H. Scullard, SPQR; Mary Beard, == Etymology and anticipations== *'Principate' is etymologically derived from the Latin word princeps, meaning chief or first, and therefore represents the political regime dominated by such a political leader, whether or not he is formally head of state and/or head of government. This reflects the principate emperors' assertion that they were merely \\"first among equals\\" among the citizens of Rome. *Under the Republic, the princeps senatus, traditionally the oldest or most honoured member of the Senate, had the right to be heard first on any debate.O Seyffeert, A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (London 1891) p. 516 *Scipio Aemilianus and his circle had fostered the (quasi-Platonic) idea that authority should be invested in the worthiest citizen (princeps), who would beneficently guide his compeers, an ideal of the patriot statesman later taken up by Cicero.H J Rose, A Handbook of Latin Literature (Methuen 1967) p. 99 and p. 235 ==Duration== In a more limited and precise chronological sense, the term Principate is applied either to the entire Empire (in the sense of the post-Republican Roman state), or specifically to the earlier of the two phases of \\"Imperial\\" government in the ancient Roman Empire before Rome's military collapse in the West (fall of Rome) in 476 left the Byzantine Empire as sole heir. This early, 'Principate' phase began when Augustus claimed auctoritas for himself as princeps; and continued (depending on the source) up to the rule of Commodus, of Maximinus Thrax or of Diocletian. Afterwards, Imperial rule in the Empire is designated as the dominate, which is subjectively more like an (absolute) monarchy while the earlier Principate is still more 'Republican'. ==History== The title, in full, of princeps senatus / princeps civitatis (\\"first amongst the senators\\" / \\"first amongst the citizens\\") was first adopted by Octavian Caesar Augustus (27 BC–AD 14), the first Roman \\"emperor\\" who chose, like the assassinated Julius Caesar, not to reintroduce a legal monarchy. Augustus's purpose was probably to establish the political stability desperately needed after the exhausting civil wars by a de facto dictatorial regime within the constitutional framework of the Roman Republic - what Gibbon called \\"an absolute monarchy disguised by the forms of a commonwealth\\"D Wormersley ed, Abridged Decline and Fall (Penguin 2005) p. 73 \\\\- as a more acceptable alternative to, for example, the early Roman Kingdom. Although dynastic pretences crept in from the start, formalizing this in a monarchic style remained politically perilous;J Burrow, A History of Histories (Penguin 2007) p. 124-5 and Octavian was undoubtedly correct to work through established Republican forms to consolidate his power.J Boardman ed. The Oxford History of the Classical World (1991) p. 538 He began with the powers of a Roman consul, combined with those of a Tribune of the plebs; later added the role of the censor; and finally became Pontifex Maximus as well.D Wormersley ed, Abridged Decline and Fall (Penguin 2005) p. 70-1 Tiberius too acquired his powers piecemeal, and was proud to emphasise his place as first citizen: \\"a good and healthful princeps, whom you have invested with such great discretionary power, ought to be the servant of the Senate, and often of the whole citizen body\\".Quoted in J Boardman ed. The Oxford History of the Classical World (1991) p. 540 Thereafter however the role of princeps became more institutionalised: as Dio Cassius put it, Caligula was \\"voted in a single day all the prerogatives which Augustus over so long a span of time had been voted gradually and piecemeal\\".J Boardman ed. The Oxford History of the Classical World (1991) p. 549 Nevertheless, under this \\"Principate stricto sensu\\", the political reality of autocratic rule by the Emperor was still scrupulously masked by forms and conventions of oligarchic self-rule inherited from the political period of the 'uncrowned' Roman Republic (509 BC–27 BC) under the motto Senatus Populusque Romanus (\\"The Senate and people of Rome\\") or SPQR. Initially, the theory implied the 'first citizen' had to earn his extraordinary position (de facto evolving to nearly absolute monarchy) by merit in the style that Augustus himself had gained the position of auctoritas. Imperial propaganda developed a paternalistic ideology, presenting the princeps as the very incarnation of all virtues attributed to the ideal ruler (much like a Greek tyrannos earlier), such as clemency and justice, and military leadership,C Edwards Intro, Lives of the Caesars (OUP 2000) p. xxi in turn placing the onus on the princeps to play this designated role within Roman society, as his political insurance as well as a moral duty. What specifically was expected of the princeps seems to have varied according to the times, and the observers:C Edwards Intro, Lives of the Caesars (OUP 2000) p. xxiii-v Tiberius, who amassed a huge surplus for the city of Rome, was criticized as a miser, but Caligula was criticized for his lavish spending on games and spectacles. Generally speaking, it was expected of the Emperor to be generous but not frivolous, not just as a good ruler but also with his personal fortune (as in the proverbial \\"bread and circuses\\" – panem et circenses) providing occasional public games, gladiators, horse races and artistic shows. Large distributions of food for the public and charitable institutions were also means that served as popularity boosters while the construction of public works provided paid employment for the poor. Principate under AugustusDigital Reproduction of diagram found in The Anchor Atlas of World History, Vol. 1 (From the Stone Age to the Eve of the French Revolution) Paperback – December 17, 1974 by Werner Hilgemann, Hermann Kinder, Ernest A. Menze (Translator), Harald Bukor (Cartographer), Ruth Bukor (Cartographer) === Redefinition under Vespasian === With the fall of the Julio-Claudian dynasty in AD 68, the principate became more formalised under the Emperor Vespasian from AD 69 onwards.J Boardman ed, The Oxford History of the Classical World (1991) p. 561 The position of princeps became a distinct entity within the broader – formally still republican – Roman constitution. While many of the same cultural and political expectations remained, the civilian aspect of the Augustan ideal of the princeps gradually gave way to the military role of the imperator.J Boardman ed, The Oxford History of the Classical World (1991) p. 561 and p. 573 Rule was no longer a position (even notionally) extended on the basis of merit, or auctoritas, but on a firmer basis, allowing Vespasian and future emperors to designate their own heir without those heirs having to earn the position through years of success and public favor. Under the Antonine dynasty, it was the norm for the Emperor to appoint a successful and politically promising individual as his successor. In modern historical analysis, this is treated by many authors as an \\"ideal\\" situation: the individual who was most capable was promoted to the position of princeps. Of the Antonine dynasty, Edward Gibbon famously wrote that this was the happiest and most productive period in human history, and credited the system of succession as the key factor. === Dominate === The autocratic elements in the Principate tended to increase over time, with the style of dominus (\\"Lord\\", \\"Master\\", suggesting the citizens became servi, servants or slaves) gradually becoming current for the emperor.H M Gwatkin ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol I (1924) p. 25 There was however no clear constitutional turning point, with Septimius Severus and the Severan dynasty beginning to use the terminology of the Dominate in reference to the emperor, and the various emperors and their usurpers throughout the 3rd century appealing to the people as both military dominus and political princeps. It was after the Crisis of the Third Century almost resulted in the Roman Empire's political collapse that Diocletian firmly consolidated the trend to autocracy.H M Gwatkin ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol I (1924) p. 25 He replaced the one-headed principate with the tetrarchy (c. AD 300, two Augusti ranking above two Caesares),H M Gwatkin ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol I (1924) p. 27 in which the vestigial pretence of the old Republican forms was largely abandoned. The title of princeps disappeared – like the territorial unity of the Empire – in favor of dominus; and new forms of pomp and awe, along the lines of an oriental absolute monarchy, were deliberately used in an attempt to insulate the emperor and the civil authority from the unbridled and mutinous soldiery of the mid-century.H M Gwatkin ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol I (1924) p. 25 The political role of the Senate went into final eclipse,J Boardman ed. The Oxford History of the Classical World (1991) p. 808 no more being heard of the division by the Augustan Principate of the provinces between imperial (militarised) provinces and senatorial provinces.H M Gwatkin ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol I (1924) p. 29 Lawyers developed a theory of the total delegation of authority into the hands of the emperor;H M Gwatkin ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol I (1924) p. 28 and the dominate developed more and more, especially in the Eastern Roman Empire, where the subjects, and even diplomatic allies, could be termed servus or the corresponding Greek term doulos, (\\"servant/slave\\") so as to express the exalted position of the Emperor as second only to God, and on earth to none. ==See also== *Constitution of the Late Roman Empire ==References== ==Sources== * Alston, Richard. 1998.

Wilson was born in Cleveland, Ohio, where he was at a young age drawn to the concerts of George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra. In 1963, Wilson graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard University, where he studied with Robert Moevs and Randall Thompson. He later received an MA from Rutgers University. From 1966 to 2016, he taught at Vassar College, where he was Mary Conover Mellon Professor of Music. Since 1992 he has been composer-in-residence with the American Symphony Orchestra. Richard Wilson's compositions are marked by a stringent yet lyrical atonality which often sets him apart from the established schools of modern American music: minimalism, twelve-tone, neo- romanticism, and avant-garde. Two of his works, Eclogue for solo piano, and his String Quartet No. 3, are considered high points of twentieth-century American music. His large-scale orchestral works include the Symphony No. 1, premiered by the Hudson Valley Philharmonic and recorded by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra; Articulations, written for the San Francisco Symphony. Wilson is also the composer of the one-act whimsical opera, Æthelred the Unready, based on the exploits of the ill-advised Saxon king, Æthelred II of England. He classified the three types of irregular resolutions of dominant seventh chords. ==Critical response== Wilson has been praised by 21st Century Music as a \\"splendidly talented and highly accomplished composer whose music rewards seeking out\\" and by the New York Sun as \\"possessed of a hard-won idiom that has grown and developed over the years into a probing blend of wit, classic form, modern harmony, and impressionistic color.\\" Writing in the New Yorker, Andrew Porter called his String Quartet No. 3 a \\"richly wrought and unusual composition,\\" while the New York Times has deemed it \\"a work of substance and expressivity ... [that] merits a place in the active repertory.\\" In a review of a recent concert, the New York Times wrote, \\"Richard Wilson's Diablerie stood apart, contemporary in its vocabulary and grammar but pursuing always the long, lyrical, sometimes operatically expressive lines and Romantic-era concerto writing.\\" A review in Strings Magazine heralded the same composition as \\"another gem in Wilson's mélange of solo pieces.\\" ==Honors== In 2004 Wilson received an Academy Award in Music from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, from which he previously received the Walter Hinrichsen Award. Other recent honors include: the Stoeger Prize from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center; a Guggenheim Fellowship; the Cleveland Arts Prize; residencies at the Bogliasco Foundation and the Bellagio Center in Italy; and commissions from the Koussevitsky and Fromm Foundations, Chamber Music America, the Chicago Chamber Musicians, the Walter W.

Finuge is a traditional Irish crossroads village with a shop, a pub, Teach Siamsa and a G.A.A. pitch. Sheehan's Thatched House located at Finuge Cross is regarded as one of the oldest surviving authentic thatched houses in Ireland. Conservation experts estimate it at least 300 years old. The village's name is derived from Préachán, meaning crow. ==History== Around 1660, Finuge was planted by the Desmond Geraldines during the Cromwellian Plantation. At that time, Finuge village was situated near the bank of the River Feale. The land here was of excellent quality, so much so that the families were evicted and pushed south-east and re-located beside the \\"new road\\" that links Listowel and Lixnaw today. About the time of the \\"Fenian Rising\\", Lord Listowel decided that he wanted this land and his agent Major Homes planned to shift the whole village and evict the locals further south- east to the northwest of the townland of Irremore. The house plots were marked out and the eviction about to take place, when the Agent Holmes died unexpectedly and the village as we know it today was saved. There were three churches in Finuge at one time. In 1825 a new church was built at Irremore, it was renovated in 1961 and serves the people to the present day. The big house in the district was \\"Ennismore House\\", it became the property of the Desmond Geraldines as a result of the Cromwellian Plantation. In later times George Hewson inherited it from the last of the Fitzgeralds. \\"Finuge House\\", the ruins of which can be seen beside Finuge Bridge was owned by another Hewson family, not related to George. This family were always associated with \\"Harvest Home\\", an annual celebration at the end the harvest. The last record of such a gathering was Oct. 25th 1877, when sixty men and women sat down to dinner. Ringforts were features of the parish, with excellent examples on the farms of Quinlans and McElligotts of Coolnaleen, Galvin's and Whelan's of Finuge, but sad to relate these no longer exist. In olden times, Finuge was not just a townland, it was a parish that stretched form Dysert to Ballinruddery. There were several townlands in the parish of Finuge including Bealkilla, Kilcrean, Knockamoohane and Ballinruddery, Garryantanavalla, Ballygrennan, Moyassa, Knockanassig, Grogeen. There are no remains of a church today, but there is a large burial ground. ==Geography== The village is located on the banks of the River Feale, 2 miles (3 km) from Listowel. The Finuge crossing is a bridge over the River Feale linking Finuge to Killocrim. It is in the Barony of Clanmaurice. ==Sport== The GAA club in the area is known as Finuge GAA or Finuge and has had a lot of success for its size. Current players include Paul Galvin. ==People== * Sean McCarthy, a Finuge native, was an Irish folk songwriter. * Paul Galvin is a Gaelic footballer with the Finuge club, Feale Rangers divisional side and Kerry county team. ==See also== * List of towns and villages in Ireland ==External links== * The Barony of Finuge Category:Towns and villages in County Kerry ","title":"Finuge"},{"id":"1442505","text":"In mathematics, the complex conjugate of a complex vector space V\\\\, is a complex vector space \\\\overline V, which has the same elements and additive group structure as V, but whose scalar multiplication involves conjugation of the scalars. In other words, the scalar multiplication of \\\\overline V satisfies :\\\\alpha\\\\,*\\\\, v = {\\\\,\\\\overline \\\\alpha \\\\cdot \\\\,v\\\\,} where * is the scalar multiplication of \\\\overline V and \\\\cdot is the scalar multiplication of V. The letter v\\\\, stands for a vector in V\\\\,, \\\\alpha\\\\, is a complex number, and \\\\overline\\\\alpha denotes the complex conjugate of \\\\alpha\\\\,. More concretely, the complex conjugate vector space is the same underlying real vector space (same set of points, same vector addition and real scalar multiplication) with the conjugate linear complex structure J (different multiplication by i). ==Motivation== If V\\\\, and W\\\\, are complex vector spaces, a function f\\\\colon V \\\\to W\\\\, is antilinear if :f(v+v') = f(v) + f(v')\\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad f(\\\\alpha v) = \\\\overline\\\\alpha \\\\, f(v) With the use of the conjugate vector space \\\\overline V, an antilinear map f : V \\\\to W can be regarded as an ordinary linear map of type \\\\overline V \\\\to W. The linearity is checked by noting: : f(\\\\alpha * v) = f(\\\\overline \\\\alpha \\\\cdot v) = \\\\overline{\\\\overline{\\\\alpha}} \\\\cdot f(v) =\\\\alpha \\\\cdot f(v) Conversely, any linear map defined on \\\\overline V gives rise to an antilinear map on V\\\\,. This is the same underlying principle as in defining opposite ring so that a right R-module can be regarded as a left R^{op}-module, or that of an opposite category so that a contravariant functor C \\\\to D can be regarded as an ordinary functor of type C^{op} \\\\to D. ==Complex conjugation functor== A linear map f \\\\colon V \\\\to W\\\\, gives rise to a corresponding linear map \\\\overline f \\\\colon \\\\overline V \\\\to \\\\overline W which has the same action as f. Note that \\\\overline f preserves scalar multiplication because :\\\\overline f (\\\\alpha * v) = f(\\\\overline \\\\alpha \\\\cdot v) = \\\\overline \\\\alpha \\\\cdot f(v) = \\\\alpha * \\\\overline f(v) Thus, complex conjugation V\\\\mapsto \\\\overline V and f\\\\mapsto\\\\overline f define a functor from the category of complex vector spaces to itself. If V\\\\, and W\\\\, are finite-dimensional and the map f\\\\, is described by the complex matrix A\\\\, with respect to the bases \\\\mathcal B of V\\\\, and \\\\mathcal C of W\\\\,, then the map \\\\overline f is described by the complex conjugate of A\\\\, with respect to the bases \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal B} of \\\\overline V and \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal C} of \\\\overline W. ==Structure of the conjugate== The vector spaces V\\\\, and \\\\overline V have the same dimension over the complex numbers and are therefore isomorphic as complex vector spaces. However, there is no natural isomorphism from V\\\\, to \\\\overline V. The double conjugate \\\\overline{\\\\overline V} is identical to V. == Complex conjugate of a Hilbert space == Given a Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H} (either finite or infinite dimensional), its complex conjugate \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{H}} is the same vector space as its continuous dual space \\\\mathcal{H}'. There is one-to-one antilinear correspondence between continuous linear functionals and vectors. In other words, any continuous linear functional on \\\\mathcal{H} is an inner multiplication to some fixed vector, and vice versa. Thus, the complex conjugate to a vector v, particularly in finite dimension case, may be denoted as v^* (v-star, a row vector which is the conjugate transpose to a column vector v). In quantum mechanics, the conjugate to a ket vector \\\\psi\\\\rangle is denoted as \\\\langle\\\\psi – a bra vector (see bra–ket notation). ==See also== * Linear complex structure ==References== ==Further reading== * Budinich, P. and Trautman, A.

It is located 8 km northwest of Listowel on the R553 road to Ballybunion. The village is part of the parish of Ballydonoghue, which is located in the north of the county. The village contains three pubs (Cantillons, Tomáisín's and The Thatch Bar), a church, a supermarket/post office and a butchers. There are about 50 houses in the village itself, and two primary schools in the parish. ==Leisure and sport== Ballyloughran Leisure Centre was operated by Limerick Youth Service but has since closed down. It contained a gym, pool, and other facilities. Sporting organisations in the parish include Ballydonoghue GAA Club and Lisselton Rovers FC. Lisselton Rovers was previously based in Lisselton and played in the Kerry District League. The club relocated to Ballybunion and renamed themselves LB Rovers in 2012. Ballydonoghue GAA club have their own grounds at Coolard.http://www.ballydonoghuegaa.com/ The club has been represented on the county team on a number of occasions, providing three of the 1947 team that played in the only All Ireland final ever hosted outside of the country, the Kerry-Cavan duel played in the Polo Grounds in New York. ==Grotto== Lisselton Grotto was built in 1954, the Marian Year. It was later refurbished as part of the work carried out by members of the local FÁS scheme. ==Transport== The famous Lartigue Monorail passed through Lisselton from 1888 until 1924. The village now has a taxi and bus service. ==Education== Lisselton National School opened in 1983. The school has approximately 134 students, five class teachers, a learning support teacher, a resource teacher and two special needs assistants. Coolard National School is the second school. Dromerin National School was the third, but it was closed in September 2012 due to dwindling numbers. ==Literarature== Lisselton was the birthplace of Maurice Walsh, whose most famous work was The Quiet Man. John B Keane's family were also from the area and he once remarked that it was a \\"throbbing vein of literary genius\\" running through the locality that made it easier to write than not to write. The Ballydonoghue Parish Magazine was established in the 1980s and each annual edition has articles covering issues of local relevance, including Gaelic games.http://ballydonoghuemagazine.com/ ==See also== * List of towns and villages in Ireland ==References== Category:Towns and villages in County Kerry ","title":"Lisselton"},{"id":"1442507","text":"Phosphoserine (abbreviated as SEP or J) is an ester of serine and phosphoric acid. Phosphoserine is a component of many proteins as the result of posttranslational modifications. The phosphorylation of the alcohol functional group in serine to produce phosphoserine is catalyzed by various types of kinases. Through the use of technologies that utilize an expanded genetic code, phosphoserine can also be incorporated into proteins during translation. It is a normal metabolite found in human biofluids. Phosphoserine has three potential coordination sites (carboxyl, amine and phosphate group) Determination of the mode of coordination between phosphorylated ligands and metal ions occurring in an organism is a first step to explain the function of the phosphoserine in bioinorganic processes. ==References== Category:Amino acids Category:Organophosphates ","title":"Phosphoserine"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},R={class:"card-container"};function H(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",R,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const x=d(B,[["render",H]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/4.md","filePath":"guide/4.md"}'),E={name:"guide/4.md"},L=Object.assign(E,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{W as __pageData,L as default};
