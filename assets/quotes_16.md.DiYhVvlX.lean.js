Following numerous robberies, kidnappings, murders, and many years as a fugitive, he is currently serving four consecutive life sentences with an additional 295 years in prison, but with permission to work outside during the day. This enables him to go to work every morning in a workshop in the periphery of Milan, making bags from recycled material. He is a local celebrity in Milan, famous for appealing to part of public opinion for his image linked to the \\"myth of the bandit\\"http://www.adnkronos.com/fatti/cronaca/2014/06/14/parabola-del-bel- rene-della-comasina-ladro-supermercato_c7w3aJ6M3eaXw6tou6jJUJ.html. == Biography  Early life === Vallanzasca was born in Milan, in the Lambrate district where his mother owned a clothing store. He was given the surname of his mother because his biological father, Osvaldo Pistoia, was already married to another woman by whom he had three children. Vallanzasca became involved in vandalism and petty criminal activities early in his childhood. His first arrest occurred at the age of eight for having tried to let a tiger out of its cage, which belonged to a circus that had tented near his house. He was apprehended the following day and taken to Cesare Beccaria detention home. Because of this act he was legally compelled to move into an aunt's house, in via degli Apuli, in the district of Giambellino, in the southern periphery of Milan, practically on the opposite side of the city. === Banda della Comasina === It was during this time that he formed his own gang of children involved in stealing and shoplifting. In spite of his young age, Vallanzasca was already a gang leader and began to make a name for himself in the ligera, the old Milanese underworld, with whose members he quickly began to cooperate. But shortly thereafter, resenting the rules and the \\"code\\" of the old criminal underworld, he decided to form his own criminal outfit called the Banda della Comasina, which soon grew to become the most powerful and ferocious gang in Milan during those years. The Banda della Comasina was a strong rival and enemy to the gang which was headed by Francis Turatello. Renato Vallanzasca in his youth. c. 1970's Within a short period, Vallanzasca accumulated a lot of money due to the numerous robberies and thefts carried out by his gang, and began to live an extravagant lifestyle: he took to wearing expensive designer clothes, driving luxury cars and would usually be seen in the company of beautiful women. His looks earned him the nickname \\"Il bel Renè\\" (the handsome/pretty Renè), a nickname he detested. === First arrest and escape === His smooth and successful criminal career was interrupted for the first time in 1972 when, 10 days after the robbery of a supermarket, he was arrested by men belonging to the squadra mobile (flying squad) headed by Achille Serra. Serra later claimed that during the search of his house, Vallanzasca unstrung his gold Rolex wrist watch and put it on a table, telling him, \\"If you succeed in tying this to me, it is yours\\". A few minutes later, warrant officer Oscuri found some shreds of paper in the dustbin, which, once put together, showed a list of salaries of the employees in the supermarket previously robbed. In 1973, his girlfriend Ripalta Pioggia, gave birth to their son, Massimiliano Domenico. As a result, Vallanzasca was convicted and sent to the San Vittore penitentiary. During the four and a half years of imprisonment, he unsuccessfully attempted to escape from the prison more than once. He was also involved in numerous fights and beatings, and was also an active participant in the various prison riots which erupted in the local prison environment during this period. These factors caused him to be transferred to 36 different prisons within a four and a half year period. Eventually, he found a way of escaping by voluntarily contracting Hepatitis. He did this by ingesting rotten eggs, injecting urine intravenously into his blood stream and inhaling propane gas. He was then transferred to the hospital, where he managed to escape with the help of a complacent policeman.Cristiano Armati, Italia criminale. Personaggi, fatti e avvenimenti di un'Italia violenta, Newton Compton Editori, 2006, p. 238 - === Life as fugitive === After his escape, on 25 July 1976, Vallanzasca was free again. He still wanted money in the shortest time because he wanted to spend time with his girlfriend Ripalta and his son, Massimiliano; he spent about a month with them between Sorrento and Cilento before returning to hiding in Milan. After leaving his son and girlfriend, Vallanzasca reassembled his old gang and began a series of new robberies, which totaled seventy. These robberies caused several deaths, including those of four policemen, a doctor and a bank employee. He also committed four kidnappings for ransom, two of which were never reported to the police. One of the gang's victims was Emanuela Trapani, the daughter of a local Milanese entrepreneur who was held captive for over a month and a half, from December 1976 to January 1977, and then released upon the payment of a ransom of one billion in Italian currency. This incident coupled with the killing on 6 February 1977 of two highway patrolmen near Dalmine, Luigi D'Andrea and Renato Barborinihttp://bergamo.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/17_febbraio_06/volevano- rapire-imprenditore-uccisero-due-poliziotti-40-anni-fa-vittime-vallanzasca- dalmine-4efeffdc-ec56-11e6-b0dc-72bd53481b5d.shtml, who had stopped the car on which he was travelling to evade capture, caused him to flee Milan for Rome. There he was again recaptured, on 15 February 1977 while still just 26 years old. === Return to prison === Vallanzasca (right) with fellow Milanese mobster, Francis Turatello (left), during his wedding in prison (1979) After his return to prison, in 1979 Vallanzasca married his new girlfriend, Giuliana Brusa. His former enemy, Milanese crime boss Francis Turatello acted as best man, thus sealing a temporary alliance between the two. On 17 August 1981, Turatello was eventually assassinated at the Badu 'e Carros, the high security prison in Nuoro, Sardinia, by a Neapolitan Camorrista Pasquale Barra, along with Vincenzo Andraus and Antonino Faro, two Sicilian Mafiosi from Catania, Sicily. The hit had been probably ordered by Raffaele Cutolo, the boss of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata.Jacquemet, Credibility in Court, pp. 70 On 28 April 1980, Vallanzasca again attempted to escape from the San Vittore Prison in Milan. During time in the open air, a group of prisoners mysteriously produced three guns, and managed to make headway taking a brigadiere (a prison guard staff sergeant), Romano Saccoccio, as hostage. A firefight commenced in the streets of Milan, and followed in the tunnels. A wounded Vallanzasca was arrested together with nine other escapees. === The Novara prison riot === In the Novara prison, in 1981, he helped to set in motion a prison revolt in which some pentiti, or collaborators with Italian Justice lost their lives. Among them was a former member of his gang, Massimo Loi. According to Achille Serra, the young man who was in his early twenties had decided to abandon the path of crime and begin a new life in the legitimate world. However, Vallanzasca armed with a knife and supported by the prison crowd would not allow him to leave the prison unharmed. Loi was cornered inside his prison cell, alone and unarmed. Assisted by others, Vallanzasca repeatedly stabbed him in the chest with a knife, committing further atrocities on his mutilated corpse, finally beheading him. In an interview with L'Espresso on 2 April 2006, Vallanzasca vehemently denied any responsibility for the murder of Loi. However, it is certain that Vallanzasca participated in the revolt at the Novara prison, during which two people were killed, one of which was Massimo Loi. It seems that Vallanzasca, in reality, was distanced from the gruesome episode, because there were others involved, as also they attest to the confessions of those days and dynamics of the revolt. In interviews on the DVD of the Film Angels of Evil, the actor who plays Vallanzasca related how he and Vallanzasca met and he admitted to the killing of Loi. He explained that he had denied it because the young man's mother was still alive but that once she had died he felt he could own up to the murder. === More escape attempts === Renato Vallanzasca being led by the police after his arrest in 1977 Sentenced to a harsh prison term, Vallanzasca succeeded in tricking the police officers and managed to escape on 18 July 1987 through a porthole of the ferry which carried him to Asinara, Sardinia. He was stopped at a traffic control post less than three weeks after, while he was trying to reach Trieste. After returning to prison, Vallanzasca again tried escaping from prison in 1995, this time from the Nuoro prison. In this escape attempt, he was accused and suspected of having been aided by his lawyer, with whom he had close links. His father, Osvaldo Pistoia, died on 10 January the following year, aged 95. === Present life === The monument to the memory of the two policemen killed on 6 February 1977 at the Dalmine tollbooth, Luigi D'Andrea and Renato Barborini Since 1999, Vallanzasca has been incarcerated in a maximum security prison in the town of Voghera. After his arrest, Vallanzasca designated his god-son George Samniashvili as a ringleader of his gang. George nowadays lives in Georgia and leads his band from Tbilisi. He visits Vallanzasca frequently in prison to get his advice. How it seems George Samniashvili (FERRE) was the only person Renato could have faith in. In the beginning of May 2005, after having received a special three-hour permit to meet his elderly mother, he formalized a request for clemency by sending a letter to the Ministry of Justice, and to the magistrate of surveillance of Pavia. On 15 July 2007 his mother wrote to the Italian president Giorgio Napolitano and the minister of Justice, Clemente Mastella, requesting clemency for her son. On 15 September 2007, Vallanzasca was notified by the Presidency of the Republic that all requests for clemency had been refused. He then continued serving his sentence at the Opera prison in Milan. On 8 May 2008, he married his childhood friend, Antonella D'Agostino. The marriage was formalised with a civil ceremony on 5 May 2008. Beginning in March 2010, Vallanzasca was given a permit to exit prison in the daytime to participate in work activities. He leaves his cell every day at 7:30 and returns at 19:00. His mother died on 8 February 2011, aged 94. On 13 June 2014, during the semi-courtship granted by the prison of Bollate, he attempted to unpack a supermarket in Milan (he wanted to take underwear and gardening material) and was arrested by the carabinieri for the crime of aggravated improper robbery. The following 14 November he was sentenced to 10 months in jail plus a 330 euro finehttp://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/07/30/news/vallanzasca-120110719/. With this new conviction Vallanzasca risks the loss of the benefits during detention. In his \\"criminal career\\" he collected in total four life sentences and 295 years of imprisonment.http://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/14_giugno_14/arrestato- renato-vallanzasca-rubava- supermercato-e0045ae2-f391-11e3-9746-4bf51e9b4d98.shtml == In popular culture == * In 1977, he released a film entitled La Banda Vallanzasca which was directed by Mario Bianchi. * In 2005, Vallanzasca was also presented a play which was based on his life, entitled \\"Settanta Vallanzasca\\" by Domenico Ferrari and Alessandro Pozzetti. * The beautiful René inspired the name of an Italian Ska group, Vallanzaska. * In 2007, the life story of Renato Vallanzasca was told for the first time on television in a documentary realized for the TV show \\"La Storia siamo noi\\" (History is us) at Rai Edu. * The film Vallanzasca - Gli angeli del male has been released by director Michele Placido in 2010.

As a result the bulk of the army is required to be stationed in the West Bank for the purpose of protecting Jewish settlers, he concluded. According to Rabin, in order to protect 450 Jewish settlers in Hebron, which has a Palestinian population of 100,000, there was a need for three Israeli army battalions to be there at all times.' and settlers are currently reported to be trying to purchase more homes in the city.

The H1 sector, home to around 120,000 Palestinians, came under the control of the Palestinian Authority, in accordance with Hebron Protocol, shortly afterwards, Israeli and Palestinian joint units began patrolling the sensitive parts of the city.UN Doc Chronological review of Events January 1997 H2, which was inhabited by around 37,000 Palestinians , remained under Israeli military control in order to protect some 600 Jewish residents living in the old Jewish quarter, now an enclave near the center of the town. Renovation work that was being carried out on Palestinian homes prior to the Hebron agreement was halted on Israeli military orders. During the years since the outbreak of the Second Intifada, the Palestinian population in H2 has decreased greatly, the drop in large part having been identified with extended curfews and movement restrictions placed on Palestinian residents of the sector by the IDF for security needs, including the closing of Palestinian shops in certain areas. Settler harassment of their Palestinian neighbours in H2 was a reason for several dozen Palestinian families to depart the areas adjacent to the Israeli population. \\"In total, 169 families lived on the three streets in September 2000, when the intifada began. Since then, seventy-three families—forty-three percent—have left their homes.\\" The Hebron Jewish community has been subject to attacks by Palestinian militants since the Oslo agreement, especially during the periods of the Intifadas; which saw 3 fatal stabbings and 9 fatal shootings in between the first and second Intifada (0.9% of all fatalities in Israel and the West Bank) and 17 fatal shooting (9 soldiers and 8 settlers) and 2 fatalities from a bombing during the second Intifada. and thousands of rounds fired on it from the hills above the Abu-Sneina and Harat al-Sheikh neighbourhoods. According to Human Rights Watch in 2001, Palestinian areas of Hebron were frequently subject to indiscriminate firing by the IDF, leading to civilian casualties. An international civilian observer force, the TIPH was subsequently re- established on 14 May 1996 to help the normalization of the situation and to maintain a buffer between the Palestinian Arab population of the city and the Jews residing in their enclave in the old city during the handing over period to the Palestinian Authority.UN Doc Chronological Review of Events May 1996UN Docs Chronological Review of Events January 1997 The Palestinian Authority and Israel invited Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey to join the 30-member unarmed Norwegian contingent of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) force already stationed in Hebron. On February 8, 2006, TIPH temporarily left Hebron after attacks on their headquarters by some Palestinians angered by the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. TIPH came back to Hebron a few months later. The city of Hebron has been a major friction point, with Palestinians and Israeli human rights groups accusing the hard-line religious settlers of attacking the Palestinian population with impunity. According to Human Rights Watch, Hebron commander Noam Tivon stated: > Let there be no mistake about it. I am not from the UN. I am from the > Israeli Defense Force.

The report found that Israel is in regular violation of Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which prohibits the deportation of civilians from occupied territory. The report also found the presence of any Israeli settlement in Hebron to violate international law. ==Rationale for Jewish settlement== The sentiments of Jews who fled the 1929 Hebron massacre and their descendants are mixed. Some advocate the continued settlement of Hebron as a way to continue the Jewish heritage in the city, while others suggest that settlers should try to live in peace with the Arabs there, with some even recommending the complete pullout of all settlers in Hebron.The Jerusalem Post. \\"Field News 10/2/2002 Hebron Jews' offspring divided over city's fate \\", 2006-05-16.

Cuban music from A to Z. (1817 is given as date of birth by Carpentier and Cristóbal Díaz Ayala) – 14 August 1870), was a Cuban composer known for his invention and development of genuinely creolized forms of music.Díaz Ayala, Cristóbal 1981.

Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN. Chapter 10 Saumell and nationalism, p186 was born in Havana. He studied piano with Juan Fédérico Edelmann, and harmony, arranging, counterpoint and fugue with Mauricio Pyke, the director of an Italian opera company which visited Havana. Saumell played the organ in church and interpreted Beethoven for trios, organized musical meetings, made orchestrations and arrangements, and taught classes. \\"Saumell was a truly hard worker, sensitive, generous with others, demanding of himself; he was eager to achieve great things [and] inspired to great projects.\\" Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN. Chapter 10 Saumell and nationalism, p186 At 21 he fell heavily in love with a singer, Dolores de Saint-Maxent, who had introduced Schubert's work to Cuba. Unfortunately for him, she came from a wealthy family who would not countenance their marriage. All the same, for a time she permitted his attentions to continue. Saumell planned a nationalistic opera to show off her talent, based on the novel Antonelli by José Antonio Echevarría. The action takes place in Havana in 1590. A workforce of black slaves sets up the machinery of one of El Cerro's first sugar mills. The engineer Antonelli falls in love with a beautiful Siboney quadroon, only to find she is betrothed to the nephew of the Governor of Havana. And so it proceeds... Alas, before the libretto could be written (in Italian), Delores broke off their relationship, and pursued another man. Shattered, Saumell dropped the project and went back to his scattered life, writing contradanzas and surviving on what little he could make. However, he had done a significant thing: he had planned for aboriginal Indians and black slaves to sing and take part in the action of the opera, something without precedent in all the Americas.Sadie, Stanley (ed). The new Grove dictionary of music and musicians Manuel Saumell, p332. == Works == Leaving aside numbers written in haste for dances, Saumell wrote over fifty contradanzas (in 2/4 or 6/8 time) which merit attention. His rhythmic and melodic inventiveness is astonishing. No two pages are alike, according to Carpentier, he never repeats himself. Contradanzas were composed in two parts, a prima of eight bars followed by the segunda of sixteen bars, or else 16 followed by 16. Saumell used to write a prima in classical style, followed by a segunda in creolized Cuban folkloric style. :\\"Saumell is absolutely prophetic in fixing certain rhythms which would be mined in the future under different names... Saumell is the father not only of the contradanza... but also the habanera (the prima of La Amistad), danzón (La Tedezco), the guajira (segunda of La Matilde), the criolla (the segunda of La Nené), the clavé (La Celestina)... Everything done after him would amplify or distinguish elements plainly exposed in his works.\\" Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN.

Merriam- Webster, 2007. p. 1023 or rˤ; also transliterated rˤw ; cuneiform: ri-a or ri- ia) or Re (; , Rē) is the ancient Egyptian deity of the sun. By the Fifth Dynasty in the 25th and 24th centuries BC, he had become one of the most important gods in ancient Egyptian religion, identified primarily with the noon sun. Ra was believed to rule in all parts of the created world: the sky, the Earth, and the underworld.The Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses, George Hart He was the god of the sun, order, kings, and the sky. Ra was portrayed as a falcon and shared characteristics with the sky god Horus. At times the two deities were merged as Ra-Horakhty, \\"Ra, who is Horus of the Two Horizons\\". In the New Kingdom, when the god Amun rose to prominence he was fused with Ra into Amun-Ra. The cult of the Mnevis bull, an embodiment of Ra, had its center in Heliopolis and there was a formal burial ground for the sacrificed bulls north of the city. All forms of life were believed to have been created by Ra. In some accounts, humans were created from Ra's tears and sweat, hence the Egyptians call themselves the \\"Cattle of Ra\\". In the myth of the Celestial Cow, it is recounted how mankind plotted against Ra and how he sent his eye as the goddess Sekhmet to punish them. == Religious roles  The sun as a creator === The sun is the giver of life, controlling the ripening of crops which were worked by man. Because of the life giving qualities of the sun the Egyptians worshiped the sun as a god. The creator of the universe and the giver of life, the sun or Ra represented life, warmth and growth. Since the people regarded Ra as a principal god, creator of the universe and the source of life, he had a strong influence on them, which led to him being one of the most worshiped of all the Egyptian gods and even considered King of the Gods. At an early period in Egyptian history his influence spread throughout the whole country, bringing multiple representations in form and in name. The most common form combinations are with Atum (his human form), Khepri (the scarab beetle) and Horus (the falcon). The form in which he usually appears is that of a man with a falcon head, which is due to his combination with Horus, another sky god. On top of his head sits a solar disc with a cobra, which in many myths represents the eye of Ra. At the beginning of time, when there was nothing but chaos, the sun god existed alone in the watery mass of Nun which filled the universe. \\"I am Atum when he was alone in Nun, I am Ra when he dawned, when he began to rule that which he had made.\\" This passage talks about how Atum created everything in human form out of the chaos and how Ra then began to rule over the earth where humans and divine beings coexisted. He created the Shu, god of air, and the goddess of moisture, Tefnut. The siblings symbolized two universal principles of humans: life and right (justice). Ra was believed to have created all forms of life by calling them into existence by uttering their secret names. In some accounts humans were created from Ra's tears and sweat. According to one myth the first portion of Earth came into being when the sun god summoned it out of the watery mass of Nun. In the myth of the Celestial Cow (the sky was thought of as a huge cow, the goddess Meht-urt) it is recounted how mankind plotted against Ra and how he sent his eye as the goddess Sekhmet to punish them. Extensions of Ra's power were often shown as the eye of Ra, which were the female versions of the sun god. Ra had three daughters Bastet, Sekhmet, and Hathor who were all considered the eye of Ra who would seek out his vengeance. Sekhmet was the Eye of Ra and was created by the fire in Ra's eye. She was violent and sent to slaughter the people who betrayed Ra, but when calm she became the more kind and forgiving goddess Hathor. Sekhmet was the powerful warrior and protector while Bastet, who was depicted as a cat, was shown as gentle and nurturing. === In the underworld === Ra was thought to travel on the Atet, two solar barques called the Mandjet (the Boat of Millions of Years) or morning boat and the Mesektet or evening boat. These boats took him on his journey through the sky and the Duat, the literal underworld of Egypt. While Ra was on the Mesektet, he was in his ram-headed form. When Ra traveled in his sun boat, he was accompanied by various other deities including Sia (perception) and Hu (command), as well as Heka (magic power). Sometimes, members of the Ennead helped him on his journey, including Set, who overcame the serpent Apophis, and Mehen, who defended against the monsters of the underworld. When Ra was in the underworld, he would visit all of his various forms. Apophis, the god of chaos, was an enormous serpent who attempted to stop the sun boat's journey every night by consuming it or by stopping it in its tracks with a hypnotic stare. During the evening, the Egyptians believed that Ra set as Atum or in the form of a ram. The night boat would carry him through the underworld and back towards the east in preparation for his rebirth. These myths of Ra represented the sun rising as the rebirth of the sun by the sky goddess Nut; thus attributing the concept of rebirth and renewal to Ra and strengthening his role as a creator god as well.Kemboly, Mpay. 2010. The Question of Evil in Ancient Egypt. London: Golden House Publications. When Ra was in the underworld, he merged with Osiris, the god of the dead. == Iconography == alt=Brooklyn Museum Ra-Khepri (solar disc and scarab beetle). Ra was represented in a variety of forms. The most usual form was a man with the head of a falcon and a solar disk on top and a coiled serpent around the disk. Other common forms are a man with the head of a beetle (in his form as Khepri), or a man with the head of a ram. Ra was also pictured as a full-bodied ram, beetle, phoenix, heron, serpent, bull, cat, or lion, among others.The Complete Gods and Goddesses of Ancient Egypt, Wilkinson He was most commonly featured with a ram's head in the Underworld. In this form, Ra is described as being the \\"ram of the west\\" or \\"ram in charge of his harem. In some literature, Ra is described as an aging king with golden flesh, silver bones, and hair of lapis lazuli. ==Worship== The chief cultic center of Ra was Iunu \\"the Place of Pillars\\", later known to the Ptolemaic Kingdom as Heliopolis (, \\"Sun City\\") and today located in the suburbs of Cairo. He was identified with the local sun god Atum. As Atum or Atum-Ra, he was reckoned the first being and the originator of the Ennead (\\"The Nine\\"), consisting of Shu and Tefnut, Geb and Nut, Osiris, Set, Isis and Nephthys. The holiday of \\"The Receiving of Ra\\" was celebrated on May 26 in the Gregorian calendar. Ra's local cult began to grow from roughly the Second Dynasty, establishing him as a sun deity. By the Fourth Dynasty, pharaohs were seen as Ra's manifestations on earth, referred to as \\"Sons of Ra\\". His worship increased massively in the Fifth Dynasty, when Ra became a state deity and pharaohs had specially aligned pyramids, obelisks, and sun temples built in his honor. The rulers of the Fifth Dynasty told their followers that they were sons of Ra himself and the wife of the high priest of Heliopolis. These pharaohs spent much of Egypt's money on sun temples. The first Pyramid Texts began to arise, giving Ra more and more significance in the journey of the pharaoh through the Duat (underworld). During the Middle Kingdom, Ra was increasingly affiliated and combined with other chief deities, especially Amun and Osiris. Ra on the solar barque At the time of the New Kingdom of Egypt, the worship of Ra had become more complicated and grander. The walls of tombs were dedicated to extremely detailed texts that depicted Ra's journey through the underworld. Ra was said to carry the prayers and blessings of the living with the souls of the dead on the sun boat. The idea that Ra aged with the sun became more popular during the rise of the New Kingdom. Many acts of worship included hymns, prayers, and spells to help Ra and the sun boat overcome Apep. The rise of Christianity in the Roman Empire put an end to the worship of Ra.Quirke, S. (2001). The cult of Ra: Sun-worship in ancient Egypt. New York: Thames and Hudson, p.144. ==Relationship to other gods== Fragment of a limestone stela of Djiho (Djedher), the God's Father of Min. Ptolemaic, 27th Dynasty. From Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London === Gods merged with Ra === Ra and Amun, from the tomb of Ramses IV. As with most widely worshiped Egyptian deities, Ra's identity was often combined with other gods, forming an interconnection between deities. ;Amun and Amun-Ra : Amun was a member of the Ogdoad, representing creation energies with Amaunet, a very early patron of Thebes. He was believed to create via breath and thus was identified with the wind rather than the sun. As the cults of Amun and Ra became increasingly popular in Upper and Lower Egypt respectively they were combined to create Amun-Ra, a solar creator god. It is hard to distinguish exactly when this combination happened, but references to Amun-Ra appeared in pyramid texts as early as the Fifth Dynasty. The most common belief is that Amun-Ra was invented as a new state deity by the Theban rulers of the New Kingdom to unite worshipers of Amun with the older cult of Ra around the 18th Dynasty. Amun-Ra was given the official title \\"King of the Gods\\" by worshippers, and images show the combined deity as a red-eyed man with a lion's head that had a surrounding solar disk. ;Atum and Atum-Ra : Atum-Ra (or Ra-Atum) was another composite deity formed from two completely separate deities, however Ra shared more similarities with Atum than with Amun. Atum was more closely linked with the sun, and was also a creator god of the Ennead. Both Ra and Atum were regarded as the father of the deities and pharaohs and were widely worshiped. In older myths, Atum was the creator of Tefnut and Shu, and he was born from ocean Nun. Imentet and Ra from the tomb of Nefertari, 13th century ; Ra- Horakhty Pyramidion of Khonsu, with the image of Ra-Horakhty in the middle. : In later Egyptian mythology, Ra-Horakhty was more of a title or manifestation than a composite deity. It translates as \\"Ra (who is) Horus of the Horizons\\". It was intended to link Horakhty (as a sunrise-oriented aspect of Horus) to Ra. It has been suggested that Ra-Horakhty simply refers to the sun's journey from horizon to horizon as Ra, or that it means to show Ra as a symbolic deity of hope and rebirth. (See earlier section #The sun). ;Khepri and Khnum : Khepri was a scarab beetle who rolled up the sun in the mornings and was sometimes seen as the morning manifestation of Ra. Similarly, the ram-headed god Khnum was also seen as the evening manifestation of Ra. The idea of different deities (or different aspects of Ra) ruling over different times of the day was fairly common but variable. With Khepri and Khnum taking precedence over sunrise and sunset, Ra often was the representation of midday when the sun reached its peak at noon. Sometimes different aspects of Horus were used instead of Ra's aspects. ;Raet-Tawy :Raet or Raet-Tawy was a female aspect of Ra; she did not have much importance independent of him. In some myths she was considered to be either Ra's wife or his daughter. === Gods created by Ra === ;Bastet :Bastet (also called Bast) is sometimes known as the \\"cat of Ra\\". She is also his daughter by Isis and is associated with Ra's instrument of vengeance, the sun-god's eye. Bastet is known for decapitating the serpent Apophis (Ra's sworn enemy and the \\"God\\" of Chaos) to protect Ra. In one myth, Ra sent Bastet as a lioness to Nubia. ;Sekhmet : Sekhmet is another daughter of Ra. Sekhmet was depicted as a lioness or large cat, and was an \\"eye of Ra\\", or an instrument of the sun god's vengeance. In one myth, Sekhmet was so filled with rage that Ra was forced to turn her into a cow so that she would not cause unnecessary harm. In another myth, Ra fears that mankind is plotting against him and sends Hathor (another daughter of Ra) to punish humanity. While slaughtering humans she takes the form of Sekhmet. To prevent her from killing all humanity, Ra orders that beer be dyed red and poured out on the land. Mistaking the beer for blood, Sekhmet drinks it, and upon becoming intoxicated, she reverts to her pacified form, Hathor.Graves- Brown, Carolyn (2004). Dancing for Hathor: Women in Ancient Egypt. Continuum. pp. 74–75 ;Hathor : Hathor is another daughter of Ra. When Ra feared that mankind was plotting against him, he sent Hathor as an \\"eye of Ra\\". In one myth, Hathor danced naked in front of Ra until he laughed to cure him of a fit of sulking. When Ra was without Hathor, he fell into a state of deep depression. === Other gods === Neith, Brooklyn Museum ;Ptah :Ptah is rarely mentioned in the literature of Old Kingdom pyramids. This is believed by some to be a result of the Ra-worshipping people of Heliopolis being the main writers of these inscriptions. While some believed that Ra is self-created, others believed that Ptah created him.The World Almanac and Book of Facts 2011. p. 708. ;Isis : In one myth, Isis created a serpent to poison Ra and only gave him the antidote when he revealed his true name to her. Isis passed this name on to Horus, bolstering his royal authority. ;Apep : Apep, also called Apophis, was the god of chaos and Ra's arch-enemy. He was said to lie just below the horizon line, trying to devour Ra as Ra traveled through the underworld. ==In popular cultureSee also== * List of solar deities ==ReferencesFurther reading== * *Collier, Mark and Manley, Bill.

At long, it is one of the region's longest rivers, wends in a steep valley through the cathedral city of Durham and gives its name to Weardale in its upper reach and Wearside by its mouth. == Etymology == The origin behind the hydronym Wear is uncertain but is generally understood to be Celtic. The River Vedra on the Roman Map of Britain may very well be the River Wear. The name may be derived from Brittonic *wejr (<*wẹ:drā), which meant \\"a bend\\" (c.f Welsh -gwair-). An alternative but very problematic etymology might involve *wẹ:d-r-, from a lengthened form of the Indo-European root *wed- \\"water\\". Also suggested is a possible derivation from the Brittonic root *wei-, which is thought to have meant \\"to flow\\". The name Wear has also been explained as being an ancient Celtic name meaning \\"river of blood\\". It is possible that the Wear has the same etymology as the River Wyre in Lancashire, as well as the Quair Water in Scotland. ==Geology== The Wear rises in the east Pennines, an upland area raised up during the Caledonian orogeny. Specifically, the Weardale Granite underlies the headwaters of the Wear. Devonian Old Red Sandstone in age, this Weardale Granite does not outcrop but was surmised by early geologists, and subsequently proven to exist as seen in the Rookhope borehole. It is the presence of this granite that has retained the high upland elevations of this area (less through its relative hardness, and more due to isostatic equilibrium) and accounts for heavy local mineralisation, although it is considered that most of the mineralisation occurred during the Carboniferous period. It is thought that the course of the River Wear, prior to the last Ice Age, was much as it is now as far as Chester-le-Street. This can be established as a result of boreholes, of which there have been many in the Wear valley due to coal mining. However, northwards from Chester-le-Street, the Wear may have originally followed the current route of the lower River Team. The last glaciation reached its peak about 18,500 years ago, from which time it also began a progressive retreat, leaving a wide variety of glacial deposits in its wake, filling existing river valleys with silt, sand and other glacial till. At about 14,000 years ago, retreat of the ice paused for maybe 500 years at the city of Durham. This can be established by the types of glacial deposits in the vicinity of Durham City. The confluence of the River Browney was pushed from Gilesgate (the abandoned river valley still exists in Pelaw Woods), several miles south to Sunderland Bridge (Croxdale). At Chester-le-Street, when glacial boulder clay was deposited blocking its northerly course, the River Wear was diverted eastwards towards Sunderland where it was forced to cut a new, shallower valley. The gorge cut by the river through the Permian Magnesian Limestone can be seen most clearly at Ford Quarry. In the 17th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica (1990), reference is made to a pre-Ice Age course of the River Wear outfalling at Hartlepool. The upland area of Upper Weardale retains a flora that relates, almost uniquely in England, to the end of the last Ice Age, although it almost or entirely lacks the particular rarities that make up the unique \\"Teesdale Assemblage\\" of post-glacial plants. This may, in part, be due to the Pennine areas of Upper Weardale and Upper Teesdale being the site of the shrinking ice cap. The glaciation left behind many indications of its presence, including lateral moraines and material from the Lake District and Northumberland, although surprisingly few drumlins. After the Ice Age, the Wear valley became thickly forested, however during the Neolithic period and increasingly in the Bronze Age, were largely deforested for agriculture. ==Industrial history== Much of the River Wear is associated with the history of the Industrial Revolution. Its upper end runs through lead mining country, until this gives way to coal seams of the Durham coalfield for the rest of its length. As a result of limestone quarrying, lead mining and coal mining, the Wear valley was amongst the first places to see the development of railways. The Weardale Railway continues to run occasional services between Stanhope and Wolsingham. Mining of lead ore has been known in the area of the headwaters of the Wear since the Roman occupation and continued into the nineteenth century. Spoil heaps from the abandoned lead mines can still be seen, and since the last quarter of the twentieth century have been the focus of attention for the recovery of gangue minerals in present mining, such as fluorspar for the smelting of aluminium. However, abandoned mines and their spoil heaps continue to contribute to heavy metal mineral pollution of the river and its tributaries. This has significance to fishing in times of low flow and infrastructure costs as the River Wear is an important source of drinking water for many of the inhabitants along its course. Fluorspar is another mineral sporadically co-present with Weardale Granite and became important in the manufacture of steel from the late 19th century into the 20th century. In many cases the steel industries were able to take fluorspar from old excavation heaps. Fluorspar explains why iron and steel manufacture flourished in the Wear valley, Consett and Teesside during the nineteenth century. Overlying are three Carboniferous minerals: limestone, Coal Measures as raw materials for iron and steel manufacture, and sandstone, useful as a refractory material. The last remaining flourspar mine closed in 1999 following legislation re water quality. A mine at Rogerley Quarry, Frosterley, is operated by an American consortium who occasionally work it for specimen minerals. Minco are currently exploring the North Pennines and the upper Wear catchment for potential reserves of zinc at lower levels. Ironstone which was important as the ore was won from around Consett and Tow Law, then around Rookhope, while greater quantities were imported from just south of the southerly Tees in North Yorkshire. These sources were in due course depleted or became uneconomic. The former cement works at Eastgate, until recently run by Lafarge, was based on an inlier of limestone. The site recently gained planning permission to form a visitor complex showcasing an eco-village using alternative technology, including a \\"hot rocks\\" water heating system. The underlying granite has been drilled and reports confirm their presence. Bardon Aggregates continue to quarry at Heights near Westgate and operate a tarmac \\"blacktop\\" plant on site. Mineral extraction has also occurred above St John's Chapel with the extraction of ganister which was used in the steel process at Consett. Around Frosterley, limestone, sand (crushed sandstone) and Frosterley Marble have been worked and the Broadwood Quarry recently expanded into ground held on an old licence. The crushing plant continues to operate. A quarry at Bollihope was also mooted on a similar basis but plans seem to have been discontinued. Frosterley Marble was used extensively in church architecture, there are local examples in St Michael's church Frosterley and Durham Cathedral. ==Course== Rising in the east Pennines, its head waters consisting of several streams draining from the hills between Killhope Law and Burnhope Seat, the head of the river is held to be in Wearhead, County Durham at the confluence of Burnhope Burn and Killhope Burn. This is shown on Ordnance Survey maps, and on the County Durham GIS online. However, a map produced by Durham County Council, and used on an interpretation board at Cowshill shows the River Wear taking in the northwest Killhope Burn from Wearhead up to Killhope. Excepting that this apparent extension of the Wear is an error, it can be assumed that there are attempts to reclassify Killhope Burn as the River Wear - on some analyses this practice of backtracking is common in the study of rivers as it gives the River Wear an issue as the source instead of a confluence, to which this article's Geology relates. The River Wear is a spate river and has been heavily influenced by previous government funded drainage schemes (gripping) with a view to improving marginal agricultural land. The river rises very quickly and has experienced much heavy flooding resulting in enhanced river bank erosion The river flows eastwards through Weardale, one of the larger valleys of west County Durham, subsequently turning south-east, and then north-east, meandering its way through the Wear Valley still in County Durham to the North Sea where it outfalls at Wearmouth in the main locality of Monkwearmouth on Wearside in the City of Sunderland. The from head to mouth. Prior to the creation of Tyne and Wear, the Wear had been the longest river in England with a course entirely within one county. The Weardale Way, a long- distance public footpath, roughly follows the entire route, including the length of Killhope Burn. ===Wearhead to Bishop Auckland=== The wooded riverbanks of the Wear as it flows from Stanhope to Frosterley There are several towns, sights and tourist places along the length of the river. The market town of Stanhope is known in part for the ford across the river. From here the river is followed by the line of the Weardale Railway, which crosses the river several times, through Frosterley, Wolsingham, and Witton-le-Wear to Bishop Auckland. ===Bishop Auckland to Durham=== On the edge of Bishop Auckland the Wear passes below Auckland Park and Auckland Castle, the official residence of the Bishop of Durham and its deer park. A mile or so downstream from here, the Wear passes Binchester Roman Fort, Vinovia, having been crossed by Dere Street, the Roman road running from Eboracum (now York) to Coria (now Corbridge) close to Hadrian's Wall. From Bishop Auckland the River Wear meanders in a general northeasterly direction, demonstrating many fluvial features of a mature river, including wide valley walls, fertile flood plains and ox-bow lakes. Bridges over the river become more substantial, such as those at Sunderland Bridge (near Croxdale), and Shincliffe. At Sunderland Bridge the River Browney joins the River Wear. ===Durham=== The wooded riverbanks of the Wear as it flows through Durham. When it reaches the city of Durham the River Wear passes through a deep, wooded gorge, from which several springs emerge, historically used as sources of potable water. A few coal seams are visible in the banks. Twisting sinuously in an incised meander, the river has cut deeply into the \\"Cathedral Sandstone\\" bedrock. The high ground (bluffs) enclosed by this meander is known as the Peninsula, forming a defensive enclosure, at whose heart lies Durham Castle and Durham Cathedral and which developed around the Bailey into Durham city. That area is now a UN World Heritage Site. Beneath Elvet Bridge are Brown's Boats (rowing boats for hire) and the mooring for the Prince Bishop, a pleasure cruiser. The River Wear at Durham was featured on a television programme Seven Natural Wonders as one of the wonders of Northern England. In June each year, the Durham Regatta, which predates that at Henley, attracts rowing crews from around the region for races along the river's course through the city. Seven smaller Regattas and Head Races are held throughout the rest of the year, which attract a lower number of competitors. There are 14 boathouses and 20 boat clubs based on the Wear in Durham. Two weirs impede the flow of the river at Durham, both originally created for industrial activities. The Old Fulling Mill is now an archaeological museum. The second weir, beneath Milburngate Bridge, now includes a salmon leap and fish counter, monitoring sea trout and salmon, and is on the site of a former ford. Considering that 138,000 fish have been counted migrating upriver since 1994, it may not be surprising that a family of cormorants live on this weir, and can frequently be watched stretching their wings in an attempt to dry off after feeding (as they lack the waterproofing oils present in most other waterbirds). The river's banks also lend their name to a hymn tune Elvet Banks in the 2006 hymnbook of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, used (appropriately) for a hymn for baptism. ===Durham to Chester-le-Street=== Finchale Priory on the banks of the River Wear between Durham City and Chester-le-Street. Note the wooden footbridge across the river on the right of the photograph. Between Durham City and Chester-le-Street, due north, the River Wear changes direction repeatedly, flowing south westwards several miles downstream having passed the medieval site of Finchale Priory, a former chapel and later a satellite monastery depending on the abbey church of Durham Cathedral. Two miles downstream, the river is flowing south eastwards. The only road bridge over the Wear between Durham and Chester-le-Street is Cocken Bridge. As it passes Chester-le-Street, where the river is overlooked by Lumley Castle, its flood plain has been developed into The Riverside, the home pitch of Durham County Cricket Club. Passing through the Lambton Estate and near Lambton Castle the river becomes tidal, and navigable. ===Chester-le-Street to Sunderland=== On exiting the Lambton estate the river leaves County Durham and enters the City of Sunderland, specifically the southern/south-eastern edge of the new town of Washington. At Fatfield the river passes beneath Worm Hill, around which the Lambton Worm is reputed to have curled its tail. Already the riverbanks are showing evidence of past industrialisation, with former collieries and chemical works. A little further downstream the river passes beneath the Victoria Viaduct, (formally called the Victoria Bridge). Named after the newly crowned queen, the railway viaduct opened in 1838, was the crowning achievement of the Leamside Line, then carrying what was to become the East Coast Main Line. A mile to the east is Penshaw Monument, a local iconic landmark. As the river leaves the environs of Washington, it forms the eastern boundary of Washington Wildfowl Trust. ===Sunderland=== St. Peter's Campus, University of Sunderland. Shadows in Another Light, a sculpture in which the shadow cast by a tree represents a hammerhead crane, unique to the Sunderland shipyards, can be seen at the left of this image. Having flowed beneath the A19 trunk road, the river enters the suburbs of Sunderland. The riverbanks show further evidence of past industrialisation, with former collieries, engineering works and dozens of shipyards. In their time, Wearside shipbuilders were some of the most famous and productive shipyards in the world. The artist L. S. Lowry visited Sunderland repeatedly and painted pictures of the industrial landscape around the river. Four bridges cross the Wear in Sunderland: the Northern Spire Bridge to the west, the Queen Alexandra Bridge, and the Wearmouth rail and road bridges in the city centre. On both banks at this point there are a number of modern developments, notably Sunderland A.F.C.'s Stadium of Light and others belonging to the University of Sunderland (St. Peter's Campus; Scotia Quay residences) and to the National Glass Centre. A riverside sculpture trail runs alongside this final section of its north bank. The St Peter's Riverside Sculpture Project was created by Colin Wilbourn, with crime novelist and ex-poet Chaz Brenchley. They worked closely with community groups, residents and schools. As the river approaches the sea, the north bank at Roker has a substantial residential development and marina. A dolphin nicknamed Freddie was a frequent visitor to the marina, attracting much local publicity. However, concern was expressed that acclimatising the dolphin to human presence might put at risk the safety of the dolphin regarding the propellors of marine craft. The south bank of the river is occupied by what remains of the Port of Sunderland, once thriving and now almost gone. The River Wear flows out of Sunderland between Roker Pier and South Pier, and into the North Sea. == See also == * List of crossings of the River Wear * List of rivers of England * Rowing clubs on the River Wear * Harry Watts – multiple River Wear life-saver ==Gallery== Image:River Wear Sunderland Bridge railway viaduct 20070630.jpgCroxdale Viaduct carrying the East Coast Main Line Image:River Wear Sunderland Bridge 20070630.jpgSunderland Bridge Image:River Wear Sunderland Bridge (2) 20070630.JPGSunderland Bridge Image:River Wear Shincliffe Bridge 20070630.JPGThe 1826 stone bridge at Shincliffe Image:River Wear Maiden Castle Bridge 20070630.JPGMaiden Castle footbridge Image:River Wear Baths Bridge 20070630.JPGBaths Bridge Image:River Wear New Elvet Bridge 20070630.JPGNew Elvet Bridge Image:River Wear Elvet Bridge (1) 20070630.JPGElvet Bridge Image:River Wear Durham Kingsgate Bridge 20070630.jpglooking towards Kingsgate Bridge Image:Dunelm-view.jpgKingsgate Bridge Image:River Wear Durham Prebends Bridge (1) 20011229.jpgPrebends Bridge Image:Durham City 30c 20031207 Prebends Bridge 02a.jpgPrebends Bridge Image:Durham City 35c 20030907 River Wear 01 upstream.jpgMilburngate Bridge (foreground) and Framwellgate Bridge (background) Image:Durham City 20030907 Pennyfeather Bridge 03 (originals).JPGPennyferry Bridge Image:River Wear 20070701 Cocken Bridge 01.jpgCocken Bridge Image:River Wear 20070702 Washington Fatfield Bridge 01.jpgFatfield Bridge Image:River Wear 20070702 Washington Victoria Viaduct 01.jpgVictoria Viaduct Image:River Wear 20070702 Hylton Viaduct 01.jpgHylton Viaduct Image:Wearmouth bridge.jpgWearmouth Bridge Image:Roker Lighthouse - geograph.org.uk - 1095762.jpgRoker Pier lighthouse, where the river meets the sea ==Notes and references== ;Notes ;References == Sources == *Natural Environment Research Council, Institute of Geological Sciences, 1971, \\"British Regional Geology: Northern England\\" Fourth Edition, HMSO, London. *Johnson, G.A.L. & Hickling, G.

He was the Mayor of Wairoa from 1995 to 2001. Born in Auckland, he grew up 45 km east of Wairoa on the Mahia Peninsula. He is of Ngāti Kahungunu and Ngāti Porou descent. He worked for Television New Zealand to 1986, where he fronted Koha a Māori current affairs programme, and produced Te Karere a Māori news programme from 1983. He then launched Mana magazine and Rotorua- based Mana Māori News. He also became the chair of the Māori Broadcasters Association, which was later renamed Ngā Aho Whakaari. Next he was Chairman of the board of Māori TV. Although he hired and then fired (for falsifying his CV) Canadian John Davy as chief executive, Prime Minister Helen Clark said he was the pre-eminent Māori broadcaster of his generation. Fox contested the as an independent in the electorate. He stood for the Māori Party in the 2008 election, again in the Ikaroa-Rāwhiti electorate, against Labour's Parekura Horomia. In both elections, he opposed the Māori Affairs minister, but his candidacies were unsuccessful. Maori Party confirms Fox's domestic violence history. \\"He has been guilty of physical abuse 30 or 40 years ago with his wife, and families dealt with that at the time,\\" Prof Winiata said. \\"Subsequently, 15 or 16 years ago, he and his partner at the time had an encounter and Derek reported that to the police.\\" Mr Fox received counselling on anger management after the second incident and did not expect there would be a recurrence. Asked on Radio New Zealand whether he thought Mr Fox's history should exclude him from becoming an MP, he replied: \\"Not when it has been dealt with and the person involved has made what appeared to be a very sincere effort to manage what they see as a personal problem.\\" The party is standing by Mr Fox, who has refused to comment to the media and has not returned NZPA's calls. He has issued a statement saying he had done things in his past that he regretted, had taken responsibility for them and believed he was now a different person. ==Charlie Hebdo Murders == In January 2015, Fox became the subject of considerable public controversy for a Facebook post that blamed Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier for causing the deaths of the victims in the Paris terror attacks. ==See also== * List of New Zealand television personalities ==References== *Dominion 10 April 1993 (page 10) *New Zealand Herald 4 May 2002 (pages B1, B3) *North and South April 2001 (no 181, pages 82–87) http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/maori-party-confirms-foxs-domestic- violence-history-32948 ==External links== * Biography of Derek Fox on NZ On Screen Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand television presenters Category:New Zealand journalists Category:New Zealand television journalists Category:Mayors of Wairoa Category:Māori mayors Category:Māori Party politicians Category:Ngāti Kahungunu Category:Ngāti Porou Category:New Zealand Māori broadcasters Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 2008 New Zealand general election Category:21st-century New Zealand politicians Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1999 New Zealand general election Category:People from Mahia Peninsula ","title":"Derek Fox (broadcaster)"},{"id":"19230896","text":"Miners in the cage ready for their descent, Wearmouth Colliery, 1993.

The fairground itself was established in 1482 by Louis XI for the benefit of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés and was located near the Abbey on the Left Bank southwest of the city center just outside one of the gates of the city wall built by Philip II at the beginning of the 13th century. The covered Saint-Germain market today occupies part of the former fairground site with access from the Boulevard Saint-Germain via the Rue de Montfaucon (satellite view).Coupe 2009, pp. 304–305. The fair generally lasted three to five weeks around Easter. During the 18th century it consistently opened on 3 February and lasted until Palm Sunday. The fair's first actors whose names are recorded were Jehan Courtin and Nicolas Poteau, who so entertained the Parisian public in 1595 that the actors of the Hôtel de Bourgogne filed a suit against them; they probably lost because the two fairground actors returned several years later. In 1618, André Soleil and Isabel Le Gendre met with similar success. Later, marionette manipulators, tightrope walkers and animal trainers so delighted the fair-going public that in 1643, Paul Scarron dedicated a poem on the subject to the Duke of Orléans. Among the most famous artists of the Saint-Germain fair were: marionnette manipulators Jean and François Datelin (better known by the name Brioché), Jean-Baptiste Archambault, Jérôme, Arthur and Nicolas Féron; dancers Charles and Pierre Alard, Moritz von der Beek (aka Maurice), Alexandre Bertrand and Louis Nivelon; actors Louis Gauthier de Saint-Edme, Jean-Baptiste Constantini, Catherine von der Beek, Étienne Baron, Charles Dolet, Antoine Francassani, Jean-Baptiste Hamoche, Dominique Biancolelli, Francisque, and many others for whom Alain-René Lesage, Louis Fuzelier and Jacques-Philippe d'Orneval wrote numerous plays. Early operatic works by Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny were performed at the fair: the intermède Les aveux indiscrets (7 February 1759), and the opéras bouffons Le maître en droit (13 February 1760), and Le cadi dupé (4 February 1761). François-André Danican Philidor's opéra comique Blaise le savetier was produced there on 9 March 1759, followed by Le jardinier et son seigneur on 18 February 1761.

Foire Saint-Germain in 1763, miniature by Blarenberghe } ==Foire Saint-Laurent== Turgot's 1739 map of Paris (detail from plate 13) The Saint Laurent fair was first established in 1183 in central Paris at Les Champeaux (later better known as Les Halles). After a century and a half, it moved north of Paris to a site near the fair's new sponsor, the leper colony of Saint-Lazare. In 1661 it moved to a nearby enclosure on the north side of the Rue de Saint Laurent, across from and a bit west of the Church of Saint-Laurent.Venard 1985, pp. 16, 30–33. The new location was just east of the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Denis, across from the Abbaye des frères de Saint-Lazare (as the leper colony was now known). The Abbaye was later to become the Prison Saint-Lazare, and finally the Hôpital Saint-Lazare. Although the fairground was demolished in the early 19th century, its former site is located directly southwest of the entrance to today's Gare de l'Est. The Saint-Laurent fair was a meeting place for artisans, merchants, and the middle class, and was held outdoors, while the Saint-Germain fair, sheltered from the weather, served as more of a showcase for luxury commodities (jewelry, china, musical instruments, prints). Many artists and performance troupes from the Saint-Germain fair also appeared at Saint-Laurent, as one fair happenened in the spring and the other took place in the summer. Beginning in the eighteenth century, the Saint-Laurent Fair was scheduled to last from 9 August to 29 September. The alternation in the timing of the fairs allowed the public to follow their favorite shows and permitted the evolution of a kind of theatrical \\"soap opera\\", where a play which began at Saint-Germain was continued at Saint-Laurent. A number of celebrated opéras comiques by François-André Danican Philidor were first performed at the fair: Le diable à quatre, ou La double métamorphose (19 August 1756), L'huître et les plaideurs, ou Le tribunal de la chicane (17 September 1759), Le soldat magicien (14 August 1760), and Le maréchal ferrant (22 August 1761). Pierre- Alexandre Monsigny's On ne s'avise jamais de tout was premiered there on 14 September 1761. ==Foire Saint-Ovide== Foire Saint-Ovide around 1770 by Jacques-Gabriel Huquier, (musée de la Révolution française). Founded in 1764 at the Place Louis XIV (now known as Place Vendôme), the Saint-Ovide fair moved to the Place Louis XV (now called the Place de la Concorde) in 1772. A small fair, it nonetheless competed with the Saint-Laurent fair, taking place at roughly the same time of year (approximately August 15 to September 15). It disappeared in 1777, destroyed by a fire. ==Co-existence with the \\"grands théâtres\\"== From marionettes and tightrope walkers, fairground performers gradually came to perform extremely small plays, often written by renowned and talented authors. After the expulsion of Italian actors in 1697, actors and showmen were emboldened and they appropriated the Italians' repertoire. The professionalization of entertainment at the fair began to worry the Comédie- Française, which saw in it a dangerous competition. The Comédie-Française tried every means to preserve its privileges and, after many trials conducted before the Châtelet and the Parliament of Paris, it achieved the outright prohibition of performances with dialogue. But it had not counted on the tricks that fairground actors were able to deploy to subvert these prohibitions. Seeing themselves prohibited from using any dialogue onstage, the actors began in 1707 to only play their parts in the form of monologues, or to talk to a mute, to an interlocutor placed in the wings, or even to an animal. Later they invented a form of jargon evoking a sort of low Latin, but which did not compete with the French language of which the Comédie-Française claimed exclusive use. Later, performers would write all the dialogue on \\"écriteaux\\" (signs), a sort of paper roll on which they displayed the words of the play. Here is how Ménier, the Commissioner of Police in Paris, described the scene in 1718: > \\"Next appear three archers who want to stop Harlequin, who, playing his > lyre, charms them and manages to escape, all of which comprises the first > act, which is performed by the actors as well as by the audience with the > help of signs descending from above, on which are written the stories that > make up the play: the actors gesture and express through various pantomime > motions what is written on the signs, and the spectators sing and in some > places the actors, to link the verses, say a few words, and when the signs > come down, four violins, a bass, and an oboe sound the theme of the story > written on the signs which the public sings.\\" The Comédie-Française no longer had any objective reasons for working against the fair performers; their claims had been met. It was now the turn of the Académie Royale de Musique to tell the competition that it was the unique holder of the right to sing, dance and accompany plays with music in France. The balance of power played out differently here and soon, the directors of the opera, plagued by increasing financial crises, tried to save the day by selling two fair directors the right to produce sung performances. Thus the Opéra-Comique was born in 1714. Given the growing success of the fair performances, the opera demanded increasingly exorbitant royalties, which put a strain on fair directors. The strategic ally of the Opera, the Comédie- Française took the opportunity to deal a fatal blow in 1719: it obtained the removal of all fair shows, with the exception of marionnettes and tightrope walking. Meanwhile, the regent had restored the Comédie-Italienne: it took the opportunity to occupy the St. Laurent fair for three years, from 1721 to 1723, but it did not meet with the expected success. In 1724, a candle merchant named Maurice Honoré obtained permission to restore the Opéra-Comique and managed the company for three years. He was replaced by Pontau, Devienne, Jean Monnet and Charles Simon Favart, who directed the company successively until 1762, when it was reunited with the Comédie-Italienne. A variety of fairground attractions appeared alongside performances by the Opéra-Comique: dancers, puppeteers and tightrope artists performed next to giants, dwarfs, monsters, talking heads, performing animals, etc. Gradually, the shows were moved to the boulevards, mostly to the Boulevard du Temple which in the 19th century was nicknamed the Boulevard du Crime. It was also at the fairs and on the boulevards that Jean-Baptiste Nicolet's troupe, the Grands-Danseurs du Roi, was born. ==References== Notes: Cited sources: *Campardon, Émile (1877).

WGO is focused on \\"the improvement of standards in gastroenterology training and education on a global scale.\\" The association was founded in 1935 and incorporated in 1958. The WGO was originally known as the Organisation Mondiale de Gastroenterologie (OMGE) and was renamed the World Gastroenterology Organisation in 2006. Its activities include educational initiatives such as Training Centers, Train the Trainers Workshops, public awareness campaigns such as World Digestive Health Day and Global Guidelines which cascade, providing viable solutions which are adaptable to varying resource levels around the world, as well as a quadrennial World Congress of Gastroenterology. The WGO Foundation was incorporated in 2007 and is dedicated to raising funds to support the ongoing WGO education initiatives and activities. ==History== Georges Brohée (1887–1957), a Belgian surgeon who promoted modern gastroenterology, is largely responsible for the origin of the WGO, in particular by founding the Belgian Society of Gastroenterology in 1928 and by organizing the first International Congress of Gastroenterology in Brussels in 1935. In May 1958 the first World Congress of Gastroenterology was held in Washington DC, where Georges Brohée’s continuing efforts culminated in the constitution of the \\"Organisation Mondiale de Gastro-entérologie\\" (OMGE) on May 29, 1958. Dr H.L. Bockus was the organisation’s first President. His vision was to enhance standards of education and training in gastroenterology. Developed nations were the initial focus of the organization, however today the WGO embraces a global approach with a special emphasis on developing regions ==Structure== General management of the WGO is conducted by a Governing Council. Acting through the Governing Council, the organisation is empowered to undertake those activities necessary to fulfill the goals and mission of the WGO. The Executive Committee oversees various program and consists of the President, Vice President, Past President, Secretary General, and Treasurer. A General Assembly reviews and approves the work of the Governing Council and attends to other business (including the World Congress venue). The General Assembly is composed of representatives from all WGO Member Societies and regional associations. Each WGO Member Society has one vote in the General Assembly. WGO has a number of committees including: *Finance Committee *WGO Guidelines and Publications Committee *Nominations Committee *Education & Training Committee *Editorial Board The elections and renewal of the WGO officers and committees takes place on the occasion of the General Assembly, which is held during the quadrennial World Congress of Gastroenterology. ==ActivitiesEducational initiatives=== Training centers There are currently 20 WGO Training Centers: *Bangkok, Thailand *Bogotá, Colombia *Cairo, Egypt *Karachi, Pakistan *La Paz, Bolivia *La Plata, Argentina *Mexico City, Mexico *Rabat, Morocco *Rome, Italy *Santiago, Chile *Soweto, South Africa *Suva, Fiji *San José, Costa Rica *Porto Alegre, Brazil *Ankara, Turkey *Lagos, Nigeria *Khartoum, Sudan *Xi'an, China *Porto, Portugal *New Delhi, India ===Global Guidelines and Cascades=== Each guideline is translated into six languages including English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Mandarin Chinese.

Formed in 1978, the group originally consisted of vocalist and rhythm guitarist Chrissie Hynde, lead guitarist and vocalist James Honeyman-Scott, bassist and vocalist Pete Farndon, and drummer and vocalist Martin Chambers. After the release of their first two albums – Pretenders in 1980 and Pretenders II in 1981 – Farndon was fired from the band on 14 June 1982 due to increasing problems with drug abuse, which had led to Honeyman-Scott claiming he would leave if the bassist was not dismissed. Only two days later, however, Honeyman-Scott died as a result of heart failure brought on by a cocaine overdose. On 20 July, Hynde and Chambers began recording the single \\"Back on the Chain Gang\\", written in tribute to Honeyman-Scott, with session musicians Billy Bremner (lead guitar), Robbie McIntosh (rhythm guitar) and Tony Butler (bass). The single was released in October, and later featured on the 1984 album Learning to Crawl. In February 1983, The Pretenders returned with McIntosh and bassist Malcolm Foster. Learning to Crawl was released in 1984, after which the band remained largely inactive for a year (save for an appearance at Live Aid) as Hynde married Simple Minds frontman Jim Kerr and gave birth to daughter Yasmin. The group returned in early 1986 to record Get Close, but shortly after sessions began Chambers was fired by Hynde due to a deterioration in his drumming ability, which also led to Foster leaving. Chambers and Foster were replaced by Blair Cunningham and T. M. Stevens, respectively, who completed the album's recording and remained for its 1987 tour (keyboardist Bernie Worrell also joined at the same time). Shortly after beginning the tour, however, Hynde dismissed Stevens and Worrell and brought back Rupert Black (who had toured since Learning to Crawl) and Foster, who remained for the rest of the year. Johnny Marr replaced McIntosh in late 1987, before the band went on hiatus. Hynde returned in 1990 with Packed!, which was credited to The Pretenders only to fulfil a contractual obligation – Hynde was the only credited band member on the album, although Cunningham performed drums on all eleven tracks. A new full lineup of the band was formed in 1993 when Hynde enlisted guitarist Adam Seymour and, later, bassist Andy Hobson and returning drummer Chambers for Last of the Independents, released in 1994. Zeben Jameson was added as touring keyboardist, and the lineup of The Pretenders remained constant for more than ten years. Hobson was replaced by Nick Wilkinson in 2005, and in 2008 Seymour was replaced by James Walbourne and pedal steel guitarist Eric Heywood, both of whom first featured on Break Up the Concrete. ==MembersCurrent=== {  border=\\"1\\" width=100% - !width=\\"75\\"Image !width=\\"160\\"Name !width=\\"100\\"Years active !width=\\"170\\"Instruments !Release contributions -  Chrissie Hynde 1978–present  all The Pretenders releases -  Martin Chambers   all The Pretenders releases except Packed!

He was educated at Hawkhurst, Kent, and learnt the butchers trade as a youth working first with an uncle in London before migrating to New York. After two and a half years in North America he migrated to Rockhampton, Queensland in 1884. After working for a time in Brisbane and Sydney he moved to Melbourne in 1886 where he set up a butchers shop in North Carlton. He opened larger premises in Bourke Street, Melbourne in 1892 and started exporting frozen meat, becoming a pioneer of meat refrigeration. His meat export business was highly successful and he opened his own Freezing works in 1905 in Footscray. His meat export business expanded into New South Wales and Queensland and his business also diversified into owning or managing pastoral leases and cattle stations, including jointly with Sidney Kidman. He married Jacobena Grutzner at St. Columb's Church, Hawthorn, Victoria on 31 March 1919; they had one child, a daughter, Eirene Rose. Jacobena Angliss led a distinguished life as an Australian philanthropist, arts supporter and community worker. From 1912 to 1952 Angliss was a member of the Legislative Council of Victoria, representing Southern Province, a predominantly rural farming electorate to the north of Melbourne, for various Non-Labor parties including: Nationalist Party of Australia; United Australia Party; and Liberal Party. His most important political contribution is regarded as a system of preferential controls which boosted meat exports arising from the Ottawa Imperial Conference in 1932, where he was the official business consultant to the Australian delegation. In 1934 Angliss sold his meat business to the large British firm of Vesteys for 1.5million GBP, but retained many of his pastoral properties. He was knighted in 1939. Angliss family grave at Box Hill Cemetery. Sir William Angliss actively supported various charities including the Salvation Army and the settlement of migrant children in Australia. In 1940 he donated money to start a specialist trade or technical school specialising in providing vocational education and training opportunities for the hospitality and foods industries. Initially called the William Angliss Food Trades School, apprenticeship courses were offered in pastry, butchery, breadmaking and baking, cooking and waiting. The school is now known as the William Angliss Institute of TAFE and is highly regarded in its specialty areas of hospitality, cookery, and tourism. Sir William was also a noted Freemason, belonging to at least two Lodges – in one with Mr Billy Guyatt, the well known retailer, R J Gilbertson – another famous butcher, and Tommy Woodcock, the trainer of Pharlap. Sir William died on 15 June 1957. In his will, he set aside £1 million for the creation of two charitable funds: one in Victoria and one in Queensland, which are administered by the William Angliss Charitable Fund. He was buried at Box Hill Cemetery. ===Honours=== * Knight Bachelor of the British Empire, 8 June 1939 \\"In recognition of service to the public service in Victoria\\" ==See also== *Angliss Hospital *Jacobena Angliss *William Angliss Institute of TAFE ==References== * Angliss, Sir William Charles (1865–1957), Australian Dictionary of Biography Online Edition.

determine whether land is considered ‘contaminated’ under United Kingdom law, that is “land which appears to… be in such a condition, by reason of substances in, on or under the land, that (a) significant harm is being caused or there is a significant possibility of such harm being caused…” This guidance stipulates three stages in such risk assessments: #Preliminary qualitative assessment including development of conceptual site model #Generic Quantitative Risk Assessment (GQRA) #Detailed Quantitative Risk Assessment (DQRA) Soil Guideline Values are used in the second stage, GQRA, to determine whether harm caused by long-term exposure to a given soil concentration of chemicals may present an unacceptable risk to human health in some generic land-use scenario. The SGVs are therefore conservative estimates for a given scenario. Exceedance of a SGV does not confirm that there is a ‘significant possibility of significant harm’, merely that the possibility exists and therefore more detailed, site- specific investigation of contaminants present, pathways and receptors is required. == Derivation and relationship to Generic Assessment Criteria == SGVs are derived by the Environment Agency using the ‘CLEA’ model (which can also be customised or used for DQRA). However, there are no currently valid SGVs for many important and common elements, such as copper, zinc, lead or chromium. The only body mandated to produce these values is the Environment Agency, following extensive consultation with other government departments. In lieu of such figures, equivalent values known as “Generic Assessment Criteria” (GAC) may be calculated by any individual or organisation, starting from toxicity and relevant data and using the CLEA model, just as the Environment Agency calculates SGVs. SGVs are in fact a GAC derived and published by the environment agency. For example, a range of GACs for more complex chemicals has been calculated and been made publicly available by charity CL:AIRE, with input from a range of authoritative sources including the Environment Agency. That said, GACs are not always openly published, as deriving them is a complex matter and thus these values do hold commercial value for consultancies who have undertaken such calculations. == Scenarios and inherent assumptions == There are three generic land-use scenarios for which SGVs are published, and most derivations of GACs also follow these scenarios: * a residential setting, with a two-storey small terraced house where the most vulnerable ‘critical’ receptor of the contamination is a female child of zero to six years old, spending most of their time in or close to home *an allotment consisting of open space where vegetables may be grown, with the same critical receptor * a commercial three-storey office where the critical receptor is a working female adult aged 16–65 years old and exposed for a working lifetime of 49 years for 45 hours per week. SGVs and GACs derived from these scenarios may only be used if the scenarios apply exactly or otherwise it is clearly demonstrated that the scenarios are more conservative than the real-world situation. For example, in the case of a playing field, it could be argued that the residential scenario is suitably conservative: *the critical receptor (for the playing field) is likely to be older (than that for the residential case) therefore with a higher body mass and perhaps less likely to directly ingest soil *exposure times at the playing field will be far lower than at a residential site *the presumed absence of a building would likely reduce the possibility of vapour and dust build up *it's unlikely for vegetables to be grown on the playing field *all possible pathways are considered within the residential scenario ==See also== *soil contamination == External links == *DEFRA website == References == Category:Environmental standards Category:Soil ","title":"Soil guideline value"},{"id":"19231043","text":"is a tram station in Kōchi, Kōchi Prefecture, Japan.『土佐電鉄が走る街 今昔』99・156-158頁 『土佐電鉄が走る街 今昔』44-45頁 ==Lines== *Tosa Electric Railway **Ino Line ==Adjacent stations== - !colspan=5Tosa Electric Railway ==References== * ==External links== :Text copied in part from the corresponding article in the Japanese Wikipedia Category:Railway stations in Kōchi Prefecture Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1907 ","title":"Kōnai Station"},{"id":"19231050","text":"Once a Crook is a 1941 British crime film directed by Herbert Mason, produced by Edward Black for 20th Century Fox and featuring Gordon Harker, Sydney Howard, Bernard Lee, Kathleen Harrison, and Raymond Huntley.

These may include medical, behavioral, social, and legal services. Medical services are usually provided by mental health experts like psychiatrists, psychologists, and behavioral health counselors in a hospital or outpatient clinic. Behavioral services go hand-in-hand with medical services, referring specifically to pharmacological and cognitive therapy. Social services are usually provided by the government or nonprofit organizations. They arrange housing options, job training, or other community resources overseen by experienced professionals to ensure overall productivity and well being of individuals with mental illnesses. Legal services ensure that people with mental health disorders are not discriminated against in society and advocate for their basic human rights. In addition, legal services make sure that those individuals who might be a danger to themselves or others are diverted away from the judicial system to receive adequate treatment for underlying mental health issues. The information provided below is primarily regarding services offered within the United States of America, unless otherwise specified. ==Medical services== There are several types of medical service settings that can serve to deliver mental health care or services. These include, but are not limited to family practice, psychiatric hospitals or clinics, general hospitals, and community mental or behavioral health centers. Different services endorse different payment models. Some may be more government-based or patient-based, while others may endorse mixed-models payment systems. Not all service types or institutions are accessible by all patients. A considerable barrier surrounds the difficulty in finding in-network mental health care providers, given the backdrop of our current and critical nationwide shortage of mental health professionals. Family practice or general practice centers in communities are often the first line for assessment of mental health conditions. The basic services provided may include prescribing psychiatric drugs and sometimes providing basic counseling or therapy for \\"common mental disorders.\\" Secondary medical services may include psychiatric hospitals, or clinics. However, given the trend towards the deinstitutionalization of mental health hospitals - the movement of mental health patients out of the \\"asylum-based\\" mental health care system towards community-oriented care - psychiatric hospitals have been going out of favor, with services being directed to wards within general hospitals as well as more locally-based community mental health services. Mental health services may be provided either on an inpatient or, more commonly, an outpatient basis. A wide range of treatments may be provided to patients, with a mainstay of treatment being centered on psychiatric drugs. Various mental health professionals may be involved including psychiatrists, psychiatric and mental health nurses and, less commonly, non-medical professionals such as clinical psychologists, social workers, and various kinds of therapists or counselors. Usually headed by psychiatrists and therefore based on a medical model, multidisciplinary teams may be involved in assertive community treatment and early intervention, and may be coordinated via a case management system (sometimes referred to as \\"service coordination\\"). ==Behavioral therapy services== Numerous services exist exclusively for the therapy of mental disorders and distress. Since symptoms vary across individuals, therapy is usually individualized for patients. Methods exist that target numerous areas at once, such as integrative psychotherapy (an eclectic tailored mix of approaches). Integrative psychotherapists consider many factors when treating a patient, such as preferences, physical capabilities, or family support. In contrast to integrative psychotherapy, many approaches focus on particular areas. Cognitive behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal therapy, and dialectical behavioral therapy are all examples of approaches that have primary focuses when attempting to treat a patient. Conditions that can be treated by these therapies include anxiety, eating disorders, substance use disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, and insomnia. The chosen therapy depends on several factors, with patient preference being a significant one. Each type of therapy has its own strengths and weaknesses. Cognitive behavioral therapy is an attempt to allow patients to realize any inaccurate thoughts they may have and to allow them to perceive situations differently. It is thought that attitudes and behavior of an individual are altered when their thoughts change. Psychodynamic therapy differs from cognitive behavioral therapy in that it is a longer-term therapy that usually requires more sessions for its effectiveness. Psychodynamic therapy is less structured and relies heavily on the relationship between the therapist and the patient. Although cognitive behavioral therapy has become the more favored form of therapy, psychodynamic therapy continues to be viewed as the more effective treatment. An integrative approach would allow one therapist to implement both cognitive behavioral therapy and psychodynamic therapy while treating the same patient. Interpersonal therapy is highly structured and is usually targeted at depression. There is evidence that suggests interpersonal therapy provides a benefit that is equal to pharmacologic therapy for depression. Dialectical behavioral therapy is an evidence-based psychotherapy that is usually used to treat suicidal behaviors. Each form of behavioral therapy uses different strategies to reach the goal of improving the quality of life for patients. ==Social services== Community-based social services often include supportive housing, clubhouses, and national hotlines. These resources may be provided by people who are successfully living with psychiatric disorders. Peer-led support encourage those individuals struggling with mental health disorders to seek self-help strategies and belong to social support network. === Supportive housing === Supportive housing is an innovative solution that aims to provide permanent, accessible, and affordable housing options for individuals with mental health disorders. Additional help is often available to manage one's finances, daily activities, and healthcare needs. Rent is usually less than 30 percent of one's income and is further made affordable through rental assistance programs offered by the government. It, also, provides access to public transportation as well as healthcare providers and other community resources. In supervised or partially-supervised supportive housing, trained staff may be present to help with medication management, paying bills, cleaning, cooking, and other day-to-day tasks. These environments are usually group home settings, where individuals have their own bedroom and bathroom but share common areas with other residents. Alternatively, individuals may also choose to live in independent supportive housing if they do not require frequent supervision regarding their activities of daily living. It is important to note that tenants have the freedom to choose which services they would like to utilize based on their degree of independence and unmet needs. One of the limitations that prevent the widespread availability of supportive housing is the cost associated with hiring trained staff and maintaining the building as well as surrounding premises, while still keeping the rent affordable. However, studies have shown that the integrated services offered by supportive housing helps to decrease homelessness, incarceration rates, emergency room visits, and the number of days patients stay in a hospital. Such widespread effects can promote the lowering of costs associated with services in the above-mentioned areas and these funds can be diverted to sustain supportive housing projects. === Clubhouse model === Clubhouses are community centers that are usually run by individuals who have a current or previous history of mental illness. The main purpose of these establishments is to promote rehabilitation and self-sufficiency of individuals by offering them employment opportunities. This includes access to community workshops, job training programs, and educational opportunities. Additionally, clubhouse staff may maintain partnerships with local employers to provide full-time or part-time employment opportunities. Members, also, have access to social events and team-based activities, which helps them to develop a social support network. === Phone-based services === A mental health hotline is a free, confidential, and convenient way to receive information regarding various mental health services that are available in the community. The hotline is operated by trained employees and volunteers who can connect callers with the appropriate medical, legal, or social resources. There are no restrictions regarding how many times an individual may utilize a particular hotline. Some services may be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and via text messaging applications. A few phone-based services exclusively deal with mental health emergencies or crisis situations, such as suicide and substance abuse. Suicide prevention lifelines are operated by mental health counselors or community volunteers. They are trained to identify suicide risk, de-escalate an emergent crisis, and provide emotional support for those in distress. Substance abuse and relapse helplines provide behavioral support to those struggling with addiction as well as connect them with rehabilitation centers for treatment. Phone-based services also allow for providers to remove language barriers. This is due to the fact that there are several online translation services in order to record and relay information in real time, across several different languages. By eliminating language barriers, providers are also able to prevent patients from experiencing social prejudice. Patients can now reach out to a wider variety of providers and are no longer bound to their local community practitioners, where there could be added stigma. == Legal services == Legal services supervise the involuntary commitment or outpatient commitment of those judged to have mental disorders and to be a danger to themselves or others. Some legal organizations provide specialized services for those diagnosed with mental disorders who may be challenging discrimination or involuntary commitment. Mental health courts are specialized court dockets that provide community treatment and supervision in lieu of incarceration for criminal offenders with mental illness. A judge assesses the defendant's background as well as the influence of his or her mental disorder on the committed crime. A team of mental health professionals and legal advisors ensures that a particular mental health treatment program provides appropriate opportunities for rehabilitation and prevent future criminal behavior. The defendant is given the choice to decide if they want to participate in the treatment, unless they are unable to provide informed consent. In such cases, a conservator could make treatment decisions on behalf of the defendant and may give permission to use medications, if appropriate. Successful completion of the program may result in reduced sentences or all charges against the defendant to be dropped. ==Global situation Statistics === In 2017, more than 970 million or 1-in-7 individuals were purported to have one or more mental or substance use disorder(s). Anxiety and depressive disorders were, by far, the most attributed. Moreover, around 5%, and up to 12%, of global disease burden was attributable to mental or substance use disorders. Countries that have the greatest disease burden from mental or substance use disorders include Kuwait, Qatar, Australia, among others. A Global Mental Health Group in coordination with the World Health Organization has called for an urgent scaling up of the funding, staffing and coverage of services for mental disorders in all countries, especially in low- income and middle-income countries.Lancet Global Mental Health Group, Chisholm D, Flisher AJ, Lund C, Patel V, Saxena S, Thornicroft G, Tomlinson M.

The UK is moving towards paying mental health providers by the outcome results that their services achieve.https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mental-health-payment-by- results-arrangements- for-2013-14http://www.communitycare.co.uk/articles/16/04/2013/119098/a-quick- guide-to-mental-health-payment-by-results-and-its-impact-on-social-work.htm === Traditional and alternative services === Traditional healing centers are popular worldwide and provide accessible mental health services for the native population. This community-based practice is led by folk healers, who use herbal remedies, spiritual rituals, and indigenous perspectives to provide comfort for individuals. These services are highly culture-specific and, therefore, its structure varies across the globe. Traditional healing approaches are sometimes used alongside conventional or western medicine. In addition, each country has its own view on mental health disorders. While many nations share advocacy for mental health, there are still several countries that stigmatize medical or behavioral treatment for these disease states. Examples of these are Canada and China, such that both have high mental health illness rates but low utilization rates of mental health services. While the cause of this is unknown, it is believed to be due to general stigma in those communities towards seeking help for mental health. ==References== Category:Mental and behavioural disorders Category:Psychiatric services Category:Clinical psychology ","title":"Services for mental disorders"},{"id":"19231066","text":"Jean-Baptiste Nicolet (16 April 1728 – 27 December 1796) was an 18th-century French actor and manager.

High Flight was filmed with the co-operation of the Royal Air Force (RAF). The title of the film was derived from the poem of the same title by Pilot Officer John Gillespie Magee, Jr., an American aviator who flew for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) and lost his life in 1941 over RAF Cranwell, where much of the film was shot. ==Plot== A group of flight cadets arrive at RAF Cranwell to begin a three-year training course to become RAF pilots. Amongst the group is Tony Winchester (Kenneth Haigh) who makes a memorable entrance by landing his civilian Taylorcraft Auster aircraft with his girlfriend (Anne Aubrey) aboard on the RAF runway just ahead of a de Havilland Vampire jet trainer piloted by Wing Commander Rudge (Ray Milland). During the Second World War, Winchester's father had been Rudge's commanding officer and was killed protecting Rudge, who had disobeyed orders. Winchester is a difficult individual who harbours animosity towards Rudge over his father's death. Another of the aspiring pilots is the scientific minded Roger Endicott (Anthony Newley) who is also determined to create a working flying saucer. Endicott's flying radio-controlled model develops difficulties and crashes into the middle of a Bishop's (Ian Fleming) tea party. Winchester doesn't learn the meaning of teamwork and is nearly killed when he disobeys orders, flying into a storm. Rudge demands his resignation but reconsiders, remembering his own rash behaviour had been the cause of the death of Winchester's father. Rudge ultimately selects Winchester to fly in a precision aerial team training for the Farnborough Airshow. When the squadron is temporarily posted to a forward base in West Germany, Winchester flies close to hostile territory near the East German border and is nearly shot down by Communist anti-aircraft guns firing across the border. The wounded airman and his stricken aircraft are rescued by Rudge, who brings him back safely to a crash landing at his home base. Finally, Winchester comes to understand his role in the RAF and that he is part of a team effort. ==Cast== As appearing in screen credits (main roles identified):\\"Credits: High Flight (1957).\\" IMDb.

Davies visited various RAF stations in Britain and Germany as well as the RAF College at Cranwell. \\"To say that I was impressed with what I saw and learnt was an understatement\\", said Davies. \\"These young men who fly daily at supersonic speeds are the flower of our youth. They work hard and they play hard.\\"Davies, Jack. \\"A and B Won't Let Them Down\\". Kinematograph Weekly, 31 May 1956, pp. 16–17. Photography was originally scheduled around No. 111 Squadron RAF, nicknamed \\"Treble One\\" or \\"Tremblers\\", stationed at RAF Wattisham. The squadron was in the process of, or had been recently selected as the Royal Air Force Fighter Command Aerobatics Display Team, which became known as the Black Arrows.Paris 1995, p. 177. Film of the team at the 1956 Farnborough Airshow was featured.Goold, Ian. \\"60 years of Farnborough air shows.\\" Flight, 3 July 2008. When inclement weather interrupted filming at their home base, the production moved to RAF Leuchars in Fife. Scotland, base of No. 43 Squadron RAF. RAF Leuchars later stood in for RAF Wunsdorf in West Germany. Principal photography which began on 10 April 1957, also took place at RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, using not only the facility but also film of the graduating ceremony of a training course, as well as RAF Chivenor, Devon, United Kingdom. The use of RAF Percival Provost piston and de Havilland Vampire T.11 jet training aircraft and operational Hawker Hunter fighter aircraft heightened the authenticity of the film. During the course of production at RAF Leuchars, a Hunter \\"wheeled up\\" which allowed the film crew to use the wreck to simulate a Hunter crash. When the RAF did not allow the film crew to use an operational airframe as a camera aircraft, one Hunter was converted into a \\"PR\\" version, specially modified at great cost, to carry a forward-facing Cinemascope camera. A screen was drawn on the front windscreen of the camera Hunter with a chinagraph crayon. The pilot was instructed to fill the windscreen with aircraft. Additional air-to-air shots were taken from an Avro Lincoln bomber. Other aircraft visible in the film include Handley Page Hastings transport aircraft and Bristol Sycamore helicopters. The casting of Ray Milland was typical of the Warwick Films productions, in using the star power of an American actor but in the case of Milland, he was also well suited to the film and its subject matter. During the 1930s and into the 1940s, the Welsh-born actor had moved to Hollywood and during the Second World War, had served as a civilian instructor for the United States Army Air Forces.Landazuri, Margarita. \\"High Flight (1958).\\" Turner Classic Movies.

The Trustees administered the Duke's estate, which included coal mines at Worsley and the Bridgewater Canal. Robert Haldane Bradshaw was the eldest son of Thomas Bradshaw, who became Secretary to the Treasury and his wife Elizabeth Wilson, daughter of Robert Wilson, of Woodford, Essex and merchant of London. It is possible that Robert was educated at Harrow and he later entered public service. By 1800 he was agent to the Duke of Bridgewater. In 1802 the Duke appointed him as Member of Parliament for the pocket borough of Brackley and he retained this position until it was disenfranchised by the Reform Act of 1832. From 1825 until abolition he shared representation of the two-member seat with his own son, James, a Royal Navy captain, who committed suicide during his father's lifetime in 1833. History of Parliament online article on James Bradshaw. On the death of the Duke in 1803, his estate was vested in three Trustees, Bradshaw being appointed Superintendent. Bradshaw was totally responsible for running the estate, the other two being \\"dummy trustees\\". Following the death of the Duke, the income from the Bridgewater Trust went to his nephew George Leveson-Gower, the Marquess of Stafford (later the 1st Duke of Sutherland). On his death it was to go to Stafford's second son Francis Egerton. Bradshaw was reluctant to leave London, where his home was close to the Duke's house, Bridgewater House. While running the Bridgewater estate, he complained of being over-worked, although this was largely due to his inability to delegate. His personality was \\"intensely conservative\\", while he had the reputation of being a \\"formidable negotiator\\". In November 1831 he suffered a stroke, which affected his left arm and leg and which impaired his business judgement. The Duke of Sutherland died in 1833 and following a disagreement between Bradshaw and Francis Egerton, Bradshaw was persuaded to retire in 1834. He retired to Kings Langley and died there a year later. ==See also== *Canals of the United Kingdom *History of the British canal system ==References== Sources * Category:1759 births Category:1835 deaths Category:People educated at Harrow School Category:English businesspeople Category:People of the Industrial Revolution Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1802–1806 Category:UK MPs 1806–1807 Category:UK MPs 1807–1812 Category:UK MPs 1812–1818 Category:UK MPs 1818–1820 Category:UK MPs 1820–1826 Category:UK MPs 1826–1830 Category:UK MPs 1830–1831 Category:UK MPs 1831–1832 ","title":"Robert Haldane Bradshaw"},{"id":"19231217","text":"is a tram station in Ino, Agawa District, Kōchi Prefecture, Japan. ==Lines== *Tosa Electric Railway **Ino Line ==Adjacent stations== - !colspan=5Tosa Electric Railway ==External links== Category:Railway stations in Kōchi Prefecture Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 1908 ","title":"Nakayama Station (Kōchi)"},{"id":"19231250","text":"Okan Patirer (born 21 February 1979 in Salzgitter) is a Turkish actor. == Filmography == {  style=\\"font-size: 100%;\\" - !

Shortly after Mullarkey joined hometown side Lincoln United of the Northern Premier League, but departed the club in 2007. His career was kick started when he joined Grantham Town in 2007, following previous Lincoln United manager John Wilkinson. Mullarkey netted 19 times for the Grantham in 53 appearances, however he sustained injuries in a car accident during the pre-season, delaying his debut. Mullarkey joined Lincoln City, a team he supported as a boy, towards the end of the 2007–08 season after impressing in a number of pre-season games. Mullarkey was offered a 1-year contract by Peter Jackson, becoming Jackson's 8th signing of the summer.

Mullarkey strangely rejected a fresh contract with The Imps, after the club had hoped to sign him up for the 2009–2010 season, and then shortly afterwards he left the club along with Adrian Patulea, who like Mullarkey had decided to leave under similar circumstances after he also rejected a fresh deal with the club. Just before the start of the new season, Mullarkey re-signed for Lincoln United. Mullarkey was released by United in January 2010 due to cost-cutting measures.

Breakfast in Hollywood is a morning radio show created and hosted by Tom Breneman broadcast from 1941 to 1948 on three different radio networks: NBC, ABC and Mutual. These unscripted shows were spontaneous and involved much audience participation. Breneman's many guests included such stars as Jimmy Durante, Andy Devine and Orson Welles. Radio personality Breneman was in Hollywood having lunch in 1940 with friends at Sardi's Restaurant on Hollywood Boulevard when he realized the location's potential for a radio program. He quickly found an audience when he began broadcasting his Breakfast on the Boulevard January 13, 1941, on KFWB Los Angeles. Newspaper radio schedules indicate that West Coast stations were broadcasting the program as \\"Breakfast at Sardi's\\" as early as September 1941. The program was limited to radio stations in California, Oregon, and Washington State until Breakfast at Sardi's aired on the Blue Network from August 3, 1942. One source claims that on February 26, 1943 the title was changed to avoid confusion with Sardi's in New York. However, newspaper radio schedules for the New York listening area began changing from \\"Breakfast at Sardi's\\" to \\"Breakfast in Hollywood\\" only in early 1945 while other newspapers referred to Breneman's program as \\"Breakfast at Sardi's\\" until mid-1945. The program had numerous sponsors, including Kellogg's cereals, Ivory Flakes, Planters Peanuts, Aunt Jemima Flour, Minute Man Soups and Alpine Coffee. By the mid-1940s, Breneman had ten million listeners. The popularity of the radio program was such that he created his own magazine, and in 1945 he opened his own establishment, Tom Breneman's Restaurant, located on Vine Street off Sunset Boulevard.Tom Breneman's \\"Breakfast in Hollywood\\" - Dear Old Hollywood \\"Breneman originally hosted Breakfast in Hollywood from the former Tropics nightclub on Vine but later bought the Hollywood Recreation Center next door, converting the bowling alley into a restaurant and radio studio.\\" Organist Korla Pandit was only one of the musical talents who performed at the restaurant. ==Film== In 1945, flush with success, Breneman promoted the production of a 90-minute feature film, Breakfast in Hollywood (1946) starring Breneman, Bonita Granville, Beulah Bondi, Raymond Walburn, ZaSu Pitts, Billie Burke and Hedda Hopper, featuring musical numbers by Spike Jones, the Nat King Cole Trio and Andy Russell. Songs include \\"It Is Better to Be Yourself\\" by Nat King Cole and \\"If I Had a Wishing Ring\\" by Marla Shelton and Louis Alter. \\"Magic is the Moonlight,\\" \\"Amor\\", and \\"If I had a Wishing Ring\\" are sung by crooner Andy Russell. The film is available on DVD from Mill Creek Entertainment in the Classic Musicals 50 movie pack. ==Other== At the age of 47, Breneman died April 28, 1948, in Encino, California, and other hosts, including Garry Moore, stepped in as replacements, but without Breneman, the ratings dropped, and the program came to an end in January 1949. ==Show Format== Intro from MC Johnny Masterson. Hearty \\" Good Morning Ladies\\" from Tom. Ivory flakes portion of show starts with visiting patrons: \\" Who are you?\\" Ivory flakes commercial. \\"Going for a hat\\".

Although the resolution on the video taken with Scofield's camera phone is unclear, the FBI agent Donald Self recognizes one of the cardholders. Michael has Agent Self run high-resolution identity searches on the three unknown cardholders, while attempting to copy the next card. At the same time, he orders Sucre and Bellick to canvas Los Angeles for T-Bag, who is somewhere in the city with Whistler's bird book that contains the plan to break into the Company headquarters. Meanwhile, Sara Tancredi, upon discovering she has lost Bruce Bennett's credit card, realizes she is being followed. She makes a run for it and manages to elude Wyatt, the Company's assassin. Agent Self, by making up a story about Al-Qaeda using stolen bearer bonds, manages to barge into the cardholder's office in the Treasury Department. Unfortunately, he discovers that the card is inside the holder's office wall safe, which blocks the copying device and prevents the card from being copied. After losing Sara, Wyatt visits the imprisoned Gretchen Morgan, whom despite repeated torture and a starvation diet has managed to resist. Wyatt proceeds to slowly suffocate and nauseate Gretchen by putting a tape over her mouth and leaving a bucket of urine and body parts in the room. Later, Gretchen kills her guard by stabbing him in the temple with a screw removed from the chair she was tied to and escapes. Mahone obtains a picture of Wyatt, who killed his son. He meets with his estranged wife, Pam, who recognizes the photo of Wyatt among others. She makes him promise to hunt down and kill their son's murderer, and gives him a gun. Sucre and Bellick arrive at GATE, and ask for T-Bag who is masquerading there as Cole Pfeiffer, Whistler's fabricated persona. The receptionist, intending to blackmail T-Bag, lies to the duo. After they leave, T-Bag agrees to pay the receptionist three percent of his commissions. Scofield has come up with a plan to break into one of the most protected buildings in the world and copy the card. The occupant of the room adjacent to the card holder's is led out of the building by Agent Self, who has arranged a lunch meeting. Sucre and Bellick, disguised as janitors, performs vacuum cleaning outside the room, effectively blocking entry and covering any noise from the room. Scofield and Lincoln break into the room via air vents and drill through both the wall and the back of the safe in the next room. During the break-in, Lincoln discovers Scofield's nosebleed. Scofield brushes it off and asks Lincoln not to tell Sara, but Lincoln seems worried. The two successfully drill through the wall into the safe, when the \\"General\\" unexpectedly shows up in the card holder's room. Paranoid after recent events, he demands to see the card, but Michael manages to copy and replace the card and gets the wall back up just before the safe is opened. Mahone has managed to find the motel where Wyatt is staying. Wyatt, already anticipating this since Sara escaped him, has hired the motel clerk to mislead any would-be followers and alert him immediately. The clerk, as per his orders, lies to Mahone that Wyatt has already checked out. When he calls Wyatt, however, Mahone suddenly appears behind him with a gun. Terrified, the clerk tells Wyatt that nobody has appeared. Mahone then takes Wyatt's number from the clerk. The high-resolution identity scans have returned. Two of the three cardholders are identified, along with their locations, but the third, the General himself, is a complete ghost — no records of his identity, past, or location exists in the database. Sara, however, recalls hearing Gretchen reporting to a 'General' when she was in Gretchen's captivity. Meanwhile, the General and Wyatt discuss what to do about the escaped Gretchen, when a Company agent alerts them that someone called Agent Self has attempted to identify the general from the database. == Reception == IGN gave the episode 8.8/10 saying that the episode is \\"Filled with some fantastic dramatic tension\\" and that through this episode the season is \\"finally moving forward with some much required plot advances\\" which point the show in the right direction. ==ReferencesCategory:Prison Break episodes Category:2008 American television episodes ","title":"Safe &amp; Sound (Prison Break)"},{"id":"19231506","text":"Hydroelectricity in Romania is the second most important source of electricity generation in Romania, after the fossil fuels. { style=\\"text-align: right\\"  +Hydroelectric production in Romania (TWh)\\"International Energy Annual (IEA) - long-term historical international energy statistics\\" - !

According to its own website, ASIC has accredited 148 colleges and universities in the UK, and around 80 worldwide, of which 15 are US-based institutions. The legitimacy of ASIC's international accreditation service is unclear and some of its internationally-accredited institutions have been deemed 'diploma mills' offering worthless qualifications, notably Atlantic International University.https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/t6myg/my_kenyan_friend_nearly_got_duped_into_paying/http://www.guardian.co.tt/article-6.2.394176.ef1f6846f7https://www.geteducated.com/diploma- mill-police/degree-mills-list/http://www.credentialconsultants.com/wp- content/uploads/2014/11/Bogus-Institution-List-Glen- Wood-2010.pdfhttps://www.scholaro.com/unaccredited-universities/ == Notable affiliations == ASIC is approved by the United Kingdom Government's Home Office to accredit private UK colleges for visa purposes.

The article stated that the newspaper had \\"established that the Home Office received, and ignored, concerns about ASIC and Mr Dimmock before it granted the company a contract. Northumbria University wrote to the UK Home Office in May 2007 to question the role the company was about to be given in distinguishing between genuine and bogus colleges.\\" Universities UK, the advocacy group for British Universities, complained to the UK Immigration Minister concerning ASIC being given an accreditation role in the UK immigration scheme. In a letter to the Home Affairs Committee, Advocacy UK wrote: \\"There is a lack of information and transparency about (ASIC's) management, governance and financial structures. Several of the colleges that it accredits have been associated with inappropriate activities.\\" The government response to this was a statement that the 2007 decision was made on the basis of the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills's report that they were satisfied with the way ASIC was operating. ASIC responded to the allegations concerning its work of distinguishing between genuine colleges and those acting fraudulently had been hampered \\"by the Home Office’s refusal to tell ASIC how many student visas were issued for each college it inspects.\\" In July 2009, ASIC submitted a response memorandum providing answers to the letter written by Diana Warwick, Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe, Chief Executive of Universities UK in which she had expressed concerns about the government's decision to approve the ASIC as one of the accreditation bodies within the new immigration system.

Mitić is an overweight 48-year-old man who is in an Oedipus kind of way connected to his aging mother. His mother often punishes him when he does not sell any of the carnation flowers. His punishments include kneeling on nutshells while being slapped by his mother or being locked in the water tank. This is the reason why he starts killing every girl who refuses to buy his flowers. Mitić's character can be compared to Norman Bates's character and relationship with his mother. After the first murder, mostly incompetent inspector Ognjen Strahinjić (Nikola Simić) starts the investigation. His attempt to catch the strangler by employing an undercover agent, Rodoljub Jovanović (Branislav Zeremski), ends up tragically. Strahinjić is a loner who lives only with his cat George, who is his best friend. He is a short man, with a thin mustache and is similar to Inspector Clouseau from the Blake Edwards's The Pink Panther series. The plot becomes even more complicated when a rock star Spiridon Kopicl (Srđan Šaper) obsessed with the strangler records the song \\"Bejbi, bejbi\\" (\\"Baby, Baby\\"), with his band VIS Simboli, dedicated to the strangler, which immediately becomes a nationwide hit. Mitić, having heard the song, becomes delighted; he even strangled his own mother in order to hear it on the TV. While Mitić's number of victims becomes bigger, Kopicl is focused on Sofija (Sonja Savić) who is a host of a popular musical show on the radio. While attempting to strangle Sofija, Mitić gets on his way and while attacking her Sofija bites his ear in self-defence. Kopicl gets the credit of a savior and a hero and marries Sofija. On their honeymoon, in the climax of his obsession, Kopicl strangles Sofija while Mitić, dressed as his mother, observes. Mitić then enters the room and asks for his ear. Kopicl runs to an abandoned building where, after a struggle, hangs Mitić who bit his ear. In the end all of the crimes, including Sofija's death, are credited to the late Mitić. Kopicl, while getting his ear bitten hears a melody on which he composed a symphony inspired by the crime and, after the death of his father, marries his attractive stepmother. ==Cast== *Taško Načić as Pera Mitić *Nikola Simić as Inspector Ognjen Strahinjić *Srđan Šaper as Spiridon Kopicl *Rahela Ferari as Pera's mother *Sonja Savić as Sofija Mačkić *Radmila Savićević as Mica Mojsilović, an eye witness *María Baxa as Natalija *Pavle Minčić as Dr. Dobrica Kopicl, Spiridon's father *Žika Milenković as Inspector Gane *Branislav Zeremski as Rodoljub Jovanović *Dragana Ćirić as a girl *Dijana Sporčić as Evgenija Poslisković *Jelisaveta Sablić as Miss Dobrila Skara *Đorđe Nenadović as Impressio Oskar (as George Heston) *Dobrica Jovanović as Sofija's father *Velibor Miljković as a punk ==External links and references== * * Movie critique (Serbian source).

As an important personality in the Slovenian and Yugoslav rock scene, Vidmar worked with many artists, most of them having a cult status in the underground music scene, especially the punk rock of Slovenia and the former SFR Yugoslavia, such as the Yugoslav punk rock pioneers Pankrti and Paraf, the internationally acclaimed Laibach and many others. The tracks for the famous Yugoslav compilation album Novi Punk Val were compiled by him. He also worked in the only independent student radio existing in a communist country- Radio Student Ljubljana. As a concert organizer, he established the important Novi Rock festival, and brought numerous eminent international acts to Slovenia and/or Yugoslavia, including: 23 Skidoo, Amebix, Angelic Upstarts, Anti-Nowhere League, Christian Death, DOA, Dinosaur Jr., Discharge, Dubliners, Einstürzende Neubauten, The Fall, GBH, Henry Rollins, Iggy Pop, Jane's Addiction, The Jesus & Mary Chain, Killing Joke, The Mission, Nick Cave, Pere Ubu, Pixies, Ramones, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Sisters of Mercy, Sonic Youth, UK Subs, Youth Brigade, Swans and others. He was also active in the famous ŠKUC Art Gallery. His behaviour and his journalistic or artistic works, which were often too avant-garde and politically incorrect for the time (intentionally or unintentionally) provoked reactions from the communist regime of the then-Socialist Republic of Slovenia and SFR Yugoslavia: he lost his membership in the ruling political party- the League of Communists of Slovenia, faced prosecution and even served short prison terms few times. He also criticized the Western imperialism as well. In 1983 he was arrested for wearing the Dead Kennedys Nazi Punks Fuck Off! badge with a crossed out swastika which was mistaken as a pro-nazi symbol. Namely, at that time the Communist authorities were obsessed witch hunting nazi punks, whom Vidmar never belonged to. In the next year, as a retaliation, he \\"tested\\" the authorities' and citizens' nerves by playing Deutschland über alles on the air in his radio show (a version performed by Nico). Although it is not a fascist song, the authorities and some of the listeners saw hidden allusions in his action and reacted. Soon he was on court again with an explanation that he wanted to test the \\"national defense preparement\\" and the reaction of the people against an eventual fascist provocation. In the late 1980s, as the fall of Communism and the subsequent breakup of Yugoslavia were approaching, he supported the Slovenian opposition, human rights and pro-independence movements. In a press interview regarding his work as a musical promoter published in the post-communist and post-Yugoslav period, despite the problems he once had with the previous system, Vidmar was quoted saying: \\"It is an irony that it is harder to work now in this liberal democracy, than in the final 10 years of SFRY's communism\\". The system of the non-aligned SFR Yugoslavia was not so rigid as the other communist states, such as those in the Eastern Bloc for instance, so most of the time the Yugoslav rock scene was left alone to work freely. For example, in 1982, Vidmar organized a concert in support of the independent Polish trade union Solidarity; he also worked with the highly provocative act Laibach, a member of the Neue Slowenische Kunst collective which used totalitarian Nazi art and Socialist Realism for artistic reasons as camp or for stirring controversy etc. ==References== *Interview with Igor Vidmar - Glas Javnosti magazine *Slovenska pomlad project *Interview with Igor Vidmar at Uzurlikzurli e-zine Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Nova Gorica Category:Slovenian journalists Category:Yugoslav journalists Category:Slovenian record producers Category:Yugoslav record producers Category:Slovenian human rights activists Category:Yugoslav human rights activists Category:Slovenian dissidents Category:Yugoslav dissidents Category:Counterculture festivals activists Category:Festival directors Category:Slovenian Spring Category:Music promoters Category:People from Ljubljana ","title":"Igor Vidmar"},{"id":"19231581","text":"Miguel Ángel Llera Garzón (born 7 August 1979) is a Spanish football manager and former professional player who played as a centre back.

After unsuccessfully emerging through local Recreativo de Huelva's youth ranks, he represented several modest clubs until 2005–06, when he contributed with 27 games (scoring three times) to Gimnàstic de Tarragona's return to La Liga after a 56-year absence; midway through the following season, however, he was released from contract after appearing in 12 matches (all starts) for the Catalans and scoring in defeats against Real Sociedad (2–3, away)Real Sociedad 3–2 Gimnastic de Tarragona; ESPN Soccernet, 17 December 2006 and Getafe CF (1–3, home),Gimnastic de Tarragona 1–3 Getafe; ESPN Soccernet, 14 January 2007 as Nàstic were immediately relegated. In 2007–08 Llera continued in Segunda División, but also failed to impress at Hércules CF, playing only 11 games out of a possible 42. ===Milton Keynes Dons=== Subsequently, Llera took his game to England, joining League One side Milton Keynes Dons in September 2008. He scored twice during his spell with the Dons, against Carlisle United and Brighton & Hove Albion. ===Charlton=== After a successful season, with a third-place finish straight out of Football League Two, albeit without eventual promotion, Llera signed for Charlton Athletic on 2 July 2009, after turning down a new contract offer – he became the first Spanish footballer to play for the club. Llera quickly established himself as a fans' favourite after just four matches, scoring on his debut against Wycombe Wanderers but also picking up a head injury which led him to wear a helmet for the next fixtures, similar to that of Chelsea's Petr Čech; he scored his first goal for the Addicks on 22 August 2009, in a 2–0 home win against Walsall. ===Blackpool=== After leaving Charlton at the end of the 2010–11 season, Llera spent some time training with Blackpool and joined them on trial, making his debut against Rangers on 19 July 2011. On 2 August, he scored from a free kick against Lancaster City in a 1–3 defeat, and, two days later, he signed a one-year contract with the option of a further year. ===Brentford / S. Wednesday=== On 7 September 2011, Llera transferred to Brentford on a three-month loan deal.Brentford sign Blair Adams and Miguel Llera on loan; BBC Sport, 8 September 2011 On 22 November he moved to Sheffield Wednesday, in a loan agreement lasting until January 2012. On 10 January 2012, Llera was signed on a permanent deal by Wednesday, having been released by Blackpool.Sheffield Wednesday sign Miguel Llera from Blackpool; BBC Sport, 10 January 2012 On 11 February, in a game against Exeter City, he suffered a head injury in an eventual 1–2 away loss, going on to miss approximately one month of action. ===Scunthorpe=== After impressing on trial, on 21 July 2014 Llera was offered a contract by Oldham Athletic, which was later withdrawn. He eventually moved to League One's Scunthorpe United late in the month, agreeing to a one-year deal also after a trial period. Llera made his competitive debut on 9 August 2014, in a 1–3 defeat at Swindon Town. His first appearance at Glanford Park took place the following weekend, and he scored a 39th minute own goal in 0–4 loss to Preston North End. Llera netted his first and only goal for the Iron on 13 December 2014, contributing to a 2–1 home win over Crewe Alexandra. On 5 May of the following year, it was announced he would not be offered a new contract and was free to leave the club. ==Coaching careerS. Wednesday / Chesterfield=== In July 2014, Llera began coaching the under-14 squad of Sheffield Wednesday. In summer 2015, he started working as a first-team scout. In January 2016, Llera launched his own academy, Miguel Llera International Football Academy, occasionally sending young players for trials at Wednesday. In August 2017, he was appointed Professional Development Phase coach at Chesterfield. On 11 January 2019, Llera left the Proact Stadium by mutual consent. ===Sheffield FC / Hallam University=== Starting in July 2015 and with the duration of one year, Llera was part of the staff at Sheffield FC, acting as assistant manager as well as being responsible for subjects concerning the academy. In September 2015, he became the club's scholarship football coach and also second and third team manager at Sheffield Hallam University; in addition, he held the same position at Meadowhead School Academy Trust. Llera left all of these roles in September 2016. ===Walsall=== A qualified personal trainer who owned a master's degree in sport psychology and coaching, Llera subsequently worked as a primary and secondary physical education fitness coach. On 12 July 2019, he was hired as academy manager at Walsall. ==Club statistics== {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Other !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - San Fernando (loan) 2000–01 Segunda División B 190colspan=\\"2\\"—colspan=\\"2\\"—190 - rowspan=\\"5\\"Alicante 2001–02 Segunda División B 27210colspan=\\"2\\"—282 - 2002–03 Segunda División B 33160colspan=\\"2\\"—391 - 2003–04 Segunda División B 27110colspan=\\"2\\"—281 - 2004–05 Segunda División B 1501011171 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !102!!4!!9!!0!!1!!1!!112!!5 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Gimnàstic 2005–06 Segunda División 27330colspan=\\"2\\"—303 - 2006–07 La Liga 12200colspan=\\"2\\"—122 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !39!!5!!3!!0!!colspan=\\"2\\"—!!42!!5 - Hércules 2007–08 Segunda División 11141colspan=\\"2\\"—152 - Milton Keynes Dons 2008–09 League One 3621010382 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Charlton Athletic 2009–10 League One 2640010274 - 2010–11 League One 1522010182 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !41!!6!!2!!0!!2!!0!!45!!6 - Blackpool 2011–12 Championship 0010colspan=\\"2\\"—10 - Brentford (loan) 2011–12 League One 1111020141 - Sheffield Wednesday (loan) 2011–12 League One 40000040 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Sheffield Wednesday 2011–12 League One 1640000164 - 2012–13 Championship 41650colspan=\\"2\\"—466 - 2013–14 Championship 22031colspan=\\"2\\"—251 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !83!!10!!8!!1!!0!!0!!91!!11 - Scunthorpe United 2014–15 League One 1516020231 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !321!!28!!35!!2!!8!!1!!364!!31 } ==HonoursClub=== Alicante *Segunda División B: 2004–05 Sheffield Wednesday *Football League One runner-up: 2011–12 ===Individual=== *Football League One Player of the Month: April 2012 ==References*Official Football Academy website Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:People from Seville (comarca) Category:Spanish footballers Category:Andalusian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda División players Category:Segunda División B players Category:Tercera División players Category:Atlético Onubense players Category:CD San Fernando players Category:Alicante CF footballers Category:Gimnàstic de Tarragona footballers Category:Hércules CF players Category:English Football League players Category:Milton Keynes Dons F.C. players Category:Charlton Athletic F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Category:Scunthorpe United F.C. players Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. non- playing staff Category:Chesterfield F.C. non-playing staff ","title":"Miguel Llera"},{"id":"19231590","text":"William George Marks (9 April 1915 – 22 January 1998) was an English association football player, who played as a goalkeeper. Born in Figheldean, Wiltshire, Marks started his career at local club Salisbury Corinthians before joining Arsenal as an amateur in March 1936; he turned professional two months later. Marks spent two years on loan at Arsenal's nursery club Margate before returning in May 1938. He played twice for Arsenal before the outbreak of war, but served mainly as understudy to George Swindin and Alex Wilson; however he did play the final two games of the 1938-39 season, his debut coming against Derby County on 29 April 1939. His second and final league appearance in goal for Arsenal was memorable, as it was their 2–0 win over Brentford at Highbury, a match recorded on film for the movie The Arsenal Stadium Mystery. Official football was suspended during the war; Marks served in the Royal Air Force in Northern Ireland, but still found time to play 129 wartime matches for Arsenal and win one Football League War Cup and two Football League South medals, as well as eight wartime caps for England. Once war was over and football resumed, Marks was deemed too old for Arsenal and sold for £5,000 in August 1946 to Blackburn Rovers - at the time a record fee for a keeper. Despite spending ten years with Arsenal, thanks to the war Marks had only two official League appearances to his name. He spent two seasons with Rovers, his career there punctuated by a period out with a jaw injury. He moved to Bristol City in August 1948, but stayed only two months before signing for Reading. There he spent five years before retiring as a player. He went on to be a coach with Reading for two years before quitting the game entirely, and becoming a local government officer in his native Wiltshire. He died in 1998, aged 82. ==References== * * Category:1915 births Category:1998 deaths Category:People from Wiltshire Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:Margate F.C. players Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players Category:Bristol City F.C. players Category:Reading F.C. players Category:Stoke City F.C. wartime guest players Category:England wartime international footballers ","title":"George Marks"},{"id":"19231595","text":"Maximilian Felix Christoph Wilhelm Leopold Reinhold Albert Fürchtegott von Versen (Wurchow, November 30, 1833 - Berlin, October 7, 1893) was a German military officer and nobleman, son of Johann Georg Leopold von Versen and first wife Hulda Wilhelmine Luise Henriette Leopoldine Ottilie von Glasenapp. ==Career== He was a General of Cavalry, Helper at the Orders of the King of Prussia and Commander-General of the III Army Corpss.Costados, Gonçalo de Mesquita da Silveira de Vasconcelos e Sousa, Livraria Esquina, 1.ª Edição, Porto, 1997, N.º 108 In 1866, while he had the rank of Major of Cavalry, he requested to visit the battlefields of Paraguay because of the ferocious resistance presented by the Paraguayans and the \\"admirable strategy\\" of Francisco Solano López during the Paraguayan War.George F.

He was the chief executive of Diageo, the world's largest spirits group, for twelve years between 2000 and 2013. Walsh was criticised in the press for what was seen as his excessive remuneration, but received admiration for his ability to build brands. He spent the majority of his career at Diageo and its precursor Grand Metropolitan. His most notable decision was the acquisition of the Seagram drinks company, which added Captain Morgan rum and Crown Royal Canadian whisky to Diageo's roster of brands. Walsh's tenure in charge of Diageo closely mirrored his behaviour as head of the Pillsbury food business: selling off non-essential assets such as Burger King and aggressively marketing a select number of \\"core\\" brands. He was disciplined regarding prices paid for the acquisition of assets. Towards the end of his Diageo career, he increased the company's exposure to developing markets such as India and China. In February 2014 Walsh became the non-executive chairman of Compass Group, the world's largest catering company. His role as an advisor to Diageo ended in September 2014. ==Early life== Walsh was born in Middleton, and raised in the former mill town of Chadderton, Lancashire, in the North West of England. The only child of Arthur and Anne Walsh, his father was a pipe fitter who later ran a small thermal engineering company, and his mother was a housewife. Walsh believes that he inherited his work ethic from his father, his organisational skills from his mother, and his confidence from both parents, who he has described as \\"strict\\" but \\"loving\\". His great grandfather emigrated from Ireland, hence he bears the common Irish surname of Walsh. Walsh was educated at his local comprehensive, the Royton and Crompton School, followed by Oldham College. He initially aspired to become a fighter pilot after becoming influenced by his \\"hero\\", a mathematics teacher who had been in the Royal Air Force during World War II. Walsh gained his pilot licence, but failed the medical examination to fly fighter jets due to colour blindness. Instead, Walsh took a sandwich degree in accounting and economics at Manchester Polytechnic in 1973, with a work placement at the Co-operative Group's soft drinks operation. He did not enjoy accounting, but reasoned that the skill would provide a good gateway into business. He moved to London to work for International Computers Limited, and later the American Eaton Corporation, a manufacturer of industrial equipment, which he says he learnt a \\"can-do attitude\\". ==CareerGrand Metropolitan=== Walsh joined London-based property and brewing conglomerate Grand Metropolitan (Grand Met) in 1982 as a financial planner and account manager for their brewing division Watney, Mann & Truman. By 1984–5, at his request, he had moved into a sales and marketing role. In 1986 he became the brewing division's chief financial officer (CFO), where he came to the attention of Grand Met's chairman Allen Sheppard after he reformed the financial reporting system. In 1987, Walsh moved to New York to become CFO of Grand Met's 100 property-strong Intercontinental Hotels division. There he was tasked with acquiring properties, but having arrived at the height of what he identified as a real estate bubble, he argued that, \\"at that price we should be selling, not buying\\". Walsh also believed that the hotel group utilised an excessive amount of working capital. In 1988, he helped to negotiate the sale of the chain for $2.3 billion in cash (a price to earnings ratio of 52) to the Saison Group, in what he later described as \\"the deal of the decade\\". Even before the bubble burst, it was suggested that the Japanese company was overpaying for the chain; one analyst described their valuation of Intercontinental as \\"off the chart\\". Saison sold the chain in 1998 for $2.8 billion, having added a further 87 hotels. Following the divestment, Walsh joined Grand Met's US-headquartered food division as CFO. In 1989, Grand Met used the proceeds from the Intercontinental sale to initiate a hostile takeover of Pillsbury, owner of the Green Giant and Häagen-Dazs brands, for $5.7 billion. The Grand Met offer was held by analysts to be a generous one for a struggling company that was under-performing in its industry. Walsh subsequently admitted to overvaluing the Green Giant vegetables division. Grand Met was attempting to diversify, and was attracted to Pillsbury's brands, which they believed held under-exploited potential for international growth. Writing in Businessweek, Mark Maremont accused Pillsbury of being \\"lax\\" in exploiting Häagen-Dazs' potential overseas. Walsh said: > We thought Pillsbury had powerful brands, but it had kind of lost its way. > We felt we could leverage its brands and its technologies. They had under- > resourced their R&D; and done a number of things to make the number, make > the number. Cost reduction is a way of life, but you have to be responsible > about it. You have to protect the seed today because that will be the tree > that bears fruit in the future. I don't think Pillsbury had done that. In January 1992 Walsh was made chief executive of Pillsbury, in addition to his job as CFO of the Grand Met food division. A Star Tribune profile described him as \\"a boy-wonder [with] traits of boldness, curiosity and financial wizardry\\". Walsh identified the various divisions of Pillsbury as poorly integrated and reined in their independence to make them more accountable to head office. He also invested heavily in research and development, technology, IT systems and marketing. Concentrating the company on consumer food, in 1994 he sold the Alpo pet food business to Nestlé for $510 million in cash. In February 1995 he participated in Grand Met's friendly takeover of Pet, Inc., the makers of Old El Paso branded Tex-Mex foods, for $2.6 billion. A number of analysts feared at the time that Grand Met had overpaid for the company, and was taking on too much debt, but Walsh defended the acquisition, arguing, \\"we are paying a fair price for attractive brands\\", adding that he had faith in the continued growth of the Tex-Mex food sector. In October 1995 he joined the Grand Met board of directors and assumed additional responsibility for Grand Met's Paris-based European food operations. In 1996 he was made chairman and president of Pillsbury. Investors Chronicle described Pillsbury as \\"well managed\\" under his leadership. Walsh was credited with re-energising the company, and operating profits grew from $250 million to $660 million between 1992 and 1996. ===Diageo=== In 1997, Grand Met merged with Guinness, a major drinks concern, and the new company was named Diageo. In 1999 Walsh returned to England, and was elected chief operating officer of Diageo in January 2000, and CEO in September 2000. He took over a company that had stagnated since its merger three years earlier, and that The Economist deemed \\"mediocre\\". As head of Diageo he transformed the consumer goods company into a streamlined premium drinks business. Walsh said: > \\"While Diageo had positions in drinks, that leadership was marginal – > capital was not limitless. My view, supported by colleagues on the board, > was that we should focus on where we can be a global leader. We couldn't > aspire to that in food – that slot was taken by the Unilevers and Nestlés > and Krafts of this world – but we could command that position in premium > drinks.\\" Walsh identified drinks as the central Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested that he would have liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says: > We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while > our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you look at > what we paid it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It > was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at > economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal > returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per > cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of > brands. The Seagram deal cemented Diageo's decision to focus on drinks, and strengthened its leadership position in the key US market by adding Captain Morgan rum and Crown Royal Canadian whisky to the company's portfolio of products. Meanwhile, inspired by the success of Smirnoff Ice, Walsh invested heavily in ready to drink products, termed \\"alcopops\\" by the British press. However, with the exception of Smirnoff Ice, none of the new products developed by Diageo was able to establish itself in the marketplace, and the alcopop trend was quickly dubbed a \\"fad\\" by the media. Some of these failures proved costly: Captain Morgan Gold lost £24 million for the company in 2002. In 2005 Diageo acquired the Bushmills Irish whiskey brand and distillery from Pernod Ricard for €295 million. In 2008 Diageo acquired a 50 per cent stake in the Ketel One brand for US$900 million. Walsh received an Honorary Doctorate from Heriot-Watt University in 2009 In 2011, Walsh threatened to move Diageo's headquarters away from the United Kingdom, following the introduction of a 50 per cent income tax rate for high earners. He said: \\"I believe the 50 per cent tax rate will lead to the long-term damage of this nation’s competitive edge.\\" In 2012, Walsh criticised the Cameron government again, suggesting that the London Olympics ought to have been followed up with greater infrastructure spending to tackle unemployment. In May 2013, Walsh announced that he would be stepping down as the chief of Diageo in September, but would stay with the company as an advisor until June 2014 to aid the transition process. ===Reception and appraisal=== Walsh has repeatedly spoken of the need for companies to genuinely be socially responsible. Under Walsh's management, Diageo has been careful to \\"manage for value\\", and to avoid overpaying for assets. According to Nick Goodway of The Independent, Walsh \\"has been canny in allowing others to bid for the really big rivals and then pick up the brands that fall out of those deals cheaply\\". Walsh has been criticised for his decision to exit the Indian spirits market in 2002 by disposing of Gilbey's Green Label, a strategy which he reversed in 2012 with the acquisition of a stake in United Spirits. David Wighton commented in The Times that Diageo's acquisition of United Spirits had seen the company's owner, Vijay Mallya, \\"utterly outmanoeuvred by a canny rival prepared to play the long game.\\" William Hopper, a former director of merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, described Walsh as a \\"bean counter\\", and criticised the size of his salary. In 2012, one leading Diageo shareholder said, \\"We have a very, very positive view of this company and Paul Walsh as well. We do not have a problem with [his] pay.\\" ===Other responsibilities=== In addition to his responsibilities at Diageo, Walsh has been a non-executive director at FedEx Corporation since 1996, at Unilever since 2009, and at Avanti Communications since 2012. From 1991 - 2007 he was a non-executive director of Control Data Corporation and its successor company Ceridian. He sat on the board of General Mills from 2000 until 2004, stepping down after Diageo reduced its stake in the company. He was a non- executive director of the energy company Centrica from March 2003 until May 2009. He is former chairman of the governors at Henley Management College. He became a council member of the Scotch Whisky Association in 2001 and served as its chairman from 2008 until 2011. During 2012 he was a member of David Cameron's Business Advisory Group. In August 2013, Walsh joined the United Spirits board. ==Personal life== Walsh was described by Philippe Naughton in The Times as \\"tall, paunchy, balding and thickset...[with] a burly confidence that exudes from every pore...a bluff Mancunian whose blokeish humour masks a fiercely competitive nature\\". Walsh claims to lead a \\"relatively modest\\" life that is dominated by work. At Diageo, he spent around half of his time in various foreign countries, totalling over 5 million air miles. Walsh met Manchester-born Nicolette (Nikki) in London in 1978. They married in 1980 and have a son, Dean Paul Walsh. They separated in 2006. In October 2012 it was reported that Walsh was engaged to marry his longterm girlfriend Julie Lewis, a public relations executive, and they married in May 2013. Walsh is one of the highest-paid businessmen in Britain, earning £11.2 million between June 2011 and June 2012 from his work at Diageo. He lives near Horsham in West Sussex.

Civera, Jr. (born June 19, 1946) is an American politician from Pennsylvania. A Republican, he served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 164th District (1980-2010) and Delaware County Council (2010-2017). ==Career== Prior to his election to the House, Civera served on the Upper Darby Board of Commissioners. While serving on the Upper Darby Township Council, he was also chairman of the Public Safety Committee. On March 11, 1980, Civera won election to the House in a special election to replace Frank Lynch, who had resigned in January 1980. He has won re-election to each succeeding session of the House. Civera did not run for reelection in 2010. ===Dual office controversy=== In November 2009, Civera was elected to the Delaware County Council and was sworn into office on January 4, 2010. However, controversy arose when Civera would not resign from his state House seat and thus is holding both offices. During his county council campaign, Civera said he would step down from the House, but after the election said he had no plans to leave, saying he wanted to stay in Harrisburg to complete work on a table games bill needed to finalize the 2009 budget and tie up some other loose ends. He also pointed out that he had never given a definitive date for his resignation. Democrats would like Civera to resign by March so a special election could take place in the May primary at the same time a competitive primary race for a state Senate seat is expected to drive up Democratic voter turnout, hence Civera's assertion that Democrats \\"want to steal the election.\\" Governor Ed Rendell asked Civera to stay to work on the 2010 budget, but has now said he believes Civera should resign, saying, \\"I thought that Mario Civera might be helpful in this year's budget process, but given his votes on table games where he voted against filling a $250 million hole in the budget, it's pretty apparent that there are other things at play rather than his desire to help the budget, so I think he should just resign, go do the job he was elected to do here locally and then let the speaker of the House, as is his legal power, set the special election.\\"Alex Rose, \\"Lentz, Civera continue feud\\", Delaware County Daily and Sunday Times, January 23, 2010Alex Rose, \\"Guv says Civera should resign, make room for special election\\", Delaware County Daily and Sunday Times, January 14, 2010 ==Personal== Civera lives with his wife in Delaware County.

According to an old superstition, the number of magpies seen tells if one will have bad or good luck. ==Lyrics== There is considerable variation in the lyrics used. A common modern version follows: ==Origins== birth of Jesus, perhaps presaging sorrow for Mary: Piero della Francesca's The Nativity The rhyme has its origins in superstitions connected with magpies, considered a bird of ill omen in some cultures, and in Britain, at least as far back as the early sixteenth century.I. Opie and M. Tatem, eds, A Dictionary of Superstitions (Oxford University Press, 1989), pp. 235-6. The rhyme was first recorded around 1780 in a note in John Brand's Observations on Popular Antiquities on Lincolnshire with the lyric: One of the earliest versions to extend this was published, with variations, in Michael Aislabie Denham's Proverbs and Popular Saying of the Seasons (London, 1846) On occasion, jackdaws, crows and other Corvidae are associated with the rhyme, particularly in America where magpies are less common.J. M. Marzluff, A. Angell, P. R. Ehrlich, In the Company of Crows and Ravens (Yale University Press, 2007), p. 127. A version of the rhyme became familiar to many UK children when it became the theme tune of the children's TV show Magpie, which ran from 1968 to 1980. The popularity of this version is thought to have displaced the many regional versions that had previously existed.Terry Pratchett and Jacqueline Simpson, The Folklore of Discworld (London: Random House, 2010), , p. 449. ==NotesReferences== * * Category:English nursery rhymes Category:English folk songs Category:English children's songs Category:Traditional children's songs Category:Songs about birds Category:Birds in mythology Category:Roud Folk Song Index songs ","title":"One for Sorrow (nursery rhyme)"},{"id":"19231786","text":"Ñorquincó is a department in Río Negro Province, Argentina. ==External links== * Provincial website Category:Departments of Río Negro Province ","title":"Ñorquincó Department"},{"id":"19231801","text":"David S. Reynolds (born 1948) is an American literary critic, biographer, and historian who has written about American literature and culture. He is the author or editor of fifteen books, on the Civil War era—including figures such as Walt Whitman, Abraham Lincoln, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Emily Dickinson, Harriet Beecher Stowe, George Lippard, and John Brown. Reynolds has been awarded the Bancroft Prize, the Christian Gauss Award, the Ambassador Book Award, the Gustavus Myers Book Award, the John Hope Franklin Prize (Honorable Mention), and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. He is a regular reviewer for the New York Times Book Review. ==Early life and education== Reynolds was born in Providence, Rhode Island on August 30, 1948, and was raised nearby in Barrington, located near Narragansett Bay. He attended the Moses Brown School and the Providence Country Day School before moving on to Amherst College, where he received a B. A. in 1970. After teaching high school English at the Providence Country Day School for a year, he pursued his graduate studies in American literature and American Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was awarded his Ph.D. in 1979. ==Teaching career== Reynolds has taught American literature and American Studies at Northwestern University, Barnard College, Rutgers University-Camden, New York University, Baruch College, and the Sorbonne Nouvelle-Paris III. Since 2006, he has been a Distinguished Professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. ==Writings and influenceCultural Biography=== Reynolds is a proponent of cultural biography, contextualizing historical figures in their era. He was influenced by the “representative men” theory of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who writes, “the ideas of the time are in the air, and infect all who breathe it… We learn of our contemporaries what they know without effort, and almost through the pores of our skin.”Ralph Waldo Emerson, Essays and Lectures (New York: Library of America, 1983), 627. In Abe: Abraham Lincoln in His Times Reynolds challenges the usual view of Lincoln as the quintessential self-made man who arose, without education or guidance, from a crude background and a barren American culture that offered few nurturing materials. Instead, Reynolds shows, Lincoln learned a lot from a rich, teeming cultural environment that he absorbed and rechanneled in his brilliant presidency and his immortal speeches. Reynolds argues in John Brown, Abolitionist that Brown was not an isolated, crazed antislavery terrorist but rather an amalgam of social currents—religious, racial, reformist, political—that found explosive realization in him. In Walt Whitman’s America: A Cultural Biography, Reynolds takes seriously Whitman’s declarations that he was “the age transfigured” and that “in estimating my volumes, the world’s current times and deeds, and their spirit, must first be profoundly estimated.”Whitman, Poetry and Prose (New York: Library of America, 1996), 23; Whitman, Prose Works, 1872, edited by Floyd Stovall (New York: New York University Press, 1964), II: 473. Reynolds writes that Whitman’s growing alarm over political controversies, corruption, and class division led him to try to heal his nation through his poetry, which absorbed images from many aspects of social and cultural life, including religion, science, city life, theater, oratory, photography, painting, reform movements, and sexual mores. ===American history=== Reynolds highlights the intersection of politics and culture consistent with Lincoln’s view that “public sentiment is everything. He who molds public sentiment is greater than he who makes statutes,”The Lincoln-Douglas Debates, edited by Harold Holzer (New York: Fordham University Press, 2004), 75. Reynolds includes in books like John Brown, Abolitionist, Mightier than the Sword: Uncle Tom’s Cabin and the Battle for America, and Waking Giant: America in the Age of Jackson political and social leaders, artists, musicians, reformers, scientists, artists, ministers, and self-styled religious prophets who shaped American history. In Mightier than the Sword: Uncle Tom’s Cabin and the Battle for America, he traces the impact of Harriet Beecher Stowe’s 1852 best-seller Uncle Tom’s Cabin on the rise of Lincoln, the American Civil War, and worldwide events, including the end of serfdom in Russia, down to its influence on race relations and popular culture in the twentieth century. ===Literary criticism=== Reynolds debunks the once- prevalent view—introduced by the New Critics and later promoted by the deconstructionists and other theorists—that literature is divorced from the author's life and contexts. His reconstruction of the cultural and social contexts of literature began with his book Faith in Fiction: The Emergence of Religious Literature in America, which explores some 250 writers from Puritan times through the late 19th century. In Beneath the American Renaissance: The Subversive Imagination in the Age of Emerson and Melville, Reynolds leverages the title of F.O. Matthiessen's best known work and expands his thesis. Here Reynolds combines elements of New Historicism and cultural studies with archival research to show that great literature is characterized by its radical openness to biographical, political, social, and cultural images, which certain responsive writers adopted and transformed, yielding such symbols as Melville's white whale, Hawthorne's scarlet letter, Poe's raven, and Whitman's grass leaves. Contesting the standard interpretation of America's great writers as marginal figures in a sentimental, proper society, Reynolds reveals that they were instead immersed in a culture that was frequently sensational, subversive, or erotic, epitomized by popular novels about city mysteries, such as the lurid best-seller The Quaker City, or The Monks of Monk Hall by the Philadelphia writer George Lippard (the subject of two other booksDavid S. Reynolds, George Lippard (Boston: Twayne, 1982) and George Lippard, Prophet of Protest: Writings of an American Radical, 1822–1854 (New York: Peter Lang, 1986) by Reynolds). ==Family== Reynolds’s wife, whose professional name is Suzanne Nalbantian, is a Professor of Comparative Literature at Long Island University and specializes in the interdisciplinary relationship between literature and neuroscience. Her six books include Memory in Literature: From Rousseau to Neuroscience, The Memory Process: Neuroscientific and Humanistic Perspectives (coedited with Paul M. Matthews and James B. McClelland), and Aesthetic Autobiography: From Life to Art in the Marcel Proust, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf and Anais Nin. ==Awards and honors== * Bancroft Prize, for Walt Whitman's America * Ambassador Book Award, for Walt Whitman's America * National Book Critics Circle Award finalist, for Walt Whitman's America * Christian Gauss Award (Phi Beta Kappa Society), for Beneath the American Renaissance * Gustavus Myers Book Award, for John Brown, Abolitionist * Kansas Notable Book, for John Brown, Abolitionist * Notable Books of the Year, New York Times Book Review, for Beneath the American Renaissance, Walt Whitman's America, and Waking Giant: America in the Age of Jackson * Best Books of the Year, Washington Post, for Waking Giant: America in the Age of Jackson * A New Yorker Favorite Book of the Year, for Mightier than the Sword: Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Battle for America * Best Books of the Year, Kirkus Reviews, for Mightier than the Sword: Uncle Tom’s Cabin and the Battle for America * John Hope Franklin Publication Prize, Honorable Mention, American Studies Association, for Beneath the American Renaissance * Who’s Who in America (2000 edition to the present), Who's Who in the World (2000 edition to the present) * Selected as Honorary Co-chair of the New-York Historical Society, 2009–present * Fellow, Society of American Historians (honorary elected position), 1997–present * Fellow, American Antiquarian Society (honorary elected position), 1996–present ==BibliographyBooks=== * Abe: Abraham Lincoln in His Times. * Mightier Than the Sword: Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Battle for America. * Waking Giant: America in the Age of Jackson. * John Brown Abolitionist: The Man Who Killed Slavery, Sparked the Civil War, and Seeded Civil Rights. * Walt Whitman's America: A Cultural Biography. * Beneath the American Renaissance: The Subversive Imagination in the Age of Emerson and Melville. * Walt Whitman. * George Lippard. * Faith in Fiction: The Emergence of Religious Literature in America. ===Books (editor)=== * Lincoln's Selected Writings: A Norton Critical Edition. * Uncle Tom’s Cabin, or, Life Among the Lowly [The Splendid Edition], by Harriet Beecher Stowe. * A Historical Guide to Walt Whitman. * Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, 150th Anniversary Edition. * George Lippard, Prophet of Protest: Writings of an American Radical, 1822–1854. * The Quaker City, or The Monks of Monk Hall, by George Lippard. * Venus in Boston and Other Tales of 19th Century City Life, by George Thompson (coedited with Kimberly Gladman). * The Serpent in the Cup: Temperance in American Literature (coedited with Debra J.

It goes round the Borovan hill from the west and runs through a shallow gorge near Ohoden. From that point on, it has low banks and mostly flows through plain terrain with a number of meanders. The Skat is 510 metres wide, with a sand-covered bed. Its valley is asymmetrical, as the right bank is normally steeper than the left one. Before the construction of the atomic power station in Kozlodui the Skat flew into Danube directly.

In May 1968, after only six days on station, she and scientists from the Naval Oceanographic Office located an ammunition-laden Liberty ship sunk in the North Pacific. In 1972, she visited Japan, for the 2nd annual Ocean Development Conference held at Tokyo. During the conference, there were numerous tours and briefings held on Silas Bent describing, for the ocean scientists of the world, her capabilities for measuring bathymetric depth, magnetic intensity, gravity, surface temperature, seismic reflection, sound velocity, ambient light, and salinity.

Celebrated on September 11, the day is both the start of the Coptic new year and its first month, Thout. The Feast of Nayrouz marks the first day of the Coptic year. Multiple theories have been proposed for the origin of the word. One popular theory, repeated on many Websites, is that the word is Coptic in origin: Ignorant of the Coptic language for the most part, the Arabs confused the Coptic new year's celebrations, which the Copts called the feast of Ni-Iarōou (Bohairic lit. the feast of the rivers), with the Persian feast of Nowruz, from which the word Nayrouz etymologically comes. The misnomer remains today, and the celebrations of the Coptic new year on the first day of the month of Thout are known as the Nayrouz. Others dispute this view, and hold that the word is fully Persian. They note that the word Nayrouz does not occur anywhere in the Synaxarium, that there is no evidence of the use of the supposed Coptic etymon in historical sources, and that a Persian etymology sufficiently explains the current name. The recorded Bohairic name for the new year was pi-klhom inte-tirompi, \\"the crown of the year.\\" During the reign of Khosrow II (590–628), the Persians reached Egypt for the second time in history, and established control for a decade (Sasanian Egypt). According to Touraj Daryaee, the celebration of Nayrouz in Egypt may be one of the lasting Sasanid influences in Egypt. Its celebration falls on the 1st day of the month of Thout, the first month of the Egyptian year, which for AD 1901 to 2098 usually coincides with 11 September, except before a Gregorian leap year when it begins September 12. ==The Coptic year== The chronology of the Coptic Orthodox Church begins when Diocletian became Roman emperor in 284 AD. His reign was marked by torture of Christians to force them to deny their faith, as well as by mass executions, especially in Egypt. It is believed this time was one of the worst times that the Coptic church faced, known to believers as \\"the martyrdom era\\". Hence, the Coptic year is identified by the abbreviation A.M. (for Anno Martyrum or \\"Year of the Martyrs\\"). It should not be confused with the A.M. abbreviation used for the unrelated Jewish year, which is Anno Mundi (\\"year of the world\\"). ==See also== * Coptic Calendar * Copts * Coptic Orthodox Church * Sasanian Egypt ==ReferencesSources== * Category:Coptic Orthodox Church Category:September observances Category:Christian festivals and holy days Category:New Year celebrations Category:Observances honoring the dead Category:Christian martyrs Category:Sasanian Egypt ","title":"Nayrouz"},{"id":"19231896","text":"A pier is a raised walkway over water, supported by widely spread piles or pillars.

Around 1765, the joiner Jacques Belhomme took on the construction of a building for the son of a neighbour, an aristocrat who had been mad since birth. Seeing that running an asylum was more lucrative than joinery, he opened an asylum for lunatics, old people and whoever else rich families wanted to entrust to him. A famous precursor of psychiatry, Philippe Pinel, carried out his first treatments of the insane here. Once the French Revolution had begun, Jacques Belhomme thought that his fortune was assured. Remote from the violent centre of Paris, he had noticeable advantages. In September 1793 the députés encouraged the sans-culottes to imprison all suspect individuals: nobles, their wives and children, foreigners, priests, lawyers, the actors of the Comédie Française, rich people in general, in short, all those who had not made clear their allegiance to the Republic. With the prisons of Paris already overflowing, the state requisitioned Belhomme's asylum and then all other private clinics. Belhomme entreated the 12 police chiefs in charge of Paris to send him rich prisoners who would pay high fees to live in his asylum as comfortably as possible. From then on marquises, bankers, journalists, famous actors, old nobles and army officers, along with other disgraced persons who bribed the doctors and police chiefs to be transferred on the pretext of illness, lived cheek by jowl with the mad. Belhomme rented the neighbouring building, the hôtel de Chabanais, to which he linked his own building by a charming garden after the young marquis de Chabanais, a descendant of Colbert, had emigrated with his mother and had his possessions confiscated by the state. Belhomme ended up buying the house to invest the money he had made. It was in this setting that there occurred the romance between Jacques-Marie Rouzet, a deputy to the National Convention, and Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon, widow of the Duc d’Orléans and mother of the future King Louis-Philippe. They married in secret after leaving prison. The scandal of the Pension Belhomme finally erupted in January 1794. Belhomme was arrested for supplying wine to the inmates and was imprisoned in another pension, at Coignard, where the Marquis de Sade was also held. He was found guilty twice and, like the majority of the former inmates of his \\"clinic\\", escaped the guillotine only because the Terror ended on 9 Thermidor. Some of the former inmates did not escape, however, proving too well-known to pass unnoticed. They included Béatrice de Choiseul-Stainville, duchesse de Gramont, sister of Louis XV's famous minister; the duchess of Le Châtelet, daughter-in- law of a famous mistress of Voltaire,Both to be seen in the film by Rohmer, l'Anglaise et le Duc. the fermier général Magon de La Balue, guillotined with his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, brothers and cousins; and the lawyer Simon-Nicholas Henri Linguet, despite his denunciation of the monarchy, for which he had spent a year in the Bastille under the ancien regime.

Paul W. Garrett and Austin H. MacCormick, 1929. and relocated to Warren in 2002.American Correctional Association 2003 Directory This maximum-security prison has a capacity of 916 adult male inmates with an average daily population of 900. ==History== In 1824, only four years after Maine broke off from Massachusetts and became its own state, the state legislature established the Maine State Prison in Thomaston (). The original layout of the prison \\"had underground cells—deep holes into which prisoners were lowered each night and brought up in the daytime to labor in the stone quarry on the prison property\\". In 1923 the prison was destroyed by a fire in which many inmates died. The old prison was replaced by a facility with two cellblocks. The cells were modeled on the Auburn System. There were long narrow hallways with very small cells— each. The 1923 prison was very modern for the time and most things were performed by technology, like the locking and unlocking of doors. The Maine State Prison had a farm several miles away where select prisoners worked. Most produce was used by the prison and not for sale. Other prisoners worked in carriage shops, harness shops, and in maintenance. In the summer of 1927 there were 197 white prisoners, three African American prisoners, and one prisoner of another race. The Maine state prison housed few females, who worked sewing and patching clothing. The women were relocated to the Women's Correctional Center in Skowhegan, Maine in 1935. ===New location=== The old Maine State Prison in Thomaston was moved to a new, larger prison in Warren in February 2002 because of the growing prisoner population. Some residents in Thomaston objected to the relocation of the prison out of their town, because it was a part of their history and local economy. The prison that was founded 178 years ago was razed in the summer of 2002. The site of the prison in Thomaston is now a field. ==Incidents== * In 1998, Michael Chasse was arrested for breaking into the home of Robert Cohen, the brother of former Maine Senator William Cohen. As Chasse was being escorted to his trial for the break-in, he threw a white powdery substance into the guards’ faces and ran off, but was caught five hours later. * On November 11, 2005, Portland Phoenix newspaper began an exposé series detailing the prison's alleged misuse of forcible extraction techniques and restraint chairs. Following a wave of public criticism, Corrections Commissioner Warren Magnusson promised to \\"de-escalate\\" use of the restraint chair, and asked the US Department of Justice's National Institute of Corrections to review the management of Maine Supermax. * On June 30, 2008, Chasse, by then a prisoner of the Maine State Prison, took another prisoner and a staff member hostage. Chasse had what appeared to be a knife taped to his hand. After a seven-hour stand off, the two hostages were released with minor cuts. On November 3, 2011 Michael Chasse died while at the New Jersey State Prison, where he had been sent since Maine could no longer hold him in the prison due to his behavior. * Gary Watland, a prisoner at the Maine State Prison serving a 25-year sentence for murder, devised a plan to have his wife, Susan Watland, bring a gun into the prison with the intent of taking hostages. Another prisoner alerted staff. On October 24, 2006 Susan Watland entered the prison with a loaded pistol but was apprehended by officials before any shots were fired.http://www.10news.com/news/10158110/detail.html She was arrested and later sentenced to three years in prison with credit for time served, probation, and a fine. She has since been released. Gary Watland has since been transferred to the Federal Supermax Prison, ADX Florence. ==Special Management Unit== The Special Management Unit (SMU) is a restrictive housing unit that houses prisoners who are threats to themselves or others, are escape risks, or violate institutional rules, such as fighting or having weapons or other contraband, or are in need of protection. Most prisoners in the SMU are on 23-hour lockdown. They receive one hour a day exercise in a recreation yard and most services, such as meals and medication, are brought to them in their cells. Prisoners who behave in such a way as to constitute a danger to themselves or others can be restrained with force, including use of chemical restraints (mace), placed in security smock/bedding, and put on a constant observation status until mental health staff determines that the prisoner is safe. If extremely agitated, they can be placed for short periods of time in a restraint chair only until they regain control of their behavior and are assessed by mental health staff. ==Prison management== The Maine State prison is the only prison in Maine that can legally use the unit management system. A team of staff for each housing unit meets periodically to talk about the needs of each prisoner, determine their custody level, and set goals for each prisoner to reach. Education programs are available to inmates including GED prep, typing, English, horticulture, science, and college prep math. College courses are also available for prisoners. Prisoners placed in the SMU have access to educational, mental health, and other programs in-cell. == See also == * Maine Department of Corrections ==Notes== * * Category:Buildings and structures in Thomaston, Maine Category:Prisons in Maine Category:Warren, Maine Category:2002 establishments in Maine ","title":"Maine State Prison"},{"id":"19232015","text":"French India Company may refer to: * French East India Company * French West India Company ","title":"French India Company"},{"id":"19232018","text":"Kari Sørheim (born 12 October 1948) is a Norwegian politician for the Christian Democratic Party.

One of the primary motivating factors behind his decision to create ACHRE was a step taken by his newly-appointed Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary, one of whose first actions on taking the helm of the United States Department of Energy was to announce a new openness policy for the Department. The new policy led almost immediately to the release of over 1.6 million pages of classified records. These records made clear that since the 1940s, the Atomic Energy Commission had been sponsoring tests on the effects of radiation on the human body. American citizens who had checked into hospitals for a variety of ailments were secretly injected, without their knowledge, with varying amounts of plutonium and other radioactive materials. Ebb Cade was an unwilling participant in medical experiments that involved injection of 4.7 micrograms of plutonium on 10 April 1945 at Oak Ridge, Tennessee.Moss, William, and Roger Eckhardt. (1995). \\"The human plutonium injection experiments.\\" Los Alamos Science. 23: 177-233.Openness, DOE. (June 1998). Human Radiation Experiments: ACHRE Report.

This experiment was under the supervision of Harold Hodge.AEC no. UR-38, 1948 Quarterly Technical Report Most patients thought it was \\"just another injection,\\" but the secret studies left enough radioactive material in many of the patients' bodies to induce life-threatening conditions. Such experiments were not limited to hospital patients, but included other populations such as those set out above, e.g., orphans fed irradiated milk, children injected with radioactive materials, prisoners in Washington and Oregon state prisons. Much of the experimentation was carried out in order to assess how the human body metabolizes radioactive materials, information that could be used by the Departments of Energy and Defense in Cold War defense and attack planning. ACHRE's final report was also a factor in the Department of Energy establishing an Office of Human Radiation Experiments (OHRE) that assured publication of DOE’s involvement, by way of its predecessor, the AEC, in Cold War radiation research and experimentation on human subjects. The final report issued by the ACHRE can be found at the Department of Energy's website. ==Soviet Union== The Soviet nuclear program involved human experiments on a large scale, including most notably the Totskoye nuclear exercise of 1954 and the experiments conducted at the Semipalatinsk Test Site (1949-1989). As of 1950, there were around 700,000 participants at different levels of the program, half of whom were Gulag prisoners used for radioactivity experiments, as well as the excavation of radioactive ores. Information about the scale, conditions and lethality of those involved in the program is still kept secret by the Russian regime and the Rosatom agency. == Other countries == In the Marshall Islands, indigenous residents and crewmembers of the fishing boat Lucky Dragon No. 5 were exposed to the high yields of radioactive testing during the Castle Bravo explosions conducted at Bikini Atoll. Researchers subsequently exploited this ostensibly \\"unexpected\\" turn of events by conducting research on the onset of effects from radiation poisoning as part of Project 4.1, raising ethical questions as to both the specific incident and the broader phenomenon of testing in populated areas. Likewise, the Venezuelan geneticist Marcel Roche was implicated in Patrick Tierney's 2000 publication, Darkness in El Dorado, for allegedly administering radioactive iodine to indigenous peoples in the Orinoco basin of Venezuela, such as the Yanomami and Ye'Kwana peoples, in cooperation with the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), possibly with no apparent benefit for the test group and without obtaining proper informed consent. This corresponded to similar administrations of iodine-124 by the French anthropologist Jacques Lizot in cooperation with the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).http://anthroniche.com/darkness_documents/0352.htmhttp://anthroniche.com/darkness_documents/0470.htm ==See also== *Unethical human experimentation in the United States *Project SUNSHINE *Nuclear and radiation accidents *Radiation poisoning *Radioactive contamination *Human experimentation *Totskoye range nuclear tests *Walter E.

Specifically, the court lacks a line dividing the service courts that is two inches wide and twenty- one feet long, and within the rules of tennis, this line is considered to be a part of both service zones. During play, a tennis ball served that hits the shared line is playable from either side service positions. In the absence of the line the size of both service areas deviates from the rules because each court is narrower than specified by the USTA and the ITF.

It is derived from the RD-180 dual-combustion chamber engine, which itself was derived in turn from the four-chamber RD-170 originally used in the Energia launcher. The RD-191 is fueled by a kerosene / LOX mixture and uses an oxygen-rich staged combustion cycle. In the future the engine is expected to become a workhorse in the Russian space sector, as older launch vehicles are phased out of production and service. ==Design== Burn ignition is provided chemically, by feeding a starter fluid into the combustion chamber and gas generator which is self-igniting on contact with liquid oxygen. The engine is capable of throttling down to 30% of nominal thrust; the design also allows for a short-duration enhanced thrust (up to 105% of nominal level) in emergency situations. A Cardan suspension provides for yaw and pitch controls by gimballed thrust deflection up to 8 degrees. A modern design, the engine incorporates sensors monitoring burn conditions. The measurements are used for telemetry and an emergency protection system. The engine's powerhead fulfills two additional functions, heating helium gas for pressurization of propellant tanks and generating hydraulic power for hydraulic actuators to deflect the nozzle and aerodynamic rudders. ==Development== On 5 September 2008, the creator of the engine, NPO Energomash, stated that the engine had completed the full cycle of development and burn tests and is ready for manufacturing and delivery. The primary launch vehicle utilizing this engine is the Angara rocket, currently being developed. As of 2010, the engine had passed all development phases and its nine prototypes had accumulated over 23,000 seconds in 105 firing tests, with one of them reaching the maximum running time of 3,635 seconds in 12 tests. Interdepartmental tests are under way and manufacturing of the engines for flight development tests has started. The flight tests will begin with a launch of the Angara-1.2 light-class rocket, and then of the Angara-A5 heavy launcher. Despite problems with funding, work on the RD-191 engine is in line with the Angara rocket family's master schedule. ==VariantsRD-151=== A version of the RD-191 with thrust reduced to 170 tonnes, called RD-151, was fire-tested on July 30, 2009. The first flight test of this engine was conducted on 25 August 2009 as part of the first launch of South Korean Naro-1 rocket. ===RD-181=== The RD-181 is based on the RD-191 and is adapted for integration on the Antares rocket. While the RD-193 was designed as a close replacement for the NK-33, on December 17, 2014, Orbital Sciences announced that it would use the NPO Energomash RD-181 on the version 2 Antares launch vehicle and had contracted directly with NPO Energomash for up to 20 RD-181 engines. Two engines are used on the first stage of each Antares, which is currently used to carry cargo to the International Space Station under contract to NASA. While Russian press had stated that the contract was valued at US$ 1 billion with options, Orbital stated on 26 January 2015 that even when exercising all the options the contract was less than that amount, and that the initial contractual commitment was significantly less than that. On 19 February 2015, Orbital ATK said that its revamped Antares rocket featuring a new main engine would make its first launch in March 2016. On 29 May 2015, Orbital stated that the new engines had successfully conducted seven certification firings and all went as expected. It also stated that the first two flight models were doing its final tests and would be delivered to Orbital in early July. The two RD-181s have more thrust than the paired AJ-26 engines used on the first generation Antares. Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems (formerly Orbital) modified the core stage to accommodate the increased performance, and then to finish up its CRS-1 cargo contract commitment to NASA for delivering a total of of cargo in only four additional flights, rather than the five more that would have been required with the AJ-26/Antares I combination. For the Antares 230+ upgrades, debuted with the CRS-2 Cygnus NG-12 mission, heat exchangers were removed from the RD-181 engine. ===RD-193=== In April 2013, it was announced that a further derivation, the RD-193, had completed testing. This version is lighter and shorter, designed for use on the light-launcher Soyuz-2.1v when the inventory of surplus NK-33 engines is exhausted. == See also == * Comparison of orbital rocket engines == References  * Category:Rocket engines of Russia Category:Rocket engines using kerosene propellant Category:Rocket engines using the staged combustion cycle Category:Energomash rocket engines ","title":"RD-191"},{"id":"19232108","text":"The is a 42.7 km Japanese railway line operated by the third-sector railway operator Tosa Kuroshio Railway.

He was the grandson of Domenico Gallini, his father was Luca Gallini and his mother was Maria Umilta Agostini, the daughter of Giovanni Agostini. Gallini was trained in Paris by François Marcel and emigrated to England at an unknown date, though he had been performing at the Académie Royale de Musique. By 17 December 1757 he was dancing at Covent Garden Theatre. Between 1758 and 1766 he performed and served as director of dances at the King's Theatre now Her Majesty's Theatre, Haymarket (the opera house), except for an interval at Covent Garden in late 1763 and 1764. He ceased to perform in public at the end of the 1766 season. In a campaign to raise the intellectual respectability of dance, on 3 March 1762 Gallini published A Treatise on the Art of Dancing, which was followed by Critical Observations on the Art of Dancing (1770). Dance historians agree that these elegantly printed volumes were largely derivative, citing Weaver, Cahusac, and other sources, but were important statements of philosophy that helped gain Gallini entrée into society. ==Marriage into the aristocracy== While teaching dance, at which he was expert, he courted and married privately, on 23 February 1763 at St James's, Westminster, Lady Elizabeth Peregrine Bertie (d. 1804), the daughter of Willoughby Bertie, 3rd Earl of Abingdon. She gave birth to twin sons Francis Cecil Gallini and John Andrea Gallini on 13 October 1766 and later to two daughters, Joyce Ann Gallini and Louise Gallini. Notwithstanding outrage in parts of the fashionable world, her family accepted the match. However, the marriage eventually broke down, and in later years the couple lived apart. In 1766, Norreys Bertie left his estates to Elizabeth's brother Captain Peregrine, charging Hampstead Norreys with an annuity to Elizabeth. Willoughby Bertie, 4th Earl of Abingdon, was a music patron and composer, as well as a political writer and his brother-in-law. Gallini brought Bertie into contact with J.C. Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel, and he was subsequently very involved in their careers. Gallini was a friend of Haydn's, who may have encouraged Bertie to compose. Haydn went to Vienna, and there he was found by Johann Peter Salomon, the great German-born violinist and impresario who had settled in London, where he gave successful subscription concerts. Salomon had read of Prince Esterházy's death while recruiting singers in Cologne and had hastened to Vienna to engage Haydn, and if possible Mozart as well (but Mozart was already committed to composing Die Zauberflöte and was not free). Salomon was a brilliant businessman and his proposal to Haydn was so attractive that the composer could hardly refuse: 3000 gulden from the great impresario Gallini, director of the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, for a new opera and 100 gulden for each of twenty new instrumental or vocal pieces to be conducted by Haydn in Salomon's subscription concerts. As soon as Haydn set foot on English soil, 5000 gulden (£500 were then the equivalent of 4883 gulden) were to be deposited in Haydn's Viennese bank, Fries & Co. ==Work as an impresario: opera and ballet== In addition to the money and property his wife brought him, Gallini, who was famously parsimonious, accumulated a substantial fortune. On 28 June 1774, with Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel, he purchased premises in Hanover Square, where the three men built a splendid concert hall—the Hanover Square Rooms—95 feet by 30. Gallini bought out his partners on 12 November 1776 and continued to operate the hall successfully for the rest of his life, making large sums from series such as the Professional Concert and Academy of Ancient Music, and from masquerades held there. Not content, in the spring of 1778 Gallini attempted to buy the opera at the King's Theatre, Haymarket. Xenophobia against him coalesced into a bidding war won by Richard Brinsley Sheridan and Thomas Harris, who paid the outlandish price of £22,000 for the enterprise (all of it borrowed). Unfamiliar with opera, they began losing large sums; meanwhile, Gallini embarked on an aggressive campaign to force them out. After seven years of transfers of authority, forced declarations of bankruptcy, feuding trustees, and sheriff's sales, he achieved his wish, though the conditions were far from ideal. He served as trustee for William Taylor, who loathed him, harassed him, and sued him year after year, and he had to operate under a budget cap of £18,000 enforced by the court of chancery. The lord chamberlain, who regarded him as an undesirable foreigner, made him struggle to get a licence to perform. Surprisingly, Gallini paid more attention to opera than to dance, mounting highly creditable seasons. To supplement the Italian repertory he began to import both works and performers from German houses, and he drew to England such major performers as Gertrud Elisabeth Mara and the castratos, Giovanni Maria Rubinelli and Luigi Marchesi. Dance required more than a single star, however. Without a major choreographer, even Auguste Vestris's performance seemed less brilliant, and although Jean-Georges Noverre returned at the end of 1787 the talent provided for him to work with was so limited that in February 1789 a riotous audience demanded that better dancers be imported. Even after Marie-Madeleine Guimard consented to a short visit for exorbitant fees, Gallini somehow managed to run up a profit of £4000 in four seasons—though the money went to the theatre's innumerable creditors. All along, rent from concerts continued to increase Gallini's personal fortune. In 1784, Gallini and Elizabeth bought the manors of Hampstead Norreys and Bothampstead from her brother Peregrine, followed in 1785 by the adjacent manor of Yattendon. He also acquired real estate abroad. Money probably also changed hands when he was awarded the knighthood of the Order of the Golden Spur by the pope in the spring of 1788. He was then popularly styled Sir John Gallini, but English society proved more willing to joke about the title than to recognize it. The King's Theatre burnt down on 17 June 1789 during evening rehearsals, and the dancers fled the building as beams fell onto the stage. The fire had been deliberately set on the roof, and Gallini offered a reward of £300 for capture of the culprit. With the theatre destroyed, each group laid its own plans for a replacement. Although Gallini schemed to take full control of the business in a new space with a new partner, Robert Bray O'Reilly, by December he had broken away and joined forces with his nemesis William Taylor, who was rebuilding the old theatre. Defying the lord chamberlain, they reopened without a license in the spring of 1791, with Gallini responsible for artistic direction. Joseph Haydn wrote an opera L'anima del filosofo for Gallini, but the performance was banned.The Opera whose time hadn't come Haydn Seek The opera wasn't performed until the 20th century. Despite the presence of Haydn, the great tenor Giacomo Davide, and the Vestris, father and son, the company lost £9700 in five months. Gallini thereafter dropped out of opera management and contented himself with teaching, at which he was recognized to be superb, and running Hanover Square. He probably lost very little on the new opera venture, since he did collect most of the money he was owed from Taylor. == Death and legacy == Memorial at St Peter and St Paul's church, Yattendon He died abruptly at his home in Hanover Square on the morning of 5 January 1805 at the age of seventy-six, survived by his son John Andrea and two daughters, among whom an estate said to be £150,000 was divided. He was buried at St Peter and St Paul's church, Yattendon, Berkshire. Having sought his fortune in England in 1757, Gallini had led the opera ballet, taught a generation of aristocrats to dance and married one of them, made a substantial fortune as impresario of the chief concert venue in London, and proved to be one of the most successful opera managers of the eighteenth century. ==NotesReferences== * Burden, Michael, \\"Regular meetings: Gallini and Noverre in London 1756-1794\\", in Michael Burden and Jennifer Thorp, eds, The Works of Monsieur Noverre Translated from the French: Noverre, his Circle, and the English Lettres sur la danse (New York: Pendragon Press, 2014), pp. 137-56. *Gibson, Elizabeth and Price, Curtis (1992), 'Gallini, Giovanni Andrea Battista' in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, ed.

The museum is dedicated to the industrial history of Odda and Tyssedal, and more generally to history related to rivers and water, hydropower production, electricity, power intensive industry and its society. A main attraction is the power station Tysso I, which was designed by architect Thorvald Astrup (1876-1940) and constructed between 1906 and 1918. The station contains machinery and control room equipment from the entire period of operation, 1908-1989\\\\. In 2000 Tyssedal power plant - including Tysso I, pipelines, distribution pool and watchman's house at Lilletopp, and intake pool and valve house at Vetlevann - was protected for posterity by the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage. During the following years the power plant went through extensive restoration. Close to the power station is the former administration building for AS Tyssefaldene, the power generation company that owns and operates the hydropower plant. Today the building houses the museum's exhibitions, library, archives, photo and audio collections, as well as an auditorium. Further upstream it is possible to visit the installations at Lilletopp, Vetlevann and the Ringedals Dam. Three old workmen's houses in Odda and a small former hydrologic research station at the glacier Folgefonna are also part of the museum. A via ferrata has been built that allows safe climbing along the very steep pipeline. ==References * Norsk Vasskraft- og Industristadmuseum website *AS Tyssefaldene website Category:Archives in Norway Category:Local museums in Norway Category:Museums in Vestland Category:History museums in Norway Category:Open-air museums in Norway Category:Industry museums in Norway H Category:Museums established in 1989 ","title":"Norwegian Museum of Hydropower and Industry"},{"id":"19232237","text":"A Roller Racer, or Flying Turtle as it was originally named by the inventor, is a toy human-powered vehicle for children.

Out of the more than 100 books and pamphlets, one of the most notable works was his famous Letter to my Fellow Citizens in which he promoted democracy, universal electoral rights and the unity among Belgian liberals and Catholics. As one of the heroes of the Belgian Revolution, he proclaimed the independence of Belgium from the Netherlands (from the terrace of the Brussels City Hall on 28 September 1830), and inaugurated the first Belgian parliamentary assembly (on 10 November 1830), on behalf of the outgoing Belgian provisional government. N. de Potter, R. Dalemans, F. Balace, Louis de Potter. Révolutionnaire Belge en 1830, in: Editions Couleur Livres, 2011, col. Histoire de Belgique. ==Life== Coat of arms of the de Potter de Droogenwalle family De Potter belonged to a rich noble family (his father was the Esquire Clément de Potter de Droogenwalle) which sought asylum in Germany after the second French invasion of the Southern Netherlands in 1794 and remained there until the Consulate. This meant that Louis's education in Bruges remained largely incomplete and so he restarted it during the family's time abroad, wanting to learn Latin, ancient Greek and modern languages. He spent 12 years in Italy (in Rome from 1811 to 1821 and in Florence from 1821 to 1823) to study the history of the Roman Catholic church, though he studied it with the prejudices which predominated in Enlightenment thoughts. He then discovered the foundations of the reforms made in the \\"aristocratic republics of Italy\\" and those of the revolution for the French republic. While in Rome, he began an affair with the Italian painter, Matilde Malenchini, that lasted until 1826. In 1816 he had already published his Considérations sur l'histoire des principaux conciles depuis les apôtres jusqu'au Grand Schisme d'Occident (Considerations on the history of the main councils from the apostles to the Great Western Schism). In 1821, he completed this first work with another, in six volumes, titled L'Esprit de l'Église ou Considérations sur l'histoire des conciles et des papes, depuis Charlemagne jusqu'à nos jours (The Spirit of the Church, or Considerations on the history of the councils and the popes, from Charlemagne to our own days). During his stay in Florence, he had access to the archives and library of Bishop Ricci - minister-counsellor of the Grand-Duke of Habsburg - it was there that he gathered the materials for a third work, Vie de Scipion de Ricci, évêque de Pistoie et de Prato (Life of Scipione de' Ricci, bishop of Pistoia and of Prato). This was published in 1825, and was immediately translated into German and English. The author's aim in this work was to glorify Josephinism, the justification of the reforms carried out in Tuscany under the auspices of grand duke Pietro Leopold I of Tuscany, brother of Joseph II. Théodore Juste, \\"Potter (Louis de)\\", in Biographie nationale de Belgique, vol V, 1876, col. 620-629. De Potter was a founding member of the first Société des douze. After a long residence in Germany, France, and Italy, he returned to Bruges in 1823, initially very satisfied to see the northern and southern Netherlands united under the rule of William of Nassau. He wrote \\"I thank fate for destining me to live under liberal political institutions, which, by the principals of moderation and equity, put no barrier in the way of thought\\". After his father's death, he left Bruges and settled in Brussels, but did not re-assume the title to which his noble blood entitled him. Even so, he had to get a job and was on very good terms with the whole cabinet, or at least with the head of the department of the interior, Pierre van Gobbelschroy, his former classmate.Théodore Juste, op cit. alt= De Potter began his political career as editor of the liberal opposition journal Le Courrier des Pays-Bas. He deployed his verve as a polemicist against the Catholic clergy, the aristocracy and William I's government. One of his articles, published on 8 November 1828, was a violent pamphlet against the king's ministers and marked the journal's rallying to the cause of unionism. Minister of Justice Cornelis Van Maanen hounded de Potter for this opposition to William's government and finally had him found guilty on 20 December 1828, condemning him to 18 months' detention and a fine of 1000 florins. On 8 January 1830, William I revoked the job and pension of all members of the Belgian estates general who opposed his policies. De Potter was then still in prison and there launched the idea of a national subscription to compensate deputies and civil servants who had fallen prey to this measure. Van Maanen continued to hound de Potter, this time for plotting against the state and exciting revolt, and so on 30 April 1830 he was sentenced to an 8-year exile by the Brussels court of assizes for publications composed in prison, such as the pamphlet on the Union of the Catholics and Liberals (de Potter's co- plotters and friends Jean-François Tielemans and Adolphe Bartels were condemned to seven years' banishment at the same sitting). He thought of spending his exile in France, but this country refused to welcome him and so he ended up in Prussia until the July Revolution, when France did allow him in. After the Belgian Revolution, he returned to Brussels and was a member of the provisional government. In it he was given the specific task of planning the basic laws for the new state of Belgium. On 10 November he pronounced the opening of the National Congress of Belgium, in favour of a Republican regime. After the Congress pronounced itself in favour of a constitutional monarchy on 13 November 1830 he returned to private life and upon the provisional government's downfall he withdrew to France. == Works == * Considérations sur l'histoire des principaux conciles depuis les apôtres jusqu'au Grand Schisme d'Occident, 1816 * L'Esprit de l'Église ou Considérations sur l'histoire des conciles et des papes, depuis Charlemagne jusqu'à nos jours, 6 volumes, 1821 * Vie de Scipion de Ricci, évêque de Pistoie et de Prato, 1825. * Saint- Napoléon, en paradis et en exil, 1825. * Lettres de saint Pie V sur les affaires religieuses en France, 1826. * L'Union des catholiques et des libéraux dans les Pays-Bas, (1ste editie juli 1829, 2e editie, Brussel 1831) * Lettre de Démophile à M.

Future cartoons featuring the characters were planned, but were cancelled following the shutdown of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts Animation in 1969. ==Characters== Rapid Rabbit, a small brown rabbit (who's not to be confused with Rapid T. Rabbit), is every bit as fast as his name implies; a pantomime character, he never says a word, but uses a bicycle horn to express himself. He is inspired by the Road Runner, a famed Looney Tunes character created by Chuck Jones. Quick Brown Fox, another pantomime character, is a fox who wants to eat the fast-running rabbit, but consistently fails to catch him despite using a variety of traps and devices. The fox's name is derived from the popular pangram, \\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\\" He is inspired by Wile E. Coyote, another Looney Tunes character who is the aforementioned Road Runner’s co-star; also created by Chuck Jones. ==Cartoon== Rabbit Stew and Rabbits Too! is a 1969 theatrically-released cartoon, one of the last few cartoons of the Looney Tunes series (which, at that time, was owned by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts). It was a \\"chase\\" cartoon along the same lines as the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner cartoons; a predator tries and fails to catch his intended prey, despite using a number of ingenious or comically absurd traps. It was intended to be the first of a series of Rapid Rabbit cartoons which had been planned, but no more were produced as the animation department folded soon after its release. ===Synopsis=== Quick Brown Fox wants to make rabbit stew, with the elusive Rapid Rabbit as the main ingredient. To this end, he tries several different traps — simple ones at first, but they gradually become ridiculously elaborate — and all of them fail to ensnare Rapid, and some of them end up hurting Quick - some including a spring-loaded hammer set to whack Rapid when he grabs a carrot tied to the trap (Rapid struggles to grab the carrot, resulting in an impatient Quick unintentionally setting the trap off), and a \\"Free Trip to the Moon\\" via a cannon, that is also unintentionally set off by Quick - which results in him getting shot into the air and then hit on the head with a cannonball. Ultimately, Quick sets up the most elaborate trap of them all, a large Rube Goldberg-style contraption that will land Rapid into a heated frying pan, positioned next to a dining table for convenience. However, Rapid uses his horn to startle Quick, who takes a short leap backwards in surprise, lands into the contraption's trigger, and ends up suffering everything his trap has to offer, finally landing flat onto the table, breaking it apart. Rapid finishes the job by bundling Quick in the tablecloth and tying a helium balloon to the cloth’s corners, lifting Quick into the sky. ==References * Rapid Rabbit at Don Markstein's Toonopedia * * Category:Looney Tunes characters Category:Animated films about foxes Category:Animated films about rabbits and hares ","title":"Quick Brown Fox and Rapid Rabbit"},{"id":"19232401","text":"The 1900 Open Championship was the 40th Open Championship, held 6–7 June at the Old Course at St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.

Oxford Uni. Press and later castigated by 17th century moralists as one of ill repute.Teach Yourself Card Games, David Parlett, p. 27 - Hodder & Stoughton 1994. It belongs to a very ancient family of card games and clearly relates to a group known as Trut, Truque, also Tru, and the South American game Truco. Its more elaborate version is the Spanish game of Truc, which is still much played in many parts of Southern France and Spain. == Etymology == The name Put, pronounced \\"u\\", like the name of the English village of Putney,A grammar of the English language for commercial schools, Robert Gordon Latham, p. 40 - Taylor, Walter & Maberly, London 1850 derives from \\"putting up your cards in cafe\\", if you do not like them, or from \\"putting each other to the shift\\".The Sporting magazine, vol. XI p. 81 - J. Wheble, London 1798 == The game == The game of Put is played generally by two people, sometimes by three, and often by four, with a 52-card pack with cards ranking 3-2-A-K-Q-J-T-9-8-7-6-5-4 in each suit. The game is won by the first player to score 5 points over as many deals as necessary, or by the player who wins a majority of three tricks played in any deal. The player drawing the highest Put card (Three high, Four low) deals first, and the deal alternates. Shuffle thoroughly and deal three cards to each player in a clockwise mode, one at time. The turn to deal always passes to the left. Tricks are played to unusual rules. Any card may be led, and the other player may also play any card: there is no need to follow suit and there are no trumps. The trick is taken by the higher card, and the winner of one trick leads to the next. If cards of equal rank are played e.g. two Threes, two Aces, or whatever, the trick is tied and belongs to neither player. In this case it is put to one side, and whoever led to it leads to the next. If non-dealer throws up his cards, he loses 1 point; if he plays, and the dealer does not lay down another to him, he scores 1 point; but should the dealer either win the same, pass it, or lay down one of equal value, forming what is styled a tie, non-dealer is still at ease to Put, that is, play or not, and his opponent then only scores 1 point; then if both parties agree to go on, whoever wins all the tricks, or two out of three, scores 5 points, which is the game. If each player obtain one trick, and the third is a tie, then neither party scores. Either player, when about to lead to a trick, may do one of three things: * Throw his hand in, thus conceding the deal and 1 point to the opponent. * Lead a card without saying anything. His opponent must then play. * Say \\"Put\\", which is short for \\"I put it to you that you should throw your cards in while you have the chance\\". If the opponent follows this advice, the deal ends and the putter scores 1 point. If not, putter leads and the other must play. === Score === The game is won outright, regardless of points scored, by the player who wins two tricks in a deal, or one trick if the other two are tied. If each player wins one trick and one trick is tied, the result is a draw by \\"trick and tie\\" and there is no score for that deal. If neither wins outright, the winner is the first player to score 5 points for concessions. === The laws of Put === * If the dealer accidentally discover any of his adversary's cards, the latter may insist upon a new deal. * If the dealer discover any of his own cards in dealing, he must abide by the deal. * When a faced card is discovered during the deal, the cards must be reshuffled and dealt again. * If the dealer give his adversary more cards than are necessary, the adversary may call a fresh deal, or suffer the dealer to draw the extra cards from his hand. * If the dealer give himself more cards than are his due, the adversary may add a point to his game, and call a fresh deal, or draw the extra cards from the dealer's hand. * No bystander must interfere, under penalty of paying the stakes. * Either party saying \\"I put\\", that is, \\"I play\\", play cannot retract, but must abide the event of the game or pay the stakes. == Strategy == Neither player will reach 5 points, because as soon as he reaches 4 the other will have no incentive to concede. Having nothing to lose, he may as well play the hand out on the off-chance of winning outright. This is not necessarily a defect in the game, though there may be a defect (of omission) in the only original source from which all later accounts of the game derive. What it means, in effect, is that in the course of one game you have four chances of throwing your cards in without penalty; the points are not a score so much as a way of keeping count of your used opportunities. Of course, you could agree that an outright win earns a double game or stake, and a win on points only a single, in which case they become a \\"score\\" rather that of a \\"count\\". Considerable daring is necessary in this game,The modern pocket Hoyle, p. 201, William Brisbane Dick - Dick and Fitzgerald, NY 1868 for a bold player will often \\"Put\\" upon very bad cards in order to tempt his adversary into giving him a point. Sometimes the hand is played with \\"Putting\\", when the winner of the three tricks, or of two out of three, scores 1 point. The best cards are first: the Threes, next the Twos, and then the Aces; the Kings, Queens, Knaves, and Tens following in order down to the Four, which is the lowest card in the pack. == Variants == The game becomes more interesting if the pack is shortened to 32 cards by stripping out all the lower ranks from Four to Nine. === Le Truc === In his book A Gamut of Games, Sid Sackson describes a similar French game called Le Truc, which he translates as \\"The Knack\\". This is played with a 32-card pack ranking 6-7-A-K-Q-J-T-9. The winning of two tricks, or one and two ties, scores 1 point. When about to play to a trick, a player may propose to double the value of the hand, allowing the other to throw in his hand to prevent the double from taking effect. The first to reach 12 points wins the game, and the first to win two games wins the rubber. The French version of Truc is closely related to the English Put.\\"How to Play Le Truc\\" Retrieved 31 January 2020. === Speculation === The Modern Pocket Hoyle (1868) describes the game of Speculation as follows: :This is a lively and amusing round game, and is played with a pack of fifty-two cards, which rank in the same order as at Whist. Each player deposits a certain number of counters in the pool, from one to three, and the dealer doubles the number of the others. Three cards are dealt, one at a time, to each player, and one turned up for trumps, which the dealer may sell to any one who will purchase it, either before or after it is turned up. The highest trump card dealt out is entitled to take the pool, but the cards are not to be looked at except in this manner: The elder hand turns the uppermost of his three cards; if not trumps, or if lower than the dealer's turn-up, it is of course of no value: but if higher, he may sell it to any one who chooses to speculate, and the price offered should bear some proportion to the chance of the card being the best trump in the deal, and likewise to the number of counters in the pool. This is done by asking who will buy; and if two or more offer a price, the seller of course accepts the highest bidder's offer, if he considers it adequate to the value of the card. If a sale is not effected, the next in hand turns the uppermost of his cards, and if it is a saleable one, proceeds to sell it as above described. When a card is sold, it is handed to the buyer, who places it before him, and does not turn any of his remaining cards till a higher trump appears, his left-hand neighbor becoming elder hand, and turning the next card. In this way the play goes on, till all the cards are turned, when, as before stated, the holder of the best trump, whether by purchase or otherwise, wins the pool. :When a good trump is turned by any of the party, he should be allowed time to sell it before another card is discovered. On turning knaves and fives of any suit, a counter is to be paid into the pool for each, by the possessor of the hand in which they happen to be. :It is customary to purchase cards before they are turned, when they happen to be among the last, and no high trump already discovered. Speculations are frequently profitable; but if you turn a good card, it is generally advisable to sell it if you can obtain a fair price, particularly if there are many cards to turn. A cautious player sometimes sells his hand before it is dealt, or before turning any of his cards, if he can get more for it than his stake in the pool. :This game is sometimes varied a little by dealing a spare hand, which is not to be looked at till all the hands are discovered, and if it should contain the best trump dealt, the pool remains for the next deal, in addition to the usual contributions of each player, thus doubling the amount. === Four-handed Put === It differs only in that any two of the players give each his best card to his partner, who then lays out one of his, and the game is afterwards played as in two-handed Put. == In literature== The game of Put appears in a \\"riddle\\", or acrostic, probably written by a Royalist in the thrilling interval between the resignation of Richard Cromwell on May 25, 1659 and the restoration of Charles II, crowned at Westminster Abbey on 23 April 1661. It expresses in enigmatical terms the designs and hopes of the King's adherents, under colour of describing a game of \\"Put\\". The initial letters of the seven verses are an anagram, and indicate the number of cards shared between the two players in the game. S, X, I, C, R, A, T, make SIX CART, or six cartes (six cards). Six cards, also, are expressly mentioned in the riddle itself, namely: \\"the Knave\\" (line 2), \\"a King\\" (3), \\"Heart\\" (5), \\"Trey\\", \\"Quarter\\" or quatre, and \\"the Buck\\" (7). \\"The Buck\\", probably one of the picture-cards, or the ace, inferior to \\"Trey\\", which is the best card in the game of put; therefore \\"Trey\\" comes \\"to pull down the Buck\\".Notes and queries, p. 282 - Bell & Daldy, London, Jan-Jul 1859 S-hall's have a Game at Put, to pass away the time ? X-pect no foul-plav; though I do play the Knave I-have a King at hand, yea, that I have: C-Cards be true, then the Game is mine. R-ejoyce my heart, to see thee then repine. A-that's lost, that's Cuckold's luck. T-rey comes like Quarter, to pull down the Buck. *\\"Shall's have a game of put, to pass away the time ?\\" i.e. during the weary and anxious period of waiting for the King's arrival. The political allusions are obvious throughout,and could hardly fail to be understood by persons then living. *\\"Though I do play the Knave, I have a King at hand:\\" — Though I dissemble, and conceal my designs (as did Monk, &c.;), the King is not far off. He was on the opposite shore of the Channel, preparing to embark for England. *\\"Cards, be ye true\\" &c.;: — Some of the professed royalists had been false. *\\"The Game is mine. Rejoice, my heart, to see thee then repine:\\" — Great will be our joy to see the vexation of the opposite party when we have won. *\\"Ah, that's lost!\\" — A temporary check; the failure about that time of an ill-concerted effort to restore the royal cause; Sir G. Booth defeated by Lambert, Aug. 19, 1659, in consequence of which the King deferred his embarkation. Yet the King's friends little heeded this transient disaster, as is evident from the unconcerned and jeering tenour of line 6.: \\"Ah! That's lost! That's Cuckold's luck;\\" q.d. your luck. *\\"Trey comes like Quarter, to pull down the Buck\\" - \\"Trey\\" being the highest card in put, and quatre the lowest, some difficulty may be found in the expression, which looks like assimilating the greater to the less. But \\"like Quarter\\" is a French phrase Anglicised, \\"Trey comes comme quatre,\\" energetically, vehemently; \\"faire du bruit comme quatre\\" \\"The Buck\\" is an old English synonym for the Coarse Appellation, intended, no doubt, for a Puritan, or for the Puritan party. \\"Pulling down the Buck\\", is also an allusion to hunting. John Dickson Carr's novel The Devil in Velvet, set in 1675 London, includes a scene at Whitehall Palace in which the King's mistress Nell Gwyn and the courtier Ralph Montague play Put with stakes in the thousands of guineas. Gwyn is depicted as saying she prefers Put to other card games such as Ombre which are \\"too slow\\". == See also == *Primero *Truco *Poker *Gilet == References  External links == * Hoyle's Improved Edition of the Rules for Playing Fashionable Games * The Game of Put * The Compleat Gamester Category:16th-century card games Category:English card games ","title":"Put (card game)"},{"id":"19232500","text":"Wolfgang Herold (born 24 October 1961) is a German film producer and sound supervisor.

Cedar Island is a former island in Long Island Sound belonging to the town of Clinton, Connecticut in Middlesex County, Connecticut. Currently the island is a peninsula attached to Hammonasset State Park in Madison, CT due to the filling of the strait in a public works project to improve flow of the Hammonasset River through Clinton Harbor. ==Physical description== The average elevation is at high tide; low tide can add . The island measures one and a half miles long by a quarter-mile wide and lies about a quarter of a mile from Clinton Harbor. It has about 54 houses and summer cottages (mostly built before 1950). Many have piers for boats and fishing. The normal summertime population of the island is between 100 and 150 people. The undeveloped western two-thirds of the island form one of the few unimproved areas of shoreline along the Connecticut coast. Notable vegetation includes salt marsh and salt meadow cord grasses (Spartina species) beach plum (Prunus maritima), rugosa rose (Rosa rugosa), and juniper trees that are referred to locally as \\"cedars\\" (Juniperus virginiana). Abundant bird life is also present on the island. Protected nesting areas for the piping plover (Charadrius melodus) are provided in the spring. The American oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) is frequently viewed along with the osprey (Pandion haliaetus) and other seabirds common to Long Island Sound shore. ==Amenities== The island does not have grid electricity or telephones, the sole exception being a solar powered telephone on the town dock connected directly to the Clinton Police Department for emergencies. Many of the houses and cottages use propane for heat and hot water, while some also have solar power.

In 1932, the station was transferred from what was by then Oregon State Agricultural College to the Oregon State Board of Higher Education's General Extension Division.KOAC timeline from the Oregon State University website Starting in the 1950s, the board signed on a number of satellite radio stations, as well as a sister network of television stations fronted by KOAC- TV (channel 7, which signed on in 1957). This group became known as Oregon Educational Broadcasting, which evolved into the Oregon Educational and Public Broadcasting Service in 1971 and became today's Oregon Public Broadcasting in 1981. KOAC-AM-TV served as the flagship stations until 1981, when the network was spun off from the Board of Higher Education and became a separate state agency.

Vardon sliced his first two shots out of bounds at the 1st hole and took six, there being no penalty stroke for out of bounds at that time. However, he played the rest of the round so well that his score of 72 was four shots ahead of the second place Willie Fernie, the 1883 champion. Vardon again started badly in the afternoon but his 77 still gave him a four shot lead over Herd and Ted Ray. 45 players, including nine amateurs, made the cut on 168. The next morning, Herd shot 73, four strokes better than anyone else. This gave him a three stroke lead over Vardon who had taken 80. Braid, J.H. Taylor and Tom Vardon were in third place, eight strokes behind Herd. Herd started his final round well but took six at the 8th and 9th holes and then 5 at the short 11th.

The purpose of the Erie Yacht Club is to maintain, develop, and enlarge the facilities for yachting and boating, to encourage and develop yachting and other aquatic sports, to promote social recreational activities. To improve yachting and boating facilities at the Erie Yacht Club basin and in the area of the Erie Harbor generally. File:EYCLogorgb-pc.jpgEYCLogorgb-pc ==Early history== Commodore Bliss On September 14, 1894, George T. Bliss, who served as Erie Yacht Club's Commodore from 1895-1903 and again from 1908-1910, sent out about fifty circulars, information forms and return envelopes to interested parties concerning, \\"a boating club in Erie that will take all kinds of boats.\\" His broadside calling for the founding of a club included his proposition that the club would have to have a clubhouse plus a low building to keep sculls, small boat, and equipment. There were many interested \\"Erieites\\" among the first to respond, so much so, that a second circular was sent out on September 20, 1894, calling for a meeting on September 20, 1894. The organizational meeting was held in the Writing Room of the Reed House on North Park Row. The initial meeting was well attended. Forty-eight were on hand and seventeen names were sent in to the proper committee, so the organization started off with practically 65 names on the roll. While the name did not survive, Bliss originally proposed that the club be called the Keystone Yacht Club. By October, 137 individuals had applied for membership. The first regular meeting was scheduled for November 14 at the Reed house. It was announced that \\"no charter member will have a vote unless he has paid at least $5 of the initiation, which is $15.\\" All persons becoming members after January 1, 1895, were to be \\"charged $20 initiation fee and $5 semi-annual dues.\\" At this point it was time to fish or cut bait. In his May 1896, article in The Rudder, Bliss laconically noted that: \\"Meetings were held that were well attended until money was suggested. We couldn't get a corporal's guard together for weeks. But we kept at it, and finally on Wednesday, Nov. 14, 1894, the organization was effected.\\" The first officers elected to serve the club were George T. Bliss (Commodore), George Berriman (Vice Commodore), C.C. Wicks (Rear Commodore), E.B. Lynch (Secretary) and Walter Reitzel, (Treasurer). The first members elected to the board of directors were: George Pratt, Charles H. Strong, William Nick, W. Boyd Hays, William P. Atkinson and W. J. Robertson. The first order of business was to select a site for the new club. The City of Erie leased water lots to the Club at the foot of Myrtle Street, east of what is now the Erie Water Authority Building. After several months of work on the bidding process and construction the Erie Yacht Club's first building was dedicated on July 18, 1895. It was a beautiful two-story building with outdoor decks on the north and west side. Considerations given the ladies were a special entrance so that \\"they do not have to pass through the house,\\" and the prohibition of liquor. As Bliss wrote in The Rudder: \\"We allow no liquor to be used or partaken of on or about the premises. This does not prohibit its being left at the club for boat owners, and being taken aboard the boats. We adopted this last rule as an experiment, and it works to perfection.\\" Clubhouse 1895 The fleet at the new anchorage included: Mystic, and three other small steamers, four naptha launches, three large center board sloops, four schooners, three yawls, three small sloops, two canoes, two shells and an eight oared shell. One of the latter was the Miriam, M, built and owned by W.L. Morrison, one of the Club's members who achieved considerable boating fame. The Miriam's anchor is displayed in the traffic circle near our present club's entrance. By the turn of the century, things began to change. The gasoline engine was powering launches previously driven by naphtha. Mostly crude two-cylinder affairs, they were temperamental and had a decided influence in changing the vocabulary of owners. For Club members, \\"gasoline was delivered in five gallon cans from wagons at ten cents a gallon and no tax.\\" Gasoline also led people away from the water. Judge Emory A. Walling was to note that there were many who were attracted \\"to the modern craze for bicycles and automobiles.\\" The Club directors did everything possible to counteract this trend. They got a permit from the Coast Guard \\"to pull yachts out\\" in the winter at Crystal Point on Misery Bay where the Perry Monument was later built. In addition, social events were established. The Club archives record one member's observation that in 1900, the Club \\"had a social urge and rented Tracy's Point\\", a hotel built on the site of the present Erie Water Authority Sommerheim Pumping Station. Erie Yacht Club Station No. 1, as it was known, was the focus of many social events for members and their families. Transportation was by bus, trolley car or by the motor launch, Dandy of Erie, which was termed by Bliss, \\"a little dude of a steam launch.\\" The docks were repaired and the buildings painted, and the refurbished country club \\"became a very popular rendezvous.\\" It burned in the winter of 1901-1902, although not all members mourned the loss. One chronicler wrote: \\"It was not a fundamental success and fortunately the building burned before the members drank themselves to death.\\" However, the short life of Station No. 1 pointed out the need for a larger facility. The Anchorage, as the Clubhouse at the foot of Myrtle Street was known, had become too small for the Club's needs, and plans were begun to replace it with something larger. The need became more critical as the newspapers reported that the Water Supply Commission was going to reclaim the water lots used by the Club to expand the Water Works. ==New Location== In 1917, Commodore Henri G. Chatain negotiated with Mr. J. A. Root, president of the Kahkwa Park Realty Company, Inc., for the last remaining property on the waterfront. In a letter dated March 21, 1917, Root proposed to donate the land \\"west of the ravine and below the cliff\\" in Kahkwa Parkto the Erie Yacht Club. In return, the Club was to pay $5,000 towards the road work and maintain the walls and the slope of the ravine without \\"marring the natural beauty of the surrounding lands.\\" With the land secured and permission granted from the Water Supply Commission of Pennsylvania \\"to construct a dock, retaining wall and fill\\" on the south shore of Presque Isle Bay, construction began. The location posed difficulties from the beginning. The beach area was made marshy by a stream which ran down the ravine. Until the creek was controlled, no road could be built, and it was necessary to lower materials by block and tackle. Construction was made more difficult by the breach at the neck of Presque Isle (which remained open until 1920) and theUnited States ' declaration of war on April 6, 1917. However, \\"the original clubhouse was torn down and E.H. Scott used his yacht, Roamer, to tow much of the lumber to the new location.\\" Commodore Chatain headed a work crew which built the first road down the hill, while a temporary Clubhouse was built by Herman Lund with the help of a number of members at the south end of the newly constructed west dock. Still in use, the Canoe House now houses the office of the Dockmaster. The members constructed a stiff- legged derrick permitting launching and retrieval of their boats. However, a proper Clubhouse awaited construction. Plans and specifications for a three- story building \\"to be done in a first-class, neat and workman-like manner\\" were drawn up by architect Clement S. Kirby. Kirchner Brothers submitted the winning bid for construction at $17,000, and Oscar Nick won the plumbing contract. Although they had initial problems securing payment, eventually both were paid. The season of 1919 began under difficulties, with access to the club almost barred by muddy roads, the grounds themselves a veritable mud hole, and buildings still under construction. In spite of the open Winter and Spring, boat owners were laggard about getting their craft into the water, and the confusion and disorder of construction work made itself felt until well into the season. But finally, buildings were finished, moorings installed, docks and piers constructed, grounds graded, drained, and seeded, driveway parking spaces paved and walks laid out. The marine railway was constructed, tennis courts built, a club spar erected, and later a locker house [still extant] built upon a flooring laid down as a temporary dancing pavilion. Lights, signs, screens and a hundred other refining details followed in their place, and the club was finally in shape barely in time for the formal opening on August 22, 1919. Clubhouse 1920 On September 30, Commodore E.H. Scott and the membership closed the season with \\"a monster clambake\\", confident in their preparations for hosting the I.L.Y.A. Regatta in 1920. Less than one month later (October 28), the United States embarked upon a novel - and ultimately unsuccessful - experiment known as Prohibition. As long-time Club secretary and historian George O. Loesel wrote: \\"Prohibition reared its ugly head . . . and Mr. Booze was no longer the money maker [and] thus considerable revenue was denied the club.\\" The \\"Roaring Twenties\\", replete with gambling, prostitution, rum-running (a profitable alternative enterprise) and bootlegging \\"bath-tub gin\\", had enormous impact. John G. Carney in his, Highlights of Erie Politics, said that the \\"only dry thing in Erie was the inside of a light bulb.\\" However, the Erie Yacht Club, like the rest of the country was officially dry. The country club atmosphere of the new facility led to a broader membership base and activities. The Club went beyond the \\"manly sports\\" of sailing, power boat racing, ice boating, fishing and hunting, and placed recreation in a broader context. Ice skating, tobogganing, quoits, ground bowling, tennis and beach golf were available to members and their families. The new facility had a restaurant and an outdoor grill, a trap-shooting range, quoit grounds, two tennis courts and areas set aside for ground bowling and beach golf. Card parties and regularly scheduled bridge sessions, dances and Saturday night parties and dances became regular features of the Club. ==Hard Times== The good times ended in 1929. Winter storms ravaged Presque Isle and the bay shore, and October was to bring the stock market crash inaugurating the Great Depression. One writer recalled: We have had some bad storms but none to compare with the one in 1929, which broke up our docks and front porch and carried them down the bay. A large gasoline tank in the ground broke free and was destroyed. This tragedy came close to finishing the Club, for it was the year of the \\"Big Depression\\" and both members and money were scarce. Commodore Lawrence M. Nagle determined that the Club should be saved and proceeded to purchase at his own expense all of the large planks from the Old Boston Store which was being dismantled. These were brought to the Club, and Jerry Johnson and Joe Meisel were hired to rebuild [the] porch and docks. Mr. Nagle also paid these men, since there was no money in the Club treasury. The membership roster was severely reduced, and \\"members dropped like flies.\\" At the Annual Meeting of 1932, membership and morale were so low that only 12 people showed up. They met in the upstairs Dining Room, where there was a fireplace, so that they would not have to fire up the boiler. Low membership was only one problem. Lake Erie was at one of its lowest levels ever. The water in 1931, according to Loesel, was \\"as low as a snake's belly\\". It was the determined intervention of the Harbor Commission and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to save yachting in the bay, which led to the state - \\"at its own expense\\" - to deepen the channel leading to the boat cranes. Despite the literal and figurative low water, the Erie Yacht Club survived. Club members were among the founding fathers of the Erie Chapter of the Power Squadron. Races and regattas still went on, and social events were revived by the end of the decade as a measure of economic stability came to the Club. These activities continued until the United Statesbecame involved in World War II on December 7, 1941. The war slowed, but did not stop, Club activities. Gas rationing placed a particular burden on power-boat owners who could not get fuel for pleasure craft, which were deemed to be \\"non-essential\\" to the war effort. Most owners laid up their boats \\"for the duration\\", although a number of power boat owners volunteered themselves and their boats for the local Coast Guard Auxiliary Flotilla. Sailboats took advantage of the non-rationed zephyrs. Although a number of sailboat races were cancelled because of lack of crew, many of the small boat races were held because the younger sailors were too young for the draft which sent members to war in both the European and Pacific theaters. The war ended in 1945, the same year that the Erie Yacht Club celebrated \\"a half Century of sport, achievement, and good fellowship in the glorious tradition of YACHTING!\\" ==Recovery== The post-war period brought boom times to the Erie Yacht Club. The war had kept plans for membership and improvements on hold. Membership expanded dramatically, but low yearly budgets meant that improvements were minor and upgrading was piecemeal. The gas tank was painted blue and white, a concrete foundation along with steps was added to the Clubhouse, new lamp posts, new faucets in the lavatories and telephone lines to the west dock all marked progress. In addition, the basins were deepened and docks increased in number, so that 1954 could accommodate 200 boats. New catwalks were installed with all wooden docks replaced by 1955. But, the Clubhouse was jury-rigged and replacements were beginning to show wear. Despite paint and polish, the situation was becoming critical. But, adversity had a bright side. On Memorial Day, 1953, a \\"Monsoon Flood\\" disrupted Opening Day ceremonies which were underway. The sewer viaduct, which crosses the road halfway up the ravine road, broke without warning sending tons of mud and debris down the road and into the parking lot. Those at the Club were trapped by the mudslide. Some left by boat, but many seized the opportunity as a perfect excuse for an extended Club party. It was two days before cars could get up the hill. ==Growth== By 1954, Club growth was such that the basins were deepened and docks increased in number so that 200 boats could be accommodated. The Clubhouse was renovated and plans were initiated for the building of another Clubhouse and rearrangement of Club grounds. At this time, a master plan was developed for future facilities, as the Club had grown beyond the size, which permitted piecemeal decisions. The docks were expanded in 1959 and again in 1965. In 1967, plans were finalized and fund-raising began for the new Clubhouse. Commodore William Ambro and the Bridge Officers conducted the groundbreaking ceremonies in January 1968, marking a new chapter for the Erie Yacht Club. Dedication of the new Clubhouse was held on October 5, 1968, with lavish festivities presided over by the master of dedication, the Honorable Raymond Shafer, Governor of Pennsylvania. Clubhouse 2009 Following the master plan, fill was obtained and new docks were built, which increased the basin area to triple that in use previously. New slips with steel catwalks were added, bulkheads secured the dock fill and additional boat-handling facilities were added. As of 1999, the basin capacity was approximately 400 boats. In July 1978, Commodore Richard Waller presided over a Mortgage Burning Celebration attended by an enthusiastic membership. The next year, the Club was given a long-overdue remodeling necessitated by the \\"bare bones\\" approach taken in building the new Clubhouse. For the Bridge and Board, however, major expenditures were strictly watched because of the shadow of uncertainty surrounding the title to the land. Efforts to acquire the land involved long, painstaking negotiations. The sale was discussed in 1979, and again in 1980 with the Erie-Western Pennsylvania Port Authority. The issue was a crucial one for future Club development, as the EYC had signed a fifty-year lease with the Erie-Western Pennsylvania Port Authority in 1963. Negotiations continued from 1979 to 1985 with no progress reported, and the Club was \\"in a limbo situation until [it received] a forthcoming response.\\" The Long-Range Planning Committee kept the focus on the land as the \\"first priority\\" and the Bridge and Board worked to effect a solution. ==Ownership== After the 1985 Annual Meeting, newly elected Rear Commodore G. \\"Gib\\" Loesel approached Commodore James Owen about his \\"contact\\" in City Hall, as his partner was advising Mayor Louis J. Tullio on insurance matters. Owen and Loesel negotiated with the Mayor and struck a deal for the purchase at a price of $550,000. At the May 24, 1986, Special Meeting, the membership voted 272-1 to purchase the property. Because of a lawsuit inaugurated by a member of City Council, the property closing was held up until February 9, 1987, at which time Commodore M. Roy Strausbaugh acquired the title on behalf of the EYC. With ownership came a new master plan, which required major changes to the Clubhouse and to the yacht basin. The plan was defeated at a special membership meeting in 1991. In 1992, Commodore Robert H. Allshouse and his Bridge presented a modified plan, which called for major renovations to the Clubhouse only. The grill room used for casual dining was expanded to include a non-smoking lower level, the addition of a 45-seat private dining room named after our first commodore, George Bliss and a ballroom that accommodates 175. The plan was ratified by the membership and construction started in the winter of 1993. The construction went smoothly with the club closed for only 4 weeks. Commodore Ronald Busse dedicated the newly renovated Clubhouse in the spring of 1993. ==Centennial== With the 100th anniversary of the Club on the horizon in 1995, Commodore Allshouse appointed Fleet Captain John Ashby as chairman of the newly created Centennial Committee, with the assignment to raise money for and plan all of the centennial events. The Centennial year started off with a bang, opening with a weekend Winter Carnival, which concluded with a fireworks display, designed specifically for the Club and its celebration of 100 years. In May, the Club had its official Centennial Ball. Due to the anticipated attendance, the gala was held in Rainbow Gardens rather than the Clubhouse. This evening of continuous entertainment and music was a formal event attended by more than 500 members and guests. During the summer, the Club held the largest-ever Family Picnic, bringing hundreds of families together for a day full of fun. Another jumbo event of the summer was the Club's raft-up. Staged immediately to the north of the basin, members circled their boats around floats \\"EYC\\" & \\"100\\". As no centennial celebration would have been complete without stories of the past, an Old Timers' Night was scheduled to professionally record and preserve the oral history and traditions of the EYC. This well-attended event allowed younger members to hear \\"sea stories\\" of the old (and not so old) days. In the fall, the Centennial Committee arranged for first-ever Oktoberfest. This event proved to be so popular that it has now become an annual Club event. The year concluded with the burying of a time capsule, in the \\"round about\\" located just inside the Club gates. This capsule will be opened at the 200th anniversary celebrations of the Club. To this day the Erie Yacht Club continues the traditions set forth by the Club's founding members to promote, encourage and develop activities associated with yachting and yachting activities. With a roster of over 1,300 members, the Erie Yacht Club is one of the largest and oldest privately owned clubs on the Great Lakes. ==Reciprocity== Like most yacht clubs on the Lake Erie, the Erie Yacht Club is a member of the Inter-Lake Yachting Association, which provides reciprocal privileges between members of many other yacht clubs. The Erie Yacht Club has reciprocal relationships with most accredited yacht clubs and is happy to host their visiting members. When reciprocal members wish to visit the Club, they must show their membership card from their Club which confirms that they are a member in good standing and are eligible to be granted guest privileges. The Erie Yacht Club is also a member of the Yachting Club of America and offers reciprocity with their members as well. ==Past Commodores== 1895-1903 George T. Bliss 1904-05 William L.

Harry Vardon won the Championship for the fourth time, six strokes ahead of runner-up Tom Vardon, his younger brother. All entries played 36 holes on the first day with all those within 19 strokes of the leader making the cut and playing 36 holes on the final day, with the additional provision that the final day's field had to contain at least 32 professionals. After the opening round on Wednesday morning, Harry Vardon and defending champion Sandy Herd co-led at 73, three strokes ahead of the rest of the field. In the afternoon, Herd had a poor 83 and Harry Vardon's 77 gave him a four shot lead on 150 ahead of Andrew Scott, despite a seven at the 17th hole. The cut was at 169 and 59 advanced to the final two rounds. Rowland Jones was initially disqualified but later reinstated. In the third round on Thursday morning, Harry Vardon scored 72, having reached the turn in 34. This gave him a seven-stroke lead over Jack White, with Herd and Tom Vardon ten shots behind. In the afternoon, White took a seven at the third hole which effectively gave Harry Vardon the title. Playing cautiously, he eventually finished with a 78. Tom Vardon had the best final round score of 74 and moved into second place ahead of White. == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish - align=leftHarry Vardon  align=left  1896, 1898, 1899  73  77  72  78  300  1 - align=leftSandy Herd  align=left  1902  73  83  76  77  309  4 - align=leftJames Braid   1901  77  79  79  75  310  5 - align=leftJ.H.

Jack White won his only major title, one stroke ahead of runners-up James Braid and J.H. Taylor, both former champions. For the first time, the Open was scheduled for three days; the final day remained at 36 holes, but the first two rounds were now over two days. Those within nineteen strokes of the leader made the 36-hole cut, with the additional provision that the final day's field had to contain at least 32 professionals. The opening round on Wednesday was cold and windy, which led to some high scoring. Robert Thomson led with 75 after reaching the turn in 34. He was a shot ahead of amateur John Graham Jr. and Harry Vardon. It was less windy on Thursday for the second round, and Vardon led on 149, followed by Thomson on 151 and Graham on 152. James Sherlock set a new record for the Open with 71, while Willie Park Jr. scored 72; 52 players were within nineteen strokes of Vardon and made the cut at 168 or better. Overnight rain and light winds made for some low scoring on Friday. Braid set a new Championship record with a 69 in the third round, reaching the turn in 31. White has the second best score with a 72. After the morning round, Braid led on 226 with White on 227; Vardon was at 228 after a disappointing 79. White, one of the early starters in the afternoon, scored 69 for 296. Braid also played well but his 71 left him a shot behind. He holed a long putt at the 15th but a four at the short 16th left him too much to do. Taylor was the last player with a chance to catch White but needed a 67 to do so. Starting 3-3-2, he reached the turn in 32. However, like Braid, he took four at the 16th and also ended up a shot behind. His 68 was another new Open record. White's total of 296 was yet another, the first total under 300. == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish - align=leftJames Braid   1901  77  80  69  71  297  T2 - align=leftJ.H.

All entries played 18 holes on the first two days; those within fourteen strokes of the lead made the cut for the final two rounds on Friday.

Defending champion James Braid won the Championship for the third time, four strokes ahead of runner-up J.H. Taylor. There was no qualifying competition. All entries played 18 holes in pairs on the first two days with all those within 14 strokes of the leader making the cut and playing 36 holes on the final day. The feature of the opening round on Wednesday was the play of the amateurs. John Graham Jr. led with a 71, while Robert Maxwell was amongst those tied for second on 73 with Robert Whitecross and Hugh Watt, both from Dirleton Castle Golf Club, a further shot behind. Taylor and Harry Vardon came to fore in the second round on Thursday. Taylor was out in 41 but came back in 31, despite three-putting the last. Vardon was only a shot worse with a 73. Taylor led on 149, with Vardon and Graham on 150; 72 players were within 14 shots of Taylor and made the cut. Taylor's third round 75 on Friday morning was good enough for him to retain the lead by a stroke over Rowland Jones and three over Braid and Vardon. In the final round that afternoon, Jones scored a disappointing 83 to drop out of contention, while Taylor scored 80 and Vardon 78. Only two players bettered 77, Walter Toogood with a 71 and Braid with a 73, but Toogood was already out of the picture after an 83 in the morning. Needing a 76 for victory, Braid reached the turn in 38 and after more steady play he was left with two fives at the last two holes to win. A putt for a three at the 17th hole secured the victory. == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish - align=leftJames Braid   1901, 1905  77  76  74  73  300  1 - align=leftJ.H.

During this period he wrote nearly 60 comedies, which from 1761 or earlier often brought him into conflict with his rival Goldoni. With a deep hatred for the style of Molière, Chiari made comédie larmoyante fashionable in Italy under the name commedia fiebile.

Hammel (2009) \\"George William Skinner, a biographical memoir.\\" National Academy of Sciences. Skinner was a proponent of the spatial approach to Chinese history, as explained in his Presidential Address to the Association for Asian Studies in 1984. He often referred to his approach as \\"regional analysis,\\" and taught the use of maps as a key class of data in ethnography. ==Early life== Skinner was born on February 14, 1925, in Oakland, California. His father, John James Skinner was a pharmacologist and his mother, Eunice Engle Skinner, taught music and became the director of music education for the Berkeley school system. Skinner spent two years at Deep Springs College, a small college founded to educate small cohorts of young men into the life of the mind in a self-sufficient, disciplined manner. After Deep Springs, he joined the Navy V-12 Program in 1943, then attended the U.S. Navy Oriental Language School for 18 months at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where he studied Chinese. In 1946, Skinner headed for Cornell University to complete his B.A. degree. He graduated in the following year with his B.A. (with distinction) in Far Eastern Studies, and remained there for his Ph.D. in anthropology (1954) under the supervision of Lauriston Sharp. ==Academic career== Skinner’s first job was as instructor in sociology at Cornell in 1949. Late in that year he flew to Chengdu, in China's Sichuan province, to conduct doctoral dissertation research on the structure of markets in the Chengdu Plain. Skinner's research was cut short by the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, which confiscated his notes, but the experience became the basis of his later work on spatial modelling. A copy of his field notes on village life in and around Gaodianzi and pre-revolution Chengdu were later discovered and published in 2017 as Rural China on the Eve of Revolution: Sichuan Fieldnotes, 1949–1950. Skinner proceeded to Bangkok, Thailand, where he researched a substitute doctoral topic, the social structure of the Chinese community in Thailand. This research was published in his first two books, Chinese Society in Thailand (1957) and Leadership and Power in the Chinese Community of Thailand (1958) Between 1951 and 1955, he was field director of the Cornell Southeast Asia Program, then a research associate at Cornell. He became assistant professor of anthropology at Columbia University in 1958. Two years later, Skinner was hired back at Cornell as associate professor and then promoted to full professor in 1962 — an unusually fast track to that status. In 1965, he left for Stanford University, moving again in 1990 to the University of California, Davis, which had hired his wife, China historian Susan L. Mann. Skinner retired from teaching in 2005 but maintained an active research program until his death three years later. ==Research== Perhaps his best-known influence on Chinese Studies was his delineation of the Physiographic macroregions of China.G.W. Skinner (ed.) (1977) \\"The City in Late Imperial China.\\" Stanford University Press.G.W. Skinner (1964–65). \\"Marketing and Social Structure in Rural China.\\" Association for Asian Studies. In later years he was instrumental in the establishment of the China Historical Geographic Information Systems project at Harvard and Fudan Universities. His papers and maps are archived in the library collections of Harvard , Cornell, the University of Washington, and Fudan University. ==Publications== Books and monographs * Report on the Chinese in Southeast Asia.

Arnaud Massy won his only major title, two strokes ahead of runner-up J.H. Taylor. From France, Massy was the first non-Briton to win the Open Championship. Qualifying was introduced for the first time, replacing the 36-hole cut. It took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, 18–19 June, and the 193 entries were divided into two \\"sections,\\" with each playing 36 holes on one day; the leading thirty players and ties from each section qualified. On Tuesday, 34 players scoring 165 or better qualified, led by Massy on 147. In windier conditions on Wednesday, 33 players at 170 or better qualified, led by Taylor on 154. There was some feeling that those in the first section would benefit from the day's rest. In a strong wind on Thursday morning, Massy and Walter Toogood were the co-leaders after the first round at 76, with the next closest score at 79. After the second round that afternoon, Massy led at 157, one stroke over Taylor and Tom Ball, with Tom Williamson and George Pulford a further shot behind. The strong wind persisted into Friday. In the morning, Massy scored 78 while Taylor's 76 gave him a one shot lead. Harry Vardon's 74 was the best round of the championship and moved him into a tie for third place with Pulford and Ball, five strokes behind Taylor. In the afternoon, Massy's 77 earned him the title at 312, two strokes ahead of Taylor, who scored 80 for 314. Taylor had some difficulties on the third hole where he sliced his drive into some long grass and took a seven, going out in 41. He came home in 39, but it wasn't enough to make up for his miscues on the front nine. Massy became the first overseas player to win the Open, while Taylor finished runner-up for the fourth successive time. Vardon's brother, Tom, made a powerful move up the leaderboard with a 75 in the final round to secure a tie for third. == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish - align=leftJ.H.

James Braid won the Championship for the fourth time, eight strokes ahead of runner-up Tom Ball. Qualifying took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, 16–17 June, and the players were divided into two \\"sections.\\" Those in the first section played on the first morning and second afternoon while those in the second section played on the first afternoon and second morning. After the 36 holes the leading thirty players and ties qualified from each section. The qualifying score of 163 was the same in both sections, and 65 players qualified. J.H. Taylor led the first section with a score of 150 while the Scottish amateur Robert Andrew led the second section with the same score. The first round on Thursday morning was noted for its low scoring, especially on the first nine holes. Ernest Gray, from Littlehampton, went out in 31 and equalled J.H. Taylor's record score of 68 set at Royal St George's in 1904. Braid finished with a 70 after going out in 33, with Fred Robson in third place after a 72. Ben Sayers was amongst those in fourth place on 74 after he too went out in 33. In the afternoon Gray was eleven shots worse with a round in 79 while Braid added a 72 to lead by five strokes from Gray with Sandy Herd and David Kinnell a further stroke behind. Braid again played the front nine in 33 and although he took six at the 13th he had a comfortable lead at the end of the day. On Friday morning, Braid began the third round badly. After taking five at the first hole, he followed with an eight at the third. Despite slicing his tee shot into the rough he tried to carry the Cardinal Bunker but failed. His bunker shot hit the sleepers and went out of bounds and, after dropping in the bunker, he hit the sleepers again, this time landing further back in the bunker. He finally escaped the bunker, played a further shot to the green and two-putted for an eight. Under modern rules, he would have scored nine but at the time there was no penalty stroke for \\"out of bounds.\\" After this, he recovered well and finished with a 77, only three strokes worse than the best rounds of the morning. With Gray taking 83 and Herd coming back in 45, Braid, on 219, had extended his lead to six strokes over Ball and Ted Ray. Braid had a final round of 72, the best of the afternoon to win by eight shots. His total of 291 was an Open Championship record, beating Jack White's 296 in 1904. After poor scores on the first day, Harry Vardon and Taylor were amongst the best scorers on the second day and finished in ties for fifth and seventh places. == Past champions in the field == {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish - align=leftJames Braid   1901, 1905, 1906  70  72  77  72  291  1 - align=leftSandy Herd  align=left  1902  74  74  79  75  302  4 - align=leftHarry Vardon  align=left  1896, 1898, 1899, 1903  79  78  74  75  306  T5 - align=leftJ.H.

J.H. Taylor won the Championship for the fourth time, six strokes ahead of runners-up Tom Ball and James Braid. Royal Cinque Ports had been added as the sixth course on the Open rota at a meeting in November 1907 at which meeting it was decided it would host in 1909. The meeting also agreed that the Championship was to be played in England and Scotland alternately. Qualifying took place over 36 holes on Tuesday and Wednesday, 8–9 June. The 204 players were divided into two \\"sections\\" and those in the first played on the first morning and second afternoon, while those in the second section played on the first afternoon and second morning. The leading thirty players and ties from each section qualified, with the additional provision that each section had to contain at least thirty professionals. The second section finished their qualifying first with Tom Ball, Harold Hilton and Ted Ray leading on 150. Thirty players scored 159 or better, but this included three amateurs and so the five players on 160 also qualified. Charles Mayo led the first section on 146. Thirty players scored 160 or better, but this included three amateurs, so the four on 161 qualified. Thus a total of 69 players qualified; 63 professionals and six amateurs. Charles Johns opened at 72 and led after the first round on Thursday morning, with J. Piper second on 73 and Taylor and Ball a stroke behind. Taylor had the best score in the afternoon and led after the first day on 147, a stroke ahead of Johns, with Ball back on 149 and Sandy Herd on 151; Piper faded badly with an 85 for 157. On Friday morning, Taylor scored 74, only bettered by a 73 by Braid. Taylor's lead over Ball was extended to four with Braid and Johns a further two behind. In the afternoon, Taylor had another steady round of 74 for 295. After eight holes, Ball was two better than Taylor at the same point but he eventually finished six shots behind Taylor on 301, tied with Braid with Johns a further stroke behind. Cinque Ports was scheduled to host again in 1915, but World War I intervened; it was the site of the first Open after the war, in 1920. ==Course== { style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:100%;\\" !Hole!!Yards!!!!Hole!!Yards - 1318rowspan=10 E6E8FA;\\" 10375 - 237611473 - 347612162 - 415013400 - 547514195 - 628215417 - 738316483 - 848017372 - 935018414 -  Out3,290 In3,291 - colspan=2 align=leftSource: colspan=2Total 6,581 } == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish - align=leftJ.H.

James Braid won the championship for the fifth time, four strokes ahead of Sandy Herd, the 1902 champion. There was no qualifying competition; all 210 entries played 18 holes in pairs on the first two days with the top sixty and ties advancing for the final 36 holes on the third day. Prize money was increased by £10 with the addition of £5 prizes for seventh and eighth places. Play started on Tuesday, 21 June, but an early afternoon thunderstorm flooded many of the greens and play was cancelled. It was decided that all existing scores would not count and that the Championship would start again on Wednesday and extend to Friday. After the first round, George Duncan led with 73, a stroke ahead of Willie Watt and Robert Thomson. The leaderboard changed significantly during the second round on Thursday with Duncan shooting 77, while Watt and Thomson took 82 and 85. The midway leader was Willie Smith, then a professional in Mexico City, who shot 71 for 148. Braid was a stroke back on 149 with Duncan third on 150. The cut was at 161 or better and 64 players advanced for the final day. Duncan's 71 on Friday morning gave him the 54-hole lead, two strokes ahead of Braid with Herd and Ted Ray a further four shots behind. Duncan's 83 in the afternoon dropped him to third place and gave Braid a comfortable victory with Herd second.

Harry Vardon won the Championship for the fifth time in a playoff over Arnaud Massy, the 1907 champion. There was no qualifying event and with 226 entries it was not possible for all the players to play 18 holes on the same day. The players were therefore divided into three \\"sections,\\" with the first 36 holes played over three days. Sections A and B played their first rounds on Monday, while section C played on Tuesday morning. Section A played their second rounds that afternoon, while sections B and C played their second rounds on Wednesday. By the start of the first round, the number of participants had been reduced to 222, with four withdrawals. On Monday, Michael Moran of Section B had the best round at 72. On Tuesday morning, the players in Section C discovered that a number of the holes had been moved since the first day. Later in the day a letter of protest was drawn up by a group of professionals and presented to the authorities: \\"To the Committee of the Championship, 1911 - Gentlemen, we the undersigned competitors at this Championship meeting respectfully protest against the alteration of the course during the qualifying (sic) rounds.\\" Play was somewhat easier on the second morning and amateur Edward Blackwell led at 71, with joining Moran with 72. At the end of Tuesday, only Section A had completed 36 holes, and Ted Ray led at 148. The Committee replied to the professionals, \\"The Green Committee consider that in deciding to cut fresh holes each day they had adopted the best course possible under the terms of the competition, which were exceptional owing to the large entry, and though they regret that there was any dissatisfaction amongst the players, they decided that the protest could not be upheld.\\" New holes were again cut on the third morning, so that Sections B and C played their second round to different holes to Section A. The second round was completed on Wednesday evening, and George Duncan led the field at 144, four ahead of Ray, Taylor, and Vardon. The leading sixty players and ties advanced for the final 36 holes on Thursday; the cut was at 162 and 73 players advanced, with fifteen players on the number. Duncan had a poor third round of 83 in the morning, which left Vardon with a three-shot lead over Sandy Herd, Taylor, and Massy. Vardon was among the early starters in the afternoon and scored 80 for 303. Amateur Harold Hilton reached the turn in 33, but took 43 for the last nine and finished a shot behind. Massy needed a four at the difficult final hole to tie; he reached the green with two woods and two-putted to force a 36-hole playoff with Vardon on Friday. Massy led the playoff after ten holes, but a six at the 14th and a disastrous seven at 17 put Vardon ahead by five after the first round. The lead extended to seven after 27 holes and ten after 34 holes. After Vardon reached the green in two at the 35th and Massy was in thick rough after two shots, Massy picked up his ball and conceded. ==Coronation Match== The Championship was preceded by a \\"Coronation Match\\" between teams of amateurs and professionals at Royal St George's on Saturday 24 June. The match was in celebration of the coronation of George V on 22 June. The match consisted of 9 foursomes matches, each over 36 holes. The result was an for the professionals.

A perennial candidate, he served in elected office during the 1972 Montana Constitutional Convention. He ran for several political offices on various party tickets, including those of the Democratic Party and the Green Party. He was the 2008 Republican Party nominee for the United States Senate. Kelleher espoused a mix of left-and-right-wing political views. He was best known for advocating that the United States adopt a Parliamentary system of government. He was a strong pro-life advocate, and also favored single-payer health care. Starting in 1964, Kelleher ran for public office 16 times, including a bid for the Presidency in 1976, where he made the ballot in New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Georgia. He was a major party nominee, on the Democratic party ticket, for the U.S. House of Representatives in the former Montana District 2 (\\"Eastern District\\") in 1968. In June 2008, he won a surprise victory in a five-way primary election on the Republican ticket to be chosen as the nominee to face incumbent U.S. Senator Max Baucus. It was his second run against Baucus, whom he also challenged in the 2002 Senate race on the Green party ticket (2.3%). He also ran for the U.S. Senate in 1988. In the 2008 United States Senate election in Montana, he got 27% of the vote against Baucus. He was snubbed by the GOP post-nomination and received no funding, Kelleher took many positions that were highly unorthodox by GOP standards, such as favoring more liberal drug control policies, supporting universal healthcare and affirmative action, and favoring fair trade restrictions. Erik Iverson, chairman of the Montana Republican Party, said, \\"Bob's ideology, with the exception that he's pro- life, doesn't even remotely resemble the platform of the Montana Republican Party.\\" Kelleher died May 29, 2011, in Billings, Montana, a practicing lawyer until his death. ==See also== * 2008 United States Senate election in Montana ==References * The Daily Show program on 2002 Senate race which includes an interview with Kelleher * Category:Politicians from Butte, Montana Category:1923 births Category:Candidates in the 1976 United States elections Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Candidates in the 2002 United States elections Category:Candidates in the 2008 United States elections Category:21st-century American politicians Category:2011 deaths Category:Montana Greens Category:Montana Republicans Category:Montana Democrats Category:Montana lawyers ","title":"Bob Kelleher"},{"id":"19232817","text":"The 1912 Open Championship was the 52nd Open Championship, held 24–25 June at Muirfield in Gullane, East Lothian, Scotland.

Vardon won a record sixth the following year, the last Open victory for the three players. ==Course == {class= !Hole!!Name!!Yards!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards - align=center1Coursealign=center420E6E8FA;\\" rowspan=10  align=center10Deealign=center400 - align=center2Roadalign=center330 align=center11Alpsalign=center190 - align=center3Longalign=center490align=center12Hilbrealign=center355 - align=center4Newalign=center155align=center13Rushesalign=center130 - align=center5Telegraphalign=center410align=center14Fieldalign=center485 - align=center6Briarsalign=center365align=center15Lakealign=center440 - align=center7Dowiealign=center200 align=center16Dunalign=center510 - align=center8Faralign=center480 align=center17Royalalign=center360 - align=center9Punch Bowlalign=center380 align=center18Standalign=center400 -  colspan=2 align=centerOutalign=center3,210 colspan=2 align=centerInalign=center3,270 - colspan=4Source: colspan=2 align=centerTotalalign=center6,480 } == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish - align=leftJ.H.

Harry Vardon won a record sixth Open Championship title, three strokes ahead of runner-up J.H. Taylor, the defending champion. Entering the championship, Vardon, Taylor, and James Braid had five Open wins each. This was the sixteenth and final Open title for these three, the Great Triumvirate. Due to World War I, it was the last Open for six years; the next was in 1920. Qualification took place the week before on 11−12 June at Troon, with 18 holes on the Old Course and 18 holes on Troon municipal number 2, and exactly 100 players qualified. Taylor and Ted Ray, winners of the last two Opens, led the field on 150 and 96 players at 163 or better advanced. The thirteen at 164 played an additional 18 holes at Prestwick the next day to determine the final four places; scores of 79 and better qualified. After the first two rounds on Thursday, Vardon led at 150, by one shot ahead of a relatively unknown James Ockenden from West Drayton Golf Club. Taylor was a shot back in third at 152. One shot back after an opening 74, Braid's 82 in the afternoon dropped him into a tie for ninth. Vardon and Taylor were paired together on Friday and, after Ockenden had a disappointing 83, they were clear leaders after the morning's third round. Taylor led on 226 with Vardon two back; amateur James Jenkins was third on 232 and three were tied at 233. With the two leaders playing together, huge crowds followed in the final round that afternoon. Taylor extended his lead to three at the first hole, but at the third, he was distracted by a photographer and dropped a stroke to Vardon. The championship was largely decided at the fourth hole, where Taylor found the water and took seven to Vardon's four, which changed the lead. Taylor dropped more strokes to Vardon at the 5th, 8th, 10th, and 11th holes and Vardon led by five. Taylor recovered somewhat and shot 83, but Vardon won by three shots at 78 for 306. Phil Gaudin had the best score in the final round at 74. This was the penultimate Open at Prestwick, which hosted 24, including the first twelve; the last was eleven years later in 1925. It was replaced by adjacent Troon Golf Club (\\"Royal Troon\\" since 1978) as the Open venue for southwestern Scotland. Turnberry was added to the rota in 1977, southwest of Prestwick. == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish - align=leftHarry Vardon  align=left  1896, 1898, 1899, 1903, 1911  73  77  78  78  306  1 - align=leftJ.H.

The CSE has created a platform to convene the many disciplinary facets of the IIT colleges with business, community and government stakeholders in focused initiatives dedicated to making Chicago a sustainable city. ==History== The CSE was founded in 2000 and operates with funding on a project-by-project basis. The center has also hosted numerous seminars on environmental and sustainability issues, as well as several national and international conferences. Projects conducted by the CSE have included a form of life cycle analysis for a small Chicago company manufacturing floor maintenance products, a geographic information system (GIS) research project for two subsidiaries of Exelon, and a life cycle assessment (LCA) on a new product for S. C. Johnson. In 2006, the Center for Sustainable Enterprise became a founding member of the Chicago Sustainable Business Alliance (CSBA), a 150-member organization dedicated to sustainability and sustainable networking in the city of Chicago. ==Mission== The primary mission of the CSE is the identification, development, communication and implementation of practical and equitable business strategies that advance the ecological sustainability of the Chicago metropolitan Area. By expanding on traditional business and enterprise models, the center has developed strategies that look beyond conventional metrics and engage the entire business in valuing and enhancing the capital of its enterprise. The CSE developed a tool called ‘’total asset management’’ which analyses financial, physical, human and natural forms of capital. By incorporating this concept, businesses can assess and align the capital that they directly affect or influence and create a path forward into a more sustainable future. Envisioning new paradigms that appreciate all these forms of capital creates added value for the company. Another tool created by the CSE, ‘’the comprehensive enterprise models’’ helps businesses and communities, represented by both and government and non-government organizations, rethink their relationships and construct a more balanced and sustainable paradigm. ==Principal activities== While specific projects depend on the interests of participants, the community and funding support, the CSE performs the following activities: * Common Ground: The CSE serves as a forum where groups can collaborate to remove barriers to achieving ecological and economic sustainability while learning, teaching and sharing the elements of sustainable enterprise. * Executive Education: Educate, sensitize and empower key corporate executives/managers and small/medium business owners with practical and equitable business strategies that foster ecological and economic sustainability. * Educational Support: Provide sustainable enterprise instruction, curricula and internship projects to university-based programs and community colleges in the Chicago Area. * Commercial Applications of Research: provide the platform for quick and efficient transfers of university-based research and proven industry-based applications to companies, especially small and medium enterprises. * Focused Business Support: Work with existing businesses and organizations to develop the tools for success in an emerging, sustainable economy. * New Business Development: Incubate start-up companies that promote sustainable environmental technologies and practices. * Research: Gather data on current use of elements of sustainability and develop reliable metrics and feedback loops that demonstrate the benefits related to the use of sustainable strategies. * Information Sharing: Expand the benefits of the learning and teaching efforts of the center by sharing the systems, methods, and technologies developed through the center with other organizations and businesses, locally and nationally. ==Initiatives== As part of its purpose of expanding on traditional business and enterprise models, the center has participated in several projects and initiatives with small companies, local government, and other corporations. ===Continuing Educational Programs=== As part of its educational outreach program, the center offers seminars for universities and colleges focusing on curriculum development and collaboration for small to medium enterprises with a focus on team development, and for large corporations with a focus on functional area leaders. ===Wind Turbine=== In 2003 the center installed a highly efficient small wind turbine on a temporary basis in front of the Field Museum of Natural History, located in Chicago, to validate wind tunnel performance data. The turbine will demonstrate how it can provide a supplemental-energy system for the metropolitan areas. ===Remote Hybrid Unit=== The CSE is collaborating with a local Chicago company to introduce to the Midwest a unique lighting and security system operating on wind and solar energy – completely off the grid. This remote hybrid unit is an 18-foot light post with a security camera option. ===Implementing Educational Programs=== The CSE is working with the National Technical University of Athens to introduce a Master of Science in Sustainability for the Greek, balkan and middle-east markets. ===Urban Timber=== Urban timber represents an alternative paradigm to current forestry and landscape practices. The CSE has proposed a plan to the city of Chicago, Department of the Environment promoting the development of an urban timber selection, management and harvesting scheme that provides multiple benefits to the community, the environment, the economy, and the managing enterprise through the entire lifecycle of the trees. ===Next Generation CO2 Emission Reduction Metrics=== The CSE provides an evaluation of the footprint of a product and the carbon dioxide and CO2 equivalents related to its manufacture, use and final disposition. ===Chicago Sustainable Business Alliance=== As a founding member of a 150-member organization dedicated to sustainability, the CSE hosts monthly networking meetings and seminars. ==References== * https://web.archive.org/web/20080912050436/http://csba.foresightdesign.org//featured/cse/index.php * https://web.archive.org/web/20090125095602/http://csba.foresightdesign.org/members/member_detail.php?mid=31 * https://web.archive.org/web/20071004031051/http://www.is4ie.org/images/Nassos_and_Kusz.pdf * http://www.lmawma.org/index_files/newsletter2003Q2WindTurbine.pdf ==External links== * Stuart School of Business * MS in Environmental Management and Sustainability * Illinois Institute of Technology * Sustainable Enterprise: Strategies for the 21st Century and beyond * Chicago Sustainable Business Alliance Category:Illinois Institute of Technology Category:Sustainability organizations ","title":"Center for Sustainable Enterprise"},{"id":"19232867","text":"Title page from Basilica chymica, Oswald Croll, Franckfurt: Bey Gottfried Tampachen, 1629. Oswald Croll or Crollius (c. 1563 – December 1609) was an alchemist, and professor of medicine at the University of Marburg in Hesse, Germany. A strong proponent of alchemy and using chemistry in medicine, he was heavily involved in writing books and influencing thinkers of his day towards viewing chemistry and alchemy as two separate fields.Allen G. Debus, The Chemical Philosophy: Paracelsian Science and Medicine in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (New York: Science History Publications, 1977), vol. 1, pp. 117-126 Croll received his doctorate in medicine in 1582 at Marburg, then continued studies at Heidelberg, Strasburg, and Geneva. After working as a tutor, he arrived in Prague in 1597. He remained there for two years, and again from 1602 until his death.Mark Haeffner. Dictionary of Alchemy: From Maria Prophetessa to Isaac Newton. p.94 There, through Rudolf II, he came into contact with other alchemical writers such as Edward Kelley. In 1608, Croll's opus magnum \\"Basilica Chymica\\" (\\"Chemical Basilica\\") was first published, self-described as containing a philosophick description, confirmed by the experience of [Croll's] own labours, and application of the choicest chymical remedies drawn from the light of Nature and of Grace.Stanislas Klossowski de Rola. The Golden Game: Alchemical Engravings of the Seventeenth Century. 1988. p. 157. It is a hefty summary of his researches, methods of preparation, and studies into chemical medicine or iatrochemistry. In 1609 his treatise \\"De signatura rerum\\" (\\"Treatise of signatures\\") was published. Some of his work pushed for the understanding and recognition of chemical compounds and medicinal value of herbs and other processes first put forth by Paracelsus.Owen Hannaway, The Chemists and the Word: The Didactic Origins of Chemistry (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1975). It also discussed matters such as compound remedies, chemical organization and acted as an introduction to chemistry in later years. The second book covered alchemy's and chemistry's relation to other fields of science, especially botany, suggesting the use of the doctrine of signatures to determine the medical property of plants. Croll died suddenly in 1609. His reputation and influence grew after his death, and was noted by Robert Burton in his Anatomy of Melancholy.Peter Marshall. The Theatre of the World. Alchemy, Astrology and Magic in Renaissance Prague. p.131 In 1618, Croll was deemed one of alchemy’s heroes in Johann Daniel Mylius’ Basilica Philosophica (1618 - Opus Medico- Chymicum, third book). An emblematic seal dedicated to him appears in this work alongside the motto: == Alchemical studies == Croll believed that chemistry and alchemy were two halves of a tightly related field, in the same way that organic and inorganic chemistry are related. He used the framework of Parcelsus' works to organize his beliefs about the geometrically important relationships between various forms of matter and alchemical reactions, from rectangles to megagons.Arthur Greenberg, 2007.

The show is a spin-off of Coast. ==Production== The series was produced by the BBC Natural History Unit for the Open University. ==Reception== Chris Lambert writing in The Times introduced this, \\"entertaining new eight-part series\\", and commended guest, David Attenborough, \\"who, with trademark infectious enthusiasm, reveals his early passion for fossil hunting\\". Emily Ford said that, \\"Palaeontologists probably still curse Ross from Friends for giving their profession a reputation of such yawn- inducing dullness, but you don’t have to be a prehistory nut to enjoy fossils\\". \\"And you can see David Attenborough get all misty-eyed as he caresses the vertebrae of a long-lost Diplodocus.\\" Anna Lowman writing about episode two in The Guardian commended it as a \\"quirky documentary,\\" and a \\"cosy Open University-produced programme,\\" with the, \\"Fossil Detectives (apparently comprising just one very enthusiastic lady)\\". Nancy Banks-Smith went on to say, \\"there is nothing that would not be improved by the addition of a dinosaur\\", adding, \\"which is why David Attenborough said that he would like to be back in the time of the dinosaurs. 'To film it', he added, brightening visibly.

The project was initiated by the 3's global handset team, some of whom later went on to found the new mobile phone company INQ. The phones were sold in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Italy, Ireland, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Macau, but the service has now been discontinued.When connecting to http://mobile.three.co.uk/help/net/skype from a Three phone (page not available from outside the Three network), the following message is displayed: Skype-on-Three has been withdrawn by Skype. If you try to log into Skype-on- Three you may see this message: \\"Sorry, we can’t connect you right now. Please try again later.\\" Please ignore this message, Skype-on-Three has been withdrawn and will not be available later. 3 offered 4000 free Skype outbound voice minutes with the phones. Initially, the quota expired after 90 days (30 days in Ireland) unless the user purchased another topup or was on a pay monthly plan. This restriction was lifted by the network in 2009, where calls could still be made and received without the need to \\"top up\\" with credit. The service was advertised as \\"unlimited\\" in the UK; however, it is subject to fair use limitations, as in other countries. The Skypephone series of phones supported UMTS/W-CDMA 2100 MHz, GSM and GPRS (900/1800 MHz), as well as HSDPA with the 3 Skypephone S2. The Skypephone series used the normal 3G or GSM voice network for handling Skype calls, which permitted users to make Skype calls within 3's 3G network or when the user is out of range of the 3G network and is roaming on one of 3's partner 2G networks. The two Skypephone models were not unique in using normal GSM or 3G voice protocols for handling Skype: Three's Symbian and Java ME-based Skype clients also did this, but they did also need a data connection for low-bandwidth communication with Three's servers while the voice call is being set up. All other mobile Skype applications (such as Skype for iPhone) use a GPRS, EDGE or 3G packet data connection to handle Skype. The Skype application used was native to the 3 Skypephone series and is a Brew application, whereas other mobile Skype clients are 3rd-party downloads and are either Symbian or Java ME based (the latter is now defunct). An advantage of using the standardized 3GPP circuit- switched (CS) voice protocols for handling calls is that it does not require a constant GPRS, EDGE, 3G or WiFi data connection, all of which consume significantly more battery life than CS voice. The 3 Skypephone series used a USB connector for recharging and Phone-to-PC communication – allowing them to recharge when plugged into a computer. Phone-to-PC connections are also possible over Bluetooth. == Devices == * 3 Skypephone S1 *3 Skypephone S2 == Usage terms == Free Skype-to-Skype calls and instant messages were only available in the country where the phone was purchased, or while roaming on 3’s sister networks. Skype-to-Skype calls and instant messages were subject to a fair use policy of 4,000 minutes of outgoing calls and 10,000 instant messages per month (depending on country). For 3 Pay As You Go customers, the Skype functionality was subject to activating a minimum top-up (value depending on country) and valid for 90 days (30 days in Ireland) from activating their last top-up, but 3 removed the minimum top-up requirement on 1 May 2009. ==INQ== The Skypephone project was a collaborative effort, with the 3's global handset team working closely with Skype and Qualcomm. According to Skype, the Skypephone series, if it were to continue, could possibly be continued on a different network from 3.

The prison is run by Her Majesty's Prison Service. ==History== H.M. Prison Askham Grange was opened in January 1947 as a women's open prison and was the first such prison in the country. The first Governor of H.M.P. Askham Grange was Anglo-Irish penal reformer Mary Size, who remained in post from January 1947 until her retirement from the prison service in September 1952. Mrs. Joanna Kelley was Governor from October 1952 until 1959, when she moved on to become Governor of Holloway and later Assistant Director of Prisons (Women). She was replaced by Marguerite Stocker who remained until her retirement in 1966. In 1973 Susan McCormick was appointed Governor at Askham Grange, becoming (at 28) \\"the youngest ever governor or warden of a women's prison in Britain.\\" McCormick went on to introduce programmes of rehabilitation in the prison for soon-to-be released prisoners (a relatively new idea at the time). In 1979, two inmates, Jenny Hicks and Jackie Holborough, founded the Clean Break (theatre company) at Askham Grange. Today Clean Break is a theatre, education and new writing company that works with women whose lives have been affected by the criminal justice system. The group now have links with most women's prisons in the UK. In 1997 the prison was the subject of the documentary Witness: Babies Behind Bars shown on Channel 4. In 2001 two inmates from Askham Grange launched a High Court battle for the right to keep their babies with them in prison beyond the age of 18 months. The challenge failed, but launched a wider debate in the media about mother's rights and their children in prison. ==The prison today== Askham Grange accepts adult females and female young offenders, and has space for ten mothers to maintain full-time care of their child or children whilst in custody. Inmates tend to have already served three years or more in other prisons, and are transferred to Askham Grange to complete the last part (maximum three years) of their sentence. Because of this the prison's main focus is the re-integration and re-settlement of prisoners into the community and preparation for life after prison. Accommodation in the prison consists mainly of dormitories, though there are some single rooms. All prisoners in the Mother and Baby unit have their own rooms. The prison's education department mainly concentrates on vocational skills, and many prisoners are given work-placements outside the prison as part of their re- settlement plan. The Prison has an external Garden Centre and Coffee Shop (The Grange Coffee Shop and Garden Centre) which is open to the general public seven days a week as well as a Conference Centre, all of which are operated by the residents to give them the skills to prepare for release. ==Notable former inmates== * Tracie Andrews, convicted of murder for stabbing her fiancé Lee Harvey to death * Mary Bell, the infamous child killer served out the last of her sentence at Askham Grange before being released in 1980. * Helen John, a peace campaigner, was held at Askham Grange for criminal damage whilst standing against Tony Blair in the UK 2001 General Election in his Sedgefield constituency ==References * Ministry of Justice pages on HMP Askham Grange *HMP Askham Grange - HM Inspectorate of Prisons Reports * The Grange Coffee Shop and Garden Centre Category:Prisons in North Yorkshire Category:Women's prisons in England Category:Young Offender Institutions in England ","title":"HM Prison Askham Grange"},{"id":"19233048","text":"Coachella Valley Preserve, in the Colorado Desert The Deserts of California have unique ecosystems and habitats, a sociocultural and historical \\"Old West\\" collection of legends, districts, and communities, and they also form a popular tourism region of dramatic natural features and recreational development.

The Mojave Desert is bounded by the Tehachapi Mountains on the northwest, the San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mountains on the south, and extends eastward to California's borders with Arizona and Nevada; it also forms portions of northwest Arizona. The Colorado Desert lies in the southeastern corner of the state, between the Colorado River and the Transverse Ranges, and continues into Mexico and Arizona to the south and east, (as the named Sonoran Desert). The Great Basin desert lies immediately to the east of the Sierra Nevada cordillera and extends eastward into the state of Nevada. The deserts encompass all of Imperial County, the southern and eastern portion of Inyo County, the Eastern portions of Mono County, Los Angeles County, Kern County, San Diego County, and Riverside County, and most of northern and eastern San Bernardino County. The major urban populations of western San Diego County, Orange County, the Inland Empire, and Greater Los Angeles are over the high mountains toward the Pacific Ocean. ===Mojave Desert=== The topographical boundaries include the Tehachapi Mountains to the northwest, together with the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountain ranges to the south. The mountain boundaries are quite distinct since they are outlined by the two largest faults in California - the San Andreas Fault and the Garlock Fault. The Mojave Desert in California includes the colloquially-defined High Desert region. The Great Basin shrub steppe lies to the north of the Mojave Desert; the warmer Sonoran Desert and its subregion the Colorado Desert lie to the south and east. Desert landscape in the Mojave Desert ===Colorado Desert=== The Colorado Desert is a northwesterly part of the larger Sonoran Desert, which extends across southwest North America. The Colorado Desert region encompasses approximately , reaching from the Northwest Mexico border region in the south to the higher-elevation Mojave Desert in the north and from the Colorado River in the east to the Laguna Mountains of the Peninsular Ranges in the west. The area includes the heavily irrigated Coachella, Palo Verde, and Imperial Valleys. The Sonoran/Colorado Desert in California includes the colloquially- defined Low Desert region. ===Great Basin Desert=== The Great Basin Desert is the only \\"cold\\" desert in the country, where most precipitation falls in the form of snow. The Great Basin Desert exists because of the \\"rainshadow effect\\" created by the Sierra Nevada of eastern California. When prevailing winds from the Pacific Ocean rise to go over the Sierra, the air cools and loses most of its moisture as rain. By the time the winds cross over the mountains and sweep down the far side, they are very dry and absorb moisture from the surrounding area. This drying effect is responsible for creating the Great Basin Desert. ==Ecology and climate== The desert region of California is characterized by low rainfall, caused by the rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west of the desert region. The Mojave Desert receives from of rain per year, while the Colorado Desert receives from . The driest spot in California is Death Valley, which averages of precipitation per year. The soils of California deserts also tend to be alkaline, which adds to the stress of drought on plants. Joshua trees are characteristic of the Mojave Desert The Mojave Desert is considered a high desert, because elevations can range up to . The Mojave Desert is characterized by the presence of Yucca brevifolia, the Joshua Tree, which as an indicator species of the Mojave Desert, extends southeasterly into Mohave County, Arizona, and even further, all parts of northwest Arizona. Other common plants of the Mojave Desert include creosote bush, blackbrush, greasewood and saltbush. Higher elevations host Western juniper and Pinyon pine. The Colorado Desert is a low desert, with elevations running from above sea level. Unlike the other California deserts, the Colorado Desert gets significant rain from the North American Monsoon in August and September. The Colorado Desert hosts saguaro cactus, Sonoran creosote bush, and Salton Sea saltbush. The Great Basin desert in California can also reach up to of elevation. Plants in the Great Basin Desert are well adapted to the harsh conditions. These plants include Big sagebrush, Pinyon pine, Utah juniper, Low sagebrush, Shadscale, and Bristlecone pine. Sagebrush, a very common resident of the Great Basin, is well adapted to the area. The Big sagebrush root system can extend as much as 90 feet in circumference. This adaptation allows the plant to catch as much water as possible when the rains do come. Mormon tea possesses modified leaves. The leaves are very small and are not the primary area for photosynthesis. The chlorophyll filled stems carry out the primary photosynthesis. Four-wing saltbush excretes salt through its leaves to prevent build-up of lethal salts in the plant. The plants on the alkaline flats have a high internal concentration of salt and are able to extract water other plants can not. Common animals of the California deserts include the desert bighorn sheep, desert kit fox, coyote, spotted skunk, spotted bat, black-tailed jackrabbit, ground squirrels, kangaroo rat, white-footed mouse, and desert tortoise. ==History== Before the European exploration of North America, tribes of Native Americans, such as the Mohave (in the Mojave desert), the Chemehuevi (in the Great Basin desert), and the Quechan (in the Colorado desert) were hunter-gatherers living in the California deserts. European explorers started exploring the deserts beginning in the 18th century. Francisco Garcés, a Franciscan friar, was the first explorer of the Colorado and Mojave deserts in 1776. Garcés recorded information about the original inhabitants of the deserts. Later, as American interests expanded into California, American explorers started probing the California deserts. Jedediah Smith travelled through the Great Basin and Mojave deserts in 1826, finally reaching the San Gabriel Mission. John C. Frémont explored the Great Basin, proving that water did not flow out of it to the ocean, and provided maps that the forty-niners used to get to California. The California Gold Rush jumpstarted economic activity in the California deserts. Mining for silver, gold, and lead became important in both the Mojave and the Great Basin deserts. Mining stimulated the creation of transportation systems, such as the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad. ==Tourism== Badwater Basin elevation sign In 1994, the California Desert Protection Act protected millions of acres within the Death Valley and Joshua Tree National Parks and the Mojave National Preserve. Within these parks and preserves, visitors can view unique landscapes, plants, and animals.

The leaves are often confused with betel, but they lack the intense taste of the betel leaves and are significantly smaller. Piper lolot (lolot) is now known to be the same species. Under this name it is cultivated for its leaf which is used in Lao and Vietnamese cuisine as a flavoring wrap for grilling meats, namely the thịt bò nướng lá lốt in Vietnam. ==Names== There is no \\"official\\" English name for it, but it is sometimes called wild betel. It is known as chaphlu (, ) or cha phlu (, ) in Thai; phak i leut or pak eelerd (ຜັກອີ່ເລີດ) in Lao; and pokok kadok in Malay. In Vietnam, the local name of Piper lolot - lá lốt - is applied to P. sarmentosum also. It is also known as lolot pepper. In Vietnamese it is called lá lốt (or sometimes in the South lá lốp). In Khmer, it is called japloo ចាព្លូ (or jeeploo ជីរភ្លូ), in Thai chaphloo ชะพลู, in Lao phak ee lert ຜັກອີ່ເລີດ (or phak nang lert ຜັກນາງເລີດ). thumb ==Description== This plant is a perennial herb with creeping rhizomes, and a striped stem that grow to 40 cm high. Its leaves are thin, heart-shaped, and 8–10 cm long and 8–11 cm wide, with 5 main veins from the base of the blade, oil glands on the upper surface, and finely pubescent veins on its under side. Its petioles are 2.5–3 cm long. Erect white spikes of 1–2 cm long emerge at the axils. ==Geographic distribution== P. sarmentosum is found from the tropical areas of Southeast Asia, Northeast India and South China, and as far as the Andaman Islands. Living collections of this taxon from the Andaman Islands is under ex situ conservation outside the islands at the Field Gene Bank of Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute, Trivandrum, India. It is a pre-tsunami accession. ==In cuisine== P. sarmentosum leaves are sold in bunches and are usually eaten raw. *In Thai cuisine, the leaves are used to wrap miang kham, a traditional snack; they are also one of the ingredients of the Kaeng khae curry of Northern Thailand.Kaeng Khae Kai (Katurai Chilli Soup with Chicken) The curry is named after these leaves, which are known as khae in Northern Thailand. *In Laotian cuisine, it is eaten as part of a salad. *In Malay cuisine it is shredded for ulam, a type of Malay salad. *In Vietnamese cuisine it is grilled in bò nướng lá lốt, a typical Southern Vietnamese dish. Minced beef is marinated with seasoning, soya sauce and various finely chopped spices such as garlic, onion and lemongrass then wrapped in Piper lolot leaves and grilled, which brings smokey flavor to the beef. It is served with rice noodles, fresh herbs, sliced star fruits and pineapples, and fermented fish sauce mắm nêm The practice of wrapping meat in vine leaves originated in the Middle East, which was taken to India by the Persians. It was subsequently introduced by the Indians to Southeast Asia. However, grape vines do not grow well in tropical climates, so the Vietnamese started to use leaves of lolot instead. It is native to the Indochinese region and recently introduced to the United States by Lao and Vietnamese immigrants. It is also used for medicinal purposes, to relieve a wide range of symptoms from inflammation to snakebites. ==Traditional medicine== P. sarmentosum leaves are used in traditional Asian medicines. Chemical analysis has shown the leaves contain the antioxidant naringenin. Amides from P. sarmentosum fruit have been shown to have anti-tuberculosis and anti-plasmodial activities. ==ReferencesSee also== *Perilla Category:Asian vegetables sarmentosum Category:Flora of tropical Asia Category:Herbal and fungal stimulants Category:Medicinal plants Category:Plants described in 1820 ","title":"Piper sarmentosum"},{"id":"19233137","text":" The Morzh-class submarines were built for the Black Sea Fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy shortly before World War I. ==Background== The class was originally conceived as part of an ambitious programme of naval construction devised by the Naval General Staff in 1909. This envisaged, among other things, the construction of six submarines for the Black Sea Fleet. The procurement was heavily cut back and delayed; in 1910, the Russian State Duma agreed to a portion of the naval plan to reinforce the Black Sea Fleet, including the construction of the six submarines. Three Narval-class submarines were ordered along with three of the new Morzh-class boats. The Narval class was a design developed by the Holland company for Russia. ==Design== The design of the Morzh class was based on , a vessel that was considered to be the most successful of the Russian-designed submarines built to date. The design of the new class was carried out at the Baltic Shipyard under Ivan Grigorevich Bubnov in 1910 and was approved on 30 May 1911, with construction starting at the Nikolayev shipyards on 25 June 1911. The principal objective of the designers was to deliver a high degree of maneuverability and stability. However, aspects of the design provoked controversy, in particular the lack of internal watertight compartments. This issue caused a heated dispute between Russia's submarine engineers and submarine officers; the engineers argued that adding bulkheads would greatly improve the ability to survive of the vessels while the submariners argued that bulkheads put the commander of the ship at risk of losing control of his crew. In the end, financial constraints required the bulkheads to be omitted. The Morzh submarines were well-armed for the time, having a deck gun, four internal torpedo tubes and eight Dzhevetskiy torpedo-launching collars. However, the vessels had numerous shortcomings. They suffered from having only a single hull, lacking bulkheads, having a slow diving time of minutes due to poor ballast tank venting, and a diving depth of only . An additional problem was that twin diesel engines to power the vessels had been ordered from Germany, but were not delivered by the time the war broke out. They had to be replaced by severely underpowered engines from the Amur River gunboats, each of which delivered only . This meant that the designed surface speed could not be attained. The designed underwater speed also could not be attained due to a poorly designed hull shape, which was more like that of a surface vessel than a submarine. Many of these failings were replicated in the more numerous s, built to a design derived from that of the Morzh. ==Ships in class== {  border=\\"1\\" - ! Ship ! Laid down ! Launched !

Nerpa, the largest vessel in the class, was the first to go into action in March 1915, followed by Morzh and Tyulen later that same month. All three vessels operated principally off the Bosporus against German and Ottoman Turkish naval forces, focusing on the chokepoint of many Turkish freighter routes. The three submarines had an eventful war in the Black Sea, sinking 16 merchant ships between them. Morzh narrowly missed the Turkish flagship battlecruiser Yavuz in November 1915 but suffered damage in a Turkish air attack in May 1916. She was sunk with all hands in May 1917 on her 24th patrol as a result of striking a mine, confirmed when wreck discovered in 2002. After 24 patrols Nerpa went into refit in 1917 in Nikolayev but had to be laid up due to a shortage of essential parts and did not rejoin the war effort. The most successful of the three submarines was Tyulen, which made a large number of successful attacks against enemy forces, including the capture of the armed merchantman Rodosto in October 1916. Tyulen and Nerpa survived the war but had very different fates. Tyulen was captured by German troops at Sevastopol in May 1918 and transferred to British control in November 1918. It was passed on to White Russian forces under the command of General Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel, who opposed the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. Following a Bolshevik advance, the vessel fled to Bizerte in French-ruled Tunisia in 1920, where it was interned. The ship was sold in 1924 and scrapped in 1930. Nerpa remained in the shipyard at Nikolayev until 3 June 1922, when it was recommissioned by the Soviet Navy under the new name Politruk (\\"political instructor\\") and in 1923 it was given the designation of No. 11. The vessel was decommissioned on 3 December 1930 and was sold for scrap in February 1931. ==CitationsSources== * * ==External links== * Category:Submarine classes Category:Submarines of the Imperial Russian Navy Category:Wrangel's fleet Category:Russian and Soviet navy submarine classes ","title":"Morzh-class submarine"},{"id":"19233147","text":"Guichenia is a trilobite in the order Phacopida (family Dalmanitidae), that existed during the middle Ordovician in what is now France.

Sports diplomacy may transcend cultural differences and bring people together. The use of sports and politics has had both positive and negative implications over history. Sports competitions or activities have had the intention to bring about change in certain cases. Nationalistic fervour is sometimes linked to victories or losses to some sport on sports fields. While the Olympics is often the biggest political example of using sports for diplomatic means, cricket and association football, as well as other sports in the global arena, have also been used in this regard. In the case of Apartheid, sport was used to isolate South Africa and bring about a major overhaul in the country's social structure. While ethnicity and race can cause division, sports can also help blend differences.Cornell, Stephen and Douglas Hartmann. \\"Ethnicity and Race: Making Identities in a Changing World.\\" p.3 Additionally, numerous athletes have sought political office, some of them unsuccessfully, on either the national level or the sub-national current. ==Association football== In regards to the politics of space and soccer in Europe, soccer has been historically able to simultaneously maintain the differences that give each European country their own sense of identity as well as strengthen the bonds that bind them together as one body. Further, soccer stadiums in Europe have acted as both places of refuge as well as sites of terrorist attacks and political uprisings. According to Benolt, during the period of the Second World War, European Football underwent a massive transformation. With a coinciding sharp rise in popularity at a time of high political intensity, soccer became politicized. Therefore, Benolt argues that soccer began to embody three main characteristics during and after this period, becoming: 1) an agent of international relations in the sense that the foreign policies of European nations became supposedly articulated in soccer; 2) a source of political propaganda via using soccer to expose the state; 3) a tool to pacify constituents. Consequently, all of these factors have contributed to the emergence of soccer and its stadiums as a means of political expression, a basis of recent collective memory, and its emergence as a highly politicized game. While many clubs don't have a fixed political identity, some clubs are known to have clear leanings. According to YouGov statistics, supporters of the English club Sunderland AFC predominantly lean to the political left, and often sing \\"The Red Flag\\" during games. While Sunderland fans are generally regarded as left wing, the hooligan firm Seaburn Casuals was known for having far-right associations. When 26 Seaburn Casuals hooligans were arrested in a police raid before the 1998 FIFA World Cup, some of them were found to be involved with neo-Nazi groups like Combat 18. One of the biggest and oldest football rivalries is the Old Firm rivalry between the Scottish clubs Celtic and Rangers from Glasgow. The competition between the two clubs had roots in more than just a simple sporting rivalry. It has as much to do with Northern Ireland as Scotland and this can be seen in the flags, cultural symbols, and emblems of both clubs. It was infused with a series of complex disputes, sometimes centred on religion (Catholic and Protestant), Northern Ireland- related politics (Loyalist and Republican), national identity (British or Irish Scots), and social ideology (Conservatism and Socialism).Richard Wilson, \\"Inside the Divide\\" (Edinburgh: Canongate Books, 2012), p. 87: \\"What is being asserted is two identities: Rangers and Celtic. There are other boundaries: Protestant and Catholic / Unionist and Republican / Conservative and Socialist....\\" The majority of Rangers and Celtic supporters do not get involved in sectarianism, but serious incidents do occur with a tendency for the actions of a minority to dominate the headlines. The Old Firm rivalry fuelled many assaults on Derby days, and some deaths in the past have been directly related to the aftermath of Old Firm matches. An activist group that monitors sectarian activity in Glasgow has reported that on Old Firm weekends, violent attacks increase ninefold over normal levels. An increase in domestic abuse can also be attributed to Old Firm fixtures. ==Bandy== Norway declined to take part in the 1957 Bandy World Championship because the Soviet Union was invited, due to the Soviet invasion of Hungary the year before. The country made a similar protest for the 1969 Bandy World Championship because of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that year, handing over the hosting of the 1969 event to Sweden. Ukraine declined to take part in the 2015 Bandy World Championship hosted by Russia because of the Russian annexation of Crimea the year before, since Ukraine still considers Crimea as part of its territory. ==Boxing== Heavyweight champion Max Schmeling had been lauded by the Nazi Party as a heroic symbol of German destiny and Aryan supremacy. A politically charged boxing match with Joe Louis was preceded nationalistic symbolism and imagery. Schmeling defeated Louis, for the latter's first professional defeat in 1936. Langston Hughes recalled the national reaction to Louis' defeat. Schmeling was, however, welcomed home with a jubilant reaction. Hitler sent his wife flowers with the message: \\"For the wonderful victory of your husband, our greatest German boxer, I must congratulate you with all my heart.\\" Schmeling responded to the accolades saying: \\"At this moment I have to tell Germany, I have to report to the Führer in particular, that the thoughts of all my countrymen were with me in this fight; that the Führer and his faithful people were thinking of me. This thought gave me the strength to succeed in this fight. It gave me the courage and the endurance to win this victory for Germany's colours.\\"David Margolick, \\"Beyond Glory.\\" A rematch was scheduled later in New York City. In the build-up to the event U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt offered his support: \\"Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat Germany.\\" Schmeling's hotel was picketed by American protestors after an accompanying Nazi Party publicist declared that a black man could not defeat Schmeling and that when he won, his prize money would be used to build German tanks.Dettloff, William. \\"The Louis-Schmeling Fights: Prelude to War.\\" Louis won the rematch in a first round knock out and he became the focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to World War II. Louis later recalled the pressure on him before the fight: \\"I knew I had to get Schmeling good. I had my own personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending me.\\" Decades later, Muhammad Ali took up political causes in his refusal to be drafted for the Vietnam War amid the Civil Rights Movement during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson. After earning the championship, Clay converted his religion to Islam, which instigated conflict with his boxing career. He also abandoned his name that was given to his slave ancestors and adopted Muhammad Ali. On April 28, 1967, he refused to serve in the Army during the Vietnam War, stating religious reasons that it goes against the Qur'an's teaching. He then became an icon of not only the civil rights struggle, but also the anti-Vietnam War movement. However he was convicted of draft evasion, sentenced to five years in prison, fined $10,000 and stripped of his championship. It was not until a lawsuit in 1970 that Ali redeemed his title. He would continue in historical boxing matches now known as Rumble in the Jungle in 1974 and Thrilla in Manila in 1975, defeating George Foreman and Joe Frazier, respectively. ==Chess== Chess, which is a recognized sport of the International Olympic Committee, has a history of being linked to political issues. World Chammpion Alexander Alekhine collaborated with National- Socialist Germany during the Second World War. Cold War politics featured in the 1972 World Championship match between the American Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky of the Soviet Union, when Fischer defeated Spassky and temporarily halted Soviet chess dominance; and again in the 1978 World Championship match, when the Soviet Anatoly Karpov narrowly defeated Viktor Korchnoi, who had recently defected from the Soviet Union. Several countries boycotted the 1976 Chess Olympiad, because it was held in Israel. ==Cricket== In 1969, the Marylebone Cricket Club refused to allow Basil D'Oliveira to play for England against South Africa for fear of upsetting the apartheid regime. D'Oliveira was a coloured born in South Africa and refused permission to play for the South African team by the government, instead he played for England. Following his performance against Australia in the previous year's Ashes, D'Oliveria was one of the most likely players to be selected. However, he was not selected; it was suspected at the time that this was capitulation towards the apartheid regime. Cricket has also had a hand to play in sporting diplomacy. Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Soviet pressure on India to deflect the tension they faced, in 1987 Pakistan's president at the time, General Zia ul-Haq, attended a test match between India and Pakistan in Jaipur – a visit that apparently helped cool a flare-up in tensions. Furthermore, following a fifteen-year lull in test matches, cricket tours between India and Pakistan were revived in 2004 in the wake of diplomatic initiatives to bury half a century of mutual hostility. Both sides relaxed their tough visa regulations for each other, allowing thousands of fans to travel across the border. In an attempt to replicate the cricket diplomacy of the past General Pervez Musharraf came to India in 2005 ostensibly for a cricket match. The trip, however, quickly took on the air of a summit as the sides were urged \\"to seize a historic chance to end their dispute over Kashmir.\\" Often this rivalry has been tinged with a religious-political bent to it. A Pakistani fan in Karachi ran onto the pitch to attack the Indian captain, and fans threw stones at the Indian players during the match in Karachi. In 2000 right-wing Hindus dug up the cricket pitch in New Delhi to protest against the Pakistani team's visit.UNU Update: Cricket Diplomacy Following the Kargil conflict, and at various other times, there have also been calls to suspend cricketing ties between the two countries. In reference to immigrants from the Caribbean and South Asia, British Conservative party member Norman Tebbit once a \\"cricket test\\" could adjudge a persons loyalty to England by determining whether or not they supported the England and Wales cricket team ahead of those from their own countries of origin. In 2008, the England and Wales Cricket Board cancelled Zimbabwe's 2009 tour of England and suspended all bilateral relations between the two states in response to the situation regarding the 2008 Zimbabwean presidential election. MPs Jack Straw and Tessa Jowell wrote to the International Cricket Council asking then to ban Zimbabwe from international cricket. China have also gotten in on the cricket diplomacy act. Cross-Strait relations have once again been the impetus for doing so. During the buildup to the 2007 World Cup, Antigua received a $55 million grant to build the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, while Jamaica received $30 million for a new Trelawny stadium. St. Lucia have also got both a cricket and a football stadium courtesy of China. China spent a remarkable $132 million on cricket facilities in the West Indies over the past few years, a massive amount compared to the International Cricket Council's paltry 10-year budget of $70 million to promote cricket globally. It is said that the motive for China's generosity is because \\"Most of the remaining countries that recognize Taiwan are located in the Caribbean and Latin America.\\" The diplomacy paid off in the end as Grenada and Dominica derecognized Taiwan as an independent country. Further, \\"Of the remaining 24 countries that recognize Taiwan, four are in the Caribbean and two of these play cricket.\\" Grenada previously had a stadium built by Taiwan, but saw it flattened by a hurricane. To join the action, China quickly came in to erect another stadium. Consequently, Taiwan took Grenada to a New York City court to force the latter to return the original loan. Put on the back foot, a beleaguered Taiwan also used the World Cup to shore up its position among its shrinking West Indian support base. It doled out $21 million to St. Kitts and Nevis and $12 million to the even smaller St. Vincent and the Grenadines for cricket grounds. China's aggressive ambitions have benefited the Caribbean Islands as \\"Strategic analysts say China is laying out more money than is needed to just isolate Taiwan. China, which has built large embassies in each of the islands, now has a bigger diplomatic presence in the Caribbean than the United States, the superpower next door.\\" And that \\"Mainland China's long-term strategy coincides with its foreign policy.\\" Following the death of Saeed Anwar's daughter he took to a more fundamental Islam and started growing a beard. He was then said to have been the turning point in the Islamisation of the Pakistani cricket team, which was also a reason for Yousuf Youhana's conversion to Islam. From the 2003 World Cup a more visible trend of religion was seen in the Pakistan team with many players having become more devout to the point of either leading prayers or growing beards as a symbol of being a \\"good Muslim\\" (with the notable exception of Shoaib Akhtar and Danish Kaneria (the latter being the only Hindu on the team). Even post-match interviews were preceded by Islamic salutations such as Bismillah ur Rehman rahim. Most famously, after the loss to arch-rival India at the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Shoaib Malik came under fire for apologising \\"I want to thank everyone back home in Pakistan and Muslims all over the world. Thank you very much and I’m sorry that we didn’t win, but we did give our 100 per cent\\" for the defeat, which was particularly ironic considering Irfan Pathan, a Muslim was named Man of the Match for his performance in India's win, and Shah Rukh Khan was in the stands cheering on India.Instablogs – Mobile – Shoaib's remark shows Pakistani team a victim of pan-Islamic influenza Following the 2007 World Cup and the loss to Ireland (an unranked cricket team), the religious influence was criticised for taking a toll on the team. The Islamisation of such a Western sport in Pakistan was seen as symbolic of the growing influence of religion in every field.Islamisation of Pakistan cricket In Pakistan, this trend was attributed to dating back to the tenure of the military government of General Zia-ul Haq where the focus of the youth was shifted from Pakistan as a nation-state and cultural-religious pluralism to Islam as a transnational identity, greater attention to conservative Islamic ritualism, and a perception of a global conspiracy against Muslims and admiration for militancy. A need was also seen to reorient sportsmen towards professionalism, discipline and rules and regulations. It was said that the focus of education and socialisation needed to return to a Pakistan that could not afford to be at war. In 2011, India and Pakistan played each other in the 2011 Cricket World Cup for the first time since 26/11 attacks in Mumbai and a general souring of relations. The event was spontaneously attended by Prime Ministers Yousaf Raza Gillani of Pakistan and Manmohan Singh of India. Following the game, permission was granted for the two countries to play regular series against each other. ==Formula 1Bahrain=== Amid the Bahraini uprising, Avaaz.org called for sports boycotts, comparing the situation in Bahrain with that of apartheid South Africa. Other human rights protesters also called for a boycott of the Bahrain Grand Prix with more explicit comparisons to the sporting boycott of South Africa. On 17 February, it was announced that the second round of GP2 Asia Series, which was to be held at Bahrain International Circuit on 17–19 February, had been cancelled due to security and safety concerns surrounding the protests. On 21 February, the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix, then to take place on 13 March, was again cancelled because of the same concerns.Staff writer (21 February 2011). \\"Bahrain Grand Prix Called Off After Protests\\". BBC News. Retrieved 19 April 2011. Similarly, the 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix, which was held amid claims from Bernie Ecclestone that there was no trouble, faced weekly protests and violence leading up to the event. ==Olympics== Going as far back as the 1936 Olympics, Adolf Hitler used this as a stage to promote Aryan nationalism for Germany with his ideological belief of racial supremacy. The Olympics were used as a method of hardening the German spirit and instilling unity among German youth. It was also believed that sport was a \\"way to weed out the weak, Jewish, and other undesirables.\\" As a result, many Jews and Gypsies were banned from participating in sporting events. While Germany did top the medal table, the Nazi depiction of ethnic Africans as inferior was dispelled by Jesse Owens' gold medals in the 100m, 200m, 4 × 100 m relay and long jump events.Josephson, Judith Pinkerton. Jesse Owens: Track and Field Legend. There were questions as to whether Hitler acknowledged Owens' victories. On the first day of competition, Hitler left the stadium after only shaking hands with the German victors. An Olympic committee member then insisted that Hitler either greet every medalist or none at all; he chose the latter.Hyde Flippo, The 1936 Berlin Olympics: Hitler and Jesse Owens At the games he was visited by Adi Dassler, the founder of Adidas, who offered new shoes to Owens. Jesse Owens on the podium after winning the long jump at the 1936 Summer Olympics. L-R, on podium, Naoto Tajima, Owens, Luz Long. Once again, in 1968, the global stage of the Olympics was used to show the world the plight of the African-American struggle during the civil rights movement in their home country. The famous Black Power salute was performed by Tommie Smith and John Carlos during the medal ceremony in Mexico City. Věra Čáslavská, in protest to the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia and the controversial decision by the judges on the Balance Beam and Floor, turned her head down and away from the Soviet flag whilst the anthem played during the medal ceremony. She returned home as a heroine of the Czechoslovak people, but was made an outcast by the Soviet dominated government. In 1972, several athletes of the Israeli Olympic team were killed in an attack by Palestinian gunmen of the Black September terrorist organization that started at the Olympic village and eventually resulted in the deaths of 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team. The 1980 winter Olympics were used in a much less overtly political way, but in a much more culturally politically significant way. The United States men's Ice Hockey team defeated the USSR National team in the semi final round. This win by the United States team was much more than just an Olympic game, the Soviets had been superior on the ice against everyone and had recently beaten the NHL All Star team. The US Olympic team was all amateurs with an average age of 21, while the Soviets were quasi- professional. The shocking victory in Lake Placid, during one of the heights of the Cold War brought about renewed nationalism and belief among the citizens of the United States and shock and shame to the Soviets. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led to a boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics by a numerous Western states and their allies in protest of Russian actions. In the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics the Soviet Bloc led a retaliatory boycott of the games in response to the American-led Moscow games boycott. Following the cancellation of wrestling at the Olympics in the 2010s, traditional political rivals Iran, Russia and the United States joined forces to annul the measure. The U.S. hosted a publicity event in New York City with athletes from all three countries to campaign for its reinstatement. ==Table tennis== In the 1970s an exchange of table tennis players from the United States and the People's Republic of China led to a thaw in Sino-American relations that eventually led to U.S. President Richard Nixon's rapprochement with China. It all began when the Chinese table tennis team invited their U.S. counterparts to their country on an all-expense-paid trip during the 1971 World Table Tennis Championships in Japan. Time magazine termed it: \\"The ping heard ‘round the world.'\\" On April 10, 1971, the team, and accompanying journalists, became the first U.S. sports delegation to enter and break the information blockade since 1949. Although the U.S. team was defeated by their hosts, in return to Premier Chou En-lai's invitation to more U.S. journalists, the United States government announced that it would lift its 20-year embargo on trade with China. A reporter for Time noted that table tennis was \\"an apt metaphor for the relations between Washington and Peking\\" and that both state motioned a willingness to adapt to the new initiative. However, it was not until July 15, that Nixon would finally be the first U.S. president to pay a visit to China. Thirty-six years later, a three-day \\"Ping-Ping Diplomacy\\" event was held at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum during the week of June 9, 2008. The original members of the U.S. and Chinese teams from 1971 were present to participate at the event. ==Tennis== In 2008, Israeli professional tennis players Shahar Pe'er, Tzipi Obziler, Andy Ram, and Yoni Erlich were supposed to feature in ATP and WTA tournaments in the Arab cities of Doha and Dubai, respectively, despite bans on Israeli passport holders from entering both countries. Pe'er was refused a visa to Dubai the following year following the Gaza War with the organisers saying \\"We do not wish to politicise sport but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the whole region and not alienate or put at risk the players or the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have in the United Arab Emirates.\\" The WTA chief executive Larry Scott later reacted saying some \\"sanctions\\" would be issued on Dubai. She also faced protests following the war during a tournament in New Zealand. During the 2010 US Open tennis tournament India's Rohan Bopanna and Pakistan's Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi reached the men's doubles finals, eliciting responses from political leaders in both countries. Supporters from both countries, including the respective United Nations ambassadors, sat in the stands together. Rashid Malik, Pakistan's Davis Cup coach, said \\"The success of their team so far has been a big encouragement for both countries, it will only have a peaceful and positive impact on their people.\\" Manohar Singh Gill, India's sports minister, asked \\"I have one question for everyone. If Bopanna and Qureshi can play together, why cannot India and Pakistan?\\" The two were also involved in another campaign promoted by the Monaco-based Peace and Sport when they wore sweat shirts with slogans reading \\"Stop War, Start Tennis.\\" They refer to themselves as the \\"Indo-Pak Express.\\" Such a high-profile collaboration meant this was read as a \\"unique\\" partnership. Qureshi said \\"It just feels like us doing well on the bigger level is getting the message across throughout the world – if me and Rohan can get along so well there's no reason the Indians and Pakistanis can't get along with each other. If even two or three per cent of people say, 'If they can get along why can't we?' that's what we're trying to do. \\"They're all mixed together sitting in the crowd. You can't tell who is Pakistani and who is Indian. That's the beauty about sports. Before our pairing you would never see that in any sports, fighting for one cause. It's really good to be part of it.\\" After their finals defeat, Qureshi spoke to the crowd to \\"say something on behalf of all Pakistanis, [that] every time I come here, there's a wrong perception about the people of Pakistan. They are very friendly, very loving people. We want peace in this world as much as you guys.\\" He then made a political appeal to the controversial \\"Ground Zero mosque\\" saying \\"For me, as a Muslim, that's what makes America the greatest country in the world – freedom of religion, freedom of speech. If the mosque is built, I think it's a huge gesture to all the Muslim community out there in the world. I would really appreciate it.\\" Indian and Pakistani fans filled the stadium for the final as the two U.N. ambassadors again sat together in the President's Box. Pakistan's ambassador Abdullah Hussain Haroon said \\"They've proven that when Indians and Pakistanis get together we can raise fire. I think on a people-to-people basis, they're setting an example that the politicians should follow.\\" ==CountriesSouth Africa=== Most famously, the sporting boycott of South Africa during Apartheid was said to have played a crucial role in forcing South Africa to open up their society and to end a global isolation. South Africa was excluded from the 1964 Summer Olympics, and many sports' governing bodies expelled or suspended membership of South African affiliates. It was said that the \\"international boycott of apartheid sport has been a powerful means for sensitising world opinion against apartheid and in mobilising millions of people for action against that despicable system.\\" This boycott \\"in some cases helped change official policies.\\" The South African Table Tennis Board (SATTB), a body founded in contravention to the white South African table tennis board, was replaced for the latter by the International Table Tennis Federation. While the SATTB team was able to participate in the world championships held in Stockholm in 1957, team members were immediately refused passports by the government. It ruled that no black could compete internationally except through the white sports body. Started in 1980, the United Nations \\"Register of Sports Contacts with South Africa\\" – a record of sports exchanges with South Africa and a list of sportsmen who have participated in sports events in South Africa – prove to be an effective instrument to discourage collaboration with apartheid sport.http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/boycotts/indsport.html http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/aam/abdul-2.html In the 1980s South Africa was also expelled from most international sports bodies. The International Olympic Committee even adopted a declaration against \\"apartheid in sport\\" on June 21, 1988, for the total isolation of apartheid sport. The country's hosting and winning of the 1995 Rugby World Cup was a powerful boost to post-apartheid South Africa's return to the international sporting scene. The 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa also drew similar parallels and questions as to whether race could be overcome, this was especially true following the death of Eugene Terreblanche. ===United States=== US President Calvin Coolidge (left) and Washington Senators pitcher Walter Johnson (right) shake hands. Fans of NASCAR are generally considered by the media of the United States to fall within the Republican base as an \\"almost exclusively white, conservative racing crowd\\", the \\"white, middle-aged, working-class Southern men\\" who were coveted in the first decades of the 21st century during electoral campaigns. Joe Gibbs, a NASCAR team owner, spoke at the 2008 Republican National Convention.NASCAR.COM – Politics once again puts NASCAR fans center stage Sept 26, 2008 Almost 90 percent of political contributions from those affiliated with NASCAR go to Republican candidates. Texas Governor, Rick Perry sponsored 2000 NASCAR Winston Cup Series Champion Bobby Labonte's car for an election campaign in 2010.Rick Perry and NASCAR Shoot Up Texas Politics Labonte was reported to have been paid $225,000 to carry the \\"rickperry.org\\" logo. Two years later, Rick Santorum sponsored Tony Raines' car. In 2000, then Republican primary candidate Rudy Giuliani made an appearance at the Daytona International Speedway.articlesbase.com/politics- articles/the-myth-of-nascar-redneck-politics-312654.html#ixzz0mrKPwFjI A study of elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the overall results. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1.5 percent, while a loss had the opposite effect. The study looked at NCAA football games from 1946 to 2008. In addition, the study found that colleges with higher attendance rates had a larger effect on the results, up to 3%. The effects are increased even further if the game is an upset, that is, if the team expected to win does not. Other studies have confirmed these results for other sports, such as baseball and basketball. The study authors concluded that the win made voters feel better about society, boosting votes for the incumbent, while losses made voters feel worse, sending votes to the challenger. There was some speculation that the result of certain games could even decide the 2012 United States presidential election. In the 2010 United States elections, at least five former athletes ran on Republican tickets for political office. Chris Dudley took part in his first political race for Governor of Oregon after playing for the Portland Trail Blazers. He also helped persuade former Philadelphia Eagles' Jon Runyan to run for New Jersey's 3rd congressional district against a first-term Democrat John Adler. Shawn Bradley of the Philadelphia 76ers and Dallas Mavericks ran for a seat in Utah's legislature; Keith Fimian, who played for the Cleveland Browns, sought a House seat from Virginia; and former Washington Redskins' Clint Didier sought a Republican nomination for Senate in Washington state. Only Runyan won his election. Baseball players union boss Don Fehr contributed to the presidential primaries for George W. Bush, Al Gore, Bill Bradley and John McCain. Cincinnati Reds owner Carl Lindner contributed $1.4 million to the Republican party and $1 million to the US Democratic party. Former MLB pitcher Jim Bunning was also a senator once. NFL quarterback Heath Shuler has served as a member of the House of Representatives, as well as Seattle Seahawks receiver Steve Largent and Oklahoma Sooners quarterback J.C. Watts. Former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jack Kemp was a nine term congressman who chaired the House Republican Leadership Conference and served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President George H. W. Bush. Kemp was the 1996 Republican candidate for Vice President. Bill Bradley, who played basketball for the New York Knicks, served three terms in the U.S. Senate representing New Jersey. Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis planned to run for office from New Jersey, though his attempt was blocked and he awaited an appeal hearing. In 2002, the US State Department initiated a sports exchange programme entitled SportsUnited to encourage dialogue between children from the ages of 7–17. The programme seeks to bring together international students with their counterparts in the U.S. to establish links with American professional athletes and to expose them to American culture. Another programme encourages U.S. athletes to travel to and learn about foreign cultures and the challenges young people face in other countries. SportsUnited has partaken in 15 different sports in nearly 70 countries. ===North Korea=== World Cup North Korea's relationships with the international community, especially South Korea, have sometimes been shaped by sports diplomacy. In the 1966 World Cup, North Korea defeated the heavily favored Italian team.Carter, Jon. \\"Chollima Upset Italy.\\" ESPNFC.com. ESPN, 19 July 2012. Web. 13 Apr. 2015. Kim Jong-il believed that successful athletics increases the strength of a country, promoted its ideology, brought a country great honor and increased its international reputation.Kim, Jung Il. On Popularizing Physical Training and Sport and Developing Sporting Skills Rapidly: Talk to the Officials in the Field of Physical Training and Sport, May 19, 1986. For this reason, this victory has become propaganda used by the North Korean regime to present a reputable country to not only their citizens, but also to the international community as a whole. Although North Korea has not had much success since this victory, North Korea participated in the 2010 World Cup. In addition, North Korea was surrounded by controversy during 2006 World Cup qualifying. Fan violence in Pyongyang after a match with Iran led to North Korea playing a home game in Thailand without any fans.\\"North Korea Football Violence Erupts.\\" BBC News. BBC, 30 Mar. 2005. Web. 13 Apr. 2015. 1988 Seoul Olympics The years leading up to, during, and after the 1988 Seoul Olympics played a major role in the development of North Korea. In 1981, Seoul was selected as the host of the 1988 Olympics. Although at first, North Korea did not consider that Seoul being selected as Olympic host was a major issue, it quickly realized that South Korea hosting the Olympics would highlight the growing economic imbalances between North and South Korea.Armstrong, Charles K. Tyranny of the Weak: North Korea and the World, 1950–1992. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print. This realization led to a large devotion of time and effort in an attempt to convince the International Olympic Committee to split the Olympic Games between Seoul and Pyongyang. During these discussions, the IOC considered some concessions, only to be rejected by the North Korean regime. This can be seen as a great missed opportunity for North Korea to gain from the Olympic Games.Radchenko, Sergey. \\"It's Not Enough to Win: The Seoul Olympics and the Roots of North Korea's Isolation.\\" The International Journal of the History of Sport 29.9 (2012): 1243–262. Taylor & Francis Group. Web. 12 Apr. 2015. During this time, North Korea's major allies were China, the USSR, and Cuba. While Fidel Castro and Cuba staunchly defended North Korea, both the USSR and China agreed to participate in the games. This major decision strained relationships that were vital to the North Korean economic system. Throughout the history of North Korea, North Korea relied heavily on the foreign aid. The countries that gave the most aid were the USSR and China. For that reason, the strained relationships had a major effect on North Korea. This played a major role in the North Korean isolationist policies of the 1990s. In addition, as a result of the undeniable success of the Seoul Games, the growing gap between these two nations was further put on display. As a result of the failed negotiations North Korea engaged in several acts of terrorism. In 1987, in an attempt to destabilize the Olympic Games and instill fear in the international community, a South Korean commercial flight, Korean Air Flight 858 was bombed killing 115 passengers on board. This event did not fulfill its intended purpose and instead further weakened North Korea's international reputation. 13th World Festival of Youth and Students North Korea, following its unsuccessful effort to sabotage the Seoul Olympics decided to hold the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students in 1989. Coming one year after the most successful Olympics in years, there was large pressure on the North Korean regime to hold a similarly successful event. Although this event brought in 177 countries, the greatest number in its history, it was never seen as a true alternative to the Olympics and did not gain the international visibility that the North Korean government had hoped for. In addition, the cost of the event was a staggering 4 billion dollars and helped further push North Korea into the financial distress that was so prevalent during the 1990s. Pyongyang International Sports and Culture Festival for Peace Japanese wrestler-turned-politician Antonio Inoki worked with the North Korean government to organize the Pyongyang International Sports and Culture Festival for Peace in April 1995 in order to promote peace between North Korea, the United States and Japan. The Festival culminated in two nights of professional wrestling, which featured bouts between Japanese and American wrestlers that were watched by guest of honor Muhammad Ali. Several of the bouts were broadcast on pay-per-view in the US under the title 'Collision in Korea'. Arirang Festival The Arirang Festival, starting in the early 2000s takes place in the Rungrado 1st of May Stadium, the largest stadium in the world holding approximately 150,000 people. Participation in this event is mandatory and the performances are extravagant and impressively choreographed.Merkel, Udo. \\"The Politics of Sport and Identity in North Korea.\\" The International Journal of the History of Sport 31.3 (2014): 376–90. Taylor & Francis Group. Web. 12 Apr. 2015. The Arirang Festival can be broken up into three different parts. The first is a floor show, where thousands of athletes, gymnasts and dancers demonstrate their athletic abilities. The second section uses thousands of North Koreans to create a human mosaic depicting vibrant images of North Korea and North Korean achievements. Finally, the third section is the music that links the performance. Together, these elements present to the international community North Korea's best athletes through a mix of athletics and art. The Arirang Festival draws international tourists and journalists and intends to present a thriving economic nation to the world. Many of the acts in the festival focus on the theme of reunification. Children chant \\"how much longer do we have to be divided due to foreign forces\\". The 2014 and 2015 Arirang Festivals were canceled and it is unknown if it will return. Recent relations with South Korea North Korea and South Korea marched together for the 2000 Sydney Olympics, 2004 Athens Olympics and 2006 Turin Olympics. Plans to walk together for the 2008 Beijing Olympics fell through when principles regarding selection of athletes could not be agreed upon. After the 2008 Beijing Olympics tensions have increased between these two nations. Many inter-Korean sporting events were held in the 2000s. These events were referred to as unification matches. Internal use of sports politics The North Korean leaders understood the importance of sports not only in the international community, but also internally. The major ideology in North Korea, Juche, has been solidified through the Communist Party's use of sports. The North Korea regime believed that by supporting the increases in sport, the North Korean people would overall be more fit. This would allow the people to be more useful in the revolutionary struggle. For this reason, it was important to start athletics young. In fact, training in physical sport was mandatory during schooling. In the 2000s, major sporting events were being broadcast throughout North Korea, and these events are still being used as propaganda tools. Sports have played a vital role in maintaining the power of the ruling class, while at the same time offering opportunities to interact with the international community. ===Others=== More recently Manny Pacquiao was elected to the House of Representatives of the Philippines in 2010 and Vitali Klitschko was elected to the Ukrainian Parliament as leader of the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform in 2012. President Serzh Sargsyan is also Chairman of the Armenian Chess Federation. Olympic Champion Yurik Vardanyan is an advisor to Sargsyan. Red Kelly became a Canadian MP while playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu ran three successful campaigns (including a by-election resulting from his own resignation) to become a member of parliament in the Lok Sabha as a Bharatiya Janata Party candidate. In the 2009 general election, former captain Mohammed Azharuddin also won a seat in parliament from outside his home territory. Kirti Azad also won a seat in parliament from Darbhanga, Bihar from the BJP. Sachin Tendulkar was sworn in as an MP in the Rajya Sabha on 4 June 2012, while he was active in the sports field. Olympic silver-medalist Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore joined the BJP. It was said that \\"celebrities...are a time-tested tool for the political parties to tide over their bankruptcy.\\" Additionally, former cricketer Mohammed Kaif ran as an unsuccessful candidate for the National Congress in the 2014 elections. Former football player Avertano Furtado was also elected as a MLA in Goa. Former hockey player Pargat Singh was also elected as a MLA for the Shiromani Akali Dal. In 2013, Wesley Korir, winner of the 2012 Boston Marathon, was elected to the Kenyan National Assembly. Former chess player Garry Kasparov also became an opposition activist in his native Russia. Former offshore powerboat racer Daniel Scioli became vice-president of Argentina between 2003 and 2007 and is currently the Governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, considered one of the most influential political jobs in Argentina. Carlos Espínola, a windsurfer and Olympic medalist, also entered politics and is, as of 2013, mayor of his native city in Corrientes Province. Former Pakistani cricketer and the captain of the Pakistan cricket team which won the world cup, Imran Khan later created his own political party PTI which is currently the main form of opposition in the Pakistan government. ==In popular culture== ;Films * Invictus * Escape to Victory * Egaro * Lagaan * Ali ==See also== *Stick to sports ==References * Sports as cultural diplomacy * International Convention Against Apartheid in Sports * Sports Dictionary.

On their return, they published in 1832-35 the Correspondence d'Orient. An ardent royalist, and bitterly opposed to the irregular advent of Louis-Philippe to the throne in 1830, he made himself felt in politics through contributions to the Quotidienne.

These war medals and accompanying certificates specifically identify the conflict for which the decoration will have been awarded. These decorations were effectively abolished during the Allied Occupation of Japan in the post- war years (1945–1951). The plausible re-institution of a modern equivalent was made unlikely by the adoption of Japan's post-war Constitution which disavows the right of the state to engage in aggressive war; but on-going political pressure for an amendment to Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution renders that prospect marginally possible. ==Japanese War Medals1874 Formosa Expedition War Medal=== 1874 Formosa Expedition Medal ribbon bar The Japanese expedition of 1874 to Taiwan Province, also referred to as the Taiwan Expedition of 1874, was in response to the Mudan Incident of 1871. Fifty-four shipwrecked Ryukyuan sailors were killed by Paiwan aborigines in December 1871 in southern Taiwan. In seeking restitution from Qing China, Japan reached an impasse when the Chinese claimed that they were not responsible for the actions of the aborigines in territory that was nominally under Chinese sovereignty. The Japanese government sent an expedition of 3,600 soldiers led by Saigō Tsugumichi in May 1874. The Japanese won a decisive victory at the Battle of Stone Gate on 22 May 1874. Thirty aborigines were either killed or mortally wounded in the battle, and a great number wounded. Japanese casualties were six killed and thirty wounded. In November 1874 the Japanese forces withdrew from Taiwan after the Qing government agreed to an indemnity of 500,000 Kuping taels. ===1894–95 Sino-Japanese War Medal=== 1894–95 Sino- Japanese War Medal ribbon bar The First Sino–Japanese War, which lasted from 1 August 1894 to 17 April 1895, was fought between Qing Dynasty China and Meiji Japan, primarily over control of Korea.

This is more commonly known as the Russo-Japanese War. A rough translation of the body of the document explains: : \\"A medal of honor (jūgun kishō) is hereby given, on March 30, 1906, to Ernesto Burzagli, Lieutenant of the Italian Navy, on application by the Naval Minister of Japan and with the Emperor's approval, pursuant to the Regulation Relating to the Medals Honoring Participation in Battles (1904-05).

The store carries a variety of premium-branded items in apparel, cosmetics, jewelry, shoes, and other product categories, in addition to greeting cards and gift items carrying the Hallmark brand. Halls is positioned at a price level comparable to larger luxury-oriented chains including Bloomingdale's and Neiman Marcus. ==History== Hallmark founder Joyce C. Hall founded Halls in 1916, as a companion to his greeting card company which had begun three years earlier. The store evolved from a showcase in the lobby of downtown Kansas City's Gordon and Koppel Building. By 1916, Halls had moved its store to 11th Street along the city's fashionable \\"Petticoat Lane\\" with expanded offerings covering an array of high-quality gift items. Halls' move in 1950 to downtown's Grand Avenue further developed its local reputation as a premium specialty store, with more merchandise added. Halls became part of the collection of stores at the city's high-profile Country Club Plaza in 1965, with a 55,000-square-foot store comprising a full city block in the shopping district. In addition to the store's merchandise selection, the structure was outfitted with elaborate building materials and accessories such as inlaid lapis lazuli floors and Baccarat crystal chandeliers, with details complementary to the district's overall Spanish and Moorish architectural styles. The department store's location in Crown Center was conceived in 1973. It was part of the continued revitalization of downtown envisioned by J. C. Hall, associated with development surrounding Hallmark's corporate headquarters that had begun in earnest in 1967. Halls Crown Center replaced the original downtown Halls with a three-level, store designed by Paul László. In 2011, both the first and second floor of Halls Crown Center were converted to an aquarium from Sea Life Centres and a Legoland Discovery Centre in a combined $30 million project. The displaced men's department and Hallmark Cards location were relocated to the Crown Center Shops while the women's department stayed in its original third floor location. The division in the present day notes J. C. Hall's mission for the store as a \\"unique shopping experience dedicated to the expression of personal style and the art of living well.\\" In June 2013, Halls announced plans to consolidate its two stores into a new, larger store in Crown Center. Halls president Kelly Cole said that it no longer made sense to operate two stores so close to one another. The existing Crown Center store closed in March 2014, and the Plaza store closed August 3, 2014. The new Crown Center store, opened on September 21, 2014, it includes all current Halls departments and a café. As a result of the consolidation, Halls is projected to eventually cut around 115 staff positions. ==Products and services== Halls offers a variety of premium brands in ladies' and men's apparel, cosmetics, jewelry, and housewares, with select items available exclusively at the stores. Bridal registry, corporate gift services, and custom tailoring are also offered, along with an in-store Hallmark Gold Crown shop. The store is also a long-time sponsor of several area humanitarian organizations, serving health care, fine arts, public broadcasting and other interests around greater Kansas City. ==References *Halls Kansas City website Category:Hallmark Cards Category:Clothing retailers of the United States Category:American companies established in 1916 Category:Retail companies established in 1916 Category:Department stores of the United States Category:Kansas City metropolitan area Category:Companies based in Kansas City, Missouri ","title":"Halls (department store)"},{"id":"19233266","text":"Hadromeros is an extinct genus of trilobite in the order Phacopida. ==References * Hadromeros at the Paleobiology Database Category:Cheiruridae Category:Fossils of Ireland Category:Fossils of the United Kingdom Category:Silurian trilobites Category:Paleozoic life of the Northwest Territories Category:Paleozoic life of Quebec Category:Phacopida genera ","title":"Hadromeros"},{"id":"19233300","text":"Rufino Bauzá (1791–1854) was a Uruguayan independence fighter and military and political figure.'Francisco Bauzá', Wikipedia (in Spanish) ==Earlier events in life; family background== Rufino Bauza Ellndiscreto He was involved many of the conflicts associated with the movement for Uruguayan independence, and subsequently in the early years of the intermittent Civil War which the country experienced throughout much of the 19th century.

On May 3, 2009, she lost the race to the presidency of the Republic of Panama to center- right candidate Ricardo Martinelli. ==Career== She finished studies in the National Institute and the University of Panama, where she obtained her bachelor's degree with honours in Agronomy Engineering. She also holds post- graduate studies in education. She served as Mayor of San Miguelito, congresswoman, and President of the National Assembly (1994-1995)PALABRAS LLANAS - 50 años de visión y Compromiso (1906-2006) with the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). When a male legislator once interrupted her to say that women should be at home with her children, she punched him and yelled, \\"Respect women!\\" As a National Assembly member in 1994, she opposed outgoing President Guillermo Endara's granting of temporary asylum to 10,000 Haitian boat people, but supported his initiative to abolish the armed forces. In 1996, Herrera supported President Ernesto Pérez Balladares's bill to grant amnesty to 950 former officials of military ruler Manuel Noriega, dismissing criticism of the bill as an attempt by fractured opposition parties to find a new common cause. In the same year, she spoke out against an attempt to revive capital punishment after a wave of murders of bus and taxi drivers. Herrera was elected as President of the National Assembly in 1994, the first woman to hold the post. She also served as chairwoman of the Parliamentary Trade Commission in 1998, calling on pharmaceutical companies to rein in rising prices or face government price controls. In December 2000, human remains were discovered at a Panamanian National Guard base, incorrectly believed to be those of Jesús Héctor Gallego Herrera, a priest murdered during the Omar Torrijos dictatorship. Moscoso appointed a truth commission to investigate the site and those at other bases. The commission faced opposition from the PRD- controlled National Assembly, who slashed its funding, and from Herrera, who threatened to seek legal action against the president for its creation. The commission ultimately reported on 110 of the 148 cases it examined, concluding that the Noriega government had engaged in \\"torture [and] cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment\\", and recommending further exhumation and investigation. In 2001, Herrera led opposition to President Mireya Moscoso's appointment of former Interior Minister Winston Spadafora to the Supreme Court. The following year, National Assembly member Carlos Afu, who was being expelled from the PRD for his vote in support of Spadafora's nomination, accused the party of taking bribes en masse under Herrera's leadership from the San Lorenzo consortium, a government contractor. During the presidency of Martin Torrijos (2004-09), Herrera served as Minister of Housing. == 2009 presidential election == Herrera served as the PRD candidate for President of Panama in the 2009 election. She won her party's primary on September 7, 2008, defeating Panama City Mayor Juan Carlos Navarro with a ten-point lead. Herrera was endorsed by Ruben Blades, a popular salsa musician who had previously run for president and served as Torrijos' Minister of Tourism, and was initially considered the favorite for the presidency. If elected, she would have become Panama's second female president. However, Herrera was badly damaged in the election by her \\"reputation as a henchwoman of General Manuel Noriega\\" and by the perception that she was a \\"Chavista\\", a supporter of leftist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. Ricardo Martinelli, the candidate of the opposition coalition led by his Democratic Change party, was also helped by strong support from the business community. On May 3, 2009, Martinelli won 60% of the vote to Herrera's 36%. Former president Guillermo Endara also ran in the race, finishing a distant third. == Personal life == Herrera has three children.

Prior to the abolition of the Nepali monarchy in 2008, it was officially known as His Majesty's Government. The head of state is the President and the Prime Minister holds the position of the Head of executive. The role of President is largely ceremonial as the functioning of the government is managed entirely by the Prime Minister who is appointed by the Parliament. The heads of constitutional bodies are appointed by the President on the recommendation of Constitutional Council, with the exception of the Attorney General, who is appointed by the President on the recommendation of Prime Minister. ==HistoryOld Bharadari governmentship=== The character of government in Kingdom of Nepal was driven from consultative state organ of the previous Gorkha hill principality, known as Bharadar. These Bharadars were drawn from high caste and politically influential families. For instance; Thar Ghar aristocratic group in previous Gorkha hill principality. Bharadars formed consultative body in the kingdom for the most important functions of the state as Councellors, Ministers and Diplomats. There was no single successful coalition government as court politics were driven from large factional rivalries, consecutive conspiracies and ostracization of opponent Bharadar families through assassination rather than legal expulsion. Another reason was the minority of the reigning King between 1777 and 1847 that led to establishment of anarchial rule. The government was stated to have controlled by regents, Mukhtiyars and alliance of political faction with strong fundamental support. In the end of the 18th century, the central politics was regularly dominated by two notable political factions; Thapas and Pandes. As per historians and contemporary writer Francis Hamilton, the government of Nepal comprised *1 Chautariya *4 Kajis *4 Sirdar/Sardars *2 Subedars *1 Khazanchi *1 Kapardar. As for Regmi states, the government of Nepal comprised *4 Chautariyas *4 Kajis *4 Sirdar/Sardars. Later, the number varied after King Rana Bahadur Shah abdicated his throne to minor son in 1799. There were 95 Bharadars as per the copper inscription of King Rana Bahadur Shah. In 1794, King Rana Bahadur Shah came of age and his first act was to re-constitute the government such that his uncle, Prince Bahadur Shah of Nepal, had no official part to play. Rana Bahadur appointed Kirtiman Singh Basnyat as Chief (Mul) Kaji among the newly appointed four Kajis though Damodar Pande was the most influential Kaji. Kirtiman had succeeded Abhiman Singh Basnyat as Chief Kaji while Prince Bahadur Shah was succeeded as Chief (Mul) Chautariya by Prince Ranodyot Shah, then heir apparent of King Rana Bahadur Shah by a Chhetri Queen Subarna Prabha Devi. Kajis had held the administrative and executive powers of nation after the fall of Chief Chautariya Prince Bahadur Shah in 1794. Later, Kirtiman Singh was secretly assassinated on 28 September 1801, by the supporters of Raj Rajeshwari Devi and his brother Bakhtawar Singh Basnyat, was then given the post of Chief (Mul) Kaji. Later Damodar Pande was appointed by Queen Rajrajeshwari as Chief Kaji. When the exiled abdicated King Rana Bahadur Shah prepared his return in 1804, he arrested many government officials including then Chief Kaji Damodar Pande and sacked the reigning government. He took over the administration of Nepal by assuming the position of Mukhtiyar (chief authority). A new government was constituted with favoring officials. Bhimsen Thapa was made a second kaji; Ranajit Pande, who was the father-in-law of Bhimsen's brother, was made the Mul (Chief) Kaji; Sher Bahadur Shah, Rana Bahadur's half-brother, was made the Mul (Chief) Chautariya; while Rangnath Paudel was made the Raj Guru (royal spiritual preceptor). Later in April 1806, tensions arose between Chief Chautariya Sher Bahadur Shah and Mukhtiyar Rana Bahadur Shah on the night of 25 April 1806 during a meeting at Tribhuvan Khawas's house where around 10 pm, Sher Bahadur in desperation drew a sword and killed Rana Bahadur Shah before being cut down by nearby courtiers, Bam Shah and Bal Narsingh Kunwar, also allies of Bhimsen. The assassination of Rana Bahadur Shah triggered a great massacre in Bhandarkhal (a royal garden east of Kathmandu Durbar) and at the bank of Bishnumati river after which Kaji Bhimsen killed 55 senior officials to benefit from the chaos. He was declared Mukhtiyar (Chief Authority) of Nepal and led the new government from a royal mandate of minor King Girvan Yuddha Bikram Shah. Mukhtiyars ruled over the executive and administrative functions of the state until its replacement by British conventional Prime Minister in 1843 conferred upon then ruling Mukhtiyar Mathabar Singh Thapa. ===Ideals of the old Bharadari governmentship=== The policies of the old Bharadari governments were derived from ancient Hindu texts as Dharmashastra and Manusmriti. The King was considered as an incarnation of Lord Vishnu and was the chief authority over legislative, judiciary and executive functions. The judiciary functions were decided on the principles of Hindu Dharma codes of conduct. The king had full rights to expel any person who offended the country and also pardon the offenders and grant return to the country. The government on practicality was not an absolute monarchy due to the dominance of Nepalese political clans making the Shah monarch a puppet ruler. These basic Hindu templates provide the evidence that Nepal was administered as a Hindu state. ==Head of state== *President : Bidhya Devi Bhandari *Vice President : Nanda Kishor Pun ==Executive== *Prime Minister : Khadga Prasad Oli *Chief Secretary : Lok Darshan Regmi ==Legislative== * Speaker of House of Representatives : Agni Sapkota * Chairman of National Assembly : Ganesh Prasad Timilsina ==Judiciary== *Chief Justice of the Supreme Court: Cholendra Shumsher JBR ==Government agencies in NepalMinistries=== {  - !

In 1816 he joined the Army of the North, in a dragoons regiment. He was taken prisoner by the royalists and spent time at the Callao prison, near the city of Lima. In 1821, as part of the negotiations with viceroy Joaquín de la Pezuela, general San Martín obtained the freedom of many other officers, including Casanovas. He joined San Martin's Army of the Andes, and fought at Torata and Moquegua. In this last battle he was wounded and taken prisoner again being moved to Chicuito island on Lake Titicaca, until he was freed after the royalist surrender at the Battle of Ayacucho. Casanovas returned to Buenos Aires in 1824 and was named an officer of the dragoons regiment. He was named an officer in a dragoon regiment -- armed cavalry -- and fought in the 1825 campaign under the orders of Juan Lavalle and Juan Manuel de Rosas, on the south of Buenos Aires Province. In 1826 he went to the Banda Oriental (present-day Uruguay, where he fought in the war with Brazil, and took part on the Battle of Ituzaingó under colonel José María Paz; where the colonel was promoted to general and Casanovas to the rank of colonel. ==First civil war== Casanovas returned to Buenos Aires in 1828 and supported Lavalle's revolution in December, then shortly after he went to Córdoba, under orders from general Paz. Fought at the Battle of San Roque, and La Tablada and then at Oncativo. He also took part on the repression of federal rebels in the Córdoba hills. When Paz fell prisoner in mid-1831, Gregorio Aráoz de Lamadrid decided to retreat to Tucumán. Casanovas decided to stay and remain as part of the interim governor's (Mariano Fragueiro) guard. Fragueiro signed a treaty with the caudillo Estanislao López and after the signing, the federal army entered Córdoba, and Casanovas was a prisoner again. By order of the new federal caudillos, the Reynafé brothers, he was freed and put in command of a regiment of dragoons. He then helped the Reinafé brothers to defeat Ruiz Huidobro's revolution -- instigated by Facundo Quiroga -- and Casanovas was confirmed as commander of the forces in the provincial capital. ==Córdoba's governor== After the assassination of Quiroga in 1835, the Reynafés were deposed and arrested. Rosas had taken power in Buenos Aires, and nobody wanted to take charge of the local government. For a short while his government minister, Pedro Nolasco Rodríguez was named as interim to the post, but as he declined to send the prisoners to Buenos Aires, Casanovas was elected in his place. When the federal governors of other provinces (Pascual Echagüe, Estanislao López and Rosas), learned of his appointment, they did not accept his government. Casanovas had to quit ten days after assuming the post. He captured Santos Pérez, Quiroga's assassin, but he let him escape. He did not go far; was recaptured and sent to Buenos Aires, where he was executed by firing squad. Casanovas remained in command of his regiment, and trying his loyalty not be doubted, he supported all of caudillo Manuel Quebracho López's repressions against his enemies in Córdoba. In 1839 he was named to as military commander of the departments on the north of the province. ==1840 Revolution== In August 1840, with Lavalle retreating and about to enter Córdoba, Casanovas rebelled against the current Córdoba governor, but he was defeated at Río Seco. He took refuge in Tucumán, and returned in November when López was deposed. Lamadrid, who had entered Córdoba, sent him to the Battle of Quebracho Herrado, then he returned to Córdoba. He then moved to Tucumán with Lavalle and Lamadrid. Casanovas was accused of habing caused the defeat of José María Vilela at the Battle of San Cala, for having had revealed their position, but historians think him innocent of the charge. He fought at the Battle of Famaillá, and escaped after their defeat. ==Last years== He spent some years exiled in Bolivia, Chile and lastly in Montevideo. He placed himself under the orders of general Urquiza, but it is not known if he fought at the Battle of Caseros where Rosas was defeated. He supported Urquiza's policies in Buenos Aires, and was in charge of a federal battalion. He was still very much hated by the Unitarian Party who were taking control of the city, and who would depose governor Vicente López y Planes in the September revolution which Casanovas did not get to see. He was assassinated in 1852 in a Buenos Aires street by a unitarian party member (note: a political movement, not related to the Christian church), who still believed he was guilty of the treason of 1841. ==Bibliography== * * * == References == Category:1802 births Category:1852 deaths Category:People from Salta Province Category:Argentine military personnel Category:People of the Cisplatine War Category:Governors of Córdoba Province, Argentina ","title":"Sixto Casanovas"},{"id":"19233472","text":"Leyton Sixth Form College or LSC is a public college located in the London Borough of Waltham Forest.

It has been extensively modernised internally. thumb ===Leyton County High School for Boys=== Leyton County High School for Boys was formed in 1916 by amalgamation of Leyton and Leytonstone high schools. The school occupied temporary premises at Connaught Road until 1929, when it moved to new buildings in Essex Road.A History of the County of Essex: Volume 6 (1973), pp. 233-240. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=42774 The opening was performed by the Prince of Wales.http://seax.essexcc.gov.uk/result_details.asp?DocID=87907 It was a selective grammar school for boys aged 11 to 18. The counterpart of this school was the Leyton County High School for Girls on Colworth Road. Head Master for the school in the 1940-1949 period was Dr Couch, a cousin of Dr Quiller-Couch. He presided over the school while it housed first-year pupils at Ruckholt Road annex, a building partly damaged in the World War 2 air raids on the nearby Temple Mills marshalling yard. The site is now a car sales outlet. No doubt there was an influx of pupils at the end of the war that could not be accommodated in other Grammar Schools that had been damaged in that area of South West Essex. In 1992, Paul Estcourt (who attended during the period 1957-64) published a book entitled \\"L.C.H.S. at its Peak\\". This book not only described his recollections but also the academic and sporting achievements under the leadership of John Cummings, who succeeded Dr Couch as Headmaster. ===Sixth form college=== In 1968, Waltham Forest adopted the comprehensive system and in its new guise it catered for mixed-ability 14- to 18-year-old boys as Leyton Senior High School for Boys before a re- organisation in 1985 led a change of role as a co-educational sixth form college. ==Building Programme== The Meridian House, which represents two of the Greenwich meridian instruments. The college's forty million pounds building project has been finished. The new theatre has become the venue for drama and musical performances. The college's purpose built Television studio has been established. The street that now links all institution buildings has put on events as varied as a World Food Day and the annual Higher Education fair taking place in it.http://www.guardian- series.co.uk/news/4572283.LEYTON__College_given___32m_for_major_rebuilding_project/ A new gymnasium, fitness suite, locker rooms and ablution areas for Muslims staffs and learners, have seen a large rise in student and staff participation in sport as well as providing facilities for local schools and especially for Muslims, where either males and females can pray Jumu'ah.https://www.neardesk.com/locations/details/22 The final stage of the scheme was a spacious extension to the existing Meridian House, and the complete refurbishment of the original college building.

Peco's work is credited for the development of Bosnian and Herzegovinian linguistics. His areas of specialization include the dialectology of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, namely the Shtokavian and Torlakian dialects. He wrote books on the speeches of eastern and central Herzegovina, speeches of western Herzegovina, Ikavian- Štokavian dialects of Bosnia and Turkish loan words into them. His work is cited or referenced by many. For example, his research on eastern Bosnian dialect was discussed at the United Nations' International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). ==Early years== Peco was born in the village of Ortiješ, near Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina to Jusuf and Hajrija Peco. His brother, Džemal Peco, was a teacher. After graduating Viša pedagoška škola high school in Sarajevo, Peco went to Belgrade where he enrolled the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology, which was a department within the Faculty of Philosophy at the time. His 1958 PhD dissertation was entitled Govor istočne Hercegovine (\\"The speech of eastern Herzegovina\\"). Already in high school Peco showed interest in scientific research. ==Career== After completing his education at the University of Belgrade, Peco became a regular professor of Philology at the university, where he was elected several times as a head of the department for Serbo-Croatian and South Slavic languages. He was a mentor for numerous M.A. and Ph.D. theses, and a participant to numerous domestic and international conferences. He was a Member and contributor of the Academy of Sciences and Arts of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1978, and a Corresponding (Foreign) Member of the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts since 2003. Peco edited journal Bosanskohercegovački dijalektološki zbornik (\\"Bosnian-Herzegovinian dialectological miscellany\\") for many years, and served a member of editing boards of many other journals. In 1963, at the Fifth International Congress of Slavists held in Sofia, Bulgaria, Peco complained about some of the participants, stating: > \\"...individual members of the delegation of the host country\\" in the > Linguistic section \\"attempted to deny the right to independence of the > Macedonian language, a language which possesses both its own literature, and > its own grammar... True, such opinions are not new. They are a reflection of > old, non-Marxist theories, long ago trampled into oblivion by time. > Fortunately, such concepts were not also the opinion of the [Bulgarian] > delegation as a whole. Besides, this type of formulation was not based on > fact, which would be difficult to deny. On the contrary, the baselessness of > such formulations was easy to prove even without referring to great > authorities, and without referring to the basic principles of Marxist > science.\\" He was also a presenter at the 1985 Yugoslav Onomastics Conference, a contributor to the Tenth International Committee for Phonetics and Phonology of Slavonic Languages Conference in 1987, and editor of the magazine Bosanskohercegovački Dijalektološki Anthology. Professor Peco retired from the University of Belgrade in 1992, and made his home in Belgrade until his death in 2011. ==Awards== Amongst his awards, Peco received the \\"Veselin Masleša Award\\" in 1986 in Sarajevo, \\"14 februar award\\" in Mostar in 1986, and the \\"Vuk Award\\" in 1990 in Belgrade. ==Partial bibliography== Peco is the first academic in Bosnia and Herzegovina that has had published collected works after the Yugoslav wars.

As a youth, he was adopted by his mother's widowed and childless sister, Elizabeth Willing Powel. He legally changed his name when he attained his majority, and inherited the immense fortune of his late uncle, Samuel Powel. He was educated at The Academy and College of Philadelphia and after college joined a counting house. As part of his job in mercantile affairs, he traveled to Calcutta and returned at age 22 with twenty-two thousand dollars as his share of the profit. ==Career== He served as Secretary of the American Legation in London from 1807 to 1811 under William Pinkney who was minister of England. He returned to the United States in 1811, joined the Pennsylvania militia and served as Brigade-Major under Thomas Cadwalader at Camp Dupont. During the War of 1812, he was Inspector-General of the Pennsylvania militia, and attained the rank of colonel in the U.S. Army. After the war he devoted himself to agriculture, and did much to improve the breeding of cattle and sheep in the United States. He founded the Pennsylvania Agricultural Society in 1823, and published Memoirs of the Pennsylvania Agricultural Society (1824) and Hints for American Farmers (1827). He served as one of the Charter Trustees for Lafayette College from 1826 to 1835. He served as a Federalist member of the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 1st district from 1827 to 1830. The Powels built a massive Greek-Revival mansion and estate in West Philadelphia, overlooking the Schuylkill River. The mansion was named \\"Powelton\\" and was designed by the architect William Strickland. In 1851, Powel sold Powelton to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. The railroad kept 30 acres along the river and sold the rest for development of residential housing. The mansion was demolished in 1885, and the estate developed as the neighborhood Powelton Village. Powel died in Newport, Rhode Island and is interred at the Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ==Personal life== He married Julia de Veaux of South Carolina in 1817. She was the daughter of Andrew Deveaux. Together they had nine children with seven who survived to adulthood. John Hare Powel Jr. (1837-1890) served as mayor of Newport, Rhode Island.

An SDF is the context in which a service provider's capabilities are arranged into services. The term service delivery framework (SDF) has been used interchangeably with the term service delivery platform (SDP), which is a set of technology components that provide capabilities. An SDF governs and guides the use of SDP capabilities. ==Current use== Service delivery frameworks fall into two categories. # a general reference model for the delivery of services. Such a service delivery framework is developed to be broadly applicable to a particular industry. The TM Forum Service Delivery Framework, as an example, is developed for the telecommunications industry. # a more refined reference model for service delivery. This kind of SDF, being more specific, applies to a particular market or service provider. The Immunisation Service Delivery Framework of the District Health Boards of New Zealand offers an example. Some vendors of service delivery platforms use the term \\"service delivery framework\\" to describe their product offerings. ==In Context== An illustration of the role of a Service Delivery Framework in the delivery of service. ==Accountability for service delivery== The relationship between government and citizens is crucial. Ultimately, government is accountable to citizens for decisions taken. Many countries need to improve the substantive elements of democracy and its checks and balances to ensure that public goods are delivered according to citizens’ expectations. Some methodologies for assessing the extent to which service delivery is accountable have been developed. For instance, the methodology for citizen-led assessment of accountability in service delivery has been developed by the International IDEA. ==See also== * Democratic Accountability in Service Delivery: a review of the literature, a self-assessment methodology, and a sample of cases from around the world.

Originally a grammar school called Leyton County High School for Girls, the buildings at the junction of Colworth Road and Forest Road on the edge of Epping Forest were opened in 1911; girls were transferred there from the private Elson House Girls High School in Wallwood Road and from the mixed Leyton and Leytonstone high schools. The school was built on the site of Forest Farm and was designed in the Tudor style by William Jacques ARIBA, who was the architect for the Leyton Urban District Council. In 1968, it was renamed Leyton Senior High School for Girls when it became a comprehensive school for 14- to 18-year-old girls. In the 1980s, it became a mixed comprehensive under a borough re- organisation of schools and changed name to Leytonstone School. Business and Enterprise specialist school status was achieved in 2007. Successful re- designation in 2008 enabled Leytonstone to retain this specialism and acquire a further specialism, 'Leadership Partners' in February 2009.

Zomba Central Prison built in 1935 is the only maximum security prison in the country, holding prisoners with long sentences or serious offences. Severe overcrowding throughout the prison system provides a conducive environment for the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis. ==History== The prison system dates back to colonial times when Malawi was divided in two regions; Southern Province (now Southern region) and Northern Province (now Central and Northern regions). In the Southern Province were 9 jails and in the Northern 10. The Prison Department employed fewer than 200 personnel distributed into several posts such as, superintendents and guards.http://chambo.sdnp.org.mw/ruleoflaw/prisons The jails that were in the districts were for holding prisoners with short sentences. They were controlled by a District Commissioner with civil police as guards. The Zomba Central Prison held people with much longer sentences and was under the control of the King's African Rifles. It held Europeans, Asiatics (or Coloureds) and Africans. Males and females were separate. The jail in Blantyre, which was under the charge of a superintendent held Europeans only. When Malawi gained independence in 1964 problems such as racial discrimination, torture, arbitrary arrests and forced labor were still rampant in the criminal justice system. Under \\"Life President\\", Dr Hastings Kamuzu Banda, political prisoners were held without trial and severely mistreated by prison guards.Africa News, UN Integrated Regional Information Networks, March 24, 2005. ==Modern structure of Prison Department== Since the onset of democratic government in 1994, the prison system in Malawi has changed. A Chief Commissioner of Prisons, who works under the Minister of Home Affairs and Internal Security, heads the Malawi Prison Service. The system has its head office in Zomba and is divided into five divisions: Operations, Farms, Prison Clinic, Prison Training School and General Administration. Among the large prisons are: * The old maximum security prison, Zomba Central Prison, built in 1935, which has six cell blocks: one for juvenile offenders, one for first offenders, two for recurrent offenders, one for women, and one for condemned prisoners.Nyangulu, D., S. Harris A. D. \\"Tuberculosis In A Prison Population In Malawi\\" 922140 Correctional Institutions. * Maula Prison built in the 1960s in the capital city of Lilongwe.Michael Wines. \\"Wasting away, A Million Wait In African Jails.\\" New York Times, 6 November 2005, Late Edition (East Coast): 1.1. * Chichiri Prison a large prison in the commercial city of Blantyre. (Date of opening unknown) ==Spreading of disease== Malawi, as a developing country, faces many problems in its prisons, especially the fast spread of HIV/AIDS and TB, which are mainly caused by the rapidly increasing number of inmates. For example, Maula Prison was intended to house 800 inmates but now holds approximately 1,805 inmates, all but 24 of them men. Malawian prisons are estimated to exceed their capacity by 200%.http://www.penalreform.org/central-east-and-southern-africa.html These large numbers make for extremely unsanitary conditions. This in combination with bad nutrition gives an abnormally high death rate. Prisoners deal with dirty water, foul toilets and intermittently working showers.4 Cells built for 50 or 60 people now hold up to 150 people. Prisoners sleep on blankets on the floor too tightly packed even to turn around. One inmate awakens the rest each night for mass turnovers. The most privileged inmates sleep on their backs, ringing the walls of the cell. Everyone else sleeps on his side. There are no prison uniforms, no blankets with which to cover themselves, and no soap. Inmates have a monotonous diet of nsima and beans with water. These conditions, together with rampant diseases like scabies and tuberculosis, are the main reasons that Maula Prison lost an average of 30 prisoners a year in 2003 and 2004, about 1 death per 60 inmates. Zomba Prison loses one in 20 inmates annually. When prisoners are found with these diseases, they are not often given medical attention or quarantined, which allows the diseases to spread even further. Malawi prisons with HIV/Aids patients have high death rates due to the prisoners’ weak immune systems worsened by the lack of an appropriate diet and anti-retroviral therapy. Several organizations have challenged the government through the courts to consider having a well- balanced diet for the prisoners who are HIV positive.\\"Cruel prison conditions damage Malawi human rights record, November 5, 2007, Josh Ashaz. www.africanpath.com Another major issue is the lack of legal representation available to the average Malawian. Malawi's 12,000,000 to 13,000,000 citizens have 28 legal aid attorneys and eight prosecutors with law degrees. There are jobs for 32 prosecutors but salaries are so low that vacancies go unfilled. Therefore, except in special cases like murder and manslaughter, almost all accused go to trial without lawyers. Malawi's High Court, which has to pass judgment on all capitals crimes, has not heard a single homicide case in the last year, simply because there is no money to assemble lawyers, judges and witnesses for hearings in the localities where the crimes occurred. There are many cases of people who sit in jail simple because their case files were misplaced. Malawi still has a death penalty, but no execution has been ordered by the last two presidents.Africa News, Inter Press Service, ‘Judges Reject Mandatory Death Penalty’. The current president and the previous president have made an attempt to show amnesty and at the same time relieve the pressure on prisons by pardoning large numbers of prisoners at one time. The previous president Dr Baliki Muluzi in 1995 released 650 prisoners on Malawi's 31st Independence Day celebrations.BBC Summary of World Broadcasts; MBC radio, Blantyre, 7 July 1995. The former president Dr Bingu Wa Mutharika, ordered the release of 398 prisoners in 2007. These were prisoners who had served at least half of their sentence and were of good behavior.BBC Monitoring Africa- Political, Bingu orders the release of about 499 prisoners, July 7, 2007. ==New prisons== The new Mzimba Prison has conditions high above those of many other Malawian prisons, with beds and comfortable mattresses. Prisoners get food three times a day and have well-ventilated cells. The facility also provides services and activities for prisoners, such as teaching them skills so they go back into society as law-abiding citizens. The Malawi Prison Service plans to open additional prisons in Rumphi Mchinji and Salima.http://www.malawi.gov.mw/story.php?id=255 ==References== Category:Prisons in Malawi ","title":"Malawi Prison System"},{"id":"19233635","text":"The intercalated (ITC) cells of the amygdala are a group of GABAergic neurons situated between the basolateral and central nuclei of the amygdala that are important for inhibitory control over the amygdala. ==Function== ITC cells are thought to play a role as the 'off switch' for the amygdala, inhibiting the amygdala's central nucleus output neurons and its basolateral nucleus neurons.

It was implemented on 1 June 2009 by the French government. RSA replaces the Revenu minimum d'insertion; its goal is to provide a minimum income for unemployed and underemployed workers, with the aim of encouraging them to find work, and provide a complement for low-wage workers so that they do not suffer the perverse effects of earning less through employment than unemployment. A worker may receive both RSA and the Prime pour l'emploi (PPE), but the PPE amount is reduced depending on the amount of RSA collected. RSA is also intended to replace Allocation de parent isolé (API) and ultimately various other government-sponsored back-to-work incentives and initiatives such as contrat unique d'insertion, contrat d'accompagnement dans l'emploi and contrat initiative emploi.Projet de loi RSA on Martin Hirsch's site, Toutsurlersa. As of 1 April 2020, the monthly RSA allocation is €550.93 for a single person.Revenu de solidarité active (RSA) : revalorisation exceptionnelle au 1er septembre 2017 service-public.fr Although the initial programme applied only to workers over the age of 25, \\"La loi de finances pour 2010 (article 135)\\"Loi n°2009-1673 du 30 décembre 2009 de finances pour 2010 on the Légifrance site. extended benefits to young people aged 18 to 25 who have worked the equivalent of at least two years over the preceding three calendar years. ==Calculation== If a person's revenue from work does not reach the RSA threshold, the state pays a negative income tax to the employee.

The organization comprises members from all over the world who are either representatives of museums and research institutes or private researchers and enthusiasts. The organization was founded in 1992 as the European Panorama Conference in Szeged/Hungary and renamed in 1998 at Altoetting/Germany the International Panorama Conference. Since 2003 the organization is called International Panorama Council. IPC has been a Membership Association since 2010. It is governed by a member-elected Executive Board whose Secretary-General acts as the operational center for the Board’s members. ==Main goals== The purpose of the International Panorama Council is to stimulate worldwide research and communication about existing and future panoramas and cycloramas, advocate for and help preserve the few surviving heritage panoramas, and promote professional affiliation. IPC serves as a bridge connecting the heritage era of the panorama art form to its contemporary and future manifestations, and strives to facilitate the formal international recognition and protection of panoramas by organizations like UNESCO and the Council of Europe. The International Panorama Council actively supports the preservation of historical panoramas and cycloramas. In 2007 and 2008 it started a lobbying campaign to save the endangered panorama painting and building campaign in Innsbruck/Austria: media articles in Kronenzeitung on March 27, 2008, p. 19, weekly magazine Profil on September 8, 2008, p. 117 and Tiroler Tageszeitung, November 12, 2008 in Innsbruck, Austria. An initiative was taken to support the protection of the endangered Panorama Mesdag.campaign to preserve the endangered Panorama Mesdag, call for action by Europa Nostra on the initiative of IPC Website of Panorama Mesdag with information on the campaign A further goal of the IPC is to have the most important historical panoramas from 19c. enrolled as UNESCO World Heritage sites. A first step has been taken in July 2008 when the Waterloo Panorama was added to Belgium's tentative proposal for the UNESCO list.Belgium's tentative list on website of UNESCO In February 2009 Panorama Mesdag applied for inclusion in the tentative list of the Netherlands. ==Activities== IPC is active in the fields of restoration, research, financing, exhibiting and marketing of panoramas and related art forms from the heritage era to its contemporary and future manifestations. IPC maintains a database of existing panoramas/cycloramas, Moving panoramas, large-scale dioramas and semi-circle panoramas and many other related art and media forms.IPC Database ==Annual conferences== Since 1992 the International Panorama Council has held annual conferences throughout the world. The conferences are planned to provide a meaningful, professional exchange of ideas with lunches and dinners included, and a joint post- conference excursion to a panorama related site. Presentations in the conference proceedings range from illustrated essays on topographical mapping to restoration and conservation techniques. *1992 Szeged-Ópusztaszer, Hungary: Past, Present and Future of Panoramas, founding conference of IPC as a European-based group of interest.

The issue was eventually settled by a number of firms for over $200 million,UPDATE/MICHAEL R. LISSACK; Wall Street Expatriate, The New York Times, April 14th, 2002 to which Lissack was entitled to at least 15% per federal whistleblower laws. Lissack used some of these funds for charitable purposes including endowing a professorship in social responsibility and personal ethics at his alma mater, Williams College. In February 1998, Lissack entered into a voluntary agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission whereby he was banned from the securities industry for five years and paid a $30,000 fine, as part of an arrangement by Lissack's legal team for Lissack to be on record as taking some responsibility for the scandal.Giantkillers: The Team and the Law That Help Whistle-Blowers Recover America By Henry Scammell Later that year Lissack was charged by the Manhattan District Attorney's office with making online solicitations for people to harass executives of his former employer, Salmon Smith Barney, by calling them at company headquarters and in some instances their homes. He pleaded guilty to second-degree harassment (a violation and lesser offense than the misdemeanor harassment charge with which he was originally charged ), admitting he sent phony e-mails to Salomon Smith Barney employees. As part of the guilty plea, Lissack was not sentenced to jail and paid no fine.

The house was purchased by Olmsted's father and given to Frederick Law Olmsted in 1848 to grow crops, plant trees and clear for pasture for livestock. It is on one of the higher hills overlooking Raritan Bay, and Sandy Hook in New Jersey. The first owner of the property was Dominic Petrus Teaschenmaker who acquired a patent on the property from Governor Thomas Dongan on November 3, 1685. The property was acquired in the late 17th century (c. 1696) and the stone basement of the structure was enlarged into a Flemish Style farm house by Jacques Poillon, the Richmond County Road Commissioner under Governor Slaughter, and one of the original Huguenot settlers of Staten Island. By 1723, three generations of the Poillon family had lived in this farmhouse and during the Revolutionary War, John Poillon, a member of the Committee of Safety for Richmond County, helped bring about the famous, though ill-fated, Peace Conference at Bentley Manor in the Billopp House, now known as the Conference House. Dr. Samuel Akerly (one of the founders of the New York Institute for the Blind) enlarged the farmhouse to thirteen rooms. Dr. Akerly wrote many essays on the use of farmland on Staten Island and revolutionized the uses of farming equipment and the rotations of crops. The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation is in the process of restoring the farmhouse back to the way Olmsted had it when he resided there. Olmsted Farmhouse with porches in 1924 2020 Olmsted renamed the farmhouse, Tosomock, to honor its first owner, Teaschenmaker.Hughes, C. J. (August 4, 2012). \\"A Lab, a Home, a Memory\\". The New York Times. nytimes.com. Retrieved 2018-10-05. Olmsted had greatly improved the structure by adding a -story addition to the top of the house, with small windows on the top floor under the roof attic eaves. He also added porches on all three sides of the farmhouse, which have since been demolished. Olmsted used the property as a tree nursery and planted many unusual specimens of trees on his farm. In the photo you see one of the tremendous Cedar of Lebanon conifers. There are some Osage Orange trees not far from the property as well. The farm originally encompassed land across the main thoroughfare of Hylan Boulevard, between that road and the beach. After Olmsted sold the farm, it was from then on referred to as the Woods of Arden. The house was named a New York City designated landmark in 1967. It has since fallen in disrepair. Renovations and repairs cannot be completed until preservation funds have been raised. == See also == * List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Staten Island * National Register of Historic Places listings in Richmond County, New York ==References Sources == *Poillon-Akerly-Olmsted House - Neighborhood Preservation Center, New York, New York *. , ==External links== Category:History of New York City Category:Houses in Staten Island Category:New York City Designated Landmarks in Staten Island ","title":"Olmsted–Beil House"},{"id":"19233731","text":"Twing.com was a search engine specializing in internet forum content, located in Jersey City, New Jersey, with data centers around the world. Twing.com used vertical searching as a forum search service that seeks out communities based on common forum formats. The product disappeared from the Web in late November, 2008, when the product division's parent company Accoona ceased business operations. In early 2013, a new startup named Twing.co launched. Beyond their common name, these companies are not related. Twing.co is a peer- to-peer professional networking platform supported by a knowledge based search engine that focuses on open innovation and collaboration. It was recently named among the Top 20 New Big Data Startups by DataWeek. Twing.com did not use the typical web crawler method but recognizes the footprint and structure of forum content and indexes such content according to its context, and then allows for word sense disambiguation of concepts through use of topical category and other filters. Additionally, prior to ceasing operations, Twing.com began collecting and indexing content from Twitter and other real- time user generated content sources. ==Content disambiguation== To allow for disambiguation, Twing.com is utilizing interface concepts such as Faceted Search and Filtering in the Search Engine Result Pages, (SERPs). These are advanced search methods that attempt to assist users with their information foraging efforts by keeping them on an information scent trail. Category filters, based on the directory taxonomy, are one of the filtering methods available. This is an attempt to solve the generalized search problem of ambiguity that often occurs in search results as well as forum search results. A good example might be the word \\"bass.\\" If you do a search for bass on Wikipedia, you get a disambiguation page to determine if the phrase in this case means a musical instrument, a company name, part of a place name, a beverage, and other options. While adding key terms to a search may sometimes collapse ambiguities, doing so can also exclude things of value. So category filters can help solve the problem of ambiguity in search engine results, whether such search engines are forum search specific or not. Additional filters are available based on language entity extraction from content and proprietary algorithms and dictionaries. Twing.com's use of such technology is discernible from seeing the filters available within the search results pages. ==Forum content collection== The Twing.com robot, (called Twingbot), was designed to understand the formats of Internet Forums, (a.k.a. Bulletin Boards or Discussion Groups.) While the Twing.com product was open to the world in January, 2008, the Twingbot robot had been observed 'in the wild' at least several months earlier. (The Twingbot robot had identified itself as User- Agent: Twingbot/1.0 and formerly had its own descriptive web page at www.twingbot.com/) ==See also== * Internet forum * Web search engine * Vertical search * List of search engines * Word sense disambiguation ==References * Some Historical Screen Shots of Twing Community Search Product from November, 2008 prior to closing of parent company Accoona * PC Magazine Search Without Google Part II Page 1 and Part II Page 2 * Affiliate Marketing Forum * ABC News: Ahead of the Curve * AppScout: Twing - Search Forums and Discover Communities * Mashable: Twing Buzz Graphs * Red Ferret Journal March 11, 2008 Article * SEO Roundtable: Search SEO Forums and More with Twing * Tech2All: Twing - The Forum Search Engine * About Buzz Reputation Tracking in Forums * Twing: Searching the Deep Web Category:Internet search engines Category:Companies based in Jersey City, New Jersey ","title":"Twing"},{"id":"19233735","text":"Homeland Bridge () is an bridge over the Sava River located in southeastern Zagreb, Croatia. Its administrative location is the city district Peščenica - Žitnjak. The bridge carries four lanes connecting the Radnička street between the Petruševec neighborhood in the north and the Kosnica interchange with the Zagreb bypass in the south. The bridge was built in the mid-2000s and opened in the spring of 2007 after numerous delays. It was formally opened by the Zagreb mayor Milan Bandić and the Minister of construction Marina Matulović- Dropulić.\\"Homeland bridge finally opened\\", May 5, 2007, Nova TV The bridge is a part of a transportation project to improve and widen the connections of the satellite city Velika Gorica to Zagreb. Nevertheless, currently it alone does not achieve this goal, because the access road (Radnička street) towards it has remained narrow, pending reconstruction, and the road afterwards leads only towards the beltway, it does not continue towards Velika Gorica, to the dismay of local residents.News bulletin by the local town council of Kosnica , Predrag Vlašić, president, Glasnik Andautonije, July 2008\\"The bridge that connects Zagreb to nowhere\\" The road is supposed to connect Kosnica and Velika Gorica and continue southwards along the route of the D31 state road. The bridge has space reserved on the median for two light railroad tracks (intended for the proposed line to Zagreb Airport).

He played all or part of five seasons in the majors, from until . Kinney was selected by the Cleveland Indians in the 10th round of the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft, and he played in their organization through his major league debut in 1978. He was given a chance at closing games for the Indians, notching five saves in 18 games. That June, however, he was traded to the San Diego Padres for pitcher Dan Spillner. Kinney's one full season in the majors came in for the Padres. That year, he pitched in 50 games as a reliever, compiling a 4–6 record with a 4.25 ERA and one save. In December, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers for outfielder Dave Stegman, but appeared in just six games for the Tigers before being released in the offseason. After a brief trial with the Oakland Athletics in , his major league career was over. On August 21, 1980, with the Padres trailing the host Philadelphia Phillies, 7–6, Kinney came in to pitch the bottom of the 8th inning surrendering a single and a run-scoring double to the first two batters he faced. The Padres rallied with 2 runs of their own in the top of the 9th inning to tie the score, 8–8. The relief appearance lasted 9 innings as Bake McBride's triple plated a run in the bottom of the 17th inning for the Phillies' 9–8 victory. ==References Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:San Diego Padres players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Oakland Athletics players Category:Gulf Coast Indians players Category:Reno Silver Sox players Category:San Antonio Brewers players Category:San Jose Bees players Category:Williamsport Tomahawks players Category:Toledo Mud Hens players Category:Jersey City Indians players Category:Hawaii Islanders players Category:Evansville Triplets players Category:Tacoma Tigers players Category:Baseball players from Ohio Category:1952 births Category:Living people ","title":"Dennis Kinney"},{"id":"19233748","text":"The 2008–09 Mid-American Conference season is a National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I conference.

The stadium is home to the John A. Holmes High School Aces as well as the Edenton Steamers of the Coastal Plain League. Hicks Field was a Works Progress Administration project in 1939 at the corner of East Freemason and Woodward, adjacent to John A. Holmes High School. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The main structure is a wood grandstand with a roof that was built to accommodate slightly more than 500 people. The main grandstand is the oldest remaining wooden grandstand of its type in the state of North Carolina. Over the years, Hicks Field has been home to many minor league and semipro baseball teams, including the Edenton Colonials of the Virginia League in 1951, the original Coastal Plain League in 1952 and the semipro Albemarle League. Beginning in the 1930s, the Albemarle League was well known for high- level baseball as both top local players and college stars from around the region suited up for teams also representing Elizabeth City, Hertford, Colerain, Windsor and Williamston.Holaday, Chris (1998). Professional Baseball in North Carolina: An Illustrated City-by-city History, 1901-1996. Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland. . Hicks Field was also the longtime spring training site for a number of minor league teams during the 1940s, including Binghamton, New York, and Reading, Pennsylvania. Players such as Bob Feller and other major league all-stars have stepped foot inside this historic stadium. In 1946 Hicks Field played host to arguably one of the best games of that era as an Albemarle League all-star team faced off against a major league all star team composed of players from the Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees, Washington Senators and Chicago White Sox. The Albemarle team was defeated but for the 4,500 in attendance they were treated to some of the best players in all of baseball. In 1997 Hicks Field underwent extensive renovations including a complete remodeling of the main grandstand behind home plate and the addition of two new grandstands; one down the first baseline and one down the third baseline as well. New bathrooms were built. as well as a manual wooden scoreboard that was placed in right field as well as double decking the outfield fence in left field to give Hicks a \\"Fenway Park\\" feel. After all of the renovations were complete Hicks Field grew in capacity to seat 1,200 people. In 1998 the Edenton Steamers were formed in the new Coastal Plain League summer collegiate baseball league. Hicks Field continues to host the Steamers, Edenton-Holmes high school baseball, American Legion Post 40 contests, and various tournaments in the summer. In 2004 Baseball America rated Historic Hicks Field the #2 summer collegiate venue in the country. ==References== Category:Baseball venues in North Carolina Category:Buildings and structures in Chowan County, North Carolina Category:Sports venues on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Works Progress Administration in North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Chowan County, North Carolina Category:1939 establishments in North Carolina Category:Sports venues completed in 1939 Category:High school baseball venues in the United States Category:Minor league baseball venues ","title":"Historic Hicks Field"},{"id":"19233779","text":"Andre Agassi was the defending champion, but retired from his semifinals match this year.

LISSACK; Wall Street Expatriate, New York Times, April 14, 2002 The scam was initially exposed by whistleblower Michael Lissack in 1994, and eventually the firms involved settled with the government for $205 million.\\"Whistleblower Says Dealers \`Laundered' Bond Prices,\\" Bloomberg News, September 2, 2008 The New York Times described the scam as follows: :To refinance their old, expensive debt when interest rates fall, municipalities often sell new bonds and put the proceeds into temporary escrow accounts. By law, those accounts cannot generate a higher rate of interest than the rate on the newly issued bonds; if they do, the excess is considered to be arbitrage profit, and it must be rebated to the Federal Government. :To comply with that law, issuers typically buy a mix of ordinary Treasury securities in the open market or special securities, called slugs, from the Treasury. In yield burning, underwriters sell the issuers Treasury securities at inflated prices, which cuts the yield to levels that appear to meet the escrow requirements but that also generate substantial profits for the underwriters. By some estimates, underwriters may have earned $2 billion to $3 billion of illegal profits from yield burning since the late 1970s.\\"Market Place;Municipal bond investors could wind up in an I.R.S. crackdown,\\" New York Times, July 25, 1996 Lissack's initial whistleblowing and cases did not seem to stop the practice. Yield burning can take multiple forms including the over pricing of securities and providing under market yields on reinvestment contracts. In 2004, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit described the following: :In the present case, the alleged fraud arises from Sakura's sale of forward supply agreements to municipal bond issuers. Lissack claims that Sakura fraudulently mispriced forward supply agreements by rigging the bidding process for the agreements. According to Lissack, Sakura arranged for noncompetitive bidders to make bids well below market value, thus ensuring that Sakura's similarly below-market-value bid would be selected by the municipalities. The Second Amended Complaint alleges the following conduct: :Sakura and its co- conspirators also corrupted, and conspired to corrupt, the bid selection process by, inter alia, selecting non-competitive bidders to participate in the bid process; communicating \\"not to exceed\\" bid amounts to \\"losing\\" bidders; selecting fewer than three disinterested bidders to participate in the bid process; providing false or misleading information in order to cause legitimate bidders to submit artificially low bids; diverting portions of anticipated profits to pay off co-conspirators that solicited non-competitive bids or otherwise ensured Sakura's selection as forward supply provider. :Lissack claims that Sakura concealed the sham bidding process from the involved municipalities and made false statements and misrepresentations in writing that the transactions complied with federal law.https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1380058.html By 2005, federal regulators became concerned that the yield burning scandal was having a redux.http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06341/744349-28.stm Some of the concern stemmed from a ruling in Lissack's qui tam case, which held yield burning to be a tax issue and thus exempt from the provisions of the federal False Claims Act.http://www.bondbuyer.com/news/-141894-1.htmlhttp://www.law.com/jsp/nylj/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=900005413923 Yield burning was, however, directly covered by the Internal Revenue Code tax whistleblower provisions that took effect in 2007.https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid;=aN2xzV6HmR7I&refer;=columnist_mysak Several major firms ultimately reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Internal Revenue Service regarding a replay of the bid rigging practices that had been originally exposed by Lissack's qui tam suit (the basis of the 2nd District Court language above). More lawsuits and investigations continue to the present day.http://www.bondbuyer.com/issues/119_483/bank-of-america- merrill-1020832-1.html In July 2011, JPMorgan Chase became the third major institution (after Bank of America and UBS) to settle with regulators bring the total recovered in the present round of activity to nearly $500 million.http://professional.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110707-709842.html ==References== Category:Fraud in the United States Category:Corporate scandals Category:Accounting scandals ","title":"Yield burning"},{"id":"19233810","text":"The Škoda Yeti (codenamed Typ 5L)ETKA, accessed 27 January 2010 is a compact sport-utility vehicle (SUV) produced by the Czech car manufacturer Škoda Auto and introduced at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show, as the carmaker's first entry into the SUV market. In 2009, the Yeti was awarded Family Car of the Year by Top Gear Magazine. ==Overview== At the Geneva Motor Show in 2005, Škoda unveiled a concept car in the compact SUV category which it called the Yeti. The conceptual study of the Yeti explored feasibility of a future series- produced vehicle, some solutions did not see production, including a single vertical windscreen wiper moving horizontally across the whole of the glass or horizontally divided hatch, the lower part of which was split into an inner and outer section so that two bicycles could safely be secured to the lowered outer section. Pre-facelift Škoda Yeti (United Kingdom) Interior Four years later, Škoda premiered the production version of the Yeti at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show. The car featured similar practical boxy design as the design study. Despite compact dimensions (length: 4,223 mm / 166.26 in; width: 1,793 mm / 70.60 in; wheelbase: 2,579 mm / 101.54 in), the Yeti offered spacious interior. Utilisation of interior was enhanced by the VarioFlex – the variable layout of the rear seats. This feature was taken from the Roomster. There are three separate seats with adjustable backrest inclination covering a range of 13.5°. The Yeti's outer seats can slide backwards and forwards; after the middle seat has been removed, the outer seats can be moved 80 mm (3.15 in) towards the centre, thus creating exceptional room for two rear passengers. The possibility of folding down the backrest, and then folding the entire seat forwards, has not been changed. Once the seats have been folded over and forwards in this way, they can be removed by means of a simple release function. Differences compared to the VarioFlex system used in the Roomster: the cushion of the middle seat has been repositioned so that it is 70 mm (2.76 in) more towards the back compared to the outer seat cushions (in the Roomster it is level); the cushion of the middle seat is approximately 35 mm longer than the cushion in the Roomster; after the middle seat is removed, the outer seats can be moved towards the centre by 80 mm (in the Roomster by 110 mm / 4.33 in). The front passenger seat can be folded forward into a horizontal position to allow the transportation of long objects. Its luggage capacity, aided by the 'VarioFlex' rear seats, ranges from 405 litres (14.3 cu ft), up to 1,760 litres (62.2 cu ft) when the rear seats are removed. The powertrain offerings in the Yeti included a range of internal combustion engines, all of which are four cylinder (I4) four-stroke turbocharged and EU5 emissions standard compliant. and EU5 emissions standard compliant.[10] petrol engines are all fuel injected and diesel engines are all common rail (CR) Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) with diesel particulate filter (DPF). Most engines were offered with six speed manual transmissions. A five speed manual was reserved for front wheel drive only cars with the 81 kW TDI engine. The Volkswagen Group seven speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) was option exclusively for the 1.2 TSI, while the six speed Direct-Shift Gearbox (DSG) was available for the 103 kW (140 PS) two litre common rail diesel engine. The four-wheel drive variants utilised the fourth generation Haldex Traction multi plate clutch to transmit the drive to the rear wheels, and all drive layouts include fully independent multi link rear suspension first seen on the Volkswagen Golf Mk5 to complement the fully independent front suspension. The all wheel drive Yeti cars featured Off Road button to switch all assistance systems to a special off-road setting, e.g. the accelerator responded less sensitively. A set of Off-Road functions included also a hill descent control, that used sensitive braking to maintain a constant speed descending steep slopes, regardless of whether the vehicle was in any of the gears from one to three, reverse, or neutral. The Škoda Yeti was awarded a five star safety rating by the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP). It scored 92% for adult occupant protection in the frontal and side crash tests, 78% for child occupant protection and 46% in the pedestrian safety test.[8] It also scored 71% for default Safety Assist equipment, as the range came with driver/passenger seatbelt reminders as standard. It also included Electronic Stability Programme (ESP) with Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Hydraulic Brake Assist (HBA), Anti-Slip Regulation (ASR) – which is currently standard equipment on most variants throughout Europe and optional on others. Protection against whiplash injury in the rear impact (whiplash) test was also good. The Yeti could be ordered with up to 9 airbags (dual front, front side torso, rear side torso, side curtain, and driver's knee airbag). In most of Europe, the Yeti was available with three different trim levels: Experience, Ambition and Track (or Active in some markets). However, in the United Kingdom, it was available in five trim levels, E, S, SE, SE Plus and Elegance. In India, it was available in \\"Active\\", \\"Ambition\\" (also called \\"Ambiente\\") and \\"Elegance\\" trims. An extensive list of standard and extras was available, incl. bi xenon headlamps with AFS, front/rear proximity sensors, automatic park assist system, tyre pressure monitoring system, navigation system with large 6.5” colour touch screen display and 30 GB hard drive, electrically adjustable seat and mirrors, rain sensor, front heated seats and a large tilt/slide two piece panoramic sunroof. ===Safety=== In May 2017 Škoda Australia advised that a software update had been released by VW for DSG transmissions to reduce wear in the dual clutch assemblies. This is achieved by automatically disengaging the clutch without warning when the clutch temperature reaches 200°C. This design change also introduces a variable delayed throttle response and shuddering in first gear as \\"normal operation\\". === Facelift === Škoda Yeti facelift Škoda Yeti pre-facelift and post-facelift comparison A revamped version of the Yeti had its official exhibition premiere at the Frankfurt International Motor Show in September 2013. Following the facelift, Škoda's compact SUV was available in two design versions shorter by just 1 mm in comparison to the original model: sleek Yeti and rugged Yeti Outdoor. The main difference could be found in shape of front/rear bumper; the Outdoor version had parts exposed to potential damage from terrain (lower parts of bumpers, sills) finished in black, while the ‘urban‘ Yeti has them painted in body colour. They varied also in the offer of wheel designs and upholstery. Both versions could be ordered in top of the range trim Laurin & Klement, the ‘urban‘ Yeti also in ‘Monte Carlo‘ sports design version. The technology had also been updated. Four wheel drive was powered by the fifth generation Haldex electro hydraulically controlled multi plate coupling located at the rear axle in the same housing as the final drive and rear differential. The operating principle was much the same as the fourth generation used in the pre facelift previous model. There had been a technical change in the way oil pressure was regulated in the clutch, i.e. FWD switching. Oil pressure on the clutch plates was, after the facelift, regulated by a centrifugal valve integrated in the electric axial six piston oil pump. Compared to the previous generation, the Haldex 5 system was 1.4 kg lighter (ca. 6.6 kg without oil) and simpler as it didn't contain an oil pressure accumulator. The drivetrain line up featured some new combinations: seven speed DSG with the 1.6 TDI engine (currently with five speed manual for the GreenLine only), front wheel drive with the 103 kW two litre diesel and six speed manual (currently as all wheel drive only) and six speed DSG with the 125 kW two litre diesel and all-wheel drive (so far six speed manual only). As for the equipment, the facelifted Yeti became the first Škoda car to offer rear view parking camera. It is automatically activated when reverse gear is engaged: it displays the space behind the car and indicates the driving line, based on the vehicle width. List of features was extended by – among others – keyless system for locking/unlocking doors and starting engine (KESSY), and rechargeable LED torch in boot. Škoda unveiled Yeti Xtreme design study at the 33rd GTI Treffen. ===China=== A special version of the Yeti was offered in China. The car has 60 mm longer wheelbase and spare wheel can be mounted on a fifth door. ===Engines=== Overview of engines available for the Yeti (Typ 5L), incl. facelifted model.

He even changed his Sanskrit name to its Tamil translation. When the Madras University proposed to exclude Tamil from its syllabus, Parithimar Kalaignar vehemently protested against the proposal forcing the authorities to drop the move. In 1902, he proposed that Tamil be designated as a \\"classical language\\" thereby becoming the first person to make such a petition. Parithimar Kalignar is also known as Dravida Sastri. Parithimar Kalaignar was also the first to use the Tamil name Kumarinadu for the mythical lost-land of Lemuria. == Death == Paritihimar Kalaignar died in 1903 due to tuberculosis at the age of 33. == Legacy == Kalaignar on a 2007 stamp of India Parithimar Kalaignar is regarded as an inspiration for Tamil enthusiasts as Maraimalai Adigal and the Tanittamil Iyakkam.

Until 2007, the company was an online car retailer focusing on consumer sales. RBS put Dixon Motor Holdings into administration in 2007, removing jamjar.com's capacity to operate as an online car retailer. Lombard Vehicle Management took control of the company and the business to a vehicle financing brokerage. == Jamjarcars under Lombard Vehicle Management (2007-2009) == Lombard Vehicle Management, the vehicle financing branch of RBS, took control of Jamjarcars in 2007, following the decision to put Dixon Motor Holdings into administration. Under the management of LVM, jamjar.com was used as an online car finance broker. In 2009, Lombard made the decision to stop using brokers, instead changing to a direct to end user business model. This decision led to the closure of Jamjarcars, as Lombard no longer had any need for its brokerage service. == Jamjar.com under Grapevine Europe Ltd. (2015-present) == The director of Grapevine Europe Ltd., Andrew King, purchased the rights to the Jamjarcars name in 2015, also acquiring the jamjar.com domain that the previous business had used. There is no connection between the existing Jamjarcars business and the former RBS-owned business. Nottinghamshire-based Grapevine Europe specialises in buying and selling motor vehicles. It was founded by Andrew King in 2009 as a parent company for Sell Your Jamjar. Sell Your Jamjar was the first online car buying business to exist in the UK. The closure of RBS’ Jamjarcars business presented Grapevine Europe with the opportunity to develop their Jamjar brand and their online car buying offering. With King’s purchase of jamjar.com and the Jamjarcars name, Grapevine developed an online car buyer comparison service named Jamjar. The business now allows vehicle owners to compare offers for their vehicle from online buying services. ==References== Category:Royal Bank of Scotland Category:Financial services companies established in 2000 Category:Retail companies established in 2000 Category:Internet properties established in 2000 Category:Leasing companies ","title":"Jamjarcars"},{"id":"19233871","text":"Hugo Rodrigues (born 22 November 1979) is a Portuguese former footballer who played as a centre-back. Noted as one of the tallest footballers to play in the Football League, Rodrigues started his career with local club C.D. Feirense before playing in the Portuguese lower division sides Paços de Brandão and Perosinho and then Portuguese Second Division side Pedras Rubras. After a local agent suggested he should try English football he signed for Third Division side Yeovil Town in 2003. Despite being offered a new contract he retired from professional football at the age of 24 and returned to Portugal to complete his university studies. ==Career== Rodrigues started his career as a youth player at Feirense, and as a 15-year old he attracted interest from FC Porto but was denied the move after Feirense demanded £30,000 for his services, something unheard of in Portuguese football at the time. Having left Fierense, Rodrigues played lower league football in Portugal with Paços de Brandão and Perosinho, before joining Portuguese Second Division side Pedras Rubras, a club which allowed him to play whilst simultaneously completing his economics degree. With Rodrigues wanting to play in England to help improve his English for his family's business, local agent Raul Sanha organised him a trial with newly promoted Football League Third Division side Yeovil Town. Rodrigues signed for Yeovil, on 24 July 2003 following a successful trial on a one-year contract. Rodrigues made his debut for Yeovil as the club's first substitute in the Football League on the opening day of the 2003–04 season against Rochdale, on 9 August 2003. Rodrigues also received the club's first Football League yellow card in that same match. Even prior to his Football League debut, Rodrigues had gained national media attention due to his height, and at was acclaimed as the tallest player in the Football League. On 4 January 2004, Yeovil faced Liverpool in the FA Cup third round, with Liverpool leading 1–0 Rodrigues conceded a penalty after he was adjudged to have fouled winger Harry Kewell. After the match Rodrigues claimed that Kewell admitted to \\"diving\\" to win the penalty, a claim that was later denied by Kewell. On 1 May 2004, Rodrigues scored his first, and only, goal for Yeovil with a powerful header from a free-kick in a 2–1 defeat against Hull City. Rodrigues ended the season with 38 appearances in all competitions for Yeovil, as he helped the club finish eighth in their first season in the Football League, just missing out on the play-offs on goal difference Rodrigues was offered a new contract at the end of the season by Yeovil manager Gary Johnson, but after the departure of fellow Portuguese footballer Dani Rodrigues, and a teammate of his at Feirense, Johnson revealed that Rodrigues had rejected the offer of a new contract to return to his native Portugal. After leaving Yeovil, Rodrigues explained the reasons behind his departure that he \\"was missing my family so much\\" and that he \\"might have remained had Dani (Rodrigues) stayed on but went home and settled for playing part-time with [his] friends.\\" ==Career statistics== { class= style=\\"text-align: center\\" + Appearances and goals by club, season and competition - !rowspan=2Club !rowspan=2Season !colspan=3League !colspan=2FA Cup !colspan=2League Cup !colspan=2Other !colspan=2Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - Yeovil Town 2003–04 Third Division 341201010381 - !colspan=3Career total !341201010381 } ==Personal life== Born in Santa Maria da Feira he grew up in the village of Paços de Brandão, near Porto, where his parents ran their own business making and exporting wine corks.

It replaced Anderson Arena as the home of the Bowling Green Falcons men's and women's basketball and women's volleyball teams and hosts music concerts and the university's commencement ceremonies. The arena was designed by the architectural firm Rossetti Architects, designers of Red Bull Arena and Rio Tinto Stadium, and engineering firm URS Group Inc. The building opened in September 2011 and seats 4,387 people for basketball and volleyball games and 5,209 for convocation events and concerts. ==History== After almost five decades of service to Bowling Green State University, it became apparent that Anderson Arena was at the end of its useful life due to its limited accommodations. There were only two restrooms in the entire arena and poor acoustics for concerts, and it also lacked air conditioning. The most glaring factor that demanded replacement of Anderson Arena was that it was severely out of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. All of these proved detrimental to the university's image and recruiting abilities. ===Fundraising=== At the men's basketball 2008 home finale against rival Kent State, Kermit Stroh, a trustee of the university from 1993-2002, and his late wife Mary Lu donated a university record $8.7 million to the university towards interscholastic athletics with $7.7 million marked for the building of a new convocation center that was to replace Anderson Arena. After a fundraiser that netted $13.5 million, including the $7.7 million from the Strohs, Bowling Green earmarked $36 million to fund the construction of the new arena, which included a $60 student fee every semester once the building was opened until the loans for the construction of the arena were paid off. As plans for the arena accelerated despite the university's poor financial situation, several students formed a coalition to have a student vote on the Undergraduate Student Government's resolution that the student body supported paying the extra fee, leaving the passage of the resolution to the students in a vote. The subsequent vote was held online in late March 2009, 28% of the student population participated in the vote and approved of the future fee with 2,630 students in favor, while 1,182 were opposed. ===Construction=== Seven sites around the campus were under consideration for the construction of the Stroh Center, including the adjacent parking lot next to Memorial Hall which houses Anderson Arena and the intramural fields between Doyt Perry Stadium and the Kreischer residence halls. The university ultimately decided to build the arena on a large parking lot along Wooster Street and Mercer Road at the east end of the campus that served as one of two parking lots for students that resided in the dormitories on campus. Ground was broken on September 3, 2009 as Kerm Stroh dug a patch of ground with a backhoe at a ceremony attended by around 450 spectators and media. The first steel beam was installed at the Stroh Center site on January 25, 2010 and the site's topping off occurred during a ceremony on May 3, 2010. ===Falcon Statue=== In July 2008, the university announced that a 2-ton, falcon statue would be installed at the entrance of the new arena. The statue was a gift from North Carolina philanthropist, Irwin Belk, and cost $100,000. The statue was designed by the Jon Hair Studio of Fine Art near Cornelius, North Carolina and will be the largest bronze falcon statue in the world. The falcon statue was installed in November 2010 and became part of the Falcon Spirit Plaza at the front entrance of the Stroh Center. ==Design and amenities== Tiffin on November 5, 2011. The Stroh Center was designed by Rossetti Architects of Southfield, Michigan and the Cleveland office of the URS Group Inc. engineering firm. A major goal of the construction was to replicate the intimacy of Anderson Arena, while providing athletes and spectators the modern comforts of a state-of-the-art convocation center. To accommodate this the Stroh Center was built in a theatre-in-the-round design, providing an open walkway allowing spectators to walk completely around the facility without missing the event on the stadium floor. The arena also includes 88 courtside seats and the furthest seat in the arena, from the court, is only further from the furthest seat at Anderson Arena. The seat widths at the Stroh Center range from 19-22 inches, while the largest seat at Anderson was only 18 inches. The arena also has four restrooms each at the north and south ends of the arena, two for women, one for men and one for families and provides four concession areas in the open walkways. ===Schmidthorst Pavilion=== An auxiliary gym at the Stroh Center, called the Schmidthorst Pavilion, was paid for with a $1.7 million donation from Allen and Carol Schmidthorst, while the court for the gym was paid for with a $1 million donation from Bowling Green alumnus Larry Miles. The auxiliary practice gym built with the combined $2.7 million helps the men's and women's basketball teams avoid scheduling conflicts with the arena, an amenity that was not available at the Anderson Arena. The arena also includes four visiting team locker rooms that can accommodate multiple teams that allow it to support events such as high school basketball tournaments. ===Video Board=== The main video board at the Stroh Center is high by wide with fixed sponsor elements and decorative cladding developed by Capturion Network LLC. The scoreboard hangs above the west basket and can operate as one large screen or be divided into multiple sections which have the ability to display real-time statistics, sponsor graphics, 3D animations and HD live or recorded video. Along with the scoreboard, Capturion manufactured the scorer's tables and press row which also feature the company's latest technology. There also is a \\"ribbon board\\" on the east end of the court with a variety of other scoreboards. ===Schmidthorst Heritage Hall=== The Schmidthorst Heritage Hall The Stroh Center also holds a prominently placed Hall of Fame to commemorate the history of athletics at Bowling Green State University that includes exhibits and display cases that hold items on a rotating basis. There is also a designated area within the arena for cataloging and storing items not currently on display. Before the facilities at the Stroh Center, almost all memorabilia and artifacts related to Bowling Green athletics since the university's opening in 1910 had been stored in boxes in a small room just off the lobby of Anderson Arena in Memorial Hall and voluntarily collected and stored by former Bowling Green men's soccer and lacrosse coach Mickey Cochrane, who is namesake for the Mickey Cochrane Stadium which serves as the home of the Bowling Green Falcons men's and women's soccer teams. On February 8, 2020 the Hall of Fame was dedicated as the Schmidthorst Heritage Hall following renovations, adding items from the Cochrane Cunningham Archives to the hall. ===Anderson Club=== Harold Anderson, former Bowling Green men's basketball coach and athletic director and namesake for the Stroh Center's predecessor Anderson Arena, is remembered with the Anderson Club. The Anderson Club consists of an approximately club area and chair back seating for roughly 400 fans. It includes hospitality areas, food and beverage service, high-definition televisions and areas to view the games. The Anderson Club area is located on the concourse level on the south side of the arena at mid-court and seating for fans extends to the floor-level row. ==Notable events== President Obama speaking at the Stroh Center. The Stroh Center held its first ticketed event, a concert by Christian rock band Sanctus Real, on August 13, 2011. The first Bowling Green athletic event at the new arena was a women's volleyball match between Bowling Green and Michigan State on September 9. The Bowling Green Falcons defeated the Spartans in four games, 3-1 with the attendance of 2,961 people. The men's basketball team played their first game at the Stroh Center on November 11, a 63–48 win over Howard in front of 3,476 fans. The women's team played their home opener against Purdue six days later, falling to the 20th-ranked Boilermakers 54–53 with 1,932 in attendance. The Stroh Center Stadium hosted a regular season game between the Bowling Green men's basketball team and the nationally prominent Michigan State men's basketball team during the 2012-13 men's basketball season and hosting first and second round games of the 2012 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament. In September 2012, President Barack Obama gave a speech at the Stroh Center during his re-election campaign. Throughout the early years of its existence, the Stroh Center has held concerts with various artists. The most notable have been Chris Young, Florida Georgia Line, Kenny Rogers, and Cleveland-based rapper Machine Gun Kelly. Later performances included B.o.B., Nick Jonas, Kesha, Hunter Hayes, and Kip Moore. The Hatch, an annual entrepreneurship competition inspired by Shark Tank and organized by the College of Business Administration moved from the Student Union to the Stroh Center in 2015. The Stroh Center also hosts the Falcon BEST Robotics competition annually in the fall. ==See also== * List of NCAA Division I basketball arenas ==References *Official website *Stroh Center page at Bowling Green Falcons official website Category:College basketball venues in the United States Category:Bowling Green Falcons men's basketball Category:Bowling Green Falcons women's basketball Category:Basketball venues in Ohio Category:Indoor arenas in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Wood County, Ohio Category:Sports venues completed in 2011 Category:2011 establishments in Ohio ","title":"Stroh Center"},{"id":"19233971","text":"Victor Adolphus Pépin (March 8, 1780 – 1845) was an American circus performer and circus owner most famous for being a partner in the Circus of Pépin and Breschard.The Circus in America: 1793 - 1940 The Circus of Pépin and Breschard can thus be considered the first American circus and Pépin the first American circus impresario. ==Biography== Victor Adolphus Pépin, the eldest son of André Pepin, a Canadian who fought for the Americans in their Revolution against the British, was born in Albany, New York.

Harvey who played for the Wednesbury Strollers and for England against Wales in the third international between the countries in February 1881. His first name (Alf or Alfred) was published in 1890, in 'Triumphs Of The Football Field' an autobiography by Aston Villa's captain Archie Hunter. The main contenders were: :a 31-year-old shoemaker born in Stone, Staffordshire; :a 23-year-old coalminer born in Rugeley, Staffordshire; :a 21-year-old potter born in Stoke-on-Trent; :a 20-year-old apprentice saddler from Walsall; :a 19-year-old bricklayer born in Stoke-on-Trent; :a 32-year-old tinplate stamper born in Birmingham; :a 27-year-old tinplate worker born in Birmingham; :a 24-year-old gun barrel borer born in Birmingham. Research undertaken by the author of englandfootballonline has led him to conclude that the most likely candidate is Alf Harvey, a gun barrel borer born in Aston, Birmingham on 5 July 1856., Retrieved 21 September 2018 ==Football career== He was registered with Wednesbury Strollers at the time of the international, and he later played representative football for Staffordshire. In his 1881 Football Annual, Charles Alcock described him as \\"a clever, hard-working back; dodges well.\\" He also played for Aston Villa, a fact confirmed by the Archie Hunter book: \\"Tom Bryan, who belonged to the Wednesbury Strollers . . . He had had for comrades at Wednesbury, Alfred Harvey and Eli Davis, who afterwards joined Villa\\". Later in same book: Alf Harvey played for Villa on 10 April 1883, and \\"Eli Davis and Alf Harvey, who were then the two finest left-wingers in the district\\". From September 1883 to February 1884, he also played for Holte Villa and contemporary newspapers show him playing for Birmingham Excelsior from October 1886 to October 1888. Harvey was selected to play for England against Wales on 26 February 1881 at Alexandra Meadows, Blackburn. The English selectors had picked an inexperienced team with seven players making their debuts. Harvey came in as a replacement for Edwin Luntley, and his error led to the only goal of the game. According to the Blackburn Standard of 5 March 1881, \\"Tis true Harvey ought to have returned the leather, but he missed his kick entirely\\". And the same day's edition of the Wrexham Advertiser refers to \\"Harvey clean missing his kick\\". England were \\"a little over-confident against the Welsh, who recorded their first victory on English soil with a 1–0 success\\". ==Family life== He married Margaret June Jenkins in Birmingham in April 1891 and died at Rugby on 26 February 1943 aged 86. ==References *Profile at www.englandstats.com *Profile at www.englandfc.com *Biography at www.englandfootballonline.com *Who was Alf Harvey? by Patrick Talbot – Article in \\"Black Country Bugle\\" Category:1856 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Footballers from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:English footballers Category:England international footballers Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Association football defenders ","title":"Alf Harvey"},{"id":"19234017","text":"Benjamin Youngs Prime (December 20, 1733 - October 31, 1791) was an American poet, essayist, and songwriter.

It also introduced a platformer-style side-scrolling view, including the ability to jump. The side-scrolling view is used during exploration and switches to the overhead view of its predecessor during battle, while certain rooms also use an overhead view. The game begins with the player directly in control of the protagonist, with little to no introduction. To progress, one must speak with the king, who gives the player the bare essentials and a small amount of cash to train. After selecting which attributes to raise, the player must find his way out of the city and into the vast underground complex. Finding this exit is the first of many puzzles the player will encounter, though the game is not a puzzle game but a role-playing video game with puzzle game and adventure game elements. The protagonist can move left and right, climb down ladders, jump, cast equipped spells, enter doors, or use equipped items. Similar to Falcom's own later Ys series, damage is done by walking directly into the enemy, but unlike with Ys, in Xanadu it doesn't matter which part of the target's body the player character runs into. The main view in Xanadu is a side-scrolling platformer view, though it is more in line with Sorcerian than a typical platformer such as Super Mario Bros. When engaging in a battle or entering a building, the view is changed to a top-down perspective. Each \\"layer\\" or stratum has its own complex network of buildings, caves and tunnels. To acquire a level up, the player must visit temples, where a minister will grant a level up to the protagonist provided he or she has enough experience points. Otherwise, the minister will let the player know how much is needed to go up a level. There are two types of levels: fighting and magic. Fighting experience is raised through combat, and magic though spell use. The two systems go hand in hand and are used at the same time. Each enemy killed is either good or bad, even though all enemies will attack the player character. If the player kills too many good enemies, the Karma statistic will rise, at which point the temples will refuse to level up the player. This can be remedied by drinking a black poison bottle; however, these cannot be carried nor bought, and must be found within dungeons, and will remove half the protagonist's hit points. All equipable items, such as swords and armor, have their own experience levels. This is raised simply by using the item; for example, swords by attacking, armor by being hit, magic by casting the spell, and so on. In this sense, a highly developed dagger will be more effective than a brand new longsword. However, a highly developed sword will be far more useful than a maxed out dagger, so it is vital to upgrade equipment. Xanadu has a limited number of enemies in each area, to deter powerleveling. This requires the player to think ahead about how he handles the enemies, how to get the most experience out of them, and to keep Karma from getting too high. This is a factor that must be juggled with weapon experience; if the player defeats all enemies using a dagger, then upgrades to a sword and proceeds to fight the area's boss, the player will be at a disadvantage and should have either kept the highly developed dagger, or bought the sword early on so as to level it up with the finite number of encounters in the area. Every area generally has at least one boss, though it is not always required to fight them. Enemies will drop various items, but most commonly will drop money or food. Money is used for upgrading equipment and buying items. The protagonist slowly eats his supply of food as time passes in the game. This slowly heals hit points as well. If food runs out, hit points begin dropping at a rapid pace until more food is found or bought, or the protagonist dies. In addition to purchasing them, items can be found in chests and in dungeon areas, or by entering a secret code name at the character creation area at the outset. The game autosaves right before a boss fight and after leaving a building. The player can manually save, which costs 100 gold. The Sega Saturn remake did away with this by adding a Save command in the status menu. ==Movie== A Xanadu OVA was released in 1987 in conjunction with the MSX version of the game and a manga, titled Xanadu: The Legend of Dragon Slayer. The plot was expanded and altered, with the main character now having a name, Fieg (フィーグ), and several new cast members. The new plot elements included several science fiction themes. For example, Fieg is a 21st- century soldier from the near future who is dropped into Xanadu after a bloody ambush. A soundtrack to the movie was released on record, cassette, and compact disc shortly thereafter. The manga follows the plot of the movie, and was drawn by Tsuzuki Kazuhiko (都築和彦), who also did work on Falcom's Ys and Sorcerian titles. It was republished as a 17 part serial webcomic by Falcom for the release of Revival Xanadu on the Falcom website, with accompanying music and an English translation.A serial comic \\"Revival XANADU\\" index page on Falcom.co.jp ==Development== In its original PC-8801 release, Xanadu features music composed by Toshiya Takahashi. To promote the release of the game, Japanese heavy metal band Anthem released an LP with two image songs, titled \\"XANADU\\". The MSX versions of the game, which were released in 1987, have a different score. Xanadu Scenario II, an expansion pack, features a much larger set of songs. The soundtrack was composed by Takahito Abe and Yuzo Koshiro, who would compose the music for many of Falcom's later titles. Koshiro's compositions for the opening theme and several dungeons were taken from the demo tape he had first sent to Falcom at the age of 18. Revival Xanadu and Revival Xanadu II, two loose remakes made by Falcom in the 1990s, feature their own unique soundtracks as well, also composed by Koshiro and Abe. Aside from Xanadu Next and Legend of Xanadu, no Xanadu titles have received a full, independent original soundtrack on compact disc. However, a soundtrack was released for both Xanadu and Xanadu Scenario II on a 12\\" vinyl record album, titled Xanadu Anthem. Selections from Xanadus music can be heard in various Falcom albums, and in 1987 \\"All Over Xanadu\\" was released, featuring arranged versions of Xanadu and Scenario IIs soundtrack being played by a rock band combined with a live orchestra and synthesizers. The main theme of the Xanadu franchise, \\"La Valse Pour Xanadu\\", has been featured in the PC-88 and PC-98 versions of Xanadu and remixed into several audio tracks in Xanadu Next. == Reception == French magazine Joypad reviewed the PC-E version and gave it 97%. ==Release== Xanadu was a pioneer in the game industry, and received critical praise from Japanese gaming magazines and a large fan base. As of 2005, according to Falcom, its 1985 sales record of over 400,000 copies sold in Japan has yet to be broken by any role-playing personal computer game released in that country. However, Tokihiro Naito of T&E; Soft has said that the first Hydlide, an Action-RPG like Xanadu, sold one-million copies across all computer formats when combining the sales - matching the Famicom's sales of also one-million copies in Japan. Origin Systems founder and Ultima series creator Richard Garriott flew into Tokyo to have a meeting with Nihon Falcom about having Origin release Xanadu in the US, as well as having Falcom help with releasing a port of Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar in Japan. However, Xanadu contained artwork directly lifted from the manuals of the role-playing game Ultima III: Exodus. During the presentation of the game, several digitized pictures from the manual of Ultima III appeared in various shops in the game. Upon seeing this, Garriott and Origin ended the meeting and decided to sue Falcom; the lawsuit was settled out of court and the artwork in the game was changed to what appears now.The Official Book of Ultima, Second Edition, page 77. By Shay Addams Xanadu Scenario II, released in 1986, was an early example of an expansion pack. It was also non-linear, allowing the levels to be explored in any order. Xanadu is the only title Falcom has given a complete commemorative re-release in its original 1980s packaging. Though they had various degrees of success with older titles, Xanadu was Falcom's breakthrough that brought them into the spotlight. Xanadu has a large set of followups, despite it being technically a sequel itself to Dragon Slayer. *Xanadu Scenario II: An expansion pack, Scenario II was released in 1986 and required the player to still have the original Xanadu disk. After creating a new custom Xanadu Scenario II disk, the player needs to insert the original Xanadu disk, create a character as done in the original Xanadu, and then insert the Scenario II disk when prompted. The expansion pack features a new soundtrack, a complex shopping/trading system, more maps, and new encounters with bosses. The game is non-linear, allowing the eleven levels to be explored in any order. *Faxanadu: A Falcom-licensed, Hudson-produced side-scrolling platform-adventure for the Nintendo Entertainment System. One of the few early Falcom titles to be released in North America, its name is a combination of \\"Famicom\\" and \\"Xanadu\\". *Revival Xanadu: A PC-9801 remake produced by Falcom. Features a high-resolution graphical upgrade while still maintaining the feel of the original, with upgraded music as well. An \\"Easy Mode\\" was released in conjunction with Revival Xanadu II later. *Revival Xanadu II Remix: A PC-9801 semi-remake of Scenario II, though it has a completely different soundtrack and new maps. *Legend of Xanadu (風の伝説ザナドゥ, Kaze no Densetsu Xanadu): A spin- off of Xanadu, released in 1994 for the PC Engine CD. *Legend of Xanadu II (風の伝説ザナドゥII, Kaze no Densetsu Xanadu II): A sequel to Legend of Xanadu, released in 1995 for the PC Engine CD. *Falcom Classics: A Sega Saturn compilation, featuring remade versions of Ys, Dragon Slayer, and Xanadu along with emulated copies of the original versions. Many things were altered, including an easier-to-understand \\"Saturn Mode\\" and a graphic style very similar to Revival Xanadu with a larger color palette. *Revival Xanadu (Memorial Games): A port of Revival Xanadu to Windows 95/Windows 98 by developer Unbalance. The music was recorded as non-looping WAV files. The faster-tempo battle songs are sped up to a higher pitch instead of a swifter tempo. The graphics are overly saturated compared to the PC-9801 version. *Xanadu Complete Reprint Edition: A commemorative reprint of the 1985 original version, down to the soft plastic case and manual, aside from the game being on CD-ROM instead of diskette. Released for Windows CD-ROM using Project EGG's emulator system. == Legacy == The influence of Xanadu has been felt in many games developed by Falcom, and even other development houses which have copied the look and feel. Ys featured a similar but quicker and more complex \\"bump\\" system for combat used in Ys I, Ys II and Ys IV, while some of the later Dragon Slayer games Romancia, Dragon Slayer IV and Sorcerian all had similar side-scrolling viewpoints. However, this bump system did not start with Xanadu, but with its predecessor, the original Dragon Slayer. Several smaller companies copied the \\"bump\\" system, mostly in obscure PC-8801 titles. The game's influence also extended beyond action RPGs, with the way the game reworked the entire game system considered an influence on Final Fantasy, which would do the same for each of its installments, as its developer Square was previously the publisher for the MSX version of the original Dragon Slayer. Xanadu is also considered a \\"proto-Metroidvania\\" game, due to being an \\"RPG turned on its side\\" that allowed players to run, jump, collect, and explore, laying the foundations for the more open-ended \\"Metroidvania\\" games Faxanadu and Legacy of the Wizard. ==References External links == * * Category:Role-playing video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Dragon Slayer (series) Category:FM-7 games Category:MSX games Category:MSX2 games Category:NEC PC-8001 games Category:NEC PC-8801 games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:Sharp X1 games Category:Side-scrolling role-playing video games Category:1985 video games Category:Windows games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Metroidvania games Category:Japan- exclusive video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Yuzo Koshiro Category:Single-player video games Category:Nihon Falcom games ","title":"Xanadu (video game)"},{"id":"19234114","text":"Danny Jones is a 1972 British drama film directed by Jules Bricken and starring Frank Finlay, Jane Carr and Len Jones. ==Cast== * Frank Finlay as Mr. Jones * Jane Carr as Angie Dickson * Len Jones as Danny Jones * Jenny Hanley as Sue * Nigel Humphreys as Jim Harper * Marianne Stone as Woman in hotel * Raymond Young as Mr. Dickson * Andria Lawrence as Ice cream girl * Phillip Ross as Mr. Harper ==External links== * Category:1972 films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:1972 drama films Category:British drama films ","title":"Danny Jones (film)"},{"id":"19234121","text":"I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star) is the 24th album by American singer/guitarist Glen Campbell, released in 1973. ==Track listingSide one=== #\\"I Knew Jesus (Before He Was a Star)\\" (Neal Hefti, Seymore Styne) – 2:50 #\\"I Take It On Home\\" (Kenny O'Dell) – 3:11 #\\"Sold American\\" (Kinky Freidman) – 3:22 #\\"I Want to Be with You Always\\" (Lefty Frizzell) – 2:18 #\\"If Not for You\\" (Bob Dylan) – 2:46 ===Side two=== #\\"Give Me Back That Old Familiar Feeling\\" (Bill C.

Levin is devoted to the highly expressive and demanding repertoire of Beethoven, Schumann, Chopin, Brahms, Rachmaninoff, and Ravel, as well as to the work of leading modernists such as Anders Eliasson, David Del Tredici, Alexander Goretzky, Louis Karchin, and Scott Wheeler. ==Early influences== Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Levin's fascination with music developed from the age of 3, when she first began piano lessons. Levin says: \\"Some of my earliest memories are of playing as my father sang. We were fortunate to have a brilliant pianist living just around the corner: Cecille Sharlip, who had emigrated from Europe to study at the Curtis Institute of Music. Sharlip guided me until I was 12, at which time she suggested I audition for the great Chopin interpreter Marian Filar, who was then teaching at the Settlement Music School (Philadelphia). I absorbed a sense of musical tradition that has never left me.\\"MySpace profile Working with Filar, himself a former student of Walter Gieseking, led to Levin winning at the age of 12 an audition to perform with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Four years later, she again appeared with that orchestra. ==Musical education== At the age of 17, Levin successfully auditioned for Serkin, then a professor of piano and director of the Curtis Institute. Levin said: “Mr. Serkin was an inspiration the moment he walked into a room, a single word evoking the eloquence of a poem.” Other teachers at Curtis included chamber musicians Arnold Steinhardt and David Soyer, first violinist and cellist, respectively, of the Guarneri Quartet. Levin completed her academic work as a Boston University student of Leonard Shure, who was in turn a student and teaching assistant of the great Beethoven interpreter Artur Schnabel. \\"I recall Shure asking me at the audition why I made music. 'Because I love it,' I said simply. He suggested we start lessons that very day.\\" ==Performing career== As a freshly minted performer, Levin undertook years of travel, both within the United States and abroad. Branching out into as many performing roles as possible, she appeared as a soloist, chamber music participant, and concerto soloist. As an artist in the “Music From Marlboro” program (an offshoot of the Marlboro Music School and Festival and the Curtis Institute), Levin worked with pianist Paul Badura-Skoda, violinist Sandor Vegh, founder of the renowned Vegh Quartet, and bassist Julius Levine,. She appeared in other chamber music venues, accompanying Raphael Hillyer of the Juilliard Quartet and flutist Paula Robison. Still in her early 20s, Levin appeared as piano concerto performer with the Boston Symphony Orchestra led by Arthur Fiedler, the Seattle Symphony led by American musician and conductor Milton Katims, and the Boston Philharmonic led by Benjamin Zander. European travel led Levin to Spain, Iceland, Serbia, and Turkey. In Iceland, where she continues to appear yearly as soloist, she founded and played for 10 years with Trio Borealis as well as with members of the Iceland Symphony Orchestra. She traveled throughout Spain as a member of the trio. She gave master classes in Serbia and Turkey under the aegis of the U.S. State Department. ==New York== Establishing herself in New York, Levin studied with pre-eminent piano mentor Dorothy Taubman. Levin gave recitals at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Steinway Hall, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She worked with members of the New York Philharmonic and recorded with other Marlboro musicians for Columbia Masterworks Records. Concerts throughout the U.S. featured work with such chamber ensembles as the Audubon Quartet and the Vermeer Quartet. Levin is one of five musicians who comprise Vista Lirica, a chamber group devoted to the cause of environmentalism and the music of the Romantics. As part of her continued commitment to contemporary composers, Levin collaborated with Del Tredici to perform his “Ballad in Yellow.” Levin has appeared in broadcast interviews and performances on radio stations WNYC, WNYE, and WQXR in New York, WFMT in Chicago, and WGBH in Boston. She conducted American master classes at such institutions as New York University and The College of William & Mary. ==Recent recordings== Among Levin's recordings are A Single Breath: Beethoven's Last Three Piano Sonatas (Navona Records, 2013), Beethoven's Diabelli Variations (Centaur Records, 2011) and Bach's Goldberg Variations (Centaur Records, 2008). \\"Revelatory\\", commented Richard Brody in The New Yorker on Levin's approach to the Beethoven sonatas, adding that the pianist had \\"conveyed the sense of being in the vicariously conjured presence of Beethoven himself.\\"New Yorker review Jeremy Eichler, in a review in The New York Times on June 10, 2005, described Levin's pianism thus: \\"Ms. Levin [keeps] the ear engaged with boldly inflected readings and an impressive ability to convey emotion without exhibition.\\" ==ReferencesAdditional sources=== * Taubman technique polishes Levin to perfection - The Boston Globe (Boston, MA)  HighBeam Research * Beth Levin adds new colors to her palette - The Boston Globe (Boston, MA)  HighBeam Research ==External links== * * Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:American classical pianists Category:American women classical pianists Category:20th-century American pianists Category:20th-century American women musicians Category:21st-century classical pianists Category:21st-century American women musicians Category:21st-century American pianists ","title":"Beth Levin (musician)"},{"id":"19234160","text":"Pātālekhet (Newar: पातालेखेत; Nepali: पात्लेखेत, Pātlekhet) is a village development committee in Kavrepalanchok District in the Bagmati Zone of central Nepal.

The primary chain ran in a shallow oil-bath but if the level dropped, the chain could suffer lubrication failure and stretch. The chain was not tensioned - and even worse, the primary chain case on early models was a slightly 'waisted' shape. A worn chain could strike both the inside of the cover and the crankcase itself, making the oil-level even more difficult to maintain in the future. Another common complaint was that the Cub would travel at highway speed (50 mph) for 1/2 hour and then stop unexpectedly. Some attributed this to overheating, but a cure was never found. ==Legislative boost== In 1961, the driving licence law for Triumph's home market in Great Britain was changed, restricting learner motorcyclists to a maximum of 250cc.

The blasts killed 103 Israelis and 46–59 Lebanese, wounding 95 people and were some of the worst losses ever for the IDF. Israel believes both to be the responsibility of Hezbollah. ==First bombing== After invading Lebanon in June, the Israeli military set up command posts to run the cities they occupied. On November 11, 1982, a Peugeot car packed with explosives struck the seven-story building being used by the Israeli military to govern Tyre. The explosion leveled the building and killed 75 Israeli soldiers, border policemen, and Shin Bet agents. In addition, anywhere from 14–27 Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners that were being held by Israel were killed. Twenty-seven Israelis and 28 Arabs were injured. The Israeli government said soon after the blast, and insists to this day, that the explosion was an accident resulting from gas cylinders exploding.Bergman, 64. This is contrary to the three witnesses who saw the Peugeot speed to the building, the identification of the car's parts in the rubble of the building, and the existence of a Shin Bet report detailing the Hezbollah preparations for the bombing.Bergman, 65. There is a monument near Baalbek, Lebanon, dedicated to 17-year-old Ahmad Qassir, the suicide bomber responsible for the attack.Hirst, David (2010) 'Beware of Small States. Lebanon, Battleground of the Middle East. Faber and Faber. . Page 196. ==Second bombing== Almost a year later, a nearly identical bombing happened in Tyre. On November 4, 1983, a suicide bomber drove a pickup truck filled with explosives into a Shin Bet building at an army base in Tyre. The explosion killed 28 Israelis and 32 Lebanese prisoners, and wounded about 40 others. ==See also== *1983 Beirut barracks bombing *1983 United States embassy bombing ==References * When in Rome, don't forget the bombs of 1983 - Article on Ahmed Qassir * Sacrifice and \\"Self-Martyrdom\\" in Shi'ite Lebanon * Suicide Superpower: Martyrdom as a Weapon of Mass Destruction Category:1982 crimes in Lebanon Category:1982 in international relations Category:1982 murders in Asia Category:1983 crimes in Lebanon Category:1983 in international relations Category:1983 murders in Asia Category:1980s murders in Lebanon Category:20th-century mass murder in Lebanon Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in 1982 Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in 1983 Category:Attacks on military installations Category:Building bombings in Lebanon Category:Hezbollah Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in 1982 Category:Israel Defense Forces disasters Category:Israeli–Lebanese conflict Category:Mass murder in 1982 Category:Mass murder in 1983 Category:Massacres in Lebanon Category:November 1982 crimes Category:November 1982 events in Asia Category:November 1983 crimes Category:November 1983 events in Asia Category:Suicide bombings in 1983 Category:Suicide car and truck bombings in Lebanon Category:Terrorist incidents in Asia in 1982 Category:Terrorist incidents in Asia in 1983 Category:Terrorist incidents in Lebanon in the 1980s Headquarters bombings ","title":"Tyre headquarters bombings"},{"id":"19234209","text":"Tapanilan Erä is a Finnish sports club that was founded in 1933, with various teams in different disciplines.

He underwent his coming-of-age ceremony in 1878 and was married the same year. In March 1879, his father Shō Tai formally abdicated upon the orders of the Meiji government, which abolished the kingdom, transforming Ryukyu domain into Okinawa Prefecture, with officials appointed from Tokyo to administer the islands.Kerr. p381. The former king was ordered to report to Tokyo, but feigning illness, he temporarily found shelter at his son's palace. Shō was then sent to Tokyo as a hostage and partial appeasement as Ryūkyūan officials searched for ways to delay the former king's departure. Following his father's death and his succession as Marquess and head of the Shō family in 1901, Shō and his family gave up the trappings of traditional Ryukyuan royal court life, costume, court language, and ritual, and adopted those of the Japanese peerage. As Marquess, Shō held a hereditary seat in the House of Peers in the Imperial Diet.

His move from Kettering Town to Rushden & Diamonds for £85,000 was at the time a record transfer fee between non-League clubs. While hugely disappointing at Rushden he moved on to Dover Athletic, Stevenage Borough, Doncaster Rovers, Kettering Town and Yeovil Town where he won the FA Trophy in 2002. After being released he journeyed to many clubs including Nuneaton Borough, Gainsborough Trinity, Leigh RMI, Woodley Sports and ending his career at New Mills in 2007. ==Career== In 1988 at the age of 16, Carl made his debut as a substitute for Rochdale but failed to impress and was later released. After periods at both Burnley and Stockport County, plus a loan period at Morecambe, he made the decision to drop down to non-league football, joining Witton Albion where his knack for goal-scoring flourished. In the summer of 1993, he joined Macclesfield Town of the Conference for a fee of £1,700,the goals that he scored for Witton Albion are not shown in his Conference goals total. He then joined Kettering Town for £25,000 the following summer. After scoring 54 goals for Kettering Town in 18 months, Rushden & Diamonds offer of £85,000, a non-league record, was enough to persuade the Poppies to sell their prize asset and he arrived at Nene Park at the end of March 1996. He made his debut in against promotion rivals Halesowen Town on 30 March 1996, scoring Diamonds goal in the 1–2 defeat. He was dropped after just five games at the start of the 1997/98 season and was loaned to Dover Athletic in February 1998. He was recalled and sold to Stevenage Borough on a free transfer in April. Carl scored more than a goal a game at Stevenage, and was snapped up by Doncaster Rovers in May 2000 for £50,000. After a period on loan back at Kettering Town in January 2001, he joined Yeovil Town in the summer helping them to lift the FA Trophy in 2002. The following season, he left the Glovers in December 2002 and joined Nuneaton Borough. He went on to play for Gainsborough Trinity, Woodley Sports, Leigh RMI and Nuneaton Borough (again) and was last noted playing for North West Counties League side New Mills AFC in the 2006/07 season.

Appearing in the November 26, 1919 issue of The Mississippian, a literary magazine at the University of Mississippi, \\"Landing in Luck\\" tells the story of Cadet Thompson, who is sent on a solo flight without adequate instruction. Thompson lands successfully, and his flight instructor, Bessing, takes credit for the fine job he did of teaching the cadet pilot. It is a fictional exaggeration based on Faulkner's experience as a cadet-pilot for the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1918. The setting of the story is likely Leaside Aerodrome in Toronto, Ontario. While a student at the School of Military Aeronautics at the University of Toronto in 1918, Faulkner had many opportunities to observe the operations at this airfield. Opinion varies on the quality of \\"Landing in Luck:; biographer Stephen B. Oates calls it \\"amusing\\",Oates 1987, p.28. while another biographer labels the story \\"generic\\" and \\"without real depth\\".Parini 2004, p.51. ==Analysis== Interpretations of the story vary widely. Parini finds the story \\"about a young man's false sense of accomplishment\\" and ascribes Thompson's feelings to Faulkner's \\"inner doubt\\"; the author, according to Parini, must have had the \\"feeling that the world sees more in him than he actually possesses\\".Parini 2004, p. 51. Frederick R. Karl says the story \\"establishes Faulkner as a teller of tall tales, a vivid and significant part of his artistic imagination and a centerpiece of his ludic imagination\\".Karl 1989, p. 138. It also is significant because in it, Faulkner sheds the \\"artificial language\\" that mars much of what he wrote as a young man.Karl 1989, p. 139. The comic elements in the story foreshadow the humorous elements Faulkner often included in even his most serious fiction. The story also shows Faulkner's ability to spin the stuff of everyday life into an interesting tale. As a cadet-pilot, Faulkner probably never even flew a plane; his RAF unit was disbanded early in his training because World War I ended. ==References== *Karl, Frederick R.

As of 2011 census, Saping village has 786 households with 3246 individuals, 1,472 males and 1,774 females (CBS Nepal 2012), and under the \\"new\\" federal structure, formed by a new constitution, adopted on 20 September 2015, Saping is now a part of Bhumlu Gaupalika (in English: Bhumlu Rural Municipality) and is organized as Ward Number 1 (out of 10 small government units called 'wards', cf. in the pre-2015 era the village was called Saping Village Development Committee). As a mixed ethnic and linguistic community, Saping has several well known travel destinations, including holy sites like Mulkharka Bhimsenthan and Saping Siddhi Ganesh Temple - both of which can be reached using vehicles or on foot from Dolalghat town, as a part of a (day or two) trekking adventure. In terms of geography, Saping consists largely of a rough hill terrain, with a few patches of semi- flat land here and there; its height ranges from 633 meters at Dolalghat Sukhoshi river, 1366 meters at Saping Siddhi Ganesh Temple (Ramche), to 1805 meters at Mulkharka Bhimsenthan. Because of its rugged landscape and varied altitude, the climate system also varies in Saping, from subtropical jungle along the Sunkoshi river banks to temperate forest around Mulkharka Bhimsenthan. The main source of income in Saping is agriculture, but in the recent years, the vast majority of young people have migrated to the cities, and many to foreign countries, especially to Arab countries in the Middle East, and Malaysia. As such, the remittances sent through foreign labour has become the primary source of livelihood for virtually all families. This has led to a rapid decline in agriculture as economically active population has largely moved out of the village. Elders are worried that unless the local and central governments make concerted efforts to keep (i.e. attract back) young people in the village, it appears likely that the village might rapidly lose its population and thereby risking its importance. In Saping, the basic infrastructure such as road, electricity, water supply, etc. is still in a primitive state. There is a newly opened ruggy track from Silame Bhir (just above Sunkoshi river banks at Dolaghat ), which is gradually being upgraded, but as of 2020 it is not yet clear how far this road network will be developed and whether it will be linked to other long routes in the surrounding districts of Sindhupalchok, Dolakha, Ramechhap, etc. Electricity has reached the villagers and as of February 2020 wooden poles have been upgraded with metal ones, making it a bit better lasting in the years ahead. Especially after the devastating earthquakes of 2015, water supply has become one of the major concerns because many of the natural spring water sources have disappeared, but the villagers have been working on to bring piped water from far away sources. There is a small health post nearby Lakuri Danda, where also Saping's (i.e. ward number one's) government unit is located, which was built during the post-2015 earthquakes reconstruction. Furthermore, the village has two secondary schools, one at Lakuri Danda, and other at Ritthe where students can finish their high school (i.e. 12 years of education). So far there is no legal agency or security police presence in the village. In spite of being quite close to the Kathmandu valley, Saping remained largely backward. Only in the recent years, Sapingeli are becoming more hopeful because the first elected federal government (since 2018) has tried to allocate a sizable annual budget to develop rural governance and infrastructure. ==References * Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development * *UN map of the municipalities of Kavrepalanchowk District Category:Populated places in Kavrepalanchok District ","title":"Saping"},{"id":"19234527","text":"John Thomas Quekett John Thomas Quekett (11 August 1815 – 20 August 1861) was an English microscopist and histologist. Quekett studied medicine at the London Hospital in 1831. He became a licentiate of the Apothecaries' Company and a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1839, along with his brother Edwin John Quekett) co-founded the Royal Microscopical Society. Quekett served as the society's secretary from 1841 to 1860. In 1843 he was appointed assistant conservator of the Hunterian Museum, and in 1856 conservator of the museum and professor of histology on the retirement of professor Richard Owen. ==Biography== Quekett, born at Langport, Somerset, on 11 August 1815, was the youngest son of William Quekett and Mary, daughter of John Bartlett. The father was at Cockermouth grammar school with William and Christopher Wordsworth, and from 1790 till his death in 1842 was master of Langport grammar school. He educated his sons at home, and each of them was encouraged to collect specimens in some branch of natural history. The eldest brother, William Quekett, was a rector and author. When only sixteen John gave a course of lectures on microscopic subjects, illustrated by original diagrams and by a microscope which he had himself made out of a roasting-jack, a parasol, and a few pieces of brass purchased at a neighbouring marine-store shop. On leaving school he was apprenticed, first to a surgeon in Langport, and afterwards to his brother Edwin John Quekett, entering King's College, London, and the London Hospital medical school. In 1840 he qualified at Apothecaries' Hall, and at the Royal College of Surgeons won the three-years studentship in human and comparative anatomy, then first instituted. He formed a most extensive and valuable collection of microscopic preparations, injected by himself, illustrating the tissues of plants and animals in health and in disease, and showing the results and uses of microscopic investigation. In November 1843 he was appointed by the College of Surgeons assistant conservator of the Hunterian Museum, under Professor (afterwards Sir) Richard Owen, and in 1844 he was appointed demonstrator of minute anatomy. In 1846 his collection of two thousand five hundred preparations was purchased by the college, and he was directed to prepare a descriptive illustrated catalogue of the whole histological collection belonging to the college, of which they constituted the chief part. In 1852 the title of his demonstratorship was changed to that of professor of histology; and on Owen's obtaining permission to reside at Richmond, Quekett was appointed resident conservator, finally succeeding Owen as conservator in 1856. His health, however, soon failed, and he died at Pangbourne, Berkshire, whither he had gone for the benefit of his health, on 20 Aug. 1861. In 1841 Quekett succeeded Dr. Arthur Farre as secretary of the Microscopical Society, a post which he retained until 1860, when he was elected president, but was unable to attend any meetings during his year of office. He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1857, and of the Royal Society in 1860. In 1846 Quekett married Isabella Mary Anne (d. 1872), daughter of Robert Scott, Bengal Civil Service, by whom he had four children. There is a lithographic portrait of Quekett in Maguire's Ipswich series of 1849, and a coloured one by W. Lens Aldous. Upon Quekett's death, Joseph Henry Green, Thomas Wormald, George Gulliver and several other members of the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons strongly supported the college's granting of a pension to the widow; Wormald and James Moncrieff Arnott each contributed £100 in addition to the pension. == Works == Quekett's work as an histologist was remarkable for its originality and for its influence upon the anatomical studies of the medical profession in this country. His Practical Treatise on the Use of the Microscope (1848, 8vo) did much also to promote the study among medical men and amateurs, and among those who came to him for instruction was the prince consort. His work in this direction is commemorated by the Quekett Microscopical Club, which was established in 1865, under the presidency of Dr. Edwin Lankester. Quekett's chief publications were: * Practical Treatise on the Use of the Microscope, 1848, 8vo; 2nd edit. 1852; 3rd edit. 1855, which was also translated into German. * Descriptive and Illustrated Catalogue of the Histological Series … in the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, vol. i.

Twenty-two papers by him are also enumerated in the Royal Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers (v. 53–4), mostly contributed to the Microscopical Society's Transactions, and dealing with animal histology. One of the most important of these is that on the Intimate Structure of Bones in the four great Classes, Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, and Fishes, with Remarks on the Value of the Knowledge in determining minute Organic Remains, Microscopical Society's Transactions, vol. ii. 1846, pp. 46–58. ==NotesReferences== * *This article incorporates text from the International Cyclopedia of 1890, a publication now in the public domain. ==External links== * *The Quekett Microscopical Club Category:Microscopists Category:Histologists Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Leiden University alumni Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Fellows of the Royal Microscopical Society Category:1815 births Category:1861 deaths Category:Alumni of King's College London ","title":"John Thomas Quekett"},{"id":"19234539","text":"{ +USS Delaware (SSN-791) } USS Delaware (SSN-791) is a attack submarine built for the United States Navy.

Roughly the upper half of Northern California, the \\"upstate\\" designation encompasses primarily rural areas which contain 4.5% of California's population. Outside of public relations, this area is often referred to as far Northern California. ==Background== The northernmost counties of California have had longstanding concerns about under-representation in California's government. Partition and secessionist movements have occasionally arisen in the region; part of many proposals to split California into two or three states. A 1941 movement to combine the northernmost counties of California and southernmost counties of Oregon into the State of Jefferson fell apart after the December 7 attack on Pearl Harbor and the US entry into World War II. In the early 1990s, California State Assemblyman Stan Statham led an unsuccessful effort to split the northern counties into a new state. ==Marketing== The term \\"Upstate California\\" was coined by Robert Berry, a marketing development specialist hired by a group of the northernmost counties of California. The name \\"Upstate California\\" was intended to draw upon the popular recognition of Upstate New York as a distinct region. The Upstate California campaign did not want to partition California to create a separate state or geopolitical entity. Instead the group wanted to encourage business investment in California's sparsely populated northernmost counties which were felt to be too often ignored within the Northern California designation—the population centers of the San Francisco Bay Area and the Sacramento metropolitan area received the most attention.

It was a segment (or branch) of the much larger Indian trail network known as the Great Indian Warpath, which stretched from New York to Alabama. The GIW was referred to from this point north as the \\"Seneca Trail\\". Thus, in pioneer days, the segment known as the Shawnee Trail was often also referred to as the Seneca Trail. ==Route== The Shawnee Trail began on the South Branch Potomac River somewhere below what is now Moorefield, West Virginia and proceeded up that river to its confluence with the North Fork South Branch Potomac River. It continued up that Fork and up Seneca Creek (passing Seneca Rocks) and crossed the crests of the Allegheny Mountains (and in so doing, the upper tributaries of the Cheat River) above the mouth of Horse Camp Creek. This segment passed near the future sites of Harman and Bowden. The trail entered the Tygart River Valley near Elkins and proceeded up the Tygart past Beverly to Huttonsville.Callahan, James Morton (1923), The History of West Virginia, Old and New, Vol. I, pg. 66-79. ==Traffic== The Shawnee Trail was long used by the Algonquians (including the Shawnee), Tuscarora, and Seneca nations to transit this part of the Alleghenies for purposes of trade and war. The name \\"Shawnee Trail\\" was applied after Native Americans of that tribe followed the trail out of the region after burning Fort Seybert (1758) in Pendleton County, West Virginia. A local historian described the use of the Trail in white pioneer days, and later, as follows: > [The Shawnee Trail] was much used by early settlers and became important for > a century as the chief highway between the South Branch and Tygart's valley. > Over it, travelled hundreds of pack horses loaded with salt, iron, and other > merchandise, and many droves of cattle fattened for the eastern market. In > the Civil War it furnished an avenue of escape for a detachment of > Confederates cut off from General Garnett's army at the battle of Rich > mountain, five miles west of Beverly, in 1861, and it was used by Imboden > and Jones in driving eastward the horses and cattle captured in their great > raid of 1863.Callahan, Op. cit. ==ReferencesSee also== *Texas Road, a pioneering cattle trail originally called \\"Shawnee Trail\\" Category:Native American trails in the United States Category:History of the Thirteen Colonies Category:Allegheny Mountains Category:Historic trails and roads in West Virginia ","title":"Shawnee Trail (West Virginia)"},{"id":"19234661","text":"Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Beynon (14 March 1894 – 21 May 1969)Ben Beynon player profile ESPN Scrum.com was a Welsh international rugby union fly-halfWelsh Rugby Union player profiles who played club rugby for Swansea, and would later play professional rugby league for Oldham RLFC. Beynon was also an association footballer for Swansea Town. ==Rugby career== Beynon played rugby union for his home team club, Swansea, playing his first game in 1913. He was first selected to represent Wales on 17 January 1920, when he faced England at St. Helens. Wales ran out comprehensive winners, mainly thanks to Newport's Jerry Shea scoring 16 points on his own. His second and last match was against Scotland three weeks later. It was unknown if Beynon would have won more caps, as he became a professional footballer for Swansea Town in the same year, which prevented him from playing rugby union. The Welsh Rugby Union even withheld his actual cap to commemorate his appearance as they believed he was professional before he represented Wales at union. Beynon was the first Swansea player to turn out for a rugby union, league (Oldham) and association football teams. ===International rugby matches played=== WalesSmith (1980), pg 463. * 1920 * 1920 ==Association Football career== Beynon played association football for Waunwen and then Swansea Town, playing his first game for the 'Swans' on 28 November 1914.

Swansea won a shock 1-0 victory, Beynon scoring the goal, his only score in four FA Cup appearances.Jenkins (1980), pg 20.

Chart of the Urssaf (the French social welfare collection agencies) incomes and exemptions for the 1998-2007 period, based on Urssaf- Acoss statistics published in Acoss Stat n°78.http://www.acoss.urssaf.fr/index.php?option=com_docman&task;=docclick&Itemid;=5529&bid;=1386&limitstart;=0&limit;=5 They also manage two other salary deductions for the French Ministry of Public Action and Accounts: * the Generalized Social Contribution (Contribution sociale généralisée, or CSG); * the Social debt repayment contribution (Contribution au remboursement de la dette sociale, or CRDS: a contribution for the repayment of the French social security deficit). URSSAF employees are not, as commonly assumed, civil servants, and thus they are covered by the same employment agreements as other social security employees. Each organization is a private entity responsible for a particular public service and is headed by a Director. Each of them (including the national fund) is controlled by an Administrative Council made up in equal parts of managers and workers. The decisions made by the Administrative Council are monitored by the State, represented by DRASS (Directions régionales des affaires sanitaires et sociales, or the regional director for health and social matters). URSSAF organizations are spread across France to form a network totaling more than one hundred members (101 as of January 1, 2006), with at least one organization per department. The organizations are deemed to be infallible, and without any reference to court and in disregard of any banking conventions, they can take money out of a person's bank account if they believe they are owed it. There are no appeals procedures. URSSAF is supervised primarily by the Ministry for Social Security and secondarily by the Ministry for the Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Service. Since May 18, 2007, management of the URSSAF network has been supervised by Xavier Bertrand, the Minister of Labor, Social Affairs and Solidarity, while Eric Woerth, minister for the Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Service, is the acting supervisor for the collection of contributions and other taxes. The objectives of ACOSS (, or the central agency for social security organizations) have been recorded in three successive COGs (conventions d'objectifs et de gestion, or agreements on objectives and management), the first covering the period 1998-2001, the second 2002-2005, and the current version covering 2006-2009. ACOSS has had to work within the framework of this third COG to lay off 600 employees out of a workforce of 14,500 between now and 2009. In DOMs (départements d'outre-mer, or overseas departments), URSSAF organizations do not exist as such, so social security contributions are collected by the CGSS (Caisses générales de sécurité sociale, or general social security funds). ACOSS is the national fund for the entire group of organizations (as decreed by the law of July 25, 1994), including the CNAM-TS for health insurance, the CNAF for family benefits and the CNAV for retirement. ACOSS manages the social security budget. == Sources == * The 2002-2006 COG signed on May 31, 2006, by the Minister of Social Affairs, which expresses the objectives assigned to contribution collections and the need for 600 layoffs. * Press release on the 2006-2009 COG ==References External links== * Category:Government of France ","title":"URSSAF"},{"id":"19234812","text":"Thaukhal is a village development committee in Kabhrepalanchok District in the Bagmati Zone of central Nepal.

The prison was operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service until it closed in January 2016 for refurbishment work. As of 2018 the prison still remains closed, but the Ministry of Justice have stated the prison is still available to use and may have a future as a training facility. http://www.kentonline.co.uk/weald/news/troubled-prison-could-reopen-as-100658/ ==History== Originally a country house, the Prison Service converted the building into a Young Offenders Institution in 1954. The prison was then re- classified as an adult prison in 1991. Blantyre House courted controversy in 1996 after an ex-inmate accused the prison regime of corruption.HighBeam This followed an incident that resulted in the death of a woman when two prisoners caused a multiple-vehicle traffic accident during a 100 mph chase while out on day release.https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-61333140 In 2000 a large raid (named Operation Swinford) at Blantyre House caused controversy amongst the press and politicians. Prison authorities claimed the raid was needed to expose potential deep-rooted corruption at the prison. The Prison Service claimed that investigations stretched back to the original allegations in 1996, and involved Kenneth Noye allegedly placing a prisoner at Blantyre House as part of a fraud plot. The following year Blantyre House was singled out as having the best community relations of any prison in the UK along with one of the lowest re-offending rates. The management at Blantyre House was amalgamated with HMP East Sutton Park in 2007. In the same year the Home Office announced plans to expand the prison by building a new block which could double capacity at Blantyre House when built. ==The prison today== Prisoners tend to have already served three years or more in other prisons and are transferred to Blantyre House to complete the last part (maximum three years) of their sentence. Because of this the prison's main focus is the re- integration and re-settlement of prisoners into the community and preparation for life after prison. Education is compulsory for the first six months of the inmate's stay at the prison, and prisoners who wish to continue their education are allowed attending external colleges to study as part of their resettlement plan. Prisoners are also able to find full-time paid work outside of the prison 12 months before their release. The prison closed in January 2016. There are no confirmed plans regarding what to do with the buildings http://www.courier.co.uk/prison-shut-year-plan- revamp/story-27991182-detail/story.html Suggestions have been made about the site opening again as a training facility. ==Notable former inmates== * Satpal Ram, convicted murderer whose case caused controversy after allegations racism by the courts and prison service.

Led by Africans, it convenes dialogues, catalyzes ideas, and provides grants and technical assistance to organizations working to advance these goals. Its programs currently focus on three issues:http://www.trustafrica.org/ • Democracy and Civil Society — securing the conditions for democracy by strengthening the capacity of civil society organizations. • Equitable Development — fostering African enterprise and extending the benefits of economic growth to all members of society. • African Philanthropy — leveraging new and traditional forms of African giving to advance democracy and development and to minimize reliance on external donors. Now based in Dakar, Senegal, TrustAfrica began in 2001 as an initiative of the Ford Foundation to amplify African voices within the international donor community. TrustAfrica became an independent organization, governed by Africans, in 2006. It is committed to generating new philanthropic resources—and cultivating a greater degree of African ownership—by raising money from individuals and corporations in Africa and throughout the African diaspora. Acting as a catalyst and convener, TrustAfrica brings together civic leaders from across the continent for thoughtful workshops aimed at setting agendas and crafting solutions to Africa's democratic and developmental challenges. As a grant maker, it then solicits proposals to test new ideas and strategies that emerge from these discussions. In particular, TrustAfrica supports initiatives designed to strengthen the capacity of civil society organizations to secure democracy; foster sustainable and equitable development; and leverage African philanthropic support for democratization.

An exceptionally clean design, the KhAI-1 was the first European passenger transport aircraft to feature retractable undercarriage, and boasted a top speed better than the fighter aircraft in service at the time. Some 40 KhAI-1s were operated by Aeroflot, but while a dedicated military version, the KhAI-1VV was developed and flown in prototype form, this did not enter production. ==Development== The project was the brainchild of Iosif Grigorievich Nyeman, then head of aircraft construction at the newly formed Kharkiv Aviation Institute. Deciding to provide students with practical, hands-on experience, he divided the students into two teams, each assigned to designing an airliner making use of cheap, easily obtained materials. One team, led by L. D. Arson, was to work on a design incorporating modern techniques and design features designated KhAI-1, while the other, led by A. Eremenko, was to work on a more conservative design designated KhAI-2.This designation was later re-used for an unrelated jet fighter design The challenge was laid down in May 1931, and the timeframe specified was that the better design would need to be completed and ready for construction by February the following year. The whole venture was to be supervised by the Ukrainian branch of OSOAVIAKhIM. Soon, Nyeman selected the KhAI-1 as the design to proceed with. This was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with a streamlined fuselage of oval cross-section, and retractable undercarriage. Construction was to be wood throughout, with fabric-covered control surfaces. The students were re-organised into ten teams of five to seven members each, and set to work on the detailed design of the aircraft's components and structures. The plans were completed on time, and in March 1932 work began at the Kharkiv Aviation Factory, then home to the design bureau of Nyeman's old mentor, Konstantin Alekseevich Kalinin. Construction of the prototype was undertaken by the students themselves, under the supervision of factory personnel, and was complete within 180 days. The aircraft first flew on 8 October at the hands of Boris Kudrin, with Nyeman on board as a passenger. The aircraft's high speed and good handling quickly became apparent, and following factory trials, the prototype KhAI-1 was flown to Moscow on 17 February 1933 for state acceptance trials, making the flight from Kharkiv in record time. These tests were completed by June, with test pilots I.F.Petrov and P.I.Stefanovskii confirming the aircraft's excellent performance, and recommending it for Aeroflot service, offering as it did a 50% increase in speed over the standard Kalinin K-5 airliner of the day. Nyeman was awarded the Order of the Red Star for the project. With the KhAI-1 ordered into series production, Nyeman initially requested that this be undertaken at the Kharkiv Aviation Factory, but this facility was gearing up to produce the Kalinin K-7 bomber and therefore lacked the capacity. Instead, production was assigned to the Gorky Aviation Plant (Zavod 21) which was concluding Polikarpov I-5 production. Production examples differed from the prototype in having a larger rudder, enlarged baggage compartment, revised undercarriage with oleo struts, and lighter wheel brakes, The passenger cabin was also revised, with additional sound-proofing and ventilation, and the addition of a lavatory. A revision of the general structure produced a weight saving of 125 kg (275 lb) and an increase in top speed from 292 km/h to 319 km/h (182 mph to 199 mph). However, only three aircraft were built here before the facility was needed to build the Polikarpov I-16 and KhAI-1 production was shifted to Zavod 43 in Kiev, where the rest of the aircraft were built. The first of these flew in November 1934, and airline service trials commenced the following April. The Soviet Air Force soon expressed interest in the design as an alternative to the Polikarpov R-Z then replacing the Polikarpov R-5 in the reconnaissance- bomber role. A single prototype was built of a KhAI-1VV (for Военный Вариант - Voennii Variant - \\"Military Variant\\"), armed with a rear-mounted machine gun, and bombs carried in internal racks. While performance was impressive, the bomb-release mechanism proved troublesome, and as development dragged on, the Air Force gradually lost interest. ==Operational history== Following service trials between Moscow and Kyiv, the KhAI-1 was introduced on a regular Aeroflot service in early 1936 between Moscow and Sevastopol. Two accidents occurred during early service. In one, an outer wing panel broke soon after take-off, and in another, an undercarriage strut collapsed on landing. These events led to a review of the design by OKO, leading to general strengthening that added so much weight to the aircraft that one passenger seat had to be sacrificed. Production in Kiev had been suspended during this review, but was soon recommenced. Aeroflot continued using the type on passenger and mail routes until 1940 between Moscow and Kharkiv, Moscow and Minvody, and between Rostov and Krasnodar. ==Variants== * KhAI-1 - Passenger transport * KhAI-1B - (a.k.a.

The district was based in Perth's northern suburbs and was a safe Labor seat. ==History== At the 1972 redistribution prior to the 1974 state election, the seat of Balcatta, held narrowly by Labor's Brian Burke after a 1973 by- election, was renamed Balga, and Burke won it with an increased majority. The name Balga would last only one term; the seat was renamed back to Balcatta ahead of the 1977 state election. A new seat of Balga which was significantly safer for Labor was created for the 1983 state election east of the original seat. It included Alexander Heights, Balga, Girrawheen, Koondoola, Ballajura (at that stage only the section north of Marangaroo Drive had been built) and the eastern section of Hamersley. The seat's member was again Burke, who at that election also became Western Australian Premier. Burke resigned on 25 February 1988, both as Premier and a member of parliament, on the fifth anniversary of his swearing in as Premier. He was succeeded at a by-election by fellow Labor candidate Ted Cunningham.

Established in 1921, it was known as Wisconsin Home for Women until 1975. The facility houses maximum-security and medium-security adult females, with an average population of 936 as of May 2019. ==History== Before the Wisconsin Industrial Home was opened in 1921, female inmates were held in the Wisconsin State Prison in Waupun (now known as Waupun Correctional Institution). After it opened, women who committed \\"crimes against morality\\" were transferred to the Wisconsin Industrial Home, while women who had committed more serious crimes or were repeat offenders remained at Waupun. In 1931, construction began on a new facility, the Wisconsin Prison for Women, adjoining the Wisconsin Industrial Home. All women were transferred to this new facility. In 1945 Wisconsin Industrial Home and Wisconsin Prison for Women were combined and given the name Wisconsin Home for Women. The prison received its current name, Taycheedah Correctional Institution, in 1975 by order of the legislature. ===Work=== Inmates at the Wisconsin Prison for Women typically did laundry, sewing, gardening, kitchen and farm work. Beginning in 1943, they put their sewing skills to work by making dresses for the Russian War Relief. In 1952, the farm program was discontinued. During the 1980s, inmates worked taking phone calls for the Department of Transportation and the Lottery Board. The year 1997 marked the beginning of the Computer Recycling program, which involved the rebuilding, selling, or donation of used computers. This program is still in existence and is run at six different sites, employing nearly 100 inmates. ===Today=== In 1995, a new housing unit opened, doubling inmate capacity. Two years later, a barracks unit for 150 inmates was added. By 2002, two more buildings had been opened. The first contained a mental health unit with 64 beds and a segregation unit with 68 beds. The second, a general population facility, and had the largest capacity, with 240 beds. The Taycheedah Correctional Institution became part of the Wisconsin Women’s Correctional System in August 2005, putting Warden Boatwright in control of all female institutions and centers. == Programs == Taycheedah provides its inmates with several social services, including anger management training, Alcoholics/Narcotics Anonymous, and a pre-release program. The pre-release program helps inmates produce résumés, develop interviewing skills, and learn to use community resources before they are released from the institution. Taycheedah provides inmates with religious services and programs. Worship services are held regularly, with average monthly attendance in 2006-2007 at 998. Twenty study groups and programs supplement worship services. More than 500 inmates participated in these programs during 2006-2007. As of June 30, 2007, 80% of the inmate population was Protestant, 15% Catholic, 5% Native American, 4% Wiccan, 4% Islamic, 1% Buddhist, and less than 1% were other or had no preference. The racial breakdown of the population as of June 2007 was White 57%, Black 38%, American Indian 4.5%, and Asian 0.5%. Taycheedah offers adult education, special education, and English as a second language classes to inmates. Inmates can also earn certificates from the nearby Moraine Park Technical College in one of three programs. Credits can be transferred to the Wisconsin Technical College System for continuing education. The prison also offers vocational training. Some of these include; dental laboratory technician, construction, office software, and cosmetology. Inmates are provided jobs within the prison, such as kitchen duties, maintenance around the facility, recycling, and laundry. ==Controversy== In 2005 Angela Enoch, an 18-year-old inmate at Taycheedah, killed herself by using pieces of her pillow to strangle herself, after several days of pleading for psychiatric attention. After death, Enoch’s family filed a lawsuit against the correctional institution. In August 2008, the state settled the lawsuit, paying $635,000 to her family. In the settlement, the state did not assume liability for Enoch’s death.\\"State settles prison suicide case\\" Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, August 19, 2008. ==Notable Inmates== *Diane Borchardt - a teacher who hired students to kill her husband *Lawrencia Bembenek - Milwaukee police officer convicted of murder.

Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978), is a United States Supreme Court case dealing with defendants' rights to challenge evidence collected on the basis of a warrant granted on the basis of a false statement. The court held that where a warrant affidavit contains a statement, necessary to the finding of probable cause, that is demonstrated to be both false and included by an affiant knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, the warrant is not valid. ==Facts== On Friday, March 5, 1976, Mrs. Cynthia Bailey told police in Dover, Delaware, that she had been confronted in her home earlier that morning by a man with a knife, and that he had sexually assaulted her. She described her assailant's age, race, height, build, and facial hair, and gave a detailed description of his clothing as consisting of a white thermal undershirt, black pants with a silver or gold buckle, a brown leather three-quarter-length coat, and a dark knit cap that he wore pulled down around his eyes. That same day, petitioner Jerome Franks coincidentally was taken into custody for an assault involving a 15-year-old girl, Brenda, six days earlier. After his formal arrest, and while awaiting a bail hearing in Family Court, petitioner allegedly stated to Robert McClements, the youth officer accompanying him, that he was surprised the bail hearing was \\"about Brenda B. I know her. I thought you said Bailey. I don't know her.\\" Detective Brooks and Detective Larry D. Gray then submitted a sworn affidavit to a Justice of the Peace in Dover, in support of a warrant to search petitioner's apartment. In paragraph 8 of the affidavit's \\"probable cause page,\\" mention was made of petitioner's statement to McClements. In paragraph 10, it was noted that the description of the assailant given to the police by Mrs. Bailey included the above-mentioned clothing. Finally, the affidavit also described the attempt made by police to confirm that petitioner's typical outfit matched that of the assailant. Paragraph 15 recited: \\"On Tuesday, 3/9/76, your affiant contacted Mr. James Williams and Mr. Wesley Lucas of the Delaware Youth Center where Jerome Franks is employed and did have personal conversation with both these people.\\". Paragraphs 16 and 17 respectively stated: \\"Mr. James Williams revealed to your affiant that the normal dress of Jerome Franks does consist of a white knit thermal undershirt and a brown leather jacket,\\" and \\"Mr. Wesley Lucas revealed to your affiant that in addition to the thermal undershirt and jacket, Jerome Franks often wears a dark green knit hat.\\" A warrant was then issued on the basis of this affidavit. Pursuant to the warrant, police searched Frank's apartment and found a white thermal undershirt, a knit hat, dark pants, and a leather jacket, and, on petitioner's kitchen table, a single-blade knife. All these ultimately were introduced in evidence at trial. Prior to the trial, however, Frank's counsel filed a written motion to suppress the clothing and the knife found in the search; this motion alleged that the warrant, on its face, did not show probable cause, and that the search and seizure were in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, defense counsel orally amended the challenge to include an attack on the veracity of the warrant affidavit; he also specifically requested the right to call as witnesses Detective Brooks, Wesley Lucas of the Youth Center, and James D. Morrison, formerly of the Youth Center.Counsel asserted that Lucas and Morrison would testify that neither had been personally interviewed by the warrant affiants, and that, although they might have talked to another police officer, any information given by them to that officer was \\"somewhat different\\" from what was recited in the affidavit. Defense counsel charged that the misstatements were included in the affidavit not inadvertently, but in \\"bad faith.\\" Counsel also sought permission to call Officer McClements and petitioner as witnesses, to seek to establish that petitioner's courthouse statement to police had been obtained in violation of petitioner's Miranda rights, and that the search warrant was thereby tainted as the fruit of an illegally obtained confession. Id. at 17, 27. In rebuttal, the State's attorney argued in detail, App. 124, (a) that Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, §§ 2306, 2307 (1974), contemplated that any challenge to a search warrant was to be limited to questions of sufficiency based on the face of the affidavit; (b) that, purportedly, a majority of the States whose practice was not dictated by statute observed such a rule; and (c) that federal cases on the issue were to be distinguished because of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41(e). He also noted that the Supreme Court of the United States had reserved the general issue of subfacial challenge to veracity in Rendorf v. United States, when it disposed of that case on the ground that, even if a veracity challenge were permitted, the alleged factual inaccuracies in that case's affidavit \\"were of only peripheral relevancy to the showing of probable cause, and, not being within the personal knowledge of the affiant, did not go to the integrity of the affidavit.\\". The State objected to petitioner's \\"going behind [the warrant affidavit] in any way,\\" and argued that the court must decide petitioner's motion \\"on the four corners\\" of the affidavit. The trial court sustained the State's objection to petitioner's proposed evidence. The motion to suppress was denied, and the clothing and knife were admitted as evidence at the ensuing trial. Tr.192–196. Petitioner was convicted. In a written motion for judgment of acquittal and/or new trial, Franks repeated his objection to the admission of the evidence, stating that he \\"should have been allowed to impeach the Affidavit used in the Search Warrant to show purposeful misrepresentation of information contained therein.\\", and affirmed Franks' conviction. The motion was denied, and Franks was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 25 years each and an additional consecutive life sentence. On appeal, the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed, but its decision was reviewed and reversed by the Supreme Court in the here entitled case. After remanding the case back to the Delaware Supreme Court, the latter then reevaluated the legitimacy of the warrant and considered the ramifications of the false statements contained therein. It concluded that, \\"[e]xcised of the alleged false paragraphs[,] the warrant affidavit contains sufficient uncontested allegations to establish probable cause\\", and therefore affirmed Franks' conviction. As of 2018, Franks is still serving his sentence at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.http://www.doc.delaware.gov/views/inmate_locator.blade.shtml ==Opinion== The Supreme Court of the United States held that \\"Where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment, as incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that a hearing be held at the defendant's request. The trial court here therefore erred in refusing to examine the adequacy of petitioner's proffer of misrepresentation in the warrant affidavit.\\" ==See also== *Exclusionary rule *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 438 ==References * Category:United States Fourth Amendment case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court Category:1978 in United States case law Category:Dover, Delaware ","title":"Franks v.

He was born in the Polish town of Kraśnik. His parents moved to France shortly after his birth due to increasing anti-semitism and a worsening economic climate, eventually settling in Paris.http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/idcard.php?lang=en&ModuleId;=10006471 In 1939, the year Germany invaded Poland and war was declared, Wajsbrot gained his school leaving certificate and began training to be a mechanic. Following the Nazi occupation of Paris, Wajsbrot's parents were arrested in the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup (Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv) on 16 July 1942 and deported. Wajsbrot joined the Communist resistance group Francs-tireurs et partisans - Main-d'œuvre immigrée (FTP-MOI) shortly afterwards and proved to be a key participant in the violent actions they brought against the occupiers.Jewish Currents, Vol. 56, no. 1 (Jan./Feb. 2002) Six days after his eighteenth birthday, Wajsbrot threw a grenade into a train carriage reserved for German soldiers, causing \\"undescribable damage\\" according to an eye-witness. By mid-1943, the Germans had begun to close in on the FTP-MOI. Following the capture of one of the group's leaders and the subsequent information gained from his torture, the remaining the members of his cell (Wajsbrot among them) were captured in November 1943. Between his capture and subsequent trial in February of the following year, Wajsbrot was interrogated and tortured. After a one-day trial, he was condemned to death. On the afternoon of 21 February 1944, still just eighteen years old, Wajsbrot was executed at Mont Valérien, in a suburb of Paris. Wajsbrot's photograph was one of ten featuring on the Affiche Rouge, the iconic Nazi propaganda poster describing the FTP as an \\"army of crime\\". He is buried in the Parisian cemetery of Ivry under the words Mort pour la France. == References Bibliography== * Les Jeunes et la Résistance, dir.

The Warner Bros. built a major recording business in addition to their film business. ==History20th century=== 1930s and 1940s Buddy Collette During the 1930s and 1940s Los Angeles had a vibrant African-American musical community even when it was relatively small: a numund Central Avenue, and the community produced a number of great talents, including Charles Mingus, Buddy Collette, Gerald Wilson, but in the 1950s it disappeared.  1950s  In the 1950s Ritchie Valens was a rock and roll pioneer and a forefather of the Chicano rock movement, Valens' recording career lasted eight months, as it abruptly ended when he died in a plane crash.  1960s  The Byrds In the 1960s the Sunset Strip became a breeding ground for bands like The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, Spirit (band), Love (band) and The Doors. The Beach Boys were founded in nearby Hawthorne. 1970s Exene Cervenka, summer 1986 In the 1970s, bands such as Toto were some of the most 'heard' bands on radio; as most of the musicians in the band were well known session musicians. There was a sizable punk rock movement in the 1970s which spawned the hardcore punk movement featuring bands like X, Black Flag and Wasted Youth. Los Angeles' original late 1970s punk scene received less press attention than their counterparts in New York or London, but it included cult bands the Screamers, the Germs, the Weirdos, the Dils, the Bags, 45 Grave (founded by Paul B. Cutler), Nervous Gender, and X. There was also an East LA music scene that spawned bands like Los Lobos, War, The Plugz, and Los Illegals among many others. 1980s N.W.A. graffiti In the 1980s, the Paisley Underground movement was native to Los Angeles in rock music. In rap music, the seminal career of N.W.A. would later lead the development of G-Funk out of the combination of P-Funk and gangsta rap. Much internationally acclaimed hard rock has come out of Los Angeles since the 1980s, including hard rockers Van Halen from nearby Pasadena; Guns N' Roses whose critically acclaimed debut Appetite for Destruction is the best selling debut album in history; glam metal/hair metal bands like Mötley Crüe and Ratt; thrash metal acts like Metallica and Slayer. In the early '90s, many of the biggest alternative rock / alternative metal bands such as Tool, Jane's Addiction, Rage Against the Machine and Red Hot Chili Peppers hailed from the Los Angeles area. 1990s Red Hot Chili Peppers In the mid-1990s, Los Angeles' contribution to rock music continued with acclaimed artists such as Elliott Smith, Beck, Weezer and Sublime of Long Beach. At the end of the 1990s, the nu metal band Linkin Park was formed in Agoura, and was named after Lincoln Park in Santa Monica, near their recording studio. In addition, the gangsta rap and G-funk of the solo careers of Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg, among related acts, flourished in this decade and reestablished Los Angeles (particularly the communities of Long Beach and Compton) as a center of African-American musical development and G-funk as one of hip-hop's major living styles. In the late 1990s, indie rock artists such as Eels also rose to fame. ===After 2000=== In the new millennium, the city retains its importance as a center of live rock music, rap, and of the music industry. After 2000, LA based noise rock acts like Liars, Health and No Age became famous worldwide (mainly Europe and America) touring bands. The Game became one of the most prominent voices in modern hip-hop, rising to prominence internationally in part due to a feud with New York's famous rapper 50 Cent. The L.A. indie scene currently rides the wave through neighborhoods like Hollywood, Koreatown, Los Feliz, Silverlake, and Echo Park, which have given rise to such bands as Weaving the Fate, Moving Units, Rilo Kiley, Earlimart, Autolux, Scarling., Giant Drag, Best Coast, and Local Natives. The venue The Smell became a prominent spot after 2000 where many new avant garde indie rock acts like Abe Vigoda, Anavan, Ancestors, BARR, Foot Village, Carla Bozulich, Captain Ahab, David Scott Stone, Health, Laco$te, Lavender Diamond, The Mae Shi, Mika Miko, Nite Jewel, Mellowdrone, No Age, Silver Daggers, Thrones, and Upsilon Acrux started their careers. The rap-rock group Hollywood Undead represents one of the most prominent acts of the so-called budding scene music subgenre developing in Los Angeles out of the emo subculture. The rave scene and electronic music have become extremely popular in Los Angeles in the late 2000s and 2010s. Particularly house music, dubstep and drum and bass, which have all developed very strong scenes in Los Angeles. The Electric Daisy Carnival festival which is an electronic dance music festival and had an attendance of over 185,000 people over a two-day weekend. Making it the largest dance music festival in North America and one of the largest in the world. Other festivals such as Together As One, Monster Massive, Nocturnal and Hard Fest have had attendances of 50,000+ to 125,000+, Which undoubtedly makes Los Angeles the rave capital of North America. In the 2010s, Tyga was popular. DJ Mustard, YG and Ty Dolla Sign also emerged in the 2010s.https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/bjqnna/the-new-generation-of-la-rap- is-changing-everything In 2010, Echo Park Rising emerged as an impromptu street fair celebrating the artists, musicians and businesses of the Echo Park neighborhood, creating an open environment for the enjoyment of live music, independent art, and local business. The festival hosts multiple official stages and activities throughout the weekend located on the main routes of Sunset Blvd, Glendale Blvd, Alvarado Avenue, Echo Park Avenue, as well as informal shows at local venues and establishments. It has since been named Best Music Festival by LA Weekly. Echo Park Rising is presented by the Echo Park Chamber of Commerce and programming is curated by Spaceland Presents. Los Angeles Women's Music Festival The Los Angeles Women's Music Festival was a summer music festival that featured exclusively female solo artists and female-led bands. The official theme of the festival was Females on Fire. The event took place on Saturday, August 25, 2007. Los Angeles based female musicians Gayle Day, Miria (singer), Gilli Moon and Toni Koch, in partnership with Warrior Girl Music, SheJay, and Adventure Art Entertainment, produced the first women's music festival in Los Angeles. Inspired by Lilith Fair and held at Woodley Park, home of WorldFest (LA), Los Angeles' largest Earth Day festival, the Los Angeles Women's Music Festival was an eco-music- fest featuring over 65 bands on 5 solar-powered stages, offering vegan, vegetarian and organic refreshments, and featuring pet adoptions, and was attended by over 2500 people. The Los Angeles Women's Music Festival also donated a percentage of proceeds to Los Angeles animal rescue groups. The festival was started in 2007 as an annual festival but was on hiatus during 2008 and was scheduled to return in 2009, although the latter event never materialized. As of 2015, it is on indefinite hiatus due to financial challenges.Los Angeles Women’s Music Festival official website: About MySpace: Los Angeles Women’s Music Festival Newsletter - Vol. 1 Issue 1 - March 8, 2008Yahoo!

Independent certification providers vouch for the reputation of senders by verifying the domain name that is associated with transmitted electronic mail. VBR information can be used by a message transfer agent, a mail delivery agent or by an email client. The protocol is intended to become a standard for email sender certification, and is described in RFC 5518.RFC 5518, \\"Vouch By Reference\\", P. Hoffman, J. Levine, A. Hathcock (April 2009) ==OperationEmail sender=== A user of a VBR email certification service signs its messages using DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and includes a VBR-Info field in the signed header. The sender may also use the Sender Policy Framework to authenticate its domain name. The VBR-Info: header field contains the domain name that is being certified, typically the responsible domain in a DKIM signature (d= tag), the type of content in the message, and a list of one or more vouching services, that is the domain names of the services that vouch for the sender for that kind of content: VBR-Info: md=domain.name.example; mc=type; mv=vouching.example:vouching2.example ===Email receiver=== An email receiver can authenticate the message's domain name using DKIM or SPF, thus finding the domains that are responsible for the message. It then obtains the name of a vouching service that it trusts, either from among the set supplied by the sender or from a locally configured set of preferred vouching services. Using the Domain Name System, the receiver can verify whether a vouching service actually vouches for a given domain. To do so, the receiver queries a \`TXT\` resource record for the name composed: domain.name.example._vouch.vouching.example The returned data, if any, is a space-delimited list of all the types that the service vouches, given as lowercase ASCII. They should match the self-asserted message content. The types defined are \`transaction\`, \`list\`, and \`all\`. Auditing the message may allow to establish whether its content corresponds. The result of the authentication can be saved in a new header field, according to RFC 6212, like so: Authentication-Results: receiver.example; vbr=pass header.mv=vouching.example header.md=domain.name.example ==Implementations and variations== OpenDKIM and MDaemon Messaging Server by Alt-N Technologies have been among the first software implementations of VBR. OpenDKIM provides a milter as well as a standalone library. Roaring Penguin Software's CanIt anti- spam filter supports VBR as of version 7.0.8 released on 2010-11-09. Spamhaus has released The Spamhaus Whitelist that includes a domain based whitelist, the DWL, where a domain name can be queried as, e.g., \`dwltest.com._vouch.dwl.spamhaus.org\`. Although the standard only specifies \`TXT\` resource records, following a long established DNSBL practice, Spamhaus has also assigned \`A\` resource records with values 127.0.2.0/24 for whitelist return codes. The possibility to query an address may allow easier deployment of existing code. However, their techfaq recommends checking the domain (the value of the \`d=\` tag) of a valid \`DKIM-Signature\` by querying the corresponding \`TXT\` record, and their howto gives details about inserting \`VBR-Info\` header fields in messages signed by whitelisted domains.

He is known as a \\"new gentry\\" and official-entrepreneur. ==Biography== Zhang was born in Haimen county, Jiangsu province in 1853. He became a member of staff under the general Wu Changqing. He returned to the hometown after Wu's death. He was studying agriculture while preparing for the further examination, and achieved the highest score in the 1894 Palace Examination and exalted status as zhuangyuan eventually. He subsequently served at the Hanlin Academy. Zhang was obliged to return to his hometown for mourning his father, in the same year. After the First Sino-Japanese War, he began to invest in and create modern enterprises. He founded Dah Sun Cotton Mill, which financed by both the imperial court and local merchants, in Nantong later. Besides, he branched out into land reclamation, river conservancy, modern education, especially in the northern Jiangsu. It is generally accepted that Zhang is a successful entrepreneur, however, some financial improprieties led Dah Sun to an insolvent liquidation in the 1920s. Zhang proclaimed that \\"the victory of Japan and the defeat of Russia are the victory of constitutionalism and the defeat of monarchism\\". In 1909, he was elected the chairman of Jiangsu provincial assembly. He refused the membership of the Friends of the Constitution, and acted as a buffer against the active constitutionalists. But in the end of 1911, his thought swung in the republican's favour. Then he drafted the original Edict of Abdication for Puyi. He was appointed as the Minister of Enterprise of the temporary government of the Provisional Government in Nanjing, but did not take the office actually. In 1913, Zhang became the Minister of Industry and Commerce and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in Beiyang Government. ==Achievements== Zhang was among the pioneers of the Chinese modernization. Aside from companies and factories, he also founded the first normal school in modern China, Tongzhou Normal College in 1902 and established Nantong Museum, the first museum in Mainland China in 1905.

As a result of it nine people died and between 30 and 40 were injured. ==Accident== On 18 December 1850 a new railway was opened between Chester and Warrington by the Birkenhead, Lancashire and Cheshire Junction Railway. This halved the distance by rail between Manchester and Chester as trains could travel via Warrington rather than via Crewe. An early attraction to be served by the new line was Chester Races, in particular the Chester Cup on 30 April 1851. The line was advertised as The Direct Route to Chester Races and it is estimated that 4,000 people gathered at Manchester Victoria station during the morning of that day. The trains struggled to get the passengers to Chester, with one train arriving 2½ hours late and passengers from another train of 50 carriages having to walk part of the way. After the races, by 6 pm one train had already left Chester General station and soon after another train carrying about 430 passengers departed. A further train was standing in sidings with a notice \\"Manchester via Warrington\\" on its side. People crossed the line and completely filled the train. It was estimated that 900 passengers were crowded into 18 small carriages. The train left the siding at about 6.50 pm hauled by the locomotive Druid. It was assisted up the incline from Chester station by another locomotive, No. 16, pushing at the back. No. 16 returned to Chester to collect its own train and the train pulled by Druid made \\"good speed\\" to Frodsham where some passengers left it. By then it had begun to rain, this had turned to sleet, and the driving wheels had started to slip. From Frodsham station to the Sutton Weaver Viaduct there is an adverse gradient of 1:240 and the fireman and a local platelayer sanded the rails. Despite this the train made only slow progress, even on the level viaduct. Beyond the viaduct the tunnel also had an adverse gradient of 1:264 and it was a struggle to keep the train moving. By this time the train hauled by No. 16 had left Chester with only 430 passengers and was catching up with Druid's train. By the time it arrived near Sutton tunnel it was only – behind it. Druid's guard signalled to the following train to come behind and push his train. This it did but then No. 16's wheels also began to slip. In the middle of the tunnel the two trains came to a virtual or complete halt. By now the next train, pulled by Albert, had arrived in Frodsham station and it was allowed to leave two minutes later. This was 14 minutes after No. 16's train had left and 24 minutes after Druid's train; the company's rules allowed trains to pass intermediate stations at intervals of five minutes. Albert's train entered the tunnel at 15–20 miles per hour. The driver noticed a lot of steam in the tunnel and stated that he slowed, but his train collided with the rear of No. 16's train. The guard from No. 16's train walked back with a red light and stopped the next train on the viaduct. Two doctors were called from Frodsham and one from Halton village. In the accident five people had been killed outright and four died later. Between 30 and 40 people were injured. About 1,600 people were crowded inside the tunnel in complete darkness. ==Inquest and report== An inquest was held in Preston Brook and the jury returned a verdict of accidental death. The jury also added their unanimous opinion that the company should accept \\"great blame\\" and that \\"there was a want of prudence and discretion\\" on the part of the \\"officers and servants\\" of the company. A report was prepared by Captain R. M. Laffan who was appointed by the Commissioners of Railways. Captain Laffan was critical of the secretary of the company, the locomotive superintendent, the three drivers, two of the guards and the Frodsham station master, but in particular he blamed the executive committee of the railway company. He made six recommendations: a station should be built at each end of the tunnel and that the stations should be connected by an electric telegraph; two guards should be provided on each train rather than one; the locomotive stock and number of carriages should be increased; a more efficient staff should be engaged; all passenger carriages passing through the tunnel should be provided with lights; the interval of five minutes between trains should be increased. The stations were built. At the Frodsham end the station went first by the name of Runcorn, then Runcorn Road, and finally Halton; it is now closed. At the other end was Norton station, which has been replaced by Runcorn East station. ==References== Category:Railway accidents and incidents in Cheshire Category:Railway accidents in 1851 Category:1851 in England Category:Tunnel disasters Category:History of Cheshire Category:19th century in Cheshire Category:April 1851 events Category:Train collisions in England ","title":"Sutton Tunnel railway accident"},{"id":"19235790","text":"Number 209 Squadron of the British Royal Air Force was originally formed from a nucleus of \\"Naval Eight\\" on 1 February 1917 at Saint-Pol-sur-Mer, France, as No. 9 Squadron Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS)Rawlings 1978, p. 324. and saw active service in both World Wars, the Korean War and in Malaya. The use of the squadron number ceased in 1968 and it has not been reused since by an RAF squadron. ==HistoryFormation and World War I=== The Squadron was formed as a Royal Air Force Squadron on 1 April 1918, from No. 9 Squadron, Royal Naval Air Service at Clairmarais aerodrome.Halley 1988, p. 272 (All former RNAS squadrons were renumbered by the addition of 200 to their RNAS number.) During the remainder of World War I, 209 Squadron flew Sopwith Camels over the Western Front on fighter and ground support missions. The Squadron badge, the falling red eagle, symbolizes the destruction of Baron Manfred von Richthofen (commonly known as The Red Baron) who, in the 1914–1918 War, was credited to the guns of a pilot, Roy Brown from No. 209 Squadron. On 21 January 1919, the squadron was reduced to a skeleton organization and disbanded in the UK on 24 June 1919 at RAF Scopwick, Lincolnshire. ===The interbellum=== No. 209 reformed at the flying boat base at RAF Mount Batten, Plymouth on 15 January 1930.Jefford 2001, p. 72.Rawlings 1982, p. 139. It was first equipped with Blackburn Iris flying boats and then from January 1934 by Blackburn Perth but neither of these types were built in sufficient quantities to equip the squadron fully. In July 1936, however, the squadron was fully equipped with Short Singapore Mk.IIIs and it was transferred to RAF Kalafrana, Malta in September 1937 for three months. In December 1938, No 209 began to convert to yet another flying boat type, the Supermarine Stranraer.Halley 1988, p. 273 ===World War II=== Lerwick L7265, ‘WQ-Q’ of 209 Squadron. Taking off from Loch Ryan, March 1941 When the Second World War broke out, No.209 moved to Invergordon to patrol the North Sea between Scotland and Norway. From October 1939 it patrolled the Atlantic from Oban. Two further re-equipments occurred, in December 1939 (Saro Lerwicks) and then in April 1941 (Consolidated Catalinas). Familiarisation with the U.S. supplied Catalinas was aided by the secondment of U.S. military personnel who also flew on active service patrols, despite the U.S. being a neutral power at the time. Anti-submarine patrols were flown over the Atlantic from RAF Castle Archdale on Lough Erne, in Northern Ireland, using the Donegal Corridor over neutral Eire. During this time, in May 1941, a patrol by No.209 (with an American crewman) located the German battleship Bismarck.Kennedy 1975, p. 137. In August 1941, the squadron moved to Iceland for two months. From March 1942 until July 1945, No.209 was stationed in East Africa. It flew patrols over the Indian Ocean with detached bases in South Africa, Madagascar, Oman and the Seychelles to extend its cover. In July 1945 the squadron moved to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), with recently acquired Short Sunderland MkVs, with a detachment at Rangoon (now Yangon), to harass Japanese shipping along the coast from Burma (now Myanmar) to Malaya. ===Post war=== Hong Kong and Seletar After the Japanese surrender in August 1945, a detachment was sent to Hong Kong in September, followed by the rest of the squadron in October. In April 1946 the squadron moved to Singapore. A detachment remained at RAF Kai Tak and became No.1430 flight and then No.88 Squadron. The squadron headquarters was established at RAF Seletar (sometimes referred to as \\"Seltar\\"), on Singapore Island on 18 May 1946 and No.209 and was named \\"City of Hong Kong\\" Squadron on 23 January 1947. To Korea Operation Firedog missions during the Malayan Emergency began on 7 July 1948. In September 1950, during the Korean War, the aircraft were moved to Iwakuni, Yamaguchi, Japan to patrol off the Korean coast from 15 September. On 1 January 1955 the squadron merged with No. 205 Squadron. With Pioneers in the transport role On 1 November 1958 No. 267 Squadron at RAF Kuala Lumpur was renumbered 209 Squadron and flew Scottish Aviation Pioneers and Scottish Aviation Twin Pioneers on liaison and transport duties in Malaysia. No.209 Squadron was finally disbanded on 31 December 1968 at RAF Seletar. ===Notable personnel=== * Fred Everest Banbury - 1917-1918 with No. 9 Naval SquadronShores et al., p. 61. * Arthur Roy Brown * Stearne Tighe EdwardsShores et al., p. 147. * Air Chief Marshal Robert Foster - 1918 Shores et al., p. 159. * John HalesShores et al., p. 181. * Oliver Colin LeBoutillier * Wilfrid MayShores et al., p. 264. * Air Vice Marshal Francis MellershShores et al., p. 280. * John Paynter - 1917 with No. 9 Shores et al., pp. 229–230. * Oliver Redgate - 1917-1918Shores et al., p. 314. * Merrill Samuel Taylor - 1917-1918 with No. 9 and No. 209Shores et al., p. 359. ==Aircraft operated== A Saro Lerwick in the markings of No. 209 squadron RAF { +Aircraft operated by no. 9 Squadron RNAS or No. 209 Squadron RAF, data fromJefford 2001, p. 72.Rawlings 1982, p. 140.Halley 1988, p. 273. !

Ida Cook and her sister Mary Louise Cook (1901–1991) rescued Jews from the Nazis during the 1930s. The sisters helped 29 people escape, funded mainly by Ida's writing. In 1965, the Cook sisters were honoured as Righteous among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Authority in Israel.Mary Burchell at Yad Vashem site. Between 1936 and 1985, Ida Cook wrote 112 romance novels as Mary Burchell for Mills & Boon (many of which were later republished by Harlequin). She helped to found, and from 1966 to 1986 was the second president of, the Romantic Novelists' Association. In 1950 she wrote her autobiography, We Followed Our Stars, later re-edited and expanded as Safe Passage, which is currently in print. ==BiographyPersonal life=== Ida Cook was born on 24 August 1904 in Sunderland, County Durham, England. With her elder sister Mary Louise Cook (1901–1991), she attended the Duchess' School in Alnwick and later took civil service jobs in London. Ida with her sister, Louise, developed a passionate interest in opera. During the 1930s, as part of the work they undertook to help Jews to escape from the Nazi regime, the sisters visited Germany on multiple occasions, using their genuine fanaticism for opera as a cover for their frequent travel. When returning to England, they smuggled valuables (such as jewellery), which allowed Jews fleeing Germany to satisfy the British financial security requirements for immigration. They worked with Austrian conductor Clemens Krauss and his wife, the soprano Viorica Ursuleac, who had initially told them of the persecution of the Jews. The sisters helped 29 people escape, funded mainly by Ida's writing. In 1965 the Cook sisters were honoured as Righteous among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Authority in Israel. In 2010 they were posthumously named a British Hero of the Holocaust by the British Government. ===Writing career=== In 1936 Ida published her first romance novels as Mary Burchell. During her career she wrote 112 romances for Mills & Boon (re-edited by Harlequin Books), including the famous Warrender Saga, a series about the opera and concert hall world. She incorporated many famous operas (Otello, Eugene Onegin and Carmen, among others) into the Warrender series plots. She wrote in the Romantic Novelists' Association's newsletter: In 1950 she published her autobiography, We Followed Our Stars. In 2008 it was re-issued, re-edited and expanded as Safe Passage. She ghost-wrote Tito Gobbi's autobiography, My Life. She was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1956 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre. == Legacy == In January 2017 Sunderland Council erected a blue plaque commemorating the sisters on the site of their childhood home at 37 Croft Avenue, Sunderland. In 2017 producer Donald Rosenfeld discussed plans to make a film of the sisters' humanitarian work and his efforts to unseal CIA files on their activities. The film is to be based on a biography of the sisters by investigative journalist Isabel Vincent, which is scheduled to be published in 2020 by John Murray in the United Kingdom and Hachette Books in the United States. ==Bibliography== Burchell's works include: ===As Mary Burchell=== Single novels *Wife to Christopher, 1936 *Except my Love, 1937 *Nobody Asked Me, 1937 *But Not For Me, 1938 *Other Lips Have Loved You (later republished as Two Loves Have I), 1938 *With all my Worldly goods, 1938 *Yet Love Remains, 1938 *After Office Hours, 1939 *Little Sister, 1939 *One of the Family, 1939 *Such is Love, 1939 *I'll Go With You, 1940 *Pay Me Tomorrow, 1940 *Yours With Love, 1940 *Accompanied by his Wife, 1941 *Always Yours, 1941 *Just a Nice Girl, 1941 *Strangers May Marry, 1941 *Love Made the Choice, 1942 *Thine Is My Heart, 1942 *Where Shall I Wander?

The nearest towns are Heanor, situated 2.6 miles (4.2 km) northeast, and Belper, 3.2 miles (5.1 km) northwest, while the city of Derby is located about 6 miles (9.6 km) south-southwest. The name is said to mean \\"houses in the wood belonging to Horsley\\", and is often known by its dialect pronunciation \\"Ossley Woodhus\\". The Old Oak pub ==Carnival== Each year in July the village hosts a carnival with a parade of floats from the Medical Centre to the showground at the Sitwell Recreation Ground. A prize, the Twins Cup, is awarded to the best float each year. The winner in 2010 was the Pirate Ship created by the Stainsby Avenue residents. The prize was split in 2011 between the Stainsby Avenue residents' Circus float, and the Pre-School's Royal Wedding float.http://www.belpernews.co.uk The carnival showground features rides and sideshows and is also the venue for the Amber Valley Marching Bands Contest.

Built in the 1780s, by the end of the 18th Century it had been acquired by the Wilmot-Sitwell family, relatives of the Sitwells of Renishaw Hall through George Sitwell. The Wilmot- Sitwells were great benefactors to the villages of Horsley Woodhouse, Horsley, Smalley and Morley. The present Church Hall in Horsley Woodhouse was originally built as a school in 1869 by the Wilmot- Sitwells.http://www.derbyphotos.co.uk/areas_a_h/horsley_woodhouse.htm Once the Wilmot-Sitwell line had died out the house was sold and eventually demolished in 1972.http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/DERBYSGEN/2000-12/0975783225 A new, futuristic-looking house was then built, also called Stainsby House. This new house was used as a location in the BBC television production of Life and Loves of a She Devil. Hollies Farm in the centre of the village was built in the late 17th century and was used as a tannery for many years by the Richardson family. This family later moved the business to Derby and eventually to the Eagle Tannery in Sinfin. Hollies Farm has been the subject of a planning application to demolish it in order to build houses. St Susanna's church was erected in 1882. A Stained glass window was given by the Wilmot- Sitwells.http://www.andrewspages.dial.pipex.com/dby/kelly/horsleywoodhouse.htm ==References Category:Civil parishes in Derbyshire Category:Villages in Derbyshire Category:Geography of Amber Valley ","title":"Horsley Woodhouse"},{"id":"19235975","text":"Louis of Anhalt-Köthen (b.

He had one brother, Hyman Garshin Landau (1909-1966), and five sisters: Lottie Landau Applebaum (1904-1996), Rose Landau Fox (1907-1961), Edith Landau (1914-1942), Sylvia Landau Kasdan (1917-2012), and Jean Landau Glanz (1919-1955). (Sylvia is the mother of screenwriter and director Lawrence Kasdan.) His parents were Lazear \\"Leonard\\" Landau (1879-1936) and Anna Stopnitsky Landau (1883-1949), both Polish immigrants. Landau graduated from Peabody High School in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1940. He was an active and artistic student, contributing his time to the Masque and Wig Club (President), Palette and Brush Club (President), French Club, Debating Club, and the Stunt Day Committee. He was also a member of the National Honor Society, a reporter for The Civitan (the school's newspaper), and an actor in the school's 1940 play, What A Life. He graduated from St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe) in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1944. ==Early career== Landau's first time working on Broadway occurred in April 1944 when he did the lighting design for War President, a play by Nat Sherman. The play, a \\"drama about [Abraham] Lincoln and his relationships with his Cabinet,\\" was staged at the Shubert Theatre (New York City), and it had only two performances (April 24-25). Landau eventually began doing set design and costume design, working on such plays as A Phoenix Too Frequent and Freight (both one-act plays produced by Stephen H. Scheuer and Bernard Carson in 1950), Mary Rose (produced by Helen Hayes for the ANTA Playhouse in 1951), and Dear Barbarians (starring Cloris Leachman and produced by Gant Gaither in 1952). In 1955, he directed The Carefree Tree, a two-act play by Aldyth Morris performed at the Phoenix Theatre (New York City). Also in 1955, Landau was awarded the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director for his work on The Clandestine Marriage and The White Devil. ==The American Shakespeare Festival Theatre and Academy== After spending some time in London on the staff of The Old Vic, as well as working on a production of Measure for Measure at Stratford-upon-Avon, Landau's efforts caught the eye of John Houseman, who had been hired as artistic director for the American Shakespeare Festival Theatre and Academy in Stratford, Connecticut, in early 1956. On May 8, 1956, it was announced that Landau would be the new associate director at the Shakespearean establishment. (See American Shakespeare Theatre.) When Houseman resigned his position in August 1959, Landau was appointed as his replacement the following month. In September 1961, Landau was asked to make a Shakespearean theatrical presentation at The White House at the request of President John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, to honor a visit from President Ibrahim Abboud of the Sudan. On the evening of Wednesday, October 4, 1961, Landau directed seven of his actors in five scenes from the following plays: Macbeth, Troilus and Cressida, Henry V, As You Like It and The Tempest. It marked the first time Shakespeare had been performed at The White House since 1910, when several performers emoted on the south lawn during the Howard Taft administration. ==Death== After having worked as a drama instructor at both Yale University and Boston University, Landau joined the public affairs department of CBS News. In early 1967, he was working as a consultant on a television special for WHDH (Channel 7) in Boston. During the early morning hours of March 15, three teenagers broke into his apartment. Landau, who was clothed in a robe and slippers, was tied up with wire, after which he was beaten, strangled and stabbed. His body was discovered by his agent, David Weiss, on the evening of March 16. Landau's apartment had been ransacked, and several items had been stolen, including his white convertible. On the evening of March 18, Boston homicide detectives and Revere police officers arrested Michael E. Riley, 19, Eugene G. McKenna, 17, and Frederick Simons, 16, all residents of Revere, for the murder of Jack Landau. Riley and McKenna were charged with murder. Because of his age, Simons was charged with \\"being a delinquent child by reason of murder\\" and he was tried in juvenile court. In January 1968, Riley and McKenna were sentenced to life in prison. In February 1969, the Massachusetts Supreme Court overturned the murder convictions because the police did not let the suspects talk with their attorneys while they were being questioned. Since the case would be up for retrial, Riley and McKenna seized the opportunity to strike a plea deal, and they pled guilty to manslaughter, each being sentenced to 12 to 20 years for Landau's death. ==References* Jack Landau at the Internet Off- Broadway Database * Category:1922 births Category:1967 deaths Category:American murder victims Category:American theatre directors Category:Drama Desk Award winners Category:People murdered in Massachusetts Category:Deaths by stabbing in Massachusetts ","title":"Jack Landau (director)"},{"id":"19235977","text":"was a case decided in the Court of King's Bench in 1774. On its face it was a private action for recovery of sums paid to a tax agent, but the decision laid down the principles of the King's constitutional authority in a British colony, deciding amongst other things that such authority is absolute until a representative assembly is granted, at which point the authority of the Crown is limited. The matter was first heard in the Mayor's and City of London Court, which court found a special verdict and remitted it to the Court of King's Bench, which then heard the claim on a matter of law. The decision turned on the validity of a tax imposed in Grenada. This was the trigger for an examination of the constitutional position of Grenada and for a review of the position in all British territories. The political situation at the time of the judgment was interesting too; this was the time of the tax rebellion in the American colonies (including the West Indies) and was indeed two years before the American Declaration of Independence. The judgment therefore had the potential to cause political trouble. Lord Mansfield's judgment looked beyond the narrow facts of the case. He reviewed the law applicable to British colonies in general and laid down a series of important points of constitutional law applicable to British possessions. ==Facts== Grenada was conquered from the French and formally ceded to Great Britain in 1763. The King issued a proclamation dated 7 October 1763 that all governors of the newly acquired colonies were instructed \\"as soon as the state and circumstances of the said colonies will admit\\" to call a general assembly. On 9 April 1764, the King (George III) appointed a Governor, General Melville. Finally, on 24 July 1764 (before Melville had set sail for Grenada) letters patent were issued to impose a four and a half per cent duty upon all goods and sugars exported from the island of Grenada, to equalise the duty across the Leeward Islands. Melville arrived in Grenada on 14 December 1764. In 1765 he summoned an assembly. James Campbell bought a plantation on Grenada. William Hall was a collector of the four and a half per cent duty. Campbell brought a claim to recover from Hall the money he had paid as duty. Campbell claimed that 4½% duty had not been imposed by lawful or sufficient authority. Campbell succeeded, the decision turning on important constitutional principles. ==Judgment== Lord Mansfield CJ held that :* A country conquered by the British arms becomes part of the possessions and dominions of the King in right of the Crown of the United Kingdom; and, therefore, necessarily subject to the jurisdiction of Parliament. :* The conquered inhabitants once received the King's protection, become the King's subjects in all respects. :* The law of a colony equally affects all persons and all property there: \\"Englishmen\\" have no privilege in the colony distinct from the conquered inhabitants of the colony. :* The King has power to make laws for the conquered country without the concurrence of Parliament (except that this legislation is subordinate to his own authority in Parliament so that he cannot make any new change contrary to fundamental principles such as exempting an individual from the power of Parliament). :* Once the King has irrevocably granted a territory a representative assembly to concur in law making, he can no longer legislate by decree or impose taxation without them. Lord Mansfield's judgment reaffirmed the authority of the king to make law and impose taxation upon a colony by his own authority. In addition to past judicial pronouncements (of which few were found) he examined historical sources. In particular he found that the sovereign ruled freely by charter and decree in Ireland until its own parliament was founded, Wales until its annexation, Berwick-upon-Tweed until the days of James I and in Calais until its loss, and that power remained unchallenged in other extant British colonies. However, in contrast in Jamaica, which had a representative assembly, it had been previously decided that a governor could not override a troublesome assembly. Just as in Great Britain the King was restrained by Parliament, the Governor had no power to force laws or taxes on a colony without the consent of its assembly. Only an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain could do that. Lord Mansfield recognised that the 4½% duty was fair and equitable, even desirable to avoid distorting trade between the Windward Islands. Nevertheless, he ruled it unlawful. Notwithstanding the crown's wide authority, where a colony has a representative assembly, taxation cannot be imposed without its consent or by Act of Parliament. In this case the letters patent of 24 July 1764 predated by some months the existence of the assembly. Nevertheless, Lord Mansfield held that the requirement to call the assembly was in the King's proclamation of 9 April 1764. Therefore, the King's absolute authority ended on that date, notwithstanding that the assembly had not been called and indeed the governor who was to call it had not even left Britain. ==Significance== Campbell v. Hall has been cited or referred to in several later cases in the British Empire. Most pointedly it was cited with approval in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company, Limited v. The King,West Rand Central Gold Mining Company, Limited v. The King, [1905] 2 K.B. 391 a case which concerned the conquest of the Transvaal and the consequential extinction of the vanquished state's obligations. Its principles were also discussed and distinguished with respect to colonies acquired otherwise than by conquest, by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in its 1938 ruling in Sammut v. Strickland. It was also argued in 2008 in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State For Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (also known as the Chagos Islanders case), where Lord Hoffmann, in introducing his opinion, stated: He resumed later: Campbell v Hall also called into question the ouster of French law in Quebec by proclamation in 1763. As a result, the Quebec Act was passed in 1774 to confirm that French law continued to govern civil matters, but was ousted in favour of English law in criminal matters. Parliament subsequently passed the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865 to deal with conflicting jurisprudence that arose in the years following Campbell. ==See also== *UK constitutional law ==References== Category:Court of King's Bench (England) cases Category:Constitution of the United Kingdom Category:1774 in case law Category:1774 in British law Category:Royal prerogative Category:Lord Mansfield cases Category:United Kingdom constitutional case law ","title":"Campbell v Hall"},{"id":"19235978","text":"Mirage was recorded as an album by Eric Burdon and The Eric Burdon Band in 1973 during the \\"Mirage Project\\".

They were administered by The Manchester Evening News, and presented at an annual ceremony in Manchester, England. The awards were for regional and nationally touring productions and were created in 1981 by Alan Hulme, the MEN theatre critic, who wrote for the paper from 1970 to 2000. ==History and significance== The awards were established in 1981, by Alan Hulme, the paper's theatre critic from 1970 - 2000, with the first ceremony held in the conference room of the MEN in their then Deansgate offices, with Mike Harding as the first MC. They were quickly recognised as the most important theatrical prize giving outside London and the annual ceremony was regarded as the regional theatre event of the year. In summer 2011, the Manchester Evening News ended its association with the awards blaming the \\"challenging economic climate\\". A group of former panel members, led by Alan Hulme and his successor Kevin Bourke, announced in October 2011 that they were to continue the awards as an independent body under the name Manchester Theatre Awards. ==References== Category:British theatre awards Category:English awards Category:Awards established in 1981 Category:Awards by newspapers Category:1981 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards"},{"id":"19236039","text":"The 1989 European Aquatics Championships were held from 15 to 20 August 1989 in Bonn, West Germany. ==Medal tableSwimmingMen's events=== { -

Emory University Hospital is staffed exclusively by Emory University School of Medicine faculty who also are members of The Emory Clinic. The hospital is renowned as one of the nation's leaders in cardiology and cardiac surgery, oncology, transplantation, ophthalmology, and the neurosciences. ==History== Emory University Hospital's history dates back over a century. In March 1904, its predecessor, Wesley Memorial Hospital, was chartered with 50 beds. The hospital was housed in a downtown Atlanta mansion that had been spared from destruction by General Sherman's army during the Civil War. By November 1922, the hospital had grown too large for its quarters and moved to its current DeKalb County site on the Emory University campus. The new 275-bed facility was a gift of Asa G. Candler, philanthropist and founder of The Coca-Cola Company. In the mid-1930s, its name was changed to Emory University Hospital. The university and the hospital bear the name of Bishop John Emory, who presided at a meeting of the Georgia Methodist Conference in 1834 when delegates decided to establish a Methodist college in Georgia. The City of Atlanta annexed Emory University effective January 1, 2018. \\\\- This article includes a map of the annexed area, which includes Emory Hospital Prior to the annexation, the hospital was in an unincorporated area, statistically in the Druid Hills census-designated place.\\"2010 CENSUS - CENSUS BLOCK MAP: Druid Hills CDP, GA.\\" U.S. Census Bureau.

The hospital is located on the Emory University campus in northeast Atlanta.More than 24,000 inpatients and 80,000 outpatients come to Emory University Hospital each year. They receive care from physicians of The Emory Clinic, who also are faculty of the Emory University School of Medicine, and from a highly trained staff of nurses and other clinical professionals.

News and World Report's \\"America's Best Hospitals\\" for several years as one of the nation's top 10 cardiology centers.The latest data show it has 23,710 admissions and performs 9,446 inpatient and 2,843 outpatient surgeries. Its emergency room has 30,476 visits. Located in Atlanta, GA, it is accredited by the Joint Commission, Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF). It is also a teaching hospital. ==Rankings== On the U.S. News's \\"America's Best Hospitals\\", 2010–11, Emory University Hospital was ranked in 11 adult specialties. Out of 4,852 facilities analyzed for the 2010-11 Best Hospitals rankings, only 152 were ranked in any of the 16 specialties and this hospital was one of them. ==2014 West Africa Ebola Outbreak== On July 31, 2014, the United States government and the Centers for Disease Control announced that Emory Hospital would treat at least one of the patients of the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak in a specialized isolation facility. Brantly was released August 21, 2014 with Dr. Bruce Ribner, director of Emory’s Infectious Disease Unit, declaring that Brantly \\"… has recovered from the Ebola virus disease and he can return to his family, to his community, and to his life without any public health concerns\\". In his statement, Brantly reported that Writebol had been released two days earlier (on August 19). Brantly and Writebol were the first patients ever to be treated with the experimental drug ZMapp, splitting a dose between both patients; Samaritan's Purse later reported Brantly's condition began to improve within hours of receiving the treatment, although they point out that it is unclear if either the treatment or a blood transfusion, received in Africa from a young Ebola survivor, was responsible for the improvement. On October 15, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that Amber Vinson, the second case of Ebola transmission in the U.S., would be transferred to Emory. Vinson has since recovered from the disease and been declared Ebola-free. ==References External links == *Emory University Hospital (official web site) *Emory Healthcare – What we're about *Emory Healthcare – Specialties *US News & World Report → Health → Hospitals → Emory University Hospital Category:Hospitals in Atlanta Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1922 Hospital Category:Druid Hills, Georgia Category:Health facilities that treated Ebola patients ","title":"Emory University Hospital"},{"id":"19236145","text":"Sørbyhaugen is a former subway station on the Oslo Metro.

When the computer is built, it gives the scientists instructions for the creation of a living organism named Andromeda, but one of the scientists, John Fleming, fears that Andromeda's purpose is to subjugate humanity. ==Cast== * Tom Hardy as John Fleming * Charlie Cox as Dennis Bridger * Kelly Reilly as Christine Jones / Andromeda * Jane Asher as Professor Madeleine Dawnay * David Haig as General Vandenberg * Colin Stinton as Kaufman ==Production== The series was produced by Richard Fell, who the previous year had overseen The Quatermass Experiment, a live remake of the 1953 TV series of the same name, also largely absent from the BBC archives. Talking about the decision to commission the remake, Fell said, \\"We thought A for Andromeda was too good an opportunity to miss... it is the obvious follow up [to The Quatermass Experiment]. It had a huge impact when it arrived. It's also lost to the TV archives and it was an amazing story and, like Quatermass, very forward looking\\".Brown, A for Andromeda, R for Remake, p. 80. He added, \\"It raises themes about artificial intelligence, cloning, biological warfare and the political exploitation of science which are as important today as they were when it was written – if not more so. It is also a strange kind of love story, if a man can fall in love with a machine that is\\". Fell also adapted Hoyle and Elliot's original teleplays; at 85 minutes, this new version was much shorter that the original which ran for almost 300 minutes. In condensing the script, Fell used considerably fewer characters and locations. This included resetting the location from a radio telescope to a signals intelligence ground station. Fell also merged several characters – for instance, Judy Adamson and Christine were merged into the character of Christine; the Madeline Dawnay character combined the roles of both the original Dawnay character and that of Rheinhart while General Vandenberg took on the role of many of the authority figures from the original.Brown. A for Andromeda, R for Remake, p. 82. Cast as Christine/Andromeda was Kelly Reilly, best known for her role in Mrs Henderson Presents (2005) for which she won a number of awards including a Chopard Trophy at the Cannes Film Festival. Fleming was played by Tom Hardy, best known to science fiction fans as Shinzon in Star Trek Nemesis (2002). Bridger was played by Charlie Cox and Vandenberg by David Haig. Dawnay was played by Jane Asher; Fell had hoped to be able to cast Julie Christie in this role as a nod to the original but the actress was unavailable. Directed by John Strickland, it was shot on location in early 2006 at Stanmore Air Base and the Brecon Beacons. ==Reception== First broadcast on Monday, 27 March 2006 on BBC Four, it was watched by 580,000 viewers, making it the top rated programme on BBC Four for that week.

United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States set an important standard to prevent double jeopardy.. ==Facts and procedural history== The defendant was charged with violations of the Harrison Narcotics Act; specifically, he was indicted on five separate counts, all involving the sale of morphine to the same purchaser. The jury returned a verdict against petitioner upon the second, third, and fifth counts only. The second count charged a sale on a specified day of ten grains of the drug not in or from the original stamped package; the third count charged a sale on the following day of eight grains of the drug not in or from the original stamped package; the fifth count charged the latter sale also as having been made not in pursuance of a written order of the purchaser as required by the statute. The district court sentenced petitioner to five years' imprisonment and a fine of $2,000 upon each count, the terms of imprisonment to run consecutively; and this judgment was affirmed on appeal by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The defendant advanced two legal theories as his defense: #That the two sales charged in the second and third counts as having been made to the same person constitute a single, continuous offense. #That the sale charged in the third count as having been made not from the original stamped package, and the same sale charged in the fifth count as having been made not in pursuance of a written order of the purchaser, constitute but one offense, for which only a single penalty lawfully may be imposed. ==Decision== Justice Sutherland, writing for a unanimous court, first held that the two sales, having been made at different times (albeit to the same person), were two separate and distinct violations of the law. He then held that under the statute, two distinct offenses are created by each section: § 1 of the Act creates the offense of selling any of the forbidden drugs except in or from the original stamped package, and § 2 creates the offense of selling any of such drugs not in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom the drug is sold. Because the defendant had violated both sections, he could be prosecuted separately under the two sections. As to the issue of whether the defendant had been subjected to double jeopardy, Sutherland reasoned that he did not: While Sutherland conceded that the penalties under the Act were harsh, he wrote that it was up to Congress, rather than the courts, to change the sentencing scheme. Although this case is often cited for the standard it set with regard to double jeopardy, the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution is not mentioned anywhere in the text of the opinion itself. This case was a landmark case, and it established the \\"same elements test\\" for determining when two offenses are the same for purposes of double jeopardy. Under the Blockburger test, a defendant may be convicted of two offenses arising out of the same criminal incident if each crime contains an element not found in the other. The appellate court determines whether each crime contains an element not found in the other by examining only the relevant statute, the information and the bill of particulars, and not the evidence presented at trial.

It has 56 vertices, and 702 facets: 126 311 and 576 6-simplexes. For visualization this 7-dimensional polytope is often displayed in a special skewed orthographic projection direction that fits its 56 vertices within an 18-gonal regular polygon (called a Petrie polygon). Its 756 edges are drawn between 3 rings of 18 vertices, and 2 vertices in the center. Specific higher elements (faces, cells, etc.) can also be extracted and drawn on this projection. The 1-skeleton of the 321 polytope is the Gosset graph.

It was discovered by Thorold Gosset, published in his 1900 paper. He called it an 8-ic semi-regular figure.Gosset, 1900 Its Coxeter symbol is 421, describing its bifurcating Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, with a single ring on the end of the 4-node sequences, . The rectified 421 is constructed by points at the mid-edges of the 421. The birectified 421 is constructed by points at the triangle face centers of the 421. The trirectified 421 is constructed by points at the tetrahedral centers of the 421, and is the same as the rectified 142. These polytopes are part of a family of 255 = 28 − 1 convex uniform 8-polytopes, made of uniform 7-polytope facets and vertex figures, defined by all permutations of one or more rings in this Coxeter-Dynkin diagram: . == 421 polytope== {  align=\\"right\\" style=\\"margin-left:10px\\" width=\\"250\\" !bgcolor=#e7dcc3 colspan=2421 - bgcolor=#e7dcc3TypeUniform 8-polytope - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Familyk21 polytope - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Schläfli symbol {3,3,3,3,32,1} - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Coxeter symbol 421 - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Coxeter diagrams = - bgcolor=#e7dcc37-faces19440 total: 2160 41125px 17280 {36}25px - bgcolor=#e7dcc36-faces207360: 138240 {35}25px 69120 {35}25px - bgcolor=#e7dcc35-faces483840 {34}25px - bgcolor=#e7dcc34-faces483840 {33}25px - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Cells241920 {3,3}25px - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Faces60480 {3}25px - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Edges6720 - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Vertices240 - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Vertex figure321 polytope - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Petrie polygon30-gon - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Coxeter groupE8, [34,2,1], order 696729600 - bgcolor=#e7dcc3Propertiesconvex } The 421 polytope has 17,280 7-simplex and 2,160 7-orthoplex facets, and 240 vertices. Its vertex figure is the 321 polytope. As its vertices represent the root vectors of the simple Lie group E8, this polytope is sometimes referred to as the E8 root polytope. The vertices of this polytope can also be obtained by taking the 240 integral octonions of norm 1. Because the octonions are a nonassociative normed division algebra, these 240 points have a multiplication operation making them not into a group but rather a loop, in fact a Moufang loop. For visualization this 8-dimensional polytope is often displayed in a special skewed orthographic projection direction that fits its 240 vertices within a regular triacontagon (called a Petrie polygon). Its 6720 edges are drawn between the 240 vertices. Specific higher elements (faces, cells, etc.) can also be extracted and drawn on this projection. ===Alternate names === *This polytope was discovered by Thorold Gosset, who described it in his 1900 paper as an 8-ic semi-regular figure. It is the last finite semiregular figure in his enumeration, semiregular to him meaning that it contained only regular facets. *E. L. Elte named it V240 (for its 240 vertices) in his 1912 listing of semiregular polytopes.Elte, 1912 *H.S.M. Coxeter called it 421 because its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram has three branches of length 4, 2, and 1, with a single node on the terminal node of the 4 branch. * Dischiliahectohexaconta- myriaheptachiliadiacosioctaconta-zetton (Acronym Fy) - 2160-17280 facetted polyzetton (Jonathan Bowers)Klitzing, (o3o3o3o *c3o3o3o3x - fy) === Coordinates=== It is created by a Wythoff construction upon a set of 8 hyperplane mirrors in 8-dimensional space. The 240 vertices of the 421 polytope can be constructed in two sets: 112 (22×8C2) with coordinates obtained from (\\\\pm 2,\\\\pm 2,0,0,0,0,0,0)\\\\, by taking an arbitrary combination of signs and an arbitrary permutation of coordinates, and 128 roots (27) with coordinates obtained from (\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 1)\\\\, by taking an even number of minus signs (or, equivalently, requiring that the sum of all the eight coordinates be a multiple of 4). Each vertex has 56 nearest neighbors; for example, the nearest neighbors of the vertex (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) are those whose coordinates sum to 4, namely the 28 obtained by permuting the coordinates of (2, 2,0,0,0,0,0,0)\\\\, and the 28 obtained by permuting the coordinates of (1,1,1,1,1,1,-1,-1). These 56 points are the vertices of a 321 polytope in 7 dimensions. Each vertex has 126 second nearest neighbors: for example, the nearest neighbors of the vertex (1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) are those whose coordinates sum to 0, namely the 56 obtained by permuting the coordinates of (2, -2,0,0,0,0,0,0)\\\\, and the 70 obtained by permuting the coordinates of (1,1,1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1). These 126 points are the vertices of a 231 polytope in 7 dimensions. Each vertex also has 56 third nearest neighbors, which are the negatives of its nearest neighbors, and one antipodal vertex, for a total of 1 + 56 + 126 + 56 + 1 = 240 vertices. Another decomposition gives the 240 points in 9-dimensions as an expanded 8-simplex, and two opposite birectified 8-simplexes, and . : (3,-3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) : 72 vertices : (-2,-2,-2,1,1,1,1,1,1) : 84 vertices : (2,2,2,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1) : 84 vertices This arises similarly to the relation of the A8 lattice and E8 lattice, sharing 8 mirrors of A8: File:A8-e8 lattice relation.png. { class= + A7 Coxeter plane projections !Name !Rectified 421 !expanded 8-simplex !birectified 8-simplexes !birectified 8-simplexes - !Vertices240728484 - !Image 200px 200px colspan=2 align=center200px } === Tessellations === This polytope is the vertex figure for a uniform tessellation of 8-dimensional space, represented by symbol 521 and Coxeter-Dynkin diagram: : ===Construction and faces=== The facet information of this polytope can be extracted from its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram: : Removing the node on the short branch leaves the 7-simplex: : Removing the node on the end of the 2-length branch leaves the 7-orthoplex in its alternated form (411): : Every 7-simplex facet touches only 7-orthoplex facets, while alternate facets of an orthoplex facet touch either a simplex or another orthoplex. There are 17,280 simplex facets and 2160 orthoplex facets. Since every 7-simplex has 7 6-simplex facets, each incident to no other 6-simplex, the 421 polytope has 120,960 (7×17,280) 6-simplex faces that are facets of 7-simplexes. Since every 7-orthoplex has 128 (27) 6-simplex facets, half of which are not incident to 7-simplexes, the 421 polytope has 138,240 (26×2160) 6-simplex faces that are not facets of 7-simplexes. The 421 polytope thus has two kinds of 6-simplex faces, not interchanged by symmetries of this polytope. The total number of 6-simplex faces is 259200 (120,960+138,240). The vertex figure of a single-ring polytope is obtained by removing the ringed node and ringing its neighbor(s). This makes the 321 polytope. : Seen in a configuration matrix, the element counts can be derived by mirror removal and ratios of Coxeter group orders.Coxeter, Regular Polytopes, 11.8 Gossett figures in six, seven, and eight dimensions, p. 202-203 { class= !E8width=80k-face fk  f0  f1f2f3f4f5colspan=2f6colspan=2f7 k-figurenotes - align=right E7  ( ) ! f0 BGCOLOR=\\"#e0e0ff\\" 2405675640321008012096403220165761263_21 polytope  E8/E7 = 192x10!/72x8! = 240 - align=right A1E6   ! f1 2BGCOLOR=\\"#ffe0ff\\" 672027216720108043221672272_21 polytope  E8/A1E6 = 192x10!/2/72x6! = 6720 - align=right A2D5  {3} ! f2 33BGCOLOR=\\"#ffe0e0\\" 604801680160804016105-demicube  E8/A2D5 = 192x10!/6/2^4/5! = 60480 - align=right A3A4  {3,3} ! f3 464BGCOLOR=\\"#ffffe0\\" 2419201030201055Rectified 5-cell  E8/A3A4 = 192x10!/4!/5! = 241920 - align=right A4A2A1  {3,3,3} ! f4 510105BGCOLOR=\\"#e0ffe0\\" 48384066323Triangular prism E8/A4A2A1 = 192x10!/5!/3!/2 = 483840 - align=right A5A1  {3,3,3,3} ! f5 61520156BGCOLOR=\\"#e0ffff\\" 4838402112Isosceles triangle E8/A5A1 = 192x10!/6!/2 = 483840 - align=right A6 rowspan=2 {3,3,3,3,3} !rowspan=2 f6 7213535217BGCOLOR=\\"#e0e0ff\\"138240BGCOLOR=\\"#e0e0ff\\"*11rowspan=2 E8/A6 = 192x10!/7! = 138240 - align=right A6A1  7213535217BGCOLOR=\\"#e0e0ff\\"*BGCOLOR=\\"#e0e0ff\\"6912002 E8/A6A1 = 192x10!/7!/2 = 69120 - align=right A7  {3,3,3,3,3,3} !rowspan=2 f7 8285670562880BGCOLOR=\\"#ffe0ff\\"17280BGCOLOR=\\"#ffe0ff\\"*rowspan=2 ( )E8/A7 = 192x10!/8! = 17280 - align=right D7  {3,3,3,3,3,4} 14842805606724486464BGCOLOR=\\"#ffe0ff\\"*BGCOLOR=\\"#ffe0ff\\"2160 E8/D7 = 192x10!/2^6/7! = 2160 } === Projections === { class= - align=center 360px The 421 graph created as string art. 320px E8 Coxeter plane projection }  3D { class= width=540 - valign=top 240px Mathematical representation of the physical Zome model isomorphic (?) to E8.

The first polytope in this family is the semiregular triangular prism which is constructed from three squares (2-orthoplexes) and two triangles (2-simplexes). === Geometric folding === The 421 polytope can be projected into 3-space as a physical vertex-edge model. Pictured here as 2 concentric 600-cells (at the golden ratio) using Zome tools.David Richter: Gosset's Figure in 8 Dimensions, A Zome Model (Not all of the 3360 edges of length (-1) are represented.) The 421 is related to the 600-cell by a geometric folding of the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. This can be seen in the E8/H4 Coxeter plane projections. The 240 vertices of the 421 polytope are projected into 4-space as two copies of the 120 vertices of the 600-cell, one copy smaller (scaled by the golden ratio) than the other with the same orientation. Seen as a 2D orthographic projection in the E8/H4 Coxeter plane, the 120 vertices of the 600-cell are projected in the same four rings as seen in the 421. The other 4 rings of the 421 graph also match a smaller copy of the four rings of the 600-cell. { class=\\" collapsible collapsed\\" !colspan=2E8/H4 Coxeter plane foldings - - align=center valign=top E8 H4 - align=center valign=top 240px 421 240px 600-cell - !colspan=2[20] symmetry planes - align=center valign=top 240px 421 240px 600-cell } === Related polytopes=== In 4-dimensional complex geometry, the regular complex polytope 3{3}3{3}3{3}3, and Coxeter diagram exists with the same vertex arrangement as the 421 polytope. It is self-dual. Coxeter called it the Witting polytope, after Alexander Witting. Coxeter expresses its Shephard group symmetry by 3[3]3[3]3[3]3.Coxeter Regular Convex Polytopes, 12.5 The Witting polytope The 421 is sixth in a dimensional series of semiregular polytopes. Each progressive uniform polytope is constructed vertex figure of the previous polytope.

Its development is motivated by the prospect of combining the advantages of solid- state batteries with the advantages of thin-film manufacturing processes. Thin-film construction could lead to improvements in specific energy, energy density, and power density on top of the gains from using a solid electrolyte. It allows for flexible cells only a few microns thick. It may also reduce manufacturing costs from scalable roll-to-roll processing and even allow for the use of cheap materials. Lithium Ion Battery ==Background== Lithium-ion batteries store chemical energy in reactive chemicals at the anodes and cathodes of a cell. Typically, anodes and cathodes exchange lithium (Li+) ions through a fluid electrolyte that passes through a porous separator which prevents direct contact between the anode and cathode. Such contact would lead to an internal short circuit and a potentially hazardous uncontrolled reaction. Electric current is usually carried by conductive collectors at the anodes and cathodes to and from the negative and positive terminals of the cell (respectively). In a thin-film lithium battery the electrolyte is solid and the other components are deposited in layers on a substrate. In some designs, the solid electrolyte also serves as a separator. ==Components of Thin Film BatteryCathode materials=== Cathode materials in thin film lithium ion batteries are the same as in classical lithium ion batteries. They are normally metal oxides that are deposited as a film by various methods. Metal oxide materials are shown below as well as their relative specific capacities (), open circuit voltages (), and energy densities (). {  style=\\"float: left; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\\" + Material Ratings - ! ! scope=\\"col\\"  (Ah/kg) ! scope=\\"col\\"  (V) ! scope=\\"col\\"  (Wh/kg) - ! scope=\\"col\\"  LiCoO2  align=\\"center\\"  145  align=\\"center\\"  4  align=\\"center\\"  580 - ! scope=\\"col\\"  LiMn2O4  align=\\"center\\"  148  align=\\"center\\"  4  align=\\"center\\"  592 - ! scope=\\"col\\"  LiFePO4  align=\\"center\\"  170  align=\\"center\\"  3.4  align=\\"center\\"  578 } { style=\\"float: left; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\\" - + Energy Density -  align=\\"center\\"  -  align=\\"center\\"  : capacity (mAh/g) -  align=\\"center\\"  : Open circuit potential } ===Deposition methods for cathode materials=== There are various methods being used to deposit thin film cathode materials onto the current collector.  Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD)  In Pulsed Laser Deposition, materials are fabricated by controlling parameters such as laser energy and fluence, substrate temperature, background pressure, and target-substrate distance.  Magnetron Sputtering  In Magnetron Sputtering the substrate is cooled for deposition.  Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)  In Chemical Vapor Deposition, volatile precursor materials are deposited onto a substrate material.  Sol-Gel Processing  Sol-gel processing allows for homogeneous mixing of precursor materials at the atomic level. ===Electrolyte=== The greatest difference between classical lithium ion batteries and thin, flexible, lithium ion batteries is in the electrolyte material used. Progress in lithium ion batteries relies as much on improvements in the electrolyte as it does in the electrode materials, as the electrolyte plays a major role in safe battery operation. The concept of thin film lithium ion batteries was increasingly motivated by manufacturing advantages presented by the polymer technology for their use as electrolytes. LiPON, lithium phosphorus oxynitride, is an amorphous glassy material used as an electrolyte material in thin film flexible batteries. Layers of LiPON are deposited over the cathode material at ambient temperatures by RF magnetron sputtering. This forms the solid electrolyte used for ion conduction between anode and cathode. LiBON, lithium boron oxynitride, is another amorphous glassy material used as a solid electrolyte material in thin film flexible batteries. Solid polymer electrolytes offer several advantages in comparison to a classical liquid lithium ion battery. Rather than having separate components of electrolyte, binder, and separator, these solid electrolytes can act as all three. This increases the overall energy density of the assembled battery because the constituents of the entire cell are more tightly packed. ===Separator Material=== Separator materials in lithium ion batteries must not block the transport of lithium ions while preventing the physical contact of the anode and cathode materials, e.g. short-circuiting. In a liquid cell, this separator would be a porous glass or polymer mesh that allows ion transport via the liquid electrolyte through the pores, but keeps the electrodes from contacting and shorting. However, in a thin film battery the electrolyte is a solid, which conveniently satisfies both the ion transportation and the physical separation requirements without the need for a dedicated separator. ===Current Collector=== Current collectors in thin film batteries must be flexible, have high surface area, and be cost-effective. Silver nanowires with improved surface area and loading weight have been shown to work as a current collector in these battery systems, but still are not as cost-effective as desired. Extending graphite technology to lithium ion batteries, solution processed carbon nanotubes (CNT) films are being looked into for use as both the current collector and anode material. CNTs have the ability to intercalate lithium and maintain high operating voltages, all with low mass loading and flexibility. ==Advantages and Challenges== Thin film lithium ion batteries offer improved performance by having a higher average output voltage, lighter weights thus higher energy density (3x), and longer cycling life (1200 cycles without degradation) and can work in a wider range of temperatures (between -20 and 60 °C)than typical rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. Li-ion transfer cells are the most promising systems for satisfying the demand of high specific energy and high power and would be cheaper to manufacture. In the thin film lithium ion battery, both electrodes are capable of reversible lithium insertion, thus forming a Li-ion transfer cell. In order to construct a thin film battery it is necessary to fabricate all the battery components, as an anode, a solid electrolyte, a cathode and current leads into multi- layered thin films by suitable technologies. In a thin film based system, the electrolyte is normally a solid electrolyte, capable of conforming to the shape of the battery. This is in contrast to classical lithium ion batteries, which normally have liquid electrolyte material. Liquid electrolytes can be challenging to utilize if they are not compatible with the separator. Also liquid electrolytes in general call for an increase in the overall volume of the battery, which is not ideal for designing a system that has high energy density. Additionally, in a thin film flexible Li-ion battery, the electrolyte, which is normally polymer-based, can act as the electrolyte, separator, and binder material. This provides the ability to have flexible systems since the issue of electrolyte leakage is circumvented. Finally, solid systems can be packed together tightly which affords an increase in energy density when compared to classical liquid lithium ion batteries. Separator materials in lithium ion batteries must have the ability to transport ions through their porous membranes while maintaining a physical separation between the anode and cathode materials in order to prevent short-circuiting. Furthermore, the separator must be resistant to degradation during the battery’s operation. In a thin film Li-ion battery, the separator must be a thin and flexible solid. Typically today, this material is a polymer-based material. Since thin film batteries are made of all solid materials, allows one to use simpler separator materials in these systems such as Xerox paper rather than in liquid based Li-ion batteries. ==Scientific Development== Development of thin solid state batteries allows for roll to roll type production of batteries to decrease production costs. Solid-state batteries can also afford increased energy density due to decrease in overall device weight, while the flexible nature allows for novel battery design and easier incorporation into electronics. Development is still required in cathode materials which will resist capacity reduction due to cycling. {  - - ! Prior Technology !! Replacement Technology !!

The majority of these applications are aimed at improving the currently available consumer and medical products. Thin film lithium ion batteries can be used to make thinner portable electronics, because the thickness of the battery required to operate the device can be reduced greatly. These batteries have the ability to be an integral part of implantable medical devices, such as defibrillators and neural stimulators, “smart” cards, radio frequency identification, or RFID, tags and wireless sensors. They can also serve as a way to store energy collected from solar cells or other harvesting devices. Each of these applications is possible because of the flexibility in the size and shape of the batteries. The size of these devices does not have to revolve around the size of the space needed for the battery anymore. The thin film batteries can be attached to the inside of the casing or in some other convenient way. There are many opportunities in which to use this type of batteries. ===Renewable energy storage devices=== The thin film lithium ion battery can serve as a storage device for the energy collected from renewable sources with a variable generation rate, such as a solar cell or wind turbine. These batteries can be made to have a low self discharge rate, which means that these batteries can be stored for long periods of time without a major loss of the energy that was used to charge it. These fully charged batteries could then be used to power some or all of the other potential applications listed below, or provide more reliable power to an electric grid for general use. ===Smart cards=== Smart cards have the same size as a credit card, but they contain a microchip that can be used to access information, give authorization, or process an application. These cards can go through harsh production conditions, with temperatures in the range of 130 to 150 °C, in order to complete the high temperature, high pressure lamination processes. These conditions can cause other batteries to fail because of degassing or degradation of organic components within the battery. Thin film lithium ion batteries have been shown to withstand temperatures of -40 to 150 °C. This use of thin film lithium ion batteries is hopeful for other extreme temperature applications. ===RFID tags=== Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags can be used in many different applications. These tags can be used in packaging, inventory control, used to verify authenticity and even allow or deny access to something. These ID tags can even have other integrated sensors to allow for the physical environment to be monitored, such as temperature or shock during travel or shipping. Also, the distance required to read the information in the tag depends on the strength of the battery. The farther away you want to be able to read the information, the stronger the output will have to be and thus the greater the power supply to accomplish this output. As these tags get more and more complex, the battery requirements will need to keep up. Thin film lithium ion batteries have shown that they can fit into the designs of the tags because of the flexibility of the battery in size and shape and are sufficiently powerful enough to accomplish the goals of the tag. Low cost production methods, like roll to roll lamination, of these batteries may even allow for this kind of RFID technology to be implemented in disposable applications. ===Implantable Medical Devices=== Thin films of LiCoO2 have been synthesized in which the strongest x ray reflection is either weak or missing, indicating a high degree of preferred orientation. Thin film solid state batteries with these textured cathode films can deliver practical capacities at high current densities. For example, for one of the cells 70% of the maximum capacity between 4.2 V and 3 V (approximately 0.2 mAh/cm2) was delivered at a current of 2 mA/cm2. When cycled at rates of 0.1 mA/cm2, the capacity loss was 0.001%/cycle or less. The reliability and performance of Li LiCoO2 thin-film batteries make them attractive for application in implantable devices such as neural stimulators, pacemakers, and defibrillators. Implantable medical devices require batteries that can deliver a steady, reliable power source for as long as possible. These applications call for a battery that has a low self-discharge rate, for when it’s not in use, and a high power rate, for when it needs to be used, especially in the case of an implantable defibrillator. Also, users of the product will want a battery that can go through many cycles, so these devices will not have to be replaced or serviced often. Thin film lithium ion batteries have the ability to meet these requirements. The advancement from a liquid to a solid electrolyte has allowed these batteries to take almost any shape without the worry of leaking, and it has been shown that certain types of thin film rechargeable lithium batteries can last for around 50,000 cycles. Another advantage to these thin film batteries is that they can be arranged in series to give a larger voltage equal to the sum of the individual battery voltages. This fact can be used in reducing the “footprint” of the battery, or the size of the space needed for the battery, in the design of a device. ===Wireless Sensors=== Wireless sensors need to be in use for the duration of their application, whether that may be in package shipping or in the detection of some unwanted compound, or controlling inventory in a warehouse. If the wireless sensor cannot transmit its data due to low or no battery power, the consequences could potentially be severe based on the application. Also, the wireless sensor must be adaptable to each application. Therefore the battery must be able to fit within the designed sensor. This means that the desired battery for these devices must be long-lasting, size specific, low cost, if they are going to be used in disposable technologies, and must meet the requirements of the data collection and transmission processes. Once again, thin film lithium ion batteries have shown the ability to meet all of these requirements. ==See also== * List of battery types * Lithium-ion battery ==References== Category:Rechargeable batteries Category:Lithium-ion batteries Category:Thin films Category:Flexible electronics ","title":"Thin film lithium-ion battery"},{"id":"19236433","text":"Excerpt from the Halleluyah Scriptures, a Sacred Name Bible that uses the Paleo-Hebrew script for some divine names and Yeshayahu for \\"Isaiah\\" Sacred Name Bibles are Bible translations that consistently use Hebraic forms of the God of Israel's personal name, instead of its English language translation, in both the Old and New Testaments. Some Bible versions, such as the Jerusalem Bible, employ the name Yahweh, a transliteration of Hebrew YHWH, in the English text of the Old Testament, where traditional English versions have .Rhodes R. The Complete Guide to Bible Translations: How They Were Developed 2009 p206 \\"Unlike most other translations today, the New Jerusalem Bible renders the Old Testament name for God, YHWH, as \\"Yahweh,\\" just as the Jerusalem Bible did. In place of \\"Lord of hosts\\" is \\"Yahweh Sabaoth\\" Most Sacred Name versions use the name Yahshua, a Semitic form of the name Jesus. None of the Sacred Name Bibles are published by mainstream publishers. Instead, most are published by the same group that produced the translation. Some are available for download on the Web. Very few of these Bibles have been noted or reviewed by scholars outside the Sacred Name Movement. Some Sacred Name Bibles, such as the Hallelujah Scriptures, are also considered Messianic Bibles due to their significant Hebrew style. Therefore they are commonly used by Messianic Jews as well. ==Historical background== YHWH occurs in the Hebrew Bible, and also within the Greek text in a few manuscripts of the Greek translation found at Qumran among the Dead Sea Scrolls. It does not occur in early manuscripts of the Greek New Testament. Although the Greek forms Iao and Iave do occur in magical inscriptions in the Hellenistic Jewish texts of Philo, Josephus and the New Testament use the word Kyrios (\\"Lord\\") when citing verses where YHWH occurs in the Hebrew.Aland, K. Text of the New Testament For centuries, Bible translators around the world did not transliterate or copy the tetragrammaton in their translations. For example, English Bible translators (Christian and Jewish) used to represent it. Modern authorities on Bible translation have called for translating it with a vernacular word or phrase that would be locally meaningful.David Moomo. 2005. Translating YHWH into African languages. Scriptura 88: 151–60.Ernst R. Wendland. 1992. yhwh- The Case For Chauta 'Great-[God]-of-the-Bow'. The Bible Translator. 43.4: 430–438.Helmut Rosin. 1956. The Lord Is God: The Translation of the Divine Names and the Missionary Calling of the Church. Amsterdam: Netherlands Bible Society. The Catholic Church has called for maintaining in the liturgy the tradition of using \\"the Lord\\" to represent the tetragrammaton,\\"In accordance with immemorial tradition which indeed is already evident in the above- mentioned 'Septuagint' version, the name of almighty God, expressed by the sacred Hebrew tetragrammaton (YHWH) and rendered in Latin by the word Dominus, is to be rendered in any vernacular by a word of equivalent meaning.\\" Liturgiam authenticam, fifth instruction on vernacular translation of the Roman liturgy, Issue 5, section 41c. Congregatio de Cultu Divino et Disciplina Sacramentorum. 2001. . but does not forbid its use outside the liturgy, as is shown by the existence of Catholic Bibles such as the Jerusalem Bible (1966) and the New Jerusalem Bible' (1985), where it appears as \\"Yahweh\\", and place names that incorporate the tetragrammaton are not affected.United States Conference of Catholic Bishops: \\"The Name of God in the Liturgy\\" A few Bible translators, with varying theological motivations, have taken a different approach to translating the tetragrammaton. In the 1800s–1900s at least three English translations contained a variation of YHWH.*A Literal Translation of the New Testament, by Herman Heinfetter (1863) *The Epistles of Paul in Modern English, by George Barker Stevens (1898) *St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans, by W. G. Rutherford (1900) Two of these translations comprised only a portion of the New Testament. They did not restore YHWH throughout the body of the New Testament. In the twentieth century, Rotherham's Emphasized Bible was the first to employ full transliteration of the tetragrammaton where it appears in the Bible (i.e., in the Old Testament). Angelo Traina's translation, The New Testament of our Messiah and Saviour Yahshua in 1950 also used it throughout to translate Κύριος, and The Holy Name Bible containing the Holy Name Version of the Old and New Testaments in 1963 was the first to systematically use a Hebrew form for sacred names throughout the Old and New Testament, becoming the first complete Sacred Name Bible. ===Aramaic primacy=== Some translators of Sacred Name Bibles hold to the view that the New Testament, or significant portions of it, were originally written in a Semitic language, Hebrew or Aramaic, from which the Greek text is a translation. This view is colloquially known as \\"Aramaic primacy\\", and is also taken by some academics, such as Matthew Black.Black, Matthew. \\"An Aramaic Approach to the Gospels and Acts\\". Oxford Clarendon 1967.Cross F.L \\"Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church\\". London: Oxford University Press, 1961 Therefore, translators of Sacred Name Bibles consider it appropriate to use Semitic names in their translations of the New Testament, which they regard as intended for use by all people, not just Jews.The Sacred Name 2002: 89ff Although no early manuscripts of the New Testament contain these names, some rabbinical translations of Matthew did use the tetragrammaton in part of the Hebrew New Testament. Sidney Jellicoe in The Septuagint and Modern Study (Oxford, 1968) states that the name YHWH appeared in Greek Old Testament texts written for Jews by Jews, often in the Paleo- Hebrew alphabet to indicate that it was not to be pronounced, or in Aramaic, or using the four Greek letters PIPI (Π Ι Π Ι) that physically imitate the appearance of Hebrew יהוה, YHWH), and that Kyrios was a Christian introduction.Peter M. Head Christology and the Synoptic problem: an argument for Markan priority p161 \\"Jellicoe summarises: LXX texts, written by Jews for Jews, retained the Divine Name in Hebrew Letters (palaeo-Hebrew or \\" Bible scholars and translators such as Eusebius and Jerome (translator of the Latin Vulgate) consulted the Hexapla, but did not attempt to preserve sacred names in Semitic forms. Justin Martyr (second century) argued that YHWH is not a personal name, writing of the \\"namelessness of God\\".Justin Martyr, Hortatory Address, ch. 21 George Lamsa, the translator of The Holy Bible from Ancient Eastern Manuscripts: Containing the Old and New Testaments (1957) believed the New Testament was originally written in a Semitic language, not clearly differentiating between Syriac and Aramaic. However, despite his adherence to a Semitic original of the New Testament, Lamsa translated using the English word \\"Lord\\" instead of a Hebraic form of the divine name. ===Accuracy or popularity=== Sacred Name Bibles are not used frequently within Christianity, or Judaism. Only a few translations replace Jesus with Semitic forms such as Yeshua or Yahshua. Most English Bible translations translate the tetragrammaton with ' where it occurs in the Old Testament rather than use a transliteration into English. This pattern is followed in languages around the world, as translators have translated sacred names without preserving the Hebraic forms, often preferring local names for the creator or highest deity,David Moomo. 2005. Translating YHWH into African languages. Scriptura 88:151–160. conceptualizing accuracy as semantic rather than phonetic. The limited number and popularity of Sacred Name Bible translations suggests that phonetic accuracy is not considered to be of major importance by Bible translators or the public. The translator Joseph Bryant Rotherham lamented not making his work into a Sacred Name Bible by using the more accurate name Yahweh in his translation (pp. 20 – 26), though he also said, \\"I trust that in a popular version like the present my choice will be understood even by those who may be slow to pardon it.\\" (p. xxi). ==Transliterated Sacred Name Bibles== These Bibles systematically transliterate the tetragrammaton (usually as Yahweh) in both the Old and New Testaments, as well as a Semitic form of the name of Jesus such as Yahshua or Yeshua. They consider the names of both God the Father, and God the Son, to be sacred.Sacred Scriptures Bethel Edition Bible.

Throughout the history of the school, Druid Hills was viewed as its \\"arch rival,\\" and, with the closing of Briarcliff in 1987, the remaining students, and all the trophies, and other relics of the history of the school other than the buildings transferred to Druid Hills, where they remain today. The first classes were held in what was known only as \\"B\\" Hall (the front section of the school), and its only students were in the 8th and 9th grades. In the 1961-1962 school year, the school building existed much as it does today, without the temporary buildings. In 1961, playing on the field at the newly constructed Adams Memorial Stadium, Briarcliff won only three football games, but, significantly, defeated Druid Hills 13-0. On June 12, 1962, the first class graduated at commencement exercises held next to the school at Adams Memorial Stadium. The first three \\"honor\\" graduates of Briarcliff, James M. \\"Jim\\" Veazey, Sharon L. Sullivan and James E. \\"Jimmy\\" Massey, spoke respectively of the past, present future of Briarcliff and its students. Veazey was officially identified as the first person to graduate from Briarcliff by the Briarcliff yearbook which is titled \\"The Shield.\\" The school's colors were silver and blue, and its mascot was the Baron. The DeKalb County School System closed Briarcliff at the end of the 1986-1987 school year, due to a population shift. In 1986, when Superintendent Robert Freeman recommended that the school be closed, he projected that in the 1987-1988 school year, there would be only about 500 students enrolled in the whole school, with around 40 students in the 8th grade.White, Gayle, Atlanta Journal 18 July 1986, at A20. At its height, in the mid-1960s, the graduating classes routinely numbered around 500. In August 1987, all former Briarcliff students began attending Druid Hills High School. The DeKalb School of the Arts and Open Campus High School operated in Briarcliff's buildings until 2009, when DSA moved back onto Avondale High School's campus and Open Campus moved to the new county office campus in Stone Mountain, Georgia. Adams Memorial Stadium remains a site for high school games during the football season. In 2006, a major Florida developer, Sembler Co., offered to purchase the along North Druid Hills Road which included the land and buildings on which Briarcliff, Adams Memorial Stadium and Kittredge Elementary School sat, in order to build a large mixed-use development, similar to others in the Atlanta area during the last decade. The Board of Education valued Sembler's offer at more than $60 million, which would be paid in the form of a land-swap and the construction of new buildings for all of the displaced schools.Tagami, Ty, and Torres, Kristina, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, 30 September 2006 The recession in the construction industry beginning in 2008 and local residents' protests ended Sembler's plans.http://www.11alive.com/news/article_news.aspx?storyid=101017 Residents Oppose $100B Project In the first two seasons of MTV's Teen Wolf series, the buildings and property of Briarcliff High School were used in numerous episodes.

Grosbard emigrated to Havana with his family in 1942; they were fleeing the persecution of Jews by the German occupiers of Belgium during World War II. In 1948, they moved to the United States, where he earned Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees from the University of Chicago. He studied then at the Yale School of Drama for one year before joining the United States Army. Grosbard became a naturalized citizen in 1954. Grosbard gravitated towards theatre when he relocated to New York City in the early 1960s. After directing The Days and Nights of BeeBee Fenstermaker off-Broadway, he earned his first Broadway credit with The Subject Was Roses, for which he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play in 1964. That same year he won the Obie Award for Best Direction and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director of a Play for an off-Broadway revival of the Arthur Miller play A View from the Bridge, for which Dustin Hoffman served as stage manager and assistant director. Grosbard's additional Broadway credits include Miller's The Price; David Mamet's American Buffalo, which earned him Tony and Drama Desk Award nominations; Woody Allen's The Floating Light Bulb; and a revival of Paddy Chayefsky's The Tenth Man. In Hollywood, Grosbard worked as an assistant director on Splendor in the Grass, West Side Story, The Hustler, The Miracle Worker, and The Pawnbroker before helming the screen adaptation of The Subject Was Roses on his own. Additional screen credits include Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me? and Straight Time, both with Dustin Hoffman; True Confessions and Falling in Love, both with Robert De Niro; Georgia for which he won the Grand Prix des Amériques at the Montréal World Film Festival; and The Deep End of the Ocean. ===Personal life=== Grosbard was married to actress Rose Gregorio from 1965 to his death.

CJRP was a French-language Canadian radio station located in Quebec City, Quebec. It operated from 1959 to 1994. The station broadcast on 1060 kHz, using a daytime power of 50,000 watts and a nighttime power of 10,000 watts as a class B station, using a directional antenna with different patterns day and night to protect KYW in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. CJRP was originally known as CJLR and went on the air as an independent station owned by Jacques La Roche (hence the call sign) on October 24, 1959. It originally had a power of 5,000 watts full-time and used a single directional pattern at all times. Power was increased to 10,000 watts full-time in 1962. In 1969, the station was bought by Raymond Crépault, who already owned CJMS in Montreal. CJLR's call sign was changed to CJRP (with the \\"RP\\" standing for \\"Radio Provinciale\\") and the station became a part of the Radiomutuel network. In 1977, the station increased its daytime power to 50,000 watts, using a different directional pattern than the one now used only at night. CJRP's Top 40 format was abandoned in favour of oldies mixing news/talk in the early 1980s. On July 29, 1982, a sister station, CHIK-FM, went on the air. On September 30, 1994, it was announced that Telemedia and Radiomutuel would immediately merge their respective AM news/talk network into the new Radiomédia network. In each of the six markets where the two networks competed, the station which had the best signal remained on-air, and the other one was closed. As local rival CHRC had a much better signal (50,000 watts all day), CJRP had to cease its operations on that day. The station's licence was revoked by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on November 2, 1994. ==ReferencesRock Radio Scrapbook airchecks * Jrp Jrp Jrp Category:Radio stations established in 1959 Category:1959 establishments in Quebec Category:1994 disestablishments in Quebec Category:Radio stations disestablished in 1994 JRP ","title":"CJRP"},{"id":"19236636","text":"Ecosystem-based management is an environmental management approach that recognizes the full array of interactions within an ecosystem, including humans, rather than considering single issues, species, or ecosystem services in isolation. It can be applied to studies in the terrestrial and marine environments with challenges being attributed to both. In the marine realm, they are highly challenging to quantify due to highly migratory species as well as rapidly changing environmental and anthropogenic factors that can alter the habitat rather quickly. To be able to manage fisheries efficiently and effectively it has become increasingly more pertinent to understand not only the biological aspects of the species being studied, but also the environmental variables they are experiencing. Population abundance and structure, life history traits, competition with other species, where the stock is in the local food web, tidal fluctuations, salinity patterns and anthropogenic influences are among the variables that must be taken into account to fully understand the implementation of a \\"ecosystem-based management\\" approach. Interest in ecosystem-based management in the marine realm has developed more recently, in response to increasing recognition of the declining state of fisheries and ocean ecosystems. However, due to a lack of a clear definition and the diversity involved with the environment, the implementation has been lagging. Terrestrial ecosystem-based management (often referred to as ecosystem management) came into its own during the conflicts over endangered species protection (particularly the northern spotted owl), land conservation, and water, grazing and timber rights in the western United States in the 1980s and 1990s. ==History== The systemic origins of ecosystem- based management are rooted in the ecosystem management policy applied to the Great Lakes of North America in the late 1970s. The legislation created, the \\"Great Lakes Basin and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978\\", was based on the claim that \\"no park is an island\\", with the purpose to show how strict protection of the area is not the best method for preservation. This type of management system was however an idea that began long before and evolved through the testing and challenging of common ecosystem management practices. Before its complete synthesis, the management system's historical development can be traced back to the 1930s. During this time, the scientific communities who studied ecology realized that current approaches to the management of national parks did not provide effective protection of the species within. In 1932, The Ecological Society of America's Committee for the Study of Plant and Animal Communities recognized that US national parks needed to protect all the ecosystems contained within the park in order to create an inclusive and fully functioning sanctuary, and be prepared to handle natural fluctuations in its ecology. Also the committee explained the importance for interagency cooperation and improved public education, as well as challenged the idea that proper park management would \\"improve\\" nature. These ideas became the foundation of modern ecosystem-based management. As the understanding of how to manage ecosystems shifted, new tenets of the management system were produced. Biologists George Wright and Ben Thompson accounted for the size and boundary limitations of parks and contributed to the re-structuring of how park lines were drawn. They explained how large mammals for example could not be supported within the restricted zones of a national park and in order to protect these animals and their ecosystems a new approach would be needed. Other scientists followed suit, but none were successful in establishing a well-defined ecosystem-based management approach. In 1979, the importance of ecosystem-based management resurfaced in ecology from two biologists: John and Frank Craighead. The Craigheads found that grizzly bears of Yellowstone National Park could not sustain a population if only allowed to live within park boundaries. This reinforced the idea that a broader definition of what defines an ecosystem needed to be created, suggesting that it be based on the biotic requirements of the largest mammal present. The idea of ecosystem-based management began to catch on and projects throughout American National Parks reflected the idea of protecting an ecosystem in its entirety and not based on legal or ecological restrictions as previously used. Jim Agee and Darryll Johnson published a book-length report on managing ecosystems in 1988 explaining the theoretical framework management. While they did not fully embrace ecosystem-based management by still calling for \\"ecologically defined boundaries\\", they stated the importance of \\"clearly stated management goals, interagency cooperation, monitoring of management results, and leadership at the national policy levels\\". Most importantly they demanded the recognition of human influence. It was argued that scientists must keep in mind the \\"complex social context of their work\\" and always be moving towards \\"socially desirable conditions\\". This need to understand the social aspects of scientific management is the fundamental step from ecological management to ecosystem-based management. Although it continues to become recognized, a debate over ecosystem-based management continues. Grumbine (1994) believes, while the approach has evolved, it has not been fully incorporated into management practices because the most effective forms of it have yet to be seen. He articulates that the current ecological climate calls for the most holistic approach of ecological management. This is in part due to the rapid decline in biodiversity and because of the constant state of flux in societal and political views of nature. Conflicts over public interest and understanding of the natural world have created social and political climates that require interagency cooperation, which stands as a backbone for ecosystem-based management. ==Implementation== Because ecosystem-based management is applied to large, diverse areas encompassing an array of interactions between species, ecosystem components, and humans, it is often perceived as a complex process that is difficult to implement. Slocombe (1998b) also noted that in addition, uncertainty is common and predictions are difficult. However, in light of significant ecosystem degradation, there is a need for a holistic approach that combines environmental knowledge and co-ordination with governing agencies to initiate, sustain and enforce habitat and species protection, and include public education and involvement. As a result, ecosystem-based management will likely be increasingly used in the future as a form of environmental management. Some suggestions for implementing ecosystem-based management and what the process may involve are as follows: ===Goals and objectives=== Defining clear and concise goals for ecosystem-based management is one of the most important steps in effective ecosystem-based management implementation. Goals must move beyond science-based or science-defined objectives to include social, cultural, economic and environmental importance. Of equal importance is to make sure that the community and stake-holders are involved throughout the entire process. Slocombe (1998a) also stated that a single, end-all goal cannot be the solution, but instead a combination of goals and their relationships with each other should be the focus. As discussed by Slocombe (1998a), goals should be broadly applicable, measurable and readily observable, and ideally be collectively supported in order to be achievable. The idea is to provide direction for both thinking and action and should try to minimize managing ecosystems in a static state. Goals should also be flexible enough to incorporate a measure of uncertainty and be able to evolve as conditions and knowledge change. This may involve focusing on specific threatening processes, such as habitat loss or introduced invasive species, occurring within an ecosystem. Overall the goals should be integrative, to include the structure, organization and processes of the management of an area. Correct ecosystem-based management should be based in goals that are both \\"substantive\\", to explain the aims and importance of protecting an area, and \\"procedural\\", to explain how substantive goals will be met. As described by Tallis et al. (2010), some steps of ecosystem-based management may include: ;Scoping This step involves the acquisition of data and knowledge from various sources in order to provide a thorough understanding of critical ecosystem components. Sources may include literature, informal sources such as aboriginal residents, resource users, and/or environmental experts. Data may also be gained through statistical analyses, simulation models, or conceptual models. ;Defining indicators Ecological indicators are useful for tracking or monitoring an ecosystem's status and can provide feedback on management progress as stressed by Slocombe (1998a). Examples may include the population size of a species or the levels of toxin present in a body of water. Social indicators may also be used such as the number or types of jobs within the environmental sector or the livelihood of specific social groups such as indigenous peoples. ;Setting thresholds Tallis et al. (2010) suggest setting thresholds for each indicator and setting targets that would represent a desired level of health for the ecosystem. Examples may include species composition within an ecosystem or the state of habitat conditions based on local observations or stakeholder interviews. Thresholds can be used to help guide management, particularly for a species by looking at the conservation status criteria established by either state or federal agencies and using models such as the minimum viable population size. ;Risk analysis A range of threats and disturbances, both natural and human, often can affect indicators. Risk is defined as the sensitivity of an indicator to an ecological disturbance. Several models can be used to assess risk such as population viability analysis. ;Monitoring Evaluating the effectiveness of the implemented management strategies is very important in determining how management actions are affecting the ecosystem indicators. Evaluation: This final step involves monitoring and assessing data to see how well the management strategies chosen are performing relative to the initial objectives stated. The use of simulation models or multi- stakeholder groups can help to assess management. It is important to note that many of these steps for implementing ecosystem-based management are limited by the governance in place for a region, the data available for assessing ecosystem status and reflecting on the changes occurring, and the time frame in which to operate. ==Challenges== Because ecosystems differ greatly and express varying degrees of vulnerability, it is difficult to apply a functional framework that can be universally applied. These outlined steps or components of ecosystem-based management can, for the most part, be applied to multiple situations and are only suggestions for improving or guiding the challenges involved with managing complex issues. Because of the greater amount of influences, impacts, and interactions to account for, problems, obstacles and criticism often arise within ecosystem-based management. There is also a need for more data, spatially and temporally to help management make sound decisions for the sustainability of the stock being studied. The first commonly defined challenge is the need for meaningful and appropriate management units. Slocombe (1998b) noted that these units must be broad and contain value for people in and outside of the protected area. For example, Aberley (1993) suggests the use of \\"bioregions\\" as management units, which can allow peoples involvement with that region to come through. To define management units as inclusive regions rather that exclusive ecological zones would prevent further limitations created by narrow or restricting political and economic policy created from the units. Slocombe (1998b) suggests that better management units should be flexible and build from existing units and that the biggest challenge is creating truly effect units for managers to compare against. Another issue is in the creation of administrative bodies. They should operate as the essence of ecosystem-based management, working together towards mutually agreed upon goals. Gaps in administration or research, competing objectives or priorities between management agencies and governments due to overlapping jurisdictions, or obscure goals such as sustainability, ecosystem integrity, or biodiversity can often result in fragmented or weak management. In addition, Tallis (2010) stated that limited knowledge of ecosystem components and function and time constraints that can often limit objectives to only those that can be addressed in the short-term. The most challenging issue facing ecosystem-based management is that there exists little knowledge about the system and its effectiveness. Slocombe (1998b) stated that with limited resources available on how to implement the system it is hard to find support for its use. Slocombe (1998a) said that criticism of ecosystem-based management include its reliance on analogy and comparisons, too broadly applied frameworks, its overlap with or duplication of other methods such as ecosystem management, environmental management, or integrated ecosystem assessment, its vagueness in concepts and application, and its tendency to ignore historical, evolutionary or individual factors that may heavily influence ecosystem functioning. Tallis (2010) stated that ecosystem-based management is seen as a critical planning and management framework for conserving or restoring ecosystems though it is still not widely implemented. An ecosystem approach addresses many relationships across spatial, biological, and organizational scales and is a goal-driven approach to restoring and sustaining ecosystems and functions. In addition, ecosystem- based management involves community influence as well as planning and management from local, regional and national government bodies and management agencies. All must be in collaboration in order to develop a desired future of ecosystem conditions, particularly where ecosystems have undergone radical degradation and change. Slocombe (1998b) said that to move forward, ecosystem- based management should be approached through adaptive management, allowing flexibility and inclusiveness to deal with constant environmental, societal, and political change. ==Marine systems== Ecosystem-based management of marine environments has begun to move away from the traditional strategies which focus on conservation of single species or single sectors in favor of an integrated approach which considers all key activities, particularly anthropogenic, that affect marine environments. Management must take into account the life history of the fish being studied, its association with the surrounding environment, its place in the food web, where it prefers to reside in the water column, and how it is affected by human pressures. The objective is to ensure sustainable ecosystems, thus protecting the resources and services they provide for future generations. In recent years there has been increasing recognition of anthropogenic disruption to marine ecosystems resulting from climate change, overfishing, nutrient and chemical pollution from land runoff, coastal development, bycatch, and habitat destruction. The effect of human activity on marine ecosystems has become an important issue because many of the benefits provided to humans by marine ecosystems are declining. These services include the provision of food, fuel, mineral resources, pharmaceuticals, as well as opportunities for recreation, trade, research and education. Guerry (2005) has identified an urgent need to improve the management of these declining ecosystems, particularly in coastal areas, to ensure sustainability. Human communities depend on marine ecosystems for important resources, but without holistic management, these ecosystems are likely to collapse. Olsson et al. (2008) suggest that the degradation of marine ecosystems is largely the result of poor governance and that new approaches to management are required. The Pew Oceans Commission and the United States Commission on Ocean Policy have indicated the importance of moving from current piecemeal management to a more integrated ecosystem-based approach. ===Stock Assessment=== Dead salmon in spawning season Stock assessment is a critically important aspect of fisheries management, but it is a highly complex, logistically difficult, and expensive process and can thus be a contentious issue, particularly when competing parties disagree on the findings of an assessment. Accurate stock assessments require knowledge of reproductive and morphological patterns, age-at-stage progressions, and movement ecology. ===Bottom up or top down=== Post-dip pose All members of an ecosystem are affected by other organisms within that ecosystem, and proper management of wildlife requires knowledge of an organism's trophic level and its effects on other organisms within its food web. Top-down and bottom-up controls represent one method by which the numbers of wild populations of plants and animals are limited. Top-down controls have been seen in the decline of North Sea puffins as a result of overexploitation of sand eels, an important prey item, or in the explosion of sea urchins and subsequent decline in kelp beds due to the near-extirpation of sea otters. As otters were hunted nearly to extinction, sea urchins - which feed on the kelp - boomed, resulting in the near-disappearance of kelp beds. Bottom-up controls are best illustrated when autotrophic primary producers such as plants and phytoplankton, which represent the lowest trophic level of an ecosystem, are limited, impacting all organisms in higher trophic levels. ===Bycatch=== Red snapper is a species of enormous economic importance in the Gulf of Mexico. Management of this species is complicated by the large impact of bycatch associated with the shrimping industry. Rates of red snapper mortality are not explained by fishery landings, but are instead associated with large numbers of juvenile red snapper caught as bycatch in the fine mesh used by trawlers. ===Key elements=== Connections At its core, ecosystem-based management is about acknowledging interdependency connections, including the linkages between marine ecosystems and human societies, economies and institutional systems, as well as those among various species within an ecosystem and among ocean places that are linked by the movement of species, materials, and ocean currents. Of particular importance is how these factors all react and involve each other. In the Caribbean, the spiny lobster is managed based on a classic population model that for most fishery species works quite well. However, this species will grow and then halt its growth when it need to molt its shell and thus instead of a continuous growth cycle, it will pause its growth and invest its energy in a new shell. To further complicate matters, it slows this process down as it gets older to invest more energy into reproduction thus further deviating itself from the von Bertalanffy model of growth that was applied to it. The more information we can gather about an ecosystem and all of the interconnected factors which affect it, the more capable we will be of better managing that system. Cumulative impacts Ecosystem-based management focuses on how individual actions affect the ecosystem services that flow from coupled socio-ecological systems in an integrated fashion, rather than considering these impacts in a piecemeal manner. Loss of biodiversity in marine ecosystems is an example of how cumulative effects from different sectors can impact on an ecosystem in a compounding way. Overfishing, coastal development, filling and dredging, mining and other human activities all contribute to the loss of biodiversity and therefore degradation of the ecosystem. Work is needed prior to the carrying out of the research to understand the total effects that each species can have on each other and also on the environment. It must be carried out every year as well as species are changing their life history traits and their relationship with the environment as humans are continually modifying the environment. Interactions between sectors The only way to deal with the cumulative effects of human influences on marine ecosystems is for various contributing sectors to set common goals for the protection or management of ecosystems. While some policies may only affect a single sector, others may affect multiple sectors. A policy for the protection of endangered marine species, for example, could affect recreational and commercial fisheries, mining, shipping and tourism sectors to name a few. More effective ecosystem management would result from the collective adoption of policies by all sectors, rather than each sector creating their own isolated policies. For example, in the Gulf of Mexico there are oil rigs, recreational fisheries, commercial fisheries and multiple tourist attractions. One of the main fisheries is that of the Red Snapper which inhabits much of the Gulf and employs thousands of people in the commercial and recreational fishery. During the Deepwater oil spill it became abundantly obvious that it negatively affected the population numbers as well as the integrity of the catch that was being made. The species not only suffered higher mortality rates but the market was less trusting of the product. An environmental disaster interacted with the commercial, recreational, and economic sector for a specific species. Changing public perceptions Not all members of the public will be properly informed, or be fully aware, of current threats to marine ecosystems and it is therefore important to change public perceptions by informing people about these issues. It is important to consider the interest of the public when making decisions about ocean management and not just those who have a material interest because community support is needed by management agencies in order to make decisions. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) faced the issue of poor public awareness in their proposed management strategy which included no-take fishing zones. Olssen (2008) addressed this problem by starting a 'reef under pressure' information campaign to prove to the public that the Great Barrier Reef is under threat from human disturbances, and in doing so were successful in gaining public support. Bridging science and policy To ensure that all key players are on the same page, it is important to have communication between managers, resource users, scientists, government bodies and other stakeholders. Leslie and McLeod (2007) stated that proper engagement between these groups will enable the development of management initiatives that are realistic and enforceable as well as effective for ecosystem management. If certain small-scale players are not involved or informed, it is highly unlikely and equally challenging to get them to cooperate as well as to follow the rules that need to be put in place. It is of the utmost importance to have every stakeholder involved with every step of the process to increase the cohesion of the process. Embracing change Coupled social-ecological systems are constantly changing in ways that cannot be fully predicted or controlled. Understanding the resilience of ecosystems, i.e. the extent to which they can maintain structure, function, and identity in the face of disturbance, can enable better prediction of how ecosystems will respond to both natural and anthropogenic perturbations, and to changes in environmental management. With how much modification humans are doing to environments, it is important to understand these changes on a yearly basis as well. Some species are changing their life histories, Flounder, due to the increased pressures that humans are placing on the environment. Thus, when a manager or government does an assessment on the ecosystem for a given year, the relationship that a species has to others can change very quickly and thus negate the model that you use for an ecosystem very quickly if not redefined. Multiple objectives Ecosystem-based management focuses on the diverse benefits provided by marine systems, rather than on single ecosystem services. Such benefits or services include vibrant commercial and recreational fisheries, biodiversity conservation, renewable energy from wind or waves and coastal protection. The goal is to provide a sustainable fisheries while incorporating the impacts of other aspects on that resource. When managed correctly, an ecosystem-based model can greatly improve not only the resource being managed, but those associated with it. Learning and adaptation Because of the lack of control and predictability of coupled social-ecological systems, an adaptive management approach is recommended. There can be multiple different factors that must be overcome (fisheries, pollution, borders, multiple agencies, etc.) to create a positive outcome. Managers must be able to react and adapt as to limit the variance associated with the outcome. ==Other examples Great Bear Rainforest - Canada === The Land and Resource Management Planning (LRMP) was implemented by the British Columbia Government (Canada) in the mid-1990s in the Great Bear Rainforest in order to establish a multiparty land-use planning system. The aim was to \\"maintain the ecological integrity of terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems and achieve high levels of human well-being\\". The steps described in the programme included: protect old-growth forests, maintain forest structure at the stand level, protect threatened and endangered species and ecosystems, protect wetlands and apply adaptive management. MacKinnon (2008) highlighted that the main limitation of this program was the social and economic aspects related to the lack of orientation to improve human well- being. === The Great Lakes - Canada and United States === A Remedial Action Plan (RAP) was created during the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement that implemented ecosystem-based management. The transition, according to the authors, from \\"a narrow to a broader approach \\" was not easy because it required the cooperation of both the Canadian and American governments. This meant different cultural, political and regulatory perspectives were involved with regards to the lakes. Hartig et al. (1998) described eight principles required to make the implementation of ecosystem-based management efficacious: \\"broad-based stakeholder involvement; commitment of top leaders; agreement on information needs and interpretation; action planning within a strategic framework; human resource development; results and indicators to measure progress; systematic review and feedback; and stakeholder satisfaction\\". === Scallop aquaculture in Sechura Bay, Peru === Peruvian Bay Scallop is grown in the benthic environment. Intensity of the fishery has caused concern over recent years and there has been a shift to more of an environmental management scheme. They are now using food web models to assess the current situation and to calibrate the stocking levels that are needed. The impacts of the scallops on the ecosystem and on other species are now being taken into account as to limit phytoplankton blooms, overstocking, diseases and overconsumption in a given year. This study is proposed to help guide both fisherman and managers in their goal of providing long term success for the fishery as well as the ecosystem they are utilizing. ===Dam removal in the Pacific Northwest=== The Elwha dam removal in Washington state is the largest dam removal project in the United States. Not only was it blocking several species of salmon from reaching their natural habitat, it also had millions of tons of sediment built up behind it. ==See also== * Deep ecology * Ecosystem management * Ecosystem based fisheries * Sustainable forest management * Sustainable land management * Ecosystem health * Marine Ecology ==Notes * Adaptive Management * Advancing EBM Toolkit * EBM Tools Network * Ecosystem Management Initiative * Resilience * What is marine EBM?

He was a grandson of Kentucky Governor James Garrard and cousin of Israel Garrard, Jeptha Garrard, and Kenner Garrard. Garrard attended Centre College in Danville, Kentucky.Garrard, p. 102 On March 26, 1832, Garrard married Nancy Brawner, who died on March 31, just five days after their wedding. He then married Lucinda \\"Lucy\\" Burnham Lees on March 9, 1849; together they had eleven children, six boys and five girls. Garrard ran for office in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1841 and 1842, but was defeated both times. He ran again in 1843, beating his opponent General Elijah Combs. He was reelected in 1844 with no opposition. During the Mexican-American War he served as a captain of Company E, 16th U.S. Infantry, from March 5, 1847 until August 5, 1849, but never saw combat. Four companies, Garrard's included, were stationed at Cerralvo, Mexico on the Rio Grande, with the remaining six companies at Monterrey. Garrard stated, \\"I think the 8 months I stayed there were the most pleasant part of my life. The Mexicans were fond of us. We had no trouble with them. The climate was pleasant and everything went well.\\" Garrard left Kentucky in 1849 to seek his fortune in the California Gold Rush, but returned to Kentucky in 1850, not having found a fortune. He won a seat in the Kentucky Senate in 1857 and resigned in 1859 to run for the United States Congress, but was defeated by Green Adams. He was elected again to the Kentucky Senate on August 4, 1861, but declined to serve as he had received his commission as colonel July 27, 1861. Although a staunch Unionist, Garrard was a slave owner. The 1840 U.S. Census shows that he owned 11 slaves. By 1860, his total worth was $20,000 (over $694,000 in 2007 dollars), and he owned nine slaves thus making him the sixth wealthiest citizen of Clay County. ==Civil War== At the outbreak of the Civil War Garrard was authorized to raise a regiment of infantry. He personally recruited eight companies: two from Clay County, two from Laurel County, two from Knox County, and two from Whitley County. Garrard was appointed colonel of the 7th Kentucky Infantry on September 22, 1861. He commanded the 7th Kentucky Infantry at the Battle of Camp Wildcat, during the Cumberland Gap Campaign, and a detachment of men at the Battle of Perryville from the 7th Kentucky, 32nd Kentucky Infantry, and 3rd Tennessee Infantry who had escaped the Battle of Richmond. Garrard remained with the 7th Kentucky until winter 1862 when he was assigned to the staff of Brigadier General Samuel P. Carter. Garrard was promoted to brigadier general to date from November 29, 1862, and ordered to report to Major General Benjamin M. Prentiss at Helena, Arkansas. While at Milliken's Bend, Louisiana, near the end of March 1863, Garrard lost central vision in his left eye. His attending surgeon suggested that he had some \\"obscure disease\\" behind the eye and advised Garrard to see another physician. Garrard reported to the Union Army medical director at Cincinnati in July 1863. The surgeon there determined he had a rupture within the eye and that it was incurable. Garrard remained at Cincinnati until leaving for Memphis on September 12, 1863.Welch, p. 127. Garrard was assigned command of the District of Somerset, which included four other nearby towns, August 1863-January 17, 1864; this command was broken into the Subdistrict of Somerset, which he also commanded November 6-December 1863. On January 17, 1864, he was placed in command of the District of the Clinch, a mixed brigade of infantry and cavalry, posted at Cumberland Gap. His primary responsibilities included supervision of the construction of military roads within his jurisdiction. Garrard was honorably mustered out of the service on April 4, 1864 due to his vision issues. He returned to his home in Clay County, where he farmed and operated the salt works. Pension records indicate that he had lost complete sight in his left eye and nearly all in his right eye. ==Later life== Garrard spent the remainder of his life in Clay County farming and operating the Union Salt Works, which he rebuilt after they were burned by Union soldiers during the war to prevent their use by Confederate forces. He died on March 15, 1902 in the same home in which he was born. Garrard is buried in the family cemetery at Garrard, Kentucky. ==Honors== The Brigadier General Theophilus T.

It is located near the Cliff House restaurant, perched on the headlands on the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach. The Camera and restaurant are currently owned by the National Park Service and are within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. The Camera Obscura was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 and is within the NPS Sutro Historic District.NPS- GGNRA: Sutro Historic District It is within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, since being acquired by the National Park Service in 1977.National Park Service: The History and Significance of the Adolph Sutro Historic District ==History== Cameras obscura, devices which project an image of the surroundings onto a surface using only existing exterior light sources, usually sunlight, have a long history in San Francisco. The first recorded reference to one in the city is from the 1860s in an attraction called Woodward's Gardens. A previous incarnation of the Cliff House was noted to have had a camera obscura on its fourth floor in 1896. This camera obscura was destroyed when the restaurant burned down in 1907. When the third Cliff House reopened in 1937, the owner was approached by businessman Floyd Jennings with the idea of adding a camera obscura to the cliffs beside the restaurant. It was installed on the site in 1946 and has been in continuous operation since then. ==Technology== The San Francisco Camera Obscura projects an image onto a horizontal viewing table via a reflected image from a viewpoint at the top of the building. A metal hood in the cupola at the top of the building slowly rotates, making a full revolution in about six minutes, allowing for a 360° view around the building. Light enters the building via an angled mirror in the metal hood. It then passed through a lens with a 150 in. (381 cm) focal length and is projected onto a parabolic white \\"table\\" in a black room. The origin of the lens is uncertain but it appears to have been part of a telescope, likely manufactured by the Clark Lens Company of Cambridge, Massachusetts. ==Preservation== The Camera Obscura was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 for its engineering significance. While the exterior of the building was extensively modified in 1957 to appear as a giant camera, the internal workings of the camera obscura, the basis of its placement on the Register, have remained unchanged since its erection in 1946. The 1957 external architecture was eligible to be evaluated for historical significance upon reaching fifty years of age in 2007. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in San Francisco, California *Sutro Historic District ==ReferencesSan Francisco Category:Golden Gate National Recreation Area Category:Buildings and structures in San Francisco Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in San Francisco Category:Richmond District, San Francisco Category:Tourist attractions in San Francisco ","title":"Camera Obscura (San Francisco, California)"},{"id":"19236782","text":"Harbor Lights Lake is a reservoir in Suamico, Wisconsin, Brown County, Wisconsin, United States.

Gaskill. It is the first film to be produced by Gardner's production company, The Helen Gardner Picture Players. The film was based on an 1890 play written by Victorien Sardou. Cleopatra is one of the first six-reel feature films produced in the United States. Promoted with the tagline \\"The most beautiful motion picture ever made\\", the film was the first to offer a feature-length depiction of Cleopatra, although there had been a short film about Antony and Cleopatra earlier. ==Synopsis== In a series of elaborately staged tableaux, it depicts Cleopatra and her love affairs, first with handsome fisherman-slave Pharon, then with Mark Antony. ==Cast== *Helen Gardner as Cleopatra - Queen of Egypt * Mr. Howard as Pharon - A Greek slave and fisherman * Charles Sindelar as Mark Antony - Triumvir and General * James R. Waite as Venditius - A Roman soldier * Mr. Osborne as Diomedes - A rich Egyptian *Harry Knowles as Kephren - Captain of the Guards to the Queen * Mr. Paul as Octavius - A Triumvir and General * Mr. Brady as Serapian - An Egyptian priest * Mr. Corker as Ixias - Servant to Ventidius * Pearl Sindelar as Iras - An attendant * Miss Fielding as Charmian - An attendant * Miss Robson as Octavia - Wife of Antony * Helene Costello as Nicola - Child ==Production notes== Cleopatra was the first film produced by Helen Gardner's production company, The Helen Gardner Picture Players, located in Tappan, New York. Gardner created the company in 1910 after finding success in a series of Vitagraph shorts in the early 1900s. The film's budget was $45,000 (approximately $ today) and featured lavish sets and costumes (Gardner also served as the film's costume designer and editor). Gardner used the natural scenery in Tappan for outdoor shots in addition to sets. ==Releases== Upon its release, Cleopatra played in opera houses and theatres. The film was also featured in a theatrical roadshow accompanied by a publicist, manager and a lecturer/projectionist. In 1918, Gardner filmed additional scenes and re-issued the film to compete with the 1917 adaptation released by Fox and starring Theda Bara. ==Reception== Film critic Dennis Schwartz described it as \\"energetic\\" while giving it a B- rating.http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/cleopatra1912.htm The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2002: AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions – Nominated ==Censorship== Like many American films of the time, Cleopatra was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. For the 1918 release, the Chicago Board of Censors required a cut of the two intertitles \\"If I let you live and love me ten days, will you then destroy yourself?\\" and \\"Suppose Anthony were told that she had just left the embraces of the slave Pharon\\". ==Status and restorations== The 1912 version of Cleopatra still exists in its entirety. In 2000, Turner Classic Movies had the print restored, using an earlier 1960s restoration, and commissioned a new musical score from the husband and wife team of Chantal Kreviazuk and Raine Maida. The restored version, complete with color tinting, first aired on TCM in August 2000. ==References* *Cleopatra at silentera.com * Category:1910s historical drama films Category:1912 films Category:American films Category:American historical drama films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Depictions of Cleopatra on film Category:Depictions of Mark Antony on film Category:American films based on plays Category:Films based on works by Victorien Sardou Category:Films set in ancient Egypt Category:Films set in the 1st century BC Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:American independent films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:1910s independent films Category:1912 drama films ","title":"Cleopatra (1912 film)"},{"id":"19236858","text":"Walter Clarence \\"Tillie\\" Voss (March 28, 1897 – December 14, 1975) was an American football tackle who played nine seasons in the National Football League (NFL).

This agreement acknowledged that \\"the Ha'wiih (Hereditary Chiefs) of the First Nations have the responsibility to conserve and protect their traditional territories and waters for generations which will follow\\". The IMA was a negotiated agreement between the Central Region Chiefs (CRC) and the Province of British Columbia to define the terms of co-management of land and resource use and operations during treaty negotiations. The IMA was extended twice in April 1996 and March 2000 to become the Interim Measures Extension Agreement: A Bridge to Treaty dated on March 28, 2000. As of April 2008 the IMEA has been re-extended for one further year with funds provided to support the Central Region functions and administration and the Central Region Board (CRB). The CRB was dismantled in 2009. == Roles and Responsibilities == The role of the CRB was to deal with all aspects of resource management and land use planning in the Clayoquot Sound region. The CRB was a final stop for reviewing projects and plans that pertain to any of the Central Region First Nation territories. The CRB was responsible for reviewing and providing recommendations on all proposed development plans relating to Clayoquot Sound. The primary functions of the CRB was to: * Provide advice to the Parties, including the Province of British Columbia and the Ha'wiih (Hereditary Chiefs) of the Central Region First Nations (Tla-o-qui-aht, Ahousaht, Hesquiaht, Toquaht, and Ucluelet First Nations) on planning processes and strategic initiatives affecting resource management and land use planning; * Participate in the development of a regional economic development strategy; * Review plans related to the alienation, conservation and protection of land, water or marine resources; * Monitor the activities of the Clayoquot Sound Planning Process, which implements the Scientific Panel recommendations and other resource and land use planning initiatives agreed to by the Parties (CRB, 2008b); * Initiate new work where necessary; * Monitor the fiduciary obligations of the Crown; * Hear public concerns on resource management and land-use planning, and make recommendations to the Parties; * Carry out planning tasks or projects as directed by the Parties; and * Develop an annual operational plan for review and approval by the Parties. When reviewing and making recommendations on resource and land use plans, the CRB consulted with local communities at the direction of either the CRC or the Provincial Government. The NTC did not have any formal relationships or direct dealings (e.g., through joint meetings or strategic planning sessions) with the NEDC, CRB or CRMB, but all of these bodies served the Central Region First Nations. == Structure == The CRB linked the Central Region First Nations, the Provincial Government and local communities in \\"a joint management process for resource management and land use planning\\" (CRB, 2008c). The Central Region Chiefs did not control the CRB but had representatives that sit on the Board. Administratively, the CRB consisted of five First Nations representatives (one from each Nation), five non-Native representatives appointed by the Province of British Columbia, and two co-chairs — one First Nation and one provincially appointed. The CRB reported to the Central Region Chiefs through the First Nations Co-Chief and the CRC Executive Director. The Executive Director, who was currently Jackie Godfrey, is the \\"face\\" of the CRC. The non-First Nations representatives reported to the province through the provincially appointed Co-Chair. == Administration == The CRB maintained an office in the Central Region Chiefs Administrative Building on the Itatsoo Reserve. The Director of the Secretariat was Peter Ayres. ==External links== *CRB website == References == Ecotrust Canada.

He describes his home as a world without language (\\"sprachlose Welt\\") and early on felt drawn to language as a mode of self-expression. He grew up in the context of a difficult triangle – a rather rough father, by whom he felt rejected; a mother who lost her own brothers early on and fell silent; and a deaf-mute farmgirl. When his mother explained that there was no money for books, Winkler soon recognized the (intellectual) class difference between the sons of farmers and teachers. There was an early obsession to acquire books – and thus language. Following completion of the eight-year rural Austrian primary school, Winkler attended the three-year commercial school in Villach. After a clerical position at a dairy, he went to an evening school to obtain his high school diploma, concurrently working at a publishing house producing books by the widely admired German author of novels on American \\"Indians,\\" Karl May. From 1973 and 1982, he was employed in the administration of Klagenfurt University, the Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt. At that time, he organized a literary circle, the Literarischer Arbeitskreis, together with his Carinthian author colleague Alois Brandstetter and edited a literary magazine, the Schreibarbeiten. In 1979 his novel Menschenkind earned him the second place in the renowned Ingeborg-Bachmann-Preis behind Gert Hofmann. Together with his subsequent two novels, Der Ackermann aus Kärnten and Muttersprache, this book makes up the trilogy Das wilde Kärnten. Josef Winkler’s texts are dominated by the themes of death and homosexuality. His renditions of problems individuals encounter in a patriarchal Catholic world have a self-acknowledged autobiographical background. Winkler relates his own work to that of other German-language and international writers with a focus on suicide, isolation and homosexuality such as Jean Genet, Peter Handke and Hans Henny Jahnn. Winkler’s numerous trips to both Italy and India are frequently reflected in his works, including Indian death rituals as practiced in the city of Varanasi which are contrasted with Catholic rituals in his home culture. His early work Wortschatz der Nacht was published in February 2013. His most recent work, Winnetou, Abel und ich (2014), featuring his early acquaintance with Karl May, includes both an important chapter of his literary autobiography and re- tellings of May’s fantastical stories surrounding Winnetoo, an imaginary Indian chief widely known in Central European culture. On the occasion of the 33rd Ingeborg-Bachmann-Preis 2009, Josef Winkler held the traditional „Klagenfurter Rede zur Literatur.“ This speech generated significant controversy as it vehemently criticized the governments of Carinthia and its capital city Klagenfurt for failing to establish a city library. While much money was expended for mismanaged banks and 70 Million Euros were spent on a soccer stadium in Klagenfurt (Wörthersee Stadion), authorities claimed that they lack the resources for a municipal library. Josef Winkler is member of two associations of Austrian authors, the Grazer Autorenversammlung and the Interessengemeinschaft österreichischer Autorinnen und Autoren. In October 2010 he was nominated member of the Österreichischen Kunstsenat, the Austrian Art Senate, whose president he now is. Winkler is married and has one son and one daughter. He lives with his family in Klagenfurt. == Works == Josef Winkler (Vienna 2013) * Menschenkind, Suhrkamp, 1979 * Der Ackermann aus Kärnten, Suhrkamp, 1980 * Muttersprache, Suhrkamp, 1982 * Die Verschleppung, Suhrkamp, 1983 * Der Leibeigene, Suhrkamp, 1987 (Engl.

Graham Brown) was a Scottish mountaineer and physiologist. ==Life and academic work== Graham Brown was born in Edinburgh on 27 March 1882. His father, Dr John Joseph Graham BrownW. J. O'Connor, British Physiologists 1885–1914: A Biographical Dictionary, Manchester University Press, 1991, p. 366. was a President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh from 1912 to 1914. His mother was Jane Pasley Hay Thorburn. The family lived at 63 Castle Street in Edinburgh's New Town.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1882–83 Thomas studied science and medicine at the University of Edinburgh, gaining an MD in 1912 with a thesis on the rhythmic movement of decerebrate animals, followed in 1914 with a DSc from the same institution for a thesis on immediate and successive effects of compound stimulation in spinal preparations, before moving to Glasgow and Liverpool. Although his work was largely ignored for many years, he was the first to propose a half-centre model of motor neurons in which two groups of spinal neurons that are both reciprocally organized and mutually inhibiting are capable of producing basic rhythmic movement. His theory reflects today's widely accepted concept of central pattern generators in motor neurons. However, at the time, his views opposed those of his mentor, Sir Charles Scott Sherrington, who believed that the locomotor movements observed in decerebrate animals were caused by a chain of reflexes initiated by proprioception feedback. By contrast, Brown's research demonstrated that in the absence of cutaneous and proprioceptive signals, deafferented animals were still capable of generating alternating muscular rhythms. Unknown to him, his proprietary work was ahead of his time, only making waves in the field of motor control fifty years after it was originally published, when Lundberg and Jankowska's study in the 1960s supported his half-centre model. Brown went on to serve in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the First World War. After the war, he continued his work on the physiology of the nervous system, particularly reflex movements and posture,Obituary of Graham Brown at jstor.org Accessed on 8 September 2008 and in 1920 he accepted the Chair in Physiology at the University of Wales at Cardiff.Portrait of Brown at the Gazetteer for Scotland Accessed on 8 September 2008 In 1927 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

The law of unjust enrichment deals with circumstances in which one person is required to make restitution of a benefit acquired at the expense of another in circumstances which are unjust. The modern law of unjust enrichment encompasses what was once known as the law of quasi-contract. Its precise scope remains a matter of controversy.See generally, Virgo, Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015); Burrows, Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2011); Mitchell, Mitchell, Watterson, Goff & Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment (8th ed, 2011); Edelman and Degeling, Equity in Commercial Law (LexisNexis, 2005). Beyond quasi-contract, it is sometimes said to encompass the law relating to subrogation, contribution, recoupment, and claims to the traceable substitutes of misapplied property. English courts have recognised that there are four steps required to establish a claim in unjust enrichment. If the following elements are satisfied, a claimant has a prima facie right to restitution: # the defendant has been enriched; # this enrichment is at the claimant's expense; # this enrichment at the claimant's expense is unjust; and # there is no applicable bar or defence. The law of unjust enrichment is among the most unsettled areas of English law. Its existence as a separate body of law was only explicitly recognised in 1991 in Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd.. While the law has rapidly developed over the last two decades, controversy continues over the precise structure, scope and nature of the law of unjust enrichment. ==Background History === The notion of an obligation to make restitution of benefits received at another's expense can be traced back to Roman law.See, e.g., Theophilus, Paraphrase 3.27.3, 5; Gaius, Institutes Its history in English law can be traced to the form of action known as indebitatus assumpsit. From this action came the 'common money counts'. Of present relevance are the following: * an action for money had and received to the plaintiff's use; * an action for money paid to the defendant's use; * quantum meruit (that is, a claim for reasonable remuneration for services provided by the plaintiff to the defendant); and * quantum valebat (that is, a claim for the reasonable value of goods provided by the plaintiff to the defendant). During the course of the 18th and 19th centuries the law of contract, the law of tort and the law of trusts emerged as discrete bodies of law within English private law. As many thought they covered the field, restitutionary claims as embodied in the common money counts were appended to the law of contract. The various claims were termed 'quasi-contractual'. This was because it was often necessary to plead that the defendant had promised to repay a debt, even though the promise was fictitious and the debt was imposed by the law. As recently as 1951 the House of Lords held that: \\"My Lords, the exact status of the law of unjust enrichment is not yet assured. It holds a predominant place in the law of Scotland and, I think, the United States, but I am content for the purposes of this case to accept the view that it forms no part of the law of England...\\"Reading v Attorney General [1951] AC 507 at 513-4 per Lord Porter. While restitutionary obligations were not enforced solely through these quasi-contractual claims, the law of quasi-contract constitutes the core of the modern law of unjust enrichment. A seminal case is Moses v Macferlan (1760) 2 Burr 1005. Perhaps more than any other area of the common law, the law of unjust enrichment has been shaped by academic writing,See, e.g., Commerzbank v Gareth Price-Jones [2004] EWCA Civ 1663 at [47] (Mummery LJ). particularly by that of jurists from Oxford and Cambridge. Of course, the law did not develop in a vacuum: the American Law Institute drafted a Restatement of the Law of Restitution in 1937. The first major practitioner text in England appeared in 1966, written by Robert Goff and Gareth Jones.R Goff and G Jones, The Law of Restitution (1966) It was Robert Goff (by this time Lord Goff) who gave the leading judgment in Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd over two decades later. Professor Peter Birks was instrumental in promoting the autonomy of unjust enrichment within the law of obligations in his seminal work Introduction to the Law of Restitution. Academic writing continues to be heavily cited by the highest courts, particularly the more recent work of Professor Andrew Burrows and Professor Graham Virgo, as well as modern editions of Goff & Jones: The Law of Unjust Enrichment, now edited by Professor Charles Mitchell, Professor Paul Mitchell, and Dr Stephen Watterson. A good example of the close relationship between the academy and the profession in the development of this area of law is seen in the recent publication of the Restatement of the English Law of Unjust Enrichment'. === Restitution or unjust enrichment? === As it has developed, the law of unjust enrichment has frequently been referred to as the 'law of restitution'. The difficulty with this is that it emphasises a legal response (restitution) rather than the event which gives rise to it (unjust enrichment).On this point, see generally Peter Birks, 'Property and Unjust Enrichment: Categorical Truths' [1997] NZLR 623. In doing so, it is akin to treating contract (an event which gives rise to an obligation to perform) as coterminous with compensation (the law's response to non-performance or defective performance). That approach is problematic: the law of compensation is wider than contract, encompassing compensation claims arising out of tortious conduct. This is equally true of restitution: a claimant can obtain restitution not only for an unjust enrichment, but also for a tort. It is in this sense that one can say that restitution is multi-causal: it is a legal response to a number of different events. === Continuing controversies === Controversy continues to surround many aspects of the modern law of unjust enrichment. This controversy extends to its existence as an independent body of law, some arguing that the concept of unjust enrichment lacks the explanatory power it is so frequently asserted to have.See Edelman and Degeling, Equity in Commercial Law (LexisNexis, 2005); Steve Hedley, A Critical Introduction to the Law of Restitution (1st ed, 2001). It would be misleading to exaggerate the level of controversy, however. At least in English law, there is high authority accepting the principle of unjust enrichment as having fundamental explanatory force in this area of law.. Recent decisions have continue to clarify key aspects of actions in unjust enrichment.For example, on the meaning of enrichment. Nevertheless, uncertainty pervades key areas of the law: * Enrichment. The principles of enrichment and expense are more stable in cases of transfers of goods or money, but contested in cases where labour and benefits in kind are passed. This distinction owes its origin to the fact that, historically speaking, these were different kinds of claim.Namely, an action for money had and received (for money), a quantum meruit (for services), or a quantum valebat (for goods). * At the claimant's expense. Cases in which a benefit is received by way of a third party can cause difficult issues for courts, given the traditional assumption that a benefit must be acquired directly from the claimant. * 'Unjust' factors. English law has typically adopted an 'unjust factor' approach, whereby the claimant must positively identify a reason why the defendant's enrichment is 'unjust'. 'Unjust' is a generalisation of all the circumstances in which the law calls for restitution. (Campbell J) citing Mason and Carter, Restitution Law in Australia (LexisNexis, 2nd ed, 2008) 59-60. Recognised grounds of restitution include mistake, duress, undue influence and failure of consideration. The unjust factor approach contrasts with certain civilian systems which may adopt an 'absence of basis' approach, whereby the claimant need only show that there is no good reason ('basis') for the defendant's enrichment. * Defences. The categories of defences are also controversial: \\"change of position\\" is a general defence, although the law recognises estoppel, the bona fide purchaser defence, and others as alternatives. * Remedy: personal or proprietary? The law's remedial response to unjust enrichment is particularly controversial. The historical core of unjust enrichment lies in quasi-contract. The quasi- contractual actions were common law claims which awarded a claimant the money value of the benefit received by the defendant. As the law has extended beyond such claims, unjust enrichment scholars have debated the scope of proprietary relief: that is, whether the court should recognise that (or declare that) the claimant has a beneficial or security interest in property held by the defendant (or a third party, as in the case of subrogation to extinguished rights). Despite this controversy, the statement by Justice Deane appears to remain an accurate statement of the place of unjust enrichment in the Anglo- Australian law of obligations:The statement is wholly endorsed by the current editors of Goff & Jones: MItchell, MItchell, Watterson, Goff & Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment (8th ed, 2011) at [1-01]ff. \\"[The concept of unjust enrichment] constitutes a unifying legal concept which explains why the law recognises, in a variety of distinct categories of case, an obligation on the part of a defendant to make fair and just restitution for a benefit derived at the expense of a plaintiff and which assists in the determination, by the ordinary processes of legal reasoning, of the question whether the law should, in justice, recognise such an obligation in a new or developing category of case.. ==Analytic framework== English courts have recognised that there are four steps involved in establishing a claim to restitution for unjust enrichment. This analytic framework was developed by academics such as Professor Peter Birks. The four steps were expressly endorsed by the House of Lords (now Supreme Court) in Banque Financière de la Cité v Parc (Battersea) LtdBanque Financière de la Cité v Parc (Battersea) Ltd [1999] AC 221, per Lord Steyn and Lord Hoffmann, cf , Laws LJ critiquing the open-endedness of Lord Hoffmann's elaboration of the \\"unjust\\" step of a claim. This held an NHS trust had not acted ultra vires so that a £250k payment to a former chief executive could not be recovered as being irrationally overpaid. in the form of four questions: * (1) is a defendant enriched or benefited? * (2) is the enrichment at the claimant's expense? * (3) is the enrichment unjust? * (4) are there any defences? Subsequent case law and academic writing has given greater content to this commonly accepted framework. The application of the formula can be illustrated by Kelly v Solari.Kelly v Solari (1841) 9 M&W; 54. In that case, a company paid out a life insurance policy to a widow by mistake. The company brought an action for money had and received against the widow, seeking restitution of the mistaken payment. Analysed in modern language, the widow had been enriched at the company's direct expense. The 'unjust factor' was mistake: the company had conferred the benefit whilst labouring under the incorrect tacit assumption that the payment was due. === Controversy over the status of the analytical framework === The precise status of this analytic framework and its underpinning concept of unjust enrichment is controversial. * On the one hand, scholars have sought to provide a coherent, rational and principled structure to an area of law once riddled with legal fiction. They have also sought to avoid the perception that courts are dispensing palm tree justice by engaging in an open-ended consideration of the injustice of the circumstances. To this end, 'unjust enrichment' has been treated as a descriptive, taxonomical term with precise legal content: it does not invite some broad, discretionary examination of what is just or equitable on the facts of the case.cf. . The framework is treated as conclusive of liability, producing a clear answer to whether a defendant is obliged to give restitution of a benefit acquired at another's expense. * On the other hand, some have suggested that the framework has too much of a 'broad-brush or legislative flavour'. (Lawes LJ). The UK Supreme Court recently referred to the framework as 'broad headings for ease of exposition' and emphasised that they do not have 'statutory force'. This debate about the precise content of 'unjust enrichment' and the utility of a strict theoretical framework is closely tied to jurisprudential debates about the role of conscience and Equity in a modern system of law. Unjust enrichment has been a key battleground for the so-called 'fusion wars'.See generally, Edelman and Degeling, Equity in Commercial Law (LexisNexis, 2005). As a matter of day-to-day practice, it is this framework which is routinely applied as the organising structure for the law. Nevertheless, practitioners frequently plead claims by reference to the old common counts. It is not yet possible to articulate the law without reference to these old categories. Whether it is desirable to do so remains a controversial question. ===Enrichment=== The first element of a claim is that a defendant is enriched. This requirement distinguishes a claim in unjust enrichment from a claim in tort: the law of unjust enrichment is not concerned with compensation for loss, but rather with the restitution of gains. Historically, the nature of one's claim differed depending upon the nature of the enrichment. For example, if the defendant had received money, the plaintiff would bring an action for money had and received. If the plaintiff had discharged a liability of the defendant by paying money to a third party, the plaintiff would bring an action for money paid to the defendant's use. If instead the defendant had received services or goods, the plaintiff would recover bring a quantum meruit or a quantum valebat, respectively. These were claims for the reasonable value of the services or goods. It is no longer necessary to plead one's form of action. Whilst lawyers often draft their claims by reference to this language, academic commentators tend to analyse the law without regard to such historical distinctions. In short, an 'enrichment' for the purposes of the modern law may include, amongst other things: (i) money; (ii) services; (iii) chattels; and (iv) the discharge of a liability to a third party. Whether a defendant has been enriched (and the proper valuation thereof) is determined objectively. Nevertheless, the law does take account of the defendant's autonomy. This is through the notion of 'subjective devaluation'. In effect, a defendant is entitled to say 'I do not value the benefit as much as you claim I do' or even 'I did not want that benefit at all; to me it is worthless'. The law respects this argument because it protects individual autonomy. The law nevertheless 'looks for its limitations and curbs its excesses'. A plaintiff can overcome subjective devaluation by demonstrating: * (i) that the defendant requested the benefit; or * (ii) that the enrichment is an incontrovertible benefit; or * (iii) that the defendant has freely accepted the benefit. The principles relating to enrichment can be illustrated by the following cases. * In McDonald v Coys of Kensington (Sales) Ltd, Mr McDonald purchased a Mercedes for £20,290 but was mistakenly also given a personalised number plate worth £15,000. By the time anyone realised, the plate had been registered in his name. He was therefore entitled to it under statute. The claimants (assignees of the original owners) sought restitution. Was Mr McDonald 'enriched' by receipt of a number plate personalised for another? The Court held that the benefit was an incontrovertible benefit - that is, a benefit that no reasonable person in the defendant's position would deny. The reason was that 'justice requires that a person, who ... has a benefit or the right to a benefit for which he knows that he has not bargained or paid, should reimburse the value ... if it is readily returnable without substantial difficulty or detriment and he chooses to retain it'.[2004] EWCA Civ 47, [37] That is, Mr McDonald's refusal to return the number plate suggested that he did sufficiently value the benefit, particularly when it was easily returnable. * In Sempra Metals Ltd v IRC a company paid too much advance corporation tax to the public revenue. But for this mistake of law, the payment would have been deferred to a later time. The company sought recovery of the money with compound interest. Had the public revenue been 'enriched' by its early receipt of the money? The House of Lords held that compound interest was available. The question then become one of valuing the claim. The majority held that the enrichment was the opportunity to use the money: the public revenue had effectively received a loan. The decision illustrates that one can bring a claim in respect of the 'use value' of money. * In Exall v Partridge,(1799) 8 TR 308, 101 ER 1405 Mr Exall left his carriage on Mr Partridge's property for repair. Partridge's landlord later seized Partridge's coachbuilding shop and the property inside, include Exall's carriage. In order to end the distress, Exall paid the rent, discharging Partridge's liability to his landlord. Exall then brought an action for money paid to the defendant's use. The Court of King's Bench held that the money could be recovered. Grose J said 'the law implies a promise by the three defendants to repay'. The law now recognises that the implication of a request by Partridge and a promise to pay Exall for the benefit (namely, the discharge of the liability) is fictitious. The case illustrates that one's discharge of a liability of another can constitute an 'enrichment' for the purposes of the law of unjust enrichment. In modern language, this was a claim for recoupment. Whether the principle underlying recoupment and contribution is 'unjust enrichment' remains a controversial question. Rowe v Vale of White Horse DC,[2003] EWHC (Admin) 388 held that receiving sewerage services was an \\"incontrovertible benefit\\". ===At the expense of another=== The enrichment must have come at the 'expense' of the claimant. There are two particularly difficult issues: * Must the enrichment come directly from the claimant? Recent case law suggests that English law is moving away from a strict requirement that the enrichment come directly from the claimant. For example, courts have been willing to turn their attention to questions of causation and the 'economic reality' of the transaction, in lieu of strict directness.Investment Trust Companies v Commissioner [2014] EWHC 458 (Ch) at [67]-[68]. * Must there be correspondence between the claimant's loss and the defendant's gain? Courts have generally adopted the view that there need not be complete 'equivalence' between loss and gain, provided there is a causal connection.See further: Graham Virgo, The Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015) 118; McInnes, 'At the Plaintiff's Expense': Quantifying Restitutionary Relief' [1998] Cambridge Law Journal 472; Andrew Burrows, The Law of Restitution (2011, 3rd ed) 64-5. This issue is related to the question whether there should be a 'passing on' defence: that is, whether a claimant should be able to recover from the defendant despite the claimant having 'passed on' the loss to third parties. There is no such defence in England, Australia or Canada,Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Birmingham City Council [1996] 4 All ER 733 (England); Kingstreet Investments Ltd v New Brunswick [2007] 1 SCR 3 (Canada) although there are some statutory provisions providing for such a defence in each jurisdiction. The requirement that the enrichment be 'at the claimant's expense' distinguishes restitution for unjust enrichment from restitution for wrongs. In the former case, there must be a subtraction from the wealth of the claimant, at least in a notional sense. In the latter, there is no such requirement. For example, where a fiduciary receives a benefit in breach of the 'no profit' rule, the defaulting fiduciary will hold that property on constructive trust for the principal.FHR European Ventures v Cedar Capital Partners [2015] AC 250 In such a case, the principal will have a direct (proprietary) claim against the fiduciary to recover the benefit. It does not matter that the principal (claimant) had no prior proprietary interest in the benefit, nor even that the benefit would never have otherwise been received by the principal. ===In circumstances which are 'unjust'=== In the eyes of the law, there is nothing objectionable about being enriched at the expense of another. But the law will intervene when such enrichment is 'unjust'. The question of injustice is not at large. English law adopts an 'unjust factor' approach to the law of restitution for unjust enrichment.See, e.g., See Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc v IRC [2006] UKHL 49 This means that a claimant must plead by reference to the various factors that the law recognises as 'unjust'. In contrast to the English approach, most civil law jurisdictions adopt an 'absence of basis' analysis. On this view, a defendant's enrichment is 'unjustified' where there is no 'basis' for the defendant's receipt. An example of a 'basis' is where a defendant receives a benefit under a valid and subsisting contract. The difference is more than mere conceptual or semantic emphasis. Nevertheless, in the vast majority of cases, the outcome will be the same whether an 'unjust factor' or an 'absence of basis' approach is adopted. English cases featuring general discussion on the question of injustice include: * Kleinwort Benson Ltd v Lincoln City Council [1999] 2 AC 349 * Woolwich v IRC [1993] AC 70 * Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation v HMRC [2012] UKSC 19, [2012] Bus LR 1033 [162] * Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Group plc v IRC [2006] UKHL 49 ===Defences=== Establishing that a defendant has received a benefit at the expense of the claimant in circumstances which are unjust gives rise to a prima facie right to restitution. In most cases, this is typically a personal right to the money value of the benefit conferred. Liability is strict: there is no need to prove any wrongdoing on the part of the defendant. The question then becomes whether there is a relevant bar or whether the defendant has a valid defence. Defences to restitutionary claims is a broader topic than defences to actions in unjust enrichment. Examples of defences or bars to restitutionary claims include: * Change of position; * Passing on; * Estoppel; * Bona fide purchase for value without notice; * Limitation periods; * Ministerial receipt; * Receipt under a valid contractual or statutory obligation; and * Lack of clean hands. Not all these defences are available to all restitutionary claims. The availability of a defence may turn on: whether a restitutionary claim is legal or equitable; whether a claim is for a personal or proprietary remedy; and whether the claim is brought under national or EU law. ==Unjust factors== Outlined below are the 'unjust factors' which have been recognised (or proposed) within the English law of unjust enrichment. Some of these doctrines feature in the law of contract, where they are termed 'vitiating factors'. The applicable principles are not always the same, however. ===Failure of consideration=== Where one person pays money to another for a consideration which wholly fails, he or she may be entitled to restitution on the ground of total failure of consideration. Academic writing typically refers to this ground as \\"failure of basis\\".Noted by Lord Toulson in Barnes v Eastenders [2014] UKSC 26; see generally, Virgo, Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015); Burrows, Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2011); Mitchell, Mitchell, Watterson, Goff & Jones Law of Unjust Enrichment (8th ed, 2011); Edelman and Degeling, Equity in Commercial Law (LexisNexis, 2005).  Meaning of consideration  \\"Consideration\\" in this context does not bear its contractual meaning. This can be a particular source of confusion, given that the ground of restitution known as \\"failure of consideration\\" typically arises in contractual contexts.Note that it is generally not possible to obtain restitution on the ground of total failure of consideration where a contract is subsisting. \\"Contractual context\\" here should be interpreted broadly: it refers to situations in which there is, or was a contract. * In its narrow and most commonly encountered sense, consideration refers to the failure of the condition on which a benefit was conferred.See Frederick Wilmot-Smith, 'Reconsidering \\"Total\\" Failure' (2013) 72(2) Cambridge Law Journal 414-36. * In its broader sense, consideration refers to the failure of a legal or factual state of affairs which has failed to materialise or subsist..  The total failure rule  The orthodox rule is that the failure of consideration must be total. This means that the claimant must not have received any part of the bargained-for counter-performance;Rover International v Cannon [1989] 1 WLR 912 or, more accurately, that the defendant must not have commenced rendering performance.Stocznia Gdanska v Latvian Shipping [1989] 1 WLR 574 The total failure rule has been subject to persistent academic criticism.See Barnes v Eastenders [2014] UKSC 26 It is subject to several qualifications. In such cases, the claimant may still be entitled to restitution. Examples include: * Where, properly construed, the benefit received by the defendant did not form part of the bargained-for counter-performance; * Where the claimant has only received an \\"incidental\\" benefit;Giedo van der Garde BV v Force India Formula One Team [2010] EWHC 2373 (QB) * Where the claimant has a legal right to reject the benefit and return it in specie;Rowland v Divall [1923] 2 KB 500 * Where there has been a total failure in relation to a severable part.Giedo van der Garde BV v Force India Formula One Team [2010] EWHC 2373 (QB)  Claims in respect of non-money benefits  The ground of restitution known as total failure of developed within the action for money had and received. That action was only available in respect of money claims. Where the claimant conferred a non-money benefit upon a defendant, the correct form of action was a quantum meruit (services) or quantum valebat (goods). It is tolerably clear that failure of consideration can now apply to non-money claims.See Cobbe v Yeoman's Row [2008] UKHL 55; Barnes v Eastenders [2014] UKSC 26.  Taxonomy  Failure of consideration typically arises where a contract is \\"ineffective\\".Keith Mason, John Carter, Gregory Tolhurst, Mason & Carter's Restitution Law in Australia (2nd ed, 2008) 311ff. This is not a term of art, but rather a useful tool for exposition.Keith Mason, John Carter, Gregory Tolhurst, Mason & Carter's Restitution Law in Australia (2nd ed, 2008) 312ff. A contract may be ineffective for a number of reasons. Failure of consideration may arise: * Where a contract is discharged for breach or repudiation by the claimant or defendant; * Where a contract is unenforceable for want of compliance with the relevant formalities; * Where a contract is discharged by frustration;See Fibrosa Spolka v Fairbairn [1942] UKHL 4; restitution for frustrated contracts are now governed by the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943. * Where a contract is rescinded due to a vitiating factor (e.g., mistake; undue influence); * Where a contract is void ab initio.This category of case is vividly illustrated by the Local Authorities Swaps Litigation of the 1990s. ===Mistake=== A benefit conferred upon another whilst labouring under a qualifying mistake gives rise to a prima facie claim for restitution of the benefit. Where one person pays money to another whilst labouring under a causative mistake of fact or law, he or she may be entitled to restitution on the ground of mistake. Restitution for a mistaken payment is widely regarded as the paradigm case of restitution for unjust enrichment.See Birks, Unjust Enrichment (2nd ed, 2005).  Background  Historically, the law took a highly restrictive approach to recovery for mistake. First, the law only recognised mistakes which related to a matter of fact, rather than law.Bilbie v Lumley (1802) 2 East 469 This rule was judicially abandoned in 1999.Kleinwort Benson v Lincoln City Council [1999] 2 AC 349 Secondly, the mistake had to be a \\"supposed liability\\" mistake.Kelly v Solari (1841) 9 M&W; 54; Aiken v Short (1856) 1 H&N; 210; but note cases like Larner v London [1949] 2 KB 683. This meant that the claimant must have laboured under the belief that he or she was under a legal obligation to pay. This rule has also been abandoned,Barclays Bank Ltd v WJ Simms & Cooke [1980] QB 677. though the implications of this remain unsettled.  Claims in respect of non-money benefits  The prevailing academic viewGraham Virgo, The Principles of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015) at 125-6; Mitchell, Mitchell, Watterson, eds., Goff & Jones' Law of Unjust Enrichment (8th ed, 2011) at [9-02]. (for which there is some support in the cases)Craven-Ellis v Canons Ltd [1936] 2 KB 403; Rover International Ltd v Cannon Film Sales Ltd (No 3) [1989] 1 WLR 912; Greenwood v Bennett [1973] QB 195; Marshall v Marshall [1999] 1 Qd R 173; cf. (strong emphasis by the High Court of Australia on the need for a request in a quantum meruit claim). is that mistake can be a ground of restitution for services. ===Misrepresentation=== *Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co (1878) 3 App Cas 1218, on misrepresentation ===Ignorance=== *Common law strict liability subject to defences *Holiday v Sigil *Banque Belge pour L'Etranger v Hambrouck *Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson *Equity, knowing receipt and dealing *Carl-Zess Stiftung v Herbert Smith & Co (No 2), dishonesty required *Re Montagu's Settlement Trusts *Belmont Finance Corp v Williams Furniture Ltd (No 2), negligence also held to be sufficient *BCCI (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele, unconscionability as the test *Re Diplock, strict liability subject to defences as an exception ===Duress=Undue influence and exploitation=== *Relational undue influence *Allcard v Skinner (1887) 36 Ch D 145 *The role of unconscionable conduct *Exploitation of the mental inadequacy of the claimant *Exploitation of the economic weakness of the claimant *Exploitation of the difficult circumstances of the claimant *Illegality to protect vulnerable persons from exploitation ===Legal compulsion=== Legal compulsion is a proposed ground of restitution. It is said to explain the law relating to recoupment and contribution. * Recoupment. Where one person discharges the debt of another, he or she may be able to sue the debtor and thereby recoup the loss. Historically, this was a quasi- contractual action known as an action for money paid, laid out and expended to the defendant's use.Exall v Partridge (1799) 101 ER 1405; for a modern example, see Owen v Tate [1976] 1 QB 402 * Contribution. Where two persons bear a co-ordinate liability, they must share the burden pro rata.. For example, where A and B are both under a common liability to pay C, and A pays this debt, A can claim contribution from C. Historically, this would be a suit in Chancery (or in the Exchequer) and is accordingly an equitable claim.Dering v Earl of Winchelsea (1787) 29 ER 1184 Some rights of contribution are now governed by statute.For example, see the Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 Whether such claims are capable of being rationalised on the ground of unjust enrichment remains a controversial question.See, e.g., Jonathan Hilliard, 'A Case for the Abolition of Legal Compulsion as a Ground of Restitution' (2002) 61 Cambridge Law Journal 551 ===Necessity=Illegality=== *Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd ===Incapacity=== *Companies Act 2006 ss 39-40 *Gibb v Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust [2010] EWCA Civ 678 [26]-[27] held an NHS trust had not acted ultra vires so that a £250k payment to a former chief executive could not be recovered as being irrationally overpaid. *Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC [1992] 2 AC 1. Banks paid councils a lump sum (for Islington, £2.5m). The councils then paid the banks back at the prevailing interest rate. Banks paid councils back a fixed interest rate (this is the swap part). The point was that councils were gambling on what interest rates would do. So if interest rates fell, the councils would win. As it happened, interest rates were going up and the banks were winning. Islington was due to pay £1,354,474, but after Hazell, it refused, and waited to see what the courts said. At first instance Hobhouse J said that because the contract for the swap scheme was void, the council had been unjustly enriched with the lump sum (£2.5m) and it should have to pay compound interest (lots) rather than simple interest (lots, but not so much). But luckily for local government, three law Lords held that Islington only needed to repay with simple interest. There was no jurisdiction for compound interest. They said this was because there was no ‘resulting trust’. *Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC [1996] AC 669, the council had no authority to enter into a complex swap transaction with the German bank. So the House of Lords held that the council should repay the money they had been lent and a hitherto unknown ‘unjust’ factor was added to the list. Birks argued that the better explanation in all cases is an ‘absence of basis’ for the transfer of property. Searching through or adding to a list of open ended unjust factors simply concludes on grounds of what one wishes to prove, grounds that ‘would have to be constantly massaged to ensure that they dictated an answer as stable as is reached by the shorter ‘non basis’ route.’ (Birks (2005) 113) *Banque Financiere de la Cite v. Parc (Battersea) Ltd [1999] 1 AC 221 *Deutsche Morgan Grenfell plc v IRC [2006] UKHL 49 at [26] Money was paid as tax under a statutory regime, which the ECJ later held to have infringed the EC Treaty. The House of Lords held that a claim could be made on grounds of a ‘mistake as to the law’. Professor Charles Mitchell prefers the reasoning of Park J at first instance, which recognised that there is not really a ‘mistake’ in terms of an ‘impairment of a claimant's actual thought processes’. Lord Hoffmann recognised it only implicitly at [32]. ==Remedy: personal and proprietary restitution== If a claimant can establish that the defendant has been enriched at the claimant's expense in circumstances which are unjust, the claimant has a prima facie right to restitution. The question then becomes whether the claimant is entitled to a personal or a proprietary remedy. Historically, the indebitatus counts only afforded a personal remedy. Hence where the claimant's action would have been brought as an action for money had and received, for money paid, or as a quantum meruit or quantum valebat, the claimant is only entitled to a money award. In short, an action for restitution of unjust enrichment only generates a personal liability: the claimant has no proprietary interest in any specific asset of the defendant. Academic writers have sought to expand the explanatory power of 'unjust enrichment'. To this end, writers have suggested that the doctrine of subrogation forms part of the law of unjust enrichment. If correct, this would be an instance of unjust enrichment generating a proprietary remedy. English courts have accepted that the concept of unjust enrichment has a role to play in subrogation. The English approach has been stridently rejected by the High Court of Australia.. Academic writers such as Professor Birks and Professor Burrows have argued that claims to the traceable substitute of one's property are claims in unjust enrichment.See generally, Andrew Burrows, The Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2011); Graham Virgo, The Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015); Mitchell et al, Goff & Jones The Law of Unjust Enrichment (8th ed, 2011). This view has been rejected by the House of Lords.See Foskett v McKeown [2001]. They instead held that such claims were a matter of vindicating property rights, a view long associated with Professor Virgo.Graham Virgo, The Principles of the Law of Restitution (3rd ed, 2015). Even if not (for the foreseeable future) a part of the law of unjust enrichment, a claim to the traceable proceeds of one's property remains part of the law of restitution. The remainder of this section concerns proprietary restitution. Proprietary restitution is where a claimant who is entitled to restitution is awarded a proprietary remedy. ;Tracing at common law *Taylor v Plumer *Banque Belge pour L'Etranger v Hambrouck *Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson *Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd *Trustee of the Property of FC Jones and Sons v Jones ;Tracing in equity *Sinclair v Brougham *Re Diplock [1948] Ch 465, 533, 534, and 539 *Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Vaughan [1992] 4 All ER 22 *Re Hallett's Estate (1880) 13 Ch D 696, 727 *Re Oatway [1903] 2 Ch 356, 360 *Re Tilley's Will Trusts *Foskett v McKeown [2001] 1 AC 102, 127-8 *James Roscoe (Bolton) Ltd v Winder [1915] 1 Ch 62 *Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd *Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Homan ;Proprietary restitution *Chase Manhattan Bank NA v Israel-British Bank (London) Ltd *Lord Napier and Ettrick v Hunter *Boscawen v Bajwa *Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC Following *Jones v De Marchant (1916) 28 DLR 561 Tracing *Shalson v Russo [2003] EWHC 1637 (Ch), [2005] Ch 281 [144] *Turner v Jacob [2006] EWHC 1317 (Ch), [2008] WTLR 307 [100]-[102] Mixing two claimants' money or money mixed with an innocent claimant *Clayton's case (1816) 1 Mer 529 *Russell-Cooke Trust Co v Prentis [2002] EWHC 2227 (Ch), [2003] 2 All ER 478 [55] *Commerzbank AG v IMB Morgan plc [2004] EWHC 2771 (Ch), [2005] 1 Lloyd's Rep 198 Backwards tracing *Bishopsgate Investment Management Ltd v Homan [1994] 3 WLR 1270, 1274 and 1279 *Law Society v Haider [2003] EWHC 2486 (Ch) [40]-[41] *M Conaglen ‘Difficulties with Tracing Backwards’ (2011) 127 LQR 432 Swollen assets theory *Space Investments Ltd v CIBC (Bahamas) Ltd [1986] 1 WLR 1072 *Serious Fraud Office v Lexi Holdings plc [2008] EWCA Crim 1443, [2009] QB 376 [46]-[58] ==DefencesChange of position=== *Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale Ltd *Philip Collins Ltd v Davis [2000] 3 All ER 808 *Scottish Equitable plc v Derby *Commerzbank AG v Gareth Price- Jones *Dextra Bank and Trust Co Ltd v Bank of Jamaica *Niru Battery Manufacturing Co v Milestone Trading Ltd *Barros Mattos Junior v Macdaniels Ltd *RBC Dominion Securities Inc v Dawson ===Estoppel=== *Avon CC v Howlett *Scottish Equitable plc v Derby *National Westminster Bank plc v Somer International (UK) Ltd ===Bona Fide Purchaser=== It means that good value is given for receipt of assets without notice of breach of trust.

NEDC manages a number of funding programs aimed at enhancing economic development in the region. == Roles and Responsibilities == The NEDC is an aboriginal corporation dealing with financial and business development services. It plays a major role in helping Nuu-chah-nulth communities by seizing all existing and emerging opportunities and building on the new economy. It encourages rural economic development and entrepreneurship through services available to all Aboriginal people living and operating in the Nuu-chah-nulth Territory (NEDC, 2008a). NEDC is owned by the Nuu-chah-nulth First Nations who provide the direction and sets priorities for the NEDC. Within Nuu-chah-nulth territories services are offered more broadly to all Nuu-chah-nulth, Aboriginal and Métis peoples — free of charge. Some programs are offered throughout Vancouver Island and on the Mainland. If a Nuu-chah-nulth person needs services outside of the province, NEDC will put that person into contact with the organisation that provides similar services in that locality. Federal and provincial economic development programs are provided through this corporation. Contribution programs include: \\\\- Commercial financing \\\\- Business support (e.g., business planning) \\\\- One-on-one business counselling \\\\- Business workshops and conferences NEDC partners with several organizations to deliver the best funding package to their clients. Some programs are run in cooperation with Aboriginal Business Canada (ABC) and can be found on the ABC website (www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ps/abc/index-eng.asp) or from the links on the NEDC website through the NEDC Business Equity Program webpage (www.nedc.info/bep.php). Some of NEDC's other partners include Western Economic Diversification, the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council, Business Development Bank of Canada, and the New Relationship Trust. Due to the increasing number of successful First Nations business that have arisen over the past few years, the NEDC has compiled a business directory to help people find enterprises that match their inquiries. It also serves as a great tool to inspire other First Nations people to become entrepreneurs and the NEDC is there to help. The directory is organized by business category and contains contact information for all of the Nuu-chah-nulth First Nation Bands.

His situation changed in 1765, after the death of his infant cousin Count William of Promnitz, heir apparent of Pless, left his uncle Johann Erdmann, Count of Promnitz-Pless, without any heirs male; the child's uncle then decided to give Frederick Erdmann the county as an anticipated inheritance.

Some scholars believe the Romanian military nuclear program to have started in 1984, however, others have found evidence that the Romanian leadership may have been pursuing nuclear hedger status earlier than this, in 1967 (see, for example, the statements made toward Israel, paired with the minutes of the conversation between the Romanian and North Korean dictators, where Ceauşescu said, \\"if we wish to build an atomic bomb, we should collaborate in this area as well\\"). The program was dismantled after the Romanian Revolution and currently, Romania is considered free of weapons of mass destruction using nuclear power just for civilian purposes.Tracking Nuclear ProliferationRomania at PBS, May 2, 2005 ==Nuclear program== While Romania had a nuclear research program since 1949, for the first decades, it focused on the usage of radioactive isotopes in medicine and industry. Some have interpreted Romania's actions in nuclear technology and facilities' programs to mean that it had a dedicated, military nuclear program, which started in 1978. The WMD research program (Programul Dunărea - Danube Program) was conducted at the Măgurele Nuclear Research Institute, under the strict supervision of the Securitate.\\"'Baietelul' lui Ceausescu, mort in fasa\\", Evenimentul Zilei, 10 December 2002 According to Mihai Bălănescu, the former director of the research institute, the program had three departments: one which dealt with the development of nuclear weapons, one for the development of medium-range missiles and a third which dealt with chemical and biological weapons. The defection of Securitate general Ion Mihai Pacepa was, according to Lucia Hossu Longin, at least in part related to the order given to him by Ceauşescu, to obtain the technology for a certain element needed in the development of nuclear weapons.\\"Pacepa a fugit din ţară pentru că Ceauşescu l-a obligat să obţină un element pentru fabricarea bombei atomice, spune L. Hossu Longin\\", Realitatea TV, July 5, 2009 In July 1989, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn accused Romania of posing military threats to Hungary, through its nuclear program and a medium- range missiles development program. Horn claimed that high-level Romanian officials announced that Romania is capable of building such weapons, but the Romanian Government denied such claims.Hungary Accuses Rumania of Military Threats\\", The New York Times, July 11, 1989 Other scholars have claimed that Romania was seeking to become a nuclear hedger, where this would be defined as \\"states standing at the threshold of weaponization\\" . Hedging entails the pursuit of nuclear technology and know-how of a state, with the scope of gaining the ability to assemble a nuclear weapon in a short amount of time (around 6 months), should the need arise. This perspective tends to see Ceauşescu speaking more openly of his nuclear aspirations, not as a reflection of a dedicated military nuclear program, but as a dual-use program, where the military option could eventually take a more tangible form. ==Anti-nuclear rallies== Despite this secret program, Ceauşescu's government did organize massive rallies against nuclear proliferation. For instance, at one such rally in December 1981, he addressed a crowd of 300,000 arguing that people in both East and West should \\"stop those who are preparing atomic war.\\"\\"300,000 in Romania Protest Nuclear Weapons\\", The Washington Post, December 6, 1981, p. A19 He also urged the US and USSR to end the arms race which led to the placement of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe, arguing that only by stopping this race could \\"humanity ... be saved from a catastrophe\\".\\"End the arms race, Romanian leader says\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette October 16, 1984, p. 12 In 1989, Ceauşescu claimed that Romania had the technology to build nuclear weapons, but that he remained \\"firmly resolved to fight against nuclear weapons\\".\\"Romanian Nuclear Claim\\", San Jose Mercury News, April 16, 1989, Page 19A ==Deals with other countries== Romania was also involved in negotiations with multiple states on the open market of nuclear technology and materials. After receiving Soviet assistance through the \\"Peaceful Atom\\" program, Romania saw its requests for a nuclear power plant rebuffed by Moscow. The Soviet Union, which was worried by China's October 1964 nuclear test, tried to curtail Romania's nuclear aspirations by offering a light-water reactor, with strings attached, in December 1967. However, the Soviets then kept postponing delivering the technology, and Romania started \\"to employ a strategy of supplier manipulation\\" with the West until 1978. \\"In addition to playing Britain and France off against each other in the mid1960s, Romania negotiated for nuclear power plants with Canada, Italy, Sweden, the United States, and West Germany.\\" It also engaged in negotiations with France and the US simultaneously, pitting one against the other to obtain better nuclear technology and less strict conditions, as they did with other countries. This strategy included separate deals regarding a subcritical assembly from the UK (HELEN), a research reactor from the Gulf Corporation, in 1974, hot cells (which are \\"shielded nuclear radiation containment chambers\\" ) from the US (not concluded) and from France (concluded in 1978), and 5 CANDU power reactors from Canada, in 1976. After 1989, it was revealed that in 1986, the Ceauşescu Government improperly diverted a supply of 14 tonnes\\"India is pressed on atom project\\", New York Times, February 12, 1992 of heavy water originating in Norway to India.\\"Romania Is Reported in Nuclear Deal With India\\", New York Times, April 30, 1990 Heavy water is an important ingredient in the creation of nuclear weapons and the shipment to India was another violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. ==After the 1989 Revolution== After the 1989 Romanian Revolution, Romania announced to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that it had 100 mg of plutonium separated in 1985 at the Piteşti Nuclear Research Institute and it allowed the IAEA full access to its facilities for inspection and monitoring of other violations of the Non- Proliferation Treaty. According to a 1992 article in Nucleonics Week, the plutonium was made using a TRIGA research reactor, given to Romania by the United States in the 1970s. In 2003, Romania handed over to the IAEA 15 kg of highly enriched uranium fuel for the research reactor. ==See also== * Radu (weapon) ==References External links == *\\"Proliferation and the Logic of the Nuclear Market\\" *How to Become a Customer: Lessons from the Nuclear Negotiations between the U.S., Canada and Romania in the 1960s * http://adevarul.ro/cultura/istorie/ceausescusi-programul-nuclear- romaniei-1_510eb9c04b62ed5875d0aaba/index.html Category:Weapons of mass destruction by country Category:Military of Romania Category:Science and technology in Romania ","title":"Romania and weapons of mass destruction"},{"id":"19237330","text":"Canesta is a fabless semiconductor company that was founded in April, 1999, by Cyrus Bamji, Abbas Rafii, and Nazim Kareemi.Marriott, Michel (September 19, 2002). “No Keys, Just Soft Light and You”.

Microsoft had developed a motion controller for its Xbox 360 game console, using PrimeSense technology and the current Kinect for Xbox One switched over to the Canesta Time-of-flight camera core technology. ==Finances== The company has raised $70 Million to date in subsequent rounds of investment. The company's investors include The Carlyle Group, Venrock Associates, KGIF, Hotung Capital, Honda Motor Company, Ltd., Optex, Ltd., Quanta Computer Inc. (2382.TW), and SMSC (NASDAQ: SMSC). ==Products== Canesta provides its electronic perception technology in the form of CMOS 3D image sensors to multiple OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) markets, including consumer electronics, video gaming, automotive, security, and industrial. As of Q3 2010, the latest generation of Canesta sensor was the 'Cobra' 3D ToF CMOS sensor. This sensor uses a standard CMOS image sensor process and has a ToF pixel array with XY resolution of 320x200. The range accuracy is characterized by the noise around the correct range data, and in this 'Cobra' device, this noise is around the single digit millimeter. The company also provides reference designs, functioning sensor modules, and developer's toolkits. ==Technology== Canesta's time-of-flight technology consists of an array of pixels where every pixel can independently determine the distance to the object it sees. This array is in effect a massively parallel LIDAR on a single CMOS chip. At the heart of the technology is a proprietary silicon photo collection structure in each pixel that allows accurate measurement of the arrival time of the collected photons. This photo collection structure is substantially immune to CMOS surface defects that ordinarily adversely affect time of flight operation. This enables time of flight ranging using a low cost CMOS process.Wilson, Andrew (July 1, 2004). “CMOS single-chip sensor captures 3-D images”. Vision Systems.Spare, James (August, 2004). “Machine vision: Adding the Third Dimension. Electronic perception technology is a new way to make direct, rather than derived, depth measurements of target objects” . Sensors. Using Canesta technology a 3D time- of-flight camera can be constructed from a Canesta CMOS time of flight sensor, an imaging lens to focus the light from the scene onto the sensor and an LED or laser diode based light source controlled by the sensor to illuminate the scene with near infrared light. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * May, Mike (December, 2002). “Type It Anywhere”.

The prison was operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and closed in January 2014. ==History== Opened in 1963 with four wings (A, B, C & D wings), Blundeston Prison was expanded three times before its closure, firstly in 1975 with the addition of two multi occupancy cell wings (F & G wings), secondly in 2002 with the addition of a Democratic Therapeutic Community wing (I wing), and finally in 2008 with the construction of a 60 cell modular block for prisoners serving life sentences (J wing). In 1996 the prison came under intense criticism after six inmates escaped whilst being transferred to other jails. The escapers had allegedly been running their own 'criminal empire' at Blundeston before their transfer. Further controversy hit the prison in 2003 when a prison officer was \\"sacked for making an insulting remark about...Osama bin Laden.\\" This followed reports that inmates at Blundeston had seen their fruit quota cut after some had been accused of fermenting it to make alcohol. Before closure, accommodation at the prison included 4 wings of single cells and 2 wings of 2 or 4-man cells. The therapeutic wing had single cell accommodation. Blundeston provided workshops, training courses, a Listener Scheme and a full-time Resettlement Officer. The visitor centre was staffed and managed by the Ormiston Children and Families Trust with facilities including a refreshments area, toilets, public pay phone and play facilities for children. On 4 September 2013, the Ministry of Justice announced that it intended to close Blundeston Prison by March 2014. The prison formally closed in January 2014 under The Closure of Prisons Order 2014. The closure of the prison led to criticism from local politicians, including planning proposals to allow the site to be used for a large housing development. The Ministry of Justice stated that intended to sell the site for redevelopment by the end of 2014; however, the site was finally sold in January 2016 for £3 million to Badger Building. The developers are now asking for ideas for the former prison site to be submitted to them before they release planning proposals. Demolition of the old prison started in August 2017. ==Notable former inmates== * John Stonehouse, a former Member of Parliament who was convicted of fraud, theft, forgery, conspiracy to defraud, causing a false police investigation and wasting police time after faking his own death.

Its mines were located in the Pittsburgh Coalfield of western Pennsylvania. ==Ormsby Mine== The Ormsby mine was an underground coal mine, originally opened in 1838 by the son-in law of Oliver Ormsby, John Harding Page and Captain Phillips. The mine was served by a gravity plane, or incline, built between 1838 and 1844. It was operated by Doctor Oliver Harrison Ormsby, the son of the above named Oliver Ormsby, from 1851 to 1861. The Keeling Coal Company operated it from 1861 to May 1878. It was then taken over by the Birmingham Coal Company, which had Joseph Keeling as one of its partners. The mine was extensive, eventually connecting to the nearby Bausman Mine, which Keeling also operated. Coal from this mine was used in early steam engine experiments by the U.S. Navy on the Michigan. ==Coal Road== An underground transportation system connecting the Ormsby mine with other local coal mines was begun in 1867. Like many mine railroads in the Pittsburgh area, this was a narrow gauge line. After the coal was removed, it was transported underground from the South Hills to industries along the Monongahela river. The \\"coal road\\" passed under three hills, under Mount Oliver, Pennsylvania, then a trestle over a ravine at the present location of Parkwood Road, then under the hill topped by Fort Jones, later St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church and St. Clair Village, then over another ravine at the present-day Wagner Street, to re-enter an underground mine section in Carrick near where Bruner Street is today. This mine connected with the narrow gauge line of the Bausman Mine in Spiketown, now Carrick, and was still operational in 1899. Coal was transferred from Spiketown to the mine entrance on St. Patrick Street by a tail rope system, which was later replaced by a steam locomotive that ran underground. The coal from the mine was transferred to the Birmingham Coal Railroad, a narrow gauge railroad that ran down the middle of South 21st Street from an inclined plane railroad. Although the incline is no longer in existence, its site is occupied by South Side Park, which was also a location of a Sankey brick works. When the enginehouse of the coal road burned shortly before the expiration of Keeling's lease on the mine, the lease was not renewed; At about the same time, the Pittsburgh and Whitehall Railroad obtained an easement adjacent to the track in the center of South 21st St. ==Knoxville Incline== In addition to the incline from the Ormsby mine, the Keeling company ran a separate incline for coal, this one with a curve, that in part ran parallel to the lower end of the Mt.

In a browse-wrap agreement, the terms and conditions of use for a website or other downloadable product are posted on the website, typically as a hyperlink at the bottom of the screen.Kwan v. Clearwire Corp., No. C09-1392JLR, 2012 WL 32380 (W.D. Wash. Jan. 3, 2012).Hines v. Overstock.com, Inc., 668 F. Supp. 2d 362, 366 (E.D.N.Y. 2009). Unlike a clickwrap agreement, where the user must manifest assent to the terms and conditions by clicking on an \\"I agree\\" box, a browse-wrap agreement does not require this type of express manifestation of assent. Rather, a web-site user purportedly gives their consent simply by using the product — such as by entering the website or downloading software. Browse-wrap agreements, like clickwrap agreements, derive their name by analogy to the \\"shrink wrap agreements\\" included inside the sealed packaging of tangible products, where one can not see the agreement until the product has been purchased or used.Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp., 306 F.3d 17 (2nd Cir.2002). Courts that have ruled on the issue have held that the validity of a browse-wrap agreement primarily depends on whether a website user has actual or constructive notice of the terms and conditions prior to using the website or other product. ==Case law== In Specht v. Netscape, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals looked at the enforceability of a browse-wrap contract entered into on the Netscape website. Users of the site were urged to download free software available on the site by clicking on a tinted button labeled \\"download\\". Only if a user scrolled down the page to the next screen did he come upon an invitation to review the full terms of the program's license agreement, available by hyperlink. The plaintiffs, who had not seen the agreement, downloaded the software and then were later sued for violations of federal privacy and computer fraud statutes arising from the use of the software. The Second Circuit then noted that an essential ingredient to contract formation is the mutual manifestation of assent. The court found that \\"a consumer's clicking on a download button does not communicate assent to contractual terms if the offer did not make clear to the consumer that clicking on the download button would signify assent to those terms.\\" Because the plaintiffs were not put on notice of these terms they were not bound by them. In Ticketmaster v. Tickets.com, the court looked at a breach of contract claim where the terms and conditions were situated at the bottom of the home page in \\"small print.\\"Ticketmaster Corp. v. Tickets.com, Inc., 2000 WL 525390, at *3 (C.D.Cal. March 27, 2000).

In 2005, the Illinois Appellate Court ruled in favor of a browse-wrap agreement in Hubbert v. Dell Corp. In this case consumers of Dell products were repeatedly shown the words \\"All sales are subject to Dell's Term[s] and Conditions of Sale\\", including a conspicuous hyperlink, over a series of pages. The court found that this repeated exposure and visual effect would put a reasonable person on notice of the \\"terms and conditions\\".Hubbert v. Dell Corp., 835 N.E. 2d 113 (Ill. App. Ct. 2005). In contrast, in 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble, Inc. that Barnes & Noble's 2011 Terms of Use agreement, presented in a browse-wrap manner via hyperlinks alone, was not enforceable since it failed to offer users reasonable notice of the terms. Similarly, in In re Zappos.com, Inc., Customer Data Security Breach Litigation, the United States District Court for the District of Nevada ruled against Zappos.com's browsewrap terms of use, describing that its presentation was not prominent, and that no reasonable user would have read the agreement. ==Summary== A browse-wrap agreement can be formed by use of a web page or a hyperlink or small disclaimer on the page. It may only be enforced if the browsing user assents to it. For assent to occur the browse-wrap agreement should be conspicuous, state that there is an agreement, and provide where it can be located. Courts examine the enforceability of browse-wrap agreements on a case-by-case basis, and there are no \\"bright-line\\" rules on whether a given agreement is sufficiently conspicuous. However, based on Specht, some practitioners believe > that the icon for the terms of use agreement be placed in the upper left- > hand quadrant of the homepage and that all visitors be channeled through the > homepage. The reason for this suggestion is that the court will take > judicial notice of the fact that all Internet pages open from the upper > left-hand quadrant, thus the defendant must overcome the presumption that > the icon was viewed. Without this presumption, the plaintiff has the burden > of proving the defendant did see the icon.Karen Berger and Jonathan Bick, > New Jersey Law Journal, September 18, 2009. ==See also== * Electronic signature * Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN) ==References * Consumer Project on Technology's collection of Browsewrap Clauses in Current Shrinkwrap and Clickwrap Contracts Category:Software licenses Category:Computer law ","title":"Browse wrap"},{"id":"19237503","text":"The International Eight Metre class are class of racing yachts. Eight Metre boats (often called \\"Eights\\" or 8mR) are a construction class, meaning that the boats are not identical but are all designed to meet specific measurement formula, in this case International rule. Before WW II Eights were the most prestigious international yacht racing class, and they are still raced around the world. \\"Eight metre\\" in class name does not, somewhat confusingly, refer to length of the boat, but product of the formula. 8mR boats are on average some 15 metres long. Between 1907 and 2008 approximately 500 8mR boats were built, 177 of them have survived until today. ==History== 1912 Summer Olympics. The Finnish eights Sphinx (FIN–4) and Sagitta (FIN–2) competing in 2012. The International Rule was set up in 1907 to replace earlier, simpler handicap system which were often local or at best, national, and often also fairly simple, producing extreme boats which were fast but lightly constructed and impractical. The Eight Metre class was the medium size rating established under the rule and they were chosen as an Olympic class in 1908 Summer Olympics. The Eights remained in the Olympics until 1936. New, modern eights are still built utilising newest contemporary technologies, at the rate of 1–3 boats per year. During the 1980s, many old sailboat classes experienced a revival of interest. The class has undergone a renaissance which has continued to the day, with many old yachts restored or rebuilt to racing condition, and 8mr competition is once again thriving with 25–35 boats participating annually at the 8mR Worlds. \\"The International Eight Register\\" includes 177 identified existing boats of a total of approximately 500 boats built from 1907 until today. ==Events== { -  style=\\"align:center;\\"  1908 London details style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Great Britain Great Britain (GBR) Blair Cochrane Charles Campbell John Rhodes Henry Sutton Arthur Wood style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Sweden Sweden (SWE) Carl Hellström Edmund Thormählen Eric Sandberg Erik Wallerius Harald Wallin The Duchess of Westminster style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Great Britain Great Britain (GBR) Philip Hunloke Alfred Hughes Frederick Hughes George Ratsey William Ward -  style=\\"align:center;\\"  1912 Stockholm details style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Norway Norway (NOR) Thoralf Glad Thomas Aas Andreas Brecke Torleiv Corneliussen Christian Jebe style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Sweden Sweden (SWE) Bengt Heyman Emil Henriques Alvar Thiel Herbert Westermark Nils Westermark style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Finland Finland (FIN) Bertil Tallberg Arthur Ahnger Emil Lindh Gunnar Tallberg Georg Westling -  style=\\"align:center;\\"  1920 Antwerp 1907 rule details style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Norway Norway (NOR) Carl Ringvold Thorleif Holbye Alf Jacobsen Kristoffer Olsen Tellef Wagle style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"No further competitors style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"No further competitors -  style=\\"align:center;\\"  1920 Antwerp 1919 rule details style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Norway Norway (NOR) Magnus Konow Thorleif Christoffersen Reidar Marthiniussen Ragnar Vik style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Norway Norway (NOR) Jens Salvesen Finn Schiander Lauritz Schmidt Nils Thomas Ralph Tschudi style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Belgium Belgium (BEL) Albert Grisar Willy de l'Arbre Georges Hellebuyck Léopold Standaert Henri Weewauters -  style=\\"align:center;\\"  1924 Paris details style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Norway Norway (NOR) Carl Ringvold Rick Bockelie Harald Hagen Ingar Nielsen Carl Ringvold, Jr. style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Great Britain Great Britain (GBR) Ernest Roney Harold Fowler Edwin Jacob Thomas Riggs Walter Riggs style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"France France (FRA) Louis Breguet Pierre Gauthier Robert Girardet André Guerrier Georges Mollard -  style=\\"align:center;\\"  1928 Amsterdam details style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"France France (FRA) Donatien Bouché André Derrien Virginie Hériot André Lesauvage Jean Lesieur Carl de la Sablière style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Netherlands Netherlands (NED) Johannes van Hoolwerff Lambertus Doedes Hendrik Kersken Cornelis van Staveren Gerard de Vries Lentsch Maarten de Wit style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Sweden Sweden (SWE) Clarence Hammar Tore Holm Carl Sandblom John Sandblom Philip Sandblom Wilhelm Törsleff -  style=\\"align:center;\\"  1932 Los Angeles details style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"United States United States (USA) Owen Churchill John Biby Alphonse Burnand Kenneth Carey William Cooper Pierpont Davis Carl Dorsey John Huettner Richard Moore Alan Morgan Robert Sutton Thomas Webster style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Canada Canada (CAN) Ronald Maitland Ernest Cribb Peter Gordon George Gyles Harry Jones Hubert Wallace style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\" No further competitors -  style=\\"align:center;\\"  1936 Berlin details style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Italy Italy (ITA) Giovanni Reggio Bruno Bianchi Luigi De Manincor Domenico Mordini Enrico Poggi Luigi Poggi style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Norway Norway (NOR) Olaf Ditlev-Simonsen John Ditlev-Simonsen Hans Struksnæs Lauritz Schmidt Jacob Thams Nordahl Wallem style=\\"vertical-align:top;\\"Germany Germany (GER) Hans Howaldt Fritz Bischoff Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Eduard Mohr Felix Scheder-Bieschin Otto Wachs } ===World Championships=== After a long break, the Worlds have been organized for the eight metres in four classes: 1\\\\.

The film stars the director's mother, Vanessa Redgrave, and includes cameos by Angelina Jolie, the director's half-sister Joely Richardson and Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker Michael Moore. ==Background== The original play was a piece of experimental theater performed as a monologue by the play's author, Wallace Shawn. Unlike conventional plays, Shawn initially performed The Fever not in a theater, but in private homes by appointment. Later, he performed the piece in a theater, but in keeping with the desire to be unconventional in presentation, Shawn eschewed theatrical lighting, sets, and theater programs, and mingled with the audience immediately before the play began. In an interview with The Paris Review, Shawn explained that he used these novel approaches to avoid people dismissing the play's message as merely \\"great theater.\\" ==Plot== The film follows the existential crisis of an unnamed urban sophisticate (Vanessa Redgrave) who becomes aware of the nature of world politics, economic exploitation and the vapid consumerism around her. A series of events lead her to visit an unnamed third world country, representing an exotic location somewhere in Eastern Europe, where the entire economy and populace are geared towards the tourist industry. Even as she enjoys the rare taste of its products she is made starkly aware of the reality behind the façade by a journalist (Michael Moore) who, subsequently, suggests a visit to the country's war-torn neighbour in order to experience a true picture of life in the region. She does so and her life is changed forever. Once back, and now acutely attuned to the world about her, she can no longer fit back into her old elitist and consumer-driven lifestyle; watching operas, discussing art and theatre with friends, shopping for \\"beautiful things\\" and aggrandizing her trifling everyday struggles, all seem meaningless to her compared with her recent macro epiphany. Compared with the global struggle for existence, her life begins to feel insignificant. Having lived in the bubble her guilt-free, pleasure-filled, life she is now challenged to look beyond comfort and soon finds herself in the throes of a moral dilemma, questioning the moral consistency of her own life and the choices that have affected the lives of the poor in far corners of the globe. She feels that she cannot be truly free having apprehended this new reality, which confronts her blindness to the harsh truths of the class struggle and her sense of entitlement, which had, in the past, been broken, only occasionally, by displays of sympathy. She returns to the war-torn nation to explore her feelings further, this new reality now drawing her ever-deeper. This leads to a delirious bout of fever in a run-down hotel where her inner-self challenges her need for comfort and entitlement, culminating in a moment of spiritual awakening and a perceived 'oneness' with all reality. Finally she sees the truth about her own life and her innate connection with every human being, apprehending the transient nature of her material life. She can no longer sit, immersed in her personal comforts and vanity, or \\"clean sheets\\" as she terms it, and pretend it’s all right when the world around her is filled with strife and exploitation for millions of people. She is lustrated of her previous immunity towards their predicament and is, by extension, finally able to see the truth of own life, as summarised by film's tag-line: Enlightenment Can Be Brutal.

By 2012 the school began the New Tech Academy, with plans for all high school students to begin the program the following year. According to Hill, the school had a bad reputation with fight videos appearing on social media but that \\"the school is more than the on-campus fights, its students are more than they’ve been stereotyped to be and not all of its teachers give up and leave. Not that the school doesn’t face big challenges.\\" it is the sole combined middle and high school of its school district. The campus boasts the copper and bronze sculpture Tree of Knowledge by Satoru Abe. ==History== It opened in 1967 in the eastern portion of the former facility of Nanaikapono Elementary & Intermediate School, hitherto a combined elementary and middle school. The other part of the former campus became a standalone elementary school. Its current campus opened in 1972. ==Operations== In 2012 Teach for America (TFA) supplied many of the teachers who were newly hired. In 2012 Diana Agor, the vice principal, stated that communication issues were the most significant ones faced by the school. Hill stated that turnover of employees was another issue. ==Programs== Hill praised the school's programs in 2012. ==Traditions== Homecoming Every year Nānākuli High and Intermediate School celebrates its homecoming with a week-long competition called Spirit Week. This is an event in which all separate classes from grades 7-12 compete with each other in various planned activities. There are different themes for each day of the week decided by NHIS's student government. This competition is usually concluded with Black and Gold day on the Friday of the homecoming game. Along with its noon time festivities, Homecoming in Nānākuli High and Intermediate is usually accompanied by a parade on the afternoon of the Homecoming game. This parade starts from Mano Road and makes its way all the way up Nānākuli Valley into the NHIS's football field. Within this parade one can see the many various organizations within the school. There are mini floats made by each individual class that students from their respective classes march with in the procession to the school. Other than class floats, there is also a Homecoming court, which consist of class attendants (1 boy and 1 girl) from the 9-12th grade classes in addition to the Homecoming King and Queen and Mr. and Ms. Golden Hawk. The Homecoming festivities come to its conclusion with the Varsity team's game and when the winners of the Spirit Week competition are announced at half time after the presentation of the Homecoming court. Homecoming is one of Nānākuli High and Intermediate School's major events not only within the school, but within the community as well. ==References * Nanakuli High and Intermediate School * * Art Inventories Catalog, Smithsonian American Art Museum Category:Public middle schools in Honolulu County, Hawaii Category:Public high schools in Honolulu County, Hawaii Category:Educational institutions established in 1967 Category:1967 establishments in Hawaii ","title":"Nanakuli High and Intermediate School"},{"id":"19237684","text":"The New York Giants Radio Network is a broadcast radio network based in New York City, the official radio broadcaster of the New York Giants.

MFVNs are interconnected with the public switched telephone network (PSTN) and provide dialtone to end users. Historically, this was provided by equipment at Bell company central offices, however today's MFVNs can include a combination of access network (last mile network of copper, coaxial cable, or fiber optics), customer premises equipment (CPE), network switches and routers, network management systems, voice call servers, and gateways to the larger PSTN. MFVN providers include cable operators and telephone companies, but do not include Internet based providers such as Vonage, Magic Jack, and others that use the public internet to carry calls. ==Definition== MFVN providers: :(a) Manage and maintain their network to ensure end-to-end service quality and reliability from the service subscriber location to the PSTN or other MFVN peer network, :(b) Provide a service that is functionally equivalent to traditional analog phone service with respect to dialing, dial plan, call completion, carriage of voice signals and protocols, and loop voltage treatment, :(c) Provide real- time transmission of voice signals that carry FAX, data, Point of Sale (POS), burglar alarm and fire alarm system formats unchanged, :(d) Provide both professional installation and subscriber information on home wiring practices for residential installations if self-installation is available, which preserves primary line seizure for alarm system interconnection, and :(e) Have major and minor disaster recovery plans to address both individual customer outages and widespread events such as tornados, ice storms or other occurrences of a catastrophic nature, which include specific network power restoration procedures equivalent to those of traditional landline telephone services. ==History== The term MFVN was introduced in 2007 by various telephony user organizations and stakeholders who rely on telephone service to provide security and life safety services. The concern of these organizations and stakeholders was the reliability of new telephone technology and services. This new technology was based on packet voice technology, or the Voice over Internet Protocol, which was not well understood. These organizations and stakeholders increasingly realized that they could no longer simply assume that phone service would be reliable enough, because it was increasingly being delivered in various ways, even by traditional providers. Clear performance requirements were needed to define when a phone line was suitable for security and life safety services. This issue was not new, as analog copper based networks had been transitioning to digital telephony technology for 25 years (via fiber buildout by telephone companies), and to IP technology methods for the last 10 years (via broadband buildout by telco, cable, and competitive local exchange carriers). What was new was that copper based analog phone service was not even an option anymore in many areas, as it was being completely replaced by digital and IP based phone service. Starting in the early part of the 2000s, IP based voice services began being offered by non- traditional providers such as cable television service providers and Internet voice service providers. The demand for these services grew due to competitive pricing and value added services not offered by the traditional telephone providers. The use of these non-traditional telephone methods for security and life safety communications was not well understood, so use was discouraged and in some cases not allowed by local authorities. There was no distinction between voice services provided over the \\"best-effort\\" Internet and voice services provided over managed facilities. It became clear that only managed facilities based providers could assure reliability end to end. Only facilities based providers could monitor and maintain the expected quality of service (call quality, operation during power failure, wiring procedures that guaranteed pre-emption of existing calls for emergency calls, and local disaster recovery capabilities). In 2007, the concept of the Managed Facilities-based Voice Network was introduced by non-traditional telephone providers as a way to think about the PSTN as a collection of managed networks, rather than as a single, monolithic entity. The National Fire Protection Association incorporated this concept into the latest fire code, NFPA 72 2010, which is now the basis for determining whether a given phone line is an acceptable method for fire alarm signaling transmission from a protected premises to a supervising central monitoring station. Local authorities, such as fire inspectors, now no longer need to make these determinations on an individual case basis. States have begun to recognize and accept the use of MFVN. In Florida, it has been adopted by statute, whereby all qualified MFVNs are now allowed for fire alarm monitoring. *Florida Division of State Fire Marshal, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.), Monitoring section of the FIRE SAFETY STANDARDS FOR FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS Rule Number 69A-48.008, ID 7860509 The following diagram is a high level view of the different types of MFVNs vs non-MFVNs compared side-by-side.

He served as President of Peking University during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and was forced to resign afterwards. He later served as Chairman of the China Democratic League from 1996 to 2005 and Vice Chairperson of the National People's Congress. ==Early life== Ding was born on September 5, 1927 in Shanghai, Republic of China, to Ding Jiacheng () and Liu Huixian (), with his ancestral home in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu. He attended Utopia University in Shanghai from 1944 to 1947. A participant in anti-government student activities, he was arrested by the Kuomintang government and expelled by the university. As a result, he moved north to Beijing and entered Tsinghua University in 1948. == Early career == Ding graduated from the Department of Mathematics of Tsinghua University in 1950, after the founding of the People's Republic of China, and was hired by the university as an assistant professor. In 1952, he transferred to Peking University, where he later rose to lecturer and professor. During the Anti-Rightist Campaign in 1958, Ding sympathized with those denounced as \\"rightists\\". Although not labelled a rightist, he received administrative admonition and was expelled from the Communist Party of China in 1960. His membership was later restored. When the Cultural Revolution broke out in 1966, he was imprisoned and later sent to perform manual labour at a May Seventh Cadre School. After the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Ding was politically rehabilitated and appointed vice chair of the Department of Mathematics of Peking University. He was promoted to chairman in 1980. == President of Peking University == In 1982, Ding resigned as mathematics chair and went to Harvard University as a visiting scholar. While he was away in the United States, Peking University ran a poll in 1983 among senior faculty members to select its next president, and Ding received the most votes. In March 1984, Ding was appointed President of Peking University at the age of 57. As president, he implemented policies to reward faculty members who taught classes, especially foundational courses, withheld bonuses from those who did not teach, and dismissed those who could not teach or conduct significant research. As president, Ding continued to teach the foundational course of Advanced Algebra. According to a report in Yanhuang Chunqiu, when Mao Xinyu, the grandson of Mao Zedong, graduated from high school in 1988, his mother Shao Hua tried to enroll him at Peking University. Ding rejected her request on the pretext that he could not guarantee Mao's safety among the liberal- minded students, and Mao ended up enrolling at Renmin University of China instead. During his tenure, Ding promoted the spirit of \\"democracy and science\\", but some of his reforms were thwarted by the government. In 1988, he submitted his resignation to Education Minister Li Tieying, but Li declined the request. When the Tiananmen Square protests erupted in April 1989, students of Peking University played a leading role and Ding did not prevent them from joining the protests. After the Chinese government cracked down on the protests in June 1989, Ding was forced to resign in August 1989. He was replaced by Wu Shuqing, a vice president of Renmin University. In an interview with China Central Television, Ding described his tenure as president a failure, and said that he failed to transform Peking University into the ideal university he had envisioned. However, the prominent scholar Ji Xianlin called Ding one of the two best presidents in the history of the university, together with Cai Yuanpei. == Later career == On the invitation of Fei Xiaotong, Chairman of the China Democratic League (CDL), Ding became a full-time Vice Chairman of the CDL in 1993, although he continued to teach freshman mathematics at Peking University. In November 1996, Ding succeeded Fei as Chairman of the CDL. He became a Vice Chairperson of the National People's Congress in 1998, serving two terms until 2008. In December 2005, Ding retired as Chairman of CDL and became an honorary chairman. ==Death== Ding died on October 12, 2019 in Beijing, aged 92. On October 17, he was buried in the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. == Personal life == In 1956, Ding married , a faculty member in the chemistry department of Peking University.

When the Rubins learned that Sweets Co., one of their major customers, was in serious difficulty, they became interested in acquiring control of the company. The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but Bernard Rubin acquired a list of shareholders and approached them in person in order to purchase their shares. The Rubins eventually achieved control and agreed that Bernard would run the company as president. He changed the formula for Tootsie Rolls and increased its size.

He ordered the formation of 225th RAF (Bomber) Group on 1 January 1942. Maltby arrived in West Java on 14 February 1942 and set up his headquarters at Soekaboemi. The allies suffered heavy losses of planes to the Japanese. On 22 February 1942 the ABDA Command was dissolved. Churchill generally agreed with Wavell that Java should be fought for, but insisted that the main reinforcements should be sent to Burma and India and not to Java. The overall command was handed over to the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army. Churchill signaled Maltby the very next day: \\"I send you and all ranks of the British forces who have stayed behind in Java my best wishes for success and honour in the great fight that confronts you. Every day gained is precious, and I know that you will do everything humanly possible to prolong the battle\\". Maltby's main tasks were to continue the fight to defend Java as long as equipment could be maintained and do everything possible to evacuate surplus units and personnel to Ceylon or Australia. The Japanese invasion force landed on Java at the end of February and the start of March. The allied forces were quickly beaten. On 12 March 1942 the senior British, Australian and American commanders were summoned to Bandoeng where the formal instrument of surrender was signed in the presence of the Japanese commander in the Bandoeng area, Lieutenant General Masao Maruyama, who promised them the rights of the Geneva Convention for the protection of prisoners of war. From 1942 to 1945 Maltby was a Japanese prisoner of war.

He returned to London to seek work, and, on the recommendation of Davies Gilbert and Lieutenant Stratford, was employed at the Royal Greenwich Observatory as a computer. George Airy, the astronomer royal, was soon impressed by him, and in 1840 Dunkin was promoted to a post in the new magnetic and meteorological department, becoming a permanent member of the observatory's staff in 1845. ==Personal life== He married in 1838 Maria Hadlow of Peckham, a stockbroker's daughter.

Dunkin has a number of his scholarly articles listed in Collecteana Cornubiensa Column 217. author of The Monumental Brasses of Cornwall with Descriptive, Genealogical and Heraldic Notes, 1882. ==Scientific work== Dunkin's meticulous accuracy and dependability led to him being given charge of a number of investigations, including the adjustment and error quantification of instruments such as Greenwich's new lunar azimuth and transit circle, and the expedition to Norway in 1851 to observe the total eclipse. Airy also used Dunkin as a reliable \\"man on the spot\\" in various non-Greenwich activities, including pendulum experiments at Harton colliery, and the determinations of the longitudes of the Brussels and Paris observatories. In 1881, on Airy's retirement, Dunkin was promoted to chief assistant, or Deputy Astronomer Royal, holding that post until he retired in 1884. Dunkin was a highly sociable man. In 1845 he was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society, and in 1884 was elected its president. He was delighted to be elected to the RAS Dining Club in 1868, becoming its president in 1880. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1876 and later served on the Council of the Royal Society. He was President of the Royal Institution of Cornwall in 1890 and 1891.

() is a 2009 Persian-language American drama film adapted from French-Iranian journalist Freidoune Sahebjam's 1990 book La Femme Lapidée. The film is directed by Cyrus Nowrasteh, and stars Academy Award nominee Shohreh Aghdashloo (as Zahra), Jim Caviezel (as Freidoune Sahebjam, the foreign journalist), and Mozhan Marnò (as Soraya Manutchehri, the title character). The Stoning of Soraya M. had its world premiere at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, where it won the Director's Choice Award. It was also the second runner-up for the Cadillac People's Choice Award. The book has been banned in Iran. ==Plot== Stranded in the remote Iranian village of Kuhpayeh by car trouble, a journalist is approached by Zahra, a woman with a harrowing tale to tell about her niece, Soraya, and the bloody circumstances of Soraya's death by stoning the previous day. The two sit down as Zahra recounts the story to Freidoune, who records the conversation. The journalist must escape with his life to tell the story to the rest of the world. Ali is Soraya's abusive husband who tries to get the village's mullah to convince Soraya to grant him a divorce so that he can marry a 14-year-old girl. Ali is able to convince the mullah by making threats to tell the village about his past as a convict. Ali's marriage to the teenager is conditional on Ali's ability to save the girl's father, a doctor who has been sentenced to death for an unspecified crime. Soraya has two sons whom Ali wants. After a woman dies, Ali asks Zahra to persuade Soraya to care for the woman's now-widowed husband. Soraya starts working for the widower, and Ali uses this situation to spread lies that Soraya is being unfaithful to him so that she will be stoned and he can remarry. Ali knows if Soraya were dead, he would not have to pay child support either. Ali and the mullah start a rumor about her infidelity so they can charge her with adultery. They need one more witness to her \\"infidelity\\" to be able to formally charge her. They manipulate and threaten the widower into backing up their story. Ali then drags Soraya through the streets, beating her and publicly declaring that she has been unfaithful. Zahra intervenes, and takes her niece, Ali, and the mayor to talk privately. They bring the widower to the home, and, after he lies as instructed, a trial is pursued. Only men, including Soraya's father, are allowed while Soraya is confined in Zahra's house. She is quickly convicted. Zahra tries to flee with her and after realizing she cannot, pleads with the mayor for her life, even offering to switch places with Soraya. The conviction is upheld. Soraya's father is given the first stone to throw, but he misses her repeatedly. A woman in the crowd pleads to the mayor that the stones missing are a sign that Soraya is innocent, but none of the men listen. Ali takes up stones and throws them himself. Her two sons are also forced to throw stones. The widower is given stones as well but instead walks away in tears. The crowd finally joins in and Soraya is stoned to death. In the present, the widower informs the journalist that his car is fixed. The mullah and the widower are informed by Ali that his marriage to the teenage girl is off, implying that he could not spare her father from execution. Angry at Ali and the mullah, the widower admits that he lied. As the journalist attempts to leave, the mullah orders a Revolutionary Guard to stop him at gunpoint. They seize his tape recorder and destroy the tapes. Zahra then appears with the true tape in her hand. Men attempt to run after the car as the journalist drives away and escapes. Zahra triumphantly declares that now the whole world will know of the injustice that has happened. ==Cast== * Mozhan Marnò as Soraya Manutchehri * Shohreh Aghdashloo as Zahra * Jim Caviezel as Freidoune Sahebjam * Parviz Sayyad as Hashem * Vida Ghahremani as Mrs. Massoud * Navid Negahban as Ali * Vachik Mangassarian as Morteza Ramazani, Soraya's father * Bita Sheibani as Leila ==Book== The international best-seller book tells the story of one of the victims of stoning in modern Iran. Soraya Manutchehri's husband Ghorban-Ali was an ambitious man, prone to fits of rage. He wanted a way out of his marriage, in order to marry a 14-year-old girl, but did not want to support two families or return Soraya's dowry. When Soraya began cooking for a local widower, he found a way to achieve his goal. Abetted by venal and corrupt village authorities, who also turned her father against her, he accused his wife of adultery. She was convicted, buried up to her waist, and stoned to death. ===Author=== The son of a former Iranian ambassador, French-Iranian journalist and war correspondent Freidoune Sahebjam has also reported on the crimes of the Iranian government against the Bahá'í community in Iran. He was traveling through Iran, when he came upon Soraya's village, where he learned from her aunt about Soraya and her cruel fate. Credibility of Freidoune Sahebjam's story and film plot itself is disputed by many Iranian critics, expert Elise Auerbach from Amnesty International, and film critics like Richard Nilsen from The Arizona Republic and Wesley Morris from Boston Globe. ==ReleaseBox office and financing=== The film's domestic gross was $636,246. It grossed $1,090,260 worldwide. Film received financing led by Mpower Pictures, the company started by President John Shepherd, Stephen McEveety, and Todd Burns.http://www.accentfilm.com/mediakit/1000196.pdf MPower Additional financing came from Blackwater founder Erik Prince. ===Critical reception=== The Stoning of Soraya M. received generally mixed reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives it a 59% approval rating, with an average score of 6 out of 10, based on 86 collected reviews. Its consensus states: \\"The Stoning of Soraya M. nearly transcends its deficiencies through the sheer strength of its subject material, but ultimately drowns out its message with an inappropriately heavy-handed approach.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film an average score of 50 based on 20 reviews, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". ==Accolades== {  style=\\"font-size:90%;\\" ;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! cce;\\" Award ! cce;\\" Category ! cce;\\" Recipients and nominees ! cce;\\" Outcome - rowspan=\\"2\\" Flanders International Film Festival  Canvas Audience Award  -  -  Gran Prix - Best Film  Cyrus Nowrasteh  -  Heartland Film Festival  Heartland Truly Moving Picture Award  Cyrus Nowrasteh  -  Los Angeles Film Festival  Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature  Cyrus Nowrasteh  - rowspan=\\"3\\" Satellite Awards  Best Motion Picture, Drama  -  -  Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Drama  Shohreh Aghdashloo  -  Best Actress in a Supporting Role  Mozhan Marnò  -  Toronto International Film Festival  Runner Up Audience Choice Award  Cyrus Nowrasteh  - Movieguide Awards Faith & Freedom Award for Movies The Stoning of Soraya M.  } ==See also== * Human rights in Iran * Violence against women * 2008 in film * Cinema of the United States * Rajm ==References* * Category:2008 films Category:Iranophobia in film Category:2008 drama films Category:American drama films Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:Persian-language films Category:English-language films Category:Films about capital punishment Category:Adultery in films Category:Anti-Iranian sentiments Category:Capital punishment in Iran Category:Films scored by John Debney Category:Films based on non-fiction books Category:Films set in Iran Category:Films set in the 1980s Category:Iranian-American films Category:Films directed by Cyrus Nowrasteh Category:Roadside Attractions films Category:Women's rights in Iran Category:American films ","title":"The Stoning of Soraya M."},{"id":"19238288","text":"Tennis events were contested at the 1973 Summer Universiade in Moscow, Soviet Union. ==Medal summary== { - Men's Singles    - Men's Doubles    - Women's Singles    - Women's Doubles    - Mixed Doubles    } ==Medal table *World University Games Tennis on HickokSports.com 1973 Universiade Category:1973 Summer Universiade Category:Tennis tournaments in Russia ","title":"Tennis at the 1973 Summer Universiade"},{"id":"19238319","text":"Lev Kublanov (born September 9, 1946) is a modern Russian-American graphic artist. His works are primarily in the realism style, though sometimes with elements of the magic realism. His main subjects are landscapes, still life, and portraits using pen and ink, charcoal, pencil, sepia, gouache and watercolor. ==Life and work== Lev Kublanov was born in Moscow, Russia, and spent his childhood in a historic neighborhood near the Red Square. He graduated from the Moscow Architectural Institute in 1972; he consequently worked for 20 years in various Moscow architectural design firms and became a member of the Architects’ Union of the USSR. He has been a member of the International Union of Architects since 1981. In 1985, tired of designing monotonous mass-apartment buildings and offices, Kublanov left architecture to become a graphic artist. Since then, he has participated in personal and group exhibitions in Russia, Western Europe, and USA. His works can be found in private collections all over the world, including Russia, Austria, Hungary, Germany, USA, Israel, Italy, Poland, France and Japan. While in Moscow, Kublanov's work captured the ancient Moscow spirit, mirroring the reality of the old city: ancient courtyards, quiet streets, and the feeling of everyday life. Kublanov's architectural background gives his work a precision, clearly articulated composition, and the illusion of distance. He does not strive for generalization or for the abstract rather, he allows his emotions and observations to develop a poetic image of his subject. His landscapes are uninhabited but one senses their human creator. His work strikes a responsive chord in all people who find their world being destroyed by modern technology. In 1998, Lev Kublanov and his family moved to Chicago. Being invited to southwest Michigan, he created a series of drawings and watercolors for Schuler’s Restaurant in Stevensville, MI. ==Exhibitions== 20px Moscow, Russia *1987,1993 State Central Library *1987 Cultural Center on Volhonka Street *1988,1992 Nekrasov’s Library *1988,1995,1997 Central House of Architects *1990 Art Center on Kuznetsky *1997 Hotel «Ukraina» *1997 «Peresvetov Pereulok» Gallery *1998 Moscow Division of IBM *1996,1998 Central House of Journalists *1998 Center for Liberal Democracy 20pxFrance *Permanent Exhibition at Art Gallery «Mareschall», Paris 20px Germany *1994 Gallery «Eckes», Nieder-Olm 20px Austria *Permanent Exhibition at Cultural Center of Mondsee *1991,1992 Gallery «Forum», Wels *1993,1994,1997,1999 Gallery of Bank, Kirchdorf 20px United States *1998,1999 Lincoln Terrace Art Studio & Gallery, Skokie, IL *2000 MILLENNIUM Art Gallery, Libertyville, IL *2001 CURTIS FRAME Back Alley Gallery, Libertyville, IL *2000,2001 The Rose Gallery, Chicago, IL *2008 UBU Fine Art Gallery, Chicago, IL ==References== * Tatiana Kuzovleva, \\"At the pale where eternity is a trice: A few strokes to portray Lev Kublanov\\", Weekly magazine \\"Culture\\", #17(7128), May 14–20, 1998 Portal Culture (in Russian) ==Further reading== * Daily Herald, January 16, 2003.

It has been described as \\"one of European football's most bitter rivalries\\".https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45578624 The rivalry is present in a number of different sports but the most intense matches are in football and basketball sections of both clubs. It started immediately after the creation of the two clubs in 1945 and the two clubs have been dominant in domestic football since then. According to a 2007 survey, Red Star is the most popular club in Serbia with almost 50% of the population supporting them. The second most popular is Partizan. They also have many supporters in other former Yugoslav republics and in Serbian diaspora. The football rivalry is highly regarded worldwide as the, or among the, fiercest ones. The highest attendance for a Red Star–Partizan match was about 108,000 spectators at the Red Star Stadium. ==History== { border=1 align=\\"right\\" cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 width=233 style=\\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" -  { border=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\"  align=\\"center\\" vs align=\\"center\\"  } } Both Red Star and Partizan originate in political institutions of the post-World War II Communist Yugoslavia. Red Star was formed on 4 March 1945 by \\"United alliance of anti-fascist Youth\\", part of the new civil authority in Yugoslavia. A few months later, on 4 October 1945, Partizan was founded as the sports association of the Yugoslav People's Army. The first match between these football sections was played on 5 January 1947. Red Star won 4–3 and an intense rivalry has existed ever since. Partizan got its first win in the next derby. On 27 April 1947 Partizan won 1–0. However, the tradition of a fierce Belgrade derby originates in the pre-World War II rivalry between BSK Belgrade and SK Jugoslavija. SK Jugoslavija was disbanded in 1945 and most of its property was attributed to the newly formed Red Star. BSK continued existing although changed its name a number of times being known since 1957 as OFK Beograd, and has lost its strength and its place in the derby to Partizan. Although OFK Beograd was successful, both Red Star and Partizan quickly overtook it in popularity. Over time, from the purely athletic competition for the Yugoslavian Championship became a kind of power struggle between the Interior ministry and the Ministry of Defence . The two clubs were dominant in the post-1945 Yugoslav First League, with Red Star having won 19, and Partizan having won 11 Yugoslav championships. The clashes of these two against Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb, the third and fourth respectively in number of national titles, were similarly intense. The four clubs were known as the big 4. After the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1992, the Belgrade derby further intensified, the two clubs having since then won all national titles except one, with Partizan winning a further 16 and Red Star winning 10 by 2019. ===International=== Red Star has won 2 international, 2 regional and 58 domestic trophies, making them the most successful football club in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia. Partizan participated in one European final, won 42 domestic trophies and also 1 regional trophy. Red Star: International titles – 4 * European Cup/UEFA Champions League ** Winner (1): 1990–91 * UEFA Cup/UEFA Europa League ** Runners-up (1): 1978–79 * Mitropa Cup ** Winner (2): 1958, 1967–68 * Intercontinental Cup/FIFA Club World Cup ** Winner (1): 1991 * UEFA Super Cup: ** Runners-up (1): 1991 Partizan: International titles – 1 * European Cup/UEFA Champions League :* Runners-up (1): 1965–66 * Mitropa Cup ** Winner (1): 1978 ==Supporters== An important aspect of the Belgrade derby are the fans. Both sides prepare intensely between the matches, make large flags and special messages that are appropriate for that particular occasion, to be usually directed towards the opposing side. ===Delije=== 250px Supporters of the various Red Star sports teams are known as Delije (Serbian Cyrillic: Делије, roughly translated to English as Heroes). The word Delije is plural of delija, a word of Turkish origin (deli) that entered the Serbian language during the Ottoman period, meaning brave, strong or handsome young man. The name Delije first began to be used by hardcore Red Star supporters during the late 1980s, with official inauguration taking place on 7 January 1989. Up to that point, the die-hard Red Star fans were scattered amongst 7–8 fan groups that shared the north stand at the Red Star Stadium (known colloquially as Marakana), most prominent of which were Red Devils, Zulu Warriors, and Ultras. As a sign of appreciation the club direction allowed the word Delije in block letters to be written across their stadium's north stand – the gathering point of the club's most loyal and passionate fans. They are also called Cigani (English: Gypsies) by their arch rivals Grobari, fans of Partizan. Although Delije generally consider the name Cigani to be insulting, they occasionally use this name in their own songs and chants. By 2010, Delije consist of four larger groups: Belgrade Boys, Ultra Boys, Heroes, and Brigate. Partizan fans traditionally occupy the southern stands of both stadiums ===Grobari=== Partizan's supporters, known as Grobari (Serbian Cyrillic: Гробари, Gravediggers or Undertakers), were formed in 1970. The origin of the nickname itself is uncertain, but an accepted theory is that it was given by their biggest rivals, the Red Star fans, referring to club's mostly black colours which were similar to the uniforms of cemetery undertakers. The other theory says that the name arrives from the Partizan's stadium street name, Humska (humka meaning \\"grave mound\\"), in actuality named after medieval land of Hum. The first groups of organized Partizan supporters began to visit the JNA stadium in the late 1950s. Partizan's participation in the 1966 European Cup Final attracted much more fans to the stadium and it is considered to be the point when the organized fans moved to the south stand of the stadium, where they gather to this day. During the 1970s the Grobari started bringing fan equipment to the stadiums such as supporting scarves, signs, banners and flares. By the 1980s the Grobari were one of the four main fan groups in SFR Yugoslavia and began touring all Partizan's matches across the country and Europe. Because of their expressed hooliganism toward other clubs' supporters in those times, fans who represented the core of the Grobari firm were often called among themselves \\"Riot Squad\\". They were best known for their English style of supporting, which was mainly based on loud and continuous singing. By 2010, the Grobari consisted of three large groups: Grobari 1970, Zabranjeni and Južni Front. ==Stadiums== When Red Star Belgrade is the host, the derby is played at Rajko Mitić Stadium. Colloquially known as \\"Marakana\\" after the famous Brazilian stadium, it was opened in 1963. Its capacity is 55,000 spectatorsStadion at Red Star official website.

Vijaya Bhaskar. Tarun, Richa Pallod & Sai Kiran Ram debuted with this film as actors in lead roles. It is the Telugu remake of the 1999 Malayalam film Niram directed by Kamal, starring Kunchacko Boban and Shalini. The film was recorded as an Industry Hit at the box office.https://www.imdb.com/list/ls063895902/ The film has also garnered the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu and four South Filmfare Awards.http://www.deccanchronicle.com/tabloids/writers- turn-directors-creative-freedom-757 This film ran for 200 days in 20 centers. It has an all-time record in the history of TFI (Telugu film industry), celebrating a golden jubilee on the 365th day in 6 centres. This movie brought instant stardom to Tarun and Trivikram Srinivas. ==Plot== Tarun (Tarun) and Madhu (Richa Pallod) are childhood best buddies. They were born on the same day, in the same hospital. Even their parents are best friends from their college years and are now neighbors. Tarun and Madhu are inseparable, so much so that they study in the same college in the same class. Everyone knows them to be just friends, except Varsha (Varsha), the innocent and clumsy girl who has an enormous crush on Tarun. She notices his feelings towards Madhu and asks him about that, which he firmly and laughingly denies. Another student Prakash (Sai Kiran Ram), a very talented singer, develops feelings towards Madhu when she spontaneously sings along with him at a college function. He, Madhu and others leave for Bangalore for a week to participate in a few inter- college competitions. As they are apart for the first time in their lives, Tarun starts missing Madhu very badly, but does not understand his feelings. His maid Rukku (Kovai Sarala), who often teases him and Madhu, starts teasing him that he is missing her because he loves her. Slowly, Tarun begins to realize that indeed, he loves her. He buys a gift and greeting card to express himself when she returns. Meanwhile, he sees a girl from his college slapping her friend because he proposed to her. She, in a distressed mood, says that such guys are a shame towards friendship as they pretend to be friends, but really have other intentions. She wishes that every guy could be like Tarun so that a girl and guy could be best friends without any worries. Tarun decides not to express his feelings to Madhu, lest she too react in the same way. Madhu returns from Bangalore and tells Tarun that Prakash proposed to her during their stay. She comes to his room to ask him what to reply and by mistake half opens the drawer in which he kept his greeting card and gift. He hurriedly closes it and asks her not to open that and tells her to agree to the proposal if she likes Prakash. She finally agrees to Prakash's proposal, but later things start to get a little rough as Prakash doesn't like the intimacy Tarun and Madhu share. Soon Prakash's grandmother comes to Madhu's house to set the date for their marriage. Her parents agree and marriage preparations are underway. It is decided that after marriage, Madhu will leave with Prakash to USA where his whole family is settled. It is then that she realises this marriage means breaking her relationship with Tarun and leaving forever. She suddenly dislikes getting married and tries to talk to Tarun about it. He casually says that it is all part of life and inevitable. She asks how can he talk so cold-heartedly. She says she wishes she did not have to leave and wonders why she had to love Prakash. She scolds him why he did not get the idea to love her in the first place. At this point Tarun, ruled by emotions, hugs Madhu and cries and runs away from her. Madhu grows suspicious of his actions and remembers the drawer which he did not let her open. She goes to his room and is shocked to find the card and gift. She says that she does not want to marry Prakash and will tell everyone about them. Tarun firmly refuses, saying that their parents have given them unlimited freedom and it would be very selfish and irresponsible of them to break their trust. At his insistence, she goes through the engagement ceremony. After the engagement, Tarun says that he has to go to a basketball match out of the state and will not be there for the marriage. The parents try to convince him, but he doesn't listen. Madhu gives him a ride to the station and on the way they remember their entire childhood. At the station as Tarun is boarding the train, Madhu weeps and holds him. He is unable to leave. At the house, the maid tells their parents everything and they come to the station. They find Madhu and Tarun on the platform stairs and tell them that what they feel is not wrong and it is the way of the world. They assure the love birds that Madhu's marriage to Prakash will cancelled. ==Cast== * Tarun as Tarun * Richa Pallod as Madhu(Voice dubbed by Savitha Reddy) * Sai Kiran Ram as Prakash * Varsha as Varsha * Kovai Sarala as Rukku, Tarun's maid * Giri Babu * Chalapathi Rao * Sunil * Shankar Melkote * Swapna as Journalist * Sudha * Delhi Rajeswari * Rohit as Prakash's friend (cameo appearance) * Laila in item number * Annapoorna as Prakash's grandmother ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack was composed by Koti.http://www.deccanchronicle.com/tabloids/%E2%80%98i-enjoy-playing- lover-boy%E2%80%99-126 All the tracks were huge hits and were trending at that time.

The superhit track \\"Kallaloki Kallu\\" became an evergreen hit sung by K. S. Chitra and while recording this track, Chitra really emoted at the end of the track by giving soul to the pathos. Koti and film makers accepted the song to respect the soulful expression given by Chitra. ==Box office== The original budget of Nuvve Kavali was only 75 lakh rupees.

Hydroelectric power in New Zealand has been a part of the country's energy system for over 100 years and continues to provide more than half of the country's electricity needs. Hydroelectricity is the primary source of renewable energy in New Zealand. Power is generated the most in the South Island and is used most in the North Island. Early schemes such as the Waipori scheme commissioned in 1903 and the Lake Coleridge power station commissioned in 1914 established New Zealand's use of renewable hydro energy. By the early 1950s, over of installed capacity was from hydro energy. By the early 1960s, most North Island hydro sites had been developed while the South Island still had many potential sites. The commissioning of the HVDC Inter-Island link in 1965 made it possible to send large amounts of electricity between the two islands, and from that time hydro capacity in the South Island increased rapidly. Major developments included the 540 MW Benmore Power Station (1966), the 700 MW Manapouri power station (1971), the 848 MW Upper Waitaki River Scheme (1977–85) and the 432 MW Clyde Dam (1992). By the mid-1990s, hydro capacity had reached over 5,000 MW, and remains around this level today. ==History== The first industrial hydro-electric power plant was established at Bullendale in Otago in 1885, to provide power for a 20 stamp battery at the Phoenix mine. The plant used water from the nearby Skippers Creek, a tributary of the Shotover River. Reefton was the first town with a reticulated public electricity supply from a significant hydroelectric plant after the commissioning of the Reefton Power Station in 1888. They were followed by Stratford in 1890.The Cyclopedia of New Zealand [Taranaki, Hawke's Bay & Wellington Provincial Districts], Electric Light The first hydro-electric power station constructed by the government was the Okere Falls Power Station near Rotorua. The plant began operating in May 1901. Electricity was transmitted at 3300 volts over a route to Rotorua, and was used to drive sewage pumps, and some public buildings including five thermal baths.Martin, J (1998) p. 38-40 During the next twenty years private companies and local authorities established a number of stations, including Waipori in Otago and Horahora on the Waikato River. The first large scheme developed by the government was Coleridge in Canterbury, opened in 1914. Other significant early stations include Mangahao (1924), Arapuni (1929) and Tuai (1929), connected to a single North Island grid in 1934, and Waitaki (1935) in the South Island. The Waikaremoana cascade was completed in the 1940s with Piripāua and Kaitawa stations. A further seven stations were developed as a cascade on the Waikato River from 1953 and 1970. In the 1950s development of the Clutha River with Roxburgh Dam and the upper Waitaki in the MacKenzie Basin with \\"Tekapo A\\" was begun. With commissioning of the HVDC Inter-Island link in 1965, the Waitaki scheme was further expanded with Benmore Power Station (1965), Aviemore Dam (1968), and later Tekapo B, and Ohau A, B and C. In the North Island, the Tongariro Power Scheme was completed between 1964 and 1983. The plan in 1959 to raise the level of Lake Manapouri for hydro-electric development was met with resistance, and the Save Manapouri Campaign became a milestone in environmental awareness. Later hydro schemes, such as the last large hydro to be commissioned, Clyde Dam in 1992, were also controversial. ==Generation== Hydroelectric power accounts for 11% of the total primary energy usage in New Zealand with imported oil and oil products making up 70% of the primary energy. Hydroelectric power accounts for 57% of the total electricity generation in New Zealand. Over the decade from 1997 hydroelectric power as a percentage of total net electricity generated went from 66% down to 55%. An increase in coal and gas for electricity generation accounted for the reduction in hydroelectric power as a percentage of the total. Large hydroelectric power schemes have been built in the Central Plateau region of the North Island and in the MacKenzie Basin in the South Island, as well as a series of power stations on the Waikato River. In 2014, hydro generation produced of electricity, representing 57% of the total electricity generated. The percentage of New Zealand's electricity provided by hydro generation has been between 50% and 60% for the last decade, compared with a high of 84% in 1980. In 2015, the distribution of renewable energy in the total power usage of New Zealand was 80.2%. It ranks second to Norway in countries with official plans to increase renewable power usage to 90% by 2025. This is due to the hydroelectricity expansion from investments in geothermal generation. In general, New Zealand has focused its hydropower production in the South Island and transports energy to the North Island across high voltage wires in a transmission grid. There is a higher demand for energy in the North Island due to several major cities located there. From 2008 to 2018, hydropower has generated almost 60% of total electricity production in New Zealand, with 82% generation from renewable resources. Currently, New Zealand has over 100 hydroelectric power plants in use. From the early 1900s to 2010, there has been a plateau in energy growth for hydroelectric power systems. There is room to expand on the current hydropower scales in New Zealand, however the industry will not change as drastically as it has in the 20th century. Small unit growth and large run-of-river plants are the most prominent examples for future hydroelectric developments. Many other renewable energy resources are competitors to hydroelectric because they are less expensive. There are several barriers that prevent the development of hydroelectricity in New Zealand, including cost, geography, and systematic factors. For example, New Zealand hydroelectric systems are low in storage volume. This means that maximum storage of energy is 34 days during the peak of winter. If there is an unusual amount of precipitation one year, then there would be a shortfall in energy from the hydro system. In addition, the cost benefit of using hydroelectric power over wind or geothermal energy in New Zealand is highly debated. ==Proposed projects== There are a number of proposed hydroelectric power projects in New Zealand and, despite the demand for more renewable energy, there is opposition to some new hydroelectric projects. * Project Aqua was a large scheme proposed by Meridian Energy on the Waitaki River but was dropped after significant opposition. The North Bank tunnel concept is a new proposal being developed by Meridian Energy for a hydroelectric power scheme on the river.North Bank Tunnel Concept, Meridian Energy, 2008. * The Wairau Hydro Scheme is a canal and power station scheme, for which TrustPower was granted resource consents in August 2008. This project is opposed by Green Party. * TrustPower proposes to develop a 46MW extension to the Arnold Power Station on the West Coast. Resource consents were granted in November 2008. Other proposals, at various planning stages, include schemes on the Matakitaki, Matiri, Waimakariri, Clutha, Kaituna and the Gowan Rivers. In 2011, the New Zealand Energy Strategy (NZES) and New Zealand Energy Efficiency and Conservation Strategy (NZEECS) were developed by the government to establish the main priorities of future hydroelectric power development. In 2016, the electric vehicle program was implemented. This program aims to double the number of electric vehicles used each year, with a target of 64,000 electric cars by 2021. ==Environmental issues== There has been opposition to hydroelectric power on environmental grounds for many decades. The first nationwide environmental campaign in New Zealand was opposition to raising Lake Manapouri for a power station to supply electricity to an aluminium smelter. The Save Manapouri Campaign was a success and the power station was built without raising the level of lake outside of its natural range. The highly endangered black stilt, which nests on the braided rivers beds of the South Island, is threatened by changes in river flows as a result of new hydro dams and changes in flow regimes for existing dams. The Upper Waitaki Power Development posed a threat to the black stilt habitat and a programme was set up to lessen the threats. Because of opposition to new HEP stations New Zealand's demand for increased power has been met from coal and gas fired power stations. Engineers have fine tuned some HEP stations such as at Tokaanu to increase output by 20% with the same water use. ==See also== *Biofuel in New Zealand *Electricity sector in New Zealand *Energy in New Zealand *Geothermal power in New Zealand *List of power stations in New Zealand *List of renewable energy topics by country and territory *Ocean power in New Zealand *Renewable energy commercialization *Renewable energy in New Zealand *Solar hot water in New Zealand *Solar power in New Zealand *Wind power in New Zealand ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== *Ministry of Economic Development - Electricity page ","title":"Hydroelectric power in New Zealand"},{"id":"19238508","text":"Tennis events were contested at the 1983 Summer Universiade in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. ==Medal summary== { - Men's Singles    - Men's Doubles    - Women's Singles    - Women's Doubles    - Mixed Doubles    } ==Medal table *World University Games Tennis on HickokSports.com 1983 Universiade Category:1983 Summer Universiade ","title":"Tennis at the 1983 Summer Universiade"},{"id":"19238509","text":"The Cuautitlan Stamping and Assembly Plant (CSAP) is a Ford Motor Company manufacturing facility located in Cuautitlán Izcalli, Mexico.

The film is a loose adaptation of The Laughing Matter, a 1953 novel by Armenian-American writer William Saroyan. It stars Konstantin Lavronenko and Maria Bonnevie. The film premiered at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. Lavronenko won the Best Actor award at the festival. It was released in Russian cinemas on 2 October 2007. The film received mixed reviews from critics. ==Plot== In the film's opening scene, Mark comes to Alex's house for help removing a bullet from his arm. Mark is concerned about the dangers of going to a hospital because of his criminal affiliations and the police inquiries which would result from going to a public hospital. Mark recovers and in the following days, Alex brings his wife Vera and two children for a trip to his childhood home in the countryside. The tranquility of the countryside is broken when Vera tells Alex that she is pregnant, but that this baby is not his. The rift between the couple grows but the two try to keep up appearances in the presence of their children and the old friends that visit them. Alex is unsure about what to do and turns to his brother Mark for advice. On the way to meet Mark at the train station, Alex's son Kir reveals that Alex's young friend Robert was at their house one day while Alex was away for work. Alex concludes that Robert is the baby's father. Vera feels estranged from her husband, and fears that Kir will follow in Alex and Mark's criminal footsteps. In the end, Alex forces Vera to have an abortion hoping they will be able to re-build their relationship and save their marriage once this unborn baby is out of the way. While their children are at a friend's house, he gets Mark to use his criminal connections to find a doctor to perform the procedure in their own house. After the abortion Vera commits suicide by overdosing on pain relieving medication. Alex and Mark rush the funeral formalities as gossip spreads quickly in the countryside. After returning home from the funeral parlour, Mark has a serious heart attack. Against the advice of the doctor, he attends Vera's funeral but dies before he and his brother return home. Alex returns to the city alone and goes to Robert's house with the intention of killing him. Alex falls asleep in his car outside the house and is awoken by Robert who invites him in. As he retrieves the gun from the glove box, he discovers an envelope containing the results of Vera's pregnancy test and a letter written by Vera on the back. The film cuts to a flashback of the time Robert came to Alex's home while he was away. It is revealed that the day before, Vera attempted to commit suicide by overdosing on pills but is saved by Robert. The next day, Vera finds out she is pregnant and confides with Robert, revealing that she never had an affair and that the baby was in fact Alex's, even though she says it felt like it wasn't his as they hardly ever talk. She expressed concerns about having another baby in this relationship that was lacking communication. ==Cast== * Konstantin Lavronenko as Alex * Maria Bonnevie as Vera, Alex's wife * Aleksandr Baluev as Mark, Alex's brother * Maksim Shibayev as Kir, Alex's son * Katya Kulkina as Eva, Alex's daughter * Dmitri Ulyanov as Robert, Alex's friend and co-worker ==Production== Director Andrey Zvyagintsev said the project took him nearly three years to complete, starting from when he first thought about the plot. The film's screenplay was presented to Zvyagintsev by Artyom Melkumian, an Armenian friend of his who worked as a television cameraman. Melkumian loved William Saroyan's The Laughing Matter and spent ten years adapting the novel. Originally, the script had a lot of dialogue but Zvyagintsev said that when he started testing it with actors \\"it was a disaster\\" and had to remorselessly cut the dialogue. \\"The long dialogue would be impossible to film in a satisfying way. It would be very difficult for the actors to hold the viewers' attention for that long,\\" said Zvyagintsev. Zvyagintsev said \\"The entire success of the film depends on the cast. So I spend a long time finding exactly the right people. I always have an image of a particular character in mind, and then audition many actors and keep comparing the essence of the character with the essence of the people I meet. When the virtual and the real characters almost coincide, I know I've found my actor.\\" Zvyagintsev tried to avoid casting Konstantin Lavronenko who played a lead role in his previous film, The Return, but said \\"In the end I couldn't find anyone else who could be his equal.\\" Zvyagintsev postponed filming and waited twelve months for actress Maria Bonnevie who had a year-long contract with the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. The film had 103 shooting days in four different countries—France, Belgium, Moldova and Russia. The city exterior scenes were filmed in historically industrial towns of Belgium and northern France: Charleroi, Roubaix and Tourcoing. The house, the railway station, the church, the cemetery and the wooden bridge next to the house were purposefully built on location near Cahul, Moldova. A shot involving a donkey which only lasts several seconds on screen took the crew half a day to film and used three cans of film. Zvyagintsev joked, \\"Now I say will never work with animals again.\\" Zvyagintsev intentionally removed cultural references to the time and setting of the film. Special attention was paid to architecture, signs and the vehicles. Finnish bank notes were altered to make them look more abstract and a French sign was digitally removed in post-production. ==Reception== The film received mixed reviews from critics. Based on 20 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, The Banishment has an overall approval rating from critics of 65%, with an average score of 5.1/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Beautifully shot, but ultimately disappointing, lumbering sophomore effort from Russian potential great Andrey Zvyagintsev\\".On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 59 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\"https://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-banishment/ \\"The Banishment David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph called the film \\"a mythic masterpiece\\" and that \\"The Banishment confirms Zvyagintsev as a director of world stature.\\" Film critic Patrick Z. McGavin said \\"the movie requires extraordinary patience, and those inclined to surrender to the film's heavy mood and elusive rhythm are bound to experience a significant revelation.\\" The film's narrative has been described as \\"frustrating\\" and \\"suffers from structural problems.\\" Sight & Sound said \\"the film's dramatic narrative twist is clumsily rendered. Intended to disorientate, it comes over as contrived.\\" The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw criticized the film's open-ended nature and how it left questions unanswered saying, \\"there is an outstanding film somewhere inside this sprawling mass of ideas, which might have been shaped more exactingly in the edit.\\" The cinematography by Mikhail Krichman received great praise from most critics. Its slow pace and long running time divided critics, having been described as \\"at times a painfully slow film\\" and \\"it slips gently by, holding the attention in an iron grip.\\" Anton Bitel said \\"the viewer's patience is rewarded with exquisite painterly images, some unexpectedly rapid developments and a truly bleak vision of human error and its consequences.\\" The film drew frequent comparisons to the works of Andrei Tarkovsky, as well as visually referencing Ingmar Bergman, Robert Bresson, and Michelangelo Antonioni. Birgit Beumers of KinoKultura criticized this aspect of the film, stating \\"these quotations are obtrusive and too obvious\\" while Neil Young's Film Lounge concurred, stating \\"Zvyagintsev has ended up merely aping the cinematic giants who have come before him.\\" Empire's David Parkinson said the film \\"feels more like a ciné dissertation designed to showcase Zvyagintsev's appreciation of the medium than an original piece of cinema.\\" Konstantin Lavronenko won the Best Actor award at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival for his performance in the film. ==See also== * 2007 in film * Cinema of Russia * Russian films of 2007 ==References* The Banishment at Sight & Sound Category:2007 films Category:Films about abortion Category:Russian films Category:Russian-language films Category:Films directed by Andrey Zvyagintsev Category:Films shot in France Category:Films shot in Belgium Category:Films shot in Russia Category:Films shot in Moldova ","title":"The Banishment"},{"id":"19238603","text":"Tennis events were contested at the 1987 Summer Universiade in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. ==Medal summary== { - Men's Singles    - Men's Doubles    - Women's Singles    - Women's Doubles    - Mixed Doubles    } ==Medal table *World University Games Tennis on HickokSports.com 1987 Universiade Category:1987 Summer Universiade Category:Tennis in Yugoslavia ","title":"Tennis at the 1987 Summer Universiade"},{"id":"19238607","text":"The Mount Dora Center for the Arts is located at 138 East Fifth Avenue, Mount Dora, Florida.

After being admitted to the bar, he and Edward Bates, Missouri's first attorney general, formed a law firm. Barton was the first Secretary of State, but resigned to become district attorney of St. Louis, Missouri. ==Duelist== In 1816, he fought a duel with Thomas Hempstead, brother of Edward Hempstead, Missouri's first representative to Congress. Bates was his second. Thomas Hart Benton was Hempstead's second. The duel ended in no bloodshed. In 1817, he was second to Charles Lucas in two duels with Benton. After having been wounded the first time, Lucas was killed during the second duel. In 1823, David Barton opposed the reappointment of William Rector as Surveyor General for Missouri, Illinois and Arkansas, saying that Rector was hiring his relatives as surveyors and overpaying his surveyors. Rector had overseen the surveying the Louisiana Purchase, including the establishment of the Beginning Point of the Louisiana Purchase Survey.Baker, Lea Flowers; et al. \\"Survey of the Louisiana Purchase in 1815\\" (PDF) (lesson plan). Department of Arkansas Heritage, Arkansas Natural and Cultural Resources Council. Retrieved September 8, 2008. William Rector had previously been hired to survey the location route of the Buffalo Trace before an Indian treaty line was established. Joshua Barton made the charges in a letter signed \\"Philo\\" to the weekly newspaper the St. Louis Republican. Rector's brother, Thomas Rector, contacted the paper and found out that Barton had written the letter and challenged him to a duel. They met at 6 p.m. on June 30, 1823, on Bloody Island (where the previous duels had occurred). Barton was killed instantly, while Thomas Rector was not hurt. Rector died in 1825 in a knife fight in St. Louis. President James Monroe did not reappoint William Rector. ==References== Category:1792 births Category:1823 deaths Category:Secretaries of State of Missouri Category:Politicians from St. Louis Category:Deaths by firearm in Missouri Category:Duelling fatalities Category:American politicians killed in duels Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Joshua Barton"},{"id":"19238649","text":"Tennis events were contested at the 1991 Summer Universiade in Sheffield, United Kingdom. ==Medal summary== { - Men's Singles    - Men's Doubles    - Women's Singles    - Women's Doubles    - Mixed Doubles    } ==Medal table *World University Games Tennis on HickokSports.com 1991 Universiade Category:1991 Summer Universiade ","title":"Tennis at the 1991 Summer Universiade"},{"id":"19238652","text":"Gruhn Guitars is a musical instrument shop and place of interest located in Nashville, Tennessee.

Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court decision holding that the plaintiff, Adolph Lyons, lacked standing to challenge the city police department's use of chokeholds. ==Background== In 1976, Adolph Lyons was stopped by four white officers of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for driving with a broken tail light. The unarmed 24-year-old was ordered to leave his vehicle by officers with guns drawn and to spread his legs and put his hands on top of his head. After being frisked, Lyons put his hands down. That prompted one officer to grab his hands and slam them against his head. When Lyons complained that holding his car keys was causing him pain, a police officer put him in a chokehold until he lost consciousness. He woke up lying face down in the road with soiled underwear and blood and dirt in his mouth. The officers gave him a traffic citation and sent him on his way. Seven years later, he sought both compensatory damages for the chokehold and declaratory and injunctive relief against the LAPD's chokehold policy (he introduced evidence from 1975 to 1983 that 16 people, including 12 African-Americans, had been killed by the LAPD using chokeholds. ==Decision== In an opinion authored by Justice White, the Court held 5-4 that Lyons had failed to allege a sufficiently-plausible threat of future injury to have standing to seek an injunction. Lyons, however, had standing for his damages action since it was retrospective and the injury, being subjected to the chokehold, was concrete and particular. The decision helped to establish the principle that a plaintiff must meet a standing requirement for each form of relief sought. ==Dissenting opinion== Justice Marshall's dissent argued that the majority's test would immunize from review any widespread policy that deprives constitutional rights when individuals cannot show with certainty that they would be subject to a repeat violation. He also argued that the Court's traditional rule did not distinguish different forms of relief for standing purposes. ==Commentary== Based on Michelle Alexander's book The New Jim Crow Lyons' case is related to what is believed to be biased action towards certain races, in this case African-Americans. She asserts that it is hard for people of color like Lyons to prevail in the judicial process, like during the Jim Crow era. According to Alexander, one of the causes of such issues is the presence of implicit bias in the criminal justice system, including the courts and police officers. In support of Alexander's argument, Georgetown Law provides Professor Charles Lawrence noted, \\"The purposeful intent requirement found in Supreme Court equal protection doctrine, and in the court's interpretation of antidiscrimination laws disserved the value of equal citizenship expressed in those laws because many forms of racial bias are unconscious.\\" As specified above, since Lyons' case involves legal system, unconscious bias may produce negative outcomes for African-Americans.The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, Michelle Alexander, The New Press, New York 2010, The New Jim Crow, p. 128-129 ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 461 ==ReferencesRonald T.

Introduced to consolidate the medium-duty IHC Loadstar and heavy-duty IHC Fleetstar into a single product range, the S series was slotted below the Transtar and Paystar Class 8 conventionals. The IHC S series was produced in a number of variants for a wide variety of applications, including straight trucks, semitractors, vocational trucks, and severe-service trucks. Additionally, the S series was produced in other body configurations, including a four-door crew cab, cutaway cab, cowled chassis, and a stripped chassis (primarily for school buses). The chassis was produced with both gasoline and diesel powertrains (the latter exclusively after 1986), single or tandem rear axles, and two, four, or, six-wheel drive layouts. The last complete product line designed within the existence of International Harvester, the S series was produced in its original form through 1989. During 1989, the S-Series underwent a major revision and was split into multiple model lines. After 2001, International phased in product lines based upon the \\"NGV\\" architecture; severe-service and bus chassis variants produced through 2003 and 2004, respectively. == Previous use of name == 1956 International Harvester S100 The S-series model designation was first used by International Harvester during the 1950s. During 1955 production, the R series model family underwent an update, with International renaming its light-duty and medium- duty trucks the S-series. The model designation was used through 1957, when International introduced the A-series model family as an all-new design. == First generation (S series; 1978–1989) == Navistar 2500 in use as a municipal service truck. In April 1977, International Harvester unveiled the medium-duty S series at an event at the New Orleans Superdome.Crismon, p. 485 The initial lineup consisted of heavier-duty 2200, 2500, and 2600 models (28,000-45,000 lb GVW), replacing the Fleetstar. In the summer of 1978,Crismon, p. 492 lighter- GVWR models (replacing the Loadstar) were released for sale. The 21 models of the full lineup had a high degree of parts interghangability, this standardisation helped lower the number of parts used by thirty percent. Following the discontinuation of the IHC pickup-truck line in 1975, the S series was designed with a model-specific cab, replacing the pickup-truck cab used for the Loadstar (designed for the 1957 A series). More vertically- oriented than its predecessor, the design was much wider as well. To lower maintenance costs, all windows in the cab were designed with flat glass, including the windshield. Similar in style to the tilting hood introduced for the Loadstar in 1972, all S-series trucks were given a tilting fiberglass hood. The S series would be produced throughout the 1980s largely unmodified. 1987 would mark several changes to the S-series trucks. To reflect the corporate change of the company from International Harvester to Navistar International, S-series trucks saw changes in their badging (alongside all International vehicles). On the grille, the word \\"International\\" across the top of the grille was replaced by a red Navistar \\"diamond\\" logo alongside \\"International\\" in red at the bottom left of the grille. Inside, the IHC \\"tractor\\" logo on the steering wheel was replaced by a Navistar diamond logo. In a major shift, for 1987, International became the first truck manufacturer to produce a medium-duty product line powered exclusively by diesel engines. === Models === Originally intended to use the International Tristar nameplate, the S series consolidated the aging Loadstar and Fleetstar trucks under a single product line. Tandem-axle (6x4) versions of the S series were named F-series trucks.Crismon, p. 495 Class 6 trucks  The S1600, S1700, S1800, and S1900 were introduced in 1979. Replacing the International Harvester Loadstar model line, the model was produced in a number of configurations, with single and tandem rear axles, 4x4/6x6 drive options, and gasoline and diesel engines. The S-1800 and S-1900-were produced as both semitractors and straight trucks, while the S-1700 and S-1800 were used in the production of International Harvester bus chassis (primarily for school bus use).  Class 7-8 trucks  Introduced in 1978 as the replacement for the Fleetstar, the S2100 and S2200 were joined by the severe-service S2500 and S2600, slotted below the International Paystar 5000. Configured primarily as tractors, the S2100 was fitted with a sloped hood. To accommodate larger-bore diesel engines under a standard-length hood, the S2200 was fitted with a widened cab (distinguished by a two-piece windshield). In 1982, the S2300 was introduced; the model line was essentially an S2100 with International diesel engines replaced with Cummins-sourced powertrains. 1978–1983 models {  !Model !!

While the cab structure was retained, the interior and exterior underwent a complete redesign. To optimize aerodynamics, the model line was given a lower hoodline and closer-fitting fenders (with halogen headlamps and wraparound turn signals). An all-new dashboard received a redesigned instrument panel along with a two-spoke steering wheel. During its production life, the second- generation vehicles saw few major changes. From 1989 to its 2001 discontinuation, the exterior remained nearly unchanged; in 1992, International changed the design of the instrument panel, updating the entire interior in 1995. === Models === International 8100 4x2 tractor towing solar panels For 1989, International split the S-series model line into three distinct model families, all sharing the same cab structure. The 4000 series was the medium-duty truck range (the 3000 series bus chassis replaced the \\"Schoolmaster\\"), with the 7100/8100 serving as the Class 7/8 tractor series. The 2500/2600 severe-service truck were carried over, dropping their S-series badging prefix.  Class 5-7 trucks  Replacing the S1600 through S1900, the 4000 series was again produced in a number of configurations, with single and tandem rear axles, 4x4/6x6 drive options. Produced exclusively with diesel engines, the 4000 series was produced with the IDI V8 and DT360/DT466 engines. The 4000 series was produced through 2001, when it was replaced by an all-new 4000 series (now the International DuraStar).  Class 7-8 trucks  Replacing the S2100 and S2300, the 7100 and 8100 were introduced in 1989; the wide-body S2200 was not replaced. Configured nearly exclusively as tractors, the 8000 series was powered by the Cummins L10 diesel; the 7100 was a variant powered by the DT466. The 8000 series was produced through 2001, when it was replaced by an all-new 8000 series (now the International Transtar).  Severe-service trucks  Again slotted below the Paystar, the 2500 and 2600 severe-service trucks dropped their S-series prefix. During the 1990s, the set-back axle 2674 was restyled with the aerodynamic hood of the 8300. The 2500/2600 remained in production through 2003, outlasted only by the 3800 school-bus chassis. {  !Model !! Replaced !!

While used primarily for yellow school buses in the United States and Canada, the S series also was used outside of North America as a basis to produce other types of bus bodies. Introduced in 1979, the bus variant of the S series would be one of the final models designed by International Harvester before its transition to Navistar. In 1989, the S-series bus chassis was rechristened the 3000 series with the fitment of the new-generation Navistar cowl.

A donor portrait or votive portrait is a portrait in a larger painting or other work showing the person who commissioned and paid for the image, or a member of his, or (much more rarely) her, family. Donor portrait usually refers to the portrait or portraits of donors alone, as a section of a larger work, whereas votive portrait may often refer to a whole work of art intended as an ex-voto, including for example a Madonna, especially if the donor is very prominent. The terms are not used very consistently by art historians, as Angela Marisol Roberts points out,Roberts, pp. 1–3, 22 and may also be used for smaller religious subjects that were probably made to be retained by the commissioner rather than donated to a church. Donor portraits are very common in religious works of art, especially paintings, of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, the donor usually shown kneeling to one side, in the foreground of the image. Often, even late into the Renaissance, the donor portraits, especially when of a whole family, will be at a much smaller scale than the principal figures, in defiance of linear perspective. By the mid-15th century donors began to be shown integrated into the main scene, as bystanders and even participants. ==Placement== Male side panel of Hans Memling's Triptych of Wilhelm Moreel; the father is supported by his patron saint, with his five sons behind him. The central panel is here. The purpose of donor portraits was to memorialize the donor and his family, and especially to solicit prayers for them after their death.See particularly Roberts, 22–24 for a review of the historiography as to the motivations of donors Gifts to the church of buildings, altarpieces, or large areas of stained glass were often accompanied by a bequest or condition that masses for the donor be said in perpetuity, and portraits of the persons concerned were thought to encourage prayers on their behalf during these, and at other times. Displaying portraits in a public place was also an expression of social status; donor portraits overlapped with tomb monuments in churches, the other main way of achieving these ends, although donor portraits had the advantage that the donor could see them displayed in his own lifetime. Female side of Memling's Triptych of Wilhelm Moreel, the mother, Barbara Van Hertsvelde is supported by her patron saint, with her eleven daughters behind her.James WEALE, Généalogie de la famille Morales, in Le Beffroi, 1864–1865, pp 179–196. The central panel is here. Furthermore, donor portraits in Early Netherlandish painting suggest that their additional purpose was to serve as role models for the praying beholder during his own emotional meditation and prayer – not in order to be imitated as ideal persons like the painted Saints but to serve as a mirror for the recipient to reflect on himself and his sinful status, ideally leading him to a knowledge of himself and God.Scheel, Johanna, Das altniederländische Stifterbild. Emotionsstrategien des Sehens und der Selbsterkenntnis, pp. 172–180, 241–249, Gebr. Mann, Berlin, 2013 To do so during prayer is in accord with late medieval concepts of prayer, fully developed by the Modern Devotion. This process may be intensified if the praying beholder is the donor himself.Scheel, Johanna, Das altniederländische Stifterbild. Emotionsstrategien des Sehens und der Selbsterkenntnis,pp. 317–318, Gebr. Mann, Berlin, 2013 When a whole building was financed, a sculpture of the patron might be included on the facade or elsewhere in the building. Jan van Eyck's Rolin Madonna is a small painting where the donor Nicolas Rolin shares the painting space equally with the Madonna and Child, but Rolin had given great sums to his parish church, where it was hung, which is represented by the church above his praying hands in the townscape behind him.Harbison, Craig, Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism, pp.112, Reaktion Books, London, 1991, Sometimes, as in the Ghent Altarpiece, the donors were shown on the closed view of an altarpiece with movable wings, or on both the side panels, as in the Portinari Altarpiece and the Memlings above, or just on one side, as in the Merode Altarpiece. If they are on different sides, the males are normally on the left for the viewer, the honorific right-hand placement within the picture space. In family groups the figures are usually divided by gender. Groups of members of confraternities, sometimes with their wives, are also found.In fact half of the 83 14th-century Venetian images, in what is intended to be a complete catalogue by Roberts, are of this group type. Roberts, 32 Additional family members, from births or marriages, might be added later, and deaths might be recorded by the addition of small crosses held in the clasped hands.Ainsworth, Maryan W. \\"Intentional Alterations of Early Netherlandish Painting\\". In Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. Accessed September 10, 2008 At least in Northern Italy, as well as the grand altarpieces and frescos by leading masters that attract most art-historical attention, there was a more numerous group of small frescoes with a single saint and donor on side-walls, that were liable to be re-painted as soon as the number of candles lit before them fell off, or a wealthy donor needed the space for a large fresco-cycle, as portrayed in a 15th-century tale from Italy:Roberts, 16–19. Quote on p. 19, note 63, from I Motti e facezie del Piovano Arlotto a popular 15th-century compilation of comic stories attributed to the real Piovano Arlotto, a priest of Pratolino near Florence. > And going around with the master mason, examining which figures to leave and > which to destroy, the priest spotted a Saint Anthony and said: 'Save this > one.' Then he found a figure of Saint Sano and said: 'This one is to be > gotten rid of, since as long as I have been the Priest here I have never > seen anyone light a candle in front of it, nor has it ever seemed to me > useful; therefore, mason, get rid of it.' ==History== 13th-century frescoes from Milan: Madonna and Child, Saint Ambrose, and the donor Bonamico Taverna) Donor portraits have a continuous history from late antiquity, and the portrait in the 6th-century manuscript the Vienna Dioscurides may well reflect a long-established classical tradition, just as the author portraits found in the same manuscript are believed to do. A painting in the Catacombs of Commodilla of 528 shows a throned Virgin and Child flanked by two saints, with Turtura, a female donor, in front of the left hand saint, who has his hand on her shoulder; very similar compositions were being produced a millennium later.Handbook, 67 Another tradition which had pre-Christian precedent was royal or imperial images showing the ruler with a religious figure, usually Christ or the Virgin Mary in Christian examples, with the divine and royal figures shown communicating with each other in some way. Although none have survived, there is literary evidence of donor portraits in small chapels from the Early Christian period,Early Christian Chapels in the West: Decoration, Function and Patronage, pp. 97–99; Gillian Vallance Mackie, Gillian Mackie; University of Toronto Press, 2003, probably continuing the traditions of pagan temples. The 6th-century mosaic panels in the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna of the Emperor Justinian I and Empress Theodora with courtiers are not of the type showing the ruler receiving divine approval, but each show one of the imperial couple standing confidently with a group of attendants, looking out at the viewer. Their scale and composition are alone among large-scale survivals. Also in Ravenna, there is a small mosaic of Justinian, possibly originally of Theoderic the Great in the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo. In the Early Middle Ages, a group of mosaic portraits in Rome of Popes who had commissioned the building or rebuilding of the churches containing them show standing figures holding models of the building, usually among a group of saints. Gradually these traditions worked their way down the social scale, especially in illuminated manuscripts, where they are often owner portraits, as the manuscripts were retained for use by the person commissioning them. For example, a chapel at Mals in South Tyrol has two fresco donor figures from before 881, one lay and the other of a tonsured cleric holding a model building.Dodwell, 46 In subsequent centuries bishops, abbots and other clergy were the donors most commonly shown, other than royalty, and they remained prominently represented in later periods.Roberts, 5–19 reviews the tradition Donor portraits of noblemen and wealthy businessmen were becoming common in commissions by the 15th century, at the same time as the panel portrait was beginning to be commissioned by this class - though there are perhaps more donor portraits in larger works from churches surviving from before 1450 than panel portraits. A very common Netherlandish format from the mid-century was a small diptych with a Madonna and Child, usually on the left wing, and a \\"donor\\" on the right - the donor being here an owner, as these were normally intended to be kept in the subject's home. In these the portrait may adopt a praying pose, or may pose more like the subject in a purely secular portrait.Example from NGA Washington The Wilton Diptych of Richard II of England was a forerunner of these. In some of these diptychs the portrait of the original owner has been over-painted with that of a later one.John Oliver Hand, Catherine Metzger, Ron Spronk; Prayers and Portraits: Unfolding the Netherlandish Diptych, cat no 40, (National Gallery of Art (U.S.), Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten (Belgium)), Yale University Press, 2006, - a diptych in the Fogg Museum Harvard A particular convention in illuminated manuscripts was the \\"presentation portrait\\", where the manuscript began with a figure, often kneeling, presenting the manuscript to its owner, or sometimes the owner commissioning the book. The person presenting might be a courtier making a gift to his prince, but is often the author or the scribe, in which cases the recipient had actually paid for the manuscript.Burgundian frontispieces ==Iconography of painted donor figures== Crucifixion by Albrecht Altdorfer, c. 1514, with a tiny donor couple among the feet of the main figures. Altdorfer was one of the last major artists to retain this convention. During the Middle Ages the donor figures often were shown on a far smaller scale than the sacred figures; a change dated by Dirk Kocks to the 14th century, though earlier examples in manuscripts can be found.King, 129. See further reading for Kocks. A later convention was for figures at about three-quarters of the size of the main ones. From the 15th century Early Netherlandish painters like Jan van Eyck integrated, with varying degrees of subtlety, donor portraits into the space of the main scene of altarpieces, at the same scale as the main figures. A comparable style can be found in Florentine painting from the same date, as in Masaccio's Holy Trinity (1425–28) in Santa Maria Novella where, however, the donors are shown kneeling on a sill outside and below the main architectural setting.King, 131 This innovation, however, did not appear in Venetian painting until the turn of the next century.Penny, 110, discussing this. and another example by Marco Marziale Normally the main figures ignore the presence of the interlopers in narrative scenes, although bystanding saints may put a supportive hand on the shoulder in a side-panel. But in devotional subjects such as a Madonna and Child, which were more likely to have been intended for the donor's home, the main figures may look at or bless the donor, as in the Memling shown. Before the 15th century a physical likeness may not have often been attempted, or achieved; the individuals depicted may in any case often not have been available to the artist, or even alive.Memling seems to have replaced a generalized portrait of the wife of Sir John Donne with a more personal one, perhaps after Lady Donne travelled to Bruges, or a drawing was made in Calais for him. See the entry for the painting in National Gallery Catalogues: The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Paintings by Lorne Campbell, 1998, , , , , (also titled The Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Schools) By the mid-15th century this was no longer the case, and donors of whom other likenesses survive can often be seen to be carefully portrayed, although, as in the Memling above, daughters in particular often appear as standardized beauties in the style of the day.The elder sons also seem very like younger versions of their father's portrait Presentation of Christ, ca 1470. Standing alongside the Holy Family, the two fashionably dressed girls, and probably the young man on the right, are donor portraits.J.O. Hand & M. Wolff, Early Netherlandish Painting, pp. 155–161, National Gallery of Art, Washington(catalogue)/Cambridge UP, 1986, . The girls' mother may be in a Nativity in Birmingham, if it is indeed from the same altarpiece. Washington attribute the work to the \\"Master of the Prado Adoration of the Magi\\", but note that many attribute the girls alone to Rogier van der Weyden, the other's master. In narrative scenes they began to be worked into the figures of the scene depicted, perhaps an innovation of Rogier van der Weyden, where they can often be distinguished by their expensive contemporary dress. In Florence, where there was already a tradition of including portraits of city notables in crowd scenes (mentioned by Leon Battista Alberti), the Procession of the Magi by Benozzo Gozzoli (1459–61), which admittedly was in the private chapel of the Palazzo Medici, is dominated by the glamorous procession containing more portraits of the Medici and their allies than can now be identified. By 1490, when the large Tornabuoni Chapel fresco cycle by Domenico Ghirlandaio was completed, family members and political allies of the Tornabuoni populate several scenes in considerable numbers, in addition to conventional kneeling portraits of Giovanni Tornabuoni and his wife.Paola Tinagli, Women in Italian Renaissance Art: Gender, Representation, Identity, Manchester University Press, pp. 64–72 1997, , discusses the donor portraits in the cycle in detail (especially the female ones) In an often-quoted passage, John Pope-Hennessy caricatured 16th-century Italian donors:John Pope-Hennessy (see Further reading), 22–23, quoted in Roberts, 27,note 83. Sentence on Suzannah from Berger & Berger, here In Italy donors, or owners, were rarely depicted as the major religious figures, but in the courts of Northern Europe there are several examples of this in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, mostly in small panels not for public viewing.Campbell, 3–4, & 137 The most notorious of these is the portrayal as the Virgin lactans (or just post-lactans) of Agnès Sorel (died 1450), the mistress of Charles VII of France, in a panel by Jean Fouquet.Campbell, 3–4 Gian Lorenzo Bernini's \\"Ecstasy of St. Theresa\\", Santa Maria della Vittoria, Rome. Donor portraits in works for churches, and over- prominent heraldry, were disapproved of by clerical interpreters of the vague decrees on art of the Council of Trent, such as Saint Charles Borromeo,Penny, 108 but survived well into the Baroque period, and developed a secular equivalent in history painting, although here it was often the principal figures who were given the features of the commissioner. A very late example of the old Netherlandish format of the triptych with the donors on the wing panels is Rubens' Rockox Triptych of 1613–15, once in a church over the tombstone of the donors and now in the Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp. The central panel shows the Incredulity of Thomas (\\"Doubting Thomas\\") and the work as a whole is ambiguous as to whether the donors are represented as occupying the same space as the sacred scene, with different indications in both directions.Jacobs, 311–312 A further secular development was the portrait historié, where groups of portrait sitters posed as historical or mythological figures. One of the most famous and striking groups of Baroque donor portraits are those of the male members of the Cornaro family, who sit in boxes as if at the theatre to either side of the sculpted altarpiece of Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Ecstasy of St Theresa (1652). These were derived from frescoes by Pellegrino Tibaldi a century early, which use the same conceit.Shearman, 182. The frescoes are in the Poggi Chapel, in San Giacomo Maggiore, Bologna. Although donor portraits have been relatively little studied as a distinct genre, there has been more interest in recent years, and a debate over their relationship, in Italy, to the rise of individualism with the Early Renaissance, and also over the changes in their iconography after the Black Death of the mid-14th century.Roberts, 20–24 ==Gallery== File:Pope Honorius I - Apse mosaic - Sant'Agnese fuori le mura - Rome 2016.jpgPope Honorius I (died 638), mosaic in Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura in Rome, carrying a model of the church he built.

One may be a decrease in the level of circulating factor X, a clotting factor necessary for coagulation. The proposed mechanism for this decrease in factor X is that circulating amyloid fibrils bind and inactivate factor X.

Benson, 285 U.S. 22 (1932), is the first United States Supreme Court decision that approved the adjudication of private rights by an administrative agency, not an Article III court. The Court held that the United States Employees' Compensation Commission satisfied Fifth Amendment Due Process and the requirements of Article III with its court-like procedures and because it invests the final power of decision in Article III courts. ==Background== The Deputy Commissioner of the United States Employees' Compensation Commission found that Knudsen was injured while in Benson's employ and while performing services on the navigable waters of the United States. He made an award to Knudsen under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act. Benson brought suit in the District Court to enjoin enforcement of the award. ==Decision of the Court== Justice Hughes writing for the court reaffirmed the opinion of the lower courts. He stated the main question in the case to be \\"whether Congress may substitute for constitutional courts, in which the judicial power of the United States is vested, an administrative agency -- in this instance a single deputy commissioner -- for the final determination of the facts upon which the enforcement of the constitutional rights of the citizen depend.\\" Another issue before the Court was whether the determinations of fact (that the injury occurred on navigable waters and that a master-servant relationship existed) were \\"fundamental or 'jurisdictional' in the sense that their existence is a condition precedent to the operation of the statutory scheme\\". The Court held that the Act reserved full power to pass on questions of law to admiralty courts, and if the court found it necessary to set aside an order as not in accordance with the law, the Act did not preclude it from making its own determination of jurisdictional or fundamental facts. It was consistent with due process for Congress to allow findings on questions of fact (apart from constitutional rights) to be final as determined by the Commissioner if supported by the evidence.https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/285/22/case.html In short, in cases brought to enforce constitutional rights, the judicial power extends to independent determination of all questions - both fact and law. The Court construed the Act to allow federal courts to determine the existence of fundamental or jurisdictional facts in order to avoid a potential Article III problem. ==Dissenting Opinion== Justice Brandeis argued that \\"[t]o permit a contest de novo in the district court of an issue tried, or triable, before the deputy commission will . . . gravely hamper the effective administration\\" of an Act. He felt that the Court had no reason to make exceptions for issues of constitutional rights. Nothing in the Constitution prevented Congress from assigning the exclusive power to collect evidence and make factual determinations. Justice Brandeis noted that the whole purpose of administrative tribunals was to withdraw from the courts certain cases that would be more effectively handled by a special and expert tribunal.https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/285/22/case.html ==See also== *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 285 == External links == * * ==References== Category:1932 in United States case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States due process case law Category:Good Behavior Clause case law Category:Employee compensation in the United States Category:United States administrative case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Hughes Court ","title":"Crowell v.

The high school was established after the 1876 opening of the Hawaiian Agricultural Company (a predecessor of the Ka'u Sugar Company), at the time one of the largest most remote sugarcane plantations in the Kingdom of Hawaii. The plantation employed a large number of immigrants who wanted their children to have a high school education; Honokaa High & Intermediate School was established on the north end of the island eight years later for similar reasons. ==General information== Kaū High and Pāhala Elementary School is located in Pāhala in Hawaii County on the Island of Hawaii. Its only feeder school is Naalehu Elementary School. Its mascot is the Trojan and the school colors are maroon and white. http://www.hawaiipublicschools.org/ParentsAndStudents/EnrollingInSchool/SchoolFinder/Pages/Naalehu- Elementary.aspx ==History== Pāhala High and Elementary School was started in 1881 for students of the rural Pāhala sugar community. The high school was established with a middle school and an elementary school. The original buildings on campus are still in use, including the main high school building, two other high school buildings, the gymnasium, the elementary school buildings and cafeteria. The H building and the G building are the original school buildings, dating back to 1881. In 1940, the school was renamed Kaū High and Pāhala Elementary School due to the drop in enrollment at Naalehu, which once had a high school. Kaū High and Pāhala Elementary School has one feeder school, Naalehu Elementary School, located in Naalehu, Hawaii, south. In 1881, the H and G buildings were built on campus. In 1909, the gymnasium and both elementary school buildings were constructed just south of the H and G buildings. A year later the main high school/administration building was completed along with a new athletic field in front of the school. A pool was constructed adjacent to the gymnasium in 1968. No new buildings were built on the campus until 1977, when the M building was completed. In 1980, a new Physical Education building with locker rooms (N building), along with a new lighted athletic field, was constructed. In 1982 the Agriculture building (I building) was completed. In 1991, the Industrial Arts building (Q building) was completed. The last building constructed is the F building, which was completed in 1999. The school remains rural, with a student body of around 800. In 2012, the County of Hawaiʻi began construction on a $17 million, 35,000 ft², Shelter and Gymnasium, http://www.bigislandvideonews.com/2012/10/06/video-kau-gym-and-shelter-breaks- ground-in-pahala/ on State-owned land previously used for athletic purposes. The new gymnasium opened in 2014. It seats 700, and serves as both a high school and community sports facility and a disaster shelter, during earthquakes, tsunamis, or intensive vog levels. ==Clubs== *Art Club *Akamai Finance Academy *Youth and Government *HOSA - Future Health Professionals *National Honor Society *Uplink All-Stars Program *Upward Bound *Interact Club *Ensemble *Robotics ==Notable achievements== Kaū High School's ensemble group, One Journey, is noted for participating in and winning the 2011 \\"Brown Bags to Stardom\\" competition hosted by Oc16 television, on Oʻahu. Faced up against large, 5,000-student schools, the small community of Kaū (of a little over 6,000), with tremendous supporters and a great group, was able to pull the group to first place out of countless larger schools. ==Dress code== Kaʻū High School, Kaʻū Intermediate, and Pāhala Elementary, employs a dress code and uniforms. In the elementary and intermediate schools, the uniform is a heather grey T-shirt with a maroon and white \\"Ka'u\\" logo on the front and smaller Hawaii island with a Trojan head on the back. A variation of this design in either black, or maroon shirts is available for the intermediate, and both black and maroon colors are also available as long-sleeved shirts. High school dress employs a black or white T-shirt with a \\"tribal\\"-designed \\"Ka'u\\" going down the side of the front of the shirt. This is also available in a long- sleeved variation. ==Commencement== Kaʻū High and Pāhala Elementary School's commencement exercises are normally held during the first week of June. ==References *Ka'u High and Pahala Elementary School official website Category:Educational institutions established in 1881 Category:K-12 schools in Hawaii County, Hawaii Category:Public high schools in Hawaii County, Hawaii Category:Public schools in Hawaii County, Hawaii Category:Public K-12 schools in Hawaii Category:1881 establishments in Hawaii ","title":"Kau High and Pahala Elementary School"},{"id":"19239149","text":"The Battle of Kotesashi refers to two separate battles in 14th century Japan. * Battle of Kotesashi (1333) * Battle of Kotesashi (1352) ","title":"Battle of Kotesashi"},{"id":"19239156","text":"Tennis events were contested at the 2007 Summer Universiade in Bangkok, Thailand. ==Medal summary== { - rowspan=2Men's Singles rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  - rowspan=2Men's Doubles rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  - rowspan=2Women's Singles rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  - rowspan=2Women's Doubles rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  - rowspan=2Mixed Doubles rowspan=2 rowspan=2  -  } ==Medal table *World University Games Tennis on HickokSports.com 2007 Universiade Category:2007 Summer Universiade ","title":"Tennis at the 2007 Summer Universiade"},{"id":"19239173","text":"The was part of the decisive Kōzuke-Musashi Campaign during the Genkō War in Japan that ultimately ended the Kamakura Shogunate. Fought in present-day Tokorozawa, Saitama on May 11, 1333, it pitted the anti-shogunate imperial forces led by Nitta Yoshisada against the pro-Shogunate forces of the Hōjō Regency led by Sakurada Sadakuni. The next day (May 12), the forces again engaged each other in the Battle of Kumegawa. The result of these two days was a victory for the Imperial forces who in less than one week marched 50 kilometers south and finally defeated the Shōgun's forces during the Siege of Kamakura.McCullough, Helen Craig (1959): pp. 274-285. ==The battle== On May 11, opposing forces were drawn up on opposite sides of the Iruma River. In the morning of the May 11, the Imperial forces crossed the river and opened their attack with an archery barrage. The Shogunate forces responded in kind. This was followed by both sides sending in their mounted warriors in multiple waves throughout the day. ==Results== The results were indecisive with both forces drawing away at the day's end to set up camp and rest. The losses on both sides appear to be modest with a slight advantage to the Imperial forces. It was apparent to both sides that the battle would continue the next day. The Imperial forces camped by the Iruma River and forces of the Shōgun some 5 kilometers away at the Kume River.The exact location of the Kume River is not known as it does not appear on modern maps. Rather, there is an area on the border of Saitama and Tokyo named where the battle was fought. There is more than one river that runs through this area. ==Aftermath== The Battle of Kotesashi was immediately followed on the next day by the Battle of Kumegawa. ==References== * McCullough, Helen Craig (1959). \\"The Taiheiki.

It uses confirmation codes to allow a voter to prove to themselves that their ballot is included unmodified in the final tally. The codes are privacy-preserving and offer no proof of which candidate a voter voted for. Receipts can be safely shown without compromising ballot secrecy. Scantegrity II prints the confirmation codes in invisible ink to improve usability and dispute resolution. As the system relies on cryptographic techniques, the ability to validate an election outcome is both software independent as well as independent of faults in the physical chain-of-custody of the paper ballots. The system was developed by a team of researchers including cryptographers David Chaum and Ron Rivest. == Advantages == Optical scan voting systems produce an electronic tally, while maintaining the original paper ballots which can be rescanned or manually hand-counted to provide an ostensibly corroborative tally. However, the correctness of each of these tallies requires the voter to either trust that the software is error-free and has not been hacked, or that the physical chain-of-custody of the ballots has not been broken at any point. Other E2E voting systems such as Punchscan and ThreeBallot, address these issues but require existing polling place equipment and procedures to be greatly altered or replaced. In contrast, Scantegrity is an add-on meant to be used in conjunction with existing optical scan equipment, thereby requiring fewer hardware and software and procedural modifications. For all other voters, the ballot marking procedure is essentially identical to conventional optical scan paper-ballots. Similarly, the underlying system still produces both an electronic tally as well as a human readable paper trail through which manual recounts can still be conducted. == Method == Scantegrity II ballot and decoder pen. Left: Unmarked optical scan bubble. Right: Marked optical scan bubble revealing confirmation code \\"FY\\" The Scantegrity II voting procedure is similar to that of a traditional optical scan voting system, except that each voting response location contains a random confirmation code printed in invisible ink. The voter marks the location using a specially provided \\"decoder\\" pen, which activates the invisible ink causing it to darken, revealing a confirmation code. Voters wishing to verify that their vote is unmodified may write down the confirmation codes for each race on a detachable chit that contains the ballot's serial number. Otherwise, the voter can simply ignore the code and continue to mark and cast their ballot as normal. The confirmation codes are randomly assigned to the ballots, allowing voters to freely share their codes while keeping their votes secret. The codes are also pre-committed to a committee of mutually-distrustful entities (such as representatives of each political party) so that the confirmation codes cannot be changed or misprinted without detection. Voters may request additional ballots to audit—they ensure the ballots are properly printed by revealing all the codes and comparing these to the codes committed to. === Checking === After the election is finished, the election authority publicly posts a list of confirmation codes for the positions marked on each ballot it received. Voters who wrote down their codes can verify that the codes are correct for their ballot number and that no codes were added or removed. If the posted record is incorrect, the voter may file a dispute. Spurious disputes can be excluded from consideration by comparing the claimed codes to the set of possible codes for a given contest on a ballot—the probability of randomly guessing a code that actually appeared on the ballot is low. === Verification === After the election, the trustees generate an independent tally from the voter-verifiable list of ballots and confirmation codes. Since the link between a confirmation code and the candidate voted for must remain secret, the tally is generated using an anonymity-preserving backend. Many such backends have been proposed for tallying votes, including the ones used by Punchscan and Prêt à Voter. Steps in the tally can be recalculated by anyone to ensure its correctness. For this reason, the system is more accurately described as mathematical voting than electronic voting. The security of the system does not require any software to operate correctly, only that the mathematical operations are independently corroborated by all interested parties. == Use in public elections == The city of Takoma Park, Maryland used Scantegrity II for its November, 2009 election.

It serves grades seven through twelve and was established in 1910. ==General information== Pahoa High & Intermediate School is located in Pahoa in Hawaii County on the Island of Hawaii. The campus is located at 15-3038 Puna Road, across the street from Pahoa Elementary School, one of its feeder schools. The other is Keonepoko Elementary School. The school's mascot is the Daggers, and its school colors are green and white. ==History== Pahoa School was established in 1910 for students from the rural Puna District communities. The high school was established along with a middle school and an elementary school; all three schools were administered as one campus until the fall of 1993. In 1914, the school was renamed Pahoa High & Elementary School. The original buildings on campus are still in use including the front High School building, the gymnasium and two of the elementary school buildings. At one time, the high school had five feeder schools, with students being bussed in as far away as Volcano, 35 miles away. The original main elementary school building was torn down in 1979 and replaced with a new two story building and portable classroom buildings. At the same time on the High School and Intermediate School campus, a new parking lot adjacent to the gymnasium, a three-story classroom building, a two-story building and six new one story buildings were constructed. The following year, another two story building along with a new cafeteria, a track and football field, basketball/tennis courts and a baseball/softball field were added on the High School side. In 1981 a 45 space parking lot was constructed behind the Intermediate School along with a few portable classrooms. The school significantly grew over the years, especially in the late 1970s when the rural Puna district was sectioned off into subdivisions after the Sugar industry went under. Pahoa High doubled in size during this period, and many new buildings were built on the campus. Beginning with the 1993-1994 school year, the elementary school began to be administered as a separate campus (the present-day Pahoa Elementary School), while the high school was accordingly renamed Pahoa High & Intermediate School. In 1999, Keaau High School was constructed ten miles away to relieve Pahoa High & Intermediate School's overcrowded 2,500 student body, virtually downsizing it in half. Keaau High School has since become Pahoa High & Intermediate School's chief athletic rival. In 2012, a new gymnasium opened on the south end of the campus, adjacent to the athletic fields. == Sports == Football Softball Baseball Soccer Basketball Volleyball Tennis Track Cross Country ==Commencement== Pahoa High & Intermediate School's commencement exercises are normally held during the third week of May. ==References *Pahoa High & Intermediate School Official Website Category:Educational institutions established in 1910 Category:Public high schools in Hawaii County, Hawaii Category:Public schools in Hawaii County, Hawaii Category:Middle schools in Hawaii County, Hawaii Category:Public middle schools in Hawaii Category:1910 establishments in Hawaii ","title":"Pahoa High and Intermediate School"},{"id":"19239519","text":"Dicen Que El Tiempo is a 2007 Grammy Award nominated album and seventh studio album released by Jennifer Peña on February 27, 2007.

A later Famicom version was published by Tokyo Shoseki. An enhanced remake was released for Windows in 1999 by Unbalance. It is the third installment in the Dragon Slayer series, preceded by Xanadu and followed by Dragon Slayer IV. Romancia is a simpler and brightly colored game in comparison to the other Dragon Slayer titles, hence the name \\"Dragon Slayer Jr.\\" ==Story== The game begins with Prince outside the castle. As in Xanadu, Fan can speak with the king for some free equipment. The goal is to rescue Princess within 30 minutes. ==Gameplay== Movement is controlled with the arrow keys, and attacking is done with the action key. Unlike Xanadu, there are almost no statistics, and zero customization. The game consists largely of two screens with a few small sub-areas. The player has only thirty minutes to complete the game, further illustrating the light and accessible nature of the title versus the oppressive underground complexes of Xanadu. Despite this, the game is still rather unforgiving and the player will likely need to use trial and error or a walkthrough to solve some of the puzzles. ==References== Category:1986 video games Category:MSX games Category:MSX2 games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Metroidvania games Category:NEC PC-8801 games Category:NEC PC-9801 games Category:Sharp X1 games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Tokyo Shoseki games Category:Windows games Category:Dragon Slayer (series) Category:Japan- exclusive video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Yuzo Koshiro Category:Single-player video games Category:Compile (company) games Category:Nihon Falcom games ","title":"Romancia"},{"id":"19239534","text":"Ryan Runciman (born 22 November 1982) is a New Zealand voice and television actor. Although best known for his role in the long-running teen drama science fiction series The Tribe, he has appeared on other children's television series including The Enid Blyton Adventure Series, Mirror, Mirror II and William Shatner's A Twist in the Tale. Runciman has also guest starred on the fantasy-adventure series Dark Knight and Revelations. ==Biography== The youngest of four children, Runciman was born in Upper Hutt, New Zealand. He began appearing in commercials at the age of 5 and eventually became involved in film and television work while attending St. Patrick's College. A trained singer and tap dancer, he also performed voice over and still photographic work. In 1996, he received his television acting debut appearing in a minor role on the television adaptation of The Ship of Adventure as part of The Enid Blyton Adventure Series and Mirror, Mirror II a year later. He also landed the starring role in The Duellists, the fifth episode of William Shatner's A Twist in the Tale, with fellow Tribe co-star Victoria Spence. In early-1999, Runciman was cast as a supporting character in the teen drama science-fiction series The Tribe. Initially introduced as the right-hand man of Lex, an early antagonist of the series played by Caleb Ross, his portrayal of Ryan as a trusting and good natured, yet naive socially awkward adolescent, proved a popular character in the series. His character eventually became more prominently featured in the show's second and third seasons, most notably, his relationship with Victoria Spence's character Salene. He remained in the series until early-2001 when he decided to continue his education at Victoria University of Wellington as well as other commitments. Michelle Ang, another Tribe cast member, also chose to study at the university during this time. Although plans had been discussed for the possibility of bringing back Runciman during the show's sixth season, the series was canceled before going into production. Following the series cancellation, Runciman had guest appearances in Dark Knight and, along with another Tribe co-star Jacinta Wawatai, in Revelations during 2002. In November 2004, he completed a training program to become a certified public accountant. After returning from a three- month tour of nine different countries, he started work in a KPMG firm early the next year. ==References * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand male television actors Category:People from Upper Hutt Category:Victoria University of Wellington alumni Category:New Zealand accountants ","title":"Ryan Runciman"},{"id":"19239595","text":"Laurie Gray is one of only a few Harvard graduates to compete in Miss America, appearing in 2004.

He was the second son of Frederick Erdmann, Prince of Anhalt-Pless, and his wife, Louise Ferdinande, daughter of Henry Ernest, Count of Stolberg-Wernigerode. ==Life== In 1786 he joined the Prussian army, where he obtained the rank of Generalmajor. From 1792 to 1794, he fought in military campaigns on the Rhine. After the death of his father and his mentally retarded older brother's renunciation of succession rights (1797), Frederick Ferdinand inherited the non-sovereign Prussian state country of Pless, but in 1803 he returned to the Prussian army. In Lindenau bei Heiligenbeil on 20 August 1803 Frederick Ferdinand married Princess Maria Dorothea Henriette Louise of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck (28 September 1783, Lindenau24 November 1803, Pless), daughter of Friedrich Karl Ludwig, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, and by birth a princess of Denmark as a descendant in the male line of King Christian III. The union lasted only three months until Louise's death. After the Battle of Jena, he commanded his own regiment at Zehdenick near the enemy lines, but was forced to withdraw to Bohemia in order to ensure the disarmament of the Austrians. Soon afterwards he retired from the military and made a trip to the Netherlands and France before his return to Pless. During the War of the Sixth Coalition in 1813, he was Commander of the Silesian countryside. His first wife, Luise of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck His second wife, Julie of Brandenburg In Berlin on 20 May 1816 Frederick Ferdinand was married for a second time to Countess Julie of Brandenburg (4 January 1793, Neuchâtel29 January 1848, Vienna), illegitimate daughter of King Frederick William II of Prussia (by Countess Sophie von Dönhoff, his morganatic wife). This marriage too was childless. When the young Duke Louis Augustus died without direct heirs in 1818, Frederick Ferdinand, as his closest male relative, succeeded him in the sovereign duchy. Shortly after, he ceded Pless to his brother Henry. During a trip to Paris in 1825, Frederick Ferdinand and his wife converted to Catholicism. His attempts to convert Köthen to the Catholic faith encountered stiff resistance. The duke chose as confessor the Belgian Jesuit Peter Jan Beckx. In Grimschleben near Nienburg he brought in the classicist architect Gottfried Bandhauer to realize some remodeling of his palace. By 1828 he founded a colony in southern Ukraine called \\"Askania-Nova\\" (New Ascania), located in the steppes of Tauri, in the northern peninsula of Crimea. Under his government, Bandhauer also built (between 1823 and 1828) the Ferdinandsbau in Schloss Köthen, the monastery and hospital of the Brothers of Mercy () in 1829, and the Catholic Church of St. Mary (Kirche St. Maria) in 1830, in the crypt of which Frederick Ferdinand was buried shortly thereafter. On his death without issue in 1830, Frederick Ferdinand was succeeded by his brother Henry. ==References== Category:1769 births Category:1830 deaths Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Calvinism Category:German Roman Catholics Freserick Ferdinand Category:Knights of the Supreme Order of Christ Category:People from Pszczyna Category:Prussian Army personnel of the Napoleonic Wars Frederick Ferdinand Category:Lieutenant generals of Prussia Category:Dukes of Anhalt-Köthen Category:Knights of the Golden Fleece of Austria ","title":"Frederick Ferdinand, Duke of Anhalt-Köthen"},{"id":"19239668","text":"Pyrrolizidine is a heterocyclic organic compound that forms the central chemical structure of a variety of alkaloids known collectively as pyrrolizidine alkaloids.Pyrrolizidine alkaloids at KEGG It is one of five classes of iminosugars.

He is the younger brother of pianist and band- leader Jools Holland and is the twin of Richard Edward Holland, a professional drummer. == Early life and career == Holland was born in Greenwich, London, the younger brother of Jools Holland. He took up playing piano at the age of seven. Recording his first song, \\"It's Getting Late\\", when he was just twelve, he used a vintage four-track reel to reel handed down from his elder brother Jools and his then band, Squeeze. By his early teens while still at school, Holland formed his own band, B Sharp, playing mainly organ and singing. The band made their first television debut when they were spotted by Mick Robinson for a new TV show at the BBC. Holland left school at the age of 16 to tour extensively around the country for a couple of years, before being signed to Miles Copeland III's I.R.S. Records label, releasing two singles: \\"While The Going's Good\\". In between working on his own music Holland has also played electronic organ, recorded and written for Jools Holland's Rhythm and Blues Orchestra. 1999 saw the release of his first solo album, Cosmic Harmony Companion (on Beautiful Records BT003CD), containing some of his earliest compositions and featuring various guest musicians. A follow-up studio album Hoopatasso was released in 2002 in a limited number, which served as a taster for Brother Sun Sister Moon (BT004CD), which was issued in the summer of 2003. Continuing to tour throughout 2004 with his band Cosmic Harmony, as well as playing solo shows, he released a one-off project with ex-B sharp member Lisa Covington, using a wide range of vintage keyboards, entitled Butterfly Effect was released in (2005).

In 1967, she founded a radical theatre group and was briefly arrested. Her parents wanted to send her to Europe for safety; instead she fled to Spain with a man from the theatre group and had a baby in Barcelona. In 1970 she moved to England as a single mother. She did factory work and other jobs. In her thirties she enrolled in a filmmakers' workshop, borrowed some film-making equipment and sold the resulting feature to the BBC. She was then hired as a director and editor of a current affairs program in Newcastle and subsequently went on to feature making. == Career == Her first feature as a writer and director was Women in Tropical Places in 1989. Since then she has directed and written numerous documentary and feature films, for television and screen. She adapted and directed Macbeth on the Estate in 1997. As with her earlier film Shakespeare on the Estate (made with Michael Bogdanov), African-Caribbean people living in tower blocks in Ladywood, Birmingham were revealed to have a natural affinity with Shakespearean language and great skill at making Shakespeare relevant to present day inner city life. Her breakthrough film was Tina Goes Shopping which was a collaborative piece with the real residents of the Gipton estates in Leeds, and which forms part one of what is now known as the Tina Trilogy (along with Tina takes a Break and the feature film Mischief Night). As well as starring in the Tina Trilogy, people from the estate (including Kelli Hollis) went on to appear in other TV and feature films, a social action feature of much of Woolcock's work. She has provided informal support to many people she has encountered whilst making documentaries and has tried to have social impacts over and above the making of her films. In Birmingham she was involved in helping to bring about a gangland truce after the making of the movie 1 Day and the documentary One Mile Away (both of which illustrated gangland \\"postcode wars\\"). She is part of a social enterprise with Dylan Duffus, Shabba Thompson and other ex-gang members trying to bring about change in parts of Birmingham affected by gang violence. In 2013, Woolcock released a new documentary, Storyville: From the Sea to the Land Beyond - Britain's Coast on Film, which was broadcast on the BBC. Based on archive movie footage from early cinematography to recent times it illustrated working-class life in the 20th century. In 2014, she directed a documentary for Channel 4 called Going to the Dogs, investigating inner city dog fighting in the UK. She is currently the executive director of Ackley Bridge, a television series broadcast on Channel 4. == Opera == Woolcock's operas include a production of John Adams' Doctor Atomic which she directed for the Metropolitan Opera's 2008–2009 season. She had previously filmed Adams' The Death of Klinghoffer as a feature film. In 2014, she staged Bizet's The Pearl Fishers at English National Opera in London (English translation version), then recreated it in a highly acclaimed French version at The Metropolitan Opera in January 2016. In 2016, she was invited by Streetwise Opera to direct a production of the Bach St Matthew Passion, performed predominantly by homeless people. Sir James MacMillan composed a new finale for the occasion, which was broadcast on BBC4 on Sunday 27 March 2016. ==ReferencesNotes== *Katrina Ames, \\"The Surprising Career of Penny Woolcock,\\" Opera News, October 2008, pp 38–39 ==External links== * *One Mile Away Social Enterprise to reduce gang violence in Birmingham Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:British film directors Category:British screenwriters Category:British people of Argentine descent Category:British opera directors Category:Female opera directors ","title":"Penny Woolcock"},{"id":"19240129","text":"Irwin Robert Coolbaugh (July 5, 1939 – June 1985) was an American football wide receiver in the American Football League (AFL) for the Oakland Raiders.

Construction of the first two prototype began in 1934. The initial design employed an all-metal construction with a shoulder-mounted gull wing. The ANT-44 incorporated four 604 kW (810 hp) Gnome-Rhône Mistral Major 14Kdrs M-85 radial engines as well as underslung stabilizing floats.Green 1968, p. 71. After a month of factory trials, in December 1937 designers changed the Mistral Major radial engines for the higher rated and more powerful Tumansky M-87 627 kW (840 hp) engines. In 1938, they further modified the prototype to be amphibious, and the aircraft was refitted with updated 709 kW (950 hp) M-87A engines.Shavrov 1994 The second prototype, designated ANT-44bis or ANT-44D, was an amphibious aircraft powered by four M-87A engines.

Involved in the Republican and Commonwealth-Progressive parties, Haight ran as a third party candidate during the 1934 California gubernatorial election. ==Biography== Haight was born in San Jose, California to George Haight and Isabella Hawkins. Haight's grandfather's first cousin was Henry Huntly Haight, the Governor of California from 1867 to 1871. Haight was also related to Henry Haight, a prominent pioneer and San Francisco banker during the California Gold Rush. Haight was educated in law at the University of Southern California, editing the Daily Trojan for a year between 1918 and 1919. Following graduation, Haight entered a Los Angeles-based law practice (Haight & Mathes, which would eventually become Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton), and quickly gained a reputation with corporate investigations. In the 1934 California gubernatorial election, Haight initially campaigned for the Republican nomination, gaining 85,000 votes. Haight ultimately lost to Frank Merriam, who had recently been installed as governor following the death of James Rolph. Haight continued to pursue the governorship, gaining the crossed Commonwealth-Progressive Party's nomination, running against the right-wing leaning Merriam, and against former Socialist Party of America member and still self-avowed socialist, author Upton Sinclair, the Democratic Party candidate. During the campaign, there was discussion during amongst Democratic supporters, including A. P. Giannini, of asking Sinclair to leave the race in favor of Haight, due to belief that Haight's moderate politics and unassociation with socialism would stand better against Merriam's conservatism. Sinclair, however, disapproved. Haight campaigned as a centrist between the right Merriam and the left Sinclair, seeping support from voters dissatisfied with both candidates. Haight garnered 302,519 votes, 13% of the vote. Much of Haight's voting strength came from the San Joaquin Valley, where farmers were hostile to Sinclair's End Poverty in California scheme to take over so-called 'idle farms'. With 13% of the vote, Haight arguably spoiled Sinclair's chances for the governorship. Haight would unsuccessfully run again as a Progressive in the 1938 election, though he would never garner the same support as he did in 1934. Haight returned to law, and rejoined Republican ranks. He served as a delegate to the 1944 Republican National Convention in Chicago. Haight died in San Diego on September 2, 1947. ==References== Category:1897 births Category:1947 deaths Category:California Republicans Category:California Progressives (1924) Category:Politicians from San Jose, California Category:California lawyers Category:University of Southern California alumni Category:20th-century American lawyers ","title":"Raymond L.

His theatrical musical version of Alice Walker's novel The Color Purple, for which he was Lead Producer alongside co-producers Oprah Winfrey and Quincy Jones, premiered on Broadway in 2005, garnering 11 Tony Award Nominations including Best Musical. He also produced the 2016 Broadway revival of The Color Purple which went on to win the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical and the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theatre Album. He won his Emmy and first Tony Award for his work as a producer on Elaine Stritch at Liberty. His musical comedy adaptation of the film Tootsie is to premiere on Broadway in the Spring of 2019. He is also known for his impresario role at Radio City Music Hall and for his work on numerous globally televised live events, including the Super Bowl XXVII halftime show starring Michael Jackson at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, CA. ==Early life== Sanders grew up in St. Petersburg, Florida and was a 1975 graduate of Gibbs High School in Pinellas County, Florida, which at the time was undergoing court-ordered desegregation, and to which he was bused. He was Class President at Gibbs. He is a 1979 graduate of the University of Florida. During college he worked as an intern in the advertising department of the St. Petersburg Times.

Lang, Madonna, Bette Midler, Richard Pryor, Lionel Richie, Liza Minnelli, Paul Simon, Frank Sinatra, Tina Turner, Liberace, Sting, Diana Ross, and The Grateful Dead. He was Executive Producer there for 15 years and has been credited with reversing the venue's steady decline after its near-bankruptcy in 1978 and turning it into one of the highest grossing theaters in the world. For Radio City Music Hall Productions, Sanders also produced rock concerts and popular cultural events outside of the venue including Penn and Teller's NBC special, Don't Try This At Home, and inaugural anniversary gala for President Bill Clinton and the historic 1993 Super Bowl halftime show starring Michael Jackson on NBC. That Super Bowl XXVII halftime show, starring Jackson, raised NBC's halftime rating higher than the Super Bowl action before it and is credited with transforming the way the NFL presents its halftime entertainment. In the years since, the NFL has, at every single Super Bowl, followed the model Sanders & Jackson created in 1993 enlisting big-name, contemporary, broad-appeal artists to perform during halftime in an effort to keep viewers from straying. He made his first foray into Broadway while still at Radio City, producing An Evening with Harry Connick, Jr. and his Orchestra in 1990.

The play was first acted late in 1672, by the King's Company at their theatre at Lincoln's Inn Fields, but was not a success with its audience. Apart from the question of the play's quality -- many critics have regarded it as a rush job, written mainly in prose with some blank verse -- Dryden was suspected of anti-Catholic satire, especially in his choice of a subtitle. This was a sensitive issue at the time, given strong Catholic sympathies among some elements of the royal court -- primarily the Duke of York, the future King James II. The cast of the original production included Michael Mohun as the Duke of Mantua, Edward Kynaston as Prince Frederick, Charles Hart as Aurelian, William Cartwright as Mario, and Nicholas Burt as Camillo. The role of Hyppolita, the nun, was taken by Mary Knep; Rebecca Marshall played Lucretia.

In 1607/8 the Congregation emigrated to the Netherlands in search of the freedom to worship as they chose. They founded the \\"English separatist church at Leiden\\", one of several English separatist groups in the Netherlands at the time. ==History== Richard Clyfton was rector of Babworth, from 1605 under suspicion of nonconformity. Suspended, he continued to preach at Bawtry, near Scrooby though just over the county boundary in Yorkshire. From 1606 the congregation around Clyfton met in the house of William Brewster. This manor house has been identified as on the site of the old Scrooby Palace of the archbishops of York, though much of the older building had been demolished by then.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-417777-manor-house-farmhouses- scrooby In 1607 Clyfton was excommunicated; at this time he had already met William Bradford. John Robinson from Sturton le Steeple, also in northern Nottinghamshire, had lost his pulpit for his views and returned home by about the end of 1604; he made contact with separatist groups in Gainsborough, just over the eastern county boundary in Lincolnshire, as well as Scrooby. The minister at Gainsborough was John Smyth. In this way the two separatist churches were drawn together, with Robinson assuming authority in the Scrooby congregation alongside Clyfton after a process of ordination. ==Emigration== From the end of 1607 and into 1608 the Gainsborough-Scrooby separatist group emigrated to Holland, in waves. An important organizer of the move was Thomas Helwys of Smyth's congregation, who had moved away to Basford, Nottinghamshire before coming to attention for not taking communion.http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/manuscriptsandspecialcollections/exhibitions/online/thebawdycourt/beliefandpersecution.aspx. The emigrants went to Amsterdam and Leiden. Memorial to the departure of congregation members for Holland in 1608, at Immingham. ==At Leiden== After arriving at Holland they realized that as foreigners, they could only take unskilled jobs and were exempt from working organizations. The congregation also noticed that their children were growing up more Dutch than English. The Congregation decided to emigrate to the Americas, where their children could be English, and they could worship freely. Memorial to congregation members, Pieterskerk, Leiden. ==Historiography== The exact significance of Scrooby for the Pilgrim group is still debated. The first research on the congregation was published by the antiquarian Joseph Hunter in 1849. It was followed in 1853 by a popular book from William Henry Bartlett, a topographical artist. Henry Martyn Dexter (Henry Morton Dexter) wrote the authoritative account The England and Holland of the Pilgrims (1905). Further documentary evidence was found by Walter Herbert Burgess (1867–1943) and Ronald Marchant. ==See also== *Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony) ==Notes References == *Alan Brinkley, American History, a Survey (eleventh edition) Category:Bassetlaw District Category:Plymouth Colony Category:Scrooby ","title":"Scrooby Congregation"},{"id":"19240746","text":"Sir William Bereford (died 1326) was an English justice. ==Life== He was the son of Walter de Bereford, with the family name coming from the village of Barford, Warwickshire. In 1287 his brother, Osbert de Bereford, a previous High Sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire, bought a property in Wishaw, and after his death a few years later the land was left to William. In the 1280s he also married Margaret, daughter of Hugh de Plessy, who brought lands in Wittenham, Berkshire, with whom he had at least one child, Edmund Bereford, who later became a King's Clerk. By 1285, he was a Pleader for the Court of Common Pleas, and after the purging of the courts in 1289 and 1290 various avenues of promotion opened him, and he was made a justice of the Common Bench in 1292. In Michaelmas term of that year he joined one of the last countrywide Eyres. In 1294 he returned to the Common Bench, standing as second to John of Mettingham and then Ralph de Hengham before becoming Chief Justice in 1309 following Hengham's retirement. He was knighted in 1302, and in 1304 was appointed as a commissioner to investigate a break-in at the Treasury. In 1305 he was one of twenty-one representatives of the crown who met with an equal number of Scottish representatives to establish how to promote stability in Scotland, and in 1306 he was a commissioner of a Trailbaston on the northern circuit. After Edward II became king in 1307 he was in charge of collecting querelae, or formal complaints, against Walter Langton, who had been Edward I's treasurer and central advisor. Bereford was associated with Piers Gaveston, a favorite of Edward II, perhaps because he had bought land in the Honour of Wallingford held by the earl. Bereford was one of only four who stood with the king against the barons who demanded Gaveston's exile in 1308, and acted as the executor of his will. Standing against the barons seems not to have harmed his career; in 1318 after attempts to reform the king's household he was among the ministers retained in office, where he stayed until his death in 1326. ==NotesReferences== * * Category:Justices of the Common Pleas Category:Chief Justices of the Common Pleas Category:1326 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"William Bereford"},{"id":"19240761","text":"arcades outside the Bibliotecha, on Old Treasury Road Below is a list some streets and piazzas (squares) in Valletta, the capital city of Malta. ==Main thoroughfares== *Archbishop Street () *Battery Street (Triq il-Batterija) *Bishop Lane (Sqaq l-Isqof) *Carmelo Street (Triq Tal-Karmnu) *Carts Street (Triq il-Karrijiet) *Castile Place () *St Elmo Place () *Old Bakery Street () *St. Biagio Street (Triq San Bjaġju) *Boat Street () *Bounty Street (Triq l-Għajnuna) *Bull Street (Triq il-Gendus) *Eagle Street () *East Street () *Engineers Lane (Sqaq l-Inġinieri) *Felix Street (Triq Feliċ) *G.

Moore, who visited the site in 1908, described Mound A as being tall, although by the 1950s it had been significantly reduced in height. Mound B has been almost completely leveled, although a small rise can be discerned. Mound C is roughly tall. Mounds A and C are both roughly sq. Pottery sampling in the 1950s from Mound A gave the site a historical importance out of all proportion to its size. Test pits from a 1949 excavation of the Holly Bluff Site produced an important glimpse of a late \\"transitional\\" Coles Creek to Plaquemine assemblage featuring thin tapered rims of polished plain ware and carefully executed varieties of Coles Creek incised and associated types. Although intriguing as pottery, it was not sufficiently integrated strategraphically to postulate a distinct phase. Site sampling from the Kings Crossing Site in 1954 supplied the integration and gave the phase a name. Since then, especially in the Tensas Basin, it has become one of the firmest and most easily identifiable ceramic complexes in the Lower Mississippi area. In 2005 the Kings Crossing Site was portrayed on the Vicksburg Floodwall Mural project to represent the American Indian heritage of the region.http://www.riverfrontmurals.com/indian.htm ==See also== *Culture, phase, and chronological table for the Mississippi Valley ==References * Animation: Towns and Temples of the Mississippian Culture-5 Sites * Vicksburg Riverfront Murals Category:Archaeological sites of the Coles Creek culture Category:Mounds in Mississippi Category:Geography of Warren County, Mississippi Category:Archaeological type sites Category:Archaeological sites in Mississippi Category:1908 archaeological discoveries ","title":"Kings Crossing Site"},{"id":"19240814","text":"The Coast Is Clear may refer to: *The Coast Is Clear (In-Flight Safety album) *The Coast Is Clear (Tracy Lawrence album) *\\"Coast is Clear\\", a song by Skrillex featuring Chance The Rapper and The Social Experiment from Recess ","title":"The Coast Is Clear"},{"id":"19240852","text":"Västertorp is a Stockholm metro station located in the Västertorp suburb of Stockholm, Sweden.

He left behind only three (or four) poems, but one is the earliest piece of writing in the Sicilian language. This work is of immense philological and linguistic importance. He was born at Messina in the Kingdom of Sicily and was, as his name implies, a protonotary. He is mentioned in only two documents: one of 1261 from Messina,Where he is called Stephanus Protonotarii de Massina, c.f. Giulio Bertoni, Il Duecento (Milan: 1910), p. 127. Other forms of his name in primary documents include di Pronto notaio di Messina and di Pronto di Messina. while he was a live, and a posthumous one from 1301 (probably near the date of his death). If he is the same person, as seems probable, as a \\"Stefano da Messina\\" mentioned in other documents, he made Latin and Greek translations of two Arabic treatise on astronomy--Liber rivolutionum (Book of Revolutions) and Flores astronomiae (Flowers of Astronomy)--which he dedicated to King Manfred, son of Frederick II. He was probably one of the later Sicilian poets, since one of his commiate (addresses to a lover) shows the influence of Guittone d'Arezzo.Ernest F. Langley (1913), \\"The Extant Repertory of the Early Sicilian Poets\\", Periodical of the Modern Languages Association, 28:3, p. 458. The poets of the Sicilian School usually composed in the Sicilian language. At a time when all the Italian languages were very similar, Tuscan copyists altered the Sicilian word endings and other orthographic conventions to produce Tuscanised texts. Stefano's canzone Pir meu cori alligrari, is the only work of the Sicilian School that is preserved in both Sicilian (which has five vowel sounds) and Tuscan (which has seven). Gian Maria Barbieri reported to have found it in a \\"libro siciliano\\", probably an Occitan chansonnier from Sicily, and copied it. This copy was first printed in 1790 by Gerolamo Tiraboschi. The original has since been lost. Pir meu is written in coblas unissonans, with two feet of abC form and a sirma that is dDEeFF, followed by a tornada that is identical in structure. One of the central images in the piece is that of la dulzuri / chi fa la tigra in illu miraturi: \\"the delight / that the tigress has in her own mirror\\". Stefano likens seeing his lady for the first time to this delight. This image was first employed in a canso of Rigaut de Barbezieux: the tigress is said to be enchanted by her own beautiful stripes and so be forget about the hunters that pursue her. The mirror image may also be used to structure the motifs of the poem, the second half being a motivic mirror-image of the first.Sarah Kay (1983), \\"Love in a Mirror: an Aspect of the Imagery of Bernart de Ventadorn\\", Medium aevum, 52, p. 284 n36. While Pir meu is written in the standardised Sicilian of court poetry, the volgare (siciliano) illustre, the first stanza shows hints of the common tongue (siciliana-comune). Stefano's poem has been used, with varying degrees of liberty, to re-create Sicilian versions of the Tuscanised legacy of other Sicilian poets. Besides Pir meu, Stefano left two other songs, Assai cretti celare and Assai mi placeria.Attributed to Istefano di Messina in one manuscript. A fourth, Amor, da cui move tuttora e vene, customarily assigned to Pier delle Vigne, has been lately ascribed to Stefano. It is characterised among his works for its dependence on bestiaries for creating simile and image. He alludes to a deer and a unicorn. ==External links== *\\"Stefano Protonotaro\\", Microsoft Encarta Enciclopedia Online (2008). *\\"Stefano Protonotaro da Messina: Canzoni\\". Poeti del Duecento, G.

It stars Edward Norton as twin brothers, alongside Richard Dreyfuss, Nelson, Susan Sarandon, Melanie Lynskey and Keri Russell. Set in Nelson's home state of Oklahoma, the film was actually filmed in northwestern Louisiana, which was selected for its generous film production incentives. Leaves of Grass was featured at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival, and had a limited domestic release by First Look Studios on just six screen April 2, 2010. It failed to impress at the domestic box office, earning a meager in ticket sales against a production budget of . Critical reception was slightly positive, but mixed. The film faired much better internationally, earning . ==Plot== Bill Kincaid (Edward Norton) is lecturing his class at Brown University about Plato's Socratic dialogues. Meanwhile, Bill's identical twin brother Brady Kincaid (also played by Edward Norton) is living in Oklahoma, growing and selling hydroponic cannabis. Brady is under pressure from local drug lord Pug Rothbaum (Richard Dreyfuss) to expand his sales. Despite needing money to repay a debt to Rothbaum, Brady refuses. After a phone call from Brady's partner Bolger (Tim Blake Nelson) telling him that Brady has died from a crossbow arrow, Bill flies to Tulsa, meeting a Jewish orthodontist on the plane. In Tulsa, Bill is mistaken for Brady and is beaten up and knocked unconscious by rival marijuana dealers angry that Brady has taken half their territory. When Bill wakes, he finds that Brady is alive and has tricked him into travelling to Tulsa. Brady asks Bill to pretend to be Brady while he goes up state to \\"take care\\" of Rothbaum. Bill initially refuses, but later agrees, after meeting local poet Janet (Keri Russell) as he wants to stay and get to know her better. While Bill (pretending to be Brady) visits their mother, thus giving Brady an alibi, Bolger and Brady go to a synagogue in Tulsa, where Rothbaum is listening to a sermon. Also present is Ken Feinman (Josh Pais), the orthodontist Bill met on the plane. He sees Brady and mistakes him for Bill. Brady and Bolger leave with Rothbaum, and Rothbaum demands the money Brady owes him. When Rothbaum threatens to kill them if they don't pay up, Bolger shoots Rothbaum's thugs, and Brady stabs Rothbaum, killing him. In Tulsa, Ken Feinman hears of Rothbaum's murder and figures everything out. He purchases a gun without bullets and sets off for Brady's house, where he encounters Bill and Brady and threatens to shoot them. Bill takes the gun from him but Ken panics and uses Bolger's rifle to shoot Brady, after which Bill shoots Ken in retaliation. Before dying, Brady tells Bill to place the gun in his hand, which Bill does. After an abortive attempt to sell Brady's dope-growing system to one of Brady's former rivals, Bill is shot through the chest by a crossbow. Bolger frantically drives him to hospital, saving Bill's life, and thereby repaying his debt to Brady (who had saved his life in prison). Bill is forced to stay in Tulsa for a long recuperation after his injury, allowing him time to heal his relationship with his mother and develop his romance with Janet. ==CastCredited songs=== {  style=\\"width:100%;\\" ! style=\\"width:38%;\\"Song Title ! style=\\"width:18%;\\"Performer ! style=\\"width:4%;\\"Written By - \\"Stand Up\\" Doug Bossi Doug Bossi - \\"Illegal Smile\\" John Prine John Prine - \\"My Wildest Dreams Grow Wilder Every Day\\" The Flatlanders Joe Ely, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Butch Hancock, Dan Yates - \\"Faithful and True\\" Richard Myhill Richard Myhill - \\"Fat Man In The Bathtub\\" Little Feat Lowell George - \\"Rex's Blues\\" Townes Van Zandt Townes Van Zandt - \\"Sailin' Shoes\\" Little Feat Lowell George - \\"Sweet Revenge\\" John Prine John Prine - \\"I Shall Be Released\\" The Band Bob Dylan - \\"Lonely Are The Free\\" Steve Earle Steve Earle - \\"Boys From Oklahoma\\" Cross Canadian Ragweed Gene Collier } ==Release== The film premiered at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. Film critic Roger Ebert stated that he considered it his favorite of the festival. The film was not picked up for distribution at TIFF, so producer Avi Lerner planned to release it on April 2, 2010 through his own First Look Studios. This plan was abandoned on April 1 when Telepathic Studios gave Lerner enough funds to give the film a wider Summer 2010 release, due to positive reception at South by Southwest. For unknown reasons, this plan was also scrapped; ultimately, Leaves of Grass debuted theatrically on just six screens, grossing a little over $1 million worldwide. DVD and Blu-ray versions of the film were released on October 12, 2010, and an extended edition is sold exclusively on Blu-ray with an additional 46 minutes of content. === Critical response === Leaves of Grass received mixed reviews from film critics, with praise being given to Norton's dual performance. Rotten Tomatoes reports that 61% of 38 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 5.66/10. The website's critical consensus states that \\"Edward Norton delivers one of his finest performances in Leaves of Grass, but he's overpowered by the movie's many jarring tonal shifts.\\" Metacritic, assigned the film a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on reviews from 10 critics, indicting \\"mixed or average reviews\\". \\"Leaves of Grass has the structure and the elements of a classical Greek drama: There's treachery, mistaken identity, deadly plots, and ambition; that it takes place in the middle of Oklahoma is almost irrelevant\\", said Paul Constant. Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, and stated that \\"Tim Blake Nelson's \\"Leaves of Grass\\" is some kind of sweet, wacky masterpiece. It takes all sorts of risks, including a dual role with Edward Norton playing twin brothers, and it pulls them off.\\" He closed his review with \\"Here's a quote for the video box: \\"One of the year's best!\\" No, Tim Blake Nelson...thank you.\\" Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times also gave a positive review, particularly praising that \\"Edward Norton turns in not just one but two terrific performances in \\"Leaves of Grass,\\" an offbeat thriller that is deepened — rather than derailed — by its tricky shift from darkly funny to just plain dark.\\" He also praised Richard Dreyfuss, Susan Sarandon, and Josh Pais for their performances. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times gave it an \\"NYT Critics' Pick\\", and particular praised the actors, saying \\"Mr. Norton is a pleasure to watch, and so is everyone else.\\" He also approved of how the \\"film keeps you deliciously off-balance: it’s funny and unnerving at the same time.\\" Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly stated that \\"the movie bubbles with intellectual curiosity and narrative ambition. And for that I dig it, even if Leaves of Grass has the habit of swerving and sometimes lurching from tone to tone.\\" She praised the acting of Norton and Keri Russell. On an A to F scale, she gave the film a B+. The film was not without its detractors. Dennis Harvey of Variety stated that \\"Nelson's script isn't blackly comic or deep enough to successfully accommodate the introduction of jarring violence,\\" and criticized the subplot of Pais' character, Dreyfuss' performance, and the \\"perfunctory\\" romance between Norton and Russell. He strongly praised Norton's acting, stating that his dual-role \\"is very much the main attraction, and reward, of 'Leaves of Grass.'\\", and also praised Nelson's acting, stating that \\"Nelson himself provides the most valuable support in the colorful if variable cast.\\" Rex Reed of New York Observer was extremely critical, particularly of Nelson, saying \\"It’s just another oblique backfire from Tim Blake Nelson, whose work as a writer- director in general wallows in a bog of mediocrity\\" and that \\"Nelson, a cornball actor at best, is over the top as a larcenous Pa Kettle of a redneck sidekick.\\" He finished his review stating that \\"The mirror-has-two-faces-idea is nothing new. From Bette Davis in Dead Ringer to Sam Rockwell in Moon, dozens of seasoned actors have lit each other’s cigarettes while the audience thinks it’s seeing double, and they’ve done it in much better pictures than this one. In Leaves of Grass, it seems irrelevant and recycled—essentially nothing more than a gimmick that wears out fast.\\" He gave the film a rating of two out of four. ==ReferencesCategory:2009 films Category:2009 black comedy films Category:2000s crime comedy-drama films Category:American black comedy films Category:American crime drama films Category:American crime comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films about drugs Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films about educators Category:Films about twin brothers Category:Films directed by Tim Blake Nelson Category:Films scored by Jeff Danna Category:Films set in Oklahoma Category:Films set in Rhode Island Category:Films shot in Louisiana Category:2009 comedy films ","title":"Leaves of Grass (film)"},{"id":"19241035","text":"Fischer-Chöre (Fischer choirs) is a group of children choirs, youth choirs, men choirs, and mixed choirs that are singing under the direction of Gotthilf Fischer; they are based in the Stuttgart area. ==History== In 1946 at the age of 18 Gotthilf Fischer took over the direction of the Deizisau Choir, later followed by other choirs.

An envoy mission was prepared to formally inform Beijing of the change in rulership, and a second royal manor was established in the countryside, to maintain the prestige and dignities appropriate to Shō Kō's status. Historian George H. Kerr suggests the possibility that Shō Kō did not in fact suffer from any mental illness, but rather contemplated radical actions such as seeking the kingdom's full independence from Satsuma, to which it was a vassal tributary, in the hopes that this would alleviate the intense economic difficulties faced by the kingdom.Kerr. p245.

The story is an illustration of the power of Mrs Hauksbee. (It is Kipling's third story about her in book form.) Tarrion, a \\"clever and amusing\\" young officer in an unfashionable regiment, longs for a permanent appointment in Simla. There he has the good fortune to do Mrs Hauksbee a favour (by forging a date on her invitation, so that she can attend the more prestigious Ball, rather than the smaller \\"dance\\" to which she has been sent an invitation by the Governor's A.-D.-C. with whom she has quarrelled). So she owes Tarrion a favour, and asks what she can do. He admits that \\"I haven't a square inch of interest here in Simla\\" - but says that he wants a permanent post in that most desirable Hill Station. She agrees to help him. Now by chance (an ill-written address, and a stupid orderly) she comes into possession of some official papers. These she reads with Tarrion, and he uses them to persuade \\"the biggest and strongest man that the Government owned\\" to give him a permanent post. It is not particularly well- paid, but it is finally granted because the Viceroy has an obsession with 'Diplomatic secrecy', and believes that \\"a boy so well supplied with information would be worth\\" promoting. At the end, Tarrion thinks \\"'If Mrs Hauksbee were twenty years younger, and I her husband, I should be Viceroy of India in fifteen years.'\\" Mrs Hauksbee thinks \\"'What fools men are!'\\" :All quotations in this article have been taken from the Uniform Edition of Plain Tales from the Hills published by Macmillan & Co., Limited in London in 1899.

He's a widower with a teenaged son, Larry, who is fascinated by this alien world. Larry has learned the rudiments of the Darkovan language from tapes, and wants to explore outside the confines of the Terran Spaceport complex and the Trade City. During his first solo exploration, Larry runs into a gang of street toughs. A local, Kennard Alton, intervenes. After Larry comports himself well in a one-on-one fight with one of the toughs, Alton invites him to his father's home to share a meal. Alton explains some of the Darkovan customs. Valdir Alton, Kennard's father, arrives home and invites Larry to return to his home when he wishes. Larry returns to his quarters where his father, Wade, is furious with his son's adventure and confines him to the spaceport. Larry promised to lend some books to Kennard and realizes the Darkovans will consider it a grave insult if he fails to return to the Alton home. Against his father's wishes, he takes the books to Kennard. Valdir Alton introduces Larry to Lorill Hastur, the head of Darkover's governing council. Hastur questions Larry about his motivations for returning to the Alton home. Larry's answers please Hastur, and he expresses his approval. Again, Larry is invited to return, but says his father probably won't allow another visit. Wade Montray is predictably angry and forbids his son's return to the city. His commander tells him they've heard from the Darkovan council, and they're offended by his action, as if they are unfit company for his son. The Altons invited Larry to spend the summer at Armida, and Terran command recommends that Wade agree in the interest of diplomatic relations. Larry begins to feel more comfortable with the local customs after a couple of weeks at Armida. Kennard, Larry, Lord Alton and their guardsmen are out riding when they encounter a forest fire. Larry joins the others to fight the fire, but it turns out to be a diversion set by raiding bandits who have attacked a nearby village. Valdir's men track the bandits to a canyon, where Larry is taken prisoner during a fight. The bandits believe him to be Kennard Alton. In an attempt to gain information, they drug him with kirian. The real Kennard Alton rescues Larry and they escape into the mountains. In the course of their escape, the two boys learn much about each other's cultures, and realize that each has benefits and drawbacks. Larry's latent telepathic abilities emerge under the stress of the journey. They encounter Trailmen, banshee-birds and a chieri. The chieri reveals to Kennard that the Darkovans are of Terran origin and returns them, by teleportation, to the spaceport. Kennard tells his father that he wishes to leave Darkover to attend school. Larry decides to remain on Darkover, living with the Altons. Under pressure from Valdir Alton, Wade Montray tells Larry that his mother was a daughter of Aldaran, and one of the Comyn. ==Major characters== *Larry Montray, son of Wade Montray *Wade Montray, a Terran administrator *Kennard Alton, son of Kennard Alton *Valdir Alton, Kennard's father, Lord Alton *Lorill Hastur, head of the governing council of Darkover *Cyrillon, a bandit ==Publication history== *1965, US, Ace Books , Pub date 1965, Paperback (later printings with ) *1967, Germany, Pebel , Pub date 1967, Paperback, in German as Die Kräfte der Comyn *1979, US, Gregg Press , Pub date 1979, Hardcover *1978 UK, Arrow Books , Pub date 1978, Paperback *1993, UK, Severn House , Pub date September 1993, Hardcover *1994, US, DAW Books , Pub date July 1994, Paperback ==References== * * * Category:Darkover books Category:1965 American novels Category:Novels by Marion Zimmer Bradley Category:American science fiction novels Category:Ace Books books ","title":"Star of Danger"},{"id":"19241301","text":"Guam Public Library System (Chamorru: Sisteman Laibirihan Pupbleko Guåhan) is the public library system of the United States territory of Guam. The main library is the Nieves M. Flores Memorial Library at 254 Martyr Street in the village of Hagåtña. ==History== The Guam Public Library System officially opened January 31, 1949 sourced from two Quonset huts near the Agana Azotea. A division of the Department of Education, the original collection contained 13,000 books which were sourced mainly from deactivated Navy libraries. Many of the books also came from a substantial donation from the Los Angeles Public Library. By 1953 a bookmobile service began, allowing those in remote reaches of the country to have access to new books. The following year the library became an independent government agency, separating itself from the Department of Education. In 1960 the library relocated to the first floor of what used to be the Guam Administration Building. Because of its continued growth, and the need for more room, the library expanded to the second floor in 19688, and to the third floor in 1979. At this point the building was entirely used by the library and therefore was renamed the N. M. Flores Memorial Public Library. In 2011 the library system became a division of the Department of Chamorro Affairs. ==Branches== The Guam Public Library system consists of 5 library branches located in various villages throughout the island. http://gpls.guam.gov/Portals/50/GPLS_LOC/GPLS_Location_2007Apr12.xml The following locations each have their own library branch. *Agat - 165 Follard Street *Barrigada - 177 San Roque Drive *Dededo - 283 West Santa Barbara Avenue *Merizo - 376 Cruz Avenue *Yona - 265 Sister Mary Eucharita Drive The Agata and Deodedo libraries were completed in 1968, the Barrigada Library was completed in 1970, the Merizo Library was completed in 1974, and the Yona Library opened in 1993. As well as having five branches and one main library, the system also reintroduced a bookmobile in 1990. ==See also== * State Library of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands ==References * Guam Public Library System * Scott-Smith, Christine K. \\"Challenges in providing public library services in a multicultural and geographically remote area.\\" Guam Public Library.

Parliamentary hearings into the issue led to a deadlocking of various committees, and then to the snap election in 2008. On 6 March 2012, charges were dropped as part of a plea deal in which the Conservative Party of Canada and its fundraising arm pleaded guilty to exceeding election spending limits and submitting fraudulent election records, and agreed to repay $230,198.00 for its role in violating Canadian election spending laws. ==Background== The basic \\"in and out\\" scheme involves transfers of money between different levels or organizations within a political party. Elections Canada places strict limits on campaign budgets in order to provide an even playing field between the parties. They also directly fund political activity through per-vote financing, as well as reimbursing a major amount of campaign expenses for any riding where the candidate wins over a certain percentage of the votes. In recent elections the per-vote payout has been around $2, while between 50 and 60% of campaign expenses are re-paid if the candidate wins over 10 to 15% of the riding.Andrew McIntosh, \\"Ex-MP must pay $16,362 to Bloc for underspending\\" , National Post, 4 December 2003 It is the second of these two funding sources that is used in the in-and-out scheme. In the 2000 federal elections the Bloc Québécois organized a system to inflate apparent campaign spending at the riding level, and thereby receive much higher refunds from Elections Canada. The Bloc organized \\"La Méthode In & Out\\" prior to the elections, having each candidate agree to certain spending numbers in order to inflate the overall cash flows. In exchange, Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe would sign their nomination papers, a requirement for running as a party candidate in the election. Large amounts of cash were transferred from the party organization to the individual riding associations that are in charge of running one candidate's election campaign. The money was then distributed to the volunteers as payments for various expenses. The volunteers then donated that money back to the party. On the surface it appeared that the ridings were spending much larger amounts of money than normal, enough to drain the party war chest. In fact, a considerable portion of the money was being returned directly to the party's coffers. Under normal circumstances the money received by the volunteers would be subject to income tax and therefore the scheme would be unattractive to them. But because the money was then spent on political donations, it could be written off. The only cost to the volunteer was time in filling out their tax forms - something they were giving up anyway as a volunteer for the party. The scheme may have remained unknown if not for a court case against former Bloc MP, Jean-Paul Marchand. Marchand agreed to spend $66,000 as part of the in and out scheme, but spent only $22,276. The Bloc sued Marchand, saying he had broken his contract and owed them $36,362. A Quebec judge agreed with the Bloc, but lowered the amount to $16,362. When the story broke in 2003 as a result of the court case, the ruling Liberal Party immediately started to implement changes to the election law to stop this process. However, these changes were not implemented before the party lost power in 2006. == In and Out == The current scandal, to which the term \\"in and out\\" now largely applies, refers to a scheme implemented by the Conservative Party in the 2006 election, the election that prevented passage of the bill outlawing the practice. In this case of \\"in and out\\", it is held that the scheme was not only intended as a method of gaining additional income, but also as a way to avoid limitations on campaign spending at the national level. Having reached their $18.3 million campaign spending limit, the party transferred $1.3 million to 67 riding offices that had not yet reached their own local campaign limits, which varied but were around $80,000.Glen McGregor, \\"Campaign worker irked Tory brass by testifying, ethics committee hears\\", Canwest News Service, 12 August 2008 The ridings then returned the money to the party, stating that it was being used to purchase advertising. The ads in question were identical to the party's national ads with the exception of a \\"paid for by...\\" message in small print that was added to the end of the ad in post-production. The scheme was once again noticed only in a roundabout fashion, when some of the riding finance officers asked for the 60% reimbursement from Elections Canada. The first was an invoice submitted by Vancouver East candidate Elizabeth Pagtakhan; asked to explain a $29,999.70 election expense, Pagtakhan's official agent, Denny Pagtakhan, told an auditor \\"I think we contributed to TV national advertising. There was no way we can spend our limit so we were asked by the Party if we can help contribute.\\" Noticing that the invoices were all from a single company in Toronto, Retail Media, they became suspicious and Commissioner William Corbett started an investigation. Investigator Ronald Lamothe questioned Retail Media about the invoices, notably one for $39,999.91 sent by Steve Halicki's campaign for the riding of York South-Weston. The invoice was on Retail Media letterhead, yet Retail Media stated that they dealt only with the party and \\"did not generate invoices to candidates or electoral districts.\\" The CEO even went so far to claim that \\"the invoice must have been altered or created by someone, because it did not conform to the appearance of invoices sent by Retail Media to the Conservative Party of Canada with respect to the media buy.\\"Tonda MacCharles, \\"'Altered' ad invoice began Tory troubles\\", Toronto Star, 22 April 2008 Returning to Steve Halicki's riding, Barbro Soderberg, Halicki's official agent, told investigators she was approached by Conservative Party campaign manager Romolo Cimaroli, who proposed a deposit of about $40,000 into Halicki's campaign account. The funds would be immediately transferred back to the party and recorded as an advertising expense. Despite misgivings, she was reassured by party officials that the transaction was legal. The Conservative Party denied any documents were doctored or falsified, and claimed that the payments were above board. They stated that regional groups of riding organizations had met to plan out bulk purchases of airtime to be billed to the national party. The \\"alterations\\" were simply the editing of the bills at the party headquarters to divide up the amounts that should be billed to each riding. ==Fallout== Elections Canada didn't accept the explanation, noting that the money was only sent out to candidates who had not spent close to their $80,000 limit, something the party could not have known before the election started. They also noted that airtime blocks were booked weeks before the ads ran, or the money had been paid to the ridings. In April 2007 the Chief Electoral Officer, Marc Mayrand, refused to pay the refunds, totaling about $780,000, stating that the party had paid for the ads.\\"Mounties search Tory headquarters\\", CBC News, 15 April 2008 In an obvious parallel with the Bloc events of a decade earlier, the Conservative Party decided to sue Elections Canada to get the money back. On 15 April 2008, Elections Canada and Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers raided the Conservative party headquarters in Ottawa. Tipped off, major news organizations and cameramen from the other political parties were already on hand when the RCMP officers arrived. Lamothe's affidavit noted: > \\"a deliberate 'in-and-out' scheme conceived to move money from national > coffers into and out of the accounts of local campaigns, which have their > own spending limits, in order to skirt the national spending limit... Funds > were transferred into and out of each of the bank accounts of the 67 > campaigns ... entirely under the control of and at the direction of > officials of the Conservative Fund of Canada and/or the Conservative Party > of Canada... The purpose of the in and out transfers was to provide > participating candidates with documentation to support their reimbursement > claims for these election expenses.\\" Garth Turner, who was elected in 2006 running for the Conservatives but later moved to the Liberals, went on record stating he was personally aware of one such transaction. He said: > \\"I was asked to be the guest speaker ... but before I gave my speech the > treasurer gave their report for the annual meeting and they had more than > $40,000, which was transferred into their bank account and then the same day > they wrote a cheque back to the central party. And by transferring $40,000 > into their bank account during the campaign they got a 60 per cent rebate. Sam Goldstein, who ran what The Ottawa Citizen described as a Conservative \\"token campaign\\" against Olivia Chow in Trinity—Spadina, later went on record stating that he agrees that the transfers were to pay for national ads.Tim Naumetz and Glen Mcgregor, \\"Tories clash with Elections Canada\\", The Ottawa Citizen, 23 August 2008 He told Citizen that \\"Its national advertising is what it is.\\" A brief political firestorm erupted over the issue, which was quieted by the 2008 election that started soon after. The opposition parties repeatedly attacked the Prime Minister during Question Period. The Prime Minister only responded directly to the questions on one occasion, challenging the Liberals to make their accusations outside the chamber where they were not protected from parliamentary privilege.Richard Brennan, \\"Furor over campaign funds heats up\\", Toronto Star, 27 October 208 Conservative party executives and press contacts stated that there is nothing illegal about transferring money to ridings for advertising, and that all the parties did it. Heather MacIvor at the University of Windsor noted that the Conservatives were being disingenuous, and that it was the intent to receive the Elections Canada funds that constituted the \\"in and out\\".Bea Vongdouangchanh, \\"Conservatives confusing public on 'in and out' financing says Prof. MacIvor\\", 21 April 2008 ==House investigation and snap election== The issue fell under the purview of the House Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs, an inter-party group that includes all four party whips. At the time, the committee was chaired by Conservative Gary Goodyear, who the opposition parties claim used his position to delay any debate on the issue, including hours of filibuster.\\"Opposition Removes Committee Chair to Stop Procedural Tricks Preventing Investigation of the 'In and Out' Scandal\\" , Liberal Party of Canada, 6 March 2008 This led to his removal from the position in a vote of non-confidence. He was replaced by Joe Preston who did not want the position, called no meetings, and then resigned almost immediately. The Conservative party whip, Jay Hill, stated that no new chair would be named unless the opposition parties agree to drop any debate of the in and out scheme.Bev Vongdouangchanh, \\"No House Affairs meetings not having adverse effect\\", The Hill Times, 12 May 2008 The remaining members of Committee, nevertheless, continued to investigate, calling a number of witnesses to testify about the affair. Most of them refused to appear, which led to the issuing of 31 summonses, unparalleled in House history.\\"Committee summons 31 witnesses in Tory 'in-and-out' scheme\\", The Canadian Press', 5 August 2008 The deadlocking of the Procedure and House Affairs committee was one of a number of such actions that had led to a breakdown of the House process. On 14 May, the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, Peter Milliken, said rulings by committee chairs are being routinely overturned by majority votes, even when the rulings are procedurally sound. Such a state of affairs has led to \\"general lawlessness\\" at committees.Joan Bryden, \\"Commons speaker decries 'anarchy' in committees\\", The Canadian Press, 14 May 2008 Partisan fighting, the cause of the problem, was renewed as the parties blamed each other for the problems. It was this breakdown of procedure that led to the calls for a snap election. Stephen Harper blamed Stéphane Dion for the problems when he first hinted on 14 August that an election might be called.Daniel Leblanc and Campbell Clark, \\"Harper threatens election to end 'dysfunction'\\", The Globe and Mail, 14 August 2008 Referring to the in and out hearings as a kangaroo court, he stated that the committees were being ruled by a \\"tyranny of the majority\\". No breakthrough was forthcoming, and the election call was made on 27 August. ==Litigation== The Conservatives claimed to have won a victory when their case against Elections Canada returned a decision suggesting that the body had overstepped its mandate. However, this ruling was then overturned on appeal.Steven Chase, \\"Court quashes decision Tories hailed as campaign-finance vindication\\", The Globe and Mail, 1 March 2011 The Conservatives sought leave to appeal that court ruling to the Supreme Court of Canada, which was rejected on May 4, 2011. No explanation was given, as is usual in such instances.

He was a fur brigade leader and explorer of the Columbia District and later became a U.S. citizen and an early settler of Oregon. ==Family== Thomas was born at Sault Ste.

His mother, from a marriage 'à la façon du pays' (in the style of the country), was a Métis woman named Marguerite Wadin, online at Google Books the daughter of a Cree woman online at Google Books and Jean Etienne Wadin, a Swiss fur trader. online at Google Books ==Wives and children== Thomas McKay had at least three wives during his life. His first wife was Timmee T'Ikul Tchinouk a Chinook woman, daughter of Chief Concomly and were married sometime before 1824 in the Oregon Territory. Their children were Joseph McKay, Margaret McKay, William Cameron McKay, John T. McKay and Alexander McKay. McKay's second wife was She-Who-Rides-Like The Wind Umatilla, an Umatilla, they were married about 1834 in the Oregon Territory. Their child Donald McKay was born in 1836. At Fort Vancouver on December 31, 1838 he married his third wife, Isabelle Montour, daughter of Nicholas Montour, Jr. and Susanne Humpherville. Their children were Maria McKay and Thomas McKay. McKay had six sons and two daughters altogether.Dr. John McLoughlin, A Place Called Oregon ==Pacific Fur Company== In 1811, Thomas McKay accompanied his father on the Tonquin to the mouth of the Columbia River, where the Pacific Fur Company's Fort Astoria was built. Thomas, who was about 15 years old at the time, was at Fort Astoria when his father Alexander McKay was killed in late 1811 at Clayoquot Sound as the Tonquin was destroyed off of Vancouver Island. In 1813 Fort Astoria and all other Pacific Fur Company assets were sold to the North West Company. Thomas McKay, like a number of other Astorians, joined the NWC at that time. ==North West Company== Thomas McKay joined the North West Company after the failure of the Pacific Fur Company in 1813. Between 1815 and 1819 Thomas was in the Red River Colony and fought on the side of the North West Company and the Métis people against the Hudson's Bay Company. McKay fought at the 1816 Battle of Seven Oaks. By 1819 he was back on the Columbia. online at Google Books Within two years the entire North West Company was merged into the Hudson's Bay Company. ==Hudson's Bay Company== After the North West Company was merged with the Hudson's Bay Company in 1821 Thomas McKay became an HBC employee, despite having fought the company in the Red River Colony war. In 1824 Chief Factor John McLoughlin was appointed superintendent of the Columbia Department. He and his family moved that year to Fort George (Astoria) and then, once it was built, Fort Vancouver, the new headquarters of the HBC Columbia Department. In 1811 McLoughlin had married Marguerite Wadin, widow of Alexander MacKay and mother of Thomas McKay. Thus in 1824 Thomas's mother and stepfather moved across the continent to the very place Thomas was living. In the 1820s the HBC sent trading, trapping, and exploring parties south into the Willamette Valley and beyond, eventually reaching California (Mexican Alta California at the time). In 1825 Thomas McKay and Finan McDonald led one of these exploring expeditions south of the Columbia River. online at Google Books He led or accompanied several others. From 1826 to 1828 McKay took part repeatedly in the Snake Country brigades under Peter Skene Ogden. During this time Ogden explored not only the Snake River basin, but the Deschutes River and Blue Mountains of Oregon, as well as the Klamath Lake region, and the Great Salt Lake and its tributary the Weber River. In 1828, McKay was in the party sent from Fort Vancouver to retrieve furs and property Indians took from Jedediah Smith on the Umpqua River in southern Oregon. George Simpson, head of the HBC, had decided to try to over-exploit the Snake Country and create a \\"fur desert\\", for the political purpose of keeping American trappers and traders away. McKay, along with other former NWC trappers such as Peter Ogden, Finan McDonald, Francois Payette, and others, \\"took up Simpson's orders with a fanatical zeal, declaring war on fur-bearing animals south of the Columbia,\\" as historian Richard Mackie put it. In 1829, Thomas McKay took part in Alexander McLeod's expedition to California. McLeod's party reached as far south as the San Joaquin River and was the first of what became an annual trapping expedition to California, known as the Southern Party. The route from Fort Vancouver to the lower Sacramento River became known as the Siskiyou Trail. In 1836, McKay led a HBC Southern Party brigade to the Pit River region of California. In 1840-41 McKay and Michel Laframboise were brigade leaders of the Southern Party to California. In 1832, McKay was given charge of an HBC farm at Scappoose. Within a year he had moved to and settled at Champoeg. He may have retired from the HBC at this time, although he continued to work for the company off and on for many years. McKay lead a brigade to the Snake Country in 1834, reaching into the far southeast of today's state of Idaho. John Kirk Townsend, who was accompanying an American expedition to establish Fort Hall, described Thomas Mckay's party at the future site of Fort Hall in 1834 as consisting of 17 French Canadians and \\"half-breeds\\", and 13 Indians (Nez Perce, Chinook, and Cayuse). Townsend also noted that McKay enforced the HBC policies brigade order, decorum, and strict subordination, as well as the prohibition of trading whiskey to the Indians. All these things, Townsend noted, were in stark contrast to the behavior of American fur traders in the region. Fort Hall was part of an effort by Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth to break into the Columbia region and compete with the HBC. Politically the entire Oregon Country was free and open to British and American ventures, but the HBC was able to maintain its dominance in the region through various barriers to entry tactics such as dumping and predatory pricing. Wyeth's attempt to compete in the early 1830s was quickly made untenable by the HBC. In the case of Fort Hall, Thomas McKay built the rival post of Fort Boise, which supported an increased HBC effort to turn the Snake Country into a \\"fur desert\\" and drive the Americans out. The strategy worked and by 1837 Wyeth had abandoned the region and sold his company's assets, including Fort Hall, to the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1834, McKay met the American missionary Jason Lee at Fort Hall. McKay guided Lee from Fort Hall to Fort Vancouver, then helped Lee select the site of Willamette Mission. Thomas McKay remained active in the Snake Country until 1838. He spent most of 1839 at Champoeg. ==Later life== Thomas McKay spent most of his later years between his farms at Champoeg and Scappoose. At some point he became a United States citizen. In 1840, he drove more than 3,600 sheep and 661 cattle from California to Fort Nisqually for the HBC. In 1841, members of the overland party of the Wilkes Expedition met and breakfasted with McKay at his Champoeg farm. George Colvocoresses of the expedition wrote about McKay, saying that he is \\"one of the most noted individuals in this part of the country. Among the trappers, he is the hero of many a tale.\\" McKay raised and led a company of militia which saw active service during the Cayuse War of 1848. In September 1848, he guided a train of 50 wagons to California. He died sometime between November 1849 and April 1850, and is buried in an unmarked grave in Scappoose. ==References== Category:Oregon Country Category:1796 births Category:1849 deaths Category:Canadian fur traders Category:North West Company people Category:Hudson's Bay Company people Category:Canadian explorers Category:Explorers of Oregon Category:Oregon pioneers Category:Canadian Métis people Category:Métis fur traders ","title":"Thomas McKay (fur trader)"},{"id":"19241413","text":"Charles Grant Jr. (August 31, 1874 - July 9, 1932) was an American second baseman in Negro league baseball.

The 2/11th Battalion arrived at the camp on 15 December 1939 and were later joined by the 2/10th Battalion. The camp facilities were expanded during the war, with two parts of the camp known as \\"Chocolate City\\", due to the brown- coloured oiled timber weatherboard buildings in that part of the camp and \\"Silver City\\", due to corrugated iron Nissen huts built in that part of the camp. Citizens Military Force units were also trained at the camp, with up to 60,000 Australian soldiers trained during World War II. After the war, much of the field training areas were returned to grazing purposes, however the camp was required for the training of troops preparing to join the occupation forces in Japan. In 1949, Greta Camp was transferred to the Department of Immigration and until 1960 it was used as a reception and training centre for European migrants with over 100,000 immigrants passing through the centre. The Army resumed control of the camp in 1962 and, after being used intermittently for training exercises.

Running on a clean- government platform, Palin defeated incumbent Governor Frank Murkowski in the Republican gubernatorial primary election in August. She then went on to win the general election in November, defeating former Governor Tony Knowles 48.3% to 40.9%.(Johnson 2008, p. 107) Her running mate was State Senator Sean Parnell. During the Republican gubernatorial primary campaign, Palin was endorsed by former Alaska Governor Walter Hickel,Hickel backs Palin, Daily News-Miner (July 1, 2006). and groups such as the Alaska Correctional Officers Association and Alaska Right to Life.Milkowski, Stefan. \\"Governor candidates announce endorsements\\", Daily News-Miner (August 19, 2006). Later, in the general election for governor, she was supported by Governor Frank Murkowski.Hopkins, Kyle et al. “Knowles, Palin in November” , Anchorage Daily News (August 22, 2006). Republican U.S. Senator Ted Stevens made a last-moment endorsement, filming a television commercial with Palin for the gubernatorial campaign. During her campaign for governor, Palin declared that education, public safety, and transportation would be the three cornerstones of her administration. She won the race despite spending less than her Democratic opponent. Palin became Alaska's first female governor and, at 42, the youngest in state history. She is the first Alaskan governor born after Alaska achieved U.S. statehood and the first governor not inaugurated in Juneau; she chose to have the ceremony in Fairbanks instead. She took office on December 4, 2006, and maintained a high approval rating throughout her term. On July 3, 2009, Sarah Palin announced her resignation as governor of Alaska. She stepped down on July 26, 2009, being replaced by Lieutenant Governor Sean Parnell. ==Government ethics== Palin had championed ethics reform throughout her election campaign. Her first legislative action after taking office was to push for a bipartisan ethics reform bill. She signed the resulting legislation in July 2007, calling it a \\"first step\\" declaring that she remains determined to clean up Alaska politics. However, Palin was also the subject of an ethics probe concerning her brother-in-law, Mike Wooten. == Public Safety Commissioner dismissal == On July 11, 2008, Palin dismissed Public Safety Commissioner Walter Monegan, citing performance-related issues. She then offered him an alternative position as executive director of the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, which he turned down. Monegan alleged that his dismissal was retaliation for his failure to fire Palin's former brother- in-law, Alaska State Trooper Mike Wooten, who was involved in a child custody battle with Palin's sister, Molly McCann. \\"Palin has said she did not pressure Monegan or fire him for not taking action against her former brother-in-law.\\" He further alleged that contacts made by Palin herself, her staff, and her family had constituted inappropriate pressure to fire Wooten. Palin stated that most of those calls were made without her knowledge, and reiterated that she did not fire Monegan because of Wooten, who is still employed as a state trooper. On September 19, 2008, Todd Palin refused to testify to a state legislative committee about his role in the controversy. Palin's choice to replace Monegan, Charles M. Kopp, chief of the Kenai police department, took the position on July 11, 2008. He resigned on July 25 after it was revealed that he had received a letter of reprimand for sexual harassment in his previous position. On August 1, the Alaska Legislature hired an independent investigator to review the situation. The investigation is scheduled to be completed in October 2008. On August 13, Palin changed her position after an internal investigation, acknowledging that her staff had contacted Monegan or his staff regarding Wooten, but reiterating that she had not fired Monegan because of Wooten. On September 1, Palin's lawyer asked the state Legislature to drop its investigation, saying that by state law, the governor-appointed state Personnel Board had jurisdiction over ethics issues. Palin also asked that the Board review the matter as an ethics complaint. On October 10, 2008, the Republican-dominated Alaska Legislative Council unanimously voted to release the Branchflower investigative report which found that Sarah Palin abused her power as governor in the firing of Monegan. However, on November 3, 2008, the Alaska Personnel Board concluded that Palin had not violated ethics laws, essentially contradicting the findings of the Branchflower probe. Tim Petumenos, the attorney hired by the Personnel Board to conduct the probe, stated in his final report, \\"There is no probable cause to believe that the governor, or any other state official, violated the Alaska Executive Ethics Act in connection with these matters.\\" ==Energy== Palin has promoted oil and natural gas resource development in Alaska, including in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), where such development has been the subject of a national debate. She also helped pass an increase in the severance tax oil companies pay to extract oil from state land. Palin has created a new sub- cabinet group of advisers to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions within Alaska. When asked about climate change after becoming Senator McCain's presumptive running mate, she stated that it would \\"affect Alaska more than any other state\\", but she added, \\"I'm not one though who would attribute it to being man- made.\\"url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6950967.ece She has also called the efforts to control climate change a \\"hoax\\". Shortly after taking office, Palin rescinded 35 appointments made by Murkowski in the last hours of his administration, including that of his former chief of staff James \\"Jim\\" Clark to the Alaska Natural Gas Development Authority. In January 2009, Governor Palin introduced a new plan that would convert 50% of Alaska's energy resources to renewables. The plan has been hailed by some environmental activists as the most ambitious alternative energy project in the country. ===Gas pipeline=== Palin with Lt. Governor Sean Parnell In March 2007, Palin presented the Alaska Gasline Inducement Act (AGIA) as the new legal vehicle for building a natural gas pipeline from the state's North Slope. This negated a deal by the previous governor to grant the contract to a coalition including BP (her husband's employer). Only one legislator, Representative Ralph Samuels, voted against the measure, and in June, Palin signed it into law. On January 5, 2008, Palin announced that a Canadian company, TransCanada Corporation, was the sole AGIA-compliant applicant. In August 2008, Palin signed a bill into law giving the state of Alaska authority to award TransCanada Pipelines $500 million in seed money and a license to build and operate the $26-billion pipeline to transport natural gas from the North Slope to the Lower 48 through Canada. TransCanada projects the pipeline to be operational by late 2018, barring unforeseen obstacles. \\"Palin’s Pipeline Is Years From Being a Reality \\" New York Times September 10, 2008 === Gasoline taxes === In June 2008, Governor Sarah Palin asked the Legislature to give Alaskans a special one-time payment of $1,200 to help with the high costs of energy. She said it will come out of the windfall the state is getting from high oil prices. The legislation was passed and signed into law by Gov. Palin in August 2008. This replaces the proposal that Palin dropped to give Alaskans $100-a-month energy debit cards. The governor said the debit cards were too expensive for the state to administer and wouldn't work in some rural Alaskan communities. \\"As the fiscal year winds down, Alaskans are assured of surpluses beyond the billions of dollars put into savings and funding for priorities such as forward funding education and municipal revenue sharing,\\" Palin said in a press release. \\"With savings and funding priorities covered, I am confident that Alaskans, who are the owners of our resources, can spend their resource revenue better than government can.\\" Palin is also proposing to suspend the eight-cent-a gallon state fuel tax for one year. Palin said she wants the Legislature to implement these things by September. Additionally the Palin administration proposed the Alaska's Clear and Equitable Share (ACES), a plan to protect tax revenue to the state government from fluctuations in oil prices. ==EnvironmentPredator control=== Wolf with Radio Collar Bounties on wolves in Alaska date to at least 1915; in 1994, the Alaska State Legislature enacted the \\"Intensive Management Law,\\" requiring management of wildlife for human consumptive use and authorizing specific management actions including \\"liberalizing hunting and trapping regulations for wolves and bears.\\" In 2006 the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and The Board of Game extended areas in which the aerial hunting of wolves was allowed under the Predator Control Program. Friends of Animals, Defenders of Wildlife, the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, and the Sierra Club sued the Department attempting to overturn the practice. Their concerns were overgrazing of the habitat by large population of moose that were intended for sports hunters, the wolves kept the moose populations in balance with the environment.March 2008-01.asp \\"Alaska Judge Upholds Aerial Wolf Killing But Limits Extent\\" Environment News Service, March 18, 2008\\"State Suspends Predator Control Programs in Response to Court Ruling\\" Alaska Department of Fish and Game In 2007, Palin supported the Alaska Department of Fish and Game policy allowing wolf hunting from helicopters as part of a predator control program intended to increase moose populations, which many rural Alaskans subsist on. In March 2007, Palin's office announced that a bounty of $150 per wolf would be paid to the 180 volunteer pilots and gunners, to offset fuel costs. This drew protest among wildlife activists,deMarban, Alex \\"State Puts Bounty on Wolves\\" Anchorage Daily News March 21, 2007 who took the state to court and won. Though the activists failed to stop aerial hunting, a state judge forced the state to stop paying the bounty. In May 2007 Palin introduced Bill 256 to streamline the Predator Program,\\" Alaska Department of Game and Fish\\" ADF & G Press Release May 11, 2007 and make it more difficult for conservation groups to sue the State. Critics of the bill claimed it removed scientific standards and claim the programs are expensive and not effective.\\"Palin wants to shoot down wolf lawsuits\\" Anchorage Daily News, January 30, 2008 In August, 2007, both lawmakers and Governor Palin approved appropriating $400,000 from the state treasury to explain the aerial hunting program to Alaskans. Since Alaskans were voting the following year on an initiative restricting the practice to Department of Fish and Game personnel, many felt the funds were an attempt to influence the vote against the initiative.deMarban, Alex, \\"$400,000 approved to educate Alaskans about wolf killing\\" Anchorage Daily News August 26, 2007Stuart, Ben, \\"AFD&G; takes another shot at predators\\" homernews.com, top stories from Homer, Alaska, April 24, 2007 Alaskans had passed similar measures in 1996 and 2000, each time with a two-year limit; after they expired the state legislature allowed the Game Board to resume the program. The program also allowed the fly-and-shoot, liberalized hunting of black bears with no bag limits in the same areas, in addition to the area from Anchorage across Cook Inlet in Game Unit 16, which allows the killing of sows and cubs as well as males. In March 2008 a federal judge upheld the aerial gunning program as a whole, while banning the practice in four areas covering up to 15,000 of the covered by the program. The judge said that before the Game Board extended predator control into new areas it had to make new findings on the wolves, caribou and bears in those areas.March 2008-01.asp \\"Alaska Judge Upholds Aerial Wolf Killing But Limits Extent\\" Environment News Service March 18, 2008 \\"AlaskaWolf- Defenders of Wildlife v. Alaska Board of Game\\" Defenders of Wildlife\\"Judge say Aerial Wolf Control Invalid in Several Areas\\" Associated Press, March 14, 2008. On August 26, 2008, Alaskans voted against ending the state's predator control program. ===Clean Water=== Palin expressed her personal opinion as a private citizen against State Ballot Measure Four, known as Alaska's Clean Water Act, a week prior to a statewide election held August 26, 2008. Conflict among commercial fishing and environmental interests versus mining interests in Alaska's Bristol Bay prompted the ballot petition. Measure Four was defeated at the polls by 57% of Alaskan voters. Anglo-American Mining Company is seeking to develop a gold and copper mine within proximity to Bristol Bay that could pollute the Bay's headwaters. The initiative was to prevent waste materials from large-scale mining operations from seeping into salmon watersheds. Such development could threaten the spawning grounds for the largest remaining wild salmon run. Experts say the mine could yield more than $300 billion in metals and hundreds of jobs. The commercial fishing from salmon at Bristol supplies $300 million per year to the Alaskan economy in its present environmental state and a feature of the state's heritage. Opponents pointed to existing state and federal environmental laws that already achieve the same health and wildlife protections requested under Measure Four. They also claim that the Measure as written was open to interpretation which could drive stricter environmental standards that shut down all new, large metallurgic mines in Alaska. Despite this potential redundancy, there are claims that the enforcement of mining industry environmental regulations in Alaska and nationwide are imperfect and pollution outside acceptable limits periodically occurs at existing sites to varying degrees. Also, the downside risk of an environmental accident at the proposed Anglo-American site could permanently decrease fishing activity at Bristol. ===Endangered species=== A polar bear Polar Bears In December 2007, Palin wrote an opinion column in which she described her opposition to the listing of polar bears as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, stating her position was based on a review of expert opinion. In it she stated that the polar bear population is more numerous now than it was forty years ago, and \\"there is insufficient evidence of polar bears becoming extinct in the foreseeable future.\\"Palin, Sarah, \\"Bearing Up\\" The New York Times, January 5, 2008 Alaskan state biologists and environmental groups disagreed with Palin's position. After Dirk Kempthorne, the Republican Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior listed the bear as threatened on May 14, 2008, Palin sued the federal government, claiming that the listing would adversely affect energy development in the bears' habitat off Alaska's northern and northwestern coasts, while again questioning the scientific basis for the listing. Palin claimed the scientists found no ill effects of global warming on the polar bear. Rick Steiner, a University professor of Alaska, sought the e-mail messages of the state scientists who had examined the effects of global warming on the bears, and was informed his request would cost $466,784 to process. Through a federal records request Steiner was able to obtain the e-mails and he found that contrary to Palin's claims, the scientists supported the fact that the bears were in danger.Once elected, Palin Hired Friends and Lashed Foes The New York Times, Sept 13, 2008. On August 28, 2008, the American Petroleum Institute, the National Association of Manufacturers, the United States Chamber of Commerce, and the American Iron and Steel Institute joined Alaska's suit to revert the listing of the polar bear as a threatened species. The issue at hand is a rule implemented by the federal government at the time the status of the Polar Bear was changed to threatened. The rule is to prevent the polar bear's status from being used as a tool for imposing greenhouse gas limits; it exempts projects in all states except Alaska from undergoing review in relation to emissions. The Center for Biological Diversity, is also suing the federal government, to change the Polar Bear status from threatened to endangered. They denounced the Alaska suit's claim that science does not prove polar bear populations are declining. \\"Oil Group Joins Alaska in Suing to Overturn Polar Bear Protection\\" The Washington Post August 31, 2008 Beluga Whales Palin has opposed strengthening protections for beluga whales in Alaska's Cook Inlet. Palin cited state scientists who claimed that hunting was the only factor causing the whales' decline and that the hunting has been effectively controlled through cooperative agreements with Alaska Native organizations. Recent research suggests that despite hunting controls beluga whales in Cook's Inlet remain severely depleted and at high risk of extinction.Hunter, Don. \\"Cook Inlet beluga whales in decline\\" Anchorage Daily News, January 8, 2008 The United States government on October 17, 2008, listed the Beluga Whale as endangered due to severe declines in its population. The National Marine Fisheries Service stated that oil and gas exploration had hindered the whale's existence.\\"Bush administration to Gov. Palin: Beluga whale in Alaska is endangered\\" Los Angeles Times October 17, 2008 == Budget State=== Palin in Kuwait visiting soldiers of the Alaska National Guard, July 24, 2007.Palin followed through on a campaign promise to sell the Westwind II jet purchased (on a state government credit account, against the wishes of the Legislature) by the Murkowski administration for $2.7 million in 2005. In August 2007 the jet was listed on eBay; although with no buyer found on eBay, it was later sold for $2.1 million through a private brokerage firm to a campaign contributor. She also canceled a contract for the construction of an gravel road outside Juneau to a mine, reversing a decision made in the closing days of the Murkowski administration. In June 2007, Palin signed into law a $6.6 billion operating budget—the largest in Alaska's history. At the same time, she used her veto power to make the second-largest cuts of the construction budget in state history. The $237 million in cuts represented over 300 local projects and reduced the construction budget to nearly $1.6 billion. In 2008 Palin vetoed $286 million in funds for 350 projects from the FY09 capital budget, or 13% of the total budget. The Anchorage Daily News said the cuts \\"may be the biggest single-year line-item veto total in state history.\\" ===Personal=== Palin lives in Juneau during the legislative session and lives in Wasilla and works out of offices in Anchorage the rest of the year. Since the office in Anchorage is far from Juneau, while she works there she is legally entitled to a $58 per diem travel allowance, which she has taken (a total of $16,951), and to reimbursement for hotels, which she has not, choosing instead to drive about from a state office in Anchorage to her home in Wasilla. In response to criticism for taking the per diem, and for $43,490 in travel expenses for the times her family accompanied her on state business, the governor's staffers said that these practices were in line with state policy, that Palin's gubernatorial expenses are 80% below those of her predecessor, Frank Murkowski,Luo, Michael; and Leslie Wayne. Palin Aides Defend Billing State for Time at Home. New York Times, September 9, 2008. and that \\"many of the hundreds of invitations Palin receives include requests for her to bring her family, placing the definition of 'state business' with the party extending the invitation.\\" In December 2008, an Alaska state commission recommended increasing the Governor's salary from $125,000 to $150,000. Palin stated that she would not accept the pay raise. In response, the commission dropped the recommendation. === Matanuska Maid Dairy === In April 2007, the state Board of Agriculture and Conservation (BAC) approved a request for $600,000 for a review of the operating expenses of the Matanuska Maid Dairy, an unprofitable state-owned business, and forwarded the request to the state legislature for funding. The Alaska Creamery Board, which oversaw the dairy and made the request, met in May and discussed privatizing or possibly closing the dairy. It subsequently voted to close the dairy and, on June 13, rejected Palin's public request that it keep the dairy open, saying it stood by its decision to close the dairy plant as July 7. On June 18, Palin replaced the entire membership of the BAC, which then installed itself as the Creamery Board, and voted to keep the dairy open for 90 days while reviewing options. On August 29, 2007, Palin announced that the business could not be made profitable and would be offered for sale. She said that the board could use the $600,000 approved by the legislature in June to help with the transition to a private operator. In November, the dairy received the $600,000 legislative funding. On December 7, with a required minimum bid of $3.35 million for the dairy, no bids were received, and all dairy operations were scheduled to close later that month. In August 2008, the Anchorage plant portion of the dairy was purchased for $1.5 million, the specified minimum bid. The new owners said that they planned to convert it to heated self- storage units. The sale of the company's bottle-making facility in Palmer was under consideration as of early September. ===Bridge to Nowhere=== In Palin's 2006 gubernatorial campaign, she supported the building of the proposed Gravina Island Bridge, which had been nicknamed the \\"Bridge to Nowhere\\" because the island had only 50 residents. The bridge was intended to provide access to Ketchikan International Airport and not the residential population of the island. On September 20, 2006, Sarah Palin visited Ketchikan on her gubernatorial campaign and said the bridge was essential for the town's prosperity. Members of the Alaskan congressional delegation, particularly Representative Don Young and Senator Ted Stevens, were the bridge's biggest advocates in Congress, and helped push for federal funding. The project encountered fierce opposition outside of Alaska as a symbol of pork barrel spending. In 2005, Congress stripped the specific earmark allocation of federal funds for the two bridges, without changing the amount of money allocated for use by Alaska. As a result, the money previously earmarked for this and another controversial project, the Knik Arm Bridge, a total of $442 million, was to be made available for transportation projects generally. Registration required. The proposed Knik Arm Bridge is officially named \\"Don Young's Way\\" after Alaska Congressman Don Young, in the original legislation. The next year, Palin ran for Governor on a \\"build-the-bridge\\" platform, arguing that it was essential for local prosperity. She said in August 2006: \\"We need to come to the defense of Southeast Alaska when proposals are on the table like the bridge, and not allow the spinmeisters to turn this project or any other into something that's so negative.\\" In October 2006, when asked, \\"Would you continue state funding for the proposed Knik Arm and Gravina Island bridges?\\", she answered: \\"Yes. I would like to see Alaska's infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later. The window is now - while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist.\\" She also criticized the use of the word \\"nowhere\\" as insulting to local residents. Congress did not, however, reinstate the earmark for the bridge. In September 2007, with no federal money available, Palin removed the state's portion of the cost from her proposed budget. She stated: > Ketchikan desires a better way to reach the airport, but the $398 million > bridge is not the answer. ... Despite the work of our congressional > delegation, we are about $329 million short of full funding for the bridge > project, and it's clear that Congress has little interest in spending any > more money on a bridge between Ketchikan and Gravina Island. ... Much of the > public's attitude toward Alaska bridges is based on inaccurate portrayals of > the projects here. But we need to focus on what we can do, rather than fight > over what has happened. Her switch allowed the state to use the federal money for other transportation projects. Palin did, however, continue construction of an access road on Gravina Island, which would have linked to the bridge but now goes only to an empty beach; federal money for the access road, unlike the bridge money, would have otherwise been returned to the federal government. According to Reuters, Palin's decision to cancel the bridge \\"earn[ed] her admirers from earmark critics and budget hawks from around the nation. The move also thrust her into the spotlight as a reform-minded newcomer.\\" In an article titled, \\"Bridge leads McCain to running mate Palin\\", the Associated Press said canceling the bridge was \\"the first identifiable link connecting Palin and McCain,\\" soon followed by \\"whispers of Palin being an ideal GOP running mate.\\" Although she canceled the bridge, Palin spent $25 million from the $223 million earmark to build the road on Gravina Island to an empty beach where the bridge would have gone. State officials said \\"they were going ahead with the $25 million road because the money would otherwise have to be returned to the federal government.\\" The cancellation of the bridge did not lead Palin to return any of the remaining $197 million in the earmark to the Federal Government. Palin's Ketchikan campaign coordinator Mike Elerding, says, \\"She said 'thanks but no thanks,' but they kept the money.\\" According to Palin's communications director Bill McAlister, the bridge \\"isn't necessarily dead\\"; it may still be built with \\"a less costly design\\". Palin changed her mind on the bridge, he said, when \\"she saw that Alaska was being perceived as taking from the country and not giving, and that impression bothered her and she wants to change it. ... I think that Sarah Palin is someone who has the courage to re-evaluate situations as they developed.\\" Palin said through her spokesperson that the road would open territory for development. A McCain-Palin spokesperson said that \\"because the contract for the road was already signed before she got into office, the governor was left no viable alternative.\\"\\"Bailout Negotiations Continue; FBI Targets Wall Street Firms\\" (Transcript), CNN (September 23, 2008). The Alaska Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration state that the contract could have been cancelled at minimal cost and that the federal money could have been returned to Congress for other uses, if the road had been cancelled when Palin took office in December 2006, but the bridge to the island was not cancelled until September 2007.https://www.propublica.org/article/palin-defends-construction-of-road-to- nowhere-925/ . Citation contains CNN's photograph of the terminal point of the Gravina Island Highway, nicknamed the \\"Road to Nowhere\\" In her nomination acceptance speech, Palin said: \\"I told the Congress 'thanks, but no thanks,' for that Bridge to Nowhere.\\" McCain-Palin television advertisements also claim Palin \\"stopped the Bridge to Nowhere.\\" The Washington Post called the claim a \\"whopper,\\" and the New Republic considered it as \\"a naked lie.\\" Ketchikan's Mayor Bob Weinstein has criticized Palin for using the term 'Bridge to Nowhere' in her vice-presidential nomination acceptance speech because Palin had termed that name for the bridge \\"insulting\\" during her 2006 gubernatorial campaign, when she campaigned on her original \\"build the bridge\\" platform. ===Earmarks=== Alaska's federal congressional representatives cut back on pork-barrel project requests during Palin's time as governor, however Alaska is still the largest per-capita recipient of federal earmarks, requesting nearly $750 million in special federal spending over two years and obtaining $295 per Alaska resident from the federal government.The Associated Press, Woodward Calvin, In the 2008 budget year, Palin requested around $255 million in federal earmarks, and her requests for the 2009 budget total $197 million.Seattle Times \\"Palin's earmark requests: more per person than any other state\\" For the fiscal year 2010 budget, the last one before her resignation, Palin requested eight earmarks worth $69.1 million. ==Lobbyists== Palin has given jobs to friends and appointed lobbyists to oversee industries they used to represent; she appointed a fund-raiser of hers, Deborah Richter, as director of the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend Division. Palin hired Cora Crome, who had worked for industry lobbying group United Fishermen of Alaska, as her fisheries-policy adviser. ==Resignation== Palin delivering her farewell speech On July 3, 2009, Sarah Palin announced her resignation as governor of Alaska. She stepped down on July 26, 2009 and the new governor became Sean Parnell, who was her lieutenant governor. \\"We know we can effect positive change outside government at this moment in time on another scale and actually make a difference for our priorities,\\" Palin said in a news conference alongside a lake in her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska. Palin reasons for leaving were varied, but there was speculation that it was to the upcoming 2012 United States presidential election. Many sources in media coverage claimed that resigning might have been intended for Palin to clear a way for her seat as a Republican presidential nominee in 2012. == See also == * Early political career of Sarah Palin * Electoral history of Sarah Palin * Political positions of Sarah Palin == References == Category:2000s in Alaska Category:2006 establishments in Alaska Category:2009 disestablishments in Alaska Category:Governors of Alaska Category:Governorships of U.S. states Governorship ","title":"Governorship of Sarah Palin"},{"id":"19241692","text":"Salig Rām, popularly known by the honorific \\"Huzur Maharaj\\" and by the government-conferred title \\"Rai Bahadur,\\" was born in Peepal Mandi, Agra, on 14 March 1829.Devotees who worship Salig Rām as God regard it blasphemous to call him by name.

Joey and Patrick appeared on WWE Raw as ambulance drivers, preparing the stretcher for a match between Edge and Kane. During the match Lita was tombstoned on the ramp and the All-Knighters, dressed as EMTs, put a neck brace on Lita, secured her to the stretcher and took her back to the ambulance. However, Kane appeared and attacked them both, only to steal the ambulance as the episode ended. At WrestleMania 23 in Detroit, the All- Knighters were hired by WWE to be Donald Trump's head shaving testers. Trump claimed he had never used hair trimmers before and wanted to make sure he would be able to do it right, if he were victorious in the famed Hair vs Hair match involving Trump and Vince McMahon. The boys were paid to have their heads shaved by Trump, with only Joey receiving the hair cut while Patrick was spared. Later that night, the boys appeared as Druids for The Undertaker's entrance. Since then, The All-Knighters have had many tryout matches with the WWE. ==Recent years== The All-Knighters currently live in Tampa, Florida wrestling in the Florida-area, Chicago and making multiple trips to the United Kingdom.

Early stages of the competition were run in three regions (northern, central, and southern), with the National League teams receiving a bye until the later stages of the competition. In all, 123 teams took part in the competition. Note: Different sources give different numberings for the rounds of the competition: some start round one with the beginning of the regional qualifications; others start numbering from the first national knock-out stage. The former numbering scheme is used in this article. One of the highlights of the competition was the performance of unfancied minnows Lower Hutt City, who progressed to the quarter-finals before being narrowly beaten by the competition's eventual winners Christchurch United. p. 77 The competition saw a change of sponsorship, with Lion Breweries taking over from Gillette. The competition was known as the Lion Chatham Cup for the rest of the decade. ==The 1975 final== Christchurch United successfully defended their trophy, and also became only the second team to win the Chatham Cup/National League double. Blockhouse Bay were on top early, and looked like they might run away with the final, scoring through Mike Farac and Colin Shaw to lead by two goals after just ten minutes. Norman Moran reduced the deficit within minutes as the mainlanders came back into the match. With ten minutes to play, Gary Lake miscued while attempting to clear a cross into his own penalty area and the ball deflected into his own net to tie the scores. In extra time it was Christchurch who applied all the pressure, and goals came to them through Kevin Mulgrew and substitute Mark McNaughton. ==ResultsThird Round=== * Won on penalties by Nelson Suburbs (6-5) and Newlands Paparangi (6-5) ===Fourth Round=Fifth Round=== * Stop Out won 4-3 on penalties ===Sixth Round=Semi-finals=Final=References== *Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation New Zealand 1975 page *UltimateNZSoccer website 1975 Chatham Cup page Category:Chatham Cup Chatham Cup Chatham Cup Category:September 1975 sports events in Oceania ","title":"1975 Chatham Cup"},{"id":"19241928","text":"is a common masculine Japanese given name. ==Possible writings== Yūji can be written using different kanji characters and can mean: *雄二, \\"heroic, two\\" *勇二, \\"courage, second\\" *裕二, \\"abundant, two\\" *祐二, \\"help, two\\" *祐次, \\"help, next\\" *雄治, \\"masculine, govern\\" *悠児, \\"permanence, child\\" *祐史, \\"help, history\\" *祐司, \\"help, rule\\" *裕司, \\"abundant, rule\\" The name can also be written in hiragana or katakana. ==People with the name== *, Japanese television journalist and actor *, Japanese musician and songwriter *Yūji Aoki (1945–2003), Japanese manga artist *Yuji Funayama (disambiguation), multiple people *, Japanese Paralympic swimmer *Yuji Hino (裕士, born 1985), Japanese professional wrestler *Yuji Horii (雄二, born 1954), Japanese video game designer *, Japanese high jumper *Yuji Hirayama (平山ユージ), Japanese professional rock climber *Yuji Ide (井出 有治), Japanese racing driver *, Japanese ice hockey player *, Japanese golfer *Yuji Iiyama (飯山裕志), Japanese baseball player *, Japanese ice hockey player and coach *Yūji Iwahara (裕二), Japanese manga artist *, Japanese Paralympic judoka *, Japanese Nordic combined skier *, Japanese footballer *Yūji Kishi (祐二, born 1970), Japanese actor and voice actor *, Japanese footballer *, Japanese shogi player *, Japanese information scientist *Yūji Mitsuya (雄二, born 1954), Japanese actor, voice actor, and sound supervisor *Yuji Miura (三浦, born 195?), Japanese ski mountaineer and trail runner *Yuji Nagata (裕志, born 1968), Japanese professional wrestler *Yuji Naka (裕司, born 1965), Japanese video game designer and programmer *Yuji Nakazawa (佑二, born 1978), Japanese football player *Yuji Nakamura (athlete) (中村祐二, born 1970), Japanese long-distance runner *, Japanese volleyball player *Yuji Nishino (born 1991), Japanese baseball player *Yūji Oda (裕二, born 1967), Japanese actor and singer *Yuji Ohno (雄二), Japanese jazz musician *Yuji Okabayashi (裕二, born 1982), Japanese professional wrestler *Yuji Okano (born 1964), Japanese shot putter *, Japanese footballer *, Japanese footballer *, Japanese rugby union player *Yūji Takada (裕司, born 1960), Japanese actor and voice actor *, Japanese footballer *Yūji Ueda (ゆうじ, born 1967), Japanese voice actor *, Japanese sprint canoeist *, Japanese footballer *, Japanese animator *Yuji Yamamoto (born 1952), Japanese politician *, Japanese footballer and manager ==Fictional characters== *Yuuji Kazami (雄二), protagonist of the Grisaia visual novel series *Yuji Sakai (悠二), protagonist of the light novel series Shakugan no Shana *Yuuji (Digimon) ==See also== *47077 Yuji, a main-belt asteroid Category:Japanese masculine given names ","title":"Yūji"},{"id":"19241934","text":"Yuji or Yu Ji may refer to: * Yūji, a common masculine Japanese given name * Consort Yu (虞姬; Yuji), the concubine of Xiang Yu, subject of the play Farewell My Concubine * Gan Ji, a Taoist who lived in the late Han Dynasty.

In 1796, he joined the Prussian army. During the campaign of 1806, he attained the rank of major. Before his retirement from active service, Henry was elevated to the rank of Generalmajor. After his elder brother Frederick Ferdinand inherited Anhalt-Köthen in 1818, Henry assumed the government over the state country of Pless. When Frederick Ferdinand died in 1830, Henry succeeded him in Köthen, whereas he left Pless to his younger brother Louis, who died in 1841 without heirs. Henry reassumed his rulership over Pless until his death. In Trebschen on 18 May 1819 Henry married Auguste Fredericka Espérance (3 August 1794, Brunswick – 13 July 1855, Köthen), daughter of Henry XLIV, Prince Reuss of Köstritz, and sister of Prince Henry LXIII. The union was childless. Since his youth, Henry was a strong advocate of homeopathy. In 1821 he took under his protection its creator, Samuel Hahnemann, who remained with his large family in Köthen for the next fourteen years as Henry's personal physician. In 1830 Henry was made a knight of the Order of the Black Eagle. From 1841, he resumed service in the Prussian army, and by the time of his death, he was a General of Infantry. With him, the line of Anhalt-Köthen became extinct. On his death, the duchy was inherited by his kinsmen Alexander Karl of Anhalt-Bernburg and Leopold IV of Anhalt-Dessau, however Alexander renounced his rights over Köthen on behalf of Leopold IV, since it was clear that his eventual assumption of all the Anhalt lands was inevitable. The principality of Pless, governed by Semi-Salic Law, passed to Henry's nephew Hans Henry X, Count of Hochberg-Fürstenstein (corresponding article in the German), son of his sister Anna Emilie, who was the only one of his siblings who had children.

Barwick in the late 1880s. He moved to the United States and worked as a draftsman for architect Benjamin Linfoot of Philadelphia from 1891–1892, before relocating to San Francisco where he was a draftsman at Mooser and Devlin from 1892-1895. He moved to Los Angeles in 1895, and became one of the city's leading architects. Austin was also active in civic affairs in Los Angeles. He was elected President of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce in January 1930. As head of the Chamber of Commerce, Austin initiated a public- art campaign to beautify the city through the erection of statuary and monuments. One of the issues on which Austin became a leader was the need to develop a larger water system for Los Angeles. He spoke publicly and was an advocate in the business community in favor of a 1930 bond issue to raise $38.8 million to develop the city's water supply. As the Great Depression deepened in Los Angeles, Austin also advocated federal spending as a means to stimulate the economy. In April 1930, a letter from Austin to President Herbert Hoover was published in the Los Angeles Times. In it, Austin proposed the creation of an emergency fund, raised by taxation or appropriation, which could be used to develop public improvements and to provide needed employment. Austin argued that such programs were needed so that otherwise good citizens not fall \\"prey to the propaganda of Communists and agitators against our institutions.\\" In January 1931, after expressing concern that \\"we are just drifting along in this matter,\\" Austin traveled to Washington, D.C. to press for federal construction projects in Los Angeles. Austin announced that he was going east \\"with a crowbar to try and pry something loose,\\" vowing to stay as long as he felt he could help get things started. Later that year, President Hoover appointed Austin to coordinate the federal government's unemployment relief efforts in ten Southern California counties. Shortly after his appointment to the relief effort, however, Austin's wife of 29 years, Hilda Violet Austin, the mother of nine children with Austin, died at their home in Pasadena. Austin also served as the President of the State Board of Architectural Examiners, a member of the National Labor Board responsible for labor disputes in Southern California, President of the Southern California Historical Society, President of the Jonathan Club, and a 32nd degree Mason. In 1949, the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce presented Austin with its first ever Achievement Award. In 1963, Los Angeles Mayor Samuel Yorty presented Austin with a scroll commending him \\"for serving in an outstanding manner as a distinguished architect.\\" Austin died in 1963 at his home in Pasadena, California. ==Work== Griffith Observatory Hollywood Masonic Temple LA City Hall Austin's work as an architect includes: *The Beckett Mansion, Los Angeles former Residence built in 1905 for the Dr. Wesley Wilbur Beckett family *Fremont Hotel, Los Angeles (1902), 100 room hotel *Potter Hotel, a five- story, 600-room resort hotel, Santa Barbara, California, 1902-1903 (burned 1921) *Virginia Hotel, Long Beach, California, 1907, razed circa 1935 *The Carnegie Library in Anaheim, 1909, now the home of the Anaheim Museum. * Hollywood Masonic Temple, Hollywood Boulevard, directly across the street from Grauman's Chinese Theatre, 1921, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 * Guaranty Building, Hollywood, 1923 * Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, the headquarters of the Al Malaikah Temple, a division of the Shriners, 1925-1926.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. *Los Angeles City Hall, 1928. Along with John Parkinson and Albert C. Martin, Sr., Martin was hired to design what has become the most recognized building in Los Angeles. The selection of an architect for the city hall led to fierce competition among the city's leading architects. The City Council selected the firm of Curlett and Beelman, but the Board of Public Works chose Martin, Parkinson, and Austin. Controversy continued when the architects turned in drawings for 28-story tower to house a municipal government that could adequately fit into the first four floors. The city ultimately accepted the tower plan, and in March 1928 the Board of Public Works passed a resolution commending the architects \\"for the eminently satisfactory and beautiful design of the monumental building.\\" * Monrovia High School, Monrovia, California, 1928 * Arroyo Seco Bank Building, Los Angeles, 1926 * Memorial Branch Library, Los Angeles, 1930.

Over 1,000 Scouts from 25 parts of the Commonwealth and Empire accepted the invitation. 10,000 Scouts were present from the United Kingdom. The displays and ceremonies took place in Wembley Stadium. The Scouts were camped nearby in Wembley Paddocks in very cramped quarters. The Prince of Wales witnessed the displays in the stadium, presided at a campfire and stayed the night at a tent in the Paddocks. On different days the chief guests in the stadium were the Duke of York and Rudyard Kipling, on the Wolf Cubs' Day, when he saw how parts of his Jungle Books were dramatized and used to bring atmosphere and interest into the Cub program. ==Jamboree== The Wembley Jamboree helped to provide a wider variety of members at the Second World Jamboree at Ermelunden, a few miles north of Copenhagen, Denmark, which immediately followed it. Denmark has a comparatively small Scout population and doubts were expressed beforehand as to whether it would be possible for the Danish Scouts to make a success of the undertaking. The main host was Christian Holm, President of Det Danske Spejderkorps, whose daughter became known as Kim, Friend of all the World. The three Scouters responsible for the preparation, organization and administration were very young men, but they made a success of the Jamboree. Ove Holm, later to become Chief Scout of Det Danske Spejderkorps, was the Organizing Secretary and Administrator, Jens Hvass, later a state forester and Divisional Scout Commissioner in North Jutland, was the Camp Chief, and Tage Carstensen, later a lawyer in Jutland, International Commissioner and founder of the Scout Blood Transfusion Service, was in charge of all international aspects. The Second World Jamboree was officially opened on August 10, 1924, by Rear-Admiral Carl Carstensen, acting as the personal representative of King Christian X. Fourteen countries entered composite troops for the World Scout Championship, a test of Scoutcraft and stamina which continued throughout the week, and included camp inspections, hygiene, discipline, campfire songs and yells, folk dancing, swimming, handicraft, an obstacle course and patrol hike. The Boy Scouts of America won the competition, Great Britain came second and Hungary third. It was decided, however, not to renewing the idea, for fears that nationalism could harm Scout brotherhood. Lord Baden-Powell arrived at the Jamboree after opening day, and was received by a welcoming parade of all the Scouts. Just as he was about to speak, rain came down in torrents and everyone was soaked. The name given him was Bademester, Danish for \\"Bath Superintendent.\\" On the final Sunday the Scouts were inspected near the royal hunting lodge by King Christian in the pouring rain, and that afternoon Baden-Powell presented the competition prizes, saying \\"I have seen great numbers of Scouts in my life, but I have never seen any as wet as you are!\\" Because of the floods one part of the camp even had to evacuate temporarily. King Christian X and Queen Alexandrine took part in the closing ceremony of the Jamboree. The Third International Conference was held concurrently in Copenhagen. Contrasting with the 1st World Scout Jamboree in Olympia Hall, the Danish Scouts wanted everyone placed in tents, and the Scouts were organized in troops and patrols, the model used thereafter. The Scouts homestayed with Danish families during the week after the jamboree. ==See also== * World Scout Jamboree ==References== #1924 # Category:August 1924 events Category:1924 in Denmark ","title":"2nd World Scout Jamboree"},{"id":"19242061","text":"Freddy Carol Sandoval Herrera (born August 16, 1982 in Tijuana, Mexico) is a former professional baseball third baseman.

It was acquired by GTE in 1991. == History Early 20th Century=== ConTel Corporation's earliest predecessor, Telephone Communications Corporation, was founded by Charles Wohlstetter. After working as a Wall Street runner in the 1920s and as a Hollywood screenwriter in the 1930s, Wohlstetter returned to Wall Street in the 1940s and became a financier. In 1960 he made what he would later call a bad investment in an Alaskan oil company that would become the impetus for ConTel. To help turn that investment around, Wohlstetter raised $1.5 million to form a holding company, Telephone Communications Corporation. Some thirty years later, Wohlstetter's $1.5 million investment had grown into a company that had acquired and consolidated more than seven hundred fifty smaller companies with total corporate assets hovering around six billion dollars. One of the company's first acquisitions was Central Western Company, which merged with Telephone Communications in 1961 to form the new parent Continental Telephone Company. The acquisition of Central Western, along with Harfil, Inc., provided the company with customer billing, general accounting, and toll separation services. Continental based its early acquisition strategy on Kriegsspiel, a historical war game German generals played at Prussian war colleges. Wohlstetter applied the tenets of the game to telephone company operations and amassed detailed information on each independent telephone company in the United States. Many of the early acquisitions were made through exchanges of stock, including the 1964 merger with Independent Telephone Company that doubled the company's size and changed its name in the process to Continental Independent Telephone Corporation. By the close of 1964, Continental had acquired more than 100 companies operating in 30 states. The company adopted another new name, Continental Telephone Corporation, in 1965. Also during 1965 Continental acquired 65 more telephone companies and again doubled its size. By 1966 Continental had acquired more than 500 independent companies, had become the third-largest independent telephone company in the United States, and was one of the youngest companies ever listed on the New York Stock Exchange. ===1970s=== By 1970 Continental's assets had topped $1 billion, and sales volume had risen to $120 million. Aside from its dominating telephone business, the company's activities by that time had grown to include cable television systems, directory publishing, equipment leasing, and data services. With the number of small independents having diminished considerably by 1970, Continental's pace in acquiring telephone operating companies was reduced. Continental sold its cable television business in 1971, and after a sluggish economy had taken its toll on Continental's manufacturing and supply subsidiaries, those, too, were sold in 1976. Longtime president Jack Maguire resigned in 1976 because of health problems and was succeeded as by James V. Napier, a former executive vice-president. That same year, Continental became the first telephone company outside the Bell system to install a digital telephone switching system, a move that provided improved network operating efficiency, allowed the introduction of new calling features, and started the transition away from operations dominated by rural service areas. In response to the changing regulatory climate of the telephone industry, in 1978 Continental mapped out a diversification strategy into non regulated businesses. Continental's first diversification move came in 1979, with the acquisition of Executone, Inc., a New York-based communications equipment maker. ===1980s=== By 1980 Continental had two million telephone access lines in service and had established its first fiber-optic cable, a high-speed, high-capacity telecommunications transmission mode. While Continental continued the process of upgrading its telephone operations, during the early 1980s the company's focus turned to greater diversification. In July 1980 Continental entered the satellite business through a joint venture with Fairchild Industries, and a communications partnership firm, American Satellite Company, was formed to operate a network of earth-based stations that provided voice and data services. To provide technology services to accommodate its expanding needs, Continental then acquired two consulting and research firms, Network Analysis Corporation and International Computing Company. In 1981 Continental acquired Page Communications Engineers Inc., later renamed ConTel Page, which gave Continental expertise in the engineering, installation, and maintenance of satellite-to-earth stations. One year later, Continental hooked up with Fairchild Industries in a second joint venture called Space Communications Company, a provider of tracking and relay data services for such clients as the NASA. After the Federal Communications Commission opened the door to licenses for 30 cellular phone markets in 1981, Continental plunged into that field as well, acquiring sizable shares of cellular markets in Los Angeles, California; Washington, D.C.; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Continental also entered the credit card authorization business in 1981, with the purchase of National Bancard Corporation. Two years later, Continental bolstered its interest in that business segment with the purchase of the Chase Merchants Services division of Chase Manhattan Bank. In 1982 the corporation changed its name to Continental Telecom Incorporated, adopted a new corporate logo, and inaugurated an advertising campaign around the theme \\"architects of telecommunications.\\" Continental's expansion into the information services sector continued in 1982 with the purchase of STSC Inc., a computer services supplier; and Cado Systems Corporation, a maker of small business computers. That same year company revenues surpassed the $2 billion mark for the first time. In 1984 Continental formed the subsidiary ConTel Cellular Inc. to handle the corporation's growing cellular operations. A year later, Continental culminated its diversification moves and reorganized into four business sectors: telephone and cellular operations; business systems, offering voice and data processing products and services; federal systems, handling various facets of communication and information systems for government agencies; and information systems, offering telecommunications systems and services to large corporations, institutions, and government entities. As a result of the company's growing interest in the information services marketplace, in 1985 Continental acquired several computer system and software companies, including Northern Data Systems, Data Equipment Systems Corporation, and Sooner Enterprises, Inc. Continental also purchased Fairchild Industries's interests in American Satellite Co., later renamed ConTel ASC, and Space Communications Company. That same year, Continental sold its directory publishing division, its time-share services business, and its credit card authorization business. In the midst of reorganization in 1985, Napier resigned, and John N. Lemasters, former American Satellite Company president, was named president and chief executive officer. Continental's telephone operations were repositioned during the mid-1980s through numerous sales and exchanges. Subsidiaries in Nebraska, Colorado, Alaska, the Bahamas, and Barbados were sold, and operations in Michigan were exchanged for similar operations in Indiana and three southern states. The name ConTel Corporation was adopted in 1986. That same year, ConTel's new tenant services division set the stage for future growth by acquiring tenant service operations in Atlanta and Seattle. In September 1986 ConTel announced it had agreed to merge with Communications Satellite Corporation (Comsat), but by mid-1987 ConTel had called off the deal, citing Comsat's unstable financial picture. ConTel acquired Comsat's international private-line business and its very-small- aperture terminal (VSAT) satellite business in 1987, as well as Equatorial Communications Company, a provider of private satellite data networks. That same year, ConTel agreed to sell Executone, its troubled telephone interconnect business, and Texocom, ConTtel's equipment supply business. In the late 1980s, ConTel continued to narrow its focus in the information systems sectors. In 1988, it sold its computer-based business, ConTel Business Systems, and a year later disposed of ConTel Credit Corporation. ConTel Federal Systems continued to grow during that same period, and in 1988 it acquired two Eaton Corporation subsidiaries: Information Management Systems and Data Systems Services. Two years later ConTel purchased Telos Corporation, with expertise in government-preferred computer software. ConTel's tenant services and cellular businesses also got a boost in 1988 with the acquisition of RealCom Communications Corporation, an IBM tenant services subsidiary, and Southland Mobilcom Inc.'s interests in the Mobile, Alabama, and the Pensacola, Florida, cellular markets. === Acquisition by GTE === In 1990 ConTel completed the biggest acquisition in its history, a $1.3 billion purchase of McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc.'s controlling interests in 13 cellular markets, which added more than six million potential customers and doubled ConTel's cellular potential population market (known in the industry as POPs). While important, that move was eclipsed by the merger with GTE announced later that same year. Through that transition, the two former competitors were expected to integrate telephone and mobile-cellular operations and capitalize on business unit similarities in the field of satellite communications as well as in communications systems and services targeting government entities. Following action or review by more than 20 governmental bodies, in March 1991 the merger of GTE and ConTel was approved. Over half of ConTel's $6.6 billion purchase price, $3.9 billion, was assumed debt. When Charles Lee succeeded James (Rocky) L.

In October 2016, Marvel Comics and Midtown Comics jointly decided to pull from circulation J. Scott Campbell's variant cover of the first issue of The Invincible Iron Man, produced exclusively for the store, after previews of the cover were criticized for sexualizing the depicted character, 15-year-old Riri Williams.Couto, Anthony (October 20, 2016). \\"Marvel Pulls J.

The cover depicted the character, a teenaged MIT engineering student who reverse engineers one of Iron Man's armored suits to wear herself, in a midriff-baring crop top, in contrast to the more modest way in which artist Stefano Caselli depicted the character in the book's interior art. Campbell called the decision \\"unfortunate,\\" explained that his rendition of the character was intended to depict \\"a sassy, coming-of-age young woman\\". He regarded the reaction to the cover as a \\"faux controversy\\", saying, \\"I gave her a sassy 'attitude'...'sexualizing' was not intended. This reaction is odd.\\" Brian Michael Bendis, the writer on the series, was pleased with the decision to pull the cover, saying that while he liked the face Campbell had drawn on Riri when he viewed the art as a work in progress, he disliked the completed art, saying, \\"Specialty covers are not in my purview and it was being produced separately from the work of the people involved in making the comic. Not to pass the buck but that’s the fact. If I had seen a sketch or something I would have voiced similar concerns.

On March 7, 2020, Midtown Comics opened its fourth location, an outlet store at 32-11 41st Street in Astoria, Queens, the only branch not in Manhattan. The location's basement level houses an extensive collection of back issues of both recent and vintage single issues and full story arc sets, including rare issues dating from as early as the Golden Age of Comic Books. The back issue selection also includes one dollar books that the store sells for discounted prices when purchased in bulk. The store's ground floor level sells various other types of overstocked company merchandise, including newer and out-of-print graphic novels, manga, action figures and other collectibles, at discounted prices of up to 70% off their normal retail prices. The store is open only on Saturdays and Sundays, with a pick-up service for comics ordered on the company's website that would allow local residents to avoid traveling into Manhattan. The store garnered a positive review by industry reporter Heidi MacDonald, who likened the outlet to a permanent Midtown Comics warehouse sale. MacDonald lauded the attractive price points of its back issue selection, and expressed surprise at how extensive the store's graphic novel section was for an outlet store. ==Internet presence== Midtown's website was at first purely informational, but has developed into a full-scale retail website.

Iyothee Thass (20 May 1845 – 1914) was a prominent Tamil anti-caste activist and a practitioner of Siddha medicine. He famously converted to Buddhism and called upon the Paraiyars to do the same, arguing that this was their original religion. He also founded the Punchmar Mahajana Sabha in 1891 along with Rettamalai Srinivasan. Punchamas are the ones who do not come under Varna system; they are called as Avarnas. \\"Iyothee Thass\\" is the most common Anglicized spelling of his name; other spellings include Pandit C. Ayodhya Dasa, C. Iyothee Doss, C. Iyodhi Doss, C. Iyothee Thoss, K. Ayōttitācar (avarkaḷ) or K. Ayōttitāsa (paṇṭitaravarkaḷ). == Early life == Iyothee Thass possessed deep knowledge in Tamil, Siddha medicine and philosophy, and literary knowledge in languages such as English, Sanskrit and Pali. Iyothee Thass was born Kathavarayan on 20 May 1845 in Thousand Lights, a neighbourhood in Madras (now Chennai), and later migrated to the Nilgiris district. His family followed Vaishnavism and on that basis he named his children Madhavaram, Pattabhiraman, Janaki, Raman and Rasaram. His grandfather worked for George Harrington in Ootacamund (now Ooty) and little Kathavarayan profited immensely from this association. == Assumption of leadership of Scheduled Caste == In the 1870s, Iyothee Thass organized the Todas and other tribes of the Nilgiri Hills into a formidable force. In 1876, Thass established the Advaidananda Sabha and launched a magazine called Dravida Pandian in collaboration with Rev. John Rathinam. In 1886, Thass issued a revolutionary declaration that Scheduled caste people (Dalits) were not Hindus. Following this declaration, he established the \\"Dravida Mahajana Sabha\\" in 1891. During the 1891 census, he urged the members of Scheduled castes to register themselves as \\"Casteless Dravidians\\" instead of identifying themselves as Hindus. His activities served as an inspiration to Sri Lanka's Buddhist revivalist Anagarika Dharmapala. == Conversion to Buddhism == Iyothee Thass met Colonel H. S. Olcott with his followers and expressed a sincere desire to convert to Buddhism. According to Thass, the Paraiyars of Tamilakam were originally Buddhists and owned the land which had later been robbed from them by Aryan invaders. With Olcott's help, Thass was able to visit Ceylon and obtain diksha from the Sinhalese Buddhist monk Bikkhu Sumangala Nayake. On returning, Thass established the Sakya Buddhist Society in Madras with branches all over South India. The Sakya Buddhist Society was also known as the Indian Buddhist Association and was established in the year 1898. == Political activism and later life == On 19 June 1907, Iyothee Thass launched a Tamil newspaper called Oru Paisa Tamizhan or One Paise Tamilian and Dravidia Pandian. Iyothee Thass died in 1914 at the age of 69. == Legacy == Iyothee Thass remains the first recognized anti-caste leader of the Madras Presidency. In many ways, Periyar, Dravidar Kazhagam, and B. R. Ambedkar are inheritors of his legacy. He was also the first notable Scheduled Caste leader to embrace Buddhism. However, Iyothee Thass was largely forgotten until recent times when the Dalit Sahitya Academy, a publishing house owned by Dalit Ezhilmalai, published his writings. Ezhilmalai, then the Union Health Minister, also made a desired to name the planned National Center for Siddha Research after the leader. However, the proposal did not come into effect until 2005, when vehement protests by Se. Ku. Tamilarasan of the Republican Party of India (RPI) forced the Government to take serious note of the matter. The institute for Siddha Research (National Institute of Siddha) was subsequently inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Dr Anbumani Ramadoss the then Union Health Minister on 3 September 2005 and named it after the anti-caste Buddhist leader. At its inauguration, the hospital had 120 beds. The patients were treated as per the traditional system of Siddha medicine. A commemorative postage stamp on him was issued on 21 October 2005. His works are nationalized and solatium was given to their legal heirs in 2008. == Criticism == In the early part of the 20th century, he indulged in vehement condemnation of the Swadeshi movement and the nationalist press remarking that he could \\"locate the power of the modern secular brahmin in the control he wielded over public opinion.\\" == See also == *Dalit Buddhist Movement * Dalit Ezhilmalai == References  Further reading == * * * Balasubramaniam, J. * Leonard, Dickens.

The killings were part of a punitive campaign in retaliation for the massacre of shipwrecked Dutch sailors in two separate incidents in 1622 and 1631 by natives of the island. ==Background== Two years before the Dutch East India Company established a presence on Taiwan in 1624, a Dutch ship named the Golden Lion (Dutch:') was wrecked on the coral reefs of Liuqiu Island. The entire crew was killed by the native inhabitants. Subsequently in 1631 a yacht named the ' was also wrecked on the treacherous reefs, with survivors (numbering around fifty) battling the Lameyans for two days before being overwhelmed and slaughtered to a man. Following the murder of the ' survivors, the island was sometimes referred to by the Dutch as ' (\\"Golden Lion Island\\"). There was a desire at the very highest levels of the Dutch East India Company not to let the killings go unpunished, with Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies Hendrik Brouwer ordering Governor Hans Putmans to \\"punish and exterminate the people of [...] the Golden Lion Island as an example for their murderous actions committed against our people.\\" ==Punitive expedition campaigns== Putmans was determined to assault Liuqiu as soon as possible, at one stage requesting that the warriors of Mattau assist them in punishing the islanders. The first expedition arrived in 1633, led by Claes Bruijn and consisting of 250 Dutch soldiers, forty Han Chinese pirates and 250 Aboriginal Formosans. It met with little success, but they did manage to find evidence of the murdered crew of the Beverwijck, including coins, copper from the ship's galley and a Dutch hat. They also learned that a large cave on the island was used by the natives as a refuge in times of trouble. In 1636, a larger expedition under Jan Jurriansz van Lingga landed on the island, this time chasing the Lameyans into the cave. The Dutch and their allies proceeded to block up all the entrances, leaving small holes where pans of burning pitch and sulphur were placed. Some of the trapped Lameyans managed to crawl out of the holes, where they were captured by the Dutch force. On May 4, after the poisonous fumes had been constantly produced for eight days (during which the cries of those inside could be clearly heard), the cave grew still and the entrances were unblocked. When soldiers entered to investigate, they found the corpses of around 300 men, women and children who had been suffocated by the fumes. ==Aftermath== The captured men of the island were put to work as slaves in both Taiwan and Batavia. The women and children were put up in the homes of Dutch people in Taiwan as servants; some later became wives for Dutch men. There were numerous other raids following this expedition until the island was finally completely depopulated in 1645 when a Chinese merchant who had rented rights to the island from the Dutch East India Company removed the last thirteen inhabitants. ==Alternate stories== There have been a number of erroneous accounts of the incident, the most obvious of which is the plaque outside the cave where the massacre occurred. This account is almost completely false from start to finish, as noted by several writers. ==See also== *Taiwan under Dutch rule ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:Dutch Formosa Category:Massacres in Taiwan Category:1636 in Taiwan Category:Military history of the Dutch East India Company Category:Massacres committed by the Dutch East India Company ","title":"Lamey Island Massacre"},{"id":"19242335","text":"The California Festival of Beers is an annual beer festival and one of America's largest and oldest regional beer tastingsModern Brewery Age. 11 Feb 1991.

Wasilla is located 29 miles (47 km) north-east of the port of Anchorage, and is the largest population center in the Mat-Su Valley. At the conclusion of Palin's tenure as mayor in 2002, the city had about 6,300 residents, and is now the fifth largest city in the state. The four larger cities in Alaska are Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, and Sitka. Term limits prevented Palin from running for a third term as mayor. ==City Council of Wasilla== Palin was elected twice to the City Council of Wasilla, Alaska, in 1992 and 1995. Wasilla's city councillors serve three-year terms.Wasilla Municipal Code section 2.04.030 Palin says she entered politics because she was concerned that revenue from a new Wasilla sales tax would not be spent wisely. Palin's first foray into politics was in 1992, when the then 28-year-old ran for Wasilla city council against John Hartrick, a local telephone company worker. She won 530 votes against Hartrick's 310. On the council, she successfully opposed a measure to curtail the hours at Wasilla's bars by two hours. This surprised Hartrick because she was then a member of a church that advocated abstinence from alcohol. After serving on the city council for three years, she ran for reelection against R'nita Rogers in 1995, winning 413 votes to Rogers' 185. Palin did not complete her second term on the city council because she ran for mayor in 1996. ===Remark about library book=== According to Laura Chase of Wasilla, and former Wasilla Mayor John Stein, Palin mentioned in 1995 that she saw the book Daddy's Roommate in the public library and did not think that it belonged there. Chase later became Palin's campaign manager for mayor in 1996, when Palin defeated John Stein, but Chase had a falling out with Palin and then became a vocal critic.Gargill, David. “Mystery, Alaska”, The National (October 3, 2008). City of Wasilla Library records indicate that there was never a request for the library to remove the book and that no books were ever censored or banned. A New York Times article in 2008 mentioned the Daddy's Roommate episode, and intimated that the episode is relevant to accusations that Palin may be sympathetic to censorship. The Times article was subsequently criticized by the Times' own ombudsman for presenting \\"confusing and incomplete\\" anecdotes about Palin.Hoyt, Clark. “Make it Airtight,” New York Times (September 21, 2008). The McCain-Palin campaign said that Palin was not advocating censorship. Eventually, the Wasilla Library did remove the book in question, according to Kathy Martin-Albright who became library director in 2005: \\"The books were removed as part of ongoing collection development and not due to the subject matter presented in the books.\\"Oder, Norman. “LJ Talks to Wasilla Public Library Director KJ (Kathy) Martin-Albright,” Library Journal (October 13, 2008). ==1996 campaign for Wasilla Mayor== The duties of Wasilla's MayorDuties of Wasilla's mayor City of Wasilla website, retrieved 2010-11-19. are more circumscribed than those of many other mayors in the United States. Firefighting and schools are overseen by the Matanuska-Susitna Borough government, and the state government handles social services and environmental regulation, such as storm water management for building projects. Palin told the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman that she could handle the job of Mayor without any assistance from veteran town officials: \\"It's not rocket science. It's $6 million and 53 employees.\\" In 1996, Palin had been serving on the Wasilla City Council for four years, and decided to run for Mayor. She defeated three-term incumbent John Stein, running on a platform of \\"fresh ideas and energy\\". In the campaign, she vowed to replace \\"stale leadership\\" and criticized Stein for wasteful spending and high taxes. p. 45. She also introduced campaign issues such as abortion, gun rights, and term limits into the race. Although the mayoral election was non-partisan, the state Republican party ran advertisements on her behalf. Palin did not brandish her religious views during that campaign, but did play up her church work. A local cable TV program referred to Palin as Wasilla's first \\"Christian Mayor,\\" which prompted an objection from Stein who noted that he and several previous Mayors of Wasilla were Christian. ==First term== Upon taking office in October 1996, she began to make staffing changes. She eliminated the position of museum director and asked for updated resumes and resignation letters from Wasilla police chief Irl Stambaugh, public works director Jack Felton, finance director Duane Dvorak, and librarian Mary Ellen Emmons. She temporarily required department heads to get her approval before talking to reporters, stating they first needed to become better acquainted with her policies. As promised during her campaign, she reduced her own salary by 10%, from $68,000 to $61,200; she also reduced her workload by hiring a new City Administrator. By 1999, the City Council had raised her salary back to $68,000. In her first term, state Republican party leaders began grooming her for higher office. Her first months in office were so rocky that there was talk of a recall attempt in 1997, which fizzled. Her recollection was that she \\"grew tremendously in my early months as mayor\\". Palin would gain favor with Wasillans. She kept a jar with the names of Wasilla residents on her desk, and once a week she pulled a name from it and picked up the phone. She would ask: \\"How's the city doing?\\" ===Police department matters=== Stambaugh's dismissal Palin gave a signed letter to Police Chief Stambaugh on January 30, 1997 stating: \\"I do not feel I have your full support in my efforts to govern the city of Wasilla. Therefore I intend to terminate your employment.\\" Palin spoke with Stambaugh at least three times about his continued service, but ultimately he was fired as planned. Stambaugh filed a lawsuit claiming discrimination and that his dismissal was politically motivated. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a court that found the mayor has the right to fire city employees even for political reasons or for no reason at all and ordered Stambaugh to pay $22,000 of Palin's legal expenses. As mayor of Wasilla, Palin was in charge of the city Police Department, consisting of 25 officers and Chief of Police, Charlie Fannon. She was credited with strengthening the Police Department. She would later come into conflict with Fannon when he ran for political office using campaign ads containing a false endorsement from Palin. Palin actually supported another candidate, Curt Menard. HB 270 In 2000, state legislators in Alaska learned that some police agencies were charging rape victims or their insurance companies for forensic medical examination necessary to gather evidence, which can cost $500 to $1200. A bill was proposed to require police departments to cover the cost of the exams and became law later the same year. Fannon responded to the new law by expressing concern about the cost of the rape kits, stating \\"In the past we've charged the cost of exams to the victim's insurance company when possible. I just don't want to see any more burden put on the taxpayer ... Ultimately it is the criminal who should bear the burden of the added costs.\\". The City of Wasilla Office of the Mayor reported searching records extending \\"back to the beginning of fiscal year 2000\\", and \\"found no record of sexual assault victims billed for forensic exams\\".Keller, Dianne M.\\"Re:Billing of Sexual Assault Victims for Forensic Exams\\". Office of the Mayor, City of Wasilla. Retrieved 2010-11-18. The Wasilla newspaper, The Frontiersman, conducted an e-mail interview with Palin, comprising fourteen questions: Also in 2008, Palin's spokeswoman reiterated her response, adding, \\"Gov. Palin's position could not be more clear. To suggest otherwise is a deliberate misrepresentation of her commitment to supporting victims and bringing violent criminals to justice.\\" ===Library matters=== According to librarian Mary Ellen Emmons, she and Palin discussed the question of library censorship on October 28, 1996. Emmons recalls Palin asking if Emmons would object to censorship, and raising the possibility of people circling the library in protest, to which Emmons replied that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) would get involved. In early December, Palin spoke publicly about the issue, using it as an example of a discussion she'd had with her department heads, stating that \\"many issues were discussed, both rhetorical and realistic in nature.\\" Anne Kilkenny, a long- time registered Democrat and activistAn e-mail to friends from Wasilla becomes Internet hit, Anchorage Daily News (mcclatchydc.com), 2008-09-08. Retrieved 2010-11-18. who was at the meeting of October 28, on Palin's statement: \\"There's no way I thought it was rhetorical\\".Palin did not ban books in Wasilla as mayor USA Today access December 5, 2008 Palin stated that the issue of censorship \\"was discussed in the context of a professional question being asked in regards to library policy\\" and that she did not have a specific list of books in mind. \\"This is different than a normal book-selection procedure or a book-challenge policy,\\" Emmons said. \\"She was asking me how I would deal with her saying a book can't be in the library.\\" Emmons stated that she supported the ability of people to challenge the selection and availability of library material according to a set of procedures previously established by the city of Wasilla. She also indicated that this discussion with Palin arose at a time when she was trying to help Wasilla's procedural policies become more similar to those established by the neighboring Mat-Su Borough which Emmons described as \\"a good process, and almost all public libraries have one.\\" Emmons added that she suspected Palin might encourage a departure from those procedures. From 1986 to 2008, several books acquired by the Wasilla Public Library were challenged by various citizens as poor selections, such as a challenge to Heather Has Two Mommies in 1997. None of the challenged books were opposed or removed by Palin.Mooney, Brian. “Wasilla besieged by researchers”, Boston Globe (September 10, 2008). Palin gave a signed letter to Emmons on January 30, 1997 stating: \\"I do not feel I have your full support in my efforts to govern the city of Wasilla. Therefore I intend to terminate your employment...\\" This was the same day Palin gave a similar letter to Police Chief Stambaugh; Emmons as well as Stambaugh had publicly supported Palin's defeated mayoral opponent, John Stein. Palin rescinded the firing of Emmons the next day after meeting with her and after what the Anchorage Daily News called \\"a wave of public support for Emmons.\\" Palin stated that her concerns had been alleviated, and that Emmons agreed to support Palin's plan to merge the town's library and museum operations. ===Taxes and spending=== Due to income generated by a 2% sales tax that was enacted prior to her election, Palin was able to cut property taxes by 75% and to eliminate personal property and business inventory taxes. She also secured funding for improvements to the roads and sewers. She reduced spending on the town museum and prevented building of a new library and city hall, while putting in bike paths, and she was able to get funding for storm-water treatment in order to protect the region's many lakes. ==Campaign for reelection in 1999== Palin ran for re- election against Stein in 1999Johnson, Kaylene (2008). Sarah. p. 65 and was returned to office by a margin of 909 to 292 votes. Palin was also elected president of the Alaska Conference of Mayors. Palin wore a Buchanan button during a visit by presidential candidate Pat Buchanan in 1999, but Palin was a co-chair on the Alaska campaign of rival presidential candidate Steve Forbes in 2000. Shortly after wearing the Buchanan button, Palin responded to a newspaper article about it: \\"When presidential candidates visit our community, I am always happy to meet them. I'll even put on their button when handed one as a polite gesture of respect ... The article may have left your readers with the perception that I am endorsing this candidate, as opposed to welcoming his visit to Wasilla.\\" ==Second termTaxes, borrowing and spending=== According to Dianne M. Keller, who served on the city council when Palin was mayor and would later serve as mayor herself, Wasilla's budgets and tax receipts increased during Palin's terms as mayor, but much of that increase was caused by growth of the city. In the last two years of Palin's mayoralty alone, Wasilla's population grew roughly 13%. Democratic activist Anne Kilkenny claimed that during Palin's six years as mayor, general government expenditures increased by over 33%, while city taxes went up by 38%.“Numbers right, context missing”, Politifact.com from St. Petersburg Times and Congressional Quarterly (August 31, 2008). The property tax rate fell from 2 mils to .5 mils under Palin. The sales tax rate increased from 2 percent to 2.5 percent (and was changed to include everything, even food purchases), and that increase was approved by voter referendum to pay off the city's new sports complex. Voters also approved a bond issue for road improvements. According to PolitiFact, when Palin took office, she inherited a long-term city debt of just over a million dollars and that debt increased to about $25 million by the time she left office. The big-ticket items responsible for the debt were: $14.7 million for the new multi-use sports complex; $5.5 million for street projects; and $3 million for water improvement projects. Because of economic growth, Keller anticipates that Wasilla can stop charging the extra .5 percent sales tax two years sooner than expected. ===Sports complex=== During her second term as mayor, Palin introduced a ballot measure proposing construction of a municipal sports center to be financed by the 0.5% sales tax increase. The $14.7 million Curtis D. Menard Memorial Sports Center was built on time and under budget, but cost the city an additional $1.3 million due to an eminent domain lawsuit caused by a failure to obtain legal ownership of the property before beginning construction. In 2001, the judge hearing the initial property dispute had ruled for the city and the city's attorney advised the city to proceed with construction; subsequently the judge reversed himself and ruled that the city had never signed the proper papers. CBS News obtained 86 pages of city council documents showing Palin sought to justify the tax increase to fund the sports complex partly because the private sector had not stepped in to fill the gap. She writes that the ice rink offers an opportunity for government to stop social ills like drug abuse and juvenile delinquency before they start.\\"Palin: Government Can Fix Social Ills\\", CBS News (September 9, 2008) ===Federal funding=== During her second term, Palin joined with nearby communities in jointly hiring the Anchorage-based firm of Robertson, Monagle & Eastaugh to lobby for earmarks for Wasilla. The effort was led by Steven Silver, a former chief of staff for Senator Ted Stevens, and the firm secured nearly $27 million in earmarked funds for public and private entities in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, but only $7.95 million of that amount went to the Wasilla city government. Earmarks from the firm included $500,000 for a youth shelter, $1.9 million for a transportation hub, $900,000 for sewer repairs, and $15 million for a rail project linking Wasilla and the ski resort community of Girdwood. Earmark requests from this firm were criticized by Senator John McCain on three occasions,: \\"Three times in recent years, the Arizona senator's lists of 'objectionable' pork spending have included earmarks requested by his new running mate ... Wasilla received $11.9 million in earmarks from 2000 to 2003.\\" but Palin was only involved in one of those three. ==Mayoral succession== In 2002, term limits prevented Palin from running for a third term as mayor. Palin's pro-choice Democratic stepmother- in-law, Faye Palin, ran for the office but lost to Republican Dianne Keller, who received Palin's endorsement. ==Post-mayoral years== In 2002, Palin ran for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor, coming in second to Loren Leman in a five-way Republican primary. The Republican ticket of U.S. Senator Frank Murkowski and Leman won the November 2002 election. When Murkowski resigned from his long-held U.S. Senate seat in December 2002 to become governor, he considered appointing Palin to replace him in the Senate, but chose his daughter, Lisa Murkowski, who was then an Alaskan state representative. Governor Murkowski appointed Palin to the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. She chaired the Commission beginning in 2003, serving as Ethics Supervisor. Palin resigned in January 2004, protesting what she called the \\"lack of ethics\\" of fellow Republican members. Johnson, Kaylene (2008). Sarah. p. 80 After resigning, Palin filed a formal complaint against Oil and Gas Conservation Commissioner Randy Ruedrich, also the chair of the state Republican Party, accusing him of doing work for the party on public time and of working closely with a company he was supposed to be regulating. She also joined with Democratic legislator Eric Croft to file a complaint against Gregg Renkes, a former Alaskan Attorney General, accusing him of having a financial conflict of interest in negotiating a coal exporting trade agreement, while Renkes was the subject of investigation and after records suggesting a possible conflict of interest had been released to the public. Ruedrich and Renkes both resigned and Ruedrich paid a record $12,000 fine. From 2003 to June 2005, Palin served as one of three directors of \\"Ted Stevens Excellence in Public Service, Inc.,\\" a 527 group designed to provide political training for Republican women in Alaska. In 2004, Palin told the Anchorage Daily News that she had decided not to run for the U.S. Senate that year, against the Republican incumbent, Lisa Murkowski, because her teenage son opposed it. Palin said, \\"How could I be the team mom if I was a U.S. Senator?\\" ==See also== * Governorship of Sarah Palin * Electoral history of Sarah Palin * Political positions of Sarah Palin ==References== Category:1990s in Alaska Category:2000s in Alaska Palin, Sarah Category:Mayoralties of municipalities in the United States Palin, Sarah early Category:Sarah Palin Category:Wasilla, Alaska ","title":"Early political career of Sarah Palin"},{"id":"19242365","text":"Lock 18 of the Enlarged Erie Canal is located off North Mohawk Street in Cohoes, New York, United States.

The team are joined by Go-on Wings and their Wing Engines, as well as the Ancient Engines, as they all together battle the Gaiark as well as other evil villains from other Braneworlds. ==Episodes== The episodes (whose titles contain a kanji phrase followed by a katakana phrase) are titled as , or \\"GP\\" for short, each ending with a Go-on Seminar, a Gaiark Seminar, or the one-time Samurai Seminar, to explain a trivial fact relating to a character or element in the show. The eyecatch has the five main Engines racing, with a different one winning each week (or all in the last episode). ==FilmsBoom Boom! Bang Bang! GekijōBang!!=== was released in theaters on August 9, 2008, as a double bill with the Kamen Rider Kiva movie, King of the Castle in the Demon World. The film features guest stars Sonim, Jyunichi Haruta (previously in Kagaku Sentai Dynaman and Dai Sentai Goggle V), Kento Handa (previously in Kamen Rider 555), Mika Kikuchi (previously in Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger), Naoya Uchida (previously in Denshi Sentai Denziman), and Masaya Matsukaze (previously in Denji Sentai Megaranger). The events of the movie take place between GPs 31 and 32. ===Go-onger vs. Gekiranger=== Initially scheduled for DVD release on March 21, 2009, will feature the return of Hiroki Suzuki, Mina Fukui, Manpei Takagi, Riki Miura, Sotaro, Hirofumi Araki, Yuka Hirata, Naoki Kawano, and Kazue Itoh reprising their roles as Jyan Kandou, Ran Uzaki, Retu Fukami, Gou Fukami, Ken Hisatsu, Rio, Mere, Long, and Miki Masaki from Juken Sentai Gekiranger. The story features the Three Gaiark Ministers and their teaming up with the last remaining member of the , , practicer of the who is after the golden orb that Long was sealed in. To defeat their common foes, the Go- ongers, the Go-on Wings, and the Gekirangers team up with the revived Rio and Mere to fight the new evil team and stop them from releasing Long. On December 6, 2008, several of the cast members of Go-onger announced on their blogs that there is going to be a second Go-onger movie. The next day, Toei announced on its Go-onger website that the film was going to be Go-onger vs. Gekiranger, and that it was to commemorate the 15th of the Super Sentai V-Cinema VS Series, having started initially with J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai vs. Gorenger in 1978 and revived annually with Chouriki Sentai Ohranger vs. Kakuranger in 1996. The film was released to theaters on January 24, 2009. The events of the movie take place between GPs 37 and 38. ===Shinkenger vs. Go-onger=== was released in theaters on January 30, 2010, featuring a crossover between the Samurai Sentai Shinkenger and Go-onger casts and characters. The heroes of Tensou Sentai Goseiger also make a cameo appearance in the film. ===10 Years Grand Prix=== was released direct-to-video on September 26, 2018, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the premiere of the series, unlike the two other 10 Years After films Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger: 10 Years After and Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger: 10 Years After which take place 10 years after the finale. ==Special DVD== is a special DVD in which Bomper lets each of the Go-ongers do their own special seminar on ecology and also tie into the three Gaiark Pollution Ministers. Sōsuke and Gunpei start by helping Renn show how water and oil can't be mixed as Speedor covers Kegalesia and her Water Savage Machine Beasts. Then Hanto shows how clean air is essential for people in an exercise experiment that nearly suffocates Gunpei from breathing in too much polluted air and being saved by inhaling helium by mistake as Speedor explains about Kitaneidas and his Savage Air Machine Beasts along with the Go-on Wings. After Gunpei's voice returns to normal, Saki begins her lesson though unaware she was supposed to teach a lesson though she grew strawberries from polluted soil and made a cake from strawberries that she grew in clean soil. As Sōsuke and Gunpei get the tea for her, Speedor talks about Yogostien and his Savage Machine Beasts, as well Hiramechimedes and all the events leading to Yogostein's death. The last seminar is cut short when Hiramechimedes' cross- dressing older brother Kokorootomedes goes after Sōsuke out of revenge, but is destroyed by Go-on Red's Kankan Kong Express Speedor Version after a tough fight. Just as Gunpei decides to give a seminar on how to be cool like himself, Bomper says that they are out of time and the seminars are over. The events of the specials take place between GPs 37 and 38. ==Cast== *: *: *: *: *: *: *: *: **Oikawa also had a cameo appearance in the final episode as , a customer, at Saki's bakery. ===Voice actors=== *: *: *: *: *: *: *: *: *: *: *, : *: *: ==International broadcast== {  - !

It operates two entertainment venues at Gen Con Indy: True Dungeon and True Dungeon Fantasy Tavern. True Adventures is notable because their signature event, True Dungeon, is \\"the single most popular event\\" at Gen Con, drawing people to the convention just for it.\\"DOUGLAS EQUILS: People fly to Gen Con just for 'True Dungeon.'\\" (Laws 2007, p154) The event is also notable for its scale; about 3,000 players play in groups of up to eight people (more recently ten) over four days each year. The company also hosted the event True Heroes in 2004 and 2005. True Adventures ran these events at Gen Con SoCal when the convention was still in existence. The company grew out of Martin's work in creating elaborate props and puzzles for his Dungeons & Dragons game. ==True Dungeon== Although True Dungeon shares some characteristics with live action roleplaying (LARP) games,\\"JEFF MARTIN: It's a walk-through, live action dungeon where you get to experience what it feels like to have an adventure.\\" (Laws 2007, p153) the game's developers don't consider it a LARP.\\"Not a LARP, True Dungeon instead focuses on problem solving, teamwork and tactics while providing exciting sets and interactive props.\\" \\"JEFF MARTIN: ... It's not a LARP....\\" (Laws 2007, p153) While players are free to role-play particular characters, True Dungeon does not emphasize role-playing aspects; characters lack backgrounds and names. Instead characters primarily are collections of spells and statistics useful for solving puzzles and battling opponents. The rules mechanics are loosely based on those of Dungeons & Dragons. Combat is played out by sliding weapon counters along a waist-high shuffleboard table. \\"Combat is handled in a shuffle-board like fashion. The shuffle board has an image of the nasty being fought. The image is sectioned off with 'to-hit' numbers. Those participating in the combat place one of their weapon tokens in a slider, and slide it toward the image, hoping to score a hit. (Nelson 2006) True Dungeon focuses on riddle and puzzle solving along with the shuffle board combat system. Jeff Martin originally ran yearly immersive games of this sort for groups of friends. Gen Con owner Peter Adkison was invited to one of these events, then running under the name \\"Jeff Con\\" for about 30 people.\\"PETER ADKISON: ... He [Jeff] was running a small convention called Jeff Con, which was literally 30 people. But for those 30 people he was running a fully immersive role-playing event out of a hotel. I got this invitation in the mail.... ...it was an invitation to attend Jeff Con. I went out in early '03 and fell in love with the event.\\" (Laws 2007, p153-154) After his experience, Adkison invited Martin to run the game at Gen Con after participating in one of Martin's events. True Dungeon was first run at Gen Con Indy in 2003. The first event was arranged at the last minute; there was no promotion and tickets were not in Gen Con's system.\\"JEFF MARTIN: It was a last-minute thing; there was no promotion for it. It wasn't even in the program book. We weren't even in the Gen Con ticketing system....\\" (Laws 2007, p154) The events takes about 100 volunteers to run.\\"JEFF MARTIN: ... It takes about a hundred volunteers to run it.\\" (Laws 2007, p154) The 2006 event supplies filled two semi-trailers.\\"JEFF MARTIN: ... In 2006 we took two completely full 53-foot semi-trailers with us.\\" (Laws 2007, p154) Equipment for player characters exists in the form of \\"treasure tokens\\". These are marked plastic tokens indicating various pieces of traditional Dungeons & Dragons equipment. Examples include rope, small steel mirrors, weapons, and armor. In 2005 players were given a random weapon and random armor; they were expected to trade within their group to optimize their equipment usage. In 2006 players were given a random bag of 10 tokens.\\"You get a bag of random tokens before the True Dungeon starts....\\" (Nelson 2006) Since the game began players could also purchase additional bags of random tokens. There is a substantial after- market for these tradable tokens. True Dungeon provides an interactive environment, complete with multiple solutions to many problems. There are a small number of NPCs as the plot requires. Players move through various rooms in the game world. Each room contains a challenge in either the form of a puzzle, a fight, or both.\\"Every room has a challenge of sorts—either a puzzle- type and/or a combat.\\" (Nelson 2006) The puzzles can be very difficult and the game has a high rate of character death, although the game's lethality has dropped over the years. Jeff Martin said of the 2004 Gen Con Indy game that only 20% of characters survived,\\"There were 1505 players in 215 with a survival rate of about 20%.\\" while in 2005 42% did.\\"TD had a survival rate of 42% ... with 1505 players....\\" Closer to live action role-playing, players are expected to physically explore their surroundings, not simply describing interactions with the gamemaster\\"The room can be interacted with too! For example, if you want to search around for treasures or a clue, you need to physically move stuff around.\\" (Nelson 2006) Many interactions do require gamemaster interaction, with some details of the environment described to players by the gamemaster assigned to each room.\\"Every room has a GM, which describes to the whole party what is going on.\\" (Nelson 2006) The first few years, each group of players were accompanied by a gamemaster throughout the dungeon. In 2005, this was switched to having a gamemaster assigned to each room to ensure more consistent rulings for a given room.\\"The event has grown tremendously, and we will greatly improve the quality of the experience this year by moving to the 'one-DM-per-room' staffing model\\" (aeon 2005) To maximize throughput of players, each room of the dungeon has a group of players in it. Groups all advance to the next room simultaneously. As a result, each room has a hard time limit. If players finish early, they must wait for the time limit to expire before advancing. If the players are too slow, they are penalized hit points and are moved into the next room. The plot for each dungeon usually provides a reason for the time limit. One year the plot specified that the characters were fleeing lizardmen. Sometimes the rooms themselves explain the time limit; in 2005 one room had a moving wall that would crush characters who failed to open the locked door into the next room quickly enough. Player success in True Dungeon (and True Heroes) is tracked in the form of Experience Points. Players with larger numbers of Experience Points (or XP) are given levels. These levels have no impact on the gameplay, but offer benefits outside of the game. ===Events=== In 2005 two different adventures were run in parallel: \\"Battle Below Castle Greyhawk\\" and \\"Assault Above Castle Greyhawk\\".\\"Last year, two separate adventures ran simultaneously.\\" (Nelson 2006) In the last room of one of the adventures players could send a brief message to the other adventure, a clue to help the second party complete their last room. Players were free to play both adventures. In 2006 two very similar copies of the same adventure, \\"Escape from the Spider Cult\\", were run in parallel, effectively doubling the number of slots available for players.\\"A change from last year’s version was the running of only one adventure, but having two identical dungeons running at the same time.\\" (Nelson 2006) The playable classes were also expanded to include Barbarian, Druid, and Monk, in addition to the previous Wizard, Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, Ranger and Bard. In 2007, again two very similar copies of the same adventure, \\"Race Across Greyhawk\\", were run in parallel. But this year, one dungeon was more combat oriented while the other was more puzzle oriented.One adventure, labeled \\"Race Across Greyhawk (Combat)\\" will offer players a more combat-oriented scenario. Its counterpart entitled \\"Race Across Greyhawk (Puzzle)\\" will challenge players with more puzzles than melee. This year also marked the addition of live monsters to the game including a shambling mound, a medusa, and a stone golem. 2008's adventure was entitled \\"Hope of the Lost.\\" The plot line had the players infiltrating a temple of Pelor that had been taken over by evil forces. Again two versions were run in parallel, a \\"combat\\" version and a \\"puzzle\\" version. Like 2005's game, groups on the two paths had to work together at the very end to win. Unlike the 2005 year, the two teams actually joined up in the same room. The puzzle group had to solve a puzzle while the combat group had to fight a monster. Both groups had to succeed to win. In 2009 True Adventures ran four events. \\"Five Aspects\\" was a revised version of the original 2004 game. \\"Smoak\\" was a new full length event. \\"Getting In\\" was a shorter event. \\"True Grind\\" was an all combat event. In 2010 True Adventures ran three events. \\"The Evading Hilt\\" offered 1,500 tickets, \\"DragonWard\\" offered 3,000 tickets and the True Grind event offered around 300 tickets. In 2011 True Adventures ran three events. \\"Lair of the Sea-Lich\\", \\"Dragon's Redoubt\\" and the True Grind. In 2012 True Adventures ran three events. \\"Giants' Travail\\", \\"Draco-Lich Undone\\" and the True Grind. In 2013 True Adventures ran three events for total of 7,500 tickets available. \\"Lycans Afoot\\" available in Puzzle and Combat versions, \\"Golembane\\" available in Puzzle and Combat versions, and the True Grind. Lycans Afoot and Golembane offer 4 levels of challenge: Non-Lethal, Normal, Hardcore, and Nightmare. In 2014 True Adventures ran two events (\\"Flight of the Zephyr\\", \\"Into the Viper's Pit\\") and the True Grind. In 2015 True Adventures ran a retro event (\\"Decent into the Underdark\\") at Who's Yer Con and a True Grind. True dungeon also premiered two new events (Into the Underdark & Sable Gauntlet) and a grind at Gen con. In 2016 True Adventures ran a retro event at Gamehole Con (\\"Deeperdark redux\\") and a True Grind. True dungeon also premiered two new events (Behold Her Majesty & Into the Deeperdark) and a grind at Gen con. In 2017 True Adventures ran a solo anniversary convention (True dungeon celebration) at which they presented a retro event (\\"Beneath Castle Altus\\"), and a massive \\"raid style\\" event called True horde. True Adventures also attended Origins Game Fair rerunning their 2016 adventures and premiered two new dungeons and a grind event at Gencon (The Moongate Maze & Dancing Among Stones) based on Patrick Rothfuss Kingkiller Chronicle world. In 2018 True Adventures began their season at Origins game fair offering a final showing of their 2017 \\"Kingkiller: adventures and premiering the first of their N series modules (\\"Astral Journey to the Bliss\\"), they also offered two patron only events. A best of dungeon called \\"Into the shadowlands\\" and another showing of the true horde raid. At gencon true adventures offered all 3 N series modules (\\"Astral Journey to the Bliss\\",\\"Odin's Haven\\", and \\"The Vault of the all father\\") as well as a Grind (\\"Pandemonium and Back\\") and a seal deck throwback of the 2014 adventure \\"Into the Viper's Pit\\". ==True Dungeon Fantasy Tavern== In 2005, True Dungeon added a tavern area in front of the True Dungeon adventures proper.\\"Sponsored by Wizards of the Coast, True Dungeon returns to Gen Con again this year and promises even more enjoyment than last time with the introduction of the True Dungeon Fantasy Tavern.\\" The area is decorated as a stereotypical fantasy tavern.\\"We wanted to create an awesome place for gamers to 'geek out' and revel in drinking in a medieval fantasy inn.\\" (aeon 2005) Drinks are available for purchase. The area is intended to be a fantasy- themed area for gamers to congregate and socialize. It also acts as a staging area for players waiting for their session of True Dungeon. A shuffle board is available to practice combat, and many players meet here to trade tokens. In 2006 players with a ticket for the day's event could enter the tavern. Any player with enough Experience Points to be fourth level could also enter. Anyone else wishing to enter needed to pay a fee. ==True Craft== True Craft was a quest based mini game that took place during the True Dungeon event held at Gen Con 2012. Players could turn in True craft tokens to costumed NPCs in order to participate in carnival styled games which could grant in game bonuses during the main True Dungeon events held that year. ==True Heroes== True Heroes was a superhero-themed game that is played much like True Dungeon. It was produced in conjunction with Upper Deck Entertainment and Marvel Comics. Combat involved throwing small balls containing magnets at metal targets. Combat also used aspects of Upper Deck's \\"VS System\\". True Heroes operated at Gen Con Indy and So Cal in 2004 and 2005 before being cancelled. ==NotesReferences== * * Article is also online: * Features a good description of the 2005 True Dungeon experience. * * ==External links== *True Dungeon web site Category:Live-action role-playing games ","title":"True Adventures"},{"id":"19242440","text":"The Darkon Wargaming Club is a non-profit battle gaming and live-action role- playing (LARP) club in the United States based in the Baltimore/Washington/Virginia area. Founded in 1985 and built upon the rules of the now-defunct Emarthnguarth Outdoor Wargaming System,The Darkon Wargaming Club Official Rulebook, page 1. Darkon grew from a handful of LARP enthusiasts to almost 2,000 members in 2005, with a small number of chapters dotting the country. Darkon is notable for its age and media coverage. The club was featured on two Fox News broadcasts and in a CNN story by Oliver Janney. On June 3, 2009, a segment featuring several members of the Club was featured on National Public Radio. There is also an award-winning feature-length documentary based on the club, Darkon. Administration of The Darkon Wargaming Club is composed of three official governing bodies: the \\"Executive Board,\\" the \\"Noble Council,\\" and the \\"Senate.\\" The Club administration is run much like the United States Government, with a system of checks and balances to prevent one body from gaining too much power.The Darkon Wargaming Club Official Rulebook, page 14. The group has various tie-ins with local park services and other public-grounds administrative bodies, meaning they often have opportunities to set up their events in public parks and nature preserves as well as through personal arrangements with private farmers, landowners, and high school and college grounds. \\"Meatgrinder\\" battle in Darkon ==Club administrationExecutive Board=== The Executive Board of Darkon handles the day-to-day administration of the Club, such as finances, registration, records, and contact with other LARPs. Members of this governing body are the official representatives of the Darkon Wargaming Club. The Board is composed of: *the President, who acts as chief representative of the Club when dealing with outside officials, and makes final interpretations of Club Rules, *the Vice-President, who chairs the Noble Council, serves as chief liaison with other LARP clubs and stands in as chief executive in the President's absence, *the Secretary, who maintains the Club Roster and official records, *the Treasurer, who is the chief financial officer of the club and maintains the club finances and ensures payment of accounts payable, and *the Magistrate, who chairs the Senate, maintains the Club's safety Marshals, and makes final interpretations of Club Bylaws. All Executive Board members are elected annually by the Senate.The Darkon Wargaming Club Official Rulebook, pp. 220-224. ===Senate=== The Senate of Darkon is made up of one or two representatives from each country (team) in Darkon. Duties of the Senate consist of introducing and voting on new rules and bylaws, electing Executive Board members, and making specific Club decisions. Additionally, the Senate may overrule any official decision made by the Executive Board. ===Noble Council=== The Noble Council is a governing body consisting of Club members who have earned the title of \\"Knight of the Realm\\" through Club service and high esteem of the Club members. It is this council's task to ensure that safety policies and practices are being performed by Club members at all times, and to discipline those who violate such policies. Individual Knights are held to a higher standard and expected to maintain conduct becoming of their rank at all times. Knights are expected to serve as Elders (referees) and safety Marshals periodically throughout the year. Any Knight may challenge the Noble Council in a contest of arms in order to gain a higher title (such as Baron, Earl, Marquis, Count, Duke or Prince) and the right to play the class Cavalier. They may also go up in higher rank via promotion from the High King or the Noble Council. Those who wish to gain nobility must submit a petition to the Noble Council. Based upon that player's merit, the Council may then accept or deny the applicant. However, Nobles approved by the Noble Council may be decommissioned by the Senate if seen unfit. Additionally, the Noble Council may bestow the title of \\"Knight Errant\\" on any Club member. Knights Errant are Nobles in title and must be regarded as such, but they do not have voting rights on the Noble Council.The Darkon Wargaming Club Official Rulebook, pp. 225-226. ==GameplayCountries and retinues=== Darkon is made up of a number of teams, or \\"countries\\". A country is a group of players, usually friends, who have all pledged allegiance to the same leader, agreed to wear the same country symbol, and fight for the same goals. Country rosters are fairly static; players may drift from one country to another, but for the most part, membership in a country is very personal and moving is generally an important decision (as it is in real life). All countries in Darkon have some type of recorded history. The history may be the actual history of a Medieval or ancient nation (such as Sparta) or may consist of pure fiction. Most countries select a fictional background as it is generally easier to roleplay. Countries also exist on a map kept by the administration of Darkon. Land \\"hexes\\" may be discovered and claimed, wars (both land and naval) may be fought, and cities, ships, and other structures may be built. The amount of land a country owns has a direct impact on how much in-game money (represented by gold- and silver-colored metal coins minted by the Club administration) is earned.The Darkon Wargaming Club Official Rulebook, pp. 30-31. Presently there are sixteen officially recognized countries in Darkon. They are (from oldest to newest): Elidor, Aquilonia, The Bloody Axe Mercenary Company, Nurgle, Ched Nasad, The Northern Kingdoms, Legion Exsilium, Chosen Blood, Carcosa, Blackwatch, and Kindred. Other countries may unofficially exist in the realm, but until they petition for recognition by the Club administration they may not claim hexes on — or earn money from — the map, nor engage in a land war. Nomads are players who have no allegiance to any country. They generally are hired out (i.e. become mercenaries) by a country during an event.The Darkon Wargaming Club Official Rulebook, page 33. Darkon also allows another form of unit, a Knight's Retinue. A person that has attained the title of Knight in the realm of Darkon may wear their own personal symbol on their tabard and manage their own personal army. The retinue members would all wear the same symbol as the Knight they serve under. Members of a retinue can sign in as any country and be members of any country. Currently there are two officially recognized knights retinue in Darkon: House Dubh (rendered to Duke Bendore Dubh), and the Temple of Athena (rendered to Lord Absolom). ===Weapons=== Darkon is full-contact padded weapons sport and therefore must be guaranteed safe for the players. Individual members of the club are trusted to build his or her own weapons in a manner consistent with the Club rules. The large selection of legal weapons available to players are one-handed swords, Two- handed swords, hand axes, battle axes, hammers, clubs, maces, spears, daggers, chained flails, quarterstaves, glaives, and halberds. Bows, crossbows, and specially-built javelins also may be used. At the simplest level, Darkon melee weapons are composed of a firm core with several layers of hard- and soft-cell foam taped or glued to it. Cloth must also cover the blade and pommel of every weapon. As of 2012, the Club has decided to include weapons covered in a soft rubberized coat as an alternative to cloth. Cores are made using various lightweight-yet-sturdy materials. Common cores are PVC pipe and the more expensive fiberglass. Wood and bamboo cores may only be used for spears. Metal cores are not to be used except with express permission from the Club administration. Darkon players also use different varieties of foam for their weapons ranging from simple camping mats to high-end industrial foams. Adhesives are also used to keep the foam and core together in one solid weapon; contact cement, double-sided tape, and duct tape are the most common for this purpose. Javelins are long tubes built using foam and adhesive, containing a ½\\" PVC or hollow fiberglass core. Arrows and crossbow bolts are built using an actual arrow or bolt with the head removed. The tip of the arrow shaft is then padded with foam and secured with tape. Siege engines are also in use in the game of Darkon for specialized battle campaigns. Siege weapons include ballistae, catapults, and trebuchets. While there are currently few specific rules governing the construction of a siege engine in Darkon, all siege engines must be built with the utmost degree of safety in mind. Ballista bolts are built much like javelins, while catapult/trebuchet stones are cloth balls filled with cotton fiber, known as \\"spellballs\\" (please see the Magic section of this article for more information about spellballs.)The Darkon Wargaming Club Official Rulebook, pp. 37-44. ===Armor and shields=== Armor and shields in Darkon afford a player special protections against physical and magic damage. Armor may either be built by the player or bought (provided they follow the official specifications and safety guidelines), and can range from a basic leather bracer or greave to full plate armor. In Darkon, leather armor must be at least 5-ounce genuine leather (Pleather is not acceptable) and metal armor be made of steel, brass, or bronze. Damage taken while wearing armor is determined by the type of weapon versus the class of armor worn. For example, chain mail (Armor Rating 2) worn on the torso would give the player one extra hit versus a \\"black weapon\\" (i.e., two-handed sword, halberd, \\"black\\" glaive, or battle axe), and the second hit would result in a mortal wound. Shields are ½\\" pieces of plywood (¼\\" for bucklers) wrapped in hard- and soft-cell foam and covered with cloth. Any weapon (save for the Arrow of Piercing relic) may be deflected by a shield and cause no damage as long as the weapon does not solidly strike the individual before or after contact with the shield. Shields may be destroyed by a halberd, certain-sized two-handed axes, or via the Mace of Disruption relic in three solid hits, or the Javelin of Lightning relic in one hit. Additionally, certain magic spells such as Warp Wood or Lightning Bolt destroy shields. Shields may block some spells (i.e. Word of Holding) but not others (i.e. Curse).The Darkon Wargaming Club Official Rulebook, pp. 44-49. ===Magic=== Like most fantasy role-playing games, Magic is used in Darkon as part of the fantasy spirit of the game. Magic takes place in the form of spells, written by the player, which must be read in order for the spell to be invoked. Spells may be offensive (i.e., Fireball), defensive (i.e., Cure Light Wounds), or utility (i.e., Hold Portal) in nature. Most spells that affect other characters utilize a \\"spellball,\\" which is a round cloth ball stuffed with cotton fiber. The color of the spellball determines the magic's effect. For example, a Mage could read the Lightning Bolt spell from his or her spellbook, then throw a blue spellball at his or her target. If the target is hit, he or she takes a specific amount of damage to the area of the body hit. Every spell is different and it is the player's responsibility to know the effect of every spell. Green damage spellballs are used specifically with siege engines in the game, and causes immediate \\"death\\" to any player directly hit by it. Those within a three-foot radius of the spellball's landing point are \\"mortally wounded,\\" which is to say he or she becomes incapacitated for 5 minutes and will \\"die\\" if not properly healed. The green spellsballs are also used in the Druid spell \\"Nature Love\\".The Darkon Wargaming Club Official Rulebook, pp. 99-161. ===Roleplaying=== Roleplaying, or \\"acting out one's character\\" is a prominent part of Darkon. Players may elect to roleplay a valiant nobleman, a cutthroat rogue, a chaotic abomination of some magic- twisted species, or anywhere in between. Additionally, all players choose a race for their character, be it relatively mundane (e.g., human), literary (e.g., elf, dwarf, sprite) or godlike in power (e.g., storm giant). Race may play a large part of a character's motivations in Darkon. For example, one who has chosen a Drow would usually roleplay as a member of an evil and treacherous race of elves whose sole ambition is money and status. There are no set rules for roleplaying. Darkon contains a large spectrum of players, from those who play entirely for the competition of the fight and do not engage in roleplay, to those who do not fight at all and spend the majority of their time in the game roleplaying their character. Furthermore, a player is in no way required to reveal his or her personal agenda or background to another player, though it is generally considered good form to truthfully respond when a player asks, \\"What [race] do I see?\\" Players may outright answer or simply give a short visual description of themselves. During \\"Adventure\\" events, plots are put into place in which the countries of Darkon work together (or against each other) to fulfill a quest, solve a puzzle, and/or defeat an enemy. Roleplaying is of particular importance at these events, as the overall \\"plot\\" of Darkon exists from one Adventure event to the next. Roleplaying still exists in \\"Battle\\" events (events where no plot is outlined; members simply fight), though to a much lesser degree. ==Culture== Members of the Darkon Wargaming Club come from all walks of life, yet a strong sense of camaraderie exists regardless of background, social status, or any other factor. One thread usually common to all members, though, is a hobby for gaming in general, whether it be video games, tabletop role-playing games, or others. Some players who meet in Darkon often end up becoming lifelong friends. Darkon has also been responsible for the occasional marriage or two. As with most other subcultures, Darkon utilizes a vocabulary of slang borne of all live-action roleplaying games. \\"Rhinohiding\\" (the act of \\"blowing off\\" one's hits; also known as \\"ego armor\\"), \\"powergaming\\" (splitting hairs in the rules in order to gain an advantage), and \\"metagaming\\" (using out-of-game knowledge in-game in an advantageous fashion) are a few examples. ==See also== * Battle gaming * Amtgard * Belegarth Medieval Combat Society * Boffer * Society for Creative Anachronism * Dagorhir * Darkon, the documentary based on The Darkon Wargaming Club ==ReferencesNotes * Official website * Darkon the Movie: Documentary based on The Darkon Wargaming Club Category:Live-action battle gaming Category:Live-action role-playing games Category:Organizations established in 1985 Category:1985 establishments in the United States ","title":"Darkon Wargaming Club"},{"id":"19242441","text":"Piero (or Pietro) Strozzi (1550 - after 1 September 1609) was an Italian nobleman and amateur composer.

Cotton textile production and apparel manufacturing are Pakistan's largest industries, accounting for about 65% of the merchandise exports and almost 40% of the employed labour force.http://www- wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2006/05/23/000012009_20060523095241/Rendered/PDF/354991PK0rev0pdf.pdf Cotton and cotton-based products account for 61% of export earnings of Pakistan. The consumption of cotton increased by 5.7% over the past five years while the economic growth rate was 7%. By 2010 the spinning capacity increased to 15 million spindles and textile exports hit $15.5 billion. Other major industries include cement, fertilizer, edible oil, sugar, steel, tobacco, chemicals, machinery and food processing. The government is privatizing large- scale parastatal units, and the public sector accounts for a shrinking proportion of industrial output, while growth in overall industrial output (including the private sector) has accelerated. Government policies aim to diversify the country's industrial base and bolster export industries. ==Mining and quarrying== The country has immense reserves of various minerals and natural resources. Important minerals found in Pakistan are gypsum, limestone, chromites, iron ore, rock salt, silver, gold, precious stones, gems, marble, copper, coal, graphite, sulphur, fire clay, silica. The salt range in Punjab Province has one of the largest deposit of pure salt founded in the world. Balochistan province is a mineral-rich area having substantial mineral, oil and gas reserves which have not been exploited to their full capacity or fully explored, recent government policies have begun to develop this region of the country and to tap into the immense resources found there. The province has significant quantities of copper, chromite and iron, and pockets of antimony and zinc in the south and gold in the far west. Natural gas was discovered near Sui in 1952, and the province has been gradually developing its oil and gas projects over the past fifty years. Major reserves of copper and gold in Balochistan's Reko Diq area have been discovered in early 2006. The Reko Diq mining area has proven estimated reserves of 2 billion tons of copper and 20 million ounces of gold. According to the current market price, the value of the deposits has been estimated at about $65 billion, which would generate thousands of jobs. The discovery has ranked Rekodiq among the world's top seven copper reserves. The Rekodiq project is estimated to produce 200,000 tons of copper and 400,000 ounces of gold per year, at an estimated value of $1.25 billion at current market prices. The copper and gold are currently traded at about $5,000 per ton and $600 per ounce respectively in the international market.http://www.pakpositive.com/common/clicks/out2.php?pakpositive=%3A%2F%2Fwww.dawn.com%2F2006%2F04%2F14%2Ftop8.htm Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province accounts for at least 78% of the marble production in Pakistan. Pakistan is home to some of the most finest and purest grades of marble, granite and slate found in the world. Much of the grades A Marble that is exported out of European countries like Italy actually have their origins in Pakistan which previously lacked fine polishing and processing machinery. The Government has taken steps to invest in this crucial sector with the recent establishment of a Marble City within Balochistan.69 The Federal Bureau of Statistics provisionally valued this sector at Rs.211,851 million in 2005 thus registering over 99% growth since 2000.https://web.archive.org/web/20070619224443/http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/fbs/statistics/national_accounts/table4.pdf ==Fuel extraction industry== Pakistan's first oil field was discovered in the late 1952 in Balochistan near a giant gas field at suo Sui in Balochistan. The Toot oilfield was discovered in the early 1960s Islamabad in the Punjab. Production has steadily increased since then. Pakistan's first gas field was the giant gas field at Sui in Balochistan which was discovered in the late 1952. https://archive.today/20070528143233/http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/divisions/ContentInfo.jsp?DivID=49&cPath;=768_867&ContentID;=5217 Pakistan is also a major producer of Bituminous coal, Sub-bituminous coal and Lignite. Coal mining started in the British colonial era and has continued to be used by Pakistani industries after independence in 1947. Pakistan produced about 45 tonnes of Uranium in 2006. ==Manufacturing== In FY 2002–03, real growth in manufacturing was 7.7%. In the twelve months ending 30 June 2004, large-scale manufacturing grew by more than 18% compared to the previous twelve-month period. The textile and garment industry's share in the economy along with its contribution to exports, employment, foreign-exchange earnings, investment and value added make it Pakistan's single largest manufacturing sector. The industry comprises 453 textile mills: 50 integrated units; and 403 spinning units, with 9.33 million spindles and 148,000 rotors, The capacity utilization was 83% for spindles and 47% for rotors during 2003. The Federal Bureau of Statistics provisionally valued large-scale manufacturing at Rs.981,518 million in 2005 thus registering over 138% growth since 2000 while small-scale manufacturing was valued at Rs.356,835 million in 2005 thus registering over 80% growth since 2000. ==Automotive Industry== Pakistan's automotive industry is the one of the fastest growing industries of the country, accounting for 4% of Pakistan's GDP and employing a workforce of over 1,800,000 people. Currently there are over 3200 automotive manufacturing plants in the country, with an investment of producing 1.8 million motorcycles and 200,000 vehicles annually. Its contribution to the national exchequer is nearly . The sector, as a whole, provides employment to 3.5 million people and plays a pivotal role in promoting the growth of the vendor industry. Pakistan's auto market is considered among the smallest, but fastest growing in South Asia. Over 180,000 cars were sold in the fiscal year 2014–15, rising to 206,777 units fiscal year 2015–16. this is an old data, please verify before publish ==Technology== Pakistan has huge potential for the technology industry, which includes software development and electronics manufacturing. Pakistan Aeronautical Complex recently started the manufacturing of Tablet PCs, Ebook readers, and notebooks in collaboration with INNAVTEK of China. Software development also has a huge potential, which is being utilized as a result of numerous projects initiated by the Government of Pakistan. ==Construction== Modern high-rises under construction at Clifton Beach, Karachi, Pakistan. Clifton area is fast becoming residential and commercial hub of Karachi. After the devastating 2005 Kashmir earthquake Pakistan has instituted stricter building codes. The cost of construction in Pakistan will increase 30 to 50% due to implementation of a new building code which requires strengthening of structures to withstand earthquake of 8 to 8.5 magnitude. The demand for cement has increased due to reconstruction after the earthquake. The price of cement has increased by 50% and Pakistan government banned export of cement to lower the prices and the reconstruction costs. Dubai Ports World, announced on June 1, 2006 that it will spend $10 billion to develop transport infrastructure and real estate in Pakistan. Dubai Ports World is also discussing the possibility of the company taking over operational management of Gwadar port in Balochistan. Emaar Properties, announced on May 31, 2006 three real estate developments in the cities of Islamabad and Karachi in Pakistan. The projects, with a total investment of $2.4 billion, will include a series of master planned communities that will set new benchmarks in commercial, residential and retail property within Pakistan. In addition the conglomerate signed an unprecedented $43 billion deal to develop two island resorts - Bundal Island and Buddo Island - over the next decade. The Federal Bureau of Statistics provisionally valued this sector at Rs.178,819 million in 2005 thus registering over 88% growth since 2000. ==Electricity, gas and water supply== Pakistan has extensive energy resources, including fairly sizable natural gas reserves, some proven oil reserves, coal (Pakistan has the largest coal reserves in the worldCoal, Granite, China Clay and other Resources of Thar , Geological Survey of Pakistan, URL accessed on April 2, 2006), and a large hydropower potential. However, the exploitation of energy resources has been slow due to a shortage of capital and domestic political constraints. Domestic petroleum production totals only about half the country's oil needs, and the need to import oil has contributed to Pakistan's trade deficits and past shortages of foreign exchange. The current government has announced that privatization in the oil and gas sector is a priority, as is the substitution of indigenous gas for imported oil, especially in the production of power. Pakistan is a world leader in the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) for personal automobiles. The short-term national energy demand has expanded significantly since 2001 due to massive rise in sales of durable goods like refrigerators, washing machines, split air conditioners, et al..http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/5338402.stm In 2004, Access Group International announced plans to invest $1 billion over the next 5 years in solar cell manufacture and wind farms.

The Canadian conglomerate Cathy Oil and Gas signed a memorandum of understanding in late 2006 to invest $5 billion in oil and gas exploration, development, production and commercialisation in Pakistan. The World Bank estimates that it takes about 32 days only to get an electrical connection in Pakistan.

He was born in Breslau, Silesia and was known for never having been arrested. ==Biography== In 1968, nobody knew who Silber’s parents were, how old he was nor where was he born. However, when he was conscripted into the British Army in 1915, he announced that he \\"was about thirty years old”. This meant his birth date was around 1870. As a teenager, he left Germany for South Africa, where he learnt English, Afrikaans and Zulu. ==War== During the Second Anglo-Boer War, the British used his services as an interpreter and an agent in the censor. About 1,500 prisoners of war were sent to Ceylon and India and Silber went there with them as an agent of censor for 18 months. He served as a city-garrison of Abbottabad near the Afghan border. Repatriation of prisoners began after the Treaty of Vereeniging and Silber returned to South Africa, where he resided for 2 years. He later emigrated to the United States, where he lived for a few years, however he couldn't find a job because of his qualifications. When war between the United Kingdom and Germany was declared in 1914 Silber had patriotism. Thinking of the best way to help his country, he travelled to the United Kingdom, where he offered his services to the post office as a censor. In this position, he was able to obtain information useful to the German war effort. While in New York City, he gave his letter-box's address to the German ambassador. Not holding a passport to go to London, he travelled through Canada. Security in Canada was more lax because Canadians were considered British citizens. Silber carried official British documents that showed his service in South Africa and India, none of which mentioned his nationality. He spent some time in Montreal while trying to pass as a French Canadian to disguise from the British. He set sail for England on September 19, 1914, arriving 10 days later without a passport, and was interrogated in Manchester. Eventually, he was permitted to enter the United Kingdom and travelled to London later that evening. Although he had yet to commit any acts of espionage, he had already carried out an exploit, because he was a German who had managed to get into the United Kingdom during the war. Obstructing MI5 investigations, he obtained a position at the censor's office after an interview by a colonel who had already served in the Punjab region. They discovered several common interests, and Silber began his work as a censor on October 12, 1914. Using mailed window envelopes that had already been stamped and cleared he was able to forward microfilm to Germany that contained increasingly important information. Silber was regularly promoted and ended up in the position of chief censor, which enabled him to analyze all suspect documents. Once the war ended, Silber had to wait until 1925 for restrictions on voyages to the continent to be reduced so that he could return to Germany. ==Autobiography== He spent his days in Germany after having written an autobiographical account of his life entitled The Invisible Weapons, in 1932. Based on this autobiography, the author Ronald Seth wrote The Spy Who Wasn't Caught, a book recounting the exploits of this master of espionage who was probably forgotten because he was the most intelligent of all the spies. The French version of this book, published in 1968, was titled Le Plus Anglais des espions allemands (The Most English of German Spies). ==Works== * The Invisible Weapons, Hutchinson, 1932, Londres, D639S8S5. * Die Anderen Waffen : Mit Zwei Faksimilies, Korn, Breslau, Germany, 1932.

He is best known for his collaborations with Willoughby J. Edbrooke, especially the 1889 Georgia State Capitol. Burnham was also named the Kenilworth Company Architect for Kenilworth, Illinois, and thus designed several of the planned community's original structures. After 1903, Burnham focused his works on California, including a series of twelve Carnegie libraries. Five of his buildings are today recognized by the National Park Service on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Georgia State Capitol, a National Historic Landmark. ==Biography== Franklin Pierce Burnham was born in Rockford, Illinois, on October 30, 1853, to Paul and Sarah J. Burnham. Burnham is of no relation to fellow Chicago architect Daniel Burnham. He was the youngest of their five children, and the only one born in Illinois. Paul Burnham was a carpenter, which probably influenced Franklin's future profession. Franklin Burnham was educated at Old Moseley School in Chicago before working in the architectural offices of J. H. Barrows when he was fourteen. On January 29, 1877, Burnham married Adelia S. Milliken. After the marriage, the couple would move to San Francisco, where Burnham planned to open a new practice. One of his commissions, with Chicago architect Willoughby J. Edbrooke, was for the Wesley Avenue School at the University of Notre Dame in 1879. Burnham's first son, John Paul, was born in 1883. The Georgia State Capitol, perhaps Burnham's most notable commission At some point around 1887, the Burnhams returned to Chicago. He established a working relationship with Edbrooke in the Chamber of Commerce Building. Burnham was the chief designer while Edbrooke oversaw general management. They designed residences in Evanston, Chicago, and Kansas City. They were also commissioned by YMCA to design a building in Atlanta for $100,000. It was in Atlanta that Edbrooke & Burnham would receive their most notable commission a few years later—the Georgia State Capitol. A national competition was held for the building, which had to only use materials from Georgia. The Renaissance and Classical Revival design submitted by Edbrooke & Burnham was announced as the winner, and the cornerstone was dedicated on September 2, 1885. The building would be completed in June 1889 for $998,157, in line with the $1 million budget. In 1974, the Georgia State Capitol would become the forty-third National Historic Landmark in the state. Edbrooke & Burnham's 7th District Police Station, built in Chicago in 1888, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1996. The O'Grady House, one of Burnham's buildings in Kenilworth Burnham was independently appointed the Kenilworth Company Architect in 1889. Kenilworth, Illinois was a planned community by Joseph Sears, who sought to develop a Chicago suburb with large lots and high standards of construction. He designed several residences, a train station, and a church for the town. The Mr. J. William de Coursey O'Grady House at 149 Kenilworth Avenue would be listed on the NRHP in 2008. Burnham himself lived in one of his Kenilworth houses at 37 Kenilworth Avenue. The Oxnard Carnegie library Burnham drawing for Christian Science church in Pasadena, 1908 Burnham assumed all responsibility for the practice after Edbrooke was appointed Supervising Architect of the Treasury in 1891. In 1892, the firm designed the Kane County Courthouse in Geneva, Illinois. One of the pair's last major commissions was for the Mecca Flats in Chicago. The apartment building held almost five hundred residents, and was designed in an unusual U-shape that allowed for a central courtyard. This courtyard design would become the template for Chicago apartment design over the next few decades. Burnham contributed the Cold Storage Warehouse for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. The partnership officially ended upon the death of Edbrooke in 1896. Burnham returned to California in 1898 to again open an independent practice. Back in California, Burnham focused his practice on designing Carnegie libraries. He designed twelve libraries: nine on his own, and three as part of the firm of Burnham & Bliesner. Only three are still standing, two of which are recognized by the NRHP. The library in Oxnard, now the Carnegie Art Museum, was listed in 1971. The Carnegie Public Library Building in Colton was listed in 1988. Burnham was also commissioned to design the Riverside County Courthouse in Riverside in 1903. He designed San Diego's first skyscraper, the twelve-story First National Bank of San Diego, in 1909. One of his last commissions was the First Church of Christ, Scientist in Pasadena. Franklin Pierce Burnham died suddenly in California on December 16, 1909, while visiting a bank. At the time, he resided at 1945 La France Street in South Pasadena. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * \\"Feeling Sad, Has Sad End: Architect Burnham Expires Suddenly in Bank,\\" Los Angeles Times, December 17, 1909, page II-7 Category:1853 births Category:1909 deaths Category:19th-century American architects Category:Architects from Illinois Category:People from Rockford, Illinois Category:People from Kenilworth, Illinois Category:Architects of YMCA buildings ","title":"Franklin Pierce Burnham"},{"id":"19242561","text":"is a Japanese tarento and gravure idol who is a former member of the idol group AKB48 under Team A.

There are around 42 independent power producers (IPPs) that contribute significantly in electricity generation in Pakistan. ==History== Pakistan electricity sector is a developing market. For years, the matter of balancing the country's supply against the demand for electricity had remained a largely unresolved matter. The country faced significant challenges in revamping its network responsible for the supply of electricity. Electricity generators were seeking a parity in returns for both domestic and foreign investors indicating it to be one of the key issues in overseeing a surge in electricity generation when the country was facing growing shortages. Other problems included lack of efficiency, rising demands for energy, and political instability.http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content- library/dawn/news/pakistan/16-loadshedding-to-end-by-next-summer-us-hs-06 Provincial and federal agencies, who are the largest consumers, often do not pay their bills.Power Politics:Pakistan's energy crisis The Economist, 21 May 2012 At one point electricity generation had shrunk by up to 50% due to an over-reliance on fossil fuels. The country was hit by its worst power crisis in 2007 when production fell by 6000 Megawatts and massive blackouts followed suit. Load Shedding and power blackouts had become severe in Pakistan before 2016. Economic Survey 2019-20 unfolds that Pakistan's installed capacity to generate electricity has surged up to 37,402 MW by June 2020 which stood at 22,812 MW in June 2013, showing the growth of 64 percent.https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/309535-country-s-installed- electricity-capacity-increases-by-30pc-to-29-573mw ==Installed capacity== According to the Pakistan Economic Survey 2019-20, the installed electricity generation capacity reached 37,402 MW in 2020. The maximum total demand coming from residential and industrial estates stands at nearly 25,000 MW, whereas the transmission and distribution capacity is stalled at approximately 22,000 MW. This leads to a deficit of about 3,000 MW when the demand peaks. This additional 3,000 MW required cannot be transmitted even though the peak demand of the country is well below its installed capacity of 37,402 MW. == Electricity Concerns == Although Pakistan has reduced blackouts and increased electricity production significantly, blackouts are still common, and Indices (Base Year 2007-08) Pakistan Bureau of Statisticswebsite=www.pbs.gov.pkaccess-date=2020-01-15}} Recent tariff have contributed to this increase in prices. ==Electricity generation == *Electricity – generation: 148.25 GWh (2019) *Electricity – generation by source (2019) **Furnace oil: 14% of total **Natural gas: 31% of total **Coal: 16% of total **Hydroelectric: 29% of total **Nuclear: 4% of total **Renewable (solar & wind): 5% of total ** Others (Bagasse, Waste Heat Recovery etc.): 1% of total ==Electricity consumption== *Electricity – consumption: 90.36 GWh (2015-2016) *Electricity – exports: 6.01% (2015-2016) *Electricity – imports: .49% (2015-2016) *Electricity Consumption per Capita = 529 kWh/Capita on PEPCO and 892 on KE system as per \\"State of Industry Report 2019 by NEPRA\\" ==Governance and sector reform== Recent reforms include the unbundling and corporatization of the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) into 10 regional distribution companies, 4 government-owned thermal power generation companies and a transmission company, the National Transmission and Despatch Company. The hydropower plants were retained by WAPDA as WAPDA Hydroelectric. All are fully owned by the government. K-Electric Limited (formally known as Karachi Electric Supply Company), which is responsible for power generation and distribution in the Karachi area, is listed on the stock exchanges and is privately owned. Privately owned independent power producers generated 53% of the country's power in FY2016.Asian Development Bank (2016), Access to Clean Energy Investment Program, Energy Sector Summary, p.2 ==Effects of natural and man-made disasters== During 2010 Pakistan floods and 2005 Kashmir earthquake power stations, power distribution and transmission and other energy infrastructures were damaged. During the floods and rainfalls the recently constructed Jinnah hydroelectric power plant was flooded in addition to severe damages to transmission and distribution network and installations while several power plants and refineries were threatened by rising waters and had to be shut down. Natural gas field output had to be reduced as the flood waters approached the wells. There has also been some concern by Pakistani nuclear activists over the effect of natural disasters on nuclear plants specially over the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant, since the plant lies over a geological fault.http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content- library/dawn/news/pakistan/12-pakistan+floods+threaten+power+plants--bi-07 Due to over reliance of Pakistan on dams for electricity generation, some environmental impacts of dams such as submergence of usable/ecological land and their negative impact on Pakistan's mangrove forests due to loss of river silt load, as well as increased risk of severe floods have become evident. ==See also== * List of power stations in Pakistan * List of electric supply companies in Pakistan * Water and Power Development Authority * Economy of Pakistan * Private Power and Infrastructure Board * Pakistan Electric Power Company * Alternative Energy Development Board * National Electric Power Regulatory Authority * Karachi Electric Supply Company * Pakistan national energy policy * Rolling blackout *Deg outfall hydropower project Sheikhupura ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Robert M.

In 1888 he joined the staff of the Academy of Music and Dramatic Art as accompanist and coach, and in 1893 was appointed piano teacher and coach at the reorganized Academy of Music. His first string quartet was awarded the Milleniumi Király-dij (Millennial King’s Prize) in 1896.

In 1927 he was appointed principal of the National Conservatory, in which position he remained until his death in Budapest. Szabados’s music, at once poetic and restrained, is essentially conservative in character; his language never advanced beyond that of the late Romantics. He was principally known as a composer for the theatre and also as a singing teacher: his pedagogical works were in official use by the academy. He composed two operas, Maria (1905), Fanny (1927). ==Sources== *John S. Weissmann/Péter P. Várnai.

He created the dingulator, guitar sculptures made out of American cars, and performed at several music festivals in the United States and Europe. He made two albums and published 12 books. ==Biography== Charles Martin Simon was schooled at the Montclair Academy for Boys (later the Montclair Kimberley Academy) in Montclair, New Jersey. After graduating in 1959, Simon went to Rutgers University in New Jersey where he majored in Agriculture and English literature. But after two years at university he grew unhappy with the courses and dropped out. After the death of his artist wife in 1965, Simon was \\"reduced to nothing\\" which produced a \\"psyche fragmentation\\" he called Charlie Nothing the Artist. As Charlie Nothing, he pursued music and the visual arts. He created guitar sculptures made out of American cars he called dingulators and formed a number of \\"dingulation\\" bands in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. In the mid-1960s in New York City Nothing formed his first band which included himself on sopranino saxophone, a classically trained Indian tabla player and a female Japanese vocalist. Then came The First Uniphrenic Church and Bank Band, a group which played at The Village Gate and is said to have included \\"a young, pre-Blondie Debbie Harry.\\" Nothing moved to Los Angeles in 1966 where he performed in a show with Frank Zappa and briefly joined the cast of the musical Hair. He then moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he recorded his first album for John Fahey's Takoma Records, The Psychedelic Saxophone of Charlie Nothing. It featured a sequence of saxophone improvisations by Nothing accompanied by gong, conga and a banjo ukulele. Nothing also did the album cover artwork. The album did not sell well in the United States, but achieved minor cult status in Europe in free improvised music circles. In 1967 Nothing moved to Santa Cruz, California where he joined an organic farming movement and for the next ten years, worked a farm entirely by hand. He continued his musical performances until 1984, during which time he also recorded several songs, including \\"Steal-A-Meal\\", \\"Fuck You and Your Stupid Wars\\", \\"Eatin' Ain't Cheatin\\" and \\"A Pizza and a Piece of Ass\\". In the mid-1970s he formed The Superfabulous Dingulators, a band consisting of Charlie Nothing (dingulator), Patrick Bisconti (dingulator), John Kertisz (bamboo flute) and Jesse Ward Jr. (percussion). Between 1984 and 2005, Nothing stopped performing and focused on his other activities, which included beekeeping and writing. Under the name Charles Martin Simon he set up his own Stinging Insect Removal business, and published over a dozen fiction and non-fiction books, each handmade and self-published. His non-fiction included books on health and nutrition, and his accounts of the psychedelic 1960s. In 2004 Nothing resumed performing in public again. He started playing at small venues in the Santa Cruz area, but soon began receiving invitations to play at music festivals. He gave a dingulation performance in 2005 at the Two Million Tongues Festival in Chicago, and in 2006 at the Pauze Festival in Ghent, Belgium with Swedish musician Jakob Olausson. In 2007 he released a new CD of dingulator songs entitled My Cuntree Tits of Me, a play on the phrase \\"my country, 'tis of thee\\". Charlie Nothing died of cancer at the age of 66 on October 23, 2007 at his home in Soquel, California. An anthology album, 40 Years of the Ding : A Charlie Nothing Anthology comprising all his previously recorded LPs and singles, plus privately released cassette recordings was scheduled to be released by De Stijl Records towards the end of 2008. Charlie Nothing characterized himself as a \\"Philosopher/Clown\\" who, according to his official biography, \\"Was not born. Did not die. Does not, did not, will not exist.\\" ==Dingulator== A collection of dingulators created by Charlie Nothing. Dingulators are guitar sculptures made out of recycled automotive steel. They are a class of musical instrument invented by Charlie Nothing and each construction is unique with its own sound. Dingulators are steel-string acoustic guitars having typically seven or eight and sometimes up to 21 strings. They have friction pegs and raised frets like those on a sitar. Tuning a dingulator is \\"variable, organic and evolving.\\" According to Nothing, \\"the ideal would be to never tune them, to just find where they are going and go with it ... but sometimes I do make adjustments.\\" Nothing, a skilled artisan and welder, used old cars as his material because \\"cars have the right kind of steel ... [they've] got very soulful steel.\\" Nothing was also making a political statement with his artistic recycling. \\"It's a sword-to-plowshare kind of thing,\\" he said. \\"Cars to guitars.\\" When Nothing began touring, he found taking his big and bulky dingulators aboard aircraft problematic. To overcome these difficulties he developed a smaller portable version with a detachable neck that could be stored in the body, making a compact steel carrying case he could take on airlines. Folk singer-songwriter Josephine Foster, who featured on the same bill as Nothing at the Two Million Tongues Festival in Chicago in 2005, described dingulators as \\"folk-art masterpieces\\". She said they sound like \\"tuned percussion [that] animate and punctuate [Nothing's] spoken-word diatribes.\\" They are also reminiscent of Hans Reichel's pre-daxophone modified-guitar recordings, and of Derek Bailey's improvised music, although Nothing was unfamiliar with both these musicians. Nothing described his musical influences as \\"everything ... probably as much by the stuff I don't like as the stuff I like.\\" A photograph of one of Nothing's dingulators appears as the back cover art of Hearts and Minds, Musical Instrument Makers of America by editors Nancy Ellis and Robert Bailey, and photographer Jake Jacobson. A dingulator is also the cover art on \\"The Western Region\\" section of the book. ==DiscographyAlbums=== *The Psychedelic Saxophone of Charlie Nothing (1967, LP, Takoma Records) *My Cuntree Tits of Me (2007, CD, Self-published) *40 Years of the Ding : A Charlie Nothing Anthology (2008, CD, De Stijl Records) *Charlie Nothing & Dingulator reissue (2010, cassette, De Stijl Records) ===Singles=== *Charlie Nothing Dingulator Band: \\"Ain't No Fascist\\"/\\"Dingulation No. 1\\" (1980, 7\\", Beyond Omega) ===Appears on=== *Various artists: So Much Fire to Roast Human Flesh (2006, CD, Bastet) – one track by Charlie Nothing, \\"Fuck You and Your Stupid Wars\\" *Various artists: Teenage Meadows of Infinity (Rare Psychs & Stomps) / From the Ashes Perfect Attainment Shall Be (Modern Freaked Sounds) (2007, 2xCD, Drag City) – one track by Charlie Nothing, \\"Steal-A-Meal\\" ==Bibliography (as Charles Martin Simon)== All Simon's book are handmade and self-published. ===Non fiction=== *Goodnight Cambodia: Forbidden History (1997, ) *Speeding Through Satori (1997, ) *Life and Crimes: Charlie Nothing (2000, ) *Health Enlightenment.com (2002, ) ===Fiction=== *Starworms: The Santa Cruz Savior Project (1997, ) *The Real Mickey Mouse (1997, ) *DragonSlime (1997, ) *AmericaCar: A Novel (1998, ) *Editor Murders Unmystery (1998, ) *The Money (1998, ) *The Collection (1998, ) *Adventures of Dickless Traci (2001, ) ==References== * ==External links== *. *A Brief History of Nothing: Charlie Nothing and His Dingulator.

Water from the reservoir first flowed into the Portland water system on January 2, 1895. President Theodore Roosevelt restricted entry to all but government agents and water company employees and banned stock grazing on April 28, 1904. In 1915 a new timber and rock fill dam raised the lake level about . At least two series of efforts were made between 1917 and 1925 to decrease lake seepage.

She began her career with the King's Company, which was under the management of Thomas Killigrew. She made her debut in the title role of Jonson's Epicene on 1 June 1664. Before this, she had been cast as Lucetta in Killigrew's 1664 planned production of his Thomaso, with an all-female cast, but this had been cancelled before completion. Knep played major and minor roles in a range of productions of the 1660s and 1670s, including: * the Widow in Beaumont and Fletcher's The Scornful Lady, 1666 * Guiomar in Fletcher and Massinger's The Custom of the Country, 1667 * Alibech in Dryden's The Indian Emperour, the 1667 revival * Asteria in Dryden's The Maiden Queen, 1667 * Beatrix in Dryden's An Evening's Love, 1668 * Aminta in Fletcher and Massinger's The Sea Voyage, 1668 * Nakar and Felicia in Dryden's Tyrannick Love, 1669 * Ladt Flippant in Wycherly's Love in a Wood, 1671 * Hyppolita in Dryden's The Assignation, 1672 * Lady Fidget in Wycherly's The Country Wife, 1675 * Eliza in Wycherly's The Plain Dealer, 1676 * Mrs. Dorothy in d'Urfey's Trick for Trick, 1678 -- her last known role. In addition to playing these and other parts, Knep also sang and danced in plays and spoke Prologues and Epilogues. She never achieved the same fame as her younger contemporary Nell Gwyn; in 1672 Knep secured the lead female role in The Assignation, but the play was a flop. == Personal life == Knep was reportedly \\"the wife of a Smithfield horsedealer, and the mistress of Pepys\\" -- or at least (according to Cunningham) \\"she granted him a share of her favours\\".Peter Cunningham, The Story of Nell Gwyn, Gordon Goodwin, ed., Edinburgh, John Grant, 1908; pp. 12, 171. Scholars disagree on the full extent of the Pepys/Knep relationship; but much of what we know about Knep comes from Samuel Pepys' famous private diary. Pepys first met Knep on 6 December 1665; he described her as \\"pretty enough, but the most excellent, mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest that I ever heard in my life.\\" He called her husband \\"an ill, melancholy, jealous-looking fellow\\"Pepys' Diary entry of 8 December 1665. and suspected him of abusing her. Knep provided Pepys with backstage access, and was a conduit for theatrical and social gossip. When they wrote notes to each other, Pepys signed himself \\"Dapper Dickey,\\" while Knep was \\"Barbary Allen\\" (a popular song that was an item in her musical repertory). She may have been a mistress of Sir Charles Sedley,John Downes, Roscius Anglicanus, London, 1708; Montague Summers, ed., London, Fortune Press [no date]; reprinted New York, Benjamin Blom, 1963; p. 93. and in the late 1670s she became the mistress of actor Joseph Haines. Knep had at least one child, a son born in June 1666.

Lewis (April 16, 1946 – January 21, 2015) was a Liberian lawyer and politician. A native of Sinoe County, Lewis was educated at the University of Liberia in Monrovia and at Yale Law School in the United States. He was the 18th Chief Justice of Liberia, serving from 2006 to 2012. Before his appointment to the Supreme Court, he served as a judge in Liberia's circuit court system. ==Early life== Johnnie N. Lewis was born to Roderick N. Lewis and Mary Houston-Lewis in Greenville, Sinoe County, Liberia on April 16, 1946.Cllr. Johnny Lewis For Chief Justice Of Liberia: New Gavel In A New Democracy - A Profile. Running Africa, February 19, 2006, The African Media Network. His father was a lawyer while his mother was a school teacher in a family with four boys and two girls. He earned an education at St. Joseph's Catholic Elementary School followed by Sinoe High School. For college he attended the University of Liberia in Monrovia where he earned a bachelor of arts degree, followed by a bachelor of laws degree from the university's Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law.The Inquirer. Liberia; Who is the New Chief Justice-Designate? Africa News, February 21, 2006. Graduating in 1969, he earned cum laude honors from the law school and was editor of the Liberian Law Journal. Lewis was admitted to the country's bar association that year before moving to the United States to continue his legal education. He graduated from Yale Law School in 1971 with a masters in law degree. ==Legal career== Lewis returned to Liberia where he was admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of Liberia in 1971 and began teaching at his former law school. In 1975, he was appointed to the Third Judicial Circuit Court in his home county by Liberian President William R. Tolbert, Jr., replacing his deceased father. In 1980, the government was overthrown and he left the judiciary. Lewis returned to the Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law in 1984 and served as dean of the school until 1991. That year he also assisted with the transitional government as legal adviser to the president of the interim government. In private practice in Monrovia, Lewis was once a partner in the Lewis & Lewis Law Offices. While living in that city his home was invaded by gunmen search for him, and though he escaped, a nephew was killed for failing to tell these men his uncle's whereabouts. Lewis then spent 1993 to 2003 outside of Liberia, working mainly with the United Nations. Employment with that agency led him to Bosnia and Somalia. He has also written two law textbooks, one on criminal law in Liberia and the other on wills and estates. In 2006, the Liberian Bar Association recommended Lewis be nominated by Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to serve as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Liberia. President Johnson-Sirleaf then nominated him in February and he was confirmed by the Liberian Senate on March 2, 2006. Lewis was commissioned as the new Chief Justice on March 3.The Analyst. \\"Liberia; Pres. Sirleaf Commissions Chief Justice, Associate\\", Africa News, March 3, 2006.

In a 3-2 decision with Lewis voting in the majority, the court declared the removal of House Speaker Edwin Snowe by the National Legislature was illegal and ordered his reinstatement.The Analyst. \\"Liberia; President Delivers Address Without Key Gov't Officials\\", Africa News, January 30, 2007.Borteh, George J. \\"Supreme Court Rules Against Majority Bloc\\", The Analyst Newspaper, January 30, 2007. The ruling in January 2007 also invalidated other actions of the legislature including a resolution to allow the Legislature to meet at the Unity Conference Center in Virginia while the Capitol Building in Monrovia was being remodeled. This decision created a rift between some members of the legislature, President Johnson-Sirleaf, and the Supreme Court.

In January 2008, the court affirmed the national government's decision not to hold municipal elections due to budgetary constraints and allowed the President of Liberia to appoint mayors.“Liberia Cannot Afford Local Polls”, The Analyst Newspaper, January 16, 2008. The court determined that once money was available, the government must hold the elections, which had not been held since 1985. He resigned from the court in September 2012 citing health issues, with September 10 as his last day in office. Lewis died in the United States in January 2015, while undergoing medical treatment. ==References *Official court biography Category:Chief Justices of Liberia Category:1946 births Category:University of Liberia alumni Category:Yale Law School alumni Category:People from Sinoe County Category:2015 deaths Category:Americo-Liberian people Category:People of Americo-Liberian descent ","title":"Johnnie Lewis"},{"id":"19242924","text":"There are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues with biofuel production and use, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating oil prices, the \\"food vs fuel\\" debate, poverty reduction potential, carbon emissions levels, sustainable biofuel production, deforestation and soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, effect on water resources, the possible modifications necessary to run the engine on biofuel, as well as energy balance and efficiency. The International Resource Panel, which provides independent scientific assessments and expert advice on a variety of resource-related themes, assessed the issues relating to biofuel use in its first report Towards sustainable production and use of resources: Assessing Biofuels.Towards sustainable production and use of resources: Assessing Biofuels , 2009, International Resource Panel, United Nations Environment Programme In it, it outlined the wider and interrelated factors that need to be considered when deciding on the relative merits of pursuing one biofuel over another. It concluded that not all biofuels perform equally in terms of their effect on climate, energy security and ecosystems, and suggested that environmental and social effects need to be assessed throughout the entire life-cycle. ==Social and economic effectsOil price moderation=== The International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2006 concludes that rising oil demand, if left unchecked, would accentuate the consuming countries' vulnerability to a severe supply disruption and resulting price shock. The report suggested that biofuels may one day offer a viable alternative, but also that \\"the implications of the use of biofuels for global security as well as for economic, environmental, and public health need to be further evaluated\\". According to Francisco Blanch, a commodity strategist for Merrill Lynch, crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive, if it were not for biofuels. Gordon Quaiattini, president of the Canadian Renewable Fuels Association, argued that a healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes. ===\\"Food vs. fuel\\" debate=== Food vs fuel is the debate regarding the risk of diverting farmland or crops for biofuels production in detriment of the food supply on a global scale. Essentially the debate refers to the possibility that by farmers increasing their production of these crops, often through government subsidy incentives, their time and land is shifted away from other types of non-biofuel crops driving up the price of non-biofuel crops due to the decrease in production.The Impact of US Biofuel Policies on Agricultural Price Levels and Volatility, By Bruce A. Babcock, Center for Agricultural and Rural Development, Iowa State University, for ICTSD, Issue Paper No. 35. June 2011. Therefore, it is not only that there is an increase in demand for the food staples, like corn and cassava, that sustain the majority of the world's poor but this also has the potential to increase the price of the remaining crops that these individuals would otherwise need to utilize to supplement their diets. A recent study for the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development shows that market-driven expansion of ethanol in the US increased maize prices by 21 percent in 2009, in comparison with what prices would have been had ethanol production been frozen at 2004 levels. A November 2011 study states that biofuels, their production, and their subsidies are leading causes of agricultural price shocks.\\"Even the U.N. Hates Ethanol.\\" Wall Street Journal, 14 June 2011, A14. The counter-argument includes considerations of the type of corn that is utilized in biofuels, often field corn not suitable for human consumption; the portion of the corn that is used in ethanol, the starch portion; and the negative effect higher prices for corn and grains have on government welfare for these products. The \\"food vs. fuel\\" or \\"food or fuel\\" debate is internationally controversial, with disagreement about how significant this is, what is causing it, what the effect is, and what can or should be done about it. ===Poverty reduction=== Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute have argued that biofuels could help to reduce poverty in the developing world, through increased employment, wider economic growth multipliers and by stabilising oil prices (many developing countries are net importers of oil).Leturque, Henri and Wiggins, Steve (2009) Biofuels: Could the South benefit? London: Overseas Development Institute However, this potential is described as 'fragile', and is reduced where feedstock production tends to be large scale, or causes pressure on limited agricultural resources: capital investment, land, water, and the net cost of food for the poor. With regards to the potential for poverty reduction or exacerbation, biofuels rely on many of the same policy, regulatory or investment shortcomings that impede agriculture as a route to poverty reduction. Since many of these shortcomings require policy improvements at a country level rather than a global one, they argue for a country-by-country analysis of the potential poverty effects of biofuels. This would consider, among other things, land administration systems, market coordination and prioritizing investment in biodiesel, as this 'generates more labour, has lower transportation costs and uses simpler technology'.Biofuels, Agriculture and Poverty Reduction Overseas Development Institute Also necessary are reductions in the tariffs on biofuel imports regardless of the country of origin, especially due to the increased efficiency of biofuel production in countries such as Brazil. ===Sustainable biofuel production=== Responsible policies and economic instruments would help to ensure that biofuel commercialization, including the development of new cellulosic technologies, is sustainable. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and impoverished Asia. ==Environmental effectsSoil erosion and deforestation=== Large-scale deforestation of mature trees (which help remove CO2 through photosynthesis — much better than sugar cane or most other biofuel feedstock crops do) contributes to soil erosion, un-sustainable global warming atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, loss of habitat, and a reduction of valuable biodiversity (both on land as in oceans).Paul Ehrlich and Anne Ehrlich, Extinction, Random House, New York (1981) Demand for biofuel has led to clearing land for palm oil plantations. In Indonesia alone, over of forest have been converted to plantations since 1996. A portion of the biomass should be retained onsite to support the soil resource. Normally this will be in the form of raw biomass, but processed biomass is also an option. If the exported biomass is used to produce syngas, the process can be used to co- produce biochar, a low-temperature charcoal used as a soil amendment to increase soil organic matter to a degree not practical with less recalcitrant forms of organic carbon. For co-production of biochar to be widely adopted, the soil amendment and carbon sequestration value of co-produced charcoal must exceed its net value as a source of energy. \\"Prehistorically modified soils of central Amazonia: a model for sustainable agriculture in the twenty-first century\\", by Bruno Glaser at the Institute of Soil Science and Soil Geography, University of Bayreuth (see the \\"Terra Preta Web Site\\" ). Extract available here . Published online December 20, 2006 in Philosophic Transactions Royal Society B (2007) 362, 187–196. . 1978. This article studies the evidences concerning the process of generation of Terra preta as well as the reasons why its organic matter's and nutrients' retention is so superior to the surrounding soils. Some commentators claim that removal of additional cellulosic biomass for biofuel production will further deplete soils. \\"Peak Soil: Why cellulosic ethanol, biofuels are unsustainable and a threat to America\\", by Alice Friedemann, April 2007. === Effect on water resources === Increased use of biofuels puts increasing pressure on water resources in at least two ways: water use for the irrigation of crops used as feedstocks for biodiesel production; and water use in the production of biofuels in refineries, mostly for boiling and cooling. In many parts of the world supplemental or full irrigation is needed to grow feedstocks. For example, if in the production of corn (maize) half the water needs of crops are met through irrigation and the other half through rainfall, about 860 liters of water are needed to produce one liter of ethanol.To calculate this relationship, one has to take into account that irrigated corn needs about 560 cubic meters (2.1m gallons) of water per ton of corn (as quoted in Eco-World. Ed Ring:Is bio-fuel water positive? June 4, 2007 using estimates from the University of Colorado and UNESCO, as well as a clarification by David Nielsen, Research Agronomist, USDA-ARS, Akron, Colorado, posted on July 19, 2007.) A good ethanol yield is about 480 gallons per acre per year, and a typical corn yield is 5.6 tons per acre per year. Assuming that half the crop water needs can be met through rainfall, this would mean that still 1,570 cubic meter (1.57m liter) - 280 cubic meter of water per ton, multiplied by 5.6 tons per acre - of irrigation water are needed per acre per year to produce 1,817 liter (480 gallons) of ethanol. However, in the United States only 5-15% of the water required for corn comes from irrigation while the other 85-95% comes from natural rainfall. In the United States, the number of ethanol factories has almost tripled from 50 in 2000 to about 140 in 2008. A further 60 or so are under construction, and many more are planned. Projects are being challenged by residents at courts in Missouri (where water is drawn from the Ozark Aquifer), Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas (all of which draw water from the non-renewable Ogallala Aquifer), central Illinois (where water is drawn from the Mahomet Aquifer) and Minnesota.The Economist, March 1, 2008, Ethanol and water: don't mix, p. 36 For example, the four ethanol crops: corn, sugarcane, sweet sorghum and pine yield net energy. However, increasing production in order to meet the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act mandates for renewable fuels by 2022 would take a heavy toll in the states of Florida and Georgia. The sweet sorghum, which performed the best of the four, would increase the amount of freshwater withdrawals from the two states by almost 25%.Barnett, Cynthia. \\"Fueling worries: four ethanol crops under consideration in Florida are very thirsty.(NATURAL RESOURCES).\\" Florida Trend 52.4 (July 2009): 18(1). General OneFile. Gale. BENTLEY UPPER SCHOOL LIBRARY (BAISL). 6 Oct. 2009 http://find.galegroup.com/gps/start.do?prodId=IPS ===Pollution=== Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and other aldehydes are produced when alcohols are oxidized. When only a 10% mixture of ethanol is added to gasoline (as is common in American E10 gasohol and elsewhere), aldehyde emissions increase 40%. Some study results are conflicting on this fact however, and lowering the sulfur content of biofuel mixes lowers the acetaldehyde levels.Issues Associated with the Use of Higher Ethanol Blends (E17-E24) Burning biodiesel also emits aldehydes and other potentially hazardous aromatic compounds which are not regulated in emissions laws. Many aldehydes are toxic to living cells. Formaldehyde irreversibly cross-links protein amino acids, which produces the hard flesh of embalmed bodies. At high concentrations in an enclosed space, formaldehyde can be a significant respiratory irritant causing nose bleeds, respiratory distress, lung disease, and persistent headaches.CDC tests confirm FEMA units are toxic - Life - nbcnews.com Acetaldehyde, which is produced in the body by alcohol drinkers and found in the mouths of smokers and those with poor oral hygiene, is carcinogenic and mutagenic.Symposium «Alcohol and Health: an Update», June 15, 2005, Abstract of H. K. Seitz, Departement of Medicine, Salem Medical Center, Heidelberg, Germany The European Union has banned products that contain Formaldehyde, due to its documented carcinogenic characteristics. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has labeled Formaldehyde as a probable cause of cancer in humans. Brazil burns significant amounts of ethanol biofuel. Gas chromatograph studies were performed of ambient air in São Paulo, Brazil, and compared to Osaka, Japan, which does not burn ethanol fuel. Atmospheric Formaldehyde was 160% higher in Brazil, and Acetaldehyde was 260% higher. ==Technical issues Energy efficiency and energy balance === Despite its occasional proclamation as a \\"green\\" fuel, first-generation biofuels, primarily ethanol, are not without their own GHG emissions. While ethanol does produce fewer overall GHG emissions than gasoline, its production is still an energy intensive process with secondary effects. Gasoline generally produces 8.91 kg CO2 per gallon, compared to 8.02 kg CO2 per gallon for E10 ethanol and 1.34 kg CO2 per gallon for E85 ethanol. Based on a study by Dias de Oliveira et al. (2005), corn-based ethanol requires 65.02 gigajoules (GJ) of energy per hectare (ha) and produces approximately 1236.72 kg per ha of carbon dioxide (CO2), while sugar cane-based ethanol requires 42.43 GJ/ha and produces 2268.26 kg/ha of CO2 under the assumption of non-carbon neutral energy production. These emissions accrue from agricultural production, crop cultivation, and ethanol processing. Once the ethanol is blended with gasoline, it results in carbon-savings of approximately 0.89 kg of CO2 per gallon consumed (U.S. D.O.E., 2011a).Anthony Gokianluy et al.,. \\"A Cost And Benefit, Case Study Analysis Of Biofuels Systems\\". Harvard College Review of Environment and Society. N.p., 2016. Web. 26 Nov. 2016. === Economic viability === From a production standpoint, miscanthus can produce 742 gallons of ethanol per acre of land, which is nearly twice as much as corn (399 gal/acre, assuming average yield of 145 bushels per acre under normal corn-soybean rotation) and nearly three times as much as corn stover (165 gal/acre) and switchgrass (214 gal/acre). Production costs are a big impediment to large- scale implementation of 2nd Generation bio-fuels, and their market demand will depend primarily on their price competitiveness relative to corn ethanol and gasoline. At this time, costs of conversion of cellulosic fuels, at $1.46 per gallon, were roughly twice that of corn-based ethanol, at $0.78 per gallon. Cellulosic biofuels from corn stover and miscanthus were 24% and 29% more expensive than corn ethanol, respectively, and switchgrass biofuel is more than twice as expensive as corn ethanol. {  Description (CASE) ('000 US$) Developed Nation (2G) CASE A Developing Nation (2G) CASE B Developed Nation (1G) CASE C Developing Nation (1G) CASE D - Operating Profit 209,313  -1,176,017 166,952  -91,300 - Net Present Value 100,690  -1,011,217 40,982 39,224 - Return on Investment 1.41 0.32 1.17 0.73 } ===Carbon emissions=== Biofuels and other forms of renewable energy aim to be carbon neutral or even carbon negative. Carbon neutral means that the carbon released during the use of the fuel, e.g. through burning to power transport or generate electricity, is reabsorbed and balanced by the carbon absorbed by new plant growth. These plants are then harvested to make the next batch of fuel. Carbon neutral fuels lead to no net increases in human contributions to atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, reducing the human contributions to global warming. A carbon negative aim is achieved when a portion of the biomass is used for carbon sequestration. \\"Carbon negative energy to reverse global warming\\" (a posting to Energy Resources Group on Yahoo). Report on the symposium (EACU) in 2004 at the University of Georgia at Athens (Georgia, USA). Several scientists from very diverse disciplines: chemistry, archeology, physics, anthropology, microbiology, pedology, agronomy, researchers in renewable energies, and representatives for the DOE (Department of Environment), USDA and industry. Aim: to observe the evidences of massive utilization of carbon in history, make a synopsis on present research, and study how carbon-negative energy can be economically deployed today\\" (See also ) Calculating exactly how much greenhouse gas (GHG) is produced in burning biofuels is a complex and inexact process, which depends very much on the method by which the fuel is produced and other assumptions made in the calculation. The carbon emissions (carbon footprint) produced by biofuels are calculated using a technique called Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). This uses a \\"cradle to grave\\" or \\"well to wheels\\" approach to calculate the total amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted during biofuel production, from putting seed in the ground to using the fuel in cars and trucks. Many different LCAs have been done for different biofuels, with widely differing results. Several well-to-wheel analysis for biofuels has shown that first generation biofuels can reduce carbon emissions, with savings depending on the feedstock used, and second generation biofuels can produce even higher savings when compared to using fossil fuels. Presented at the 15th International Symposium on Alcohol Fuels, San Diego, California. For more detail see also the Notes 27 and 28 for Chapter 4, pp. 272.Concawe European WTW study This graph assumes that all bioethanols are burnt in their country of origin and that previously existing cropland is used to grow the feedstock. However, those studies did not take into account emissions from nitrogen fixation, or additional carbon emissions due to indirect land use changes. In addition, many LCA studies fail to analyze the effect of substitutes that may come into the market to replace current biomass-based products. In the case of Crude Tall Oil, a raw material used in the production of pine chemicals and now being diverted for use in biofuel, an LCA study found that the global carbon footprint of pine chemicals produced from CTO is 50 percent lower than substitute products used in the same situation offsetting any gains from utilizing a biofuel to replace fossil fuels. Additionally the study showed that fossil fuels are not reduced when CTO is diverted to biofuel use and the substitute products consume disproportionately more energy. This diversion will negatively affect an industry that contributes significantly to the world economy, globally producing more than 3 billion pounds of pine chemicals annually in complex, high technology refineries and providing jobs directly and indirectly for tens of thousands of workers. A paper published in February 2008 in Sciencexpress by a team led by Searchinger from Princeton University concluded that once considered indirect land use changes effects in the life cycle assessment of biofuels used to substitute gasoline, instead of savings both corn and cellulosic ethanol increased carbon emissions as compared to gasoline by 93 and 50 percent respectively. Originally published online in Science Express on 7 February 2008. A second paper published in the same issue of Sciencexpress, by a team led by Fargione from The Nature Conservancy, found that a carbon debt is created when natural lands are cleared and being converted to biofuel production and to crop production when agricultural land is diverted to biofuel production, therefore this carbon debt applies to both direct and indirect land use changes. Originally published online in Science Express on 7 February 2008, available here . The Searchinger and Fargione studies gained prominent attention in both the popular media This article was the cover story of the April 7, 2008 print edition entitled \\"The Clean Energy Myth\\". Reply letter by Joe Jobe, CEO of the National Biodiesel Board published in the \\"Inbox\\" section in Time's April 21 issue. and in scientific journals. The methodology, however, drew some criticism, with Wang and Haq from Argonne National Laboratory posted a public letter and send their criticism about the Searchinger paper to Letters to Science. The published version on Science Letters is included in Searchinger E-Letter responses 2008-08-12 Another criticism by Kline and Dale from Oak Ridge National Laboratory was published in Letters to Science. They argued that Searchinger et al. and Fargione et al. \\"...do not provide adequate support for their claim that biofuels cause high emissions due to land-use change. This reference also includes Timothy Searching and Joseph Fargione responses to Kline and Dale (Science Vol 321). The U.S. biofuel industry also reacted, claiming in a public letter, that the \\"Searchinger study is clearly a \\"worst-case scenario\\" analysis...\\" and that this study \\"relies on a long series of highly subjective assumptions...\\". ===Engine design=== The modifications necessary to run internal combustion engines on biofuel depend on the type of biofuel used, as well as the type of engine used. For example, gasoline engines can run without any modification at all on biobutanol. Minor modifications are however needed to run on bioethanol or biomethanol. Diesel engines can run on the latter fuels, as well as on vegetable oils (which are cheaper). However, the latter is only possible when the engine has been foreseen with indirect injection. If no indirect injection is present, the engine hence needs to be fitted with this. ==Campaigns== A number of environmental NGOs campaign against the production of biofuels as a large-scale alternative to fossil fuels. For example, Friends of the Earth state that \\"the current rush to develop agrofuels (or biofuels) on a large scale is ill-conceived and will contribute to an already unsustainable trade whilst not solving the problems of climate change or energy security\\".February 2008 Retrieved November 8, 2008 Some mainstream environmental groups support biofuels as a significant step toward slowing or stopping global climate change.July 2007 Retrieved November 8, 2008June 19, 2007 Retrieved November 8, 2008 However, supportive environmental groups generally hold the view that biofuel production can threaten the environment if it is not done sustainably. This finding has been backed by reports of the UN, the IPCC,IPCC's Mitigation of Climate Change report negative on biofuels. and some other smaller environmental and social groups as the EEBBiofuels no panacea (PDF). and the Bank Sarasin,Biofuels — Transporting Us to a Fossil-Free Future? . which generally remain negative about biofuels. As a result, governmentalGovernmental (OECD) organizations against unsustainable biofuels. and environmental organizations are turning against biofuels made in a non- sustainable way (hereby preferring certain oil sources as jatropha and lignocellulose over palm oil)Friends of the Earth, Oxfam, ... preferring jatropha over palm oil. and are asking for global support for this.Environmental organizations against non-sustainable biofuels 1 .Environmental organizations against non-sustainable biofuels 2 . Also, besides supporting these more sustainable biofuels, environmental organizations are redirecting to new technologies that do not use internal combustion engines such as hydrogen and compressed air.Zero Carbon Environmental Organization . Several standard-setting and certification initiatives have been set up on the topic of biofuels. The \\"Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels\\" is an international initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists who are interested in the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution. During 2008, the Roundtable is developing a series of principles and criteria for sustainable biofuels production through meetings, teleconferences, and online discussions.The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels: Ensuring Biofuels Deliver on their Promise of Sustainability In a similar vein, the Bonsucro standard has been developed as a metric-based certificate for products and supply chains, as a result of an ongoing multi- stakeholder initiative focussing on the products of sugar cane, including ethanol fuel. The increased manufacture of biofuels will require increasing land areas to be used for agriculture. Second and third generation biofuel processes can ease the pressure on land, because they can use waste biomass, and existing (untapped) sources of biomass such as crop residues and potentially even marine algae. In some regions of the world, a combination of increasing demand for food, and increasing demand for biofuel, is causing deforestation and threats to biodiversity. The best reported example of this is the expansion of oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia, where rainforest is being destroyed to establish new oil palm plantations. It is an important fact that 90% of the palm oil produced in Malaysia is used by the food industry;Malaysian Palm Oil Council. therefore biofuels cannot be held solely responsible for this deforestation. There is a pressing need for sustainable palm oil production for the food and fuel industries; palm oil is used in a wide variety of food products. The Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels is working to define criteria, standards and processes to promote sustainably produced biofuels.Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels website. Palm oil is also used in the manufacture of detergents, and in electricity and heat generation both in Asia and around the world (the UK burns palm oil in coal- fired power stations to generate electricity). Significant area is likely to be dedicated to sugar cane in future years as demand for ethanol increases worldwide. The expansion of sugar cane plantations will place pressure on environmentally sensitive native ecosystems including rainforest in South America.BBC News.

For a century the firm's core business was taking and publishing photographs of the Victorian public and social, artistic, scientific and political luminaries. In the 1880s the company operated three studios and four large storage facilities for negatives, with a printing works at Barnet. The firm's first address was 55 & 56 Baker Street in London, premises they occupied until 1919. The studio employed a number of photographers, including Francis Henry Hart and Alfred James Philpott in the Edwardian era, Herbert Lambert and Walter Benington in the 1920s and 1930s and subsequently William Flowers. During World War II the studio was bombed and most of the early negatives were lost, the National Portrait Gallery holding all the surviving negatives. With the firm's centenary in 1963 it was taken over by Bassano & Vandyk. ==Joseph John Elliott== Joseph John Elliott (14 October 1835 CroydonHannavy, John Encyclopedia of Nineteenth-century Photography, Volume 1 A-I' Published by Routledge (2007) pg 479 – 30 March 1903 Hadley Heath, near Barnet) the son of John and Mary Elliott, he married Clarence's sister, Elizabeth Lucy Fry (24 June 1844 Plymouth – 23 February 1931), in Brighton on 20 August 1864, eventually producing 4 sons and 3 daughters.

In 2013, BTA incorporated as a stand-alone 501(c)3 organization in the United States.. Each year, BTA donates bicycles (and tools) to healthcare workers in Africa, particularly those involved in HIV/AIDS-related work. BTA volunteers travel to Africa to assemble and give away bicycles to recipient organizations (typically established, qualified HIV clinics, hospitals, or NGOs). BTA then documents the impact these bicycles have on the personal and professional lives of the recipients. Besides healthcare workers, BikeTown Africa has also donated bicycles to orphans and farmers as well as working in other countries outside of Africa, notably Afghanistan. The organization also includes training for mechanics in the areas the bicycles are distributed, as well as providing tools to equip the trained mechanics. ==History== The project started in 2006 with 200 bicycles donated to HIV/AIDS healthcare workers in Gaborone and Bobanang, Botswana. In 2007, BTS expanded. 150 bicycles were distributed in Katima Mulilo, Namibia, and 169 in Tambacounda, Senegal. That same year, BikeTown Africa changed some of its policies, insisting that the bicycles must be owned by individual recipients rather than the organization, so as to promote personal responsibility for the maintenance and repair of the bikes. In return, each recipient must agree to volunteer with the organization for a fixed amount of time or devote an agreed amount of time to help sustain the project. Recipients in Lesotho earned their bicycles through attending races, cleaning up rubbish in the city, and good attendance at school. 1,000 AfricaBikes were donated in 2008. These bicycles were distributed in South Africa, Swaziland, and Mozambique. In 2009, 750 bicycles were distributed. During September 2009, an international team of volunteers assembled 268 bicycles in the Orange Farm township of Gauteng, South Africa. These were donated to the Catholic Healthcare Association of South Africa for distribution to their affiliates in South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland. The final two projects for 2009 happened in Kibaha and Bukoba, Tanzania. In March 2010, 100 Specialized Fuse BMX bikes were distributed to four tracks built by AMA Rider for children in townships around Cape Town. In August 2010, 120 Kona AfricaBikes were distributed in Malawi at the Baylor Tingathe Community Outreach Program. A further 120 bicycles were donated to Foundation Rwanda. In September 2010, 250 bikes were distributed in The Gambia, with assistance from the HopeFirst Foundation. In 2011, BikeTown Africa was approached by AMA Rider to assist with its children's mountain biking league. BTA volunteers traveled to Lesotho to work with the Lesotho Cycling Association in building a cyclocross track and providing 33 mountain bicycles for all schoolchildren to use for a season of four races. The track was built on the Lesotho Olympic Training grounds in Maseru. After the series of races during the season, all 33 bicycles were handed over to the children who performed best on and off the track. In 2012 BTA traveled to Mwanza, Tanzania to assemble and give away 100 bicycles to HIV healthcare workers at the Baylor Pediatric AIDS Hospital there. ==Bicycles== The primary bicycle used in BikeTown Africa is called the Kona AfricaBike. It was designed by Kona Bicycle Company to fit the unique needs of healthcare workers in Africa. Over the project's lifespan, the bicycle has undergone various changes and additions. BikeTown Africa also has distributed bicycles manufactured by Specialized. ==Current status== As of July 2013, the last status update on the Facebook page is a year old. The Kona website still lists the AfricaBike 3 for sale, but links to the project are all no longer active. A search of the current Rodale, Inc. and The Rodale Institute websites returns 'There are no results for \\"AfricaBike\\".' The last mention of BikeTown Africa in Bicycling magazine is in 2009. The last tweet was on 28 October 2010. On 4 January 2011, Maria Rodale, then CEO and Chairman of Rodale, Inc., published an article about BikeTown Africa in The Huffington Post. ==See also== * Baisikeli Ugunduzi * Bamboo Bike Project * Bikes Not Bombs * Bikes to Rwanda * Pedaling to Freedom * With My Own Two Wheels * World Bicycle Relief * Working Bikes ==References *BikeTown Africa on Facebook *BikeTown Africa on WordPress *BikeTown Africa on Twitter Category:Charities based in New York (state) Category:Rodale, Inc.

Founding Fathers of Singapore Wrestling: Mike Denoma and Jimmy Taenaka WFS appointed Sergei Beloglazov as the first Singapore National Head Coach. Beloglazov was a former six times World Champion and two times Olympic Champion. Singapore claimed its first medal in their 1st appearance at the 2009 Southeast Asian Games in Laos. Mohamad Sulaiman took a silver medal in the 74kg Freestyle Wrestling category. Melvynna Tambunan is Singapore's first female wrestler at 48kg, competing in the 2009 Asian Senior Championships, 2009 Klippan Lady Open, 2009 World Championships in Denmark and 2009 Southeast Asian Games in Laos. Freestyle Wrestling in Singapore is currently being developed with the intent of becoming accepted as one of the national sports. Styles will include Freestyle, Greco-Roman, Beach wrestling. The Wrestling Federation of Singapore's belt system is the first belt system to ever be adopted by a national governing body for wrestling in the world. This unique system was designed by a committee made up of national coaches from both Russia and the United States, and it has a total of 9 levels of belts ranging from the Yellow Belt and advancing to a 4th degree of Black Belt. The initial belts are based on the number of approved techniques mastered and the more advanced belts require increasingly difficult levels of success in actual competition. The Yellow Belt requires that a wrestler demonstrate a mastery of 8 qualified techniques or participation in 60 training sessions. The Orange Belt requires a demonstrated mastery of 20 qualified techniques or participation in 120 training sessions. In Singapore, wrestling is promoting/taught to all schools to create awareness of the sport. Many parents think the sport of wrestling is dangerous because of the World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). WFS is increasing awareness in Singapore on the safety, technique, conditioning and discipline of the sport. ==References== * The Straits Times (7 May 2009): https://web.archive.org/web/20110716152112/http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2009/5/6/take- a-bow * Sports@SG MediaCorp5: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbktE67gdSc * SingaporeSports.SG (9 December 2009): https://web.archive.org/web/20110726125501/http://www.teamsingapore.com.sg/content/major_games/sea/25th_sea_games_laosvientiane2009/news/sea_games_2009_news/breaking_new_grounds.html * ChannelNewsAsia (7 April 2010): http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/sportsnews/view/1048374/1/.html ==External links== * Website: http://www.singaporewrestling.com * FILA: http://www.fila-wrestling.com/ * Asian Council of Associated Wrestling-AAWC: http://www.ocasia.org/Sports/SportsFed.aspx?SFCode=62&SFType;=1 Wrestling ","title":"Wrestling Federation of Singapore"},{"id":"19243139","text":"The Grand Hyatt Manila is a mixed-used skyscraper, located in Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, Metro Manila.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 397 F.2d 82, (9th Cir.1968) is a trust for the benefit of individuals into which gifts are made in a manner qualifying them for exclusion from the unified gift and estate tax. Crummey trust is also referred to as a Crummey provision or a Crummey power. A Crummey provision can be contained within another type of trust. Normally life insurance trusts will have a Crummey provision. Normally, gifts to minors are subject to parental / guardian control until the age of majority. In order to delay the transfer of control beyond the age of 18, the funds must be placed in trust. However, the annual gift exclusion ($15,000 per individual and $30,000 per married couple as of 2018) from the gift tax is only available for gifts of so-called present interests. Normally, a gift into a trust that comes under control of the beneficiary at a future date does not constitute a present interest. A Crummey trust achieves the desired treatment by offering the recipient a window of time (often 30 days) to take immediate control of the gift. (The control offered only applies to the current gift - by assumption, an amount no greater than the annual exclusion amount - not the entire trust.) If the recipient fails to do so during that window, the gift becomes part of the trust, and is subject to the trust's distribution conditions. However, since the recipient had the opportunity to receive the funds outside of the trust, the gift is deemed to be a present interest, subjecting it to the annual exclusion. The expectation of future annual gifts under the same mechanism (or the expectation of the withholding of such future gifts if the recipient exerts control over the gift) may motivate the recipient to relinquish control of the funds into the trust. A Crummey provision is typically a provision within another trust and ordinarily works as follows. The grantor makes a gift to an irrevocable living trust. The trust beneficiaries are notified by the trustee that they have the power for a specified time period to withdraw some or all of the gift to the trust. The simultaneous acts of the grantor transferring property to the trust and the trust beneficiaries being permitted to withdraw the gift from the trust is deemed to be the same as giving the gift to the beneficiaries outright. The gift to the trust with the Crummey provision now qualifies for the annual gift exclusion. The Crummey Trust is named after D. Clifford Crummey, who, in the 1960s, first came up with the idea. The U.S. Tax Court found this action legal in 1968, and the nickname \\"Crummey Power\\" stuck. ==Use in life insurance trusts== In addition, similar provisions are often added to life insurance trusts or \\"ILITs\\" in order to maintain the annual gift tax exclusion by funding the ILIT using Crummey powers. This way additional gifts and beneficiaries can be taken advantage of to fund the life insurance trust. If executed properly the beneficiaries will receive the proceeds of the life insurance trust free of income or estate taxes. ==See also== *Rabbi trust ==References *http://www.willsandprobate.com/FAQ/crummey.htm *http://www.finaid.org/savings/crummey.phtml *http://www.fool.com/personal- finance/retirement/2006/11/14/crummey-trusts-arent-crummy. *https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Frequently- Asked-Questions-on-Gift-Taxes Category:Wills and trusts Category:Taxation in the United States ","title":"Crummey trust"},{"id":"19243194","text":", also known as Okinoerabu, is one of the Satsunan Islands, classed with the Amami archipelago between Kyūshū and Okinawa.Teikoku's Complete Atlas of Japan, Teikoku-Shoin Co., Ltd., Tokyo, The island, 93.63 km² in area, has a population of approximately 14,000 persons. Administratively it is divided into the towns of Wadomari and China in Kagoshima Prefecture. Much of the island is within the borders of the Amami Guntō National Park. ==Geography== Okinoerabujima is isolated from the other Amami islands, and is located in between Tokunoshima and Yoronjima, approximately south of the southern tip of Kyūshū and north of Okinawa. The island is an elevated coralline island with a length of approximately and width of , with Mount Ōyama at above sea level at its highest peak.Map of Okinoerabujima In the eastern part of the island is an extensive limestone cave system, one of the largest in Asia.Guide to Amami Islands - Okinoerabujima The coast of the island is surrounded by a coral reef. ==History== It is uncertain when Okinoerabujima was first settled. It was ruled by the Aji nobility who built numerous gusuku fortifications from the 8th century onwards. From 1266 it was part of Hokuzan, and from 1422 the Ryukyu Kingdom. The island was invaded by samurai from Satsuma Domain during the 1609 Invasion of Ryukyu and its incorporation into the official holdings of Satsuma was recognized by the Tokugawa shogunate in 1624. Satsuma rule was harsh, with the inhabitants of the island reduced to serfdom and forced to raise sugar cane to meet high taxation, which often resulted in famine. The island was subordinate to Tokunoshima from 1616 to 1690, when an independent daikansho was established. Throughout the Satsuma period, the island was used as a prison settlement, especially for political offenders, including many members of the Ryukyuan royal family. Saigō Takamori was exiled to Okinoerabujima from 1862 to 1864. After the Meiji Restoration the island was incorporated into Ōsumi Province and later became part of Kagoshima Prefecture. Following World War II, along with the other Amami Islands, it was occupied by the United States until 1953, at which time it reverted to the control of Japan. In September 1977, a massive typhoon (Typhoon Babe (1977)) devastated the island, which experienced winds in excess of for two hours as the typhoon passed by. Nearly two-thirds of the homes across the island were damaged or destroyed by the storm and 73 people were injured. Most of the injuries across the island were caused by collapsing buildings. ==Climate== Okinoerabujima has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification Cfa) with very warm summers and mild winters. Precipitation is significant throughout the year, but is somewhat lower in winter. The island is subject to frequent typhoons. ==Fauna== Okinoerabujima is home to several rare species of reptiles and insects endemic to the island itself, or more generally to the Ryukyu Islands. The island is one of fewer locations where swimming with whales (humpback whales) is legally approved. Kamibayashi T.. 2014. 沖永良部島の ホエールスイムとケイビング - Tourism activities in Okinoerabu Island：Swimming with whales and caving. みどりいし (25). pp.36-37. Retrieved on February 15, 2017 ==Economy== With moderate rainfall and a warm climate, the island is suitable for agriculture. Main crops include sweet potatoes, sugar cane and floriculture. Brown sugar refining and the production of distilled shōchū liquor is the major industry. The island is not a major tourist destination, unlike many in the Amami archipelago. ==Transportation== The port of Wadomari, located in the town of the same name, has regular ferry services to Okinawa and Kagoshima. The smaller port of China, in the town of China, has ferries to Kagoshima and other of the Amami islands. Okinoerabu Airport, in Wadomari, is located in east side of the island. Flights connect the island to Kagoshima, Tokunoshima, Amami (via Tokunoshima), and Okinawa (Naha). ==See also== *Okinoerabu language ==References== *Eldridge, Mark.

From 1954 to 1957 she was educated as a ceramist at the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry in Oslo, with Jens von der Lippe as supervisor. She was employed in von der Lippe's workshop as a ceramist from 1958 to 1959. She married the teacher and farmer Torbjørn Valla in 1967 and moved to Korgen in the municipality of Hemnes. There, she continued teaching and also accepted many freelance assignments. ==Artistic career== From 1959 to 1963 she was engaged as a designer at the Stavangerflint AS earthenware factory in Stavanger, Norway where she served as a member of the company's artistic staff under the directorship of Kåre Berven Fjeldsaa. While employed at Stavangerflint, Anne Lofthus created designs for ceramic tableware and items for decoration or special occasions. She also made many souvenir objects for cities and tourist sites in Norway and abroad. Her most famous designs for tableware are Tiril, Vinge and the children's set Du som metter liten fugl (Lord you feed the little bird). She left Stavangerflint in 1963 and in 1963/64 she continued her education at the National School for Teaching of Woodwork and Drawing in Notodden, Norway. In subsequent years she worked as a teacher, giving lessons in Arts and Crafts while continuing to work as a ceramist. Anne Lofthus created the coat of arms for the Norwegian community of Hemnes and established her own ceramic workshop at Valla, Norway where she was active until 1996.

The office of the King of Arms in Spain originated from those of the heralds (heraldos). In the early days of heraldry, anyone could bear arms, which led to disputes between individuals and families. These disputes were originally settled by the king, in the case of a dispute between nobles, or by a lower ranked official when the dispute involved non-nobles. Eventually, the task of settling these disputes was passed on to officials called heralds who were originally responsible for setting up tournaments and carrying messages between nobles. The Spanish Cronista de Armas heraldic office dates back to the 16th century. Prior to that, heralds were usually named after provinces and non-capital cities, whilst reyes de armas were named after the Spanish kingdoms. Various chroniclers of arms were named for Spain, Castile, León, Frechas, Seville, Córdoba, Murcia, Granada (created in 1496 to honor the reunification of Spain), Estella, Viana, Navarre, Catalonia, Sicily, Aragon, Naples, Toledo, Valencia and Majorca. While these appointments were not hereditary, at least fifteen Spanish families produced more than one herald each in the past 500 years (compared to about the same number for England, Scotland and Ireland collectively).http://heraldry.freeservers.com/heralds.html The Spanish Cronistas had judicial powers in matters of noble titles. They also served as a registration office for pedigrees and grants of arms. Arms of Eduardo Madrid Brillantes registered by the Cronista of Castile and León, Don Alfonso Ceballos-Escalera y Gil-Marques of La Floresta The post of King of Arms took several forms and eventually settled on a Corps of Chronicler King of Arms (Cuerpo de Cronista Rey de Armas), which was headed by an elder or dean (decano). It usually consisted of four officers and two assistants or undersecretaries that acted as witnesses to documents. The entire corps wore a distinctive uniform. The corps was considered part of the royal household and was generally responsible to the Master of the King's Stable, an important position in the Middle Ages. Appointments to the Corps of King of Arms were made by the King or reigning Queen. These appointments were for life and while not intended to be hereditary, often went from father to son or other close family member. The Spanish heralds had other duties that pertained to matters of protocol and often acted as royal messengers and emissaries. They could, and can, make arrangements for areas currently or previously under the rule of the Spanish crown.Official Heraldic Authorities at The International Association of Amateur Heralds. The precise functions and duties of the King of Arms were clearly defined by the declarations of several Kings and are still in force today.Decreto 105/1991, 9 May (Boletín Oficial de Castilla y León de 16 May 1991) In modern times the Corps of Chronicler King of Arms went through several changes. Important changes were made in 1915. The office was abolished in 1931 and restored in 1947–1951. The last Chronicler Kings of Arms appointed by the Spanish Ministry of Justice, Don Vicente de Cadenas y Vicent, died in 2005. ==Castile and León== The government of the autonomous community of Castile and León appointed Don Alfonso de Ceballos-Escalera y Gila, Marques de la Floresta, as Chronicler of Arms for Castile and León. Don Alfonso also serves as personal heraldic officer to the former King of Spain Juan Carlos I and the current King Felipe VI of Spain . Formerly, everything that the Spanish heralds did had to be reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Justice for it to be valid. However, the legislation of Castile and León established the Chronicler of Arms of Castile and León as the modern equivalent of the ancient King of Arms of the ancient Kingdom of Castile and Leon, with rights to all the traditional powers and competences pertaining to this office.Decreto 105/1991, 9 May (Boletín Oficial de Castilla y León de 16 May 1991) \\"Art. 16.- El Cronista de Armas de Castilla y León deberá informar cuantas cuestiones de su especialidad le sometan la Junta de Castilla y León y las Diputaciones Provinciales, y ostentará las facultades y competencias tradicionales de los antiguos Cronistas, Reyes de Armas y Heraldos de Castilla y León, contenidas en el Real Decreto de 29 de julio de 1915, y el Decreto de 13 de abril de 1951.\\" Ceballos-Escalera y Gila has appointed heraldic officers to support his efforts.

This Roman Catholic cemetery was founded in 1849, during a raging cholera epidemic. Many of Cincinnati's other cemeteries were already full of the victims. Many of Cincinnati's oldest German families are buried in this cemetery and the old stones are written in German. Burials also include 25 Franciscan Friars, who were founding members of the St. John the Baptist Providence. They first came to Cincinnati in July 1844, to serve the evergrowing German population. Some of these young men were as young as 17, 20 and 21, who had left their homelands to the German-speaking Catholics. Other burials include Clement Barnharm (1857–1935), a Cincinnati sculptor and his parents also John C.

The latter included Scouts from Somalia, and 1,300 representatives from the United Kingdom, the largest Scouting contingent from outside North America. For the British Scouts, dressed in their new uniforms, it was a highlight to their Diamond Jubilee Year. Other countries represented included Canada, France, Indonesia, Jamaica, the Philippines, and Sweden. Amongst the distinguished visitors were World Chief Guide Olave Baden- Powell, actor James Stewart and Vice President of the United States, Hubert H. Humphrey. Memorable features of the Jamboree included a reconstruction of Baden-Powell's Brownsea Island campsite, arena shows, Skill-o-Rama, adventure trail, the specially stocked fishing area and boating and other water activities on Lake Pend Oreille, in addition to a visit to a rodeo and a repeat of the Friendship Wide Game introduced at the 11th World Scout Jamboree in 1963. ==See also== XII Boy Scout World Jamboree * World Scout Jamboree *Scouting in Idaho ==NotesReferences== * * #1967 Category:Scouting in the United States Category:1967 in Idaho Category:July 1967 events Category:August 1967 events ","title":"12th World Scout Jamboree"},{"id":"19243649","text":"Around the time that the Pentium III processor was introduced, Intel's Xeon line diverged from its line of desktop processors, which at the time was using the Pentium branding. The divergence was implemented by using different sockets; since then, the sockets for Xeon chips have tended to remain constant across several generations of implementation. The chipsets contain a 'memory controller hub' and an 'I/O controller hub', which tend to be called 'north bridge' and 'south bridge' respectively. The memory controller hub connects to the processors, memory, high-speed I/O such as PCI Express, and to the I/O controller hub by a proprietary link. The I/O controller hub, on the other hand, connects to lower-speed I/O, such as SATA, PCI, USB, and Ethernet. == P6-based Xeon chipsets  Dual processor P6-based Xeon chipsets === Intel's initial preferred chipset for Pentium III Xeon was the 840. {  - !

These support Slot 2. There was also the 450NX PCIset, which consisted of several chips: a single 82451NX Memory and IO Bridge Controller roughly analogous to the North Bridge, up to two 82454NX PCI Expander Bridges which converted the protocol used by 451NX to two 32-bit PCI33 or one 64-bit PCI33 bus, along with up to two memory cards each equipped with one 82452NX RAS/CAS Generator chip and two 82453NX Data Path Multiplexer chips. It supported PIIX3 and PIIX4E south bridges, and EDO DRAM. === Eight processor P6-based Xeon chipset === In August 1999 Intel began shipping the Profusion PCIset. The chipset was based on technology developed by the Corollary company, which Intel acquired. It supported up to 8 Pentium III Xeon processors on two busses and maintained cache coherency between them. Profusion supported up to 32 GB of memory. It saw some limited competition from the NEC Aqua II chipset. Another minor player in the eight-way space was Axil Computer's NX801, which was used in an 8-way (two buses) Pentium Pro design, commercialized by Data General as their AV-8600 computer. == NetBurst- based Xeon chipsets  Dual processor NetBurst-based Xeon chipsets === E7500 corresponded to the first Northwood-based Pentium4 Xeons, E7501 is essentially identical but supports faster FSB and memory. The E7320, E7520 and E7525 chipsets correspond to Prescott-based Pentium4 Xeons, and differ mainly in their PCI Express support. These support Socket 604. {  - ! Product name ! Codename !

Her many designs on ceramic objects like \\"Per Spelemann\\", \\"Ut etter øl\\" and \\"Venner\\" are sought after by collectors of industrial ceramic objects from Norway. == Biography == Gro Pedersen Claussen was born in Stavanger, Norway . She was educated as a graphic designer at the Stavanger Technical College (1958–1961). Previously she had taken courses in drawing at The Stavanger Drawing School. Later on she also took lessons at an art school in ceramics. From 1963 to 1967 she was employed as a designer at the earthenware factory Stavangerflint AS, Hillevåg, Norway. She moved to the eastern part of Norway in 1967 but continued to create designs for Stavangerflint on a freelance basis to 1975. From 1977 Gro Pedersen Claussen worked as a textile designer for Sandvika Veveri in Bærum, Norway. She resigned in 2006 after 29 years of duty for the company. == The designer == Her most famous designs for Stavangerflint AS are those for the gift and collector items “Per Spelemann” and “Ut etter øl”, based on traditional Norwegian songs. She also created the design for the children’s sets ”Bæ, bæ, lille lam” and ”Venner”. She created the design for the tea, dinner and breakfast tableware on forms made by the company's design director, Kåre Berven Fjeldsaa. In addition, she created a large number of souvenir objects with motifs from Norway and abroad. At Sandvika Veveri she made designs that were printed on fabrics such as jute, linen and cotton. The source material for patterns constituted the largest part of the production. The fabrics were usually not credited the artists, but many of Gro Pedersen Claussens designs are known through printed promotional material and coverage in periodicals and newspapers. In 1992, in close cooperation with the Directorate for Cultural Heritage in Norway, she designed the carpet for the reception hall at the Eidsvoll Building in Eidsvoll where the Norwegian Constitution was agreed on in 1814. == The artist == Gro Pedersen Clausen also expressed herself as a painter and ceramist. She has had several exhibitions of her work and also joined group exhibitions in Stavanger and the Oslo area. == Sources == Stavangerflints archives at Figgjo AS, Various media coverage, Jan Gjerde: Gro Pedersen Claussen, http://gratisnettside.no/stavangerflinthistorie/?∣=572 , ”Fra Kvaleberg til cyberspace”, , Gro Pederesen Claussen’s private archive.

In 1887, he enrolled at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and graduated as a chemical engineer in 1890. In 1893 Sohlman became the assistant of Alfred Nobel in San Remo, and Nobel's will from 1895 named him and Rudolf Lilljequist as executors, with Sohlman expected to do most of the work. The will stated:Nobelprize.org: Alfred Nobel's Will (English translation) The sum of 100.000 crowns was a very significant amount at the time, and made Sohlman a wealthy man. The amount can be compared to the prize amount of the first Nobel Prizes in 1901, 150.782 crowns each.Nobelprize.org: Nobel Prize amounts After Alfred Nobel's death on December 10, 1896, Sohlman was occupied for several years with the task of realizing Nobel's intentions of establishing the Nobel Prize. Since the will did not contain detailed regulations regarding selection of laureates and was contested by Nobel's relatives, the task kept Sohlman and his advisors occupied for several years. Sohlman was a member of the interim board of the Nobel Foundation. Sohlman also had a career as engineer and manager in Nobel- related companies, such as Bofors.

He subsequently escaped from Prussian captivity and joined the armies of national defence for the rest of the war. ==Sino-French War== General Millot and his staff. De Négrier is sitting second to Millot's right. De Négrier joins Dugenne's column on the Bac Le plateau, 27 June 1884 De Négrier arrived in Tonkin in February 1884, and was given command of the 2nd Brigade of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. During the period of undeclared hostilities that preceded the Sino- French War he took part in the Bắc Ninh Campaign (March 1884) and the subsequent campaign to capture Hưng Hóa (April 1884). In June 1884 he was sent by General Charles-Théodore Millot, the general-in-chief of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps, to the aid of Colonel Alphonse Dugenne with a relief column when the news of the Bắc Lệ ambush reached Hanoi.Lecomte, Guet-apens, 175–91 During the Sino-French War he commanded the three French columns involved in the Kep Campaign (October 1884). The largest of these columns, under his personal command, defeated the right wing of the Cinese Guangxi Army at the Battle of Kep (8 October). De Négrier was wounded in the leg in this battle, and fell from his horse. His troops, believing that he had been killed, gave no quarter to the Chinese defenders when they stormed the village of Kep. In January 1885 de Négrier won the Battle of Núi Bop, often considered his professional masterpiece. In February 1885 he commanded the 2nd Brigade in the Lạng Sơn Campaign, in which the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps drove the Chinese from their entrenched camps at Dong Song and Bac Vie and captured Lạng Sơn. Immediately after the French capture of Lạng Sơn, General Louis Brière de l'Isle returned to Hanoi with Lieutenant-Colonel Giovanninelli's 1st Brigade to relieve the Siege of Tuyên Quang, leaving de Négrier at Lang Son with the 2nd Brigade. On 23 February 1885 de Négrier advanced from Lang Son and defeated the demoralised Guangxi Army at Đồng Đăng, close to the Chinese border, driving the Chinese out of Tonkin altogether. De Négrier briefly crossed into Guangxi province and blew up the Gate of China, an elaborate ceremonial gate erected by the Chinese at Zhennan Pass to mark the border between China and Annam.Armengaud, 28–35; Bonifacy, 20–1; de Lonlay, 503–12; Dreyfus, 117–20; Grisot and Coulombon, 459–60; Harmant, 175–80; Lecomte, Lang- Son, 337–49; Maury, 159–72; Nicolas, 380–3; Normand, 122–34, 135–41 and 169–74 General Brière de l'Isle and his staff. De Négrier (with hand on chest) and Herbinger (clasping cane in both hands) are in the front row The Chinese reinforced the Guangxi Army in March 1885, and on 22 March a detachment of Chinese troops from the command of Feng Zicai crossed into Tonkin and raided the French forward positions at Đồng Đăng. To discourage further incursions by the Chinese, de Négrier decided to pursue the raiders across the frontier with the bulk of the 2nd Brigade and attack the Chinese in their entrenched camp at Bang Bo near Zhennan Pass, hoping that the element of surprise would make up for his lack of numbers. On 23 March the French took the outworks of the Chinese camp at Bang Bo, but on 24 March 1885 further attacks on the Chinese miscarried, and de Négrier was forced to make a fighting retreat. The Battle of Bang Bo was the only defeat he suffered in his entire military career.Armengaud, 40–58; Bonifacy, 23–6; Harmant, 211–35; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 428–53 and 455; Maury, 185–203 The Guangxi Army cautiously pursued the French, and four days later launched a disastrous frontal attack on the defences of Lạng Sơn. The battle of Ky Lua, on 28 March 1885, was a walkover victory for the French, but de Négrier was shot in the chest and seriously wounded while scouting the Chinese positions in preparation for a French counterattack, and was forced to hand over command to Lieutenant-Colonel Paul Gustave Herbinger, one of his two regimental commanders. Herbinger, a theoretical soldier with little experience of command in the field, lost his head. More than a thousand Chinese corpses lay in front of the 2nd Brigade's positions, and the Chinese could be seen falling back in disorder towards the frontier, leaving only a small rearguard at Ky Lua to protect their retreat. Herbinger was unimpressed. Ignoring all the evidence that the Guangxi Army had been decisively defeated, and convinced that the 2nd Brigade would be encircled if it remained where it was, he took the controversial decision to abandon Lạng Sơn and fall back to stronger defensive positions at Kep and Chu. This misjudgement transformed de Négrier's tactical victory at Ky Lua into a strategic defeat.Armengaud, 61–7; Bonifacy, 27–9; de Lonlay, 529–32; Harmant, 237–52; Lecomte, Lang-Son, 463–74; Maury, 208–12; Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 111–12 ==Later career== De Négrier quickly recovered from his Ky Lua wound, and in May 1885, shortly after the end of the Sino-French War, was appointed to the command of the 2nd Division of the expanded Tonkin Expeditionary Corps. General Brière de l'Isle had been offered command of the 1st Division, and made it a condition of his acceptance that de Négrier got the 2nd Division. De Négrier was not at his best serving under General Roussel de Courcy. Instead of fighting set-piece battles against Chinese regular troops in which his tactical abilities had every opportunity to shine, he was required to conduct punitive sweeps against elusive Vietnamese guerilla concentrations. In December 1885 he swept the Bai Sai region near Hanoi with a column of 3,000 men. The sweep netted few guerillas, and French casualties from cholera in de Négrier's column were heavy. The exasperated French bayoneted any prisoners they took and de Négrier, a traditional soldier who found it difficult to adapt to the tactics of guerilla warfare, did nothing to stop them. The net result of this brutal campaign was probably to win more recruits and increase sympathy for the insurgents. De Négrier was attached to the Imperial Japanese Army as an official French observer during the Russo-Japanese War, and published an account of the war, Lessons from the Russo-Japanese War (London, 1905), immediately after its close. ==De Négrier's leadership== De Négrier was by far the most popular French commander in Tonkin during the Sino-French War. After the Bắc Ninh Campaign the soldiers of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps devised sardonic Vietnamese nicknames for General Charles-Théodore Millot and his two brigade commanders. De Négrier, admired for his driving energy, became Maolen (mau lên, 'Quick!'). Louis Brière de l'Isle, whose troops had been beaten to the punch at Bac Ninh by de Négrier's, was Mann Mann (màn màn, 'Slow!'). Millot, who had halted de Négrier's pursuit of the beaten Chinese army at Kep and, in the eyes of the soldiers, prevented him from going all the way to Lang Son, became Toi Toi (thôi thôi, 'Stop!').Thomazi, Conquête, 186 De Négrier had a way with words that endeared him to most French soldiers. His most famous mot was made in December 1883 in Algeria, during a review of the 2nd Battalion of the French Foreign Legion on the eve of its departure for Tonkin to take part in the Bắc Ninh Campaign: Vous, légionnaires, vous êtes soldats pour mourir, et je vous envoie où l’on meurt! ('Legionnaires, you became soldiers in order to die, and I'm taking you to a place where you can die!') De Négrier possessed to a high degree the quality known to the French as coup d'oeil, the ability to make an instant assessment of the battlefield and make the appropriate response. Sergeant Maury of the 2nd Legion Battalion witnessed de Négrier in action at the Battle of Pho Vy (10 February 1885), one of the many confused engagements against the Chinese during the Lạng Sơn Campaign: > Suddenly we stopped being spectators, and took a part in the action > ourselves. General de Négrier rode over to give some orders to de Saxcé's > battery, which we were still guarding, and called out to our captain, > 'Cotter, have you got your whole company up?' 'Sir.' He turned to the > battery captain. 'Your battery’s not in any danger, is it, de Saxcé?' 'Sir.' > 'Right! Cotter, take your company and capture that hill. Those damned > Chinese don't seem to want to be pushed off it.' Then he turned to us. > 'Let's go, lads! Chins up, forward march! Show them you don't use your > knives just to eat your rations!'Maury, 147 De Négrier had a hasty temper, but it was redeemed by a ready sense of humour, and his troops relished his occasional volcanic eruptions. Second Lieutenant René Normand of the 111th Line Battalion (killed in action a month later in the Battle of Bang Bo) recalled a typical incident during the Lạng Sơn Campaign in February 1885: > General de Négrier began to concentrate his brigade. The column was moving > forward slowly, in single file, and as he watched it he remarked to us, 'The > thing about warfare is that you have to learn to be patient.' No sooner were > the words out of his mouth than a cannon bogged down. He spurred towards the > wretched gun section. 'Oh, for God's sake! Keep the damned thing moving!' > Then he burst out laughing, and that set us all off.Normand, 108 ==NotesReferences== * Armengaud, Jean Louis, Lang-Son: journal des opérations qui ont précédé et suivi la prise de cette citadelle (R.

When an opportunity arose to buy the leasehold at Lord's, Dark was quick to seize it. The current Lord's Cricket Ground was opened by Thomas Lord in 1814, the ground sited on land that Lord leased from the Eyre Estate in St John's Wood. In 1825, Lord proposed building houses on the land as he was not receiving enough revenue from cricket. There was strong opposition to his idea and he sold his leasehold interest in the ground to William Ward for £5000.Warner, p.20. In 1835, Ward sold the leasehold to Dark who paid £2000 upfront and an annuity of £425 to the Ward family through the unexpired term of the lease from Michaelmas Day 1835 for 59 years (to 1894). The rental due to the Eyre Estate was £150 per annum. Dark lived close by the ground in a house which was \\"near the present (in 1945) members' luncheon room\\". Dark did much to improve Lord's. When he took over, there were two ponds on the land which frequently filled up with rubble and the playing area had a very rough surface.Warner, p.28. The ponds were eventually drained and filled in while ground maintenance relied to a large extent on sheep to keep the grass down and a small roller to even out the surface.Warner, p.31. Dark's development programme was ambitious for it included extension and improvement of the pavilion and the installation of gas lighting. He added a billiard room, a real tennis court, a running track and planted 400 trees. He struggled to improve the notoriously bad pitch and some of his extra attractions, such as pony racing and Red Indian encampments, cannot have helped the condition of the outfield. Dark brought his family into Lord's to help develop the business. His brother Ben established a bat-making business at the ground and their younger brother Robert sold a whole range of equipment including the new pads and gloves that players were beginning to prefer to Muscular Christianity. In 1860, there was a potential crisis at Lord's when the Eyre Estate decided to sell the freehold at public auction. Dark was among many who urged MCC to bid but, for any number of reasons including a lack of vision, they did not and the ground was bought by Isaac Moses, a property speculator, for £7000. Dark resigned the leasehold in 1864 and it was taken over by MCC. In 1866, using funds advanced by William Nicholson, MCC did buy the freehold from Moses for £18,333 6s 8d, which was not good business: they should have heeded James Dark. ==Character and personal life== The son of a saddler, Dark was connected with Lord's in some capacity for 59 years from 1805 to 1864 and it was said of him in Alfred D Taylor's Annals of Lord's and History of the MCC: \\"having, perhaps, done more for MCC than any other individual\\".Warner, p.67. During his period of proprietorship, the ground was often referred to in common parlance as Dark's. Known as \\"the Boss\\", Dark was described as \\"a somewhat taciturn, silent man, out of who information was not easily extracted\\". Dark died 17 October 1871 at St John's Wood, London at the age of 76 and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery where a red granite slab was erected with the inscription: \\"Sacred to the Memory of Mr James Henry Dark, who died October 17th 1871, aged 76. For many years Proprietor of Lord's Cricket Ground\\".Warner, p.68. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Arthur Haygarth (1862) Scores & Biographies, Volumes 1–3 (1744–1846), Lillywhite * Pelham Warner (1846) Lord's 1787 – 1945, Harrap, * Category:1795 births Category:1871 deaths Category:English cricketers Category:English cricketers of 1787 to 1825 Category:English cricketers of 1826 to 1863 Category:Middlesex cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:English cricket umpires Category:Players cricketers Category:Cricket patrons Category:Cambridge Town Club cricketers ","title":"James Dark"},{"id":"19243968","text":"Henry Yarburgh Everett (1791 – 7 May 1847) was a British amateur cricketer.

However, a mistake coming from the production meant that only Boris and Yossi faced the public's vote after Miki's nomination was miscalculated. Out of Boris and Yossi, Boris was evicted and interviewed by the show's hosts. Once the mistake was noticed he was put back into the house. The nominations were re-held on Day 7. * All housemates were automatically nominated for a special eviction on Day 28. * Originally Einav and Asher were not nominated for eviction, but they tried to deceive the Big Brother and send Tzabar and Shifra for nomination. The Big Brother exposed the fraud and replaced Tzabar and Shifra with Asher and Einav. * Big Brother gave Shay permission to attend his aunt's funeral for a few hours (outside the house) so he wasn't present for his eviction. * Inna, Hagit, Shachar and Yoni were immune from being nominated because they are new housemates. * Housemates nominated who they wanted to stay in the house and the three or more housemates with the MOST nominations were the only ones safe this Week. * All housemates automatically faced the public vote this week, and for the first time two housemates were evicted from the Big Brother house. * In week 14, any housemate who got at least one vote, was nominated for eviction. * There were no nominations in the final week and the public was voting for housemates to win, rather than be evicted. the housemate with the most SMS votes was the winner. ==External links== * Official website Category:2008 Israeli television seasons Category:Big Brother (Israeli TV series) seasons ","title":"Big Brother (Israeli season 1)"},{"id":"19244151","text":"Dr. Roland Philip Chaplain.

The process was developed in the 1980s by the Norwegian engineering firm Kværner, and was first commercially exploited in 1999. == Description == Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of carbon nanocones (maximum diameter ~1 μm) produced by pyrolysis of crude oil in the Kvaerner process. The endothermic reaction separates (i.e. decomposes) hydrocarbons into carbon and hydrogen in a plasma burner at around 1600 °C. The resulting components, carbon particles and hydrogen, are present as a mixture in form of an aerosol. :C_\\\\mathit{n}H_\\\\mathit{m} -> {\\\\mathit{n}C} + \\\\frac{\\\\mathit{m}}{2} H2 In comparison to other reformation methods such as steam reforming and partial oxidation the natural gas is efficiently and completely transformed into pure carbon and hydrogen. After separating the mixture, the carbon particles can be used for instance as activated carbon, graphite or industrial soot, special kinds of carbon such as carbon discs and carbon cones (see SEM image). The carbon is obtained as black powdery solid matter and forms a technical product which may be used e.g. as filler in the rubber industry as pigment soot for inks and paints or as raw material for electrical components. The hydrogen may be discharged for the chemical industry or may be used for generating electricity. Of the available energy of the feed, approximately 48% is contained in the hydrogen, 40% is contained in activated carbon and 10% in superheated steam.hfpeurope.org ==Plasma variation== A variation of this process using plasma arc waste disposal was presented in 2009.

King Olav V and Harald V of Norway, who then was crown prince, opened \\"Nordjamb '75\\", as it became popularly known, in the presence of 17,259 Scouts from 94 countries. The slogan was Five Fingers, One Hand, an example of international cooperation on the part of the five Nordic countries responsible for its organization. This slogan stood symbolically for: * Five fingers separately are small and weak, but together form an efficient and strong unit * Scouts from all five continents meet at the World Jamboree * The five Nordic countries jointly host a world event The slogan for the Jamboree was represented in a number of ways, including one event that brought all of the Jamboree participants together into the central arena, where they formed a giant hand that was photographed from aircraft flying overhead. The British contingent, led by Robert Baden-Powell, 3rd Baron Baden-Powell, included Scouts from Branches in Bermuda, Hong Kong and Rhodesia. The program of this Jamboree included excursions in the mountains by international patrols, activity areas, Nordic trail, choir, visit to Maihaugen cultural museum, and the Jamboree Country Fair. The relationships that developed were in large measure due to the warm hospitality given to almost every visiting Scout in the homes of the hosts. This Jamboree included in the program several activities involving modern technology, as well as traditional pursuits such as hiking, orienteering and camping. The Jamboree was also visited by Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden and Crown Prince Mohammed VI of Morocco. ==Campsite== The campground was located on shore of the river Lågen where it enters Lake Mjøsa.

She holds the title of Professor of Political Philosophy at the Università degli studi di Verona. She has also held visiting appointments at the University of California, Berkeley and Santa Barbara, at the New York University and Harvard. Cavarero is widely recognized in Italy, Europe and the English-speaking world for her writings on feminism and theories of sexual difference, on Plato, on Hannah Arendt, on theories of narration and on a wide range of issues in political philosophy and literature. == Biography == Cavarero was educated at the University of Padua, where she wrote a thesis on philosophy and poetry, in 1971, and spent the first years of her Academic career. In 1983 she left Padua for the University of Verona, where she was co- founder of Diotima – a group dedicated to feminist philosophy as political engagement. Trained in ancient philosophy – with a special focus on the writings of Plato – and inspired by feminist philosopher, Luce Irigaray, Cavarero first drew wide attention with her book, In Spite of Plato, which pursues two interwoven themes: it engages in a deconstruction of ancient philosophical texts, primarily of Plato, but also of Homer and Parmenides, in order to free four Greek female figures (a Thracian servant, Penelope, Demeter and Diotima) from the patriarchal discourse which for centuries had imprisoned them in a domestic role. Secondly, it attempts to construct a symbolic female order, reinterpreting these figures from a new perspective. By contaminating the theory of sexual difference with Arendtian issues, Cavarero shows that, while death is the central category on which the whole edifice of traditional philosophy has been based, the category of birth provides the thread with which new concepts of feminist criticism can be woven together to establish a fresh way of thinking. == Work == Cavarero's interest in the intersection of political philosophy and feminist thought was further developed in Stately Bodies which examines the bodily metaphor in political discourse and in fictional depictions of politics, including Sophocles' Antigone, Plato's Timaeus, Shakespeare's Hamlet, Hobbes' Leviathan, Maria Zambrano's The Tomb of Antigone and Ingeborg Bachmann's Undine Goes. The book explores: === Relating Narratives: Storytelling and Selfhood (2000) === Definitively influenced by the work of Hannah Arendt, Cavarero wrote Relating Narratives: Storytelling and Selfhood in which she developed an original theory of selfhood as a \\"narratable self\\". Appreciated and discussed by Judith Butler in Giving an Account of Oneself, this book, by contrasting the sovereign subject of the metaphysical tradition, confronts with the urge of rethinking politics and ethics in terms of a relational ontology, characterized by reciprocal exposure, dependence and vulnerability of an incarnated self who postulates the other as necessary. In fact, through readings of such diverse figures as Homer, Sophocles, The Arabian Nights, Isak Dinesen and Gertrude Stein, Relating Narratives presents a singular contribution to the intersection of narrative theory, ethics and political discourse.C.f. Paul A. Kottman, \\"Introduction\\" to Relating Narratives: Storytelling and Selfhood (Routledge, 2000). Cavarero claims that we perceive ourselves as narratable, as protagonists of a story that we long to hear from others. This desire for a story, for our story to be told, becomes the guiding element in the new approach to identity. Our identity is not possessed in advance, as an innate quality or inner self that we are able to master and express. It is rather the outcome of a relational practice, something given to us from another, in the form of a life-story, a biography. === For More Than One Voice: Toward a Philosophy of Vocal Expression (2005) === Cavarero's next book, For More Than One Voice: Toward a Philosophy of Vocal Expression, \\"re-think(s) the relation between speech and politics – announced in Aristotle's formula whereby man's nature as a political animal [zoon politikon] is bound up with man's characterization as that animal which has speech [zoon logon echon] – by focusing her attention on the embodied uniqueness of the speaker as it is manifested in that speaker's voice, addressed to another. In this way, she radically departs from more traditional conceptions of what constitutes 'political speech,' such as the signifying capacity of the speaker, the communicative capacity of discourse, or the semantic content of a given statement. As in her earlier work, Cavarero continues to develop and deepen a number of themes foregrounded by Hannah Arendt—who asserts in The Human Condition that what matters in speech is not signification or 'communication' but rather the fact that 'in acting and speaking, men show who they are, reveal actively their unique personal identities and thus make their appearance in the human world.'. Refining the radically phenomenological perspective that Arendt puts forth in her work, Cavarero locates the political sense of speech in the singularity of the speaker's voice, the acoustic emission that emits from mouth to ear. For Cavarero this politic emerges from 'the reciprocal communication of voices,' wherein what comes to the fore is above all the embodied singularity of the speakers in relation to others, no matter what they say.Paul A. Kottman, \\"Introduction,\\" For More Than One Voice (Stanford University Press, 2005). === Horrorism: Naming Contemporary Violence (2008) === In her book, Horrorism: Naming Contemporary Violence, Cavarero draws attention to various ways in which scenes of violence from the past century through the present (as well as what might be called ancient and early modern precursors to these scenes) cannot be adequately understood through the received categories of modern political philosophy -- 'terrorism,' 'war,' 'friend/enemy,' or 'state versus non-state sanctioned actions' -- and proposes a decisive shift in perspective. Taking note of the fact that, increasingly, we are dealing with victims who are almost all unarmed or defenseless – \\"inermi,\\" defenseless/helpless – she argues that it is precisely this helplessness and these particular helpless people whose conditions and circumstances ought to orient our thinking about scenes of violence, rather than the socio-political aims or psychoanalytical perspectives of the perpetrators. Cavarero proposes the name \\"horrorism\\" for those forms of violence that are \\"crimes\\" which \\"offend the human condition at its ontological level.\\" Pairing, unexpectedly, Hannah Arendt's notion of natality and Thomas Hobbes' description of maternal dominion as the power to \\"nourish or destroy,\\" Cavarero elaborates this ontology as one of \\"vulnerability\\" – a reciprocal exposure in which we are given over to either the other's care or harm, \\"almost as if the absence of harm or care were not even thinkable\\". She argues that it is precisely this alternative between care and doing harm – and not some \\"pure, gratuitous cruelty\\" – that is the \\"generative nucleus\\" of horror, precisely because this vulnerability is the condition of human life as it is given from birth to death. Horrorism is, so to speak, a radical rejection of care – a wound inflicted precisely where care was most needed. Therefore, the violence strikes more deeply at the \\"dignity\\" of the unique, bodily life that is harmed; or better, because horror is a form of violence that is made possible by the heightened vulnerability of helplessness, it also implicitly reveals this dignity. === Inclinations: A Critique of Rectitude (2016) === Adriana Cavarero’s Inclinations critiques the characterization of the human being as upright, erect—in philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropological writings, literature and artworks. Her aim is to illuminate \\"the effects of this figuration, the 'truths' and 'power-relations' that these discursive or artistic figurations produce and install…[and to tally] the costs of depicting the human being as upright when it comes to our view of women, our overall understanding and collective self-conception.\\"Paul A. Kottman, Series Editor Preface to Cavarero, Inclinations, translated by Amanda Minervini and Adam Sitze (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2016), vii. The figuration of the human being as 'upright,' Cavarero suggests, obscures a more natural figuration: Inclination. In this book, she hones a \\"rhetoric of inclination,\\" in order to superimpose it \\"like a transparent screen, over the rhetoric of the philosophical subject, to highlight the differences between the two ontological, ethical, and political models.\\"Paul A. Kottman, Series Editor Preface to Cavarero, Inclinations, translated by Amanda Minervini and Adam Sitze (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2016), 14. == Bibliography == * In Spite of Plato (1995) * Relating Narratives (2000) * Stately Bodies (2002) * For more than one voice Stanford University Press (2005) * Horrorism: naming contemporary violence Columbia University Press (2008) * Inclinations: A Critique of Rectitude Stanford University Press (2016) == References == Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bra, Piedmont Category:University of Padua alumni Category:University of Padua faculty Category:University of Verona faculty Category:New York University faculty Category:University of California, Santa Barbara faculty Category:University of California, Berkeley faculty Category:Harvard University staff Category:20th-century Italian philosophers Category:Italian feminists Category:Italian political philosophers Category:American women academics Category:Italian women academics Category:20th-century Italian women writers ","title":"Adriana Cavarero"},{"id":"19244277","text":"Desautels is a surname.

As Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg uses these approaches in research particularly in the fields of sexology, homophobia, and prejudice studies, the US Society of Lesbian and Gay Anthropologists (SOLGA; formerly Anthropology Research Group on Homosexuality, ARGOH)Society of Lesbian and Gay Anthropologists Homepage of the American Anthropological Association ranked Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's works on homophobia as internationally outstanding.Society of Lesbian and Gay Anthropologists Newsletter, October 1991, Vol. 13, No. 3: pp. 43–75 == Biography == Bleibtreu- Ehrenberg studied sociology, psychology, ethnology, religious studies, philosophy and Indogermanistik (an interdisciplinarian German subject, not identical with purely linguistic Indo-European studies in Anglophone countries, consisting of historical, sociological, cultural, religious, ethnological, philological, and linguistic study relating to Proto-Indo- European and Indo-European peoples and Indo-European languages) in Bonn.Biographical and bibliographical notes on the inside dust jacket of Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's book Tabu Homosexualität (1st ed.), on page 2 of her book Angst und Vorurteil, and on page 2 of her book Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt. In 1969, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg graduated at the University of Bonn, receiving her Magister artium (comparable to a Master's degree in the Anglo- American educational system) for her thesis Homosexualität und Transvestition im Schamanismus (\\"Homosexuality and transvestition in shamanism\\"). In 1970, she received her PhD for her doctoral dissertation on Sexuelle Abartigkeit im Urteil der abendländischen Religions-, Geistes-, und Rechtsgeschichte im Zusammenhang mit der Gesellschaftsentwicklung (\\"The religious, philosophical, and legal construction of sexual deviance in interdependence with the development of Western society\\"). After university studies Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg became a scientific assistant at the Sociological Institute of Bonn University, and worked as a sociologist, writer, and independent journalist, holding memberships in a number of scientific and political organizations. She was a leading member of German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research. During the late 1980s, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg was a member of the German-parliament commissioned Enquetekommission AIDS, an inquiry commission researching into the disease's social, legal, and public health care consequences and challenges, a cooperation which spawned her 1989 book Angst und Vorurteil (see below). Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg is married and lives in Germany. == Fields of interest & influences  \\"Ethno-sociologist\\" === A label commonly applied to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg is that of an \\"ethno- sociologist\\", even though that is not to limit her approaches exclusively to non-Western cultures. Her inclusion of ethnological, cross-cultural approaches serves as one device of many that she uses to globally study and analyze mankind's nature and nurture as well as the differences and interdependencies between the two, aiming for a global perspective also applicable in modern industrialized societies. === Fields of interest === Following the ideology- critical and identity-critical approach of Frankfurt School's Critical Theory, the emphasis of Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's mostly post-structural and deconstructionist work (see social constructionism and social constructivism) on socio-psychological prejudice studies lies on the socio-cultural, socio- historical, and socio-psychological research into issues such as Western repression of sensuality (Leibfeindlichkeit) in Indo-European cultures, and extends into research on topics such as deviant sexuality, homophobia, misogyny, gender roles, and patriarchy. === Deconstructivism & essentialism === Most of Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's research is dedicated to cultural deconstruction of ethnocentric Western prejudices, analyzing their origins and later derivations in history, and emphasizes that this cultural nurture also determining social identities must not be misunderstood as man's essentialist human nature. According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, positivist misinterpretation of ethnocentric prejudices as human nature is one of the key maladies of Western civilization, known to Critical Theory as society's totality also influencing much of Western scientific output. For instance, gays were throughout most of Western history said to be effeminate by their nature, while this common stereotype also influenced social identities and behaviors of individual homosexuals, and these resulting identities and behaviors were in turn taken by society as justifying evidence for their prejudice. Only two of her works, Mannbarkeitsriten (1980) and Der pädophile Impuls (1985/88) deal with anthropological research into the essential cross-cultural and cross- species nature of two particular sexual attractions beyond common Western stereotypes, paederasty (which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg defines as \\"male same-sex paedophilia\\"Preface to the German edition (1986) of Theo Sandfort's Dutch study published in English as The sexual aspect of paedosexual relations: The experience of 25 boys with men (1981, 1st reprint 1983, 2nd reprint 1987)) in Mannbarkeitsriten, and paedophilia (defined as \\"sexual contact between fertile adults and infertile juveniles\\" based upon preference for these activities on behalf of the adult side, rather than situational offencesDer pädophile Impuls – Wie lernt ein junger Mensch Sexualität?. (1985/88)) in general in Der pädophile Impuls. === Influences === In her publications on prejudice studies, both general and specifically sexual deviance-related, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg incorporates influences of Critical Theory (especially the theory of Authoritarian personality, also see Right-wing authoritarianism), Labeling theory by George Herbert Mead and Howard S. Becker, Social identity theory by Henri Tajfel and John Turner, Frustration-Aggression hypothesis by John Dollard and Neal E. Miller, Social learning theory by Albert Bandura, dispositif and discourse analysis by Michel Foucault, and the concept of derivation in the sociological sense of the term by Vilfredo Pareto, denoting an irrational, ideological after-the-fact rationalization. Other notable influences include Sigmund Freud, Mircea Eliade, Marija Gimbutas (though only acknowledged by Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg as a summary source for a century of scholarly Central European and Scandinavian Indogermanistik publications prior to Gimbutas), the concepts of magical thinking by James George Frazer and of the numinous by Rudolf Otto. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's definition of prejudice is largely identical to Theodor W. Adorno's Verblendungszusammenhang, by which Adorno denotes socially constructed \\"delusions\\" (Verblendungen) based upon traditional socio-cultural and socio-psychological conditions or relations (Verhältnisse) within Western society, but also takes influence from Foucault's dispositif or apparatus, whereas according to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, traditional ethnocentric prejudices easily adapt to social paradigm shifts throughout history in order to update their rationalizations according to dominant epistemes, with new derivations of the same old prejudices as the result. For example, during the Medieval Age, according to Benedictus Levita, Thomas Aquinas, and the Malleus Maleficarum, same-sex activities were abhorred as the most deadliest sin of all, which was superbia, i. e. the very pride to consider oneself above God and disobey His will as manifested in His most sacred commandments such as that sodomia (see sodomy), the common Medieval term for these activities, was considered identical to satanism and evil witchcraft, whereas when with the scientific revolution of Early Modernity the responsibility of priests towards sinners increasingly transformed into one of doctors and judges toward those now considered criminally insane, the rationale to keep the ban upon the very same activities along with the ostracization of those who committed such unspeakable \\"abominations\\" changed to emphasizing the alleged counter-naturality or perversion of their acts and pathologizing those who desired such. Combining her influences, Bleibtreu- Ehrenberg's synthetized definition of ethnocentric, inherently Authoritarian prejudice is one of socially learned manifest, recurring intrusive thoughts (Zwangsvorstellungen) that may spill over into Allport's Scale discrimination, including violent hate crimes, as a form of obsessive-compulsive behavior (Zwangshandlung; also see Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder). Due to what Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg terms \\"distorted perception\\" (verzerrte Wahrnehmung, resembling Bob Altemeyer's compartmentalized thinking) of constructed social reality, the prejudiced aggressor regards themselves as a rectifying, maybe curing agent, as an upholder of \\"natural order\\" and \\"society\\", and/or as protector of people they perceive as \\"victims\\" of the discriminated. == Main works  Overview === Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's main works consist of the following publications: * 1978 (reprinted 1981): Tabu Homosexualität – Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils (\\"The taboo of homosexuality: The history of a prejudice\\"), * 1980 (reprinted 1985): Mannbarkeitsriten: Zur institutionellen Päderastie bei Papuas und Melanesiern (\\"Rites of passage into manhood: On institutional paederasty in Papuas and Melanesians\\"), * 1984: Der Weibmann – Kultischer Geschlechtswechsel im Schamanismus, eine Studie zur Transvestition und Transsexualität bei Naturvölkern (\\"Androgynous: Cultic sex change in shamanism, a study on transvestism and transsexualism in primitives\\"; enlarged version of Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's 1969 MA thesis) * 1985: Der pädophile Impuls – Wie lernt ein junger Mensch Sexualität?

Lesbian and Gay Religious History, on Fordham University, the Jesuit University of New York As of 2008, it is found in a number of Western European libraries, and in the US is even available in libraries in 13 different states.Entry on Tabu Homosexualtät (both editions) on Worldcat.org (any US state must be entered first in order to get results for availability of the book in the particular state's libraries) According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's socio-psychological, socio-historical interdisciplinary approach to the topic of homophobia, drawing from research fields such as cultural studies, religious studies, ethnology, philology, and linguistics, the ethnocentric prejudice towards particularly male same-sex attraction and activities in the history of Western, Indo-European cultures is intrinsically identical to misogyny, thus originally gave rise to, and until the modern age maintained, patriarchal structures of Indo-European society. Its roots and cultural elements can be traced back several millennia into Eurasian culture, and were originally based on the subsequent overlapping and conflict-ridden superimposition of the three basic ethnic and cultural strata (see stratification, social stratification, and archaeological horizon) underlying all modern Indo-European cultures. From there, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg traces the genesis of homophobia via a number of historical derivations in Indo-European societies until the 20th century. === Angst und Vorurteil (1989) === The book Angst und Vorurteil – AIDS-Ängste als Gegenstand der Vorurteilsforschung was based on the work of the parliamentary inquiry commission Enquetekommission AIDS, of which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg was a member, that was formed in order to research into the disease's social, cultural, legal, and public health care consequences and challenges, as well as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's own final report brought forth in parliamentary hearings and towards the Helmut Kohl administration. In Angst und Vorurteil, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg on the one hand supplements the structural history of Western Leibfeindlichkeit (repression of sensuality) she related at a fuller scope in Tabu Homosexualität before, by pointing out in Angst und Vorurteil further aspects she had already brushed on in Der pädophile Impuls four years earlier. On the other hand, in Angst und Vorurteil Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg gives a thorough, comprehensive description of post-WWII scientific prejudice studies, particularly regarding the re- inforcement of traditional Western Leibfeindlichkeit (prejudices directed against factual or putative sexual deviance) triggered by HIV, and chronicles the field's academic history from its roots. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's understanding of prejudice largely builds on Critical Theory and its concept of the Authoritarian personality, but also incorporates, among other schools of prejudice studies, Labeling theory, Social identity theory, Frustration- Aggression hypothesis, Social learning theory, and Foucault's dispositif and discourse analysis. == Prizes and honors == * Rosa Courage Prize, Osnabrück, awarded by the board of the annual cultural LGBT event Gay in May == Works, In German == * Homosexualität und Transvestition im Schamanismus. in: Anthropos, no. 65 * Tabu Homosexualität – Die Geschichte eines Vorurteils.

The park was opened to the public as a zoo in 1973. The park is Patna's most frequented picnic spot, with more than 36,000 visitors on New Year's Day alone in 2011. ==History== The park was first established as a botanical garden in 1969. The then Governor of Bihar, Sri Nityanand Kanungo, provided almost of land from the Governor House campus for the garden. In 1972, Public Works added to this, and the Revenue Department transferred to the Forest Department to help expand the park. Since 1973, this park has been a biological park, combining a botanical garden with a zoo. The land acquired from the Public Works Department and the Revenue Department was declared protected forest by the state government on 8 March 1983.

Having started as a botanical garden, the park currently houses more than 300 species of trees, herbs and shrubs. Plant exhibits include a nursery for medicinal plants, an orchid house, a fern house, a glass house, and a rose garden. The park also includes an aquarium which is the largest revenue generator after the general admission fee. The aquarium has about 35 species of fish, and the snake house has 32 snakes belonging to 5 species. alt= ==Conservation and births== The Patna Zoo makes considerable effort to conserve and propagate endangered species from around the world. Breeding captive wild animals is a difficult challenge that the zoo has met with some notable success. ===Success=== * The great one-horned rhinoceros has been bred successfully several times in the past. In 2008, Patna Zoo earned acclaim for its breeding techniques. * A hippopotamus has given birth for the first time at the zoo to a male hippo on 19 April 2001. There have been several other hippo births since, including in 2007. * A leopard gave birth to two cubs on 18 June 2001, after a gap of 16 years since the last birth. * An alligator has bred for the first time in the zoo on 29 June 2001 and after that several time in past.The number of ghariyals or alligators here have gone up from 13 to 129 in the last five years. * A porcupine bred for the first time in the zoo on 12 June 2001 and gave birth to two baby porcupines.One Horned Rhino in Water Puddle during Summer at Patna Zoo ===Initiative=== * The zoo received a white tiger in the first week of March from Nandan Kanan Zoo, Bhubaneshwar. This has improved the chances of breeding the tiger in the zoo. * There is a single male zebra in the zoo. It is expected that a female zebra will arrive in the zoo if the Central Zoo Authority approves the proposal. ===Birds=== This place provides a good sighting for birders.

Rider Jane's airport equipment fifth edition, Jane's Pub. Co., 1986 page 92 used as an aircraft warning light. ==Description== High voltage power cables, particularly those close to airports, need to be visible day and night. During the day, brightly coloured balls positioned along the length of the cables are sufficient, but during the night, lighting is necessary. These beacons provide this lighting by glowing red, the standard colour used in aviation for warning beacons. The system is extremely simple, efficient and reliable and is considered the most economically viable solution. Its working principle is attractive because it uses a phenomenon usually considered as a weakness. However a large disadvantage is that it does not work when the line is switched off. It cannot also be used on HVDC powerlines, but similar devices may be also used on mast radiators. ==Operating principle== The interest of the system lies in the way it obtains a power supply directly from the single cable on which it is mounted. It is difficult to obtain a very small amount of energy from a line which transports an enormous amount. System diagram Each high voltage cable creates an electric field around itself, in the same way as any live electrical conductor. When the electric potential of such a cable is sufficiently high, its electric field causes a significant voltage difference between the cable and its immediate neighbour. (It is the strength of the electric field that makes it difficult use low powers.) As a result, a second conductor a few metres long, insulated from but parallel to the high voltage cable, will have a potential different from that of the main cable. Together the conductors make a capacitor charged across an air gap (dielectric). Under certain conditions, the accumulated charge (and hence the potential difference) is sufficient to trigger a discharge lamp. This what is used in practice, giving a reliable and robust beacon. ==See also== * Aircraft warning paint * Overhead wire marker * Rogowski coil, a device that gets energy from the magnetic field, instead of the electric field ==References * On the manufacturer's site : Obsta **Presentation **Product Range Category:Aviation safety Category:Electric power transmission systems Category:Signalling lights Category:Warning systems ","title":"Balisor"},{"id":"19244351","text":"Incurvaria masculella, the feathered diamond-back, is a moth of the family Incurvariidae.

It was the final game of the 1992 college football season and served as the first ever National Championship game selected by the Bowl Coalition, predecessor to the Bowl Alliance and later the Bowl Championship Series. The game featured two unbeaten teams in the Alabama Crimson Tide and the Miami Hurricanes. ==TeamsMiami Hurricanes=== Miami, out of the Big East conference, was led by Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Gino Torretta, and was playing for back-to-back undefeated seasons and consecutive National Championships. ===Alabama Crimson Tide=== Alabama also entered the matchup undefeated, following their 28–21 victory over the Florida Gators in the inaugural SEC Championship Game. ==Game summary== This was the inaugural season of the Bowl Coalition, which was intended to ensure that the national championship would be decided on the field. Its formula worked perfectly, as it forced the first bowl matchup between the consensus #1 and #2 teams in the nation since the end of the 1987 season. As Big East champion, #1 Miami was free to choose a bowl. It opted to face #2 Alabama in the Sugar Bowl, which the Crimson Tide hosted as SEC champion. Miami was heavily favored, and came into the game on a 29-game winning streak; the Hurricanes hadn't lost since a 29-0 rout at the hands of Notre Dame in 1990. Alabama's defense held the Hurricanes to just 13 points, while intercepting Torretta three times, en route to a consensus National Championship. Alabama rushed for 267 yards—67 more yards than the Hurricanes had allowed all season. At one point, the Tide lined up all eleven players on the line of scrimmage. The confused Torretta was picked off by George Teague, who returned it for a touchdown. A legendary play in Alabama football lore, known as \\"The Strip\\", occurred when Miami wide receiver Lamar Thomas caught a deep pass from Torretta and was sprinting for what seemed like an 89-yard touchdown. However, Teague caught Thomas from behind, stripped the ball from him, and started running the other way before being tackled. The play became famous following Thomas's pre-game comments regarding the SEC, the superiority of the Miami receiving corps, and the manhood of the Alabama defensive backs. While the play was negated by an Alabama offside penalty, it still ultimately prevented a Miami touchdown, as Miami would have simply declined the penalty had the strip not taken place. Torretta threw three interceptions after only throwing seven in the entire season. It drew parallels to Vinny Testaverde's five- interception performance in the 1987 Fiesta Bowl. Following the poor performance, some reporters began to question whether Torretta deserved the Heisman. === Scoring summary === {  ! rowspan=2Quarter ! rowspan=2Time ! rowspan=2Team ! rowspan=2Scoring Information ! colspan=2Score - !

It is a tent caterpillar. The Western Tent Caterpillar is found in southern Canada, the western United States, and parts of northern Mexico. There are currently six recognized subspecies of M. californicum. Western tent caterpillars are gregarious and will spend a large portion of their time with other caterpillars in silken tents constructed during their larval stage. Western tent caterpillars are univoltine, going through a single generation per year. Adults emerge in the late summer to copulate and lay eggs. Adult moths will preferentially lay their eggs on the sunny side of their host trees. Eggs will lay in diapause over the winter and hatch the following spring. Population sizes of western tent caterpillar can reach outbreak proportions, where populations reach very high numbers and large scale defoliation occurs. Severe outbreaks can cause defoliation of host trees however, damage to trees is minimal and most trees will grow their leaves back quickly. ==Description== The mature Western Tent caterpillar pre-pupa is 4-5 centimeters long. The caterpillars are black, grey, or white with an orange stripe running longitudinally across the body. There are blue-white lines on each segment with dispersed setae extruding from the body. Pupae are 2-2.5 centimeters and reddish-brown to black in colour. Pupae spin a white silken cocoon, powdered in white and yellow. Adults have wingspan between 3.5-5 centimeters. Moths are brown, yellow, tan or grey, with two lighter or darker lines crossing the body. ==BiologyDiet=== Western tent caterpillar larvae are generalist herbivores, feeding on leaves. However, diet preference is heavily dependent on geographical location. The tree in which a female deposits the eggs is where the larvae will choose to feed. The most common host plants that caterpillars feed on are leaves from stonefruit trees. However, larvae will feed on many other types of tree foliage. Adult moths do not eat and live for 1–4 days. ===Thermoregulation=== Western tent caterpillars are ectothermic, therefore they do not produce their own body heat and are heavily influenced by environmental temperatures. Larvae are thought to thermoregulate by basking in the sun and staying in close groups to elevate body temperature. Increasing body temperature helps accelerate development time of caterpillars. ===Behaviour=== Early instar caterpillars are gregarious and remain as a family in silken tents. Aggregations of caterpillars are to discourage predation, increase temperature, and forage for food. During late instars caterpillars get larger and require more food resulting in a solitary behaviour. Caterpillars feed independently, and do not use tents for shelter. ===Reproduction=== Moths will mate in mid-summer. Male- male competition will ensue for females. Females are polyandrous and lay a clutch of eggs sired by multiple males. A single band of eggs is laid around the circumference of the branch. A single egg band can contain hundreds of eggs. Female M. californicum with egg mass ==Nucleopolyhedrovirus== Nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) is a virus that affects insects, mainly butterflies and moths. NPV has shown to decrease fitness and cause death. The body of larvae that die from NPV become thin and liquidy. Increased temperatures has shown to increase the prevalence of this virus. NPV can be transferred from parent to offspring or from individuals that come into physical contact. Additionally, caterpillars can contract NPV by coming in contact with silk strands from other larvae. NPV infections does not always kill the caterpillar and survival is much more likely in late instar caterpillar. NPV infected caterpillars have reduced fecundity. ==Outbreaks== Outbreaks are caused when population sizes of larvae reach their highest levels. Population outbreaks of western tent caterpillar occur in cycles every 6–11 years. Severe outbreaks can cause defoliation of host trees however, most trees will grow their leaves back quickly. Outbreaks of western tent caterpillar can cause large scale defoliation of trees. The caterpillars are considered by many to be a problem when they reach outbreak population sizes. However, outbreaks of larvae are considered to be more of a nuisance than a problem and does not negatively affect forest health because trees are able to regrow leaves quickly. Human suppression of western tent caterpillars is most successful when intervening before high population numbers are reached. The exact cause of population outbreaks is not truly understood, but a combination of many factors are believed to play a role in population fluctuations such as weather, predators, and virus. However, NPV is believed to play the largest role in the boom-and- bust of population outbreak cycles. Outbreaks of NPV Epizootic disease play significant roles in controlling population sizes of western tent caterpillars As populations of western tent caterpillar increase the prevalence of the disease increases and causes the subsequent crash of a population. ==Phenology== Western tent caterpillars have strong ecological interactions with their host plants. The time of caterpillar egg-hatch is closely timed with host plant bud-burst to ensure that early instar larvae are able to feed on leaves. However, caterpillars can hatch up to two weeks before or after tree's buds have burst. Due to effects of climate change it is predicted that there will be a phenological asynchrony between host tree and the western tent caterpillar, characterized by advancing larval emergence. This doesn't appear to have significant effects on caterpillar larvae fitness because larvae are resistant to starvation. ==Subspecies== *Malacosoma californicum ambisimile (Dyar, 1893) *Malacosoma californicum californicum *Malacosoma californicum fragile (Stretch, 1881) *Malacosoma californicum lutescens (Neumoegen & Dyar, 1893) *Malacosoma californicum pluvialis (Dyar, 1893) *Malacosoma californicum recenseo Dyar, 1928 ==External links== *Bugguide.net page on M. californicum *iNaturalist.org page on M. californicum *Youtube video of M. californicum larvae near Saint Mary Lake in the East Kootenays of British Columbia ==References== Category:Malacosoma Category:Moths of North America Category:Fauna of the California chaparral and woodlands Category:Moths of Canada Category:Taxa named by Alpheus Spring Packard Category:Moths described in 1864 ","title":"Malacosoma californicum"},{"id":"19244479","text":"The University of Traditional Medicine, Mandalay (UTM), in Aungmyethazan, Mandalay, is a public university of Burmese traditional medicine.

He played in five of the ten tour matches including the September 1921 fixture against a New Zealand XV which is now regarded as a Test match. With no Queensland Rugby Union administration or competition in place from 1919 to 1929, the New South Wales Waratahs were the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period and a number of the fixtures of 1920s which were played against full international opposition were decreed by the Australian Rugby Union in 1986 as official Test matches. In 1922 Wallace won a Rhodes scholarship to Oxford where he won University \\"blues\\" in 1922, 1923, 1924, and 1925. ==Scotland representative== While at Oxford, he represented Scotland in nine Tests between 1923 and 1926. He made his Scots national debut in a Five Nations fixture in January 1923 against France. He played against all of the Home Nations while representing for Scotland. making his last appearance in January 1926 at Stade Colombes also against France. As a player, he was at home anywhere in the three-quarters. He had a good turn of speed with a great outside break and was a magnificent finisher. ==Australian representative== Duke of York at Twickenham, 7 Jan 1928 On his return to Australia in 1926 he joined the Glebe-Balmain RUFC and in July of that year was selected for two Waratahs matches against the All Blacks. Prior to the start of the Australian 1927 season an invitation from the International Rugby Board arrived in Sydney requesting a New South Wales side tour Great Britain to play Tests against the Home Nations. A squad of twenty-nine players was selected comprising twenty-eight New South Welshmen and one Queenslander in Tom Lawton, Snr who had come to Sydney to continue his career. Wallace was selected as captain for nine month 1927-28 Waratahs tour of Britain, France and Canada. The selection of Wallace as captain is referred to in the Howell reference as \\"a masterstoke\\".Howell Wallaby Test Captains p92 He was well known in Britain through his Oxford and Scotland association, was an experienced and naturally gifted player, a strong tactician and a great influence on the younger players. On the nine-month tour, the Australians won 24, lost 5 and drew 2 of the matches they played and returned having established an international reputation for playing fair and attacking rugby. Howell quotes a speech given by Wallace at the tour's conclusion Every man went into the game wholeheartedly and did his utmost. Australia should be especially proud of the team considering that the Waratahs were picked from nine clubs, while England has 40,000 players to draw from.Howell Wallaby Test Captains p93 ==Post-playing== After 1928 Wallace opted out of representative rugby but played at club level till 1930 and acted as a selector and coach for New South Wales and Australia for a number of years. He toured as assistant manager-coach with a number of Wallaby sides and coached a Waratah team to a surprise victory over the Springboks at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1937.

The lottery is regulated by the National Lottery Commission, and was established in 2000. Lottery tickets may be bought only by people of at least 18 years of age. In the 2007 fiscal year transaction values totalled R3.972 billion, with an average of five million transactions per week. In the 2012 National lottery generated R4.7 billion in sales of Lotto and Powerball tickets. Lotto is the most popular type of gambling in South Africa but Powerball has been the faster-growing for last years due to its high payouts. ==History== The National lottery was introduced to South Africa on 11 March 2000. At the time it was run by Uthingo. After a marketing effort that aimed to reach 80 percent of South African homes directly more than 800,000 tickets were sold in the first day of availability Nearly R70 million worth of tickets were sold in the first three weeks of operation. In October 2002 operator Uthingo suggested a daily lottery to supplement the weekly draw. The concept, called Keno, was rejected by the trade and industry ministry in March 2003. In November 2003 the Lotto Plus game was launched, acting as a supplementary weekly lottery available on the purchase of a primary lottery ticket, with an entry fee of R1. In July 2006 the Gidani consortium, featuring Greek company Intralot as a technical partner, was judged the preferred bidder to operate the lottery for seven years starting April 2007. The operating licence was awarded in October 2006. In March 2007 the Pretoria High Court set aside that award on application by incumbent Uthingo, finding that the failure to adequately investigate the shareholders in some bidding consortia left room for conflicts of interest. Following the final draw by incumbent Uthingo, the lottery was indefinitely suspended in April 2007. In September the operating licence was awarded to Gidani again. When ticket sales re-opened in October more than 200,000 tickets were sold within the first three hours. Gidani introduced scratch cards, but they were discontinued for several months when they lost their licence to Ithuba. In 2015, Lotto licences were awarded to ITHUBA. In 2015, 2 new games were introduced by Ithuba: EAZiWIN, an instant win game consisting of four types of indigenous inspired games; Morabaraba, Fafi Fortune, 4 Siya Wina and Popa Feela and PowerBall Plus. ==Eligibility== * Players must be 18 years or older * Tickets may be bought in person at approved retailers, handheld partners and participating banks in South Africa. * Online purchase of tickets are only available to people who have an ABSA, FNB, Nedbank and Standard Bank account or have registered on the South African National Lottery website and are residents of South Africa with a South African ID. ==Games== 8 games operate under the South African National Lottery brand: ===Current games=== The National Lottery Has A Variety of Games To Play and Win Money and The Curent Games Are: ===LOTTO=== {  style=\\"font-size:96%; float:right;\\" +LOTTO and LOTTO PLUS odds ! style=\\"width:100px;\\"  Match ! style=\\"width:100px;\\"  Odds of winning !% of total winning pool - 2 and bonus1 : 96 Lotto R20.00, Lotto Plus R15 -- 31 : 72 Lotto R50.00, Lotto Plus R25 - 3 and bonus1 : 1028 7.3% - 41 : 1,371 8.4% - 4 and bonus1 : 30,161 5.0% - 51 : 75,402 4.0% - 5 and bonus 1 : 3,393,087 2.3% - All 6 1 : 20,358,520 73.0% } Lotto and Lotto Plus coupon 2015 - present Players buy tickets with their choice of six different numbers between 1 and 52; there is provision for random numbers to be generated automatically for those who do not wish to choose, known as 'Quick Pick'.

It was also reported that legalised gambling had created 50 673 jobs in 2000, although it may have redirected spendings from other industries. 2006 research found that 82 percent of South Africans played the lottery once a week and that 53 percent of the population did not engage in any other form of gambling. The average player spent R81 per month on the lottery. ==Revenue distribution== Under the current operator, Ithuba, 34 percent of revenue is paid to a central charitable distribution fund, up from an initial 28 percent. Six percent of revenue is paid as retail commission, ten percent is retained as operational costs and 48 percent is paid in prizes. === Controversy === In 2020 it was reported by GroundUp that people close to senior executives of the National Lottery, including its chairperson Alfred Nevhutanda, had improperly benefited from the charitable distribution fund. The National Lottery responded by initiating criminal charges against the news organisation and a journalist if the stories were not retracted which the National Lottery lost. The stories of corruption and improper benefit resulted in a government investigation of the National Lottery. ==Previous lotteries in South Africa== The now defunct homeland of Ciskei established a lottery in 1984 and operated by Score-A-Lot. In 1991 Score-A-Lot was the first Lottery in Africa to operate Video Lottery Terminals (VLT) in Africa and the first totally cashless operation using smart card technology.

McQuillan (born 23 February 1949 in New York City) is an American computer scientist who did studies of adaptive routing in the early ARPANET and the subsequent Internet. After receiving his A.B. in 1970 and a M.S. in 1971, he completed a Ph.D. in 1974 in applied mathematics from Harvard University. He was since 1971 employed at the computer networking equipment manufacturer Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Cambridge, MA, where he programmed the Interface Message Processor, work that in part led to his dissertation Adaptive routing for distributed computer networks advised by Jeffrey P. Buzen in 1974. In his dissertation, McQuillan developed ways to reroute messages around faulty and congested areas in the Internet based on delay feedback. These mechanisms were used in the first link-state routing protocols from 1978. In addition to publishing scientific journal articles, mainly in the IEEE journals, he also edited the two early introductions to networking, Understanding the new local network technologies (BBN, 1978) and A practical view of computer communications protocols (IEEE, 1978). He started McQuillan Consulting in Concord, MA (1982), became a columnist to Business Communications Review as well as an annual organizer of the Next Generation Network (NGN) conferences. He became partner in International Venture Partner (1996).Today, he is the director of McQuillan Ventures, that invests in network infrastructure companies.\\"John McQuillan Joins IVP As Venture Partner; Pioneer in Advanced Networks Adds Strength in Internet, High Performance Networking and Bandwidth to the Home as Areas of Investment Opportunities.\\" Business Wire, 30 July 1996, p. 7300063.

Each WDR provides in-depth analysis of a specific aspect of economic development. Past reports have considered such topics as agriculture, youth, equity, public services delivery, the role of the state, transition economies, labour, infrastructure, health, the environment, risk management, and poverty. The reports are the Bank's best-known contribution to thinking about development.World Bank: World Development Reports, accessed 21 March 2011. ==The World Development Report 2019== The World Development Report 2019 studies the impact of technology on the nature of work. It is the most- downloaded World Development Report, with more than a million downloads, half of which before its official publication. The study was led by Simeon Djankov and Federica Saliola. ==The World Development Report 2014== The World Development Report 2014 Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development looked at risk management from a development perspective. It argued that managing risks such as job loss, crime, disease, disaster, social unrest, and financial and macroeconomic turbulence responsibly can save lives, avert damages, prevent development setbacks, and unleash opportunities. The report proposed a conceptual framework for thinking about risk and resilience, identified obstacles to better risk management, and recommended numerous avenues for better risk management that can be pursued by individuals, families, communities, enterprises, governments, and the international community.World Bank: World Development Reports, accessed 29 October 2013. ==The World Development Report 2011== The World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security, and Development looked at conflict as a challenge to economic development. It analyzed the nature, causes and development consequences of modern violence and highlight lessons learned from efforts to prevent or recover from violence. The goal of this WDR was considered to promote new ways of preventing or addressing violent conflict. By drawing on insight and experiences from a host of past and present situations, the report identified promising national and regional initiatives as well as directions for change in international responses, and discuss how lessons can be applied in situations of vulnerability to violent conflict.World Bank: The World Development Report 2011: Conflict, Security, and Development, accessed 21 March 2011. The World Development Report is published by the World Bank. ==Previous reports 2008-2010== The WDR 2010, on the theme \\"Development and Climate Change\\", explored how public policy can change to better help people cope with new or worsened risks, how land and water management must adapt to better protect a threatened natural environment while feeding an expanding and more prosperous population, and how energy systems will need to be transformed. The report was seen as a call for action, both for developing countries who are striving to ensure policies are adapted to the realities and dangers of a hotter planet, and for high-income countries who need to undertake ambitious mitigation while supporting developing countries' efforts. The WDR 2009 focused on the theme \\"Reshaping Economic Geography\\".World Bank: World Development Report 2009 Rising densities of human settlements, migration and transport to reduce distances to market, and specialization and trade facilitated by fewer international divisions are central to economic development. The transformations along these three dimensions—density, distance, and division—are most noticeable in North America, Western Europe, and Japan, but countries in Asia and Eastern Europe are changing in ways similar in scope and speed. The report concludes that these spatial transformations are essential, and should be encouraged. The conclusion is not without controversy. Slum-dwellers now number a billion, but the rush to cities continues. Globalization is believed to benefit many, but not the billion people living in lagging areas of developing nations. High poverty and mortality persist among the world's \\"bottom billion\\", while others grow wealthier and live longer lives. Concern for these three billion often comes with the prescription that growth must be made spatially balanced. The WDR has a different message: economic growth is seldom balanced, and efforts to spread it out prematurely will jeopardize progress. The WDR 2008 addressed \\"Agriculture for Development\\", calling for greater investment in agriculture in developing countries. The report warned that the sector must be placed at the center of the development agenda if the goals of halving extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 are to be realized.World Bank: World Development Report 2008: Agriculture for Development While 75 percent of the world's poor live in rural areas in developing countries, a mere 4 percent of official development assistance goes to agriculture. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a region heavily reliant on agriculture for overall growth, public spending for farming is also only 4 percent of total government spending and the sector is still taxed at relatively high levels. For the poorest people, GDP growth originating in agriculture is about four times more effective in raising incomes of extremely poor people than GDP growth originating outside the sector. \\"A dynamic 'agriculture for development' agenda can benefit the estimated 900 million rural people in the Developing world who live on less than $1 a day, most of whom are engaged in agriculture\\", said Robert B. Zoellick, World Bank Group President. \\"We need to give agriculture more prominence across the board. At the global level, countries must deliver on vital reforms such as cutting distorting subsidies and opening markets, while civil society groups, especially farmer organizations, need more say in setting the agricultural agenda\\". According to the report, agriculture can offer pathways out of poverty if efforts are made to increase productivity in the staple foods sector; connect smallholders to rapidly expanding high-value horticulture, poultry, aquaculture, as well as dairy markets; and generate jobs in the rural nonfarm economy. ==Previous reports 1978-2018== The World Development Report began as a series of annual publications in the year 1978 with its first report titled \\"Prospects for Growth and Alleviation of Poverty.\\" Since then, it has focused each year on a particular theme that is central to development and the reports present a detailed study of the relevant sectors, applications and toolkits developed.

It was able to come into existence thanks to T. G. Masaryk (first Czechoslovakia's President), who at the time was financially supporting young journalist Ferdinand Peroutka. The magazine gained a notable reputation and became one of the most respected political publication of its time. A large number of democratically minded authors such as Karel Čapek, Milena Jesenská, Eduard Bass, Karel Poláček, Richard Wiener, Václav Černý, Otokar Fischer contributed to Přítomnost. Politician and publisher Jaroslav Stránský was the magazine's publisher. After the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, Peroutka was deported to a concentration camp in Buchenwald. After the War, Přítomnost was restarted as Dnešek, but in February 1948 it ended. A number of young Czech intellectuals in exile tried to publish the magazine in its former incarnation and named it Skutečnost. Amongst the contributors to this magazine were Pavel Tigrid, Jaroslav Stránský, Meda Mládková and Ferdinand Peroutka. === Relaunch === In January 1995, Martin Jan Stránský, the grandson of Jaroslav Stránský, carried on the family tradition and began to publish Nová Přítomnost. The first editor in chief of the renewed magazine was the poet Miroslav Holub. He was followed in this role by Petr Pithart, Jan Sokol, Tomáš Vrba, and Libuše Koubská.

It is made from a secret blend of 40 botanicals, including vanilla, orange peels and eucalyptus. The amaro was first produced by Stanislao Cobianchi in 1885 and is named after Princess Elena of Montenegro. Its production takes place in the factory of San Lazzaro di Savena (Province of Bologna) of Montenegro Srl. Stanislao travelled from continent to continent collecting 40 rinds, woods, seeds, rhizomes, flowers, fruits, citrus peels, roots, stems and leaves. The uniqueness of Amaro Montenegro lies as much in its unmistakable taste as it does in its distinctive production process. From hand-selected botanicals, to the extraction (boiling, maceration and distillation) and blending stages, Amaro Montenegro is the result of a rich and complex process that has been passed down through generations, unchanged since 1885. The Master Herbalist oversees the entire production process, just as Stanislao once did. == Production process == The 40 botanicals and caramel color that make up Amaro Montenegro come from four continents. Some of these perfumes are from the Mediterranean, such as coriander and Artemisia, as well as some aromatic plants, oregano and marjoram, with bitter and sweet oranges, nutmeg, cloves and cinnamon. Once they reach the herbalist’s workshop, the botanicals undergo three different forms of extraction: boiling, maceration and distillation. After this, twelve mother essences are taken and synthesized into six tasting notes: bitter and herbaceous, spicy and floral, chocolate and caramel, fresh and balsamic, vanilla and red fruits, and warm and tropical. One final element is added to these six notes, called \\"Premio\\"; it is the final and fundamental ingredient of the secret recipe. The Premio is the result of micro- distillation of five botanicals. Just one litre for every 15,000 is enough to complete the recipe. ==References== Category:Italian liqueurs Category:Bologna Category:Products introduced in 1885 Category:Herbal liqueurs Category:Italian brands ","title":"Amaro Montenegro"},{"id":"19245136","text":"The Prehistoric Park (in Italian language: Parco della Preistoria) is an Italian naturalistic park of more than 100 hectares of wood, situated on the outskirts of the Rivolta d'Adda commune, Cremona province, about 20 kilometers east of Milan. The park is adjacent to the homonym Adda river and contains 30 reconstructions of prehistoric animals (including prehistoric men), a hundred semi-liberty wild animals, a botanical itinerary with plants signalled, natural environments (as: a swamp, lawns, lakes, etc.), picnic reggeds areas, a café, playing parks, a labyrinth, and shows of fossils, etc., all along a shaded course. The access to the park is exclusively pedestrian, but access is allowed to bicycles and dogs with leashes. The park is also recognized by various national and local corporate bodies that testify to the validity of the structure as a guide to the environmental education, not only to children, but of adults as well. == History of the park == Construction of the park began in March 1976, and lasted for two years. From '76-'78, besides the jobs of realization, were iserite the prehistorical animal reconstructions, realized with scientific attention to detail, to seemingly recreate true animals. In fact, it was possible to create these reconstructions, beginning from the fossils of skeletons that were recovered in various international sites, and then by the study and analysis of the details of musculature, tissues, and skin; in this way, it was possible to create models in miniature, which were then reconstructioned in fibreglass, to recreate them in their natural greatness, just as these animals appeared millions of years ago. Important events in the park's history have been: *September 1978: opening and inauguration of the park; *1982: inauguration of the show fossils and mineral; *1988: insertion of new visitors capacity improvement structures; *2000: insertion of new reconstructions of prehistoric animals; *2009: inauguration of the paleontological museum; *2013: insertion of the Saltriosaurus; *2016: insertion of the Ticinosuchus and Titanosaurus; *2017: insertion of the Smilodon; *2019: insertion of the Diplodocus. == Botany  Park flora === Along the left bank of the Adda, the park offers a variety of vegetation and partially wooded formations. The forests of Northern Italy have been subject, for many centuries, to the various agricultural activities of reclamations and deforestations. However, in this line of the river it is, in fact, possible to experience the last hems of the primordial forest, characterized by deciduous leaf trees. The park wood entertains an intermixed variety of trees, such as: poplars, elms, locust trees, etc. The park features a proliferation of wild plants (such as violets, primroses, hawthorns, etc.) and other ancestral cultivations; its brushwood is invaluable. === Wood === The park wood is a mixture of latileaves deciduous trees. The forest structure is divided into three layers: arboreal, shrubby, and grassy. The arboreal layer consists of tall trees (over 15 m on average). The trees foliage of this layer accord an intermittent coverage, giving the impression of an open forest. The shrubby layer is characterized by plants to varying height (from 1 to 7 m). The grassy layer is constituted by various ground plants, including climbing plants, such as ivy. === The swamp === In the final part of the course, there is a swamp, bordering on the nearby herons lake (lago degli aironi). It is characterized by an ample curve, evolved in the time with the detachment from the quoted lake (meander). Here it is possible to admire the great variety of vegetation, characterized by: willows and larches; and aquatic vegetation, characterized by: water lilys, nasturtiums, etc.; in the muddy parts are noticed: cattails and marshy reeds. The rest of the vegetation, present in the center of the swamp, consists of: submerged plants, cried plants, semicried plants, reeds, etc. == Reconstructions == List of the 32 reconstructions of the kinds on the basis in the order by which the appear along the course. * Ticinosuchus; * Titanosaurus; * Pterygotus; * Coccosteus and Cephalaspis; * Eryops; * Dimetrodon; * Moschops; * Inostrancevia and Scutosaurus; * Plesiosaurus; * Stegosaurus; * Scolosaurus; * Brontosaurus; * Triceratops; * Styracosaurus; * Gallimimus; * Saltriosaurus; * Iguanodon; * Edmontosaurus; * Allosaurus; * Tyrannosaurus; * Tarbosaurus; * Velociraptor; * Proconsul; * Australopithecus; * Cro-Magnon man; * Gastornis; * Smilodon; * Platybelodon and Machairodus; * Pteranodon; * Cave bear; * Neanderthal man; * Woolly Mammoth; * Diplodocus. ==External links== Category:Dinosaur sculptures Category:Colossal statues Category:Paleoart Category:Sculpture series Category:Italy stubs Category:Zoo stubs Category:Italian building and structure stubs Category:Zoos in Italy Category:Tourist attractions in Lombardy Category:Nature parks of Italy Category:Botanical gardens in Italy Category:Parks in Lombardy Category:Parks in Italy Category:Zoos established in 1978 Category:Animal theme parks Category:1978 establishments in Italy Category:Province of Cremona Category:Protected areas of Italy Category:Tourism in Italy ","title":"Prehistoric Park (Italy)"},{"id":"19245147","text":"James B.

Lockhart serves co- chairs the Bipartisan Policy Center's Commission on Retirement Security and Personal Savings. For the prior 7 years, he served in the US Government in a series of Presidential-appointed, Senate-confirmed positions. He was the Director (CEO) and Chairman of the Oversight Board of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the regulator of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks. He assumed that position with the signing of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act on July 30, 2008. He was the Director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), which is now part of FHFA. He was nominated to that position by President George W. Bush, a friend of his from prep school, college and business school,White House Philosophy Stoked Mortgage Bonfire. The New York Times, December 21, 2008. and confirmed by the United States Senate in June 2006. He also served on the Financial Stability Oversight Board from its inception in 2008. This board was set up to oversee the Troubled Asset Relief Program.Lawder, David. Oversight panel discussed TARP housing options, Reuters, December 31, 2008. which is chaired by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and has as its other members the Secretaries of the Treasury and HUD, and the Chair of the SEC. From 2002 to 2006, Lockhart served as The Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer of the Social Security Administration and as Secretary to the Social Security Board of Trustees. He was a member of President Bush's Management Council and its Executive Committee. At SSA, he was the leader in promoting Social Security reform and in getting the Supplemental Security Income Program, the nation's largest cash-based welfare program, removed from GAO's High Risk list. SSA, OFHEO and FHFA all received the Association of Government Accountants' prestigious Certificate in Excellence for Accountability Reporting. Lockhart served in President George H.W. Bush's Administration as Executive Director (CEO) of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) from 1989-93. While he was at the PBGC, the agency restored the LTV Steel pension plans through a Supreme Court ruling and faced major airline (Eastern, PanAm, Continental and TWA) and steel company bankruptcies. PBGC also produced its first audited accounts in its history and was removed from GAO's High Risk list under Lockhart's leadership. As a way to encourage better funding of pension plans, he began publishing the “Top 50” underfunded pension plan list. He also pushed for legislative reforms which led to the passage of legislation in 1993. ==Government tenure== Within three weeks of his appointment in May 2006, Lockhart published a report detailing the numerous missteps by Fannie Mae's previous management and signed a consent agreement that restated Fannie Mae's extra 30% capital requirement and capped the growth of its investment portfolios for the first time. In a joint press conference with the SEC Chairman, Chris Cox, Lockhart announced a $400 million fine.OFHEO, SEC Reach Settlement with Fannie Mae; Penalty Imposed , fhfa.gov, May 23, 2006. Shortly thereafter, he obtained Freddie Mac's voluntary agreement to likewise cap the growth of their portfolio. From the beginning of his tenure as Director of OFHEO, Lockhart warned about the systemic risks Fannie and Freddie posed to the financial system and the need for Congress to grant OFHEO additional regulatory powers. In December 2006, Lockhart wrote an article stating that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's “government charters enable these companies to take on more risk than other major financial institutions. In addition to their significant operational difficulties, the Enterprises have lower capital requirements than banks, massive investment and derivative portfolios, limited discipline from credit markets, an inability to diversify their investments and no limit on bank investments in their securities…Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac present very large systemic risks to financial markets and financial institutions. That's why it is vital that Congress pass legislation creating an empowered regulator now.” He testified in favor of stronger legislation several times and gave numerous speeches which were well chronicled. These efforts were strongly supported by President Bush and Treasury Secretary Paulson. Reform legislation was passed by the House in May 2007 just as what was then considered only a “subprime crisis” was starting to appear. The Senate, however, did not pass the legislation, entitled the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) until July 2008. President Bush, who had called for GSE reform throughout his Presidency, signed HERA into law in an Oval Office ceremony on July 30. However, HERA was passed too late as stock market, foreign debt and mortgage-backed securities investors worried about their solvency. Lockhart had pushed both GSE's to raise more capital for over a year and in March got their Boards to agree to raise significant equity. The new Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) combined OFHEO; the Federal Housing Board, which regulated the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks; and the HUD group that oversaw Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's mission and affordable housing goals. Lockhart became the first director of the new agency and Chairman of its Oversight Board, whose other members were the Secretaries of Treasury and HUD and the Chairman of the SEC. By August 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were unable to raise additional equity while still purchasing over 70% of the mortgages originated in the US. Working closely with Secretary Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, Lockhart convinced the Boards of Directors of both GSEs to consent to being placed into conservatorship in meetings on Saturday, September 7, 2008. As part of this process, the CEO's and Boards were replaced for both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the two GSEs continued operations without interruption. With strong financial support provided by Treasury as authorized by HERA, the mortgage markets calmed temporarily only to be disrupted the following week by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Secretary Paulson's book, On The Brink, deals extensively with the conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Lockhart's tenure spanned the financial crisis of 2007–2009. The New York Times reported that during his watch, \\"both Freddie and Fannie had plunged into the riskiest part of the market, gobbling up more than $400 billion in subprime and other alternative mortgages,\\" criticizing Lockhart for lax oversight and not responding to early signs of trouble at those institutions. The FHFA office strenuously defended Lockhart's record in response,FHFA response to the New York Times , fhfa.gov, December 22, 2008. citing the fact that he had capped the growth of both Fannie and Freddie's mortgage portfolio for the first time and had “repeatedly called for legislative reforms to increase capital requirements, reduce the size of the Enterprises' portfolios and enhance regulatory authorities, including broadened authority to impose a conservatorship or receivership.” Lockhart worked closely with the Bush Administration and many housing and financial groups to help stabilize the mortgage market, which was critical for the financial future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as they owned or guaranteed $5.5 trillion of mortgages (57% of all US mortgages). In November 2008, Lockhart announced the Streamlined Mortgage Modification Program designed to prevent the rapidly growing delinquencies turning into foreclosures. He pushed both GSE's to be more creative and responsive in modifying mortgages. He testified at a hearing on September 23, 2008 with Secretary Paulson, Chairman Bernanke and SEC Chairman Cox on the need for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). He served as a member with them and HUD Secretary Preston and subsequently their successors as members of the Financial Stability Oversight Board overseeing the $700 billion TARP fund. After the election of President Barack Obama, Lockhart remained in his post as Director of FHFA. He played a key role in the Obama Administration's effort to stem home foreclosures, including the Making Home Affordable Program. Throughout the market turmoil, he continued to oversee the smooth transition to a new agency. OFHEO and FHFA both received the Association of Government Accountants award – Certificate for Excellence in Accountability Reporting as had Social Security. He worked closely with the 12 Federal Home Loan Bank Presidents as they dealt with their private label MBS problems. He strengthened their Office of Finance's Board that produces their combined financial statements. ==Career== In 1997, Lockhart co-founded and served as managing director of NetRisk Inc., a risk management software and consulting firm since acquired by Fitch Risk Management. NetRisk's clients included major financial services companies. Lockhart has served as Senior Vice President, Finance, at National Reinsurance(1996) which was acquired by General Reinsurance; Managing Director in Smith Barney's Investment Banking Group for financial institutions and Co- Head of its Private Equity Group (1993–1995); Vice President and Treasurer of Alexander & Alexander(1981–1989); and Assistant Treasurer of Gulf Oil in Europe and the U.S. (1974–1981). Lockhart served as a member of the American Benefits Council's Board of Directors and on the Advisory Board to the Task Force for the Critical Review of the U.S. Actuarial Profession. ==Early life== Lockhart was born in White Plains, New York in 1946. He became an Eagle Scout at the early age of 13. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts for four years where he became a good friend of George W. Bush. During his senior year he moved to St. Paul, MN as his father moved to become CEO of Conwed from being the CFO of Riegel Paper Corporation. ==Military== Lockhart joined the Navy in 1969 after spending a year at the First National Bank of St. Paul. At Officer Candidate School, he was the Supply Corps Honor Graduate and at the Navy Supply Corps School he graduated with High Honors. He served as the Supply Officer on the Nuclear Ballistic Submarine USS George Washington Carver (SSBN-656) homeported in Holy Loch, Scotland. He qualified in Submarines and as an Officer of the Deck. ==Education== Lockhart graduated from Yale University in 1968 where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and the lacrosse team.

British and French troops used modern artillery on a large scale for the first time in China. Cannon fire inflicted heavy casualties on the Taiping forces, whose commander Li Xiucheng was wounded in the left leg by a shot fired from a cannon. ==Prelude== From 1851–1853, Chinese City of Shanghai had been occupied by the Small Swords Society, who were nominally allied with the Taiping Rebellion. The Qing fully recaptured the area in February 1853.Williams, S. Wells. The Middle Kingdom: A Survey of the Geography, Government, Literature, Social Life, Arts, and History of the Chinese Empire and its Inhabitants, Vol. 1, p. 107. Scribner (New York), 1904. In June 1860 a Taiping army of 20,000 led by Lai Wenguang had attacked Shanghai and reoccupied it for five months before withdrawing. In early 1861 Li Xiucheng was in control of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces, commanding over 600,000 Taiping troops. He aimed to capture the large but isolated city, one of the most important cities under the Qing government and home to an international port. At Li Xiucheng's request the UK and France had promised to maintain neutrality. By 11 June 1861 the Taiping Army was able to muster five armies, commanded by Tan Shaoguang, Li Rongfa, Ji Qingyuan, Chen Kunshu, and Chen Bingwen, organized under two fronts, and other units. The commander of the Imperial Green Standard Army was Huang Yisheng, under the direction of Shanghai's taotai Wu Xu (吳煦). The Huai Army militia were led by Li Hongzhang. Hong Rengan was very opposed to this battle because he thought Shanghai was not a military problem. == First stage == On 1 March 1862 the combined troops of Hope and Ward's troops routed the Taiping forces Xiaotang village, just outside of the city. (now a part of Shanghai's Fengxian District). This victory gains Ward the promotion to Brigadier General and his army gains the moniker \\"Ever Victorious Army\\". Taiping's Lt. Gen. Li Rongfa began the battle with an invasion of Pudong by 20,000 men, transported in thousands of boats. Upon his occupation of the whole district the city requested help from the British and French. In October (according to the Chinese calendar), the American Frederick Townsend Ward brought 2,000 Filipino and Chinese soldiers, whom he had trained, against the Taiping forces. Following a 15-day Christmas ceasefire called by Li Rongfa, the government of Shanghai asked Beijing for assistance in December. In response the Huai Army with its 20,000 soldiers was sent to reinforce Shanghai immediately. == Middle stage == On 10 April 1862 (according to the Chinese calendar), Li Hongzhang was promoted to governor of Jiangsu province, of which Shanghai was a part. Five days later the Huai Army began its counterattack on Shanghai. At the same time the mayor of Jinshan commanded 5,000 men of the Green Standard Army to surround and attack the city of Taicang, which was then occupied by Taiping forces. Li Xiucheng sent 100,000 men to relieve Taicang on 19 April. Despite orders from Li Hongzhang to withdraw, the mayor refused to do so, resulting in the loss of his entire force. On 29 April, Maj. Gen. Chen Bingwen occupied Jiading, whose Qing garrison withdrew to Shanghai proper. The Taiping Army then prepared to attack Songjiang and northwestern Shanghai from Jiading. Li Hongzhang ordered Maj. Gen. Cheng Xueqi, vice-commander of the Huai Army, to counterattack against Chen Bingwen. On 1 May Li Rongfa's force surrendered to the Huai Army in Nanhui. Li Hongzhang delegated Brig. Gen. Liu Mingchuan to accept their surrender, provoking Li Rongfa to order Lt. Gen. Ji Qingyuan to make a series of attacks against Liu Mingchuan in the district. The failure of these attacks forced Li Rongfa to withdraw from Pudong on 10 May, ending nine months of occupation. The Qing government thus regained control of eastern and southern Shanghai. On 8 May Cheng Xueqi launched an assault on the Taiping forces occupying Songjiang, and expelled them after 13 days of combat. By May, Taiping forces have been expelled from a thirty-mile radius of Shanghai. Li Hongzhang's Huai Army arrives in the area in mid-May but are defeated at Jiajing by the Taiping. == Last stage == In September 1862 a Taiping army of 80,000 under the command of Tan Shaoguang mounted a second attack on Shanghai, which was defended by Maj. Gen. Guo Songlin (郭松林) of the Huai Army. The initial assault, led by Chen Bingwen (陳炳文), faltered when Cheng Xueqi destroyed all 20 Taiping camps (one of which accommodated 500 soldiers); Chen Binwen retreated to Sijiangkou (四江口), where he joined Tan Shaoguang. On 12 September the consolidated Taiping forces, numbering 70,000, struck the Qing again from Taicang and Kunshan. Moving very rapidly, they reached Qingpu, only 5 km from the city, and surrounded 20,000 Imperial troops. Qing fleet commander Huang Esen counterattacked from the river, gaining some ground, but even after reinforcement by the Ever Victorious Army he was unable to make much progress. The Taiping forces used this time to build many floating bridges. Li Hongzhang arrived to oversee the combat in person, ordering his generals (Cheng, Guo and Liu) to defeat Tan at Jiading and relieve the Imperial units surrounded by the Taiping on the northern coast before it was too late. On 21 September Cheng Xueqi, commanding only 6,000 combined Huai Army and Qing naval forces, in eight successive attacks made between 0800 and 1400 was finally able to cut off the Taiping Army's retreat. The Huai Army broke out of the enclave on the northern coast, killing over 30,000 Taiping troops. Cheng himself received a serious gunshot wound to the chest, but was rewarded with a promotion to Lieutenant General. Gen. Tan, accompanied by Brig. Gau Yongkuan (郜永寬), retreated to Suzhou to prepare its defenses. The Taiping forces launched four more unsuccessful attacks against the defenders, after which Hong Xiuquan ordered the offensive to be halted and the forces to withdraw, ending the battle. The combined forces of the Qing government, the British and the French were victorious, and Taiping permanently abandoned its designs on Shanghai. ==Sources== *Teng Yuan-chung.

Sercos III applies the hard real-time features of the Sercos interface to Ethernet. It is based upon and conforms to the Ethernet standard (IEEE 802.3 & ISO/IEC 8802-3). Work began on Sercos III in 2003, with vendors releasing first products supporting it in 2005. __TOC__ == General architecture == In order to achieve the throughput and jitter requirements in Sercos applications, Sercos III operates primarily in a Master/Slave arrangement exchanging cyclic data between nodes. The master initiates all data transmission during a Sercos real-time cycle. All data transmissions begin and end at the master (circular). === Sercos III cycle === 300px Communication across a Sercos III network occurs in strict cyclic intervals. A cycle time is chosen by the user for a given application, ranging from 31.25 µs to 65 ms. Within each cycle, data is exchanged between Sercos III nodes using two types of telegrams: MDTs and ATs (see Telegram Types). After all MDTs and ATs are transmitted, Sercos III nodes allow the remaining time in the cycle to be used as an UC (Unified Communication) Channel, which can be used to exchange data using other formats, such as IP. The network remains available to UCC traffic until the next cycle begins, at which time Sercos III closes the nodes to UCC traffic again. This is an important distinction. Sercos is purposely designed to provide open access at all ports for other protocols between cyclic real time messages. No tunneling is required. This provides the advantage that any Sercos III node is available, whether Sercos III is in cyclic mode or not, to use other protocols, such as TCP/IP, without any additional hardware to process tunneling. Sercos nodes are specified to provide a store and forward method of buffering non-Sercos messages should they be received at a node while cyclic communication is active. ===Telegrams=== 500px Telegram format All Sercos III telegrams conform to the IEEE 802.3 & ISO/IEC 8802-3 MAC (Media Access Control) frame format. ; Destination address : The destination address for all Sercos III telegrams is always 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF (all 1s), which is defined as a broadcast address for Ethernet telegrams. This is because all telegrams are issued by the master, and are intended for all slaves on the network. ; Source address : The source address for all Sercos III telegrams is the MAC address of the master, as it issues all telegrams. ; Ethernet type : A unique EtherType value has been assigned via the IEEE EtherType Field Registration Authority for Sercos III (0x88CD). ; Sercos III header : The beginning of the Ethernet-defined data field always begins with a Sercos III header, which contains control and status information unique to Sercos. ; Sercos III data field : The Sercos III header is followed by the Sercos III data field, which contains a configurable set of variables defined for each device in the network. Telegram types Two main types of telegrams are used within the Sercos III Cycle. The Master Data Telegram (MDT), and the Acknowledge Telegram (AT). Both telegram types are issued by the master (control). The MDT contains information provided by the master to slaves. It is filled by the master, and read by slaves. The AT is issued by the master, but is actually populated by each slave with its appropriate response data (feedback values, input states, etc.). More than one slave uses the same AT, filling in its pre-determined area in the AT telegram, updating checksums, and then passing the telegram to the next device. This method reduces the impact of the Ethernet frame overhead on the performance of the network without compromising IEEE 802.3 & ISO/IEC 8802-3. The amount of data sent from the master to slaves, as well as the sum of the data returned by the slaves, may exceed the 802.3-specified maximum 1500-byte data field size. To comply with this limit, Sercos III may use more than one MDT telegram in a cycle, as well as more than one AT telegram (up to 4 in each case). 250px === Synchronization === To achieve true hard real time characteristics, Sercos III, like Sercos I & II, uses a form of synchronization that depends upon a synchronization “mark” issued by the master control at exact equidistant time intervals. All nodes in a Sercos network use this telegram to synchronize all activities in the node. To account for variations in network components, delays are measured in the node-to-node transmissions during phase-up (initialization) of a Sercos network, and those values are compensated for during normal operation. Unlike Sercos I & II, where a separate Master Sync Telegram, or MST is used for this purpose, Sercos III includes the MST in the first MDT transmitted. No separate telegram is issued. The time between two MSTs is exactly equal to the designated Sercos cycle time, tScyc. The synchronization process ensures that cyclical and simultaneous synchronization of all connected devices occurs independently of topology and of the number of devices in Sercos networks. 300px ===Physical and data link layers=== Sercos III supports standard IEEE 802.3 & ISO/IEC 8802-3 100Base-TX or 100Base-FX (100 Mbit/s baseband) full duplex physical layer (PHY) entities. 802.3-compliant Media-Access Controller (MAC) sub-layers are used. Autonegotiation must be enabled on each PHY, but only 100 Mbit full duplex is supported. Auto (MAU [Media Attachment Unit]-Embedded) Crossover is specified between the two Physical Medium Attachment (PMA) units present with a duplex port. These two units are referred to as the Primary Channel and Secondary Channel in the Sercos III specification. Dual interfaces are required (two duplex interfaces per device). Within the Sercos III specification the dual interfaces are referred to as P1 and P2 (Ports 1 and 2). ===Wiring=== Installing a Sercos network is easy and does not require infrastructure components such as switches or hubs. All devices are interconnected by patch or crossover cables up to 100 m in length. The Ethernet ports on the devices are interchangeable and can be used to connect standard Ethernet devices such as notebook computers to the network. Every Ethernet and IP protocol on Sercos devices can be accessed without interfering with the real-time protocol and without requiring the real-time operation to be activated. ===Sercos III stack=== All of the functionality required to configure a Sercos III interface is contained in a stack that is available in both “hard” and “soft” versions. The hard version is widely used for embedded applications (such as drives, I/O modules and micro-controller based motion control), where: * It is important that the overhead of managing the Sercos III nodes not be placed upon the device processor. * Nanosecond jitter is required. The hardware stack is available in a number of different forms. These currently include: * A bit stream for Xilinx FPGAs for master and slave * A bit stream for Altera FPGAs for master and slave * A bit stream for Lattice Semiconductor FPGAs for master and slave * A Net list for Xilinx FPGAs for master and slave * A Net list for Altera FPGAs for master and slave * A Net list for Lattice FPGAs for master and slave *The “netX” multi-network controller chip from Hilscher, GmbH for master and slave * The Anybus CC module from HMS Industrial Networks for slave * The Sitara™ AM335x microprocessors from Texas Instruments for master and slave. * The Innovasic, Inc. fido 5000 REM Switch chip for slave. *The RZ/N1 microprocessors from Renesas Electronics for slave. The maximum jitter allowed with hard-stack-based masters and slaves is less than 1 µs. Using the above stacks yields a jitter similar to Sercos II (35-70 nanoseconds). Sercos III also supports an operating system and hardware platform independent “Soft Master”, using a completely software-based stack for the master interface. Since the maximum jitter in such a configuration is dependent upon the operating system of the Master, the maximum jitter may be set by a variable for the Sercos III network when a Soft Master is employed. A standard Ethernet controller can be used for applications with line topology, bus cycle times greater than 500 us, and microsecond range synchronization. Applications with higher synchronization requirements and lower bus cycle times can be implemented using a TTS-capable Ethernet controller with a suitable real-time operating system. For basic Slaves, such as I/O devices, EasySlave-IO, a license-free bitstream variant of the EasySlave is available. A product that uses an Arduino board as a rapid prototype platform for an application, plus a corresponding shield (add-on module) with a Sercos EasySlave FPGA, plus other peripheral components, is available. ===Data consistency=== A term usually associated with the IT enterprise, data consistency can also apply to real- time control (see for example Peer to Peer Communication). For this reason, Sercos III specifies that no data be overwritten (destroyed) during a transmission. Every slave on a network may access input and output data for every other slave on the network. === Addressing === Devices must support Ethernet’s MAC addressing, plus the Sercos III addressing. Other addressing schemes are optional. ; Sercos III address : Each Sercos III device contains a numeric address used by other devices on the Sercos III network to exchange data. The address may be any whole integer from 1 to 511. ; IP address : Sercos III does not use an IP address for its own operation. Whether a device contains an IP address or not is dependent on its support of other specifications, either independent (exclusive) of Sercos III operation, or via the UC (Unified Communication) Channel portion of the cycle. ===Network topologies=== The Sercos III specification defines two possible network topologies; Ring and Line. To those familiar with other networks, both of them may appear to be configured as a ring. All telegrams begin and end at the master. The Full Duplex feature of the physical layer is used to achieve this. Line topology 600px : A line topology is the simpler of the two possible arrangements, and provides no redundancy. However, this configuration saves the cost of one cable. In it, only one of the two interfaces on the master is used. Telegrams are issued out of the transmit PMA on the Master’s active port. Either port on the master may be the active one. Sercos III determines this during phase-up (initialization). The first slave receives the telegrams on the connected interface’s receive PMA, modifies them as required, and issues them out on the transmit PMA of the second interface. Each cascading Slave does likewise until the last Slave in the Line is reached. That slave, detecting no Sercos III connection on its second port, folds the telegram back on the receiving interface’s transmit port. The telegram then makes its way through each Slave back to the Master. Note the last slave also emits all Sercos III telegrams on its second port, even though no Sercos III connection is detected. This is for snooping, ring closures (see below), and hot-plugging. Keep in mind that since the Ethernet destination field in all Sercos III telegrams is the broadcast address of 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF (all 1s), all telegrams issued from this open port will be seen by other devices as broadcast telegrams. This behavior is by design, and cannot be disabled. To avoid taxing networks attached to an open Sercos port, an IP-Switch can be used, or alternately a managed Ethernet switch programmed to block broadcast telegrams received from the Sercos port can be used. Starting with Sercos III specification version 1.3.1 the connection of industrial Ethernet devices is supported where devices work with 20 ms cycle time in communication phase 0 (CP 0). 500px Ring topology : A ring topology simply closes the network by attaching the unused port on the last device in a ring back to the unused port on the Master. When the Sercos III Master senses that a ring exists, it sets up two counter-rotating telegrams. The same data is issued simultaneously out of the transmit PMAs of both ports on the Master. From there both telegrams are managed essentially identically as they make their way through each Slave, ending back at the opposite port on the Master they were emitted from. Advantages to this topology include tighter synchronization, as well as automatic infrastructure redundancy (see below). Other network topologies : With both the line or ring structure, Sercos III operates in a “circular” approach. All telegrams leave the master, and return there. As with any network that operates in this manner, modified structures can be constructed to appear as a tree or star network, utilizing hardware that manages the branches, but the structure is still circular in nature. ===Infrastructure hardware=== Sercos III is designed in such a way that no additional network infrastructure (standard Ethernet switches, Hubs, etc.) is required to operate. In fact, no additional standard Ethernet (non- Sercos III capable) components may be placed within a Sercos III network, as their presence will adversely affect the timing and synchronization of the network. To guarantee synchronization in extended networks using media converters requires Cut-through switching. If ring redundancy shall be achieved, Link Loss Forwarding with appropriate reaction times is necessary. ===Fieldbus integration=== A variety of products is available that enable the connection of fieldbuses (Profibus and CAN) or sensor/actuator buses (AS-i, SSI, IO-Link) to a Sercos network. Gateways are available to integrate analog axes. Gateways are incorporated into Sercos devices (e.g., modular I/Os) or are connected as separate components in the network. ==Features== In addition to the features of the Sercos interface, Sercos III also provides: * Sercos is a manufacturer-independent technology. The Sercos International e.V. user organization and its members own all rights to this technology, which means investment protection. * Sercos is an open international standard according to IEC 61491 for a 100 Mbit/s full duplex Fast Ethernet bus (and therefore part of IEC 61784, IEC 61158, IEC 61800-7). * Cost-effective and simple networking by dispensing with switches and hubs. * Sercos Hard- and Soft-Master (Open Source license) are available. * With the Sercos Hard Master, the CPU load is extremely reduced compared to other bus systems. * Sercos Real Time behavior down to 31,25 µsec (Real Time Class 3, IEC 61784-2) with a summation frame telegram and highest synchronization accuracy << 1 µs. * Together with EtherCAT, Sercos is the fastest 100Mps industrial Ethernet technology. * Any Ethernet-bus (e.g., EtherCAT, EtherNet/IP, Modbus/TCP, Profinet, etc.) and Ethernet-protocol (TCP/IP, FTP, UDP, OPC/UA, Webserver, etc.) can run in parallel to the Sercos real-time channel (no tunneling). * Seamless integration of classic field busses, like CANopen M/S, Profibus M/S, DeviceNet M/S, ASi-Interface, IO-Link, Serial, 3964R, etc. * Sercos is an Ethernet TSN compatible network. * Sercos technology offers flexible network topologies, such as ring, tree for ring, line, tree for line and double line. * Redundancy with ring topology, without additional hardware, is no problem for Sercos. Cable breaks in a ring configuration are recognized within 25μs. * Easy cabling: Automatic detection of straight or crossed cables and Sercos Port 1 / 2 can be interchanged without problems. * Hot plug from Sercos slaves significantly increases machine availability. * Direct real-time cross communication between slaves guarantees minimal reaction time. * Real-time master-to-master cross-communication enables the synchronization of several Sercos III networks. * Fastest SIL3 safety reaction time with black channel approach for CIP Safety and ASi Safety. * Stable Sercos profiles: Drive, IO, Energy, Encoder, Safe Motion and Power supply. * Comprehensive diagnostic functions for easy troubleshooting, e.g., the direct connection to the Sercos network for service PCs. * Detailed analysis of Sercos networks with the Sercos III Monitor (Freeware for Windows & Linux). ===Application layer (profiles)=== The Sercos III specification defines a broad range of variables developed by a consortium of product suppliers to provide interoperability between components (motion controls, drives, etc.). All traffic across a Sercos III network consists of Idents (parameters) with attributes. The idents define over 700 standardized parameters which describe the interaction between electric, pneumatic and hydraulic control systems, drives and other peripheral devices using universal semantics. This method was first defined in Sercos I, as an essentially flat set of idents. They were later grouped into application sets to aid in selection of pertinent idents required for a given industry, such as the “Pack Profile” for use with packaging machinery. During the development of the Sercos III specification, this methodology was further refined to group the idents logically by device class. The definition of the legacy idents has remained largely untouched; rather their grouping has been re-evaluated for a more understandable architecture. This has also enabled the separation of communication idents into a logical subset, simplifying migration from Sercos I/II to Sercos III, and providing a clear overview to users. 500px ===Redundancy=== When a ring network is employed, Sercos III provides for automatic infrastructure redundancy. If any interconnection point in the ring ceases to function, the associated Sercos III nodes will detect a “ring break” and “loop back” the end nodes, effectively operating as two lines rather than one ring. The operation is “bump-less”, as the detection & recovery time for such a break is less than 25 µs, which is less than the minimum Sercos III cycle time. Sercos III can also recover from ring breaks and “heal” with no interruption in operation. Since Sercos III telegrams continue to be emitted by transmit PMAs on unconnected ports, and receive PMAs on unconnected ports continue to monitor for incoming data, when a Sercos III port recognizes that a ring has by physically re-closed, it will re-activate the counter-rotating telegrams to functionally close the rings again. This operation is also bump-less. ===Peer communications=== To ensure the determinism required, most real-time Ethernet standards enforce a master-to- slave-only method of communications. This can conflict with the need for a node in the system to exchange data efficiently with a node other than the network master. The conventional method to achieve this in a master-slave network is to pass data from one slave node to the master, where it is reissued to one or more different slaves. For example, if several servo drives on a network are to be synchronized to a signal from another drive on the network, the master must fetch the signal from this drive and reissue it to all other drives on the network. Disadvantages to this method are that delays are induced due to the multiple cycles required, and the master’s processing load is increased as it must actively participate in the function, although it contributes nothing. Since no data is destroyed in a Sercos III telegram, data to and from any slave can be accessed by another node on the network without any additional cycle delay or master intervention. Additionally, as telegrams pass each node twice in a cycle (for both topology types), a node can even have the opportunity to access data supplied by a subsequent node. Two peer communication methods are defined in the Sercos III specification: Controller to Controller (C2C) for multiple masters to communicate with one another, and Cross Communication (CC) for multiple slaves. ===Hot-plugging=== Another feature of Sercos III is hot-plugging, which is the ability to add devices to an active network. Using the features described for redundancy, a network can detect when a new device is attached to an active network. Processes exist that configure the new device, and announce its availability to the master control. After that, the master control can select to make use of the new device based on the application currently running. ===Oversampling and time stamping=== Oversampling allows more than one nominal/actual value to be transmitted per cycle, increasing the delicate nature of process control in extremely critical applications, such as laser applications. Time stamping transmits event-controlled results, such as specific measured data, and switches outputs independently from the cycle. This increases the stability of the process in complex processing solutions, such as those in the semiconductor industry. ===Unified Communication (UC) Channel=== The time between the end of the transmission of all Sercos III Real Time (RT) cyclic telegrams, and the beginning of the next communication cycle is defined as the “Sercos III Unified Communication Channel” (UC Channel). During this time period, the Sercos network is opened to allow transmission of Ethernet- compliant frames for other services and protocols. For example: # Web servers can be embedded in Sercos III-compliant devices to respond to standard Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages received via the UC Channel. # Frames from other Fieldbus standards that conform to Ethernet frame formatting may be transmitted across a Sercos III network. Every Sercos III-compliant node must support the passing of UC frames through its Sercos III interface. Whether a Sercos III node actively makes use of the UC feature is determined by the feature set of the product. If, for example, the device has an embedded web server, it could make available its IP address for access by other devices. A Sercos III network will always pass UC frames, even when cyclic operation has not been initialized. This means that devices always have access to the network for UC messages, as long as the ports are powered. 400px Sercos III does not define whether a port should operate in cut-through switching or store-and-forward mode when handling UC frames. There are Sercos III products currently on the market that support both modes. Likewise, Sercos III does not define whether a port should intelligently process UC telegrams, such as learn the network topology. The time allotted for UC traffic is dictated by the amount of data transmitted during the real-time portion of the cycle. In real- world applications, there is a significant amount of bandwidth available for UC frames. For example, in a typical application with 8 axes of motion and a cycle rate of 250 µs, the equivalent of 85 Mbit/s is available for UC use. This amount of time means the UC frames in this example can be as long as the maximum defined for Ethernet (Maximum Transmission Unit [MTU] =1500). Using the same example of 8 axes, but with a cycle time of 62.5 µs, the effective bandwidth available for UC frames would be 40 Mbit/s, and the MTU would be reduced to 325. As with any network where time on the bus is shared, MTU values should be configured to ensure reliable communication. Properly configured Sercos networks will set the Sercos parameter “Requested MTU” (S-0-1027.0.1) to the recommended MTU value, which can then be read by other devices to match their MTU settings. Regardless of the value of this parameter, a Sercos node will allow non-Sercos traffic to pass for the entire UC channel time period (i.e., telegrams longer than the MTU setting are not discarded by the Sercos stack). Sercos parameter S-0-1027.0.1 is set by default to 576, the minimum value called out in RFC 791. 300px 300px UCC access UC frames may only enter a Sercos III network through a Sercos III- compliant port. This can be achieved two different ways. One is to employ the unused Sercos III port at the end of a Sercos III network configured in line topology, as shown to the right. In a network configured in ring topology, the ring can be temporarily broken at any point to also attach a device. Since the redundancy feature of Sercos III will reconfigure the network in a bump-less manner (responding in less than one cycle), no disruption of network transmission will occur. The ring can again be closed after the access is no longer required. If access is desired in the middle of a line topology (where no free ports are available), or it is undesirable to break a ring topology for extended periods of time, the Sercos III specification permits a device called an “IP-Switch” that can be used to provide access to the UC channel anywhere along the network. IP-Switches supply two Sercos III-compliant ports, and one or more ports for UCC access. Commercially available UCC Switches block the transmission of Sercos III broadcast telegrams out their non-Sercos III port(s), to prevent flooding of non-Sercos III networks with Sercos III cyclic data. ===Common network protocol=== Sercos III is designed so that EtherNet/IP. TC/IP and Sercos devices can operate over the same Ethernet cable. The high efficiency Sercos telegrams use only a portion of the existing bandwidth, allowing non-Sercos telegrams to be transmitted via the UC channel. A Sercos master and an EtherNet/IP scanner are required in order to implement a common network infrastructure. They can be combined into a dual stack master. Where redundancy is not necessary, the devices are connected in a line topology, where the last Sercos device in the line transmits and receives non- Sercos telegrams via its free port. A free port is not available when the network is configured in a ring topology for redundant data communication. In such a configuration, an IP switch is required to allow non-Sercos packets into the ring. ===Functional safety support=== \\"Functional safety\\" is a general term referring to the design of a system that reduces the risk that a hazardous event harmful to humans can occur with a system. The main definition is contained in the international standard IEC 61508. Most industrial networks contain some type of features to conform to functional safety requirements. Rather than define a unique specification for this functional safety, Sercos III Safety is based upon the CIP Safety protocol developed by the Open DeviceNet Vendors Association (ODVA). This provides interoperability at the safety level with all networks based upon the Common Industry Protocol (CIP), including DeviceNet and EtherNet/IP. CIP Safety on Sercos provides for safe data transmission over Sercos III up to SIL 3 (Safety Integrity Level). No additional safety bus is required, as the safety information is sent in addition to the standard data on the Sercos network. With CIP Safety on Sercos, data is sent on the same medium using the same connections as standard communication. The function of the cross-media CIP Safety protocol is performed by the end units, making it possible to simultaneously operate standard and safety devices in the same network. Reliable communication can take place between all network levels, including peer-to-peer communication and cross-network communication. The master does not necessarily have to be a safety controller. It can also route data without being able to interpret it. This makes it possible for configure the safety network architecture for implementation of safety programmable controllers or peer-to-peer communication between sensors and actuators. ===Sercos I/O Profile=== The Sercos I/O profile is a device profile for decentralized I/O modules, which can be used for block and modular I/Os. It also supports hybrid devices that combine several functionalities in one single device, e.g., two-axis controller with I/O and master functionality. An XML-based device and profile description language is specified for I/O device configuration. SDDML (Sercos Device Description Markup Language) describes which profiles are supported by a certain device. SPDML (Sercos Profile Description Markup Language) is used to specify the different profiles on the basis of the Sercos parameter model. Existing standard parameters can be used and manufacturer-specific parameters can also be defined. ===Sercos Energy Profile=== Sercos Energy is an application layer profile that defines parameters and commands for the reduction of energy consumption in a uniform vendor-independent manner. Sercos Energy reduces energy consumption in three areas: * 1. The permanent load at motor/machine standstill is reduced; * 2. The energy consumption depending on the process is dynamically adjusted considering the target completion times/dates to achieve more efficient partial loading; and * 3. Energy is saved during processing by switching off components that are not required at a particular time or point in the process (partial machine operation). In operation, the control reads out parameters of each Sercos Energy component via the Sercos III network, receiving status information and detailed consumption values. Depending on the situation (e.g., scheduled or unscheduled breaks, machine components not needed in the current production process) standardized commands can be issued by the control to switch connected components (drives, I/O, sensors) into energy-saving conditions, up to complete shut-down, reducing their energy consumption. The profile considers energy-saving conditions for predictable breaks such as lunch periods and plant holidays. At pre-defined times, Sercos Energy components are brought into a standstill condition in order to save energy. Shortly before the end of the interruption, Sercos Energy provides for the re-initialization of components in stand-by condition, to make them available again. Sercos Energy provides mechanisms for unintended breaks caused by machine errors and missing parts. In these situations, target components can be carefully brought into energy-saving modes while errors are being fixed or during a wait for new parts. By using intelligent controls, axes and components that are unneeded in ongoing production processes can be switched off and/or target completion times can be adjusted, while still achieving full productivity. ===Sercos Encoder Profile=== The function specific Encoder Profile ensures that encoders from different manufacturers can be utilized in Sercos applications without compatibility problems. Supported encoder functions are defined, and their use with other devices, e.g., controls, is specified. Both stand-alone encoders and hybrid devices with encoders are supported. ===Sercos and OPC UA=== The OPC Foundation and Sercos International developed an OPC UA companion specificationhttps://opcfoundation.org/markets-collaboration/sercos- international/ which describes the mapping of Sercos to OPC UA. This makes the functions and parameters of Sercos III devices available to OPC UA, independent of any vendor. This simplifies communication between machine automation devices and higher level supervisory systems. The multi-protocol capabilities of Sercos III allow various implementation options. The OPC UA server functionality can be implemented into a machine control or directly into a Sercos field device, such as a drive, sensor or I/O module. An OPC client can also be integrated into a Sercos controller. An OPC client and OPC UA server can communicate with each other even when Sercos real-time communication is not active, because the Sercos transmission process does not require tunneling. ===Sercos and IO-Link=== I/O Link is a digital interface for connection of sensors and actuators to higher level automation busses, such as Sercos III. An IO-Link master can be either a stand-alone slave or part of a modular slave device. An IO-Link-to-Sercos mapping guidehttps://www.automation.com/library/resources/io-link-mapping-guide-for- serocs-released is available to assist manufacturers in integrating IO-Link into a Sercos III network. An IO-Link development board with an IO-Link master and a Sercos III slave interface is available. ===Sercos support for AS-i=== AS-i (Actuator Sensor Interface) is a networking interface for connection of simple field devices such as actuators and sensors to higher level busses, such as Sercos III. Several AS-i/Sercos gateways are available for connection of AS-i devices to a Sercos III network. ===TSN (Time Sensitive Networking=== Standard Ethernet is not deterministic, therefore not suitable for hard real- time communications. In order to address that problem, the Time-Sensitive Networking task group of the IEEE 802.1 working group is developing a set of standards that define mechanisms for hard real-time data transmission over Ethernet networks. A Sercos working group has determined that Sercos is compatible with TSN. A Sercos TSN demonstrator was developed to illustrate the real-time multi-protocol capable Sercos network based on TSN.https://www.automation.com/en-us/articles/2017/sercos-to-present-sercos- tsn-demonstrator-at-hanno ==SupportDriver software=== Driver software is used to connect a controller to the device logic. A number of basic Sercos drivers are available as open source software from sourceforge.net. These include a common Sercos Master API library, Sercos Internet Protocol Services software and a Sercos UCC Ethernet network driver. An open source Sercos SoftMaster is also available from sourceforge.net. It emulates the Sercos functions, so that a standard Ethernet controller can be used instead of FPGA or ASIC hardware. A pre-certified CIP Safety on Sercos protocol software is available to equip Sercos and EtherNet/IP devices with the appropriate safe logic up to SIL3. ===Certification=== Conformance testing verifies that both controls and peripheral devices comply with Sercos standards and are able to operate interoperably in networks with products from multiple vendors. A testing tool, The Sercos Conformizer, can be used to subject a device to a pre-test prior to the formal conformance procedure. ===Sercos User Groups=== Sercos International e.V., a Sercos user's group headquartered in Germany, developed and supports Sercos as an open IEC standard, independent of any individual company.

At in length, it was one of the shortest piers in the country. It was built in 1910 at the end of the golden age of pier building, and other than a 1957 pier built in Deal, Kent to replace a structure damaged in World War II, it was the last pleasure pier to be built in the United Kingdom. The building was destroyed by fire and demolished in 2008. ==History== Fleetwood Pier opened on Whit Monday in 1910, a pavilion was added the following year, and a cinema was opened in 1942. The pier was badly damaged on 25 August 1952 after a fire which started in the cinema, and did not fully reopen until 1958. At various times it has been an amusement complex, bar and dance hall. The Stefani family were the longest owners in the Pier's history, owning and running Fleetwood Pier from the 1960s until 2000. The pier was first closed in 2000 when its owners went into liquidation, but it was reopened under new ownership in 2003, after Roger Stefani sold it on. However, safety concerns forced the pier to shut once more, and when it was gutted by fire in September 2008 it had been closed for almost two years. At that time, the owners, Simmo Developments, had submitted plans to convert the structure into an apartment complex. == 2008 fire == The 2008 Fleetwood Pier fire began during the early hours of 9 September 2008 and resulted in the pier's destruction. The fire was reported to the emergency services at 4:30am after a member of the public saw smoke rising from one of the buildings, and firefighters from Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service attended the scene. However, the pier was severely damaged.The remains of Fleetwood Pier in 2008 An investigation was put in place to determine the cause of the blaze. On 26 September 2008, Wyre Borough Council, citing safety concerns, announced that the pier would be completely demolished, within two to three weeks. On 10 October 2008 the Council confirmed that the pier would not be rebuilt. Plans for apartments on the site were approved in 2017, although only for 15 apartments for over-55s and some retail units, not for the full development of 85 apartments. == References  External links == * Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1910 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 2008 Category:Buildings and structures in Fleetwood Category:Piers in Lancashire Category:Tourist attractions in the Borough of Wyre ","title":"Fleetwood Pier"},{"id":"19245307","text":"Black Mesa may refer to: *A summit in Antarctica: **Black Mesa (Antarctica) *One of 41 summits in the United States: ","title":"List of peaks named Black Mesa"},{"id":"19245352","text":"Arthur Mitchell Wilson (24 August 1888 – 19 December 1947) DSO was a gynaecologist and obstetrician and an Australian rules footballer who played for the University Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Today it is popularly recognised also by non-Muslims as a neighbourhood in large cities and towns. Mahallas lie at the intersection of private family life and the public sphere. Important community-level management functions are performed through mahalle solidarity, such as religious ceremonies, life-cycle rituals, resource management and conflict resolution. It is an official administrative unit in many Middle Eastern countries. The word was brought to the Balkans through Ottoman Turkish mahalle, but it originates in Arabic محلة (mähallä), from the root meaning \\"to settle\\", \\"to occupy\\". In September 2017, a Turkish-based association referred to the historical mahalle by organizing a festival with the title \\"Mahalla\\" in the frame of parallel events of the 15th Istanbul Biennial. The festival in Istanbul features cultural initiatives of civil society and artists from the Middle East, Europe, the Balkans and Turkey. Against the background of the ongoing migration crisis, all participants of the festival focus their work using themes of hospitality, identity formation, homelessness, migration, fluctuation, the changing of an existing order and the dissolution of borders. The second Mahalla Festival took place 2018 in Valletta, Malta, in the frame of European Capital of Culture. ==Origins== Dabova Mahala, a mahala-turned- village in Montana Province, Bulgaria The word is used in many languages and countries to mean neighborhood or location and originated in Arabic (maḥalla), from the root meaning ‘to settle’, ‘to occupy’, derived from the verb halla (to untie), as in untying a pack horse or camel to make a camp. In ancient cultures, hospitality involved welcoming a stranger at the host location and offering him food, shelter and safety. That demonstration of hospitality centred on the belief that strangers should be assisted and protected while they travel. A mahala was a relatively-independent quarter of a larger village or a town, usually with its own school, religious building or buildings, mayor's representative etc. Mahalas are often named after the first settler or, when ethnically separate, according to the dominant ethnicity. In the Ottoman Empire, the \\"mahalle\\" was the smallest administrative entity. The mahalle was generally perceived to play an important role in identity formation, with the local mosque and the local coffee house as the main social gathering institutions. Mahalle lay at the intersection of private family life and the public sphere. Important community-level management functions were performed by mahalle solidarity, such as religious ceremonies, lifecycle rituals, resource management and conflict resolution.sözlük (vbulletin dictionary) Today, the mahalle is represented in the municipality and government by its muhtar. The muhtarlık, the office of the muhtar, has been designed as the smallest administrative office, with representative and enforcement powers at the local level. In some cases, however, the muhtar acts as not only the representative of the government towards the community but also the head of the community toward the government and subverts official government policies by intricate face-to-face mahalle-level relationships. ==Use of the termBangladesh=== A mahalla ( mo-hol-la), is an Islamic congregation or parish. Typically, a mahalla supports a single mosque. An imam is seen as the spiritual head of a mahalla. Mahallas are directly subordinate to a city or town, especially an electoral district, for ritual and representative purposes. Unlike a ward, it is an optional and non-elective unit of a city corporation or municipal corporation. Mahalla also means an urban neighbourhood. ===Bulgaria=== In Bulgaria, mahalas were historically considered a separate type of settlement administration on some occasions. In rural mountainous areas, villages were often scattered and consisted of relatively separate mahalas with badly developed infrastructure. Today, settlements are divided into towns or villages, and the official division of towns is into quarters. ===Greece=== In Greece mahalas (greek language: μαχαλάς) is considered a neighborhood. Sometimes it is considered a quarter of a small town or a gypsy neighborhood. ===Iran=== The \\"mahalle\\" is the smallest urban administrative division in Iran. Each city is divided into a few Mantaqes, (), which is then divided into Nahiyes (), further subdivided to Mahalle (), usually having a Mahalle council (), a quarter mosque, and a small parkette. ===Romania=== In Romanian, the word mahala has come to have the strictly negative or pejorative connotations of a slum or ghetto that are not present (or not as strongly implied as) in other languages. ===Russia and former Soviet Union=== A mahalla is an Islamic congregation or parish in Russia and a number of countries once part of the Soviet Union. Typically, mahallas support a single mosque. An imam is seen as the spiritual head of the mahalla. Mahallas are directly subordinate to a muhtasib and a territorial muhtasibat. ;Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan They were urban divisions in central Asian communities which today exist in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan. Historically, mahallas were autonomous social institutions built around familial ties and Islamic rituals. Before the establishment of the Soviet rule in central Asia, mahallas fulfilled local self-government functions connecting the private sphere with the public sphere. Religious rituals, life-cycle crisis ceremonies, resource management, conflict resolution, and many other community activities were performed at the mahalla, in other words, on the neighbourhood level. An informal council of elders, called oqsoqol (or \\"aksakal\\") provided leadership.Robert D. McChesney; Central Asia: Foundations of Change; Darwin Publishers; 1997; After their inclusion in the Soviet Union, informal mahalla organizations were placed under the state control and served as local extensions of the Soviet government. Mahallas were thought to be \\"eyes\\" and \\"ears\\" of the Soviet government; mahalla became a control mechanism of the state. Mahalla leaders were then appointed by the government. Mahalla level state-society relationships were more complex, however, as their leaders could serve as henchmen as well as act as buffers between the local community and the state. Due to intimate, face-to face relationships dominant at the mahalla level, mahalla organizations could often shield the community from the incursions of the state. Since 1993, the Uzbek government reorganized mahalla councils as bearers of \\"Uzbek nationhood\\" and \\"morality,\\" effectively reproducing Soviet style state domination over the society. Thus, they are formal structures run by committees and once again regulated by the government. Mahallas are a common unit not only in Uzbekistan, but in Tajikistani cities like Khujand and Kyrgyzstani cities like Osh. ===South Africa=== In South Africa, mahala is commonly used as a replacement for the word FREE ==In popular culture== *Mahallada duv-duv gap, a 1960 Uzbek comedy movie *\\"Viva Mahalla\\", a 2020 single by the Slovenian singer Senidah ==See also== * Mellah * Corjova, Dubăsari ===Notable incorporated mahallahs=== * Mohalla Sadiqabad, Pakistan * Shahi Mohalla, Pakistan * Mahala, Podgorica * El Mahalla El Kubra == References  * Abuses by Mahalla Committees, by Human Rights Watch *Timur Dadabaev, \\"Changing Nature of the Mahalla\\", in RICAS Newsletter, University of Tokyo, 2006, no. 15, Category:Government of the Ottoman Empire Category:Types of country subdivisions Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:Country subdivisions in Asia Category:Urban studies and planning terminology ","title":"Mahallah"},{"id":"19245466","text":"United Valleys () is a regionalist Italian political party active in the province of Trentino, Italy.

Louis Montoyer (1747, Mariemont, Austrian Netherlands, now Belgium - 5 June 1811, Vienna) was an 18th-century Belgian-Austrian architect, principally active in Brussels and Vienna. ==Life== He worked in Brussels as an architect and building contractor from 1778 onwards. Although he has been credited as the architect of the Royal Palace of Laeken (for Prince Albert of Saxony, Duke of Teschen and his wife Archduchess Maria-Christina), later research made clear he was merely executing the designs of other architects such as Charles de Wailly. In 1795 he came to Vienna with Prince Albert of Saxony, Duke of Teschen, who had already appointed him his court architect in 1780. There he first worked on rebuilding the duke's palace, now known as the Albertina. He also built the Ceremonial Hall at the Hofburg, connecting the Leopoldian part of the building with the old Imperial Palace.

Nichols wrote the play in 1979, after his now famous drama Privates On Parade was rejected by the Bristol Old Vic for being too controversial. Born In The Gardens was staged in the Theatre Royal (now the Bristol Old Vic) to celebrate its 200th anniversary. The cast for the premiere included Beryl Reid, Peter Bowles, Barry Foster and Jennie Linden and the production transferred to the Globe Theatre in London where it played for nine months. Reid won the Society of West End Theatre Award for Best Comedy Performance. A television version with Constance Chapman replacing Reid was shown in 1986. The play centres on an elderly Bristolian mother and son living in a crumbling Victorian manor house. The title comes from a sign in the Polar Bear enclosure in Bristol Zoological gardens and referred to a polar bear called Misha. It was revived by the Peter Hall Company in 2008, beginning a run at the Theatre Royal, Bath, before embarking on a national tour. Stephanie Cole starred as Maud, and the cast also included Simon Shepherd, Allan Corduner, and Miranda Foster. ==References== Category:1979 plays Category:Plays by Peter Nichols ","title":"Born in the Gardens"},{"id":"19245500","text":"Ken Mair is a New Zealand political activist and politician.

It is the first picture book biography of Superman creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, and is the first ever stand-alone biography of the pair. ==Synopsis== Jerome Siegel and Joseph Shuster are meek, bespectacled teens in Depression-era Cleveland who seek escape in the worlds of science fiction and pulp magazine adventure tales.Amazon.com \\"In a crowded high school hallway, Jerry wishes he could be with his 'friends,' and a turn of the page reveals Tarzan, Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers. Joe, 'lousy at sports and mousy around girls,' draws sci-fi heroes with a passion. In 1934, when both are 20, Jerry dreams up the Superman concept and Joe draws prototypes labeled 'S' for 'super.' And for 'Siegel' and 'Shuster.'\\" Publishers Weekly (June 23, 2008) It is four more years before they convince a publisher to take a chance on their character in the new comic book format. \\"In June 1938, their creation launches in Action Comics. Nobleman details this achievement with a zest amplified by MacDonald's punchy illustrations, done in a classic litho palette of brassy gold, antique blue and fireplug red. MacDonald's Depression-era vignettes picture Siegel pondering his superhero's powers and the friends casting a single, caped shadow. A cautionary afterword chronicles their protracted financial struggles with DC Comics--when Siegel and Shuster sold their first Superman story, they also sold all rights to the character, for $130.\\" ==Background== Nobleman revealed to Newsarama's Zack Smith that he first heard the origin story in high school, around 1988, but it wasn't until college graduation that he decided to write it up as a screenplay. However, warnings that the reclusive Siegel was unlikely to talk about Superman's beginnings discouraged Nobleman enough to give up the idea. He got into children's publishing, and a few years later decided to tell the story as a picture book.Newsarama He set a timeframe of about ten years, closing his tale before the bitter legal battles that ultimately separated the idealistic young creators from their creation. The writer wanted Boys of Steel to end on a high note, emphasizing the friendship and initial triumph of two Depression-era underdogs who wouldn't stop believing in Superman. While conducting his research, the writer was not able to contact the Siegel or Shuster families. Between published interviews with the creators (from which he cribbed his dialogue) and archival information gathered in Cleveland, Nobleman easily was able to build the framework for his version of the story. The search for an illustrator didn't commence for at least six months after Nobleman sold Boys of Steel to Random House in March '05. The publisher pitched MacDonald (Another Perfect Day), whose Art Deco style already was familiar to Nobleman. ===Praise=== \\"[T]his robust treatment does [Shuster and Siegel’s] story justice.\\" — Booklist, June 1, 2008 ===Trivia=== \\"I never say the word 'Superman,'\\" Nobleman pointed out. \\"I say the word 'Super,' but never 'Superman' in the story proper. It's a fun little trick about the power of observation and the power of picture books. I had an illustrator to show it, so I never had to say 'Superman' even once.\\" ==References *http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780375938023 *http://noblemania.blogspot.com/2008/08/first-boys-of-steel-interview.html *https://web.archive.org/web/20090106210533/http://www.earthsmightiest.com/books/new- childrens-book-tells-true-origin-of-superman/ Category:American picture books Category:Children's non-fiction books Category:2008 children's books Category:American biographies ","title":"Boys of Steel"},{"id":"19245527","text":"Big Brother Norge is the Norwegian version of reality TV show Big Brother that was aired from 2001 to 2003 on TV Norge for three moderately successful seasons.

The original housemates then had to decide whom of Natalie and Roy they wanted to keep in the house. Natalie was evicted. First victim of the public voting was Rebekka, who eventually made a return to the show as one of the twists of the season. When Per Morten made the shows only voluntary exit on Day 85 the audience had the chance to vote yet another former evictee back into the house. Since Rebekka already returned and Natalie not recognized as an official housemate by Big Brother (they put her profile off the homepage once she was evicted) the audience had to choose out of Trond, Mónica, Roy and Rodney. With massive support, the latest evictee Rodney was allowed to make a comeback. Two showmances had huge impact on the show since both resulting couples (Annette and Rodney; Anne Mona and Ramsy) remained in the house until the last week. However it was Lars Joakim Ringom who gained the most popularity and was crowned the winner of the season in a close vote beating runner-up Anita E. Sundt Olsen by 2% only. Both housemates have been quite popular and have never been nominated. Annette Young, who gained the 3rd runner-up position on final night, eventually became a co-host of future Big Brother Norge seasons. This was the first time that the rules of a Big Brother edition were changed to a minimum of three housemates being up for eviction on every nomination round in comparison to the usual two. === Nominations Table === Housemates nominate for 2 points (top of box) and 1 point (bottom of box) and the three or more housemates with the most nomination points face the public vote to evict. {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; line- height:15px; width:100%\\" ! style=\\"width:10%\\"  ! style=\\"width:10%\\"  Week 1 ! style=\\"width:10%\\"  Week 2 ! style=\\"width:10%\\"  Week 4 ! style=\\"width:10%\\"  Week 6 ! style=\\"width:10%\\"  Week 8 ! style=\\"width:10%\\"  Week 10 ! style=\\"width:10%\\"  Week 12 ! style=\\"width:10%\\"  Week 13 ! style=\\"width:10%\\" colspan=2  Week 14 Final - !

He was facing Eviction along with Anne Mona and Rebekka, but all votes for him were discounted and the Eviction left between Anne Mona and Rebekka, with Rebekka leaving after receiving 53% to Anne Mona's 47%.

Several season 1 housemates re-entered the house together with four new personalities: Annika, Christian, Claus and Leena, who competed to become a housemate on the shows next regular season. Since Claus made a voluntary exit halfway through the audience had to choose between the remaining three and voted Leena (real name: Lina) Breeke the winner who was therefore the first known housemate for the next season. The main highlight of the show was the wedding between season 1 houseguests Ramsy and Mona which marked the first time worldwide that a couple would marry inside a Big Brother house. Boyband Westlife made an appearance as live guests during the wedding and performed. ===Contestants=== { class= -  colspan=4  bgcolor=\\"#C0C0C0\\" Anonymous - ! Contestant ! Residence ! Occupation !

Juse like in the other year, two intruders made their way to the house on Day 2: Gro Anita and Espen. Both of them were automatically up for eviction, however, next to them two of the original housemates who received the most nominations, Jan Arne and Verónica were also in danger of leaving the house on what was a double elimination in the very first week. Jan Arne and Gro Anita, whose stay in the house only lasted for 2 days, got evicted. Although being elected by the public to enter the house, Lina found herself in the unlucky position to get nominated by Big Brother in week 2 and immediately getting the boot out of five nominated housemates. After 99 Days, Verónica Agnes Roso from Lørenskog was voted the winner over Espen Vesterdal Larsen and three others. Both Verónica and Espen have been up for eviction in the very first week and Verónica got nominated even 5 out of the 8 nomination rounds. === Nominations Table === {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:85%; line-height:15px; width:100%\\" ! style=\\"width:5%\\"  ! style=\\"width:5%\\"  Week 1 ! style=\\"width:5%\\"  Week 2 ! style=\\"width:5%\\"  Week 4 ! style=\\"width:5%\\"  Week 6 ! style=\\"width:5%\\"  Week 8 ! style=\\"width:5%\\"  Week 10 ! style=\\"width:5%\\"  Week 12 ! style=\\"width:5%\\"  Week 13 ! style=\\"width:5%\\" colspan=2  Week 14 Final - !

Running for only 69 days, it was the shortest main season of the show and saw a major twist in a house divide which was already used in several Big Brother versions worldwide before: The household was split into two parts with one living on the luxurious side of the house having access to privileges like a jacuzzi, hot water and comfort beds while the other side was lacking of all of this and was forced to live with basics only. In this edition, the audience got the chance to nominate their two most disliked housemates with the most vote getter receiving two, and the 2nd most vote getter receiving one point for nomination. Although lasting for only ten weeks the season saw the most voluntary exits in the history of Big Brother Norge with three male housemates walking and therefore making place for three replacement contestants. With 39.4% to win Eva Lill Baukhol triumphed over Halvor Kvikstad, who achieved 36.4% in a close race.

The executive producer is John Battsek. The film is a drama-documentary-animation hybrid which stars Pete Postlethwaite as a man living alone in a devastated world of 2055, watching archival film and asking \\"Why didn't we stop climate change when we had the chance?\\" The makers of The Age of Stupid were among the first to use the crowdfunding model and pioneered a new distribution system, Indie Screenings. ==Plot== The film is set in 2055, in a world ravaged by catastrophic climate change; London is flooded, Sydney is burning, Las Vegas has been swallowed up by desert, the Amazon rainforest has burnt up, snow has vanished from the Alps, and nuclear war has laid waste to India. An unnamed archivist (Pete Postlethwaite) is entrusted with the safekeeping of humanity's surviving store of art and knowledge. Alone in his vast repository off the coast of the largely ice-free Arctic, he reviews archival footage from back \\"when we could have saved ourselves\\", trying to discern where it all went wrong. Amid news reports of the gathering effects of climate change and global civilisation teetering towards destruction, he alights on six stories of individuals whose lives in the early years of the 21st century seem to illustrate aspects of the impending catastrophe. These six stories take the form of interweaving documentary segments that report on the lives of real people around the year 2008 and switch the film's narrative form from fiction to fact. In addition to the framing narrative in 2055, the news clips and the documentary footage of the six personal stories, the film includes animated segments and brief interviews with Mark Lynas and George Monbiot, created for the film. ==Release== Promotional image for the film showing Pete Postlethwaite at his archival computer. The film's UK premiere was on 15 March 2009 in London's Leicester Square. The screening was held in a solar-powered 'cinema tent' and conducted without use of mains electricity. An independent audit conducted by Carbon Accounting Systems found the event's carbon emissions to be 1% of those produced by a normal blockbuster premiere. Linked by satellite to 62 cinemas around the UK, the premiere received a Guinness World Record for being the largest film premiere ever, based on number of screens. During the post show discussion, which was broadcast live across the internet and at screenings, President Mohamed Nasheed received a standing ovation for announcing that the Maldives would be the world's first carbon neutral country. The film's star, Pete Postlethwaite, threatened to return his OBE if the UK government gave the go-ahead to the controversial Kingsnorth coal-fired power station in Kent. A month later the government announced a change to its policy on coal - no new coal-fired power station will get government consent unless it can capture and bury 25% of the emissions it produces immediately - and 100% of emissions by 2025. This, a source told The Guardian, represented \\"a complete rewrite of UK energy policy\\". The UK premiere received the accolades of 'Best Green Event' from Event Awards and best Live Brand Experience in the PR Week Awards. In the UK, The Age of Stupid was released in 62 cinemas in its opening week and hit the top of the box office charts (by screen average). The total run was 13 consecutive weeks, playing in 263 cinemas in all, with the longest single run being four weeks at London's Odeon Panton Street. The Age of Stupid was launched in Australia and New Zealand on 19 August 2009 with simultaneous green carpet premieres in Auckland and Sydney, linked by satellite to 32 cinemas in Australia and 13 in New Zealand. The film was then released in all 13 cinemas in New Zealand and many of the 32 in Australia. The film was released internationally on 21 September and 22 September 2009 at the \\"Global Premiere\\". A green carpet cinema tent in downtown New York, powered by locally sourced biodiesel, was linked by satellite to 442 cinemas across the USA and to more than 200 cinemas in more than 30 other countries, as well as another 33 countries which hosted independent screenings with no satellite link. Popular musicians Moby and Thom Yorke from Radiohead performed live. Special guests at the New York premier included Kofi Annan, Ed Miliband, Mohamed Nasheed, Rajendra Pachauri, Heather Graham, and Gillian Anderson. Pranksters, The Yes Men, walked up the green carpet in their \\"survivaballs\\". Many guests arrived by low-carbon transport, including sailboat, rowing boat, electric car, bicycle, cycle rickshaw, and rollerblades. In Germany, the film was premiered in Berlin and Hamburg on 1 June 2010, followed by a limited cinema release in 12 cities: Berlin, Bonn, Bremen, Frankfurt, Freiberg, Göttingen, Gütersloh, Hamburg, Hannover, München, Köln, Nürnberg, and Potsdam. The film had limited theatrical releases via distributors Mongrel Media in Canada and via Arts Alliance in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kosovo, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia, Moldova, Mozambique, Nepal, Netherlands, Nigeria, Norway, Palestinian Territories, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tanzania, Thailand, Turkey, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Vietnam and Zimbabwe. The film continues to be shown in local venues worldwide through Indie Screenings - a web-based form of film distribution, pioneered by Age of Stupids director Franny Armstrong, which allows anyone to buy a licence to hold a screening of the film and keep the profits for themselves. ==Reception== Writing for The Guardian, environmental activist George Monbiot, who appears in the film, said its \\"message, never stated but constantly emerging, is that we all have our self-justifying myths. We tell ourselves a story of our lives in which we almost always appear as the heroes. These myths prevent us from engaging with climate change.\\" The Financial Times critic described the film as intelligent and provoking, giving \\"The wisdom of hindsight, today\\". Time Out London film editor, Dave Calhoun, said, \\"Armstrong's prognosis is apocalyptic, but her journalism is solid, instructive and pleasingly thoughtful,\\" and described the film as \\"entertaining and provocative\\". The Times called the film \\"the most imaginative and dramatic assault on the institutional complacency shrouding the issue\\", saying, \\"The power of this shameless campaigning film is that it gives dates and deadlines. It explores options and ideas. It names culprits...\\" The Telegraph reviewer, Sukhdev Sandhu, said, \\"Bold, supremely provocative, and hugely important, [Armstrong's] film is a cry from the heart as much as a roar for necessary change.\\" Based on only 12 reviews Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 73%.. Retrieved 2010-07-13 The New York Times described the film as a \\"much sterner and more alarming polemic than An Inconvenient Truth\\". The review noted the \\"gallows humor\\" throughout the film, although the review was critical of the crude animated sequences. The Sydney Morning Herald described the film as \\"a wake-up call with an elegiac tone – not quite hectoring but pressing. This is about human nature, greed and personal responsibility. It aims to scare and galvanize – and it's pretty good at both.\\" William Nicholson, writer of Shadowlands (1985) and Gladiator (2000), said: \\"I hate this film. I felt as if I was watching all my own excuses for not doing anything about climate change being stripped away from me\\". ===Awards=== * Grierson:Sheffields Awards - Best Green Doc 2008 * Sunny Side of the Doc - Best Green Doc 2008 * Sunny Side of the Doc - Film Most Likely To Be Cinema Hit 2008 * Sunchild International Environmental Festival - First Prize * Birds Eye View Film Festival - Best Documentary 2009 * British Independent Film Awards – Best Documentary 2009 (nominated) ==Background== Shot in seven countries over a period of three years, the film features six documentary stories, archive footage, and much animation from, amongst others, Passion Pictures, creators of the Gorillaz animations. The original rough cut did not include the archivist, which was added later to frame the story and better tie together the six parts. ==Crowdfunding== Franny Armstrong adopted a new model to fund the production of The Age of Stupid: crowdfunding. The approach, now popular with independent filmmakers, involves the pooling of money and other resources to support efforts initiated by other people or organisations. Thusly, The Age of Stupids £450,000 budget was raised by selling \\"shares\\" to 223 individuals and groups who each donated between £500 and £35,000. These groups range from a hockey team to a health centre. Crowdfunding the film was done mostly to give it the best chance of reaching a mainstream multiplex audience, as well as to retain complete editorial control. These investors all own a percentage of the film and have received a pro-rata share in the profits, alongside the 105 crew members who worked for survival wages. In the Huffington Post, Jon Reiss described Armstrong’s approach as trailblazing: \\"the future of film, film culture and film distribution and marketing\\". He mentions that most of the budget, £857,000, was gathered \\"through direct contributions from their fans.\\" ==Production== A 55-minute documentary, The Making of The Age of Stupid, shows how the film was made. ==Carbon footprint== The producers calculated the carbon footprint of the film's production to be around 95 tonnes of CO2, and its promotion around 57 tonnes. ==Distribution== On 22 May 2009, The Age of Stupid team launched their Indie Screenings model, a new form of film distribution which allows anyone, anywhere to buy a licence to hold a screening of the film - with the price set according to the screener's means - and then, crucially, to charge for tickets and keep any profits for themselves. The launch on 22 May was held at The RSA, following which there was a webcast panel discussion with director Franny Armstrong, journalist George Monbiot, economist Nicholas Stern, and Met Office head of climate impacts Richard Betts. The panel discussion, organised by Indie Screenings, was screened at 71 locations. The Indie Screenings model immediately proved extremely popular, with 682 screenings booked in the first four months, generating more than £55,000. After the cost of writing the software was paid off, 100% of the proceeds went to pay back the crowdfunding investors. There were no wholesalers or resellers. ==Music == The soundtrack includes songs from Radiohead, Depeche Mode, Dragnerve and The Band of Holy Joy, as well as an original orchestral score written by Chris Brierley. ==The Stupid Show== To help demystify the geo-political intricacies surrounding climate change, The Age of Stupid team staged a guerrilla production from the Copenhagen United Nations Climate Change Conference (7 to 18 December 2009), called The Stupid Show. Franny Armstrong hosted the run of eight 40-60-minute shows which were broadcast live on the web daily from Friday 11 December until the final day of the conference, Saturday 19 December. Armstrong has described The Stupid Show as 'a budget version of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart but much sillier and more interactive'. The Stupid Show aimed to make the Copenhagen talks comprehensible to ordinary people using a mix of humour, stunts, video clips, graphic illustrations and interviews with delegates, climate change experts and activists billeted in the Danish capital Copenhagen for the summit. Highlights from the run included punditry from Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, an interview with author Naomi Klein, an interview with Ed Miliband conducted by Franny Armstrong whilst standing on her head, and a live link-up to an underwater camera in Belize which showed how climate change is devastating coral reefs. The production team consisted of nine people, all of whom worked with Armstrong on The Age of Stupid. Key members of The Stupid Show crew include producer Lizzie Gillett, writer Mark Lynas and editor Justin Badger. ==10:10== An offshoot of The Age of Stupid project is 10:10, a UK-wide campaign encouraging everyone in the United Kingdom to reduce their carbon emissions by at least 10% in 12 months. Franny Armstrong conceived the 10:10 campaign to complement the ongoing promotion of her film: while The Age of Stupid is primarily aimed at raising awareness of climate change as a pending global humanitarian crisis, 10:10 is presented as a strategy for people to take positive action in the face of such an urgent and daunting problem. ==See also== * Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction * Climate change in popular culture * Environmental migrant * Global catastrophic risk * List of crowdsourcing projects * Retreat of glaciers since 1850 * Six Degrees: Our Future on a Hotter Planet ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * * Category:2009 films Category:2009 documentary films Category:British films Category:British documentary films Category:Climate change films Category:Crowdfunded films Category:Documentary films about global warming Category:Environmental films Category:Dystopian films Category:Films set in 2055 Category:Films shot in Iraq ","title":"The Age of Stupid"},{"id":"19245671","text":"A partial molar property is a thermodynamic quantity which indicates how an extensive property of a solution or mixture varies with changes in the molar composition of the mixture at constant temperature and pressure. Essentially it is the partial derivative of the extensive property with respect to the amount (number of moles) of the component of interest. Every extensive property of a mixture has a corresponding partial molar property. ==Definition== Water and ethanol always have negative excess volumes when mixed, indicating the partial molar volume of each component is less when mixed than its molar volume when pure. The partial molar volume is broadly understood as the contribution that a component of a mixture makes to the overall volume of the solution. However, there is more to it than this: When one mole of water is added to a large volume of water at 25 °C, the volume increases by 18 cm3. The molar volume of pure water would thus be reported as 18 cm3 mol−1. However, addition of one mole of water to a large volume of pure ethanol results in an increase in volume of only 14 cm3. The reason that the increase is different is that the volume occupied by a given number of water molecules depends upon the identity of the surrounding molecules. The value 14 cm3 is said to be the partial molar volume of water in ethanol. In general, the partial molar volume of a substance X in a mixture is the change in volume per mole of X added to the mixture. The partial molar volumes of the components of a mixture vary with the composition of the mixture, because the environment of the molecules in the mixture changes with the composition. It is the changing molecular environment (and the consequent alteration of the interactions between molecules) that results in the thermodynamic properties of a mixture changing as its composition is altered If, by Z, one denotes a generic extensive property of a mixture, it will always be true that it depends on the pressure (P), temperature (T), and the amount of each component of the mixture (measured in moles, n). For a mixture with q components, this is expressed as :Z=Z(T,P,n_1,n_2,\\\\cdots). Now if temperature T and pressure P are held constant, Z=Z(n_1,n_2,\\\\cdots) is a homogeneous function of degree 1, since doubling the quantities of each component in the mixture will double Z. More generally, for any \\\\lambda: :Z(\\\\lambda n_1,\\\\lambda n_2, \\\\cdots)=\\\\lambda Z(n_1,n_2,\\\\cdots). By Euler's first theorem for homogeneous functions, this impliesWolfram Mathworld: Euler's homogeneous function theorem :Z=\\\\sum _{i=1}^q n_i \\\\bar{Z_i}, where \\\\bar{Z_i} is the partial molar Z of component i defined as: :\\\\bar{Z_i}=\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial Z}{\\\\partial n_i} \\\\right)_{T,P,n_{j eq i}}. By Euler's second theorem for homogeneous functions, \\\\bar{Z_i} is a homogeneous function of degree 0 which means that for any \\\\lambda : :\\\\bar{Z_i}(\\\\lambda n_1,\\\\lambda n_2,\\\\cdots )=\\\\bar{Z_i}(n_1,n_2,\\\\cdots ). In particular, taking \\\\lambda = 1/n_T where n_T=n_1+n_2+ \\\\cdots , one has :\\\\bar{Z_i}(x_1,x_2, \\\\cdots )=\\\\bar{Z_i}(n_1,n_2,\\\\cdots), where x_i=\\\\frac{n_i}{n_T} is the concentration expressed as the mole fraction of component i. Since the molar fractions satisfy the relation :\\\\sum _{i=1}^q x_i = 1, the xi are not independent, and the partial molar property is a function of only q-1 mole fractions: :\\\\bar{Z_i}=\\\\bar{Z_i}(x_1,x_2, \\\\cdots , x_{q-1}). The partial molar property is thus an intensive property - it does not depend on the size of the system. The partial volume is not the partial molar volume. ==Applications== Partial molar properties are useful because chemical mixtures are often maintained at constant temperature and pressure and under these conditions, the value of any extensive property can be obtained from its partial molar property. They are especially useful when considering specific properties of pure substances (that is, properties of one mole of pure substance) and properties of mixing (such as the heat of mixing or entropy of mixing). By definition, properties of mixing are related to those of the pure substances by: :\\\\Delta z^M=z-\\\\sum_i x_iz^*_i. Here * denotes a pure substance, M the mixing property, and z corresponds to the specific property under consideration. From the definition of partial molar properties, :z=\\\\sum_i x_i \\\\bar{Z_i}, substitution yields: :\\\\Delta z^M=\\\\sum_i x_i(\\\\bar{Z_i}-z_i^*). So from knowledge of the partial molar properties, deviation of properties of mixing from single components can be calculated. ==Relationship to thermodynamic potentials== Partial molar properties satisfy relations analogous to those of the extensive properties. For the internal energy U, enthalpy H, Helmholtz free energy A, and Gibbs free energy G, the following hold: :\\\\bar{H_i}=\\\\bar{U_i}+P\\\\bar{V_i}, :\\\\bar{A_i}=\\\\bar{U_i}-T\\\\bar{S_i}, :\\\\bar{G_i}=\\\\bar{H_i}-T\\\\bar{S_i}, where P is the pressure, V the volume, T the temperature, and S the entropy. ==Differential form of the thermodynamic potentials== The thermodynamic potentials also satisfy :dU= TdS-PdV+\\\\sum_i \\\\mu_i dn_i,\\\\, :dH= TdS+VdP+\\\\sum_i \\\\mu_i dn_i,\\\\, :dA=-SdT-PdV+\\\\sum_i \\\\mu_i dn_i,\\\\, :dG=-SdT+VdP+\\\\sum_i \\\\mu_i dn_i,\\\\, where \\\\mu_i is the chemical potential defined as (for constant nj with j≠i): :\\\\mu_i=\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial U}{\\\\partial n_i}\\\\right)_{S,V}=\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial n_i}\\\\right)_{S,P}=\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial n_i}\\\\right)_{T,V}=\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial n_i}\\\\right)_{T,P}. This last partial derivative is the same as \\\\bar{G_i}, the partial molar Gibbs free energy. This means that the partial molar Gibbs free energy and the chemical potential, one of the most important properties in thermodynamics and chemistry, are the same quantity. Under isobaric (constant P) and isothermal (constant T ) conditions, knowledge of the chemical potentials, \\\\mu_i(x_1,x_2,\\\\cdots , x_m), yields every property of the mixture as they completely determine the Gibbs free energy. ==Measuring partial molar properties== To measure the partial molar property \\\\bar{Z_1} of a binary solution, one begins with the pure component denoted as 2 and, keeping the temperature and pressure constant during the entire process, add small quantities of component 1; measuring Z after each addition. After sampling the compositions of interest one can fit a curve to the experimental data. This function will be Z(n_1). Differentiating with respect to n_1 will give \\\\bar{Z_1}. \\\\bar{Z_2} is then obtained from the relation: :Z=\\\\bar{Z_1}n_1+\\\\bar{Z_2}n_2. ==Relation to apparent molar quantities== The relation between partial molar properties and the apparent ones can be derived from the definition of the apparent quantities and of the molality. :\\\\bar{V_1}={}^\\\\phi\\\\tilde{V}_1 + b \\\\frac{\\\\partial {}^\\\\phi\\\\tilde{V}_1}{\\\\partial b}. The relation holds also for multicomponent mixtures, just that in this case subscript i is required. ==See also== *Apparent molar property *Ideal solution *Excess molar quantity *Partial specific volume *Thermodynamic activity ==References Further reading == * P.

The ship had been built as SS West Caruth, a cargo ship for the United States Shipping Board (USSB) shortly after the end of World War I. Shortly after completion, the ship was inspected by the United States Navy for possible use as USS West Caruth (ID-2850) but was neither taken into the Navy nor ever commissioned under that name. Before being sold to Japanese owners in 1928, she was also known as SS Exmoor and SS Antonio Tripcovich. West Caruth was built in 1918 for the USSB, as a part of the West boats, a series of steel-hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the World War I war effort, and was the second ship built at Southwestern Shipbuilding in San Pedro, California. After operating for four years under American registry, she was sold several times and operated under British, Italian, and Japanese registry throughout the remainder of her career. In November 1944, while serving as Japanese transport Seisho Maru during World War II, she was sunk by U.S. Navy submarine . == Design and construction == The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the USSB for emergency use during World War I.

West Caruth (Southwestern Shipbuilding No. 2) was launched at 08:00 on 31 December 1918 by sponsor Betty Howard, the nine-year-old daughter of company vice president, William F. Howard, and completed in February 1919. West Caruth was , and was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam. The ship had a single triple-expansion steam engine that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . == Career == West Caruth was inspected by the 12th Naval District of the United States Navy after completion for possible use as a service collier and was assigned the identification number of 3850. Had she been commissioned, she would have been known as USS West Caruth (ID-3850), but the Navy neither took over the ship nor commissioned her. The cargo ship sailed for the USSB under American registry for the first four years of her existence, and sailed to the west African ports of Dakar and Monrovia through 1921.For Monrovia, see, for example: For Dakar, see, for example: Also see: The Los Angeles Times reported that West Caruth sailed out of Los Angeles in both transpacific and European–Pacific service for two years. In 1923, West Caruth was sold to the North Devon Steamship Company and operated as tramp steamer Exmoor under the British flag. In 1924, she was purchased by the Tripcovich Shipping Company of Trieste and sailed under the Italian flag as Antonio Tripcovich. Four years later, she was renamed Seisho Maru as a part of Oguma Shoten Gomei Kaisha of Tsurumi under Japanese registry. By the early 1930s Seisho Maru had been sold to Mitsui Bussan Kaisho. There is scant record of the ship's movements under any of her later names. The Los Angeles Times reported her arrival at West Coast ports as Seisho Maru at least twice. In March 1930, the ship arrived at Tacoma, Washington, from Singapore to pick up a load of logs for export. Another notice in November 1933 noted her impending return to Los Angeles, where she was scheduled to take on a load of borax and scrap brass. In early May 1939, Seisho Maru ran aground in Tokyo Bay, but was refloated after several days. During World War II, Seisho Maru served as an army transport,Cressman, p. 275. but sources reporting her movements are incomplete. It is known that she was one of some 20 ships that departed Takau as part of three combined convoys—TASA-17, TE-03, and No. 82—in mid-April 1944. Seisho Maru and seven other ships formed convoy MI-27 which departed Moji for Miri, Borneo, on 15 November that same year. Escorted by a converted minesweeper () and three smaller escorts (Type D escort ship CD-134 and two s, CHa-156 and CHa-157), the convoy hugged the coast of the Korean peninsula to try to avoid American submarines. Nevertheless, a group of three submarines—, , and —found and attacked the convoy on the night of 17/18 November. Torpedoes from Sunfish sank and damaged Seisho Maru shortly after 22:00, while Peto sank Osakasan Maru at 23:40. At 01:30, the damaged Seisho Maru engaged in a gun battle with a surfaced submarine. Then, at 03:17, another spread of torpedoes from Sunfish finished off Seisho Maru, which sank at position in the East China Sea. also sank Chinaki Maru later that morning for a total loss of half the convoy ships. 412 soldiers and 36 crewmen were killed. == Notes  References  Bibliography == * * * Category:Design 1019 ships Category:Ships built in Los Angeles Category:1918 ships Category:World War I merchant ships of the United States Category:World War I auxiliary ships of the United States Category:World War II merchant ships of Japan Category:Ships sunk by American submarines Category:World War II shipwrecks in the East China Sea Category:Maritime incidents in 1939 Category:Maritime incidents in November 1944 ","title":"Seisho Maru"},{"id":"19245773","text":"\\"Two Solitudes\\" refers to a perceived lack of communication, and moreover a lack of will to communicate, between Anglophone and Francophone people in Canada.

E. J. Brouwer, a proponent of the constructivist school of intuitionism, opposed David Hilbert, a proponent of formalism. The debate concerned fundamental questions about the consistency of axioms and the role of semantics and syntax in mathematics. Much of the controversy took place while both were involved with the prestigious Mathematische Annalen journal, with Hilbert as editor-in- chief and Brouwer as a member of its editorial board. == Background == The background for the controversy was set with David Hilbert's axiomatization of geometry in the late 1890s. In his biography of Kurt Gödel, John W. Dawson, Jr summarizes the result as follows: \\"At issue in the sometimes bitter disputes was the relation of mathematics to logic, as well as fundamental questions of methodology, such as how quantifiers were to be construed, to what extent, if at all, nonconstructive methods were justified, and whether there were important connections to be made between syntactic and semantic notions.\\"Dawson 1997:48 Dawson observes that \\"partisans of three principal philosophical positions took part in the debate\\" – the logicists (Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell), the formalists (David Hilbert and his \\"school\\" of collaborators), and the constructivists (Henri Poincaré and Hermann Weyl); within this constructivist school was the radical self-named \\"intuitionist\\" L.E.J. Brouwer. === Brief history of Brouwer and Intuitionism === Brouwer in effect founded the mathematical philosophy of intuitionism as a challenge to the then-prevailing formalism of David Hilbert and his collaborators Paul Bernays, Wilhelm Ackermann, John von Neumann and others.cf. Kleene (1952), pp. 46–59 As a variety of constructive mathematics, intuitionism is essentially a philosophy of the foundations of mathematics. It is sometimes and rather simplistically characterized by saying that its adherents refuse to use the law of excluded middle in mathematical reasoning. In 1908: \\"... Brouwer, in a paper entitled \\"The untrustworthiness of the principles of logic\\", challenged the belief that the rules of the classical logic, which have come down to us essentially from Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) have an absolute validity, independent of the subject matter to which they are applied\\".Kleene (1952), p. 46 \\"After completing his dissertation (1907: see Van Dalen), Brouwer made a conscious decision temporarily to keep his contentious ideas under wraps and to concentrate on demonstrating his mathematical prowess\\" (Davis (2000), p. 95); by 1910 he had published a number of important papers, in particular the Fixed Point Theorem. Hilbert – the formalist with whom the intuitionist Brouwer would ultimately spend years in conflict – admired the young man and helped him receive a regular academic appointment (1912) at the University of Amsterdam.Davis, p. 96 It was then that \\"Brouwer felt free to return to his revolutionary project which he was now calling intuitionism\\". In the later 1920s, Brouwer became involved in a public and demeaning controversy with Hilbert over editorial policy at Mathematische Annalen, at that time a leading learned journal.Cf. . He became relatively isolated; the development of intuitionism at its source was taken up by his student Arend Heyting. ===Origins of disagreement=== The nature of Hilbert's proof of the Hilbert basis theorem (dating from 1888) turned out to be more controversial than Hilbert could have imagined at the time. Although Kronecker had conceded, Hilbert would later respond to others' similar criticisms that \\"many different constructions are subsumed under one fundamental idea\\" — in other words (to quote Reid): \\"Through a proof of existence, Hilbert had been able to obtain a construction\\"; \\"the proof\\" (i.e. the symbols on the page) was \\"the object\\".Reid 1996, p. 37 Not all were convinced. While Kronecker would die soon after, his constructivist banner would be carried forward by sharp criticism from Poincaré, and later in full cry by the young Brouwer and his developing intuitionist \\"school\\"—Weyl in particular, much to Hilbert's torment in his later years (Reid 1996, pp. 148–149). Indeed, Hilbert lost his \\"gifted pupil\\" Weyl to intuitionism: \\"Hilbert was disturbed by his former student's fascination with the ideas of Brouwer, which aroused in Hilbert the memory of Kronecker.\\"Reid 1996, p. 148 Brouwer the intuitionist in particular objected to the use of the Law of Excluded Middle over infinite sets (as Hilbert had indeed used it). Hilbert would respond: \\"'Taking the Principle of the Excluded Middle from the mathematician ... is the same as ... prohibiting the boxer the use of his fists.'This quote appears in numerous sources. A translation of the original can be found in van Heijenoort: Hilbert (1927) p. 476 and reads as follows: \\"Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would be the same, say, as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to the boxer the use of his fists. To prohibit existence statements and the principle of excluded middle is tantamount to relinquishing the science of mathematics altogether.\\" \\"The possible loss did not seem to bother Weyl.\\"Reid 1996, p. 150 ===Validity of the law of excluded middle=== In the same paper – the text of an address delivered in 1927cf. van Heijenoort: Hilbert (1927) – Hilbert clearly expresses himself. At first he attempts to defend his axiomatic system as having \\"important general philosophical significance\\".van Heijenoort: Hilbert 1927 p. 475 For him, the statement of \\"definite rules\\" expresses \\"the technique of our thinking\\". Nothing is hidden, no tacit assumptions are admitted: \\"after all, it is part of the task of science to liberate us from arbitrariness, sentiment and habit, and to protect us from the subjectivism that ... finds its culmination in intuitionism\\". But then Hilbert gets to the nub of it – the proscription of the law of excluded middle (LoEM): :\\"Intuitionism's sharpest and most passionate challenge is the one it flings at the validity of the principle of excluded middle ... .\\" To doubt the LoEM—when extended over the completed infinite—was to doubt Hilbert's axiomatic system, in particular his \\"logical ε-axiom\\".He presents the ε-axiom in his 1927 address/paper. This \\"existence\\"-axiom asserts the existence of an object of discourse: \\"A(a) → A(ε(A)). Here ε(A) stands for an object of which the proposition A(a) certainly holds if it holds of any object at all ... .\\"(van Heijenoort p. 466). Immediately he goes on to demonstrate how the notions \\"for all\\" (the modern universal quantifier \\"∀\\") and \\"there exists\\" (the modern existential quantifier \\"∃\\") derive from this axiom. To take away the LoEM was to destroy the \\"science of mathematics\\". Finally, Hilbert singles out one man—by implication, not by name—for the cause of his present tribulation: \\"... I am astonished that a mathematician should doubt that the principle of excluded middle is strictly valid as a mode of inference. I am even more astonished that, as it seems, a whole community of mathematicians who do the same has so constituted itself. I am most astonished by the fact that even in mathematical circles the power of suggestion of a single man, however full of temperament and inventiveness, is capable of having the most improbable and eccentric effects.\\"van Heijenoort: Hilbert 1927 p. 476 Brouwer answers pique with pique: \\"... formalism has received nothing but benefactions from intuitionism and may expect further benefactions. The formalistic school should therefore accord some recognition to intuitionism, instead of polemicizing against it in sneering tones, while not even observing proper mention of authorship.\\"van Heijenoort: Brouwer 1927b published in 1928, p. 492 == Deeper philosophic differences  A philosophical defeat in the quest for \\"truth\\" in the choice of axioms === However \\"truth\\" is ultimately defined, for a few mathematicians Hilbert's formalism seemed to eschew the notion. And at least with respect to his choice of axioms the case can be made that indeed he does eschew the notion. The fundamental issue is just how does one choose \\"the axioms\\"? Until Hilbert proposed his formalism, the axioms were chosen on an \\"intuitive\\" (experiential) basis. Aristotelian logic is a good example – based on one's life-experiences it just seems \\"logical\\" that an object of discourse either has a stated property (e.g. \\"This truck is yellow\\") or it does not have that property (\\"This truck is not yellow\\") but not both simultaneously (the Aristotelian Law of Non-Contradiction). The primitive form of the induction axiom is another – if a predicate P(n) is true for n = 0 and if for all natural numbers n, if P(n) being true implies that P(n+1) is true, then P(n) is true for all natural numbers n. Hilbert's axiomatic system – his formalism – is different. At the outset it declares its axioms.Hilbert's writing is clean and accessible: for a list of his axioms and his \\"construction\\" see the first pages of van Heijenoort: Hilbert (1927). But he doesn't require the selection of these axioms to be based upon either \\"common sense\\", a priori knowledge (intuitively derived understanding or awareness, innate knowledge seen as \\"truth without requiring any proof from experience\\"Bertrand Russell 1912: 74 ), or observational experience (empirical data). Rather, the mathematician in the same manner as the theoretical physicistOne of Hilbert's problems for the twentieth century was to \\"axiomatize physics\\" presumably in the same way he was attempting to \\"axiomatize\\" mathematics.Weyl in his 1927 comments on Hilbert's address discusses theoretical physics as a science with \\"individual assumptions and laws [that] have no meaning that can immediately be realized in intuition...](van Heijenoort p. 484) is free to adopt any (arbitrary, abstract) collection of axioms that they so choose. Indeed, Weyl asserts that Hilbert had \\"formaliz[ed] it [classical mathematics], thus transforming it in principle from a system of intuitive results into a game with formulas that proceeds according to fixed rules\\".van Heijenoort p. 483 So, Weyl asks, what might guide the choice of these rules? \\"What impels us to take as a basis precisely the particular axiom system developed by Hilbert?\\". Weyl offers up \\"consistency is indeed a necessary but not sufficient condition\\" but he cannot answer more completely except to note that Hilbert's \\"construction\\" is \\"arbitrary and bold\\". Finally he notes, in italics, that the philosophical result of Hilbert's \\"construction\\" will be the following: \\"If Hilbert's view prevails over intuitionism, as appears to be the case, then I see in this a decisive defeat of the philosophical attitude of pure phenomenology, which thus proves to be insufficient for the understanding of creative science even in the area of cognition that is most primal and most readily open to evidence – mathematics.\\" In other words: the role of innate feelings and tendencies (intuition) and observational experience (empiricism) in the choice of axioms will be removed except in the global sense – the \\"construction\\" had better work when put to the test: \\"only the theoretical system as a whole ... can be confronted with experience\\". === The Law of Excluded Middle extended to the infinite === Cantor (1897) extended the intuitive notion of \\"the infinite\\" – one foot placed after the other in a never-ending march toward the horizon – to the notion of \\"a completed infinite\\" – the arrival \\"all the way, way out there\\" in one fell swoop, and he symbolized this notion with a single sign ℵ0 (aleph-null). Hilbert's adoption of the notion wholesale was \\"thoughtless\\", Brouwer believed. Brouwer in his (1927a) \\"Intuitionistic reflections on formalism\\" states: \\"SECOND INSIGHT The rejection of the thoughtless use of the logical principle of the excluded middle, as well as the recognition, first, of the fact that the investigation of the question why the principle mentioned is justified and to what extent it is valid constitutes an essential object of research in the foundations of mathematics, and, second, of the fact that in intuitive (contentual) mathematics this principle is valid only for finite systems. THIRD INSIGHT. The identification of the principle of excluded middle with the principle of the solvability of every mathematical problem\\".van Heijenoort, p. 491 This Third Insight is referring to Hilbert's second problem and Hilbert's ongoing attempt to axiomatize all of arithmetic, and with this system, to discover a \\"consistency proof\\" for all of mathematics – see more below. So into this fray (started by Poincaré) Brouwer plunged head-long, with Weyl as back-up. Their first complaint (Brouwer's Second Insight, above) arose from Hilbert's extension of Aristotle's \\"Law of Excluded Middle\\" (and \\"double negation\\") – hitherto restricted to finite domains of Aristotelian discourse – to infinite domains of discourseSee the lead paragraphs of van Heijenoort: Brouwer (1923b) p. 335.\\". In the late 1890s Hilbert successfully axiomatized geometry.Breger states that \\"Modern mathematics starts with Hilbert's Grundlagen der Geometrie\\" (p. 226). Then he went on to successfully (or so Hilbert thought) use the Cantorian-inspired notion of the completed infinity to produce elegant, radically abbreviated proofs in analysis (1896 and afterwards).Brouwer baldly itemizes the many other places where he thinks Hilbert has gone wrong, cf. van Heijenoort p. 491–492. In his own words of defense Hilbert believed himself quite justified in what he had done (in the following he calls this type of proof an existence proof): \\"...I stated a general theorem (1896) on algebraic forms that is a pure existence statement and by its very nature cannot be transformed into a statement involving constructibility. Purely by use of this existence theorem I avoided the lengthy and unclear argumentation of Weierstrass and the highly complicated calculations of Dedekind, and in addition, I believe, only my proof uncovers the inner reason for the validity of the assertions adumbrated by GaussThis is a sly poke at the finitists: \\"Empiricist philosophers, such as Hobbes, Locke, and Hume, had convinced some mathematicians, such as Gauss, that there is no infinite in mathematics\\" (Anglin p. 213). and formulated by Weierstrass and Dedekind.\\"Anglin, p. 474 \\"The value of pure existence proofs consists precisely in that the individual construction is eliminated by them and that many different constructions are subsumed under one fundamental idea, so that only what is essential to the proof stands out clearly; brevity and economy of thought are the raison d'être of existence proofs.\\"Anglin, p. 475 What Hilbert had to give up was \\"constructibility\\" – his proofs would not produce \\"objects\\" (except for the proofs themselves – i.e. symbol strings), but rather they would produce contradictions of the premises and have to proceed by reductio ad absurdum extended over the infinite. === Hilbert's quest for a generalized proof of consistency of the axioms of arithmetic === Brouwer viewed this loss of constructibility as bad, but worse when applied to a generalized \\"proof of consistency\\" for all of mathematics. In his 1900 address Hilbert had specified, as the second of his 23 problems for the twentieth century, the quest for a generalized proof of (procedure for determining) the consistency of the axioms of arithmetic. Hilbert, unlike Brouwer, believed that the formalized notion of mathematical induction could be applied in the search for the generalized consistency proof. A consequence of this marvelous proof/procedure P would be the following: Given any arbitrary mathematical theorem T (formula, procedure, proof) put to P (thus P(T)) including P itself (thus P(P)), P would determine conclusively whether or not the theorem T (and P) was provable – i.e. derivable from its premises, the axioms of arithmetic. Thus for all T, T would be provable by P or not provable by P and under all conditions (i.e. for any assignment of numerical values to T's variables). This is a perfect illustration of the use of the Law of Excluded Middle extended over the infinite, in fact extended twice – first over all theorems (formulas, procedures, proofs) and secondly for a given theorem, for all assignment of its variables. This point, missed by Hilbert, was first pointed out to him by Poincaré and later by Weyl in his 1927 comments on Hilbert's lecture: \\"For after all Hilbert, too, is not merely concerned with, say 0' or 0' ', but with any 0' ... ', with an arbitrarily concretely given numeral. One may here stress the \\"concretely given\\"; on the other hand, it is just as essential that the contentual arguments in proof theory be carried out in hypothetical generality, on any proof, on any numeral. ... It seems to me that Hilbert's proof theory shows Poincaré to have been completely right on this point.\\"Weyl 1927, van Heijenoort p. 483 In his discussion preceding Weyl's 1927 comments van Heijenoort explains that Hilbert insisted that he had addressed the issue of \\"whether a formula, taken as an axiom, leads to a contradiction, the question is whether a proof that leads to a contradiction can be presented to me\\".Weyl 1927, van Heijenoort p. 481 : \\"But [writes van Heijenoort] in a consistency proof the argument does not deal with one single specific formula; it has to be extended to all formulas. This is the point that Weyl has in mind ... .\\"Nagel and Newman note: \\"In the various attempts to solve the problem of consistency there is one persistent source of difficulty. It lies in the fact that the axioms are interpreted by models composed of an infinite number of elements. This makes it impossible to encompass the models in a finite number of observations . . . the conclusion that the argument seeks to establish involves an extrapolation from a finite to an infinite set of data. How can we justify this jump? ... Unfortunately, most of the postulate systems that constitute the foundations of important branches of mathematics cannot be mirrored in finite models.\\" Nagel and Newman go on to give the example of the successor function ' (Gödel used f, the old-English symbol for s) – given starting-point 0, thereafter 0', 0, etc creates the infinity of integers. (p. 21–22) In response to this, Hilbert attempted an absolute proof of consistency – it would not presume the consistency of another system outside the one of interest, but rather, the system would begin with a [finite] collection of strings of discrete symbols (the axioms) and formation rules to manipulate those symbols. (cf p. 26ff)\\" If successful the quest would result in a remarkable outcome: Given such a generalized proof, all mathematics could be replaced by an automaton consisting of two parts: (i) a formula-generator to create formulas one after the other, followed by (ii) the generalized consistency proof, which would yield \\"Yes – valid (i.e. provable)\\" or \\"No – not valid (not provable)\\" for each formula submitted to it (and every possible assignment of numbers to its variables). In other words: mathematics would cease as a creative enterprise and become a machine.Breger notes: \\"Poincaré was not the only one to compare mathematics to a machine without an operator ... Frege claimed that he could not find out by Hilbert's axioms [of geometry] whether his watch fob was a point or not.\\" (p. 227) === The problem of the Law of Excluded Middle with respect to induction === In van Heijenoort's commentary preceding Weyl's (1927) \\"Comments on Hilbert's second lecture on the foundations of mathematics\\" Poincaré points out to Hilbert (1905) that there are two types of \\"induction\\" (1) the intuitive animal-logic foot-following-foot version that gives us a sense that there's always another footstep after the last footstep, and (2) the formal version – e.g. Peano's version: a string of symbols.cf Russell 1912's chapter VI Induction p.60–69, where he discusses animal logic and the problem of knowing a truth and formulating natural laws. The gang of three – Poincaré, Weyl and Brouwer – claimed that Hilbert tacitly, and unjustifiably, adopted as one of his premises formal induction (the Kleensymbol string). Poincaré (1905) asserted that, by doing this, Hilbert's reasoning became circular.cf. van Heijenoort's commentary on Weyl (1927). Weyl's (1927) agreement and Brouwer's polemics ultimately forced Hilbert and his disciples Herbrand, Bernays and Ackermann to reexamine their notion of \\"induction\\" – to eschew the assumption of a \\"totality of all the objects x of an infinite collection\\" and (intuitionistically) assume that the general argument proceeds one x after another, ad infinitum (van Heijenoort p. 481, footnote a). This is in fact the so-called \\"induction schema\\" used in the notion of \\"recursion\\" that was still in development at this time (cf. van Heijenoort p. 493)\\"Recursion\\" had been around at least since Peano provided his definition of the addition of numbers (cf. van Heijenoort p. 95, Definition 18). – this schema was acceptable to the intuitionists because it had been derived from \\"the intuition\\". To carry this distinction further, Kleene 1952/1977 distinguishes between three types of mathematical induction – (1) the formal Induction Rule (Peano's axiom, see the next section for an example), (2) the inductive definition (examples: counting, \\"Proof by induction\\"), and (3) the definition by induction (recursive definition of \\"number-theoretic functions or predicates). With regards to (3), Kleene considers primitive recursive functions: === Echoes of the controversy === Brouwer's insistence on \\"constructibility\\" in the search for a \\"consistency proof for arithmetic\\" resulted in sensitivity to the issue as reflected by the work of Finsler and Gödel.Dawson notes that \\"Brouwer's role in stimulating Gödel's thought seems beyond doubt, [but] how Gödel became aware of Brouwer's work remains uncertain\\" (Dawson 1997:55). Ultimately Gödel would \\"numeralize\\" his formulae; Gödel then used primitive recursion (and its instantiation of the intuitive, constructive form of induction – i.e. counting and step-by-step evaluation) rather than a string of symbols that represent formal induction. Gödel was so sensitive to this issue that he took great pains in his 1931 to point out that his Theorem VI (the so-called \\"First incompleteness theorem\\") \\"is constructive;45a, that is, the following has been proved in an intuitionistically unobjectionable manner ... .\\" He then demonstrates what he believes to be the constructive nature of his \\"generalization formula\\" 17 Gen r. Footnote 45a reinforces his point. Gödel's 1931 does include the formalist's symbol-version of the Peano Induction Axiom; it looks like this, where \\".\\" is the logical AND, f is the successor-sign, x2 is a function, x1 is a variable, x1Π designates \\"for all values of variable x1\\": : (x2(0).x1Π(x2(x1)⊃x2(fx1))⊃x1Π(x2(x1)) But he does not appear to use this in the formalist's sense. Note that there is contention around this point. Gödel specifies this symbol string in his I.3.,p. 600 in van Heijenoort i.e. the formalized inductive axiom appears as shown above – yet even this string can be \\"numeralized\\" using Gödel's method. On the other hand, he doesn't appear to use this axiom. Rather, his recursion steps through integers assigned to variable k (cf his (2) on page 602). His skeleton-proof of Theorem V, however, \\"use(s) induction on the degree of φ\\", and uses \\"the induction hypothesis\\". Without a full proof of this, we are left to assume that his use of the \\"induction hypothesis\\" is the intuitive version, not the symbolic axiom. His recursion simply steps up the degree of the functions, an intuitive act, ad infinitum. But Nagel and Newman note that Gödel's proofs are infinitary in nature,cf Nagel and Newman p. 98 not finitary as Hilbert requested (see Hilbert's second problem) while Gödel insisted that they are intuitionistically satisfactory. These are not incompatible truths, as long as the LoEM over the infinite isn't invoked anywhere in the proofs. Despite the last-half-twentieth century's continued abstraction of mathematics,Anglin says it this way: \\"In the twentieth century, there was a great deal of concrete, practical mathematics. ... On the other hand, much twentieth century mathematics was characterized by a degree of abstraction never seen before. It was not the Euclidean plane that was studied, but the vector spaces and topological spaces which are abstractions of it. It was not particular groups that were studied so much as the whole 'category' of groups.\\" (Anglin 1994:217) the issue has not entirely gone away. Here are two examples. First, the premises of an argument – even ones considered beyond questioning – are always fair game. A hard look at the premises of Turing's 1936–1937 work led Robin Gandy (1980) to propose his \\"principles for mechanisms\\" that throw in the speed of light as a constraint. Secondly, Breger (2000) in his \\"Tacit Knowledge and Mathematical Progress\\" delves deeply into the matter of \\"semantics versus syntax\\" – in his paper Hilbert, Poincaré, Frege, and Weyl duly make their appearances. He examines a core problem: in axiomatic proofs the tacit assumption of an experienced, thinking mind: to be successful it must come to the argument equipped with prior knowledge of the symbols and their use (the semantics behind the mindless syntax): \\"Mathematics as a purely formal system of symbols without a human being possessing the know-how for dealing with the symbols is impossible [according to the chemist Polanyi (1969, 195), the ideal of a form of knowledge that is strictly explicit is contradictory because without tacit knowledge all formulas, words, and illustrations would become meaningless]\\" (brackets in the original, Breger 2000:229). ==Kleene on Brouwer–Hilbert== A serious study of this foundational controversy can be found in Stephen Kleene's Introduction to Metamathematics, particularly in Chapter III: A critique of mathematical reasoning. He discusses §11. The paradoxes, §12. First inferences from the paradoxes [impredicative definitions, Logicism etc.], §13. Intuitionism, §14. Formalism, §15. Formalization of a theory. Kleene takes the debate seriously, and throughout his book he actually builds the two \\"formal systems\\", e.g. on page 119 he shows those logical laws such as double negation that are disallowed in the intuitionist system. == Notes  Bibliography == * W.S.

The site is open to the public; it is dominated by a large, rectangular plaza with several pyramidal structures and platforms, along with a massive ball court. To the north of the structures is a field of boulders with thousands of glyphs carved into them. The original settlement was considerably larger, with a large, circular structure called El Cajete marking its eastern extent. According to INAH, site remains and evidence confirms the influence of many cultures merging on this site, although it is not certainly known who constructed this city, INAH believes the hunter-gatherer Chichimecas inhabited the Bajio region at the end of the postclassical period, and that many other sedentary culturesBrambila, 1993 lived here before, but these cultures are not mentioned nor identified. Plazuelas (600-900 CE) is located in the same Municipality as the Barajas (archaeological site) (? – 1000 CE) and some 46 kilometers (28.6 mi.) west of Peralta (100 – 900 CE), and share similar settlement mesoamerican classical period, hence it is possible that these three cities shared constructors, inhabitants, religion, governments and traded as part of a common “Bajio Tradition”. Very little is known about these societies inhabiting the Bajio Region, they are thought to have been members of hunter- gatherer, fishing Chichimec groups, it is now known that these places were trading confluence routes between central Mexico with northern and western Mesoamerica. Over 1400 years ago, in addition to Plazuelas, there were other five known important cities in the region; San Bartolome (Tzchté), San Miguel Viejo, Tepozán, Loza Los Padres and Peralta (Mesoamerican site). Circular structures confirm the Tradition constant ancient relations with other civilizations. Circular structures are common across prehispanic Mesoamerica. ==Background== Ballgame court viewed from the south The area north of the Lerma River, is presumed to have been originally occupied by hunter-gatherer nomadic groups, the surrounding area city construction was probably made by late occupants. Characteristics indicate that these constructions were sedentary establishments. Lifestyles and social characteristics follow the Mesoamerican model. It is estimated that the site was abandoned around year 1000 CE. In prehispanic times, the Bajio region saw the most human development due to the fertility of the soil and the presence of surface water for agriculture. The oldest group to inhabit the area are called the Chupícuarios, who dominated the center of the Bajío area and were active in between 800 BCE and 300 CE. Their largest city is now the site called Chupícuaro, and their influence was widespread being found in the modern states of Zacatecas, Querétaro, Colima, Nayarit, Hidalgo, State of Mexico, Michoacán and Guerrero. Chupícuaro cities were associated with the Toltec city of Tula and when this city fell, these agricultural cities of Guanajuato also went into decline.Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 30 This and a prolonged drought cause these cities to be abandoned between the 10th and 11th centuries with only the Guamares left ethnically. Then Chichimeca and other nomadic groups entered the area. These nomadic indigenous groups are generically referred to as Chichimeca, but in reality they were a variety of ethnicities such as the Guachichiles, Pames and Zacatecos. These groups were warriors, semi nomadic and did not practice significant agriculture, nor did they construct cities. Part of the state was also inhabited by the Otomi but they were mostly displaced or dominated by the Purépecha in the southwest and the Chichimeca in other parts. By the 16th century, most of Mesoamerica was dominated by either the Aztec Empire or Purépecha Empire, but Guanajuato was under the control of neither. It was on the northern border of the Purépecha Empire with southern Guanajuato showing significant cultural influence in the southern valleys, and Aztecs had ventured into the area looking for minerals. However, most of the state was dominated by various Chichimeca tribes as part of what the Spanish would call the “Gran Chichimeca.” These Chichimeca were mostly nomadic with some scattered agricultural communities, mostly in the north. Northern Mexico has been studied by Pedro Armillas (1964, 1969), Braniff (1989, 1994). More recent archaeological has been made by France, with research periods in 1998, 1999 and 2000. ===Bajio Tradition=== Casas Tapadas complex, southern entrance Not too long ago, the Bajio Region and a good part of the Mexican central plateau were considered of little archaeological interest. Little was known of native regional societies, beyond the historical data describing an almost uninhabited area two centuries before the conquest. Data from historical documents indicated that the prehispanic Bajio inhabitants were only Chichimeca, nomadic groups with appropriation economies and belligerents. By 1972, Beatriz Braniff began to explain the Bajio cultures and proposed the contours of a \\"marginal\\" region of Mesoamerica, located on the edges of the high cultured regions The apparent influence of large Mesoamerican cities, mainly Teotihuacan in regional development, also departed from the academic debate the possibility of identifying and explaining the specific role played by local societies in the Mesoamerican development. During the last ten years, archaeological studies have had a major boost in Guanajuato, and several myths of the Bajio past became truth, have provided better founded explanations based on the prehispanic life in this geographic area. Three aspects seem fundamental: a) the Bajio as an important part of the Mesoamerican universe was a trade communication region and a link between three the cultural areas proposed by Paul Kirchhoff (1967): Central, North and West Mexico; b) theories based on influences determination from major population centers, has now been replaced by understanding the interactions and bi-directional relationships, where the implications of local societies such as Peralta have barely been addressed but no doubt will continue to investigate; c) during the mesoamerican classical period, between 300 and 700 CE, the Bajio developed a notable agricultural population, with a social and political organization structure, in addition to its deep regional cultural roots, that has been identified as the Bajio tradition. ===Chichimeca=== Chichimeca was the name that the Nahua peoples of Mexico generically applied to a wide range of semi- nomadic peoples who inhabited the north of modern-day Mexico and southwestern United States, and carried the same sense as the European term \\"barbarian\\". The name was adopted with a pejorative tone by the Spaniards when referring especially to the semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer peoples of northern Mexico. In modern times only one ethnic group is customarily referred to as Chichimecs, namely the Chichimeca Jonaz, although lately this usage is being changed for simply \\"Jonáz\\" or their own name for themselves \\"Úza\\". The Chichimeca peoples were in fact many different groups with varying ethnic and linguistic affiliations. As the Spaniards worked towards consolidating the rule of New Spain over the Mexican indigenous peoples during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the \\"Chichimecan tribes\\" maintained a resistance. A number of ethnic groups of the region allied against the Spanish, and the following military colonization of northern Mexico has become known as the \\"Chichimeca Wars\\". Many of the peoples called Chichimeca are virtually unknown today; few descriptions mention them and they seem to have been absorbed into mestizo culture or into other indigenous ethnic groups. For example, virtually nothing is known about the peoples referred to as Guachichiles, Caxcanes, Zacatecos, Tecuexes, or Guamares. Others like the Opata or \\"Eudeve\\" are well described but extinct as a people. Other \\"Chichimec\\" peoples maintain a separate identity into the present day, for example the Otomies, Chichimeca Jonaz, Coras, Huicholes, Pames, Yaquis, Mayos, O'odham and the Tepehuánes. The first description of a modern objective ethnography of the peoples inhabiting La Gran Chichimeca was done by Norwegian naturalist and explorer Carl Sofus Lumholtz in 1890 when he traveled on mule through northwestern Mexico, meeting the indigenous peoples on friendly terms. With his descriptions of the rich and different cultures of the various \\"uncivilized\\" tribes, the picture of the uniform Chichimec barbarians was changed, although in Mexican Spanish the word \\"Chichimeca\\" remains connected to an image of \\"savagery\\". The historian Paul Kirchhoff, in his work \\"The Hunting-Gathering People of North Mexico,\\" described the Chichimecas as sharing a hunter-gatherer culture, based on the gathering of mesquite, agave, and tunas (the fruit of the nopal). While others also lived off of acorns, roots and seeds. In some areas, the Chichimecas cultivated maize and calabash. From the mesquite, the Chichimecas made white bread and wine. Many Chichimec tribes utilized the juice of the agave as a substitute for water when it was in short supply. ==The Site== Ballgame court viewed from the north, the valley on the far south The site was built over an artificial plateau, comprising a civic-religious complex and a ballgame court on the southern side. The structure complex known as Casas Tapadas comprises 4 buildings, a palace and a small altar bordered by a thick wall with a seating bench on the inside. There are several accesses, with a main access on the west side. A Large road leads to this entrance. The place is believed to have worshiped gods representing water, earth, fire and wind. This worship is depicted in the architectonic manifestations, sculptures and ornamental articles found. Rays, clouds, serpents, snails and spirals are symbols represented in stone glyphs, and structures. Plazuelas was built over three hill sides, divided by two ravines, overlooking a large valley to the south. The eastern ravine has a water spring, considered the main water source, while western ravine, known as “Los Cuijes” only has seasonal rain water. It can be said that the plateau where the site was constructed is surrounded by natural ravines in three sides (east, north and west), some deeper than others, the southern side, where the access to the site is located, is composed by a smooth slope towards the valley. The esplanade to the west has remains of a second ballgame court, and possibly other remains, yet to be explored. The central esplanade contains five buildings; it is believed to have represented the larger construction effort, in leveling the terrain. The buildings are the Casas Tapadas Complex, a ballgame court to the south, two structures just west of the court, a Temazcal and a large concentration of petroglyphs at the northern and western edges of the esplanade. An interesting consideration is that the main three structures at Casas Tapadas, resemble three hills on the background and would seem to have been purposely aligned. See photograph. Casas Tapadas Complex, against hills on the background The eastern esplanade has an unexplored circular basement. The site structures seem to be aligned north south with a few degree deviation to the east. ==Structures== Casas Tapadas and the ballgame court to the south are connected by a 220 meter (720 ft.) long road The building decoration depicts the stylized motif of “atadura de años” (bundle of years), the design was modified in several occasions to commemorate the end of a life cycle. It is also depicted in ray shaped sculptures ornamenting the eastern pyramid. ===Casas Tapadas=== Eastern structure, small altar in front Large structure at the north-east corner of Casas Tapadas, entrances on the south and northern sides Detail of constructive stages, eastern structure, north–west corner The complex was built over a large rectangular platform oriented east-west, measuring approximately 132 by 89 meters (433 by 291 ft.) over which several structures were built, three main structures are aligned east - west. The complex has a perimeter wall with a large walkway built into the interior facade, interrupted by seven entrances: three to the north, three to the south and one to the west. The site contains a traditional Bajio element, known as a sunken patio, as it is located at a lower level within the complex.Castañeda, 1998 The complex had several expansions, to the north by a square patio at the west side and to the south by a rectangular patio at the eastern end, communicated by a hall way parallel to the basement. This expansion communicates with the exterior by four stairways. To the south, because of the terrain level contour, the expansion forms a large terrace similar to the northern expansion, and on the center of the south side has a stairway that leads onto the road that connects with the ballgame court. The north and south basements were modified three times, when originally built they had certain symmetry, with an overhang decoration over the wall sides, it became more complex on the second stage of the north basement, while on the south basement it was simpler; in both cases, a stone slab holds most of the ornament weight. During the third constructive stage the building design changes completely, to the south, the building design is very basic, the walls has no ornaments, while the northern side the structure is conformed by large engraved self-supported stones, supporting the stone slabs weight. The structure has rather rare elements in Guanajuato. The architectonic layout is T shaped and unfortunately was found in bad conditions; apparently was destroyed towards its decline (900 CE). The profile of its perimeter wall also has the northern structure monolithic stones and among the remains are large engraved stones depicting cut spirals that most have been part of the structure. Inside are traces of a wall that possibly divided the space, covered with a clay floor, probably remains of two small patios. The main Access to Casas Tapadas is by a road limited by low walls on the western side. On the northern side there are several steps that indicate a straight line smooth route down towards the water spring. ===Caracoles=== Caracoles Eastern view Caracoles and Casas Tapadas This structure is actually part of the Casas Tapadas complex, it is called “Caracoles”, because of spiral figures found as part of the structure ornament. The building on the back contained carved stones with lightning representations and the year symbol, over a cane bundle. Possibly in memory of an important event or the beginning of a new 52 year cycle. In addition to its political function, it was probably dedicated to the earth, by the inverted T shape related to the underworld. Its walls contain carved stones with a cut spiral. Structure ornament, representation of lightning and “year bundle” at the bottom ===Circular Basement=== An unexplored circular basement with a 48 meter (157 ft.) diameter is located some 624 meters (2047 ft.) east of the Casas Tapadas complex, over the eastern ravine, it is believed to be somehow part of the Circular Building Tradition of Teuchitlán, JaliscoWeigand, Phil. 1993 on the Guachimontones three pyramidal basements conforming an open plaza and subtle terraces. ===Ballgame Court=== Ballgame marker, currently located at the site Museum The structure is the first architectural element seen upon entering the site, with Casas Tapadas in the background to the north. The structure has bigger constructions on the western side, while walls on the eastern side are lower, both sides possibly had stands for spectators attending the game. The ballgame court is I shaped, measuring some 65 by 31 meters (213 by 101 ft.) It presumably had a religious sense, it is believed that the game purpose was to assure the victorious rising of the sun every morning, with renewed energy to provide life on earth. In the four corners of the court were found sculptures representing a serpents and at the center, as marker a serpent –lizard. These mythological serpent presentations were offerings at the ballgame courts and also share features of the rain god and lightning. The claws below and the headdress displayed towards the back, symbolizes the power of nature elements. The marker found at the eastern side of the court, depicts attributes of the ancient rain gods, reiterating their association with fertility. This is expressed by the feather headdress, eye circles, the spiral depicting a mouth, the coiled nose, gums with teeth and the lower jaw. ===Ballgame ceremonial structures=== Structures west of the ballgame court, the view is looking west These two square structures sit just west of the ballgame court, hence it is assumed they were related to the game, probably with ceremonial purposes, following the ritual bath at the Temazcal structure, further to the west. Notice the opposing steps into the structures; the structure on the south (left on the photograph) has protruding steps, while the structure to the right has recessed steps. ===Temazcal=== Temazcal remains, view from the west; see the ceremonial structures to the east and the ballgame court at the background View of the Temazcal drainage, viowed from the inside of the structure To the west of the ballgame court (and ceremonial structures) is a Temazcal or ceremonial bath house,A temazcal is a type of sweat lodge which originated with pre-Hispanic Indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica. The word temazcal comes from the Nahuatl word temazcalli (\\"house of heat\\") were players probably took purifying baths, before the ceremonial game. ===Petroglyphs=== There are apparently two main zones with many petroglyphs, one to the east of the ball game, near the Temazcal and another more important section to the north. The petroglyphs were engraved on the surface of igneous rock outgrowths, by natives, in high and low relief, holes, circles, dotted lines, continuous lines, spiral, concentric circles, zoomorphic figures, planes and isolated building models and complex sites. Plazuelas model, carved in rock, located at the edge of the western ravine The model outline Bajio architectonic elements, such as sunken patios and other features from gar away regions, such as Teuchitlán (Guachimontones), that confirms the multi-ethnicity hypothesis of these lands.Castañeda and Casimir, 1999 An important sample is the model, depicting details of the Casas Tapadas complex, the details of elements engraved such as accesses, stairways, walkways and structures architectonic lay out is remarkable. ===Sculptures=== Among the relevant findings at the site, are several fragments of anthropomorphic stone sculptures that presumably were destroyed along with the site structures. These include a male figure, mutilated of hands, legs and head, seems to be a captive representation, its slim body, the back curvature and the arms are stiff up against its body, would indicate a person tied and captive, similar to others observed in other regions. ===Phallus=== Phallus, located at site museum Was found at the main entrance of casas tapadas, it was broken in four pieces. It is believed that it was vertically set originally. This is a male attribute marker to the site, representing fertility. It has many carvings, similar to others found in the site. ===Turquoise=== Turquoise collars, located at site museum Tturquoise jewelry miniatures about 1/8” tall, located at site museum Turquoise jewelry, located at site museum It was a high valued stone for jewels manufacturing, it was associated with water and the morning sky. Many pieces were found with various designs, among them are miniature figures (measuring about 3 mm or 1/8 of an inch), shaped as water droplets, lightning and dogs, animals associated with water. Decorations, located at site museum Pottery, located at site museum ===Site Museum=== Upon entering the site, the Museum is on the right hand side, it contains a large number of pieces found in the site. Site facilities are well kept, including parking space, toilets, souvenirs and a well-marked site visit route. The museum offers guided tours, by trained junior high schools children. ==ReferencesBibliography== * Brambila Rosa, \\"Datos generales del Bajío\\" (Bajio General Data), en Cuadernos de arquitectura mesoamericana, número 25, UNAM, México, 1993, pp. 3–10. * Castañeda Carlos, Irapuato prehispánico (Prehispanic Irapuato), Archivo Centro INAH Guanajuato, México, 1997.

In 2014 he published Wisconsin Becoming: The Careful Creation of Prosperity, which covers the history of the Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics and its relation to economic development in the state of Wisconsin. Since 2009, Bromley has been a visiting professor at the Faculty of Agriculture and Horticulture of the Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany. In 2011 he was honored with the Reinhard-Lust-Preis for International Transfer of Science and Culture awarded jointly by the German Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung and the Fritz Thyssen-Stiftung. For three years, Bromley served Chair of the U. S. Federal Advisory Committee on Marine Protected Areas. Bromley also served on a special committee of the National Academy of Sciences on climate change in the United States. Bromley is a consultant, advising the Global Environment Facility, the World Bank, the Ford Foundation, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Asian Development Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Ministry for the Environment in New Zealand, and the Aga Khan Foundation. His has consulted with the Government of National Unity in Sudan on economic recovery in the south and in Darfur and the government of Jordan on institutional reform in the water sector. In 2016, Juha Hiedanpää and Bromley published Environmental Heresies: The Quest for Reasonable, which reframes environmental conflicts and which advances a pragmatic, deliberative approach. ==Contributions to economics== Bromley has been the editor of the journal Land Economics for more than 41 years. His scholarship has been concerned with more effective fisheries, economic development, and environmental policy. In an influential article, \\"The ideology of efficiency: Searching for a Theory of Policy Analysis\\", Bromley challenged conventional notions that economic efficiency analysis is \\"objective\\", finding an absence of consistency and coherence in the logical positivism of economic welfare analysis. In the 2006 book, Sufficient Reason: Volitional Pragmatism and the Meaning of Economic Institutions, Bromley challenged the prevailing economic microeconomic models of rational choice; he offered a competing evolutionary model of pragmatic human action where individuals \\"work out\\" their desired choices and actions as they learn what choices are available. Bromley's perspective on volitional pragmatism builds on the philosophical and institutional economics work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Friedrich Nietzsche, Charles Sanders Peirce, John Dewey, John R. Commons, Thorstein Veblen, and Richard Rorty. ==Awards== * Who’s Who in Economics * American Men and Women of Science * Fellow American Agricultural Economics Associationhttps://www.aaea.org/about-aaea/awards-and- honors/aaea-fellows/previous-aaea-fellows * Fellow Association of Environmental and Resource Economists * Reimar Lüst Prize from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany, 2011 * Veblen-Commons Award from the Association for Evolutionary Economics, 2016 == Selected works  Books === * Economic Interests and Institutions: The Conceptual Foundations of Public Policy.

'Disputed territories' are also indicated. Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia are the three fictional superstates in George Orwell's 1949 dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. All that Oceania's citizens know about the world is whatever the Party wants them to know, so how the world evolved into the three states is unknown; and it is also unknown to the reader whether they actually exist in the novel's reality, or whether they are a storyline invented by the Party to advance social control. The nations, so far as can be inferred, appear to have emerged from nuclear warfare and civil dissolution over 20 years between 1945 and 1965. ==Sourcing== George Orwell, author of Nineteen Eighty-Four, whose wartime BBC career influenced the creation of Oceania What we know of the society, politics and economics of Oceania, and its rivals, comes from the in-universe book, The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism. The protagonist of Nineteen Eighty- Four, Winston Smith, describes it as \\"a heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the cover. The print also looked slightly irregular. The pages were worn at the edges, and fell apart easily, as though the book had passed through many hands.\\" The book is a literary device Orwell uses to connect the past and present of 1984. Orwell intended Goldstein's book to parody Trotsky's (on whom Goldstein is based) The Revolution Betrayed: What is the Soviet Union and Where is it Going?, 1941. ==Oceania== Oceania was founded following an anti-capitalist revolution, which while intended to be the ultimate liberation of its proletariat, soon ignored them. There is, however, no indication in the text to suggest how the Party obtained the power it posesses or when it did so. The state includes the Americas, Australasia, Britain and part of South Africa. Oceania's political system, Ingsoc, (English socialism) uses cult of personality to venerate the ruler, Big Brother as the Inner Party exercises day-to-day power. Food rationing, which does not affect Inner Party members, is in place. This is intended to strengthen the party's control over its citizens and help with its wars. Winston considers the geography as now stands: \\"even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One, for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called England, or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been called London. There is countryside outside of London, but this is not a place for enjoying the contrast with the city but purely practical grounds of exercise. Oceania is made up by provinces, of which Airstrip One, as Britain is now known, is one. The whole province is \\"miserable and run-down\\" with London consisting, almost solely, of \\"decaying suburbs\\". Airstrip One is the third most populous province in Oceania; but London is not the capital, for Oceania has none. This decentralisation enables the Party to ensure that each province of Oceania feels itself to be the centre of affairs; and it prevents them from feeling colonised, for there is no distant capital to focus discontent on. 85% of Oceania's population are Proles, with the most of the remainder the Outer Party; a tiny number rule as members of the Inner Party. Winston yearns for revolution and a return to a time before Oceania, says Carr; but he realises that \\"no revolution is possible in Oceania. History, in Hegelian terms, has ended. There will be no political transformations in Oceania: political change has ended because Big Brother will not let it happen\\". No political collapse is possible in Oceania, suggests Carr, because the government will not allow it, regardless of internal or external pressures. A totalitarian and highly formalised state, Oceania also has no law, only crimes, says Lynskey. Nothing is illegal; social pressure is used to exert control, in place of law. It is hard for citizens to know when they are in breach of Party expectations; and they are in a state of permanent anxiety, unable to think too deeply on any subject whatsoever so as to avoid \\"thoughtcrime.\\" For example, Winston begins to write a diary and does not know if this is a forbidden offence, but he is reasonably certain of it. In Oceania, to think is to do and no distinction is drawn between either. Criticism of the state is forbidden; though criticism must be constant for the state's survival for it must have critics to destroy so as to demonstrate the state's power. Governance of Oceania depends upon the necessity of suppressing freedom of thought or original thinking amongst the Outer Party (the Proles are exempted from this as they are deemed incapable of having ideas). The state is highly bureaucratic. Winston notes that a myriad of committees are responsible for administration and are \\"liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two years\\". The rulers of Oceania, the Inner Party, says Winston, were once the intelligentsia, the \\"bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians\\". The state's national anthem is Oceania, 'Tis for Thee. ==Eurasia and Eastasia== Eastasia consists of China, Japan, Tibet and some Manchurian/Mongolian regions. Eurasia comprises Russia and mainland Europe, stretching, says Winston, \\"from Portugal to the Bering Strait\\". The ideology of Eurasia is Neo-Bolshevism, and that of Eastasia is called Death-Worship. These states' populations also primarily consist of Proles. Winston recognises similarities with the other superstates, at one point commenting that \\"it was curious to think that the sky was the same for everybody, In Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here. And the people under the sky were very much the same.\\" ==International relations== The three states have been at war with each other since the 1960s. By 1984 it has become a constant, and they regularly change allegiance with each other. Each state is self-supporting so they do not war over natural resources, nor is the destruction of the opponent the primary objective; for, even when two states ally against the third, no combination is powerful enough to do so. War is necessary to use up the oversupply constantly generated by the respective extreme forms of capitalism. Each state recognises that science is responsible for its over-production, so science must be carefully controlled lest the proles or Outer Party expect an increased standard of living. From this analysis stems the policy of permanent warfare: by focusing production on arms and materiel (rather than consumer goods) each state can keep its population impoverished and willing to sacrifice personal liberties for the greater good. The peoples of these states—subject to shortages, queues, poor infrastructure and food— \\"are no longer domesticated or even able to be domesticated \\" says Carr. These states all, in effect, use the same totalitarianism, and are similar monolithic regimes. Historian Mark Connelly notes that \\"the beliefs may differ, but their purpose is the same, to justify and maintain the unquestioned leadership of a totalitarian elite\\". Each uses artificially- induced hatred of its then-enemy by its citizenry to control them. Due to the sheer size of the protagonists, there are, says Connelly, no \\"massive invasions claiming hundreds of thousands of lives\\", but instead small-scale, local encounters and conflicts which are then exaggerated for the purposes of domestic propaganda. Connely describes the fighting between the states as \\"highly technical, involving small units of highly trained individuals waging battles in remote contested regions\\". All sides once possessed nuclear weapons, but, following a short-lived resort to them in the 1950s (in which Colchester was hit) they were recognised as too dangerous for any of them to use. As a result, says Connelly, although London could have been destroyed by a nuclear weapon in 1984, it was never hit by anything worse–albeit \\"20 or 30 times a week\\"–than \\"rocketbombs\\", themselves no more powerful than the V-1s or V-2s of World War Two. At any moment, however, an alliance could shift and the two states that had previously been at war with each other may suddenly ally against the other. When this happened, the past immediately had to be re- written—newspapers retyped, new photos glued over old—to provide continuity. In many cases that which contradicted the state was simply destroyed. This occurs during Oceania's Hate Week, when it is announced that the state is at war with Eastasia and allied to Eurasia, despite the assembled crowd—including Winston and Julia—having just witnessed the executions of Eurasian prisoners of war. Winston describes how, when the announcer spoke, \\"nothing altered in his voice or manner or in the content of what he was saying, but suddenly the names were different\\". Orwell describes the war as one of \\"limited aims between combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference\\". These wars, suggests the writer Roberta Kalechofsky, \\"stimulate the news or 'the truth'\\". ==Analysis== The superstates of Nineteen Eighty-Four are recognisably based in the world Orwell and his contemporaries knew while being distorted into a dystopia. Oceania for example, argues the critic Alok Rai, \\"is a known country\\", because, while a totalitarian regime set in an alternate reality, that reality is still recognisable to the reader. The state of Oceania comprises concepts, phrases and attitudes that have been recycled—\\"endlessly drawn upon\\"—ever since the book was published. They are the product, says Fabio Parascoli, of \\"humankind's foolishness and lack of vision\\". They are also though, argues the critic Craig L. Carr, places where \\"things have gone horribly and irreparably wrong\\". Each state is self- supporting and self-enclosed: emigration and immigration are forbidden, as are international trade and the learning of foreign languages. Winston suspects, also, that the war exists for the Party's sake, and questions if it is taking place at all, and that the bombs which daily fell on London could have been launched by the Party itself \\"just to keep people frightened\\", he considers. The reader is told, through Winston, that the world has not always been this way, and indeed, once was much better; on one occasion with Julia, she produces a bar of old-fashioned chocolate—what the Party issued tasted \\"like the smoke from a rubbish fire\\"—and it brought back childhood memories from before Oceania's creation. Craig Carr argues that, in creating Oceania and the other warring states, Orwell was not predicting the future, but warning of a possible future if things carried on as they did. In other words, it was also something which could be avoided. Carr continues ===Contemporary interpretations=== Economist Christopher Dent has argued that Orwell's vision of Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia \\"turned out to be only partially true. Many of the post-war totalitarian states have toppled, but a tripolar division of global economic and political power is certainly apparent\\". This is divided, he suggests, between Europe, the United States and Japan. Scholar Christopher Behrends, meanwhile, has commented that the proliferation of US airbases in Britain in the 1980s echoes Orwell's classification of the country as an airbase into the European theatre. The growth of supra-state organisation such as the Organisation of American States, argues the legal scholar Wolfgang Friedmann, \\"corresponding to the super-states of Orwell's 1984... change would be from the power balances of numerous big and small national states to the more massive and potentially more destructive balance of power between two or three blocks of super-Powers\\".James L. Hildebrand, Complexity Analysis: A Preliminary Step Toward a General Systems Theory of International Law, 3 Ga. J. Int’l & Comp. L. 271 (1973), p.284 Similarly, in 2007 the UK's House of Commons' European Scrutiny Committee argued that the European Commission's stated aim to make Europe a \\"World Partner\\" should be taken to read \\"Europe as a World Power!\\", and likened it to Orwell's Eurasia. The committee also suggested that the germ of Orwell's superstates could already be found in organisations such as, not only the EU, but the ASEAN and FTAA. Further, the committee suggested that the long wars then being waged by American forces against enemies they helped originally create, such as in Baluchistan were also signs of a germinal 1984-style superstate.House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee: The European Commission's Annual Policy Strategy 2008 (Thirty-second Report of Session 2006–07), vol. II: Oral and written evidence. Evs 28/2.5, 34/2.5. Lynskey writes how, in 1949, as Orwell was ill but Nineteen Eighty-Four complete, \\"the post-war order took shape. In April, a dozen Western nations formed NATO. In August, Russia successfully detonated its first atom bomb in the Kazakh steppe. In October, Mao Zedong established the People’s Republic of China...Oceania, Eurasia, Eastasia.\\" A London street in 1930 The investigations in post-war America into domestic communism, known as McCarthyism, have been compared to the process by which the states of Nineteen Eighty-Four re-write their history in a process that the political philosopher Joseph Gabel labelled \\"time mastery\\". Similarly, Winston and Julia's attempts to contact, and await contact by, members of the secret organisation called the Brotherhood have been compared to the political strategy of Kremlinology whereby Western powers study minute changes in Russian government in an attempt to foresee events. The states' permanent low- level war is similar, says scholar Ian Slater that in Vietnam, except in Orwell's imagination the war is never-ending. Oceania, suggests Rai, in its labyrinthine bureaucracy, was comparable to the post-war Labour government, which found itself in control of what he terms the \\"extensive apparatus of economic direction and control\\" that had been set up at the beginning of the Second World War to regulate supply. London, too, as described by Winston is a perfect match, according to Rai, for the post-war city: In a review of the book in 1950 Symons notes that the gritty, uncomfortable world of Oceania was directly relatable to by Orwell's readers: the food, milkless tea and harsh alcohol were the staples of wartime rationing, which in many cases had continued after the war. Critic Irving Howe argues that, since then, other events and countries—North Korea, for example—have demonstrated how close Oceania can be. Oceania is, he suggests, \\"both unreal and inescapable, a creation based on what we know, but not quite recognisable\\". Lynskey suggests that Oceania's anthem, Oceania, Tis For Thee, is a direct reference to the United States (from \\"America (My Country, 'Tis of Thee)\\"), as also, he posits, the use of the dollar sign as the Oceanian currency denominator. ==Influences== The totalitarian states of Nineteen Eighty-Four, although imaginary, were based partly on the real-life regimes of Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Russia. Both regimes used techniques and tactics that Orwell later utilised in his novel: the re-writing of history, the cult of leadership personality, purges and show trials, for example. The author Czesław Miłosz commented that, in his depictions of Oceanian society, \\"even those who know Orwell only by hearsay are amazed that a writer who has never lived in Russia should have so keen a perception of Russian life\\". From a purely literary standpoint, suggests Julian Symons the superstates of 1984 represent points along a path that also took Orwell from Burma to Catalonia, Spain, and Wigan in England. In each location, argues Symonds, characters are similarly confined a \\"tightly controlled, taboo-ridden\\" society, and are as suffocated by them as Winston is in Airstrip One. In The Road to Wigan Pier, for example, Orwell examines working-class life in detail; the scene in 1984, where Winson observes a Prole woman hanging out her washing echoes the earlier book, where Orwell watches a woman, in the back area of a slum dwelling, attempting to clear a drain pipe with a stick. Orwell's own wartime role in the Ministry of Information saw him, says Rai, \\"experience at first hand the official manipulation of the flow of information, ironically, in the service of 'democracy' against 'totalitarianism'\\". He noted privately at the time that he could see totalitarian possibilities for the BBC that he would later provide for Oceana. Similarly, argues Lynskey, during the war Orwell had had to make pro-Soviet broadcasts, lauding Britain's ally. After the war—but with a cold one looming—this became an image that needed swiftly to be discarded, and is, comments Lynskey, the historical origin of Oceania's bouleversement in its alliance during Hate Week. ==Comparisons== The superstates of Nineteen Eighty- Four have been compared by literary scholars to other dystopian societies such as those created by Aldous Huxley in Brave New World, Yevgeny Zamyatin's We, Franz Kafka's The Trial Susser, D., 'Hermeneutic Privacy: On Identity, Agency, and Information', (Stony Brook University PhD, 2015), p.67 B. F. Skinner's Walden II,Leonard J. Eslick (1971) The Republic Revisited: The Dilemma of Liberty and Authority', World Futures: The Journal of New Paradigm Research, 10:3-4, 171-212, p.178 and Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange although Orwell's bleak 1940s-style London differs fundamentally from Huxleys's world of extensive technical progression or Zamyatin's science and logic-based society.

The Patients Association works with patients directly: they are its members and supporters, and also the people who benefit from the organisation's help and advice services. ==Activities== The Patients Association's current projects include: * Complaints handling and improvement * Working with the elderly * Mental health * Patient involvement * Working with Patient Participation Groups (PPGs) * Health promotion The organisation runs a national helpline, \\"providing specialist information, advice and signposting to help people navigate the often complex world of health and social care.\\" The helpline operates a telephone service and also responds to enquiries by email, post and through its Live Chat service. Helpline advisers do not provide medical or legal advice to callers. The Association reported in its 2018 Annual Review that 96 per cent of helpline callers would recommend the free service to friends and family members. The types of organisations the Association's helpline receive calls about range from A&Es; to dentists, but care at GP practices and patients’ experiences as outpatients account for almost half of all enquiries. ==Funding== The Patients Association's income for 2016 was £254,862 and it held reserves of £471,604 at the end of the year. It receives most of its funding from individual and corporate membership (76% in 2016) which the organisation says \\"ensures that we do not have to receive core funding from Government; therefore, we can represent the interests of patients alone.\\" It receives a smaller amount of funding through donations from patients, the public, and grant giving charitable organisations. ==Leadership== Rachel Power is the current Chief Executive Officer.

Dame Elizabeth Ackroyd was the President from 1971 to 1978, and from 1978 she was appointed as the Chair. She was considered the heart and soul of the association in terms of representation on committees and working parties, engagement with the media, attending events, and (with a small industrious staff) the day-to-day business and running of the organisation. A source of formidable energy and enthusiasm, as well as running the association, Dame Elizabeth held prominent roles in the National Consumer Council established in 1963, the Consumers' Association and numerous other voluntary organisations. Katherine Murphy was the Director and Chief Executive Officer from 2007 to 2017. During this ten year period, she led and maintained the Patients Association as market leader in the campaigning and lobbying on the subject of patient and carer rights.

Eklund is also a suspect in other murder cases currently under investigation, including the unsolved 1994 murder of Malin Olsson in Gothenburg. On October 6, 2008, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for the two murders, one rape in Sandviken 2006 and on child pornography charges. In September 2014 the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet revealed that Eklund was a suspect in yet another murder, this time the murder of six-year-old Jasmina Jasharaj who went missing without a trace in 1997. Even though the police have not found her body, they are treating the case as a homicide. ==Höglund murder== On April 5, 2008, 10-year-old Engla Juncosa Höglund went missing on her way home from soccer practice in Stjärnsund, Sweden. When she did not answer her mobile phone, Engla's mother, Carina Höglund, went looking for her and found her daughter's abandoned bicycle in the woods. The mother quickly suspected foul play and stated that her daughter did not have the physical strength to dispose of the bicycle in that way. By coincidence, a man was out testing his new digital camera around the time of Höglund's disappearance and he took photos of his surroundings, including one photo of 10-year-old Engla Höglund riding her bike. The man also took a photo of a red Saab 900 following the young girl. The driver of the red car was later revealed to be Anders Eklund. After the photographer stepped forward and showed police his photos, Eklund was identified and consequently arrested. On April 13, 2008, after days of interrogations by experts from Rikskriminalpolisen, Eklund confessed to the murder and disclosed the location of Höglund's body. During these interrogations Eklund also confessed to the murder of Pernilla Hellgren. Höglund's death became headline news, as most people had high hopes of finding the girl alive. Höglund's funeral on May 10, 2008 was broadcast live on television on SVT1, the first time in Swedish television history any such broadcast had been made. The decision to broadcast the funeral was questioned and it sparked a debate about whether it was ethical or not. ==Hellgren murder== On June 4, 2000 in Falun, 31-year-old Pernilla Hellgren was found murdered. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted. A young girl on her way home had witnessed the attack, and told investigators that she saw a man following Hellgren on her way home from a party in central Falun. DNA found on Hellgren's body was a match to Eklund, who confessed to the murder when investigators in the Engla case presented the DNA evidence that implicated him. ==Trial and imprisonment== On July 18, 2008, Anders Eklund was tried on two counts of murder and two counts of rape. In addition to these charges he was also accused of several counts of illegal possession of child pornography. In August 2008, after a relatively swift trial he was found guilty of all charges and declared mentally fit to stand trial. On October 6, 2008, Anders Eklund was sentenced to life imprisonment for the two murders, one rape in Sandviken 2006 and for the child pornography crimes. Following the sentencing, Eklund was transferred to the Norrtälje Correctional Facility, a high-security prison north of Stockholm. The Norrtälje Correctional Facility provides a special wing for sex offenders, commonly known as \\"the sex bunker\\", in which Anders Eklund was incarcerated. In June 2014 Eklund was assaulted by other inmates and had to be hospitalized. He was released from hospital and returned to prison the same day. ==References== Category:1965 births Category:2008 crimes in Sweden Category:Living people Category:People convicted of murder by Sweden Category:Prisoners and detainees of Sweden Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Sweden Category:Swedish murderers of children Category:Swedish people convicted of murder Category:Swedish prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Swedish rapists Category:2000s murders in Sweden Category:2008 murders in Europe Category:Swedish serial killers Category:Male serial killers ","title":"Anders Eklund (murderer)"},{"id":"19246052","text":"TerraFire is a multidirectional shooter for MS-DOS.

He also played war-time football for Wolves, Mansfield Town, Notts County, Swindon Town and Walsall, and later played Southern League football for Wellington Town. He won the Fourth Division title with Port Vale in 1958–59, and won both the FA Cup with Wolves in 1949, as well as the First Division title in 1953–54. ==Playing career== Pritchard joined local side Wolverhampton Wanderers straight from school in 1941. The suspension of league football due to World War II delayed the official start of his Wolves career, though gave him the opportunity to play as a guest for Mansfield Town, Notts County, Swindon Town and Walsall. He finally made his First Division debut after the resumption of the Football League on 12 October 1946, in a 6–1 thrashing of Huddersfield Town at Molineux. This was one of just four starts under the stewardship of Ted Vizard during the 1946–47 season. Under the management of Stan Cullis, Pritchard became a regular fixture at full-back in the Wolves side over the next seven seasons. They reached fifth and sixth in the league in the 1947–48 and 1948–49 seasons, though their great success was to come in the FA Cup. Pritchard helped the team to battle through the 1948–49 FA Cup campaign, beating Chesterfield, Sheffield United, Liverpool, West Bromwich Albion and Manchester United (in a semi-final replay) to reach the 1949 FA Cup Final. He played all ninety minutes at Wembley, as Wolves defeated Leicester City 3–1. Wolves then came second in the league in the 1949–50 season, as Portsmouth's superior goal average proved decisive. They dropped to 14th place in 1950–51, but did manage to reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup. A 16th-place finish in 1951–52 was then followed by a third-place finish in 1952–53. He played 27 league games in the 1953–54 season, as Wolves won their first league title with a four-point lead over Midlands rivals West Bromwich Albion. They came close to retaining their title in the 1954–55 campaign, as Chelsea won the title by four points; Pritchard featured just seven times and also missed the 1954 FA Charity Shield, as a defensive reshuffle saw him out of favour. In February 1955, Pritchard switched clubs to fellow Midland rivals Aston Villa. His career at Villa Park never got going, and he only played three times for their first team over a two-and-a-half-year stay. Eric Houghton's \\"Villans\\" finished sixth in 1954–55, though only avoided relegation in 1955–56 on goal average. They rose to tenth in 1955–56 and won the FA Cup, though Pritchard did not feature in the final. He moved on to Notts County in November 1957, and played out the remainder of the 1957–58 season at Meadow Lane, featuring in 18 Second Division games as Tommy Lawton's side were relegated in last place. Pritchard joined Port Vale in the close season, and played 18 league games as the \\"Valiants\\" won the Fourth Division title in 1958–59. He played just six Third Division games in the 1959–60 campaign, after which manager Norman Low allowed him to leave Vale Park on a free transfer. In May 1960 he joined Southern League side Wellington Town, and remained at the club until his retirement. ==Statistics== Source: {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !rowspan=\\"2\\"Division !colspan=\\"2\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"10\\"Wolverhampton Wanderers 1946–47 First Division 400040 - 1947–48 First Division 20000200 - 1948–49 First Division 30060360 - 1949–50 First Division 26060320 - 1950–51 First Division 29070360 - 1951–52 First Division 19000190 - 1952–53 First Division 40010410 - 1953–54 First Division 27010280 - 1954–55 First Division 700070 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !202!!0!!21!!0!!223!!0 - rowspan=\\"4\\"Aston Villa 1955–56 First Division 100010 - 1956–57 First Division 100010 - 1957–58 First Division 100010 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !3!!0!!0!!0!!3!!0 - Notts County 1957–58 Second Division 18011191 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Port Vale 1958–59 Fourth Division 18000180 - 1959–60 Third Division 600060 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !24!!0!!0!!0!!24!!0 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career total !247!!0!!22!!1!!269!!1 } ==Honours== ;Wolverhampton Wanderers *FA Cup winner: 1949 *Football League First Division runner-up: 1949–50 *Football League First Division champion: 1953–54 ;Port Vale *Football League Fourth Division champion: 1958–59 ==References== Category:1925 births Category:1993 deaths Category:People from Dawley Category:English footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Mansfield Town F.C. wartime guest players Category:Notts County F.C. wartime guest players Category:Swindon Town F.C. wartime guest players Category:Walsall F.C. wartime guest players Category:Aston Villa F.C. players Category:Notts County F.C. players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Telford United F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Southern Football League players ","title":"Roy Pritchard"},{"id":"19246065","text":"Geoffrey Lane Paish MBE (2 January 1922 – 3 February 2008) was a noted tennis player and administrator.

Interferon alfa contains several naturally occurring IFN-α subtypes and is purified by affinity chromatography. Although the pharmaceutical product is often simply called \\"interferon alpha\\" or \\"IFN-α\\" like its endogenous counterpart, the product's International nonproprietary name (INN) is interferon alfa (the spelling of 'alfa' with 'f' reflects INN naming conventions). == Composition == Interferon alpha contains a mixture of several proteins, all with structural, serological, and functional properties typical for natural interferon alpha (IFN-α). The major subtypes identified are IFN-α1, IFN-α2, IFN-α8, IFN-α10, IFN-α14 and IFN-α21. Of these, IFN-α2 and IFN-α14 are glycosylated. The IFN-α content is expressed in International Units per milliliter, and the drug product is formulated in isotonic phosphate buffer solution at pH = 7.2, and supplemented with human albumin at 1.5 mg/ml. The albumin used is a medicinal product approved in several countries, and is indicated for subcutaneous injection therapy. == Pharmacology == IFN-α8 enhances the proliferation of human B cells, as well as being able to activate NK cells. The subtypes α10 and α2, along with α8, are the most efficient and powerful NK cell activators. Subtypes α21 and α2 enhance the expression of IFN-gamma-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) in dendritic cells. Activated dendritic cells initiate immune responses and induce the expression of IP-10, a chemokine which promotes a Th1 inflammatory response. IFN-α1 causes increased HLA-II expression, and can directly inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro. However, it is a poor activator of NK cells, has relatively little antiviral activity, does not induce B cell proliferation, and does not enhance HLA-I or tumor antigen expression. Despite its apparent inactivity, it is still used clinically in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, with a reported lower toxicity than the recombinant IFN-α2. Overall, IFN-α has a general inflammatory action which skews the immune response towards a Th1 profile. Subtype α2 increases the expression of HLA-I molecules, which correlates with IFN-α-mediated activation of memory CD8 cells and increased cytolytic action against virally infected cells and tumor cells (via cytotoxic CD8 cells). == References == Category:Immunomodulating drugs ","title":"Interferon alfa"},{"id":"19246107","text":"Thomas Beagley (5 October 1789 – 21 February 1858) was an English professional cricketer. He had two brothers Henry and John who also played first-class cricket. He was arguably the most talented of the trio, playing for Hampshire, Surrey, Suffolk, England and the MCC during his 23-year playing career. Beagley was regarded as one of the greatest hitters of a ball in England in the 1820s up to the early 1830s. ==Early life== Born into a working-class family to Stephen and Mary Beagley (née Gould), Beagley was baptised four days after his birth, on 9 November 1789. His family had lived in Farringdon since as far back as 1692, and in the Alton area as far back as 1605. He had some roots in other Hampshire settlements, such as Hartley Mauditt and Bentworth, and was connected to families such as Fry, Carter, Page, Russell and Grant. ==Career== Beagley was mainly associated with Hampshire and made 70 known appearances in first-class matches from 1816 to 1839.Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 1 (1744-1826), Lillywhite, 1862 He was a specialist batsman whose highest career score was 113*, which also happened to be the first century in a Gentlemen v Players match.

In his final match, Beagley made a total of 9 over two innings for England, against the MCC. Beagley represented All-England during the roundarm trial matches, representing the side in all three matches. Come the end of his career, his batting average was 17.10, having scored 1916 runs in 127 innings, including 15 not outs.

In Public was shot on digital video for the 2001 Jeonju International Film Festival. In many ways, the film was a test-run for the feature length fiction film Unknown Pleasures. Both films are shot digitally (a medium Jia would return to in Still Life (2006) and 24 City (2008)), both are set in the city of Datong, and both share the same shooting locations. As usual, Jia's regular collaborator Yu Lik-wai served as the film's director of photography. The film also screened at the 2002 Marseille Festival of Documentary Film, where it won the Grand Prix. == Background == In Public was made and submitted by Jia as part of a program at the 2001 Jeonju International Film Festival, where three directors were asked to produce a short film in digital video. The other two directors who produced entries that year were Taiwanese filmmaker Tsai Ming-liang and British director John Akomfrah. Setting up his camera in a train station in Datong, Jia made a film consisting of thirty shots over forty five days. Lacking in any formal plot, the film instead captures seemingly mundane moments, customers asking for the train schedule, shots inside public buses, etc. The result, according to Chinese film scholar Berenice Reynaud, is a film that captures the \\"ennui, backwardness, and dreary atmosphere of a small town, and the impatience, hidden desires and private concerns of its inhabitants.\\" For Jia, the film was a chance to focus on the public spaces in a modern provincial city of China: the train stations, discos, and karaokes of Datong. == Relationship to Unknown Pleasures == While filming In Public, Jia became interested in not only the desolate-looking buildings that had originally attracted him to the city, but to the people who inhabited them. Moreover, Jia came to realize that filming digitally allowed him unprecedented flexibility and movement, inspiring him to begin production of Unknown Pleasures. Jia has said, \\"At first it was the bleak and lonely buildings that attracted me. When I saw the streets filled with lonely, directionless people, I became interested in them.\\" One critic, however, sees the film as more of a positive depiction of humanity than seen in Unknown Pleasures, noting that the film's final scene of people dancing in a dilapidated community center (the same center that opens the later film) elicits a sense of \\"people persevering despite the impoverishment of their existence.\\" Unknown Pleasures, in contrast, is \\"incendiary bleakness and outrage.\\" Stylistically, In Public fits with the Jia oeuvre, situated between Platform and Unknown Pleasures, with the long takes of the former and the same desolate locations of the latter. == References  External links == * * * In Public at the Chinese Movie Database Category:Chinese short films Category:Chinese documentary films Category:Short documentary films Category:2001 films Category:Mandarin- language films Category:Films directed by Jia Zhangke Category:2001 documentary films Category:Films set in Shanxi Category:Chinese films ","title":"In Public (film)"},{"id":"19246142","text":"Gérard Longuet (born 24 February 1946 in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de- Seinehttp://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/sycomore/fiche/(num_dept)/7886) is a French conservative politician.

The species Cardwellia sublimis (northern silky oak) is endemic to the rainforests of the wet tropics region of northeastern Queensland, Australia. Other common names include bull oak, golden spanglewood, lacewood, oak and oongaary. The compound leaves have up to 17 leaflets. It produces white inflorescences followed by woody fruits which are prominently displayed outside the canopy. ==Taxonomy and naming== Ferdinand von Mueller named the genus in honour of Edward Cardwell, who had been Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1864 to 1866. The species name is the Latin adjective sublimis \\"lofty\\". The type specimen was collected by John Dallachy in Rockingham Bay. Its everyday name in the local Dyirbal language was jungan, though a more general word gurruŋun \\"oak tree\\" (also applied to Darlingia ferruginea and Helicia australasica) was used in the taboo [Dyalŋuy] vocabulary. Molecular analysis indicates Cardwellia sublimis is a member of the subtribe Gevuininae, and is the earliest offshoot from the main ancestor of the other genera. It is thought to have separated around 35 million years ago in the late Eocene. ==Description== Cardwellia sublimis grows as a tall, often emergent, tree in its native rainforest habitat, reaching in height, though likely to only grow half this size in cultivation. The bark is thin, and there is no buttressing. The initial leaves are entire but juvenile leaves are generally pinnate and large, reaching long. They are composed of 3 to 10 pairs of oval to oblong leaflets, each of which is long and wide. Flowering is profuse, and the canopy can be covered with the cream-white flowerheads in late spring and summer. The inflorescences are long. The flowers are followed by woody oval follicles, which are long and wide and contain 8 to 12 winged seeds each. ==Distribution and habitat== Cardwellia sublimis grows naturally in wet tropics rainforests between Townsville and Cooktown from sea level to an altitude of . ==Uses and cultivation== Cardwellia sublimis has potential as a specimen tree in parks, and has showy flowers and follicles. It is readily propagated from seed and has been grown successfully in Melbourne. It is a valuable timber tree in Queensland, which is easy to work with and shows an attractive grain similar to that of oak. It is used for cabinet and veneer work. Attempts to grow Cardwellia sublimis in plantations have not been very successful. ==References== Category:Proteaceae Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Proteales of Australia Category:Monotypic Proteaceae genera ","title":"Cardwellia"},{"id":"19246197","text":"Bull oak is a common name for a number of species of Australian trees.

This movie is the second film of both Hiran Chatterjee and Srabanti Chatterjee. After five-week running success prompted producer Ashok Dhanuka added one more song \\"Bol Raja Chai Kemon Rani\\" to the film after shooting it right after Kali Puja. This is the first Bengali film shot in Salzburg, Austria. This film is the remake of the Telugu film Bommarillu directed and co-written by Bhaskar, starring Prakash Raj, Genelia D'Souza and Siddharth Narayan. The film primarily revolves around a father and son relationship with the father's dote on his son, leaving a bitter taste with the latter. The title track music of this film is also taken from Bommarillu. ==Plot== The film begins with a baby taking his initial steps on a beach while the father is supporting him. The narrator in the background (Prasenjit) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Sidhu (Hiran) begins uttering abuses at all the fathers in the world. When inquired about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Sabyasachi Chakrabarty), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairdo and many others are stashed away by his father's. However, he vows that the two things that will be of his choice would be, his career and the woman he would marry. Post-credits, Satya (Subhasis Mukherjee), the Arvind dutiful household's servant wakes up Sidhu in the morning. In the background, we see Siddhu's mother, Lakshmi (Laboni Sarkar) singing a devotional song while cooking. At the dining table, Arvind, Managing Director of their construction company, inquires if Siddhu will join their office for managing their business. When Sidhu deliberates, his father doesn't stand any longer and instead plans for his marriage despite Sidhu's silent protest. The next week, he returns home to realize that he is going to get engaged to Manasi against his wishes. He speaks with her only to realize that she is a \\"daddy's girl\\" and she not being to his liking. However, with Arvind's final say, they eventually get engaged. While contemplating on his options in a temple, Sidhu accidentally meets Priya (Srabanti Malakar), an engineering student. Seeing her chirpy nature and vibrance, Sidhu begins to like her. He makes attempts to know her by meeting her on a regular basis. In the process, he starts liking her cherubic and ever-friendly nature and as someone who does what she loves. As days go by, he realizes about so many small things in her company that gave him happiness. He realizes that he has fallen in love with her. Alongside this, Sidhu applies for a bank loan to start out on his dream of building his career. When his love for Priya deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses to her that he is engaged to marry Manasi against his wishes, but what he really wants is her. On knowing of him being engaged, Priya gets dejected, but comes back a day later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At this juncture, the ecstatic Sidhu is seen by a furious Arvind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marriage with Manasi. When asked for his reason to like Priya, Sidhu replies saying that if Priya can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Priya to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao (Sushanta Dutta) that she is going on a college tour. When Priya is introduced to Sidhu's family, she gets a lukewarm welcome. As she settles down in the house, one after the other begins to like her. Even though getting used to the living habits of the authoritarian Arvind's household was difficult, Priya stayed put for Sidhu's sake. In the meanwhile, Arvind reprimands Sidhu when he knows of his bank loan and his plans, only to further enrage Sidhu. One day the entire family along with Priya attends a marriage ceremony. A cheerful Priya cheers up the ceremony with her playful nature. Coincidentally, Kanaka Rao who happens to be around, recognizes Sidhu as the drunken young man whom he encountered on an earlier occasion. Priya realizes her father's presence and quickly exits to avoid his attention. After saving their grace, Sidhu admonishes Priya for her antics at the marriage. A sad and angry Priya moves out of the house saying that she does not find Sidhu the same and that she cannot put on an act if she stays in their house. After getting back to her house, she rebuilds the trust her father has in her while Sidhu is left forlorn. Lakshmi confronts Arvind on Sidhu's choices and wants. In the process, Sidhu opens up his heart and leaving Arvind to repent on his foolishness. Sidhu requests Manasi and her parents to call off the impending marriage. While they relent, Arvind manages to convince Kanaka babu about Sidhu and Priya's marriage. In return, Kanaka wants to know more about Sidhu by having him live in house for a week. Arvind agrees with this and as the story returns to the pre-credits scene, the viewers are left to assume about the happy marriage of the protagonists. ==Cast== * Hiran - Sidhu * Srabanti Chatterjee - Priya * Sabyasachi Chakrabarty - Aravind (Sidhu's father) * Sushanta Dutta — Kanaka Rao (Priya's father) * Laboni Sarkar — Lakshmi (Sidhu's mother) * Locket Chatterjee — Sidhu's sister-in-law * Subhasish Mukherjee — Satya (servant) * Kamalika Banerjee * Pritam Saha - Monti (Sidhu's nephew) ==Crew== * Producer:Ashoke Kumar Dhanuka * Director:Rabi Kinagi * Story: Bhaskar * Production Design: * Dialogue: * 'Lyrics: Goutam Susmit * Editing: * Cinematography: * Music Director: S.

The building, which serves as home to the local area committee of Fife Council, is a Category A listed building. ==History== The building was commissioned to replace the old town house in Bridge Street which had been completed in 1771. After rapid industrial growth in the local area, civic leaders decided they needed a more substantial facility and the old town house was demolished, to make way for the current building. The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 11 October 1876. It was designed by James Campbell Walker in the French Gothic style, built by Messrs W & J Hutchison and completed in May 1879. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage with twelve bays facing onto Kirkgate; the southern section featured a doorway with an octagonal turret above in the south east corner, while the northern section featured an elaborate doorway with a balcony and prominent four-face clock tower with bartizans in the north east corner. The structure included heraldic stones, recovered from the demolished 18th century town house, which may have originated from the now derelict Dunfermline Palace, a few hundred yards to the south. The stonework on the Bridge Street façade included busts of Malcolm Canmore, Queen Margaret, Robert the Bruce and Elizabeth de Burgh. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber on the first floor: it incorporated an oak hammerbeam roof. There were police cells in the basement of the building. The building was the headquarters of the royal burgh of Dunfermline until it was replaced by Dunfermline District under the wider Fife Regional Council in May 1975.McEwan Bert Dunfermline: The Post-War Years p.16. The building ceased to be a seat of government after the district council was abolished in 1996, under the Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994. Since then, the building has served as the home of the local area committee of Fife Council, as a venue for marriages and civil partnerships and as the local registration office.

The inhabitants of Waterloo wished to rebuild it but were prevented from doing so by financial difficulties. The wood-producers in the area paid a tax - every hundredth denier - on their sales to raise money, but even after 20 years the total sum raised was not enough. The new governor- general of the Spanish Netherlands, Don Francisco Antonio de Agurto, marquis de Gastañaga, then intervened. The marquis decided that building a new chapel on the site dedicated to saint Joseph (a spiritual model to Agurto's sovereign Charles II) would be a good way of remedying the sickly Charles's continuing and desperate sterility (despite his two marriages he had produced no heir). The ceremony of laying the first stone took place on 26 June 1687, in the presence of the Archbishopr of Mechelen. Like all buildings of this era, the edifice's architecture (attributed to the Wallonian architect Philippe Delsaux) borrows from the language of French Baroque classicism - a rotonda, a dome and above all a colonnaded portico refer to classical antiquity and give the edifice a wholly royal solemnity. This is reinforced by the presence of two lions on the portico's pediment. It is an imposing monument, in contrast to the modest size of the hamlets which it serves. Inaugurated with great ceremony on 19 February 1690, the marquis's pious intentions had no effect on Charles' sterility or on his own career - he was recalled to Madrid for not defending Mons well enough to prevent its capture by the French. ===Heyday=== The hazards of administrative divisions complicated the life of the new royal chapel. Built on the edge of the Sonian Forest, at the place called \\"petit Waterloo\\", it depended on the parish of Sint-Genesius-Rode and partly on the Diocese of Mechelen. Most of the hamlet, \\"grand Waterloo\\", was within the parish of Braine-l'Alleud, in the Diocese of Namur. To avoid split loyalties, the priest at Braine wanted to merge the chapel into his parish and, despite opposition, he temporarily managed to save the old priest at St. Genesius Rode the long and dangerous trip across the forest. The death of Rode's priest brought the question up again, with the Habsburg government Brussels keeping a firm hand on the nomination of the chapel's rector, since it was a royal foundation paid for by the Spanish government. Despite fierce proposals, the priest at Braine was separated in favour of Guillaume-Albert Le Roy, who had been chaplain for 3 years. ===French Revolution=== Shortly after the French Revolution and France's annexation of the southern Netherlands, the royal chapel was sold as state property of the French Republic. An unscrupulous Parisian businessman Thomas Gillet bought it at a knock-down price, having already acquired the neighbouring abbeys of Aywiers and Wauthier-Braine. From then on mass was celebrated secretly in a barn at the farm of Philippe Pastur's widow by the brave abbot Bierlaire, an opponent of the French occupied like most of his Brabançon fellow-priests. To cash in on his investments, the speculator dismantled the buildings and sold the materials, stripping the lead off the royal chapel's roof to sell to army suppliers to make rifle bullets, but local opposition was so strong that he hesitated to continue. In the meantime Napoleon signed the Concordat of 1801 with the pope and Waterloo became an autonomous parish. The town called on their fellow- countrymen's generosity to buy back the chapel and put it back in religious use, with the first ceremony being on 10 June 1806. The building contains several memorial plaques to officers falling at the Battle of Waterloo. In particular, several refer to Restalrig barracks in Edinburgh, home of the Scots Greys who made a famous cavalry charge during the battle. The baroque building proved too small to accommodate the congregations of up to 1,500 coming to mass here (a first expansion project had already been designed by Louis Montoyer in 1789 shortly before the Revolution). Having for a moment thought of demolishing the chapel anew and rebuilding a church at Mont-Saint- Jean, the idea of expansion resurfaced and was felt to be an easier option, since the town had access to sufficient land to do so. After some time raising gifts and subsidies, the works were completed in 1823 and 1824. A brick hall with a slate roof extended the dome towards the back. Closed off towards the street, it then joined the choir. The masterpieces of church furniture - the pulpit and the massive sculpted-oak communion benches - were recovered from the abbey of the Blanches Dames at Aywier. Thirty years later, between 1855 and 1858, the structure was again restored and extended, giving it three neo- classical naves, a dome on the west side, and a square brick tower with (from 1899) a 22m high copper spire. The interior was rebuilt in white stone and stucco, with Ionic pilasters supporting a heavy entablature on which were supported the crossed arches of the roof and the calotte of the cupola, lit up by a lantern and six bull's-eyes. The British participated financially in the project. The architects Émile Coulon and Joseph Dumont, major specialists in religious architecture, were brought in. A renowned organ maker called Pierre- Hubert Anneessens added such a good organ that it was sold a century later, in troubled circumstances, by a less scrupulous restorer (it is now in a small church in the southern Netherlands). ===20th century=== Despite the rotonda and portico being named as historic monuments in 1956, the church was in a poor state due to the two World Wars, storms and the first effects of car air- pollution. An urgent intervention project was launched on the 150th anniversary of the nearby Battle of Waterloo in 1965, with British help and led by the descendants of soldiers who fought there. The architect Albert Degand was put in charge of removing the 19th century additions which spoiled the structure, such as the rood screen, commemorative plaques, and the coatings covering the stone. The renovation was completed in 1972 and consecrated the division between the royal chapel and the body of the church. The entry arch towards the church was walled in, leaving only the a glass door evoking the dimensions and frame of the portico. ==The presbytery== To the right of the church, the former presbytery (built during the first expansion) shows a beautiful neo-classical façade. The entrepreneur was inspired by Louis Montoyer's plans, archived on the Revolution, to build this hôtel on a square plan, with a set of steps up to it formerly surmounted by a pedimented porch. Falling out of use in 1968 due to its poor state, it housed various associations, community services and even the mayoral office until it was renovated in 1995 to house the tourist federation of the new province of Brabant Wallon. Later when the tourist federation was dismantled, the tourist office for Waterloo and the neighbouring municipalities was established in the building. There is also a museum about the history of the commune of Waterloo on the first floor. ==See alsoReferences== Category:Baroque architecture in Belgium Category:Roman Catholic churches in Belgium Category:Church buildings with domes Category:Churches in Walloon Brabant Category:Waterloo, Belgium ","title":"Church of Saint Joseph, Waterloo"},{"id":"19246345","text":"The Electoral district of Wembley Beaches was a Legislative Assembly electorate in the state of Western Australia.

Wembley Beaches came into existence at the 1950 election, and was largely created from the northern and coastal sections of the Leederville, which had grown considerably in population in the years immediately following World War II. The seat included the inner suburbs of Floreat Park, Jolimont and Wembley, and areas further north including Doubleview, Gwelup, Innaloo, North Beach, Scarborough, Trigg and Watermans Bay. While reasonably safe for the Liberal Country League, Wembley Beaches was won for a term by the Labor, who were relatively strong in the Scarborough and Innaloo region throughout the seat's existence. The seat was abolished ahead of the 1962 election, with its area being split between the seats of Wembley and Karrinyup.

He is best known for his work in Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) under the ring name . Honda was quickly pushed as \\"Mr. Gannosuke\\" due to his resemblance to Ashiya Gannosuke and he began competing as Atsushi Onita's tag team partner in main event matches during his rookie year. He left the company in 1995 with his trainer Tarzan Goto due to differences with Onita and worked in International Wrestling Association (IWA) for nearly two years. He returned to FMW in 1997 and became the main rival of Hayabusa for the next four years. He was the company's most popular villain from 1997 to 1998 and the second top villain from then onwards. He would be a member of villainous groups Funk Masters of Wrestling, ZEN, Team No Respect and Shin Fuyuki-gun. He held many titles in his FMW career including being a one-time Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion and a two-time Independent Heavyweight Champion. He was also the winner of Over the Top tournament in 1999. He headlined many pay-per-view events for FMW including the company's flagship event Anniversary Show in 1998, 1999 and 2001. ==Early life== Masashi Honda was born in Nagasaki-shi, Nagasaki, Japan on June 20, 1968. He was a fan of professional wrestling since childhood and grew up watching New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Honda idolized Riki Choshu as his favorite wrestler and decided to follow in his footsteps and become a professional wrestler. He joined Kumamoto University in 1987 and excelled in weight training, where he befriended Eiji Ezaki and the two trained for a professional wrestling career. ==Professional wrestling careerEarly years (1987–1991)=== Honda made his professional wrestling debut at a small independent show on November 2, 1987, teaming with Eiji Ezaki against three upper classmen. They would cut their teeth in the small independent circuit shows for four years, before applying for the upstart promotion Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) in 1991. ===Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (1991-1995)=== In February 1991, Ezaki and Honda joined the FMW Dojo, where they were trained by Tarzan Goto. Ezaki would debut for FMW in May and Honda made his FMW debut a month later as a fan favorite against Akihito Ichihara on June 22, which Honda lost. He and Ezaki wrestled as a low-card tag team during the early matches of his career and against each other on the cards and would be utilized as preliminary talents, being used to lose against more established stars. Honda picked up his first win in FMW against Ezaki on June 26. The duo competed against each other in the opening match of the 2nd Anniversary Show, which Ezaki won. The following month, on October 14, Honda picked up his first major victory by winning a thirteen-man battle royal by last eliminating The Gladiator. His battle royal win elevated him to the upper mid-card while also competing in few main event matches as Atsushi Onita's partner. On October 22, Honda changed his ring name to Mr. Gannosuke, a nickname first given to him by his trainer Tarzan Goto during his training days due to Honda's resemblance to actor Ashiya Gannosuke. He would team with Onita in numerous street fights and deathmatches by the end of his rookie year. He suffered an injury in the fall of 1991 and returned to FMW on January 5, 1992, losing to Kevin Sullivan. Gannosuke suffered another injury on July 28 and was sidelined for the rest of the year. He returned on January 5, 1993, where he lost to Koji Nakagawa in the opening match of the show. A third injury ensued during a tag team match on April 23 when he and Atsushi Onita lost to Big Titan and The Gladiator after Gladiator punched hard in Gannosuke's jaw, thus breaking it. He returned to FMW on June 15 by defeating Eiji Ezaki. At Summer Spectacular, Gannosuke teamed with Sambo Asako to take on Big Titan and The Gladiator in a tag team match. Gannosuke pinned Gladiator by debuting his new finisher, the Gannosuke Clutch to gain a major upset win over Gladiator. In early 1994, Gannosuke was paired with his mentor Tarzan Goto in a tournament for the new Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship. They defeated Sabu and Damian in the quarter-final, a Barbed Wire Street Fight and the team of Mr. Pogo and Goro Tsurumi in the semi-final, a Barbed Wire Deathmatch and then lost to Big Titan and The Gladiator in a No Ropes Barbed Wire Deathmatch in the final of Block A. They would be moved to the losing teams' Block B, where they were defeated by Atsushi Onita and Katsutoshi Niiyama in the final of Block B, a No Ropes Barbed Wire Deathmatch. Gannosuke would then team with Sambo Asako to defeat Goro Tsurumi and Hideki Hosaka at 5th Anniversary Show. Gannosuke began elevating his status in the summer of 1994 by picking up a major victory against Sambo Asako at Summer Spectacular. He then joined forces with Atsushi Onita and his allies to feud with the upstart faction W*ING Alliance. On November 23, the team of Gannosuke, Onita and Katsutoshi Niiyama took on W*ING members Mr. Pogo, Yukihiro Kanemura and The Gladiator in a Penalty Box Elimination No Ropes Barbed Wire Street Fight Deathmatch, during which Gannosuke was eliminated by Gladiator and suffered an injury, which put him out of action for nearly two months. He returned to FMW on January 5, 1995, where he teamed with FMW fellows Tarzan Goto, Katsutoshi Niiyama and Tetsuhiro Kuroda against W*ING's Mr. Pogo, The Gladiator, Yukihiro Kanemura and Hisakatsu Oya in a losing effort. A month later, on February 24, Gannosuke won his first championship, the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship with Onita by defeating Mr. Pogo and The Gladiator. They dropped the title to Pogo and Yukihiro Kanemura on March 7. Gannosuke and his mentor Tarzan Goto no-showed the April 22 event, and the following day, the two along with Flying Kid Ichihara announced that they were leaving FMW due to Goto's refusal of losing to Onita at 6th Anniversary Show. This also led Gannosuke and Katsutoshi Niiyama's scheduled match against Hisakatsu Oya and Ricky Fuji at the event to be cancelled. ===Big Japan Pro Wrestling and International Wrestling Association of Japan (1995-1996)=== Upon leaving FMW, Tarzan Goto, Mr. Gannosuke and Flying Kid Ichihara joined the upstart deathmatch wrestling promotion Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW), where they debuted on May 30 with a win over Kendo Nagasaki, Giant Korean and Kim Soppo. They soon left BJW and joined International Wrestling Association of Japan in July, where the trio formed a stable Shin-FMW and were heavily pushed as the company's top villains. Gannosuke and Tarzan Goto also made an appearance for Wrestle Association R's 3rd Anniversary Show, where the duo defeated Jado and Gedo. At IWA Japan's Kawasaki Dream, Gannosuke participated in the well received King of the Deathmatch tournament, losing to Tiger Jeet Singh in a Barbed Wire Board and Chain Deathmatch in the quarter-final round. On October 1, Gannosuke and Tarzan Goto defeated Cactus Jack and Tracy Smothers to win the World Tag Team Championship. On December 9, Gannosuke and Goto defeated Jack and Tiger Jeet Singh in the final of a tag team tournament to win the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship and held both sets of tag team championships. Despite holding two sets of tag team titles, IWA Japan lost tons of money and suspended operations. Shin-FMW left the company in October 1996, forcing Gannosuke and Goto to vacate both titles. ===Tokyo Pro Wrestling (1996)=== Shin-FMW also made a few appearances in Tokyo Pro Wrestling (TPW) during their time in IWA Japan in mid-1996. The ill-fated promotion closed down after producing its last event on December 7. ===Return to FMW=== Funk Masters of Wrestling and ZEN (1997) On January 5, 1997, Mr. Gannosuke and Flying Kid Ichihara returned to FMW, confronting Hayabusa, upset that Hayabusa did not leave FMW with him in 1995. Gannosuke and Ichihara established themselves as villains and joined Terry Funk's Funk Masters of Wrestling. This marked the beginning of a historic and long-lasting rivalry between Gannosuke and Hayabusa. Gannosuke made his in-ring return to FMW on February 18 as he and Hisakatsu Oya defeated the team of Hayabusa and Ricky Fuji. Gannosuke went on a vicious streak, defeating other wrestlers and calling them victories over Hayabusa. At 8th Anniversary Show, Gannosuke wrestled Hayabusa in their first singles encounter, a mask vs. hair match, which Hayabusa won. However, Hayabusa suggested to Gannosuke that he would not cut his hair if Gannosuke left Funk Masters of Wrestling and Hayabusa initiated a handshake but Gannosuke attacked him and ripped off his mask and attempted to blow a fireball on Hayabusa before Jinsei Shinzaki made the save. This led to Gannosuke, wearing a purple Hayabusa mask, attacked Shinzaki with a stick during Shinzaki's entrance before a match at a Michinoku Pro Wrestling (MPW) show on June 21. He then proceeded to burn Hayabusa's mask and also beginning to feud with Shinzaki. On August 5, Mr. Gannosuke won the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship with Funk Masters of Wrestling teammates Hisakatsu Oya and The Gladiator by defeating Hayabusa, Ricky Fuji and Koji Nakagawa in the quarter-final and Fuyuki-Gun (Kodo Fuyuki, Jado, and Gedo) in the final. Two weeks later, on August 21, Gannosuke and Oya defeated W*ING Kanemura and Hido to win the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship. On August 31, Funk Masters of Wrestling lost the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship to Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka and Koji Nakagawa. At Kawasaki Legend: Fall Spectacular, Gannosuke and Oya successfully defended the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship against Jado and Gedo. On October 14, Gannosuke defeated Jinsei Shinzaki after attacking him from behind. During this time, he got over with the fans as the company's top villain due to getting heel heat after the departure of Terry Funk. On October 19, Gannosuke and Oya lost the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship to ZEN's Atsushi Onita and Yukihiro Kanemura. After losing the title, Gannosuke and Oya left Funk Masters of Wrestling and jumped to ZEN. Two days later, Gannosuke and Oya defeated The Gladiator and Super Leather after Gladiator attacked Leather and abandoned Funk Masters of Wrestling. On November 28, Gannosuke teamed with his ZEN teammate Yukihiro Kanemura and they defeated Hayabusa and Masato Tanaka to win the vacant Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship and the two formed a very successful tag team, even surpassing their leader Atsushi Onita as the top villains of FMW due to them getting the biggest heel heat from the crowd. Friction arose within ZEN as Onita put himself in the main event of the December 19 show in the Super Extreme Wrestling War tour against Masato Tanaka, instead of Gannosuke and Kanemura's Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship defense against Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki, which the duo felt deserved to be the main event of the show and it led to a heated argument between Gannosuke and Onita. Gannosuke and Kanemura successfully defended the title against Hayabusa and Shinzaki. On the final day of the tour on December 22, the team of Onita, Gannosuke and Kanemura took on Hayabusa, Jinsei Shinzaki and Masato Tanaka in a WarGames match, during which Gannosuke and Kanemura showed tactics of dissension with Onita and turned on Onita after Onita was pinned by Hayabusa. They attacked Onita until Koji Nakagawa made the rescue and then Gannosuke, Kanemura and Hido left ZEN to form their own freelance group alongside Miss Mongol. This led Onita to turn fan favorite and Gannosuke cemented his place as the top villain of FMW. Double Champion and Gannosuke's Outlaws (1998-1999) Impressed by Honda due to his heel heat and increasing popularity, FMW's head booker Go Ito pushed Gannosuke as the company's top main event star. On January 6, 1998, Gannosuke defeated Masato Tanaka to win the FMW Double Championship (the unified Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and the Independent Heavyweight Championship) to claim his first world championship reigns. A day later, Gannosuke, Yukihiro Kanemura and Hido took on Atsushi Onita, Koji Nakagawa and Tetsuhiro Kuroda in a street fight at ZEN's first promoted show. Gannosuke's team lost the match, but they attacked ZEN after the match and Fuyuki-Gun joined Gannosuke's group in the assault and the two factions subsequently merged to form Team No Respect, with Gannosuke becoming the leader of the group. On January 16, Gannosuke, Kanemura and Jado defeated Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka and Hisakatsu Oya to win the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. Gannosuke began mocking Jinsei Shinzaki by appearing in his outfit and using Shinzaki's mannerisms and moves during his matches. On February 13, Gannosuke's team lost the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship to ZEN's Atsushi Onita, Koji Nakagawa and Tetsuhiro Kuroda. On March 29, Gannosuke and Kanemura lost the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship to TNR teammates Kodo Fuyuki and Hido. On April 21, Gannosuke lost to Jinsei Shinzaki to end their year-lasting feud. The following week, Gannosuke lost the Double Championship to his rival Hayabusa at FMW's first pay-per-view event 9th Anniversary Show: Entertainment Wrestling Live on April 30. During the match, Gannosuke dislocated his knee, which required reconstructive surgery and to be out of action for six months and then Kodo Fuyuki took over as the leader of Team No Respect. Gannosuke made his first appearance since losing the title on May 25 for a Brief Brothers skit with Yukihiro Kanemura, during which the two began to bicker with each other. He would then make an appearance in Jinsei Shinzaki's outfit at Welcome to the Darkside pay-per-view on August 22, where he cost The Darkside of Hayabusa, a match against Koji Nakagawa, who had joined TNR during Gannosuke's injury. He made his full-time return on October 6 after Tetsuhiro Kuroda defeated Yukihiro Kanemura and began praying instead of shaking hands with Kuroda, which set up a match between Gannosuke and Kuroda on November 20, where Gannosuke made his in-ring return and defeated Kuroda. After the match, Kanemura confronted Gannosuke on his allegiance to TNR but Gannosuke did not answer and simply walked away, thus quietly leaving Team No Respect. He then entered the Over the Top Tournament to determine the #1 contender for the Double Championship on March 19, 1999. Gannosuke defeated Koji Nakagawa in the first round, Yukihiro Kanemura in the quarter-final, Hido in the semi-final and Hisakatsu Oya in the final round of the tournament on January 5, 1999 to become the #1 contender for the titles and earn the title shot. Following his tournament victory, Gannosuke formed a group with Hideki Hosaka and Super Leather called Gannosuke's Outlaws, which became the top villainous group in FMW due to Team No Respect turning into fan favorites. Gannosuke gained his first singles win over Hayabusa on February 21. On February 27, Hisakatsu Oya turned on Hayabusa during a match against Gannosuke and Hosaka and then Oya joined Gannosuke's Outlaws and then received his title shot against Kodo Fuyuki for the Double Championship on March 19, where he failed to win the title. Gannosuke would then team with Oya to participate in a round robin tournament for the vacant Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship. They scored eight points in the tournament and were eliminated from the tournament. They subsequently began feuding with Daisuke Ikeda and Muhammad Yone after losing to them in a tournament match on March 29. Gannosuke and Oya defeated Ikeda and Yone in a rematch on May 3. Later in the show, Gannosuke's Outlaws and Team No Respect formed an alliance as TNR helped Gannosuke's Outlaws in laying out an assault on Daisuke Ikeda. Two days later, on May 5, the combined alliance of Gannosuke's Outlaws and Team No Respect defeated Battlarts' team in an elimination tag team match. Team No Respect reunion (1999) Later in the show, Gannosuke showed up during Kodo Fuyuki's Double Championship title defense against Tetsuhiro Kuroda and reunited Team No Respect as all the members of TNR began dancing to TNR's theme song Come Out and Play. The group helped Fuyuki in retaining the title against Kuroda, resulting in Gannosuke ending Gannosuke's Outlaws and rejoining TNR. On May 18, Fuyuki split the Double Championship and awarded the Independent Heavyweight Championship to Gannosuke. Despite holding the title, Gannosuke's status dwindled from a main eventer to being Fuyuki's assistant along with the rest of TNR. He participated in a six-man tag team tournament with Yukihiro Kanemura and Jado for the new WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship. The trio scored three points in the tournament, thus directly qualifying for the semi-final on July 31 pay- per-view during the Goodbye Hayabusa tour, where they would lose to the team of Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda. Gannosuke dropped the Independent Heavyweight Championship to Masato Tanaka at Haunted House. The match was well received and voted FMW's Match of the Year of 1999. Two days later, at Hayabusa Graduation Ceremony, Gannosuke and Jado defeated Flying Kid Ichihara and Naohiko Yamazaki. Gannosuke would then wrestle Hayabusa at Last Match in the last match of Eiji Ezaki's Hayabusa character, challenging Hayabusa for the Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship. Hayabusa retained the title and it would be the last match for the Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship as the title, along with the Independent Heavyweight Championship would be retired in favor of the new WEW Single Championship. On August 27, Hayabusa debuted his new character H in an elimination tag team match against Team No Respect, during which H injured Gannosuke's knee, reminiscent of Hayabusa injuring him the previous year at 9th Anniversary Show. The following week, on September 3, Honda appeared in Hayabusa's attire and mask and attacked H during a six-man tag team match and proclaimed that he was the real Hayabusa. Gannosuke would then use Hayabusa's entrance theme and compete as Hayabusa and embarrassed H by filming a porn video with Chocoball Mukai as Hayabusa. This led to an anus explosion match between H and Hayabusa on October 29, which ended in a no contest after Hayabusa handcuffed H to the corner and blew a firecracker in his ass to cause it to explode. Honda would then go through an identity crisis in storyline if he was Hayabusa, Masashi Honda or Mr. Gannosuke. H and Hayabusa competed in the main event of the 10th Anniversary Show on November 23 in a match, in which Shawn Michaels served as the special guest referee. During the match, Hayabusa had enough of the identity crisis and he removed his mask to compete as Gannosuke. H won the match and after the match, H and Hayabusa finally made peace by making friends with each other and ending their rivalry and as a result, Gannosuke turned fan favorite for the first time since 1995. Teaming and feuding with Hayabusa (1999-2001) Gannosuke's transition into a fan favorite led to him to quit Team No Respect and he formed a tag team with H. On December 1, H and Gannosuke defeated Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Hisakatsu Oya to capture the WEW World Tag Team Championship. In the meanwhile, Masato Tanaka became upset at H forgiving Gannosuke so easily and forming a team with him and did not celebrate with them after the trio defeated Team No Respect members Kintaro Kanemura, Koji Nakagawa and Gedo in a match on December 3. H and Gannosuke successfully defended their title against Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Hisakatsu Oya on December 11. On December 12, H and Gannosuke defeated Kuroda and Tanaka in a match and after the match, Tanaka refused to shake H and Gannosuke's hands while Kuroda shook their hands. On January 5, 2000, Gannosuke, H, Hisakatsu Oya and Ricky Fuji represented FMW against the ECW Japan team of Kodo Fuyuki, Kyoko Inoue, Balls Mahoney and Pitbull #1, which FMW's team lost. On January 7, H and Gannosuke lost a match to Fuyuki and Inoue, setting up a title defense of the WEW Tag Team Championship against Fuyuki and Inoue on February 25, where H and Gannosuke lost the title. Honda would then take time off and returned to FMW on April 11 to team with H against ECW Japan's Masato Tanaka and Balls Mahoney. H was injured early in the match and then returned as Hayabusa by the end of the match but Gannosuke's team still lost the match. At 11th Anniversary Show: Backdraft, Gannosuke represented FMW against ECW Japan's Sabu and the match ended in a no contest after Gannosuke blew a fireball on Sabu. Gannosuke would shortly after injure his leg and wore a cast and a crutch on his leg. On May 28, Gannosuke competed against H and Tetsuhiro Kuroda in a three-way dance to determine the #1 contender for the WEW World Heavyweight Championship, with champion Kodo Fuyuki as the special guest referee. Gannosuke turned on H by hitting him with his crutch after H eliminated Kuroda and then Gannosuke defeated H, with Fuyuki's help and turned into a villain. He then joined Fuyuki's new group Shin Fuyuki-Gun. Gannosuke kidnapped Ricky Fuji on June 6 and held him hostage in a forest and threatened to blow him if H and his partner did not defeat Kodo Fuyuki and GOEMON on June 16. H and his partner Hayabusa would win the match but the explosion still occurred and it was revealed that Gannosuke and Fuji had left the spot before the explosion. On July 28, Gannosuke kidnapped Ricky Fuji once again from a restaurant with the help of Flying Kid Ichihara but Fuji would escape after Gannosuke made Ichihara incharge, who then left. On July 28, the team of Gannosuke, Kodo Fuyuki and Jinsei Shinzaki lost to Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka and Hisakatsu Oya after Shinzaki turned on his team. Gannosuke renewed his rivalry with Hayabusa and the two competed against each other in a match on August 28, which Gannosuke lost. On September 15, the team of Mr. Gannosuke, Kodo Fuyuki and new Shin Fuyuki-Gun recruit Shinjuku Shark defeated H, Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Hisakatsu Oya to win the WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship. Two days later, they lost the titles to Jado, Gedo and Kaori Nakayama when Fuyuki was pinned by Nakayama. Gannosuke began growing upset at his teammates. On September 26, Gannosuke and GOEMON defeated Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Onryo in a match where a baseball player interfered on Kuroda's behalf. Later at the show, Gannosuke confronted FMW President Shoichi Arai on the direction that FMW was going through and had turned from a deathmatch wrestling federation to a joke for the sake of sports entertainment and after Arai refused to listen to him, Gannosuke attacked him, which led Arai to fire him from FMW. Gannosuke began feuding with Kuroda by costing him a match against Chocoball Mukai on October 7 and against Gedo on October 29, leading to Arai allowing Gannosuke to compete in a match against Kuroda at Deep Throat, which stipulated that Gannosuke would be reinstated if he won but he would be forced to retire if he lost. Gannosuke would lose the match and retired in storyline. In reality, he needed time off due to the birth of his daughter. Gannosuke made an appearance on December 20 under his real name Masashi Honda and provided color commentary for the main event match along with the injured Hayabusa. In the meanwhile, Tetsuhiro Kuroda had turned heel and joined Shin Fuyuki-Gun. Honda returned to FMW on April 1, 2001 and introduced his protege Banji Takada, who would lose to Yoshihito Sasaki. Honda shook hands with Sasaki and teased a face turn, which led Shoichi Arai to reinstate him as a wrestler. Later that night, Gannosuke helped Tetsuhiro Kuroda to defeat Kodo Fuyuki for the WEW World Heavyweight Championship by hitting Fuyuki with a chair and turned into a villain. Gannosuke became a member of Kuroda's Team Kuroda group and aligned himself with Kuroda in his feud with Hayabusa and The Great Sasuke. Gannosuke made his in-ring return on April 15 by teaming with Mammoth Sasaki and Tetsuhiro Kuroda to defeat The Great Sasuke, GOEMON and Onryo. Kuroda and Gannosuke competed against Hayabusa and Sasuke in an Exploding 15000 Volt Thunderbolt Octagon Cage Bomb Deathmatch at 12th Anniversary Show, which Kuroda and Gannosuke lost. On May 22, Gannosuke and Mammoth Sasaki unsuccessfully challenged GOEMON and Onryo for the WEW World Tag Team Championship. On June 8, Kodo Fuyuki announced that he had sold his stock to Tokyopop and wanted to sell FMW to Tokyopop and gave the FMW roster, a choice to side either with him or Shoichi Arai. Gannosuke opted to side with Fuyuki while Kuroda sided with Arai and turned face, leading to the breakup of Team Kuroda. Later that night, Gannosuke teamed with Kintaro Kanemura and the duo defeated Hayabusa and Kuroda in the night's main event. Gannosuke would then be allied with Fuyuki and feud with Hayabusa and the FMW team. On July 2, Gannosuke introduced his new on-screen girlfriend Mirei to FMW. On July 30, Gannosuke, Kodo Fuyuki and Kintaro Kanemura defeated Hisakatsu Oya, Ricky Fuji and Flying Kid Ichihara to capture the WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship. On August 11, Gannosuke defeated Kanemura to gain a lead for Tokyopop in a three- match series between FMW and Tokyopop with the ownership of FMW on the line. Later that night, Hayabusa lost the WEW World Heavyweight Championship to Kintaro Kanemura, which led to Tokyopop gaining the ownership of FMW. On September 5, Gannosuke and Mammoth Sasaki defeated GOEMON and Onryo to win the WEW World Tag Team Championship. On September 9, Gannosuke, Fuyuki and Kanemura lost the WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship to Hayabusa, Tetsuhiro Kuroda and GOEMON. The following month, on October 9, Gannosuke and Sasaki lost the WEW World Tag Team Championship to Hayabusa and Tetsuhiro Kuroda. Final feuds (2001-2002) Gannosuke got involved in a feud between his on-screen girlfriend Mirei and Makiko over the affections of Gannosuke. On November 5, Gannosuke turned fan favorite by cutting a worked shoot promo in which he showed support for Hayabusa, who had been recently injured on October 22. On November 23, Makiko defeated Mirei in an evening gown match for Gannosuke. Later at the show, Gannosuke teamed with Mammoth Sasaki as the two defeated Biomonster DNA and Dr. Luther to win their second WEW World Tag Team Championship. Later that night, they vacated the titles and joined forces with Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Kintaro Kanemura to feud with Kodo Fuyuki who had turned on FMW to align himself with Genichiro Tenryu's WAR alliance. On December 9, the FMW alliance defeated WAR's team of Tenryu, Fuyuki, Arashi and Koki Kitahara to win the feud.

During the match, Gannosuke broke his both ankles after Grimes delivered a Moonsault on Gannosuke through a table. With both Hayabusa and Gannosuke out of action, FMW closed a month later on February 15 due to bankruptcy. ===Wrestlings Marvelous Future=== Brand Double Cross and The GUN's (2002-2003) Gannosuke made his comeback to the ring for Hayabusa's new promotion Wrestlings Marvelous Future (WMF) at the pre-debut show on August 18, where he teamed with Garuda, Onryo and Ikeda-kun to defeat Ricky Fuji, GOEMON, Mammoth Sasaki and Soldier in an eight-man tag team match. He established himself as a fan favorite by teaming with Jinsei Shinzaki to defeat Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Hisakatsu Oya in the company's debut show The Independence Day. Gannosuke would initially feud with the Brand Double Cross faction. At Marvelous Days 1st, Gannosuke lost to Satoshi Kojima. On December 21, Gannosuke and Shinzaki took on Kuroda and GOEMON. The match ended in a no contest when Gannosuke turned on Shinzaki and became a villain as he aligned himself with GOEMON and GOEMON turned on Kuroda and took him out of Brand Double Cross, with Gannosuke then replacing Kuroda and joining the group as the newest member. Gannosuke would then begin a rivalry with Shinzaki as well as WMF's ace Mammoth Sasaki. On February 15, 2003, Gannosuke and Hisakatsu Oya lost a tag team match to Shinzaki and Sasaki. On February 23, Gannosuke brought out Katsumi Hirano as \\"Hayabusa\\" and defeated Ricky Fuji and Tetsuhiro Kuroda. He then formed a group called The GUN's with Hirano as Mr. Iwaonosuke and Ichiro Yaguchi as Mr. Rocknosuke and both men modelled each other after Gannosuke. Gannosuke defeated Shinzaki in a match at Marvelous Days 2nd. Gannosuke began a rivalry with Mr. Pogo, which led to a street fight between the duo on May 11, which Gannosuke won. He would then lose a match to rival Mammoth Sasaki on May 24. At Marvelous Days 3rd on July 25, The GUN's lost a street fight to Kintaro Kanemura, Mammoth Sasaki and Tetsuhiro Kuroda in a match which stipulated that WMF would be forced to end if GUN's won. The loss marked the end of GUN's. Various feuds (2003-2006) Gannosuke formed a group called Apache Army with several fellow FMW alumni and various wrestlers from the Japanese independent circuit including Kintaro Kanemura, Hido, Taka Michinoku, Gentaro and Takashi Sasaki and the group would compete in various independent promotions. At WMF's 1st Anniversary Show, Gannosuke, Hido and Kanemura defeated Ikeda-kun, Mammoth Sasaki and Tetsuhiro Kuroda. At Marvelous Days 5th, the team of Gentaro, Kanemura and Gannosuke defeated Yuko Miyamoto, Mineo Fujita and Seiji Ikeda. At Marvelous Days 6th on November 20, Mammoth Sasaki brought Genichiro Tenryu as \\"Hayabusa\\" against Gannosuke and Hido in a street fight, which Gannosuke's team lost. Gannosuke then got involved in Apache Army's feud with his idol Riki Choshu's Fighting World of Japan Pro Wrestling. At Marvelous Days 7th, Gannosuke would team with Chocoball Mukai and GOEMON as the trio lost to Koichiro Kimura, Ricky Fuji and Yoji Anjo. In 2004, it was announced that WMF would be closed down due to financial loss and the promotion held its final show Marvelous Days 8th on February 11, where Gannosuke challenged Kensuke Sasaki for the Hawai'i Championship Wrestling (HCW) Kamehameha Heritage World Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort. He then turned fan favorite as he ended his rivalry with Mammoth Sasaki as the two embraced and hugged each other and they announced that WMF was not ending and going on a hiatus instead as it marked the end of the promotion's Chapter 1 and it would return in the summer of 2004. The promotion returned on August 7, where Gannosuke teamed with GOEMON against Seiji Ikeda and Garuda in a losing effort on the occasion of the promotion's second anniversary. On August 29, Gannosuke defeated Ikeda on the second night of the promotion's second anniversary. In the fall of 2004, Gannosuke participated in the WMF Round Robin Tournament, in which he qualified for the semi-final round by scoring eight points and lost to Mammoth Sasaki in the semi-final on February 20, 2005. Gannosuke would then represent WMF in a feud against Soldier, who brought his allies from International Wrestling Cartel (IWC). At Super Hardcore Night, Gannosuke teamed with Gosaku Goshogawara against Soldier and Balls Mahoney, which Gannosuke's team lost. At Kawagoe Decisive Battle, Gannosuke brought Kensuke Sasaki as his tag team partner against Soldier and Mahoney, with Gannosuke's team winning the match. Gannosuke began financing WMF personally after Laing, Inc. stopped financial support of the company. On July 31, Gannosuke defeated Mammoth Sasaki in a street fight to end their rivalry. In the fall of 2005, Gannosuke began feuding with Soldier and his new group New Generation Army, which aimed at eliminating old veteran wrestlers from WMF and giving place to new and young wrestlers and the two groups feuded with each other throughout 2006. In 2007, Gannosuke teamed with Soldier to participate in the Marvelous Future Tag Team Tournament, in which they defeated Onryo and Yuko Miyamoto in the quarter-final but lost to Mineo Fujita and Kitten Kid in the semi-final. KHM Army (2007-2008) On April 14, Gannosuke announced that he would compete as a freelancer on the Japanese independent circuit and refused Soldier's challenge for a singles match and thus denounced himself as a WMF wrestler. However, Gannosuke appeared on May 19 as the mystery tag team partner of GOEMON and Hideki Hosaka against the WMF team of Soldier, Mineo Fujita and Kengo Takai, during which Gannosuke turned villain and Fujita turned on Soldier, allowing Gannosuke to defeat Soldier for the victory. Gannosuke formed a group with Fujita, Hosaka, GOEMON, Leatherface and Yasu Orano called KHM as the top villainous group to feud with WMF. The KHM Army wrestled the WMF and feuded with the likes of Soldier and Kitten Kid throughout the year. On November 24, KHM Army defeated Kamui, Kankuro Hirano, Soldier and SYU in an elimination tag team match. However, KHM Army would lose a six-man tag team match against Kamui, Kitten Kid and Soldier on December 26. On February 17, 2008, Gannosuke announced that he was ending the KHM Army, which marked the end of the rivalry between KHM Army and WMF. Gannosuke announced his retirement at the end of the year and decided to end the WMF promotion and then quit the company. He returned to WMF for only one match against Kamui on July 27, which Gannosuke won. This was his last match in the WMF and he closed the promotion a month later on August 31. ===Independent circuit (2002-2008)=== After the closure of FMW, Honda primarily wrestled for its successor WMF, but also competed in the Japanese independent circuit. He was one of the founding members of Apache Army group, along with Kintaro Kanemura and several other wrestlers. Apache Army invaded Pro Wrestling Zero- One and the two sides battled each other during the fall of 2003 and early 2004. On December 25, Gannosuke and Tetsuhiro Kuroda defeated Jun Kasai and Tengu Kaiser to win the vacant All Asia Tag Team Championship. They lost the title to Great Kosuke and Shiryu at an All Japan Pro Wrestling show on January 2, 2004. In 2004, Apache Army began an interpromotional rivalry with Riki Choshu's Fighting World of Japan Pro Wrestling, which led to the group making appearances in WJ. Gannosuke was removed from Apache Army due to differences with Kintaro Kanemura and would then continue to focus on reviving his WMF promotion. He made frequent appearances in Kings Road, Muga World Pro Wrestling, Ice Ribbon, Dramatic Dream Team, Fuyuki Army Promotion, Guts World Pro Wrestling and also promoted his own shows under the \\"Kishindo\\" banner, named after his FMW theme song. On January 10, 2005, Gannosuke appeared for a Big Japan Pro Wrestling show, where he mimicked his idol Riki Choshu as Riki Ganshu and teamed with Riki Sensyu to defeat Abdullah Kobayashi and Poison Julie Sawada by disqualification. On July 29, 2007, Gannosuke, SUZKI and Yuji Hino defeated Alexander Otsuka, Devilman Mystery and Masked Mystery to win the GWC Six-Man Tag Team Championship for Guts World Pro Wrestling. They lost the title to Yuki Sato, Dick Togo and Ryan Upin on October 21. On May 1, 2008, Gannosuke announced that he would retire from professional wrestling at the end of the year. During this time, Gannosuke reunited with various FMW wrestlers and was able to compete in the Apache Army promotion as well due to Kintaro Kanemura being expelled from Apache Army due to a sexual harassment scandal. He formed a stable with fellow FMW alumni Tetsuhiro Kuroda, Koji Nakagawa and Ricky Fuji called FMW Legends Army and the group feuded with the Apache Army stable. This rivalry led to Gannosuke taking on Mammoth Sasaki in a No Ropes Barbed Wire Deathmatch on October 10, which Gannosuke lost and then Gannosuke appreciated Sasaki on his performance and added him to his FMW Legends Army faction. On December 27, Gannosuke promoted his retirement show, where he teamed with Jinsei Shinzaki and Mammoth Sasaki to defeat Masato Tanaka, Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Kintaro Kanemura in a street fight. ===Guts World Pro Wrestling (2014-2018)=== After a six-year absence from the ring, Gannosuke signed a contract with Guts World Pro Wrestling and appeared as a ring announcer for a Guts World show on September 6, 2014. During the show, he was attacked by Masao Orihara after Orihara lost a match to Guts Ishijima and then Ishijima asked Gannosuke to come out of retirement and team with him to take on Orihara and a masked mystery partner at the promotion's 10th Anniversary Show the next month and Gannosuke tweeted the following day that he would be returning to the ring as a full-time wrestler for Guts World at the 10th Anniversary Show. Gannosuke made his in-ring return at 10th Anniversary Show, on October 12, where he teamed with Guts Ishijima to defeat Tonpachi Machine Guns (Masao Orihara and Masked Mystery Partner). In February 2015, Gannosuke and Ishijima participated in a tournament for the vacant GWC Tag Team Championship, in which they defeated Tsuneo Yoshie and Ultraman Robin in the quarter-final and Takumi Tsukamoto and The Winger in the semi-final and lost to Hattoshite Good in the final. On July 19, Gannosuke unsuccessfully challenged Daisuke for the GWC Single Championship. On March 22, 2016 Gannosuke defeated Tatsuhiko Yoshino to become the #1 contender for the title and then defeated Daisuke to win the title on May 8. He made his first successful title defense against Gentaro on June 17. He lost the title to Masked Mystery on September 11. Gannosuke held his retirement ceremony on April 15 at Guts World's final show, where he competed in his final wrestling match, teaming with Michio Kageyama against Tatsumi Fujinami and Hiro Saito in a losing effort. After the event, Honda closed Guts World Pro Wrestling and retired from wrestling. ===Return to independent circuit (2015-2018)=== Although primarily wrestling for Guts World Pro Wrestling, Mr. Gannosuke also wrestles on several independent promotions and promotes his own wrestling events under the Kishindo banner as well. He debuted for Pro Wrestling FREEDOMS on May 1, 2015 as a member of Kamui's reformed WMF Army by teaming with Onryo against Tatsuhito Takaiwa and Toru Sugiura. Gannosuke and Onryo won the match. Gannosuke continues to wrestle occasionally for FREEDOMS. He debuted for the resurrected FMW on March 22, 2017 at the occasion of the first anniversary of Hayabusa's death. Gannosuke teamed with Raijin Yaguchi, Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Tomohiko Hashimoto against Atsushi Onita, Hideki Hosaka, Mammoth Sasaki and Ricky Fuji in an eight-man tag team match, which Gannosuke's team lost. In 2018, Gannosuke announced his retirement from professional wrestling, promoting his last Kishindo Returns Final show on March 27, where he teamed with Hayabucha against Yuko Miyamoto and Isami Kodaka in a losing effort. ==Personal life== Although portrayed on screen as longtime rivals, Honda and Hayabusa (Eiji Ezaki) were good friends with each other. Honda is also friends with Kintaro Kanemura. Their friendship suffered in 2002 after the demise of FMW when Gannosuke lured away half of the FMW roster for his Wrestlings Marvelous Future (WMF) and refused to compete in Kodo Fuyuki's World Entertainment Wrestling (WEW) and Kanemura remained loyal to Fuyuki. In 2004, the two broke their friendship over combining their WMF and Fuyuki Army Promotions and Kanemura used his links to prevent Gannosuke from competing in other major promotions in Japan. They patched up in 2008 and Gannosuke convinced Kanemura to compete in his retirement match on December 27, 2008, which Kanemura accepted. Gannosuke now promotes shows under his own name about every four months and is a trainer for Emi Sakura's Ice Ribbon promotion. He also runs his bar called Nov Bar every night. ==Championships and accomplishments== *All Japan Pro Wrestling :*All Asia Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Tetsuhiro Kuroda *Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling / World Entertainment Wrestling :*FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship (1 time) :*FMW Independent Heavyweight Championship (2 times) :*FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship (3 times) – with Atsushi Onita (1), Hisakatsu Oya (1), and Yukihiro Kanemura (1) :*FMW World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with The Gladiator and Hisakatsu Oya (1), Yukihiro Kanemura and Jado (1) :*WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship (2 times) – with Kodo Fuyuki and Shinjuku Shark (1), Kodo Fuyuki and Kintaro Kanemura (1) :*WEW Tag Team Championship (4 times) – with H (1), Mammoth Sasaki (2), and Tetsuhiro Kuroda (1) :*FMW World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship Tournament (1997) – with The Gladiator and Hisakatsu Oya :*Over the Top Tournament (1999) :*WEW Tag Team Championship Tournament (2001) – with Tetsuhiro Kuroda *Guts World Pro-Wrestling :*GWC Single Championship (1 time) :*GWC 6-Man Tag Team Championship (1 time) — with Yuji Kito and Suzki *International Wrestling Association of Japan :*IWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Tarzan Goto *National Wrestling Alliance :*NWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Tarzan Goto ==NotesReferences *Gannosuke's bio Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Japanese male professional wrestlers Category:People from Nagasaki Category:Professional wrestling promoters ","title":"Mr. Gannosuke"},{"id":"19246357","text":" SS City of Peking was an iron-hulled steamship built in 1874 by Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works, Chester, Pennsylvania for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. City of Peking and her sister ship City of Tokio were at the time of construction the largest vessels ever built in the United States, and the second largest in the world behind the British leviathan .Swann p. 81. Like Great Eastern, construction of the two Pacific Mail ships was to be plagued with financial difficulties, which threatened to bankrupt the shipbuilder. Unlike Great Eastern, however, which was a commercial failure, City of Peking would go on to have a long and successful commercial career. In addition to her cargoes, City of Peking brought many Chinese and Japanese immigrants to the United States, and later served as a troopship in the Spanish–American War. ==Construction== In 1865 the Pacific Mail Steamship Company had obtained a $500,000 annual subsidy from the U.S. Congress to operate a steam packet between the United States, China and Japan. On June 1, 1872, Congress approved an additional $500,000 subsidy, raising the company's total subsidy to one million dollars annually. Under the terms of the statute, the new subsidy was contingent upon the company increasing its packet to a monthly service beginning on October 1, 1873 and continuing for a period of ten years. The statute also stipulated that the company must utilize iron ships of at least 4,000 tons for the service, built in the United States and suitable for conversion into naval auxiliaries in the event of war.Swann, pp. 79–80. With the incentive of the new half million dollar subsidy, Pacific Mail decided to upgrade its entire fleet of aging wooden side-wheelers with new iron vessels. The company it chose to build its new fleet was John Roach and Sons, which had recently opened a state-of-the-art shipyard, the Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works, in Chester, Pennsylvania.Swann, pp. 80–81. Pacific Mail ordered a total of nine iron ships from Roach, the first of which were to include the 4,000 ton sister ships City of Peking and City of Tokio. During construction however, rumors abounded that a newly established British company, China Transpacific, was building even larger ships in England for service on the same route. Pacific Mail concluded that it would require larger ships than originally envisaged to successfully compete, and submitted new specifications, which upgraded the two ships from 4,000 to 5,000 tons. The change required a complete redesign of the hull and machinery, and Roach, who had already laid the keels and constructed the frames to meet the original specification, was forced to start from scratch, delaying the ships' completion. ===Financial crisis=== Stock speculator Jay Gould persuaded the U.S. Congress to rescind its Pacific Mail subsidy Roach had initially welcomed the Pacific Mail contracts, anticipating that they would help establish a sound financial foundation for his new company. Unfortunately, in the spring of 1873, eight months into construction of the new ships, Pacific Mail reported an inability to meet its payments. Pacific Mail's President, Alden B. Stockwell, had attempted to manipulate his firm's stock price with company funds, depleting cash reserves and borrowing money to meet the company's obligations. When the stock scheme fell through, Pacific Mail's cash reserves had effectively been substituted with debt. Stockwell and another company director, Richard B. Irwin, then pocketed a loan from Roach and misappropriated about $750,000 in company funds before fleeing the country.Swann, pp. 81–82. But worse was to come. Before his flight, Stockwell had exchanged 20,000 company shares with the notorious stock speculator Jay Gould for the sum of a million dollars. Gould now had influence on the company board, but he had no interest in immediately reviving the company's fortunes. Instead, he hatched a scheme to drive the price of the company's stock down still further, to a point where he and his co-conspirators could purchase the undervalued stock—and thus gain control of the company—at the lowest possible price. In order to realize this aim, Gould needed to somehow persuade shareholders that the company was facing financial ruin.Swann, pp. 82–84. When Pacific Mail proved unable to initiate its new packet service on the date stipulated in the June 1872 statute, Congress was obliged to decide whether or not to cancel the subsidy. Gould seized on this issue to further his scheme of damaging the company's reputation. He organized a lobbying campaign to persuade Congress to rescind the subsidy, while Roach, concerned that without the subsidy Pacific Mail might be unable to meet its debts, lobbied for retaining it. Unknown to Roach, his trusted friend and adviser, the lawyer William E. Chandler who was acting as Roach's main Washington lobbyist, also had Gould as a client, a conflict of interest that encouraged Chandler's reticence. As a result, Roach's lobbying was ineffective at combating Gould's attempt to portray Roach as an unethical raider of the public purse.Swann, pp. 84–91. Gould's campaign was ultimately successful and Congress canceled the subsidy. Owed a million dollars by Pacific Mail, Roach was now in financial difficulty himself as nervous creditors began calling for immediate settlement of their debts. Roach bluffed his way out of the crisis by declaring his readiness to settle any debt within three days of receiving a detailed statement. But he now had to decide whether to foreclose on Pacific Mail in order to secure at least some of his investment in the ships, or to renegotiate the payment plan. He chose the latter, accepting Pacific Mail's old ships for their scrap value as part payment, and reducing its monthly payment obligation from $75,000 to $35,000. Roach was embittered by the affair, but ironically, his handling of the crisis increased his reputation as a businessman able to deal with adverse circumstances.Swann, pp. 91–92. ==Service historyEarly problems=== City of Peking at Pier 42, North River, New York in 1874 City of Peking, the largest ship ever built in the United States at the time, was finally launched in March 1874Bolles, Albert S. (1878): Industrial History of the United States, from the Earliest Settlements to the Present Time, The H. Bill publishing company, digitized by Oxford University 2006, pp 599–600. to great fanfare. Roach himself was honored with a testimonial dinner at which he was toasted—quite inaccurately, and to the chagrin of older, more established shipyards—as \\"the father of iron shipbuilding in America\\".Tyler, p. 36. However, City of Peking's first voyages proved troublesome. For her maiden voyage around Cape Horn to her operating port of San Francisco, she was heavily loaded with railroad iron fore and aft, while her coal was stored amidships. As the coal was consumed on the voyage, the increasingly uneven weight caused the vessel's hull to \\"hog\\" or strain excessively, loosening approximately 5,000 rivets, while some propeller blades were also lost. When she arrived in San Francisco, Roach found himself faced with a stiff $300,000 repair bill. On her next voyage, which was also her first transpacific crossing, the problems recurred, and when she arrived in Hong Kong, Roach suffered the embarrassment of having his celebrated new vessel declared unseaworthy by the British authorities. Roach was forced to dispatch a team of workmen to effect on-the-spot repairs, and he now found himself denigrated in the American press as a builder of inferior ships.Tyler, pp. 36–37 Even with the problems however, City of Peking had still managed to set a new speed record of 22 days on her first San Francisco to Hong Kong crossing. Concerns about the ship's quality ultimately proved groundless. The damage sustained on these two initial voyages was determined to be caused by improper loading of the ship combined with weakness of the wooden decks, which were subsequently replaced with iron. After these repairs and modifications, City of Peking went on to establish an enviable record of reliability, suffering only one complete mechanical breakdown over the course of almost three decades of transpacific service.Tate, p. 29. By 1879, American editorialists were again singing the praises of the great ship, while a period in drydock proved her still capable of attracting thousands of curious sightseers.Tate p. 45. City of Peking would eventually make a total of 116 round trips between San Francisco and Yokohama/Hong Kong in the period from 1875 to 1903.Troops embarking at San Francisco, Library of Congress \\"American Memory\\" website. ===Passengers, cargo and crew=== As a passenger-freighter, City of Peking was designed to carry either passengers or cargo, or both. She was outfitted to accommodate about 1,400 passengers—120 first class, 250 second class and 1,000 steerage.Tyler p. 35. The ship brought many Chinese and Japanese immigrants to the United States, many of whom settled in Hawaii or California. Cost of passage was $150 between San Francisco and Yokohama or $200 between San Francisco and Hong Kong, although the passage for Asian immigrants was frequently subsidized by government or employers.Kuykendall, pp. 165–171. Cargoes exported to Asia by the vessel were mostly foodstuffs, but also included hardware items such as sewing machines, stoves, clocks, trunks, furniture, firearms, leather goods, candles etc. A large range of staple foods were transported, including barley, bran, bread, beans, oats and flour, as well as processed foods such as molasses, olive oil, butter, cheese, yeast powder and whiskey. For her voyage on May 15, 1875, for example, City of Peking carried 23,476 quarter sacks of flour, 2,193 packages of shrimp, plus meal, abalone, bread, codfish, salmon and mineral water in addition to a range of hardware items.Tate p. 245. Cargoes imported typically included items such as silk, tea, sugar, rice, hemp, spices and opium, although again food tended to dominate. To pay for these goods, one of the ship's most valuable exports was \\"treasure\\", which could sometimes be as much as a million dollars or more in coins or bullion. All the ships of Pacific Mail were manned by Chinese crews but commanded by American or European officers. Chinese employees were willing to work for half the wage of Westerners—$15 a month as opposed to $30—and they lacked union protection. However, their employment also meant language difficulties and it was not unusual for officers and crew to be forced to resort to communication by sign language.Tate pp. 240–241. ===Incidents and accidents=== The Chinese and Japanese immigrants brought to the United States on the City of Peking came via the port of San Francisco, where they were obliged to undergo a period of quarantine before entering the country. The quarantine period was served on board aging, unseaworthy hulks in the harbor that were leased by the company, and this arrangement occasionally led to problems. On March 4, 1888, a violent gale blew up after passengers had been transferred from City of Peking to the hulk Alice Garrett, which then broke its moorings with the passengers still on board. Drifting helplessly in high waves, the hulk was swamped and quickly sank. Fortunately, no lives were lost, but the passengers lost all their belongings which went down with the ship.Chambliss, William H. (1895): \\"Chambliss' Diary; Or, Society As It Really Is\\", from \\"California as I Saw It:\\" First-Person Narratives of California's Early Years, 1849–1900., New York, Library of Congress, as recorded at the San Francisco Genealogy website. On an earlier occasion, in January 1880, Chinese immigrants from City of Peking were blamed for an outbreak of smallpox in the city, but a more likely cause was the fraternization of the ship's Caucasian officers—for whom quarantine restrictions were less diligently policed—with the local citizenry.Craddock, Susan (2000): City of Plagues: Disease, Poverty, and Deviance in San Francisco, University of Minnesota Press, p. 74; . Another accident involving City of Peking occurred in Hong Kong on November 29, 1886, when the vessel rammed a French passenger ship, the Saghalien, causing severe damage. Both vessels survived the encounter.Ship Descriptions, page 5 — The Ships List website. City of Peking usually made the voyage from Yokohama to San Francisco in about sixteen days, but on one occasion the vessel took almost twice as long. The ship left the Port of Yokohama on January 10, 1893. After she was almost a week late in arriving, concern increased to the point that the steamship San Juan was dispatched to Honolulu with relief supplies, intending to trace the route of the missing vessel. However, City of Peking finally arrived unassisted, thirteen days late. It transpired that she had broken a propeller shaft and been forced to revert to her auxiliary sails, but since she had been carrying only enough sail for two of her four masts, progress had been unusually slow.Tate p. 42. ===Spanish–American War=== City of Peking leaving San Francisco Bay on 25 May 1898 with troops bound for the Philippines during the Spanish–American War. The First Regiment, California Infantry boarding the City of Peking in San Francisco heading for the Philippines When the Spanish–American War broke out in late April 1898, the U.S. government quickly moved to charter a number of commercial vessels for service as naval auxiliaries. On May 1, 1898, a few days after the declaration of war, City of Peking was chartered by the U.S. government for service as a troop transport, at the rate of $1,500 a day.Tate p. 34. On May 13, the 49 officers and 979 men of the First California Volunteer Regiment boarded the City of Peking, on their way to Manila in the Spanish colony of the Philippines. The historic moment was captured by the Thomas A. Edison Company on one of the earliest surviving film reels. The ship was accompanied on her voyage by the City of Sydney and Australia, which jointly carried five companies of the regular 14th Infantry and 22 officers and 699 men of the 2nd Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment. After a stopover of several days at Honolulu, the small convoy was joined by the protected cruiser , which was to provide the armed escort to Manila. The Captain of Charleston, Henry Glass, had been ordered to take the surrender of Guam, which was achieved peacefully in late May. The convoy then proceeded on to Manila Bay, arriving 30 June. After disembarking the troops, the small convoy waited several weeks before returning to San Francisco via Nagasaki. City of Peking arrived back at San Francisco with ten sailors and some naval officers on 22 August. On September 1, the ship was handed back to Pacific Mail. On her next voyage however, loaded with 3,000 barrels of beer intended for the Philippines' occupation troops, City of Peking suffered a mechanical breakdown off Lime Point, and for the only time was unable to complete a scheduled transpacific crossing. She was towed back to port and the problem eventually diagnosed as a broken piston follower. ===Retirement=== After repairs, City of Peking resumed service on her regular San Francisco-Hong Kong route, which continued for another five years. On 21 September 1903, the aging vessel was finally retired from transpacific service by Pacific Mail.Tate p. 35. The ship was eventually scrapped in 1920. ==FootnotesReferences== * Swann, Leonard Alexander Jr. (1965): John Roach, Maritime Entrepreneur: the Years as Naval Contractor 1862–1886, United States Naval Institute (reprinted 1980 by Ayer Publishing, ). * Tate, E.

After her divorce in 1969, she became involved with the survivors of Che Guevara's routed guerrilla movement, the National Liberation Army of Bolivia (ELN). After helping out in minor occasions she finally joined the political underground. She began a relationship with the ELN leader , the successor of Che Guevara. Peredo was killed by the secret service of Bolivia on 9 September 1969. In Germany, she became known as \\"Che Guevara's avenger\\" because of her involvement in the 1971 murder of Colonel Roberto Quintanilla Pereira in Hamburg, Germany: although this has never been completely proven it can safely be assumed that she did shoot Quintanilla who, at the time, was serving in Hamburg as the Bolivian consul. A message found at the murder scene had written the words Victory or Death a slogan by the ELN. A former leader of the 'National Liberation Army' (ELN) of Bolivia, Osvaldo \\"Chato\\" Peredo, confirmed, in an interview filmed by German director Christian Baudissin in 1988, that Quintanilla was a prime target of the ELN, because he had been responsible for ordering the hands of Guevara's corpse be cut off and sent to La Paz for further identification. He also states that Ertl \\"after carrying out the mission in Hamburg\\" returned to Cuba where she met with Régis Debray. After being under covert observation in Bolivia for several days she and another guerrilla were eventually ambushed and killed by Bolivian security forces on 12 May 1973 in El Alto (in La Paz), where she was reorganizing the ELN. According to Régis Debray she was also preparing the abduction of the former Gestapo Chief of Lyon Klaus Barbie to bring him to Chile and consequently to justice in France where he was wanted as a Nazi war criminal. At the time Barbie was known to be an adviser of the secret police in Bolivia. Her body was not turned over to her family to be buried and she rests in an unknown grave. ==Popular culture== * Ertl is among the prominent characters in a fictionalized account of her family, Los Afectos (Affections) by Bolivian author Rodrigo Hasbún. * A documentary film was made called 'Wanted: Monika Ertl' about her life.

City of Tokio and her sister ship City of Peking were at the time of construction the largest vessels ever built in the United States, and the second largest in the world behind the British leviathan . Like Great Eastern, construction of the two Pacific Mail ships was to be plagued with financial difficulties, which threatened to bankrupt the shipbuilder. Unlike Great Eastern, however, which was a commercial failure, City of Tokio was to enjoy a successful commercial career until being wrecked at the entrance of Tokyo Bay in 1885. City of Tokio holds the distinction of being the first ship to bring members of the Issei, or first-generation Japanese migrants, to the United States. ==Construction== City of Tokio and City of Peking were ordered by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company in order to take advantage of a new $500,000 congressional subsidy for the company's steam packet service to the Far East. After contracting with the shipyard of John Roach and Sons for construction, Pacific Mail ran into financial difficulties after two company directors squandered the company's cash reserves in a stock speculation scheme and then fled the country with the balance.Swann pp. 79-82. Pacific Mail's woes were exacerbated after the stock speculator Jay Gould, in a clandestine attempt to acquire the company's stock cheaply, persuaded the U.S. Congress to rescind its $500,000 annual subsidy. Pacific Mail's inability to meet its financial obligations threatened in turn the survival of the shipbuilder John Roach and Sons, which had already invested more than a million dollars in constructing the two ships, but Roach was able to hold off his own creditors. Roach eventually renegotiated the Pacific Mail contract, reducing the latter's monthly obligations from $75,000 to $35,000, and the two vessels were launched in 1874.Swann pp. 82-92. ==Service historyMaiden voyage=== On her maiden voyage in February 1875, City of Tokio's sister ship City of Peking lost propeller blades, and also required the replacement of 5,000 rivets, amounting to a total repair bill of $300,000. When City of Tokio made her own maiden voyage in April of the same year, she too suffered the loss of propeller blades.Tyler pp. 36-37 The problems were eventually diagnosed as improper loading of the ships combined with weak wooden decks. The wooden decks on both vessels were subsequently replaced by iron, after which both established an enviable record of reliability. ===Route, cargo and passengers=== Like her sister ship City of Peking, City of Tokio was utilized exclusively on the Far Eastern steam packet service, operating from the Port of San Francisco to Yokohama, Japan and Hong Kong. Both vessels transported Chinese, and later Japanese, migrants to the United States, as well as exporting foodstuffs and manufactured goods and importing a range of goods including silk, tea, hemp, spices and opium.Tate p. 245. President Grant's world tour In 1877, United States President Ulysses S. Grant embarked on a highly successful world tour, during which he was greeted at every port of call as the hero of the recently concluded Civil War. Grant departed the United States on the first leg of his tour on May 17, 1877, on the American Line's Pennsylvania-class steamship Indiana. He returned home almost two and a half years later on board City of Tokio, arriving at San Francisco on September 20, 1879. A contemporary account described the arrival thus: > A fleet of steamers and yachts met the City of Tokio down the bay, while > guns boomed until the harbor was cloudy with smoke, bells rang, and factory > whistles tooted and screamed. Every vantage point overlooking the channel > was black with cheering crowds. It was dusk when the General landed. A great > procession was awaiting him, and escorted him, through streets draped with > bunting and bright with thousands of lights and bonfires, to the Palace > Hotel, where a chorus of five hundred voices sang an ode of greeting.Coombs, > Francis Lovell (1919): U. S. Grant, The Macmillan company, p. 236. Cheered by crowds at every station, Grant eventually reached Philadelphia, his original point of departure two and half years earlier, on December 12, 1879. Japanese migrants After the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed in 1882,Tate p. 229. American industrialists began to look elsewhere for reliable sources of cheap labor. The Japanese government had forbidden emigration since 1868, but in the 1880s it relaxed some of its restrictions.Tate p. 231. In 1884, the government of Hawaii offered to subsidize the transport of Japanese labourers to its territory, and advertised a set of conditions under which the migrants would be employed on its sugar plantations.Kuykendall p. 164-165. On February 8, 1885, the first group of 943 Japanese – 676 men, 159 women, and 108 children – arrived in Honolulu, on board City of Tokio. This group was the very first in the wave of immigration whose members would later be dubbed Issei, or first-generation Japanese migrants to the United States.Kuykendall p. 165.Coach, Marlene E. (2004): America's Quiet Unknown Heroes, University Press of America, p. 3. ===Shipwreck=== City of Tokio's service was to end prematurely. In the early hours of 24 June 1885, in conditions of poor visibility, City of Tokio was grounded on rocks at the entrance to Tokyo Bay. At first it seemed as if the ship could be refloated, but the onset of a typhoon rendered salvage impossible, and the storm damaged the ship beyond repair. Fortunately, all of the passengers and some of the cargo were safely removed before the vessel foundered.Tate p. 32. ==FootnotesRecurring references== *Kuykendall, Ralph S.

As all the passes were guarded the young man let down a rope of twisted creepers over the escarpment, as she was hauled up she was dashed against the rocks and died.

The Battalion also provides law and order to all installations within United States Army Garrison Hawaii. The 728th Military Police has four Companies, and two Detachments, the 39th MP Detachment and the 13th MP Detachment. The 728th Headquarters is located at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. The Battalion works in support of Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment (HHD) and the Soldiers assigned to it. ==History== This 1971 picture shows the entrance to Company C, 728 MP Bn at Camp Tracy in Korea ===World War II=== The 728th was activated 19 January 1942, at Fort Custer, Michigan. The primary mission of the 728th was at first the training of men for combat and maintaining alert status for the protection of war production industry in Detroit, Michigan. During the Detroit race riot of 1943 the 728th helped maintain security in Detroit. On 28 October 1946, after the cessation of World War II hostilities, the 728th was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its valiant performance of duty during the period 1942 through 1945. ===Cold War === From 1946 until 1950, the 728th remained stateside where its mission was focused on maintaining domestic security in various areas in the United States. Soon thereafter the battalion was transferred to Yokohama, Japan. When North Korea invaded South Korea and the United States began their intervention the 728th was reassembled in Pusan, South Korea. Their new mission was operation and maintaining traffic on the Green Diamond Main Supply Route (MSR). During the next eight months, many soldiers of the unit took active part in combat to suppress guerrilla activities and respond to ever changing battles. At some point after the \\"MacArthur Invasion\\" the Battalion Headquarters was transferred to Incheon, South Korea. As security conditions in the Korean theater improved the battalion headquarters was again transferred, this time to Seoul. In 1951 the Battalion began assisting in traffic control and other civil law enforcement duties. The unit was a major participant in the Korean War until the signing of the Armistice Agreement in 1953. Since the end of Korean War the mission of the 728th has been to provide Military Police support to the American troops around the Republic of Korea and to maintain order in the assigned area. The 728th Military Police Battalion missions have included providing security for the return of hostages of the USS Pueblo and maintaining security in support of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/728mp.htm ===Activities in Iraq=== On 21 October 2004, two platoons of the 728th MP Battalion (approximately 70 personnel) deployed to Iraq in support of the United States mission in the Iraqi War. The 57th Military Police Company at Camp Carroll in Waegwan, and the 552nd Military Police Company at Camp Hialeah in Pusan, each supplied 35 troops for this deployment. Prior to their departure, the troops received two weeks of Iraq-specific combat training which included how to deal with roadside bombs and other improvised explosive devices; and information on the culture and peoples of Iraq. \\"This redeployment does not represent the start of a trend of sending soldiers from the peninsula [of South Korea] to Southwest Asia\\", Maj. Kate Johnson, an 8th U.S. Army spokeswoman in Seoul, stated. \\"Our mission is the deterrence on the peninsula, and remains deterrence on the peninsula\\".

Much of the Port's operations have now moved further downstream. This is a list of about 680 former or extant wharves, docks, piers, terminals, etc. of the Port of London, the majority of which lie on the Tideway of the River Thames, listed from upstream to downstream. Many of the docks closed after the mass uptake of containerisation changed the face of the industry and bringing about an end to an era, and a demise to the occupation of the docker as it then was. Those marked with a † have at present the status of a safeguarded wharf. Those in italics are no longer used for port or river transit related activities. Further remarks are made in brackets, including in some cases the present operator or cargo handled. It is estimated that in 1937, at the height of London's trade, there were around 1,700 wharves between Brentford and Gravesend. Today there are around 70 active terminals, each generally handling much greater volumes. Much of the cargo and commodities handling by the Port of London takes place in the downstream stretches of the Thames beyond Greater London, on the banks of south Essex (Thurrock) and north Kent. The Port of London Authority controls operations from its base in Gravesend. The main container terminal is currently at Tilbury, though in 2008 construction began on the London Gateway project, which will become the largest single component of the Port of London when completed.

He was born in Torrijos Toledo, Spain in 1518. He was married to Catalina Flores de Riofrío before he came to the Americas in 1535. He first disembarked in Cartagena de Indias in Colombia but soon moved on and fought for twelve years in Honduras and the Yucatán Peninsula with Pedro de Alvarado and Francisco de Montejo and was one of the first Alcaldes of the new city of Mérida. Leaving Mérida he went to fight in Peru for two years until he met Francisco de Villagra who was recruiting more men for Pedro de Valdivias campaign in Araucanía. In 1551 he came to Chile with Francisco de Villagra. An experienced soldier he soon became Corregidor of the city of Angol in 1554 after the death of Valdivia. Francisco de Villagra then appointed him as Maestro de Campo for his army in 1554. After fighting in the Battle of Marihueñu, he survived the defeat and evacuation of Concepcion. Returning to Santiago, he supported Villagra against the attempt of Francisco de Aguirre to become governor of Chile. Under the new governor García Hurtado de Mendoza Reinoso was made a Captain of Cavalry and fought in the Battle of Lagunillas and Battle of Millarapue. Moving into the Tucapel region he broke up an assembly of Mapuche in Cayucupil with a night march and morning surprise attack. Soon afterward near the valley of Purén, Reinoso rescued a column under Pedro de Avendaño from a Mapuche ambush. Mendoza appointed him as the Corregidor of his new town of Cañete de la Frontera when he began his expedition to the south. Attempting to throw off the Spanish occupation Caupolicán attacked the fort of Cañete expecting the gates to be opened by the treachery of a yanakuna within but he was betrayed instead. Reinoso took advantage of the opportunity to lure the toqui Caupolican into a trap in the city and destroyed his army. Later Reinoso found an Indian who led his subordinate Pedro de Avendaño into the mountains during the night and on February 5, 1558, captured Caupolican. Returned to Cañete Reinoso saw to the Toqui's execution by impalement. This measure did not stop the Mapuche revolt and they fortified Quiapo. Mendoza returned and with Reinoso captured the fort and destroyed the army defending it in the Battle of Quiapo. Afterward, Reinoso carried out the punishment of the prisoners taken in the battle, seven hundred were hanged without mercy on the battlefield. In the middle of January 1559, Alonso de Reinoso was elevated to the rank of Maestro de Campo by Mendoza who left him in charge of all the troops south of the Bio Bio River. From 1559 he lived in the city of Concepcion where he was named as its Cabildos Alcalde Ordinario and its Corregidor. He continued as the Maestro de Campo for Mendoza's successor the new governor Francisco de Villagra. He died, drowned in a shipwreck near the city of Concepción in 1567, escorting the new oidores of the new Real Audiencia of Chile to the city. == Sources == * José Toribio Medina, Colección de documentos inéditos para la historia de Chile desde el viaje de Magallanes hasta la batalla de Maipo, 1518-1818, Tomo VII, Imprenta Ercilla, Santiago, 1895 ** 6 de Octubre de 1542 XXI. — Información de los servicios que hizo en la conquista de Higueras y Honduras Alonso de Reinoso, en compañía del adelantado D.

He led an embassy to France in 1863, and committed suicide when France completed the invasion of Southern Vietnam (Cochinchina) in 1867. Phan Thanh Giản's grandfather was a Minh Hương (Ming dynasty refugees, with ancestry from Haicheng. Southern Fujian Province in China), while his grandmother was a Vietnamese woman. == Life  Treaty of Saigon === Phan Thanh Giản was one of the foremost mandarins of the Nguyễn court. He played a key role in negotiating the Treaty of Saigon with the French in 1862.Vietnam by Jan Dodd, Mark Lewis, Ron Emmons, p.151 The negotiations led to the formal cession of Vietnamese territory that the French Expeditionary Corps had occupied in 1861 (the first parts of the future colony of Cochinchina): the provinces of Già Dinh, Mỹ Tho, Biên Hòa, and the Poulo Condore islands were ceded, and war reparations paid to the French.Chapuis, p.49: \\"Phan Thanh Giản agreed to cede Già Dinh, My Tho, Bien Hoa, and the Poulo Condore Island, and to pay for war reparations of 400000 silver dollars over 10 years\\" Because of his role in these negotiations, Phan Thanh Giản became rather unpopular, both with the Vietnamese population, and with the court of king Tự Đức. ===Embassy to France (1863)=== In 1863, Phan Thanh Giản was sent by the emperor on an embassy to France to visit Napoleon III, in order to negotiate the return of the territories given to the French. Phan Thanh Giản was accompanied by Michel Duc Chaigneau (the son of Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau) on this embassy.Tran and Reid, p.207 Phan Thanh Giản with a 70-strong embassy met with Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie in November 1863. Napoleon III, moved by Phan Thanh Giản's plea, accepted to return the provinces in exchange for a war indemnity, an agreement to station troops in Saigon, My Thau and Thủ Dầu Một, and recognition of French military protection. The French Navy Minister Chasseloup-Laubat however, opposed to the return of Cochinchinese territory, threatened Napoleon III with his resignation and that of the whole cabinet, forcing him to order the cancellation of the agreement in June 1864Chapuis, pp.50-51 Through his visit to France, Phan Thanh Giản obtained a first hand understanding of the level of advancement of France compared to Vietnam, was astonished at examples of technological innovation such as steam trains, and stated on his return to Vietnam that France's \\"wealth and strength are beyond description\\". Tự Đức only responded to this warning with admonitions of moral rectitude: === Governorship === Upon his return, Tự Đức nominated Phan Thanh Giản governor of the remaining southern provinces. When France invaded the rest of the southern territories in 1867, Phan Thanh Giản chose to avoid armed resistance and failed to defend the citadel of Vĩnh Long,The Twenty-five Year Century by Quang Thi Lâm, p.11 waiting for orders that never came, resigned from his position and took his own life through poisoning.Jamieson, p.46 ==Family== Phan's family was of Sino-Vietnamese descent. His grandfather, Phan Thanh Tap was a native of Haicheng (near modern-day Longhai, Fujian) in Zhangzhou prefecture of Fujian province before later ultimately migrating to Vietnam due to political sentiments against the ruling Qing government. Phan Thanh Tap migrated to Vietnam in the early 18th century, along with his family and relatives and settled in the village of Hoi Trung at Bình Định Province. Upon settling in Vietnam, he married a Vietnamese woman, Huynh Thi Ngoc, with whom his Phan's father, Thanh Ngan was born from this union. Phan Thanh Ngan began his career as a clerk to the Nguyễn court. In 1798, Phan Thanh Ngan was appointed as the chief supplier for Phuc Anh's (Emperor Gia Long from 1802) navy and was sent on a diplomatic mission to Tourane, but was later shipwrecked at lost at sea.Nguyẽn (1964), p. 227 Phan's mother was also of Chinese descent; her great-great grandfather migrated to Vietnam from Fujian province during mid 17th century.Choi (2004), p. 106 He had three sons, Phan Thanh Liêm, Phan Thanh Tong and Phan Thanh Hương, of which the first two organised an armed rebellion against the French soldiers who had colonised Vĩnh Long and were later captured and killed.Nguyẽn (1964), p. 240 ==In popular culture== Nowadays, Phan Thanh Giản is being venerated as a minor god among his family members and a few in southern Vietnam. ==Images== File:Ptgian.jpgPhan Thanh Giản File:Đình thần Phan Thanh Giản.jpgTemple of Phan Thanh Giản File:Phan Thanh Gian 2.PNGPhan Thanh Giản in Paris, France 1863. == See also == * France–Vietnam relations == Notes  References == * * Choi, Byung Wook, Southern Vietnam Under the Reign of Minh Mạng (1820–1841): Central Policies and Local Response, SEAP Publications, 2004, * * Nguyẽn, Phút Tán, A Modern History of Viet-nam (1802–1954), Nhà sách Khai-Trí, 1964 * Category:1796 births Category:1867 deaths Category:Suicides in Vietnam Category:People of the Cochinchina Campaign Category:Nguyen dynasty officials Category:Vietnamese Confucianists Category:Minh Hương ","title":"Phan Thanh Giản"},{"id":"19246565","text":"Sharron McClellan (born December 19, 1963) is a Spanish-born American fiction writer.

Rather than merely showing women's bodies, Bernhard overlaid elements of the earth through projections and worked with myths of metamorphosis as a subtext for his model photography. The resulting images include allusions to the material by which the models are absorbed or into which they disappear. == Work == Bernhard's work was included in the 120 year survey of the nude exhibition \\"Body Work\\" at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, alongside the work of Edward Weston, Bill Brandt, Eadweard Muybridge, E. J. Bellocq, and Edward Steichen. Bernhard later continued to devote all his energy taking photographs and bringing them together to enhance their meaning with visual interplay. This is evident in his \\"Diptychs\\" and sequencing series \\"Drift\\". His first non-fiction book, America's Call, an engaging road trip memoir, was published in 2011 by Dog Ear Publishing. The French version L'Appel de L'Amérique, illustrated with 57 color photographs and collages, was published in 2013 by Infolio Edition, Switzerland. America's Call is based on the journal that John Bernhard kept, chronicling his trip to North America during the late 1970s. The theme resonates with the book On the Road by Jack Kerouac, and makes you yearn for traveling across a nostalgic time. Houston Chronicle journalist K. Pica Kahn wrote: \\"Bernhard's way of storytelling takes the audience on the ride of a lifetime with a mélange of experiences like a colorful ribbon in the sky.\\" He was profiled in the documentary show \\"Temps Present\\" on Swiss Television TSR (Switzerland) and the global network TV5 Monde.

In addition, extra points can be scored when players bring their falling blocks down to the downbeats (called \\"Superbeats\\") of the game's electronica soundtrack, adding to a score multiplier. By setting high scores, players collect stars to unlock new songs and power-ups. Unlike most puzzle games which are played to infinity, each stage in Groovin' Blocks lasts for the duration of the song if the player has not yet failed the stage by filling their play area with blocks. The game also features offline two player competitive and co-operative modes, as well as an option for colorblind players that turns the different colored blocks into shapes. ==Reception== Groovin' Blocks received mixed to positive reviews from critics upon release, with the Wii version getting more positive reviews compared to the PlayStation 3 version.

Unlike many other members of the Lasiocampidae, the small eggar is a social insect. Historically, only eusocial insects like ants, bees, and termites were thought to exhibit complex social organization and communication systems. However, research since the late 20th century has found that E. lanestris, among a number of other phylogenetically related moth and butterfly species, demonstrates social behaviors as well. Larvae spend nearly their entire development in colonies of about 200 individuals, and this grouped social structure offers a number of benefits, from thermoregulation to increased foraging success. The small eggar population has been in decline since the 1970s. Landscaping practices like hedgerow cutting and intensive mowing destroy habitats and damage cocoons during pupation, leading to scattered populations and increased rarity. == Description == Small eggar moths have a wingspan of 30–40 millimeters, and females are generally larger than males. Male and female adults have a gray-brown to reddish coloration with white spotting on their upper wings, however males tend to have darker, grayer coloration than females. Additionally, males antennae are bipectinate, or feather-like. Both sexes have setae on their bodies, but females have an extra grayish tuft of hair at the base of their abdominal region. Larvae are black and hairy, developing red coloration during the later larval stages. They can reach lengths of approximately 50 mm and often have yellow coloration along the sides of their bodies throughout development.

Due to its preference for warm, dry weather, the small eggar has a more limited range, as it cannot function properly in the cold conditions found in the northern palearctic. The moth is only active from spring to mid-summer in the temperate region of the U.K. and Ireland. == Habitat == Larval colonies, egg masses, and cocoons are all found on small trees, bushes, and hedgerows. Host plants of the small eggar include blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), hawthorn (Cretaegus), and birch (Betula pendula). E. lanestris prefers these plants due to their branching and twigging structure suitable for oviposition and larval tent construction (see below), along with the food resources they offer. These species are commonly planted in hedge formations along roads, or around residential or agricultural land. Prunus spinosa (blackthorn) == Food resources == The small eggar only feeds during its larval stages of development, consuming leaves of blackthorn, hawthorn, and birch. Due to their high water and nitrogen content, young leaves, rather than more mature ones, are preferred by caterpillars. Caterpillars hatch around the time of leaf emergence in order to maximize feeding while leaves are still young and nutritious. The small eggar is a central-place forager, meaning it returns to the same nesting site after each foraging trip. This allows colonies of larval E. lanestris to communicate where the best feeding sites are located. However, as colonies develop, the closest food resources become too mature or are depleted, so caterpillars must venture further and further from their central site to feed. == Social behavior == E. lanestris is a highly social insect, particularly during its larval stages. Hence, small eggar larvae are categorized as gregarious caterpillars. Living in large groups may make larval colonies more apparent to visually-oriented predators, however this social structure has also allowed the small eggar to evolve a number of advantageous behaviors. === Synchronous foraging === One benefit of the grouping behavior found in E. lanestris is increased foraging efficiency, which they achieve by foraging together in a large group. Colonies of caterpillars feed several times a day, leaving their tent as a group in search of food. The exact mechanism by which larvae determine feeding times is unknown, but it likely has to do with the ability of the silk tent to transmit vibrations throughout the structure. As caterpillars mobilize to leave the tent, others are alerted by the vibrations that it is time to feed, facilitating the movement of the entire colony, allowing for synchronous foraging. Unlike many nocturnal foragers, E. lanestris feeds both during the day and at night, so it runs the risk of detection by visually-oriented predators during daytime foraging forays. However, by leaving the security of the tent en masse instead of solitarily, caterpillars are able to minimize their individual risk of predation and cooperate to locate and reach the best feeding sites. === Trail-based communication === E. lanestris' central-place foraging strategy in which they leave and return to the same site during each foraging outing, allows caterpillars to communicate about the best nearby food sources, turning their nest into an information center. Caterpillars lay down a silk trail when they move outside of the tent, creating a network of trails that lead back to their home base. Larvae can differentiate between new and old trails, preferring newer trails that lead to higher-yielding feeding sites. During a synchronous foraging bout, larvae that are unsuccessful at first return to the tent and pick up fresh trails that were marked by a successful feeder. In addition to indicating the best feeding sites, silk trails allow caterpillars to better grip the substrate over which they are traveling, which further increases foraging efficiency and success. === Thermoregulation === A mass of early instar larvae Another advantage provided by the small eggar's sociality is their enhanced ability to control the temperature of their immediate surroundings, or thermoregulate. E. lanestris is an ectothermic organism, meaning it relies on its surroundings to regulate its body temperature. Caterpillars must maintain an adequate body temperature in order to move, metabolize, and develop properly. Caterpillars have an optimal temperature range of 30–35 °C, and when they hatch in early spring, ambient temperatures are usually below this threshold. Small individual caterpillars have a low capacity to capture and retain heat, however when 200 individuals group together, their effective mass increases significantly, allowing them to collectively retain more heat. The layered tent structure functions to further insulate caterpillars within the inner chambers. On sunny days when air temperatures may be lower than ideal, caterpillars congregate on the outer surfaces of the tent in direct sunlight. Their black, furry bodies act to absorb radiation and their grouping serves to more effectively prevent heat loss. Additionally, when caterpillars return to the tent after feeding, they enter into a resting and digestion phase. Their metabolisms generate heat energy, which can raise the internal tent temperature as much as 3 °C. As caterpillars enter later larval stages, seasonal temperatures may get too high, so caterpillars are often found on the shaded side of their tent, away from direct sun. == Life history  Eggs === Female moths lay masses of about 325 eggs on twigs and small branches of the host plant. Each batch of eggs covers approximately 4 cm of area. The eggs all hatch within the span of a few days, save for a relatively small proportion of the egg mass, yielding a larval colony averaging 200 individuals. === Larval development === Larvae mature through five stages, called instars, over the course of six to seven weeks. During early larval development (instars 1–3), larvae are small and black in coloration, and during late development (instars 4–5), larvae develop urticarial hairs and red coloration. In their fifth instar, larvae lose many of their social behaviors and colonies disband as individuals prepare for pupation. Silk tent of E. lanestris  Larval tents  E. lanestris eggs hatch in April and May, and following their emergence, caterpillars immediately construct tents out of silk at their hatching site, or nearby on the same bush. They live in these tents as colonies of approximately 200 of their full siblings during their development. They continually repair and expand the same structure throughout larval development. The tent consists of layers of silk fibers that form air pockets which serve to insulate the nest and provide resting spaces for caterpillars inside. Tent structures are severely damaged by heavy rains, which cause their silk layers to stick together, removing air pockets. Dried silk also becomes brittle and fragile, making it susceptible to breaking and tearing. Additionally, small eggars’ tents are bright white and not well-concealed, so they are easily located and damaged by predators like birds. Maintaining the integrity of the tent is essential to larval colonies’ survival, and they do not abandon the tent until just before pupation. === Pupation === Pupation occurs in early July. Caterpillars form hard, brown, rounded cocoons, which are usually found concealed in low, dense vegetation of hedgerows and bushes, as well is in grass and brush. Pupa overwinter in their cocoons and typically hatch the following spring, however they have been known to remain in pupation for several years when conditions are less than ideal. === Adulthood and reproduction === Adult moths emerge from their cocoons in March and early April. Adults live for about a week, during which they mate. E. lanestris moths do not feed as adults, so they must rely on their larval nutrition for survival and reproduction during their final life stage. When females deposit eggs on the branches of their host plants, they secrete a protective cover of fluids and anal tuft hairs that hardens into a solid shell. Little is known about the mating behavior of the small eggar moths, however mating behaviors of closely related moths, like the tent moths of the genus Malacosoma, have been studied. In these other tent moths, and likely in E. lanestris as well, males reach sexual maturity faster than females. Moths copulate by joining ends and facing in opposite directions. == Enemies == E. lanestris is preyed on by different organisms throughout its development. During early larval stages, caterpillars are primarily attacked by spiders, ants, beetles, and other insects. As they grow in size, they are more appealing to larger vertebrates. Birds prey on adult moths and have also been known to attack the tents in which larval colonies live and develop, which causes severe structural damage. Field studies have revealed low rates of parasitism among small eggars. === Predator defense === 5th instar setae and red coloration As larvae, E. lanestris exhibits a number of characteristics in their behavior, as well as their anatomy, that provide them protection from predators. These predator defense mechanisms include larvae's synchronous foraging behavior, which decreases individual risk of predation when they leave the safety of their tent. By traveling in large groups, individual caterpillars become more difficult to be singled out by predators. Additionally, the development of red coloring and setae containing a chemical irritant during later instars allows for additional protection from predation. Red coloration serves as a warning sign to birds and other visual predators, and rash-inducing setae function to deter predators upon contact. == Interactions with humans  Dermatitis === The small eggar is covered in setae, which can cause dermatitis in humans upon contact. These tiny hairs have a tube-like structure that becomes embedded in exposed skin, delivering a chemical irritant. Reactions vary in severity, but typically present as an itchy rash that spreads from the area of contact and can develop red bumps and papules. The rash usually clears up after about a week. Cases of small eggar-related dermatitis have resulted from direct handling of caterpillars as well as indirect exposure to setae. Adult moths have fewer setae on their bodies and therefore pose less of a risk of dermatological reaction to humans. === Crop pests === E. lanestris is often found on fruit trees including apple, pear, damson, and plum trees. Infestation of these crop trees does not generally result in damage to the fruits they produce, however, larvae can cause considerable damage to the trees' leaves, resulting in significant defoliation. In general, E. lanestris occupies these trees less than its other host plants, and it is not considered a pest of high importance. === Conservation === Since the 1970s, the small eggar population has been declining in its native habitat in Britain, Wales, and Ireland. Once abundant, the population now exists in scattered colonies across its range. In Britain, the small eggar is considered nationally scarce. The moth's decreased abundance is attributed mainly to hedgerow trimming and intensive roadside mowing that directly harm the insect or destroy its host plants. == Reference list == Category:Lasiocampidae Category:Moths described in 1758 Category:Moths of Europe Category:Moths of Turkey Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Eriogaster lanestris"},{"id":"19246779","text":"patriot camp before burning August 18, 2008: The camp is burning Ganarjiis Mukhuri (; Also known as contracted form: ganmukhuri) is a village in the Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti region of western Georgia.

Rediff.com thought that Chakravarthy fared better as an actor than as a director. While continuing in its discussion, it specifically commends Jagapathi Babu and Mahesh Manjrekar for their performances. The female actors, Mamta Mohandas and debutant Madhurima were added to the glamor quotient. Another such review equally praised Babu and Chakravarthy for their histrionics. While discussing the technical aspects of the film, the reviewer thought that Chakravarthy \\"scripted the screenplay with perfection and did not lose grip on the story at any point of time.\\" From certain scenes and filming methodology, another review thought that Chakravarthy's direction was influence by his mentor Ram Gopal Varma. While the music was termed as tasteless, cinematography and editing were acceptable by the reviewer. Overall, the film was rated as hit and the review suggested that its plot was inspired by the 2002 Hong Kong crime thriller Infernal Affairs (which this movie was remade as 2006 Hollywood movie, The Departed, directed by Martin Scorsese). Director Chakravarthy corroborated this fact in an interview where he said that the movie The Departed (remade based on the original Infernal Affairs) was inspiration to some extent, but his film varied a lot in its narration and treatment. == References  * Category:2008 films Category:Indian crime thriller films Category:Telugu-language films Category:Indian films Category:2000s crime thriller films Category:Films about organised crime in India Category:Films featuring an item number Category:Indian gangster films Category:Indian remakes of Hong Kong films ","title":"Homam (film)"},{"id":"19246787","text":"The Faroe Islands competed at the 1984 Summer Paralympics co-hosted by Stoke Mandeville, United Kingdom and New York City, United States.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 30, 2008. In the episode, Homer becomes suspicious of Bart's new Muslim friend, Bashir, and decides to invite his family for dinner. When Homer offends them, he goes to their home to apologize but discovers what he believes to be a terrorist plot to blow up the Springfield Mall. In the episode's subplot, Lisa gets a MyPod (a parody of iPod) and racks up a large bill. The episode was written by Marc Wilmore and directed by Steven Dean Moore with Shohreh Aghdashloo of 24 guest-starring as Bashir's mother, Mina. It is the first episode of The Simpsons to have Islam portrayed in a large role. It was the most watched show on Fox on its original airing, and received fairly positive reviews from television critics. The episode's theme was praised by the Council on American–Islamic Relations and the Muslim Public Affairs Council, and Aghdashloo was given an award by the latter organization for her role. == Plot == At the Mapple Store, Bart interrupts a video message from company founder Steve Mobbs and insults the company's user base. Fleeing from the Mapple customers, he runs into a Muslim boy from Jordan named Bashir and befriends him. Homer is impressed by Bashir's manners, but Lenny, Carl and Moe convince him that all Muslims are terrorists. He invites Bashir's family over to dinner in an attempt to expose them, but openly offends them, causing them to leave. Later that evening, while going to their home to apologize, Homer catches a glimpse of Bashir's father working with TNT in his garage. He goes home and has a nightmare featuring the Genie of Aladdin, who transforms the \\"decadent, Western society\\" into a stereotypical Islamic republic. Shaken by the dream, Homer eavesdrops on Bashir's father speaking about his work in building demolition, but misinterprets it and believes he is a suicide bomber. As soon as Bashir's father departs for work, Homer convinces the mother to invite him so he can apologize. He hacks into the family's laptop and discovers a diagram of demolition plans for the Springfield Mall. Homer rushes to the mall to warn the shoppers and sees Bart standing near a detonator with Bashir and his father; he attempts to save the day by throwing the dynamite in the river. It actually turns out that the old mall was slated for destruction. Realizing his mistake, Homer apologizes, and the Simpson family throws a \\"Pardon My Intolerance\\" party for Bashir's family. In a subplot, Lisa obtains a MyPod from Krusty the Clown at the Mapple Store. She becomes obsessed with the device and racks up a US$1,200 bill. She goes to Mapple's undersea headquarters and begs Steve Mobbs to consider a reduced payment plan. Mobbs offers Lisa a job at Mapple to help with her bill. Much to her chagrin, the job is standing on a street corner dressed as a MyPod, handing out Mapple pamphlets and telling people to \\"Think Differently\\". == Cultural references == The episode features parodies of Apple Inc., its products, and its then CEO Steve Jobs The episode features numerous parodies of Apple Inc. and its products. Apple is portrayed as Mapple, with the MyPod, MyPhone, MyTunes, MyCube, Mapple Store and Brainiac Bar referring respectively to the iPod, iPhone, iTunes, Power Mac G4 Cube, Apple Store and Genius Bar. Later episodes of the show also feature a MyPad, a reference to the iPad. The CEO of Mapple is Steve Mobbs, a parody of Apple Inc.'s then-CEO Steve Jobs. The scene where Comic Book Guy throws a sledgehammer at the computer screen is a reference to the \\"1984\\" Apple commercial. The episode also features numerous references to films and pop culture. The scene where Homer is on a flying carpet is a parody of the film Aladdin; the Genie also makes an appearance. The Simpsons regular cast member Dan Castellaneta does the voice of the Genie in this episode. He had previously voiced the Genie in the Aladdin television series, The Return of Jafar, and the Kingdom Hearts video game series. Steve Mobbs operating a series of holographic screens with his hands is a reference to the 2002 film Minority Report. The music in the episode features Minnie Riperton's song \\"Lovin' You\\" and Miles Davis' \\"Moon Dreams\\", while the episode's Itchy & Scratchy cartoon features Ludwig van Beethoven's \\"Symphony No. 5\\" and the Alicia Bridges song \\"I Love the Nightlife\\". The title itself is a pun on the 1971 Disney musical fantasy film Bedknobs and Broomsticks, directed by Robert Stevenson. == Reception == \\"MyPods and Boomsticks\\" was the most viewed show on Fox the night it was first broadcast, with roughly 7.8 million viewers and a 4.4 Neilsen rating. === Television critics === The episode was generally praised by critics. Robert Canning of IGN praised the episode; as a whole, he called the episode funny and strong and \\"gave the now familiar 'suspected terrorist' plot a Simpsons twist\\", but called the remainder of the Mapple storyline less impressive. Canning ends his review by saying that minus Lisa's involvement after act one, it was a decently funny episode of The Simpsons. He gave the episode a rating of 7.6/10. Critics praised the episode for its jokes, but claimed that the episode should have been released earlier in the decade, especially when the September 11 attacks and introduction of Apple products were more relevant. Writing for The A.V. Club, Steve Heisler gave the episode a C-. He was perplexed why all names relating to the Apple company were slightly changed, but references to other brands such as Old Navy were not. Daniel Aughey of TV Guide also praised the episode for its consistent story and funny jokes. Aughey explained certain jokes in the episode that he enjoyed and explained how the \\"A-Z\\" plots play well with the jokes. Both Heisler and Aughey commented that the episode should have been done earlier, Heisler thinking the theme was dated and Aughey calling it \\"one step behind\\", both feeling the Islamophobia theme would have been more current closer to the beginning of the 21st century. In addition, the episode was featured on Entertainment Weeklys Five Best TV quotes of the week with Bart's line of \\"Wow, all these years I've been patting lambs when I should have been shoving them in my mouth.\\" being picked. === Reception of theme === Shohreh Aghdashloo was given an award by the Muslim Public Affairs Council for her voice performance The Simpsons is noted for its religious themes, primarily the Protestant faith of most characters, but has also featured episodes based around Judaism, Catholicism, Hinduism and Buddhism. However, this was the first to have a plot involving Islam. In 2000, Religion writer Mark I. Pinsky contacted the show's staff while writing The Gospel According to The Simpsons to inquire why there was not an episode involving Islam. He was told that this was because they did not know enough about the faith, but were intending to make an episode. In a June 2015 article for CNN after several controversies regarding depictions of Muhammad, Pinsky noted \\"MyPods and Boomsticks\\" as a satire of Islam that is \\"wise, and well within the show's tradition of portraying an unfamiliar faith in a knowing way, with a relatively light hand, while at the same time defanging a widespread religious prejudice\\". David Feltmate, a writer on religious topics, mentioned the episode in his book Drawn to the Gods: Religion in The Simpsons, South Park and Family Guy, alongside the South Park episode \\"The Snuke\\" and the Family Guy episode \\"Turban Cowboy\\". He wrote that all three of those animated sitcoms treat Islam in the same way as they do new religious movements, interpreting them through widely held stereotypes, in this case terrorism. However, in his opinion, \\"MyPods and Boomsticks\\" is the one example in which Islam is hated at the start of the episode but not at the end. The Council on American–Islamic Relations praised the episode and sent a commending letter to Matt Groening. The Council's Executive Director Nihad Awad wrote that \\"Because of its acceptance in popular culture, comedy is often one of the best vehicles for challenging stereotypes and intolerance. Fox and Matt Groening are to be congratulated for tackling the disturbing phenomenon of Islamophobia.\\" In April 2009, The Muslim Public Affairs Council gave an award to Shohreh Aghdashloo, the voice performer of Mina. The organization said that \\"The episode sends a powerful message through humor about the danger of ignorance and prejudice rooted in false assumptions\\". Wilmore's writing of the episode was nominated for Outstanding Writing in a Comedy Series at the 40th NAACP Image Awards. The award went to Erica D. Montolfo for the \\"White Coats and White Lies\\" episode of The Game. == References  External links == * Category:Television episodes about Islam Category:The Simpsons (season 20) episodes Category:2008 American television episodes Category:Cultural depictions of Steve Jobs Category:Islamophobia in the United States ","title":"MyPods and Boomsticks"},{"id":"19246850","text":"Daisuke Tsuda may refer to: *Daisuke Tsuda (musician) (born 1977), vocalist of Maximum the Hormone *Daisuke Tsuda (journalist) (born 1973), Japanese journalist ","title":"Daisuke Tsuda"},{"id":"19246855","text":"Blackpool pier may refer to one of three piers in the English seaside resort town of Blackpool, in Lancashire: *North Pier, Blackpool *Central Pier, Blackpool *South Pier, Blackpool ","title":"Blackpool pier"},{"id":"19246865","text":"Charlotte Guillard (died 1557) was the first woman printer of importance. Guillard worked at the famous Soleil d'Or printing house from 1502 until her death. Annie Parent described her as a \\"notability of the Rue Saint-Jacques\\", the street where the shop was located in Paris, France. She became one of the most important printers of the Latin Quarter area in the city of Paris. As a woman, she was officially active with her own imprint during her two widowhood periods,Béatrice Craig: Women and Business Since 1500: Invisible Presences in Europe and North America? that is to say in 1519–20, and in 1537–57. While she was not the first woman printer, succeeding both Anna Rugerin of Augsburg (1484) and Anna Fabri of Stockholm (1496), she was the first woman printer with a significantly known career. ==BiographyEarly life=== Guillard was very likely born in the late 1480s in Paris, France. Her name is sometime spelled Guillart and in Latin books as Carola Guillard. Her parents were Jacques Guillard and Guillemyne Saney. The professions of her parents are unknown, nor is recorded their social status. The family's exact place of residence is not known. They had many connections with the province of Maine in France. She could very well have been born there instead of Paris. Guillard had at least three and possibly four sisters and one brother. ===First career=== Guillard showed interest in the printing business as early as 1500 when she was still a teenager. Guillard first married Berthold Rembolt in 1502. Her first husband worked with the earliest French printer Ulrich Gering. Their printing business went so well that they eventually took over a small hotel that housed their family and employees. Rembolt died in 1519. Paris businesses and crafts in the sixteenth century were regulated by the guild system. Normally women were not allowed to own a business, however they were allowed by these guilds to take over the business of their husband after their death. Guillard took over management of her husband's print shop after his death. She took on the duties of proofreading the Latin publications. Her works were recognized for their beauty and accuracy. In fact she built up such a good reputation of accuracy that she was commissioned by the Bishop of Verona to publish his works. She was often associated with Guillaume des Boys, her brother-in-law.Library of Congress ===Second career=== In 1520 Guillard married Claude Chevallon, a bookseller who also printed theological books. From this time forward, Guillard was known as \\"Madame Chevallon.\\" She was widowed a second time in 1537. Thereafter, Madame Chevallon ran his printing business on her own. Her business was significant: she owned four or five printing presses with between 12 and 25 employees and a stock of 13000 books. She catered to students, professional or religious clientele, often printed anti-Protestant books, and offered books in Latin as well as Greek. She probably died in 1557. More than 400 different libraries worldwide have books printed by Guillard. There are over 200 different publications by Guillard available worldwide. ==Selected works== * The works of the Fathers * Jacques Toussain (Jacobus Tusanus), Lexicon Graecolatinum (1552)Parisijs, Apud Carolam Guillard viduam Claudij Cheuallonij, in via Iacobæa sub sole aureo: & Guilielmum Merlin, in ponte Teloneorum sub signo hominis syluestris * Louis Lassere, La Vie de Monseigneur Sainct Hierosme (1541) (previously printed by Josse Badius ca. 1529) * List of works printed by Charlotte Guillard (on Copac) *Alexandri ab Alexandro iurisperiti Neapolitani genialium dierum libri sex, varia ac recondita eruditione referti (Paris: Carolam Guillard, 1539), from the Lisa Unger Baskin Collection at Duke University. ==NotesBibliography== * Beatrice Beech, \\"Charlotte Guillard: a sixteenth-century business woman,\\" in: Renaissance Quarterly; No. 36, 3 (Autumn 1983:345-367) * Rémi Jimenes, \\"Passeurs d'atelier .

It was fought on the Primero River, near the city of Córdoba, Argentina, on 22 April 1829. The Federalist forces of Córdoba Province governor Juan Bautista Bustos were defeated by the Unitarian forces of General José María Paz. As a result of his victory, Paz assumed the office of provincial Governor. ==Prelude== General Bustos had governed Córdoba since the days of the Arequito Revolt, in 1820. His confrontation with Paz, who had fought with him in the revolt, had started a few months earlier: Paz thought Bustos had betrayed the rebel group, not carrying his army to the seat of the independence war in Upper Peru. After a lacklustre career in Salta Province, Paz had made a name for himself in the war with Brazil, where he was promoted to the rank of general after the Battle of Ituzaingó. He then declared himself to be against the Buenos Aires governor Manuel Dorrego who had been forced to sign a peace treaty with the Empire of Brazil which granted the independence of Uruguay and its separation from the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Paz supported the revolution against Dorrego, organized and fought the forces of Juan Lavalle. As Lavalle had not been able to vanquish the dissidents in his province, Paz gathered his troops in the interior of the country and marched north, with the excuse of returning his men to their provinces. Instead, he reached Córdoba's provincial capital city, where he demanded Bustos's resignation, whose mandate had expired, and wanted to elect a new governor (the provincial constitution had term limits and prohibited a third mandate), while everybody at the time knew that Paz had in mind to be a candidate himself. Paz attacked Córdoba with his powerful army, but Bustos escaped to a ranch at San Roque, in the foothills near the city. Bustos tried to negotiate an agreement by which neither would be the new governor. Paz disagreed, and broke relations, accusing Bustos of delaying tactics while awaiting reinforcements. Bustos had sent a message to Juan Facundo Quiroga, the caudillo and militia commander in La Rioja Province, asking for help. ==Battle development== Before Bustos could receive reinforcements, Paz advanced towards San Roque. Bustos made a last effort, sending his son-in-law Arredondo to negotiate peace. Paz attacked without answering. It is possible, judging by the lack of movements or preparations on the part of Bustos, that Arredondo had not yet arrived with a response, so the federalist commander would have thought they were still within a period of truce. Paz's behavior the next year at the Battle of Oncativo supposes this was the case. Bustos was not very experienced in battle, and the few he had won were from defensive positions. He therefore just waited for the unitarians, protecting his position with artillery. Paz simply divided his forces and commanded his lieutenants to just walk over anybody on their front. The order was followed in each of his groups, after a severe bombardment over the federalist positions by commander Arengreen's artillery. The divisions commanded by Román Deheza, Gregorio Aráoz de Lamadrid and Juan Esteban Pedernera displaced the enemy's forces before them with ease. The federalist troops, on their side were severely affected by the unitarian bombardment, and after the capture of their artillery and heavy losses of their men, they simply ran. The unitarian cavalry slaughtered the running enemy causing more than 100 dead in a few minutes. In a little more than a half-hour of combat, Bustos ordered a retreat of his remaining forces. ==Consequences== Bustos was forced to leave, running for refuge within Quiroga's troops, therefore abandoning his province. Only a month later, Bustos and Quiroga tried again for revenge: invaded the province of Córdoba, occupied most of the western hills and marched on the provincial capital. They confronted Paz at the Battle of La Tablada but ultimate victory was again on Paz's side. Córdoba province remained under Paz's and unitarian control, joined with the federalists that had left Bustos plus the young class of city lawyers and merchants. He then set to make at least a tacit alliance with the unitarian governments of the provinces of Tucumán and Salta, and after the next battles he could formalize the Unitarian League (a.k.a. Liga del Interior) San Roque was the first of four battles commanded by general Paz. He won all four decisively, distinguishing himself as the best Argentine general of the time. The Battle of San Roque's field is today under the waters of San Roque Lake, near today's city of Villa Carlos Paz. ==See also== *Argentine Civil War *Pacto Federal *Unitarian Party *Federales (Argentina) ==Bibliography== * * * Category:Conflicts in 1829 Category:Battles of the Argentine Civil War Category:April 1829 events Category:1829 in Argentina ","title":"Battle of San Roque"},{"id":"19246934","text":"Agneta Bolme Börjefors (26 April 1941 – 11 August 2008) was a Swedish television presenter, television producer and royal reporter for Sveriges Television.

The Order ran into financial trouble after the First World War and in 1933 had to sell the church and the Johanneshof, and the church was given over to other uses within a historical preservation order. It was bought back in 1960 and restored in stages in 1968, 1972 and 1983-84, finishing with a general restoration in 1998. The church's high altarpiece was painted in 1730 by Johann Georg Schmidt.

It was among a number of similar designs ordered by the US Navy before pure-jet aircraft had demonstrated their ability to operate from carriers and the mixed-propulsion designs were abandoned. Only two prototypes were constructed, one of which crashed while the other survives to this day. ==Development== By the late 1940s, the United States Navy was interested in the mixed-power concept for its shipborne fighters. Jet engines of that era had very slow throttle response, which presented a safety concern in the case of a missed approach on an aircraft carrier as the aircraft might not be able to throttle up quickly enough to keep flying after leaving the end of the deck. This led to orders for a number of mixed-propulsion fighters, including the FR Fireball. As such, an order was placed with Curtiss on 7 April 1944 for delivery of three mixed-power aircraft, designated the F15C. Powered by both a 2,100 hp (1,566 kW) Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp propeller engine, and an Allis-Chalmers J36 turbojet, the aircraft was in theory the fastest fighter in the US Navy at that time. ==Operational history== The first flight of the first prototype was on 27 February , without the turbojet installed. When this was completed in April of the same year, the aircraft flew several mixed-power trials, however on 8 May, it crashed on a landing approach. The second prototype flew for the first time on 9 July, again in 1945, and was soon followed by a third prototype. Both aircraft showed promise, however, by October , the Navy had lost interest in the mixed-power concept and cancelled further development. ==Surviving aircraft== ;XF15C-1 :Of the two remaining prototypes of this unusual aircraft, one was scrapped after the World War II, and the other remained in storage until it was released by the US Navy to be a museum piece. It was then located at the Quonset Air Museum in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. A part of the roof has collapsed because of ice and snow in March 2014, and this museum is now closed. The sole survivor is now on static display at the Hickory Aviation Museum, in Hickory, North Carolina. ==SpecificationsSee alsoReferences== * ==External links== * Curtiss XF15C-1 page at Air Enthusiasts Corner * Curtiss XF15C-1 page at Jets45 * Quonset Air Museum Collections page on the only remaining XF-15C which can be seen by the public Category:1940s United States fighter aircraft F15C Category:Mixed-power aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1945 Category:Low-wing aircraft Category:T-tail aircraft ","title":"Curtiss XF15C"},{"id":"19247116","text":"Vasilis N.

In 2018, the fair was expected to attract over 2 million visitors.https://luxtimes.lu/community/34719-five-new-rides-at-this-year-s- schueberfouer ==History== John I of Luxembourg, better known as John the Blind, King of Bohemia and Count of Luxembourg, founded the Schueberfouer on 20 October 1340. The founding document stated: It will begin on the eve of the feast of St Bartholomew and will last for a full eight days. Even today, it remains linked to St Bartholomew's day, 24 August, the traditional opening date. The name Schueberfouer is thought to originate probably from the name of the market place where it was first held: the Schuedbuerg, today's \\"Plateau du St Esprit\\" (in English: Holy Spirit Plateau; in Luxembourgish: Helleggeescht- Plateau), which serves nowadays as residential location for the highest courts of justice of Luxembourg. (\\"Fouer\\" is the Luxembourgish word for \\"fair\\".) Another unconfirmed theory links the term \\"Schueber\\" to the old German word \\"Schober\\" (in English: barn), which would refer to the initial agricultural role of the fair. Indeed, for almost 450 years, the fair was mainly a large and regionally very important market for everything from agricultural products and livestock to cloth, pottery and other household items. After the Limpertsberg wood had been removed to improve the defensive capabilities of the city, the fair moved in 1610 to the Glacis, a huge open space beyond the westward fortifications of Luxembourg City which were destroyed after 1867 and replaced by the City Park. During the 18th century, shows and games became part of the fair but it was not until the early 20th century that a Ferris wheel and a rollercoaster first appeared.\\"History\\", Schueberfouer.

As Anselmos contract ended and the Halmstad unable to provide the amounts Anselmo wished for to sign a new contract, he departed the club and signed for Brazilian club Botafogo (SP). ==Honours== ; Ceará * Campeonato Cearense: 2013 ;Tombense * Campeonato Brasileiro Série D: 2014 ; Ceará * Campeonato Cearense: 2016 ;Santo André * Campeonato Paulista Série A2: 2019 ==References *HBK profile *Swedish FA profile *Anselmo Official Website Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Expatriate footballers in Qatar Category:Expatriate footballers in Sweden Category:Expatriate footballers in China Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Qatar Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Sweden Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in China Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série A players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série B players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série C players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro Série D players Category:Allsvenskan players Category:Chinese Super League players Category:Qatar Stars League players Category:Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras players Category:Sociedade Esportiva do Gama players Category:Al-Sailiya SC players Category:Associação Atlética Ponte Preta players Category:Clube Náutico Capibaribe players Category:Paysandu Sport Club players Category:Clube Atlético Mineiro players Category:Criciúma Esporte Clube players Category:Boavista Sport Club players Category:CR Vasco da Gama players Category:Avaí FC players Category:Halmstads BK players Category:Botafogo Futebol Clube (SP) players Category:Atlético Clube Goianiense players Category:Shanghai Shenxin F.C. players Category:Ceará Sporting Club players Category:Clube Atlético Linense players Category:Tombense Futebol Clube players Category:Macaé Esporte Futebol Clube players Category:Fortaleza Esporte Clube players Category:Volta Redonda Futebol Clube players Category:Esporte Clube Santo André players Category:Club Sportivo Sergipe players ","title":"Anselmo (footballer, born 1980)"},{"id":"19247233","text":"\\"When The Boat Comes In\\" (or \\"Dance Ti Thy Daddy\\") is a traditional English folk song, originating in North East England. An early source for the lyrics, Joseph Robson's \\"Songs of the bards of the Tyne\\" , published 1849, can be found on the FARNE archive Direct link will only work once the reader has initiated a search session on FARNE archive. . In FARNE's notes to the song, it is stated that these lyrics were written by William Watson around 1826. It was popularised as the theme tune to the 1970s BBC drama serial When The Boat Comes In in an arrangement by the composer David Fanshawe. ==Lyrics== There are two distinct sets of lyrics in popular culture for the song. The theme to the TV series of the same name, sung by Alex Glasgow, was released as a BBC single and uses the traditional lyrics. The song was also used in the TV advertisement for Young's fish, Sea to Plate campaign which uses the same lyrics as The Wiggles. The lyrics from traditional version of the song, used by the TV series, differ significantly from those of the TV advertisement. {class=\\"toccolours\\" cellpadding=\\"15\\" rules=\\"cols\\" - ! style=\\"padding: 1em\\" Traditional version (From Farne) ! style=\\"padding: 1em\\" Young's fish advertisement transcription - !colspan=\\"2\\" bgcolor=\\"#169B62\\"First verse -  style=\\"padding: 1em 1em 0\\"  Come here, my little Jacky  style=\\"padding: 1em 1em 0\\"  Dance to your Daddy, my little laddie -  style=\\"padding: 1em 1em 0\\"  Now I've smoked my backey  style=\\"padding: 1em 1em 0\\"  Dance to your Daddy, my little man -  style=\\"padding: 1em 1em 0\\"  Let's have a bit crackey  style=\\"padding: 1em 1em 0\\"  Thou shalt have a fish and thou shalt have a fin -  style=\\"padding: 1em 1em 0\\"  Till the boat comes in  style=\\"padding: 1em 1em 0\\"  Thou shalt have a codlin when the boat comes in -  style=\\"padding: 1em 1em 0\\"  Dance to thy daddy, sing to thy mammy,  style=\\"padding: 1em 1em 0\\"  Thou shalt have haddock baked in a pan -  style=\\"padding: 1em 1em 0\\"  Dance to thy daddy, to thy mammy sing;

Agnes was active in social justice causes including protests against the white slave trade. She signed the 1866 women's suffrage petition and was secretary of the Edinburgh National Society for Women's Suffrage alongside her stepmother, Priscilla Bright McLaren. In 1873 she travelled with Priscilla and Jane Taylour to give suffrage lectures in Orkney and Shetland. Her father had supported the campaign of first women who sought to study medicine at University of Edinburgh and Agnes became friends with Sophia Jex- Blake, one of the Edinburgh Seven. Her father did not however, support Agnes' own ambitions in this area. She left Scotland to study in France and later, in order to be permitted to practice in Scotland became a member of the Royal College of Dublin. She converted to the Catholic faith in order to carry out missionary work even though Roman Catholic law prevented women from becoming doctors until 1936. ==Background== McLaren was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. The daughter of Duncan McLaren, a Presbyterian businessman and prominent liberal politician, by his second marriage. Her mother died when she was only three years old. Her father's third wife was Priscilla Bright and in time they would work together. Agnes McLaren She entered the school of medicine at the University of Montpellier in 1876, eventually becoming only the tenth woman in Britain to graduate as a doctor. In 1877 she sat on the governing body of the London School of Medicine for Women. She was a visiting physician at the Cannongate Medical Mission Dispensary in Edinburgh. By 1882, she was also fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, and had a practice in Cannes. She would spend the summers in Edinburgh and relocate to France in the winter. ==India== In 1898 aged 61, she converted to the Roman Catholic Church, and later went to Rawalpindi, northern India (now Pakistan) with a Catholic mission, she had learned of the tremendous health needs of women in India. Because of India’s custom of seclusion for women (purdah), they could not be seen by men other than their immediate family, a custom which meant they also could not receive medical care from male physicians. With so few women doctors in the early 1900s, literally thousands of women died in illness or in childbirth each year and many babies also died in infancy. McLaren responded to this problem by establishing the Medical Mission Committee in London, which financed the opening of a small hospital, St. Catherine’s Hospital, in Rawalpindi, a particularly needy area. During her search for women who could help run the hospital, McLaren discovered that Catholic Canon Law prohibited Religious Sisters from giving this level of medical care. She petitioned the Pope and Holy See to lift the restriction and, while waiting for a response, continued looking for women interested in health care abroad. Anna Maria Dengel, an Austrian, responded to McLaren’s request, but was never able to meet McLaren, who died shortly after their correspondence began. However, before her death, McLaren encouraged Dengel to study medicine at the Cork University, setting into motion Dengel’s becoming a physician and, years later, her starting a new religious congregation, the Medical Mission Sisters. They are a Catholic congregation of Sisters who are trained as doctors and nurses and other forms of healthcare professionals, dedicated to providing healthcare to women and children around the world. In 1915, after reading a biographical pamphlet about McLaren's life, Australian doctor Mary Glowrey experienced her vocation to work as a medical missionary in Guntur, India. Mary Glowrey received special permission from Pope Benedict XV to work as a medical doctor and Religious Sister in 1920. McLaren died in 1913 and was buried in Antibes, France. Her obituary in the British Medical Journal describes her as : 'a woman of strong individuality and character, known to a large circle of philanthropic workers of many nations, many kindreds and many creeds.' ==ReferencesFurther reading== *The British Medical Journal: Medico-Legal, 1913 April 26. vol. 1 (2730): 917 * * 'According to the pattern; the story of Dr. Agnes McLaren and the Society of Catholic medical missionaries', by Katherine Burton (1946) * She stepped out of her class : the life and times of Agnes McLaren, by Janet Gottschalk.(2003) * The Journeying Ladies: Agnes McLaren, Elizbeth Leseur, Edith Stein, Margaret Laurentia McLachlan by Joyce Sugg (1967) Category:1837 births Category:1913 deaths Category:People from Edinburgh Category:Roman Catholic activists Category:Roman Catholic medical missionaries Category:Scottish Roman Catholic missionaries Category:University of Montpellier alumni Category:19th-century Scottish medical doctors Category:Converts to Roman Catholicism from Calvinism Category:Scottish expatriates in France Category:Scottish suffragists Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in India Category:Roman Catholic missionaries in Pakistan Category:Medicine Category:Women in medicine Category:National Society for Women's Suffrage ","title":"Agnes McLaren"},{"id":"19247301","text":"The United Kingdom Vineyards Association (UKVA) is a trade association of English and Welsh vineyards that represents that vast majority of the UK's vineyards.

Chan refused to withdraw his comment and LegCo president Tsang Yok-sing subsequently ruled that no LegCo rules had been violated. Leung, along with six other legislators, then protested against Tsang's decision, insisting that Albert Chan had defamed her, and walked out of the chamber to boycott the meeting. === LegCo members' resignations and by-election === On 21 January 2010, in a response to the quasi-referendum on universal suffrage, triggered by the resignation of five pan-democrat members of LegCo, Leung announced she would introduce a private member's bill to forbid legislators who resign from running in elections in the same four-year term. Ronny Tong criticised her move as a contravention of the Basic Law: he said such a bill would infringe the right to stand for elections protected under Article 26 and would be inconsistent with Article 74 which prohibits individual legislators from tabling bills that relate to the political structure. A less-extreme government bill, imposing a six-month prohibition on running for election after resignation, was passed in May 2012, in the face of filibustering efforts from legislators Leung Kwok-hung and Albert Chan. === Scouts for Occupy Central Movement === In July 2014, she championed the Hong Kong Government's establishment of the \\"Voluntary Scouts\\". ==Education== * St. Paul's Co-educational College * BSSc Social Sciences (Government and Public Administration), The Chinese University of Hong Kong * Common Professional Examination, HKU SPACE & Manchester Metropolitan University * Postgraduate Certificate in Laws, University of Hong Kong * LLM, Renmin University of China * Doctor of Juridical Science, Renmin University of China ==Publications== Leung published different articles and books, in English and Chinese, on the areas of Chinese Law, Hong Kong Basic Law and conflict of laws between mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. * China Law Reports.

He entered Gray's Inn on 22 July 1685 and was admitted at Christ's College, Cambridge on 14 July 1686. By his marriage, White was responsible for the family eventually settling at Wallingwells. This was the result of losing his way one night. On his way home after a journey, he hoped to make the final leg of the trip from Sheffield to Tuxford in one evening. He was on horseback, followed by his servant and baggage. The land between Sheffield and Tuxford was in those days unenclosed and the roads were little more than packhorse tracks. White lost his way in the darkness, but stumbled upon an ancient moated house, which had formerly been a priory. The house was owned by Richard Taylor, a captain in the Nottinghamshire Militia, MP for East Retford and lately High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire. Taylor put White up for the night and showed great hospitality to him.Miss M H Towry White, Some account of the family of White of Tuxford and Wallingwells, Transactions of the Thoroton Society, 11 (1907) Wallingwells Hall, Nottinghamshire White's host, Richard Taylor, was married to Bridget Knight, daughter of Sir Ralph Knight of Langold and Warsop, and had a single daughter Bridget, who was then aged 16 years. White was then 31 years old. After this accidental meeting of White and the Taylor family, White became good friends with the Taylors and regularly repeated his visits. He married Bridget Taylor at Carlton Church on 28 July 1698. When Richard Taylor died in the spring of 1699, White and his wife inherited his estates at Wallingwells and Buerly (Pately Bridge). They decided to move into Wallingwells at this time, making it their home and seat. Once in residence White was appointed as Deputy Lieutenant for Nottinghamshire. ==Political career== White was elected Member of Parliament for East Retford in the poll at the first general election of 1701 in January. However, he was unseated on petition on 15 April 1701. He was returned successfully at East Retford at the second general election of 1701 in December. He was elected in the poll again at the 1702 general election, but was again unseated on petition on 28 November 1702. White did not stand again at the 1705 English general election. He was occupied with local administration, and in the year when there was a fear of invasion, he was investigating possible subversives of Catholic persuasion. At the 1708 general election at East Retford he was backed by Newcastle and the Whig interest, and came top in the poll. In Parliament, he voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell. He was re-elected at the 1710 general election, but was unseated on 11 January 1711. White was returned unopposed as MP for East Retford at the 1715 general election. At the time of the Jacobite rebellion, he was very active in the Nottinghamshire militia and reported to the new Duke of Newcastle on the decisions of the deputy-lieutenants. He was rewarded with the office of Clerk of the Ordnance of the Tower in 1718. He carried on voting with the Whigs for the remainder of his career in Parliament. He was returned again at the general elections of 1722 and 1727. ==Death and legacy== White died suddenly of an apoplectic fit at Wallingwells on 30 September 1732 aged 63 years. He is buried under the High Altar in Tuxford Church. His widow Bridget continued to live at Wallingwells until her death on 17 January 1761. White and his wife Bridget had five children: # John White (1699 – 7 September 1769) # Taylor White (1701–1772) # Bridget White, married Sir John Heathcote, 2nd Baronet in 1720 # Anne White (died 27 February 1744), married Sir Griffith Boynton, 5th Baronet on 6 April 1742. She died five days after the birth of her son Griffith. # Mary White (5 February 1710 – 29 September 1785), unmarried White was described by his third cousin Lady Mary Wortley Montagu as a jovial countryman. George Gregory said of him that he had ‘lost a good friend and the public a good officer’ and the country a ‘useful person among us’. ==References== Category:1667 births Category:1732 deaths Category:English MPs 1701 Category:English MPs 1701–1702 Category:English MPs 1702–1705 Category:English MPs 1705–1707 Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1708–1710 Category:British MPs 1710–1713 Category:British MPs 1715–1722 Category:British MPs 1722–1727 Category:British MPs 1727–1734 Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Nottinghamshire Category:Alumni of Christ's College, Cambridge Category:Members of Gray's Inn ","title":"Thomas White (1667–1732)"},{"id":"19247447","text":"Dillon County Airport is a county-owned public-use airport located three nautical miles (6 km) north of the central business district of Dillon, a city in Dillon County, South Carolina, United States.

The Reserve once owned most of the Adirondack High Peaks. The club is also the home of the Adirondack Trail Improvement Society, known as A.T.I.S, which developed and still maintains many of the trails to the high peaks. The clubhouse property, also known as St. Hubert's Inn, Beede House, or Beede Heights Hotel, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. See also: Club members have included Harvard president James Conant, clergyman Henry Sloane Coffin, aeronautical engineer Jerome Hunsaker, painter Harold Weston, American statesman John J.

Rainbow Falls, West River Trail, on AMR lands Noonmark from Round Mountain, showing the Great Range from Gothics to Lower Wolfjaw Mountain, all reachable via AMR lands ==History== The present clubhouse sits on the site of Beede's Hotel, built in 1876. Beede's was one of the first of the Adirondack hotels to cater to wealthy sportsmen eager to escape city life during the summer, a phenomenon that predated the Civil War, but that was greatly accelerated by advances in transportation offered by steam ships and railroads. Beede's was notorious for its austere accommodations, but no less famous for its setting near Upper and Lower Ausable Lakes and the Ausable River, and for its views of Giant and Noonmark Mountains, Sawteeth and Mount Colvin. Guides were available to lead parties up the rocky ravine of the Ausable to lean-to shelters on the lakes, and thence to the high peaks above. When it became known that the woods around Beede's was going to be timbered by the lumber company which owned them, a prominent Philadelphia mining engineer and summer resident William G. Neilson, secured a two-month option on the property dated September 20, 1886. Neilson approached several friends to join in the purchase of , including the two lakes and nearby mountains. By December 1, 1886, William Neilson, William Alderson, George Burnham, Charles Hinchman, J.W. Fuller, Richard Dale and Edward Howell successfully raised the down payment to secure a two-year warranty deed which was signed by Neilson and Alderson. By October 1887, twenty-nine stockholders had formed a corporation, the Adirondack Mountain Reserve. Although the Reserve prohibited hunting and camping, the land remained open to the public for hiking. The AMR added to its holdings, reaching a peak of in 1910. However, in 1933 and again in 1978, land was sold to the state of New York as part of the Adirondack Park, so that present holdings amount to about . In 1890, the owners of the Reserve formed the Keene Heights Hotel Company, with a plan to purchase Beede's Hotel, but the building burned to the ground in March. Philadelphia architectural firm Wilson Brothers & Company was hired to design St. Hubert's Inn, and four months later the new hotel was opened in the present structure. However, by 1904, the venture proved unprofitable, and was closed. The following year, the AMR's owners formed the Ausable Club, and purchased the hotel property as a clubhouse. ==The clubhouse== The clubhouse is a -story clapboard building with sparing use of Queen Anne details, arranged in two long blocks joined at a 22.5 degree angle where a large 3-story octagonal porch provides sheltered access to the surrounding views. In addition, a porch runs the full length of the first floor. Protected by its status as a clubhouse, the building has suffered remarkably little change, inside or out, since it was built. ==References * Official website * About, ausableclub.org *Adirondack Journey - Principal Adirondack Trailheads Category:Environmental organizations based in the United States Category:Hiking organizations in the United States Category:History of New York (state) Category:Adirondacks Category:Clubhouses on the National Register of Historic Places in New York (state) Category:Queen Anne architecture in New York (state) Category:Cultural infrastructure completed in 1876 Category:Cultural infrastructure completed in 1890 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Essex County, New York Category:1890 establishments in New York (state) ","title":"Ausable Club"},{"id":"19247484","text":"Omar Abdi is a Somali-Canadian diplomat.

His online activity served as an early electronic precursor to popular social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. His magazine remains one of the only independent and privately owned publications of its kind. Created in the beginning of the 1990s – it still remains a major reference for other alternative magazines today. == Early life and education == Zahm pictured in 1979 in Paris Olivier Zahm was born and raised in Paris, France. He was the eldest of three children born to two university professors. His parents, who were both students at the time of his birth, raised Zahm and his other siblings in student quarters that were designed by Charlotte Perriand and Jean Prouvé, located at Résidence Universitaire Jean-Zay in Antony. Much of his early childhood was spent in academic settings, particularly- during the volatile period of civil unrest in France that broke out in May 1968. The protests reached such a point that political leaders feared civil war or revolution. The unrest began with a series of student occupation protests against capitalism, consumerism, American imperialism, and traditional institutions, values and order. Many of the new and radical ideas surrounding Zahm, immersing his youth in tumultuous generational discord, stayed with him, shaping his views on art, philosophical ideas and lifestyle choices. He leveraged his profound formative experience using it as a tool to build aspects and themes that remain prevalent in his personal and professional life in adulthood. He told The New York Times in 2010 that he, \\"remembers summers spent vacationing in the South of France with his parents in a community of like minded free spirits\\" – who he labeled hippies. It was the 1970s, the decade of sex revolution and Zahm's parents were committed to free love, nudism and polyamourous relationships. \\"My parents had a lot of lovers, they had a lot of affairs. At the time, my parents were really part of this alternative movement in Paris but quite bourgeois too. It wasn't San Francisco or New York. It was the French way.\\" Zahm's love of magazines began when he was a teenager in the Paris suburbs. \\"We used to steal porn magazines in the bookstores and shops and look at them during school,\\" he says. \\"It was fun and secret. This is where my obsession for magazines comes from. Magazines used to reveal and give us access to sex, fashion, music and art. TV never did that, and books are mostly academic. Magazines were a symbol of freedom.\\" He studied philosophy, history, semiotics and literature at the Sorbonne. His father, Claude, taught philosophy, and Zahm was on track to do the same, before realizing, at 25, that he preferred life outside \\"la tour d’ ivoire.\\" Zahm's youngest sister committed suicide in 1994 at the age of 20. == Career == Before entering the world of fashion, Zahm worked as an art critic with widespread recognition for his work as a curator as well as his participation in over 150 exhibitions featuring international contemporary art. In responding to the superficial glamour of the 1980s, Zahm co-founded Purple Prose magazine. In the introduction of Purple Anthology, Zahm shares why he chose to create Purple Prose: > \\"We launched Purple Prose in the early 1990s without any means, and without > any experience, because we wanted to make a magazine that was radically > different. We wanted to support the artists around us that no one else > supported, much less talked about. It would be a form of opposition of our > own\\". === Art critic and curator (1985–1994) === During the beginning of the 80s Zahm started to observe and take an interest in the art world. He liked the notion of \\"being everywhere and on the move\\", following art fairs, meeting artists, educating himself in the universe of contemporary art while immersing himself into its social landscape. Zahm's gift of being a charismatic intellectual and having an eye for contemporary art made itself apparent early on. He found himself penning for the three leading art titles at the time Art Forum, Art Flash, Texte zur Kunst and Art presse and introduced a then unknown Jeff Koons, Martin Kippenberger, and Larry Clark to the European art world. He started traveling to the United States and Japan, realizing he could set up his own operation and work agenda, 24/7. He told I-D magazine in 2010: Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville Paris curated by Zahm > \\"Freedom for me came from the art world because it was a place where I could > meet the artists. I wanted to be a social critic. I was more interested in > the category of intellectual, involving art and politics and writing > sometimes. But I didn't want to be a writer necessarily, I just wanted to be > part of an intellectual world.\\" In 1989, while working at Artforum, Elien Fleiss, then a young gallery curator received a phone call from Zahm. She was looking for an art critic to write a manifesto against a journalist from a daily newspaper who she felt was writing insanities about contemporary art in general. Zahm agreed to do it, and that was the beginning of the encounter, which then became a love story. Their romance was short-lived, but their professional relationship was fruitful. In 1994, they curated \\"The Winter of Love,\\"https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/4589 a hit show for the Museum of Modern Art in Paris that they later took to P.S. 1 in New York City. In May 2017, Zahm published a book in collaboration with Donation Grau titled,' Une avant-garde sans avant-garde'.The book is a collection of Zahm's most significant texts written during the last 30 years. It is above all a radical reading of art from the 1990s to the present. The anthology tries to decipher this chaotic, contradictory, oppressive, and ultra-creative period. The introductions that precede each chapter contextualize the selected texts, and develop the idea that the 1990s invented an avant-garde without an avant- garde, the issues of which are increasing and intensifying. === Purple ===  Early day's of Purple (1992–2004)  Zahm gravitated towards the idea of working with magazines from the conception of his career in art. In 1992 Zahm and his partner Elien Fleiss printed the first issue of Purple Prose, a Parisian literary art zine. Their goal was to create a new kind of space for artists to present their work and express their ideas; and to design a network through which people working in different disciplines, could easily access new information and each other and contributing to the early 90s alternative indie culture. Zahm liked the idea of a color sharing the title with an art magazine. Dike Blair an American artist suggested the title Purple Prose in reference to the literary term in which a prose text is so extravagant, ornate, or flowery that it breaks the flow and draws excessive attention to itself. Soon after the birth of Purple Prose, Zahm created spin-off publications like Purple Sexe, Purple Fiction and Purple Fashion. Zahm aimed at fusing together his two worlds, fashion and art, in creating Purple Fashion. A typical issue featured interviews, articles and presentations covering a wide range of topics and disciplines which include; film and video, politics, fashion, architecture, sexuality, science, photography and music. Each issue was built around a loose theme which serves to create a link between subjects-past examples have been: Indian Summer, Violet Violence, Post-Sex. With its international correspondents and cutting-edge design, Purple Prose had the distinctive feel of a truly global art zine. The texts were written in roughly equal parts French and English, without translations. For many years the magazine was associated with a realist esthetic, that of the new photography of the early 1990s- of photographers like Juergen Teller, Terry Richardson, Wolfgang Tillmans, and Mario Sorrenti. From a visual standpoint, the magazine represented a break from 80s imagery (like Richard Avedon’s photography for Versace, for example.) From an artistic standpoint, the artists from the early 1990s were raising up against art as a capitalist fetish; they were aligning themselves with the artistic social and political practices of the 1970s-- those of performance, video art, Fluxus, and the conceptual and minimalist avant-garde. The magazine was an integral part of this burgeoning context, which included the deconstruction of fashion by Martin Margiela and Comme des Garçsons; the return of subtle political art, with that of Felix Gonzalez- Torres, Maurizio Cattelan, and Philippe Parreno, among others; photography of Juergen Teller; and Harmony Korine and Larry Clark’s independent filmmaking.  Purple Magazine (2017–present)  For its 25th anniversary issue, Purple celebrated the artists and models who incarnated the spirit of the magazine through their style, attitude, and personality: Cindy Sherman, Wolfgang Tillmans, Chloe Savigny, Richard Prince, Paul McCarthy, Susan Cianciolo , Maurizio Cattelan, and more. It was the first time the magazine printed multiple covers for one issue. 25 different covers showed 25 Purple icons. It was also the first time purple distributed hard- cover magazines instead of the traditional soft-cover print. He described in the editions Edito: > “It’s been years now that younger generations don’t use magazines to express > themselves — at least not the way we did back in 1992. Social media now > generally satisfy the need for images, contacts, and creativity. Publishing > a magazine has become so expensive… An actual print object like Purple is a > luxury item, which is why new alternative magazines don’t last more than a > few years, are often bought, or simply disappear. Doing a luxury magazine > today is one of the paradoxes of the Instagram era, when such things cost > nothing… A magazine is not an ego trip… It’s a collective work by a group of > creative people who believe in the artistic value of the print media and > share a similar vision. (Thanks to all of them!) Every image, every single > text, the choice of paper, the layout, even the choice of typefaces matters. > Everything matters… Purple is made to last. Purple is made to capture a > moment every season… In this period of global Internet obsession and digital > amnesia, I think that means something\\" In 2017 Purple moved their US based headquarters and offices from New York City to Los Angeles. === Freelance editor === In the year 2000, Serge July, the founder and editor-in-chief of French national newspaper Libération hired Olivier Zahm to launch Liberation Style, an occasional Saturday supplement to the main paper. 15 issues were published every season until 2005. *Issue 1: Le Retour Paris *Issue 2: Personnalité Multiple *Issue 3: Plein Soleil *Issue 4: L’empire des Signes *Issue 5: Glamour *Issue 6: Special Creation *Issue 7: L’autre Amérique *Issue 8: La nuit *Issue 9: Femmes *Issue 10: Tokyo *Issue 11: Milan *Issue 12: Les Années Fatales *Issue 13: Best of L’ete 2005 *Issue 14: Special Hommes *Issue 15: Mystere Karl In 2009 Chanel launched its very first magazine: 31 Rue Cambon. Chanel's goal was to combine sales and information. Karl Lagerfeld delegated the artistic direction of the magazine which was not available to the public, but instead only the private cliental of Chanel to Zahm In 2018 Zahm designed a fanzine for Gucci’s FW2019 collection presented at Le Palace in Paris. The magazine was the 14th issue of Le Palace Magazine. == Photography == Zahm credited Lagerfeld for reigniting his sentiment for taking photos in 2005. Zahm told WWD in an interview dedicated to Purple's 25th Anniversary: > \\"He (Lagerfeld) was buying these little digital cameras at the time, Sony > Cyber-shots, a little pocket-size, flat, digital camera. He had a pile of > them on his table and said: “Take this, if you’ll use it.” We had this long > discussion about photography and I said, “Karl how can you want to be a > photographer when you were friends with Helmut Newton because, me, I have > Juergen Teller in my generation and I haven't been able to do photography > since I’ve known him, because he's the best.\\" And he said: “Olivier, shut > up. You don’t understand, photography is not about getting the right > picture, it’s about documenting your everyday life. Remember Warhol, do you > think he was a good photographer? He always had a camera on him. Do like > Warhol, do like me: Don’t let a day go by without taking a picture.” In 2009, he began documenting his late-night partying escapades in high- contrast black-and-white photographs which appeared on Purple Diary, a notorious photo blog that would become the seed for a full Purple website. He has had shows of his photographic work at Half Gallery in New York, Colette in Paris, Leadapron in Los Angeles and The Last Gallery in Tokyo. In addition to documenting his personal life on social media platform he continues to shoot many editorials and campaigns for various brands including Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Giorgio Armani, Uniqlo, Agent Provocateur, and magazines including Lui, Vogue Russia, and Kadewe among others. In 2014, Zahm partnered with Rizzoli published O.Z. Diary, a cosmopolitan 500-page photo diary exposing the lifestyles of the creative elite through a series of intimate, autobiographical photographs. Glenn O'Brien contributed various texts for the book. == Personal life == Zahm has a son, Balthus, with designer Natacha Ramsay-Levi, and a daughter, Asia, with writer Anna Dubosc. He splits his time between Los Angeles and Paris. ==References * Purple website Category:Living people Category:1964 births Category:French fashion journalists Category:French bloggers Category:French magazine editors Category:French art critics Category:French curators Category:French editors ","title":"Olivier Zahm"},{"id":"19247496","text":"Johann George Schmidt or Johann Georg(e) Schmi(e)d (1707, Fürstenwalde bei Geising - 24 July 1774, Dresden) was a German architect of the Dresden Baroque.

He succeeded to his father's estates, including Wallingwells in Nottinghamshire, at the age of 33 in 1732. A portrait of him as a young man show him as handsome, similar in looks to Prince Charles Edward Stuart. ==Career== White was an influential politician of his day. He was returned as Whig Member of Parliament for East Retford at a by-election on 26 January 1733 in succession to his father. He was returned unopposed at the 1734 British general election. He was elected a trustee and a common councillor of the Georgia Society. In 1736, he resigned from the council together with Robert More, though remaining a trustee. He was a professed Dissenter and no friend to church establishment' and disapproved of the Society's policy of appropriating land in Georgia to the endowment of the Church of England. Also in 1736, he spoke and voted against a proposal that Parliament should contribute £4,000 towards the repair of Henry VII's chapel. In 1739 he introduced a motion for the repeal of the Test Act. He voted with the Government on the Spanish convention that year but was absent from the division on the place bill in 1740. He was re-elected at the 1741 British general election, after a costly contest. Due to ill-health, he was absent on the division on the chairman of the elections committee but voted with the Government in all other recorded divisions. He was a supporter of Henry Pelham and the Duke of Newcastle, who were the Prime Ministers between 1744 and 1756. In particular he held sway over the Duke of Newcastle, who was a close friend of both John and his late father, Thomas. Their relationship is seen in a book of letters from the Duke to White. White was returned unopposed at the 1754 British general election and returned again at the 1761 British general election. He made only two speeches in the period, on the peace preliminaries, on 10 December 1762, and on a point of order in a debate on the Regency, on 9 May 1765. He lost control at East Retford, and at the 1768 British general election he decided not to stand. Each season White would travel in great state to London in a coach and six, attended by a throng of servants and outriders. The park at Wallingwells was well stocked with deer and its ponds teeming with fish. When at Wallingwells, John hunted and showed generous hospitality to his guests. He built the grotto on the edge of one of the ponds just south of the house. ==Death and legacy== White died unmarried on 7 September 1769. He was succeeded by his younger brother Taylor White. ==References== Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:Whig (British political party) MPs Category:1769 deaths Category:1699 births Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:British MPs 1734–1741 Category:British MPs 1741–1747 Category:British MPs 1747–1754 Category:British MPs 1754–1761 ","title":"John White (1699–1769)"},{"id":"19247540","text":"Marc Rosset was the defending champion at the Milan Indoor tennis tournament but lost in the second round to Greg Rusedski.

It is possible that her name represents the Early Irish Mael Curcaig.Thornton 99. According to Laxdæla saga, Hoskuld Dala-Kollsson purchased Melkorka, who he believed to be a selective mute thrall-woman, from a Rus' merchant on Brännöyar while on a trading expedition to Norway, and made her his concubine while away from his wife Jorunn Bjarnadottir.Lax. § 12 (Magnusson 63) When Höskuldr returned home to Iceland, he took her with him. Despite Jórunn's irritation, the concubine was accepted into Höskuldr's household, though he remained faithful to Jórunn while in Iceland. The following winter the concubine gave birth to a son, to whom they gave the name Ólafr after Höskuldr's uncle, Olaf Feilan, who had recently died.Lax. § 13 (Magnusson 67). Landnámabók mentions that Höskuldr and Melkorka had another son, Helgi, but he does not appear in Laxdæla.Ari 2:18. According to Laxdæla saga, Ólafr was a precocious child, and could speak and walk perfectly by the age of two. One day Höskuldr discovered Ólafr's mother speaking to her son; she was not, in fact, mute.Lax. § 13 (Magnusson 68). When he confronted her she told him that she was an Irish princess named Melkorka carried off in a viking raid, and that her father was an Irish king named \\"Myrkjartan\\" (Muirchertach) who has been associated with Muirchertach mac Néill.Lax. § 13 (Magnusson 68). Magnusson notes that there were a number of contemporary Irish petty kings by this name. Magnusson 68 at n.1 Shortly thereafter squabbling between Jórunn and Melkorka forced Höskuldr to move his concubine and his son by her to a different farm, which thereafter was known as Melkorkustaðir.Lax. § 13 (Magnusson 69). The fact that there is another site known by this name, at Borgarfordur, could indicate that Melkorka's name is not Gaelic in origin, but is instead derived from a name composed of the elements melr (\\"gravel hillock\\") and korka (\\"wasting away\\").Fellows-Jensen (120) Around 956, Ólafr, at Melkorka's urging, decided to go abroad to seek his fortune. Melkorka taught Ólafr Irish Gaelic and urged him to visit her family. Höskuldr was opposed to the expedition and would not provide trade wares, and the property of Ólafr's foster-father Þórðr was mostly in immobile goods and land. In part to arrange financing for his expedition, his mother Melkorka married Þorbjörn skrjúpur (\\"the Feeble\\"), a farmer who had previously assisted her in the management of Melkorkustaðir. Melkorka and Þorbjörn had a son named Lambi.Lax. § 20 (Magnusson 86-88). Ólafr visited Ireland, where he met Melkorka's father and kinsmen, Myrkjartan.Lax. § 21 (Magnusson 91). He introduced himself as Melkorka's son and explained that their kinship was his reason for visiting. Myrkjartan was not immediately convinced of their kinship, but he was impressed with Ólafr's Irish and sure that he was of high birth nevertheless. Then Ólafr showed Myrkjartan the gold ring on his arm, which Melkorka had given him when he left Iceland. It had originally been a gift from her father. After this, Myrkjartan was sure that Ólafr was his kinsman.Sagas. (309) Ólafr remained with Myrkjartan for a time, and the king, according to Laxdæla saga, even offered to make Ólafr his heir. Ólafr, however, returned to Norway, and then ultimately to Iceland, afraid of provoking Myrkjartan's sons.Lax. § 21 (Magnusson 93-96). Ólafr had wanted to take Melkorka's nurse back to Iceland to meet her, but Myrkjartan did not permit it.Sagas. (310) After his journey, Ólafr became renowned, both for his travels and because he was the grandson of the Irish king.Sagas. (312) ==Media== Melkorka is featured in the 2007 young adult novel Hush: An Irish Princess' Tale by author Donna Jo Napoli. The novel depicts how she became a slave and why she decided to remain mute. The novel ends as she is being taken to Iceland by Höskuldr. ==NotesReferences== *Ari the Learned.

On its homepage, FetLife describes itself as \\"Like Facebook, but run by kinksters like you and me.\\" The \\"Fet\\" in the name refers to \\"fetish\\". FetLife distinguishes itself from competitors by emphasizing itself as a social network rather than a dating site. It is on principle supportive of fringe sexual practices. ==History== FetLife was launched in January 2008 by John Kopanas (also known by his username John Baku), a software engineer in Montreal, Quebec. Frustrated by attempts to find women who had the same sexual interests as he did, Baku created a website in 2007 called \\"FriendsWithFetishes\\". While working on release 2.0 of FriendsWithFetishes, Baku decided to launch it as a separate site and named it FetLife. James Golick served as chief technology officer. ==Features== In the past, any member could create a group devoted to whatever fetish they chose. However, in January 2017, FetLife temporarily shut down the ability to create new groups. At the same time, they deleted hundreds of existing groups, including anything with the words blood, needles, rape and incest. The ability to create new groups was reinstated shortly afterwards. All new members are by default enrolled in the group Fetlife Announcements, which has (as of 2017) over 6 million members. There are many groups devoted to answering thematic questions, such as \\"Ask a Submissive\\", \\"Ask a Mistress\\", \\"Ask a Dominant\\", \\"Ask a Stripper\\", \\"Novices & Newbies\\" and so on. Groups can be searched for by words in the group title. In addition, there is a separate \\"directory\\" of fetishes which a member may indicate their interest in. Any member can create a new fetish. Any member can post an Event with date, location, cost, dress code, and other information. Location can be concealed and only revealed individually by the Event owner to participants. Users, on an Event's page, can indicate that they \\"will attend\\" or \\"might attend\\". All members have a personal profile. A member may have multiple affiliate profiles, but sockpuppets are against the site's terms of use. There are 12 possible \\"sexual orientation\\" choices, plus \\"Not Applicable\\" and over 60 \\"role\\" choices. The groups the member belongs to and the fetishes the member is \\"into\\" or \\"curious about\\" are displayed as part of the profile. Beyond this, the member may write text that is automatically posted on their profile, with no limitation on length. All profiles are by default visible to all members, though a member can block another member. Members can indicate that they are \\"Friends\\" with another member, and thus receive notification of the Friend's activity (for example, which groups the Friend joins and what posts they make). Confirmation from the proposed Friend is required. Members can also indicate that they are in one or more relationships. A separate menu allows a member to indicate more specifically any D/s (Dominant/submissive) relationships they may be in. Both optionally allow the member to specify someone on their friends list. Members can exchange private messages with any other member. A limited chat function was implemented in 2013, allowing members to chat to others with whom they were friends: this function was discontinued in 2016. In 2020 it became possible to select if one wishes to receive messages from any member or just from followers and friends. Each member can post writings (journal entries, erotica, and notes), photographs, and videos.

This policy has been objected to by users on the basis that censoring posts of sexual assault victims that name predatory users prevents them from warning others. FetLife's reasoning behind this policy is that it allows users to accuse others of a crime, which could be libelous if the allegations are false or unprovable. An account is required to view content on FetLife, although membership is free. The site is not indexed by search engines and, partly because of this, critics have argued that FetLife presents itself as being more private than it is.

His grandfather, also Taylor White, was the founding Treasurer of The Foundling Hospital, a judge, Fellow of The Royal Society, and Patron of the Arts. Wallingwells, Nottinghamshire Prior to inheriting, in 1795, his father’s substantial estates, including Wallingwells, he occupied himself primarily with the army and militia. ==The Raising of The Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry Cavalry and The Grant of Baronetcy== When it appeared that an invasion of England by Napoleon was imminent Thomas twice raised, quartered, fed, clothed and armed a force of volunteers to help defend the nation. King George III heard of these deeds and offered to share half of the cost from his privy purse, as he saw this as too much a burden for a private gentleman to bear. Thomas declined His Majesty’s generous offer, saying that he considered it the duty of every loyal gentleman to assist to the utmost of his means at such a crisis. He was subsequently rewarded by the King with a Baronetcy being conferred upon him on 20 December 1802. Thomas was subsequently known as Sir Thomas White, Bt. of Tuxford and Wallingwells. When the corps was raised, a barrack was erected in Wallingwells Park. Some trees still stand which formed the corners of it. An oak tree is also shown at the side of the drive to Langold, in which a platform was erected. On this a sentry was posted day and night to watch for the lighting of the beacon on Gringley Hill, near Gainsborough, as a signal of the landing of the French. Two horses in the stable were kept constantly saddled, in readiness to send out to assemble the men. When the French camp at Boulogne was broken up and all fear of an invasion was past, the English Government decided to test through some part of the country the popular feeling, and to see whether there would be a general rising of the people. With this object they caused several beacons to be lighted, amongst which was Gringley. The alarm soon spread; the men of Sir Thomas’ regiment assembled at Wallingwells at once, and were marched to Doncaster, the place of rendezvous. Here they learnt that the French had not landed, and after Sir Thomas had treated them to breakfast and given them a guinea apiece - he dismissed them to their homes. The corps raised by Sir Thomas eventually became what is today known as ‘A’ Squadron (Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry Cavalry), The Royal Yeomanry. Sir Thomas was at the same time Colonel of the 3rd Nottinghamshire Militia. ==Army Career== Sir Thomas White's career in the army was documented by the London Gazette as below. {  - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Date !! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Regiment !! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"text-align: left;\\"  Entry -  21 March 1789  4th Regiment of Dragoons  Cornet Thomas Woollaston White to be Lieutenant, vice Robert Wilson -  6 March 1790  4th Regiment of Dragoons  Lieutenant Thomas Woollaston White retires -  19 March 1799  Sherwood Rangers  Thomas Woollaston White, Esq. to be Captain -  17 November 1803  Sherwood Rangers  Sir Thomas Woollaston White, Bart. to be Captain -  24 September 1808  3rd or Retford Regiment of Local Militia  Sir Thomas Woollaston White, Bart. to the Lieutenant-Colonel-Commandant } ==Deputy Lieutenant and High Sheriff of Notthinghamshire== On 23 July 1803 Sir Thomas was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Nottinghamshire.

The republic revolt was put down on 18 July 1906, six months after the revolution had been put down in the cities. The state has been viewed as \\"one of the most impressive examples of progressive peasant politics during the 1905 Revolution\\". One of the republic's founders were the writer and Tolstoyan Sergey Semyonov, from the nearby village of Andreevskoe. ==History== The republic was founded by a group consisting of several teachers, agronomists, activists and peasants (including Semyonov) from Markovo and nearby villages; the group had been meeting in tea rooms and reading-clubs since 1901 to discuss the newspapers from Moscow. After its establishment in several volosts in the Volokolamsk district, it organized peasant rule in what has been described by historian Orlando Figes as a 'sophisticated system'. A Peasant Union was organized, which consituated the political structure of the 'republic'. A 'republican government' was elected, headed by a president – a position held by one of the peasant elders – and it declared alligience to the Peasant Union. In October 1905 a resolution calling for radical reforms of the political system was passed by a general meeting of peasants; in it the peasants declared that would refuse to obey the current authorities, and refuse taxation and army recruitment until its demands were met. Demands included the convocation of a national parliament, universal suffrage with secret ballots for adults, equal civil rights for peasants, progressive taxes, land grants for landless peasants, a free and universal education system, political amnesty and freedom of movement. Once established, local branches were organized in nearby villages, including one in Andreevskoe by Semyonov; these in practice governed the villages during the republic's existence. A control over rents, an implementation and introduction of agronomic measures, a democratization of volost government and 'nationalization' of church schools happened. Meanwhile, the Tsarist government stood powerless as only one police sergeant and no land captain was in the volost, and was therefore unable to put down the increasingly famous and large republic. The peasant republic was written of in American newspapers, and this brought a Chicago professor to Markovo to lend it support.Figes, p. 183–184 As leader of the Peasant Union in his native village Andreevskoe, Semyonov had established two cooperatives, a new village school, an agricultural farming society, a reading club, and even a peasant theatre.Figes, p. 184 The Tsarist authorities tried dissolving the self- proclaimed state by political means, by dismissing the elected volost elder Ryzhkov; the defiant peasants countered this by refusing to elect a successor, and Ryzkhov declared, 'to his sorrow', that he could not give up his power as there was no one to give it to. The autonomous self-proclaimed republic was only destroyed in July 1906, six months after the revolution had been crushed in the cities; Ryzkhov was removed through a police trick, and all the villages of the republic was raided, with its leaders (among them Semyonov) sent to prison in Moscow. The police had been informed that 'the village contained a dangerous revolutionary' by Semyonov's arch-rival in Andreevskoe, chief elder Grigory Maliutin; after two months in prison in Moscow, Semyonov was sent into exile abroad; here, with the financial aid of Tolstoy, he toured the English and French countryside for eighteen months, where, inspired by what he saw, became even more determined to reform the Russian communal system.Figes, p. 233–234 == References Bibliography== * * Category:1905 establishments in the Russian Empire Category:1906 in the Russian Empire Category:1905 Russian Revolution Category:Former republics Category:Political history of Russia Category:States and territories established in 1905 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1906 Category:Moscow Governorate ","title":"Markovo Republic"},{"id":"19247704","text":"Runaway Match or The Runaway Match, or Marriage by Motor (UK title Elopement à la Mode) is a 1903 short silent film consisting of nine shots.

Agnes' brother was Queen Elizabeth I's great Lord Treasurer, Sir William Cecil, 1st Lord Burghley). During the plot, Sir Henry Dudley, a kinsman of the Duke of Northumberland, tried to place Princess Elizabeth on the throne of England, disposing of Mary. Thomas White was an official in the Exchequer. His part in the plot was to have been a minor one whereby he was to have arrange the robbery of the Exchequer to provide finance for the plotters to pay for the army of exiles and mercenaries they were attempting to bring over from the Continent. White became frightened as time went on, and confessed to Cardinal Pole all he knew. The plot was foiled.

The estates were: Cotgrave, Notts., and Preston, Stone, and Kynwadeston, in Somerset. \\"In consideration,\\" so runs the Originalia Roll, 3 and 4 Phil, and Mary, \\"of good and faithful service by our beloved servant, Thomas White, gentleman, in that late conspiracy against us, our crown and dignity attempted not long since by Henry Dudley and his accomplices.\\" Thomas’s wife is called Agnes Cecil throughout this grant.

He was noted as a civil engineer who constructed the military fortifications that protected some of the Confederacy's most important seaports. ==Early life and career== Boggs, son of Archibald & Pamela (Moseley) Boggs, was born in Augusta, Georgia. Comparatively little is known of his early youth, but it is known he studied at the Augusta Academy.Boggs, p. ix. Two of his brothers would also serve in the Confederate Army. They spent their summers at the Sand Hills near what is now Summerville, South Carolina, a popular tourist resort. At the age of twenty in July 1849, he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point as a cadet from Georgia. He graduated four years later among the first five in his class. Among Boggs' classmates were James B. McPherson, Philip H. Sheridan, and John M. Schofield, later Union generals, and John Bell Hood of the Confederate service. On graduation he was brevetted as a second lieutenant and assigned to the Topographical Bureau. He spent some time in the office of the Pacific Railroad Surveys. In 1854 he was transferred to the Ordnance Corps and was made assistant at the Watervliet Arsenal in Troy, New York. In December of the same year he became second lieutenant and in 1856 he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. While at Watervliet Arsenal, on December 19, 1855, he married Mary Sophia, daughter of Col. John Symington, the commandant. To them were born five children-William R., Jr., a mining engineer who was murdered in Mexico in 1907; Elizabeth McCaw, John Symington, Edith Allston, and Henry Patterson Boggs.Boggs, pp. xxii-xxiii. (For some unknown reason a sixth child, Archibald Boggs (1860–1881) was omitted from the biographical data published for General Boggs.) In 1857 Boggs was transferred to the Louisiana Arsenal at Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In 1859 he became inspector of ordnance at Point Isobel, Texas. On December 14, 1859, he took part in an engagement with Cortina's Mexican marauders near Fort Brown, for which he was given honorable mention by General Winfield Scott. Soon after, he was transferred to the Alleghany Arsenal at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to which his father-in-law Colonel Symington had also been assigned.Boggs, p. xi. ==Civil War service== Boggs resigned from the U.S. Army the very day that the Georgia Convention adopted its ordinance of secession.Boggs, p. xii. However, his father-in-law stayed in the Federal service. Early in the war, Boggs was appointed by Governor Joseph E. Brown as the purchasing agent to procure arms, ammunition, and supplies for Georgia's state troops. Later, in the Provisional Confederate Army, Boggs' duties were again as an engineer and ordnance officer, given primarily to staff duty for such officers as Braxton Bragg. He was never given the command of troops in combat, although he commanded all engineers and artillery in Pensacola, Florida. His major accomplishments were to perfect and complete fortifications and supply depots in 1861 (including the defenses of Charleston, South Carolina, and Pensacola); to engineer Kirby Smith's invasion of Kentucky in 1862; and to assist Smith's military administration west of the Mississippi River from 1863 to 1865.Boggs, pp. xii- xiii. In 1862, he was appointed colonel, Chief Engineer of the State of Georgia. In recognition of his efforts in constructing the fortifications that defended Savannah, Georgia, one of the earthworks was named Fort Boggs. During the Kentucky campaign, Colonel Boggs, by then back in the Confederate national service, won the confidence of his superiors. On General Kirby Smith's recommendation, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and became chief of staff under him in the Trans-Mississippi Department in the spring of 1863.Boggs, p. xix. Late in the war, Boggs resigned after a quarrel with Smith. For a short time thereafter, he commanded the District of Louisiana, but was soon superseded by Brig. Gen. Harry T. Hays and he subsequently awaited orders at Shreveport, Louisiana. Early in 1865 he enlisted in an expedition to enter military service in Mexico. Finding that the purpose of its leaders was to fight for Maximilian, rather than Juarez, he withdrew his name and returned to the Confederate army. With the collapse of the Confederate armies in the East, Kirby Smith moved his headquarters to Houston, Texas. The surrender of his army was made by Smith's subordinates, in which General Boggs participated, the parole of Boggs being dated June 9, 1865.Boggs, p. xxi. ==Postbellum career== Boggs in later life After the war, Boggs engaged in the profession of engineering, participating to a great extent in railroad construction in the West. In 1875, he was appointed Professor of Mechanics in the Virginia Polytechnic Institute at Blacksburg, a position he held until a reorganization of the faculty in 1881. One of his colleagues wrote, \\"He was highly valued by his associates as a man of force and culture; was esteemed by the student body as an attractive and honest teacher; by the people of the community as an upright, genial, agreeable gentleman. Politics was alone responsible for his removal.\\"Boggs, p. xxii. The later years of his life were spent in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he died at the age of eighty-two. He was buried in Salem Cemetery.Civil War High Commands One of his nephews, Major Archibald Butt, perished in the sinking of the RMS Titanic.Boggs, p. viii. ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Confederate) ==NotesReferences== * Boggs, William R., Military Reminiscences of Gen.

George Duncan erased a 13-stroke deficit after 36 holes to win his only major title, two strokes ahead of runner-up Sandy Herd, the 1902 champion. Royal Cinque Ports had been planned as the location for the Open Championship in 1915, but in early in that year it was decided that there would be no championships during the remainder of World War I; the next Open Championship after the war would be held at Royal Cinque Ports. Although the war was over in November 1918, it was decided that there would be no championship in 1919. During the war, six of the greens were involved in a scheme to build a rifle range. This raised fears about the state of the course, but in late 1919 it was decided that there would be no difficulty in getting the course ready for the 1920 championship. Qualification for the professionals took place the week before on 23 and 24 June at Burhill and Saint George's Hill in Surrey; the leading 72 players and ties qualified. Abe Mitchell led the field at 139; three tied on the qualifying score of 159 and 74 professionals advanced. The amateurs qualified separately, playing 36 holes on 23 June at Sandwich. Eight places were allotted to the amateurs with Cyril Tolley, the Amateur Champion, given an automatic entry. Prize money was increased sixty percent to £200 with a winner's share of £75; the winner also received a gold medal valued at £25. Herd and Ted Ray, the 1912 winner, shared the first round lead at 72 on Wednesday morning. Both faltered in the afternoon's second round while Abe Mitchell shot a 73 for a 147 to open up a six-stroke lead over Herd and Jim Barnes. Ray was eight back, Len Holland eleven behind, while Duncan was thirteen back after consecutive rounds of 80 for 160. Duncan played himself back into contention with a 71 in the third round on Thursday morning. Mitchell began that round with three bogeys, made a seven at the 5th hole, and finished with an 84. After 54 holes, Holland was at 229 and led by one over Herd and Barnes, with Mitchell, Duncan, and Syd Wingate one behind in fourth. Duncan carded a final round 72 for 303, while Holland and Barnes both shot 79 for a 308 and 309, respectively. Mitchell rebounded with a 76 which left him at 307. Only Herd could match Duncan's score, but he found trouble on the 16th and settled for 305, two strokes back of Duncan. Six-time and defending champion Harry Vardon, age 50, finished at 318, 15 strokes back in a tie for 14th place. Two future champions from the United States, Walter Hagen and Scottish-born Tommy Armour, both made their Open Championship debuts this year and both finished at 329, 26 strokes back in a tie for 53rd. Armour was an amateur at the time. This was the second and final Open Championship held at Royal Cinque Ports, which also hosted in 1909. Further Open Championships at Royal Cinque Ports were planned for 1938 and 1949. In both cases the course was flooded during the previous winter prior and the venue was moved to Royal St George's. Thus, only one of the four Opens planned for Royal Cinque Ports actually took place in the year originally intended. Near the English Channel, the course is directly south of Royal St George's, which became the sole Open venue in southern England in the course rota. An exception was in 1932, when Prince's Golf Club hosted its only Open, won by Gene Sarazen. All three courses are adjacent, with Prince's the furthest north. == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish - align=leftSandy Herd  align=left  1902  72  81  77  75  305  2 -  align=leftTed Ray  align=left  1912  72  83  78  73  306  3 - align=leftJ.H.

Former local Jock Hutchison won his only Open Championship, in a 36-hole playoff over amateur Roger Wethered. It was Hutchison's second and final major title. ==Qualification== Qualifying took place on 20–21 June, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes on the Eden Course and 18 holes on the Old Course; the top 80 and ties qualified. Jock Hutchison led the field on 146; the qualifying score was 161 and 85 players advanced. The entries included an unusually large number of U.S.-based players following a funding-raising campaign by an American golf magazine. On 27 September 1920 Golf Illustrated wrote a letter to the Professional Golfers' Association of America with a suggestion that a team of twelve to twenty American professionals be chosen to play in the British Open, to be financed by popular subscription. At that time no American golfer had won the British Open. The idea was that of James D. Harnett, who worked for the magazine. The PGA of America made a positive reply and the idea was announced in the November 1920 issue. The fund was called the British Open Championship Fund. By the next spring the idea had been firmed-up. A team of 12 would be chosen, who would sail in time to play a warm-up tournament at Gleneagles (the Glasgow Herald 1000 Guinea Tournament) prior to the British Open at St Andrews, two weeks later. The team of 12 was chosen by PGA president George Sargent and PGA secretary Alec Pirie, with the assistance of USGA vice-president Robert Gardner. A team of 11 sailed from New York on the RMS Aquitania on 24 May, together with James Harnett, Harry Hampton deciding at the last minute that he could not travel. The American team was: Jim Barnes, Emmet French, Clarence Hackney, Walter Hagen, Charles Hoffner, Jock Hutchison, Tom Kerrigan, George McLean, Fred McLeod, Bill Mehlhorn, and Wilfrid Reid. The day before the Glasgow Herald Tournament, a match was played between the Americans and a team of British professionals, the first match between American and British professionals. It was a forerunner of the Ryder Cup matches, which began six years later in 1927. After the Glasgow tournament, most of the American team travelled to St Andrews to practice, however, Walter Hagen and Jock Hutchison played in a tournament at Kinghorn on 14 and 15 June. Hagen had a poor first round and didn't turn up for the second day, while Hutchison scored 74 and 64 and took the £50 first prize. The American-based entry was augmented by two other professionals, Jack Burgess and James Douglas Edgar, and some amateurs, including Bobby Jones. All the American-based professionals qualified with the exception of Wilfrid Reid, who scored 163. Two of the amateurs qualified, Bobby Jones and Paul Hunter. ==Venue== {class= !Hole!!Name!!Yards!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards - align=center1Burnalign=center365rowspan=10 align=center10Tenth ^align=center312 - align=center2Dykealign=center402align=center11High (In)align=center148 - align=center3Cartgate (Out)align=center353align=center12Heathery (In)align=center318 - align=center4Ginger Beeralign=center417align=center13Hole O'Cross (In)align=center413 - align=center5Hole O'Cross (Out)align=center533align=center14Longalign=center516 - align=center6Heathery (Out)align=center370align=center15Cartgate (In)align=center395 - align=center7High (Out)align=center345align=center16Corner of the Dykealign=center338 - align=center8Shortalign=center142align=center17Roadalign=center456 - align=center9Endalign=center303align=center18Tom Morrisalign=center361 -  colspan=2 align=centerOutalign=center3,230 colspan=2 align=centerInalign=center3,257 - colspan=4Source: colspan=2 align=centerTotalalign=center6,487 } ^ The 10th hole was posthumously named for Bobby Jones in 1972. ==Details== During the first round on Thursday morning, Hutchison made a hole-in-one at the 8th and then drove the green at the par-4 9th, his ball settling inches from the hole. He finished with a round of 72 and a two-shot lead, and continued to lead after 36 holes at 147, a shot ahead of Jim Barnes and Ted Ray. In the two-day format, there was no cut after 36 holes. After the third round on Friday morning, Hutchison trailed Barnes and Sandy Herd by four shots, but both co- leaders shot 80 in the final round and fell into a tie for sixth with five others. Wethered, a student at Oxford, carded 71 to finish at 296, while Hutchison shot 70 to tie and force a Saturday playoff. ==Playoff== Wethered almost did not make it to the playoff, as he was scheduled to play for his cricket team that day and had to be persuaded to stay and play golf. In the playoff, the first two holes were halved before Hutchison gained two shots at the 3rd. However he played a poor 4th hole and took six to make the match all square again. Hutchison took a grip on the match by scoring four threes from the 7th to the 10th while Wethered took four fours. At lunch, Hutchison held a three shot lead. In the afternoon, Hutchison struggled at the first three holes but managed to halve the holes with Wethered. The match then turned decisively with Wethered taking six at the 4th and Hutchison taking threes at the 5th and 6th. Wethered dropped another shot at the 7th and now Hutchison was nine strokes ahead. Hutchison was in trouble at the 11th and took five but Wethered three-putted and only gained one stroke. Thereafter, Hutchison's lead increased to twelve before his cautious play at the final holes reduced the lead to nine. Although a native of St Andrews, Hutchison had become a U.S. citizen and was credited as being the Open's first American champion. The Times reported under the headline \\"Cup Goes to U.S.A.\\" that \\"our Open Championship goes for the first time in its history to America.\\" The following year, Hagen became the first U.S.-born winner.

Walter Hagen became the first American-born winner of the Open Championship, one stroke ahead of runners-up Jim Barnes and George Duncan. It was the first of Hagen's four Open Championships and the fourth of his eleven major titles. Qualifying took place on 19–20 June, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at St. George's and 18 holes at the top eighty and ties qualified. Hagen and Joe Kirkwood led the field on 147; the qualifying score was 161 and exactly 80 players advanced. Wednesday was an idle day, which included a driving contest. Hagen, the winner over Barnes in the PGA Championship finals in 1921, was the 36-hole leader at 149, two strokes ahead of Duncan, Barnes, and five-time champion J.H. Taylor. In the two-day format, there was not a cut after 36 holes. In the third round on Friday morning, defending champion Jock Hutchison shot 73 and moved to the lead, one shot ahead of Taylor and Jean Gassiat, and two shots over Hagen and Barnes. Despite a seven on the fourth hole, Hutchison carded a 36 on the front nine of the final round, but a 40 on the final nine led to a 76 and a fourth- place finish in his second and last Open. Hagen and Barnes battled for the championship, but Barnes' 73 was one off Hagen's 72, his lowest round of the championship. Duncan, the 1920 champion, shot an 81 in the third round and fell six strokes back into a tie for tenth, then rebounded with a 69 in the afternoon to climb the leaderboard and tie Barnes for second. Taylor and Gassiat shot high scores in the final round and dropped to sixth and seventh, respectively. For the final time, two members of the Great Triumvirate finished in the top-10 at the Open Championship; Taylor, age 51, finished sixth and six-time champion Harry Vardon, age 52, tied for eighth. The third member, James Braid, missed qualifying on Tuesday by a stroke. == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish - align=leftGeorge Duncan  align=left  1920  76  75  81  69  301  T2 -  align=leftJock Hutchison  align=left  1921  79  74  73  76  302  4 - align=leftJ.H.

Arthur Havers holed a bunker shot on the 72nd hole to win his only major title, one stroke ahead of defending champion Walter Hagen, who won the following year. Under the rotation system then in place, the Open should have been held at Muirfield. However some doubt existed \\"as to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers being desirous of their course being used for the event\\" and the Championship was moved to Troon, the first Open Championship to be played there. Troon hosted the Open for the second time in 1950, the first time the Open had been held in southwest Scotland since 1925 at nearby Prestwick. Qualifying took place on 11–12 June, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes on the New (Portland) Course at Troon Golf Club and 18 holes on Troon Municipal Course number 2 (now called Lochgreen). The top eighty and ties qualified. Albert Tingey Jr., Syd Wingate, and Charles Whitcombe led the field on 146; the qualifying score was 159 and 88 players advanced. Hagen was among the eleven who just qualified on 159, while future champions Jim Barnes (1925) and Gene Sarazen (1932) both scored 160 and missed out by a stroke. After a 75 on Monday, Sarazen was in the first group out on the New Course on Tuesday morning; they had the worst of the rain and wind, and he shot 85. Sarazen, age 21, already a winner of two majors, had won the Daily Dispatch Northern Professional Championship just ten days earlier at Lytham. Six-time champion Harry Vardon was at 163; it was the first time he did not play in an Open in over thirty years. Wednesday was an idle day. In the opening round on Thursday morning, Joe Kirkwood led with 72; after the second round that afternoon, Havers and Charles Whitcombe co-led at 146, with Hagen a stroke back. In the two-day format, there was no cut after 36 holes. Havers carded a third consecutive 73 on Friday morning to carry a two-stroke lead over Hagen into the final round that afternoon. Hagen threatened the lead throughout the round, and when Havers found a bunker on his approach shot at the 18th it appeared as if the door was open for Hagen. Havers, however, chipped in from the bunker to post a 76 for 295. Hagen found the same bunker and needed to hole out to force a 36-hole playoff on Saturday, but his shot narrowly missed and he finished a shot behind Havers. Macdonald Smith finished a stroke behind Hagen in third place. After his win, Havers made a tour of the United States and defeated both Bobby Jones and Gene Sarazen in match play contests. == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish -  align=leftWalter Hagen  align=left  1922  76  71  74  75  296  2 - align=leftGeorge Duncan  align=left  1920  79  75  74  74  302  T6 -  align=leftTed Ray  align=left  1912  79  75  73  77  304  T12 - align=leftSandy Herd  align=left  1902  82  75  74  76  307  T22 - align=leftJ.H.

He was a member of the Evangelical-Augsburg Church in Poland. Wedel came to Warsaw at the beginning of 1845 and began to work with Karol Grohnert, who was an owner of a confectionery store at 12 Piwna Street. The collaboration between them was a success and won them a large group of loyal customers. Soon afterwards, around 1851, Wedel became financially independent and opened his own store at 12 Miodowa Street, and next door, a steam-powered factory making chocolate. His company, E.Wedel would grow into one of the leading confectionery companies in Poland. A year later, he introduced his widely popular \\"karmelki smietankowe\\" (\\"cream caramels\\"); the caramels' success was aided by an advertising campaign in \\"Kurier Warszawski\\" daily newspaper. Another product made popular by Wedel was drinking chocolate. The store was selling over fifty cups a day. As the years passed, more products, under the brands, \\"Brilliant\\" and \\"Dessert\\", were introduced. Wedel married Karolina Wisnowska (1819-1893), daughter of another famous Warsaw confectioner. In 1864, Wedel's son, Emil Albert Fredryk Wedel (1841-1919) returned from an apprenticeship tour of confectioneries in Germany, Switzerland, England, and France, and received a Ph.D. in chemistry (in particular food chemistry). On his return he joined the family business. In 1876, his father gave him the company as a wedding gift on the day of his marriage.

Walter Hagen won the second of his four Open Championships, one stroke ahead of runner-up Ernest Whitcombe. It was the fifth of Hagen's eleven major championships. Two years earlier in 1922, he became the Open's first winner born in the United States. Qualifying took place on 23–24 June, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at Royal Liverpool and 18 holes at Formby, and the top 80 and ties qualified. J.H. Taylor led the field on 142; Hagen took 83 on the first day at Hoylake and was in some danger of not but after a 73 at Formby for 156 he made it safely through. The qualifying score was 158 and 86 players Six-time champion Harry Vardon had 159 and missed by one stroke. Wednesday was an idle day. In the opening round on Thursday morning, Cyril Tolley, the 1920 British Amateur champion, took the lead with 73, but his 82 in the second round dropped him out of contention. After opening with 77, Whitcombe carded a 70 for 147 for a two-stroke lead over five-time champion J.H. Taylor; Hagen and Macdonald Smith were a stroke back in third In the two-day format, there was not a cut after 36 holes. In the third round on Friday morning, Hagen had 74 and Whitcombe 77, and they shared the 54-hole lead at 224. Three strokes back in a tie for third were George Duncan, Frank Ball, and Smith. In the afternoon, Duncan had 81 for 308 while Ball and Smith both finished on 304, which left Hagen and Whitcombe to battle for the title. Whitcombe shot 43 on the front-nine but responded with a 35 on the back to post 302. Hagen also shot 43 on the front but played his trademark brand of golf on the back. He sliced his second shot on the 12th and his approach shot found a bunker on the 13th, but both times recovered with a pitch and a putt. Hagen sank a downhill 6-footer (1.8 m) on the final hole to win on 301, a one-stroke victory margin. Had the putt not dropped, a 36-hole playoff was in order for Saturday. Smith was three strokes back in a tie for third place, one of twelve times he finished in the top-five of a major championship without a victory. Taylor finished in fifth at the age of 53, thirty years after his first Open title. Gene Sarazen, age 22, played in his first British Open this year and was 41st. He won the championship in 1932 and played in the Open as late as 1976. == Past champions in the field == {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish -  align=leftWalter Hagen  align=left  1922  77  73  74  77  301  1 - align=leftJ.H.

In the final Open at Prestwick, Jim Barnes captured his only Open title, one stroke ahead of runners-up Ted Ray and Archie Compston. It was Barnes' fourth and final major title; he won the first two PGA Championships in 1916 and 1919, and the U.S. Open in 1921. Qualifying took place on 22–23 June. Qualification took place at Troon with 18 holes on the Old Course and 18 holes the Portland Course. The top 80 and ties qualified. The qualifying score was 158 and 83 players qualified. Irishman Moses O'Neill led the qualifiers on 146. Born and raised in Cornwall, England, Barnes opened with a course record 70 to take a four stroke lead as the course was dry and fast. In the second round, Macdonald Smith carded a new course record 69 for the lead at 145, two shots ahead of Barnes, who only managed a 77. Smith followed with a 76 in the third round on Friday morning and took a five-shot lead over Barnes and Compston into the final round. Barnes finished his round early and posted a 74 for a 300 total. Beginning his round after Barnes had already finished his, Smith knew that a round of 78 would win him the championship. But after starting with a 4-3 on the first two holes, he dropped three shots on the next three holes. Smith took a 6 at the 7th and 8th and went out in 42. He found a bunker on the 11th and took a 5, and shot another 6 on the 15th. Smith finished the round with an 82 and a 303 total, good enough only for fourth place. Ted Ray, the 1912 champion, finished tied for second with Compston at 301. Smith's problems in the final round were possibly due to the huge gallery that followed him. Anticipating that he would easily win, 10,000 spectators crowded around Smith, more than the course layout or tournament stewards could handle. Ray's runner- up finish was his final top-ten in a major, as was John Henry Taylor's sixth place showing. Smith never won a major, but was runner-up on three occasions. This was the last of the 24 Opens played at Prestwick, which hosted the first twelve. It was replaced by adjacent Troon Golf Club (\\"Royal Troon\\" since 1978) as the Open venue for southwestern Scotland. Turnberry was added to the rota in 1977, southwest of Prestwick. It was the last Open scheduled for just two days, at 36 holes each. In 1926, the first two rounds were on Wednesday and Thursday, and following a 36-hole cut, the final two rounds were played on Friday. This format was continued through 1965. ==First day leaderboard== Thursday, 25 June 1925 {class= !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score - align=center1  Macdonald Smith   76-69=145 - align=center2  Jim Barnes   70-77=147 - align=center3  Archie Compston   76-75=151 - rowspan=3 align=centerT4  Bill Davies   76-76=152 - Tom Fernie   78-74=152 - Syd Wingate   74-78=152 - rowspan=5 align=centerT7  Duncan McCulloch   76-77=153 - Abe Mitchell   77-76=153 - Ted Ray   77-76=153 - John Henry Taylor   74-79=153 - Jack Smith   75-78=153 } ==Final leaderboard== Source: Friday, 26 June 1925 {class= !Place!!Player!!Country!!Score!!Money - align=center1  Jim Barnes   70-77-79-74=300  align=center£75 - rowspan=2 align=centerT2  Archie Compston   76-75-75-75=301  rowspan=2 align=center£32 10s - Ted Ray   77-76-75-73=301 - align=center4  Macdonald Smith   76-69-76-82=303  align=center£15 - align=center5  Abe Mitchell   77-76-75-77=305  align=center£10 - rowspan=5 align=centerT6  Percy Alliss   77-80-77-76=310  rowspan=5 align=center£7 - Bill Davies   76-76-80-78=310 - Jack Gaudin   78-81-77-74=310 - John Henry Taylor   74-79-80-77=310 - Syd Wingate   74-78-80-78=310 } Amateurs: Harris (311), Cruickshank (315), Tolley (320), Hayward (337) ==References *60th Open - Prestwick 1925 (Official site) *1925 Open Championship (about.sports) Category:The Open Championship Open Championship Open Championship Category:Golf tournaments in Scotland Category:June 1925 sports events ","title":"1925 Open Championship"},{"id":"19247820","text":"Janša is a Slovene surname.

Amateur Bobby Jones won the first of his three Claret Jugs, two strokes ahead of runner-up Al Watrous. Jones was the first amateur to win the title in 29 years, last by Harold Hilton in 1897. Americans finished in the top four spots and it was the fifth victory by an American in six years. This was the first Open Championship in which there was both qualifying and a 36-hole cut. A 36-hole cut had been introduced in 1898 to reduce numbers on the final day. However with an ever increasing number of entries, in 1907 the cut was replaced with a qualification competition. This had continued until 1925, except in 1910–11 when there was again no qualification but a 36-hole cut. To make the cut players would need to be within 14 strokes of the leader after 36 holes. A new rule by the R&A; was also put into place in the 1926 Open Championship; it stated that no competitors would be allowed more than two practice rounds prior to the event. In the past some players had spent weeks on the championship course practicing. This new rule allowed the American players to compete on more equal terms with the British entrants. This was also the first time there was regional qualifying. A southern section played at Sunningdale, a central section at St Annes Old Links and a northern section at Western Gailes. Each section played 36 holes, although for the southern and central sections this took place on two days (16–17 June) while for the northern section it was on just one day (16 June). 49 places (and ties) were allocated to the southern section, 42 places (and ties) to the central section and 10 places (and ties) to the northern section. 55 players qualified from the southern section, 51 from the central section and 11 from the northern section giving a total of 117. Tom Wilson won the northern section with a score of 148. In the southern section Bobby Jones dominated, scoring 134 (66-68) and leading by seven clear strokes. During the two rounds on only one hole did he score more than four, a five at the 10th in his second round. After his first round of 66, The Times reported that \\"the crowd dispersed awe-stricken. They had watched the best round they had ever seen, or ever would see, and what the later players did they neither knew nor cared\\". Walter Hagen led the central section with a score of 143, one of nine Americans qualifying there. Hagen opened with 68 on Wednesday to take the lead, but a 77 in the second round dropped him back to third. In his second Open and already the winner of two U.S. Amateurs and a U.S. Open, Jones played steady golf and carded two rounds of 72 to co-lead with Bill Mehlhorn at the midway point. Hagen was a stroke back and one behind him were Watrous and Fred McLeod. Jones had 73 in the third round on Friday morning, but Watrous shot 69 and took a two-stroke lead after 54 holes. In the final round that afternoon, Jones was still two behind Watrous with five holes to play. After picking up two strokes to forge a tie, Jones hit a wayward drive on 17 which appeared to swing the tournament back to Watrous. However, Jones hit a remarkable recovery shot from the sand dunes onto the green, closer to the hole than Watrous' approach from the fairway. Jones wound up taking the decisive lead in the tournament on this hole after Watrous three-putted. Jones played the tough final 5 holes in 4-3-4-4-4 to post 74 for 291, while Watrous struggled to 78 and 293. Hagen, playing behind Jones and Watrous, had a chance to tie by holing his second shot on the 18th, but his shot rolled past the hole and into a bunker and he settled for third place. Jones, age 24, won his first Open Championship in just his second appearance. His first was five years earlier in 1921 and was less than pleasant: he walked off the Old Course at St Andrews in frustration after taking several shots to get out of a bunker. He went on to win two more Opens; his successful defense in 1927 was back at the Old Course, and his third in 1930 at Royal Liverpool was the second leg of his celebrated grand slam. Its first leg was the 1930 British Amateur, won three weeks Jones' win in 1930 is the last by an amateur. For the first time, an admission fee was charged for spectators. Six-time champion Harry Vardon missed his first cut in the Open Championship at age 56; he had made the cut in every Open he played since 1893. == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish -  align=leftWalter Hagen  align=left  1922, 1924  68  77  74  76  295  T3 - align=leftJ.H.

Amateur Bobby Jones successfully defended the title with a dominating six-stroke victory, the second of his three victories at the Open Championship. The regional qualification that had been used in 1926 was abandoned and the previous system of local qualifying just before the Open was reintroduced. Qualifying was held 11–12 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes on the Old Course and 18 holes on the New Course, and the top 100 and ties qualified. In heavy rain early that flooded the bunkers, Jones shot 76 on Monday at the Old and 71 on Tuesday at the New Course for 147, three strokes behind the low qualifier. Amateur Cyril Tolley led the field with 144; the qualifying score was 160 and 108 players advanced. Prize money was increased £50 to £250, although the winner's share remained at £75. Jones, age 25, returned to St Andrews to make amends for his first experience on the course; six years earlier in 1921, he walked off the Old Course in frustration during the third round. He shot 68 (−5) in the first round on Wednesday, three clear of the rest of the field, and after a second round 72 was at 140 (−6), two shots ahead of Bert Hodson and four clear of Joe Kirkwood Sr. To make the cut, players had to be within fourteen strokes of the leader after 36 holes; it was at 154 (+8) and 54 advanced. On Friday, Hodson ballooned to 81 (+8) in the third round and Jones closed with 73-72 for 285, a new championship record. Aubrey Boomer and Fred Robson tied for second place, six shots back. Future three-time champion Henry Cotton, age 20, made his Open debut and finished in ninth place. Five-time champion J.H.

Walter Hagen won the third of his four Open Championship titles, two strokes ahead of runner-up Gene Sarazen. It was his second triumph at Royal St George's, the site of his first Open win in 1922. It was the tenth of his eleven major titles; his second Open victory came in 1924 at Royal Liverpool. For this year and the next, the Open was played earlier than usual, in early May, and Hagen won both. Qualifying was held on 7–8 May, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at St George's and 18 holes at Prince's, and the top 100 and ties qualified. José Jurado led the qualifiers on 144, which included four Bradbeer brothers: James, Bob, Ernest, and Fred. The qualifying score was 162 and 113 players qualified. Two-time defending champion Bobby Jones decided not to make the trip across the Atlantic this year, meaning all eyes were on other American stars. Two weeks prior, Walter Hagen played a match against Archie Compston and lost badly, 18 & 17. Realizing he needed practice, Hagen resolved to skip the parties for which he had become famous and concentrate on his game. On Wednesday, Bill Mehlhorn opened with 71 to take the lead, with Sarazen a stroke behind. Mehlhorn had a poor 78 on the second day and José Jurado took over the lead on 145.«» Hagen and Sarazen were second on 148 with Mehlhorn and Archie Compston on 149. To make the cut, players would need to be within 14 strokes of the leader after 36 holes; it was at 159 and 52 players advanced. On Friday morning, Hagen took the lead by a stroke from Jurado and Sarazen, two ahead of Compston. Hagen's 72 that afternoon gave him 292 and the victory, two shots ahead of Sarazen. Jurado had a disappointing 80 and dropped into a tie for sixth place. The prizes were presented by the Prince of Wales. Six-time champion Harry Vardon, age 58, made his last cut in the Open Championship and tied for 47th. He qualified for the Open just once more, the following year. == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  Finish -  align=leftWalter Hagen  align=left  1922, 1924  75  73  72  72  292  1 -  align=leftJim Barnes  align=left  1925  81  73  76  71  301  T6 -  align=leftGeorge Duncan  align=left  1920  75  77  78  80  310  T18 -  align=leftTed Ray  align=left  1912  77  78  80  79  314  T33 -  align=leftJames Braid  align=left 1901, 1905, 1906, 1908, 1910  80  79  81  76  316  T41 -  align=leftArnaud Massy  align=left  1907  79  79  79  79  317  T41 - align=leftHarry Vardon  align=left  1896, 1898, 1899, 1903, 1911, 1914  78  79  80  80  317  T47 } Source: === Missed the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  Total -  align=leftArthur Havers  align=left  1920  81  79  160 - align=leftSandy Herd  align=left  1902  82  81  163 } Source: Did not advance past qualifying rounds (Monday & Tuesday): *J.H.

Walter Hagen successfully defended his 1928 title, six strokes ahead of runner-up Johnny Farrell. It was Hagen's fourth win at the Open and his eleventh and final major title. Qualifying was held 6–7 May, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at Muirfield and 18 holes at the number 1 course Gullane, and the top 100 and ties qualified. Leo Diegel led the field with 144; the qualifying score was 162 and 109 players advanced. Percy Alliss held the lead after the first round with a 69, while Leo Diegel matched that score in the second round to take the 36-hole lead. After a first-round 75, defending champion Hagen recorded an Open Championship record 67 in the second round on Thursday and was two back of Diegel. There was a change in the cut rule; players needed to be within fourteen strokes of the leader after 36 holes, but there was to be a minimum of sixty left in the field. The cut was at 157 (+17) and 64 advanced. Windy conditions on Friday caused scores to soar over the final two rounds. Diegel shot 82 in the morning, with Alliss and Abe Mitchell at 76 and 78, respectively. Hagen finished with two rounds of 75 for 292. Diegel was a shot behind runner-up Farrell in third place, while Alliss and Mitchell shared fourth at 300. Hagen, age 36, played the tournament just twice more, in 1933 and 1937, both following Ryder Cup matches in England. Six-time champion Harry Vardon, age 59, qualified for the Open for the final time and missed the cut by three strokes. Similar to 1928, this Open was played earlier than usual, in early May. ==Course== { style=\\"text-align:center; font- size:95%;\\" !Hole!!Yards!!Par!!!!Hole!!Yards!!Par - 14504rowspan=10 E6E8FA;\\" 104594 - 23534113594 - 33804123804 - 41803131283 - 55105144504 - 64504153934 - 71533161933 - 84554175075 - 94834184104 -  Out3,41435 In3,27935 - colspan=2 align=leftSource: colspan=3Total 6,69370 } == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total To par  Finish -  align=leftWalter Hagen  align=left  1922, 1924, 1928  75  67  75  75  292  +12  1 -  align=leftJim Barnes  align=left  1925  71  80  78  74  303  +23  7 -  align=leftArthur Havers  align=left  1920  80  74  76  76  306  +26  11 -  align=leftGeorge Duncan  align=left  1920  78  76  81  76  311  +31  22 -  align=leftTed Ray  align=left  1912  80  76  81  79  316  +36  T39 } Source: === Missed the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftArnaud Massy  align=left  1907  81  77  158  +18 -  align=leftJ.H.

Bobby Jones won his third Open Championship title, two strokes ahead of runners-up Leo Diegel and Macdonald Smith, on his way to the single-season Grand Slam. Qualifying took place on 16–17 June, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at Royal Liverpool and 18 holes at Wallasey, and the top 100 and ties qualified. Archie Compston led the field with 141; the qualifying score was 158 (+14) and 112 players advanced. Prize money was increased sixty percent, from £250 to £400. Jones arrived in Hoylake after winning the British Amateur championship in late May. He opened with 70 on Wednesday, in a tie for the lead with Henry Cotton and Smith. Jones followed with a 72 on Thursday to take a one-stroke lead over Fred Robson after 36 holes. The top 60 and ties would make the cut and qualify for the final 36 holes; it was at 158 (+14) and 61 advanced. Archie Compston's third round score of 68 on Friday morning gave him a one-shot lead over Jones heading to the final round, but he then collapsed with an 82 in the afternoon and finished in sixth. Jones also struggled on the round, but a brilliant bunker shot on the 16th to within inches of the hole helped him card a 75 and a clubhouse lead of 291 (+3). Diegel was tied with Jones after the 13th, but he dropped shots at 14 and 16 and finished two behind. Smith came to the 17th needing to play the final two holes in no worse than six shots to tie Jones, but he missed his putt for a three and tied Diegel for second place. Jones became the first player since John Ball in 1890 to win both the British Amateur and British Open in the same year. Returning to the United States with the first two jewels of the Grand Slam, he completed the feat by winning the U.S. Open in July and the U.S. Amateur in late September at Merion. Jones then retired from competitive golf at age 28 and never played in the Open Championship again; through 2016, he remains the last amateur to win it. Jones' win ended a stretch where American-born golfers won ten consecutive major championships. This is the third longest winning streak in majors for American-born golfers after streaks that ended in 1947 and 1977. Four-time winner and two-time defending champion Walter Hagen did not enter. Arnaud Massy, the 1907 champion, played in his final Open at age 52 and missed the cut by a stroke. ==Course == {class= !Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par - align=center1Coursealign=center415align=center4rowspan=10  align=center10Deealign=center410align=center4 - align=center2Roadalign=center369align=center4 align=center11Alpsalign=center193align=center3 - align=center3Longalign=center480align=center5 align=center12Hilbrealign=center401align=center4 - align=center4Newalign=center158align=center3 align=center13Rushesalign=center160align=center3 - align=center5Telegraphalign=center418align=center4 align=center14Fieldalign=center511align=center5 - align=center6Briarsalign=center383align=center4 align=center15Lakealign=center443align=center4 - align=center7Dowiealign=center200align=center3 align=center16Dunalign=center532align=center5 - align=center8Faralign=center482align=center5 align=center17Royalalign=center394align=center4 - align=center9Punch Bowlalign=center393align=center4 align=center18Standalign=center408align=center4 -  colspan=2 align=centerOutalign=center3,298align=center36 colspan=2 align=centerInalign=center3,452align=center36 - colspan=5Source: colspan=2 align=centerTotalalign=center6,750align=center72 } == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total To par  Finish -  Bobby Jones   1926, 1927  70  72  74  75  291  +3  1 -  align=leftJim Barnes  align=left  1925  71  77  72  77  297  +9  T6 -  align=leftTed Ray  align=left  1912  78  75  76  78  307  +19  T24 } Source: === Missed the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftArnaud Massy  align=left  1907  78  81  159  +15 -  align=leftGeorge Duncan  align=left  1920  85  76  161  +17 } Source: Did not advance past qualifying rounds (Monday & Tuesday): *Arthur Havers (1923) 159, Harry Vardon (1896, 1898, 1899, 1903, 1911, 1914) 160, Sandy Herd (1902), 163, James Braid (1901, 1905, 1906, 1908, 1910), 173.

Her company, Damaged Goods, operates from Brussels since 1994. ==Start as a dancer and choreographer== Stuart moved to New York in 1983 where she studied at New York University. She continued her studies at Movement Research (New York) where she studied several release techniques and was active in the Downtown New York dance scene. In the eighties she worked as a dancer for Nina Martin, Lisa Kraus, Federico Restrepo and Marcus Stern. For five years (1986-1992) she was part of the Randy Warshaw Dance Company. On the invitation of the Klapstuk festival in Leuven (BE) in 1991 she created \\"Disfigure Study\\", her first evening-length performance, which launched her career in Europe. In \\"Disfigure Study\\", Meg Stuart approaches the body as a vulnerable physical entity, one that can be deformed, deconstructed, and displaced but still resonates with meaning.Damaged Goods, Meg Stuart Official biographical page on company website. Retrieved: May 8, 2019. ==Damaged Goods== Interested in devising her own structure, Stuart founded Damaged Goods in Brussels in 1994. Damaged Goods is an open and flexible structure, which makes the production of highly diverse projects and interdisciplinary collaborations possible. Together they have worked on a broad range of projects, ranging from solos such as \\"XXX for Arlene and Colleagues\\" (1995), \\"Soft Wear\\" (2000) and the evening-length solo \\"Hunter\\" (2014) to large-scale choreographies such as \\"Visitors Only\\" (2003), \\"Built to Last\\" (2012) and \\"UNTIL OUR HEARTS STOP\\" (2015). Other projects include video works, installations and site-specific creations. Her work has travelled the international theatre circuit and has also been presented at Documenta X in Kassel (1997), at Manifesta7 in Bolzano (2008) and at PERFORMA09 in New York. Damaged Goods has an ongoing collaboration with Kaaitheater (Brussels) and HAU Hebbel am Ufer (Berlin). Before they also worked together with Schauspielhaus Zürich (2000–2004), Volksbühne am Rosa- Luxemburg-Platz Berlin (2005–2010), Münchner Kammerspiele (2010–2015) and Ruhrtriennale (2015–2017) ==Improvisation and artistic collaboration== Improvisation is an important part of Meg Stuart's practice. She initiated several improvisation projects, such as \\"Crash Landing\\" and \\"Auf den Tisch!\\". In 2016 Stuart hosted City Lights – a continuous gathering in the Berlin HAU Hebbel am Ufer, in collaboration with an all female group of local artists. Stuart strives to develop a new language for every piece in collaboration with artists from different creative disciplines and navigates the tension between dance and theatre. Previous collaborations include works developed with visual artists Gary Hill and Ann Hamilton, and composers such as Hahn Rowe and Brendan Dougherty. Through improvisation, Stuart explores physical and emotional states or the memories of them. Her artistic work is analogous to a constantly shifting identity. It constantly redefines itself while searching for new presentation contexts and territories for dance. ==Teaching== Alongside her work as a choreographer, Stuart regularly teaches workshops and master classes at dance schools, festivals and institutions. In the book Are we here yet? (2nd edition, 2013), she reflects on her practice in conversation with editor Jeroen Peeters and describes the exercises, tasks and narratives that she uses in workshops and the creative process. ==Awards== Meg Stuart and Damaged Goods received the K.U.Leuven Culture Price (2000), the German Theatre prize Der Faust (2006) for her choreography of \\"Replacement\\", the prestigious French Prize for Criticism (2008) for \\"BLESSED\\", a New York Dance and Performance Award (2008), also known as BESSIE Award for her oeuvre, the Flemish Culture Prize (2008) and the Konrad Wolf Preiz 2012. In 2014 Meg Stuart received the Grand Prix de la Danse de Montréal, a prize that is awarded since 2011 to dance artists that contributed greatly to the art of dance. That same year the German Magazine Tanz - Zeitschrift für Ballett, Tanz und Performance crowned her choreographer of the year for her productions \\"Sketches/Notebook\\" and \\"Hunter\\". In 2018, The Venice Biennale awarded Meg Stuart the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement in the category of dance. She receives the prize for her constant developing of new languages and methods for each new creation, in which she keeps on redefining new contexts and territoria for dance.EWC, Choreografe Meg Stuart krijgt Gouden Leeuw in Venetië, in: De Morgen, 17/01/2018Meg Stuart ontvangt Gouden Leeuw, op de website van Kunstenpunt, 17/01/2018The 2018 Lion awards for Dance, op de website van La Biennale di Venezia, 17/01/2018 Meg Stuart/Damaged Goods also received the Deutscher Tanzpreis Award for outstanding performer from Dachverband Tanz Deutschland that year.Aankondiging van de winnaars van de prijzen door Dachverband Tanz Deutschland toegekend in 2018, op de website van Dachverband Tanz Deutschland ==Choreographies/collaborations== *Disfigure Study, 1991 *No Longer Readymade, 1993 *Swallow my yellow smile, 1994 *XXX for Arlene and Colleagues, 1995 *No One is Watching, 1995 *Inside Skin #1 They live in Our Breath, 1996 *Splayed Mind Out, 1997 *Remote, 1997 *appetite, 1999 *Comeback, 1999 *Snapshots, 1999 *I'm all yours, 2000 *Private Room, 2000 *sand table, 2000 *Soft Wear, 2000 *Highway 101, 2000/2001 *Alibi, 2001 *Henry IV, 2002 *Das goldene Zeitalter, 2003 *Visitors Only, 2003 *Forgeries, Love and Other Matters, 2004 *Der Marterphahl, 2005 *REPLACEMENT, 2006 *It's not funny!, 2006 *Blessed, 2007 *Maybe Forever, 2007 *All Together Now, 2008 *Die Massnahme/Mauser, 2008 *Do Animals Cry, 2009 *the fault lines, 2010 *Signs of Affection, 2010 *Off Course, 2010 * Atelier, 2011 *VIOLET, 2011 *Built to Last, 2012 *Sketches/Notebook, 2013 *An evening of solo works, 2013 *Hunter, 2014 *UNTIL OUR HEARTS STOP, 2015 *Inflamável, 2016 *Shown and Told, 2016 *Atelier III, 2017 *Projecting [Space[, 2017 *Celestial Sorrow, 2018 ==Improvisations== *Crash Landing, 1996-1999 *Auf den Tisch!,2005-2011 *Politics of Ecstasy, 2009 *Atelier II, 2012 *City Lights - a continuous gathering, 2016 ==Projects== *Running, 1992 *This is the Show and the Show is Many Things, 1994 *Revisited, 2007 *walk+talk #2, 2008 *Intimate Strangers, Brussels, 2008 *walk+talk #16, 2011 *Intimate Strangers, Ghent, 2011 ==Video works== * Smell the flowers while you can (Johan Grimonprez, 1994-2012, 6 min) * Meg Stuart’s Alibi (Maarten Vanden Abeele, 2001, 24 min)http://www.bozar.be/nl/activities/126628-showingshttp://www.bozar.be/file/1787/download * the invited (Jonathan Inksetter, 2003, 12 min) * Somewhere in between (Pierre Coulibeuf, 2004, 67 min) * The Only Possible City (Meg Stuart, 2008) * I thought I'd never say this (Philipp Hochleichter, 2008, video-installatie) * Inflamável (Meg Stuart, 2016, 16 min) * Study of a Portrait (Meg Stuart, 2016, video-installatie) ==Collaborations== Various projects by Meg Stuart were created in collaboration with dancers and performers, amongst others: * Florence Augendre; * Simone Aughterlony; * Heine Avdal; * Alexander Baczynski- Jenkins; * Milli Bitterli; * Francisco Camacho; * Varinia Canto Vila; * Thomas Conway; * Ugo Dehaes; * Jorge Rodolfo de Hoyos; * Mor Demer; * Christine De Smedt; * Joséphine Evrard; * Davis Freeman; * Eric Grondin; * David Hernandez; * Abraham Hurtado; * Márcio Kerber Canabarro; * Adam Linder; * Antonija Livingstone; * Benoît Lachambre; * Anna MacRae; * Roberto Martínez; * Renan Martins de Oliveira; * Andreas Müller; * Anja Müller; * Kotomi Nishiwaki; * Rachid Ouramdane; * Sonja Pregrad; * Vania Rovisco; * Roger Sala Reyner; * Maria F.

Tommy Armour outlasted José Jurado by a single stroke to win his only Open title, and his third and final major championship. This was the first time Carnoustie hosted the championship. Qualifying took place on 1–2 June, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at Carnoustie and 18 holes at Panmure Golf Club in nearby and the top 100 players and ties qualified. Macdonald Smith led the qualifiers on 141; the qualifying score was 160 and 109 players advanced. Prize money for the championship was increased to £500 with £100 for the champion, £75 for second place, £50 for third, £30 for fourth, £25 for fifth, £20 for sixth and seventh, £15 for eighth and ninth and £10 for the next 15 players. Johnny Farrell, Henry Cotton, and Bill Twine led after the first round on Wednesday at even-par 72. Cotton shared the lead with Jurado after the second round at 147 (+3), with Armour a stroke behind. The top 60 and ties would make the cut; it was at 159 (+15) and 66 players advanced to the final rounds. Cotton slipped back with a 79 in the third round on Friday morning, while Jurado shot 73 to open up a three-shot lead over Smith and Arthur Havers. Farrell and Reg Whitcombe were a stroke back in a tie for fourth and Armour, Percy Alliss, and Gene Sarazen were tied for sixth. Despite a shaky finish which saw him take eleven strokes on the last two holes, Alliss shot 73 and took the clubhouse lead at 298. Armour surpassed that total after a course-record 71, finishing at 296. Still on the course when Armour finished, Jurado needed a 75 to win the title. After making the turn in 36, he found trouble on the back-nine. Jurado arrived at the 17th needing to finish with fives on the last two holes to tie Armour, but his drive found the burn and he carded a six. Now needing a four on the last, he hit his approach to , but his putt to tie just missed, securing the championship for Armour. Armour, age 36 and a U.S. citizen, played the Open Championship just once more; he returned to Britain to defend his title in 1932 and finished in 17th place.

Gene Sarazen won his only Open title, five strokes ahead of runner-up Sarazen led wire-to-wire to secure the fifth of his seven major championships. Qualifying took place on 6–7 June, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at Prince's and 18 holes at Royal St George's, and the top 100 and ties qualified. Bob Bradbeer led the qualifiers on 141; the qualifying score was 157 and 110 players Sarazen opened with a 70 on Wednesday to take the lead, one stroke ahead of four others. He followed with a 69 for 139 (–5) for a three-stroke lead over Percy Alliss after 36 holes. The top sixty and ties would make the 36-hole cut; it was at 154 (+10) and 64 players advanced. With a 70 in the third round on Friday morning, Sarazen increased his lead to four over Arthur Havers, who shot a course-record A 74 in the final round that afternoon saw Sarazen post an Open record 283 total. Havers, playing well behind Sarazen, needed a 69 to win, but made the turn in 37 and could not close the gap. He could only manage a 76 for 289 and fell to third; Smith shot 71-70 to climb into solo second place at even-par 288. Two weeks later in New York, Sarazen won the U.S. Open and joined Bobby Jones (1926, 1930) as the only two to win both the British Open and U.S. Open in the same year. Subsequent winners of both were Ben Hogan (1953), Lee Trevino (1971), Tom Watson (1982), and Tiger Woods (2000). This was the only Open Championship held at Prince's, just north of Royal St George's, which has since been the only venue in southeastern England to host. == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total To par  Finish -  align=leftArthur Havers  align=left  1923  74  71  68  76  289  +1  3 -  align=leftTommy Armour  align=left  1931  75  70  74  81  300  +12  T17 -  align=leftTed Ray  align=left  1912  75  77  80  79  311  +23  T56 } Source: === Missed the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftGeorge Duncan  align=left  1920  80  80  160  +17 } Source: Did not advance past qualifying rounds (Monday & Tuesday): *Sandy Herd (1902) 161, Harry Vardon (1896, 1898, 1899, 1903, 1911, 1914) 165, James Braid (1901, 1905, 1906, 1908, 1910) 166.

One can approach the property by paddling a kayak or other small, maneuverable boat up the Charles River and turning west near the Medfield State Hospital up a small stream that leads to South End Pond. The passage to South End Pond through Bogastow Brook is even more challenging as it is a small, intermittent tributary that is thick with vegetation. Boat landing is made very difficult by the grasses and other plants that grow tall and thick but, according to the Trustees of Reservations, a \\"successful journey is rewarded by bushwhacking to a 130-foot tree-covered knoll at the south end of the Reservation offering glimpses of the surrounding floodplain.\\" This isolated place is also of interest to birdwatchers.Birding the upper Charles River, Medfield/Sherborn/Millis (virtualbirder.com) Massachusetts Birds:Birding the upper Charles River (surfbirds.com) The reservation is \\"open\\" all year, sunrise to sundown. ==Upper Charles River Valley== The Trustees of Reservations protection on Bridge Island Meadows in its untamed state is a part of a collaborative effort between municipalities, non-profit organizations, and individuals committed to the \\"protection of the natural beauty and environmental value of the Upper Charles River Valley\\" From its source in Hopkinton, Massachusetts until it flows into Boston Harbor, the eighty-five mile long waterway is \\"one of the most beautiful and accessible of America's urban rivers.\\" ==References *The Trustees of Reservations: Bridge Island Meadows Category:The Trustees of Reservations Category:Open space reserves of Massachusetts Category:Protected areas of Norfolk County, Massachusetts Category:Protected areas established in 1974 Category:1974 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"Bridge Island Meadows"},{"id":"19247891","text":"The 1933 Open Championship was the 68th Open Championship, held 5–8 July at the Old Course in St Andrews, Scotland. Denny Shute defeated fellow American Craig Wood by five strokes in a Saturday playoff to win his only Open title, the first of his three major championships. The Ryder Cup was held in late June at Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club in North West England, and the members of the American team played in the championship, similar to four years later in 1937. Qualifying took place on 3–4 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes on the Old Course and 18 holes on the New Course, and the top 100 and ties qualified. Willie Nolan led the qualifiers with 138; the qualifying score was 158 and 117 players qualified. The leading 60 players and ties after 36 holes made the cut to play on the final day. Walter Hagen led after each of the first two rounds and scores of 152 (+6) and better made the cut. In pursuit of his twelfth major title, Hagen opened with 68 to take the lead on He held on to it after 36 holes at 140 on Thursday, but then carded 161 (+15) in the final two rounds and fell out of the top twenty. A group of four players shared the 54-hole lead at 216 (–3) at midday on Friday: Henry Cotton, Abe Mitchell, Syd Easterbrook, and Leo Diegel. Wood began the final round a stroke behind, while Shute was three back at even par. The final round was a disaster for the leaders as Easterbrook shot 77 (+4), while Cotton and Mitchell both carded 79 (+6). Shute and Wood tied for the clubhouse lead with rounds of 73 and 75, respectively. Diegel found the 18th green in two and needed only a two-putt to join the playoff. He left his first putt short, then completely missed the ball on his second attempt. The untimely mistake caused him to miss out on the playoff by a single stroke, as did American Gene Sarazen. In the final round Wood managed to hit a drive at the 5th, but he found a bunker and lost a stroke on the hole. During the playoff, Wood opened with a pair of sixes and was four strokes down after two holes. Shute prevailed over Wood in the 36-hole playoff by five shots. Wood lost playoffs at all four major championships before finally winning one, this loss was the first. He won two majors in 1941 at The Masters and U.S. Open. This was the first playoff at the Open in a dozen years, since 1921, also won by an American at St Andrews; was born in Scotland but became a U.S. citizen the previous year.

Henry Cotton dominated the championship, leading wire-to-wire on his way to a five-stroke win and his first of three Open titles. Qualifying took place on 25–26 June, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at St. George's and 18 holes at Royal Cinque Ports, and the top 100 and ties qualified. George Gadd led the qualifiers on 140; Cotton scored a course record 66 in the first round at Royal St George's and 75 at Royal Cinque Ports to be a shot behind on 141. He was joined on 141 by Jimmy Adams and Percy Alliss. The qualifying score was 152 and 101 players advanced. Cotton opened with 67 on Wednesday to take a three-shot lead over Fred Taggart. Cotton then shot an Open-record 65 in the second round to open up a nine-shot lead over Alf Padgham, while two strokes further back in third were Joe Kirkwood, Denny Shute, and Charles Whitcombe. The top 60 and ties would make the cut and qualify for the final 36 holes; it was at 153 (and better) and 69 advanced. Conditions were tougher on Friday with a stiff breeze blowing. Cotton scored a third round of 72 in the morning and extended his lead to ten shots over Kirkwood. Scottish amateur Jack McLean had seven threes in his outward nine of 31 and finished with a third round 69, the best third round score. Despite his comfortable lead, Cotton suffered from nerves and began to feel the pressure in the final round that afternoon. He made the turn in 40, then dropped three shots on the next three holes. With Sid Brews scoring 71, Cotton needed a last round of 83 to win. Suddenly it appeared as if his victory was in jeopardy. He managed to get up-and-down on the 13th and steadied himself on his way to a 79 and 283, five strokes ahead of runner-up Brews. His total tied the championship record set by Gene Sarazen two years earlier. Cotton was the first resident Briton to win the Open Championship since Arthur Havers in 1923. The previous ten had been won by American-born players or residents (Englishman Jim Barnes (1925)). Cotton's win was part of a long period of sustained excellence in the tournament. From 1930 through 1952, he finished in the top-10 in all but one of the Opens he played in. In all, he played in twenty Opens between 1927 and 1958, winning three and finishing in the top-10 in seventeen. Cotton received the Ryle Memorial Medal, awarded to members of the British P.G.A. winning the Open Championship. He was the first recipient since Arthur Havers in 1923. Living in Belgium, Cotton was not eligible for the Tooting Bec Cup awarded to the British P.G.A. member living in Great Britain scoring the lowest round in the Open Championship.

Qualifying took place on 24–25 June, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at Muirfield and 18 holes at the number 1 course -->Gullane, and the top 100 and ties qualified. Defending champion Henry Cotton led the field on 141; the qualifying score was 153 and 109 players advanced. Cotton opened with 68 to take the lead on Wednesday, with Perry a stroke behind. Charles Whitcombe carded his own 68 in the second round and led by three over Cotton and Padgham after 36 holes, with Perry falling five back. The top sixty and ties would make the cut for the final 36 holes; it was at 153 (+9) and 62 advanced. In the third round on Friday morning, it was Perry who caught fire with 67 to move ahead of Cotton and Whitcombe, who shot 76 and 73, respectively. A 72 in the final round that afternoon put Perry at 283, four strokes ahead of runner-up Padgham. Whitcombe finished one back in third, while Cotton had 75 and fell into a tie for seventh at 293. Amateur Lawson Little, the reigning British Amateur champion, shot 69 and climbed into a tie for fourth at 289. Perry's winning total equaled the tournament scoring record. Padgham won the following year at Hoylake. Perry's win was his first in an important professional tournament, and he won just three more times.

Alf Padgham won his only major title, one stroke ahead of runner-up Jimmy Adams. Qualifying was scheduled for 22–23 June, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at Royal Liverpool and 18 holes at Wallasey, and the top 100 and ties qualified. Heavy rain caused the first day's play to be abandoned; a lightning bolt stunned three spectators and a caddy, and the greens were under water, some up to . All the scores were voided; Henry Cotton had completed his round of 67 at Wallasey before play was abandoned. Tuesday proceeded as scheduled and the Monday round was played on Wednesday. Cotton led the qualifiers on 139, having scored 68 at Wallasey on the rearranged day, with Wally Smithers two shots behind on 141; the qualifying score was 155 and 107 players advanced. With the weather delay, the championship began on Thursday and concluded with two rounds on Saturday. After the second round on Friday, Bill Cox and Adams were tied for the lead, with five players a shot back, including Padgham and Henry Cotton. The 36-hole cut was the top sixty and ties; it was at 156 (+8) and 62 advanced. After the third round on Saturday morning, Adams and Cotton shared the lead, with Padgham and Tom Green a stroke behind. In the final round that afternoon, Padgham tied Adams for the lead at the turn. He made a four on the 17th, then made a 15-footer (4.5 m) for a three at the 18th to post a 287 total. Adams stood on the 17th knowing that he needed to play the last two holes in eight strokes to tie Padgham. His approach shot found a greenside bunker, and after he failed to get up-and-down he now needed a three on the 18th. He found the green in two, but his putt lipped out and he finished a stroke behind Padgham. Cotton and Green were still on the course, but neither could mount a charge, giving Padgham the championship. Future four-time Open champion Bobby Locke tied for eighth in his major championship debut. Jim Ferrier, the winner of the PGA Championship in 1947, also played in his first major and finished 44th. Both were among the eleven amateurs to make the cut, with Locke as low amateur. == Past champions in the field == {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftHenry Cotton  align=left  1934  73  72  70  74  289  −7  T3 -  align=leftGene Sarazen  align=left  1932  73  75  70  73  291  −5  T5 -  align=leftAlf Perry  align=left  1935  76  76  80  79  311  +15  T50 -  align=leftArthur Havers  align=left  1923  78  78  80  79  315  +19  60 } Source: All past champions in the field made the cut.

Henry Cotton won the second of his three Open titles, two strokes ahead of runner-up Reg Whitcombe. The Ryder Cup was held in late June at Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club in North West and all the members of the victorious American team played in the championship, creating a star-studded field, similar to four years earlier in 1933. Qualifying took place on 5–6 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes on the Medal Course (the championship course) and 18 holes on the Burnside Course. The number of qualifiers was increased to the top 140 and ties, having previously been the top 100 and ties. Two-time Masters champion Horton Smith led the qualifiers on 138; the qualifying score was 157 and 141 players advanced, and all the American Ryder Cup players qualified comfortably. In the opening round on Wednesday, Ed Dudley took the lead with a 70. Reg Whitcombe led after the first two rounds at two-under 142, with his brother Charles and Dudley two behind on 144, and Cotton was tied for fourth at 146. Only the leading forty players and ties made the 36-hole cut, which was at 153 (+9) and 47 advanced. Previously the top sixty and ties made the cut. The final two rounds on Friday were played in a steady, cold rain. Whitcombe maintained his lead with a third-round 74, two shots ahead of his brother, while Cotton moved up to three behind. The weather proved to be Whitcombe's downfall in the final round; on the 7th tee, his club slipped out of his hands as he was swinging and the ball traveled only . He ended up taking a six and finished with a 76 and 292 total. Cotton did not seem affected by the conditions and arrived at the 18th needing only a six to lead. His approach shot found a greenside bunker, but he was able to get down in five to post a 290 total. Only Charles Whitcombe could catch Cotton, but his 76 and 294 finished four strokes behind in fourth place. The American contingent included Byron Nelson and Sam Snead, both of whom were making their Open Championship debuts. Nelson finished fifth but played the Open just once more, returning in 1955. Snead tied for eleventh and played in four more, winning his next in 1946 at St. Andrews. The non- playing captain of the U.S. Ryder Cup team, four-time Open champion Walter Hagen, tied for 26th place in his final Open appearance at age 44. In his last Open Championship as an amateur, nineteen-year-old Bobby Locke was the only amateur to make the cut and tied for seventeenth. As a professional, he won four times (1949, 1950, 1952, 1957). ==Course== Medal (Championship) Course { class=  - !Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par - 1align=leftCup4014E6E8FA;\\" rowspan=11 10align=leftSouth America4534 - 2align=leftGulley442411align=leftDyke3684 - 3align=leftJockie's Burn346412align=leftSouthward Ho4674 - 4align=leftHillocks430413align=leftWhins1683 - 5align=leftBrae3884 14align=leftSpectacles4735 - 6align=leftLong ^5675 15align=leftLucky Slap4574 - 7align=leftPlantation3894 16align=leftBarry Burn2503 - 8align=leftShort1613 17align=leftIsland4544 - 9align=leftRailway483418align=leftHome5035 -  colspan=2 align=centerOutalign=center3,607align=center36 colspan=2 align=centerInalign=center3,593align=center36 - align=left colspan=4Source: colspan=2 align=centerTotalalign=center7,200align=center72 } ^ The 6th hole was renamed Hogan's Alley in 2003 == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftHenry Cotton  align=left  1934  74  72  73  71  290  +2  1 -  align=leftAlf Padgham  align=left  1936  72  74  76  76  298  +10  T7 -  align=leftDenny Shute  align=left  1933  73  73  76  80  302  +14  14 -  align=leftArthur Havers  align=left  1923  77  75  76  76  308  +20  T17 -  align=leftWalter Hagen  align=left  1922, 1924, 1928, 1929  76  72  80  81  309  +21  T26 } Source: === Missed the cut === {   !Player  Country  Year won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftGene Sarazen  align=left  1932  81  76  157  +13 -  align=leftAlf Perry  align=left  1935  83  76  159  +15 -  align=leftGeorge Duncan  align=left  1920  90  76  166  +22 -  align=leftTed Ray  align=left  1912  87  88  175  +31 } Source: Did not advance past qualifying rounds (Monday & Tuesday): *James Braid (1901, 1905, 1906, 1908, 1910) 161, Sandy Herd (1902) 167.

In terrible weather conditions that caused scores to soar, Reg Whitcombe prevailed by two strokes over runner-up Jimmy Adams to win his only major title. The purse was £500 with a winner's share of £100. It was planned to play the Championship at Royal Cinque Ports in nearby Deal, but abnormally high tides that February caused severe flooding to the course, leaving it like \\"an inland sea several feet deep.\\" The venue was switched to Royal St George's, and Prince's replaced Royal Cinque Ports as the venue for one of the qualifying rounds. Qualifying took place on 4–5 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes at St. George's and 18 holes at Prince's. The number of qualifiers was reduced this year to a maximum of 130, and ties for 130th place did not qualify. John Fallon led the qualifiers on 142; the qualifying score was 157 and 120 players advanced, with none from the United States. Dick Burton, Jack Busson, and Bill Cox shared the 36-hole lead at even par 140, with Whitcombe two strokes back after consecutive rounds of 71. A maximum of 40 players after 36 holes made the cut to play on the final day, and ties for 40th place did not make the cut. It was at 148 (+8) and 37 advanced. In the last two rounds on Friday, the weather turned from challenging to treacherous. Gale force winds ripped apart the large exhibition tent and scattered debris for a mile around. Alf Padgham drove the green on the 11th hole, while Cyril Tolley cleared the water on the 14th only to have the wind blow his ball back into the hazard. Only seven sub-80 scores were recorded in the final round. The leaders suffered terribly in the conditions: Burton finished 78-85, Busson shot 83-80, while Cox went 84-80. Whitcombe's scores of 75-78 were enough to post a 295 total, two ahead of Adams and three clear of defending champion Henry Cotton. == Past champions in the field  Made the cut === {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  R3  R4  Total  To par  Finish -  align=leftHenry Cotton  align=left  1934, 1937  74  73  77  74  298  +18  3 -  align=leftAlf Padgham  align=left  1936  74  72  75  82  303  +23  T4 -  align=leftAlf Perry  align=left  1935  71  74  77  86  308  +28  T15 } Source: === Missed the cut === {  style=\\"text- align:center\\" !Player  Country  Year(s) won  R1  R2  Total  To par -  align=leftJames Braid  align=left 1901, 1905, 1906, 1908, 1910  74  78  152  +12 -  align=leftArthur Havers  align=left  1923  78  79  157  +17 } Source: Did not advance past qualifying rounds (Monday & Tuesday): *George Duncan (1920), 159.

The Occoneechee Council is the largest Boy Scout council in North Carolina and serves Chatham, Cumberland, Durham, Franklin, Granville, Harnett, Lee, Moore, Orange, Vance, Wake and Warren counties. These twelve counties are divided into ten districts. ==Organization== The Council headquarters is located in Raleigh, North Carolina, in the Highwoods Office Complex. Occoneechee Council operates three year-round camping properties, available for use by the units and districts of the Council and non-Scouting groups. The Occoneechee Scout Reservation, which includes Camp Durant and Camp Reeves, is a wilderness property in Moore County. Camp Campbell, a primitive camping facility, is located on Kerr Lake in Virginia. The Council derives its name from the Occaneechi Indian tribe, a band of the Saponi Nation, which lived throughout the North Carolina Piedmont and still maintains a community in Hillsbourough, a town served by the Occoneechee Council. The twelve counties that comprise the Occoneechee Council are divided into ten districts as of 2017. Each district is led by a volunteer District Chairman, a volunteer District Commissioner and a professional District Executive, employed by the Occoneechee Council. The districts of the Occoneechee Council are organized as follows:http://www.ocscouts.org/category/about-us/districts/ *Awahili District: Franklin County, Granville County, Vance County, Warren County, and the eastern Wake County communities of Rolesville, Wendell and Zebulon. *Black River District: Northern Harnett County (including Coats, Angier, Lillington, Kipling) and Southern Wake County (including Garner, Holly Springs, Fuquay- Varina, and Cary east of U.S. Route 1). *Crosswinds District: Western Wake County (including Apex, Morrisville, and Cary west of U.S. Route 1) *Highlander District: Southern Harnett County and northern Cumberland County, including the communities of Spring Lake, Fort Bragg, and northern Fayetteville. *Impeesa District: Central and North Central Wake County, including parts of Raleigh, North Carolina north of I-40 and west of Falls of Neuse Road. *LaFayette District: Eastern Harnett County (including Dunn and Erwin), and most of Cumberland County (including Hope Mills, Stedman and most of Fayetteville) *Mawat District: Durham County. *Neuse River District: East- Central Wake County, including Southeast and East Raleigh, Knightdale, and Wake Forest. *Shakori District: Orange County and northeastern Chatham County (including Fearrington Village and Pittsboro). ==Finance== The Occoneechee Council is a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. The Executive Committee of the Executive Board serves as trustees and officers of the corporation. The annual budget of the Occoneechee Council is $3.5 million. Of this, $1.25 million was raised through the annual Friends of Scouting giving campaign, which, as of 2020, has been replaced with annual membership fees.https://ocscouts.org/annual-program-fee/ The Council also participates in the annual popcorn product sale, which generates $1.5 million to support Scouting programs in the Council. ==CampsCamp Durant=== Camp Durant is the primary summer camping facility of the Occoneechee Council. Camp Durant is a part of the Occoneechee Scout Reservation, a tract in central Moore County, North Carolina. The property straddles the geographic division of the Piedmont and Sandhills regions of North Carolina. Camp Durant operates as a full- service summer camp for the Scouts of the Occoneechee Council during the months of June, July and August. The Council currently offers five weeks of summer camp but will expand as the attendance increases. As a result of the \\"Come with Us and Build Leaders\\" Capital Campaign, the Occoneechee Council has completed a complete renovation of the camp. The hallmark of the campaign is the completion of the 700-seat Grand Lodge Dining Hall. This fully air conditioned dining hall will seat the entire camp population at one setting, and boasts four serving lines and a full-service Trading Post and Grill below. Other facilities improvements include: * Rawls Ecology Center * Blue Cross Blue Shield Activity Field * Simmons Trailblazer Area * C. Harrison Smith Aquatics Center * Charlie Sullivan Order of the Arrow Lodge Building * Preston Health Lodge * Handicrafts Area Camp Durant has fourteen campsites, each divided into two sides. Each campsite also has a shower house, complete with three hot/cold showers and three flushing toilets. These shower houses also allow for electric power during summer camp. The entire camp has also been wired with fiber optic cables, which allows for both wired and wireless highspeed internet connections. ===Camp Reeves=== Situated on the remainder of the Occoneechee Scout Reservation, Camp Reeves provides primitive facilities for unit and district camping. The camp has several large Jamboree-style camping fields, as well as unit campsites and several buildings. Camp Reeves was the original summer camp for the Occoneechee Council after the Moore County property was purchased. ===Camp Campbell=== Camp Campbell is the most primitive of the camping properties operated by the Occoneechee Council. Located on Kerr Lake, in Townsville, Virginia, just north of Henderson, North Carolina, Camp Campbell offers Scouting units access to Kerr Lake. ==Occoneechee Lodge== The Occoneechee Council is the home council of Occoneechee Lodge #104, the local branch of the Order of the Arrow, Scouting's National Honor Society. The Occoneechee Lodge has more than 2,000 members and meets several times a year at Camp Durant for fellowship and service.http://lodge104.net/ ==References *Occoneechee Council *Occoneechee Lodge *Camp Durant Category:Youth organizations based in North Carolina Category:Local councils of the Boy Scouts of America Category:Southern Region (Boy Scouts of America) ","title":"Occoneechee Council"},{"id":"19247971","text":"The 1939 Open Championship was the 74th Open Championship, held 5–7 July at the Old Course in St Andrews, Scotland. Dick Burton won his only major title, two strokes ahead of runner-up Johnny Bulla. The purse was £500 with a winner's share of £100. It was the last Open played for seven years, due to World War II. Qualifying took place on 3–4 July, Monday and Tuesday, with 18 holes on the Old Course and 18 holes on the New Course. As in the previous year, the number of qualifiers was limited to a maximum of 130, and ties for 130th place did not qualify. For the first time a prize of £20 was awarded to the professional with the lowest qualifying score. Amateur Jimmy Bruen led the qualifiers on 138 with Henry Cotton next on 142; the qualifying score was 156 and 129 players advanced. Despite taking an eight at the 14th hole, Bobby Locke opened the championship on Wednesday with a round of 70 (−3), tying Burton for the lead. In the second round on Thursday, Locke again found trouble on 14, and after a ball out of bounds fell out of the lead. The maximum number of players making the cut after 36 holes was increased from 40 to 44, and ties for 44th place did not make the cut. Eleven players tied for 35th place, so only 34 players made the cut. John Fallon was the surprise leader after 54 holes by two shots, but he could not cope with the strong winds and fell back to 3rd place with a final round 79 (+6). Bulla, the only American to make the 36-hole cut, began the final round on Friday afternoon four strokes behind Fallon. At the second hole, he hooked his drive over the parallel 17th fairway and into a railway yard; he finished with a round of even-par 73 and established a clubhouse lead of at even par 292. Burton, setting out just as Bulla was finishing, needed a 72 to win the title and came to the 18th needing a par four. He hit a drive over , pitched to , then holed the birdie putt for a win. The previous three Opens at St Andrews had been won by Americans; Burton was the first Briton to win the Open at the Old Course since 1910, won by James Braid of Scotland. Since Burton's 1939 win, the sole British winner at St Andrews was Nick Faldo of England in 1990. Burton enlisted in the Royal Air Force shortly after his win. This was the last Open for seven years, until 1946; World War II started in September 1939 and the championship was canceled through 1945.

Accent WRC competed in an official capacity, spawning three generations, in the World Rally Championship from 2000 to 2003. After development and testing in 1999, the Hyundai World Rally Team and Motor Sport Developments (MSD) debuted the Accent WRC at the 2000 Swedish Rally. The second evolution, Accent WRC2, featured revised aerodynamics, active front differential, longer suspension travel and improved suspension top mounts, although most of the attention was directed at improving reliability. Like its predecessor's, the car's best result in a WRC event remained a fourth place. The Accent WRC3, featuring new dampers and engine internals among other changes, debuted at the 2002 Tour de Corse. The car, though, in such capable hands across its lifespan as the four-time world champion Juha Kankkunen, ex-Subaru rally-winning and former Group A champion Kenneth Eriksson and former British Rally Champion Alister McRae, albeit the former two in the twilight of their careers, was reasonably competitive at times and showed some promise. Belgian Freddy Loix and 1991 Rally Catalunya winner Armin Schwarz were among the other drivers so long synonymous with life in the works-fettled Accents. Due to budget constraints, the car's development was virtually halted during the 2003 season. In September, Hyundai announced its withdrawal from the WRC.

The Scovegni Chapel was built as a private chapel next to the Eremitani Monastery by the well-to-do Scrovegni family and consecrated in 1305. Between 1304 and 1306 Giotto decorated the inside walls and ceiling of the chapel with a series of frescoes depicting scenes from the Bible, including the Life of Christ series. The works are considered a masterpiece. Both the monastery and the chapel now form part of the Musei Civici di Padova. Giotto is described as a Proto- Renaissance artist, preceding and paving the way for the early Florentine Renaissance painters, breaking the artistic mold of the Byzantine period by introducing naturalism and depth into his work. In the painting Christ's body has been lowered from the cross and laid on the ground surrounded by his grieving family and friends. His head is being held by the Virgin Mary and his feet by Mary Magdelene. Behind them John the Baptist throws his arms wide in despair.

Four were built in the Naval Dockard at Devonport, and two elsewhere; the Acorn was built by contract at Jacobs Pill on the Pembroke River (a private yard founded in the 1870s by Sir Edward Reed), while the Melita was built in the Malta Dockyard, the only substantial ship of the Royal Navy ever to be built in the island. ==ConstructionDesign=== Designed by Nathaniel Barnaby,Winfield (2004), p.296 the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction, the hull was of composite construction; that is, iron keel, frames, stem and stern posts with wooden planking. The entire class were re-classified in November 1884 as sloops before they entered service. ===Propulsion=== Propulsion was provided by a 2-cylinder horizontal compound-expansion steam engine of driving a single screw. This arrangement provided enough power to drive the ships at , although Icarus and Melita recorded 12.5 knots. ===Sail plan=== All the ships of the class were built as barque-rigged vessels, except Icarus, which had no main yards provided, making her a barquentine. ===Armament=== The class was designed and built to carry eight 5-inch 38cwt breech-loading guns,\\"5-inch\\" refers to the calibre of the gun; 38cwt is the weight of the gun in hundredweight. one light gun and eight machine guns. Melita had 40cwt guns instead of 38cwt, and Reindeer had two of her guns removed. ==Construction== All the ships were laid down in 1882-83. While most of the ships were completed relatively quickly, Melita took six years to build. The intention behind building her at Malta was to make use of the substantial workforce at Malta Dockyard who were otherwise (it was felt) unemployed when the Mediterranean Fleet was away. The experiment cost £10,000 more than the British-built versions, and incurred substantial delay; it was not repeated, and Melita remained the only warship of any significant size ever built in Malta for the Royal Navy.Preston (2007), p.178. ==Ships== {  style=\\"text-align:left\\" !NameShip builderLaunchedFate - Devonport Dockyard23 June 1884Boom defence in 1903.

MIT has six schools with an emphasis on social work, community development, and scientific and technological research. MIT was founded in 2008 in response to the expansion in primary and secondary education in Kenya and a lack of corresponding increase in mid-level training colleges and universities. This led to the inability of majority of KCSE school leavers to access training, leading to a huge training gap. The institute offers short, certificate, diploma and advanced diploma courses, and runs consultancy services. The main campus is located at the Machakos-Mombasa road junction. ==AcademicsSchools=== MIT is divided into six schools: * School of Social Work and Community Development * School of Counseling and Psychology * School of Applied and Health Sciences * School of Business Education * School of Computing and Information Technology * School of Teacher Education ===Qualifications for admission=== The minimum qualification for entry to a diploma course is grade KCSE C- or KCE Div. 2 or its equivalent or KCE Div. 3 or the equivalent. Those with bridging courses are considered on individual basis. ===Intake=== The three MIT intakes are in January, May and September. Registration for the distance learning programme is possible throughout the year. Students can register online. ===Mode of study=== Methods of study are: * Full-time (day time): 8.00 am - 6.00 pm, Mon – Fri * Evening classes: 5.30 pm - 7.30 pm, Mon – Fri * Saturday classes: 8.00 am - 4.00 pm * Blocks: April, August and December * Distant learning programme (learning by correspondence) ===Examinations=== Examinations are administered by several examination bodies: * Kenya National Examination Council (KNEC) * Association of Business Managers and Administrators (ABMA UK) * Association of Business Executives (ABE) * Institute of Management of Information Systems (IMIS) * Kenya Accountancy and Secretarial National Examination Board(KASNEB) * Institute of Commercial Management (ICM) * CDAAC * NITA The programmes evaluation and quality assurance is done by Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, Commission for Higher Education, Kenya Methodist University and institutions collaborating with MIT. ===Short courses=== Short courses are organized at the beginning of each year.

Declared a \\"Partial Natural Reserve\\" in 1995, the site also serves as a retreat for five species of bats and is the place of discovery of two species of Coleoptera (beetles). == Description == The total length of this huge complex is approximately , which contains a central hall of length and the Neanderthal fossil site, called the Ossuary Gallery, which is long and wide. In 1994, human remains were found accidentally in the cave. They were initially suspected to be from the Spanish Civil War because Republican fighters used to hide there; however, later analysis shows that the remains actually belong to Neanderthals. === Galería del Osario === The primary gallery of interest at the Sidron cave is the Ossuary Gallery or Tunnel of Bones (Galería del Osario), where the remains of several Neanderthals were found. The Galería del Osario was excavated from 2000 to 2013. The Neanderthal remains were all recovered from a single layer, Stratum III. The associated archaeological assemblage consists of 53 stone tools; nonhuman bones are very scarce. The only other species present of similar size is red deer. The remains of a few small mammals and gastropods were also found. ==Neanderthal finds== Researchers recovered more than 2500 hominin fossil elements from the site. The minimum number of individuals from Sidrón Cave is 13. The age of these remains of three men, three adolescent boys, four women, and three infants has been estimated to about 49,000 years. The fact that the bones are excellently preserved with very limited erosion and no large carnivore tooth marks and the unusual deposition of the bones, mixed into a jumble of gravel and mud, suggests that these Neanderthals did not die in this spot but an exterior location. A number of scenarios of how these \\"members of an extended family\\" might have ended up in a room-sized space, dubbed the Tunnel of Bones included flooding, cave collapse, and disposal by cannibals. Evidence for cannibalism includes \\"the presence of cut marks, flakes, percussion pitting, conchoidal scars, and adhering flakes\\". Projection exists that they were dropped into the cave in a single event via a collapse of nearby fissures above the site or, by influx of storm water. === Samples === {  style=\\"text-align:center; margin: auto; width:92%\\" - ! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"width: 23%; font-size:110%; background:#fcfebe; color:#000000;\\"Lab number !! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"width: 23%; font-size:110%; background:#fcfebe; color:#000000;\\"Material !! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"width: 23%; font-size:110%; background:#fcfebe; color:#000000;\\"Normalized Age !! scope=\\"row\\" style=\\"width: 23%; font-size:110%; background:#fcfebe; color:#000000;\\"Stratum -  OxA-21776  bone  48400 ± 3200  Galeria del Osario III -  Beta-192065  tooth SID-19  40840 ± 1200  Galeria del Osario III -  GifA-99704  Hominid bone SID-00B  49200 ± 2500  Galeria del Osario III -  Beta-192066  Hominid bone SID-20  37300 ± 830  Galeria del Osario III } Source: ===Morphology=== Sidron mandible Morphologically, the El Sidrón humans show a large number of Neanderthal lineage-derived features even though certain traits place the sample at the limits of Neanderthal variation. Integrating the El Sidrón human mandibles into the larger Neanderthal sample reveals a north–south geographic patterning. The cave is in the northern portion, southern Neanderthals show broader faces with increased lower facial heights. ===Ontogeny=== The relatively well-preserved specimen of a juvenile Neanderthal recovered from the Galería del Osario, El Sidrón J1, allowed researchers to study the ontogeny of Neanderthals. By analyzing its dentition, researchers estimate that El Sidrón J1 was between 7 and 8 years old at the time of death. Around 36% of the juvenile specimen's remains was recovered, including key cranial, dental and vertebral column elements. 138 fossil elements were recovered, including 30 dental elements and a complete mandible. Based on the robustness of the specimen, researchers guess that the specimen was likely male. El Sidrón J1 exhibits many traits of delayed maturation. At the time of death, El Sidrón J1's brain was likely not yet fully developed. El Sidrón J1's estimated cranial capacity is , which is around 87% of the average adult Neanderthal cranial capacity (). At a comparable age, typical modern human juveniles reach around 95% of the average adult human cranial capacity. Additionally, the juvenile specimen exhibits an unusual developmental feature; the neurocentral synchondrosis between his thoracic and C1 vertebrae had not yet fused; typically, this fusion occurs around 2 years earlier in modern humans. Other paleoanthropologists like Marcia Ponce de León and Christoph Zollikofer have cautioned to interpret the brain size as sign of delayed maturation, because of the small case number and lack of statistical evidence and Tanya Smith noted that the assumption depends on the accuracy of the tooth's ageMichael Greshko This Neanderthal Child Grew Up Just Like Us. National Geographic, September 21, 2017 ===Archaeogenetics=== Ancient Neanderthal mtDNA was partially sequenced in HVR region for three distinct Neanderthals from El Sidrón cave (441, 1253, and 1351c). Researchers also sequenced the partial nuclear genomes from several individuals from the cave. 1253 and 1351c have the same mutations at position A-911, G-977 in exon 7 of FOXP2 gene, known as the \\"language gene\\", as found in present-day humans.Krause et al., \\"The Derived FOXP2 Variant of Modern Humans Was Shared with Neandertals,\\" Current Biology (2007), In 2017, researchers successfully sequenced DNA from soil samples taken from Stratum III at El Sidrón. They were able to identify Neanderthal mtDNA sequences; the results suggested that the sequenced mtDNA belonged to more than one individual. Neanderthal Y chromosome The first sequencing of the Neanderthal Y chromosome was successfully completed from a specimen from Sidrón Cave. Based on this sample, researchers estimate that Neanderthals diverged from the common human ancestor around 590,000 years ago. The Sidrón Cave Y chromosome had never been identified before from other fossil hominin specimens and is not found in modern humans. The Sidrón Cave Y chromosome coded for several minor histocompatibility antigen genes that differ from that of modern humans. ===Diet=== Recent research investigating the Neanderthals remains recovered from El Sidrón have provided evidence that their diet would have consisted primarily of pine nuts, moss and mushrooms. This is contrasted by evidence from other European locations which point to a more carnivorous diet. == See also == * List of fossil sites * Atapuerca Mountains * Sima de las Palomas ==References * More Cave news solociencia.com * BiologyOnline.com Category:Prehistoric sites in Spain Category:Caves of Spain Category:Stone Age sites in Europe Category:Landforms of Asturias Category:Geography of Asturias Category:Neanderthal sites Category:Paleolithic Europe Category:Bien de Interés Cultural landmarks in Asturias ","title":"Sidrón Cave"},{"id":"19248110","text":"The Stewart Creek Bridge or Bridge L6007 is a stone arch bridge in the Smithville neighborhood of Duluth, Minnesota, United States.
