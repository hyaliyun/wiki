The band played at local colleges, high schools and clubs in New Orleans and surrounding cities and states. They released one 45 single with 2 originals called \\"I'm Gonna Leave You\\" and \\"I Could Have Loved Her\\", which, despite insufficient promotion, has remained a classic garage rock recording. The band originally assembled in 1965 as a group known as the Avantis, and included founding members John D‚ÄôAntoni (bass guitar, backing vocals) Ted Genter (keyboards) Tommy Hardtegen (drums) Mike \\"Mange\\" Mangiapane (lead guitar, backing vocals) Ed \\"Eddie\\" McNamara (rhythm guitar, backing vocals, and Steve Sklamba (lead vocals). Practicing at their homes, the group swapped drummers when Rickey Moore, a journeyman musician who achieved regional notoriety for playing in New Orleans-based bands the Coachmen and later the Zoofs. After graduating from high school (except for Rickey who was younger than the other band members), the band and their manager Steve Montagnet decided to drop the car moniker and rename themselves the Better Half-Dozen, an allusion to the six members that comprised the band. Starting as the opening act for fellow Louisiana group the Basement Wall, the Better Half-Dozen became a popular live attraction in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, with a setlist that included mainly cover versions of the British and other Top 40 hits. In October 1966, Montagnet, who had been promoting live shows through his organization known as Splendor Enterprises, financed the recordings of two original tunes at Cosimo Matassa's studio. The band released their debut single on the U-DOE record label, which featured the original tunes \\"I'm Gonna Leave You\\" and \\"I Could Have Loved Her\\". Despite insignificant coverage and only 500 copies being released, the songs themselves became immensely popular among the teen fanbase when the Better Half-Dozen introduced them into their live repertoire. The explosion of the British Invasion in the mid-sixties had immense effect on garage groups, including the Better Half-Dozen. Commenting on the group's sound, Moore said in an interview \\"in those days, there were basically two types of white bands. There were older-style bands that used horns and brass instruments, and there were more modern-style bands, such as The Beatles. Before the group disbanded in 1968, they recorded two covers: the Yardbirds' \\"Mister, You're a Better Man Than I\\" and the West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band's \\"Transparent Day\\". These covers were never released. Both of the band's released songs are featured on Louisiana Punk Groups from the 60s, Volume 1 and Sixties Archives, Volume 3.

Plot  Giuseppe Garibaldi is a modest librarian in a small town in Piedmont. He loves to read, transmit culture to children, despite the library's lack of funds, and river-fishing. Meanwhile, in Rome are held the elections of the President of the Republic, but political leaders can not reach an agreement. As a result, main party leaders all chose to vote for a historical figure as a protest vote: unintentionally they all end up electing \\"Giuseppe Garibaldi\\". When the vote is confirmed the party leaders are in shock and want to immediately nullify the vote: the only problem is that there is an eligible citizen with that same exact name, so by law he has to become president. That man is Giuseppe Garibaldi, the librarian- fisher. The party leaders want him to resign, but as Giuseppe understands the spreading corruption of Italian politics, he refuses. Once ‚ÄúPeppino‚Äù becomes president, he immediately notices the cruel world of Italian politics. Giuseppe, friend of the people, begins to do many good works, earning the popular support. Meanwhile, the leaders of the political parties try to impeach him. Giuseppe, however, makes a poignant speech to parliament, putting all the politicians and the Italian public itself to ridicule.

The total tax revenues in 2014 amounted to ‚Ç¨2.747 Billion, which represents 34.6% of the Maltese GDP. The main sources of tax revenue were value-added tax, income tax, and social security contributions.  Indirect taxes   Value Added Tax  Value Added Tax is levied at the generic rate of 18% on the supply of goods and services. Reduced rates of 7% and 5% also apply whereas the supply of some goods and services is exempt from value added tax. The reduced rate of 7% applies to certain accommodation services whereas the reduced rate of 5% applies on the supply of electricity, certain confectionery and similar items, certain medical accessories, certain printed matter, certain items which are for the exclusive used of disabled persons, importation of certain works of art, collector's items and antiques, minor repairs of bicycles, shoes and leather goods and clothing and household linen, domestic care services, admission to museums, art exhibitions, concerts and theatres, and usage of sporting facilities. As for the exempt goods and services, some are exempt with credit whereas some are exempt without credit. A supply of good or service is deemed to be exempt with credit if the supplier is able to claim input value added tax incurred when purchasing the relevant good or service himself. Supplies which are exempt with credit include the supply of exports and like transactions, international goods traffic, certain intra-community supplies, international transport and ancillary services, brokers and other intermediaries, certain sea vessels and aircraft, gold to the Central Bank of Malta, certain food, pharmaceutical goods, certain transport, and goods on board of cruise liners. Conversely, those supplies which are exempt but without credit include the supply of certain immovable property, insurance services, credit, banking and other services, cultural and religious services, sports, services related to certain exempt services, services supplied by independent groups, services by non-profit making organisations to their members, lotteries, postal services, health and welfare, education, goods in respect of which the supplier had not qualified for input tax credits, broadcasting and water.  Import Duties  Import duties are payable on the importation of dutiable goods in Malta which were grown, produced or manufactured in a country which is not a Member state of the European Union which are made available for consumption in Malta. The rate of duty is dependent on the type of good and in certain cases, the use thereof and is chargeable on the customs value of the imported goods.  Excise Duty  Excise duty is payable on the production, extraction or importation of certain products from countries which are not Member states of the European Union which are made available for consumption in Malta. The rate of excise duty depends on the type of good which is subject to excise.

Stamp Duty  Revenue stamps were used to pay stamp duty from 1899 to the mid-20th century Stamp duty is payable on policies of insurance and transfers of immovable properties situated in Malta and certain securities. The rate of stamp duty on policies of insurance ranges from 0.1% to 11% whereas the applicable general rates on transfers of immovable properties and securities are 5% and 2% respectively. The duty payable is calculated on the dutiable value of the document or transfer in question and in practice it is paid by the transferee. Certain important exemptions are also provided by law.  Direct taxes  The liability to tax in Malta depends on whether the person deriving the said income is domiciled and ordinarily resident in Malta. Persons who are both domiciled and ordinarily resident in Malta are liable to tax in Malta on all of their income and capital gains.

Built in 1911, the building was originally used as a tied house for the Anheuser-Busch Brewery, which sought to expand its presence in Peoria's large brewing industry. The two-story building has a flatiron shape, a design which took advantage of its triangular lot. Architect Albert Keifer gave the building a Classical Revival design with German Renaissance Revival features. Flatiron buildings were once commonly built in Peoria as a necessity of the city's geography; while downtown Peoria was built on a grid aligned with the Illinois River, its subsequent additions were usually aligned with the cardinal directions, and extensions of streets from the additions into downtown led to the creation of many triangular lots. The Kickapoo Building's lot was created by three of these streets, Main Street and Glendale Avenue from the original downtown and Knoxville from the boundaries of several later additions; while it was not the first building on its triangular lot, it was the first one to take full advantage of the space. Modern commercial development and freeway construction eliminated many of Peoria's diagonal streets downtown, including Knoxville Avenue itself, and took many of its flatiron buildings with it; the Kickapoo Building stands out among the survivors for its decorative commercial storefronts on all three sides. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 31, 2013.

It is a Pennsylvania through truss bridge constructed of steel. The bridge is long and wide. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. It is also part of the \\"Iron and Steel Bridges in Minnesota\\" Multiple Property Nomination. The Minnesota Highway Commission did not have design control over many bridges built in the state in the early 20th century, but they were able to influence the plans via financial incentives. Louis P. Wolff, who also designed Bridge No. 12 in Goodhue County, designed the plans for this bridge, and the city of Cannon Falls sought funding from the state. The state highway commission made some minor changes to the plans before approving them. The Pennsylvania through truss design is relatively uncommon in Minnesota. An August 2014 report on the bridge points out that the bridge is in fair to poor condition and is posted with a weight limit of 5 tons. When the bridge was inspected, the stringers and floorbeams were corroded, the paint was failing, the bridge bearings were frozen in place, and the concrete abutments and wing walls were scaled and cracked.

Design The Peitz 101 was entirely the work of M. Peitz of Rosny-sous-Bois. Without external funding or assistance, he began its construction in 1929. Structurally, it was an all-metal aircraft and was mostly metal-skinned, with the exception of its wings and rear fuselage which were fabric covered. The Peitz 101 had a three-part parasol wing of rectangular plan out to slightly blunted tips and with an aspect ratio of 8. There was no dihedral. Ailerons filled about half the trailing edges. The wings were built around two parallel duralumin spars and had a short-span central section braced to the upper fuselage longerons with a pair of parallel, vertical cabane struts to the spars, reinforced by rearward-sloping struts from the upper longeron to the forward spar. The outer wings were braced with parallel struts from the lower fuselage to the spars at about mid-span. The fuselage of the Peitz 101 was constructed from dural tubes, with four longerons defining its rectangular section. It was skinned with dural sheet over the forward section and with fabric aft. In an early diagram its six-cylinder Anzani radial engine was shrouded within a Townend ring, though in a photograph the ring was not fitted. The passenger's open cockpit was at the centre of gravity, between the two longerons, with the pilot in a similar cockpit close behind; both were fitted with dual control. The rear fixed surfaces were triangular, with the tailplane mounted near the top of the fuselage. It carried elevators which were rectangular apart from a cut-out for rudder movement. The rudder, unlike the elevators, was balanced. The Peitz had a tail skid undercarriage with each wheel on a steel stub axle, hinged on a V-strut from the lower fuselage and with a short vertical elastic shock absorber leg to the forward wing strut This junction was strengthened by extra struts to the forward fuselage and to the top of the forward, vertical cabane strut and by another long strut outwards to the top of the rear wing spar. Development With limited resources and manpower, the construction of the Peitz 101 was slow. In October 1931 it was moved to Orly. The date of its first flight is not known, but test flying, with Brabant as pilot, began in the next few months. It appeared, with Service Technique de l'A√©ronautique approval, in public at Orly in the Pentecost aviation festival in May 1932. The following March it was awaiting tests for its certificat de navagbilit√© at Villacoublay.

ELSA summer law schools are organized like seven-day international schools on certain topics in science domains, guided by ideas which are helpful to youth in their academic, but in business upgrade too. Idea of the project The idea about the project of Sarajevo Summer Law School came from Darko Dizdareviƒá who was Vice President S&C; of ELSA B&H; at the moment of its foundation in 2013. The purpose is to expand the knowledge in the area of law through lectures of recognized experts and to gather students from different countries in Europe to exchange their opinions and to create an effective network. Founders Beside Darko, other founders of Sarajevo Summer Law School are: Nihad Odoba≈°iƒá, Mirza Hebib, Harun I≈°eriƒá, Amina Ma≈°oviƒá, Enida ≈†aƒçiroviƒá, Ana-Maria Paponja, Nasir Muftiƒá, Ajdina Bataloviƒá, Emina Agiƒá, Muhamed Tuliƒá. Main ideas which characterize this project are knowledge expansion of students about certain law theme which is a basis of the entire project, education and progressional upgrade of students who participate in the project, linking, at the same time, students from all over Europe because of networking as the main goal. ELSA summer law schools are held in the summer and gather approximately 40-50 participants. Inspired by this, ELSA B&H; decided to start this unique project, with the aim to give a unique opportunity to law students from B&H; and the other starters across Europe who are going to participate in this project, then to increase the academic standard in B&H; which did not include an opportunity of additional education on this way, and to improve reputation, structure and organization of ELSA B&H.; First Sarajevo Summer Law School In 2014, ELSA Bosnia and Herzegovina organized the first Summer Law School on the topic Media Law and International Standards on Information Access. This school was the first law school of this type organized by students in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The idea for this project was created as a result of the need for a detailed and clear proposal solution of unarranged domain access to information and abuse of media rights to the detriment of conscientious citizens. The school attracted around 40 students from 15 different countries, who had lectures for seven days (7‚Äì14 August) at the School of Economics and Business in Sarajevo. Recognized lecturers and experts such as: MSc Dunja Mijatoviƒá (The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media), MSc Amer D≈æihana (Internews BiH), MSc Kristina ƒÜendiƒá (Internews BiH), Helena Mandiƒá (Communications Regulatory Agency B&H;), DSc Marco Bellezza (Associate at Portolano Cavallo Studio Legale), DSc Oreste Pollicino (Bocconi University) and Anja Gengo (University of Sarajevo) attended. The announcement of the first Sarajevo Summer Law School and promotion of signing a memorandum of cooperation with institutions and non-governmental organizations were reported by many media in B&H; of which is important to mention the state television ÀùTV SarajevoÀù and ÀùHayat TVÀù with contributions in television shows about the school, radio station ÀùAntena SarajevoÀù with a contribution in a radio show and ÀùDnevni AvazÀù as a written media. During the lasting of the seven-day school, the following media were reporting: ÀùAntena SarajevoÀù, ÀùRSG RadioÀù, ÀùKlix.baÀù, ÀùFena TVÀù, ÀùTV SarajevoÀù, ÀùEkskluziva.baÀù, and many web portals of student organizations and civil society organizations. The official websites of all the project partners have set promotional information about the successful realization of the school. Second Sarajevo Summer Law School Bjela≈°nica mountain, Social program, SSLS After the success of the first school, ELSA Bosnia and Herzegovina organized second Summer Law School in July 2015 on the topic \\"Media Law and Role of Media in Armed Conflicts\\". The focus remains on the field of Media Law, since this domain was highlighted as a focus programme of the ELSA International. In the existence and development of free democratic society, media has an important role. Its original role as a mere transmitter of information in modern society is outdated. The formation of public opinion is considerably dependent on both the monitoring of information and its presentation in public. The growing power of media is evident and it reveals series of sensitive questions about legislation, such as freedom of expression, the right to information, the right to privacy, the right to honor and reputation, intellectual property rights, etc. Media law as a contemporary branch of law consolidates a large number of areas of law with radio and television, printed media, Internet and on-line services, various forms of entertainment, advertisements and marketing, as the subject to regulation. The interest of authority in this branch of law is significant since the trust and support of the public are based on transparency and openness of the decision-making process, which is provided by media. The topic of media law is an important and sensitive topic, which is one of the reasons for it being selected as the topic of second Sarajevo Summer Law School. The biggest advantage of virtual communication is reflected in the two-way interactive communication, thus enabling denial of incorrect information. Another inevitable media is social media, a product of web 2.0, which accomplishes a complete democratization of data and information publishing. Nowadays, through social media people have the opportunity to globally affect messages, publish their attitudes, opinions and ideas. Information provided by these sites has had a significant role in activism in recent years. The best example for that is Arab Spring in which these social media were used as the key tool for mobilization, training, forming the opinion and affecting the change. Despite the censorship of media and the fact that the national television was not reporting anything about what was happening, amateur footage of the first riots in Tunisia got on the Internet. Thereby, the whole world was informed about the course of these events, and citizens realized they can turn the power to their advantage. People of the Arab world understood that they are not alone, that there are others going through the same suffering and brutality. Third Sarajevo Summer Law School After the second Sarajevo Summer Law School, in the summer of 2016, the third Sarajevo Summer Law School is going to be organized. This year's summer school topic will be completely different from the topics discussed in the previous two years. This year‚Äôs theme is \\"Freedom of Religion in Europe\\". Freedom of religion is considered by many people and nations to be a fundamental human right. In a country with a state religion, freedom of religion is generally considered to mean that the government permits religious practices of other sects besides the state religion, and does not persecute believers in other faiths.

The film was produced and directed by James Beveridge. The film's French version title is Vers le Nord.  Synopsis  In 1943, Alaska and Canada's north has become of strategic importance when Japanese forces invade and occupy the Aleutian Islands. Both Canadian and American forces are deployed to protect and defend the region in the Aleutian Islands Campaign. The major obstacles to overcome for troops and war materi√©l to reach Alaska are the daunting distances and harsh environment. For more than a century, fur traders, prospectors and indigenous peoples had populated the region but the Klondike Gold Rush and later Nome Gold Rush in Nome, Alaska had brought a stampede of newcomers who started new settlements but left when the gold ran out. In 1942, when war came to the region, a new boom transformed the abandoned settlements as workers were needed to build an overland route to Alaska. U.S. Army engineers along with Canadian workers created the Alaska Highway or ALCAN Highway, carved out of the northern bush and forest to bring American troops and supplies northward. Canada's role was to construct airfields alongside the military highway and send ship convoys to supply the various outposts of the northwest, while Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) patrol bombers and lookouts keep a constant vigil. The Northwest Staging Route built by Canadians was a series of airstrips, airport and radio ranging stations in Alberta, British Columbia and the Yukon. The \\"skyway\\" not only supplied the ongoing construction of the Alaska Highway but also served to ferry American lend-lease aircraft for the Soviet Union Air Forces from the United States to Alaska, and then across the Bering Strait to Siberia. American and Canadian ground and air attacks drove the Japanese out of the Aleutian Islands. The joint military efforts resulted in the Japanese defeat on American soil, changing the Pacific War from a defensive struggle to an offensive against the heart of the Japanese empire. At the threshold of a new age, Canada's north holds great promise, with farmland, forests, mineral deposits and the discovery of oil fields. The frontier can be exploited by air and the new airfields created for military use also can be the means to connect Canada via polar air routes to the rest of the world.

History The organisation was established in 1931 by Abdelhamid Ben Badis, with a leadership consisting largely of middle-class men, most of whom were Arab-speaking schoolteachers. It supported Islamic reformism and was strongly opposed to the marabouts. It opposed assimilation with the French, but did not support independence, instead supporting linguistic nationalism and loyalty to France. Despite this, the French authorities sought to closely control the organisation, eventually leading to it to form alliances with nationalist parties. In 1936 it formed the Algerian Muslim Congress (CMA) alongside the Algerian People's Party and the Federation of Elected Natives.Tachau, p7 When Ben Badis died in 1940, Bachir Ibrahimi became AOMA president.

In the colonies of Australia, the medical men of the day took a slow approach in the adoption of the new science that involved x-rays. Many of the early demonstrations were made by investigators outside the medical field. Upon examination of the initial investigators, several key factors were common. The individuals had already either been experimenting along similar lines to Wilhelm R√∂ntgen with Crookes tubes and such, the physicists or scientists, or were actively associated with electrical work, the electricians, which made them particularly receptive to the technical appeal of the new science of x-rays. Records of the events reveal that among the medical men who witnessed the first images produced as radiographs, a rather small number had any great desire to employ X-rays directly in their own medical practice. After the early investigative work of Thomas Ranken Lyle, William Henry Bragg, Joseph Patrick Slattery, and others, almost all medical men were satisfied with soliciting the services of the external X-ray man when necessity arose for skiagraphs to be produced. As the utilization of x-rays became more acceptable, the involvement of electricians began to decline. As the hospitals started to be equipped with x-ray apparatus and installations under the care of radiologists and radiographers, the medical men began to accept the eventuality of the new technology. Up to this point, the private experimenters and investigators continued to be the initiators of new ideas for the medical profession in this new field. Life and times In 1864, Hancock was born at Dublin, Ireland the son of William John Hancock, an actuary, and Annette Dickson n√©e Bowdler. He attended the University of Glasgow and studied engineering for two years, under the tutelage of James Thomson and William Thomson, who later became Lord Kelvin. On 1 December 1910, Hancock married Ida Helen Lovegrove, daughter of Dr. Thomas Henry and Maude Lovegrove, at St George's Anglican Cathedral in Perth, Western Australia. They did not have children.

His duties were to establish telephone exchanges in Perth and Fremantle. Hancock supervised the construction of telephone equipment between Government House and the office of the Colony Secretary. He installed exchanges in Perth and Fremantle. The Bell and Blake magneto telephone was utilized. The early installation had 17 subscribers.Editor. (24 December 1931). X-Ray Pioneer. The Late Dr. W.

Hancock constructed the telegraph lines that connected Perth to Roebourne, to Broome and Derby, and then to Hall's Creek and Wyndham. In January 1893, a telegraph office was opened at Wyndham. Lines were installed that connected to Kalgoorlie and Marble Bar. The telephone lines encountered difficulties with the native Aboriginal people, from insects that included ants and termites, excessive heat, and bushfires. Iron wire had to be utilized, as the copper wires melted. He supervised all electrical works in Western Australia, including the tramways and installation of submarine cables in the harbors at Fremantle and Bunbury. In 1894, Hancock was appointed government electrical engineer, a position he held until retirement due to poor health in 1922.Moynihan, J. F. (1990).

In 1898, he received an appointment at the Perth Public Hospital as an honorary radiographer. Hancock held the appointment for over 20 years. He worked as an engineer during the day, and contributed his time, X-ray services and equipment, to the public during afternoons and evenings. Some estimate that he performed between 20,000 to 30,000 exposures with this service.

The Ellison community is founded upon a heritage of agriculture, rural acreages and scattered residential neighbourhoods within scenic valley terrain. The settlement name of Ellison was adopted 1 December 1955, and is named after Price Ellison (1852-1932), a stock raiser and wheat grower that settled here in 1876, and at one time owned or controlled 80% of the property in the area. The Ellison Post Office was opened 1 May 1912, with Thomas Clinton as postmaster, and closed 15 May 1920. The geography of Ellison contains many small and rare dryland ecosystems of open, arid grasslands and pine forest savannahs. Streams that support a diversity of animals and plants cross these dry ecosystems. Water is a precious resource and a focus for biodiversity and wildlife corridors. There are three main streams that cross the Ellison area; Scotty Creek, Whelan Creek and Mill Creek. These streams and their tributaries are an important habitat in their own right and drain into spawning streams for kokanee, trout and other fish. Ellison also has aspen and cottonwood ecosystems that are wet islands in a dry landscape. These wetlands act as a sponge and a filter that maintain water quality and help maintain the quantity of water in aquifers and streams.

(2015). Dendronotus niveus. In: MolluscaBase (2015). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species on 2016-01-31. Etymology This species is named from the Latin niveus, meaning snowy white, which refers to the most common colour pattern of this species.  Distribution  This species was described from a specimen collected at 17 m depth at Velikaya Salma Strait, Kandalaksha Bay, White Sea, Russia. Numerous specimens from the White Sea and the Barents Sea to a maximum depth of 156 m are included in the material described. Description Dendronotus niveus has a translucent white, pinkish or beige body which is similar to Dendronotus dalli and white morphs of Dendronotus frondosus with which it has been confused in the past. It has opaque white pigment within the tips of the dorsal appendages and rhinophore sheaths which may disappear in adults. It is distinguished from other Dendronotus species by the branching of the dorsal appendages (cerata), the smooth median tooth of the radula in adults and molecular characters. Diet Dendronotus niveus feeding on Diphasia fallax (Johnston, 1847) were pink in colour but after feeding on Hydrallmania falcata (Linnaeus, 1758) and Sertularia mirabilis (Verrill, 1873) in the laboratory became milky white.

Williams was a leading force in the development of the National Association of Black and White Men Together and the National Task Force on AIDS Prevention.  Biography  Reggie Williams was born on April 29, 1951 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Williams became an X-ray technician and moved to Los Angeles in the 1970s. Williams continued to work at Cedars Sinai Hospital, where he noticed high number of men falling ill to AIDS, formerly known as Gay-Related Immune Disease (GRID). He later moved to San Francisco in the 1980s when the AIDS epidemic was in full effect. In 1985, Williams began organizing in San Francisco to address the AIDS epidemic spreading throughout his community. Williams noticed the efforts aimed at preventing HIV infections were not culturally compatible with black gay men, and other men of color. He began by initiating the National Task Force on AIDS Prevention, (NTFAP), with the help of Steve Feeback, and Phill Wilson. In 1986, Williams was diagnosed HIV positive at the age of 35. Later in life, Williams moved to the Netherlands to avoid the stigma and discrimination towards men with HIV/AIDS. He moved there with his partner, Wolfgang Schreiber. Schreiber was prohibited from entering the United States at the time because of his HIV positive status. The two lived in Amsterdam for five years before AIDS took Williams' life on February 7, 1999, at age 47. February 7 is now celebrated as the National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day.  Activist work  Williams became involved in the National Association of Black and White Men Together (NABWMT) when he first moved to San Francisco in 1981. After being involved with BWMT three years, he began the San Francisco BWMT's AIDS task force in 1984. He invited representatives of many AIDS organizations to his home a week after a presentation held by BWMT. This was the first meeting of the task force where they talked about AIDS-related concerns of gay men of color. Williams, along with other members of NABWMT, began to notice the rapid spread of HIV in communities of color. Alongside the rising infection rates, Williams noticed there were very little HIV preventative services that targeted gay men of color. In 1988, Williams became one of the co-founders of the National Task Force on AIDS Prevention (NTFAP), aiming to create preventative services that are geared toward gay men of color. Williams secured a grant from the CDC to fund the NTFAP. In around 1989-1990, Williams began to create the San Francisco Gay Men of Color Consortium, with the help of Douglas Yaranon, a gay Filipino American, Phill Tingley, a gay Native American, Rodrigo Reyes a gay Latino, and Steve Lew, a gay Chinese American. The Gay Men of Color Consortium developed many projects to help spread awareness and prevention in communities of color.

AEDP was initially developed as a psychotherapy to treat the effects of childhood attachment trauma and abuse. It is recognized as an effective treatment for complex post-traumatic stress disorder, and attachment disturbances in adults. It is further applied to the treatment of eating disorders, to the treatment considerations when working with diverse populations, to couples therapy, and to the treatment of dissociative disorders.

AEDP has its origins in intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy developed by Davanloo and Malan.Lilliengren, P., Johansson, R., Lindqvist, K., Mechler, J., & Andersson, G. (2016). \\"Efficacy of Experiential Dynamic Therapy for Psychiatric Conditions: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials\\". Psychotherapy, 53 (1), 90‚Äì104. AEDP utilizes some methods derived from ISTDP, such as \\"portrayals\\" and \\"the triangle of conflict\\".Jacobs Hendel, Hilary (2018). It's Not Always Depression: Working the Change Triangle to Listen to the Body, Discover Core Emotions, and Connect to Your Authentic Self. New York: Penguin Random House. page 285 and 296. . Ongoing developments in AEDP are derived from the integration of research in the fields of positive affect, change processes, and psychotherapy outcome. as well as clinical and empirical study of AEDP therapist's video-taped sessions. Video-taping psychotherapy sessions is a standard practice for AEDP psychotherapists.Iwakabe, S., Edlin, J., Fosha, D., Nakamura, K. (2018, June). \\"A study on the outcome of Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy: An interim report\\". A Paper presented at the annual meeting of The Society for Psychotherapy Research, Amsterdam, Netherlands.  Overview   Model of psychotherapy  AEDP proposes a theory and method of how psychotherapy can effect a positive change in a client's overall well-being. Among the many processes of change utilized by psychotherapies, AEDP privileges emotion processing, which is a series of steps that changes the quality of emotions that a person experiences, with the guidance of an affirming therapeutic relationship. AEDP is built upon two central premises. The first premise is that disorders of emotion and relationship are rooted in an early childhood history of traumatic emotional states that are not relieved by a caregiver. The second premise assumes transformance strivings, that is, that humans are biologically wired to positively respond to healing interventions, and are wired for psychological resilience. The therapeutic interventions built upon these premises involve identifying and encouraging transformance strivings through therapeutic relationship interventions (such as dyadic affect regulation). Attachment theory informs AEDP's set of interventions that occur through the therapeutic relationship.  Theory of psychopathology and healing  AEDP was developed to provide a corrective emotional experience for what, according to AEDP, is considered to be at the root of almost all psychopathology: that is, an infant/child's experience of prolonged and unendurable emotional/physiological stress, in which recovery could only possible through the assistance of a soothing caregiver. It is in the absence of the caregiver and not necessarily the event itself, which may lead to long-term psychological consequences. Adverse Childhood Experiences studies (ACE)Felitti, Vincent J; Anda, Robert F; et al. (May 1998). \\"Relationship of Childhood Abuse and Household Dysfunction to Many of the Leading Causes of Death in Adults: The Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study\\". American Journal of Preventive Medicine. 14 (4): 245‚Äì258. have demonstrated that early emotional trauma, when untreated or unresolved, can result in the development of attachment disorders, disorders of emotion regulation (which includes depression and anxiety), dissociative disorders, affect phobia, and chronic shame. AEDP is considered \\"non- pathologizing\\" and \\"healing-oriented\\" because, similar to person-centered therapy, AEDP considers symptoms to have developed from the most resourced capacities available to the individual at a given time in their development. This approach to positive change by identifying resiliencies extends into a focus upon the positive emotions that arise in response to a corrective emotional experience. Extrapolating from the research on flourishing, AEDP includes the identification and amplification of positive emotions toward the self and therapist in order to facilitate neuroplastic change. The technique developed by AEDP for this purpose is called metatherapeutic processing.  Comparison to other contemporary psychotherapies  1\\\\. AEDP concurs with the traditional psychoanalytic premise that individuals develop psychopathological symptoms and defenses to ward off painful feelings. However, In line with the humanistic psychology tradition, AEDP does not consider the emergence of defense to be a form of pathology, but considers the defense as the only coping mechanism available to the child. Therefore, as opposed to the psychoanalytic focus upon the interpretation of symptoms, AEDP focuses upon identifying and amplifying the client's psychological resilience. 2\\\\. In contrast to intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy, in which the therapist directly confronts the client's defenses or resistance, the AEDP therapist will explicitly appreciate that the defense was necessary at the time it emerged in the context of the trauma, and will help the client to notice that the defense is no longer necessary. 3\\\\. AEDP and emotion-focused therapy share the treatment goal of healing obstacles to the free expression of emotion. Both consider the healing change to take place in the context of the therapeutic relationship. In the process of therapeutic work with emotional experience, AEDP systematically applies metaprocessing (the reflection upon the experience as it is happening) and explores the attachment-based therapeutic relationship as it is unfolding. 4\\\\. Both prolonged exposure therapy (PE) and AEDP are therapies that were developed to treat PTSD. Both therapies aim to reduce trauma-based fears and to promote the recovery of a client's resilience. Among many differences, an essential difference between the two models is the differing views on the etiology of PTSD and therefore the treatment interventions. AEDP views PTSD as developing following a traumatic event when a person is not socially assisted in the repair of the overwhelmed nervous-system and psychological shock. AEDP therefore employs relational strategies (i.e., dyadic affect regulation) to ensure that emotions remain tolerable and will then assist the client in processing the traumatic experiences. PE assumes adequate emotional engagement is necessary, but does not make this engagement a specific focus of intervention.  Core concepts   Transformance  Transformance is the term used to describe psychological process underlying healing change. Transformance refers to each person's innate drive for growth, self-righting, and healing, and to the predictable sequence of an unfolding change process that AEDP aims to activate and facilitate. The term is aligned with the model's emphasis upon a patient's potential and resilience, as opposed to psychopathology. Transformational experiences are marked by the feeling of vitality, energy and positive affect.  Meta-therapeutic processing  Meta-therapeutic processing is a cornerstone of AEDP methodology. The term was created to describe the therapeutic activity of exploring the experience of change as it is happening (transformation), in order to deepen the experience and to facilitate integration and neuroplasticity. For example, the therapist may ask, \\"What is it like for you to have had this deep emotional experience right now?\\" Meta- therapeutic processing, which psychiatrist and psychoanalyst James Grotstein recognized as a technical innovation by Diana Fosha, was later incorporated into focusing-oriented therapy, a method of psychotherapy originally developed by Eugene Gendlin, whose ideas also influenced Fosha's development of AEDP.  Core emotion  The overall aim of AEDP is to enable one's emotions to be accessible, vitalized, regulated, and unhindered in expression. Emotion is a primary source of information about the environment to the self, and about the self to the self, and is also a primary source of communication about the self to others. Clarity of expression of emotions, and a capacity for attunement to another's emotions, is necessary for social well-being and is essential in order to experience one's emotional life as coherent, adaptive and resilient. Whether in a moment during a session, or within a larger period of growth, emotion processing is what characterizes an AEDP session. Empirical studies demonstrate that AEDP's focus on emotions within the therapeutic relationship is associated with client improvement. Positive affect is a sustained focus of experiential exploration.  Core state  Core state is characterized by the natural emergence of well-being, compassion, self-compassion, wisdom, generosity, and clarity that occurs after a successful completion of emotion processing. Core state is marked by the active creation of a new and coherent life narrative.  Dyadic affect regulation  Informed by attachment research which describes the role of parent-to-infant affect regulation in the development of secure attachment, the therapist's employs dyadic regulation of affect, through prosody of voice and tracking clients emotion tolerance, to assist the client in remaining within a window of tolerance for emotion processing.  Influences informing the model  AEDP integrates insights into how change occurs from the following sources. William James observed that inherent in emotion is its power to drive sudden change. This observation is expanded upon by phenomenological studies of change processes in psychotherapy, and informs the ADEP concept of transformance. They observe that the process of positive change in therapy is not necessarily linear, gradual and protracted, but can also be abrupt and discontinuous, and thereby especially potent. AEDP therapists track and respond to change processes with attention to the possibility of abrupt change, which can bring about a specific set of emotions called tremulous affects.Woody, Jane D. (June 2007). \\"Experiencing Affect‚ÄîTransformation and Healing in Psychotherapy\\". PsycCRITIQUES. 52 (24). Humanistic psychologists such as Carl Rogers, who posit that individuals possess actualizing tendencies, which AEDP defines as the innate drive toward healing, growth and self-righting. AEDP proposes that this drive can and should be activated from the start of therapy. Attachment theory originates in John Bowlby's research which proposes that individuals are biologically driven to form attachment bonds. Attachment theory emphasizes the vital necessity of the formation of a secure attachment relationship between infant and caregiver to ensure the child's successful social, cognitive and emotional development. Attachment theory informs AEDP's emphasis on the importance of co-creating safety and connection in the therapeutic relationship as a prerequisite for subsequent work with difficult emotions. Infant research studies the ways in which caregivers and infants interact to provide affective and physiological regulation to the infant. They have found that this interaction creates affect regulating capacities in the developing brain. It is through this affect regulating interaction that secure attachment bonds are formed. The mutually positive affects associated with this dyadic experience is found to be necessary for optimal brain development. AEDP therapists apply the insights of this research to methods such as dyadic affect regulation and moment-to-moment tracking of emotional changes during a therapy session. Neuroplasticity research has demonstrated that human beings are wired for growth and tend to actively seek growth promoting opportunities. Neuroplasticity informs AEDP's concept of transformance, the proposed wired-in motivation of the mind to heal and repair itself. Metatherapeutic processing is the technique designed to explicitly reinforce (wire-in) positive change as it is occurring. Affective neuroscience research proposes that individuals possess a neurobiological core self. This core self provides continuity of \\"sense of self\\" throughout development and despite change. The development of this core self can become derailed by adverse childhood experiences leading to a range of pathologies in adulthood. AEDP therapists facilitate the development of this core self through its relational interventions leading up to the therapeutic goal of the client's re-creation of a previously fragmented and defeating life narrative into one that is coherent, meaningful, and that includes feelings of pride and agency. Emotion theory and research has contributed the understanding of emotions as serving survival purposes and as hard wired into the brain, nervous system, and body. Emotion research has documented the relationship and mental health problems that can result when one's ability to experience and express one's emotions is compromised. AEDP seeks to reconnect the person to emotions that have been blocked, and with therapist guidance, enable these emotions to be fully experienced and processed. When emotions are freely experienced and well tolerated, each core emotion's adaptive action tendency can come online to inform the clients experiences and behaviors. Positive psychology's research into broaden-and- build theory of positive emotions informs AEDP's attention to processing positive emotions in order to promote psychological resilience and flourishing. Broaden-and-build theory informs AEDP's observation that positive emotions emerge with the resolution of difficult emotions. AEDP completes the healing process by systematically metaprocessing positive emotions, with special attention to those that pertain to the therapeutic interaction. This attention to the positive solidifies neuroplastic healing change.  Map of the transformational process  The map of the transformational process is a systematic guide developed for the therapist to track where the patient is in the flow of emotion processing. Fosha posits that healing change occurs in progressive stages, called state changes, identifiable to the therapist by a patient's emotional and somatic shifts. States correspond to the client's progression from emotions that have been defensively blocked from awareness to the visceral experience of the emotions, and finally the integration of emotions. AEDP therapists are trained to identify the signs of state changes, track moment-to-moment shifts within and between each state, and to apply interventions that facilitate movement through four states and three state transformations, described below. Based on transformational studies, state changes may occur gradually over the course of a session or many sessions, and they may occur suddenly and powerfully.  State 1: \\"Co-establish safety\\"  State 1 is characterized by the client's defence mechanisms designed to protect against feeling painful emotions and acceptance of affirmation and care from the therapist (receptive affective capacity). Psycho-education is important during this phase to help the client view symptoms as evidence of resourcefulness (as opposed to pathological) toward self-protection and in the service of the preservation of attachment relationships. Evidence of the client's resiliency and capacities are highlighted to ensure the client is sufficiently resourced for the work ahead. = Transition from state 1 to state 2: \\"co-creating safety\\" = The first state transformation into State 2 is noted by heralding affects, such as a bodily expression of sadness, or indications, such as curiosity, that the client is experiencing relationship security. Heralding affects cue the therapist that the client is ready for exploration of undefended core emotions, within the dyadic regulating therapeutic relationship.  State 2: \\"Experiential processing and adaptive emotional experience\\"  State 2 is marked by the client's experience of emotion that were defended against in state 1. The AEDP therapist actively intervenes to ensure that the client's new experience of emotion remains tolerable. A core emotional experience will have a pattern of deepening toward affective/somatic/cognitive integration. As the purpose of core emotion is to prepare for action on behalf of oneself or another, the therapist will assist the client to experience the natural somatic expression of emotion (e.g., feeling the senses, bodily expression and nervous system). The therapist's regulated nervous system and regulating capacities, through prosody of voice and comfort or encouragement (dyadic regulation of affect), will assist the client in having a safe and well-regulated experience of emotions that were previously felt as unsafe. Clients and therapists report a sense that the therapy is alive and productive when state 2 work is underway. = Transition from state 2 to state 3: \\"the emergence of resilience\\" = Positive affects (which do not necessary feel 'good', but feel \\"right and true\\") mark the completion of the natural wave of the emotion. Clients may report a sense relief, lightness, and importantly a vitality, which arises from feeling the energy of the emotion to act in adaptive ways on behalf of oneself. AEDP refers to the affects associated with this state as breakthrough affects. To consolidate the experience and to propel the client toward the next stage of transformational change, the AEDP therapist will metaprocess the completed round of core emotion with the client; i.e., the therapist will ask the client to reflect on what it was it like to just have had the emotional experience, and equally important, will ask the client to reflect on what it was like to do so with the therapist. Without meta-therapeutic processing, the client simply has an emotional experience that may or may not lead to emotional healing.  State 3: \\"The metatherapeutic processing of transformational experience\\"  State 3 is devoted to the metatherapeutic processing of what has just occurred in the progression from states 1 to 2 as well as the transitional states. This metatherapeutic processing evokes its own set of transformational affects and is the focus of State 3. Transformational affects of State 3 include mastery affects (pride, joy), healing affects (gratitude, feeling moved), the mourning of the self, for one's suffering and for what was lost to oneself in the trauma, and tremulous affects associated with the somatic experience of a change process, especially if it feel sudden. = Transition from state 3 to state 4: \\"the co-engendering of secure attachment and the positive valuation of the self\\" = The client feels \\"calm and ease.\\" The transformational experience feels actualized and the attachment bond between patient and therapist feels solidified.  State 4: Core state: \\"integration, the truth sense\\"  The AEDP healing sequence is completed with the metatherapeutic processing of the positive emotions that naturally arise following a completion of emotion processing. The result is often a state of clarity and well-being. Core state is characterized by the client reporting a feeling of calm, vitality, a sense of wellbeing, compassion toward self and others, an expanded perspective, and wisdom. Core state involves a coherent reorganized self-narrative. The ability to construct a \\"coherent and cohesive\\" self-narrative is shown to be highly correlated with secure attachment status in adulthood and with emotional resilience. The re-organzied self-narrative is evidence to the therapist that a corrective emotional experience has occurred.  Critiques  Louis Sass warned that the practice of meta-processing, or deepening the patient's awareness of their experience of the therapeutic interaction as it is happening, could escalate anxiety for clients who have \\"schizoid\\" defenses. Sass further referenced William James to support his critique that too much introspection \\"could be counter-productive, serving less to illuminate something than to rob it of its essence.\\" Bliming argued metatherapeutic processing could be too \\"emotionally and experientially direct\\" for a hostile and defended patient.Blimling, G. Paul (2019). \\"Facing the Music: Further Thoughts on Integrating Music into Psychotherapy: Response to Commentaries on: The Effect of Integrating Music Listening With an Attachment- and Affective-Focused Short-Term Psychotherapy in an Individual With Relational Trauma: The Case of 'James'\\". Pragmatic Case Studies in Psychotherapy, Volume 15, Module 2, Article 5, pp. 206‚Äì213. In response to Sass's commentary, Fosha clarified that meta-processing occurs when the client is no longer defended and that the activity of meta-processing is \\"about the experience of experience and experience-near reflection that allows further experience\\", not \\"self-awareness\\" or \\"self-monitoring\\". Bruce Ecker proposed that memory reconsolidation may be the neurological mechanism underlying healing change in AEDP. He posits that it is the juxtaposition of the client's expectations, based upon negative memories \\"locked-in\\" by durable synapses, and the disconfirming present moment experience that re-consolidates memory, leading to neuroplastic change. Ecker suggests that AEDP therapists could enhance the effects of healing change by making this juxtaposition explicit.

Holly Arntzen has been an active participant on the Salish Sea eco-music scene, forming The Wilds Band along with partner Kevin Wright. Arntzen and Wright are the core of the Artist Response Team (ART), an independent production house that specializes in entertainment that educates about ecology. They have generated significant awareness of the Salish Sea through their Voices Of Nature school music programs and a growing movement of Ecomusicology. In 2016 ART produced the first annual Rock The Salish Sea! Tour to seven communities including Victoria, Duncan, Nanaimo, Campbell River, Powell River, North Vancouver and Vancouver. The Wilds performed with large choirs of school children in professional theatre concerts, singing their original eco-rock songs, including Up Your Watershed, Salish Sea, 40 Million Salmon Can't Be Wrong, Waiting For Orca and I Am The Future'.' In 2000 ART produced a CD called Salish Sea, featuring songs about ocean protection, followed two years later by the Salish Sea: Handbook for Educators (K-7). It was given the certification of \\"Provincially Recommended\\" by the British Columba Ministry of Education and has been used by teachers throughout the province. Their program to take the ecological message to children and schools around the Salish Sea is supported by The SHAW Centre of the Salish Sea, Cattle Point Foundation; and Western Washington's Salish Sea Studies Institute, Western Washington University. Arntzen's family is a particularly musical one. In 2006, Gwendoline Records issued a live CD titled 3 Generations in Jazz, featuring Holly's father Lloyd Arntzen along with his two sons and two grandsons, recorded at Vancouver‚Äôs Cellar Jazz Caf√©. Holly performed with her father in the late '70s and early '80s singing traditional jazz and blues at Vancouver venues such as the Hot Jazz Club. She recorded Lloyd's original folk song, Where The Coho Flash Silver in 1979, and sang it at major folk festivals across Canada including the Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary and Winnipeg Folk Festivals. In 2012 the Wilds performed the Coho Song at the Coho Festival in West Vancouver, along with Holly's nephews, Evan Arntzen (clarinet/sax) and Arnt Arntzen (banjo/guitar). Arntzen plays a unique style of dulcimer. She got her first dulcimer in 1975; it was built on Cortes Island, by Klaus Maibauer‚Äîa highly skilled architect, carpenter, furniture builder and craftsman who built his own tools, including a band saw. He only ever made about 16 dulcimers. The early ones in the series were teardrop shaped and had diatonic frets (which is what dulcimers traditionally have.) After playing it for a couple of years, Arntzen requested that Maibauer build one for her that had a slimmer neck (so she could hold it like a guitar) and diatonic frets to allow her to play more complex chords. This resulted in Arntzen's innovative dulcimer style. She plays it with a slide, and many different tunings.

Noyes rose to prominence in 2015 after a guest appearance on The Weeknd's Beauty Behind the Madness album, and contributing lead vocals to Kygo's 2015 track \\"Stay\\", which achieved international success. She has since released the solo EPs Noyes Complaint (2016) and Love Songs From A Lolita (2018). Biography Early life Noyes grew up in Corinth, Mississippi and has a sister named Abby and a brother named Grant. Her mother signed her up for piano lessons at a young age, but she decided the piano wasn't for her. At age 12 she asked for an acoustic guitar and was writing her own songs within a week. Her first composition at age 12 was a song called \\"Bigger\\", which she describes as being \\"about a girl who was really pretty, but didn't think she was pretty, so she was too afraid to kiss anyone. So her lips got so big that they fell off.\\" Her early influences included the likes of The Beatles, Johnny Cash, Elvis Presley, Marvin Gaye and James Brown. She says she hated school, didn't feel like she fit in and \\"didn't really get along with anyone\\", and had no desire to attend college after finishing high school. At age 16 she convinced her parents to allow her to move to Nashville to pursue a career in music. She played open mic nights as often as possible and made connections in the music business. She later moved to Los Angeles in further pursuit of a career in music. Career While still a teenager, Noyes received her big break when she provided vocals for The Weeknd's song, \\"Angel\\" from the Grammy-winning album Beauty Behind The Madness, released in August, 2015. She has said that, as a virtually unknown vocalist, receiving an opportunity to perform with a successful artist such as The Weeknd was \\"amazing\\" and an honour. The Weeknd had no idea she would be singing on the track: \\"I was in the studio with the producer we were both working with, and I was like, 'Hey, let's throw it down. Let's not tell him.' Because you can't really tell people you're going to do something, or else they'll be like, 'No, no, no.' You kinda have to make them think it's more their idea.\\" Ultimately, he loved the song. Later that year she provided the vocals to the song \\"Stay\\" by Kygo. The single achieved Gold status in several countries including the UK, Australia, Italy, New Zealand, and Poland. Of the collaboration she has said, \\"Basically, I wrote the song and sent it to [Kygo], because I wanted someone to do a drop to it, and I loved his drops. And surely enough, he loved it, and did it in three days, and it came out two weeks later.\\" Performing the song live with Kygo in front of large crowds helped Noyes become more comfortable on stage, helping her overcome any fear she may have had. After missing a show due to illness, Noyes was banned by Kygo's manager from performing at his two sold-out Hollywood Bowl shows in October 2016. Award- winning singer Kesha subsequently came to her defense, saying that Noyes was being treated \\"like shit\\".Kesha on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/p/BLkp6TpBK_m/ In 2015, she released \\"Haunted\\" as part of the soundtrack for the film Secret in Their Eyes. In 2016, she released her debut solo single \\"In My Mind\\" from her first EP called Noyes Complaint, as well as providing the vocals to \\"Drowning in Champagne\\" by Yellow Claw. In 2017, she released the single \\"Say It to My Face\\".

Life and career The brothers Ignaz Bing and Adolf Bing were the children of Bela Levi (later Babette Tuchmann) and Saloman Beer Bernard Bing, an Ashkenazi Jewish master dyer in Memmelsdorf, Germany, who went on to become a hops-dealer. In 1863 they founded GBN (Gebruder Bing Nurnberger Metall und Lakierwaren Fabrik) in Nuremberg, also known as BW (Bing Werke).\\"Tales From A Merchant's Life\\" (1915) by Ignaz Bing; this book, along with Bing's two further memoirs, \\"My Family and Friends\\" (1916), and \\"My Travels\\" (1917), was translated into English, collected into one volume, and published in 2013 under the title \\"Tales From My Life: Memoirs of a Merchant and Cave Explorer in Germany 1840-1918\\" Ignaz was the leader of the two brothers. He began with a line of willow baskets and enamel household goods, then hired artisans to design and craft fine art nouveau pewter, copper, and glass tableware. Toy production commenced in 1880 and the company's first teddy bears were released in 1907. By the early 20th century, GBN was the largest toy company in the world, and the Bing factory in Nuremberg was the largest toy factory in the world, producing a variety of goods such as dollhouse furniture and enamelware, tin-litho metal toys, and an extensive catalogue of stationary model steam engines and model trains.Bing ToysSpielzeugmuseum Freinsheim: 1. Bing Museum - Er√∂ffnung 2010 (in German) Non-toy products manufactured by the company included gramophones, a line of recordings called Bingola Records, bicycles, kitchenware, office equipment, and electrical goods.The Bing 'Pigmyphone' toy gramophone held at the British Library The Bing Brothers company employed thousands of workers and engaged in joint business investments with many collateral family members in Nuremberg and the wider environs of Bavaria.History of the Bing factories Bing goods were sold not only in Germany, but also in Great Britain, the United States of America, and Canada. As a prominent Nuremberg industrialist, Ignaz Bing helped to develop the modern concept of annual industry-wide trade shows. For his many services on behalf of his country's economy, he was honoured with the title of Privy Councillor of Commerce (Geheime Kommerzienrat) to the Bavarian Court. Bing wrote poetry and memoirs, loved nature, and liked to explore caves. He discovered a beautiful stalactite cave in 1905 near the town of Streitberg (Wiesenttal). Using his own wealth, he paid for the lighting and development of the cavern gallery as a show cave so that others could tour it; he also personally conducted a tour of the cave for Prince Ludwig of Bavaria. Named after its discoverer, the cavern was called the Bingh√∂hle (Bing Cave) from 1905 until the Nazis took over Germany. Then, because Bing was a Jew, they took control of it from the family, nationalized it, and renamed it the \\"Streitberger Cave\\" after the nearest town. However, in 1945, when the Nazi regime ended, it was renamed the Bingh√∂hle and a settlement was given to the family in recompense for the earlier seizure. The site, now operated by the local municipality, was renovated in 2005 as a show cave and offers beautiful guided walking tours underground featuring lighting technology, including fairytale and birthday tours for children's parties. Bing wrote three autobiographical memoirs, \\"Tales From A Merchant's Life\\" (1915), \\"My Family and Friends\\" (1916), and \\"My Travels\\" (1917). These were collected into one volume, translated into English, and published in 2013 under the title \\"Tales From My Life.\\" These memoirs contain quite a bit of genealogical and sociological information along the way, and Bing's anecdotes have been used as primary research to augment the Geni.com profiles of a number of his family members and to provide historical background to those who study Jewish culture in pre-Nazi Germany. Ignaz Bing died at the age of 78 in Nuremberg. His son, Stephan Bing, took on the role of leadership. Sales declined, however, as antisemitism became a force in Germany under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. in 1933, Bing's grandson, the economist Dr. Rudolf Benario, was among the first three Jews murdered in a Nazi concentration camp, at Dachau. That same year the Bing Works company was liquidated. Stephan Bing fled to England, where he helped to start the British toy company Trix.

Known for his videos on Israel and Jewish Holidays, Lesser has released over a dozen albums, written hundreds of original songs on a wide range of subjects, composed raps about 200 different animals, and created accurate rhyming translations of Pirke Avot, Psalms, and other parts of the Siddur. He continues to perform and speak at events around the world. Biography Early life Lesser grew up in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. He is the son of Raymond Lesser and Susan Wolpert, who co-founded the humor publication Funny Times. His family is culturally Jewish, and he had a bar mitzvah at the Reconstructionist synagogue Kol HaLev. Lesser started rapping at 17 while attending Cleveland Heights High School, and began pursuing music as a career soon after arriving at the University of Oregon in 2004. As a freshman, Lesser connected with a hip hop crew from the Oregon Coast known as ‚Äú4 Trees‚Äù, and together they formed a band that performed around Eugene throughout his college years. During this period Lesser's lyrics were quite political, and he would often rap at rallies and protests, promoting sustainability, calling for social justice, and speaking out strongly against the War in Iraq. It was also around this time that he first began advocating for Israel. During college, Lesser was very liberal, and minimally observant, but still identified as Jewish, and strongly believed the Jewish State had a right to exist. As he became more involved with student activism, he was shocked by the intense anti-Israel sentiments prevalent on campus. In one incident, Lesser signed up for a course called \\"Israel/Palestine\\" and found it to be heavily biased, with the professor announcing that the class should just be renamed \\"Palestine\\". Other Jewish students immediately dropped out, but Lesser finished the semester, because he felt the class needed to have at least one Jewish voice, and ultimately graduated in 2008 with a bachelor's degree in political science. Career During his years at college, Lesser wrote over a hundred songs, and spent his summers traveling the west coast of the United States, performing at various music festivals. He sold thousands of CDs in the parking lots and campgrounds of these events, often wearing a sign inscribed with 31 of his original song titles, labeled \\"Ari's 31 Flavors\\". Lesser would approach groups of strangers, offering free songs which they could select from his menu. Eventually, word of his lyrical abilities made its way back to festival organizers, and Lesser was regularly hired as an MC, rapping and singing, between other acts, at High Sierra, Oregon Country Fair, and many other events. This allowed him to share the stage with more established artists including Slightly Stoopid, Ben Harper and Lauryn Hill. After graduation, Lesser was contacted by Patrick Duff, a Rastafarian activist, and medical marijuana dispensary owner in Los Angeles, CA. Duff had purchased one of Lesser's CDs at a music festival earlier that year, and was struck by Lesser's lyrics. Duff offered to finance a professional studio album, and Lesser agreed to participate, moving from Eugene, OR to Los Angeles, CA in 2008 to work on the project. The album, titled \\"The Hippie\\" was produced by Grammy winning producer Paul Fakhourie, and featured a number of other artists including Bob Marley's drummer Carlton \\"Santa\\" Davis. While recording the album, Lesser resided in Silver Lake at a medical marijuana dispensary known as Liberty Bell Temple. The building also served as a Rastafarian ministry, and there, he was exposed to the Book of Psalms. Lesser related to King David as a songwriter, and began creating rhyming translations of the Psalms. A project which he continues to this day. This work ultimately led him to a deeper interest in Torah and his Jewish roots, and Lesser gradually shifted his focus away from the music industry, towards study, meditation, and prayer. Lesser returned to Cleveland a number of times between 2009 and 2011, recording several acoustic albums with his father, ‚ÄúPsalms of Ascents,‚Äù ‚ÄúFather & Son,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAcoustic Bluegrass‚Äù. During these years, Lesser also began composing raps about animals, and has now written raps on over 200 different species. In 2012, Lesser visited Israel for the first time on a Taglit-Birthright trip, and stayed in the country for nearly a year, studying Torah at Mayanot, in Jerusalem, and Yeshiva Temimei Darech in Safed. Though learning full time, he continued writing songs throughout his stay in Israel, in July of 2012, he recorded his entire spoken word album, \\"Three Weeks\\" in one session on the 17th of Tammuz. While in Safed, Lesser formed a band with his Rosh Yeshivah, Rabbi Shalom Pasternak, of Kabbalah Dream Orchestra. ‚Äù When Lesser returned to the states in late 2012, he became increasingly active on social media. Lesser was relatively unknown in the Jewish community before the release of his YouTube video, ‚ÄúHanukkah Hip Hop‚Äù which garnered 40,000 views in a week. In early 2013, his video ‚ÄúPurim Poetry Slam‚Äù comparing Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Haman received 70,000 views in a matter of days. In the summer of 2013, Lesser returned to Israel to perform at Safed Klezmer Festival. During the trip he collaborated with producer Jeremiah BenZion and recorded the album \\"Tzfat Reggae.\\" In October 2013, he released his music video, \\"Boycott Israel\\". In the song, Lesser responds to the BDS movement, highlighting its double standard, and arguing that those who boycott Israel should also boycott 40 other countries engaged in human rights violations. Lesser used information from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to research the song. The video gained 140,000 views in the first two months, and now has nearly 500,000 views on Lesser‚Äôs YouTube Channel. The song made international news in 2015 in a BBC article discussing the BDS movement. The success of ‚ÄúBoycott Israel‚Äù drew the attention of Los Angeles based advocacy organization StandWithUs who partnered with Lesser, in the summer of 2014, to create the video \\"Hamas\\" which has received over 200,000 views on YouTube. Lesser continues to be active on social media with over 7,000 subscribers on YouTube, and nearly 15,000 followers on facebook. Due to his success on social media, Lesser has risen in popularity within the Jewish community, and especially among Orthodox Jews. In 2016, he appeared in a promotional video for the Jewish outreach organization Oorah entitled \\"Got Five Bucks?\\". Lesser also collaborates with many Jewish artists, and is featured on songs with Gad Elbaz, C Lanzbom, and Lipa Schmeltzer. He has spoken and performed at hundreds of events for Jewish communities around the world, and done shows with Moshav Band, Nissim Black, and Zusha. Personal life Lesser has been a strict vegetarian since 2005, when he was exposed to footage from several slaughterhouses. After beginning his work with Psalms in 2008, Lesser became increasingly observant, and now identifies as a baal teshuva. He took a Nazirite vow in 2009, and still considers himself a Nazir. He attended Chabad yeshivas during his time in Israel and is loosely affiliated with the movement, calling himself ‚ÄúLubavitch\\". In 2014, Lesser and his wife married in Cleveland, OH, eventually settling in Phoenix, Arizona, where their first son was born in 2015. The family moved again 2016, and Lesser currently resides in Beachwood, Ohio with his wife and their three sons.

He moved to Germany to study at Heidelberg University where he obtained a doctorate under Otto Haxel in 1959. The subject of his thesis was determination of carbon isotope fractionation factors. In 1961 Vogel wanted to move back to South Africa, but there being no suitable job available for him he instead moved to the Netherlands and obtained the position of head of the Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory at the University of Groningen. The position had become available after the death of Hessel de Vries. Vogel later became a professor of isotope geology at Groningen. In 1967 Vogel returned to South Africa and set up a laboratory at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Pretoria.

History The council was established on 5 January 1888 as the District Council of Eurelia under the provisions of the District Councils Act 1887. The name of the municipality was changed to Carrieton on 31 May 1894, and was divided into six wards in 1896. In 1923, the municipality covered 491,200 acres, 33 miles in length and 26 miles in breadth. It had consisted of the Hundreds of Bendleby, Eurelia, Eurilpa, McCulloch, O'Laddie, Uroonda, Yalpara and Yanyarrie since 1896, when two earlier additional hundreds (Minburra and Waroonce, together comprising the council's Minburra Ward) were severed. In 1923, it included the towns of Belton, Carrieton, Eurelia and Johnburgh, with 107 of the municipality's 847 residents living in Carrieton. Council chambers for the municipality were built in 1892 in Carrieton. On 10 August 1920, the council office, adjacent to the chambers, burnt down in a catastrophic fire, with the loss of all of the council's records to that date, and the death of the incumbent council clerk. The chambers were saved but the offices were completely gutted. A coronial inquest found that the clerk \\"came to his death...of his own act, but the evidence does not show whether such taking was accidental or incidental.\\" The municipality ceased to exist in March 1997, when it merged with the adjacent District Council of Orroroo to create the District Council of Orroroo Carrieton.

The Bears were members of the Big 12 Conference. They finished the season 7‚Äì6, 3‚Äì6 in Big 12 play to finish in a three-way tie for sixth place.

Scandal In September 2015, following the conviction of former players Sam Ukwuachu and Tevin Elliott of sexual assault, along with allegations against other players, the school commissioned law firm Pepper Hamilton LLP to conduct an independent external investigation regarding the university's handling of sexual violence. In April 2016, former player Shawn Oakman was arrested on sexual assault charges as well. Head coach Art Briles was terminated on May 26, 2016 following the presentation of Pepper Hamilton's report. University President Ken Starr and Athletic Director Ian McCaw also resigned. Former Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe was hired on an interim basis. Following the threat of a lawsuit by Briles for wrongful termination, Baylor provided an out of court settlement. Briles and Baylor are co- defendants in a lawsuit filed by a woman allegedly sexually assaulted by a football player. After Briles' departure, many players announced their intention to transfer including Jarrett Stidham. Seven members of the 2016 recruiting class requested to be released from their National Letter of Intent, and six of the then-seven commits in the 2017 recruiting class decommitted.

Sifuentes was born in Seoul, South Korea and immigrated to Modesto, California in 1992. She currently resides in Chicago, Illinois.  Life and career  Sifuentes attended the University of California, Berkeley in 2008 where she earned her BA in Art and Latin American Studies. She then went to Baltimore, where she earned her Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Fine Art from the Maryland Institute College of Art in 2011, followed by an MFA in fiber and Material Studies from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 2013.  Works  Sifuentes's work had been displayed in various exhibitions, both national and international. She was the 2013 Windgate Museum Intern at the Smithsonian's Archive of American Art and is independently curating an AAA oral history collection on craft. Sifuentes was also a 2012-2013 Curatorial Fellow at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Sifuentes's solo exhibitions included the 2015 A Mend: A Collection of Scraps, shown at Babson College in Massachusetts. In it, Sifuentes represented the labor-entailing jobs that were common for immigrants by collecting scraps of jean from Chicago seamstresses and tailors and sewing them together. Her other exhibitions include U.S. Citizenship Test Sampler, where Sifuentes addresses the sociohistoric role of women and function of noncitizen communities. In this, she hand-sews the 100 civic study questions and answers of the US Naturalization Test.  Protest Banner Lending Library  Sifuentes's Protest Banner Lending Library project was conceived following the 2016 presidential election. At the time, Sifuentes felt unable to attend protests because she had a small child, and unsafe there because she was not, at the time, a US citizen. The library is a space where folks can make banners, but also borrow a banner to be used in protest and then be returned. The project has taken place at the Jane Addams Hull-House Museum in partnership with Gallery 400, Smart Museum, Comfort Station, Chicago Cultural Center, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Handwerker Gallery at Ithaca College, the Johnson Museum of Art, and at the Whitney Museum ‚Äî where she worked with Cauleen Smith as part of the 2017 Whitney Biennial's programming.

Composed of members Nick Middleton and Duncan Smith, The Funk Hunters are recognized on the international dance scene for their future funk sound, which is a mix of old school soul, disco, funk and classic hip hop, deeply cross-pollinated with contemporary electronic dance music. Nick Middleton is a music producer and record label owner and Duncan Smith is a multimedia artist. Together as The Funk Hunters Middleton and Smith tour the world performing a live audio visual show operated simultaneously from four turntables and two mixers.  History  Middleton and Smith met in 2008 while working at the Gulf Islands Film and Television School (GIFTS), a media school located on Galiano Island in the coastal community of British Columbia. The two bonded over their mutual appreciation for both funk and electronic dance music (EDM). Inspired by this musical connection they soon invested in a pair of turntables and began DJing as a duo at local island house parties. Middleton also credits the duo's Gulf Island lifestyle as a big factor in the development of their sound, citing that the rural environment allowed for a freer and broader musical scope while playing for diverse audiences that spanned a few generations. Another influence in The Funk Hunters' development was the annual Shambhala Music Festival in the West Kootenays region of southern British Columbia. Middleton first attended the festival in its formative years and soon began bringing Smith along with him. Shambhala was Smith and Middleton's first grand exposure to live presentations of electronic bass music, and after only a few short years they themselves have since become Shambhala audience favorites. Since 2009 The Funk Hunters have become highly popular on the west coast bass music circuit, performing regularly at Shambhala Music Festival, Bass Coast, The Atmosphere Gathering, Tall Tree Festival and the Squamish Valley Music Festival. As their reputation grew, The Funk Hunters began touring nationally and then internationally, performing in the United States, across Europe, Brazil, Central America, and throughout Australia and New Zealand.  Live performance and production  As the duo began to work professionally, production tasks were divided up with Middleton handling music production responsibilities, and Smith handling the complex visual programming that accompanies their live performances. When performing live as a DJ duo, Middleton and Smith work with two mixers and four turntables (Technics 1200s), two DJ mixers (Pioneer 900 and Rane 62), a Roland HD Video mixer, and Serato Video software to simultaneously control the visual projection that accompany The Funk Hunters music. With production facilities in Vancouver, BC, The Funk Hunters work on a variety of projects when off the road. They create unique bootleg remixes of well-known songs by artists like The Who, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Fleetwood Mac. Middleton also produces original Funk Hunters remixes, reworking tracks for artists including Dub FX (Don't Give Up), Imagine Dragons (Shots) and Selena Gomez (Good For You). Middleton works entirely \\"in the box\\" producing in Ableton Live and mixing using UAD software emulations - he is sponsored by HHB Canada and Universal Audio. Since late 2014, longtime friend and collaborator Peter Bowles, who started playing keys in The Funk Hunters live shows, began working with Middleton in the studio co-writing some of the Funk Hunters material with Middleton. The songwriting on most original songs and official remixes released since 2014 are now credited to both Middleton and Bowles*. Middleton continues to oversee all music production and mixing duties and is still publicly credited as the producer, mixer, and sometimes mastering engineer for The Funk Hunters music.  The Funk Hunters band  The Funk Hunters also began to incorporate musicians into some of their live performances. They first recruited Vancouver DJ and saxophonist DJ Smoothie to tour on a variety of Canadian dates, and over time they have collaborated with a host of Vancouver musicians. Expanding The Funk Hunters ranks has given Middleton and Smith the option to either work strictly as a duo, or with a flexible configuration of live musicians and vocalists including Peter Bowles (Keyboards), Steven Beddall (Guitar), Cole Graham (Trumpet), Chris Wilson (Saxophone), Tonye Aganaba (Vocals) and Chali 2na (Vocals). After many years of touring with select musicians at festivals in Canada and the USA, the duo performed their first Live Band show in 2014 at the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver, and have since gone on to bring the full band configuration to other west coast festivals and venues including Tall Tree Festival, Atmosphere Gathering, Sugar Night Club, Celebrities Nightclub, Rifflandia Festival, and the Philips Weekender.  Collaboration with Chali 2na  In 2013 while The Funk Hunters were collaborating on a song with German production duo CMC & Silenta the producers unanimously agreed that if they had their choice they would want Charles Stewart, Los Angeles hip hop MC Chali 2na of Jurassic 5, to provide the vocal for the new composition. Prior to contacting Chali 2na's management the producers searched out a Chali 2na a cappella and added his existing vocal from the 2009 song Lock Shit Down to their completed instrumental so that 2na could conceptualize what his voice would sound like with their music. Chali 2na and his management were very enthusiastic about the idea of collaborating with The Funk Hunters. Unfortunately, at that time the MC was busy preparing for a forthcoming Jurassic 5 reunion. As an alternative to recording a new vocal for the song Chali 2na granted the producers permission to release the track as is, with 2na's original added a cappella vocal. Officially sanctioned by the MC, Do This For You by The Funk Hunters and CMC & Silenta featuring Chali 2na was released September 22, 2014 on Westwood Recordings. The song was named \\"Tune Of The Month\\" by Mixmag in their September 2014 issue and charted multiple times in the Beatport Top 10 Glitch Hop charts. Since releasing Do This For You The Funk Hunters and Chali 2na have performed live together throughout the world, the iconic rapper himself referring to Middleton and Smith as\\"the selectahs of the century.\\"  Westwood Recordings  In 2013 Nick Middleton decided to start his own record label. To promote the work of other artists, and to streamline The Funk Hunters business, Middleton created Westwood Recordings as the team's main center of operations. Middleton told Label Engine in January 2016 that \\"I wanted to start the label early while I was still growing as an artist, as I felt like each business would grow side by side (Westwood and The Funk Hunters), and they could kind of help pull each other along, while at the same time helping to boost all the other music I would be releasing from friends on the label too.\\" Westwood Recordings have released music by several international artists. In an interview in July 2015 with Vancity, Buzz Middleton said \\"now (Westwood is) home to friends all over the globe. There are artists from Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.\\" Westwood's roster of signed artists includes Calgary, Alberta DJ/producer Defunk, German duo CMC & Silenta, Australia's Crazy Daylight, New Zealand's K+Lab, Canadian psychedelic glitch musician Vespers, Halifax duo PINEO & LOEB, and Vancouver global groove band Delhi 2 Dublin.  Collaboration with Delhi 2 Dublin  In late 2014 members of Delhi 2 Dublin approached Nick Middleton about producing what would become their 2015 release We're All Desi. The Funk Hunters had known the members of Delhi 2 Dublin for several years and had remixed the title track of the band's 2012 release Turn Up The Stereo for the 2014 full remix version of the album Turn Up The Stereo: Remixed. We're All Desi was Middleton's first full length production. Middleton also mixed the recording. The Funk Hunters are credited as collaborators on a number of tracks on the recording. Delhi 2 Dublin's We're All Desi was released by Middleton's Westwood Recordings on September 18, 2015.  Recent activity  In November 2015 Washington DC's Fort Knox Five released The Funk Hunters Remix of their single Whatcha Gonna Do on Fort Knox Records. December 2015 saw The Funk Hunters embark on a short tour of western Canada culminating in two sold out Christmas shows called Funk The Halls held December 22 and 23 at Vancouver's Commodore Ballroom. Beginning early January 2016 Middleton and Smith once again joined forces with hip hop MC Chali 2na for an extensive tour of Europe as well as performance dates in Australia, New Zealand and the United States throughout February and March 2016.

Biography  Feick was born in 1890, the son of a cooper. He worked as a locksmith and railwayman. Feick worked from 1914 to 1923 for Deutsche Reichsbahn in Ludwigshafen am Rhein. During this time he lived in Ludwigshafen-Gartenstadt. He was a supporter of the trade union movement and a member of the board of the railway workers union TRANSNET Gewerkschaft. In 1924/1925, Feick invented the gymnastics wheel or Rh√∂nrad. In 1921, Feick was charged with obstruction and subsequently put in jail by the French troops occupying the Palatinate. While he was in jail in Mainz, he recalled that during his childhood in Reichenbach, he had connected two iron hoops with cross-bars he had found in his grandfather's blacksmith's shop and used this construct to roll down the hill next to his parents' house. Feick then invented a prototype of the Rh√∂nrad in Ludwigshafen. After his expulsion from the Palatinate by the French occupation forces in 1923, he moved to Sch√∂nau an der Brend, a town in the Rh√∂n Mountains in Bavaria and his wife's hometown. He founded, with other acquaintances in Sch√∂nau, a metal workshop and produced game devices and bedsteads. He also applied for a patent from there, with a photo taken on the grounds of Volksgesundheit e.V. (\\"Public Health Club\\"), a sports club he had founded in Ludwigshafen in 1919, serving as the basis. He was awarded the patent for his invention on 8 November 1925. However, the name Rh√∂nrad, named so in honor of his new home, was not registered until 1926. From 1925 to 1926, he developed a further variant of his invention in the Zieh- und Stanzwerk (\\"Drawing and Stamping Factory\\") in Niederscheden. In 1927 he moved to W√ºrzburg. He later moved back to Sch√∂nau an der Brend, where he died in poverty on 17 October 1959.  Legacy  * In Sch√∂nau, a monument was erected to Feick and the gymnastics wheel. * In Glan-M√ºnchweiler, where Feick lived for several years, a monument in the form of a centrifugal Rh√∂nrad was erected on the central island of a roundabout on Bundesstra√üe 423 in the Bettenhausen district.

The similarly titled (1671) Zhengzitong Ê≠£Â≠óÈÄö \\"Correct Character Mastery\\" (with zh√®ng Ê≠£ \\"right; straight; correct\\") was published by Qing dynasty scholar Liao Wenying ÂªñÊñáËã±, who bought and renamed the (1627) Zihui bian Â≠óÂΩôËæØ \\"Zihui Disputations\\", which was written by the Ming dynasty author Zhang Zilie ÂºµËá™ÁÉà as a supplement to the (1615) Zihui dictionary. Furthermore, the Japanese lexicographer Shirakawa Shizuka ÁôΩÂ∑ùÈùô edited an identically titled (1996) Jits≈´ Â≠óÈÄö \\"Mastery of Characters\\" Japanese dictionary. History In an alphabetic language like English, orthography means \\"Correct or proper spelling; spelling according to accepted usage; the way in which words are conventionally written. (By extension) Any mode or system of spelling.\\" (OED 2009, v. 4.0). When semantically extended into a logographic language like Chinese, it means \\"the way in which Chinese characters are conventionally written\\", which includes calligraphic aspects such as the script styles, stroke order, and character structure. The first Chinese orthographic dictionaries, or \\"'character model' dictionaries\\", were compiled during the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) in an effort to rectify discrepancies among characters written in seal, clerical, and regular scripts, and to standardize variant characters (Yong and Peng 2008: 197, 177). Emperor Taizong of Tang put the scholar and calligrapher Yan Shigu (581‚Äì645) in charge of the Palace Library in order to \\"verify and authorize\\" the Five Classics (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 194). The Archival Bureau's duties were to print authoritative editions of the classic works, to collate the styles of characters, to check and proofread government texts, and to produce a standard orthographic handbook. This became the first Chinese orthographic dictionary, Yan Shigu's book the Z√¨y√†ng Â≠óÊ®£ \\"Character Models\\" (aka Yanshi ziyang È°èÊ∞èÂ≠óÊ®£ \\"Mr. Yan's Character Models\\") gave model samples of writing characters in different scripts, which his grandson Yan Yuansun È°èÂÖÉÂ≠´ (d. 732) used as the basis for his Ganlu Zishu orthographic dictionary. In addition to the Zitong, various orthography dictionaries and character books were published during the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), for instance, the Fugubian Â§çÂè§Á∑® \\"Return to Old Chapters\\" by Zhang You ÂºµÊúâ and the Peixi ‰Ω©Ëßø \\"Ivory Bodkin\\" by the painter Guo Zhongshu. Text The Zitong was in one volume, and based upon the classic (121) Shuowen jiezi character dictionary. It included 601 character head entries, which were arranged into 89 sections according to the number of strokes in the regular script. The head character was in seal script and entries were in regular script, giving notation first, followed by the definition. All the exegetic interpretations quote the Shuowen jiezi without any other sources. There were flaws in the Zitong, such as listing some characters twice and inconsistencies in the 89-radical system. It did have a useful appendix with 82 popular erroneous writings, such as yƒ´chang Ë°£Â∏∏ instead of yƒ´shang Ë°£Ë£≥ \\"clothing; clothes\\" (Theobald 2013). Nevertheless, this dictionary was important for the study of lexicographical theories concerning dictionary compilation in the Song Dynasty (Yong and Peng 2008: 198).

It is pointed out that in his Testament Cardinal Pironti left a legacy to the Basilica, and that persons who held his office as Vice-Chancellor sometimes were also Canons of the Vatican Basilica. This is very thin material indeed. The canonry is more 'imaginary' than 'uncertain'.Johrendt, Die Diener, p. 236, and nn. 381 and 382.

There were twenty-one cardinals at the death of the Pope, including Cardinal Giordano Pironti, but three were unable to make it to Perugia in time to take part in the Electoral meetings, Simon de Brion (who was Legate in France), Simon Paltinieri (who was governor of Campania for Urban IV) and Guido Grosso Fulcodi (Guy Folques), who had been sent as Legate to England, but was being obstructed from crossing over from France. There was a period of only five days between the death of Urban IV and the election of his successor, which suggests that the Electoral meeting probably began on 5 October, and the scrutinies began on 6 October. On 8 October, the Cardinals elected Guido Grosso Fulcodi, though he was absent. He finally reached Perugia and had his election confirmed by his enthronement on 5 February 1265. He chose the throne name Clement IV.John P. Adams, Sede Vacante and Election of 1264-1265.

The women-owned company is named after its founder Marie Sharp and is highly regarded for its world famous carrot-based habanero pepper sauce recipe. The brand offers many varieties of sauces made from bases such as carrots, orange/grapefruit pulp, nopales, tamarind, mango, and pineapple combined with crushed habaneros. Marie Sharp's products are distributed in more than 20 countries and are widely available in restaurants and stores throughout Belize. Her recipes are revered by top chefs and hot sauce aficionados worldwide. History Several varieties of Marie Sharp's hot sauces The company is privately owned by Marie Sharp, 79 years old in 2019, who began locally selling sauces on her 400-acre farm outside Dangriga in 1981. In 1985 a factory was built to meet growing demand, also serving as a popular tourist destination. The product was the first commercially successful agricultural product manufactured in and exported from Belize, under the name of \\"Melinda‚Äôs Hot Sauce\\". Marie's recipe was the first habanero pepper sauce to achieve national distribution in the United States, with the Reese Finer Foods distribution network in 1989. Once the market for the product had been established, the importer, Figueroa International Inc., who was marketing the sauce, trademarked the product name, effectively cutting Sharp out of her own business. After a five-year struggle, Sharp gave up her original brand name, Melinda's Original Habanero Pepper sauce, in exchange for being released from her exclusive contract with the importer. She then re-branded the product under her own name. Distribution has since expanded from Belize to much of Central and North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. In 2013, Sharp's entries at the Anuga Food Fair in Cologne made the prestigious \\"Taste13 Showcase\\" round and placed in the top three products at the world's largest food fair. In 2014 Marie Sharp's sales totaled $3.8 million. In 2016, the founder was inducted into the Hot Sauce Hall of Fame. The company also introduced their newest pepper sauce, \\"Smokin' Marie's\\", a smoked habanero sauce inspired by Alaskan smoked products. A combination of orange, grapefruit, guava and craboo-wood is used to smoke the habaneros. On January 14, 2019, Gerry Sharp, Marie's husband and business partner later in life, died. He was a citrus pioneer in Belize and was instrumental in helping to shape the industry. On January 27, 2019, Marie Sharp's oldest son, and well known and loved businessman, Michael Alexander Williams, Sr., 58, was murdered. Michael managed operations in Belize City for the company since the 1990s and he was instrumental to the continuing success of the Marie Sharp's brand in the countries largest market and throughout Central America. On February 14, 2019, in partnership with the US Embassy in Belize, Marie Sharp announced the launch of a new pineapple pepper sauce, \\"Pure Love\\", created to aid Combating Gender-Based Violence through Partnership The proceeds of the sale of ‚ÄúPure Love‚Äù will go to Haven House‚Äìa non-profit domestic violence shelter‚Äìdirectly benefiting victims of gender-based violence and empowering them to take control and positively transform their lives. Jelly and jam In 1982, finding that the farm had surplus fruit, Sharp visited local markets to get ideas of what products she and other farmers might be able to produce to increase their sales. Discovering that all the commercially produced jams, jellies and marmalades were manufactured from non-tropical fruits, she recognized an opportunity. Experimenting with recipes, Sharp developed a product with higher fruit content than the US Food and Drug Administration required and began marketing her natural products made without preservatives. Marie Sharp‚Äôs produces eleven types of preserves which are marketed locally and internationally.

Guerre √† la Guerre! War against War! Oorlog aan den Oorlog! is a book by Ernst Friedrich, published for the first time in 1924. It examines the human cost of the First World War and shows the true face of war (injuries, mutilations, executions, suffering, misery and death).\\"When antiwar commemorative demonstrations took place all over Germany during the 1924 anniversary year, Friedrich published War Against War in Berlin with text and captions in four languages\\".Dora Apel,\\"Cultural Battlegrounds: Weimar Photographic Narratives of War\\".

Description  The German pacifist Ernst Friedrich wished to enlighten people with this book by demonstrating the horrors of the First World War. The work becomes a \\"pacifist bible\\" that rallies the movement under the slogan \\"no more war\\". Following the principle that a picture is worth a thousand words, the book makes use of images of war.

For this operation Carson was able to prepare by studying a three-dimensional physical model of the twins' anatomy. Carson described this separation as the first of its kind, with 23 similar attempted separations ending in the death of one or both twins. Although Carson was able to separate the boys, they were both left profoundly disabled. The Associated Press reported, in 1989, two years after the separation, that Patrick remained in a \\"vegetative state\\", following the surgery. He never came out of his coma. According to a 2015 Washington Post article, he \\"died sometime in the last decade\\". Benjamin recovered to a certain extent.

Born into slavery, she was the child of David Dickson, a white planter, and Julia Frances Lewis Dickson, one of his slaves, who was thirteen when her daughter was born. Amanda was raised by Elizabeth Sholars Dickson, her white grandmother and mistress. She was educated and schooled in the social skills of her father's class, and he helped her to enjoy a life of privilege away from the harsh realities of slavery before emancipation following the Civil War. In her late 20s, she also attended the normal school of Atlanta University, from 1876 to 1878. After her father's death in 1885 and a successful ruling in a challenge to his will by his white relatives, Amanda Dickson inherited his estate, which included 17,000 acres of land in Hancock and Washington counties in Georgia. She married twice: her first husband was white and their sons were mixed-race. Their wealth enabled them to marry well.  Early life and education  David Dickson Amanda America Dickson was born into slavery in Hancock County, Georgia. Her enslaved mother, Julia Frances Lewis Dickson, was just 13 when she was born. Her father, David Dickson, was a white planter who owned her mother; he was one of the eight wealthiest planters in the county. When he was 40 years old, David Dickson had raped 12-year-old Julia Dickson, and she became pregnant. After Amanda was weaned, she was taken from her enslaved mother and maternal grandmother, Rose Dickson, to be raised in the household of her white grandmother and owner, Elizabeth Sholars Dickson. As Amanda grew, her grandmother used her as a domestic servant. Throughout Amanda's childhood, her father became wealthier and more famous, renowned for his innovative and successful farming techniques. David Dickson showed that farmers could profit from slave labor without having to resort to violence to keep them in submission. By 1861, he was known as the \\"Prince of Georgia Farmers,\\" having contributed perhaps more than any other farmer in Georgia at that time to the prosperity of the region. Amanda's father showered her with love and affection. Her mother was a household slave, assigned as David's housekeeper, and she was forced also to provide him with sex. Amanda benefited greatly from her father's social status, enabling her to live a life of relative privilege as a slave child. Evidence suggests that David Dickson took charge of Amanda's education. In her white grandmother's household, she learned to read, write, and play the piano, unlike what was permitted for her enslaved relatives. Amanda also learned rules of social etiquette appropriate for the social standing of her father's side of the family. She learned to dress in a modest, elegant fashion and how to present herself as a \\"lady\\". Amanda also learned from her father how to conduct business transactions responsibly and how to maintain and protect her finances after marriage. In 1864, Amanda's grandmother Elizabeth Sholars Dickson died. Amanda and her grandmother Elizabeth had shared a particularly close relationship, with Amanda spending much time in her grandmother's room. Yet, despite this special relationship, Amanda was held as Elizabeth's slave until her death. Beginning in 1801, Georgia had prohibited slaveholders from independently freeing their slaves. Therefore, Elizabeth and David Dickson had no means to manumit Amanda and keep her with them in Georgia until the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, was ratified on December 6, 1865. At the age of twenty- seven, Amanda chose to leave the security of her home at her father's plantation in Hancock County, Georgia to attend the normal school of Atlanta University, where she studied teaching from 1876 to 1878.  Marriages  Charles Eubanks In 1866 at the age of sixteen, Amanda America left her father's plantation and moved to a small plantation in Floyd County, Georgia near the city of Rome. She married (or lived as if she was married to) Charles Eubanks, a white first cousin and Civil War veteran. Because of anti- miscegenation laws in Georgia at the time, Amanda America and Charles, as an interracial couple, could not legally marry in Georgia. Therefore, they either never officially married, or they married out of state before returning to Georgia (but there is no surviving proof of a legal marriage.) They had two sons: Julian Henry (1866‚Äì1937) and Charles Green Eubanks (1870‚Äìc. 1900). Their mixed-race sons, later married prominent members of Georgia society. Julian Henry Eubanks married Eva Walton, the daughter of George Walton, who is credited as one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. Charles Green Eubanks married Kate Holsey, the daughter of Bishop Lucius Holsey and his wife Harriet. After four years of being married to (or living as a married couple with) Charles Eubanks, Amanda left her husband and returned to her father's plantation in 1870, shortly after giving birth to her second son, Charles Green. Charles Eubanks died a few years later on July 31, 1873. David Dickson's wife, Clara Harris Dickson, died the next day. Years after having completed her teaching degree, Amanda America married a second time, on July 14, 1892. Her second husband was Nathan Toomer from Perry, Georgia, and she legally was known as Amanda America Dickson Toomer. Nathan Toomer was a wealthy, educated mixed-race man of her class. He was the child of an enslaved black woman, Kit, and a wealthy white Toomer brother who had settled in Houston County, Georgia in the 1850s. As a young man, Nathan had served as the personal assistant to Colonel Henry Toomer, and in that capacity learned the ways of white upper class gentlemen. Amanda died on June 11, 1893, eleven months after they were married.  David Dickson's will  When David Dickson died suddenly on February 18, 1885, Amanda America Dickson inherited the majority of his vast estate, which included 17,000 acres of land. His will left his estate to her \\"sound judgment and unlimited discretion\\" and prohibited interference from anyone, including any husband that she may have. In what became known as the David Dickson Will Case, seventy-nine white relatives of David Dickson disputed the will in court, mainly arguing that David Dickson was not of a sound mind when he wrote the will, that he was \\"unduly influenced\\" by Amanda America and Julia Dickson, and that Amanda America was not his child. On July 6, 1885, probate judge R. H. Lewis ruled in favor of the will. In November 1885, the trial in the Superior Court of Hancock County began, with the eventual ruling siding with Amanda America Dickson and her two sons. Then, in March 1886, the white relatives filed their appeal with the Supreme Court of Georgia. On October 11, 1886, chief justice James Jackson, and associate justices Samuel Hall and Mark Blanford heard the case following the appeal. James Jackson expressed his firm conviction against upholding the will, saying, \\"I would rather died in my place than uphold the will.\\" A few days later he became ill with pneumonia and died. Judge Logan E. Bleckley filled his vacancy and then refused to hear the case again. Associate justices Samuel Hall and Mark Blanford remained to deliver the ruling regarding if the white relatives would receive a new trial. Ultimately, eight months later on June 13, 1887, Samuel Hall and Mark Blanford of the Georgia Supreme Court also ruled in favor of Amanda America and her two sons, formally settling the dispute of David Dickson's will. Citing the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, saying that the rights and privileges of a black woman and her children would be the same rights and privileges of a white concubine or an illegitimate white woman and her children. So, the same laws governed the rights and privileges of women of both races.  Life in Augusta, Georgia  Amanda America's house in Augusta The death of her father, David Dickson, on February 18, 1885 was a pivotal turning point in Amanda America's life. Immediately after his death, she took measures to protect herself legally. Also, in part to distance herself from her disgruntled white relatives whom David Dickson had left out of his will, she moved to Augusta, Georgia, which was a familiar city to her. She arrived in Augusta in 1886 and purchased a large, seven-bedroom house at 452 Telfair Street, which was in a multiracial neighborhood. Amanda America lived in a society in which white Georgians viewed black citizens as the same (with no class distinctions), regardless of education, wealth, and social etiquette. Nevertheless, she became a member of the elite black community in Augusta, Georgia, and she was held in high esteem by those who came to know her because of her wealth, elegance, and intelligence.  Family ordeal  Amanda America Dickson spent the last eleven months of her life as the wife of Nathan Toomer, from Perry, Georgia whom she married on July 14, 1892. Her health was fragile throughout her second marriage, as she had several health problems which required the continual attention of her family physician, Thomas D. Coleman. By 1893, Amanda America's health had greatly improved, but a disturbing family ordeal would be the catalyst for the further deterioration of her health and eventual death. Her younger son, twenty-three year old Charles Dickson, who was married to Kate Holsey, became infatuated with Mamie Toomer, one of his stepsisters who was only fourteen years old. On March 10, 1893, Nathan and Amanda brought Mamie to the St. Francis School and Convent in Baltimore, Maryland, an order of black nuns, in an attempt to protect her from Charles Dickson's misguided affection. Charles Dickson conspired with his brother-in-law Dunbar Walton, his sister-in-law Carrie Walton Wilson, and a hired man, Louis E. Frank, to kidnap Mamie Toomer. Their plan was foiled, and ultimately, Dunbar Walton, Louis E. Frank, and their lawyer, E. J. Waring, were indicted by the grand jury of Baltimore, Maryland for conspiracy to kidnap Mamie Toomer. Charles Dickson escaped without any legal ramifications for his actions.  Death  In June 1893, with the kidnapping drama (involving Mamie Toomer, Charles Dickson, and Charles Dickson's co-conspirators) behind them, Nathan and Amanda America purchased two first-class tickets from a sales representative of the Pullman Palace Car Company to transport them from Baltimore, Maryland back home to Augusta, Georgia. Because of racial discrimination, they were denied their first-class accommodations and direct, unimpeded travel to Augusta, Georgia. The delayed travel to Augusta and the conditions in the Pullman car, most notably the rising temperature, became intolerable for Amanda America. As a result, her health quickly deteriorated. Dr. F. D. Kendall, who examined her on the morning of June 9, 1893, noted that her heart and lungs appeared to be fine, but that she was obviously very nervous and anxious to return home. Dr. Kendall gave her anodyne, a pain-relieving medication. Nathan and a very ill Amanda America arrived back at their home in Augusta, Georgia between four and five in the afternoon on June 9, 1893. She was quickly tended to by Dr. Eugene Foster, in place of their family physician, Thomas D. Coleman, who was out of town. She was diagnosed with neurasthenia (general exhaustion of the nervous system) or Beard's disease. Symptoms of neurasthenia, as described by nineteenth-century physicians, include \\"sick headache, noises in the ear, atonic voice, deficient mental control, bad dreams, insomnia, nervous dyspepsia (disturbed digestion), heaviness of the loin and limb, flushing and fidgetiness, palpitations, vague pains and flying neuralgia (pain along a nerve), spinal irritation, uterine irritability, impotence, hopelessness, claustrophobia, and dread of contamination.\\" Amanda America Dickson Toomer died on June 11, 1893, with \\"complications of diseases\\" being the cause of death listed on her death certificate. Amanda America Dickson Toomer's funeral took place at the Trinity Colored Methodist Episcopal Church in Augusta, Georgia. Amanda America died without a will, which resulted in a legal battle after her death for control of her estate. Her mother, Julia Frances Lewis Dickson, and her second husband, Nathan Toomer, both petitioned in court to be designated the temporary administrator of her estate. Ultimately, Julia Dickson, Nathan Toomer, and Amanda America's younger son, Charles Dickson, were able to settle the dispute over Amanda America's estate amicably out of court. Nine months after her death, Nathan Toomer married Nina Pinchback, the daughter of P. B. S. Pinchback, the Reconstruction Era senator-elect from Louisiana. On December 26, 1894, they became parents to Jean Toomer, a Harlem Renaissance writer who wrote the novel Cane (1923).  Representation in popular culture  A House Divided (2000) is the television movie that depicts the life of Amanda America Dickson. It stars Jennifer Beals as Amanda America Dickson, Sam Waterston as David Dickson, LisaGay Hamilton as Julia Frances Lewis Dickson, and Shirley Douglas as Elizabeth Sholars Dickson.

It was designed by the architect Francisco Ramos de Azevedo and inaugurated on January 25, 1933 as a wholesale and retail post specializing in fruits, vegetables, cereals, meats, spices and other food products. The market is located in the Mercado neighborhood, a name that references the market, in the historic center of S√£o Paulo. It is located near the Tamanduate√≠ River in the old V√°rzea do Carmo, a floodplain of the river now primarily used as Dom Pedro II Park. The market was formally named the Mercado Municipal S√£o Paulo in 1995. It is commonly known in S√£o Paulo as the Mercad√£o, or \\"big market\\", and a noted meeting point for resident S√£o Paulo and one of the most visited tourist spots in the city. History Interior of the Market The structure, built in the eclectic style, is noted for its columns, vaults and stained glass. It was constructed between 1928 and 1933 by the office of the architect Francisco de Paula Ramos de Azevedo (1851-1928), with a fa√ßade designed by Felisberto Ranzini. Structure The first floor of the market is occupied by retailers, and the second floor mezzanine serves as a restaurant. The Mercad√£o occupies and has 1,500 employees working at various in the building. 450 tons of food passes through the market per day in more than 290 boxes. Fa√ßade The fa√ßade of the Municipal Market is the work of Felisberto Ranzini (1882-1976), an Italian-Brazilian who worked in the architectural office of Ramos de Azevedo. Ranzini, who also participated in the construction of the S√£o Francisco Law School, utilized a mix of Ionic and Doric columns on the municipal market. The massive columns allow for large spaces for glazing in the market which in turn provide a large source of natural light. Stained glass The market is noted for its stained glass. 72 stained glass, arranged in 32 panels, are the work of the Russian artist Conrado Sorgenicht Filho and his office, Casa Conrado Sorgenicht. Sorgenicht is noted for his work the windows of the S√£o Paulo Cathedral and 300 other Brazilian churches. Unlike stained glass produced as sacred works, the windows of the market depict various aspects of food production in the greater S√£o Paulo region. Renovation A third and most significant renovation of the market was proposed in 2003 as part of the Program for the Revitalization of Central S√£o Paulo (Programa de Revitaliza√ß√£o do Centro de S√£o Paulo) financed by the Inter-American Development Bank. A new mezzanine with eight restaurants, new exterior lighting, and the replacement of the market floor with granite slabs were completed by August 2004.

It consists of a speaker mounted on the firewall between the engine and the cabin, which adds noise to the cabin in order to replicate the driving experience of older vehicles that had lower levels of sound insulation... This system was introduced in 2011 on VW's Golf/GTI, and has also been used on the Jetta/GLI, and Beetle Turbo. The same technology has also been used in other cars from Volkswagen Group, including the Audi S3 and ≈†koda Octavia vRS.. The sound generated by this device has been described as \\"a sort of buzzy, fizzy noise\\". It has been reported to play a digital recording of engine noise, but Volkswagen claims that these reports are false, and that it reproduces the actual engine noise of the car.. Some diesel cars produced by the Volkswagen Group also have an \\"exhaust soundaktor\\". This system uses additional speakers in the exhaust system of the car to generate \\"a low-pitched, roaring sound\\" intended to make the car sound less like a diesel and more like a conventional gasoline engine. Other vehicle manufacturers have also used artificial engine noise systems, implemented in other ways. Some models of the BMW M5 add noise to the car's audio system, for instance, and the 2015 Ford Mustang also added a system for sending the car's engine noise through its speakers.. Multiple manufacturers have shaped the engine compartment or installed resonant pipes within it in order to direct greater amounts of actual engine noise to the cabin, a system also used by VW before switching to Soundaktor.

EBSCOhost Due to the subject matter, the book has been extremely controversial with a mixed critical reception, leading to a legal case in British Columbia over an attempt to ban the book.  Plot summary  This story is based on the protagonist, Asha, and her struggle explaining to her teacher and friends that she has two mothers, as part of the process of gaining permission to go on a school trip. The book begins when Asha's teacher, Ms. Samuels, sees Asha's mothers' names on the permission form and assumes it has been filled out incorrectly. Ms. Samuels wonders which one is Asha‚Äôs mother, and she struggles to understand the possibility of Asha having two moms. In one scene, a worried Asha confides in her mothers who agree to talk to the teacher face to face to sort matters out. In the meantime, Asha informs her classmates about different types of families. The story concludes with Asha being granted permission to go on the school trip, and her classmates and teachers having learned about different family structures.  Reception  Asha‚Äôs Mums has been received by the public in a variety of ways, as some see it as being poorly written while others appreciate the content. In a piece written by Elizabeth MacCallum, she explains that ‚ÄúElwin and Paulse teach sexual politics and don't even know how to concoct a believable plot.‚ÄùMacCALLUM, ELIZABETH. \\"CHILDREN'S BOOKS Sensitive Tales Lift the Lid Off Fears about Sexuality.\\" The Globe and Mail, Apr 20, 1991.

ProQuest  Controversy  A notable controversy occurred in 1997, a legal case referred to as Chamberlain vs. Surrey School District.‚ÄúCulture, religion and curriculum: lessons from the ‚Äòthree books‚Äô controversy in Surrey, BC‚Äù. Canadian Geographer, Autumn 2006. It all began when a school teacher by the name of James Chamberlain, who identifies as gay and who taught in the Surrey School District, attempted to have three books approved by the school board. The list consisted of Asha‚Äôs Mums; One Dad, Two Dads, Brown Dad, Blue Dads by Johnny Valentine; and Belinda's Bouquet by Lesl√©a Newman.Sin, Lena. \\"B.C. Board Upholds Ban on Gay-Themed Books\\". National Post, Jun 14, 2003, pp. A8. ProQuest These children‚Äôs books all included the topic of same-sex parents, depicting them in a positive way. The school board decided on April 24, 1997, with a vote of 4-2, that the books would not be approved. More specifically, Asha‚Äôs Mums was denied by the board by a vote of 5-2. The school board explained that the books were banned due to religious reasons, avoiding any conflict with families.\\"Surrey School Board Perverts the Law's Intent\\". Vancouver Sun, Jun 14, 2003, pp. C8. ProQuest The decision made by the board was backed by a Protestant and Catholic group that held very conservative beliefs. The more progressive organizations did not support the ruling. In December of 1998, the case was taken to the British Columbia Supreme Court where the book ban was overturned as Chamberlain argued that the school board used religion in an ill-suited fashion and that it disregarded the B.C. School Act. This decision was urged by Justice Saunders. The British Columbia Court of Appeal ruling in September 2000 overturned Saunders' ruling that the ban had been religiously motivated, but substituted its own narrower finding that the books could not be banned from use because they met the school board's criteria for inclusion in school libraries, thus leaving both sides of the case technically able to claim victory.\\"Both sides claim victory in same-sex book case\\". Vancouver Sun, September 21, 2000. On the day following the decision, the Vancouver Sun republished the entire text of the book in its print edition.\\"Asha's Mums\\". Vancouver Sun, September 21, 2000. Because of the ambiguity of the decision, the case was taken up by the Supreme Court of Canada.\\"Top court eyes B.C. ban on gay books for pupils\\". The Province, October 5, 2001. In Chamberlain v Surrey School District No 36 [2002], the Supreme Court of Canada found that the ban was unreasonable, contradicting the secular and non-sectarian principles of the BC School Act.\\"Supreme Court overturns book ban\\". Sudbury Star, December 24, 2002. Under this ruling, a ban on books about same-sex parents could not be legally justified. Within months of the Supreme Court decision, the Surrey school board again banned the three books, this time citing reasons including \\"poor grammar and spelling\\" in Asha's Mums, the inclusion of the \\"age-inappropriate\\" subject of dieting in Belinda's Bouquet and purported mockery of \\"different skin colours\\" in One Dad, Two Dads.\\"School board rejects books with gay parents for bad grammar\\". CBC News, June 13, 2003. At the same time, however, the board approved two other books, ABC: A Family Alphabet Book and Who's In a Family, which also included depictions of same-sex parents.\\"Ratified books not error-free: Surrey school committee OK's two new same-sex books\\". Vancouver Sun, June 28, 2003.  Analysis of Controversy  In her analysis of controversies over LGBTQ+ literature like Asha‚Äôs Mums, Jennifer Espositio explains the prevalence of such debates during the 1990s. The idea of the ‚ÄúRainbow Curriculum‚Äù was suggested in 1992 by Joseph Fernandez, which included a list of books highlighting gay and lesbian topics. This action caused an uproar from religious groups and individuals, causing the curriculum to be shot down. Additionally, conservative parents began revolting and protesting by burning books that included LGBTQ+ themes. In the Chamberlain vs. Surrey School District case, one of the more pressing issues that involved the public was whether or not religious beliefs should play a role in situations such as this. Typically a more private matter, religion played a large role in many of the court rulings. It brought to light the opposing perspectives of more progressive groups, arguing that religion should be kept separate from public matters, and the conservative groups stating that that view is inherently anti-religious.

It is a large shrub with shiny leaves and the largest flowers in its genus and is only known from a restricted area near Paynes Find. Description Eremophila grandiflora is a shrub growing to high and wide with branches that are sticky and shiny due to a thick layer of resin. The branches are also covered with small raised glands and the younger branches are hairy. The leaves are arranged alternately with stalks long, and blades that are long, wide, elliptic to lance-shaped and usually sticky with resin. The flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils on a flattened, hairy stalk long. There are 5 overlapping, pale reddish-pink, elliptic, pointed sepals which differ in size from each other but are long. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The tube is brown with darker markings with spreading petal lobes that are pale lilac-blue to almost white, with purple or brown spots near their bases and inside the tube. The outside of the tube and petal lobes is hairy while the inside is mostly glabrous. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the tube. Flowering occurs from June to early September. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Andrew Brown and Bevan Buirchell in 2007 and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (grandiflora) is from Latin words meaning \\"great\\" or \\"large\\" and \\"-flowered\\". Distribution and habitat Eremophila grandiflora is common in a small area near Paynes Find in the Yalgoo biogeographic region where it grows in stony clay soils along drainage lines and slopes. Conservation status This species is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

It is located in the Copper Coast Council. From 1861 to 1923, it was the centre of a copper mining industry that formed colonial South Australia's largest mining enterprise. A substantial portion of the locality is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register as the Moonta Mines State Heritage Area and on the National Heritage List as the Australian Cornish Mining Heritage Site, Moonta Mines. History Patrick \\" Paddy \\" Ryan, a shepherd for pastoralist Sir Walter Hughes, discovered copper on Hughes' property at Moonta in May 1861. The Tiparra Mining Association (later the Moonta Mining Company) commenced operations in 1862 after a legal battle over title to the claim. It proved extremely successful, with the Moonta deposits resulting in high yields. It saw a particular influx of miners from Cornwall in England. The government town of Moonta was surveyed in 1863, which resulted in a division between the professional classes in Moonta and a more informal township dominated by mining workers at Moonta Mines. The Moonta miners' undertook a major strike in 1864 over concerns about mining practices. By 1875, the success of the Moonta Mines and those in the surrounding area had made Moonta the second largest town in South Australia and the largest copper region in the British Empire; Moonta Mines itself had a population of 5,000 residents. In 1876, the Moonta Mining Company became the first mining company in Australia to pay out one million pounds in dividends. However, living conditions were poor and many lives were lost to disease during this time. Copper prices had begun to decline by the 1880s, and in 1889 forced the Moonta Mining Company to merge with the owners of Wallaroo Mines to form the Wallaroo and Moonta Mining and Smelting Co. Ltd. The mine finally closed in 1923, after which the Moonta Mines locality sharply declined, although the cementation works continued in use until 1943. The Moonta Mines State Heritage Area was declared in 1984. The modern locality of Moonta Mines was established in January 1999, when boundaries were formalised for the long established name.

History The Yelta mine, located on the current boundary with North Yelta, was worked in three distinct periods: from 1864 to the mid-1870s, from 1903 to 1907 by Paramatta Copper Mines Ltd., and as a state enterprise from 1910 to 1913. The Yelta Mining Company was founded in 1864 following small-scale operations by Henry Richard Hancock, leading to the discovery of the main lode in 1868, and by the time of its first closure following a downturn in copper prices in 1877, it had produced 1,700 tonnes of copper. The French-owned Paramatta company was optimistic about the mine's prospects when it reopened it in 1903, although it had been dormant for thirty years, and upgraded the mine and smelting plant and connected the Yelta and Paramatta mines to the Balaklava-Moonta railway line. However, the mine closed again in 1907, which the Register of the National Estate suggested may have stemmed from a downturn in copper prices that year. There continued to be high local hopes for the mine when it was controversially purchased by the Verran state Labor government in 1910; however, it was again unsuccessful, and closed permanently in 1913, with the machinery being sold off in 1915 and 1920. The total production of the mine over its lifetime is estimated at 4,300 tonnes of copper. The state government also conducted a secondary mining operation in the east of the Yelta leases from 1906 to 1916. It was later reworked by private parties as the Black Dog Mine from 1924 to 1929 and again as part of the Moonta Mining Scheme from 1929 to 1938. It produced a further 1,920 tonnes of copper.

He has coached several players ranked within the top 10 by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), including Novak Djokovic, Ivan Ljubiƒçiƒá, Richard Gasquet, and Milos Raonic. Early life Piatti began playing tennis at the age of nine at the tennis club of Villa d'Este in Cernobbio, Italy. The idea of becoming a tennis coach first occurred to him around age 20 when the head coach of the Villa d'Este tennis club became injured, and Piatti was asked to replace him. He spent formative years learning to coach at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy (which was later absorbed into IMG Academy), in Bradenton, Florida. Coaching career Piatti began as a private coach for professional players in 1988. Among the early players he coached are Renzo Furlan (career-high world No. 19), Cristiano Caratti (career-high world No. 26), and Omar Camporese (career-high world No. 18). He began working with Ivan Ljubiƒçiƒá in June 1997, when Ljubiƒçiƒá was ranked No. 954 in the world. This relationship lasted until the end of Ljubiƒçiƒá's professional playing career in 2012. Ljubiƒçiƒá achieved a career- high ranking of world No. 3 while working with Piatti. From fall 2005 until June 2006, he also coached Novak Djokovic at age 17 and 18. Djokovic parted ways due to Piatti's refusal to work full-time with him. In 2011, Piatti claimed that he knew then (in 2006) that Djokovic \\"could become number one in the world at the level of Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer because Novak always worked hard as a kid, with the family, and he was very focused and determined to be world number one.\\" In February 2011, while still coaching world No. 14 Ljubiƒçiƒá, Piatti began to co-coach Richard Gasquet (with S√©bastien Grosjean), who was then ranked No. 31 in the world. With Piatti, Gasquet improved to a high ranking of world No. 9, short of his career high No. 7 (achieved in 2007). Piatti ended the relationship abruptly in November 2013 during the season-ending 2013 ATP World Tour Finals. On December 1, 2013, he began working with Milos Raonic, co-coaching with former student Ivan Ljubiƒçiƒá. At that time, Raonic held an ATP world ranking of No. 11\\\\. With Piatti, his ranking rose to a career-high of No. 3. Five times Grand Slam champion, Maria Sharapova started working with Piatti in 2019 and they announced on November 8th that they would work together for 2020.

He was one of the leading authorities on the issues of Iberian Muslims living under Christian rule.  Biography  He was born in the Ouarsenis mountains (, Al-Wansharis) in present-day Algeria, in a family belonging to one of the Berber tribes in these mountains. His family moved to Tlemcen when he was a child. In Tlemcen, he studied and later taught Islamic law. He later moved to Fez, present-day Morocco. He became official mufti in Fez and became the leading living authority on the issues of Iberian Muslims living under Christian rule, after the Christian conquest (termed reconquista) of Islamic Al-Andalus. p.298 He died on the Tuesday, 20 June 1508. He was buried in Fez, in the Kudyat al-Bara·π≠il cemetery, near the tomb of ibn Abbad.  Works  His most notable work is al-Miyar al-Murib (\\"The Clear Standard\\"), a multivolume collection of legal opinions (fatwas) in North Africa and Islamic Spain. By the sixteenth century it became part of the educational curriculum in North Africa, and in modern times it is studied as a source of information on the religious and social practices of contemporary Islamic Spain and the Maghreb North Africa. Another work, Al-Manhaj al-Faaiq wa al-Manhal al-Raaiq fi Ahkam al-Wathaaiq (\\"The Supreme Method and the Pure Source on the Rules of Notarization\\") consists of 16 chapters about notarization of Islamic legal documents. It includes the requirements and desired characters of a notary public, standards and requirements of an Islamic legal document, as well as notarial topics such as how to correctly date a legal document. In total, at least 15 of al-Wansharisi's works are extant, almost all in the topic of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence).  On Muslims in Spain  He also wrote Asna al- matajir fi bayan ahkam man ghalaba 'ala watanihi al-nasara wa lam yuhajir wa ma yatarattabu 'alayhi min al-'uqubat wa al-zawajir (\\"The Most Noble Commerce, Setting Forth the Legal Rulings Regarding One Whose Lands Have been Conquered by the Christians and Stern Threats That Apply to Him as a Consequence\\", shortened Asna al-matajir or \\"The Most Noble Commerce\\"), an extensive fatwa arguing that it was compulsory for Muslims in Christian-conquered Spain to emigrate to Muslim lands. It was issued in 1491, shortly before the fall of Granada which marks the end of the reconquista. At this point, most of Spain excepting Granada were had been conquered by the Christians, and Muslims had already lived in these territories under Christian rule (such Muslims are also known as mud√©jars). In addition to citing the Qur'an, hadith and previous consensus of jurists, he also supported his case with a detailed demonstration of why the mud√©jars were unable to properly fulfill a Muslim's ritual obligation. This fatwa is one of the most preeminent pre-modern legal opinions on Muslims living under non-Muslim rule, although it was issued in the context of Muslims in Iberia and North Africa. In addition to The Most Noble Commerce, he also wrote a shorter companion fatwa, sometimes called the \\"Marbella fatwa\\", responding to a question about a man from Marbella in Southern Spain who wished to stay in Christian Spain in order to assist those unable to migrate. These two fatwas were distributed as independent work, and are later included in his collection The Clear Standard. Al-Wansharisi's position, which emphasised the obligation to emigrate, was the predominant position of the Maliki school at the time. The Oran fatwa, issued in 1504 after the forced conversion in the Crown of Castile, was an exception to this majority opinion, arguing that it may be permissible for Spanish Muslims to stay and even outwardly conform to Christianity, when forced and necessary for survival.

Early life Frank Shelby Groner was born near the town of Weston, Texas, in Collin County, Texas, to William Christopher Groner and Cleopatra Clementine Dunnegan on January 7, 1877. His parents moved to Graham, Texas, when he was three- years-old, where he started to preach by using a flat top trunk as a pulpit. Groner was the first-born of eight children, four boys and four girls. The family later moved to a farm in Jack County, Texas, where he attended a school where his father was the teacher, until he was fourteen. He first attended the short-lived North Texas Baptist College in Jacksboro, Texas, from the age of fourteen where he was awarded a Master of Science degree in 1896. His graduating thesis was on the subject of \\"The Evidence of Christianity as shown in Profane History\\". Adult life School teacher Groner taught school for three years after graduation, one year in Jack County and two years in Benjamin, Texas. Law practice Groner early settled on a career in law. Groner then studied at the University of Texas Law School. Groner was nominated as county attorney by the Jack County Democratic Society near the end of his second year in law school.

Baptist pastor Groner then entered the Baptist ministry as pastor of the First Baptist Church of Stamford, Texas, where he was ordained in 1905 and was pastor for seven years. In the course of his pastorship, the existing church building became too small and a new building was built. The congregation increased in size from 147 to about 750 at the time of his departure. Groner became the second pastor of the Columbus Avenue Baptist Church in Waco, Texas, in 1911, where he succeeded the Reverend R. G.

The membership increased from less than 400 to nearly 1,200 during his ministry. Baptist executive Groner was selected to head the Southern Baptist Hospital Commission in 1916. He was able to raise sufficient funds to found Hillcrest Baptist Hospital in Waco, Texas, and the Southern Baptist Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1918, he was appointed executive secretary of the Baptist General Convention of Texas, which caused him to resign as pastor of the Columbus Avenue Baptist Church and relocate to Dallas, Texas. He served as executive secretary until June 1928. He is reported to have served \\"wisely and well\\". He also accepted the directorship for Texas of the Southern Baptist Convention's $75 million fundraising campaign in 1920. He raised $12 million in Texas despite the opposition of J. Frank Norris. College president Groner was chosen as president of the College of Marshall in Marshall, Texas in June 1928. Groner used his financial skills to greatly enlarge the College of Marshall by acquiring additional property and buildings. Groner served as president of the College of Marshall for fourteen years and stepped down in 1942 due to ill health at which time he was appointed president emeritus of the College of Marshall. Author Groner also found time in the course of his life to author several books on Christianity, including: * The Witness of Great Minds to Christian Verities * Christian Education * Our Sainted Loved Ones Honors Howard Payne College and Baylor University granted honorary doctorates to Groner in recognition of his service to the College of Marshall. Personal life Groner met Laura Virginia Wyatt (1878‚Äì1951) of Cleveland County, Arkansas, while they were both students at North Texas Baptist College. They were married in 1903 and had seven children. Groner was a close friend of Patrick Morris Neff, president of Baylor University and Governor of Texas, for whom he named his last child. He was a member of the Democratic Party and a Mason. Death and burial Groner died at the age of 66 in a hospital in Marshall on November 8, 1943, following a cerebral hemorrhage. A funeral service was held in Marshall, followed by a second funeral service in Waco, Texas. He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery, Waco.

Plot Billy is a boy who is trying to save a baby kangaroo called Joey after its family is captured and taken to Sydney. Billy travels to Sydney to reunite Joey with his family only to discover that Joey is not the only one who needs to be saved. Linda, the young daughter of the U.S. Ambassador joins Billy as they fight to save Joey. Summary The movie starts off with a boy, Billy McGregor, narrating how he enjoys living in the country side. He introduces his best friends which are Kangaroos, Kim (mother), Wal (father) and their joey, Joey. He uses a remote control camera with an attached camera and stuffed kangaroo. Soon after, the Dixon family drive their car to hunt the kangaroos. Billy notices them and whistles to the kangaroos. They run off before the Dixon's spot them. Using the scopes on their guns they search the area and spot Billy running to get his remote control car then home. Mr Dixon spots him, angry he and his sons give chase, driving towards the boy. Billy gets into a Ute owned by his aboriginal friend, Mick, and escapes. Mr Dixon yells out to him, warning him to stay off his property. He drives home just when his morning alarm goes off, which also feeds his fish through a contraption he made, and successfully sneaks into his room through the window. He meets his mother, Penny, out front of the house who is holding his bag. She tells him that she'll be very angry is she finds out that he was on the Dixon's land again. She does not know he was just there. Billy makes a snide remark that it's better that she doesn't. Mick remarks how crazy Billy is as he grabs his push-bike and rides to school. He arrives late, yet again sneaking in through the window. The teacher is asleep and the class quietly watches as Billy walks to his desk. He starts to carefully pull out his chair, so not to as wake the teacher, when the youngest Dixon slams his hand on his desk, waking the teacher. This leads to the teacher spotting Billy's late arrival and tells him to stay after school. During recess Dixon and another boy start a fight by using ants, surrounded by fellow classmates cheering them on. Billy runs through the crowd, grabs the ants and returns them to the ground just outside of school. Angry, Dixon tackles Billy to the ground and the two begin fighting. A police officer sees the fight and breaks the two apart. Dixon tells the officer about Billy being on their property again this morning. This time they want to press charges. Frustrated, the officer takes him home and chats with his mother about this morning. During their discussion, the officer also reminds Billy's mother that their house will foreclose and they need to come up with $50,000 by October. Penny promises to get the money. The officer suggests that he and Penny become a couple, saying that Billy needs a father then leaves. Later that night a mysterious man arrives at the Dixon house with a livestock truck. The Dixon's have hired him to get rid of the kangaroos. The man grabs a bunch of tranquilize guns and tells them he's taking them to his \\"Kangaroo Kingdom\\". They then shoot every kangaroo except for Joey, who narrowly escaped. Mick and Billy arrive near the scene shortly after it happens because they spotted lightning and went to check it out. Mick notices that there were recently two trucks that drove by, leading to and from the kangaroo area. Mick tells Billy that they were ambushed and taken, showing a dart that was left on the ground. The two hear the whining of Joey. Billy approaches Joey and grabs Billy before he can hop away. He tells Mick that he's got to take him home with him. Mick warns Billy that Penny won't like it. However Billy wins by saying that Joey needs help. Cast *Jamie Croft as Billy McGregorEphraim Katz, Ronald Dean Nolen.

She was one of the University's most generous benefactors with her bequest to the University of almost $1 million upon her death supporting fellowships, prizes, and a teaching facility.  Education  Ethel Harriet Raybould was born on 31 July 1899 in Brisbane, Queensland. She was brought up in Paddington, Brisbane While a student at Petrie Terrace State School, the Head of the school noticed her intelligence and dedication to her studies and she was appointed a Pupil-Teacher at the age of 14, while she completed her senior school studies. She worked as an Assistant Teacher in domestic science studies at Kangaroo Point (Girls) School, Mundubbera State School, Rockhampton High, Domestic Science High, Bulimba State School, and Central Technical College (now QUT). She would attend night classes at the Central Technical College, studying physics, whilst teaching domestic science at the College during the day. In 1921, Raybould won a teacher scholarship to the University of Queensland. She completed her B.A. in mathematics part-time whilst teaching domestic science, and took a year away from her teaching duties to take first class honours in mathematics in 1927. She was awarded the University Gold Medal in 1927, only the 10th person to receive it.  Career  In 1928, Raybould was seconded to the University of Queensland by the Department of Public Instruction, as a temporary lecturer in pure mathematics. In 1931, she was appointed as a permanent lecturer in the Department, one of the few women to be employed as such by UQ. She took her M.A. in 1931 with a thesis in mathematics on \\"The Transfinite and its Significance in Analysis\\". From 1937 to 1939 she undertook postgraduate study at Columbia University She returned to the University as Lecturer and later Senior Lecturer from 1951 to 1955. She retired in 1955 Raybould died in 1987 and left her estate to the University of Queensland.  Legacy  The Ethel Harriet Raybould Trust was established at the University in 1988. Two Fellowships were made available from the money - the Raybould Tutorial Fellowship and the Raybould Visiting Fellowship. The Fellowships provide an opportunity for people to work in a university mathematics department and to develop a project that supports senior secondary mathematics. A prize is also given in her name. The Raybould lecture theatre was constructed with part of the bequest and was opened in 1990. Another portion of the estate went to the Dorothy Hill Engineering and Sciences Library which sits adjacent to the lecture theatre.

An English example is the word while, which, in Middle English, had only the sense of 'at the same time that'. It later acquired the meaning of 'although', indicating a concession on the part of the speaker (\\"While it could use a tune-up, it's a good bike.\\"). This is a pragmatic-semantic process, which means that inherent as well as contextual meanings of the given expression are considered. Subjectification is realized in lexical and grammatical change. It is also of interest to cognitive linguistics and pragmatics.  Subjectivity in language  From a synchronic perspective, subjectivity can be expressed in language in many ways. First of all, the subject is implied in discourse through any speech act. Subjectivity can also be expressed in many grammatical categories, such as person, valence, tense, aspect, mood, evidentials, and deictic expressions more generally.  Subjectification and intersubjectification  The most prominent research on subjectification to date comes from linguists Elizabeth Traugott and Ronald Langacker. In Traugott's view, subjectification is a semasiological process in which a linguistic element's \\"meanings tend to become increasingly based in the speaker's subjective belief state/attitude toward the proposition\\". From Langacker's standpoint, \\"an expression's meaning always comprises both subjectively and objectively construed elements, and it is individual conceptual elements within an expression's meaning that, over time, may come to be construed with a greater degree of subjectivity or objectivity\\". Traugott also discusses \\"intersubjectification\\", alternatively calling subjectivity \\"(inter)subjectivity\\" and subjectification \\"(inter)subjectification\\". She writes, > In my view, subjectification and intersubjectification are the mechanisms by > which: * > a. meanings are recruited by the speaker to encode and regulate attitudes > and beliefs (subjectification), and, * > b. once subjectified, may be recruited to encode meanings centred on the > addressee (intersubjectification). Subjectification occurs in conversation (through speech acts) and has rhetorical aims, and thus implies some degree of intersubjectivity. Intersubjectification does so more blatantly through its \\"development of meanings that explicitly reveal incipient design: the designing of utterances for an intended audience...at the discourse level\\" and requires subjectification to occur in the first place. Traugott and Dasher schematize the process of subjectification elsewhere in the following cline: > non-subjective > subjective > intersubjective  Grammaticalization  Grammaticalization is an associated process of language change in which \\"lexical items and constructions come in certain linguistic contexts to serve grammatical functions, and once grammaticalized, continue to develop new grammatical functions\\". The processes of subjectification and intersubjectification do not necessarily result in grammaticalization, but there is still a strong correlation between the two. As shown in the cline above, subjectification is theorized to be a unidirectional process; in other words, meanings tend to follow the path from left to right and do not develop in the reverse direction. Grammaticalization is likewise suggested to be a unidirectional phenomenon.  Example  Traugott proposes that the epistemic adverb evidently, which initially meant 'from evidence, clearly' and later developed into a subjective adverb, underwent subjectification: * \\"1429 Will Braybroke in Ess.AST 5: 298 Yif thay finde euidently that i haue doon extorcion ** 'If they find from evidence that I have performed extortions' (MED) * 1443 Pecock Rule 56: More euydently fals √æan √æis is, √æer is no √æing ** 'There is nothing more clearly false than this' (MED) * 1690 Locke, Hum. Und. II. xxix: No Idea, therefore, can be undistinguishable from another ... for from all other, it is evidently different ('evident to all', weak subjective epistemic) (OED) * 20th c.?: He is evidently right (in the meaning 'I conclude that he is right'; strong subjective epistemic inviting the inference of some concession or doubt on speaker's part)\\"  References  Category:Historical linguistics Category:Sociolinguistics ","title":"Subjectification (linguistics)"},{"id":"49285261","text":"The Impossible Spy is a 1987 television film based on the true story of an Israeli civilian spy, Eli Cohen, who was recruited into Israel's secret intelligence agency (the Mossad) in the 1960s to become a spy in Damascus.

History Lemgare Lead Mines was formed on Monday 6 April 1846 at The Angel Hotel in Liverpool by way of a Shareholders meeting. The entire working capital of the company was ¬£8,000 and the prospectus was outlined on that date also. The operation was run by Captain James Skimming (1817‚Äì1880),who was also the Mining Agent for the North Eastern Mining Company of Ireland which, along with Lemgare, also encompassed nearby Lisdrumgormley, Coolartragh (Bond Mine) and Hope Mines near Castleblayney. Lemgare Mines were recorded in a GSI report and are recognised as a geologically important site (CGS). The mine features are not really preserved and are insufficiently interesting to require any designation for the site. However, the presence of rare wulfenite means Lemgare warrants CGS status.  Dr Colin Andrew - Report / Information submitted to An Bord Pleanala (Oral Hearing) 13 May 2016  In the townland of Lemgare an adit and three shafts along a strike length of 50 fathoms (95m) were sunk to a depth of 18 fathoms (35m) below adit on a nearly vertical vein by the Consolidated Mines of Bond, Lemgare and Lisdrumgormel (sic) Company of Liverpool under Captain John Skimming commencing in July 1846. The vein is supposed to be the same as that at Annaglogh, located approximately 1km to the SSE, which are marked on the MS. 6‚Ä≥ map of the Geological Survey. Griffith (1861, p. 150) gives Lemgare as a worked mine. Mem. 59, p. 28, regards it as on the continuation of the Annaglogh lode. The Lemgare vein has been profitably worked at Annaglogh. It heads easterly at around 75o, and is joined from the north by another, also heading easterly at around 60o. A shaft at the junction reached rich ore at 17 fathoms (~30m). The lode is supposed to be thrown northwards by a cross-course about 1.2m wide which exists as indicated on the map, as all trace of it is lost farther to the east, it is believed to have been proved 150m farther north. Lemgare Mine was re-opened by Billiton NV in the early 1950s as part of prospecting activities. The adit extended along an unmineralized fault zone for approximately 110m, being connected to surface by a short (4m) ventilation shaft near the portal. Upon entering sandstone wall-rocks the fault became mineralized and some stoping was seen to surface (20m) near the end of the drive which extended but was inaccessible but almost certainly extends below two surface shaft collapse located above. An inclined shaft or winze to indeterminate depth (presumably to 18 fathoms (~35m) was also located along the course of the adit with a 10cm rib of galena on the fault plane.

Purchased by the Navy 23 May 1898 from the Philadelphia Pilots' Association, she was renamed Peoria and commissioned 15 May 1898 with Lt. Thomas W. Ryan in command. Service history Peoria sailed from Key West, Florida, 25 June 1898, escorting two transports, the steamships Florida and Fanita, carrying a joint Cuban-U.S. landing force. The forces on board these steamships consisted of about 200 Cubans under General Emilio N√∫√±ez, 50 troopers of the Tenth United States Cavalry under Lieutenant Johnson, and 17 volunteers under Mr. Winthrop Chanler. There were also on board about 700 tons of munitions of war and supplies, including 4,000 small arms, ammunition, two dynamite field pieces, clothing, etc. A landing was attempted on the south coast of Cuba 29 June, but Spanish army forces were so overwhelmingly strong in this area that another landing point had to be selected. Steaming further east, the transports debarked their troops the following day west of Tunas, at the mouth of the Tayabacao River. As the landing boats reached the beach, a \\"very destructive\\" fire was opened on them by Spanish infantry concealed in camouflaged earthworks. As soon as the enemy's positions could be located, Peoria opened a \\"very rapid and accurate fire,\\" which soon silenced them. For the rest of the day, Peoria's guns prevented the destruction of the outnumbered landing force, her shells having a telling effect on the well- entrenched defenders. The landing force was later safely withdrawn under cover of darkness. Joining gunboat 2 July 1898, Peoria engaged Spanish shore batteries newly entrenched around Tunas. Suffering minor damage, the gunboats silenced the batteries, dismounted some guns, and sank several enemy-flag schooners. On the following day, the expedition was successfully landed at Palo Alto, east of Tunas, where the troops made contact with Cuban insurgent forces. Peoria then escorted the two transports back to Key West. Hostilities in the Caribbean ended 13 August 1898; Peoria continued her peacetime service in the West Indies into 1899, when she sailed for Boston. From 1899 through 1904, Peoria, still classed as an \\"auxiliary gunboat,\\" served on the East Coast. Originally at Boston, she later acted as tender to gunnery training ship before being based at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island. Here she assisted in conducting experiments with improved torpedoes for the growing submarine and destroyer forces as well as for capital ships. On 24 January 1905, Peoria arrived at San Juan, Puerto Rico. For the next six years she operated from San Juan, being redesignated in 1908 as a \\"steel steam tug.\\" In December 1911 she sailed to Charleston, South Carolina, where she was disarmed for local service. The next ten years were devoted to towing and harbor service at Charleston and at Key West, with temporary duty at Guant√°namo Bay and Santo Domingo. Peoria was designated a fleet tug (AT-48) in July 1920; on 30 January 1921 she decommissioned at Key West.

The candidacy was decided 60% by opinion polling, 20% by party's district branches and 20% by each district's district councillors and finalised in a voting in the special party congress on 24 April 2016. Seven candidate lists were decided in which James To, Helena Wong and Wu Chi-wai would seek for re-election in their respective constituencies, while chairwoman Emily Lau, Albert Ho and Sin Chung-kai would retire and succeeded by new faces Lam Cheuk-ting, Roy Kwong, Ted Hui and Andrew Wan. Background The Democratic Party has held intra-party primaries according to the opinion polls in the previous Legislative Council elections. In the previous mechanism, the candidacy was decided 60% by opinion polling, 20% by party's district branches and 20% by each district's district councillors. It was reverted to 8:1:1 after the 2004 Legislative Council election due to the criticism of too much influence of the party. The unprecedented primary proposal was suggested by chairwoman Emily Lau to hold public debates to select the candidacy before the party's voting. Lau said her idea was borrowed from the United States presidential primaries and believed such forums, which would be open to the public and the press, would greatly increase the transparency of the races. The plan of public debates were later cancelled. The annual party congress on 6 December 2015 primarily agreed on the pre- election primary proposal. On the congress, the party's electoral committee suggested to have only one ticket for each geographical constituency while two for the District Council (Second) \\"super seats\\". Former legislator Lee Wing- tat who lost in New Territories West expressed the worry of losing both lists if the party put forward two candidate lists as they did in the 2012 Legislative Council election. Zachary Wong Wai-yin, veteran Yuen Long District Council member suggested to modify the maximum candidate list for New Territories West and New Territories East from one to two, which agreed by 2012 New Territories West candidate Josephine Chan Shu-ying. The motion eventually passed with 62 for 61 against. The idea of fielding two lists in New Territories East and West was eventually dismissed by many as too risky. The pre-election primary mechanism was also reverted to the pre-2004 6:2:2 ratio with 81 for 37 against to help the non-incumbent candidates who is disadvantaged by in the opinion polls compared to the publicity of the incumbent candidates would enjoy. Candidates After the nomination period from 10 to 31 December, a total number of 14 nominations was received. The nominations surprised the media as long-time legislator and incumbent chairwoman Emily Lau decided not to run for an eighth term. The other incumbents who would not seek for re-election included Albert Ho of District Council (Second) and Sin Chung-kai of Hong Kong Island. Another surprise was the two rising stars Southern District Councillors Lo Kin-hei, who is also party's vice chairman, and Henry Chai Man-hon, have both given up contesting the Legislative Council elections.

At the time of his disappearance, Bright resided in Grants Pass, and had been visiting family in Myrtle Point. On August 14, 1986, he attended the Coos County Fair with his younger sister. During the day, the two separated, but he failed to meet her that afternoon at the carnival's ferris wheel. Several witnesses reported seeing Bright forcibly removed from the area by an unknown man, though these sightings were not confirmed. Initially, local law enforcement suspected foul play in Bright's case; however, within the week following his disappearance, several reported sightings of him in the area led detectives to reverse this decision, and he was temporarily classified as a runaway. Numerous theories and rumors circulated in Myrtle Point following Bright's disappearance, which were detailed in a 1989 segment on Unsolved Mysteries. Among them were that he overdosed on a drug at a party and his body had been disposed of by those present; another that he had been shot by local men while swimming in the Coquille River, who attempted to nurse him back to health, but buried his body in a shallow grave after he succumbed to the wound. Law enforcement conducted searches of property in correspondence with these rumors, but found no evidence leading to Bright's discovery. A local man who had babysat Bright during his childhood, Terry Lee Steinhoff, was considered a suspect in his disappearance after Steinhoff was convicted of murdering a 32-year-old woman; there had been reports that Bright was seen in Steinhoff's truck the day he disappeared. However, Steinhoff died in prison in 2007. In August 2011, Bright's family stated they presumed him dead and held a formal memorial service in his memory. , his whereabouts remain unknown. Timeline Background In August 1986, fourteen-year-old Jeremy Bright, a resident of Grants Pass, Oregon, was staying in Myrtle Point with his stepfather and younger sister. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Bright had been raised in Myrtle Point. On Wednesday, August 13, Bright attended the Coos County Fair with his friend Johnny Fish. That day, he called his mother, Diane, from a payphone, and made plans for her to pick him and his 10-year-old sister, S'te (), up in Myrtle Point on August 15. Later the same day, Bright met with his stepfather at a tavern owned by his grandmother, and was given money to attend the fair the next day. This was the last time he was seen by his stepfather or grandmother. Disappearance On Thursday, August 14, Bright attended the fair a second time, now with S'te. The two parted ways at approximately 2 p.m., with Bright planning to meet up with his sister again at 5 p.m. near the ferris wheel on the fairgrounds. He never reappeared. He was last seen wearing a black windbreaker jacket, a red tank top, nylon blue shorts, and a pair of black, size 13 Nike shoes with red shoe laces. The following day, August 15, Bright's mother arrived at his stepfather's house in Myrtle Point to pick up Jeremy and S'te; inside, she found Bright's wallet, watch, and the keys to their Grants Pass apartment. After Bright failed to surface that day among any of his family members, she contacted the authorities and reported him missing. Investigation Law enforcement initially suspected foul play in Bright's disappearance, but on August 23, 1986, one week after his disappearance, it was announced that they were no longer suspecting foul play due to alleged sightings of Bright in the days after he disappeared, some of which were reported as late as August 16 or 17. Law enforcement believed that Bright may have run away with the traveling carnival. Alternately, several individuals (including S'te) had reported prior that they witnessed Bright be \\"forcibly removed\\" by a man near the fairgrounds' ferris wheel between 1:00 and 1:30 p.m. Several rumors circulated at the time of Bright's disappearance: One claimed that Bright, who had a heart murmur, had attended a party and ingested a beer laced with an illegal drug which caused him to fatally overdose. Another, submitted by an anonymous tip through a prison inmate, claimed that Bright had accidentally been shot to death by a group of quarrelsome men while with his friends at a local swimming hole along the Coquille River. Another alternately claimed that Bright had been shot during a target practice. Allegedly, those responsible attempted to nurse Bright back to health at a remote cabin, but he succumbed to his wound. The tipster claimed his body had been buried in the woods in a shallow grave. Police, however, searched the aforementioned cabin and surrounding area, and found nothing. Cecelia Fish, the sister of Bright's friend Johnny, told police that the night of Jeremy's disappearance, she witnessed an unnamed male resident of her apartment building stumble inside the entryway, covered in blood. Numerous wells in the Myrtle Point area were searched following Bright's disappearance after an anonymous tip was submitted in mid-August 1986, which stated Bright's body was in an area well. Another unfruitful tip was given to law enforcement which suggested they \\"follow a road to a concrete bridge in western Nebraska.\\" Another tip was received leading investigators to young man named Jeremy Bright who was working for a circus company in Florida, where many traveling carnivals and circuses relocate during winter months, but the man was determined to be someone else from Colorado who shared the same name. In August 1988, filming began for a segment on Bright‚Äôs disappearance for the series Unsolved Mysteries. The episode aired in January 1989. =Terry Lee Steinhoff= According to some accounts, Bright was last seen in the passenger's seat of a truck owned by a young man named Terry Lee Steinhoff, who at one time babysat Bright. In January 1989, a week after the case was featured on Unsolved Mysteries, Steinhoff was charged in the stabbing death of 32-year-old Patricia Morris and police considered Steinhoff a potential suspect in Bright's disappearance. Steinhoff died in prison in 2007 of a heroin overdose. Continuing investigation Per a 2007 report, Bright's mother has resided in Florida since 1998, but returns to Myrtle Point each summer to assist in search efforts. , Bright remains missing, and is presumed dead by his family. In an obituary for Bright's maternal uncle, who died in Pendleton, Oregon in 2010, it was written that he was preceded in death \\"most probably his oldest nephew, Jeremy Bright who has been a missing child since August, 1986.\\" In August 2011, his family held a formal memorial service in his memory. In October 2016, a pond on private property approximately from Myrtle Point was searched after a tip was received that Bright may have been disposed of there; the search, however, proved fruitless.

By it, Ford granted to Richard Nixon, his predecessor, a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes that he might have committed against the United States as president. In particular, the pardon covered Nixon's actions during the Watergate scandal. In a televised broadcast to the nation, Ford, who had succeeded to the presidency upon Nixon's resignation, explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country and that the Nixon family's situation was \\"a tragedy in which we all have played a part. It could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that, and if I can, I must.\\" After Ford left the White House in 1977, he privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision that suggested that a pardon carries an imputation of guilt and that its acceptance carries a confession of guilt.Kalt, Brian C. (law professor, Michigan State University), Commentary: \\"Five myths about presidential pardons ,\\" June 7, 2018, Chicago Tribune, retrieved February 14, 2019  Pardon  Following the release of the \\"smoking gun\\" tape on August 5, 1974, Nixon's position had become untenable. In his 1979 autobiography, A Time to Heal, Ford wrote about a meeting he had with White House Chief of Staff Alexander Haig before Nixon's resignation. Haig was explaining what he and Nixon's staff thought were Nixon's only options. He could try to ride out the impeachment and fight against conviction in the Senate all the way, or he could resign. His options for resigning were to delay his resignation until further along in the impeachment process to try to settle for a censure vote in Congress or to pardon himself and then resign. Haig told Ford that some of Nixon's staff suggested that Nixon could agree to resign in return for an agreement that Ford would pardon him. On this subject, Ford wrote: In a Washington Post story published the night Ford died, journalist Bob Woodward said that Ford once told Woodward he decided to pardon Nixon for other reasons, primarily the friendship that Ford and Nixon shared. Following Nixon's resignation on August 9, 1974, the Nixons flew to their home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente, California. According to his biographer, Jonathan Aitken, after his resignation, \\"Nixon was a soul in torment.\\" Congress had funded Nixon's transition costs, including some salary expenses but reduced the appropriation from $850,000 to $200,000. With some of his staff still with him, Nixon was at his desk by 7 a.m. with little to do. His former press secretary, Ron Ziegler, sat with him alone for hours each day. Nixon's resignation had not put an end to the desire among many to see him punished. The Ford White House considered a pardon of Nixon, but it would be unpopular in the country. Nixon, contacted by Ford emissaries, was initially reluctant to accept the pardon but then agreed to do so. Ford, however, insisted on a statement of contrition; Nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and should not have to issue such a document. Ford eventually agreed, and on September 8, 1974, he granted Nixon a \\"full, free, and absolute pardon\\" that ended any possibility of an indictment. Nixon then released a statement:  Public response  The Nixon pardon was controversial. Critics derided the move and claimed a \\"corrupt bargain\\" had been struck between the men: that Ford's pardon was granted in exchange for Nixon's resignation, elevating Ford to the presidency. Ford's first press secretary and close friend Jerald terHorst resigned his post in protest after the pardon. The Nixon pardon was a pivotal moment in the Ford presidency. Historians believe that the controversy was one of the major reasons that Ford lost the election in 1976, and Ford agreed with that observation. In an editorial at the time, The New York Times stated that the Nixon pardon was a \\"profoundly unwise, divisive, and unjust act\\" that in a stroke had destroyed the new president's \\"credibility as a man of judgment, candor, and competence\\". Allegations of a secret deal made with Ford, promising a pardon in return for Nixon's resignation, led Ford to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on October 17, 1974. He was the first sitting president to testify before the House of Representatives since Abraham Lincoln. Ford's approval rating dropped from 71% to 50% following the pardon.  Aftermath  House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing regarding his pardon of Richard Nixon. With Nixon's resignation, Congress dropped its impeachment proceedings against him. Criminal prosecution was still a possibility both on the federal and state level. In October 1974, Nixon fell ill with phlebitis. Told by his doctors that he could either be operated on or die, a reluctant Nixon chose surgery, and Ford visited him in the hospital. Nixon was under subpoena for the trial of three of his former aides (John Dean, H. R. Haldeman, and John Ehrlichman) and The Washington Post, disbelieving his illness, printed a cartoon showing Nixon with a cast on the \\"wrong foot.\\" Judge John Sirica excused Nixon's presence despite the defendants' objections. Congress instructed Ford to retain Nixon's presidential papers, which began a three-decade legal battle over the documents that was eventually won by the former president and his estate. Nixon was in the hospital when the 1974 midterm elections were held, and Watergate and the pardon were contributing factors to the Republican loss of 43 seats in the House and three in the Senate. Two years later, lingering public resentment over the pardon was a factor in Ford's narrow loss to Democratic Party nominee Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential election.

To depict its objectives, terms of reference and main operating bodies, the constitution of the Iranian National Commission for UNESCO was drafted in 13 articles and later adopted in the meeting of the Cabinet in 1949, by the proposal of the then Minister of Culture.http://www.unesco.org/ncp/index.php??lc=E&module;=national_commissions&showall;=1#I The Constitution of the Iranian National Commission for UNESCO was revised after the Islamic Revolution to compose 17 articles and 4 notes. This Constitution was submitted to the Cabinet for adoption in 1987 upon approval by the Supreme Council of the Iranian National Commission for UNESCO. Role of the Iranian National Commission for UNESCO ''' Five roles are specifically assigned to the Iranian National Commission for UNESCO Liaising: Foster close cooperation between the Government, GOs and NGOs and individuals with UNESCO and its regional, cluster, field and sub-regional agencies and offices as well as with National Commissions of Member States and United Nations specialised agencies. Advisory: Providing specialised advice to the Government and relevant bodies and organizations on UNESCO‚Äôs action areas and modalities for cooperation with UNESCO in implementing relevant programmes.

It was built from 1887 to 1888. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Currajong is a large, single-storeyed timber residence which was built between 1887 and 1888 for Alfred MacKenzie who was a manager of the Australian Joint Stock Bank and had been a pioneer of the sugar industry in north Queensland. It was initially situated amongst other suburban villas in the then fashionable area along the road to Charters Towers. In 1885, subsection 4 of section 3 of portion 2A parish of Coonambelah was purchased from the estate of Robert Towns by Gilbert Francis Elliott. The following year he sold the land to his brother-in-law, Alfred Peter MacKenzie. In 1870, MacKenzie, together with his brother and sister, had pioneered sugar growing at Gairlock, near the present town of Ingham. It was not successful and MacKenzie worked for the AJS Bank at Charters Towers before being appointed to the branch in Townsville. At sometime during the period between September 1887, when MacKenzie was living in Stanton Hill, and during October 1888 when he wrote to the Divisional Board from his new property on the Fullham Road, Currajong was built. In 1889, MacKenzie was transferred to Toowoomba and the property was sold in 1890 to Alfred Hunt. Hunt had major interests in mining and had been a member of the partnership which owned the Great Cumberland Mine at Georgetown. This had been sold in 1885 at a great profit and the proceeds financed investments in the pastoral industry, including Carpentaria Downs. Currajong is said to have been named after seedlings brought by Hunt from Carpentaria Downs to plant around the house. While in Townsville, Hunt was a director of the North Queensland Meat Export and Agency Company, the Townsville Newspaper Company (publisher of the Townsville Daily Bulletin and the North Queensland Herald) and the Townsville Gas and Coke Company. He died in 1901 and his widow, Mary, continued to live at Currajong until she died in 1926. In March 1926 the house was sold to John Joseph Fanning who was well known in business circles as the North Queensland manager of the National Mutual Life Assurance Company. He was also an identity in racing circles and rode as an amateur jockey and show rider. He owned horses and was a highly regarded judge of them. During his day, the stables at Currajong were well known. He was transferred to Brisbane in 1929 and died in 1931, whereon Currajong passed to James and Jessie Ferguson, whose background was in the pastoral industry. They occupied the house until the outbreak of World War II, when it was requisitioned by the RAAF as a Medical Receiving Station. In order to convert the building to a medical facility, some changes were made to the layout of the rooms, although the form of the building was not changed. As the core consisted of two rooms on either side of a central hall, two of which were linked by an open arch, the wall between two bedrooms on the other side was removed to create two large wards. An operating theatre was added and toilets and showers were installed. Although the building was initially intended to act as a training centre, it saw urgent use in 1942 when it received casualties from the fighting at Milne Bay. In December 1944, it was decided that the medical centre was no longer needed and the staff vacated the house by January of the following year. Mr and Mrs Ferguson did not return to the house after the war and it was purchased by the Redemptionist Fathers for use as a monastery in 1945. In 1955 the property passed to the Sisters of Mercy and the buildings of the new Mater Hospital were erected in the grounds over the next few years. Currajong, however, remained in use as a residence for the Sisters. In 1978, the land on which Currajong stood was needed for the expansion of the hospital and the house was scheduled for demolition. A major effort by the local branch of the National Trust of Queensland, Townsville City Council and the Sisters of Mercy enabled the house to be saved. A Federal grant was also secured to enable its transference to a new site at Castling Street, West End.  Description  Currajong is now located at 5 Castling Street, West End as part of a museum complex which includes a miner's cottage and a 1920s farmhouse. Currajong backs onto the street, overlooking Council parkland. It is a large, single storeyed timber dwelling raised on low brick piers. It has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron. The house is surrounded by wide verandahs supported by timber posts with decorative brackets and cross braced balustrading. There is a timber staircase with matching balustrading at the side of the house. The main stair to the front entrance is cement rendered and curves to widen at ground level. The house contains seven rooms, two with verandah annexes. The core consists of four rooms paired on either side of a hall. An arched opening divides the rooms which originally were dining and drawing rooms. It is interpreted as a conjectural Townsville interior furnished to demonstrate the lifestyle of an affluent family of the period.  Heritage listing  Currajong was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Currajong is significant for demonstrating the lifestyle of several families who were prominent in the development of north Queensland.

It was built from 1921 to 1939. It is also known as Townsville and District Education Centre and Memorial Gates. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 October 1998.  History  The former Townsville West State School, designed by the Queensland Government Architects Office was opened on 10 June 1939. Costing ¬£28,200, the school was built during the Depression by local workers employed under the Unemployment Relief Scheme. The school building of 1937-9 is the second of three Townsville West State Schools constructed within the same school grounds. The first, constructed in 1886-7, was one of the earliest public schools of Townsville. Early settlement in Townsville spread along the beach in the present North Ward area, with the commercial centre located along the bank of Ross Creek in the present Flinders Street East area. As the town developed settlement spread south-west along the track to the hinterland which was an extension of Flinders Street. By 1868 the West End Cemetery had been established along the track in the area known as West End. By 1878 the Carrier Arms Hotel, a soap and candle factory in Morris St, the Townsville Gas and Coke Co and the Townsville Brewery Co had sprung up in the new suburb. The North Queensland Pastoral and Agricultural Association was formed on 19 December 1879 and the stockyards and ring were constructed soon after in their present location on Ingham Road. West End, along with neighbouring suburbs, saw a second wave of population growth after the completion of railway facilities in the North Yards in the early 1880s. Along Ingham Road the West End Hotel (1885) and St Mary's Catholic Church (1888) both survive from this period. The rising population triggered the need for a school in West End. On 22 April 1884 the Mayor, Henry Barbenson le Touzel Hubert, made an application for a school reserve to be set aside in the West End area. A reserve of four acres was established with some of the land being excised from the nearby cemetery reserve (West End Cemetery). Because of the growth of the suburb it was estimated that the school would need to accommodate 400 students. By 11 January 1886 tenders had been called for the construction of a timber school building, out-buildings and a head teacher's residence. Townsville West State School was built with government funding and a one-fifth subscription from the local community as required under the State Education Act of 1875. The school was opened on 21 March 1887. By 1919 Townsville West was the third largest school in Queensland with an enrolment of 1150 students and a staff of thirty-three. Gladys Moncrieff, one of Australia's most famous singers, attended the school during the first years of the twentieth century. The school has a perpetual trophy in her name for singing at the Townsville Juvenile Eisteddfod. Opening of the memorial gates, 1921 The school has also honoured students and teachers who served, and in some cases died, during WWI, by erecting both honour boards in the entrance foyer, and memorial gates. Because both memorials contain the same number of names it is thought that the honour boards were installed soon after the war. However, in 1921 the school community apparently decided to remember their past students in a more tangible way by erecting War Memorial Gates at the entrance to the school. A fete was held and ¬£542 was raised, of which ¬£430 was used to construct the gates which stand at the main school entrance on Ingham Rd. 200 names inscribed on marble tablets are attached to the arched gateway. This memorial was dedicated on Friday 9 December 1921. Close to Anzac Day each year the school still holds a ceremony to honour past students who have served in the armed services in both world wars and other military conflicts. By the 1930s the area had grown to the extent that the original school building was seen as inadequate. The old building was thought to be poorly ventilated and lacking light, so it was decided to construct the present building. Some of the old school buildings were pulled down and the timber was used to construct hospitals on Palm and Fantome Islands. The head teacher's House was sold and re-located at 17 Truscott Street, Garbutt and the kindergarten building was given to the Townsville Grammar School. On 18 September 1937, the Jubilee Year of Townsville West State School, the foundation stone of the new school was laid by the Hon Maurice Hynes, MLA, Secretary for Labour and Industry. Plans were prepared in the Queensland Government Architect's Office of the Department of Public Works. The new building, which cost ¬£28,200, was opened by the Hon Harry Bruce, MLA, Minister for Public Works and Public Instruction, on 10 June 1939. The Chief Architect at the time was Andrew Baxter Leven (1885-1966). Leven was born, educated and worked as an Inspector of Works in Scotland before migrating to Australia. From 1910 to 1951 he was employed by the Queensland Government Works Department and was Chief Architect and Quantity Surveyor from 1933 to 1951. Other members of the office involved in design were Frederick Thomas Jellett and Harold James Parr. Thirty brick schools of similar design to Townsville West were constructed in Queensland during the Depression. They were built as part of a Queensland Government initiative to provide impetus to the flagging economy through an active capital works program. The school was constructed of brick and concrete. The whole of the ground floor, all corridors, hat and cloak rooms, and staircases were built in concrete, all other floors were made of hardwood. The building contained twenty-one classrooms situated on the first and second floors. 832 students could be accommodated in the new classrooms. There was also a woodwork room and a dressmaking classroom on the first floor, accommodating twenty students each. A head teacher's room, two staff teacher's rooms and hat and cloak rooms were also provided. Some of the classrooms on each of the first and second floors had folding partitions. Storerooms and toilets for male and female teachers, boys and girls and infants were located on the ground floor. The remainder of the ground floor space was utilised as play space. A complete drainage system was installed and the school grounds were graded and leveled. First floor facilities in the new school building allowed for the commencement of domestic science and manual training. It was the only school in Townsville with such facilities and students from other areas visited the school once a week to receive tuition. At the beginning of 1942 Townsville became a restricted military zone with up to 90,000 military personnel stationed in the city and surrounding district. Townsville West State School, like many other schools, was commandeered by the military and a first aid post and convalescence ward were established on the first floor. Classes for Volunteer Aid Detachments (VADs) were held, dressmaking classes for the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force (WAAAF), first aid classes, various classes for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as well as community meetings. In September 1942, the 5th Australian Transport Unit under the command of Major Douglas, camped in the grounds under the fig trees at the rear of the school. These units used the school water supply and shared the ablutions with hospital patients. During 1943 the medical facilities were moved out of the school. Some school classes reopened from 3 August and all classes were operating again by October 1943. However, the site was not completely vacated by the Australian Army until 31 March 1946. Student enrolments peaked at about 1000 after the war and then began to decline. The decline was exacerbated by an Education Department policy decision to move Grade Eight from primary to secondary school in 1963. To boost numbers the school began accepted both physically and intellectual disabled students after 1957. The school was seen as specially suited to the needs of these students because of the domestic science and manual arts facilities. However, the location of these facilities on the first floor and the toilets on the ground floor created difficulties for disabled students. Eventual, all students and most school activities were moved to new school buildings on Wilson Street, behind the 1939 building. When the Townsville Teachers College opened in 1969, West End State School was utilised as a Demonstration School for student teachers. The building withstood the devastation of Cyclone Althea which hit Townsville on 24 December 1971. In the aftermath of the cyclone the Home Science room was opened to the community so that people could cook their meals. The Salvation Army also used the school as a relief centre, where they made bread, milk and blocks of ice available for several weeks after the cyclone. In 1975 the Townsville and District Education Centre (TADEC) was established in one room of the school and by 1981 had expanded into half the building. TADEC, which is still operating from the building, is one of seven such centres in Queensland. It was established as a community education resource for teachers, parents and community groups and for the past twenty- three years has made a significant contribution to community education in North Queensland. In 1977 an environmental study area was established in the school grounds at the initiative of students and teachers. The area received many honours including a Greening of Australia Project award in 1987. The school grounds also contain a number of trees including large banyans, figs and blackbeans, some of which bear small plaques. The fig trees have been in the grounds since before the 1920s and mark the site of WWII military camp. Two large trees situated on either side of the Memorial Gates may be related to the First Arbour Day. The first floor corridor contains several photographs, including a depiction of the memorial gates, a gathering of past students for the 50 year Jubilee in 1937, and an award winning choral group. The original school bell, which is over one hundred years old, hangs in its original position above the main entrance gates. Today the building is still utilised by the Townsville and District Education Centre, a library, conference rooms, a creche and kindergarten, manual arts and home science facilities and is a venue for a community playgroup.  Description  The former Townsville West State School is a rectangular brick building of three stories, located at the intersection of Ingham Road and Sturt Street, Townsville, about two kilometres from the city centre. The building faces south addressing Ingham Road which becomes the highway north of the city. Opposite the building running parallel to the road is the northern railway line. Set into a recess in the Ingham Road fence are the Memorial Gates. The gateway is a free-standing rendered masonry archway with a pair of wrought iron gates below. The archway has an elliptical arch with scored voussoirs, a coved cornice and scored pilasters to either side. \\"Their name liveth for ever\\" stands in relief on the cornice, with the dates \\"1914\\" and \\"1919\\" on each pilaster. The ironwork of the gates includes the words \\"Soldiers Memorial Gate of Honour\\". Mounted within the returns of the archway are two white marble tablets entitled \\"Honour Roll, Townsville West State School\\". Each tablet is inscribed with about 100 names, some marked with the letters \\"D\\", \\"K\\", \\"P\\" and \\"W\\". Behind the gateway on either side are a pair of large trees, possibly blackbeans. The former Townsville West State School is a symmetrical building, with a linear plan on an east-west access. At the centre of the southern facade is the projecting bay of the main entry and near either end are two smaller breakfronts with secondary entries. The roof is hipped and clad in painted corrugated fibrous cement sheet, with a timber fleche at its centre. The rear or northern elevation also has two breakfronts near either end which mark the linear plan, three-storey height, and Georgian-style symmetry, proportion and massing make the building prominent within its largely domestic context. The external walls of the two upper levels of the building are face brick, punctuated by pilasters with rendered capitals and bases and a rendered cornice. Between the pilasters are paned casement windows with awning lights above. The two upper levels sit on the rendered base of the Ground Floor which has arcades and smaller window openings. The central bay of the southern facade is emphasised as the main entry to the building by the triangular pedimented gable, the rendered entry door surround, the double stairway and projecting further than the end bays. Also mounted over the main entry door is the school bell. In the entry foyer on the First Floor are brass plaques commemorating the opening of the building in 1939 and the centenary of the school in 1987. In the corridor near the entry hang two large timber honour boards entitled \\"Roll of Honour, Teachers and Pupils who fought for the Empire in the Great War\\". Each board has some 100 names, some marked with \\"K\\" and \\"W\\". Also in this corridor hang several historical photographs relating to the school, including a gathering of past students for the 50 year Jubilee of the school in 1937. The First and Second Floors contain a series of classrooms opening onto a corridor running the length of the building on the southern side. There are panelled doors with toplights and double-hung windows between the classrooms and the corridor. The high ceilings, regular external windows and internal windows and doors provide substantial natural light and cross ventilation. The floors to the classrooms are timber, whilst the floors to the corridors, stairs and utilities are concrete. The two stairways, near either end of the building, have steel balustrades, cast newels and timber handrails. Many of the classrooms of the two upper levels are divided by panelled folding timber partitions. The four classrooms at the centre of the first floor level may all be opened to form a small auditorium with a stage at its eastern end. At the far eastern end of that level is the home science room. The ground floor level includes covered play areas, ablutions, storage areas and a workshop. The foreground of the former Townsville West State School building is lawn, pathways and carpark, with vehicular access from Wilson Street to the east. To the west of the building fronting Ingham Road is a small vegetated lot which includes a number of native plants. The building is separated from the present school to the north by a level grassed area which has low retaining walls and remnants of the tennis courts. The present school is a number of timber and transportable buildings beneath several large banyan trees, sited near the base of Castle Hill. To the west of the school playground is the West End Cemetery.  Heritage listing  Townsville West State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 October 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Opened in 1939, the former Townsville West State School, is demonstrative of a government scheme, the Unemployment Relief Scheme, implemented to assist the unemployed throughout Queensland, by means of generating work projects, during the Depression of the 1930s. The school, constructed during an era of substantial building activity, is one of four surviving, intact schools of the period in North Queensland, including Ayr State High School. The former Townsville West State School Memorial Gates, constructed in 1921, are an example of a relatively small number of this type of memorial. War Memorials are important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as they are representative of a recurrent theme that involved most communities throughout the state. They provide evidence of an era of widespread Australian patriotism and nationalism, particularly during and following the First World War. Two timber honour boards located in the a corridor of the building also list names of former students and teachers who served in WWI. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former Townsville West State School Memorial Gates, constructed in 1921, are an example of a relatively small number of this type of memorial. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a fine example of a two-storeyed Inter-war brick school. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Due to its massing and scale, the building is a landmark in the suburban streetscape, in keeping with the Queensland Government's 1930s policy to raise the educational status of primary education through the construction of well designed, imposing buildings. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building has a strong association with the local community. The grounds on which the former Townsville West State School is built has been the site for over a century of public education for the West End and Townsville community. The building has also been the centre of a variety of community activity in the past, including the use, during WWII, of the building and grounds for a military encampment and convalescent ward and for community meetings and classes. During the emergency period following Cyclone Althea in 1971, the building was utilised as a community relief centre.

It was built from 1846 to 1864. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. The homestead is the main building of the 318 acre Taabinga Station, and now operates as a homestay, providing bed and breakfast accommodation to tourists, as well as regular farm tours.  History  The Taabinga run was originally taken up by the Haly brothers in the 1840s and the main residence was developed during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the outbuildings on the homestead site were built during the 1890s and early 1900s when Arthur Youngman was owner of the property. The explorations of Henry Stuart Russell in the Burnett district during the early 1840s mark a watershed in the pastoral history of Queensland. Following the closure of Moreton Bay as a penal colony, Russell led the search for land north of Brisbane and the Darling Downs. He first arrived in Queensland in 1840 to stay with cousins on the Darling Downs and by 1842 he was the first European to pass through what was later to become Taabinga. Russell's expeditions in the Burnett had opened a district of rich grazing and agricultural land, and in 1843 he took up Burrandowan run on the Borne River as a sheep station. Other squatters soon followed Russell and it was brothers Charles Robert and William O'Grady Haly who first settled on Taabinga station. The Haly brothers had arrived in Australia from Newfoundland in 1838 and settled on the Hunter River before moving to the Gwydir River. From there they assembled a team of men and some 5,000 sheep and travelled north through the Logan district during the early 1840s in search of land. Shearing records indicate the Haly brothers had settled Taabinga station by 1846, at which time it was an established sheep property covering 305 square miles. Despite their early occupation of the land, the Haly brothers did not apply for a lease over Taabinga until June 1850, which was granted on 10 February 1852 for a term of 14 years. By 1853, Charles Haly was at Tamrookum in the Logan district, where he married Rosa Harpur and was to remain until at least 1854. During this time it is most likely that either William Haly or a superintendent was managing Taabinga station. When William Haly returned to England in 1859, Charles became sole lessee of Taabinga and the following year was elected to the first Queensland Legislative Assembly as the member for the Burnett. In 1863 he acquired a freehold over 314 acres of the run and remained at the property until 1875 when he moved to Dalby. While documentary evidence for the physical development of Taabinga is non-existent, Hector Munro, who was the son of George Munro, onetime manager of Boondooma station, and who was a friend of the Haly family, described the first structure at Taabinga as a hut: > \\"built with bark, then perpendicular slabs with a ground floor and bark > roof. The house known as the Boss's residence was built with pit saw and > timber foundation logs of wood, squared on one side with walls of horizontal > slabs and floor in boards of pit saw and roof shingles\\". From these rudimentary structures the homestead site gained more permanent buildings. It is claimed that the first part of the main residence, which still stands today, was constructed during the 1840s and was developed through to the 1850s. According to the Alford family, who later acquired Taabinga and whose papers have been published as Alford Family Notes, Charles Haly began residing at Taabinga with his family in the late 1850s, just prior to becoming sole lessee of the property. An article in The Queenslander in 1924 indicates the continued development of the homestead site in this period: \\"Sixty-seven years ago where now stands this beautiful, and complete home, was little better than wild, crude bush\\". The freeholding of a portion of the Taabinga run by Charles Haly in 1863 would seem to indicate the existence of the main residence by this time. Its western wall is built from locally quarried sandstone and the cedar was obtained from the Bunya Mountains while the timber for the hardwood floors was taken from the property itself. At much the same time that the main residence was being constructed it is believed that the Halys also built the stockyards and stables. The stables, which remain well preserved, are located on an adjoining lot, however the stockyards were damaged in a fire during the 1950s. On 27 March 1875, Charles Haly was preparing to sell his interests in Taabinga and the Brisbane Courier reported he had \\"received what is considered a good offer . . . and it is not unlikely that the station may shortly change hands\\". Two months later the Brisbane Courier reported that Taabinga, with some 3,000 head of stock, was just about \\"ready to hand over. A short time after, it is understood, Mr Haly and family will take their departure from the station\\". By October 1875, James Henderson, Boulton Molineaux and Thomas Littlejohn had acquired both the leasehold and freehold portions of Taabinga. The following year the leasehold was transferred to Thomas Littlejohn and Thomas Alford, and Richard Symes Alford, brother of Thomas, was charged with managing the property. Thomas Alford was originally from Drayton and by the mid-1870s had an interest in Coochin Coochin station, where he lived, as well as Gwambagwine station. At the time of Haly's departure from Taabinga station both sheep and cattle were on the run, but Alford's prime interest in the property was in expanding the cattle breeding programmes of Coochin Coochin and Gwambagwine. In 1883, Thomas was registered as the sole owner of the leasehold and freehold portions of Taabinga and moved there to live after his brother, Richard, relinquished the position as manager of the station. Thomas remained at Taabinga until a riding accident in 1887 forced him to sell his interests in the estate. Arthur Youngman, who was a close friend of Richard Symes Alford, took up the leasehold and freehold portions of Taabinga in 1888 from Thomas Alford. Youngman was born in Melbourne in 1862 and after an abortive attempt to study medicine he moved to Queensland to work as a jackaroo. He was relatively inexperienced at pastoral life, having gained his first taste at Rawbelle station before purchasing Taabinga, but benefited from the continued employment of John William Walters who had served as head stockman at Taabinga since the mid-1870s. Youngman was also able to call on Richard Symes Alford to return to Taabinga as a bookkeeper. Youngman built a house, once known as The Lodge, to accommodate Alford and his family, but this was not the only improvement made to the property during Youngman's time there. An article on Youngman in the Queensland Trustees Quarterly Review in March 1951 noted that when \\"he first took possession of Taabinga he began to improve the property by a policy of ringbarking the heavily-timbered country, by the planting of artificial grasses . . . and by subdividing the large paddocks into smaller and more workable areas\\". Taabinga Homestead, circa 1927 A programme of rebuilding and renovation during the 1890s and early 1900s resulted in the homestead being modernized and expanded, as noted in The Queenslander in 1924: \\"Modern in all comforts and conveniences, the home (which has been added to of late years) is distinctly charming in its simple, old-fashioned architecture\\". Most of the outbuildings also date from Youngman's time at Taabinga and they remain in a well-conserved state as part of the homestead complex. These include a garage, store and meat house for which Brisbane architects HW Atkinson and Charles McLay called tenders in March 1909. Similarly, the gardens that surround the main residence are today a reminder of Youngman's improvements to Taabinga. The Brisbane Courier in 1932 described the gardens as \\"one of the most glorious . . . that any one could possibly wish to see. In it Mr Youngman has personally expended much energy, and he has every reason to be proud of his achievement\\". While the homestead block remained unaffected, the increasing demand for land in the Burnett district had reduced the Taabinga run during Youngman's time there. Early resumptions had occurred during Thomas Alford's tenure, reducing the size of the leased land from the original 305 square miles to 154 square miles at the time of Youngman's succession. Further resumptions occurred in 1901 and 1907, and in August 1911 the government resumed the whole of the run under the Crown Land Act of 1897. Youngman was compensated ¬£11,745 being the value of the resumed land, improvements and legal costs. Youngman remained at Taabinga until his death in 1935. He was buried in the cemetery located within the homestead complex, and title to the property was held in trust by Frederick Septimus Lee, Queensland Trustees and Youngman's wife, Florence Daphne Youngman. In 1958, Roderick Gordon Graham replaced Lee as one of the trustees of the estate and following Graham's death in 1961 Dorothy Foster McWilliam was appointed in his place. When Daphne Youngman died in 1975 her remains were buried in a plot next to her husband on the homestead site. The property was further subdivided in the 1980s, with the homestead portion remaining in the Youngman family and operated as a professional homestay.  Description  Side view, 2002 The Taabinga Homestead Complex is situated on Old Taabinga Road, off the Bunya Highway about north-east of Kumbia and south-west of Kingaroy. It consists of a main homestead building, a number of associated outbuildings, the remnants of an extensive, carefully tended garden, a tennis court, and a small cemetery. The outbuildings include a kitchen, dairy, meat house, carpenter/blacksmith's workshop, and grain store, as well as garages, cottages, and stables. The main approach to the complex, and the front face of the property, is from the east. The outbuildings have been located in a zone to the west behind the homestead building.  House  The single-storey house is made of two gable-roofed sections, with broken-back extensions. Together they form a long, rectangular plan shape, the long sides of which are oriented toward the east and west. The northern section of the house is wider than the other by approximately . This additional width extends to the west, on the rear elevation. The roof to the southern section of the house is slightly lower than the other, though its steep pitch is the same. A broken- back skirt of roof is created on its three exposed sides. On the eastern elevation, the long plane of roof set at a secondary pitch continues past the northern segment of the house, making a separate verandah roof. This roof bends to meet the wall of the first storey lookout, which nestles under the high ridge of the gable roof. A sandstone chimneystack projects from the site where the two main gable roofs join, near their ridgelines. Two sandstone chimneystacks project through the line where the roof changes pitch on the western side of the northern section of the house. On this elevation, where the two parts meet, the roof to the northern section is stepped back. This marks a narrow corridor and stair that separates the two sections. All roof planes are clad in corrugated iron, and unless otherwise stated this is the case with the roofs of other buildings in the complex. A large proportion of the exterior walls to the northern section of the house are constructed of sandstone ashlar that is approximately deep. The sills and flat arches to windows and doors in these walls are also made of sandstone. The windows on the western elevation are timber-framed casements with a total of 3 lights in each sash, while the doors are five-panelled. In the short corridor between the two sections of the house, the ashlar is topped with weatherboard cladding. The exterior walls to the east and north-facing verandah areas are clad in wide chamferboards and have exposed timber framing. The northern gable end of this section of the house, and its first-storey lookout are clad in weatherboards. The lookout is open to the east and north, and its rails and balusters are timber. Fitted above these, framing each view, are simple, single-board timber brackets and valances. The verandah roof is supported by a series of square timber posts, which have simple timber capitals and are scored on their outward-facing sides. A scalloped fascia runs the length of the verandah roof's edge. The sloping ceiling to the verandah is lined with single-beaded, tongue-and-groove boards, while the floor is clad in shot-edge timber boards. Each double door opening onto the verandah has a low waist, 4 lights in each leaf, and a 2-paned fanlight. The exterior walls to the southern section of the house are largely clad in chamferboards, except for a small section on the western facade, which is clad in wide, vertical timber slabs. A square verandah area occupies the south-east corner of this section of the house. The windows on the eastern facade are casements, except for a fixed pane of glass separating two double doors with upper lights. Two large windows on the southernmost end of this elevation have low sills when compared with the remaining ones. They each have three sashes, which are then divided into 6 lights. The remaining casement windows each have three sashes with only single lights. On the southern facade, the three windows match those described as having comparatively low sill heights, except they feature four sashes rather than three. A wide section of the western facade steps back towards the interior of the structure, separating the chamferboard and slab claddings. This stepped section is clad in wide, vertical timber boards.  House Interior  The southern section of the house is divided into two large rooms by a timber bi-fold door. The ceiling is coved and lined with tongue-and- groove timber boards. A long timber beam supported by timber posts supports the change in pitch of the roof. The single fireplace has a timber mantel and the wall it opens out of appears to be plastered. The northern section of the house is divided into a number of rooms. Two large ones abut the eastern verandah, sit under the main gable, and are divided by a set of 6-panel timber bi-fold doors. Each room has a fireplace with a simple timber mantelpiece and curved back. The walls are lined with fibrous cement sheeting, which have beaded joints. They were originally lined with paper on hessian. The walls of the chimneys are painted stone. The ceilings are lined with wide, single- beaded tongue-and-groove boards, with timber cornices. Under the secondary pitch of the roof, facing west, there are a number of bedrooms. A corridor, parallel with the stairs, is situated at the southern end of this wing. It allows entry to the larger rooms behind. It is believed that the stairs situated between the two parts of the house, lead to a corridor running under the main ridge to the upper storey lookout.  Kitchen  The kitchen building is located a few metres to the west of the sandstone section of the house, with a gable-roofed walkway connecting the two. It has a hipped roof with broken-back wings along the northern and southern sides. The ridgeline runs perpendicular to that of the house's gable roofs. The exterior walls are clad in a combination of vertical slabs and weatherboards. On the eastern facade is a double-hung sash window with hand-drawn glass, and on the opposite facade there is a bank of casements, possibly dating from late 1900s to early 1920s. To the south, a square open section, occupies the middle of the kitchen's slab facade. A single board door opens onto the interior from here. A french door with 8 lights in each sash opens off the kitchen onto a semi- enclosed verandah area on the northern facade. On the interior, the floors are covered with linoleum, the walls are lined with wide, single-beaded tongue- and-groove boards, and the ceiling is unlined, revealing the original shingles. The roof beams are adzed and the battens are pit-sawn.  Dairy  The dairy is located about to the west of the house and to the south of the kitchen building. It has a high-pitched pyramid roof clad in tiles (scale), the deep overhang of which is supported by simple timber braces. The sloping eaves are lined with wide, single-beaded tongue-and-groove boards. On the exterior, the walls are clad to sill-height with weatherboards, and above this with panels of galvanised metal louvres set in timber frames. The square-plan structure sits on a concrete slab-on-ground, and 2 ventilation blocks are fitted in each wall at slab level. Inside, the walls are lined with timber workbenches, and below and above the metal louvres are single-beaded tongue- and-groove boards. The ceiling is lined with shot-edge timber boards.  Cottage 1 (Single Men's Quarters)  This building was originally located on the other side of the stables, but was moved during the Second World War to accommodate women and children evacuees. It is currently located approximately from the south-east corner of the house. The external walls are clad in weatherboards and the windows are casements.  Meat House  The meat house is located in a cluster of buildings over to the west of the house, and adjacent to the tennis court. It has a short-ridge hipped roof, the fourth, north-eastern side of which has been cut back. On the remaining three sides the roof forms an overhang about deep that is supported by timber posts. On the south-western elevation the edge of the roof is finished with a half-metre wide, solid valance of shot-edge timber boards. The building sheltering under the roof sits on a concrete slab-on-ground. The walls are clad in weatherboards to a height off the ground of approximately . A timber sill separates this from the fine steel mesh, which covers the timber frame above. There are double board doors on the north-eastern elevation. Inside the meat house is divided into two rooms by a wall made with steel mesh fixed to a timber frame. There is a single board door in this wall, which extends only to the height of the top plates of the exterior walls. While the underside of the corrugated iron roof is exposed in the first room entered, in the second there is a tongue-and-groove timber board ceiling. A step in the slab also separates the two spaces. The butcher's blocks are still in place.  Carpenter/Blacksmith's Workshop  This building has a gabled roof, and is located about to the south-east of the meat house. The walls are clad in weatherboards, and there is a large opening in its southern elevation. Inside the floor is dirt and the sawn frame is exposed on each gable end and to the roof. On a wall that divides the room lengthways, timber boards are fitted vertically to the height of the top plates of the exterior walls. There are two casement windows in the northern elevation, each with 3 lights in each sash. Large double board doors open out of the building's eastern elevation. The forge appears to be made from a ship's tank, and the anvil and bellows are also still in place.  Garage and Chauffeur's Residence  This building is located about west of the blacksmith's. In plan it is L-shaped, and gable roofs project along each wing. A part of the roof on the shorter wing has been extended to cover a strong room made with concrete walls and a steel door. The walls are clad in weatherboards and the windows are predominantly timber double-hung sashes with two lights in each sash. The entire building sits on a concrete slab-on-ground. Inside the garage occupies the long wing. There is a single room allocated for the driver, and its walls and ceiling are lined with tongue-and-groove timber boards. There are timber board doors. The garage was built to accommodate Arthur Youngman's Rolls Royce, which was said to be the second bought in Queensland. There is a greasing pit for the car nearby, with a simple curved roof supported on timber posts.  Store/Cottage 2  This building is located about to the south-east of the blacksmith's. It is timber framed, sits on low stumps and has a gabled roof. The walls are clad in weatherboards. The building was originally the store and the storekeeper's residence.  Grain Shed  The grain shed is located about to the south- west of the blacksmith's. It was originally used to store grain in bulk; however it is now used as a theatre. It has a low-pitched gable roof and sits on low timber stumps. The walls are clad in weatherboards and the awning windows are made of timber boards. Entry is gained via a short flight of timber stairs on the north-eastern facade. Inside the floor is lined with timber tongue-and-groove boards. The seating was provided by the Princess Cinema in Mount Gravatt, Brisbane. Adjacent to the north-west of this building is an open gable-roofed barn supported by rough timber poles.  Stables  The stables are located about to the west of the grain shed and hay barn (on an adjoining allotment). It is a long narrow structure with a low-pitched gable roof. The wall and roof framing is constructed of timber stumps and poles, and vertical slabs are fitted in between those to the walls. Its north- eastern facade has a single opening, while the opposing one has a number of them. A number of stalls are separated from the western yard with rails. The three sections the building is divided into on the interior are made with top plate height slab walls.  Cemetery  The cemetery is located over to the east of the homestead, and can be accessed via a secondary track. One grave, with an elaborate headstone and metal railings surrounding it, is that of two Haly children who died in 1858. They were Anastasia (1 year) and Charles (13 months), who died within weeks of each other suggesting they may have been twins. Another grave belongs to Matilda Baker (3 years). The headstone records that she died in 1864, and was the child of George and Bridgetta Baker who were employed by the Halys. Another early grave belongs to a stockman, Henry Weldon, who died at age 19 years in 1869. The headstone's inscription reads \\"Boast not thyself of tomorrow for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth\\". As they are weathering, small metal, inscribed plaques have been affixed to these headstones by members of the Leu family. Arthur Youngman, who died in 1935, and his wife Daphne who died in 1975, are both buried here. The cemetery is currently in use, as later family members have been interred there. The current owners tell a story, which suggests that 8 graves marked by local boulders belong to Aboriginal children.  Gardens  Gardens, 1927 There appear to be remnants of the gardens established by Arthur Youngman. On either side of the entry to the homestead complex, to the north-east of the house, stand two large palms. The area to the east of the house is covered in lawn. A Bunya pine stands to the north of the house. Adjacent to the south- western corner of the house stands another tall pine.  Heritage listing  Taabinga Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Taabinga station was established in the 1840s by the Haly brothers in the wake of Henry Stuart Russell's exploration of the Burnett district in 1842. The development of Taabinga is an important part of the pastoral history of Queensland, and the site stands as testimony to the emergence of Taabinga as one of the earliest principal pastoral holdings in the Burnett district. The physical expansion of the site, especially during the 1890s and early 1900s, reflects the growth of the Queensland rural economy during this period. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The principal built elements of Taabinga include the main residence built between the 1840s and 1850s, as well as the kitchen; dairy; single men's quarters; meat house; carpenter/blacksmith's workshop; garage and chauffeur's residence; storehouse; grain shed; and cemetery. Most of these structures were built during the 1890s and early 1900s. The stables, reputedly erected around the same time as the main residence, are now located on an adjoining lot. The survival of these structures in a well-preserved state provides an example of an early homestead setting, and the relationship between these elements contribute to an understanding of early station life and as such it is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Homestead site provides a well-preserved example of vernacular architecture of the Queensland pastoral frontier and its aesthetic significance is enhanced by its picturesque setting within mature landscaped gardens. The main residence exhibits a high degree of workmanship and design, and its use of local resources for building highlights the adaptive lifestyle of Queensland's pastoral pioneers. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Taabinga has a special association with brothers Charles Robert and William O'Grady Haly, who were early pioneers of the Logan and Burnett regions. The site also has a special association with the Youngman family. Arthur Youngman was responsible for the development of the homestead complex during the 1890s and early 1900s and the property remains in the Youngman family.

The work was commissioned by the New York Philharmonic through a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. It was composed from June through December 1976 and was first performed in New York City on February 17, 1977 by the New York Philharmonic under the conductor Pierre Boulez. The composition is dedicated to Boulez and the New York Philharmonic. Composition A Symphony of Three Orchestras has a duration of roughly 17 minutes and is composed in a single movement. The work was inspired by the beginning of Hart Crane's poem The Bridge as it describes New York Harbor and the Brooklyn Bridge. Instrumentation The work is scored for a large orchestra divided into three ensembles. The first ensemble comprises three horns, two trumpets, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, timpani, and strings (violins, violas, cellos, and basses). The second ensemble comprises two clarinets (doubling bass clarinet), E-flat clarinet, percussion, and strings (violins, cellos, and basses). The third ensemble comprises two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, cor anglais, two bassoons, contrabassoon, two horns, percussion, and strings (violins, violas, and basses). Reception The composition has been praised by musicians and critics alike. The cellist Fred Sherry (who performed the first recording of Carter's Cello Concerto) described A Symphony of Three Orchestras as one of three Carter pieces he would \\"recommend to every music lover,\\" including his Concerto for Orchestra and Symphonia: sum fluxae pretium spei. The music critic Tim Page of The Washington Post wrote, \\"It makes its strongest impression in concert, where one may listen to each ensemble playing its own allotted music, then combining with the other ensembles to create a cumulative whole.\\" References Category:Compositions by Elliott Carter Category:1976 compositions Category:20th-century symphonies Category:Music commissioned by the New York Philharmonic Category:Music dedicated to ensembles or performers ","title":"A Symphony of Three Orchestras"},{"id":"49286283","text":"Alain Le Mehaute (fr. Alain Le M√©haut√©; born November 21, 1947) is a French engineer-chemist and inventor. He has written numerous scientific researches and academic literature on Geometry, Physics and Chemistry. Alain Le Mehaute, Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude Andr√© were the first to file their patent for the stereolithography process, but officially the title of inventor of stereolithography and 3D printing technology on the whole belongs to Chuck Hull  Career  Early in his career, Alain Le Mehaute was the main engineer in the scientific center of the industrial group Alcatel-Alstrom. After that he was a professor of mathematics at the University of Nantes, France and a professor at University of Paris-Sud. From 1996-2010 he was a director at the Institute of Modern Materials, ISMANS, Le Mans, France. He then took the post as a visiting professor at the University of Kazan (Russia) after he had retired.  Patents  Alain Le Mehaute has more than 100 articles published, most of them on physics. According to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Alain Le Mehaute is an author of 23 patents. Including development of Lithium based generator, a device for attenuating and filtering vibrations transmitted to a user by an item of footwear.  Invention of stereolithography  On July 16, 1984 Alain Le M√©haut√©, Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude Andr√© filed their patent for the stereolithography process. It was three weeks before American Chuck Hull filed his own patent for stereolithography. Due to issues with the patent for Alain Le M√©haut√©, Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude Andr√©, Chuck Hall is considered to be the inventor of this technology. The application of French inventors were abandoned by the French General Electric Company (now Alcatel-Alsthom) and CILAS (The Laser Consortium). The claimed reason was ‚Äúfor lack of business perspective‚Äù. One of the main sources about 3D printing 3dprint.com called him \\"the father of 3D printing\\". Alain Le M√©haut√© in his interview describes the commitment that led to the patent application as arising from a theoretical commitment: mathematical order, a passion for transdisciplinary science, and the belief in the explosive commercial potential. ‚ÄúAt first, the team was flying high‚Äìuntil they learned (through second-hand rumors) that their patent application had been abandoned because their employers could not perceive the size of the commercial potential‚Äù. Although Alain Le M√©haut√© expressed his regrets on the fact that the European Union awarded Chuck Hull as the sole inventor of this technology, he saluted Hull's work saying ‚ÄúI have great respect for Hull who had the courage to initiate the creation of 3D Systems in 1986. I also have a lot of admiration for the US‚Äôs ability to open doors to the future, even in cases where they can only understand theoretical approximations of the value. It‚Äôs something our French financial experts would laugh at doing, even today‚Ä¶We see the consequences of these attitudes every day and 3D technology is just one example of our collective failure‚Äù.

Currently, the mobile accessory brand is sold at over 6,000 retailers worldwide, including Colette, Le Bon March√©, Selfridges and Urban Outfitters. History Background Struck with the concept of creating something colourful for the accessory market, founder Andreas Vural decided on headphones after being inspired by his girlfriend who wondered why ‚Äùmost headphones only came in black and white‚Äù [sic]. When presenting the idea for friends and acquaintances, he was met with only skepticism. They questioned how he would be able to compete against established actors like Sony and Philips, leaving Vural with second thoughts. He decided to move on and commissioned a plastic manufacturer to design the packaging where the headphones are arranged in the shape of a note. Taking a pair of white iPhone headphones and spray painting them, he went on the road to sell \\"his product\\". In August 2011, he found a distributor in Helsingborg that wished to order 25000 of them. With no company, no actual product and no knowledge of how to produce the product, Vural was caught off guard. Despite this, he promised to deliver the headphones in time for the holiday season. Vural arranged to have them manufactured in China. On December 14, Vural delivered the first Happy Plugs to electronics retailer Siba. Collaborations Together with MTV, Happy Plugs launched rainbow colored headphones to promote HBTQ rights. In March 2015, Happy Plugs teamed up with the American band Thirty Seconds To Mars to release a pair of headphones.

It was released as the lead single from the mixtape on February 19, 2016 after Banks had announced the mixtape in the previous May. Production of the song was handled by new producer An Expresso, while the song was penned by Banks alone. The song contains an uncredited sample of The Notorious B.I.G.'s voice. Lyrically, the track discusses staying true to your roots when you become famous. Several critics highlighted the \\"club-ready\\" spirit of the composition and the \\"catchy\\" lyrics. A music video for the single was released on April 26, 2016 and features the rapper dancing in a hallway of a downtown skyscraper, on the top of a police vehicle, and at the entrance to Manhattan Criminal Courts Building. Background In May 2015, Banks announced on Twitter that she had recorded an entire mixtape of Jay Z covers and remixes, titled Slay-Z, and that she was contemplating releasing it. In August 2015, Banks revealed that due to contractual agreements, she was blocked from releasing any new music until her contract had expired, which would be around March 2016. On February 1, 2016, Banks announced that she would be releasing the aforementioned mixtape, and its lead single \\"The Big Big Beat\\" would be released on February 7. The announcement of new music came during a flurry of tweets Banks sent in which she endorsed Donald Trump and his campaign for presidency, which some critics saw as a cheap way of gaining publicity, with Spectrum writer Kerry Cardoza calling it \\"purely coincidental\\" that Banks endorsed Trump on the same days as announcing her new single. On February 8, Banks uploaded the single's artwork to Twitter. The following day, it was reported that the single had been pushed back. Banks uploaded the song to her SoundCloud account on February 19, self-releasing the single. On May 6, it was released on iTunes. Composition \\"The Big Big Beat\\" is a house song which runs for a duration of three minutes and forty- four seconds, and contains an uncredited sample of The Notorious B.I.G.'s voice. Before the release of the song, Banks described the single as giving \\"Detroit house vibes with major Diana Ross teas[e]\\". Entertainment Weeklys Dylan Kickham compared the song to that of Banks' work on her debut album, in the sense that both contain \\"fast, aggressive rap verses over a dancefloor- ready electronic beat and a sing-song bridge\\", although did not clarify whether this was good or bad. Gregory Adams from Exclaim! thought that the track \\"fit with various early '90s house sounds, from club synths to a jazzed- up digi-hi-hat beat\\", and went on to describe the song's lyrics as \\"maintaining the precarious balance between staying true to the streets while popping up on magazine covers\\". D-Money from Soul Bounce was enthusiastic in his review, writing \\"'The Big Big Beat' comes out of the gate swinging with a fat, squelchy synth bass intro and a vocal sample. 'Guess who up in this b***h,' Azealia begins, bringing the swing of programmed drums and hi-hats along with her as the groove kicks up the bpm and the party really gets started. She continues flipping her usual boastful rhymes that hit as hard as the kick drum thumps, then things smooth out just a bit as AB flexes her vocals on the chorus\\". Ione Gamble of Dazed noted Banks' use of softer vocals on the single, compared to that of her previous work, while Brennan Carley of Spin described the song's instrumental work as \\"glittery synthesizers\\", alluding that Banks had returned \\"swinging and vogueing\\" on the song. Critical reception alt=A graffiti artwork of The Notorious B.I.G. In a multi-person review conducted by PopMatters, opinions on the track were mixed. Each of the five reviewers gave the single a rating out of ten, which ranged from five to eight. Pryor Stroud gave the song its highest score, describing \\"The Big Big Beat\\" as an \\"amphetamine-addled, dance-pop flirtation that forgoes innuendo and gets straight to the point\\". Chad Miller commented that the song deserved endless dance remixes, while Emmanuel Elone described the song as \\"nice\\" with \\"decent lyrics\\". Steve Horowitz gave the track the lowest rating of the reviewers, complaining that the track repeated itself and that while the instrumental was suited to the dance floor, he could easily find bigger beats elsewhere. Writing for HotNewHipHop, Rose Lilah observed that despite the fact that Banks tends to be outrageous on social media, she still has the ability to create great music when she wants to, going on to comment that she can see potential for the song to become as big of a hit as her debut single, \\"212\\". Spin writer Brennan Carley praised Banks' vocals on the track, as did Billboard critic Adelle Platon, who donned the track as a \\"dancefloor- ready jam\\". Emma Arnold, a writer for Acclaim, motioned that the track would \\"make you forget she was ever out of the game\\", going on to highlight and compliment her \\"fast-paced flow and thugged out lyrics\\". XXL critic Emmanuel C.M. lauded the song, describing the song as \\"fire\\", and that it showcased Banks' rapid fire delivery and impressive vocal range. Writing for Fuse, Tyler Lauletta commented that the lyrics of the song are \\"ridiculously catchy lines\\", calling the track \\"dance-ready\\". The Line of Best Fit writer Laurence Day wrote that the combination of contrasting genres worked to great effect, calling the track her \\"most promising offering in quite some time\\". Both The Irish Times and USA Today included \\"The Big Big Beat\\" in weekly lists of the best songs released in the seven preceding days. The Irish Times gave the track four stars out of a possible five, commenting that it was Banks \\"at her best\\", while USA Today placed the song as sixth in their weekly list, comparing it to \\"Good Vibrations\\" by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. Eric Torres of Pitchfork Media named the song \\"Best New Track\\" in their review, describing the song as \\"in-your-face impressive, filled with the kind of lush braggadocio the 24-year-old rapper has cut down to a formula\\". Torres then claimed that the song was \\"the type of track that's capable of filling dancefloors in seconds, proof that a cavalcade of controversy isn't nearly enough to squander real talent\\".  Live performances  Banks performed the song during her 2016 \\"SLAY-Z\\" tour. She performed the song for the first time on television on Good Day New York on August 22, 2017.http://www.breatheheavy.com/azealia-banks-performs-the-big-big-beat-on- good-day-new-york/  Release history  { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Country ! scope=\\"col\\" Date ! scope=\\"col\\" Format ! scope=\\"col\\" Label ! scope=\\"col\\" - !scope=\\"row\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Worldwide  February 19, 2016  Streaming rowspan=\\"2\\" Azealia Banks  -  May 6, 2016  Digital download  } References External links * Category:2015 songs Category:2016 singles Category:Azealia Banks songs Category:Songs written by Azealia Banks ","title":"The Big Big Beat"},{"id":"49286704","text":"Youri Boutsko (; Youri Markovitch Boutsko; 18 May 1938 - 25 April 2015) was a Russian composer and professor of the Moscow State Tchaikovsky Conservatory from 1968 to 2015.

Gopal Sharman was modern India's maverick artist par excellence! 80 million watched his TV series India Alive. On Broadway, his epic play The Ramayana earned rave reviews. He composed his own music. The Akshara Theatre, situated on Baba Kharak Singh Marg, was constructed (including the furniture and lights) by him in the early 1970s.http://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/bidding- farewell-to-the-entertainer-gopal-sharman/story-9U8G0EeNQx8asHJrtEN0tO.html It is a hub of cultural activity in New Delhi and is studied by architecture students. His political satires pack a deadly punch and his poetry reminded President Radhakrishnan of the Upanishads. Early life and career Born in Calcutta, India, on 19 August 1935, Gopal was the sixth child of Dr. Buddhidhan Sharman, a medical doctor of repute, and his wife Savitri. Both parents were Sanskrit scholars and ardent fighters in the cause of India's independence from British rule. Sharman started his working life as a journalist in Lucknow and Calcutta but shifted to Delhi in 1958, where he began writing on the performing arts for several major Indian newspapers. He later moved to London where he wrote on the arts for The Times, London and The Sunday Times . His highly acclaimed book on India music, Filigree in Sound was published in London by Andre Deutsch. He has also written columns for the Washington Post in the United States. His theatrical career was launched by Professor Radhakrishnan, President of India with a reading of Gopal's poems and stories at the Rashtrapati Bavan by his wife Jalabala. Shortly after the couple embarked on a tour that took them to Europe and international high praise from critics and audiences alike. This first production, Full Circle, was followed by an invitation from the Royal Shakespeare Company of Great Britain to bring a play to their World Theatre Season. The play in question was Sharman's The Ramayana, a play in English in four acts that retold the epic story from a contemporary viewpoint, but without any loss of reverence. Poetry & Plays Sharman rose to prominence as a playwright and director with his very first production, Full Circle, a collection of his stories and poems dramatically performed by his actress wife, Jalabala Vaidya . Full Circle had its London premiere at the Mercury Theatre, where T.S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral and Christopher Fry's Ascent of F6 had also had their world premieres. The Sunday Times hailed Sharman as a new major poet and said of Jalabala Vaidya: she performs exquisitely . The Guardian described Sharman as a Renaissance man who would leave any Medici panting well in the rear. The production, an inspired view of contemporary India with its mixture of pointless poverty, classical Indian thought, comic asides on cobweb-shrouded government departments, and pure lyricism is obviously inspired by Sharman's early life. Sharman returned to India to write his dramatic, contemporary version of the 5000-year-old Indian epic, The Ramayana, for the RSC. The Ramayana on Broadway Gopal & Jalabala in Sadler's Wells Theatre, London The power and beauty of Sharman's play, widely acclaimed and applauded by purists and modernists alike in India, Jalabala's 'tour de force' performance, and Sharman's superb direction and production design have made The Ramayana, with more than 2000 performances to date, something of a legend in contemporary world theatre. It has played on Broadway in New York, on London's West End, the United Nations Headquarters in New York, where it received a standing ovation, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., the National Theatres of Finland and Canada ‚Äî even in the Bahamas and the Fiji Islands ‚Äî and in more cities and towns in India than any other theatrical production since after Independence. Robert A. Hendrickson first produced the play on Broadway, New York in 1975. When The Ramayana played in New York, the New York Times hailed Sharman's play as \\"India's Gift to Broadway\\" On the U.S. West Coast, poet Gene Detro wrote in Portland's Oregon Journal: \\"Both poet playwright Gopal Sharman and his actress wife Jalabala Vaidya are possessed of genius ‚Ä¶ Sharman's script fuses poetic power with the pacing of a very fine film editor\\". The Akshara Theatre, New Delhi Gopal Sharman has also created an exquisite arts complex in an old Lutyen's bungalow in New Delhi called the Akshara National Classical Theatre, built and designed by himself, and embellished by his own stone carvings. This complex houses three theatres, television production studios and a gallery. Here the couple work and live. The Akshara Indoor Theatre made by Sharman From the mid-‚Äò80s, Sharman has also made a series of outstanding television programmes and documentaries for television. These include the popular India Alive series, The Kashmir Story, The Sufi Way, Music Alive and My Life is My Song, all telecast nationally. His 11-part series India was telecast on PBS, USA. Sharman's Akshara Theatre combines theatre production, television production, a training programme for the classical arts and a publishing division. The Akshara Outdoor Pipal Tree Theatre created by Sharman Sharman's Plays Gopal's plays include Full Circle, Larflarflarf, The Ramayana, Let's Laugh Again, India Alive, Karma, Jeevan Geet, The Bhagavad Gita, In Goethe's Magical World, I, Galileo Galilei, Alice& Humpty Dumpty, This and That, etc. His television work has been viewed by millions of Indians and includes the 31-part series India Alive two and a half hour documentary The Kashmir Story, the 6-part Sufi Way, the 8-part Music Alive, My Life Is My Song, his musical documentary, and the five-part Kathanjali based in his own stories as well as Tagore's Gitanjali and The Kabuliwala. Sharman has written four books: Filigree in Sound on Indian music, published by Andre Deutsch of London; The Ramayana, the epic as a play in English, published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan; Don‚Äôt Miss It, the story of the Akshara Theatre's beginnings, published by the Akshara Press; and Karma, an Upanishadic musical also published by the Akshara Press. Gopal and Jalabala have two children, Anasuya and Jai, and three grandchildren; Nisa, Dhruv and Yashna. All of them (including the cats) are involved in theatre, music and film.

World War II  When Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941, the 137th Rifle Division was stationed at their summer camp of Gorokhovetsky. The division was sent to the front and fought in the Battle of Smolensk in early July, part of the 13th Army. Near Shklo≈≠, the division defended the Dnieper crossing and delayed advancing German troops for seven days. The division then retreated back to Chavusy. The division then defended the Sozh River line and held south of Trubchevsk for two weeks. From 2‚Äì6 August, Grishin temporarily became commander of some elements of the 4th Airborne Corps. In September, the division was transferred to the Bryansk Front. The division then fought around Tula and in the Battle of Moscow. On 7 November, Grishin was awarded the Order of the Red Banner.Bryansk Front Order No. 2, available online at pamyat-naroda.ru In December, the division participated in the Yelets Offensive and reportedly advanced to the west.

It originates in Singaporean cuisine and is not thought of as part of the cuisine of Hainan, China. History Hainanese curry rice developed during British colonial rule in Singapore. It was started by Hainanese living in Singapore, who were often employed by the British as well as the wealthy Peranakans (Straits-Chinese) as chefs in their homes. Pork chop was adapted from British cuisine and the rest of the ingredients, such as curry chicken, babi pongteh and chap chye, were from Peranakan cuisine. These were adapted for Hainanese curry rice. Loo's, one of the most well-known and popular Hainanese curry rice vendors in Singapore, started operations in 1946 and is situated opposite Tiong Bahru Market.  Description   Rice  Traditionally, steamed white rice forms the base of this dish. In recent years, some outlets, for example Jin Soon Fa Curry Rice, offer brown rice as an option.  Curry  The curry is milder and gloopier than South Asian varieties with subtle sweet flavours, with some describing it as bland.

The text elaborates on the ethnic composition dynamics of Kosovo and other Albanian populated areas within Yugoslavia from medieval times to present. While explaining why any previous methods put in place by the Yugoslav authorities to overturn the ethnic majority of the Albanians in those areas, such as slow colonization or agrarian reforms, had failed so far, it suggested in details a radical solution, the mass expulsion of Albanians. The expulsion was seen by ƒåubriloviƒá as a geopolitical measure, as to prevent potential Albanian irredentism. Background In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Albanians were concentrated in the Kosovo region. In 1923, Greece and Turkey made a successful population exchange. In early 1936, Turkey was interested in signing an agreement for the resettlement of a considerable amount of Muslims from Yugoslavia if the population would agree. However in 1940 the Turkish Parliament refussed any deal, as the heavy majority of the Albanians considered themselves as Albanian and did not want to move. However economical migration of Albanians and Muslim Bosnians to Turkey during this period continued. ƒåubriloviƒá, a historian at the University of Belgrade, and former member of the Young Bosnia organization, originally presented it as a lecture on 7 March 1937 at the Serbian Cultural Club in Belgrade. It suggested a radical solution, ethnic cleansing in the form of expulsion, of Albanians from Kosovo as a geopolitical measure, a means to prevent Albanian irredentism and to secure a Yugoslav Kosovo. Points The paper details a radical solution, the mass expulsion of Albanians. ƒåubriloviƒá proposed that the Albanians be forced to emigrate free willingly through harassment and settling of Serbs, calling the state for help to make the \\"Arnaut suffer as much as he can\\". This would be done through fines, arrests, ruthless application of all police regulations, punishment, smuggling, deforestation and violence. A ruthless collection of taxes would be used and all public schools be closed. Albanian homes and villages could be burnt down, referring to the 1877‚Äì78 expulsions of Albanians in Ni≈° and Kur≈°umlija. ƒåubriloviƒá described that the Chetniks and paramilitaries could be of good use where they would pressure the Albanians to leave, making it \\"the most effective means\\". Their land was to be confiscated and given to Montenegrin and Serb settlers and thus change the ethnic structure. These methods would result in ethnic cleansing. ƒåubriloviƒá believed that the Albanians were nationalistic, tribalic, fanatic, superstitious and that previous expulsion plans, like those enacted within the wider Ni≈° region during 1878 in areas such as the Toplica and the Morava Valleys given to Serbia in the Treaty of San Stefano in 1877-1878, would be the only effective way. He proposed that Albanians be called Turks and that their lives should be made as miserable as possible forcing them to leave. Arrangements eventually led to the relocation of tens of thousands of Kosovo Albanians to Turkey. Aftermath and legacy The programme was difficult to put into practice because of the economical and political situation at the time. Yugoslavia did not have the political and military power to apply this plan and no actual political action was unsertaken to realise this plan. The April War and the collapse of Yugoslavia by the invasion of the 3rd Reich's German army in April 1941 stopped it and the document remained hidden in archives for years. ƒåubriloviƒá's paper was \\"erased\\" by the Communist authorities because they believed that \\"all non-Slavic\\" people should be incorporated into Yugoslavia. The International community found the document in the 1960s which was then given to Albanian President Enver Hoxha who used it to criticize the Yugoslav authorities, who denied that such a document even existed. The document was mentioned and published in January 1988 in the Belgrade newspaper Borba, and later in Zagreb-based magazine Start. ƒåubriloviƒá's document was not supported by Yugoslav historians and professors except for Ivo Andriƒá.

It is an erect, open shrub with sticky, narrow leaves and with lilac-coloured flowers. Description Eremophila granitica is an erect, open or straggling shrub which grows to a height of between with sticky, wrinkled, shiny branches. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems and are mostly long, wide, linear, sometimes with a few small teeth along the edges. They are also shiny and sticky and have small, raised glands on their surface. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a flattened, S-shaped stalk long. There are 5 lance-shaped, sticky, shiny green to purple sepals, differing in size from each other, mostly long but often enlarging after flowering. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is a shade of lilac or pinkish- lilac on the outside and white, spotted with orange-brown inside. The outside of the tube and petal lobes are hairy but the inside of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is woolly. The centre part of the lower petal lobe closes the opening of the petal tube. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from March to November and is followed by fruits which are dry, woody, oval-shaped with a pointed end, hairy and about long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described in 1899 by Spencer Le Marchant Moore and the description was published in Journal of the Linnean Society, Botany. The specific epithet (granitica) is a Latin word meaning \\"granitic\\" or \\"living on granite soil\\", referring to the habitat of this species. Distribution and habitat Eremophila granitica is widespread and common between Kalgoorlie and Murchison in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Gascoyne, Gibson Desert, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions. It grows in sand, or clay on granite rocks, ironstone hills and flat areas. Ecology The native bee Leioproctus lanceolatus has been observed pollinating E. granitica. Conservation status Eremophila granitica is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Some forms of this eremophila are rarely without flowers and some specimens have been in cultivation for more than 30 years. It is a hardy shrub and needs little attention. It can be propagated from cuttings or by grafting but plants grown on their own roots need to be grown in light to medium soils. It can grow in full sun or partial shade, is both drought and frost tolerant and responds well to even harsh pruning when provided with water.

It was premiered by the Bavarian State Opera in 2014. Background The opera is based on Joseph Roth's novel, Job ‚Äì The Story of a Simple Man, itself inspired by the biblical book of Job. In July 1939, a dramatization of the novel was arranged in Paris in honour of Roth (who had died in May 1939) and Zeisl, who had recently arrived in Paris in flight from Nazi Germany, wrote some incidental music for this production. This inspired him to create a complete opera based on Roth's work, for which he persuaded his friend Hans Kafka (1902‚Äî1974) to write a libretto. Zeisl composed the first act by 1940, by which time he was now living in New York. Kafka was not able to produce the libretto for Act II until 1957. Zeisl completed the composition of this, but died in 1959.Cole (2014). Interest in the composer following the 50th anniversary of his death led to 2009 and 2010 student performances of excerpts from the opera in Rostock and Vienna. In 2013 the Bavarian State Opera decided to commission a completion of the opera by the Polish composer Jan Duszy≈Ñski and the librettist Miron Hakenbeck.

A sizable population is also engaged in animal husbandry and cottage industries. Coal mining Godda district is rich in coal. A major coal mining project of Eastern Coalfields Limited (Rajmahal open cast project, a part of Rajmahal coalfield) is going on in Boarijore, Mahagama and Sunderpahari CD Blocks. Rajmahal open cast project (earlier known as Lalmatia Colliery) supplies coal to the 2,100 MW Farakka Super Thermal Power Station (located in Farakka (community development block)) and the 2,340 MW Kahalgaon Super Thermal Power Station. Both the power stations are owned by NTPC and the mines are operated by Eastern Coalfields Limited. Opened in 1985, the mine presently produces 10.5 million tonnes annually and efforts are on to raise it to 17 million tonnes per annum. The two public sector power stations located nearby in West Bengal and Bihar have been facing coal supply problems. Essel Mining and Industries, of the Aditya Birla Group, is likely to take over the operations of the Rajmahal open cast project. It is amongst the larger mines in operation in the country. Power plant The foundation stone of Jindal Steel and Power‚Äôs 660x2 MW power plant at Nipania under Sunderpahari CD Block was laid in 2013 by President Pranab Mukherjee.

Description Carex kobomugi is a low-growing sedge that extends along the ground with thick rhizomes. It produces flowering stems up to tall and in diameter, with male and female flowers generally produced on different plants. The leaves are wide, and longer than the stems, and the lowest bracts are similar to the leaves. Male inflorescences are long and around wide, whereas the female inflorescences are slightly larger, long and around wide. Distribution and ecology Carex kobomugi inhabits sand dunes and other sandy sites along the coast. Its natural distribution extends along the coast of mainland Asia from China's Heilongjiang province, around the Korean Peninsula, and around the Yellow Sea as far south as Zhejiang province. It also occurs around the four main Japanese islands, and Taiwan, which is the southernmost distribution of the sedge. As an invasive species Carex kobomugi was introduced to north- eastern North America in the 20th century. It was first recorded on the west coast near Portland, Oregon in 1907, but has not been refound there recently. It was found in 1929 at Island Beach State Park, New Jersey, where it may have arrived after ships from Japan were wrecked off the American coast. An early hypothesis suggested that the sedge had been used as a packing material for the ship's cargo, but it is now considered more likely that plant material was carried in ship's ballast. After its usefulness for stabilising sand dunes was noticed, C. kobomugi was promoted as a useful plant and widely planted on the eastern seaboard until the 1980s. Having become securely established, Carex kobomugi has since developed into an invasive species, spreading locally via rhizomes, and dispersing further afield through rafting or, more rarely, by dispersal of its buoyant seeds. Its distribution in the United States now extends from Rhode Island to North Carolina. Large-scale disturbance events can both open up habitats for C. kobomugi to colonise, and transport plant material in; after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, C. kobomugi colonised New York from the coastline of New Jersey. The biodiversity of native plants is markedly reduced in areas dominated by Carex kobomugi, which has knock-on effects on animals, such as the hairy-necked tiger beetle, Cicindela hirticollis, and the piping plover, Charadrius melodus. The state governments of Massachusetts and Connecticut have banned the sale and distribution of Carex kobomugi. Taxonomy Carex kobomugi was first described by the Japanese botanist Jisaburo Ohwi in 1930; the specific epithet comes from the Japanese name for the plant, ' (). Carex kobomugi is closely related to Carex macrocephala, which grows around the northern Pacific Ocean from northern China to Oregon, and was previously treated as a variety of that species; the two are united in Carex sect. Macrocephalae. Vernacular names in English for Carex kobomugi include \\"Japanese sedge\\" and \\"Asiatic sand sedge\\".

He played eight first-class matches for Nelson and Otago between 1888 and 1900, and was headmaster of Nelson College from 1922 to 1933. Early life and family Broad was born at Nelson on 5 October 1872. His father was Lowther Broad, the Nelson resident magistrate and younger brother of Charles Broad, and his mother was Isabella Mary Broad (n√©e Bunny), the daughter of Henry Bunny. Broad was educated at Nelson College from 1884 to 1892. The latter years of that period were as an extramural student studying for a Bachelor of Arts, and he graduated from Auckland University College in 1893. Broad married Annie Maria Murray at Hokitika on 8 May 1905. Cricket In all, Broad played eight first-class cricket matches. Nelson Broad made his first-class debut for Nelson, against Wellington at the Basin Reserve, in the 1888‚Äì89 season. Batting at number four in the first innings and number nine in the second, he made an inauspicious start to his first- class career, making a pair. He bowled seven overs for 26 runs, and did not take a wicket. Nelson lost the match by an innings and 190 runs.Scorecard: Wellington v Nelson 1888/89 from CricketArchive His second and last first- class appearance for Nelson, also against Wellington, was in the 1891‚Äì92 season at Trafalgar Park. Opening the batting in the first innings, Broad made one run, and in the second innings, batting at three, he scored 12 runs. He did not bowl in Wellington's first innings, but in their second he took two wickets for 13 runs off 3.2 overs. Wellington won the match by one wicket. The wicketkeeper for Nelson in the match was Broad's younger brother, Edward.Scorecard: Nelson v Wellington 1891/92 from CricketArchive In the 1894‚Äì95 season, Broad played for Nelson against the touring Fijian team. Opening the batting in each innings, he scored 17 and 80 runs, respectively. He took one wicket in each innings, bowling one over in the first and four in the second. Despite his efforts, Fiji won the two-day match by three wickets.Scorecard: Nelson v Fiji 1894/95 from CricketArchive Broad made a final appearance for Nelson, playing against Lord Hawke's XI at Trafalgar Park in January 1903. He made 4 (stumped Taylor, bowled Hargreave) and 7 not out in Nelson's two turns at bat. The tourists won the match by an innings and 79 runs, despite the home team playing with 18 men.Scorecard: Nelson v Lord Hawke's XI 1902/03 from CricketArchive For several years, Broad was the captain of the Nelson College cricket club. Otago Broad made six first- class appearances for Otago between 1898 and 1900: one in each of the 1897‚Äì98 and 1898‚Äì99 seasons; and four in the 1899‚Äì1900 season. Against Canterbury at Lancaster Park in 1897‚Äì98, he scored 5 and 7 runs, respectively, in Otago's two innings, and bowled 1.3 overs without success in Canterbury's second innings.Scorecard: Canterbury v Otago 1897/98 from CricketArchive The following season against Canterbury at Carisbrook, Broad made 12 and 17 runs batting at four, and was not called upon to bowl. He contributed in the field, taking two catches in Canterbury's first innings and one in their second.Scorecard: Otago v Canterbury 1898/99 from CricketArchive Later in the 1898‚Äì99 season, Broad played for Otago against the New Zealand team selected to tour Australia. In that two-day match at Carisbrook, with 13 players per side, he scored 11 runs in the first innings, and did not bat in the second.Scorecard: Otago v New Zealand to Australia touring team 1898/99 from CricketArchive In his final first-class season for Otago, 1899‚Äì1900, Broad scored a total of 98 runs, with a high-score of 60 batting at number seven against Hawke's Bay, at an average of 14.00.First-class batting and fielding in each season by Charles Broad from CricketArchiveScorecard: Hawke's Bay v Otago 1899/00 from CricketArchive During the season, he bowled just 12 deliveries in first-class games, without taking a wicket.First-class bowling in each season by Charles Broad from CricketArchive During his time in Dunedin from 1897 to 1901, Broad belonged to the Carisbrook cricket club. Tennis A member of the Otago tennis club, Broad was the Otago provincial tennis champion in 1901. Teaching career In 1893 Broad was appointed junior master at Nelson College, with a salary of ¬£50 per year plus board and residence. At Easter 1897 he took up a post as an assistant master at Otago Boys' High School. He returned to Nelson College as third master in 1901, and remained there for the rest of his teaching career. Following the retirement of Harry Lewis Fowler as headmaster of Nelson College after a 17-year tenure, Broad was appointed as his replacement, and was the first old boy of the school to be given the role. Broad was headmaster of Nelson College for 11 years. In 1927 he visited the United Kingdom with his wife, and saw how secondary schools were organised there. When he returned to Nelson, he put into practice some of what he had observed, particularly the house system, which still continues. The latter years of Broad's tenure were dominated by the effects of the damaging 1929 Murchison earthquake. Three new boarding houses were planned: the new Rutherford and Barnicoat Houses were completed in 1931, and Fell House was temporarily located in nearby Fairfield House. Broad gained extra responsibilities in 1932 as the daytime operations of the Nelson Technical School were merged into Nelson College. He retired as headmaster at the end of 1933, having been at the school for all but five years since 1884. Broad also served on the Nelson College Old Boys' Association. He was secretary from 1906 to 1912 and president between 1921 and 1928. He was involved in the purchase in 1927 of of land between Vanguard and Tipahi Streets for additional college playing fields, that were later named \\"Broad's\\" in his honour. Later life Following his retirement, Broad continued to live in Nelson, and he died there on 7 September 1959. His wife, Annie Maria Broad, died on 26 April 1965.

But in December 2013 the CDU formed a Grand coalition with the SPD and Tauber had been nominated as general secretary of the CDU on 16 December 2013 and since January 2014 Tauber had changed his position and actively supported a new bill against a reluctant Minister of Justice from the SPD.Gro√üe Koalition: CDU-Generalsekret√§r mahnt SPD zu Disziplin (Grand coalition: CDU general secretary calls on SPD to maintain discipline), Google-translation, Quelle: Der Spiegel, 10 January 2014 In October 2015 the bill was approved by the Bundestag and in November 2015 by the Bundesrat of Germany and is now law.  \\"Operation Kaninchenjagd\\"  Operation Kaninchenjagd (\\"Operation rabbit hunting\\") is one of two titles of an anonymous paperThe paper consists of 8 pages with the title Operation Kaninchenjagd (\\"Operation rabbit hunting\\") and an additional cover page with the sole title Pflegehinweise f√ºr das Kaninchen (\\"Care instructions for the rabbit\\"). that became public in September 2016 and led to accusations against the politician Peter Tauber. It is alleged that Tauber ‚Äì who was at that time member of the CDU and the (regional) chairman of the Young Union in Hesse ‚Äì was involved in (attempted) bullying of another member and employee of the Christian Democratic Party.  Insulting mini jobbers  In July 2017, Tauber argued that someone who has a proper education does not have to work as a so-called mini jobber (marginal employment). This statement was criticized heavily by other politicians, the media and trades unions. In Germany, millions of workers are dependent on this type of employment to make a living due to economic liberalization implemented a decade ago.

The society was founded by John A. Koski, a building engineer. A preliminary meeting was held on December 6, 1890 and was followed by the founding meeting held on December 14, 1890.The Imatra Society Centennial Celebration Souvenir Journal (published in September 1991). p. 8-9, 30‚Äì32, 34, 36‚Äì40, 42, 45, 47‚Äì48. At the beginning: a workers' association The chairman of Imatra Society, John A. KoskiAt the beginning the society operated as a workers' association with the name of Workers' Association Imatra. Women were participating in the activities from the beginning. As a first act in the business the society established its own brass band. In addition a chorus and a theater group were formed. In October 1892 the chairman Koski informed the meeting of the society with the following: \\"A failure of crops has taken place in our native country Finland and a famine is imminent there, so it should be our duty, as we are in these better circumstances, to begin a kind of relief for the hunger.\\" This statement was unanimously approved. In February 1903 the Society founded an Imatra League which was a Finnish American workers' union consisting of about 40 subdivisions across the United States and Canada. The total membership in the league was approximately 2,000 members. The league published its own newspaper called Ty√∂v√§en Album (the worker's album). The Imatra League was abolished in February 1917. On June 10, 1906 Imatra Society began to publish its own newspaper, the New Yorkin Uutiset. In 1906 Imatra Society consisted of the following units: a discussion club, a theater group, a women's club, a brass band, an entertainment committee, a library, and a reading-room.Minutes of Imatra Society: minutes of 1906, 1907, 1910, 1911, 1921, 1923‚Äì1925, 1946, 1949, 1960, 1971, 1986, 1991. In fall 1907 the society began to collect money for the crofters of the estate Laukko in Finland \\"who had got into distress because they were fired out from their crofts.\\"  Imatra Hall  The premises of Imatra Society was located in the address of 740 40th Street / Finlandia Street, Brooklyn, New York. The society built its own house for their activities and moved into it on November 1, 1908. Opening celebration was held on November 18 and 19. They also supplied to their new house a generator to produce electricity. \\"This was a historical event in the Finntown hill and caused a lot of talk in the neighbourhood since it was the Imatra Society that brought the first electric lights to the buck hill\\" (now the Sunset Park area). This house, later called Imatra Hall, was most important place for the activities of the society and became well known and very popular among the Finnish people. In December 1908 the society maintained a cause of temperance. No alcoholic drinks were allowed to be brought to the hall and nobody was allowed to appear under the influence of alcohol. Also smoking was absolutely forbidden in the restaurant. Imatra Society established an employment agency by the proposal of Matti Kurikka. The agency began its operation on December 1, 1910. In a year the agency exchanged a job to about 50‚Äì60 men and 135 women. In service occupations for women there were much more open vacancies than there were applicants. In 1912 the agency exchanged 242 jobs. In 1910 the theater group of the society performed several plays in Imatra Hall, such as Pimeyden valta (the power of darkness), Charleyn T√§hti (the star of Charley), Jeppe Niilonpoika (Jeppe the Nilsson), Tukkijoella (on the log river), Roinilan Talossa (in the house of Roinila), and Viimeinen Ponnistus (the last effort). As special performances they performed Kristitty (the Christian) and Kun piiat ovat lakossa (when the hired girls are on strike).  Aid society and national society  In the annual meeting of the society on January 20, 1918, new clauses were made for the bylaw of the society such as: Clause 8 ‚Äì The society tries to do its best to make Finnish people well known in the United States. Clause 9 ‚Äì Officially the society is known as the Finnish Aid Society Imatra. Clause 22 ‚Äì If the society dissolves or its operation becomes so weak that there is a fear for withdrawal of the society, do not move or sell the property of the society without a special permit from the Senate of Finland. This clause must not be changed. Originally the society was a workers' association, then it became an aid society, and in July 1921 it was named as Kansallisseura Imatra (National Society Imatra). May 13. 1923 the Imatra Society sends a group of seven people to Ellis Island to help the Finnish immigrants in the landing process.  Visitors from Finland  Visitors from Finland, such as artists and others, have been an important part in the activities of the Imatra Hall. Many Finnish artists have performed a concert at Imatra Hall including such famous artists as: Uuno Klami on October 27, 1917, Alfred Tanner on May 29, 1924, Robert Kajanus on January 11, 1925, Lea Piltti on April 24, 1949, Tapio Rautavaara on October 22, 1959, Henry Theel on February 2, 1973, and Heimo Haitto on January 24, 1984. Other important persons who have visited in Imatra Hall include such as Paavo Nurmi on February 19, 1966, Anne Pohtamo on February 5, 1978, the minister of education Kaarina Suonio with her delegation on September 13, 1982, the President of Finland Mauno Koivisto and Mrs. Tellervo Koivisto with their delegation on October 25, 1985, and the minister of education Christoffer Taxell with his delegation on April 10, 1988. Imatra Society held a festival on December 8, 1935 to celebrate Sibelius on his birthday. The festival was a great success. Minister J√§rnefelt also attended it. For the first 50 years the society operated as a temperance society but now it decided to obtain a liquor licence and the bar of the Imatra Hall began its operation on August 27, 1941. Juho Rissanen, a famous painter visited Imatra Hall on October 1, 1946 and was asking if the society would order a wallpainting from him for the Imatra Hall. On January 23, 1949 it is informed that Imatra society had sent to Finland a number of packages to institutions of poor people and to seven families and furthermore will be tried to help the poor and the orphans of Finland. A survey for the situation of the society in 1959: \\"As you remember this year began with very difficult circumstances since we were nearly losing our house to the tumult of the foreign stuff and occasionally it was very difficult for our own members to get in. It was really needed to take the matter with iron hands since a real cleaning had to be bring about. We succeeded rather well with this and already the peacefulness and order began to return‚Ä¶\\" Within the society there were many times discussed whether or not non Finns are accepted to become members of the Imatra Society. Now it was finally clear they are not accepted. The Imatra Society began to arrange Miss Finlandia beauty contests. The first was held on October 6, 1968. Since 1970 Finnair donated to the winner a return flight ticket to Finland.Miss Finlandia 1986 was selected at Imatra Hall, p. 6. New Yorkin Uutiset, October 14, 1986.Miss Finlandia 1990 was selected at Imatra Hall, p. 9. Amerikan Uutiset, October 9, 1990. A group of actors from the National Theater of Finland led by Sakari Jurkka performed a comedy My√∂h√§stynyt h√§√§y√∂ (the delayed wedding night) at Imatra Hall on June 2, 1971. The performance was a great success and therefore it was rerun at Imatra Hall on June 27. The 40th Street in front of the Imatra Hall was co- named as Finlandia Street For the first 95 years the language of the society was Finnish but since the annual meeting on February 16, 1986 the language has been English because there were non Finnish members in the society who did not understand Finnish. In 1987 the society was planning to establish an annual music festival at Imatra Hall where Finnish and American artists could perform. This was a big plan and therefore an inquiry was made to music festivals in Finland if they can come along and participate in organizing the festival in New York. Many of them responded favorably.Music festival in New York, a letter from SATA-H√ÑME SOI festival in Finland on October 1, 1987. There was a concert at Imatra Hall on March 7, 1991 in which two police choruses performed, one was the west coast police chorus from Finland with 60 singers and the other the New York City police chorus with 40 male and female singers. The 100 anniversary celebration of the society lasted for four days and was held on September 19‚Äì22, 1991. In connection with the celebration the 40th Street in front of the Imatra Hall was co-named as Finlandia Street. In the occasion the Finlandia hymn of Sibelius was performed by the Male Singers of J√§rvenp√§√§ from Finland. After this a flag procession with national costumes led the people to the Imatra Hall, where the main event was held.Heikki Sarmanto to opening celebration Imatra¬¥s anniversary is beginning, p. 4.

Nigella Lawson: A sweet and sour life. BBC News, 18 May 2001; retrieved 29 September 2007. It features culinary tips on preparation and saving time,Dolce, Joe England's It Girl, Gourmet, 2001; retrieved 31 January 2008. and sold 300,000 copies in Britain.Hirschberg, Lynn. Hot Dish. The New York Times, 18 November 2001; retrieved 29 September 2007. It was praised by critics as a valuable guide to cooking. Book Approach The book begins with Lawson's preface, which states plainly \\"I am not a chef\\", and that she is not interested in \\"strenuous originality\\".Lawson, page ix She states that her goal, rather, is \\"to make you feel that I'm there with you\\".Lawson, page x The book is divided into themed chapters, such as cooking for \\"One or Two\\". Most of each chapter consists of recipes, but the chapters begin with a few pages of general advice on the theme, such as that while cooking for one may feel \\"onanistic\\", \\"it might be a good thing to consider yourself worth cooking for.\\"Lawson, page 134 Each recipe is headed with its name, generally in English, though with foreign words as needed, as \\"Pea Souffl√©\\". A recipe like \\"Scallops and Bacon\\" then begins with a paragraph of advice on its suitability, in this case stressing that the dish strikes followed by a paragraph about marketing, how to buy and store the ingredients. The ingredients and quantities are tabulated in red boldface type. The recipe itself is given as a paragraph of instructions in light type. The techniques used are not rigidly traditional: in her recipe for Rat soup, introduced to Britain by Elizabeth David, Lawson admits that she is departing from David's prescriptions, but states that this does not seem to make much difference as she does not get a \\"soggy mush\\" by skipping the hour spent salting the aubergine and courgettes, but she explains the David method in an aside, just in case anyone want to try it.Lawson, pages 115‚Äì117 Contents Page numbers refer to the first edition. * Charts & Conversions xii * Basics etc. 2 * Cooking in advance 84 * One and Two 132 * Fast food 176 * Weekend lunch 212 * Dinner 328 * Low fat 404 * Feeding babies and small children 448 * Gazetteer 506 * Bibliography 512 Reception In her chapter Consuming Nigella in Feminism, Domesticity and Popular Culture, Lise Shapiro Sanders observes that Lawson's early books including How to Eat and How to Be a Domestic Goddess (2001) \\"emphasize cooking and eating as sites of pleasure for women.\\" Sanders explains that the pleasure is both \\"authentic\\" and \\"ironic, self-consciously reworking a mid-twentieth-century ideology of domestic femininity.\\" In particular, baking gives Lawson \\"access to a fantasy of femininity that, instead of dooming women to lives of 'domestic drudgery', enables the performance of a 'weekend alter ego winning adoring glances and endless approbation from anyone who has the good fortune to eat in her kitchen'\\". Sanders notes Lawson's disclaimer in her preface that \\"I have nothing to declare but my greed (page xv)\\". She interprets Lawson as meaning to remind readers of \\"the joys of giving in to temptation\\". She notes from a passage by Simon Hoggart in The Spectator (about Nigella Bites) that Lawson \\"becomes an object of desire, ready-made for the consumption of the heterosexual male audience\\", complete with double entendres and sexually suggestive language, both of which Sanders calls trademarks of Lawson's style. The Sunday Telegraph called the book \\"the most valuable culinary guide published this decade.\\"\\"Take one leek...\\", telegraph.co.uk, 19 October 2008 Tony Buchsbaum, writing in the January Magazine, calls How to Eat \\"almost biblical, with countless recipes for just about anything one could name.

On September 8, 2015, Fayetteville voted 52.77% in favor of Ordinance 5781.City of Fayetteville Special E Protect Fayetteville v. City of Fayetteville On March 1, 2016, Washington County Circuit Judge Doug Martin ruled that the Fayetteville, Arkansas was allowed to enforce Ordinance 5781. The ruling was based on the Fayetteville City Attorney's argument that state law provided protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity in sections other than the state's anti-discrimination code, making the city's ordinance legally enforceable. Martin stated, \\"Clearly, the classifications of gender identity and sexual orientation were classifications of persons protected on bases contained in state law prior to the enactment of (Fayetteville's ordinance).\\" Martin did not, however, rule on the ultimate constitutionality of Fayetteville's ordinance. Fayetteville attorneys predicted that the ordinance would be featured in an Arkansas Supreme Court ruling in the future. On February 23, 2017, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled in a 7-0 ruling that Ordinance 5781 of Fayetteville, Arkansas violated the Intrastate Commerce Improvement Act \\"by extending discrimination laws in the City of Fayetteville to include two classifications (sexual orientation and gender identity) not previously included under state law, thus creating a direct inconsistency between state and municipal law.\\" The Arkansas Supreme Court sent the case back to the Washington County judge who upheld Fayetteville's ordinance. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, whose office had asked the court to uphold the state law, said she was grateful for the court's ruling.Arkansas Supreme Court strikes down city's LGBT protections See also *LGBT rights in Arkansas *State bans on local anti-discrimination laws in the United States References Category:2015 in LGBT history Category:Discrimination against LGBT people in the United States Category:LGBT rights in Arkansas ","title":"Intrastate Commerce Improvement Act"},{"id":"49287516","text":"A History of English Food is a history of English cuisine from the Middle Ages to the end of the twentieth century written by the celebrity cook Clarissa Dickson Wright. Each era is treated in turn with a chapter. The text combines history, recipes, and anecdotes, and is illustrated with 32 pages of colour plates. The book was marked as a future classic by The Independent; it was welcomed by critics from The Telegraph and The Spectator, but disliked by the critic in The Guardian. Book Approach The book is divided into 15 chapters, forming a strict chronological sequence of periods such as \\"the Georgian age\\". The chapters freely combine outlines of the historical context, descriptions of recipes, stories about significant figures, and personal anecdotes. For example, \\"The Medieval Larder\\" has an extensive section on the \\"medieval pig\\" (page 22ff), leading into a description of Dickson Wright's own childhood memories of helping to kill her father's pigs and making black pudding, chitterlings and sausages, as well as having hams and bacon smoked. To this is added her personal opinion; thus, the medieval chapter ends \\"The battles of Cr√©cy and Agincourt would scarcely have been won had they been fought by soldiers from a destitute nation.\\" (page 41) Each chapter is opened with a monochrome illustration from its period, with a detailed caption. There are 32 pages of colour plates illustrating famous cookery writers such as Robert May and stages of English cuisine such as \\"The 1950s kitchen\\". Contents The book is illustrated with photographs of historical figures in English cuisine, such as the cook Robert May, author of The Accomplisht Cook, 1660 Page numbers refer to the first English edition. * 1 Bacon and new- laid eggs: the medieval larder 1 * 2 Eastern spices and baked venison: the high middle ages 43 * 3 Marzipan and new world turkeys: the Tudor kitchen 77 * 4 Orange carrots and white bread: England in the age of Gloriana 117 * 5 Preserved quince and my Lord of Devonshire's pudding: the Elizabethan year 149 * 6 Double cream and pastry galleons: the early Stuarts 171 * 7 Coffee and my Lord Lumley's pease-porage: war and peace in the Seventeenth century 201 * 8 Roast beef and sweet oranges: the late Stuarts 231 * 9 Turtle soup and plum pudding: the Georgian age 255 * 10 Roast hare and Indian curry: the era of Hannah Glasse 293 * 11 Pheasant consomm√© and forced peas: rich eating in the nineteenth century 315 * 12 Brown Windsor soup and high tea: The world of the Victorians 343 * 13 Omelette Arnold Bennett and bully beef: From the Edwardians to the eve of war 381 * 14 Spam and coronation chicken: The Second World War and the years of austerity 417 * 15 Prawn cocktail and pizza: Modern English food 445 * Appendix of historical recipes 466 Editions * Reception A History of English Food was described by The Independent as \\"richly informative\\" and \\"surely destined for classic status\\". The reviewer noted that she had seen badger hams on the bar in the West Country pubs of her childhood, and that a tripe seller in Dewsbury market sold \\"nine different varieties of tripe, including penis and udder (which is remarkably like pease pudding).\\" Jane Shilling, writing in The Telegraph, calls the book \\"magnificently eccentric and robustly informative\\", admitting that it is mainly digression, \\"from Victorian fruit-growing via Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs poem ‚ÄúThe Glory of the Garden‚Äù to her theory that Kipling was never made Poet Laureate because Queen Victoria objected to his lines about ‚Äúthe Widow at Windsor/With a hairy gold crown on ‚Äôer ‚Äôead‚Äù. Shilling finds this \\"an impressive tour\\" from a well-stocked mind, her approach being \\"a firmly chronological line across the landscape of culinary history, pausing at intervals to examine objects of interest.\\" She agrees that the book is \\" opinionated and wildly idiosyncratic\\", in the tradition of W.N.W. Fowler's \\"gin-soaked\\" Countryman's Cooking and Rupert Croft-Cooke's English Cooking: A New Approach. The book gives, Shilling asserts, a \\"glorious sense of the continuity of English cuisine from the Middle Ages to the present\\", making it an \\"engaging, funny and admirably entertaining history.\\" Fay Maschler, writing in The Spectator, calls the book a \\"less stringent, more capricious, generously illustrated account\\" which gives \\"a magical sense of almost having been there at every twist and turn, such is her passion for livestock, animal husbandry and cultivation of the edible.\\" There are few \\"revelations, although plenty of engaging detail. There are too many suppositions and fancies.\\" But she feels that Dickson Wright brings the book to life when she speaks from knowledge to compare \\" because she has eaten them, the taste of swan, moorhen and rook, praise the unexpectedly white meat of beaver tail and draw on a childhood .. when local sturgeon were for sale, rough boys sold live eels along Hammersmith Mall\\". Rachel Cooke, reviewing A History of English Food for The Guardian, writes that she feels \\"pretty cross. All of the information in this book can be found elsewhere, and much better done, too.\\" She compares the book unfavourably with Kate Colquhoun's 2008 Taste: The Story of Britain Through Its Cooking and Dorothy Hartley's 1954 \\"classic\\" Food in England. Cooke argues that Dickson Wright is \\"as particular as she is greedy\\", and \\"gruesomely snobbish\\", out of touch with \\"Other people\\", preferring therefore the overindulgent Georgians who could afford a suitable retinue of servants. British Food in America describes the book as \\"a stinker\\", substituting \\"speculation and snobbish reminiscence for any modicum of research or analysis.\\" References Category:2011 non-fiction books Category:English cuisine Category:History books ","title":"A History of English Food"},{"id":"49287556","text":"Bighead sedge (Carex macrocephala) Carex sect.

The street is situated in the historic Latin Quarter neighborhood and has the highest number of historic and listed buildings in the city. Mejlgade is one-way and no-parking zone for cars for most of its length and pedestrians and cyclists are given priority. The single lane is tiled and a part of the Cykelringen bicycle ring which circumnavigates the city center. Mejlgade has a high number of small specialty shops and some caf√©s and bars.  History  Corner of Mejlgade and Havgyden, 1904 Mejlgade is first mentioned in the 1400s as \\"Medelgade\\" from the word ‚Äùm√¶thal‚Äù, meaning \\"middel\\" (English: Middle). In the 1700s it is catalogued as \\"Middelgade\\" and by the late 1800s it is known as the present Mejlgade. Mejlgade stems from the earliest history of the city in the early Viking Age. It was established within the initial ramparts of the viking settlement and later the city walls around the medieval town. In the early to mid-1800s it was the primary arterial and busiest trade street in the town and between 1828 and 1851 the north end of the street had one of 7 city gates where access taxes were collected on produce entering the town. Many merchants houses were built in Mejlgade, close to the city gate, typically with multiple wings and a courtyard for stables and storage. In 1851 the access taxes were abolished and the city walls and gates torn down. Houses on the east side of the street initially had backyards leading to the waters edge on the coast until 1871 when Kystvejen was established, separating the houses from the coast. The street was cobbled through the 1800s but in 1900 it was paved with asphalt as the first street in the city.  Structures  The Mejlborg building at the northern end of Mejlgade. Mejlgade contains 9 buildings listed in the Danish registry of protected buildings and places and many architectural styles from different periods are represented throughout the street. The Jutland Art Academy (Danish: Det Jydske Kunstakademi) has been situated in the historicist building from 1803 in no. 32 since 1964. Mejlgade no. 6 was previously known as the mayors house. The first mayor to live there was Ulrik Christian von Schmidten, mayor from 1866‚Äì1885, and it was used by his successors until 1919 when electoral reform made the office an elected position. The stately Mejlborg building is situated on the site of the former city gate at the north end of the street. It was designed by Sophus Frederik K√ºhnel in 1896‚Äì98 for luxury condominiums with a commanding view of the Bay of Aarhus. In the 1899 fire Mejlborg burned down but was rebuilt the same year almost identically.  Listed buildings  The Cathedral School from 1195 lies on a parcel of land bordering Mejlgade, Skolegyde and Kystvejen and contains a number of buildings of which 4 are listed. One is the building facing Mejlgade, the classicist and baroque \\"white building\\" from 1766 by architect Christian Jensen M√∏rup. The building was renovated and extended in neoclassical style in 1849 by J√∏rgen Hansen Koch. Mejlgade no. 7 from 1848 was built by Hans Wilhelm Schr√∏der in late classicist style. No. 19 is Juul's House, a half-timbered 4-winged structure from 1629 in renaissance style. Juul's House has been a paint shop since 1842 and is the oldest paint shop in the country. Mejlgade 25 is a half-timbered building from 1585. The 4 historicist buildings are the late-classicist houses in no. 43 from 1831 and no. 45 from 1864 in Empire style, no. 48 from 1864 and the classicist no. 52-54 from 1837. Mejlgade No. 48 was home to √Örhus Stiftstidende and its printing press, in differing buildings, from 1794 until 1906 when it was turned into an elementary school.

Aaronson and A. Arkhipov., after the original work of L. Troyansky and N. Tishby, that explored possible usage of boson scattering to evaluate expectation values of permanents of matrices.Troyansky, Lidror; Tishby, Naftali (1996). ‚ÄúPermanent uncertainty: On the quantum evaluation of the determinant and the permanent of a matrix‚Äù. Proceedings of PhysComp, 1996: 314-318. The model consists of sampling from the probability distribution of identical bosons scattered by a linear interferometer. Although the problem is well defined for any bosonic particles, its photonic version is currently considered as the most promising platform for a scalable implementation of a boson sampling device, which makes it a non-universal approach to linear optical quantum computing. Moreover, while not universal, the boson sampling scheme is strongly believed to implement computing tasks, which are hard to implement with classical computers, by using far fewer physical resources than a full linear-optical quantum computing setup. This makes it an outstanding candidate for demonstrating the power of quantum computation in the near term. The task Consider a multimode linear-optical circuit of N modes that is injected with M indistinguishable single photons (N>M). Then, the photonic implementation of the boson sampling task consists of generating a sample from the probability distribution of single-photon measurements at the output of the circuit. Specifically, this requires reliable sources of single photons (currently the most widely used ones are parametric down-conversion crystals), as well as a linear interferometer. The latter can be fabricated, e.g., with fused-fiber beam splitters, through silica-on-silicon or laser-written integrated interferometers, or electrically and optically interfaced optical chips. Finally, the scheme also necessitates high efficiency single photon-counting detectors, such as those based on current-biased superconducting nanowires, which perform the measurements at the output of the circuit. Therefore, based on these three ingredients, the boson sampling setup does not require any ancillas, adaptive measurements or entangling operations, as does e.g. the universal optical scheme by Knill, Laflamme and Milburn (the KLM scheme). This makes it a non-universal model of quantum computation, and reduces the amount of physical resources needed for its practical realization. Specifically, suppose the linear interferometer is described by an N√óN unitary matrix U, which performs a linear transformation of the creation (annihilation) operators a^\\\\dagger_i (a_i^{}) of the circuit's input modes: b^\\\\dagger_j=\\\\sum_{i=1}^N U_{ji}a^\\\\dagger_i \\\\;\\\\;(b_j=\\\\sum_{i=1}^N U_{ij}^\\\\dagger a_i). Here i (j) labels the input (output) modes, and b^\\\\dagger_j (b_j^{}) denotes the creation (annihilation) operators of the output modes (i,j=1,..., N). On the other hand, the interferometer characterized by the unitary U naturally induces the transformation W of its input states. Moreover, there is a homomorphism between the unitaries U and W, and the latter transformation acts on the exponentially big Hilbert space of the system: simple counting arguments show that the size of the Hilbert space corresponding to a system of M indistinguishable photons distributed among N modes is given by the binomial coefficient \\\\tbinom {M+N-1} {M} (notice that since this homomorphism exists, not all values of W are possible). Namely, suppose the interferometer is injected with an input state of single photons \\\\psi_{\\\\text{in}}\\\\rangle=s_1, s_2, ..., s_N \\\\rangle with \\\\sum_{k=1}^{N}s_k=M (s_k is the number of photons injected into the kth mode). Then, the state \\\\psi_{\\\\text{out}}\\\\rangle at the output of the circuit can be written down as \\\\psi_{\\\\text{out}}\\\\rangle=W s_1, s_2, ..., s_{N} \\\\rangle. A simple way to understand the homomorphism between U and W is the following : We define the isomorphism for the basis states: P_{s_1, s_2, ..., s_{N} \\\\rangle}()\\\\equiv x^{s_1}_1{\\\\cdot}x^{s_2}_2{\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot}x^{s_{N}}_{N}, and get the following result : P_{{W}s_1, s_2, ..., s_{N} \\\\rangle}()= P_{s_1, s_2, ..., s_{N} \\\\rangle}(U) Consequently, the probability p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N) of detecting t_k photons at the kth output mode is given as p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)=\\\\langle t_1, t_2, ..., t_N \\\\psi_{\\\\text{out}}\\\\rangle^2=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Perm}\\\\,U_{S,T}^2}{t_1!\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot t_N! s_1!\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot s_N!}. In the above expression \\\\text{Perm}\\\\,U_{S,T} stands for the permanent of the matrix U_{S,T}, which is obtained from the unitary U by repeating s_i times its ith column and t_j times its jth row. Usually, in the context of the boson sampling problem the input state is taken of a standard form, denoted as 1_M\\\\rangle, for which each of the first M modes of the interferometer is injected with a single photon. In this case the above expression reads: p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N)=\\\\langle t_1, t_2, ..., t_N W 1_M\\\\rangle^2=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Perm}\\\\,U_{T}^2}{t_1!\\\\cdot\\\\cdot\\\\cdot t_N!}, where the matrix U_{T} is obtained from U by keeping its first M columns and repeating t_j times its jth row. Subsequently, the task of boson sampling is to sample either exactly or approximately from the above output distribution, given the unitary U describing the linear-optical circuit as input. As detailed below, the appearance of the permanent in the corresponding statistics of single-photon measurements contributes to the hardness of the boson sampling problem. The complexity of the problem The main reason of the growing interest towards the model of boson sampling is that despite being non-universal it is strongly believed to perform a computational task that is intractable for a classical computer. One of the main reasons behind this is that the probability distribution, which the boson sampling device has to sample from, is related to the permanent of complex matrices. As is known, the computation of the permanent is in the general case an extremely hard task: it falls in the #P-hard complexity class. Moreover, its approximation to within multiplicative error is a #P-hard problem as well. All current proofs of the hardness of simulating boson sampling on a classical computer rely on the strong computational consequences that its efficient simulation by a classical algorithm would have. Namely, these proofs show that an efficient classical simulation would imply the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy to its third level, a possibility that is considered very unlikely by the computer science community, due to its strong computational implications (in line with the strong implications of P=NP problem). Exact boson sampling The hardness proof of the exact boson sampling problem can be achieved following two distinct paths. Specifically, the first one uses the tools of the computational complexity theory and combines the following two facts: # Approximating the probability p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N) of a specific measurement outcome at the output of a linear interferometer to within a multiplicative constant is a #P-hard problem (due to the complexity of the permanent) # If a polynomial-time classical algorithm for exact boson sampling existed, then the above probability p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N) could have been approximated to within a multiplicative constant in the BPPNPcomplexity class, i.e. within the third level of the polynomial hierarchy When combined together these two facts along with the Toda's theorem result in the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy, which as mentioned above is highly unlikely to occur. This leads to the conclusion that there is no classical polynomial-time algorithm for the exact boson sampling problem. On the other hand, the alternative proof is inspired by a similar result for another restricted model of quantum computation ‚Äì the model of instantaneous quantum computing. Namely, the proof uses the KLM scheme, which says that linear optics with adaptive measurements is universal for the class BQP. It also relies on the following facts: # Linear optics with postselected measurements is universal for PostBQP, i.e. quantum polynomial- time class with postselection (a straightforward corollary of the KLM construction) # The class PostBQP is equivalent to PP (i.e. the probabilistic polynomial-time class): PostBQP = PP # The existence of a classical boson sampling algorithm implies the simulability of postselected linear optics in the PostBPP class (that is, classical polynomial-time with postselection, known also as the class BPPpath) Again, the combination of these three results, as in the previous case, results in the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. This makes the existence of a classical polynomial-time algorithm for the exact boson sampling problem highly unlikely. The best proposed classical algorithm for exact boson sampling runs in time O(n2^n+mn^2) for a system with n photons and m output modes. This algorithm leads to an estimate of 50 photons required to demonstrate quantum supremacy with boson sampling. There is also an open-source implementation in R. Approximate boson sampling The above hardness proofs are not applicable to the realistic implementation of a boson sampling device, due to the imperfection of any experimental setup (including the presence of noise, decoherence, photon losses, etc.). Therefore, for practical needs one necessitates the hardness proof for the corresponding approximate task. The latter consists of sampling from a probability distribution that is \\\\varepsilon close to the one given by p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N), in terms of the total variation distance. The understanding of the complexity of this problem relies then on several additional assumptions, as well as on two yet unproven conjectures. Specifically, the proofs of the exact boson sampling problem cannot be directly applied here, since they are based on the #P-hardness of estimating the exponentially-small probability p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N) of a specific measurement outcome. Thus, if a sampler \\"knew\\" which p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N) we wanted to estimate, then it could adversarially choose to corrupt it (as long as the task is approximate). That is why, the idea is to \\"hide\\" the above probability p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N) into an N√óN random unitary matrix. This can be done knowing that any M√óM submatrix of a unitary U, randomly chosen according to the Haar measure, is close in variation distance to a matrix of i.i.d. complex random Gaussian variables, provided that M ‚â§ N1/6 (Haar random matrices can be directly implemented in optical circuits by mapping independent probability density functions for their parameters, to optical circuit components, i.e., beam splitters and phase shifters). Therefore, if the linear optical circuit implements a Haar random unitary matrix, the adversarial sampler will not be able to detect which of the exponentially many probabilities p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N) we care about, and thus will not be able to avoid its estimation. In this case p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N) is proportional to the squared absolute value of the permanent of the M√óM matrix X\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)^{M\\\\times M}_{\\\\mathcal{C}} of i.i.d. Gaussians, smuggled inside U. These arguments bring us to the first conjecture of the hardness proof of approximate boson sampling problem ‚Äì the permanent-of-Gaussians conjecture: * Approximating the permanent of a matrix X\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)^{M\\\\times M}_{\\\\mathcal{C}} of i.i.d. Gaussians to within multiplicative error is a #P-hard task. Moreover, the above conjecture can be linked to the estimation of \\\\text{Perm}\\\\,X^2, which the given probability of a specific measurement outcome is proportional to. However to establish this link one has to rely on another conjecture ‚Äì the permanent anticoncentration conjecture: * There exists a polynomial Q such that for any M and Œ¥>0 the probability over M√óM matrices X\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)^{M\\\\times M}_{\\\\mathcal{C}} of the following inequality to hold is smaller than Œ¥: \\\\,\\\\text{Perm}\\\\,X<\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{M!}}{Q(M, 1/\\\\delta)}. By making use of the above two conjectures (which have several evidences of being true), the final proof eventually states that the existence of a classical polynomial-time algorithm for the approximate boson sampling task implies the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy. It is also worth mentioning another fact important to the proof of this statement, namely the so-called bosonic birthday paradox (in analogy with the well-known birthday paradox). The latter states that if M identical bosons are scattered among N‚â´M2 modes of a linear interferometer with no two bosons in the same mode, then with high probability two bosons will not be found in the same output mode either. This property has been experimentally observed with two and three photons in integrated interferometers of up to 16 modes. On the one hand this feature facilitates the implementation of a restricted boson sampling device. Namely, if the probability of having more than one photon at the output of a linear optical circuit is negligible, one does not require photon-number-resolving detectors anymore: on-off detectors will be sufficient for the realization of the setup. Although the probability p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N) of a specific measurement outcome at the output of the interferometer is related to the permanent of submatrices of a unitary matrix, a boson sampling machine does not allow its estimation. The main reason behind is that the corresponding detection probability is usually exponentially small. Thus, in order to collect enough statistics to approximate its value, one has to run the quantum experiment for exponentially long time. Therefore, the estimate obtained from a boson sampler is not more efficient that running the classical polynomial-time algorithm by Gurvits for approximating the permanent of any matrix to within additive error. Variants Scattershot boson sampling As already mentioned above, for the implementation of a boson sampling machine one necessitates a reliable source of many indistinguishable photons, and this requirement currently remains one of the main difficulties in scaling up the complexity of the device. Namely, despite recent advances in photon generation techniques using atoms, molecules, quantum dots and color centers in diamonds, the most widely used method remains the parametric down-conversion (PDC) mechanism. The main advantages of PDC sources are the high photon indistinguishability, collection efficiency and relatively simple experimental setups. However, one of the drawbacks of this approach is its non-deterministic (heralded) nature. Specifically, suppose the probability of generating a single photon by means of a PDC crystal is Œµ. Then, the probability of generating simultaneously M single photons is ŒµM, which decreases exponentially with M. In other words, in order to generate the input state for the boson sampling machine, one would have to wait for exponentially long time, which would kill the advantage of the quantum setup over a classical machine. Subsequently, this characteristic restricted the use of PDC sources to proof-of-principle demonstrations of a boson sampling device. Recently, however, a new scheme has been proposed to make the best use of PDC sources for the needs of boson sampling, greatly enhancing the rate of M-photon events. This approach has been named scattershot boson sampling, which consists of connecting N (N>M) heralded single-photon sources to different input ports of the linear interferometer. Then, by pumping all N PDC crystals with simultaneous laser pulses, the probability of generating M photons will be given as \\\\tbinom {N} {M}\\\\varepsilon^M. Therefore, for N‚â´M, this results in an exponential improvement in the single photon generation rate with respect to the usual, fixed-input boson sampling with M sources. This setting can also be seen as a problem of sampling N two-mode squeezed vacuum states generated from N PDC sources. Scattershot boson sampling is still intractable for a classical computer: in the conventional setup we fixed the columns that defined our M√óM submatrix and only varied the rows, whereas now we vary the columns too, depending on which M out of N PDC crystals generated single photons. Therefore, the proof can be constructed here similar to the original one. Furthermore, scattershot boson sampling has been also recently implemented with six photon-pair sources coupled to integrated photonic circuits of nine and thirteen modes, being an important leap towards a convincing experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy. The scattershot boson sampling model can be further generalized to the case where both legs of PDC sources are subject to linear optical transformations (in the original scattershot case, one of the arms is used for heralding, i.e., it goes through the identity channel). Such a twofold scattershot boson sampling model is also computationally hard, as proven by making use of the symmetry of quantum mechanics under time reversal. Gaussian boson sampling Another photonic implementation of boson sampling concerns Gaussian input states, i.e. states whose quasiprobability Wigner distribution function is a Gaussian one. The hardness of the corresponding sampling task can be linked to that of scattershot boson sampling. Namely, the latter can be embedded into the conventional boson sampling setup with Gaussian inputs. For this, one has to generate two-mode entangled Gaussian states and apply a Haar-random unitary U to their \\"right halves\\", while doing nothing to the others. Then we can measure the \\"left halves\\" to find out which of the input states contained a photon before we applied U. This is precisely equivalent to scattershot boson sampling, except for the fact that our measurement of the herald photons has been deferred till the end of the experiment, instead of happening at the beginning. Therefore, approximate Gaussian boson sampling can be argued to be hard under precisely the same complexity assumption as can approximate ordinary or scattershot boson sampling. Gaussian resources can be employed at the measurement stage, as well. Namely, one can define a boson sampling model, where a linear optical evolution of input single-photon states is concluded by Gaussian measurements (more specifically, by eight-port homodyne detection that projects each output mode onto a squeezed coherent state). Such a model deals with continuous-variable measurement outcome, which, under certain conditions, is a computationally hard task. Finally, a linear optics platform for implementing a boson sampling experiment where input single-photons undergo an active (non-linear) Gaussian transformation is also available. This setting makes use of a set of two-mode squeezed vacuum states as a prior resource, with no need of single-photon sources or in-line nonlinear amplification medium. Classically simulable boson sampling tasks The above results state that the existence of a polynomial-time classical algorithm for the original boson sampling scheme with indistinguishable single photons (in the exact and approximate cases), for scattershot, as well as for the general Gaussian boson sampling problems is highly unlikely. Nevertheless, there are some non-trivial realizations of the boson sampling problem that allow for its efficient classical simulation. One such example is when the optical circuit is injected with distinguishable single photons. In this case, instead of summing the probability amplitudes corresponding to photonic many- particle paths, one has to sum the corresponding probabilities (i.e. the squared absolute values of the amplitudes). Consequently, the detection probability p(t_1, t_2, ..., t_N) will be proportional to the permanent of submatrices of (component-wise) squared absolute value of the unitary U. The latter is now a non-negative matrix. Therefore, although the exact computation of the corresponding permanent is a #P-complete problem, its approximation can be performed efficiently on a classical computer, due to the seminal algorithm by Jerrum, Sinclaire and Vigoda. In other words, approximate boson sampling with distinguishable photons is efficiently classically simulable. Another instance of classically simulable boson sampling setups consists of sampling from the probability distribution of coherent states injected into the linear interferometer. The reason is that at the output of a linear optical circuit coherent states remain such, and do not create any quantum entanglement among the modes. More precisely, only their amplitudes are transformed, and the transformation can be efficiently calculated on a classical computer (the computation comprises matrix multiplication). This fact can be used to perform corresponding sampling tasks from another set of states: so-called classical states, whose Glauber-Sudarshan P function is a well-defined probability distribution. These states can be represented as a mixture of coherent states due to the optical equivalence theorem. Therefore, picking random coherent states distributed according to the corresponding P function, one can perform efficient classical simulation of boson sampling from this set of classical states., Experimental implementations Implementation of boson sampling The above requirements for the photonic boson sampling machine allow for its small-scale construction by means of existing technologies. Consequently, shortly after the theoretical model was introduced, four different groups simultaneously reported its realization. Specifically, this included the implementation of boson sampling with: * two and three photons scattered by a six-mode linear unitary transformation (represented by two orthogonal polarizations in 3√ó3 spatial modes of a fused-fiber beam splitter) by a collaboration between the University of Queensland and MIT * three photons in different modes of a six-mode silica-on-silicon waveguide circuit, by a collaboration between Universities of Oxford, Shanghai, London and Southampton * three photons in a femtosecond laser-written five-mode interferometer, by a collaboration between universities of Vienna and Jena * three photons in a femtosecond laser-written five-mode interferometer implementing a Haar-random unitary transformation, by a collaboration between Milan's Institute of Photonics and Nanotechnology, Universidade Federal Fluminense and Sapienza University of Rome. Later on, more complex boson sampling experiments have been performed, increasing the number of spatial modes of random interferometers up to 13 and 9 modes, and realizing a 6-mode fully reconfigurable integrated circuit. These experiments altogether constitute the proof-of-principle demonstrations of an operational boson sampling device, and route towards its larger-scale implementations. Implementation of scattershot boson sampling A first scattershot boson sampling experiment has been recently implemented using six photon-pair sources coupled to integrated photonic circuits with 13 modes. The 6 photon- pair sources were obtained via type-II PDC processes in 3 different nonlinear crystals (exploiting the polarization degree of freedom). This allowed to sample simultaneously between 8 different input states. The 13-mode interferometer was realized by femtosecond laser-writing technique on alumino- borosilicate glass. This experimental implementation represents a leap towards an experimental demonstration of the quantum computational supremacy. Proposals with alternative photonic platform There are several other proposals for the implementation of photonic boson sampling. This includes, e.g., the scheme for arbitrarily scalable boson sampling using two nested fiber loops. In this case, the architecture employs time-bin encoding, whereby the incident photons form a pulse train entering the loops. Meanwhile, dynamically controlled loop coupling ratios allow the construction of arbitrary linear interferometers. Moreover, the architecture employs only a single point of interference and may thus be easier to stabilize than other implementations. Another approach relies on the realization of unitary transformations on temporal modes based on dispersion and pulse shaping. Namely, passing consecutively heralded photons through time-independent dispersion and measuring the output time of the photons is equivalent to a boson sampling experiment. With time-dependent dispersion, it is also possible to implement arbitrary single-particle unitaries. This scheme requires a much smaller number of sources and detectors and do not necessitate a large system of beam splitters. Certification of boson sampling: theory and experiments The output of a universal quantum computer running, for example, Shor's factoring algorithm, can be efficiently verified classically, as is the case for all problems in the non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP) complexity class. It is however not clear that a similar structure exists for the boson sampling scheme. Namely, as the latter is related to the problem of estimating matrix permanents (falling into #P-hard complexity class), it is not understood how to verify correct operation for large versions of the setup. Specifically, the naive verification of the output of a boson sampler by computing the corresponding measurement probabilities represents a problem intractable for a classical computer. A first relevant question is whether it is possible or not to distinguish between uniform and boson-sampling distributions by performing a polynomial number of measurements. The initial argument introduced in Ref. stated that as long as one makes use of symmetric measurement settings the above is impossible (roughly speaking a symmetric measurement scheme does not allow for labeling the output modes of the optical circuit). However, within current technologies the assumption of a symmetric setting is not justified (the tracking of the measurement statistics is fully accessible), and therefore the above argument does not apply. It is then possible to define a rigorous and efficient test to discriminate the boson sampling statistics from an unbiased probability distribution. The corresponding discriminator is correlated to the permanent of the submatrix associated with a given measurement pattern, but can be efficiently calculated. This test has been applied experimentally to distinguish between a boson sampling and a uniform distribution in the 3-photon regime with integrated circuits of 5, 7, 9 and 13 modes, as well as 9 modes. The test above does not distinguish between more complex distributions, such as quantum and classical, or between fermionic and bosonic statistics. A physically motivated scenario to be addressed is the unwanted introduction of distinguishability between photons, which destroys quantum interference (this regime is readily accessible experimentally, for example by introducing temporal delay between photons). The opportunity then exists to tune between ideally indistinguishable (quantum) and perfectly distinguishable (classical) data and measure the change in a suitably constructed metric. This scenario can be addressed by a statistical test which performs a one-on-one likelihood comparison of the output probabilities. This test requires the calculation of a small number of permanents, but does not need the calculation of the full expected probability distribution. Experimental implementation of the test has been successfully reported in integrated laser-written circuits for both the standard boson sampling (3 photons in 7-, 9- and 13-mode interferometers) and the scattershot version (3 photons in 9- and 13-mode interferometers with different input states). Another possibility is based on the bunching property of indinguishable photons. One can analyze the probability to find a k-fold coincidence measurement outcomes (without any multiply populated input mode), which is significantly higher for distinguishable particles than for bosons due to the bunching tendency of the latters. Finally, leaving the space of random matrices one may focus on specific multimode setups with certain features. In particular, the analysis of the effect of bosonic clouding (the tendency for bosons to favor events with all particles in the same half of the output array of a continuous-time many-particle quantum walk) has been proven to discriminate the behavior of distinguishable and indistinguishable particles in this specific platform. A different approach to confirm that the boson sampling machine behaves as the theory predicts is to make use of fully reconfigurable optical circuits. With large-scale single-photon and multiphoton interference verified with predictable multimode correlations in a fully characterized circuit, a reasonable assumption is that the system maintains correct operation as the circuit is continuously reconfigured to implement a random unitary operation. To this end, one can exploit quantum suppression laws (the probability of specific input-output combinations is suppressed when the linear interferometer is described by a Fourier matrix or other matrices with relevant symmetries). These suppression laws can be classically predicted in efficient ways. This approach allows also to exclude other physical models, such as mean-field states, which mimic some collective multiparticle properties (including bosonic clouding). The implementation of a Fourier matrix circuit in a fully reconfigurable 6-mode device has been reported, and experimental observations of the suppression law have been shown for 2 photons in 4- and 8-mode Fourier matrices. Alternative implementations and applications Apart from the photonic realization of the boson sampling task, several other setups have been proposed. This includes, e.g., the encoding of bosons into the local transverse phonon modes of trapped ions. The scheme allows deterministic preparation and high-efficiency readout of the corresponding phonon Fock states and universal manipulation of the phonon modes through a combination of inherent Coulomb interaction and individual phase shifts. This scheme is scalable and relies on the recent advances in ion trapping techniques (several dozens of ions can be successfully trapped, for example, in linear Paul traps by making use of anharmonic axial potentials). Another platform for implementing the boson sampling setup is a system of interacting spins: recent observation show that boson sampling with M particles in N modes is equivalent to the short-time evolution with M excitations in the XY model of 2N spins. One necessitates several additional assumptions here, including small boson bunching probability and efficient error postselection. This scalable scheme, however, is rather promising, in the light of considerable development in the construction and manipulation of coupled superconducting qubits and specifically the D-Wave machine. The task of boson sampling shares peculiar similarities with the problem of determining molecular vibronic spectra: a feasible modification of the boson sampling scheme results in a setup that can be used for the reconstruction of a molecule's Franck‚ÄìCondon profiles (for which no efficient classical algorithm is currently known). Specifically, the task now is to input specific squeezed coherent states into a linear interferometer that is determined by the properties of the molecule of interest. Therefore, this prominent observation makes the interest towards the implementation of the boson sampling task to get spread well beyond the fundamental basis. It has also been suggested to use a superconducting resonator network Boson Sampling device as an interferometer. This application is assumed to be practical, as small changes in the couplings between the resonators will change the sampling results. Sensing of variation in the parameters capable of altering the couplings is thus achieved, when comparing the sampling results to an unaltered reference. Variants of the boson sampling model have been used to construct classical computational algorithms, aimed, e.g., at the estimation of certain matrix permanents (for instance, permanents of positive-semidefinite matrices related to the corresponding open problem in computer scienceSee open problem (4) at ) by combining tools proper to quantum optics and computational complexity. Coarse-grained boson sampling has been proposed as a resource of decision and function problems that are computationally hard, and may thus have cryptographic applications.

The bridge was built between 1785 and 1787 and designed by David Edwards, the son of William Edwards who built the Old Bridge at Pontypridd. The bridge straddles the border between Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion. It is both a Grade II* listed structure and a scheduled monument. History and construction The bridge viewed from downstream north bank (Carmarthenshire right, Ceredigion left) A bridge over the River Teifi at Cenarth has existed at least since 1188, when it was mentioned in the writings of Gerald of Wales. The present bridge was constructed between 1785 and 1787 by Messrs Watkins and Webb. It was designed by David Edwards (born 1748), who also built the Llandeilo Yr Ynys bridge near Nantgaredig earlier in 1786 and the later Newport Bridge. Kenarth Bridge c. 1840 by Henry Gastineau The bridge was designed to carry horse-drawn vehicles and has three stone arches which span , and . The bridge is made of ashlar masonry and rubble stone with the parapet coping in rough slate. The design includes two cylindrical holes (perforated spandrels) in diameter, one either side of the central span. The holes were included in the design to reduce the weight of the structure and also to allow floodwaters to pass through them, instead of going over the top of the bridge: while the river appears to flow only under the southern arch, when in full flood the Teifi flows through all three arches. This feature was used by Edwards's father William, who used six holes in the Old Bridge at Pontypridd to reduce the weight and pressure on the centre section. The accounts for the local quarter sessions show that in 1787 David Edwards was paid ¬£2.12s.2d (GB¬£2.63) for half his fee. Therefore his total fee for the bridge was ¬£5.4s.4d. In 2014, this would have been worth between ¬£6,600 and ¬£9,100. The bridge was widened in 1852 by Richard Kyrke Penson to make the right-angled bend at the north end easier to negotiate. The bridge joins two counties, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion. It forms part of the former turnpike, now the A484 road, from Carmarthen to Cardigan. It is wide, but it has no footpaths. It is still being used by motor traffic in the 2010s with a speed limit of . The bridge was Grade II* listed in the 1960s, with the Carmarthenshire southern end listed on 21 September 1964 and the Ceredigion northern end listed later on 23 June 1967. The bridge is also a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

Registrants work in NHS hospitals, private health care, academic institutions and the medical device industry. History The Register was formed in August 2000 as the Voluntary Register of Clinical Technologists (VCRT), with the aim of protecting the public by advocating statutory, professional regulation for Clinical Technologists. Management of the Register was undertaken by members of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine (IPEM), the Association of Renal Technologists and the Institution of Incorporated Engineers (now the Institution of Engineering and Technology). At its formation, the Register was designed to be a platform for the Clinical Technologist profession‚Äôs campaign for statutory regulation with the then Health Professions‚Äô Council (HPC). However, in 2011 the UK Government Command Paper ‚ÄòEnabling Excellence: Autonomy and Accountability for Health and Social Care Staff‚Äô stated that extensions to statutory regulation \\"will only be considered where there is a compelling case on the basis of a public safety risk and where assured voluntary registers are not considered sufficient to manage this risk\\", and indicated that the way forward would be via assured voluntary registration. This was subsequently developed into a system of Accredited Registers administered by the Profession Standards Authority (PSA). In 2013, at the request of the VCRT Management Panel, the management of the register was integrated into the professional work of IPEM, in order to provide a firmer footing for an application to the PSA to become an Accredited Register. In 2015, the Register was successful in achieving accreditation.

She was secretary of the Scottish War Savings Committee during World War I, and an editor of Everyman magazine.  Early life  Jean Henderson Findlay was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, the daughter of Aberdeen hat merchant George Findlay and Jane Elmslie Henderson. Her father died in May 1885, seven months before her birth; her mother died in early January 1886, two weeks after giving birth. In a court case later that year, to claim a third of her father's estate, her curator at litem was Harry Cheyne; the claim was repelled.  Career  In 1914, Findlay began writing a contributor to the journal Everyman, and was a war correspondent from Flanders. She published a translation of Pierre Nothomb's The Barbarians in Belgium, and made a lecture tour of Canada in 1915, to raise funds for war relief in Belgium. For her efforts, she received the Queen Elisabeth Medal from the Belgian government. Findlay was acting editor of Everyman from 1915 to 1917. In 1918, her translation of √âmile Vandervelde's Three Aspects of the Russian Revolution was published. From 1916 to 1923, she was director of the Scottish War Savings Committee. She was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1920, for her contributions to the war effort. In 1926, she became the first Viscountess Dunedin, when her husband became a Viscount. She spoke at a meeting of the Manchester Publicity Association in 1930, on the limitations of advertising. Also in 1930, she traveled with her husband to visit Freeman Freeman-Thomas, the Governor-General of Canada, and attend meetings of the Canadian Bar Association and American Bar Association. She returned to the editor's position at Everyman for a year, from 1933 to 1934.  Personal life  In 1923, Jean Henderson Findlay married widower Andrew Graham Murray, 1st Viscount Dunedin, a Scottish politician, and judge, as his second spouse. They had no children and the title died with their deaths. Jean Henderson Findlay was widowed when Murray died in 1942, and she died from cancer in London in 1944, aged 58 years.

It was most probably the central part of a relatively small folding altarpiece. Kaufmann Crucifixion, Gem√§ldegalerie Berlin  History of the painting  The picture was probably painted in Prague. It was acquired from the Berlin collection of Richard von Kaufmann (1849-1908) by the Berlin art dealers Pavel Cassirer and F.W. Lippmann along with Hugo Helbing from Munich, who donated it to the then Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin. From there, the picture found its way to the Gem√§ldegalerie Berlin.  Description and context  The tempera painting on a wooden panel covered with stretched canvas is 67 x 29.5 cm in size. It was restored in 1918 and fixed to a fresh canvas base. In the Bohemian context, it is the first known depiction of Calvary with three crosses and a complexity of events beneath them, which both point to an Italian influence.Royt J., 2003, p. 63 The composition of space and the use of perspectival shortening are also Italian in origin. At the same time, other elements of the painting such as the wealth of rhythm in the figures‚Äô movement, the sharp drawing, the plastic modelling and the Gothic vividness of colour also point to Lower Austrian and western European (French) models.J. Pe≈°ina, 1976, p. 28 The dramatically focused naturalism is something of an exception to the otherwise lyrical atmosphere of Bohemian painting.A. Kutal, 1972, p. 57 Although the overall stylistic conception of the picture has a number of features that correspond to the work of the Master of the Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod Altarpiece, it is in fact a later work by another artist that represents a progression from mystically religious expression to a dramatic presentation of reality and the intensifying of its effect. Opinion is divided among art historians as to the work's Bohemian origin, some of them considering it to be the work of an Austrian artist who emerged from the workshop of the Master of the Klosterneuburg Altarpiece (de: Meister der R√ºckseite des Verduner Altars).G. Schmidt: Zur Kaufmann‚Äôschen Kreuzigung. In: G. Schmidt: Malerei der Gotik. Fixpunkte und Ausblicke.

Several of its motifs were later often adopted, especially that of the man sitting on the ground with one leg bent and the other stretched out. Works inspired by the Kaufmann Crucifixion can be evidenced in surviving panel paintings, though also in manuscript illuminations in Bohemia and other countries.J.

It provides economic analysis to competition regulators, law firms and their clients, from preliminary investigation to expert testimony. Fideres was founded following the 2008 financial crisis.  History  Fideres is a privately owned partnership established in 2009 by Alberto Thomas and Steffen Hennig, and joined in 2016 by Markus Niemeier. Fideres has assisted litigation cases and provided research on financial market manipulation with work, among others, on LIBOR, FX, cryptocurrency market manipulation, and ISDAFIX. As of 2020, the firm employs 22 people across the UK, the United States, Germany and South Africa, with offices in London, Frankfurt, New York and Johannesburg.  Services   Expert Services  Fideres works alongside law firms during the trial and pre-trial phase providing: *Economic investigations, *Valuation and damages analysis, *Expert reports, *Evidence in court and cross examination.  Research  Research provided by Fideres focuses on the technical aspects of failed financial products and inefficient markets and has received press coverage by various media outlets. Their research into the debt market, and government economic policies, such as CBILS, was also covered by the media. Their work analyzing trading patterns in foreign exchange markets was also featured on BBC Radio 4 in reference to the FOREX scandal. In 2016, Fideres's cofounder Alberto Thomas appeared on Sky News to discuss the ethics of Hedge Funds conducting and trading upon private exit polls for the UK. = Gold Price Manipulation = Fideres's research showed that between January 2010 and December 2013 the price of gold may have been manipulated on \\"50 per cent of occasions,\\" observing \\"instances of sharp movements in the price of the metal\\" during the two daily conference calls between Barclays, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Scotiabank and Societe Generale, a process called \\"London gold fixing\\". Thomas called it an \\"anachronistic way\\" of setting the price for gold. The findings were also reported on the Financial Times, but according to Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee the article, titled \\"Fears Over Gold Price Rigging Put Investors on Alert\\", was deleted from the FT website for being \\"too sensitive\\". = Closet Indexers = In 2014, fund groups faced investigation for misleading investors into buying so-called \\"closet indexers\\", funds sold as actively managed but behave like index trackers. Based on an analysis of 1,147 US equity funds with more than $1bn in assets, Fideres had found that 15 per cent of funds in the sample were closet indexers, concluding that investors could have been entitled to \\"billions of dollars\\" in damages. = Collateralized Loan Obligations = With the global economy under pressure in 2020, debt markets came under scrutiny. Fideres was referenced in the media stating that significant losses will be felt by bondholders who own bonds rated BBB or below.https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/april-cover-containing-market- fallout-in-the-abs-world = Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme = Following the economic shutdown triggered by COVID-19, the UK government announced a business loan scheme to support affected businesses. At the time of the announcement, Fideres was quoted in a number of articles addressing the CBILS central proposals.  Notable Cases   Corporate Bond Under-Pricing  Research conducted by Fideres found evidence of systemic overpricing in the bond market. Bloomberg and Reuters reported on the study, which analyzed the pricing of corporate bonds for the period 2010-2015. It estimated that, due to the mis-pricing carried out by the banks, US corporations may have lost up ‚Äúto $18 billion‚Äù when they issued debt. Business Insider UK considered the research particularly ‚Äúnoteworthy‚Äù in relation to the size of the bond market while Tracy Alloway, executive editor of Bloomberg, wrote on her Twitter account that the story may represent a \\"Libor moment in the bond market,‚Äù in reference to the LIBOR scandal.  LIBOR Manipulation  After the LIBOR scandal broke in 2012, Thomas appeared as a witness at a Treasury Select Committee hearing on benchmark manipulation on 2 July 2014. The role of committee was to review the banking sector after banks were found to manipulate various financial benchmarks to their gain. Thomas talked about why and how the manipulation had occurred, the facts related to the manipulation, and suggested a three-point plan which could help prevent it going forward.  FOREX Market Rigging  In 2014, Fideres supplied a research highlighting \\"unusual\\" price spikes in euro, sterling and other major currencies for the City of Philadelphia Board of Pensions and Retirement's class action lawsuit against major Forex dealer banks. The suit claimed that seven different banks (Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS) had \\"deliberately\\" been manipulating the price of FX trading around the 4pm daily fixing.  ISDAfix Rigging  In 2014, more than a dozen financial institutions, including Bank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo, faced allegations of attempting to manipulate the ISDAfix rate used for derivative contracts. The allegations were based on a research conducted and compiled by Fideres, which alleged that the defendant banks had submitted the same or virtually the same dollar ISDAfix rate quotes almost every day from 2009 to 2012, ‚Äúdown to five decimal points,\\" resulting in the official ISDAfix rate and the banks‚Äô contributions being identical to the ICAP reference rate \\"well over 90% of the time for at least four years.‚Äù  Cryptocurrency Market Manipulation  Tether, a cryptocurrency stablecoin, which states that its coins are pegged 1:1 with the US dollar, had a class action filed against it in November 2019 alleging that Tether issuances had been timed to trigger movements in the price of Bitcoin.

Of the three stereoisomers, meso-zeaxanthin is the second most abundant in nature after 3R,3¬¥R-zeaxanthin, which is produced by plants and algae. To date, meso-zeaxanthin has been identified in specific tissues of marine organisms and in the macula lutea, also known as the \\"yellow spot\\", of the human retina.  Occurrence in nature and in food supplements  Carotenoids are essential for animal life, but animals cannot produce them. Indeed, animals obtain carotenoids from diet, with herbivores sourcing them from plants or algae, and carnivores, in turn, sourcing them from herbivores. However, there is a general consensus that meso-zeaxanthin is not present in plants, except for marine species. Originally, it was suggested that meso- zeaxanthin was non-dietary in origin and generated at the macula (the central part of the retina) from retinal lutein (another xanthophyll carotenoid found in the human diet), but this work (limited to animal studies) has since been refuted. Indeed, and consistent with the work by Maoka in 1986, Nolan et al. have shown that meso-zeaxanthin is present in the skin of trout, sardine and salmon, and in the flesh of trout. In a subsequent publication, Nolan's group detected and quantified the three stereoisomers of zeaxanthin, including meso- zeaxanthin, in the flesh of two different trout species. This is the first publication to report the concentrations of meso-zeaxanthin in a habitually consumed food. Using data from this publication, it is estimated that when an average sized trout (circa 200 g) is consumed, 0.2 mg of natural meso- zeaxanthin is obtained from this source. Moreover, canned sardines can also be considered as a habitual source of meso-zeaxanthin for humans, as sardines presented commercially in this way contain a significant amount of skin, which contains meso-zeaxanthin. However, the concentration of meso-zeaxanthin in sardine skin has not been determined yet. Previously to this research, a publication from Khachick et al., (2002) reported that liver from Japanese Quail (Coturnix japonica) and frog plasma contain meso-zeaxanthin. Of note, frog legs are consumed habitually in France, as they are considered a delicacy of French cuisine. Also, it is possible that meso-zeaxanthin is generated from other carotenoids consumed in the diet, as carotenoids are known to convert into different carotenoids for functional reasons. For example, it has been suggested that meso-zeaxanthin of trout integuments is derived from astaxanthin, and meso-zeaxanthin in primates (macula lutea) is derived (at least in part) from lutein. Specific commercially available food supplements actively use meso-zeaxanthin in their supplement formulations, in order to increase eye concentrations of these nutrients, and in an attempt to support macular health. These supplements contain 10 mg of meso-zeaxanthin, along with 10 mg of lutein and 2 mg of zeaxanthin. A recent study conducted to test the concordance of carotenoid concentrations of commercially available food supplements to their label claim found that the measured lutein concentrations (in all the supplements tested) was close to the declared amounts, but that the zeaxanthin concentrations measured varied greatly. In addition, in some of the formulations tested, it was found that meso-zeaxanthin was present in the formulation, even though this carotenoid was not declared on the supplement product labels. The authors concluded that the presence of meso-zeaxanthin in these formulations was likely due to the process used to extract lutein from the marigold petal.  In the macula  Distribution of macular pigments constituent carotenoids presented in scale onto a photograph of a healthy human retina Meso-zeaxanthin, lutein, and 3R,3¬¥R-zeaxanthin are the main carotenoids in the macula lutea, found in a ratio of 1:1:1, and are collectively referred to as macular pigment (MP). Meso-zeaxanthin is concentrated at the epicentre of the macula, where it accounts for around 50% of MP at this location, with lutein dominating the peripheral macula (see figure 2).  As an antioxidant and short-wavelength light filter  Of the three macular carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin), meso- zeaxanthin is the most powerful antioxidant, but a combination of the macular carotenoids has been shown to exhibit greatest antioxidant potential, when compared to the individual carotenoids at the same total concentration. This may explain why the human macula uniquely contains these three carotenoids from the circa 700 carotenoids present in nature. Also, it has been shown that the combination of the carotenoids results in optimal light filtration (i.e. filtration of short-wavelength [blue] light) at the macula. This is important because short-wavelength light incident at the macula causes chromatic aberration and light scatter, phenomena that adversely impact on visual function and result in poor contrast sensitivity. Meso-zeaxanthin is in the ideal location and has the ideal antioxidant and light-filtering properties to protect the macula and enhance visual performance.  Use in supplements aimed at eye health  In 2013, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) reported a reduced risk of visual loss and a reduced risk of disease progression in patients with non-advanced age-related macular degeneration (AMD, the leading cause of blindness in the Western World; Taylor and Keeffe, 2001) who were supplemented with a formulation containing the macular carotenoids and co-antioxidants (The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) Research Group, 2013, 2014). Unfortunately, the AREDS2 preparation only contained two of macular pigment‚Äôs three carotenoids (lutein and 3R,3¬¥R-zeaxanthin), and did not include meso-zeaxanthin, which is the dominant carotenoid at the very centre of the macula, and the presence of which is essential for maximum collective antioxidant effect. In recent years, however, studies have shown that the addition of meso-zeaxanthin to formulations used to increase MP and enhance visual function in diseased and non-diseased retinas has proven very effective. Indeed, six head-to-head trials have shown that a formulation containing all three macular carotenoids in a meso- zeaxanthin:lutein:zeaxanthin (mg) ratio of 10:10:2 is superior to alternative formulations, in terms of visual improvements and in terms of observed increases in MP (the precise aim of supplementation). For a detailed description see the human safety studies below.  Use in poultry industries  Broiler chickens are yellow when they are fed with carotenoid-containing feed, as these carotenoids are accumulated in skin and subcutaneous fat of the animal. Carotenoid deposition is also the cause of the yellow colour of egg yolk. For this reason, poultry producers add carotenoids (typically lutein, zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin and Œ≤-apo-8¬¥-apocarotenal) to the feed to increase the attractiveness of the final product for the consumer, but also to support animal health. It is believed that lutein and zeaxanthin act synergistically to increase the yellow hue, whereas zeaxanthin is more powerful than lutein due to its larger chromophore.Torres-Cardona, M.D., Torres-Quiroga, J., (1996). Process for the isomerization of lutein. Industrial Organica, S.A. de C.V., Monterrey, Mexico, US. Therefore, a number of companies use marigold extract where a percentage of lutein has been converted into zeaxanthin (the meso form, meso-zeaxanthin) in order to supplement broilers and hens with both carotenoids. The isomer of zeaxanthin obtained from lutein is meso-zeaxanthin due to the nature of the technique used (see below). Indeed, meso-zeaxanthin has been identified in eggs from Mexico and California.  Production  Conversion of lutein to meso-zeaxanthin Meso-zeaxanthin is produced at an industrial level from the lutein obtained from marigold petals. The process involves saponification set at high temperature and high base concentrations, and leads to the isomerization of the 4¬¥-5¬¥double bond to the position 5¬¥-6¬¥. This converts the …õ-ring of lutein into a Œ≤-ring, thus converting lutein into meso-zeaxanthin. The stereochemistry of this zeaxanthin is determined by the position of the hydroxyl group at the position 3¬¥, which results in the \\"S\\" in the final zeaxanthin molecule.Andrewes, A.G., (1974). Isomerization of epsilon-carotene to beta-carotene and of Lutein to Zeaxanthin. Acta Chemica Scandinavica B 28(1), 137-138.Andrewes, A.G., Borch, G.L., Liaaen-Jensen, S., (1974). Carotenoids of Higher Plants 7. * On the Absolute Configuration of Lutein. Acta Chemica Scandinavica B 28(1), 139-140. Therefore, the stereoisomer produced by this process is 3R,3¬¥S-zeaxanthin (i.e. meso- zeaxanthin). The conditions of this saponification can be modulated in order to increase or decrease the conversion rate of lutein into meso-zeaxanthin.  Safety  When a molecule is used commercially for human consumption, its safety has to be proven. First, it has to be shown that the molecule is innocuous for animal health, even when consumed at doses higher than the usual daily intake. The molecule can then be used in human studies.  Animal studies  Meso-zeaxanthin has been tested for toxicity by several different research teams,Chang, (2006). Thirteen-week oral (gavage) toxicity of meso- zeaxanthin in Han Wistar rats with a 4-week recovery. with all these studies confirming the safety of this compound. A summary of the results of these studies are as follows: # Chang et al demonstrated that the NOAEL ('No Observed-Adverse-Effect Level') was in excess of 200 mg/kg/day, far greater than doses used in dietary supplements, which are typically <0.5 mg/kg/day. Absence of mutagenicity was confirmed in the same study, using the Ames test. # Xu et al concluded that meso-zeaxanthin has no acute toxicity and no genotoxicity and the use of meso-zeaxanthin is safe at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight per day in rats from a 90 day feeding study. The authors then applied a 100 fold safety factor, and reported an ADI (acceptable daily intake) of 3 mg/kg body weight per day for meso-zeaxanthin. # Thurnham et al demonstrated (in a rat model) that amounts of meso-zeaxanthin of 2, 20 and 200 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks had no adverse effects on animal health. In other words, the NOAEL is >200 mg meso-zeaxanthin/kg body weight and this is at least 1400 times higher than the typical supplement dose. Genotoxicity testing indicated that amounts of meso-zeaxanthin from 10 to 5000 ¬µg/plate with or without microsomal enzymes did not increase mutation rates in five bacterial tester strains. In summary, the NOAEL effect of meso-zeaxanthin is far greater than doses used in dietary supplements. In 2011, the GRAS ('Generally Regarded As Safe') status of meso-zeaxanthin was acknowledged by the FDA in a reply to a proposal from a US company on the status of meso-zeaxanthin (plus L and Z).  Human safety studies  Of note, meso-zeaxanthin is a regular dietary component in countries where it is a major pigment used by the poultry industry, particularly Mexico, and no adverse effects have been reported. In addition, the safety of meso-zeaxanthin has been tested in human clinical trials. The first study to evaluate the effects of a dietary supplement containing predominantly meso-zeaxanthin was conducted in a Miami Florida research laboratory by Professors Bone and Landrum. This research confirmed that meso-zeaxanthin was effectively absorbed into the serum, and MP density was increased significantly in the supplementation group. No such increases were observed in the placebo group. In another study done in Northern Ireland, 19 subjects consumed a supplement also composed of all three macular carotenoids, including meso-zeaxanthin over a period of 22 days. Results demonstrated that meso-zeaxanthin was absorbed. At the Institute of Vision Research, Waterford Institute of Technology, the Meso-zeaxanthin Ocular Supplementation Trials (MOST), have been conducted to evaluate safety, MP response and serum carotenoid response in subjects with and without AMD, following consumption of a supplement containing all three macular carotenoids in which meso-zeaxanthin was predominant. These studies confirmed safety for human consumption of the macular carotenoids following many biological tests to assess renal and liver function, lipid profile, hematologic profile, and markers of inflammation. Also, the MOST trials identified statistically significant increases in serum concentrations of meso-zeaxanthin and lutein from baseline. Significant increases in central MP levels were also observed after just two weeks of supplementation. Furthermore, in patients who had an atypical MP distribution in the eye (i.e. they did not have the high concentration of pigment in the centre of the macula), when supplemented with a meso-zeaxanthin dominant supplement for 8 weeks, the more normal pigment profile was re-instated, whereas this was not the case when supplemented with a formulation lacking meso-zeaxanthin. The main findings from the MOST trials in patients with AMD were published in 2013 and 2015. The series of publications from these trials concluded \\"Augmentation of the MP optical density across its spatial profile and enhancements in contrast sensitivity were best achieved after supplementation with a formulation containing high doses of meso-zeaxanthin in combination with lutein and zeaxanthin\\". Also, the final publication from this work, published in 2015, concluded that \\"The inclusion of meso-zeaxanthin in a supplement formulation seems to confer benefits in terms of MP augmentation and in terms of enhanced contrast sensitivity in subjects with early AMD. An important and novel finding rests on the observation that sustained supplementation with the macular carotenoids seems necessary to maximally augment MP and to optimize contrast sensitivity over a 3-year period in patients with early AMD\\". In 2016 and 2017, two major clinical trials were published in the international journal, Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science (IOVS). These studies were funded by the European Research Council (Ref: 281096). The first trial, the CREST (Central Retinal Enrichment Supplementation Trials) normal study involved 105 volunteers who underwent a series of complex tests of vision and were supplemented over a 12-month period. Of the 105 subjects, 53 received daily active supplements containing meso-zeaxanthin, lutein and zeaxanthin, while 52 subjects received a placebo (the control group). The outcome unequivocally demonstrates that those receiving macular carotenoids ‚Äì lutein, zeaxanthin and meso-zeaxanthin ‚Äì enjoyed meaningful benefits to their visual function. The improvement recorded was primarily in people‚Äôs contrast sensitivity ‚Äì how much contrast a person needs to see a target (i.e. how faint an object can you see).This work demonstrates important implications for those who rely on their vision for professional reasons, such as high-performance sportspeople (most obviously golfers, cricketers, tennis and baseball players), motorists, train drivers, pilots, and police. The second trial, CREST AMD was a major two-year trial involving over 100 people diagnosed with the early stages of AMD, and has shown an improvement in the vision of those taking a dietary supplement of carotenoids. Those living with AMD would usually have been expected to experience a continued deterioration in their vision over the two years of the clinical trial. Instead, those receiving carotenoids showed a significant improvement across 24 out of 32 tests of vision. 35% of trial participants had what is deemed to be a clinically meaningful improvement in their vision after 24 months, but only in the active supplement containing meso-zeaxanthin. Improvements in vision were particularly marked among those receiving all three carotenoids compared to those receiving only zeaxanthin and lutein. The research was conducted by a team from the Nutrition Research Centre Ireland (NRCI) at Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT).

Built in the early 19th century for ironworkers, the cottage is best known as the birthplace of the famous Welsh composer Joseph Parry (1841‚Äì1903). It is now open to the public as a museum. Location The cottage is located on the north-western edge of Merthyr Tydfil, directly west of the River Taff. The Chapel Row cottages have historical links to the former Cyfarthfa Ironworks, which was a major source of local employment in the 19th century. Such was the significance of the ironworks that it attracted many from over the country, who were seeking employment at the works. As a result, the Chapel Row cottages were built in the 1820s to house the burgeoning population of local workers, particularly those employed by the industrial Crawshay family. Built specifically for skilled workers, the cottages contained features such as large outdoor spaces to allow for future expansion of the cottages. Structure 4 Chapel Row is a strong example of a skilled ironworker's‚Äô cottage. The architectural style is consistent with prevailing construction norms of the day. The cottage is a typical two storey house located in a terraced row with exterior features such as a continuous slate roof, small pane windows and pale quoins. Much of the materials used in the construction of the cottage came from nearby areas. In the valleys above the area, located in the Brecon Beacons, many natural resources could be found such as limestone, ironstone, sandstone. These locally sourced materials were used to construct the cottages, which were then leased to Crawshay family workers. Features Many of the interior features in the modern day cottage have been restored, and now represent a typical 19th-century Victorian cottage. The interior also acts as a reflection of the living conditions for those who were employed at the ironworks. The first and most obvious feature of the cottage is the restored living room, which acted as the heart of Victorian households. Not only was it a living area, but it was also where domestic activities such as cooking, washing and ironing took place. Typical features of the living room include the stove, which contained a bread oven; it was this that was used for cooking, providing heat for the cottage and for heating the iron in order to perform domestic tasks. The living room also contains a dining table along with basic kitchen utensils such as a kettle and cutlery. A traditional longcase clock is also located at the centre of the room, although now out of use it was a common aesthetic in the 19th century. Also located on the ground floor is the bedroom in which Joseph Parry was born, also restored; it contains an old-fashioned wooden cradle and also a linen chest. Outdoors features included the outdoor toilet in the garden. This was a common sanitary feature of contemporary time; inevitably contributing to the spread of disease in the area. The cottages features continued to be maintained in the modern day. Modern day The cottage on Chapel Row is now a museum dedicated mainly to the life of Joseph Parry, but also to act as a snapshot of the living conditions in the 19th century in Merthyr Tydfil. Many of the traditional features of the cottage been restored and are now on display at the museum. The cottages on Chapel Row were reprieved from demolition in the early 1970s and were restored between 1976 and 1977. The first floor of the cottage today has been converted into a tribute of the career of Joseph Parry, with many of his photos and other documents framed for the public to view. Other items include an organ and copies of some of his compositions. The first floor also gives further background to Merthyr Tydfil's industrial past. Parry's home was recently refurbished through funds from a local company and was reopened to the public beginning on what would have been the composer's 175th birthday. The home is now part of the Cyfarthfa Heritage Area.

It is a Grade I listed building. St William's College facade. The curved wood protrusions are probably repurposed ship frames. The college was founded in 1460 by George Neville and the Earl of Warwick to house twenty-three priests and a provost.Peter F. Ryder, Medieval Buildings of Yorkshire, p.22 It was named after St William of York. In 1465, work started on the present building. This courtyard structure may incorporate parts of two earlier houses. It included a great hall to the north, with a chapel to its east. The hall survives in part, but its ceiling has been lowered and the plasterwork was replaced in 1910. The posts of a screens passage also remain, the other side of which is the fireplace of the original kitchen. It has been suggested that doorways led off the courtyard to staircases, with rooms for the provost and fellows of the college leading off them.Nikolaus Pevsner and David Neave, The Buildings of England: Yorkshire: York and the East Riding (2nd Edition), pp.208‚Äì209 While the college was not a monastic establishment, it was affected by the Dissolution of the Monasteries, as in 1548 the building was converted to a substantial house, with later tenants including Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle. Around this time, a single main staircase was added, which survives, while a room to the south-west has remains of wall paintings from this era. In the seventeenth century, the \\"Bishop's Chamber\\" was created on the first floor, to the west of the great hall, and it survives largely intact. In the eighteenth-century, part of the ground floor was used for retail, and bow windows were added, which still survive. Otherwise, the fa√ßade generally survives as built, with an ashlar ground floor and a timber- framed, jettied upper floor. The doorway itself is a replacement, but the coats of arms above are from about 1670, and carvings of Saint Christopher and the Virgin and Child either side of the entrance also survive. The building was bought by the Province of York in 1902 for use by its convocation, and Temple Moore then restored it. Among his alterations were the creation of the Maclagan Memorial Hall in the upper part of the great hall, where the original roof structure can be seen, although much renewed.

Liga side FC Biel-Bienne. A former Monaco youth team player, he spent time on loan at Monts d'Or Azergues in the Championnat de France Amateur and with Portuguese side Varzim in the LigaPro. He also won two caps for the France under-20 team. He was signed by English club Port Vale in July 2016 and stayed with the club for one-and-a-half seasons. He joined Swiss club La Chaux-de-Fonds in June 2018 and then moved on to Biel-Bienne the following year. Playing career Monaco II As a youth team player with Monaco, he played for the reserve team in the Championnat de France Amateur, featuring five times in 2012‚Äì13 as Monaco II finished 12th, 17 times in the 2013‚Äì14 season as they finished in eighth place, and scoring one goal in 16 games in the 2014‚Äì15 campaign to help the club to a ninth-place finish. He also played one game on loan at Monts d'Or Azergues on 19 December 2015, scoring 19 minutes after entering the game as a substitute in a 2‚Äì2 draw with GF38. He then was loaned out to Portuguese side Varzim in the LigaPro. He made his professional debut on 31 January 2016, in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Penafiel at the Est√°dio do Varzim SC. He played a total of 19 games for the club, and scored his first goal in professional football on 8 May, in a 2‚Äì0 win over Oriental. Capucho led Varzim to a ninth-place finish in the league. Port Vale De Freitas signed a two-year contract with EFL League One club Port Vale in July 2016. Manager Bruno Ribeiro compared de Freitas to himself as a player, and said his versatility made him a key player for the \\"Valiants\\". He remained a part of the first team after Michael Brown succeeded Ribeiro as manager in December, before being sidelined for six weeks with a groin injury picked up in February. With the \\"Valiants\\" now in EFL League Two, he made 13 appearances in the first half of the 2017‚Äì18 season, before his contract was ended by mutual consent after meeting with new manager Neil Aspin in January 2018. La Chaux-de-Fonds In June 2018, De Freitas joined Swiss Promotion League side La Chaux-de-Fonds. He left the club at the end of the season.

(1990), Reggae returns to the motherland. The Beat, pp. 9, 14-15, 64 Before he released his solo album, he was in a group called The Jastix along with Amos McRoy and Majek Fashek. Oseloke Augustine Onwubuya, popularly known as Ras Kimono was born in Ekeleke Elumelu, Delta State, Nigeria, He started out his career as a student of Gbenoba Secondary School Agbor and later as a member of the Jastix Reggae Ital, alongside Majek Fashek, Amos McRoy Jegg and Black Rice Osagie. His music was greatly influenced by the poverty, inequality and hardship he witnessed in his early life. He released his solo debut album Under Pressure on the Premier Music label in 1989, which propelled him to instant continental stardom. The album had hits such as \\"Under Pressure\\", \\"Natty Get Jail\\" and the massive hit \\"Rhumba Style\\". He later released a string of hit albums, touring all over Africa, Europe and the United States, promoting his brand of reggae music. He won several awards including the Nigeria Music Awards, Fame Music Awards and many more. In 2010, he was still performing to a loyal fan-base of all ages and his music is still played on radio, throughout West Africa. Kimono served a long apprenticeship on the Nigerian music circuit, experimenting with a number of styles, before making his late 1980s breakthrough as a reggae singer. Together with his Massive Dread Reggae Band. Kimono released his debut album, Under Pressure in 1989, accompanied by the popular single, \\"Rum-Bar Stylee\\", this revealed both a Jamaican and native African influence (the latter particularly evident in his ‚ÄòPatois‚Äô delivery, as frequently employed by Fela Kuti to communicate with the urban underclass). His strongly polemical lyrics produced album sales of over 100,000 copies, and a fervent following for his advocacy of social change. What‚Äôs Gwan proved even more successful, with the topics selected including legalization of marijuana, and the need for Africans to intellectually repel colonialism and its arbitrary boundaries between tribes. Most controversially, he was not averse to naming directly those in power he saw as synonymous with backdoor imperialism. He died at the age of 60 on 10 June 2018 in Lagos, Nigeria.

It originally belonged to the Krabice of Veitmile family that purchased Ko≈°√°tky fortress in 1420, and its actual owner was in all likelihood Bene≈° Krabice of Veitmile (Benesch von Weitm√ºhl), the chronicler and director of the construction of St Vitus Cathedral. From this family, the picture came into the Kolowrat family through marriage. The Kolowrats owned it until 1946.Matƒõjƒçek A, 1950, p. 54 The picture is now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.Dormition of the Virgin, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston  Description and context  The picture is painted in tempera on an oak panel covered with stretched canvas. A preparatory drawing is etched into the chalk base and its contours outlined in black. The work is a highly advanced example of the Gothic style, combining elements of Northern European Gothic and the strong influence of Italian, more specifically Sienese painting. It was painted by an unknown master during the reign of Charles IV and belongs to the broader circle of paintings executed in a similar way, such as the Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod Altarpiece, the Kaufmann Crucifixion and the panels of the Morgan Collection (the Small Morgan Panels). The panel was probably originally the wing of a diptych, the second part of which was the Wroc≈Çaw Holy Trinity.Pe≈°ina J, 1976, p. 14 In the quality of its execution, the picture ranks among the finest known works dating from the 14th century. It is at the same time the most Italian work of the entire Bohemian school.Kutal J, 1972, p. 57 The construction of space reveals that the artist was acquainted with the central Italian painting of Siena (namely that of Simone Martini). Its composition is monumental and complex, while the facial type is derived from the Venetian school (namely Paolo di Venezia). A peculiar aspect of the work is the figure of Christ (holding the soul of Mary), who doesn‚Äôt ascend in a mandorla above the group but stands among the apostles. The mandorla is substituted by small stylised clouds around the figure. The theme of depicting the death of the Virgin Mary itself is Byzantine in origin. In Bohemia, the oldest depiction of this kind (the Ko√≠mƒìsis) is a miniature on parchment inserted into the relic panels of a St George reliquary dating from 1306. Later works then gradually abandon the Byzantine scheme, replacing it with the motif of Last Prayer of the Virgin Mary. This was first recorded in the Czech lands from the 1360s.Pazderov√° J, 2014, pp. 9-10  Notes   References  * Jitka Pazderov√°, Zobrazen√≠ Smrti Panny Marie v umƒõn√≠ ƒçesk√©ho st≈ôedovƒõku, bakal√°≈ôsk√° pr√°ce, FF UP v Olomouci, 2014 * Ji≈ô√≠ Fajt (ed.), Karel IV.

Exponential tilting is also used in Esscher tilting, an indirect Edgeworth approximation technique. The earliest formalization of ECM is often attributed to Esscher with its use in importance sampling being attributed to David Siegmund. ET is known as the Esscher transform in mathematical finance and is used in such contexts as insurance futures pricing.  Overview  Given a random variable X with probability distribution \\\\mathbb{P}, density f, and moment generating function (m.g.f.) M_X(\\\\theta)=\\\\mathbb{E}[e^{\\\\theta X}] < \\\\infty, the exponentially tilted measure \\\\mathbb{P}_\\\\theta is defined as follows: \\\\mathbb{P}_\\\\theta(X \\\\in dx) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbb{E}[e^{\\\\theta X}\\\\mathbb{I}[X \\\\in dx }{M_X(\\\\theta)}=e^{\\\\theta x - \\\\kappa(\\\\theta)}\\\\mathbb{P}(X\\\\in dx), where \\\\kappa(\\\\theta) is the cumulant generating function (c.g.f.) log\\\\mathbb{E}[e^{\\\\theta X}], (\\\\kappa(\\\\cdot) is often denoted \\\\psi(\\\\cdot)). Thus, \\\\mathbb{P}_\\\\theta has density f_\\\\theta(x) = \\\\frac{e^{\\\\theta x}f(x)}{M_X(\\\\theta)} = \\\\exp\\\\\\\\{\\\\theta x - \\\\kappa(\\\\theta)\\\\\\\\}f(x). The set of \\\\theta parameterized distributions is known as the natural exponential family generated by X. The exponential tilting of a random vector X has an analogous definition: \\\\mathbb{P}_{\\\\theta}(X\\\\in dx) = e^{\\\\theta^T x - \\\\kappa(\\\\theta)}\\\\mathbb{P}(X\\\\in dx), where \\\\kappa(\\\\theta) = \\\\log \\\\mathbb{E}[\\\\exp\\\\\\\\{\\\\theta^T X\\\\\\\\}]. This ‚Äúexponentially tilted measure\\" is a probability distribution that in many cases has the same parametric form as that of X, so that variates can easily be generated. However, for some distributions, the exponentially tilted distribution does not belong to the same parametric family as f; an example is the Pareto distribution with f(x) = \\\\alpha /(1 + x) ^\\\\alpha, x > 0, where f_\\\\theta(x) is well defined for \\\\theta < 0 but is not a standard distribution. In such examples, r.v. generation may not always be straightforward.Asmussen, Soren & Glynn, Peter (2007). Stochastic Simulation. Springer. pp. 164‚Äì167. Example One-dimensional examples include the normal distribution, the exponential distribution, the binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution. (i) The N( \\\\mu, \\\\sigma ^2) distribution, where f_\\\\theta(x) is the N( \\\\mu + \\\\theta \\\\sigma ^2, \\\\sigma ^2) density; (ii) the exponential distribution f(x) = \\\\lambda e^{- \\\\lambda x}, where f_\\\\theta(x) = \\\\lambda _\\\\theta e^{- \\\\lambda_\\\\theta x}, where \\\\lambda_\\\\theta = \\\\lambda - \\\\theta , - \\\\infty < \\\\theta < \\\\lambda ; (iii) the binomial (N, \\\\alpha) distribution p(k) = \\\\binom{N}{k} \\\\alpha^ k (1- \\\\alpha) ^ {N-k}, k = 0,...,N, where p_\\\\theta is binomial (N, \\\\alpha_\\\\theta) with\\\\alpha_\\\\theta = \\\\alpha e^\\\\theta / (1 - \\\\alpha +\\\\alpha e^\\\\theta ), \\\\alpha \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}; (iv) the Poisson distribution p(k) = e^{-\\\\mu} \\\\mu^k / k! , where p_\\\\theta is Poisson with \\\\mu_\\\\theta = \\\\mu e^ \\\\theta . (v) A multivariate example is the N(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu, C}) distribution, where the exponentially tilted measure is N(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu + C \\\\theta, C}).Asmussen, Soren & Glynn, Peter (2007). Stochastic Simulation. Springer. pp. 129‚Äì130. Uses Rare- event simulation The exponential tilting of X, assuming it exists, supplies a family of distributions that can be used as proposal distributions for acceptance-rejection sampling or importance distributions for importance sampling. One common application is sampling from a distribution conditional on a sub-region of the domain, i.e. XX\\\\in A. With an appropriate choice of \\\\theta, sampling from \\\\mathbb{P}_\\\\theta can meaningfully reduce the required amount of sampling or the variance of an estimator. =Saddlepoint approximation= The saddlepoint approximation method is a density approximation methodology often used for the distribution of sums and averages of iid random variables that employs edgeworth series expansion, but which generally performs better at extreme values. From the definition of the natural exponential family, it follows that f_{\\\\theta}(\\\\bar{x}) = f(\\\\bar{x})exp\\\\\\\\{n(\\\\theta \\\\bar{x} - \\\\kappa(\\\\theta))\\\\\\\\}. Applying edgeworth expansion, f_{\\\\theta}(\\\\bar{x}) = \\\\psi(z)(Var(\\\\bar{X}))^{-1/2}\\\\\\\\{1 + \\\\frac{\\\\rho_3(\\\\theta)h_3(z)}{6} + \\\\frac{\\\\rho_4(\\\\theta)h_4(z)}{24}\\\\dots\\\\\\\\}, where \\\\psi(z) is the standard normal density of z = \\\\frac{\\\\bar{x} - \\\\kappa_{\\\\bar{x}} ' (\\\\theta)}{\\\\kappa_{\\\\bar{x}} (\\\\theta)}, \\\\rho_n(\\\\theta) = \\\\kappa^{(n)}(\\\\theta)\\\\\\\\{\\\\kappa (\\\\theta)^{n/2}\\\\\\\\}, and h_n are the hermite polynomials defined by h_n(z) = \\\\frac{-1^n\\\\frac{\\\\partial^n\\\\psi(z)}{\\\\partial z^n}}{\\\\psi(z)}. When considering values of \\\\bar{x} progressively farther from the center of the distribution, z\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty and the h_n(z) terms become unbounded. However, for each value of \\\\bar{x}, we can choose \\\\theta s.t. \\\\kappa '(\\\\theta) = \\\\bar{x}, i.e. the saddlepoint, so that the above expansion is always evaluated at the expectation of the tilted distribution. This choice of \\\\theta leads to the final representation of the approximation f(\\\\bar{x}) \\\\approx \\\\frac{n}{2\\\\pi\\\\kappa (\\\\theta)}^{1/2}exp\\\\\\\\{n(\\\\kappa(\\\\theta) - \\\\theta\\\\bar{x})\\\\\\\\} =Rejection sampling= Using the tilted distribution \\\\mathbb{P}_{\\\\theta} as the proposal, the rejection sampling algorithm prescribes sampling from f_\\\\theta(x) and accepting with probability \\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\\\\\{-\\\\theta x + \\\\kappa(\\\\theta)\\\\\\\\}}{c} i.e. if \\\\mbox{Unif}(0,1) \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\exp(-\\\\theta x + \\\\kappa(\\\\theta))}{c}, where c = \\\\sup\\\\limits_{x\\\\in X}\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbb{P}}{d\\\\mathbb{P}_{\\\\theta}}(x). =Importance sampling= Applying the exponentially tilted distribution as the importance distribution yields the equation \\\\mathbb{E}(h(X)) = \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\theta}(L(X)h(X)), where L(X) = \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbb{P}}{d\\\\mathbb{P}_{\\\\theta}} . So, one samples from f_{\\\\theta} to estimate the probability under the importance distribution \\\\mathbb{P}(dX) and then multiply by the likelihood ratio. Moreover, \\\\mbox{Var}(X) = \\\\mathbb{E}[(L(X)h(X)^2]. Example Assume i.i.d. X's s.t. \\\\kappa(\\\\theta) < \\\\infty. In order to estimate \\\\mathbb{P}(X_1+...X_n > c), we can employ importance sampling by taking h(X) = \\\\mathbb{I}(\\\\sum\\\\limits^n_{i = 1}X_i> c). The constant c can be rewritten as na for some other constant a. Then, \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\sum\\\\limits^n_{i = 1}X_i>na) = \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\theta_a}[\\\\exp\\\\\\\\{-\\\\theta_a\\\\sum\\\\limits^n_{i = 1}X_i + n\\\\kappa(\\\\theta_a)\\\\\\\\}\\\\mathbb{I}(\\\\sum\\\\limits^n_{i = 1}X_i>na)], where \\\\theta_a denotes the \\\\theta defined by the saddle-point equation \\\\kappa '(\\\\theta_a) = \\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\theta_a} = a. =Stochastic processes= Given the tilting of a normal R.V., it is intuitive that the exponential tilting of X_t, a Brownian motion with drift \\\\mu and variance \\\\sigma^2, is a Brownian motion with drift \\\\mu + \\\\theta\\\\sigma^2 and variance \\\\sigma^2. Thus, any Brownian motion with drift under \\\\mathbb{P} can be thought of as a Brownian motion without drift under \\\\mathbb{P}_{\\\\theta^*}. To obverse this, consider the process X_t = B_t + \\\\mu_t. f(X_t) = f_{\\\\theta^*}(X_t)\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbb{P}}{d\\\\mathbb{P}_{\\\\theta^*}} = f(B_t)exp\\\\\\\\{\\\\mu B_T + - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mu^2T\\\\\\\\}. The likelihood ratio term, exp\\\\\\\\{\\\\mu B_{T} - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\mu^2 T\\\\\\\\}, is a martingale and commonly denoted M_T. Thus, a Brownian motion with drift process (as well as many other continuous processes adapted to the Brownian filtration) is a \\\\mathbb{P}_{\\\\theta^*}-martingale. SDEs The above leads to the alternate representation of the stochastic differential equation dX(t) = \\\\mu(t)dt + \\\\sigma(t) dB(t): dX_{\\\\theta}(t) = \\\\mu_{\\\\theta}(t) dt + \\\\sigma(t) dB(t), where \\\\mu_{\\\\theta}(t) = \\\\mu(t) + \\\\theta\\\\sigma(t). Girsanov's Formula states the likelihood ratio \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbb{P}}{d\\\\mathbb{P}_{\\\\theta}} = exp\\\\\\\\{-\\\\int\\\\limits_0^T\\\\frac{\\\\mu_{\\\\theta}(t) - \\\\mu(t)}{\\\\sigma^2(t)}dB(t) + \\\\int\\\\limits_0^T(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2(t)}{2})dt\\\\\\\\}. Therefore, Girsanov's Formula can be used to implement importance sampling for certain SDEs. Tilting can also be useful for simulating a process X(t) via rejection sampling of the SDE dX(t) = \\\\mu(X(t))dt+ dB(t). We may focus on the SDE since we know that X(t) can be written \\\\int\\\\limits_0^t dX(t) + X(0). As previously stated, a Brownian motion with drift can be tilted to a Brownian motion without drift. Therefore, we choose \\\\mathbb{P}_{proposal}=\\\\mathbb{P}_{\\\\theta^*}. The likelihood ratio \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbb{P}_{\\\\theta^*}}{d\\\\mathbb{P}}(dX(s): 0 \\\\leq s \\\\leq t) = \\\\prod\\\\limits_{\\\\tau\\\\geq t}exp\\\\\\\\{\\\\mu(X(\\\\tau))dX(\\\\tau) - \\\\frac{\\\\mu(X(\\\\tau))^2}{2}\\\\\\\\}dt = exp\\\\\\\\{\\\\int\\\\limits_0^t\\\\mu(X(\\\\tau))dX(\\\\tau) - \\\\int\\\\limits_0^t\\\\frac{\\\\mu(X(s))^2}{2}\\\\\\\\}dt. This likelihood ratio will be denoted M(t). To ensure this is a true likelihood ratio, it must be shown that \\\\mathbb{E}[M(t)] = 1. Assuming this condition holds, it can be shown that f_{X(t)}(y) = f_{X(t)}^{\\\\theta^*}(y)\\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\theta ^*}[M(t)X(t) = y]. So, rejection sampling prescribes that one samples from a standard Brownian motion and accept with probability \\\\frac{f_{X(t)}(y)}{f_{X(t)}^{\\\\theta ^*}(y)}\\\\frac{1}{c} = \\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\theta ^*}[M(t)X(t) = y]. Choice of tilting parameter Siegmund's algorithm Assume i.i.d. X's with light tailed distribution and \\\\mathbb{E}[X] > 0. In order to estimate \\\\psi(c) = \\\\mathbb{P}(\\\\tau(c) < \\\\infty) where \\\\tau(c) = \\\\inf\\\\\\\\{t:\\\\sum\\\\limits_{i=1}^t X_i> c\\\\\\\\}, when c is large and hence \\\\psi(c) small, the algorithm uses exponential tilting to derive the importance distribution. The algorithm is used in many aspects, such as sequential tests,D. Siegmund (1985) Sequential Analysis. Springer-Verlag G/G/1 queue waiting times, and \\\\psi is used as the probability of ultimate ruin in ruin theory. In this context, it is logical to ensure that \\\\mathbb{P}_\\\\theta(\\\\tau(c) < \\\\infty) = 1. The criterion \\\\theta > \\\\theta_0, where \\\\theta_0 is s.t. \\\\kappa'(\\\\theta_0) = 0 achieves this. Siegmund's algorithm uses \\\\theta = \\\\theta^*, if it exists, where \\\\theta^* is defined in the following way: \\\\kappa(\\\\theta^*) = 0. It has been shown that \\\\theta^* is the only tilting parameter producing bounded relative error (\\\\underset{x \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty}{\\\\lim\\\\sup}\\\\frac{Var\\\\mathbb{I}_{A(x)}}{\\\\mathbb{P}A(x)^2} < \\\\infty). Black-Box algorithms We can only see the input and output of a black box, without knowing its structure. The algorithm is to use only minimal information on its structure. When we generate random numbers, the output may not be within the same common parametric class, such as normal or exponential distributions. An automated way may be used to perform ECM. Let X_1, X_2,...be i.i.d. r.v.‚Äôs with distribution G; for simplicity we assume X\\\\geq 0. Define \\\\mathfrak{F}_n = \\\\sigma(X_1,...,X_n,U_1,..., U_n) , where U_1, U_2, . . . are independent (0, 1) uniforms. A randomized stopping time for X_1, X_2, . . . is then a stopping time w.r.t. the filtration \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathfrak{F}_n\\\\\\\\}, . . . Let further \\\\mathfrak{G} be a class of distributions G on [0, \\\\infty) with k_G = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty e^{\\\\theta x}G(dx) < \\\\infty and define G_\\\\theta by \\\\frac{dG_\\\\theta}{dG(x)} = e^{\\\\theta x - k_G}. We define a black-box algorithm for ECM for the given \\\\theta and the given class \\\\mathfrak{G}of distributions as a pair of a randomized stopping time \\\\tau and an \\\\mathfrak{F}_\\\\tau- measurable r.v. Z such that Z is distributed according to G_\\\\theta for any G \\\\in \\\\mathfrak{G}. Formally, we write this as \\\\mathbb{P}_G (Z for all x . In other words, the rules of the game are that the algorithm may use simulated values from G and additional uniforms to produce an r.v. from G_\\\\theta .Asmussen, Soren & Glynn, Peter (2007). Stochastic Simulation. Springer. pp. 416‚Äì420. Advantages In many cases, the tilted distribution belongs to the same parametric family (when the original density is part of an exponential family) as the original which simplifies R.V. generation. Exponential tilting may still be useful if this is not the case, though normalization must be possible and additional sampling algorithms may be needed. In addition, there exists a simple relationship between the original and tilted c.g.f.s, \\\\kappa_\\\\theta(\\\\eta) = log(\\\\mathbb{E}_\\\\theta[e^{\\\\eta X}]) = \\\\kappa(\\\\theta + \\\\eta) - \\\\kappa(\\\\theta). We can see this by observing that F_\\\\theta(x) = \\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\infty}^xexp\\\\\\\\{\\\\theta y - \\\\kappa(\\\\theta)\\\\\\\\}f(y)dy. Thus, \\\\kappa_{\\\\theta}(\\\\eta) = log \\\\int e^{\\\\eta x}dF_{\\\\theta}(x) = \\\\int e^{\\\\eta x}e^{\\\\theta x - \\\\kappa(\\\\theta)} =log\\\\mathbb{E}[e^{(n+\\\\theta)X-\\\\kappa(\\\\theta)}] = log(e^{\\\\kappa(\\\\eta+\\\\theta)-\\\\kappa(\\\\theta)}) = \\\\kappa(\\\\eta+\\\\theta)-\\\\kappa(\\\\theta). Clearly, this relationship allows for easy calculation of the c.g.f. of the tilted distribution and thus the distributions moments. Moreover, it results in a simple form of the likelihood ratio. Specifically, L = \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbb{P}}{d\\\\mathbb{P}_\\\\theta} = \\\\frac{f(x)}{f_{\\\\theta}(x)} =e^{- \\\\theta x + \\\\kappa(\\\\theta)}.  Common distributions  {  - !

Life and career Hari Won was born in Seoul, South Korea. Her father is from Vietnam and her mother is South Korean. Her father came to South Korea in 70s and met her mother there. Their marriage wasn't accepted by her mother's family as her father was not wealthy as well as being of non-Korean descent. However, they still got married, albeit, with some disapproval by her mother's family. As documented by KBS, she had a relatively unhappy childhood due to her mother's family not accepting the marriage at that time, as well as experiencing some discrimination for being from a bicultural family. Her name means, \\"you will get anything you wish for\\" in Korean. \\"Won\\" in Korean can be transliterated to \\"Nguyen\\" in Vietnamese. She moved to Vietnam in 2007 since her father fell ill, and has been there ever since. In 2010, she started learning Vietnamese at Ho Chi Minh University of Social Science and Humanities. She is currently living and working in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Hari is fluent in Vietnamese, Korean, English and is proficient in Japanese. Career She was one of the contestants on Cuoc Dua Ky Thu 2013 (Amazing Race) alongside her then boyfriend - rapper Dinh Tien Dat where she began to gain more fame and popularity. As a singer, she released her debut single Huong Dem Bay Xa in 2014, and since then, has released more popular song hits such as Anh Cu Di Di, Cuoi Cung Anh Cung Den, Without You, Co Chang Chi La Giac Mo, La Ca Bau Troi, and more. She made her acting debut as the female lead in the 2014 Vietnamese film Chang Trai Nam Ay, which is one of the most popular films of 2014 in Vi·ªát Nam. She starred alongside Son Tung M-TP, H·ª©a V·ªπ VƒÉn, Ng√¥ Ki·∫øn Huy, and Ph·∫°m Qu·ª≥nh Anh. She also become a popular MC in many games shows on TV, such as, Giong Ca Bi An and Nhanh Nhu Chop.

Life and career Crouzet was born in Monts-sur-Guesnes, the son of who served as the Inspector General for History under France's Ministry of National Education. After graduating with his Baccalaur√©at from the Lyc√©e Hoche in 1939, he was admitted to the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure which his father had also attended. He passed his Agr√©gation in history with full marks in 1945 and began teaching at a lyc√©e in Beauvais. Between 1946 and 1949 he was in the UK on fellowships to carry out research in British history that would ultimately form the basis of his doctoral dissertation. Based at the London School of Economics and the Institute of Historical Research and spending much of his time in the Public Record Office, he became a life-long Anglophile. During his London years, he met and married Fran√ßoise Dabert-Hauser, the granddaughter of the French historian Henri Hauser. On his return to France in 1949 he worked as a lecturer at the Paris Institute of Political Studies until 1956 and was also a teaching assistant in contemporary history at the Sorbonne (1949‚Äì1953) and a professor at the Lyc√©e Janson de Sailly (1953‚Äì1956). He received his doctorate in 1956 with his dissertation, L'√©conomie britannique et le blocus continental (1806-1813), a two-volume study on the economic impact of the Napoleonic blockade of Britain. The thesis, which received the unanimous congratulations of the jury, was published two years later and made an immediate impact.Chaloner, W. H. (1960). \\"Crouzet (Fran√ßois).

A member of the Society of the Sacred Heart (RSCJ), Sr. Karuna Mary formerly led 204 colleges managed by the Order. During her tenure at Sophia College, in 1970, the institution started Sophia Polytechnic. In 2008 the Government of India awarded her the fourth highest civilian honour, the Padma Shri for her social contributions.  Biography  Braganza, n√©e Mary, was born in 1924 in Mapuca in the Indian state of Goa, the fifth of what became 10 children in the family, but grew up in Bandra, a suburb of Mumbai. She graduated from St. Xavier's College, Mumbai, and secured her post-graduate degree from the same institution. Her social activities had already begun during her college days when she organized mission camps in Talasari. She joined the Society of the Sacred Heart as a nun in 1950, her ordination taking place in England. Returning to India, she was a teacher at Sophia High School, Bengaluru, and, after working there for a few years, joined Sophia College, Mumbai, in the English department. She rose to become head of that department, vice principal, then principal of the college in 1965, the first Indian to hold the position. During her tenure as the principal of the college, she initiated several educational and social projects. She founded Bhabha Institute of Science, a division of the college for science education up to graduate level and started new departments for sociology, psychology, and biochemistry. In 1970, the college started a vocational education centre under the name Sophia Polytechnic and five years late began a junior college. Another of her major contributions was the establishment of S.P.J. Sadhana School for the Developmentally Challenged, on the college campus, where differently abled children were given vocational training and provided with opportunities for rehabilitation. She is also known to have encouraged students to take up social activities; student involvement with Warli tribals and at Kosbad were two such programmes. After retiring from Sophia College, Braganza moved to Delhi and took up the post of Secretary of the All India Association for Christian Higher Education, holding the responsibility of 204 colleges under its jurisdiction. She served the Association for six years till her move to Torpa, a tribal area in present day Jharkhand state, in 1998, as a teacher of English language at St. Joseph‚Äôs College. Learning the local dialect of Mundari, she worked among the tribal people and founded the Centre for Women‚Äôs Development (CWD) and a women's self-help group in 1990. The movement, later, grew to host 5000 members. Her efforts have been reported behind the establishment of an English medium school, creche, children's play school, and a girls' hostel. She was also instrumental in the documentation of indigenous herbs of the area. During this period, she had to face resistance from some of the dissenting locals who alleged conversion, and she survived an attack by local thugs. In 2000, Braganza went back to Mumbai where she revived the Alumni Association of Sophia College and became involved with their activities as the director of the association for five years. She was also involved in rural programmes of Sisters of Color Ending Sexual Assault (SCESA) such as rainwater harvesting in Mangaon in the Raigad district of Maharashtra. In 2005, when Zainab Tobaccowala Secular High School, a local school, was devastated by the floods, she took up the cause and generated funds for the reconstruction and assisted in the re-establishment of the school by helping to hire competent teachers. Her involvement is also reported in the establishment of Sophia Center for Women's Studies, division for vocational studies, at Sophia College, and in the relocation and rebuilding of St Mary‚Äôs Convent School, Matara, a Tsunami-affected school in Sri Lanka. A periodic writer on developmental education, she has served as the editor of the newsletter published by the Indian Association for Women's Studies (IAWS), where she regularly contributed editorial articles. The Government of India awarded her the civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 2008. Braganza, a life member of the Centre for Women's Development Studies (CWDS), retired in 2006 and lives in Pune. Her life has been documented in a 396-page book, The Charism of Karuna - Life Story of Sister Karuna Mary Braganza, published in 2011.

Early feeding has a positive effect on chick performance because development and maturation of important organs is not retarded post hatch, but continues. This results in better growth performance and a better health status of the chickens.  The benefits of early feeding  Since the early 1990s, a lot of studies showed the benefits of early feeding and water on chick performance. In this paragraph a few studies are summarized to show the benefit of early feeding and water. During the last few days of incubation, the residual yolk is retracted into the body cavity as an extension of the intestine. Post hatch, the residual yolk is the only nutrient source of the chicken until exogenous feed is available. Chickens can use the residual yolk for maintenance during the first few days post hatch.Noy, Y., Z. Uni, and D. Sklan. 1996. Routes of yolk utilization in the newly-hatched chick. Br. Poult. Sci. 37: 987-996. However, research has shown that development and maturation of the gastrointestinal tract,Maiorka, A., E. Santin, F. Dahlke, I. C. Boleli, R. L. Furlan, and M. Macari. 2003. J. Appl. Poult. Res. 12: 483-492.Geyra, A., Z. Uni, and D. Sklan. 2001. The effect of fasting at different ages on growth and tissue dynamics in the small intestine of the young chick. Br. J. Nutr. 86: 53-61. and important immune related organsDibner, J. J., C. D. Knight, M. L. Kitchell, C. A. Atwell, A. C. Downs, and F. J. Ivey. 1998. Early feeding and development of the immune system in neonatal poultry. J. Appl. Poultry Res. 7: 425-436. is delayed in chickens that have to rely solely on their residual yolk and have no feed and water available between hatch and placement at the farm. A study of Noy et al. (1996) showed that the residual yolk of chickens with access to feed during 96 hours after hatch reduced more rapid in size than in fasted birds. This can be caused by increased intestinal activity in fed chickens. A more rapid reduction in residual yolk size indicates that valuable nutrients are earlier used for important developmental steps. Geyra et al. (2001) showed that fasting post hatch retarded body weight increase and intestinal growth. The effects of fasting were specific to both time of fasting and the intestinal segment examined (duodenum, jejunum or ileum). The jejunum appeared to be the most sensitive of the intestinal segments. Fasting between 0 and 48 hours post hatch decreased crypt size, the number of crypts per villus, crypt proliferation, villus area, and the rate of enterocyte (intestinal absorptive cells) migration in the duodenum and jejunum. Geyra et al. (2001) concluded that early access to feed is important for optimal early intestinal development. Maiorka et al. (2003) also showed that the development of the gastrointestinal tract was directly linked to feed and water intake. They showed that relative weight and length of the jejunum and ileum increased when chickens were supplied with feed and water post hatch. In addition, intestinal mucosa development was affected by the availability of feed and water: the number of villi per area decreased because villi size increased. According to these findings Maiorka et al. (2003) hypothesized that the absence of physical stimuli caused by feed in the intestinal lumen and the specific need for certain nutrients, such as water, may be responsible for negative changes in the morphology of the intestinal mucosa. Protein in the residual yolk is the source of antibodies from the chicken.Larsson, A., R. M. Balow, T. L. Lindahl, and P. O. Forsberg. 1993. Chicken antibodies: Taking advantage of evolution ‚Äì A review. Poult. Sci. 72: 1807-1812. To be effective, it is important that maternal antibodies move from the residual yolk into the bloodstream but also to sites of vulnerability such as the mucosal surfaces where bacteria and viruses can enter the body. Dibner et al. (1998) evaluated the effect of early feeding on the development of the immune system in broiler chickens. They showed that providing nutrients immediately post hatch resulted in heavier bursa weight, earlier appearance of biliary IgA and germinal centers (secondary lymphoid organs), and an improved resistance to a disease challenge. In broiler chickens the first week of life is not only important for further development of the gastrointestinal tract and important immune related organs but is also an important period for muscle production.Moss, F. P., R. A. Sommonds, and H. W. McNary. 1964. The growth and composition of skeletal muscle in the chicken. 2. The relationship between muscle weight and the number of nuclei. Poult. Sci. 43: 283-290. Halevy et al. (2000) showed that the length and timing of fasting post hatch affects satellite cell activity. Short-term fasting can enhance satellite cell number. However, long- term fasting almost completely arrests cell mitosis and decreases the number of satellite cells. In the study of Halevy et al., (2000) the chickens that fasted during the first days of life did not regain their body weight or breast muscle weight by day 41, however chickens that fasted between day 4 and 6 post hatch had full growth compensation by day 41. Halevy et al. (2000) concluded that sufficient feed directly post hatch may be critical for later muscle development.Halevy, O. A. Geyra, M. Barak, Z. Uni, and D. Sklan. 2000. Early posthatch starvation decreases satellite cell proliferation and skeletal muscle growth in chicks. J. Nutr. 130: 858-864. A study of Noy and Sklan (1999)Noy, Y., and D. Sklan. 1999. Different types of early feeding and performance in chicks and poults. J. Appl. Poultry Res. 8: 16-24. also showed that early feeding increased body weight and breast size at marketing age in chickens and poults. They showed that early feeding reduced mortality numerically.

Dione Lucas is thought to have helped Hume create her first cookery book as her spelling was known to be poor. Rosemary was approached by Constance Spry with a proposal that they should create a cookbook together. Spry could write the book and Hume would supply the recipes. Constance was to provide personal reminiscences of her time in Ireland. Constance was twenty years older than Hume.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Joe Johnston and Jeff Liu; it premiered on July 13, 2015, on Cartoon Network and was watched by 1.714 million viewers. The episode follows Steven and the Gems attempting to destroy a Gem communication hub when TV broadcasts are disrupted by signals emitted by Peridot from the tower. To demolish the tower, Garnet and Pearl fuse into Sardonyx, leaving Amethyst in dismay. However, as the tower keeps getting fixed, Steven and Amethyst are shocked to see who's really behind the repairs. Plot While Steven (Zach Callison) and Amethyst (Michaela Dietz) are watching the fictional cartoon Crying Breakfast Friends, the broadcast is interrupted by a transmission from Peridot (Shelby Rabara), an agent of the hostile Gem homeworld who is stranded on Earth and attempting to contact her superiors. Garnet (Estelle) deduces that the signal is coming from the Gem Communication Hub, which the Crystal Gems destroyed in the earlier episode \\"Coach Steven\\". The Crystal Gems travel to the Communication Hub and find the antenna has been rebuilt. Previously, Garnet and Amethyst destroyed the antenna by fusing into Sugilite, but Sugilite's destructive personality got out of control, so Garnet rules out fusing with Amethyst this time. Instead, she asks Pearl (Deedee Magno Hall) to fuse with her. Pearl is thrilled by the offer, and she and Garnet form Sardonyx (Alexia Khadime), who destroys the Communication Hub while boasting about her intelligence and grace. After defusing, Garnet and Pearl celebrate with Steven while Amethyst sulks, feeling excluded. The next day, the television broadcast is interrupted again, and the Gems return to the Communication Hub to find it reassembled once more. While Sardonyx disassembles it, Amethyst sings the song \\"Tower of Mistakes\\", blaming herself for Sugilite's recklessness. That night, Steven and Amethyst go to the Communication Hub to catch Peridot in the act of rebuilding it, but are shocked to find Pearl rebuilding it instead. Later, when Garnet and Pearl are about to fuse to break down the antenna a third time, Amethyst and Steven stop them and reveal that they know that it was Pearl who rebuilt it. Pearl confesses that she was just trying to create an excuse for more opportunities to enjoy the emotional thrill of fusing with Garnet. Amethyst comes to Pearl's defense, but Garnet is furious and disgusted by Pearl's betrayal, and demands that Amethyst fuse with her to destroy the Communication Hub. Sometime later, back home, Steven and Amethyst are watching Crying Breakfast Friends. Garnet is not speaking to Pearl. As the characters on Crying Breakfast Friends forgive each other, Amethyst wistfully remarks that \\"it sure would be nice if things worked out the way they do in cartoons.\\" Production Episodes of Steven Universe are written and storyboarded by a single team. \\"Cry for Help\\" was written by Joe Johnston and Jeff Liu, while Ki-Yong Bae and Jin-Hee Park provided animation direction, and Jasmin Lai served as art director. Sugilite's tower-smashing punch was inspired by the \\"Twister-Sock Punch\\" from Popeye and Donkey Kong's \\"Giant Punch\\" from Super Smash Bros. Pearl and Garnet's fusion dance was inspired by the choreography of K-pop artist Sunmi, with storyboards timed to the track \\"Full Moon\\". Music The episode features the song \\"Tower of Mistakes\\", written by Jeff Liu and featuring vocals by Michaela Dietz as Amethyst. Broadcast and reception \\"Cry for Help\\" premiered on Cartoon Network on July 13, 2015. Its initial American broadcast was viewed by approximately 1.714 million viewers. It received a Nielsen household rating of 0.4, meaning that it was seen by 0.4% of all households. The episode was the first in a \\"StevenBomb\\", a programming schedule in which one new episode of Steven Universe airs daily during the regular work week; the following four episodes dealt with the aftermath of the events of this episode, its impact on the characters, and Pearl and Garnet's eventual reconciliation. The episode received positive attention from critics, particularly for the emotional maturity of the story. Also highlighted was the introduction of Sardonyx and Amethyst's character development. Eric Thurm of The A.V. Club said that the confrontation between Garnet and Pearl was \\"maybe the single most complex moment of the show to date\\", calling it \\"rich, complicated, heartbreaking, and simply human\\". Vrai Kaiser of The Mary Sue opined that \\"that Steven Universe has reached that level of writing complexity in a relatively short time span is nothing short of astounding\\".

It also brought severe weather to parts of the South on February 2. As the system tracked northeast into Canada, it brought rain to most of the Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and New England, which had already been hit by a previous historic storm about a week prior to this. After the storm complex had moved into Canada, the cold front associated with it stalled over the East Coast late on February 4. A new low pressure developed off North Carolina that night and started to track up the coast.

The orthodox views about gender relations, poor institutional support to victims and lack of self confidence amongst women are some of the key reasons as to why eve-teasing continues to haunt women in public as well as private spaces. Eve teasing, when left unchecked, emboldens criminality in the society and leads to creating greater sense of impunity amongst perpetrators. Many a times, such mind set translates into crimes against women in worse form such as street crimes, domestic violence and other forms of gender based violence. There is also awareness of the fact that women hesitate to approach, pre-dominantly male police force, especially about sensitive matter such as eve teasing. Girls also don‚Äôt come forward to report such matters as they are reluctant to make their identity public and face either social or familial condemnation or due to fear of retribution. The UP Police established a 24@7 Contact Center in Lucknow, called the WPL 1090 with the aim to provide opportunity to girls in UP to freely register complaints of eve- teasing and set up an innovative ICT based application to process and redress their complaints. The complaints could broadly be classified into following four categories: (a) Eve-teasing through phone. (b) Eve-teasing through social media, like facebook, etc (c) Stalking. (d) Hotspots of eve-teasing closer to places where girls normally go to such as market places, colleges etc. The Contact Centre is located in the heart of Lucknow and is manned by women as well as men police force.

It was released on January 29, 2016. It is their first album in almost four years, and the first to feature an all new lineup outside of frontman and band co-founder Crispin Earl. Background The band, initially formed in 2004 under the name \\"Veer\\", consisted of frontman and lead vocalist Crispin Earl, guitarists Eric Schraeder and James Fiddler, bassist Marc Roots, and drummer Neil Beaton. They released their first album, Time to Break the Spell, in 2006, and upon touring in support of it, attracted major record label support. Upon signing to Universal Motown Records, the band changed their name to a more identifiable \\"The Veer Union\\", and released Against the Grain, but were dropped from their label after touring in support of the album. The band pushed forward on another album, Divide the Blackened Sky, but lost Fiddler, Roots, and Beaton shortly after recording. After touring in support of the album, Shraeder would leave as well, leaving Earl as the band's sole member. Without a band, and in financial trouble due to their record label, Rocket Science, collapsing, Earl recorded a last ditch effort, an EP titled Life Support Vol. 1, with only himself and new guitarist Ryan Ramsdell. The band was able to survive, and over the new few years, Earl was able to reassemble the band with new members Dan Sittler, Amal Wijayanayake, Tyler Reimer, and sign to new record label Pavement Entertainment. by March 2014. Writing and recording Despite the tumultuous events prior to making the album, Earl stated that once work on the album began, it was actually the smoothest it had ever been for the band, something he attributed to the fact that it was the first time he had both a band lineup and a record label lined up prior to starting on the album. Earl titled the album Decade due it being a decade since the band's first album, Time to Break the Spell, was released. The album's concept was also tied to the title; the album consists of five completely new songs, and five songs written over a decade ago, prior to the band's first album. Earl explained: > \\"The album title is a celebration of our first album which was released 10 > years ago in 2006. We wanted to convey that we have been around for 10 years > and while there have been a change in members and it has been a tough > business, we have grown musically and as a band. So many bands have been > struggling, myself included through many challenges within the industry that > have made it difficult to want to stay in, I spent a lot of time in a > depressed state just trying to survive so I wanted to put that into my > songwriting and five of the songs on the record are songs I have written > over the past year and the other five are songs I have written back in 2001 > so it spans the times and bringing them all together to bring one focus > sound even though they were written 10 years apart.\\" The five older tracks were songs that Earl had written prior to having any of the original members in the band, when Earl was simply wanting to start his own band. The tracks had been originally shelved in favor of tracks written once the band's original lineup had formed. The tracks \\"Make Believe\\" and \\"Watch You Lose\\" were originally written by Earl for Tommy Lee's solo album Tommyland: The Ride, a project he had done to finance starting up The Veer Union. The track \\"The Unwanted\\" is a reworked version of the song \\"Stay Away\\", originally released on their Demos and Bsides EP released in 2012. Themes and composition The song \\"Defying Gravity\\" is about Earl's battle with depression. The album was described as having hard rock elements similar to that of Breaking Benjamin, Sevendust or Skillet. Release and promotion The album's first single, \\"Defying Gravity\\", was released on December 11, 2015, being promoted by Revolver. A music video, directed by Aaron Veale, largely featuring the band performing in black and white with various visual effects, was released two days later. In mid-February, the band announced they'd tour in support of the album through March, along with supporting acts Bobaflex, Artifas, and Bridge to Grace. Reception Pure Grain Audio generally praised the album overall, naming the \\"cleverly-written call and response wordplay of the second track, 'Watch You Lose'...the menacing 'You Can't Have It All'\\" and the album closing \\"The Underrated\\" as standout tracks, while complaining that some tracks, such as \\"'I Said' recalls Evanescence, but drags on a bit.\\" Track listing Personnel *Crispin Earl ‚Äì lead vocals *Dan Sittler ‚Äì lead guitar, backing vocals *Ryan Ramsdell ‚Äì rhythm guitar *Amal Wijayanayake ‚Äì bass, screamed vocals *Tyler Reimer ‚Äì drums  References  Category:2016 albums Category:The Veer Union albums ","title":"Decade (The Veer Union album)"},{"id":"49288533","text":"Li Qiangfen () was a Chinese diplomat.

All were built between 1875 and 1900, a period of growth in the town, by Thomas Carrigan, a machinist, and are a good example of the town's development at that time. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history Carrigan Lane is a narrow gravel lane between Safford and Division Streets, northeast of central downtown Bennington. The historic district includes the two houses that flank Carrigan Lane but face Safford Street (numbers 316 and 318), and two multiunit residences behind them (numbers 1-3 and 4-10 Carrigan Lane). All are 2-1/2 story wood frame structures, basically vernacular in plan, with modest Italianate decoration, mainly on their porches. The two Safford Street houses are nearly identical in plan and appearance. The town of Bennington experienced significant growth in its industries (mainly textile-related) in the second half of the 19th century. This growth resulted in increased demand for housing for its workers. Safford Street was laid out about 1850, extending away from Main Street, where the Safford Mills were located. Thomas Carrigan, an immigrant machinist from Ireland, moved to Bennington sometime before 1870, and was by 1880 listed as owner of the two Safford Street houses, which were built about 1875. Around 1890, when Bennington's knit goods industry began to expand, Carrigan subdivided his property, which apparently extended all the way to Division Street, and two houses were built facing Division Street, and the two multiunit buildings facing Carrigan Lane were built. The two Safford Street houses have also since been converted into multiunit housing.

Wroc≈Çaw Holy Trinity, National Museum in Wroc≈Çaw  History of the painting  The picture was discovered in 1898 in the loft of the Church of SS John the Baptist and Catherine of Alexandria in ≈öwierzawa, Lower Silesia, and given to the diocesan museum in Wroc≈Çaw. In 1904 it was restored in Berlin. After 1945 it was in the state art collection at the Wawel in Krakow, then in 1964 it was transferred to the then Wroc≈Çaw Silesian Regional Museum. It is now in the collection of the National Museum in Wroc≈Çaw.  Description and context  The picture is painted in tempera on an oak panel covered with stretched canvas. A drawing is etched into the chalk base and its contours outlined in black. The picture is characterised by a symmetrical composition, simplified perspective-based projection and precise drawing.A. Matƒõjƒçek, 1950, p. 54 The panel in all likelihood formed part of a diptych along with the Death of the Virgin Mary of Ko≈°√°tky by the same artist.Pe≈°ina J, 1976, s. 14 It belongs to the circle of the workshop of the Master of the Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod Altarpiece.Kutal J, 1972, s. 57 Its Bohemian origin is demonstrated by a number of features in the drawing details that correspond with other works. These include the similarity of the throne, ornaments and cushion with the Madonna of K≈Çodzko and the similarity of the composition, figural types, modelling and painting technique with the Death of the Virgin Mary of Ko≈°√°tky.A.

It currently has over 2000 active members, many of them alumni, making it one of the largest student societies in Cambridge. The society hosts regular talks at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences, including in the past by many well-known speakers in the field of mathematics. It publishes two magazines, Eureka and QARCH. One of several aims of the society, as laid down in its constitution, is to encourage co-operation between the existing mathematical societies of individual Cambridge colleges, which at present are just the Adam's society of St John's College and the Trinity Mathematical Society, but in the past have included many more. The society is mentioned in G. H. Hardy's essay A Mathematician's Apology. Past presidents of The Archimedeans include Michael Atiyah and Richard Taylor.  Activity  The main focus of the society's activities are the regular talks, which generally concern topics from mathematics or theoretical physics, and are accessible to students on an undergraduate level. Among the list of recent speakers are Fields medalists Michael Atiyah, Wendelin Werner and Alain Connes, as well as authors Ian Stewart and Simon Singh. Many of the speakers are international, and are hosted by The Archimedeans during their visit. After exams and University-wide project deadlines, the society is also known to organise social events.  Publications  Eureka is a mathematical journal that is published annually by The Archimedeans. It includes articles on a variety of topics in mathematics, written by students and academics from all over the world, as well as a short summary of the activities of the society, problem sets, puzzles, artwork and book reviews. The magazine has been published 60 times since 1939, and authors include many famous mathematicians and scientists such as Paul Erd≈ës, Martin Gardner, Douglas Hofstadter, Godfrey Hardy, B√©la Bollob√°s, John Conway, Stephen Hawking, Roger Penrose, Ian Stewart, Fields Medallist Timothy Gowers and Nobel laureate Paul Dirac. The journal is distributed free of charge to all current members of the Archimedeans. In addition, there are many subscriptions by other students, alumni and libraries. Subscriptions to Eureka are the society's main source of income. The Archimedeans also publish QARCH, a magazine containing problem sets and solutions or partial solutions submitted by readers. It is published on an irregular basis and distributed free of charge.

The area that now makes up the park was bought by the people of Pontypridd in 1919 after workers raised the money to have the park established. It was originally designed for those who lived in the surrounding area to have somewhere to relax from their work lives. Due to the fact that the River Rhondda meets the River Taff at one corner of the park it is prone to flooding, one flood in 1929 left the park severely flooded and led to the original layout of the park being changed to what it is today with the memorials being placed way from the River Taff. The memorials in the park include the War Memorial and the Evan and James James statues, as well as some smaller ones. There is also a lido that was reopened on 31 August 2015 after it received funding, after being closed for two decades. War Memorial In 1923 Field Marshal Viscount Allenby renamed the park the Ynysangharad War Memorial park in memory of the soldiers who died in the line of duty in the First World War. In November 2011 a war memorial was reopened in the park to remember the soldiers who died from the Pontypridd area in the First World War and Second World War, as well as subsequent smaller wars like the Suez Crisis and the Falklands War. There was already a small memorial in the park to remember the soldiers who died, but it was decided that a roll of honour should also be erected so that the names of the dead could be honoured since it was felt that the names should not be forgotten. The memorial consists of two parallel walls with the names of the dead inscribed onto black granite plaques that ran along each wall. thumbnailThere are a total of 1,319 names on the memorial, which includes the names of 821 people who died in First World War, the 491 who died in the Second World War. The memorial also includes the names of each of the servicemen who died in the line of duty in Palestine, Korea and Suez Canal (Egypt) wars and the four Welsh Guards during the Falklands War. The memorial cost an estimated ¬£80,000 to build and completed thanks to fundraising appeals by local residents of Pontypridd. Evan James and James James memorial thumbnail In the park there is memorial to Evan James and his son James James who wrote Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau, the Welsh National Anthem. Evan James and his son James were weavers who lived in Pontypridd when they composed the National Anthem in 1856, James wrote the words while Evan composed the music. Although originally called Glan Rhondda (Banks of the Rhondda) it was quickly renamed Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau (Land of My Fathers) when it gained huge popularity after being performed at the 1858 Llangollen National Eisteddfod. Unlike many anthems it was not written to represent a particular occasion in history, but by 1905 was largely accepted as the National Anthem by the Welsh population simply because of how popular it had become. This means that even though Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau is accepted as the Welsh National Anthem, it is neither officially or legally recognised as it in British Law, since legally the National Anthem of Wales is God Bless the Prince of Wales. Following James James' death in 1902 many local residents felt that a memorial should be erected to both Evan and James James to remember the authors of the National Anthem and started a campaign to have one built. However the Senghenydd mining disaster in 1913 and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 stopped the campaign. Then in 1929 Rhys Morgan put an advert in the Western Mail appealing for money to have a memorial built, stating that he expected a \\"prompt response\\" from every \\"Welsh man or woman\\", the money was quickly raised. The memorial that you see in the park today was designed by Sir William Goscombe John and unveiled by Lord Treowen on 23 July 1930 before a crowd of 10,000 people. The monument consists of two life size bronze figures, one woman who represents poetry and a male harpist who represents music. There is an inscription under the memorial that reads: :In memory of Evan James and James James, father and son of Pontypridd, who inspired by a deep and tender love of their native land united poetry to song and gave Wales her National Anthem, Hen Wlad fy Nhdau. Pontypridd Outdoor Lido  The lido was opened in 1927 and was reputed to be the largest open‚Äìair swimming pool in Wales and at its most popular the lido could have up to 1,000 visitors a day. The lido was built with a distinctive Mediterranean influence, like many other lidos around Britain, and features outdoor changing rooms that ran parallel to the edge of the lido. After years of not being maintained the lido was officially closed in 1991 after it was badly damaged by a fire. Over the preceding two decades it fell into disrepair and was left abandoned because of the fact it is a Grade II Listed Building and could not be demolished. It was not until 2013 when a major overhaul following a ¬£6.3m investment from the Welsh Government, using the European Regional Development Fund and Heritage Lottery Funding, that plans for the lido to be reopened and refurbished were started. Due to the fact it is a Grade II Listed Building many of the original features, like the turnstile and the outdoor wooden changing rooms, were kept. However new features were added like a caf√©, visitors centre and observation deck, also heated changing facilities with internal and external showers for those who use the lido. The old lido only had one large pool whereas the new one now includes a main pool alongside an activities pool and a splash pool for small children. The lido was officially reopened on 31 August 2015. thumbnail Bibliography Books *Powell, Dean, ‚ÄòImages of Wales: Pontypridd Revisited ‚Äô, (Stroud: Tempus Publishing, 2007) *Eckley, Simon, ‚ÄòPontypridd: The Archive Photographs Series‚Äô, (Stroud: Chalford Publishing Company, 1994) Websites *Aberdare online, http://www.aberdareonline.co.uk/news/rhondda-valley/pontypridd-lido-restoring- history [Accessed on: 3 December 2015] *BBC Wales Music, National Anthem, http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/anthem/pages/anthem-background.shtml [Accessed on: 6 December 2015] *BBC Wales news, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- wales-south-east-wales-15578096 [Accessed on: 3 November 2015] *Rhondda Cynon Taff Library Service, http://webapps.rhondda-cynon- taf.gov.uk/heritagetrail/english/taf/anthem.html [Accessed on: 1 December 2015] *Wales.com, http://www.wales.com/about-wales/facts-about-wales/welsh- national-anthem [Accessed on: 21 November 2015] *Wales Online, http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/pontypridd-lido-look-incredible- old-7343863 [Accessed on: 9 December 2015] References Category:Parks in Rhondda Cynon Taf Category:Pontypridd Category:1919 establishments in Wales ","title":"Ynysangharad War Memorial"},{"id":"49288735","text":"Section 839(a) of title 10 United States Code ¬ß 925 - Article 125. is a punitive article of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. History On June 4, 1920, the United States Congress approved a modified Articles of War. Article 93 was changed to make the act of sodomy a crime in itself, separate from the offense of assault with intent to commit sodomy. The law went into effect on February 4, 1921. From February 4, 1921 to December 26, 2013, sodomy was prohibited in the United States military. Those found guilty of violating it were punished as a court-martial may direct.Key Dates in US Policy on Gay Men and Women in the United States MilitaryThe Articles of War On May 5, 1950, the UCMJ was passed by Congress and was signed into law by President Harry S. Truman, and became effective on May 31, 1951. Article 125 forbids sodomy among all military personnel, defining it as \\"any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offence.\\" In the aftermath of the 2003 United States Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces ruled that the decision applied to Article 125, severely narrowing the previous ban on sodomy. In both United States v. Stirewalt and United States v. Marcum, the court ruled that the \\"conduct [consensual sodomy] falls within the liberty interest identified by the Supreme Court,\\"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: U.S. v. Stirewalt, September 29, 2004, accessed August 16, 2010 but went on to say that despite the application of Lawrence to the military, Article 125 can still be upheld in cases where there are \\"factors unique to the military environment\\" that would place the conduct \\"outside any protected liberty interest recognized in Lawrence.\\"U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces: U.S. v. Marcum, August 23, 2004, accessed August 16, 2010 Examples of such factors include rape, fraternization, public sexual behavior, or any other factors that would adversely affect good order and discipline. Convictions for consensual sodomy have been overturned in military courts under Lawrence in both United States v. Meno and United States v. Bullock. On December 26, 2013, President Barack Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 into law, replacing the sodomy prohibition provision with forcible sodomy and bestiality prohibition provision.

The research enabled by IODP samples and data improves scientific understanding of changing climate and ocean conditions, the origins of ancient life, risks posed by geohazards, and the structure and processes of Earth's tectonic plates and uppermost mantle. IODP began in 2013 and builds on the research of four previous scientific ocean drilling programs: Project Mohole, Deep Sea Drilling Project, Ocean Drilling Program, and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program. Together, these programs represent the longest running and most successful international Earth science collaboration.  Scientific scope  The scientific scope of IODP is laid out in the program's science plan, Illuminating Earth's Past, Present, and Future. The science plan covers a 10-year period of operations and consists of a list of scientific challenges that are organized into four themes called Climate and Ocean Change, Biosphere Frontiers, Earth Connections, and Earth in Motion. The science plan was developed by the international scientific community to identify the highest priority science for the program.  IODP funding and operations  JOIDES Resolution docked in Panama, October 2012 IODP uses multiple drilling platforms (JOIDES Resolution, Chikyu, and mission-specific platforms) to access different subseafloor environments during research expeditions. These facilities are funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (ECORD), alongside the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (MOST), Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM), Australian-New Zealand IODP Consortium (ANZIC), India Ministry of Earth Science (MoES), and Brazil's Coordination for Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES). Together, these entities represent a coalition of over two dozen countries. The IODP funding model differs from the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program in that NSF, MEXT, and ECORD each manage their own drilling platform. International partners directly contribute to the operating costs of the drilling platforms in exchange for scientific participation on the expeditions and seats on the advisory panels. IODP expeditions are based on research proposals submitted by scientists that address the objectives described in the program's science plan. Advisory panels of international experts then rigorously evaluate the proposal for science quality, feasibility, safety, and any environmental issues. Proposals that are determined to be of high quality are forwarded to the appropriate facility board (JOIDES Resolution Facility Board, Chikyu IODP Board, and ECORD Facility Board) for scheduling. IODP publishes a detailed account of findings and makes all samples and cores freely available. IODP's open data policy assures global access to the information collected by the program, and it allows scientists to use data from multiple expeditions to investigate new hypotheses. Cores collected during expeditions are stored at the IODP core repositories in Bremen, Germany (IODP Bremen Core Repository), College Station, Texas (IODP Gulf Coast Repository), and Kochi, Japan (Kochi Core Center). Scientists may visit any one of the facilities for onsite research or request a loan for teaching purposes/analysis. Archived cores include not only IODP samples, but also those retrieved by the Deep Sea Drilling Project, Ocean Drilling Program, and Integrated Ocean Drilling Program.  Outcomes  IODP expeditions have investigated a wide range of Earth science topics, including past climate and ocean conditions, monsoon systems, seismogenic zones, the formation of continental crust and ocean basins, major extinction events, the role of serpentinization in driving hydrothermal systems, and the temperature limits of life in the deep biosphere. An early outcome of the program harkens back to the original motivation for scientific ocean drilling with Project Mohole ‚Äì drilling and sampling across the Mohoroviƒçiƒá discontinuity (Moho) and into the upper part of Earth's mantle. Expedition 360 was the initial part a multiphase project whose goal, among others, is to directly sample the mantle for the first time. The expedition took place near the Southwest Indian Ridge at a location where the crust is particularly thin due to the formation of an oceanic core complex. Expedition 360 completed 790 meters of drilling and IODP plans to return to the site in the coming years to continue the research. Expedition 364 sampled the peak ring of the Chicxulub impact crater, which is buried offshore near the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Chicxulub is the only well- preserved crater on Earth with a peak ring and was formed when an asteroid slammed into the planet 66 million years ago, killing off dinosaurs and most life on the planet. Analysis of the collected samples and data shows that the asteroid's impact caused rocks from deep in the Earth to shoot up and form the large mountains of the peak ring in a matter of minutes. The sediments overlying the peak ring also provide a record of how life returned to the area after the mass extinction event. In addition to studying how the Earth moves in response to impact events, IODP also studies the processes that cause earthquakes. For example, Expedition 362 brought new insight to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami through the sampling and analysis of sediments and rocks from the oceanic plate that feeds the Sumatra subduction zone. The science team discovered that the sediment's minerals dehydrated before reaching the subduction zone, resulting in a strong fault that allowed for a larger than previously expected earthquake to occur. IODP's early climate studies focused on efforts to understand the Asian monsoon system. Expeditions 353, 354, 355, and 359 collected sediments from the Bay of Bengal, the Andaman Sea, and the Arabian Sea. These sediments were eroded from the land and primarily carried by rivers to the ocean, where some of the sediments have laid buried for millions of years. By analyzing the chemical and physical properties of the sediments, scientists are learning about the evolution of mountain growth, monsoonal precipitation, weathering and erosion, and climate across the region and across multiple time scales. For example, one such study discovered that the monsoonal winds that drive the region's climate began suddenly 12.9 million years ago. Scientific studies from subseafloor instruments and IODP's core archives, which contain samples from this and previous ocean drilling programs, are also yielding insights into the Earth's climate and tectonic history. A study examining samples collected from around the world concluded that the rate of carbon release today is 10 times greater than during the Paleocene Eocene Thermal Maximum or anytime during the past 66 million years. And, measurements taken in the Nankai Trough near Japan show that slow slip earthquakes are releasing about 50% of the subduction zone's energy, which has implications for understanding tsunami hazards.
