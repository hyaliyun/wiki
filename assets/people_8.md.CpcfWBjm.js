It began operation in June 2002. As of 2008, it called itself \\"Q\\" and called its services \\"MyQ.\\" The company provided GSM phone service, supported by LMDS and backbone networks, and called itself the only complete and integrated telecom provider in Greece. In May 2007, it merged with WIND Hellas, which was known at the time as TIM Hellas. ==Company profile== Q-Telecom (former Mobile Network Code: 202-09) was initially a division of Info-Quest. It billed itself as the first private Greek operator to provide combined mobile and fixed telephony as well as Internet service. Focusing on large urban centers, it developed a second-generation mobile telephony network and a broadband fixed wireless access network, point-to-multipoint, operating in the 3.5 GHz band. It also developed a national leased line and privately owned transmission network. Q-Telecom was directly connected to the Hellenic Telecommunication Organization (OTE) and the three other mobile operators. It advertised high- quality voice services, a high call switching transfer rate, and pan-Hellenic coverage via national roaming with Vodafone Greece. It combined mobile telephony services with the prefix 699 (prepaid and postpaid), SMS, and fixed telephony via the carrier selection code 1765. The company billed itself as providing customized services, per second billing, no set-up fees, mobile number selection, preferential rates with Q-Family, the lowest tariff rate for SMS, and added value services. ==Acquisitions and eventual merger into WIND Hellas== Troy Communications announced its plan to acquire Q-Telecom in 2005 for a cash consideration of ‚Ç¨325 million and the assumption of existing indebtedness of ‚Ç¨25 million. Troy Communications already owned the third largest Greek mobile phone provider WIND Hellas, which was known as TIM Hellas until 5 June 2007. When the acquisition was complete in October 2006, Q-Telecom subscribers were able to use WIND GR's (at that time TIM GR) network for national roaming. Wind Greece did not renew the roaming agreement with Vodafone GR for Q-Telecom subscribers, thus since its expiration Q-Telecom subscribers are only able to do national roaming on Wind GR. WIND Hellas and Q-Telecom were later acquired by Weather Investments. Postpaid customers were offered new WIND Hellas SIM cards, retaining their old numbers. Existing Q-card customers continued to use their Q-Telecom SIM cards, although technically they were \\"roaming\\" on the WIND Hellas network. New Q subscribers were given SIM cards that appeared to be Q-cards, although WIND Hellas (MNC: 202 10) was their home carrier. The radio network of Q-Telecom (MNC: 202 09) was disbanded in May 2007. Q-Telecom's bands are currently used by WIND Hellas on its radio network (MNC: 202 10). Q-Telecom employees became WIND Hellas employees. The only part of Q-Telecom that remains in operation is its former marketing division, which is dedicated to the promotion of the Q-card brand name. ==Remaining Q-Telecom branded servicesQ-card=== Q-card remains as a prepaid wireless product. ===Ya! telephone card=== The Ya! prepaid telephone scratch card allows calls to be made from residential or public phones. It is used mainly by students and young people, and for international calls by tourists and people from other countries living in Greece. Ya means two things in Greek: ŒìŒµŒπŒ± means \\"hello\\" and Œ≥ŒπŒ± means \\"for\\", so the card's slogans are \\"Say Hello\\", \\"For everyone\\", \\"For (calls to) all over Greece and the world\\". ==TV and radio campaigns== Q-Telecom was known in Greece for its publicity campaign on both TV and radio. The ads contained small cartoon characters (the \\"Q-ies\\" or \\"Q-Œ¥Œ¨Œ∫ŒπŒ±\\" in Greek) that resembled the company's logo. They used slang to promote the company's offers and slogans, such as \\"no fixed fees\\". ==See also== * Communications in Greece * http://www.chadbourne.com/files/upload/Hellas_Adversary_Complaint.pdf ==ReferencesRelated links== Q-Telecom \\"My Q\\" Official Website (Greek) Category:Mobile phone companies of Greece ","title":"Q-Telecom"},{"id":"2225804","text":"Robert Randolph and the Family Band is an American funk rock band led by pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph (Robert Jermaine Randolph, born August 8, 1977, Irvington, New Jersey). NPR has described the band as one with an \\"irresistible rock 'n' roll swagger\\". Rolling Stone included Randolph upon their list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. The band has released six studio albums and has been Grammy nominated four times. ==Band history== Frontman Robert Randolph was trained as a pedal steel guitarist in the House of God Church and makes prominent use of the instrument in the band's music. The instrument is referred to in many African-American Pentecostal churches as \\"sacred steel\\". Randolph was discovered while playing at a sacred steel convention in Florida. The group's sound is inspired by legendary funk bands such as Earth, Wind & Fire and Sly & the Family Stone. Randolph himself has explained that in his adolescent years before being discovered by the secular community, he was almost completely unaware of non-religious music. He went on exclaim in an interview that ‚ÄúI grew up and saw a lot of older guys playing lap steels and pedal-steel guitars in my church. I had never heard of the Allman Brothers, or even Buddy Guy or Muddy Waters.‚Äù Before releasing albums with The Family Band, Randolph was selected by avant-garde jazz organist John Medeski to join him and the North Mississippi Allstars on their 2001 jam project, The Word. Just prior to the release of The Word's debut album, Randolph was brought to the attention of music fans through a review by Neil Strauss in the New York Times in April 2001. On their first non-church tour of the East Coast, Randolph's new Family Band opened for the North Mississippi Allstars and then rejoined the musicians after their set, with Medeski, as The Word. The first Robert Randolph and the Family Band album, Live at the Wetlands, was released in 2002 on Family Band Records, recorded live on August 23, 2001, just prior to the club's closing. The band released their studio debut, Unclassified on August 5, 2003. They attracted the attention of Eric Clapton, and have subsequently toured as a supporting act with the English blues guitarist. Clapton later guested on their 2006 album Colorblind, playing on a cover of \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\". In 2002, they were hired by ABC to make the network's new NBA theme song. The song, \\"We Got Hoops\\", only appeared in three telecasts, though it was used throughout both the NBA and WNBA seasons during promotions for both leagues. In September 2003 Randolph was listed as No. 97 on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time list. Robert entered the list following Leigh Stephens and directly preceding Angus Young. In February 2004 Robert Randolph and the Family Band along with the band O.A.R. released a cover version of Led Zeppelin's \\"Fool in the Rain\\", which was made available for online purchase through iTunes. This version was played live with O.A.R. at their June 18, 2009 show at Charter One Pavilion in Chicago. Their third album, Colorblind, was released October 10, 2006. The song \\"Ain't Nothing Wrong With That\\" was used in several commercials for NBC, and used in Katherine Jenkins and Mark Ballas' jive on Dancing with the Stars. In June 2008 the Discovery Channel used this same song in a popular promo entitled \\"It's All Good\\" for their summer lineup. The song \\"Thrill of It\\" was used throughout the 2007 college football season by ABC during their College Primetime games. They worked with producer T-Bone Burnett on their fourth studio album We Walk This Road, released in 2010. They released the supposed first single from that album entitled \\"Get There\\" but this song did not appear on the album. The first official single from the album is \\"If I Had My Way.\\" Their 2019 recording, Brighter Days, was chosen as a 'Favorite Blues Album' by AllMusic. ==Live appearances== Robert Randolph in Toronto Randolph's concerts are known for their lively stage performances, with Randolph content to let the rest of the band play on while he dances. Dance is an integral part of the concerts. During \\"Shake Your Hips\\", women are encouraged to dance onstage. For the song \\"The March\\", Randolph leaves his instrument to instruct the crowd on how to properly perform the intricate dance move. Other noteworthy concert regulars involve the entire band trading instruments allowing each member to show off their musical proficiency. When he becomes completely enthralled by his music, Randolph will kick the chair away from his pedal steel guitar and dance while he plays. A microphone is occasionally passed around the front row of the audience, so they can sing during the song \\"I Need More Love\\". Audience members are also called up on stage to sing (\\"Purple Haze\\") or be a guest guitarist for one song. The band made its first television appearance on Late Show with David Letterman on August 5, 2003, performing \\"I Need More Love\\". In 2004 Robert Randolph and the Family Band was the opening act on the Eric Clapton tour. They are featured prominently in the Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival DVD (2004). The band also appears on Bonnaroo Music Festival DVDs. The length of the concerts can vary greatly depending on what songs are played (the band does not use a set list) and how long jams last. Concerts go over the allotted time if the band and the audience are having fun. Most concerts don't have an intermission; instead, band members will exit the stage leaving one or two members a chance to shine with solos. The one time the band does stop is so the band can relax, get hydrated, and plan the encore. On October 9, 2004 Robert Randolph and the Family Band appeared on the PBS television show Austin City Limits. Robert Randolph, Doyle Bramhall II, and Eric Clapton performing \\"Got My Mojo Working\\" at Cuyahoga Falls, May 31, 2008 On January 24, 2007, they played in Dallas at Victory Plaza outside of the American Airlines Center as part of the 2007 NHL All Star game festivities.

He reviewed more than one thousand films during his tenure there. ==Early life== Canby was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Katharine Anne (n√©e Vincent) and Lloyd Canby. He attended boarding school in Christchurch, Virginia, with novelist William Styron, and the two became friends. He introduced Styron to the works of E. B. White and Ernest Hemingway; and the pair hitchhiked to Richmond to buy For Whom the Bell Tolls. After war service in the Pacific theater, he attended Dartmouth College, but did not graduate. ==Career== He obtained his first job as a journalist in 1948 for the Chicago Journal of Commerce. In 1951, he left Chicago for New York and was employed as a film critic by Variety for six years before beginning to work for The New York Times. Canby was an enthusiastic supporter of only specific styles of filmmakers; notably Stanley Kubrick, Spike Lee, Jane Campion, Mike Leigh, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, James Ivory and Woody Allen, who credited Canby's rave review of Take the Money and Run as a crucial point in his career. On the other hand, Canby was also highly critical of some otherwise acclaimed films, such as Rocky, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi, Night of the Living Dead, After Hours, Blazing Saddles, A Christmas Story, Witness, Mask, The Natural, Rain Man, The Exorcist, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Deliverance, The Godfather Part II, Alien and The Thing. Among the best-known texts written by Canby was an extremely negative review of the movie Heaven's Gate by Michael Cimino. In the early 1990s, Canby switched his attention from film to theatre; he was named the chief theatre critic in 1994. Canby, was also an occasional playwright and novelist, penning the novels Living Quarters (1975) and Unnatural Scenery (1979) and the plays End of the War (1978), After All (1981) and The Old Flag (1984), a drama set during the civil war. The career of Vincent Canby is discussed in the film For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism by contemporary critics such as The Nations Stuart Klawans, who talks of Canby's influence. ==Personal life== Canby never married, but was, for many years, the companion of English author Penelope Gilliatt. He died from cancer in Manhattan on October 15, 2000. Almost three years later, upon the death of Bob Hope, the late Canby's byline appeared on the front page of The New York Times. Canby had written the bulk of Hope's obituary for the newspaper several years before. == References  Further reading == * == External links == *Articles and Reviews by Vincent Canby at The New York Times * Category:1924 births Category:2000 deaths Category:20th-century American historians Category:20th-century American male writers Category:20th-century American non-fiction writers Category:American film critics Category:American film historians Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:American military personnel of World War II Category:American theater critics Category:Critics employed by The New York Times Category:Dartmouth College alumni Category:Deaths from cancer in New York (state) Category:Film theorists Category:Variety (magazine) people Category:Writers from Chicago Category:American military personnel who served in the Pacific theatre of World War II Category:Military personnel from Illinois ","title":"Vincent Canby"},{"id":"2225858","text":"The Great Yeongnam Road, or Yeongnamdaero, was one of the principal roads of Korea during the Joseon Dynasty, 1392-1910.

He grew up in Wilmette, Illinois the second oldest of five children including his brothers, Fred and Gordon and sisters, Marge (Peppy) and Marilyn. His high school days were spent at New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois. == Biography == MacKenzie and his first wife, Alix, studied with Bernard Leach from 1949 to 1952. His simple, wheel-thrown functional pottery is heavily influenced by the aesthetic of Shoji Hamada and Korean ceramics. He is credited with bringing the Japanese Mingei style of pottery to Minnesota, fondly referred to as the \\"Mingei-sota style.\\" MacKenzie described his goal as the making of \\"everyday\\" pots. Accordingly, although his pots are found in major museums and command high prices among collectors, MacKenzie has always kept his prices low and for various time periods did not sign his work (1970s, most of the 2000s) until recently resuming the use of his chop at the end of 2009. Most of his output was produced in stoneware, although he worked in porcelain at times during his career. MacKenzie was well known as a teacher. Since 1953 he had taught at the University of Minnesota, where he was a Regents' professor emeritus. His students have included Randy Johnston, Dick Cooter, Mike Norman, Jeff Oestreich, Wayne Branum, Mark Pharis, Barbara Diduk, Nancy d'Estang, Paul Dresang, Shirley Johnson, Michael Brady, Sandy Simon, and E.A. (Mike) Mikkelsen. Warren MacKenzie's second wife of 30 years, Nancy MacKenzie, died in October 2014, at the age of 80. Nancy was an accomplished textile artist using found objects from nature and the recycle bin. Warren continued to live in the home they shared outside Stillwater, Minnesota, where he maintained his studio until his death on December 31, 2018. Until December 2006, MacKenzie also housed a showroom on his property. The showroom operated strictly on the \\"honor system\\" whereby pots were marked with price stickers and visitors would pay for pots by placing their money in a wicker basket, making change for themselves as appropriate. Unfortunately, due to theft and customers selling his work for an outrageous profit online, MacKenzie closed his showroom, opting instead to sell his pots through the Northern Clay Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Trax Gallery in California, Lacoste Gallery in Massachusetts, and the Schaller Gallery in Michigan, as well as exhibitions around the country. On December 31, 2018, MacKenzie died aged 94. ==References External links == * Warren MacKenzie Oral History Interview via Smithsonian Institution * Lewis, Gary, Warren MacKenzie: American Potter.

Developmental disabilities cause individuals living with them many difficulties in certain areas of life, especially in \\"language, mobility, learning, self-help, and independent living\\".Center for Disease Control and Prevention. (2013). Developmental disabilities. Retrieved October 18, 2013 Developmental disabilities can be detected early on and persist throughout an individual's lifespan. Developmental disability that affects all areas of a child's development is sometimes referred to as global developmental delay. The most common developmental disabilities are: *Down syndrome is a condition in which people are born with an extra copy of chromosome 21. Normally, a person is born with two copies of chromosome 21. However, if they are born with Down syndrome, they have an extra copy of this chromosome. This extra copy affects the development of the body and brain, causing physical and mental challenges for the individual. * Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is thought to cause autism and intellectual disability, usually among boys. * Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are a group of developmental disabilities that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges. * Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. * Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affect a person‚Äôs ability to move and maintain balance and posture. CP is the most common motor disability in childhood. * Intellectual disability, also (sometimes proscriptively) known as mental retardation, is defined as an IQ below 70 along with limitations in adaptive functioning and onset before the age of 18 years.DSM-IV - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision, published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA, 1994) * Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or simply known as ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by executive dysfunction. Primarily in attention span, cognition, self-control, and emotional regulation. ==Causes== The causes of developmental disabilities are varied and remain unknown in a large proportion of cases. Even in cases of known etiology the line between \\"cause\\" and \\"effect\\" is not always clear, leading to difficulty in categorizing causes.Improving health outcomes for children and youth with developmental disabilities, A literature review/Surrey Place Services 2013 Genetic factors have long been implicated in the causation of developmental disabilities. There is also a large environmental component to these conditions, and the relative contributions of nature versus nurture have been debated for decades.Finucane, B.(2012) Introduction to special issue on developmental disabilities. National Society of Genetic Counselors, Inc. 749-751. Current theories on causation focus on genetic factors, and over 1,000 known genetic conditions include developmental disabilities as a symptom. Developmental disabilities affect between 1 and 2% of the population in most western countries, although many government sources acknowledge that statistics are flawed in this area. The worldwide proportion of people with developmental disabilities is believed to be approximately 1.4%. It is twice as common in males as in females, and some researchers have found that the prevalence of mild developmental disabilities is likely to be higher in areas of poverty and deprivation, and among people of certain ethnicities. ==Diagnosis and quantification== Developmental disabilities can be initially suspected when a child does not reach expected child development stages. Subsequently, a differential diagnosis may be used to diagnose an underlying disease, which may include a physical examination and genetic tests. The degree of disability can be quantified by assigning a developmental age to a person, which is age of the group into which test scores place the person. This, in turn, can be used to calculate a ' (DQ) as follows:, in turn citing Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. DQ = \\\\frac{Developmental\\\\ age}{Chronological\\\\ age} * 100 ==Associated issuesPhysical health issues=== There are many physical health factors associated with developmental disabilities. For some specific syndromes and diagnoses, these are inherent, such as poor heart function in people with Down syndrome. People with severe communication difficulties find it difficult to articulate their health needs, and without adequate support and education might not recognize ill health. Epilepsy, sensory problems (such as poor vision and hearing), obesity and poor dental health are over-represented in this population. Life expectancy among people with developmental disabilities as a group is estimated at 20 years below average, although this is improving with advancements in adaptive and medical technologies, and as people are leading healthier, more fulfilling lives, and some conditions (such as Freeman‚ÄìSheldon syndrome) do not impact life expectancy. ===Mental health issues (dual diagnoses)=== Mental health issues, and psychiatric illnesses, are more likely to occur in people with developmental disabilities than in the general population. A number of factors are attributed to the high incidence rate of dual diagnoses: * The high likelihood of encountering traumatic events throughout their lifetime (such as abandonment by loved ones, abuse, bullying and harassment) * The social and developmental restrictions placed upon people with developmental disabilities (such as lack of education, poverty, limited employment opportunities, limited opportunities for fulfilling relationships, boredom) * Biological factors (such as brain injury, epilepsy, illicit and prescribed drug and alcohol misuse) * Developmental factors (such as lack of understanding of social norms and appropriate behavior, inability of those around to allow/understand expressions of grief and other human emotions) * External monitoring factor: all federal- or state-funded residences are required to have some form of behavioral monitoring for each person with developmental disability at the residence. With this information psychological diagnoses are more easily given than with the general population that has less consistent monitoring. * Access to health care providers: in the United States, all federal- or state-funded residences require the residents to have annual visits to various health care providers. With consistent visits to health care providers more people with developmental disabilities are likely to receive appropriate treatment than the general population that is not required to visit various health care providers. These problems are exacerbated by difficulties in diagnosis of mental health issues, and in appropriate treatment and medication, as for physical health issues. ===Abuse and vulnerability=== Abuse is a significant issue for people with developmental disabilities, and as a group they are regarded as vulnerable people in most jurisdictions. Common types of abuse include: * Physical abuse (withholding food, hitting, punching, pushing, etc.) * Neglect (withholding help when required, e.g., assistance with personal hygiene) * Sexual abuse is associated with psychological disturbance. Sequeira, Howlin & Hollins found that sexual abuse was associated with increased rates of mental illness and behavioural problems, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Psychological reactions to abuse were similar to those observed in the general population, but with the addition of stereotypical behaviour. The more serious the abuse, the more severe the symptoms that were reported.Psychological disturbance associated with sexual abuse in people with learning disabilities. Case-control study. / Sequeira, H; Howlin, P; Hollins, S.In: British Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 183, No. NOV., 11.2003, p. 451‚Äì456. * Psychological or emotional abuse (verbal abuse, shaming and belittling) * Constraint and restrictive practices (turning off an electric wheelchair so a person cannot move) * Financial abuse (charging unnecessary fees, holding onto pensions, wages, etc.) * Legal or civil abuse (restricted access to services) * Systemic abuse (denied access to an appropriate service due to perceived support needs) * Passive neglect (a caregiver's failure to provide adequate food, shelter) Lack of education, lack of self-esteem and self-advocacy skills, lack of understanding of social norms and appropriate behavior and communication difficulties are strong contributing factors to the high incidence of abuse among this population. In addition to abuse from people in positions of power, peer abuse is recognized as a significant, if misunderstood, problem. Rates of criminal offense among people with developmental disabilities are also disproportionately high, and it is widely acknowledged that criminal justice systems throughout the world are ill-equipped for the needs of people with developmental disabilities‚Äîas both perpetrators and victims of crime. Failings in care have been identified in one in eight deaths of people with learning difficulties under NHS England.Failings in learning disability deaths, report finds BBC ===Challenging behavior=== Some people with developmental disabilities (particularly Autism) exhibit challenging behavior, defined as \\"culturally abnormal behaviour(s) of such intensity, frequency or duration that the physical safety of the person or others is placed in serious jeopardy, or behaviour which is likely to seriously limit or deny access to the use of ordinary community facilities\\".Emerson, E. 1995. Challenging behaviour: analysis and intervention with people with learning difficulties. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press Common types of challenging behavior include self- injurious behavior (such as hitting, headbutting, biting), aggressive behavior (such as hitting others, shouting, screaming, spitting, kicking, swearing, hairpulling), inappropriate sexualized behavior (such as public masturbation or groping), behavior directed at property (such as throwing objects and stealing) and stereotyped behaviors (such as repetitive rocking, echolalia or elective incontinence). Such behaviors can be assessed to suggest areas of further improvement, using assessment tools such as the Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF). Challenging behavior in people with developmental disabilities may be caused by a number of factors, including biological (pain, medication, the need for sensory stimulation), social (boredom, seeking social interaction, the need for an element of control, lack of knowledge of community norms, insensitivity of staff and services to the person's wishes and needs), environmental (physical aspects such as noise and lighting, or gaining access to preferred objects or activities), psychological (feeling excluded, lonely, devalued, labelled, disempowered, living up to people's negative expectations) or simply a means of communication. A lot of the time, challenging behavior is learned and brings rewards and it is very often possible to teach people new behaviors to achieve the same aims. Challenging behavior in people with developmental disabilities can often be associated with specific mental health problems. Experience and research suggests that what professionals call \\"challenging behavior\\" is often a reaction to the challenging environments that those providing services create around people with developmental disabilities. \\"Challenging behavior\\" in this context is a method of communicating dissatisfaction with the failure of those providing services to focus on what kind of life makes most sense to the person, and is often the only recourse a developmentally disabled person has against unsatisfactory services or treatment and the lack of opportunities made available to the person. This is especially the case where the services deliver lifestyles and ways of working that are centered on what suits the service provider and its staff, rather than what best suits the person. In general, behavioral interventions or what has been termed applied behavior analysis has been found to be effective in reducing specific challenging behavior. Recently, efforts have been placed on developing a developmental pathway model in the behavior analysis literature to prevent challenging behavior from occurring.Roane, H.S., Ringdahl, J.E., Vollmer, T.R., Whitmarsh, E.L. and Marcus, B.A. (2007). A Preliminary Description of the Occurrence of Proto-injurious Behavior in Typically Developing Children. Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention, 3(4), 334-347. This method is controversial according to the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, saying that this type of therapy can lead to the development of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and worsening of symptoms later in life. Kupferstein, H. (2018), \\"Evidence of increased PTSD symptoms in autistics exposed to applied behavior analysis\\", Advances in Autism, Vol. 4 No. 1, pp. 19-29. https://doi.org/10.1108/AIA-08-2017-0016 https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/AIA-08-2017-0016/full/html ==Societal attitudes== Throughout history, people with developmental disabilities have been viewed as incapable and incompetent in their capacity for decision-making and development. Until the Enlightenment in Europe, care and asylum was provided by families and the Church (in monasteries and other religious communities), focusing on the provision of basic physical needs such as food, shelter and clothing. Stereotypes such as the dimwitted village idiot, and potentially harmful characterizations (such as demonic possession for people with epilepsy) were prominent in social attitudes of the time. Early in the twentieth century, the eugenics movement became popular throughout the world. This led to the forced sterilization and prohibition of marriage for the developmentally disabled in most of the developed world and was later used by Hitler as rationale for the mass murder of mentally challenged individuals during the Holocaust. The eugenics movement was later thought to be seriously flawed and in violation of human rights and the practice of forced sterilization and prohibition from marriage was discontinued by most of the developed world by the mid 20th century. The movement towards individualism in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the opportunities afforded by the Industrial Revolution, led to housing and care using the asylum model. People were placed by, or removed from, their families (usually in infancy) and housed in large institutions (of up to 3,000 people, although some institutions were home to many more, such as the Philadelphia State Hospital in Pennsylvania which housed 7,000 people through the 1960s), many of which were self-sufficient through the labor of the residents. Some of these institutions provided a very basic level of education (such as differentiation between colors and basic word recognition and numeracy), but most continued to focus solely on the provision of basic needs. Conditions in such institutions varied widely, but the support provided was generally non- individualized, with aberrant behavior and low levels of economic productivity regarded as a burden to society. Heavy tranquilization and assembly line methods of support (such as \\"birdfeeding\\" and cattle herding) were the norm, and the medical model of disability prevailed. Services were provided based on the relative ease to the provider, not based on the human needs of the individual. Ignoring the prevailing attitude, Civitans adopted service to the developmentally disabled as a major organizational emphasis in 1952. Their earliest efforts included workshops for special education teachers and daycamps for disabled children, all at a time when such training and programs were almost nonexistent. In the United States, the segregation of people with developmental disabilities wasn't widely questioned by academics or policy- makers until the 1969 publication of Wolf Wolfensberger's seminal work \\"The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models\\", drawing on some of the ideas proposed by SG Howe 100 years earlier. This book posited that society characterizes people with disabilities as deviant, sub-human and burdens of charity, resulting in the adoption of that \\"deviant\\" role. Wolfensberger argued that this dehumanization, and the segregated institutions that result from it, ignored the potential productive contributions that all people can make to society. He pushed for a shift in policy and practice that recognized the human needs of \\"retardates\\" and provided the same basic human rights as for the rest of the population. The publication of this book may be regarded as the first move towards the widespread adoption of the social model of disability in regard to these types of disabilities, and was the impetus for the development of government strategies for desegregation.Successful lawsuits against governments and an increasing awareness of human rights and self- advocacy also contributed to this process, resulting in the passing in the U.S. of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act in 1980. From the 1960s to the present, most U.S. states have moved towards the elimination of segregated institutions. Along with the work of Wolfensberger and others including Gunnar and Rosemary Dybwad, a number of scandalous revelations around the horrific conditions within state institutions created public outrage that led to change to a more community-based method of providing services. By the mid-1970s, most governments had committed to de- institutionalization, and had started preparing for the wholesale movement of people into the general community, in line with the principles of normalization. In most countries, this was essentially complete by the late 1990s, although the debate over whether or not to close institutions persists in some states, including Massachusetts. Individuals with developmental disabilities are not fully integrated into society. Person Centered Planning and Person Centered Approaches are seen as methods of addressing the continued labeling and exclusion of socially devalued people, such as people with a developmental disability label, encouraging a focus on the person as someone with capacities and gifts, as well as support needs. ==Services and support== Today, support services are provided by government agencies, non-governmental organizations and by private sector providers. Support services address most aspects of life for people with developmental disabilities, and are usually theoretically based in community inclusion, using concepts such as social role valorization and increased self-determination (using models such as Person Centred Planning). Support services are funded through government block funding (paid directly to service providers by the government), through individualized funding packages (paid directly to the individual by the government, specifically for the purchase of services) or privately by the individual (although they may receive certain subsidies or discounts, paid by the government). There also are a number of non-profit agencies dedicated to enriching the lives of people living with developmental disabilities and erasing the barriers they have to being included in their community. ===Education and training=== Education and training opportunities for people with developmental disabilities have expanded greatly in recent times, with many governments mandating universal access to educational facilities, and more students moving out of special schools and into mainstream classrooms with support. Post-secondary education and vocational training is also increasing for people with these types of disabilities, although many programs offer only segregated \\"access\\" courses in areas such as literacy, numeracy and other basic skills. Legislation (such as the UK's Disability Discrimination Act 1995) requires educational institutions and training providers to make \\"reasonable adjustments\\" to curriculum and teaching methods in order to accommodate the learning needs of students with disabilities, wherever possible. There are also some vocational training centers that cater specifically to people with disabilities, providing the skills necessary to work in integrated settings, one of the largest being Dale Rogers Training Center in Oklahoma City. (See also Intensive interaction) ===At-home and community support=== Many people with developmental disabilities live in the general community, either with family members, in supervised-group homes or in their own homes (that they rent or own, living alone or with flatmates). At- home and community supports range from one-to-one assistance from a support worker with identified aspects of daily living (such as budgeting, shopping or paying bills) to full 24-hour support (including assistance with household tasks, such as cooking and cleaning, and personal care such as showering, dressing and the administration of medication). The need for full 24-hour support is usually associated with difficulties recognizing safety issues (such as responding to a fire or using a telephone) or for people with potentially dangerous medical conditions (such as asthma or diabetes) who are unable to manage their conditions without assistance. In the United States, a support worker is known as a Direct Support Professional (DSP). The DSP works in assisting the individual with their ADLs and also acts as an advocate for the individual with a developmental disability, in communicating their needs, self-expression and goals. Supports of this type also include assistance to identify and undertake new hobbies or to access community services (such as education), learning appropriate behavior or recognition of community norms, or with relationships and expanding circles of friends. Most programs offering at-home and community support are designed with the goal of increasing the individual's independence, although it is recognized that people with more severe disabilities may never be able to achieve full independence in some areas of daily life. ===Residential accommodation=== Some people with developmental disabilities live in residential accommodation (also known as group homes) with other people with similar assessed needs. These homes are usually staffed around the clock, and usually house between 3 and 15 residents. The prevalence of this type of support is gradually decreasing, however, as residential accommodation is replaced by at-home and community support, which can offer increased choice and self-determination for individuals. Some U.S. states still provide institutional care, such as the Texas State Schools.Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services The type of residential accommodation is usually determined by the level of developmental disability and mental health needs.Chaplin, E., Paschos, D. O‚ÄôHara, J., McCarthy, J., Holt, G.Bouras, N. Tsakanikos E. (2010). Mental ill- health and care pathways in adults with intellectual disability across different residential settings. Research in Developmental Disabilities, 31, 458-63 ===Employment support=== Employment support usually consists of two types of support: * Support to access or participate in integrated employment, in a workplace in the general community. This may include specific programs to increase the skills needed for successful employment (work preparation), one- to-one or small group support for on-the-job training, or one-to-one or small group support after a transition period (such as advocacy when dealing with an employer or a bullying colleague, or assistance to complete an application for a promotion). * The provision of specific employment opportunities within segregated business services. Although these are designed as \\"transitional\\" services (teaching work skills needed to move into integrated employment), many people remain in such services for the duration of their working life. The types of work performed in business services include mailing and packaging services, cleaning, gardening and landscaping, timberwork, metal fabrication, farming, and sewing. Workers with developmental disabilities have historically been paid less for their labor than those in the general workforce, although this is gradually changing with government initiatives, the enforcement of anti-discrimination legislation and changes in perceptions of capability in the general community. In the United States, a variety of initiatives have been launched in the past decade to reduce unemployment among workers with disabilities‚Äîestimated by researchers at over 60%. Most of these initiatives are directed at employment in mainstream businesses. They include heightened placement efforts by the community agencies serving people with developmental disabilities, as well as by government agencies. Additionally, state-level initiatives are being launched to increase employment among workers with disabilities. In California, the state senate in 2009 created the Senate Select Committee on Autism and Related Disorders. The Committee has been examining additions to existing community employment services, and also new employment approaches. Committee member Lou Vismara, chairman of the MIND Institute at University of California, Davis, is pursuing the development of a planned community for persons with autism and related disorders in the Sacramento region. Another committee member, Michael Bernick, the former director of the state labor department, has established a program at the California state university system, starting at California State University East Bay, to support students with autism on the college level. Other Committee efforts include mutual support employment efforts, such as disability job networks, job boards, and identifying business lines that build on the strengths of persons with disabilities. Though efforts are being made to integrate individuals with developmental disabilities into the workforce, businesses are still reluctant to employ individuals with IDD because of their poor communication skills and emotional intelligence.Lewis, G. (2014). Business is still scared of autism. People Management, 32. High functioning individuals with developmental disabilities can find it difficult to work in an environment that requires teamwork and direct communication due to their lack of social awareness. Working with employers to better understand the disorders and barriers that may come from the struggles associated with them, can greatly impact the quality of life for these individuals. ===Day services=== Non-vocational day services are usually known as day centers, and are traditionally segregated services offering training in life skills (such as meal preparation and basic literacy), center-based activities (such as crafts, games and music classes) and external activities (such as day trips). Some more progressive day centers also support people to access vocational training opportunities (such as college courses), and offer individualized outreach services (planning and undertaking activities with the individual, with support offered one-to-one or in small groups). Traditional day centers were based on the principles of occupational therapy, and were created as respite for family members caring for their loved ones with disabilities. This is slowly changing, however, as programs offered become more skills-based and focused on increasing independence. ===Advocacy=== Advocacy is a burgeoning support field for people with developmental disabilities. Advocacy groups now exist in most jurisdictions, working collaboratively with people with disabilities for systemic change (such as changes in policy and legislation) and for changes for individuals (such as claiming welfare benefits or when responding to abuse). Most advocacy groups also work to support people, throughout the world, to increase their capacity for self-advocacy, teaching the skills necessary for people to advocate for their own needs. ===Other types of support=== Other types of support for people with developmental disabilities may include: * Therapeutic services, such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, massage, aromatherapy, art, dance/movement or music therapy * Supported holidays * Short-stay respite services (for people who live with family members or other unpaid carers) * Transport services, such as dial-a-ride or free bus passes * Specialist behavior support services, such as high-security services for people with high-level, high-risk challenging behaviors * Specialist relationships and sex education. Programs are set up around the country in hopes to educate individuals with and without developmental disabilities. Studies have been done testing specific scenarios on how what is the most beneficial way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules that everybody has, it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.Lund, Emily.

Completed in the 7th century, the enormous 9-story structure was built entirely with wood with interlocking design with no iron nails. It had a standing total height of 68 m (223 ft) or 80 m (262 ft), making it the tallest structure in East Asia and the tallest wooden structure in the world at the time of its construction. Only the massive foundation stones of the temple remain in current times. Hwangryongsa was the center of state-sponsored Buddhism during the Silla and Unified Silla eras which were cultural beacons of Buddhism during its time. Its name means \\"Emperor/Imperial Dragon Temple.\\" Archaeological excavations and other scientific studies of the temple began in April 1976 (OCPRI 1984) and continue today. ==History== Hwangnyongsa was built during the Silla period, under the patronage of the Silla royal family, on a plain encircled by mountains near the royal palace compound of Banwolseong (Half-Moon Palace). Construction began in 553 under the reign of King Jinheung, and was not fully completed until 644. King Jinheung originally intended for the temple to be the site of a new palace but when a dragon was seen on the proposed site, a temple was commissioned instead. Hwangnyongsa was designed to be a place where monks prayed for the welfare of the nation by asking for the divine protection of the Buddha and a means to impress foreign dignitaries. Following the defeat of Baekje in the 660s, the Baekje architect, Abiji, was commissioned to build a nine-story wooden pagoda at the site, and labored with two hundred artisans to complete the pagoda. This fact indicates that the Baekje had superior knowledge of wooden architecture. The nine stories supposedly represented the nine nations of East Asia and Silla's future conquest of those states. The pagoda stood until it was burned by Mongolian invasions in 1238. No wooden architecture from the Silla people survives today but the ruins of Hwangnyongsa suggest a Goguryeo influence. The temple site in a valley within Gyeongju National Park near Toham Mountain and about from Bunhwangsa Temple, was excavated in 1972, revealing the temple layout and covering 40,000 artifacts. ==Legends== Buddhism was strongly resisted by the nobles of Silla while the king personally supported the new religion. The king's Grand Secretary, Ichadon, suggested that he forge the king's royal seal and create an order that the people adopt the new religion. When the forgery was discovered by the nobles, Ichadon suggested that he be made the scapegoat, and that through his death the power of Buddha be made manifest. The king agreed to the plan. The nobles were predictably outraged when they discovered Ichadon's forgery and the king ordered his execution. Legend has it that when Ichadon was executed, a series of miracles occurred which proved the power and reality of the Buddhist faith, and the nobles converted to the new state religion. Ichadon's sacrifice was the impetus for the building of Hwangnyongsa Temple. Another legend concerns the giant golden Buddha statue that the temple possessed. It was cast in the reign of King Jinheung as the temple centerpiece. The legend states that the gold for the statue came from King Ashoka of India.Il-yeon: Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Three, chapter 70, page 179-181. Silk Pagoda (2006). Ashoka had apparently attempted to cast a golden triad but failed. He then put the gold in a boat along with scale models of Bodhisattvas. Each country that received the boat was equally unable to cast the statues, and not until the boat had arrived in Silla could a statue be cast. ==Dimensions== Only the massive foundation stones of the temple remain in current times. The original complex took seventeen years to complete. *The main hall was in length and in width. *The longest outer wall of the temple was 288 meters in length and the area enclosed by the outer walls covered approximately 80,000 square meters. *The temple ruins also contain pedestal stones which were for monumental Buddhist statues. One statue of the Sakyamuni Buddha was five meters tall. *The temple was originally arranged in the \\"three Halls-one Pagoda\\" style which meant that the pagoda was in the center of the complex and flanked by three main halls on the left, right, and behind the central pagoda. *The famous nine-story pagoda, which was commissioned by Queen Seondeok after the main temple was finished, was the largest Korean pagoda ever built as well as being the tallest structure in East Asia and the tallest wooden structure in the world at the time of its completion. It was reported to be tall and the body was made entirely of wood. Only its foundation stones remain today but they attest to the mammoth proportions of the original structure. The pagoda had a foundation area of , was supported by eight pillars on each side, and had sixty foundation stones. ==Gallery== File:Korea-Gyeongju-Hwangnyongsa-02.jpgA part of Hwangnyonsa remains.

The roots of the cuarteto ensemble are in Italian and Spanish dance ensembles. The name was coined because the early dance-hall numbers were invariably four-piece bands (violin-piano-accordion-bass). Cuarteto is almost always upbeat; its rhythm range is similar to that of modern Dominican merengue. In the 1970s, cuarteto became one of the cornerstones of C√≥rdoba's cultural identity--together with Hortensia magazine. Both reflected a local brand of popular culture overlooked by the establishment, and proposed an alternative to the Buenos Aires-centered culture that television was spreading to the rest of the country. Cuarteto was one of the genres that gave birth to the Buenos Aires tropical scene, which was renamed as bailanta in the 1990s following the usage of Corrientes province. ==Famous Names== Cuarteto Leo was the leading cuarteto band for almost 30 years, back in the 1970s. It established the sonic texture that prevails in cuarteto to this day. In the 1980s, Carlos Mona Jim√©nez became the foremost exponent of cuarteto after the break-up of his two-member Cuarteto de Oro (\\"Golden Quartet\\"). He established a pattern of nonsense humour and extravagant behavior that many tried to ape without much success. One of his most popular songs was Qui√©n se ha tomado todo el vino (\\"Who drank all the wine?\\"), which was danced with a characteristic hand move. Others, such as producer-bandleader Negro Videla, travelled to the Dominican Republic and Colombia to expand the range of their repertoire. Videla is the unofficial ambassador of Dominican music in cuarteto, with successful covers of merengue hits. Since the late 1980s, the Tru-la-l√° band has had great support from dancers. At one point they were endorsed by the Catholic church for avoiding racy themes in their lyrics. All in all, they have sold over a million records. Rodrigo became the leading cuarteto singer in the mid-1990s, and made inroads into Buenos Aires middle- class audiences. He died in a car crash on June 24, 2000. Many people believe the crash was not an accident, as Rodrigo was (allegedly) a pawn in a feud between rival mobsters. His song La mano de Dios (The Hand of God), which celebrates Diego Maradona through his most famous goal, has become a classic dance song in Argentina, and was covered by Maradona himself in his successful 2005 talk show. Gary (Argentine singer) was another Cuarteto singer with the Tru-la-l√° band, who died of natural causes in 2001. ==See also== *Music of Argentina ==External links== *Spanish language portal Category:Argentine styles of music Southern Cone music Category:Argentine dances Category:Dance in Argentina ","title":"Cuarteto"},{"id":"2225919","text":"A vexillatio (plural vexillationes) was a detachment of a Roman legion formed as a temporary task force created by the Roman army of the Principate. It was named from the standard carried by legionary detachments, the vexillum (plural vexilla), which bore the emblem and name of the parent legion. Although commonly associated with legions, it is likely that vexillationes included auxiliaries. The term is found in the singular, referring to a single detachment, but is usually used in the plural to refer to an army made up of picked detachments. Vexillationes were assembled ad hoc to meet a crisis on Rome's extensive frontiers, to fight in a civil war, or to undertake an offensive against Rome's neighbours. They varied in size and composition, but usually consisted of about 1000 infantry and/or 500 cavalry. ==Purpose== Because the Roman Army was not large enough to garrison the vast size of the empire (around 400,000 strong at the beginning of the 3rd century), most of it was stationed along the frontiers. This placed the empire in a precarious position when serious threats arose in the interior or along a remote frontier. There was no central reserve and it was rarely possible to take a full legion, or even a major portion of one, to a troubled area without leaving a dangerous gap in the frontier defences. The only logical solution was to take detachments from different legions and form temporary task forces to deal with the threat. As soon as it was taken care of, these vexillationes were dissolved, and the detachments returned to their parent legions. The Roman emperors from the time of Augustus had at their disposal units in Italy and in the city of Rome. Over time these units would increase. Augustus created the praetorians who at the time of Domitianus constituted a force of ten cohorts, each of 1000 men strength on paper and who supplied a disputed number of horsemen. Traianus created the Imperial horseguards, the Equites Singulares Augusti, formed from his proconsular horseguard he had when he was the legate of Germania Inferior of about 1000 horsemen. Septimius made many changes in the Roman military. He doubled the number of the horseguards to 2000 horsemen. He filled the ranks of the Praetorians with provincial soldiers. He levied a new legion, Legio II Parthica, and for the first time in Roman history stationed it on the outskirts of Rome, making it more clear that the Roman emperor was a military dictator. Whenever the emperor went on campaign these guards units stationed in the city of Rome would accompany him. Added to these came the vexillationes of the border legions. Votive altar dedicated to Jupiter Optimus Maximus (abbreviated IOM) by the vexillatio of the cavalry cohort of the Sequani and Raurici, associated with the 22nd Legion Primigenia Pia Fidelis Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL) 13.06509. ==Impact== The vexillatio system worked initially, due to the mobility provided by the empire's excellent roads and to the high levels of discipline, cohesion and esprit de corps of these units and the legions from which they came. But during the Crisis of the Third Century (a turbulent period from 235 to about 290) vexillationes were shifted so rapidly from one area to another that units became hopelessly mixed up and became practically independent. Legions that would proclaim a commander as emperor could have a vexillatio in the real emperor's field army or garrisoned on the frontier. This was a major cause of disorganization in the Roman Army which resulted in sweeping military reforms under Diocletian and Constantine I where the basic army unit became the size of one (Quingenaria=500 Soldiers) or two (Milliaria=1000 Soldiers) cohorts instead of the 5000-man legion. ==Units== Later, under the Dominate, vexillatio refers to a cavalry unit of the Roman army. From the time of Diocletian and the Tetrarchy, and possibly as early as the reign of Gallienus, vexillationes were the usual cavalry units found on campaign though the ala still remained. In the 4th century the Vexillationes palatinae and Vexilationes comitatenses of the Roman field armies are thought to have been either 300 or 600 men strong. The Notitia Dignitatum lists 88 vexillationes. Other units, such as infantry cohortes and centuriae, and cavalry alae and turmae, may have had their own vexilla. In addition, vexillationes with their own vexilla would have designated units of special troops outside the usual military structure, such as vexillarii (re-enlisted veterans), who may have served separately from the cohorts of their ordinary comrades. ==ReferencesSources== * * Category:Roman legions Category:Infantry units and formations of ancient Rome Category:Military units and formations of the Roman Empire Category:Roman auxiliaries ","title":"Vexillatio"},{"id":"2225920","text":"Michael Matusow (born April 30, 1968 in Los Angeles, California) is an American professional poker player residing in Henderson, Nevada. Matusow's nickname of \\"The Mouth\\" reflects his reputation for trash-talking at the poker table. He is also known for sometimes ruining hours or days of good play with a single misjudgment (known as a \\"Mike Matusow Blow-up\\" or \\"Mike Matusow Meltdown\\"). Matusow began playing poker seriously in the early 1990s, first while working as a poker dealer, then as a professional player. His successes include being a four-time World Series of Poker bracelet winner and the winner of the 2005 World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions. ==Early years== Matusow was first introduced to poker when he played video poker at the Maxim Casino at the age of 18. He was a regular and played so much that he suffered from repetitive strain injury in his shoulders and arms. He occasionally stole money from his mother's purse and at one point attended Gamblers Anonymous meetings. Matusow was taught Texas hold 'em in 1989 by a rounder named Steve Samaroff. ==Poker career== At the 1998 World Series of Poker (WSOP), Matusow paid part of Scotty Nguyen's entrance fee into a satellite event for the $10,000 no limit Texas hold 'em Main Event. Nguyen went on to win, and gave $333,333 to Matusow in return for his partial stake. In 1999, Matusow won his first WSOP bracelet, winning the $3,500 No Limit Hold'em event defeating Alex Brenes heads-up to win the title.

The Stannaries managed mining law, taxation, court proceedings and jails. ===Wheal Coates=== The mine is renowned for its pseudomorphs, in this case tin oxide, or cassiterite, that takes on the shape of the feldspar crystals that it replaces within granite.

It operated primarily from 1826 to 1862. ===Wheal Lushington=== Wheal Lushington, also known as the New Wheal Towan, was a copper mine located on a hill overlooking the beach. The engine house that was built in 1872 was never used as an engine house and has since been converted for other uses.Barry Gamble. Cornish Mines: Gwennap to the Tamar.

In 1772, women and girls worked at the mines, earning 4 to 6 d per day.Lynne Mayers. Balmaidens. Hypatia Publications; 1 June 2004 [cited 29 September 2012]. . p. 27. In 1809 Wheal Towan had a cobbing shed which was a building used to break the ore up with a pointed hammer weighing up to 4 pounds. Teenage girls (bal maidens) sat on low benches and broke the ore to remove the rock and break the ore into small pieces. It was a loud and difficult task, but not as difficult as bucking which came next; this required the ore to be broken down into a powder or granules with a flat-ended cast iron hammer.Lynne Mayers. Balmaidens. Hypatia Publications; 1 June 2004 [cited 29 September 2012]. . pp. 64, 63‚Äì65. Some time before 1826 the mine resulted in ¬£130,000 profit, having been mined to a depth of 150 fathoms. It was then closed until 1826. Two 80-inch cylinder steam engines called Wilson's engine from the engineer Samuel Grose (1791‚Äì1866) were used in 1826 to drain the mine. The monthly output between January 1827 and March 1828 from the engine ranged from 48.9 to 84.2 million 94 pound bushels.Samuel Lewis.

It was also known as West Wheal Towan (1850‚Äì1867), Lelant Wheal Towan and West Wheal Lucy (1872). During the period he owned it, the mine provided Ralph Allen Daniell of Trelissick with a fortune estimated at the time as a \\"guinea a minute\\". The first underground steam engine was built in Wheal Towan in 1785. It was reopened in 1872 as West Wheal Lucy and abandoned soon after. The only remains on the surface are burrows created from the mine's operations. The burrows head in the direction of Towan Cross.D. B. Barton. A Guide to the Mines of West Cornwall; 2nd ed. Truro: D.

Her father's family's surname was originally Martini. Her paternal great- grandfather Francis Martini was born in Dublin to immigrants from Saronno, near Milan, Italy. Two of Martin's maternal great-grandparents, William Green and Elizabeth Nangle, had a coal-mining background; they had transferred to Belfast from Larkhall, Scotland.\\"Who do you think you are?\\" , rte.ie; accessed 14 October 2016. ==CareerChips=== Martin began her musical career when she joined the band Chips in Omagh in 1969. They quickly became one of the top bands in Ireland on the live circuit, and released hit singles \\"Love Matters\\", \\"Twice a Week\\" and \\"Goodbye Goodbye\\" during the mid-to-late 1970s.Chips and Linda Martin in the Irish Charts In 1972, Martin left Chips to be a vocalist with new group Lyttle People, but rejoined her former bandmates the following year. The group appeared on Opportunity Knocks in 1974 and appeared a number of times on British television promoting their singles, but never scored a UK hit. With multiple entries to the Irish National finals of the Eurovision Song Contest, the band carried on into the 1980s. They scored a final Irish hit in 1982 with \\"David's Song\\", after which Martin left when she won the Castlebar Song Contest with \\"Edge of the Universe\\" in 1983. From this point she concentrated on a solo career as well as occasional live appearances with Chips until they recruited a new lead singer (Valerie Roe) in the late 1980s. ===Eurovision Song Contest=== She participated in the National Song Contest four times as a member of Chips; however, they did not score successfully. She participated another four times in the contest as a soloist and once more as part of the group 'Linda Martin and Friends'.National song contests ‚Äì Ireland With nine participations, she has been the most frequent entrant in the National Song Contest's history. She won the contest twice, going on to represent Ireland twice at the Eurovision Song Contest. The first of these victories was in 1984 with the song \\"Terminal 3\\", written by Johnny Logan (under his real name S√©an Sherrard). The song came second in the final, being beaten by eight points. \\"Terminal 3\\" reached No. 7 in the Irish charts.Irish Eurovision songs in the Charts ‚Äì Linda Martin , allkindsofeverything.ie; accessed 14 October 2016. The second victory was in 1992 when her song \\"Why Me\\" (also written by Logan) went on to win the final in Sweden. This became Ireland's fourth victory in the Eurovision Song Contest, and the song reached No. 1 in the Irish chart as well as becoming a hit in many European countries. Martin was, at the time, one of only three artists to finish both first and second at Eurovision, behind Lys Assia and Gigliola Cinquetti. Since then, only Elisabeth Andreassen and Dima Bilan have achieved this, raising the number to five. Martin was the first of the three artists to finish second first and first second, matched only later by Bilan.O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest ‚Äì The Official History. Carlton Books 2007. ===Television=== She has presented the RT√â quiz show The Lyrics Board, one of the broadcaster's more popular formats. She served as one of Louis Walsh's behind-the-scenes team on the first series of ITV's The X Factor. She also served as a judge on the first, second and fourth seasons of RT√â's You're a Star and on Charity You're a Star in summer 2005 and summer 2006. She was dismissed from the 2007 season, however, speaking on Saturday Night with Miriam on RT√â television on 28 July 2007, she insisted that she was \\"open\\" to being invited back on to the show. Martin has not ruled out a return to Eurovision following Ireland's dismal performance in the 2007 contest finishing last with only five points. She was a guest performer at Congratulations, the 50th anniversary Eurovision concert in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October 2005. Martin was also the Irish spokesperson for Eurovision Song Contest 2007 and was one of the five judges for Eurosong 2009 (Irish Selection for Eurovision). In 2012, she was the mentor for Jedward in the Irish Eurovision final Eurosong 2012. During the interval of Eurovision 2013, the host Petra Mede presented a light-hearted history of the contest, during which she explained to viewers that Johnny Logan had won the competition three times, in 1980, 1987 and 1992. Appearing alongside Linda Martin in some vintage footage she joked that he had won the third time disguised as a woman, saying, \\"I recognise a drag queen when I see one\\". The joke proved controversial, particularly in the Irish media. However, on 1 June 2013, during an appearance on RT√â's The Saturday Night Show Martin claimed that she had actually benefited from all the publicity. On the same show she performed a cover of the song \\"Get Lucky\\" by Daft Punk. ===Theatre=== Martin has also appeared in pantomime, in Dublin. She starred in Cinderella as the Wicked Stepmother, Snow White as the Evil Queen and Robin Hood as herself, at the Olympia Theatre. She toured Menopause the Musical with Irish entertainer Twink.

He was one of approximately 75 dissidents arrested, tried and convicted in 2003 as part of a crackdown by the Cuban government nicknamed the \\"Black Spring\\". He was given a twenty-year sentence on a charge of \\"activities against the integrity and sovereignty of the State\\", causing Amnesty International to declare him as a prisoner of conscience. ==Background== Espinosa was a graduate of the University of Havana, where he received a degree in economics. He served on Prime Minister Fidel Castro's Economic Advisory Group from 1965 to 1968 before spending fourteen years as the economic adviser at the Cuban embassy in Belgrade, overseeing Cuba's economic and technological cooperation with Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia. In 1984, he returned to Cuba to work at the National Bank, where he was responsible for trade and tourism. However, throughout the 1980s, Espinosa increasingly disagreed with national economic policy. When he discussed his views with a colleague in 1992, he was demoted, and four years later was fired. Espinosa began to write critiques of Cuban economic policy which he published overseas. He also hosted a radio program titled Charlando con Chepe (\\"Chatting with Chepe\\") in which he discussed the Cuban economy; the program was carried on the U.S.-funded station Radio Mart√≠. Espinosa was married to independent Cuban journalist Miriam Leiva. ==Arrest and trial== On March 19, 2003, Espinosa was arrested during the Black Spring after security agents reportedly spent 10 hours searching his apartment. At a trial on April 3, 2003, Espinosa was accused of \\"activities against the integrity and sovereignty of the State\\". Authorities stated that Espinosa had received money from the U.S. government, and that US$13,600 had been discovered sewn into one of his jackets. Espinosa was subsequently convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison. He was one of approximately 75 dissidents arrested and tried. Following a rejected appeal by Espinosa, the Representative of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, Christine Chanet, appealed to President Castro to pardon him. The administration of U.S. President George W. Bush appealed to Castro on Espinosa's behalf, calling on the government to provide treatment for his liver disease. A spokesman described the Cuban government as \\"going out of its way\\" to be inhumane to its prisoners. Espinosa's wife Leiva reported that he had lost forty pounds since his arrest and was kept in a cell with no windows or running water. Leiva became active in the Ladies in White, a group of wives of political prisoners which marched through Havana each Sunday protesting their husbands' detention. She continued to march even after Espinosa's early release. == Release == Espinosa was released from prison along with fellow writer Ra√∫l Rivero on November 29, 2004, after serving just over 19 months of his prison sentence; It was his sixty-fourth birthday. The authorities granted him medical parole because his already poor health had declined seriously during his incarceration. After his release, he called on the government to release the remaining Black Spring prisoners, stating, \\"The government really committed a very big error with us. We are completely peaceful and we want only the reconciliation of Cuban society.\\" In 2006, Espinosa stated his opposition to U.S. funding for the Cuban dissident movement, calling it \\"counterproductive\\" and stating that the Cuban people must solve its own problems. Following Ra√∫l Castro's assumption of the presidency, Espinosa expressed his hope that Castro could be the Deng Xiaoping of Cuba, improving the economy and the standard of living. ==Death== He died of liver disease on September 23, 2013, in Spain. ==Bibliography== * ==References== Category:1940 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Amnesty International prisoners of conscience held by Cuba Category:Cuban democracy activists Category:Cuban dissidents Category:Cuban economists Category:Cuban journalists Category:Male journalists Category:Opposition to Fidel Castro Category:University of Havana alumni Category:Deaths from liver disease Category:Cuban prisoners and detainees ","title":"Oscar Espinosa Chepe"},{"id":"2225961","text":"Gemini spacecraft.

The film stars Jodie Foster, David Niven, Helen Hayes (in her last film role), and Leo McKern. The plot follows a hooligan American orphan roped into a treasure hunt on a noble English estate. ==Plot== Con-artist Harry Bundage (McKern) believes that the lost treasure of pirate captain Joshua St. Edmund is hidden at Candleshoe, the large country estate of Lady St. Edmund (Hayes). Thanks to Harry's cousin Clara (Pickles), a corrupt former cleaning woman at Candleshoe, Harry has the captain's first clue; Harry recruits street-smart American foster child Casey Brown (Foster), employing her to pose as Lady St. Edmund's granddaughter, the Honourable Margaret, 4th Marchioness of Candleshoe, who disappeared at age four. Casey is the right age to pass for the long-lost Margaret and possesses several identifying scars that young Margaret was known to have. Casey agrees to go along with the con and discover further clues in exchange for a cut of the treasure. Lady St. Edmund, however, is living in genteel poverty, and Casey quickly learns that Candleshoe itself is constantly on the verge of being unable to pay its taxes. Priory (Niven), the estate's butler (who is forced to pose as various members of the household to conceal that all the other servants have been let go) manages to keep one step ahead of foreclosure by pawning the house's antiques, conducting tours of the estate, and selling produce at market. Four local orphans adopted by Lady St. Edmund assist Priory. Casey eventually becomes part of the family and decides to find the treasure for the benefit of Candleshoe, rather than for Harry. This nearly costs the girl her life when she is seriously injured trying to prevent Harry from stealing money from Lady St. Edmund. Casey, now unconscious with a severe concussion, is taken to a hospital, and remains there for several days. Meanwhile, without the money Harry has stolen, Candleshoe is unable to pay its taxes and is within days of foreclosure. When Casey learns that Lady St. Edmund is preparing to go to a retirement home and send the children back to the orphanage, she breaks down and tells them about the treasure. After unraveling the final clue together, the household returns to Candleshoe to find Harry and his crew tearing the place apart to find the hidden treasure. Casey, Priory, and the children manage to fight off the thieves until the police arrive, inadvertently discovering the treasure in the process. With Candleshoe safe and her scheme discovered, Casey, feeling she has no right to stay, prepares to return to Los Angeles, but is stopped by Lady St. Edmund, who offers her a real home at Candleshoe. Casey expresses doubt, wondering what will happen if Lady St. Edmund's real granddaughter ever returns, but she is eventually persuaded to return to Candleshoe with Lady St. Edmund. The ending is ambiguous as to whether Casey truly is the real Margaret.

He is best known for his appearances with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he was known by his ring name Trytan. ==CareerTotal Nonstop Action Wrestling=== Wilson joined Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in September 2003 as one-half of a heel tag team, Redshirt Security, with Kevin Northcutt. Northcutt and Wilson were corrupt, physically imposing security guards (who wore red t-shirts) loyal to Don Callis and Jeff Jarrett, and regularly butt heads with the diminutive face \\"Blackshirt Security\\" (Chris Vaughn and Rick Santel). After Redshirt Security was expanded to three members with the addition of Legend in November 2003, the trio began feuding with the rebels who opposed the administration of Jarrett and Callis, namely Erik Watts, The Sandman, and Raven. This led to a six-man Clockwork Orange House of Fun match on November 19, in which Wilson suffered a broken arm. In 2004, he was fired for steroid abuse and was replaced by Legend. Wilson returned to TNA one year later as Titus, the bodyguard of Jonny Fairplay. The gimmick was never televised, although Wilson made several dark match appearances, including a victory over Dallas on November 19. Fairplay was not employed by TNA on a regular basis, and the Titus character was eventually discarded. In early 2005, video packages were aired hyping the debut of Wilson's latest gimmick, Trytan. The Trytan gimmick had aspects similar to The Terminator, including wearing black leather attire, sunglasses and even utilizing the character's classic mannerisms. Even his finisher, a fireman's carry facebuster was dubbed the T-3, the shortened name of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, and a take- off of Brock Lesnar's F-5. Wilson began stalking Monty Brown, and would disrupt his matches, extending a hand towards Brown from the entranceway. On March 13, Brown and Trytan faced off at Destination X. Brown eventually gained the upper hand over Trytan, but as he prepared to hit his signature Pounce finisher, the arena lights went out. When the lighting was restored, a masked man was in the ring in place of Wilson. Brown Pounced and pinned the masked man and was awarded the victory, although he had been unable to gain a victory over Wilson. The masked man was later identified as Mideon, but was never properly included in the storyline. Wilson's push was virtually halted following his match at Destination X. He wrestled sporadically for TNA until May 2005, when he was placed in a tag team with Simon Diamond. Diamond and Trytan appeared at Slammiversary on June 19, defeating Apolo and Sonny Siaki in a tag team match. Wilson left TNA the following month when his contract expired and was not renewed. ===World Wrestling Entertainment=== Ohio Valley Wrestling On November 14, 2005, Wilson signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment. He was assigned to the WWE developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling. He originally went by the name Tytus, making his debut at the January 18, 2006 OVW TV show by coming out alongside Da Beast. At the July 25 SmackDown!/ECW tapings, he defeated Funaki in a dark match. He then began wrestling in OVW under the ring name Jacob Duncan, a gimmick which saw him dress as a woodsman wearing a mask similar in design to the one Mick Foley wore as Mankind. He also spoke to his \\"momma\\" about getting his revenge on those who made fun of him growing up, indicating a sign of storyline psychosis. After a match, Jacob was confronted in the ring by The Boogeyman and began a short feud with him. On August 23, Boogeyman unmasked Duncan to reveal his identity. At OVW's 400th anniversary show, Duncan defeated The Boogeyman in a tables match to end their feud. On October 25, 2006, Duncan won the OVW Heavyweight Championship from Chet the Jett in an impromptu title match. On December 15, Duncan dropped the title to Chet. In early 2007, Duncan began feuding with Dan Rodman over the interest of Beth Phoenix, resulting in a \\"love triangle\\". After the feud ended, Phoenix continued to manage Duncan in OVW before she made her last appearance in OVW on August 15, where she lost to Katie Lea in a number one contenders match for the OVW Women's Championship and then joined the main World Wrestling Entertainment roster full-time. On November 8, 2007, Wilson was released from his WWE developmental contract. On November 1, 2008, Wilson, reusing his Jacob Duncan gimmick, returned to OVW for one night only to cause a surprise attack on Anthony Bravado. ==Championships and accomplishments== *International Wrestling Association **IWA World Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Ohio Valley Wrestling **OVW Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *New Wrestling Association **NWA World Championship (1 time) ==References * Online World of Wrestling profile Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Ryan Wilson (wrestler)"},{"id":"2225987","text":"Niamh Kavanagh ( ; born 13 February 1968) is an Irish singer who sang the winning entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1993. The 1993 Eurovision Song Contest was held in Millstreet, County Cork, Republic of Ireland. She sang \\"In Your Eyes\\" to clinch a second consecutive win for Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest. The singer represented Ireland again in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo, with the song \\"It's for You\\". She performed at the semi- final on 27 May 2010, finishing 9th in a field of 17 contestants, thus qualifying for the Grand Final on 29 May 2010. In the final, she finished 23rd in a field of 25 contestants, having received 25 points. Kavanagh is highly regarded among fans of the Eurovision Song Contest, and the OGAE Ireland (official Eurovision fan club) president, Diarmuid Furlong, said: \\"A lot of us would regard Niamh as one of the best vocalists who's ever won the Eurovision Song Contest\\". While she has enjoyed success in Europe Kavanagh remains relatively unknown in the United States. However, the singer recorded an album in that country following her initial Eurovision success. ==Early life== Kavanagh was born in Glasnevin, Dublin, Ireland. Her father was a singer and a saxophonist. She often sang songs at family parties as a child. Her influences include Aretha Franklin, Ella Fitzgerald and Blood, Sweat and Tears, all of whom she listened to from a young age, as well as Bonnie Raitt. ==The Commitments== Kavanagh performed as a lead and backing vocalist on the film soundtrack for The Commitments in songs such as \\"Destination Anywhere\\" and \\"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\\". In spite of this, Kavanagh was not prepared for the boost in recognition she received for her later entries in the Eurovision Song Contest. ==Eurovision1993=== On 14 March 1993, twenty-five-year-old Kavanagh performed in RT√â's National Song Contest, which selected the Irish entry for the larger Eurovision Song Contest, to be held in Millstreet, County Cork, later that spring. Opening the show at Dublin's Point Theatre, Kavanagh performed \\"In Your Eyes\\" (lyrics and music by Jimmy Walsh). At the close of voting, Kavanagh handily won the National Song Contest with 118 points from the ten regional juries, a 39-point margin over the runner-up. This win meant Kavanagh and \\"In Your Eyes\\" would go on to represent Ireland on the Eurovision stage in Millstreet. At the Eurovision on 15 May, Kananagh performed \\"In Your Eyes\\" near the middle of the show, as the fourteenth act out of twenty-five. This time, the voting was much closer, and Ireland exchanged the leading position with the United Kingdom several times throughout the announcement of the results. With 187 points (a record at the time), Kavanagh went on to win the competition in a nail-biting finish, as the result was decided by the final maximum score awarded by the last country to vote. \\"In Your Eyes\\" went on to be the best-selling single in Republic of Ireland for 1993, and reached number 24 in the UK Singles Chart. It went on to become a double-platinum success and Kavanagh was recognised by people on the street. She recorded an album in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, and this album was produced by John Jennings. She later left music to spend more time with her children. ===2010=== Kavanagh was again representing Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010, with the song \\"It's for You\\". The contest was held in Oslo, Norway in May 2010 (semi-final: 27 May 2010; final: 29 May 2010). \\"It's for You\\" was written by Niall Mooney, Marten Eriksson, Lina Eriksson and Jonas Gladnikoff. Kavanagh performed \\"It's for You\\" in Oslo alongside her cousin, Niamh Kavanagh, a whistle player, and Nikki Kavanagh, a singer. Kavanagh's possible participation in Eurovision Song Contest 2010 was confirmed on 10 February 2010 when Ireland's public service broadcaster, Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann (RT√â), announced the five finalists for Eurosong 2010, the national final to determine entry. The national final occurred during season 48 of The Late Late Show on 5 March. Kavanagh scored maximum points to beat four other participants. Niamh Kavanagh performing during the semi-final of Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo According to The Irish Times, Kavanagh received \\"enormous support\\" from journalists and spectators in Oslo, and was much sought after ahead of the event. At the semi-final stage on 27 May 2010 she ‚Äì along with the other members of the Irish act ‚Äì qualified for the final, held on Saturday 29 May 2010. Performing 12th on the night, it was the first time in four years that Ireland qualified for the final. The song was the 10th to be performed during the final. At the end of the Eurovision Niamh Kavanagh scored a total of 25 points for Ireland bringing them to 23rd (3rd last) on the leaderboard in front of Belarus and the United Kingdom. ==Other appearances== On Sunday 3 September 2000, Kavanagh performed at the homecoming ceremony for \\"the quiet man of the Big Brother household\\", Thomas \\"Tom\\" McDermott, from Greencastle, County Tyrone, who had just been evicted from the first ever series of the British version of Big Brother the previous week. Kavanagh appeared on The Late Late Shows Eurovision edition in 2006, to perform \\"In Your Eyes\\" along with Linda Martin, and other past Irish Eurovision contestants. Kavanagh was the Irish spokesperson at the Eurovision Song Contest 2008. On the New Year's Eve she took part in the Romanian National Final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 where she performed her 2010 entry in the Contest and the ABBA hit \\"Happy New Year\\", alongside Chiara Siracusa and Paula Seling. In 2015, Kavanagh was a judge in Irish national final to Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2015 In 2018, Kavanagh took part in the music video for the Irish entrant for Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018, \\"IOU\\" performed by Taylor Hynes. She portrayed the mother character, while 2018 Eurovision entrant Ryan O'Shaughnessy portrayed the father character. ==Personal life== Kavanagh is married to her musician husband, Paul Megahey, from Carrickfergus, County Antrim, Northern Ireland, whom she first encountered in a recording studio. The couple have two sons, Jack and Tom, and have lived in Carrickfergus for 11 years. Kavanagh once planned to move to the United States to live there, but changed her mind following her success in the Eurovision Song Contest. As well as spending time with her children and walking the dog, Kavanagh spends time listening to any music that is sent to her and issues personal replies to everyone who sends this to her. ==DiscographyAlbums=== *Flying Blind (1995) ‚Äì Arista *Together Alone (with Gerry Carney) (1998) ‚Äì Random Records ===Singles=== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Song ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"4\\" Peak chart positions ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" Album -style=font-size:smaller ! width=\\"40\\" IRE ! width=\\"40\\" GER ! width=\\"40\\" NL ! width=\\"40\\" UK - 1993 !scope=\\"row\\"\\"In Your Eyes\\"  align=\\"center\\" 1  align=\\"center\\" 87  align=\\"center\\" 42  align=\\"center\\" 24  - 1994 ! scope=\\"row\\"\\"Red Roses for Me\\" (featuring The Dubliners)  align=\\"center\\" 13  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  rowspan=\\"3\\"Flying Blind - rowspan=\\"2\\"1995 ! scope=\\"row\\"\\"Flying Blind\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî - ! scope=\\"row\\"\\"Romeo's Twin\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî - 1998 !scope=\\"row\\"\\"Sometimes Love\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  Together Alone - 2010 !scope=\\"row\\"\\"It's for You\\"  align=\\"center\\" 8  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  rowspan=\\"2\\" - 2011 !scope=\\"row\\"\\"A Fool for You No More\\"  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî  align=\\"center\\" ‚Äî -  colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"font-size:85%\\" \\"‚Äî\\" denotes a single that did not chart or was not released. } ===Guest Appearances=== *The Commitments OST ‚Äì Kavanagh Performs \\"Destination Anywhere\\" and \\"Do Right Woman, Do Right Man\\" *The Commitments, Vol. 2 ‚Äì Kavanagh Performs \\"Nowhere to Run\\" and Backing Vocals on 7 other tracks *Mick Hanly ‚Äì Live at the Meeting Place ‚Äì Kavanagh Performs the track \\"Heart of Hearts\\" *Secret Garden ‚Äì Inside I'm Singing ‚Äì Kavanagh Performs the track \\"Simply You\\" ==References *Official website * *The Late Late Show Eurovision Special ‚Äì 5 March 2010 Category:Irish pop singers Category:Irish female singers Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Ireland Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1993 Category:Eurovision Song Contest winners Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Dublin (city) Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 2010 Category:People from Glasnevin ","title":"Niamh Kavanagh"},{"id":"2225990","text":"Ashington Association Football Club is a football club based in Ashington, Northumberland, England. They are currently members of the and play at Woodhorn Lane. Formed in 1883, the club have played in a number of local and regional leagues, including the Northern Alliance, the East Northumberland League, the North Eastern League, the Midland League, Wearside League and the North Regional League. They were a founding member of the Football League Third Division North in 1921 and are the northernmost team to have played in the Football League. The club were later founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968 and have been in the Northern League since 1970. ==History== The Ashington team of 1898‚Äì99. The club was established in 1883 and began entering the FA Cup in 1887.Brief History Ashington A.F.C. They joined the Northern Alliance at the start of the 1892‚Äì93 season when the league was expanded to twelve clubs. However, the league was reduced to ten club the following season, and as they had finished in the bottom two, Ashington were asked to leave.Northern Football Alliance Donmouth The club then ceased activities, but were brought back following a large meeting, joining the East Northumberland League in 1895.Other Leagues Ashington A.F.C. They went on to win the league title in 1897‚Äì98. Ashington applied to rejoin the Northern Alliance in 1901, but were rejected. However, the following season they were elected back into the league, finishing second in the vote to admit three clubs. They won the league in 1913‚Äì14 and moved up to the North Eastern League. When football resumed after World War I the club rejoined the North Eastern League, where they remained until being elected into the new Third Division North of the Football League in 1921. After all the applications had been considered by the League, Ashington were one of fourteen clubs marked out for admission in a single bloc, which they duly were.A history of admission to the Football League Non-League Matters In 1926‚Äì27 the club recorded its best performance in the FA Cup, reaching the third round, where they lost 2‚Äì0 at home to Nottingham Forest. After finishing bottom of the division in 1928‚Äì29 the club lost their bid for re-election, receiving only 14 votes to the 24 received by non-League York City. Ashington subsequently dropped into Division Two of the North Eastern League as Division One had no spaces.North Eastern League Ashington A.F.C. With only two clubs eligible for promotion, Ashington appeared to have missed out after finishing third. However, runners-up White-le-Head declined the opportunity of promotion, allowing Ashington to move up to Division One. Five years later the league was reduced to a single division, where they remained until the league folded in 1958 due to the resignation of the Football League clubs' reserve teams, unsuccessfully applying for election to the Football League in 1947 (when no vote took place) and 1950 (when they received no votes). Alongside several other former North Eastern League clubs, Ashington switched to the Midland League. In 1960 they were founder members of the Northern Counties League, finishing as runners-up in its first season. The North Eastern League was re-established in 1962, but lasted only two seasons. Ashington spent the 1964‚Äì65 season in the Wearside League before joining the North Regional League, which was largely composed of Football League reserve teams. They remained in the league for three seasons, before becoming founder members of the Northern Premier League in 1968. In the first season of the league, the club finished third-from-bottom and resigned due to the costs of being in the league. They spent a single season back in the Northern Alliance, before joining the Northern League in 1970. In 1973‚Äì74 they reached the semi-finals of the last-ever FA Amateur Cup, losing 3‚Äì0 to eventual winners Bishop's Stortford in a replay. In 1981 a second division was added to the league, with Ashington remaining in Division One. However, after finishing second-from- bottom in 1983‚Äì84 they were relegated to Division Two. In 2000‚Äì01 they won Division Two, earning promotion to Division One. However, they spent only a single season in Division One before being relegated back to Division Two. After finishing fifth in 2002‚Äì03, they won Division Two again in 2003‚Äì04 and were promoted back to Division One. In 2012‚Äì13 they won the Northumberland Senior Cup for the tenth time with a 3‚Äì0 win over Whitley Bay.

The society finch (North America) or Bengalese finch (elsewhere), Lonchura striata domestica or L. domestica, is a popular cage bird not found in the wild. ==Evolution== It is a member of the estrildid finch family. Many authorities call it a domestic form of the white-rumped munia (known in aviculture as the striated finch), at least probably, though some state that it originated as a hybrid of this species with others in the genus Lonchura. A DNA study found that it was more closely related to the white-rumped munia but not belonged to Indian muniya family than either bird is to the finch, the chestnut-breasted munia, or the \\"Silver Bill\\" (presumably the silverbill), indicating that it originated from the white-rumped. ==Behavior== Bengalese finches are well adapted to captivity and the company of humans. They breed well and are good foster parents for other finch-like birds. While two males may not get along without other company, it has been found the best \\"pairing\\" for fostering is to use two males, this works better than either two females or a male and female pairing. Two males will usually accept eggs or even partly grown young without any hesitation. These birds like to be close together and tend to all roost in one nest if kept in a group. In an aviary they lay eggs and crowd into a single nest, interfering with incubation (which is performed by the female and lasts 16 days) or damaging the eggs. Thus they breed better if kept as single pairs in individual breeding boxes. This sociability is also responsible for their American name of \\"society finch.\\" Bengalese finches are quite easy to look after. They are also quite easy to breed provided they are properly sexed. Obtaining a female-male pair can present a difficulty because both sexes look similar. However, it is possible to determine gender by behavior since males tend to display to females. One method to sex Bengalese is to place a single bird in a small cage completely isolated it from its own kind (both sight and hearing) and after several hours then introduce another Bengalese to the cage. If the first bird is a male, it will immediately display to the newcomer. Unfortunately, this does not necessarily mean the introduced bird is a female. But if the first bird does not display it is almost certainly a hen. Also, Society Finches can be housed with other finches including other societies, Zebra Finches, Gouldian Finches, and Spice Finches. ==Diet== They are generally given a diet of seeds, such as millets and canary seed, and greens. They will not usually take live-foods, but it has been found they will often accept housefly pupae, which they crack like seeds. This is particularly useful if they are being used to foster species that require a high protein component to be successfully reared. ==In research== Society finches have been used extensively in research on imprinting and on bird vocalizations, often comparing the structure of their songs to syntax..

Thomas Fanshawe Middleton (28 January 1769 ‚Äì 8 July 1822) was a noted Anglican bishop. ==Life== He was born in Kedleston in Derbyshire, England, the son of Thomas Middleton, Rector of Kedleston and educated at Christs Hospital. He then went up to Pembroke College, Cambridge, and on graduation was ordained in the Church of England. He was appointed curate of Gainsborough (1792), Rector of Tansor (1795), Rector of Bytham (1802), Prebendary of Lincoln (1809), Archdeacon of Huntingdon and Vicar of St Pancras. In 1814, he became the first Bishop of Calcutta. This diocese included not just India, but the entire territory of the East India Company (EIC). When he arrived in India he found that he was not allowed to ordain \\"Natives of India\\", as all ordinations were carried out by the EIC in London. In response, he founded Bishop's College in Calcutta, which admitted Britons Indians and Anglo-Indians, some of whom could go on to ordination. However although the College was built for seventy students, they still only had eight students fourteen years after it opened. In May 1814, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on the basis of being \\"a Gentleman well known to the literary world as the author of several classical works, and conversant with various departments of science\\" He died in Calcutta of sunstroke on 8 July 1822The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction, Vol. 19, Issue 552, June 16, 1832, p. 388. and is buried under the altar of St. John's Church, the then cathedral of Calcutta. ==External links== *Warwick William Wroth, Middleton, Thomas Fanshaw (DNB00), Dictionary of National Biography, 1885‚Äì1900, Volume 37. *Charles Webb Le Bas, The Life of the Right Reverend Thomas Fanshaw Middleton, D.D., Late Lord Bishop of Calcutta, London: Rivington, 1881; digital version on archive.org. *January 28, 1769 ‚Ä¢ Thomas Fanshawe Middleton Was the First Bishop of Calcutta, Christian History Institute, gospelcom.net (archived version). *Dan Graves, Thomas Middleton, First Bishop of Calcutta, christianity.com. * Online Books by T.

After spending over 15 years in the minor leagues as a player and player-manager, McNamara helmed six Major League Baseball (MLB) teams for all or parts of 19 seasons between 1969 and 1996. He directed the 1986 Boston Red Sox to the American League pennant, and was named his league's \\"Manager of the Year\\" by both the BBWAA and The Sporting News. However, the Red Sox were defeated by the New York Mets in seven games in the 1986 World Series when they failed to hold a two-run, two-out, two-strike lead in Game 6, and a three-run advantage in Game 7. ==Early life and playing career== McNamara was born in Sacramento on June 4, 1932. He was the fourth of five children of John and Josephine McNamara. His father, an Irish immigrant who was a railroad worker, died in 1944; his mother worked at the Department of Motor Vehicles. McNamara attended Christian Brothers High School, where he was selected as an All-City player in both basketball and baseball (playing catcher). At Sacramento City College (SCC), he led his team to the 1951 California Community College Athletic Association state championship and later was inducted to the SCC Athletic Hall of Fame. A right-handed batter and thrower who stood tall and weighed , in his playing days he was a peripatetic, weak-hitting catcher who originally signed with the St. Louis Cardinals organization in 1951. He rose as high as the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League during 1956 as a member of his hometown Solons, but he hit only .171 in 76 games played. ==Managing and coaching careerMinor leagues=== McNamara began his managing career with the Lewis-Clark Broncs in Lewiston, Idaho, of the Class B Northwest League in 1959, and when the club became an affiliate of the Kansas City Athletics in 1960, McNamara joined the Athletics' system. He won Southern League pennants at Mobile (1966) and Birmingham (1967), Kansas City's Double-A affiliates, where he groomed many future members of the Oakland Athletics' early-1970s dynasty (Hall of Famers Rollie Fingers and Reggie Jackson, as well as Sal Bando, Blue Moon Odom, Joe Rudi and others) during his tenure as the organization's Double-A manager. At the same time, McNamara also mentored future Hall of Fame manager (then an infielder) Tony LaRussa and future pitching coach (then catcher) Dave Duncan. Jackson, in particular, credits McNamara with helping him through his time with Birmingham, with the racial tensions that existed in the Deep South at the time. ===Oakland Athletics=== McNamara served as a coach at the major-league level for Oakland from 1968 through September 18, 1969, when A's owner Charlie Finley fired manager Hank Bauer and promoted McNamara, then 37, to succeed him. The Athletics were in second place in the American League West Division, nine games in arrears of the Minnesota Twins. They went 8‚Äì5 under McNamara for the rest of the campaign, then finished second to the Twins again in 1970 with an 89‚Äì73 mark. Finley replaced him with Dick Williams at season's end, and the A's would go on to win five successive division titles and three straight American League pennants and World Series titles under Williams and Alvin Dark. ===San Diego Padres=== McNamara returned to the coaching ranks from 1971‚Äì73 with the cross-bay San Francisco Giants before he took over the struggling San Diego Padres as their manager in 1974. The Padres improved incrementally, winning 60, 71, and 73 games through 1976, then signed free agents Fingers and Gene Tenace away from McNamara's old team, the A's. Expected to dramatically improve in 1977, instead the Padres stood at only 20‚Äì28 on May 28, when McNamara was fired and replaced by Dark. He spent 1978 as a coach for the California Angels, then was hired to succeed Sparky Anderson, also a future Hall of Fame manager, as skipper of the Cincinnati Reds in 1979. ===Cincinnati Reds=== After World Series titles in 1975 and 1976, the Reds finished second to the Los Angeles Dodgers for two consecutive seasons in the National League West Division, and Anderson had been fired amid controversy, reportedly because he refused his front office's order to fire members of his coaching staff. McNamara's 1979 Reds, minus legend Pete Rose, who had defected to the Philadelphia Phillies as a free agent, won 90 games‚Äîtwo fewer than Anderson's 1978 team. But they edged the Houston Astros by 1 games to win the NL West and became McNamara's first postseason entry. In the 1979 National League Championship Series, however, the Reds dropped the first two games at home in extra innings to the Pittsburgh Pirates, then were swept out of the playoffs in Game 3. Pittsburgh went on to win the 1979 World Series. McNamara's 1980 Reds won 89 games but finished third, 3 lengths behind Houston. Then came Cincinnati's frustrating 1981 season: the Reds compiled the best overall record in the National League West (66‚Äì42, .611), but the split- season format adopted because of the 1981 Major League Baseball strike denied them a place in the playoffs because they finished second (initially to the Dodgers, then to the Astros) in each half-season. The 1981 campaign became all the more distressing because the 1982 Reds unraveled, losing 58 of their first 92 games, falling into the division basement. McNamara was fired on July 20, 1982, with Cincinnati 23 games out of first place. ===California Angels=== Buzzie Bavasi had been the president of the Padres when McNamara became their manager in 1974, and had moved to the California Angels after the 1977 season as general manager. Along with then-manager Dave Garcia, he had hired McNamara as an Angels coach in 1978, before the Reds job opened up. After the 1982 season, when the Angels lost a heart-breaking ALCS to the Milwaukee Brewers, their veteran manager, Gene Mauch, retired. Bavasi then hired McNamara a third time, this time as skipper of the 1983 Angels, although that team dropped precipitously in the standings, winning only 70 games ‚Äì 23 fewer than in 1982 ‚Äì and finishing 29 games behind the Chicago White Sox. The following year, the 1984 Angels clawed back to .500 at 81‚Äì81, but came within three games of the division champion Kansas City Royals, who won only 84 contests all season. ===Boston Red Sox=== When Ralph Houk, 65, retired as Boston's manager at the close of the 1984 season, the Red Sox approached the Angels about McNamara's availability for the opening; he and Haywood Sullivan, the Red Sox' chief executive officer and co-owner, had managed together in the Athletics' organization in the mid-1960s. With Mauch ready to return to the dugout, the Angels agreed to let McNamara go to Boston, and in 1985, he led the Red Sox to another .500 season; but at 81‚Äì81, they finished 18 games behind the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League East Division. However, 1986 would be a different story. With fireballing Roger Clemens winning his first 14 decisions en route to the Cy Young Award and American League Most Valuable Player Award, the Red Sox won 95 games and captured the division title, setting the stage for McNamara's second and final postseason appearance as a manager. First, they battled back from a three-games-to-one deficit to defeat Mauch's Angels in the 1986 American League Championship Series, reaching the World Series against the National League champion New York Mets. 1986 World Series McNamara's managerial tactics during the 1986 World Series (especially in the last two games) received much criticism and scrutiny. In the pivotal sixth game, McNamara removed Red Sox ace Roger Clemens in the eighth inning despite the fact that Clemens was still pitching well. Both parties have different stories regarding Clemens's departure. According to Clemens, he did not want to leave the game, but McNamara insisted that Clemens asked to be taken out because he had a blister on his pitching hand. McNamara was also criticized for pinch-hitting Clemens with rookie Mike Greenwell, who struck out on three pitches, when veteran slugger Don Baylor was also available. McNamara's move was further questioned in light of the relatively poor performances of closer Calvin Schiraldi and longtime reliever Bob Stanley, especially considering that he brought Schiraldi into the game for what was supposed to be a two- inning save and left him in the game for the first two outs of the tenth after he blew the save. Yet, perhaps the decision that McNamara will be most remembered for is his leaving first baseman Bill Buckner in the game in the 10th inning rather than removing him for a defensive substitute. McNamara was ridiculed for years afterward for leaving Buckner on the field instead of replacing him with Dave Stapleton, who had previously been used to replace Buckner in late innings for defensive purposes (including Games 1 and 5 of the World Series). He later said, \\"I felt Buckner deserved to be on the field when we won.\\" Neyer, Rob. Rob Neyer's Big Book of Baseball Blunders (2006), p. 229. The Red Sox players also believed that their manager let sentiment overpower his judgement. Stapleton claimed that \\"[McNamara] damn well knows that he messed up. And he very well could have cost us the World Series that year.\\"Sowell, Mike. One Pitch Away (1995). McNamara finally responded to Stapleton's attack in 2011 during an interview with Bob Costas for MLB Network, reneging on his original claim that sentiment was what caused him to keep Buckner in the game and saying that Stapleton had the nickname of \\"Shaky\\" because of his poor defense.1986: A Postseason To Remember, MLB Network, 2011 With Game 7 delayed a day due to rain in New York, McNamara bumped originally- scheduled starting pitcher Oil Can Boyd in favor of starting Bruce Hurst, the winner of Games 1 and 5 and the presumptive MVP of the series if the Red Sox were to win, on three days' rest; the Red Sox had chosen to go with a normal four-man rotation during the series, unlike the Mets who pitched a three-man rotation. The decision upset Boyd so much that he began drinking heavily afterward and drank himself to the point of intoxication, according to accounts given by McNamara and his pitching coach Bill Fischer, thus rendering him unavailable.http://www.hardballtimes.com/cooperstown-confidential-the-sad- saga-of-oil-can-boyd1/ Hurst was staked to a 3‚Äì0 lead and pitched shutout ball for five innings, but tired in the sixth allowing the Mets to score three runs to tie the game. Since Boyd's actions had left the bullpen short staffed in a situation where every able pitcher would need to be available in case of an emergency, McNamara decided to bring Calvin Schiraldi in despite his struggles in Game 6 and the fact that he was still tired from pitching 2.2 innings that night (something he wasn't used to). Schiraldi gave up a tie-breaking home run to Ray Knight, the first batter he faced, and ended up surrendering three runs while recording only a single out. The Red Sox would lose the game 8‚Äì5, thus losing the series. Final seasons (1987‚Äì88) with Red Sox McNamara's 1987 Red Sox not only failed to repeat as divisional or league champions, they failed to reach .500: at 78 wins, they finished 20 games behind the Detroit Tigers. McNamara was invited to return for 1988, and the Boston bullpen was buttressed by the acquisition of All-Star relief pitcher and future Hall of Famer Lee Smith. However, the Red Sox played well below expectations and were only 43‚Äì42, nine games behind the Tigers, by the July 11‚Äì14 All-Star break. McNamara was fired during the hiatus, and his interim successor, third-base coach Joe Morgan, promptly won 19 of his first 20 games as skipper to pull the Red Sox into a first-place tie with Tigers by August 3. They went on to win the division championship. ===Cleveland Indians and interim Angels' pilot=== McNamara's managing career was not over, however. He spent 1989 as a Seattle Mariners scout, but on November 3, 1989, the Cleveland Indians hired him as their skipper for 1990. Under McNamara, the 1990 Indians improved by four games compared with the 1989 edition, going 77‚Äì85 and finishing fourth in the AL East, only 11 games behind the Red Sox. But in 1991, Cleveland took a major step backward; they won only 25 of 77 games under McNamara until his firing on July 5, and dropped 105 of 162 games that season. McNamara returned to the Angels' organization as a minor league catching instructor, but was called to manage in the majors a final time in 1996 at age 64. He became interim pilot upon Marcel Lachemann's resignation on August 6, and had directed them to a 5‚Äì9 record when he was hospitalized for a blood clot in his leg on August 20. After coach Joe Maddon helmed the Angels for three weeks while he was treated, McNamara was able to return to the Angels and finish the 1996 season. He compiled a 10‚Äì18 overall record, and was eventually succeeded by Terry Collins for 1997. ===Managerial record=== The 1996 assignment concluded McNamara's managerial career. Over all or parts of 19 seasons, he had a record of 1,167‚Äì1,242 (.484). {  Style=\\"text-align: center\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Team ! rowspan=\\"2\\" From ! rowspan=\\"2\\" To ! colspan=\\"3\\" Regular season record ! colspan=\\"3\\" Post‚Äìseason record - ! ! ! ! ! ! -  Oakland Athletics  1969  1970   rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"3\\" ‚Äî -  San Diego Padres  1974  1977  -  Cincinnati Reds  1979  1982   -  California Angels  1983  1984   colspan=\\"3\\" ‚Äî -  Boston Red Sox  1985  1988   -  Cleveland Indians  1990  1991   rowspan=\\"2\\" colspan=\\"3\\" ‚Äî -  California Angels  1996  1996  - ! colspan=\\"3\\" Total ! ! - ! colspan=\\"9\\" Reference: } ==Personal life== McNamara married his first wife, Kathleen, at the start of his playing career. Together, they raised four children ‚Äì three daughters (Peggy, Maureen, and Susan) and one son (Mike). He subsequently married Ellen Goode. The two of them moved to her hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, when McNamara retired from baseball. Very tragically, as noted in his obituary, in 1996 two of McNamara's young grandsons were killed by his son-in-law ‚Äî their father ‚Äî who then killed himself. McNamara died aged 88 on July 28, 2020, at his home in Tennessee. ==See also== * List of Major League Baseball managers by wins ==References *John McNamara at SABR (Baseball BioProject) Category:1932 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Albuquerque Dukes players Category:Amarillo Gold Sox players Category:Baseball coaches from California Category:Baseball players from California Category:Binghamton Triplets managers Category:Binghamton Triplets players Category:Birmingham A's players Category:Birmingham Barons managers Category:Boston Red Sox managers Category:California Angels coaches Category:California Angels managers Category:Cincinnati Reds managers Category:Cleveland Indians managers Category:Dallas Rangers players Category:Fresno Cardinals players Category:Houston Buffaloes players Category:Lewiston Broncs players Category:Lynchburg Cardinals players Category:Major League Baseball first base coaches Category:Major League Baseball third base coaches Category:Manager of the Year Award winners Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Mobile A's players Category:Oakland Athletics coaches Category:Oakland Athletics managers Category:Sacramento City Panthers baseball players Category:Sacramento Solons players Category:San Diego Padres managers Category:San Francisco Giants coaches Category:Seattle Mariners scouts Category:Sportspeople from Sacramento, California Category:Tulsa Oilers (baseball) players Category:American people of Irish descent ","title":"John McNamara (baseball)"},{"id":"2226053","text":"thumb J√∫lio C√©sar de Mello e Souza (Rio de Janeiro, May 6, 1895 ‚Äì Recife, June 18, 1974), was a Brazilian writer and mathematics professor. He is well known in Brazil and abroad by his books on recreational mathematics, most of them published under the pen names of Malba Tahan and Breno de Alencar Bianco. He has been called by one biographer \\"the only mathematics teacher who ever became as famous as a soccer player\\". He wrote 69 books of tales and 51 of mathematics and other subjects, which by 1995 had sold over two million books. His most famous work, The Man Who Counted, saw its 54th printing in 2001. J√∫lio C√©sar's most popular books, including The Man Who Counted, are collections of mathematical problems, puzzles, and curiosities, embedded in tales inspired by the Arabian Nights. He thoroughly researched his subject matters ‚Äî not only the mathematics, but also the history, geography, and culture of the Islamic Empire which was the backdrop and connecting thread of his books. Yet J√∫lio C√©sar's travels outside Brazil were limited to short visits to Buenos Aires, Montevideo, and Lisbon: he never set foot in the deserts and cities which he so vividly described in his book. J√∫lio C√©sar was very critical of the educational methods used in Brazilian classrooms, especially for mathematics. \\"The mathematics teacher is a sadist,\\" he claimed, \\"who loves to make everything as complicated as possible.\\" In education, he was decades ahead of his time, and today his proposals are still more praised than implemented. For his books, J√∫lio C√©sar received a prize by the prestigious Brazilian Literary Academy and was made a member of the Pernambuco Literary Academy. The Malba Tahan Institute was founded in 2004 at Queluz to preserve his legacy. The State Legislature of Rio de Janeiro determined that his birthday, May 6, be commemorated as the Mathematician's Day. ==BiographyEarly life=== J√∫lio C√©sar was born in Rio de Janeiro but spent most of his childhood in Queluz S√£o Paulo, a small rural town in the State of S√£o Paulo. His father, Jo√£o de Deus de Mello e Souza, was a civil servant with limited salary and eight (some reports say nine) children to support; so one thing that young J√∫lio C√©sar surely learned to count well were the pennies of his scant allowance. In 1905 he was sent with his older brother Jo√£o Batista to Rio de Janeiro, to attend a preparatory school for a prestigious high school, the Col√©gio Militar do Rio de Janeiro. He was admitted to the Col√©gio in 1906, which he left in 1909 for the Col√©gio Pedro II. Ironically, the kid who would become the most famous Brazilian mathematician of all time was a rather poor student himself. In a 1905 letter to their parents, Jo√£o Batista tells that little J√∫lio \\"is bad at writing, and a failure in mathematics\\". His report card at the Col√©gio Pedro II in Rio de Janeiro records that he once failed an Algebra exam, and barely passed one on Arithmetics. He later attributed these results to the teaching practices of the time, based on \\"the detestable method of salivation\\". However, he did give signs of his originality and non- conventionalism in other ways. As a kid in Queluz he used to keep frogs as pets, and at one point he had some 50 animals in his yard. One of them, nicknamed \\"Monsignor\\", would follow him through the town. As a grown up, he kept up with this hobby after a fashion, by assembling a large collection of frog statuettes. ===A budding writer=== His career as a writer began while he was still in high school, when one of his classmates offered him a brand-new pen and a postage stamp from Chile in exchange for an essay on the theme of \\"Hope\\", the homework for the next day. According to his memoirs, J√∫lio was called late at night by other anxious students, and by the next morning he had provided four different essays on \\"Hope\\", at 400 r√©is the piece. He kept on this activity for the rest of the year, writing on \\"Hate\\", \\"Nostalgia\\", and whatever else the teacher demanded. Many years later he met his teacher, Silva Ramos, and told him of those dubious activities. When Silva Ramos introduced him jokingly to Raul Pederneiras as a \\"merchant of Hope and Hate\\", he got from the man a prophetic advice: \\"Forget Hate, and go on selling Hope. Take up this poetic profession, Merchant of Hope: since that business is profitable for the buyer, and even more so for the seller.\\" ===It is all in the name=== J√∫lio began to write tales on his own while still in his teens, but did not impress the critics in his family. His brother Jo√£o Batista recalls that J√∫lio's tales were chock full of superfluous characters with bizarre names like \\"Mardukbarian\\" or \\"Protochol√≥ski\\". In 1918, at the age of 23, J√∫lio C√©sar offered five of his tales to the editor of the newspaper O Imparcial, where he worked; but his boss did not even look at them. Undaunted, J√∫lio picked up the manuscripts and brought them back a few days later, this time pretending that they were translations of the work of a certain \\"R. S. Slade,\\" supposedly the rage in New York City. The first of those tales, The Jew's Revenge, was published in the front page of the next issue of the newspaper; and the rest followed suit. This experience convinced J√∫lio to assume a \\"foreign\\" pen name. He chose an Arabian identity ‚Äî because, as he declared in an interview, the Arabs were unsurpassed in the art of storytelling. For the next seven years he prepared himself by studying Arabic and reading all he could on Islamic culture. In 1925, he sold the idea of a series of tales on Oriental themes to Irineu Marinho, editor of the newspaper A Noite (which would later become a huge Brazilian media conglomerate, the Organiza√ß√µes Globo). His stories, published in the column Contos de Malba Tahan (\\"Tales of Malba Tahan\\"), were attributed to a fictitious Arabian scholar of that name, and ostensibly translated by an equally fictitious \\"Professor Breno Alencar Bianco\\". Whether for the catchy pseudonym, or (more likely) for the author's lively style and imagination, his books were a resounding success, and he became a national celebrity. Even though his identity soon was known to everybody, he continued to use the name of Malba Tahan in his public life. He had a rubber stamp made with that name in Arabic script, which he used when grading his student's homework; and, in 1952 ‚Äî by special permission of Brazilian President Get√∫lio Vargas ‚Äî he added \\"Malba Tahan\\" to his own legal name.Sergio Lorenzato, UMA ESPECIAL P√ÅGINA DA EDUCA√á√ÉO MATEM√ÅTICA BRASILEIRA (in Portuguese) ===Teaching career=== Before being a teacher, he worked for a time as general assistant at the National Library. J√∫lio C√©sar graduated as an elementary schoolteacher at the Escola Normal do Distrito federal in Rio de Janeiro, and as a civil engineer at the Escola Politecnica in 1913. He started lecturing as a substitute teacher at the Col√©gio Pedro II, and later became a teacher at the Escola Normal. He began teaching history, geography and physics, and only later moved to mathematics. In time he became Chair at the Col√©gio Pedro II, at the Instituto de Educa√ß√£o, at the teacher's school of the Universidade do Brasil (which would become the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) and at the National School of Education, where he got the title of Professor Emeritus. Besides his classes at the teacher's school, he delivered over 2000 lectures on the teaching of mathematics, and wrote many books on the subject. In all his works J√∫lio defended the use of games as teaching aids, and the replacement of chalk-and-blackboard lectures by \\"mathematics laboratories\\" where students could engage in creative activities, self-study, and object manipulation ‚Äî a proposal that was seen as heretical at the time. In the Brazilian 0-to-10 grading system, J√∫lio would never give a zero grade. \\"Why give a zero, when there are so many numbers to choose from?\\" he used to say. He would give to the brightest students the task of teaching the weaker ones: \\"by the end of the first semester, they would all be above the pass line.\\" he claimed. While his methods and style charmed all his students, he had the opposition of many of his colleagues, who found his approach of connecting mathematics to everyday life as demeaning. Julio C√©sar also spread his message through radio programmes of several stations in Rio de Janeiro, including the R√°dio Nacional, Radio Clube, and R√°dio Mayrink Veiga, as well as in television, at the TV Tupi of Rio and the TV Cultura of S√£o Paulo. ===Other activities=== J√∫lio was an energetic campaigner for the cause of the Hanseniacs (lepers), who had historically been banned and confined in leper colonies. For over 10 years he edited the magazine Dami√£o, which preached the end of the prejudice and re-incorporation of former inmates into the society. In his testament, he left a message to the Hanseniacs, to be read at his funeral. ===A teacher to the end=== J√∫lio C√©sar's last public lecture was delivered in Recife, at the age of 79, to an audience of future teachers. It was about the art of storytelling. Back to his hotel room he apparently suffered a heart attack and expired. He had left instructions for his funeral.

He was the son of a deputy of the third estate of Dauphin√© to the Constituent Assembly. ==Life== He was born in Valence. He entered the magistracy and became procureur g√©n√©ral at Grenoble, but resigned this office on the Bourbon Restoration. He then devoted himself mainly to the study of criminal law, and in 1818 published La justice criminelle en France, in which with great courage he attacked the special tribunals, provosts' courts or military commissions which were the main instruments of the Reaction, and advocated a return to the old common law and trial by jury. The book had a considerable effect in discrediting the reactionary policy of the government; but it was not until 1828, when B√©renger was elected to the chamber, that he had an opportunity of exercising a personal influence on affairs as a member of the group known as that of constitutional opposition. His courage, as well as his moderation, was again displayed during the revolution of 1830, when, as president of the parliamentary commission for the trial of the ministers of Charles X, he braved the fury of the mob and secured a sentence of imprisonment in place of the death penalty for which they clamoured. His position in the chamber became one of much influence, and he had a large share in the modelling of the new constitution, though his effort to secure a hereditary peerage failed. Above all he was instrumental in framing the new criminal code, based on more humanitarian principles, which was issued in 1835. It was due to him that, in 1832, the right, so important in actual French practice, was given to juries to find \\"extenuating circumstances\\" in cases when guilt involved the death penalty. In 1831 he had been made a member of the court of appeal (cour de cassation), and the same year was nominated a member of the Academy of Political and Moral Sciences (Acad√©mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques). He was raised to the peerage in 1839. This status he lost owing to the revolution of 1848 which ended his career as a politician. As a judge, however, his activity continued. He was president of the high courts of Bourges and Versailles in 1849. Having been appointed president of one of the chambers of the court of appeal, he devoted himself entirely to judicial work until his retirement, under the age limit, on 31 May 1860. He now withdrew to his native town, and occupied himself with his favorite work of reform of criminal law. In 1833, he had shared in the foundation of a society for the reclamation of young criminals, in which he continued to be actively interested to the end. In 1851 and 1852, on the commission of the academy of moral sciences, he had travelled in France and England for the purpose of examining and comparing the penal systems in the two countries. The result was published in 1855 under the title La R√©pression p√©nale, comparaison du syst√®me p√©nitentiaire en France et en Angleterre. His son, Ren√© B√©renger, continued the work of his father. == Honours == * 1833: Officer of the Order of Leopold.M√©morial du centenaire de l'Ordre de L√©opold. 1832‚Äì1932. Bruxelles, J.

In 1968 Menotti was traded to Santos FC where he was teammate of Pel√© and won the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A, Intercontinental Supercup and Campeonato Paulista all in 1968. After his tenure with Santos, Menotti signed with Clube Atl√©tico Juventus, where he retired from football in 1970. ==Early managerial career== After retiring from play, Menotti became friends with coach Miguel \\"Gitano\\" Ju√°rez, with whom he traveled to the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico. Fascinated by the Brazilian style of play led by his friend Pel√©, he decided to become a coach himself. Menotti worked as coach assistant of Ju√°rez in Newell's Old Boys.Hurac√°n 73, El Gr√°fico, 16 Jan 2008 As manager, Menotti won his first title with Hurac√°n, the 1973 Torneo Metropolitano with a side that included notable players such as Carlos Babington, Miguel Brindisi, Roque Avallay and the outstanding Ren√© Houseman. That squad was widely praised by the media due to their style of playing, being considered one of the best Argentine teams of all time. Hurac√°n played 32 matches, winning 19 with 5 loses. The squad scored 62 goals and received 30.Argentina 73 by Javier Roimiser on RSSSF.com ==Argentina national team== Menotti was appointed the head coach of the Argentina national team in October 1974. ===1978 World Cup=== Menotti was the coach of Argentina when they won their first FIFA World Cup in 1978, defeating the Netherlands in the final. ===Between 1978 and 1982=== In 1979, Menotti led the Argentina U20 national team to success in the World Youth Championship in Japan, with Diego Maradona the team's star player. ===1982 World Cup=== At the 1982 World Cup, Argentina lost to Belgium in their opening match. The team started with Fillol; Olguin, Galv√°n, Passarella, Tarantini; Ardiles, Gallego, Maradona; Bertoni, D√≠az, and Kempes. Argentina then defeated Hungary and El Salvador, and met Italy and Brazil in Group 3 of the second round, although they lost both matches. ==Later career== Menotti was appointed Barcelona head coach in 1983, helping them to win the Copa del Rey, 1983 Copa de la Liga and the 1983 Supercopa de Espa√±a before leaving in 1984. On 3 February 2017, Guadalajara made a formal offer to sign him on as their academy director. In January 2019, Menotti was named as the director of the Argentina National Teams.Cesar Luis MENOTTI named as director of Argentina National Teams, mundoalbiceleste.com, 14 January 2019 ==Personality, influence and political views== Menotti always displayed a rebellious streak and cultivated an image of coolness. He wore long hair, dressed casually, and used to drop references to cultural icons in his conversations, from writer Ernesto Sabato to singer Joan Manuel Serrat. He was opinionated on politics, projecting a left-wing socialist image that contrasted with his holding a very visible post during the right-wing military dictatorship.Jonathan Wilson, Inverting The Pyramid: The History of Soccer Tactics, page 335 Menotti famously proclaimed: ==HonoursPlayer=== Boca Juniors *Primera Divisi√≥n: 1965 Santos *Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A: 1968 *Intercontinental Supercup: 1968 *Campeonato Paulista: 1968 Argentina *Copa Am√©rica third-place: 1963 ===Manager=== Hurac√°n *Primera Divisi√≥n: 1973 Metropolitano Barcelona *Copa del Rey: 1982‚Äì83 *Copa de la Liga: 1983 *Supercopa de Espa√±a: 1983 Argentina Youth *FIFA U-20 World Cup: 1979 Argentina *FIFA World Cup: 1978 ===Individual=== *World Soccer 22nd Greatest Manager of All Time: 2013 ==References *Todo-Argentina biography *Full Spanish language electronic text of \\"El DT del Proceso\\", a book strongly critical of Menotti's ethics and his links to the military regime * Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Rosario, Santa Fe Category:Argentine footballers Category:Argentina international footballers Category:Rosario Central footballers Category:Boca Juniors footballers Category:Racing Club de Avellaneda footballers Category:Santos FC players Category:Clube Atl√©tico Juventus players Category:Argentine Primera Divisi√≥n players Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Brazil Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:National Professional Soccer League (1967) players Category:New York Generals players Category:New York Generals (NPSL) players Category:Argentine football managers Category:Argentina national football team managers Category:1978 FIFA World Cup managers Category:1982 FIFA World Cup managers Category:1975 Copa Am√©rica managers Category:1979 Copa Am√©rica managers Category:FIFA World Cup-winning managers Category:Mexico national football team managers Category:Newell's Old Boys managers Category:Club Atl√©tico Hurac√°n managers Category:Boca Juniors managers Category:Club Atl√©tico River Plate managers Category:Club Atl√©tico Independiente managers Category:Rosario Central managers Category:La Liga managers Category:FC Barcelona managers Category:Pe√±arol managers Category:Club Puebla managers Category:Tecos F.C. managers Category:Argentine expatriate football managers Category:Expatriate football managers in Italy Category:Expatriate football managers in Mexico Category:Expatriate football managers in Spain Category:Argentine socialists Category:Association football forwards Category:Argentine people of Italian descent ","title":"C√©sar Luis Menotti"},{"id":"2226098","text":"Elizabeth Street may refer to: * Elizabeth Street, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia * Elizabeth Street, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia * Elizabeth Street, Lexington, Kentucky, United States * Elizabeth Street (Manhattan), New York City, United States * Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia * Elizabeth Street, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia * Elizabeth Street (Toronto), Ontario, Canada * Elizabeth Street School, Worcester, Massachusetts, United States == See also == * Princess Elizabeth Avenue ","title":"Elizabeth Street"},{"id":"2226104","text":"The Barbados Football Association is the governing body of association football in Barbados.

The name for the album was taken from the 14th-century Book of Taliesin. The structure of the album is similar to that of their first, with four original songs and three rearranged covers, although the tracks are longer, the arrangements more complex and the sound more polished than on Shades of Deep Purple. The music style is a mix of psychedelic rock, progressive rock and hard rock, with several inserts of classical music arranged by the band's keyboard player Jon Lord. Deep Purple's American record label aimed for a hippie audience, which was very influential in the US at the time, but the chart results of the album and singles were not as high as expected. This setback did not hinder the success of the three-month US tour, when the band played in many important venues and festivals and received positive feedback from audiences and the press. Deep Purple were still an underground band which played in small clubs and colleges in the United Kingdom, largely ignored by the media and the public. The British record company EMI did not release The Book of Taliesyn until June 1969, on the new underground prog rock sub-label Harvest Records, and the album did not chart. Even the release of the new single \\"Emmaretta\\" and new dates in the UK in summer 1969 did not increase album sales or the popularity of Deep Purple in the UK. Perception of the album has changed in later years and it has been reviewed more favourably. ==Background== Deep Purple were booked for a long tour in the United States, starting in October 1968, as a result of the unexpected success in the US and Canada of their first album Shades of Deep Purple, fronted by the hit single \\"Hush\\".Thompson: p.44Robinson: p.4 The single, released in June, had reached No. 4 in the US Singles Chart and No. 2 in Canada and was the main reason of their sudden popularity overseas. The situation was quite the opposite at home, where the band had been heavily criticized by the media and audiences.Thompson: pp. 44-47 In July, band and crew relocated from West Sussex to London.Bloom: p. 114 Their management rented a house at 13 Second Avenue, Acton Vale, which was used as living quarters and to prepare for the upcoming US tour when they were not away for gigs or promotion. Guitarist Ritchie Blackmore went to live there with his German fianc√©e Babs Hardie. Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, thought it would be more profitable to have a new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple.Thompson: p. 47 Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in the US. For these reasons, they were pushed back into the studio just a couple of months before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet. == Composition and recording == The request of the record label to record a new album only three months after their debut found the band unprepared, because the intense activity after the release of Shades of Deep Purple had left very little time for writing and rehearsing new songs.Thompson: p. 47-48 Under pressure, the musicians eventually came up with four lengthy original compositions, but to fill up the new album they reworked and expanded three cover songs, following again the example of the American band Vanilla Fudge, which many band members admired. The first was \\"Kentucky Woman\\", a hit single for Neil Diamond in 1967 which Deep Purple performed live at a BBC session in August.Thompson: p. 48 Though written by Diamond, Deep Purple's version musically leans toward the style of Mitch Ryder's recording of \\"Devil with a Blue Dress On\\". The second cover was \\"River Deep ‚Äì Mountain High\\", a single released by Ike & Tina Turner in 1966. Finally, the 1965 Beatles song \\"We Can Work It Out\\" was chosen after Paul McCartney himself had reportedly expressed appreciation for Deep Purple's version of \\"Help!\\" On the first of August 1968, Deep Purple entered De Lane Lea Studios in Kingsway, London, with producer Derek Lawrence and sound engineer Brian Aintsworth, who had both worked on their previous album. Tetragrammaton's advance of $250,000 had been used to book two weeks in the studio, a time which covered songwriting, rehearsals and recording sessions.Bloom: p. 115 Time was granted in larger amount than for the making of Shades of Deep Purple in May, feeding the band‚Äôs ambition of coming up with better original material than their previous effort. Deep Purple recorded \\"Shield\\" and \\"Anthem\\" on the first day. On the first song Ian Paice plays a complex drum pattern which sounds like a repeated clash of glass objects, while the second one required a string quartet for the baroque style interlude in the middle.Bloom: p. 116 The following days they proceeded with the composition and recording of \\"Exposition/We Can Work It Out\\" and of the original track \\"Listen, Learn, Read On\\". On 19 August, they concluded these sessions with the recording of \\"Kentucky Woman\\" and of the heavy and up-tempo instrumental \\"Wring That Neck\\", which came out from a tight collaboration between Blackmore and bass player Nick Simper. The name \\"Wring That Neck\\" comes from a phrase the band used when they were playing live, describing the bassist or guitarist really bursting at their instruments to create a hard noise (i.e., squeezing, or \\"wringing\\", the neck of the guitar). Another instrumental called \\"Playground\\" was written and recorded on 18 August, but the lyrics were never completed and it was eventually discarded. \\"River Deep - Mountain High\\" was always intended as the final track, so its recording was postponed until the other tracks were finished. The musicians‚Äô perfectionism required extra time to complete the track and it was taped only on 10 October, a long time after the planned deadline for studio recording. The mixing was supposed to be overseen by the band members, but their schedule in October was so tight that Lawrence did it without them.Robinson: p. 6 This dismayed the band at first, but the sound turned out cleaner, heavier and more polished than on their debut. The tapes were mixed in both mono and stereo, but the mono tapes were trashed, as neither Tetragrammaton nor EMI, Deep Purple's British label, had any use for them. == Release == Original American \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\" single cover from 1969 The album was released in the United States in October 1968, just in time for the tour. The American label insisted on changing the title of the instrumental \\"Wring That Neck\\", considered too violent, to \\"Hard Road\\". The track was used as the B-side of the single \\"Kentucky Woman\\", issued in December 1968. The Book of Taliesyn reached No. 54 in the US chart and No. 48 in the Canadian chart. The single peaked at No. 38 in the US and received much airplay,Bloom: p.120 but did not replicate the success of \\"Hush\\". In an attempt to improve sales of the album, a shorter and heavily edited version of \\"River Deep - Mountain High\\" was released as a single exclusively in the United States and Canada in February 1969, with \\"Listen, Learn, Read On\\" as the B-side. It reached No. 53 and No. 42, respectively, in the two countries and was not a success, charting lower than \\"Kentucky Woman\\".Robinson: p. 7 The album was distributed in Canada (in 1968) and Japan (in June 1969) by Polydor Records. EMI delayed the release of the album in the UK to June 1969, after the band had come back from the US and set up a proper tour of their home country.Thompson: p. 50 By that time, the band had already recorded and released their third album Deep Purple in the US, and recorded a single with a new line-up.Robinson: p. 10 The Book of Taliesyn was the first release by Harvest Records, a new sub-label which EMI executives had devised as an outlet for British underground progressive rock groups.Thompson: p. 63 \\"Kentucky Woman\\", with \\"Wring That Neck\\" as B-side, was the only single released in the UK in December 1968, but it was retired after only six weeks.Robinson: p. 8 Just as had happened with Shades of Deep Purple the year before, both album and single received little promotion and were widely overlooked, selling much less in the UK than overseas. The Book of Taliesyn was reissued many times all over the world, often in a set with the two other albums recorded by the Mk. I line-up. Besides the original issues, the most significant version of the album is the Remastered CD edition of 2000 by EMI, which contains previously unreleased recordings taken from the sessions of August and December 1968 and from TV shows appearances as bonus tracks. All the songs were digitally remastered by Peter Mew at Abbey Road Studios in London. Other notable re-releases of the album include a white vinyl collector's edition issued in 2015 for a Record Store Day. == Musical style == The musical style of The Book of Taliesyn is a mix of progressive rock, psychedelic rock and hard rockThompson: p. 49 and different observers think that in this album the band is more mature and in greater control of its own means of expression.Robinson: p. 5 Critics highlight how the compositions are generally longer and more complex than in their debut album. Deep Purple biographer Dave Thompson writes that a dark mood permeates The Book of Taliesyn with little indulgence to pop rock, citing influences of the American band The Doors in the original tracks written for this album. The influence of keyboard player Jon Lord's classical music upbringing is felt strongly in all the tracks, but this time he was not the main person responsible for songwriting and arrangements, which are considered by critics Deep Purple's first real group effort. Lord's interest in mixing rock and classical music would culminate in late 1969 with his Concerto for Group and Orchestra suite, but he already defined Deep Purple as a symphonic rock band in a 1968 interview. Nick Simper complained about Lord's excessive influence in composition and arrangements in a 1983 interview, which he said \\"resulted in a lack of direction for the band.\\" \\"Anthem\\" is perhaps the band's deepest venture into classical music on a regular studio album, with its baroque-style interlude reminiscent of a Bach fugue written by Lord and performed using Mellotron and string quartet. A similar approach can be found on King Crimson's debut album, released a year later. Rearranged excerpts from the second movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 and Tchaikovsky's Ouverture- Fantasy \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" are in the instrumental intro \\"Exposition\\", while \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\" is introduced by the notes of \\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\", written in 1896 by Richard Strauss and very popular after its inclusion in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, screened earlier in 1968. \\"Wring that Neck\\" and \\"Kentucky Woman\\" show more traces of the heavier music that the band would embrace in their 70s albums with the Mk.II line-up. Blackmore's guitar work is generally praised by critics. However, in a recent interview, the guitarist defined the album as \\"lame\\" and remembered that he had not yet found his own style of guitar playing at the time of recording. The lyrics written by the band's singer Rod Evans are very functional to the music and the marketing Deep Purple's record label was building up for the American hippie audience. Evans took inspiration for the fantasy-themed \\"Listen, Learn, Read On\\", which contains lyrical reference to the album's title, from the 14th-century Welsh manuscript Book of Taliesin, a collection of poems attributed to the 6th-century poet Taliesin. The title and cover art of the album were also inspired by the manuscript. Instead psychedelia and its rituals play a large part in the lyrics of \\"Shield\\". Simper thinks that Evans' lyrics are \\"far better than anything (...) has ever been written in other line ups, in Deep Purple.\\" == Cover art == Cover art and sleeve notes convey Tetragrammaton's decision to aim the album at the vast American hippie audience, which was very influential in the US at the time. The notes in particular were written in a mystical tone, evoking the bard Taliesyn as a spiritual guide and comparing listening to the songs to an exploration in the band members' souls. The original cover was drawn in pen, ink and color by the British illustrator and author John Vernon Lord, who coincidentally appears to share the same name as Deep Purple's keyboard player. The Book of Taliesyn was the only record cover John Vernon Lord ever designed and, according to the artist's recent retrospective book Drawing upon Drawing, the original artwork was never returned. In his book, John Vernon Lord remembers the assignment received from his agency Saxon Artists: The fee for the job was ¬£30, minus 25% for the agent. John Vernon Lord was, until recently, Professor of Illustration at the University of Brighton. ==Touring== Deep Purple arrived in California on 15 October 1968Bloom: p. 117 and their first public appearance on American soil was at The Dating Game TV show on ABC on 17 October. They were the first rock band to perform on the show,Thompson: p. 53 where Jon Lord was one of the contestants. The next two days the band played live in the US for the first time as supporting act of Cream in their Goodbye tour.Thompson: p. 54 The concerts were held at the Inglewood Forum near Los Angeles, California, in front of more than 16,000 people each night. Recordings of those live shows were issued in 2002 as Inglewood ‚Äì Live in California. The next gig at San Diego was the last one supporting Cream, whose management apparently did not appreciate the cheerful reaction of the audience to Deep Purple and dropped them.Bloom: p. 118 After a week of forced stop, their American manager succeeded in setting up a tour which included the San Francisco International Pop Festival and venues on the West Coast.Thompson: p. 55 This opportunity was very useful for the young musicians, who as headliners could lengthen their live shows up to 90 minutes and gained much needed experience on the road.Thompson: p. 56 This was particularly true for Blackmore, who developed and extended his guitar solos, incorporating more improvisations. The tour was a success and Deep Purple's popularity in the US received another boost from a TV appearance at Playboy After Dark alongside Hugh Hefner on 23 October 1968. The band had become a much requested act and more dates were added on the East Coast till the end of the year, including a two nights gig at the Fillmore East with Creedence Clearwater Revival and the James Cotton Blues Band, and Christmas holiday shows at the famous Electric Circus club in New York. In late December, the band managers Tony Edwards and John Coletta booked some studio time in New York to record a new single, after the relative failure of \\"Kentucky Woman\\" and \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\".Bloom: p.121 The band recorded the cover of Ben E. King's song \\"Oh No No No\\" and tried \\"Lay Lady Lay\\" by Bob Dylan and \\"Glory Road\\" by Neil Diamond, without satisfying results. The record label did not publish those recordingsThompson: p. 57 and a surviving take of \\"Oh No No No\\" can be heard only in the 2000 remastered edition of The Book of Taliesyn. The band returned in England on 3 January 1969 and went straight into De Lane Lea Studios to record new songs.Bloom: p.123 The recording sessions were interspersed with gigs and lasted from January to March; most of the songs ended up in their eponymous album, which would be released by Tetragrammaton in the US only in June 1969. Deep Purple debuted the new single \\"Emmaretta\\", new material and new takes on songs from their released albums at BBC sessions for the Top Gear radio show on 14 January. The song \\"Hey Bop a Re Bop\\" played at those sessions would later become \\"The Painter\\". Starting on the first of February the band went on tour in Denmark and the UK, with gigs in colleges and small clubs. In an interview, the band commented that in comparison with what they earned in America \\"they were actually losing a couple of thousand pounds every night they played in Britain.\\"Thompson: p. 58 The last UK gig was on 22 March and on 1 April 1969 the band was again on tour in the US, despite the lack of a new album to promote. It was at this time that Blackmore and Lord decided to change Deep Purple's musical style, veering towards straight hard rock, which led to Evans and Simper's dismissal in July. When The Book of Taliesyn was finally released in the UK in June 1969 a few more dates in the band's home country were added to promote the album release, even if the Mk.II line-up with new members Ian Gillan and Roger Glover was already rehearsing and recording new material in secret.Thompson: p. 62 Songs from this album were performed regularly by the Mk. I line-up. The exceptions were \\"Exposition/We Can Work It Out\\" and \\"Anthem\\", whose complex arrangements could not be easily reproduced in a live setting. The Mk. II formation performed \\"Kentucky Woman\\" in their first shows, but dropped it from the set list together with the few other songs from the first three albums, in favour of new material. Only the instrumental \\"Wring That Neck\\" remained a staple of Deep Purple's performances for a couple of years, working as a frame for Blackmore and Lord's long improvisations and coming back in the set list of the current line-up in the 2000s. ==Reception== Deep Purple's albums and singles were almost completely ignored in the UK, a fact that puzzled American reporters. In an interview, Simper tried to explain their lack of success in their home country, saying that the British audience was more interested in a fancy presentation than music and that blues rock \\"was becoming very big\\" at the time in England. John Peel, head of the Top Gear radio show, who had met the band in 1968 and had great expectations for The Book of Taliesyn, was not too pleased with the final result: American reviewers were enthusiastic of Deep Purple's live performances and the lack of a new successful single apparently did not ruin the positive perception of the band in the US, to the point that they were often addressed as an American band. Band members even thought about transferring their residence to the United States, but abandoned the idea when they learned that the 21-year-old Paice could be drafted for the Vietnam War. Modern reviews of the album go from positive to mixed. Joe Viglione of AllMusic compares Deep Purple's production to Vanilla Fudge's, underlining how the two bands covered songs from the same authors and used similar arrangements. He writes that on The Book of Taliesyn Deep Purple veered more towards progressive rock than their American counterparts, combining meaningful lyrics and \\"innovative musical passages\\". On the contrary, PopMatters criticizes the \\"Spinal Tapish\\" lyrics and the lack of hit material on the album with the exception of \\"Wring That Neck\\", considered \\"perhaps the first real Deep Purple composition.\\" Blogcritics reviewers stress how the original material, and \\"Wring That Neck\\" in particular, \\"stands the test of time well\\". However, Greg Barbrick finds \\"Jon Lord‚Äôs classical leanings (...) a bit too much\\" on tracks like \\"Exposition\\" and \\"Anthem\\", where they \\"threaten to derail the proceedings\\". Canadian journalist Martin Popoff in his Collector's Guide to Heavy Metal described the album's sound as a mix of hard rock and psychedelic rock usually associated with bands such as Mad River and The 13th Floor Elevators. He found The Book of Taliesyn very similar in structure and just \\"a bit darker, more bombastic and theatrical\\" than its predecessor, and considered the song \\"Shield\\" a \\"buried gem\\". == Track listing == All credits adapted from the original releases. ==PersonnelDeep Purple=== *Rod Evans ‚Äì lead vocals *Ritchie Blackmore ‚Äì guitar *Jon Lord ‚Äì Hammond organ, keyboards, backing vocals, strings arrangement on \\"Anthem\\" *Nick Simper ‚Äì bass, backing vocals *Ian Paice ‚Äì drums ===Production=== *Derek Lawrence ‚Äì producer, mixing *Barry Ainsworth ‚Äì engineer *Peter Mew ‚Äì restoring and remastering at Abbey Road Studios, London (2000) == Charts == ;Album {  width=\\"300px\\" !align=\\"center\\"Year !align=\\"center\\"Chart !align=\\"center\\"Position - align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"1969 align=\\"center\\"RPM100 Albums (Canada) align=\\"center\\"48 - align=\\"center\\"Billboard 200 (USA) align=\\"center\\"54 } ;Singles {  width=\\"500px\\" !align=\\"center\\"Year !align=\\"center\\"Title !align=\\"center\\"Chart !align=\\"center\\"Position - align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"1968 align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"\\"Kentucky Woman\\" align=\\"center\\"RPM50 Singles (Canada) align=\\"center\\"21 - align=\\"center\\"Billboard Hot 100 (USA) align=\\"center\\"38 - align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"1969 align=\\"center\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"\\"River Deep, Mountain High\\" align=\\"center\\"RPM50 Singles (Canada) align=\\"center\\"42 - align=\\"center\\"Billboard Hot 100 (USA) align=\\"center\\"53 } ==Notes References == * * * ==External links== *The Book of Taliesyn lyrics * Category:1968 albums Category:Deep Purple albums Category:Tetragrammaton Records albums Category:Harvest Records albums Category:Polydor Records albums Category:Albums produced by Derek Lawrence ","title":"The Book of Taliesyn"},{"id":"2226109","text":"The Whitewater River is a U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed May 19, 2011 southerly flowing right tributary of the Great Miami River in southeastern Indiana and southwestern Ohio in the United States. It is formed by the confluence of two forks, the West Fork and East Fork. The name is a misnomer, as there is no true white water on the river. However, there are many rapids due to the steep gradient present - the river falls an average of . The gradient rendered upstream navigation impossible, and in the mid-nineteenth century resulted in the construction of the Whitewater Canal paralleling the river from north of Connersville, Indiana, to the Ohio River. The West Fork, shown as the main stem of the river on federal maps, rises in Randolph County, Indiana, approximately northeast of Modoc. It flows south and southeast, past Hagerstown and Connersville, and joins the East Fork of the river at Brookville, Indiana. The East Fork rises in Darke County, Ohio, approximately northwest of New Paris. It flows south, through Richmond, Indiana, and joins the West Fork of the river at Brookville, Indiana. From the junction the Whitewater flows southeasterly into Ohio where it eventually joins the Miami River, a tributary of the Ohio River. Following continual flooding problems on the East Fork, and to help control flooding in the Ohio River, the East Fork was dammed by the US Army Corps of Engineers to create Brookville Lake in 1974. Brookville Lake extends from just south of Liberty, Indiana, to Brookville. Cities and towns on the Whitewater River (north to south) include Hagerstown, Cambridge City, Connersville, Laurel, Metamora, Brookville, Harrison (Ohio), and Lawrenceburg. Richmond, Indiana is on the East Fork of the Whitewater River and is the most significant town in the river valley, containing most of the population of the valley. The West Fork of the river is paralleled by State Road 121 from Connersville to west of Brookville, thence by U.S. Route 52 to the Ohio River. ==Whitewater Valley== The region surrounding the Whitewater River is known as the Whitewater Valley. The melting Wisconsin ice cap starting about 21,000 years ago created the Whitewater Valley basin as we know it today. The Whitewater Valley encompasses approximately between Hagerstown in Wayne County and Lawrenceburg in Dearborn County on the Ohio River. The Whitewater River and its valley were the main conduit of settlement of southeastern and eastern Indiana from Cincinnati and Clarksville (opposite Louisville) on the Ohio River during the first half of the nineteenth century, prior to the construction of railroads. The Indianapolis and Cincinnati Railroad constructed a line known as the Whitewater Railroad in 1863-1868 on the tow path of the Whitewater Canal, from Hagerstown to just west of Cincinnati. It brought to an end the commercial importance of the river and the canal. ==Recreation== The river today is devoted to scenic and recreational uses. ==See also== * List of Indiana rivers * List of rivers of Ohio ==References== * * Category:Rivers of Indiana Category:Rivers of Ohio Category:Bodies of water of Fayette County, Indiana Category:Bodies of water of Franklin County, Indiana Category:Bodies of water of Union County, Indiana Category:Bodies of water of Wayne County, Indiana ","title":"Whitewater River (Great Miami River tributary)"},{"id":"2226116","text":"The Gulf Center for Strategic Studies is a London-based think tank which was set up in 1985 and has local branches within the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain. ==References *Gulf Center for Strategic Studies Category:Foreign policy and strategy think tanks based in the United Kingdom ","title":"Gulf Centre for Strategic Studies"},{"id":"2226123","text":"Edward Ellsberg, OBE (November 21, 1891 ‚Äì January 24, 1983) was an officer in the United States Navy and a popular author.

He became an expert in undersea salvage and rescue. In 1926, he raised the navy submarine, S-51. For that success he was promoted to the rank of commander by an Act of Congress and awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by the Navy Department, since which time he has been popularly known as \\"Commander Ellsberg\\", regardless of his rank. Ellsberg described the raising of the S-51 in his 1929 book, On the Bottom. On June 1, 1918, Ellsberg married Lucy Buck. In letters to her he signed his name as \\"Ned\\". Lucy Ellsberg bore their daughter Mary on 29 August 1921. ==Return to civilian status== Poster for Hell Below (1933), adapted from Ellsberg's novel Pigboats After leaving active duty, Ellsberg worked for the Tide Water Oil Company and began writing books about his exploits and about historical events. In December 1927, Ellsberg volunteered for active duty to rescue survivors trapped in the sunken submarine S-4. The rescue efforts failed and Ellsberg returned home in early January 1928. Ellsberg's 1931 book, Pigboats, inspired the 1933 movie, Hell Below, starring Robert Montgomery, Robert Young, Walter Huston, and Madge Evans. His book Hell on Ice was adapted for an episode of Orson Welles's The Mercury Theatre on the Air that aired October 9, 1938, on CBS Radio. An adaptation was also presented on Welles's The Mercury Summer Theatre of the Air, broadcast August 9, 1946. ==World War II naval service== Immediately after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Ellsberg rejoined the navy. His first assignment was to conduct salvage operations at the newly liberated port of Massawa, Eritrea. Working in beastly heat with virtually no staff and poor administrative support, Ellsberg salvaged a large floating dry dock and several of the ships that had been sunk to block the harbor. Ellsberg returned the port to operation and the ships salvaged were added to the Allies' merchant fleets. During his work in Massawa, Ellsberg reported to the Lend Lease coordinator in Cairo, Egypt, US Army Major General Russell Maxwell. Ellsberg renamed the SS Liebenfels, a large German freighter, salvaged and refitted at Massawa, the General Russell Maxwell. He described the salvage of the port of Massawa in his book Under the Red Sea Sun. Ellsberg was promoted to captain by presidential order on June 19, 1942. The next year he was awarded the Legion of Merit by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in honor of his salvage efforts in Massawa. In Under the Red Sea Sun, Ellsberg complained that the American contractor that was assigned to give him administrative support was very unhelpful, but he did not name that company. The company, Johnson, Drake & Piper, Inc., itself claimed credit for clearing the port in the privately printed book, \\"Middle East War Projects of Johnson, Drake & Piper, Inc., for the Corps of Engineers, U.S. Army, 1942‚Äì1943\\" (New York: Johnson, Drake & Piper, Inc., 1943). That book contains beautiful photographs and drawings showing projects around the Middle East. From Massawa, Ellsberg went to North Africa to become Principal Salvage Officer in that theater. He worked under Admiral Andrew Cunningham, the British officer commanding naval forces in the area. Ellsberg's activities were detailed in his book No Banners, No Bugles. Ellsberg, worn out from constant work, was ordered home in early 1943 to recuperate. After a time inspecting ship construction activities, Ellsberg was sent to England in time for the Normandy Invasion, where he was instrumental in setting up the Mulberry harbour off the Normandy Beach. He also prepared 89 damaged or superannuated ships for scuttling to make artificial harbors. That operation gained him great admiration in Britain where he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). Ellsberg described his experiences in his book, The Far Shore. ==Retirement== right He rose to the rank of rear admiral before he retired from active duty in 1951 to enjoy Maine and Florida with his wife of 33 years. He continued to write, to lecture, and to consult on engineering projects. He died in 1983 at the age of 91, and is buried in Willimantic, Connecticut.

After almost five years of investigation and after consulting Lord Reith of the BBC and the South African government, it decided to introduce commercial radio to supplement the SABC's public service English and Afrikaans networks and help solve the SABC's financial problems. The SABC would build the equipment and facilities and would place them at the disposal of advertisers and their agencies at cost for productions and allow them to make use of SABC's production staff. On 1 May 1950, the first commercial radio station in South Africa, Springbok Radio, took to the air.Broadcasting in South Africa, Keyan G. Tomaselli Currey, 1989, page 197 Bilingual in English and Afrikaans, it broadcast from the Johannesburg Centre for 113 and a half hours a week.Press, Film, Radio, Volume 4, Unesco, 1950, page 435 The service proved so popular with advertisers at its launch that commercial time had been booked well in advance.Africa Institute Bulletin, Volume 11, 1973, page 155 The service started at 6:43am with the music Vat Jou Goed en Trek, Ferreira. The first voice on air was that of Eric Egan, well remembered for his daily \\"Corny Crack\\"Financial Mail, Issues 5‚Äì9, page 150 and catch phrase \\"I Love You\\".With the Lid Off: South African Insights from Home and Abroad 1959‚Äì2000, Todd Matshikiza, John Matshikiza, Jacana Media, 2000, page 54 Many drama programmes during the 1950s were imported from Australia but as more funding became available, Springbok Radio produced almost all its programmes within South Africa through a network of independent production houses. By the end of 1950, 30 per cent of Springbok Radio shows were produced by South African talent or material and independent productions were sold to sponsors. At the same time all air time had been sold or used and transmission time was extended. By the end of 1950 the revenue of Springbok Radio was ¬£205,439, in 1961 it had grown to over two million Rand and by 1970 had reached R6.5 million. By 1985, Springbok Radio was operating at a heavy loss.Debates of Parliament: Hansard, Volume 8, Issues 19‚Äì21, 1988, page 12123 After losing listeners with the handing over of its shortwave frequencies to Radio 5 and facing competition from television, despite the late arrival of the medium in 1976, it ceased broadcasting on 31 December 1985.Springbok Radio Revisited, SABC ==List of programmes== Springbok Radio's programme schedules reflected the white, primarily English-speaking, suburban lifestyle of the period, when many women were housewives. Weekday schedules broadly comprised a breakfast session (05:00 ‚Äì 08:30), women's programmes (08:30 ‚Äì 14:00), Afrikaans soap operas (14:00 ‚Äì 16:15), teatime chat shows (16:15 ‚Äì 16:45), children's programmes (16:45‚Äì18:15), dinnertime programmes (18:15 ‚Äì 19:00), the main news bulletin (19:00 ‚Äì 19:15), and family shows (19:15 ‚Äì 24:00). Saturday programmes were generally light: music, sitcoms and quizzes. Sunday was more sedate: music, chat shows, requests for the armed forces (during the 1970s and 1980s), news commentary and drama. For several years from its start in 1950 there were no advertisements on Sundays.

It housed the biggest sound recording archive of the station in the world and was an internationally recognized sound archive. The Society was formed in 2002 by Frans Erasmus in Johannesburg. The archive held many original recordings on tape, reel to reel and transcription discs and also has many private off-air recordings of the station. The society was engaged in a restoration project, transferring the analogue recordings to a digital format. On 1 July 2008, this Society launched Springbok Radio Digital, a service where many of the restored programmes can be heard. On 8 May 2012, the archives of the Society was handed over to the SABC Sound Archive. The Springbok Radio Preservation Society website currently broadcasts an eight hour weekday programme (Monday 06:00 to Friday 06:00) and a weekend programme (Friday 06:00 to Monday 06:00). The programming is distinct from that of the SABC's Springbok Radio Digital listed below. ==Springbok Radio Digital / Springbokradio Digitaal== This is a creation of the Springbok Radio Preservation Society of South Africa with assistance from the SABC, in which certain of the Society's restored programmes are streamed. The service started operating on 1 October 2008 and operates a 12-hour service from Mondays to Sundays, repeated four times. The service concentrates on presenting a selection of old time Springbok Radio programing restored and preserved at the Springbok Radio Preservation Society Archive. Springbok Radio Digital was officially handed over to the SABC Sound Archive on 8 May 2012. ==See also== * Radio Orion ==References * The Springbok Radio Preservation Society of South Africa. * The South African Broadcasting Corporation. * springbok radio online.

It comprises a music player and library manager, similar to iTunes, Windows Media Player and RealPlayer. It is used to manage the library of ATRAC OMG/OMA and MP3 recordings on a PC. It was first used in VAIO PCs put on the Japanese market in October 2001, and superseded OpenMG Jukebox. Version 2 was found on 2004 model products, and Version 3 on 2005 model products (Sony introduced native MP3 support on its music players in 2005). SonicStage was required to transfer and manage music on all network-enabled Walkman digital audio players and MiniDisc players, before the software was dropped in 2007.https://www.cnet.com/news/sony-good-riddance- sonicstage/https://opinion.latimes.com/bitplayer/2007/08/sony-connects-w.html The Sony Connect service was formerly used to purchase recordings online, and could be accessed from within the SonicStage program. However, Sony announced that on the 31 March 2008, its CONNECT download site would be going offline, therefore affecting SonicStage users. However, in late 2008, Sony launched a new online music store called \\"bandit.fm\\" on a trial basis for a small number of markets. It was expected that Sony would launch bandit.fm globally, however Sony never did this and closed the store in 2016. Japan exclusively uses the mora service. == Features  Copying and usage restriction === SonicStage is closely tied to a requirement that the program guard against copyright infractions. Sony music players have a write-only design. Somewhat similar to an Apple iPod, it is not generally possible to move tracks from the music player to the PC hard drive, and thereby from one music player to another. Some earlier models (such as some of the Net-MD line) could not even transfer voice recordings made by the user (with the player's microphone input) to their PC. Copy restriction is provided not by any one feature, but by a group of design features and software limitations. The main features being: # The software strictly enforces digital rights management through its use of OpenMG. SonicStage ties the DRM license of each track to the hardware of the computer from which it has been transferred. SonicStage will not allow transfer of tracks from the player to another computer. It is possible, however, to backup \\"My Library\\" and import it into another installation of SonicStage on a different computer. # Music files have to be \\"wrapped\\" by Sony software in order to be played on a Sony music player. Sony has not introduced drag and drop support for music files. Although it is possible to load files directly onto a Sony player without using SonicStage, it is not possible to play music files loaded this way. Neither is it possible in most cases to transfer music files back to a PC. (all versions prior to 3.4) # The program does not generally convert OMG/OMA files to MP3 or WAV. # The program only supports OMG format, not MP3. The program converts any audio files imported into it into OMG format, including audio files that are not legally downloaded, or illegally copied music. # The program lacks a true import album feature for WAV and MP3 files. The program imports tracks as is. MP3 and WAV files can not generally be used. Imported files cannot be grouped into an album with artist, title and tracknumber fields assigned at the time of import. This has to be done before or after import. # When WAV tracks are imported, they remain linked to their WAV source file and the track can only be edited for as long as the WAV source file remains on the computer. This makes it difficult to use SonicStage to edit CDs that have been ripped with another program. As of version 3.4, an intermediate update mostly for Hi-MD users, some of the above restrictions have been relaxed. SonicStage 3.4 allows tracks recorded via digital/analogue inputs on Hi-MD devices to be transferred back in WAV format. Also, files in Sony's proprietary ATRAC format can now be converted to WAV. === MP3 support === Support for MP3 files in both SonicStage and 2005 model devices is problematic. A 2005 model device may not be able to play some tracks. For example, it may not be able to play low bit rate MP3 tracks, (the ones that may be produced by an Internet radio station, or in a podcast). SonicStage will play ATRAC3 files directly from a digital music device when the latter is connected to the computer and detected by the software. SonicStage 3 does not play DRM-wrapped MP3 files directly from the device. Many bugs, however, are corrected and addressed. == History  Version 1 === Version 1.5 adds the native support for ATRAC3plus and Windows Media Audio (WMA). And addition, MP3 encoding plug-in was sold on Sony's on- line stores (SonyStyle Japan: ¬•1,590), for their Palm device: CLI√â. But those encoding function for WMA/MP3 was removed in SonicStage Version 2.0 (SS2.0 supports only the decoding function). === Version 2 === This is the last version of SonicStage before native MP3 devices were introduced by Sony. MP3 is supported by converting the mp3 file to ATRAC format and downloading that file to the device. The v2 library manager is \\"benign\\" in that it sits on top of what is already on the hard drive, and doesn't change what is already there (It will change a file name if the user has configured it as such.) Users can tell it an album exists in a directory, and import that group of files as an album without having the program change the header information in the tracks. === Version 3 === Version 3 uses the header information in the tracks to get album, artist and track name information. The tracks are placed in the database according to what is in the tracks. When the header fields in a track are blank, the program imports the track into the unnamed album (No name, no artist, no album). As a consequence, when importing tracks, many albums are placed into the album called \\"Unnamed\\". Tracks under digital rights management cannot be changed, and neither can tracks with a missing source link. As noted above, Version 3 lacks an \\"Import Album\\" feature. SonicStage v3 classifies tracks according to the album-related information present in their headers. 2 GB memory sticks are not supported. Sony have added the option to drop DRM on ripped files in SonicStage v3.3. SonicStage 3.4 includes an option to de-DRM an entire library (the larger it is, the longer it takes) allowing unlimited transfer and playback on PCs. Users can share non-DRM files with other people. The option to de-DRM files does not work on unplayable OMA files. SonicStage 3.4 does operate on Windows Vista after some manual driver installations. === Version 4 (SonicStage CP) === Adds the ability to import AACLC, as well as HE- AAC. The main downside is that a number of features, such as the ability to recover from corrupt track lists, are still missing. Restrictions on what non administrator users could do were due to restrictions imposed by Windows XP and earlier. These restrictions are not present with Windows Vista and later. Version 4.3 (SonicStage CP) adds Windows Vista compatibility (Vista 64-bit and Windows 7 64-bit are not officially supported but Sonicstage will run, though there are no drivers for the hardware). As of October 2008, this is the latest version of the English (and other non-Japanese language) SonicStage. From March 29, 2013 onwards this version is no longer available for download from Sony website.http://www.sony-asia.com/support/announcement/524893 Version 4.4, released on January 10, 2008 (only in Japan), added HE-AAC transfer function for new walkmans. === Version 5 (SonicStage V) === SonicStage V is the latest version of the Japanese SonicStage, and features a new user interface like SonicStage for LISMO. Version 5.0 released on October 9, 2008 in Japan. On 9 Feb 2009, version 5.1 was released. SonicStage V does not work with the Hi- MD/Net MD Walkmans, MP3-CD/ATRAC-CD players (such as CD Walkmans) and other old devices. == SonicStage for LISMO == SonicStage for LISMO is a stripped- down version of Japanese SonicStage CP, and is a part of the \\"LISMO Port\\" suite. Version 1.0 was released on February 1, 2008. SonicStage for LISMO developed for a new ATRAC service () of LISMO, the online music store provided by a Japanese mobile phone operator KDDI (au). There are some useful functions to using LISMO, but little value for non-LISMO users. The playable codecs are same as SonicStage Version 4.x, but encoding functions are only available for the ATRAC codecs. As of October 2008, 16 au phones (manufactured by Casio Hitachi Mobile Communications, Kyocera, Sanyo, Sharp, Sony Ericsson and Toshiba) support LISMO's ATRAC service. ==Criticism== SonicStage was often criticized for being un-user friendly and having numerous technical problems.https://www.theregister.com/2006/05/10/sony_plans_sonicstage_update/https://www.techradar.com/nz/news/portable- devices/mp3-players/audio/portable-audio/sony-sets-walkman-free-at- last-158767https://www.theatreofnoise.com/2005/10/review-of-sony-mz-rh10-md- recorder.htmlhttps://www.cnet.com/reviews/sony-nw-s200-review/ It is only possible to move tracks from the music player to the PC's hard drive, and thereby from one music player to another, if each device/computer is \\"authorized\\" to the user's account with the Connect Store for their country. Users from countries that do not have the Connect Store service are currently limited to one device/computer. In late 2005 Sony released the Connect Player software for use with their Walkman NW-A series released at the time. That too proved to be problematic to users, forcing Sony to apologize in January 2006 and temporary pulling the software.https://www.theregister.com/2006/01/30/sony_connect_player_problems/ At IFA 2007, Sony finally announced that SonicStage software will be dropped for all future Walkman. Music management is instead done using drag and drop, the Media Manager of PlayStation Portable, or Windows Media Player 11.https://www.techradar.com/nz/news/portable- devices/mp3-players/audio/portable-audio/sony-sets-walkman-free-at-last-158767 == Alternatives  MP3 File Manager === Sony offers the MP3 File Manager for Network Walkmans as a very limited alternative to SonicStage. It only provides a simple drag-and-drop interface and is lacking many of the newer, more advanced features of SonicStage (such as the ability to transfer files back to the computer). The application is intended to be installed on the Network Walkman itself. Although it can be run directly on the device, it is not truly a portable application because it requires that the driver be installed on the computer. The most recent version (2.0) can be downloaded from here or here. There is also an older version (1.2) for older Network Walkmans available here. === VAIO Music Transfer === As mentioned in this forum, the VAIO Music Transfer software allows files to be dragged and dropped onto the player. It may still require SonicStage to be installed. It works with the NW-A700-series, NW-E00XF-series players as well as the NW-HD1 and NW- HD3. ===MP3 Conversion Tool=== Sony released an MP3 Conversion Tool in 2007. The MP3 Conversion Tool can be used to convert non-DRM protected ATRAC¬Æ format audio files stored in your computer to MP3 format audio files. To run the MP3 Conversion Tool, the OpenMG Secure Module is required (included with SonicStage). The tool can be downloaded from Sony's eSupport page, here. === Third-party alternatives === * voidMP3FM file manager is free, and supports some features that the official MP3FM does not (e.g. ability to transfer files back to the computer). voidMP3FM currently works with NW-E002, NW-E003, NW-E005, NW-A608, and (unofficially) NW-E015F, allows transfer of tracks back to HD, and the compatibility is improved in each version (last release was 6 October 2006). It also works under WINE in Linux.http://www.atraclife.com/forums/index.php?showforum=25 * JSymphonic is a piece of open-source Java software that works on Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X and can transfer MP3s to and from the Sony NW-E00x series and HDD NW-A series players. It is also a continuation of the NW-E00x Mp3 File Manager project. * Grab Your Music (GYM) software allows to transfer (upload) audio files back to the computer from the Walkman. * ML Sony is a plugin for the popular multimedia player Winamp. It integrates with Winamp's Library and allows the user to transfer MP3s between the PC and the Sony Walkman. It does not require SonicStage to be installed. The official discussion thread about it seems to be offline.http://www.atraclife.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=1528 === MiniDisc === For MiniDisc Walkman, the linux-minidisc project is working continuously to develop a free transfer software for all HiMD- and NetMD-Walkman. The software features a library libhimd for accessing HiMD-devices and a Qt-based GUI (QHiMDTransfer) which both can be ported to many platforms, current versions are available for Linux, Windows and Macintosh computers. Currently, upload (i.e. transfer from the Walkman to the PC) of MP3s and PCM/ATRAC3/ATRAC3+-recordings (all HiMD Walkman) is possible, more functionality (downloads to the device, deleting, renaming tracks etc.) is being worked on. NetMD is supported as well (through a collection of Python scripts) in the form of downloads (all NetMD) and uploads (MZ-RH1 only). Especially the sophisticated debugging and reverse-engineering protection of OpenMG/AVLib made development tedious but linux-minidisc is the only software to provide this functionality to date. The project homepage can be found here. == See also == * OpenMG * ATRAC * Hi-MD * Media Go * mora * Connect Player == References  External links == * Sony * Archived versions of SonicStage on Internet Archive Category:Windows media players Category:Sony software ","title":"SonicStage"},{"id":"2226160","text":"Baron Paul Kray of Krajova and Topolya (; ; 5 February 1735 - 19 January 1804), was a soldier, and general in Habsburg service during the Seven Years' War, the War of Bavarian Succession, the Austro‚ÄìTurkish War (1787‚Äì1791), and the French Revolutionary Wars. He was born in K√©sm√°rk, Upper Hungary (today: Ke≈æmarok, Slovakia). He withdrew from military service temporarily in 1792 because of poor health, but in 1793, he was recalled to the Habsburg military in the Netherlands at the request of Field Marshal Prince Coburg and fought in the Flanders Campaign. In 1799 he was appointed commander of the Austrian forces in Italy and Colonel-Proprietor of the Infantry Regiment N.34, a ceremonial position he held until his death. On 18 April 1799, Kray was promoted to Feldzeugmeister. In the 1800 campaign, Kray commanded the Austrian force on the Upper Rhine, charged with the defense of all approaches to Vienna through the German states. After being out-maneuvered by the French, he was disastrously defeated in five consecutive battles. After the Battle of Neuburg, the French acquired both shores of the river, and commanded access to the Danube waterway as far east as Regensburg. During the subsequent armistice, Emperor Francis II replaced Kray with his brother, Archduke John; Kray was discharged on 28 August 1800 and retired to Pest, Hungary. He died there on 19 January 1804. For all his victories, for his fierce competitiveness on the battlefield, the French soldiers referred to him as Le terrible Kray, le fils cher de la victoire and men from both sides attended his funeral in 1804. ==Biography Early career === Kray was born in K√©sm√°rk, Upper Hungary (today: Ke≈æmarok, Slovakia). He was educated in mathematical and other military sciences in Schemnitz and Vienna.Smith, Digby. Paul Kray. Napoleon Series Research Biographies, Compiled by Leopold Kudrna. Entering the Austrian army at the age of nineteen in 1754 in the Infantry Regiment 31 \\"Hallerstein\\" and fought in the Seven Years' War. In 1778, he was promoted from grenadier captain to major and transferred to Infantry Regiment \\"Preysach\\" 39. After the War of Bavarian Succession, he transferred to the 2nd Szeckler Grenz (border) Infantry Regiment as lieutenant colonel. In 1784 he suppressed a Romanian peasants' uprising in Transylvania. Kray served in the Turkish wars of 1787-91. On 10 May 1788, he defeated a superior Turkish force of 5,000 men commanded by Osman Pazvantoƒülu and Kara Mustapha Pasha on the borders of Transylvania. He later led the capture of the Krajova fortress; for this, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa on 21 December 1789, in May of the following year, Kray was promoted Generalmajor and subsequently ennobled by Emperor Joseph II with the title of Freiherr \\"von Krajow und Topolya\\".Smith, Paul Kray. In the Austro-Turkish War of 1787 to 1791 he saw active service at Porczeny and the Vulcan Pass. === War of the First Coalition === Promoted Major General in 1790, three years later Kray commanded the advance guard of the Allies under Prince Coburg, operating in Flanders and the Austrian Netherlands. He distinguished himself at Famars, Menin, Wissembourg, Charleroi, Fleurus, and, indeed, at almost every encounter in the Flanders Campaign with the armies of the French Republic. Promoted to Feldmarschalleutnant on 5 March 1796 Kray served in Archduke Charles's Army of the Lower Rhine. On 19 June, after the Battle of Wetzlar, he forced General Jean-Baptiste Kl√©ber to withdraw from Uckerath. He also defeated French General of Division Jourdan in the clash at Limburg on 16 September. He then fought in various actions, including the victory at Amberg on 24 August, and at the Battle of W√ºrzburg as a divisional commander, when he was largely responsible for the victory of Archduke Charles of Austria.Smith, Paul Kray. On 19 September, he captured the mortally wounded General of Division Fran√ßois S√©verin Marceau-Desgraviers, one of the ablest and bravest French commanders of the day; he returned the corpse to French lines with a guard of honor of the Bethlen Hussars N.35. On 4 March 1796 he received promotion to Lieutenant General (Feldmarschal-Leutnant). In the celebrated campaign of 1796, on the Rhine and Danube, he performed conspicuous service as a corps commander. In the following year, he was less successful, being defeated on the Lahn, and at Mainz. Worse, his command was surprised and defeated by the French General Louis-Lazarre Hoche in the Battle of Neuwied of 1797. Kray was accused of negligence; a courts-martial found him guilty and sentenced him to two weeks arrest. He requested to resign in protest but this was denied.Smith, Paul Kray. === War of the Second Coalition === Kray commanded in Italy in 1799, and reconquered the plain of Lombardy from the French. He won a sharp action at Legnago on 26 March. For his victory over the French at the Battle of Magnano on 5 April, he was promoted Feldzeugmeister (artillery lieutenant general). This victory caused the French army to withdraw to the Adda River. Nevertheless, Kray was replaced when Michael von Melas arrived to take command of the Austrian forces. While the field army won two more major battles, Kray conducted the successful sieges of Peschiera del Garda and Mantua. At the Battle of Novi, he commanded the divisions of Peter Ott and Heinrich Bellegarde.Smith, p 163 On 6 November, he was defeated by the French in a second clash at Novi Ligure.Smith, p 173 The following year he commanded on the Rhine against Jean Moreau. As a consequence of his defeats at the battles of Stockach, Messkirch, Biberach, Iller River, and H√∂chst√§dt, Kray was driven into Ulm. However, by a skillful march round Moreau's flank he succeeded in escaping to Bohemia. After a 15 July truce became effective he was relieved of his command by Emperor Francis II and dismissed from the service. Kray's successor, Archduke John of Austria was disastrously defeated at the Battle of Hohenlinden in December.Smith, Paul Kray. Kray died in Pest, Hungary on 19 January 1804.Smith, Paul Kray. ==Commentary== Kray was one of the best representatives of the old Austrian army. Tied to an obsolete system, and unable, from habit, to realize the changed conditions of warfare, he failed, but his enemies held him in the highest respect as a brave, skillful, and chivalrous opponent. It was he who, at Altenkirchen, cared for the dying Marceau (1796), and the white uniforms of Kray and his staff mingled with the blue of the French in the funeral procession of the young general of the Republic. ==References Sources == * Arnold, James R.

The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education is responsible for implementing policy for primary education and state-funded schools at a local level. In Bangladesh, all citizens must undertake twelve years of compulsory education which consists of eight years at primary school level and four years at high school level. Primary and secondary education is financed by the state and free of charge in public schools.

General Economics Division (GED), Bangladesh Planning Commission. plancomm.gov.bd. as well as other education- related international declarations. Article 17 of the Bangladesh Constitution provides that all children receive free and compulsory education. ==Education system== A Bangladesh education system chart The main education system is divided into three levels: * Primary level (class 1‚Äì8) * Secondary level (9-12): There is no middle school system in Bangladesh. * Tertiary level At all levels of schooling, students can choose to receive their education in English or Bangla. Private schools tend to make use of English-based study media while government-sponsored schools use Bangla. Cadets in a classroom Cadet Colleges are important in the education system of Bangladesh. A cadet college is a room and board collegiate administered by the Bangladesh Military. Discipline is compulsory at all cadet colleges. Faujdarhat Cadet College is the first cadet college in Bangladesh, established in 1958 over an area of at Faujdarhat in the district of Chittagong. At present there are 12 cadet colleges in Bangladesh, including three for girls. As of September 2019, tertiary education in Bangladesh takes place at 44 government, 101 private and 3 international universities. Students can choose to further their studies in chartered accountancy, engineering, technology, agriculture and medicine at a variety of universities and colleges.

While MOPME is involved in formulation of policies, the responsibility of implementation rests with the Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) headed by a Director General. The Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) and its subordinate offices in the district and upazila are solely responsible for management and supervision of primary education. Their responsibilities include recruitment, posting, and transfer of teachers and other staff; arranging in-service training of teachers; distribution of free textbooks; and supervision of schools. The responsibility of school construction, repair and supply of school furniture lies with the DPE executed through the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED). The National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) is responsible for the development of curriculum and production of textbooks. While the Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for formulation of policies, the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) under the Ministry of Education is responsible for implementing the same at secondary and higher education levels. The NCTB is responsible for developing curriculum and publishing standard textbooks. The Directorate of Primary Education (DPE) are responsible for conducting the two public examinations: * Primary Education Certificate (PEC) (5 grade) * Junior School Certificate (JSC) (8th grade) ===Secondary education=== The secondary level of education is controlled by the nine General Education boards: * Barisal Education Board for Barisal Division * Chittagong Education Board for Chittagong Division * Comilla Education Board for Comilla Division * Dhaka Education Board for Dhaka Division * Dinajpur Education Board for Rangpur Division * Jessore Education Board for Khulna Division * Mymensingh Education Board for Mymensingh Division * Rajshahi Education Board for Rajshahi Division * Sylhet Education Board for Sylhet Division The boards' headquarters are located in Barishal, Comilla Chittagong, Dhaka, Dinajpur Jessore, Mymensingh, Rajshahi and Sylhet. Eight region-based Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) are responsible for conducting the two public examinations: * Secondary School Certificate (SSC) (10th grade) * Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) (12th grade) At the school level, in the case of non- government secondary schools, School Management Committees (SMC), and at the intermediate college level, in the case of non-government colleges, Governing Bodies (GB), formed as per government directives, are responsible for mobilizing resources, approving budgets, controlling expenditures, and appointing and disciplining staff. While teachers of non-government secondary schools are recruited by concerned SMCs observing relevant government rules, teachers of government secondary schools are recruited centrally by the DSHE through a competitive examination. In government secondary schools, there is not an SMC. The headmaster is solely responsible for running the school and is supervised by the deputy director of the respective zone. Parent Teachers Associations (PTAs), however, exist to ensure a better teaching and learning environment. After a lot of thinking and considerations, the authority concerned has taken the decision of not arranging a Higher Secondary Certificate or equivalent exam for the year 2020. The process is now being mentioned as ‚ÄòAuto Pass‚Äô which means all of the examinees will be automatically declared passed regardless of their earlier status during college life in terms of result and others. ===Tertiary education=== Curzon Hall, University Of Dhaka Library entrance, University of Rajshahi Front view of North South University Entrance of Islamic University of Technology Civil Engineering Building of BUET At the tertiary level, universities are regulated by the University Grants Commission. The colleges providing tertiary education are under the National University. Each of the medical colleges is affiliated with a public university. Universities in Bangladesh are autonomous bodies administered by statutory bodies such as Syndicate, Senate, Academic Council, etc. in accordance with provisions laid down in their respective acts. ===Technical and vocational education=== The Technical and Vocational Education System provides courses related to various applied and practical areas of science, technology and engineering, or focuses on a specific specialized area. Course duration ranges from one month to four years. The Technical Education Board controls technical and vocational training in the secondary level. The Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) is responsible for the planning, development, and implementation of technical and vocational education in the country. Curriculum is implemented by BTEB. In the Technical Education System, after obtaining a Diploma-in-Engineering degree (four-year curriculum) from the institutes listed below, students can further pursue their educational career by obtaining a bachelor's degree from Engineering & Technology Universities. It normally it takes an additional two and a half to three years of coursework to obtain a bachelor's degree, although some students take more than three years to do so. They can then enroll in post- graduate studies. Students can also study CA (Chartered Accounting) after passing HSC or bachelor's degree and subject to fulfilling the entry criteria of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Bangladesh (ICAB). *Barisal Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì one of the largest polytechnic institutes in Bangladesh *BCMC College of Engineering & Technology ‚Äì ISO certified and the largest private engineering college in Bangladesh, situated in Jessore *Bogra Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì one of the largest polytechnic institutes in Bangladesh *Comilla Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì founded in 1962, one of the largest and well-reputed government polytechnic institutes *Chittagong Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì provides theoretical and practical education of basic Engineering and technology *Dhaka Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì a government technical institute in Dhaka *Feni Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì created on 29 February 1964, has around 2,000 students *Graphic Arts Institute ‚Äì the only government printing and graphic design institute in Bangladesh *Jessore Polytechnic Institute *Khulna Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì a government technical institute in Khulna *Kushtia Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì largest polytechnic institute in Bangladesh *Mangrove Institute of Science and Technology ‚Äì a non- government technical institute in Khulna *Mymensingh Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì established in 1963 by the Ford Foundation *Patuakhali Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì one of the largest polytechnic institutes in Bangladesh *Rajshahi Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì a government technical institute in Rajshahi *Sylhet Polytechnic Institute ‚Äì a state-supported technical academic institute, established in 1955 by the Pakistani Government ==Alternative education systemEnglish- medium schools=== English-medium schools are mainly private schools where all the courses are taught in English except one Bengali Language subject at ordinary level (O Level). These schools in Bangladesh follow the General Certificate of Examination (GCE) syllabus where students are prepared for taking their Ordinary Level (O Level) and Advanced Level (A Level) examinations. The General Certificate of Education system is one of the most internationally recognized qualifications, based in the United Kingdom. The Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations are English equivalent to the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) examinations respectively. Most students sit for these exams from the registered schools in Bangladesh who follow the GCE syllabus. Those who do not attend a school that follows the GCE syllabus may also sit for their Ordinary and Advanced Level examinations from the British Council. These examinations are conducted under the supervision of the British Council in Bangladesh. The GCE examination conducted by the British Council takes place twice a year. Currently there are two boards operating from Bangladesh for Ordinary and Advanced Level Examinations, which are Edexcel and University of Cambridge International Examinations. Bangladesh has recently opened English version schools translating board textbooks into English. In recent years national language policy has given top priority to English language education in Bangladesh https://rdcu.be/bFJXM ===Madrasah education=== The Madrasah Education System focuses on religious education, teaching all the basics of education in a religious environment. Religious studies are taught in Arabic and the students in some areas also serve the local area masjids. Students also have to complete all the courses from the General Education System. Many privately licensed Madrasas take in homeless children and provide them with food, shelter and education, e.g. Jamia Tawakkulia Renga Madrasah in Sylhet. In the Madrasah Education System there are two systems: One, called the \\"Quomi\\" Madrasah system is privately owned and funded and is run according to the Deobandi system of Islamic education, which rejects the rational sciences. The other, called the \\"Alia\\" madrasah system, is privately owned but subsidised by the government (the government spends 11.5% of its education budget on alia madrasahs, paying 80% of teacher and administrator salaries). Quomi madrasahs account for 1.9% of total primary enrollment and 2.2% of secondary enrollment; aliyah madrasahs account for 8.4% of primary and 19% of secondary enrollment. The alia system is like the general education system, except that Arabic is taught in addition to general education. The Madrasah Education Board covers religious education in government-registered Madrasahs in the secondary level. After passing \\"Alim\\", a student can enroll for three additional years to obtain a \\"Fazil\\" level. Students can go for further general education and earn a university degree. After passing successfully, they can further enroll for another two years to obtain a \\"Kamil\\" level degree. The following table provides a statistical comparison of the \\"Quomi\\" and \\"Alia\\" madrasah systems. {  style=\\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\\" !

UNICEF runs approximately 1,600 learning centers across the country, educating around 145,000 children. Beginning in April 2020, UNICEF and the Government of Bangladesh were scheduled to enroll 10,000 Rohingya children in schools where they will be taught the Myanmar school curriculum. ==Grading system== In Bangladesh, grades equal or above 33% (or one third) is considered as a passing grade. Although by no means it is considered as a good grade. Since the education system of Bangladesh is completely controlled by the government up to higher secondary level (or grade 12), the grading system up to this point is more or less the same. For each subject, grades are converted into 'grade points (GP)' and are summed up and divided by the total number of subjects, and thus is called 'grade point average (GPA)'. The highest achievable GPA is 5.0. There is also a 'letter grade (LG)' that indicates a range of GPA for total result, or a single GP for a single subject. The grading system is shown below. {  style=\\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align:center;\\" + Letter grade system of individual subjecthttp://www.educationboard.gov.bd/grads.htm !Class interval !Grade point !Letter grade - 100-80 5 A+ - 79 -70 4 A - 69 - 60 3.5 A- - 59 - 50 3 B - 49 -40 2 C - 39 - 33 1 D - 32 - 0 0 F } However, in secondary and higher secondary Level, a fourth subject or optional subject system is introduced. Although failing in the fourth subject will not be judged as a failure for the whole, Doing good in it can contribute to gain additional grade points. The additional grade points received is simply (GP in 4th subject) - 2. While counting GPA the algorithm can be simply written as: GPA = \\\\tfrac{TGP+OGP}{N} Here, TGP is the total Grade EPoints gained in subjects other than optional. OGP is the additional GP gained in 4th subject. N is the number of total subjects of course without optional. Note that GPA cannot be above 5. Additional GP gained from the optional subject will not be counted if the GP of the subject is less than or equal to 2. Gaining a GPA of 5.0 or A+ is naturally considered as a good result. However, since a student can gain grade far above the required 80% to receive a GPA of 5.0, the actual grades received in each subject is also included in the official mark sheets given by the education board for PSC, SSC and HSC exams. There is also an unofficial term called Golden A+ which means receiving A+ in all subjects, since a student can receive a perfect GPA also without gaining more than 80% marks in all subjects thanks to the fourth subject system. ==Non-formal education== There exists a substantial number of NGO-run non-formal schools, catering mainly to the drop-outs of the government and non-government primary schools. Very few NGOs, however, impart education for the full five-year primary education cycle. Because of this, on completion of their two-to-three-year non-formal primary education in NGO-run schools, students normally re-enter into government/non-government primary schools at higher classes. There are Non-Governmental Schools (NGO) and Non-Formal Education Centers (NFE) and many of these are funded by the government. The largest NFE program is the much reputed BRAC program. However, not all NFE graduates continue on to secondary school. NGO-run schools differ from other non-government private schools. While the private schools operate like private enterprises often guided by commercial interests, NGO schools operate mainly in areas not served either by the government or private schools, essentially to meet the educational needs of vulnerable groups in the society. They usually follow an informal approach to suit the special needs of children from these vulnerable groups. But nowadays, some NGO schools are operating into places where there are both private and government schools. Similarly, in NGO- run schools there does not exist any SMC. The style of management differs depending upon differences in policies pursued by different NGOs. Some are centrally managed within a highly bureaucratic set-up, while others enjoy considerable autonomy. Different NGOs pursue different policies regarding recruitment of teachers. Some prepare a panel of prospective teachers on the basis of a rigorous test and recruit teachers from this panel. Other NGOs recruit teachers rather informally from locally available interested persons. ==Current issues== Girls studying at the Unique Child Learning Center in Mirpur-Dhaka Current government projects to promote the education of children in Bangladesh include compulsory primary education for all, free education for girls up to grade 10, stipends for female students, a nationwide integrated education system and a food-for-education literacy movement. A large section of the country's national budget is set aside to help put these programs into action and to promote education and make it more accessible. Recent years have seen these efforts pay off and the Bangladesh education system is strides ahead of what it was only a few years ago. Now even national curriculum books from class 5 to class 12 are distributed freely among all students and schools. The educational system of Bangladesh faces several problems. In the past, Bangladesh education was primarily a British modelled upper class affair with all courses given in English and very little being done for the common people. The Bangladesh education board has taken steps to leave such practices in the past and is looking forward to education as a way to provide a poverty- stricken nation with a brighter future. As Bangladesh is an overpopulated country, there is a huge demand to turn its population into labour, which is why proper education is needed and proper help from government in the educational sectors of Bangladesh is crucial. ===Education expenditure as percentage of GDP=== Public expenditure on education lies on the fringes of 2 percent of GDP with a minimum of 0.94 percent in 1980 and a maximum of 2.2 percent in 2007.Education Spending, Bangladesh, at theglobaleconomy.com Accessed 26 April 2017 ===Qualitative dimension=== The education system lacks a sound Human Resource Development and deployment system,Sedere, Upali M. (2000). \\"Institutional Capacity Building Through Human Resource Development\\". Directorate of Primary Education/PEDPQI Project of NORAD, Bangladesh. and this has demoralised the primary education sector personnel, including teachers, and contributes to poor performance. Poverty is a big threat to primary education. In Bangladesh, the population is very high. The number of seats available in colleges is less than the number of students who want to enroll, and the number of seats available in universities is also less than the number of students who passed higher secondary level and want to join in a university. The cost of education is increasing day by day, and as a result many students are unable to afford it. One study found a 15.5% primary school teacher absence rate. ===Gender disparity=== In Bangladesh, gender discrimination in education occurs amongst the rural households but is non- existent amongst rich households. Bangladesh has achieved gender parity in Primary and Secondary education with significant progress made in higher education Abu S. SHONCHOY* and Mehnaz RABBANI: The Bangladesh Gender Gap in Education: Biased Intra-household Educational Expenditures, at ide.go.jp Accessed 26 April 2017 There is great difference in the success rates of boys, as compared to girls in Bangladesh. Girls do much better and outperform boys in almost every field of Education. However, in recent years some progress has been made in trying to fix this problem.Niels-Hugo Blunch, Maitreyi Bordia Das: Changing norms about gender inequality in education: Evidence from Bangladesh Accessed 1 May 2017 ===School attendance=== The low performance in primary education is also matter of concern. School drop-out rates and grade repetition rates are high. Poor school attendance and low contact time in school are factors contributing to low level of learning achievement. ===Religion and education=== Madrasah education in Bangladesh is heavily influenced by religion. ==Literacy rate== Recently the literacy rate of Bangladesh has improved as it stands at 71% due to the modernization of schools and education funds. ==See also== *Light of Hope *List of colleges and universities in Brahmanbaria *List of medical colleges in Bangladesh *List of schools in Bangladesh ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * *Sedere, Upali M.

It is the administrative center of the Zbarazh Raion (district), and is located in the historic region of Galicia. Zbarazh is one of the settings of Henryk Sienkiewicz's novel With Fire and Sword (1884) in which he gives a detailed description of the famous Siege of Zbarazh. Notable Jewish residents included rabbi Zev Wolf, the singer Velvel Zbarjer and the author Ida Fink. ==History== First attested in 1211 as a strong Ruthenian fortress, Zbarazh became a seat of the Gediminid princes Zbaraski towards the end of the 14th century. Ruins of the original castle are extant in the vicinity of modern Zbarazh. Following the 1569 Union of Lublin, Zbarazh became part of Kingdom of Poland's Krzemieniec County and Volhynian Voivodeship. After the first partition of Poland (1772), the town was seized by the Habsburg Monarchy, and remained in the province of Galicia until 1918. In the immediate post-World War I period, a Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War took place in Eastern Galicia. After the conflict, Zbarazh returned to Poland, becoming the seat of a county in Tarnopol Voivodeship. In the interbellum Second Polish Republic, it had the population of 8,000, with Jewish, Polish and Ukrainian communities. Zbarazh was occupied by the Germans on July 4, 1941, but before the occupation authority was in place, Ukrainian nationalists instigated a pogrom that murdered twenty Jews and burned two synagogues. Soviet prisoners of war were also killed. By the time of the German invasion, the Jewish population of around 3000 had swelled to around 5000 because of refugees from western Poland. Later in 1941, the German security police murdered 70 Jews in the Lubianka Forest. In 1942, around 3000 Jews were sent from Zbaraz to the Belzec killing camp on four occasions, sometimes by way of Tarnopol. In October, some Jews were sent to the Janowska Street camp in Lwow and others were killed in Zbarazh. After that, the Germans established a ghetto for the 2000 Jews from Zbarazh and neighboring areas that had been sent to the town. About 20 people shared each room in the ghetto. In the expectation of further deportations, some Jews found hiding places. Nonetheless, in November, another 1000 Jews were sent to Belzec. During the winter of 1942-43, many Jews starved and died from disease. Others were sent to slave labor camps. In April 1943, another 1000 Jews were murdered near the Zbarazh railway station, and in June, German and Ukrainian police shot the remaining few hundred Jews. After that, Germans and Ukrainians hunted down Jews who were hidden in the forests. Only about 60 Zbarazh Jews of the 3000 who had lived in the town before the war survived. After World War II, the town was annexed by the Soviet Union. Local Poles were ordered to move to the Recovered Territories, and Soviet authorities began a process of devastation. Now Zbarazh is part of Ukraine. ==Points of interest== Throughout the centuries, Zbarazh was the capital of the properties of the Zbaraski family. After the line had ended, the town was transferred to the Wi≈õniowiecki family. It also belonged to the Potocki family. The new Zbarazh Castle was designed for Prince Jeremi Wi≈õniowiecki in a post-Palladian Italian idiom similar to Scamozzi's by the Dutch architect van Peyen in 1626-31\\\\. The castle was partly rebuilt in the 18th century. A palace constructed for the family is located in the nearby town of Vyshnivets. Zbarazh also preserves several remarkable churches, notably the Saviour Church (1600) and the Bernardine Monastery (1627). The Zbarazh Fortress was twice besieged by the Crimean Tatars (1474, 1589). After the second siege, a new castle was completed in 1626. In 1649, during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, the castle was besieged by the Cossacks and their Tatar allies. Defended for 43 days by Polish troops under Jeremi Wi≈õniowiecki (10 July‚Äì22 August), it was not captured. The local Roman Catholic church was funded in the mid-17th century by Janusz Wisniowiecki. Destroyed by the Ottoman Turks in 1675, it was rebuilt in 1755, together with a new monastery. In the main nave of the church there was a commemorative plaque in memory of the 100th birth anniversary of Adam Mickiewicz. In the interbellum period, Bernardine monks from Zbaraz operated a middle school here. Neither the church and monastery were destroyed during World War II.

The city has a population of 500,000 (2016 census) and is the capital of U≈üak Province. The city was previously known by its Greek name of Ousakeion/ŒüœÖœÉŒ¨Œ∫ŒµŒπŒøŒΩ. U≈üak city is situated at a distance of from ƒ∞zmir, the region's principal metropolitan center and port city. Benefiting from its location at the crossroads of the Central Anatolian plateau and the coastal Aegean Region, and from a climate and agricultural production incorporating elements of both of these zones, U≈üak has also traditionally had a strong industrial base. U≈üak was the first city in Turkey to have an urban electricity network, and the first city where a collective labor relations agreement was signed, during the Ottoman era, between leather industry employees and workers. It was here that the first factory of Republican Turkey, a sugar refinery, was set up through a private sector initiative among local businessmen. The tradition of industriousness continues today around two industrial zones. ==History== Ancient church of Sebaste, at Selcikler (Usak) The first known organized states to have ruled over the region of present-day U≈üak were the Phrygians in the eastern portion and the Lydians in the west during the seventh century BC. The Karun Treasure, discovered by clandestine treasure hunters in U≈üak in 1965, and whose smuggling outside Turkey and subsequent retrieval decades later from New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art made international headlines, gives an indication of the high degree of civilization attained by these Anatolian states. The region of Lydia was later taken over by the Persian Empire in the 6th century BC and by Alexander the Great and his successors as of the 4th century. Thereafter, U≈üak was ruled successively by the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the Germiyanids and finally the Ottoman Empire (as of 1429). Throughout classical times, until the Byzantine period, the city was called Ousakeion (ŒüœÖœÉŒ¨Œ∫ŒµŒπŒøŒΩ) in Greek. Later, following Turkish conquest and domination over the area, the city became known by its Turkish name of U≈ü≈üak; which could mean \\"lovers\\" and \\"minstrels\\" simultaneously. Tradition privileges the second derivation, which could be a reference to the region's rich folk literature. U≈üak was occupied by the Greek army between 28 August 1920 and 1 September 1922. During the Greek retreat, Greek general Nikolaos Trikoupis was captured near U≈üak at the village of G√∂ƒüem, today buried under a dam reservoir. U≈üak was a district center within K√ºtahya Province until 1953, when U≈üak Province was constituted and U≈üak became its provincial capital. ==Economic history== At least since the 17th century there was trade between U≈üak and the Dutch republic as reflected in the rug shown thrown over the bannister in Vermeer's painting \\"The Procuress.\\" The rug was probably produced in U≈üak, covers a third of the painting and shows medaillons and leaves.Onno Ydema (1991) Carpets and their Datings in Netherlandish Paintings, 1540 - 1700, p. 43, 44, 145. The kelim rug shown in Vermeer's 1656 painting The Procuress was identified as probably originating in U≈üak,Onno Ydema (1991) Carpets and their Datings in Netherlandish Paintings, 1540 - 1700, p. 43, 44, 145. testifying to 17th Century trade linking the city with the Dutch Republic. In the early 20th century, mercury was discovered in U≈üak. The town also manufactured carpet. Among other district centers in U≈üak Province, Banaz is the largest and is notable for its varied agricultural production as well as for its forests, while Ulubey's canyon is a natural site attracting many visitors. ==Climate== U≈üak has a hot summer mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Dsa) with continental influences, with cold, wet and regularly snowy winters and hot, long and dry summers. ==U≈üak carpets== In pre-industrial times, U≈üak was already a major center of production and export, particularly of Ushak carpets. Ushak carpets are also called Holbein carpets in reference to the 16th century painter Hans Holbein the Younger who depicted them in minute detail in his paintings, reflecting their popularity in European markets. The level of international popularity attained by U≈üak's carpets became such that the word \\"Ushak\\" is considered an English word of Turkic origin.Merriam- Webster Unabridged - Ushak A heavy woolen oriental rug tied in Ghiordes knots and characterized by bright primary colors and an elaborate medallion pattern. Although U≈üak's carpet patterns have evolved since then, large-scale weaving still continues and the name of the city still has an important presence in the market for carpets, both hand-woven and industrial. On the other hand, the district of E≈üme, which is also in U≈üak Province, is famous for its kilims. ==Twin cities== * Offenbach - Germany * Nur-Sultan - Kazakhstan * Besni - Turkey * Charleroi - Belgium ==See also== * Ushak carpet * Karun Treasure * U≈üak Museum of Archaeology ==References== Category:Populated places in U≈üak Province Category:Cities in Turkey Category:Districts of U≈üak Province Category:Landforms of U≈üak Province ","title":"U≈üak"},{"id":"2226177","text":"Madeline Cheek Hunter (1916‚Äì1994) was an American educator who developed a model for teaching and learning that was widely adopted by schools during the last quarter of the 20th century. She was named one of the hundred most influential women of the 20th century and one of the ten most influential in education by the Sierra Research Institute and the National Women's Hall of Fame. == Life == Hunter's family originally lived in Canada where she was born. Her father was an avid hunter who liked Canada because \\"the duck hunting was better there.\\" As Hunter was a \\"sickly\\" child, the family ultimately moved to California to avoid the harsh winters in Saskatchewan. Although they returned to Canada from May to October for many years, most of her schooling was in California. In junior high she was placed in an experimental school to test some of Stanford University's psychological theories on intelligence. They used her to score intelligence tests. As a result, she became interested in human intelligence; this along with classical ballet became her passions in life. As a 16-year-old she entered the University of California at Los Angeles as a combination pre-medicine and psychology major while continuing her ballet dancing. She had to choose either going to South America on tour with the Ballet Russe or finishing her degree in pre-medicine. She chose to finish her degree and then realized that she had limited hand eye coordination which would deny her the chance of becoming a neurological surgeon. Two additional events influenced her choice of a career in school psychology. The first occurred in seventh grade, while sitting in an auditorium waiting to be assigned a class. She felt hurt when she was labeled as dumb; these feelings were never forgotten. Because of this experience she felt the need to give positive reinforcement to students in schools--\\"Never put a kid down, always build the kid up.\\" A second influence occurred during her first work experiences at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles and at Juvenile Hall. During World War II she married an engineer, Robert Hunter, who worked at Lockheed Aviation until he retired. They had two children, a daughter and a son. In 1944 their first child, Cheryl, was born. She went on to become a film editor. In 1946 they had their second child, Robin, who became a school principal. After her children were on their own, she went back to working full-time as an educator. She held many positions, including school psychologist, principal, director of research, and assistant superintendent. She was given the opportunity to implement her educational model in a laboratory school setting. In Hunter's lifetime, she wrote 12 books, over 300 articles, and produced 17 videotape collections. According to the Graduate School of Education at U.C.L.A where she worked, Hunter died at the age of 78 in Los Angeles from a series of strokes. == Educational Beliefs == She believed that the foremost job of teachers was decision making, and that each teacher makes thousands of decisions each day. All of the decisions a teacher makes can be put into one of three categories: (1) content category - what you are going to teach; (2) teaching behavior category - what you as the teacher will do to facilitate and escalate that learning; and (3) learning behavior category - how the students are going to learn and how they will let you know that they've learned it. In response to a question asking her to assess the current educational situation in the 1990s, she said, \\"I believe the future of education is bright! We are beginning to unlock the mystery of the human brain and how it processes and learns. We, now, can enable teachers to use that knowledge to accelerate that learning process. No longer is teaching a 'laying on of hands.' It has become a profession that combines science with art to create a better and a more productive world for humankind.\\" (Source?) == Theories on Education == Madeline Hunter developed the Instructional Theory into Practice teaching model. It is a direct instruction program that was implemented in thousands of schools throughout the United States. Hunter identified seven components for teaching: # knowledge of human growth and development # content # classroom management # materials # planning # human relations # instructional skills Hunter also developed a direct instructional model and elements of effective instruction. The instructional model has seven components: # objectives # standards # anticipatory set # teaching (input, modeling, checking for understanding) # guided practice/monitoring # closure # independent practice The elements of effective instruction are very similar to those of the instructional model, featuring seven components of teaching and behavioral objectives: # objectives # set(hook) # standards/expectations # teaching (input, modeling/demo, direction giving, and checking for understanding) # guided practice # closure # independent practice Hunter was the creator of Instructional Theory into Practice (ITIP). ITIP is a teaching model on inservice/staff development program widely used during the 1970s and 1980s. Madeline Cheek Hunter. (n.d.). Biographies.

He is the author of a calligraphic rendering of the Greatest Name, used by Bah√° º√≠s around the world. == Background == thumb Mishk√≠n-Qalam was born in Sh√≠r√°z but was a resident of Isfah√°n, which is where he first heard of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. A few years later he travelled to Baghdad and learned in more detail from Zaynu'l-Muqarrab√≠n and Nab√≠l-i-A ªzam, but was not confirmed until he later travelled to Adrianople and met Bah√° ºu'll√°h. Before becoming a Bah√° º√≠, he was a S√∫f√≠ of the Ni'matu'll√°h√≠ order. He was also a skilled astronomer. == Imprisonment == Mishk√≠n-Qalam was sent by Bah√° ºu'll√°h to Constantinople (Istanbul), where he began attracting people through his art and vigorously teaching the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. The Persian ambassador began to complain to the Sultan's vazirs and soon had him arrested. When Bah√° ºu'll√°h was exiled to  ªAkk√°, Mishk√≠n-Qalam was exiled to Cyprus with the followers of Subh-i-Azal, where he remained a prisoner in Famagusta from 1868 to 1877. Cyprus eventually left Ottoman control and Mishk√≠n-Qalam was released. He made his way to  ªAkk√° in 1886, and remained there until Bah√° ºu'll√°h died in 1892, after which he travelled to Egypt, Damascus and India. He remained in India until 1905, and then returned to Haifa until his death in 1912. == Calligraphy == Mishk√≠n-Qalam was a renowned calligrapher.  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° called him a second M√≠r  ªIm√°d, a 16th-century calligrapher of the Safavid dynasty who is perhaps the most celebrated Persian calligrapher. Mishk√≠n-Qalam enjoyed a special position among the court ministers of Tihr√°n, and he became widely known for being adept at every calligraphic style. When E.G. Browne was in Persia, he was told that Mishk√≠n-Qalam's works :\\"would be eagerly sought after by Persians of all classes, were it not that they all bore, as the signature of the penman, the following verse: ::Lord of calligraphy, my banner goes before; ::But to Baha'u'llah, a bondsman at the door, ::Naught else I am, Mishk√≠n-Qalam. When visiting Bah√° ºu'll√°h in Adrianople, he would often write out the phrase Y√° Bah√° ºu'l-Abh√° (O Glory of the All-Glorious) in many different forms, some taking the form of a bird, and send them everywhere. One of his renderings of this phrase is now one of the three common symbols of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, known as the Greatest Name. == Gallery == File:Mishkin-Qalam-01.JPG File:Mishkin-Qalam-10.JPG File:Mishkin- Qalam-15.JPG File:Mishkin-Qalam-87.JPG File:Mishkin-Qalam-40.JPG File:Mishkin- Qalam-23.JPG File:Mishkin-Qalam-83.JPG File:Mishkin-Qalam-21.JPG == See also == *Persian calligraphy == Notes  References == * * * == External links == * ICOM: The Conservation and Restoration of a 19th-century Calligraphy of a Baha'i Writing in Arabic, by S.

He conducted the work at the opening of the Permanent Holocaust Exhibition at the Imperial War Museum with the strings of the Royal Academy of Music, and also in Sarajevo with the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra. As the sleeve-notes to the CD explain, the work was also dedicated to Stocken's maternal grandmother, Rosa Bechh√∂fer, who had died in Auschwitz. Stocken's First Symphony was commissioned by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Vernon Handley in the Royal Albert Hall, London and broadcast on Classic FM (UK).

It refers to dendrochronological research of wood from the past regardless of its current physical context (in or above the soil). This form of dating is the most accurate and precise absolute dating method available to archaeologists, as the last ring that grew is the first year the tree could have been incorporated into an archaeological structure.Feder K. Linking to the Past: A Brief Introduction to Archaeology. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press. 2008 Tree- ring dating is useful in that it can contribute to \\"chronometric\\", \\"environmental\\", and \\"behavioral\\" archaeological research.Nash S. E. Archaeological Tree-Ring Dating at the Millennium. Journal of Archaeological Research, Vol. 10, No. 3 (September 2002), pp. 243-275 The utility of tree- ring dating in an environmental sense is the most applicable of the three in today's world. Tree rings can be used to \\"reconstruct numerous environmental variables\\" such as \\"temperature\\", \\"precipitation\\", \\"stream flow\\", \\"drought society\\", \\"fire frequency and intensity\\", \\"insect infestation\\", \\"atmospheric circulation patterns\\", among others. ==History== Tree ring laboratory scientists from Columbia University were some of the first to apply tree-ring dating to the colonial period, specifically architectural timbers in the eastern United States. For agencies like the National Park Service and other historical societies, Dr. Jacoby and Cook began dating historic structures in the lower Hudson River Valley, New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania. This was difficult at the time due to a lack of sufficiently long master dating chronology and access to suitable structures. Not until 1998 was a Boston area master dating chronology developed. Today, the effectiveness of tree ring laboratory archaeological dating chronologies covers most of the area that was settled by the first European colonists. The numbers of these are in the hundreds and include historically significant structures such as Independence Hall and the Tuckahoe estate. ==Methodology== There are two types of dates that can be assigned to tree specimens: cutting dates, and noncutting dates. Which date is assigned to a specimen is dependent on whether or not there is evidence that the last ring present on the specimen was the last ring the tree grew before it died. Cutting dates can be used for crossdated tree specimens that \\"possess evidence that the last ring present on the specimen was the last ring grown by the tree before it died.\\" Noncutting dates are used for crossdated tree specimens \\"if there is no evidence indicating that the last ring present on the specimen is the last one grown before the tree died.\\" Patterns of tree growth will be similar between trees of the same species, growing in the same climate. These matching patterns align growth rings in different trees formed in the same year. Once aligned, knowing the precise calendar year of any individual tree-ring is the same as knowing the calendar year of all the rings. The goal of a dendroarchaeologist is to determine the year when the last ring was formed. Crossdating, the skill of finding matching ring-width patterns between tree-ring samples, is used to assign the precise calendar year to every ring. This is affected by the climate that the timber was in. It is also important to have enough rings to actually confirm a date. Once the rings are dates, the chronology is measured. The last step is to compare the rings with that of ring-width patterns in sampled timbers and a master dating chronology. For trees to be useful in archaeological analysis, they must \\"produce annual growth rings that are uniform around the tree stem\\", they must \\"live for decades and, preferably, centuries\\" and they \\"must have been used extensively by humans either for habitation or fuel.\\" One of the problems with this evaluation is that it is possible under certain conditions for a tree to miss a growth-ring or produce two growth rings in a season. During extreme drought there can be insufficient growth of xylem to form a noticeable ring. Alternatively, if a defoliating agent (e.g. drought, late frost, or insect damage) can arrest the growth of a tree early in a year, after which there is a secondary growth period of new foliage causing two rings to form. Another difficulty in the use of tree-ring dating as applied to archaeology is the variety and condition of wood used in construction of archaeological sites. Many such samples are encountered wet. Heartwood can normally retain much of its substance and can be dried out and polished for analysis. On the other hand, ancient wet sapwood samples seldom survive drying out. As a result, the sapwood should either be measured wet and then allowed to dry, or it should be frozen or kept wet. In North America, \\"millennial- length chronologies have been developed for two species of bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva in the Great Basin and Pinus aristata in the Rocky Mountains), bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), eastern cedar (Juniperus virginiana), juniper (Juniperus sp.), Larch (Larix sp.), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), limber pine (Pinus flexilis), mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) (Jacoby, 2000a).‚Äù ‚ÄúIn the southern hemisphere, successful crossdating has been achieved on alerce (Fitroya cupressoides) and pehuen (Araucaria araucana), also known as 'Chilean pine' or the 'monkey puzzle tree,' specimens in South America, kauri (Agathis australis) specimens in New Zealand, clanwilliam cedar (Widdringtonia cedarbergensis) specimens in Australia and Tasmania, and huon pine (Lagarostrobus franklinii) in Tasmania (Jacoby, 2000al; Norton, 1990).‚Äù ==Application== The main application of tree research laboratory science or dendroarchaeology is to produce records of past climates that might be unavailable otherwise. Timber remains give insight into what little remains of our national forests prior to colonial settlement. This also benefits the sciences of paleoclimatology. Dendrochronological dating is potentially applicable wherever trees were growing, except in tropical regions. For use in absolute dating of archaeological sites, it is partially limited by the availability of a master reference chronology for the region concerned. If there is a gap in the chronology (e.g. the inability to use a chronology constructed from pine samples in the British Isle prior to the 17th century due to the lack of use of pine in architecture then) then absolute dating cannot be applied. Additionally, non-climatic influences can also affect the tree-ring pattern of timber samples. Even if a reference chronology is available, care must be taken to identify aberrations in the ring pattern to determine if the sample is usable for dating. Dendroarchaeology has been used extensively in the dating of historical buildings. After cross-matching the chronology from the building with the chronology of living trees, it is immediately possible to figure out the dates at which the historic timbers used in construction were felled. Similarly, if an extended chronology is available, then dating of samples from buildings of known or unknown date is possible. However, a limiting aspect of this application becomes apparent when dating medieval buildings. In such buildings, many timber samples lack completeness out to the underbark surface which can make the task of determining the felling year much more difficult. The application of dendroarchaeology in uncovering past trade patterns also becomes possible as chronology records for timber around the world become more complete and accessible. Patterns from individual samples will match much more closely with their native chronologies than with their regional chronology. For example, strong cross dating is found between Irish and English chronologies, but individual ring patterns tend to match better against their local chronologies. Hence, this strong geographical component of tree ring chronologies can be used to source timber samples at archaeological sites to uncover trade routes required for the site construction. Dendrochronology can also be used in concert with radiocarbon dating to allow for more accurate date measurements using radiocarbon dating on archaeological sites. It is known that the concentration of carbon-14 in the atmosphere is not constant. By performing radiocarbon dating on timber samples in a known chronology, radiocarbon dates can be plotted against real time generating a calibration curve that can be used for future radiocarbon samples. While dendrochronology is often considered as an absolute dating method, it can also be used as a powerful tool in the relative dating of an archaeological site. Timber samples may be able to be compared with others on the site to help construct a timeline of events for that particular site. Such samples can also be used to settle issues in constructing a chronological typology for artifacts found on site. The important point is that such within-site analysis can be done whether or not a chronology is available to date the whole assemblage. ==See also== * Archaeology ==References== Category:Dendrology Category:Archaeological science ","title":"Dendroarchaeology"},{"id":"2226214","text":"Palazzo Tercasio, the first print office of Principality of Salerno Palazzo di Citt√†: the cloister Campagna (Italian: ) is a small town and comune of the province of Salerno, in the Campania region of Southern Italy.

Campagna is located in one of the Picentini Mountains valleys at an altitude of 270 meters above sea level. ==History== The first records of the area date back to the IX century in the Lombard period. The position of the town was strategic for enemies attacks during the Middle Age. Lately, the town became an important cultural and religious center. It was home for many Bishops until the 1973 when the Diocese of Campagna merged with the Archdiocese of Salerno. During the Second World War, Campagna was a temporary home for many Jews thanks to Giovanni Palatucci and his uncle Giuseppe Maria Palatucci. People arrived from the north of Italy and Campagna citizens hid those people in the basements of the churches. Giovanni was later honoured as a Righteous Among the Nations by the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial. Much of this is documented in Elizabeth Bettina's book, It Happened in Italy. Today, goods left by the Jews are shown in the Museo della Memoria in the Campagna town centre. ==Geography== Campagna borders with Acerno, Contursi Terme, Eboli, Olevano sul Tusciano, Oliveto Citra, Postiglione, Serre and Senerchia (this one in the Province of Avellino), The municipality counts the frazioni of Camaldoli, Galdo, Mattinelle, Puglietta, Quadrivio, Romandola-Madonna del Ponte, Santa Maria La Nova and Serradarce.

Sean Donahue is in the kickboxing ring against the current Thai champion. In his corner is his little brother Jake, who is cheering Sean on. Sean is able to overpower his opponent and wins after a spin kick knocks the Thai fighter out. Sean is rewarded with the championship. En route to their hotel after the fight, Jake and Sean are ambushed by some armed men. Sean is able to fight them off until he is shot at by Khan, who warned Sean he was not to have won the fight. Sean admits that it wasn't his intention but the opponent wasn't much of a contender. Khan, angry with the decision, fights Sean and obliterates him in front of young Jake. Khan performs a triple kick combination starting with a double jump kick to the head, followed by a double jump kick to the chest and a jump spinning back kick, which kills Sean. Jake, saddened and angry, races towards Khan who beats Jake up and knocks him out. It has been ten years and Jake is now a New York City detective who has gone undercover to bust a drug deal in an abandoned warehouse. Jake mocks the dealer and tells the dealer that he is a cop. The dealer laughs it off at first, until Jake reveals his badge and wire, which infuriates his fellow officers. The dealer and his two men attempt to begin fighting Jake, who resorts to a street fighting style to ultimate stop the dealer and his men. SWAT arrives and the team leader is unhappy with Jake for his actions. Back at the office, Jake is getting reamed out by Captain O'Day, who tells Jake the dealer may have a chance to call police brutality due to his actions. However, O'Day makes Jake a deal that could get him out of his potential bind. Interpol has contacted NYPD about an operation involving snuff films and wants Jake to take on the operation. When Jake learns the operation is in Thailand, Jake refuses to take the assignment. However, that night, while viewing one of the films, he learns the man who stars in the film is Khan, which triggers the flashback of his brother's death. When Jake gets a call from O'Day to let him off the hook, Jake tells him he's taking the assignment. Upon his arrival in Thailand, Jake meets his contact Anderson, who tells him that the men behind the snuff films look around for fighters to star in their films. Therefore, Jake must find a way to get attention. While this is going on, an American fighter, Dan Handel, is the latest star of Khan's new film, in which he learns the hard way about what filming is like. When Dan is cut for real and then shot at, he is shocked to discover the body of a dead woman. Khan arrives and beats up Dan before impaling him on a hook, causing his death. Jake's first attempt at a Muay Thai school proves to be unsuccessful. However, his actions grab the attention of Thasi, a Thai-American Muay Thai fighter. That night, as a reward for his latest actions, Khan is given a chance to choose a woman to spend the night with and chooses Molly, an American who came to Thailand to start a modeling career only to find herself duped with nowhere else to go. When she tricks Khan into doing a tradition of washing up for him, she escapes. When Khan sends men after her, Jake comes to her rescue and the two form a bond. The next day, Thasi follows Jake, Jake confronts him only to be beaten up. Jake is convinced that he will need more than street smarts if he plans to defeat Khan. Thasi, knowing Jake will not be able to stand a chance against Khan with his current skill, recommends a fighter named Prang, who is the only man to come close to defeating Khan. Since the devastating loss, Prang has resorted to becoming a hermit living off the Mekong River. When Jake arrives to Prang's place, Prang is completely drunk and blows Jake off. As Jake sets off to leave, Prang's chimpanzee steals Jake's passport. The next day, Jake heads to Prang to retrieve his passport and sees Prang getting mugged. Jake's attempt proves unsuccessful with Prang showcasing his martial arts skills, knocking out all of the muggers and sending them away. He admits the mugging was a ruse to see how well Jake can fight and invites him to dinner. That night, Prang tells his story of how he fought and ultimately lost to Khan. The loss caused Prang to become a drunken hermit, and yet he had wanted revenge on Khan for a long time. When Jake reveals how Khan had killed his brother ten years ago, Prang is at first reluctant to teach Jake for revenge. However, Prang sees the opportunity as redemption and decides to put Jake through a painful regiment of training. When Jake grows tired of the pain he must endure at the hands of Prang, a confrontation leads to Jake almost leaving Prang, only to apologize and decides to take the training seriously. Molly looks for Jake and must escape Khan's men. Eventually, Molly does reach Jake and the two start a romance. Jake becomes more proficient in martial arts and proves his mettle in an underground fight. When Jake begins winning his fights, it grabs the attention of Mr. McKinney, the scout for the snuff films. Jake accepts McKinney's offer. However, that night, while having dinner with Molly, Jake is stunned by the arrival of both Anderson and Capt. O'Day, who learns Jake's real reason why he accepted the mission. O'Day wants Jake off the mission, but Jake has told them he made contact and he makes his \\"movie\\" the next day. Anderson fully decides to side with Jake and at first reluctant, O'Day agrees as well. The next day, Jake is ready and heads to the location, which consists of a booby-trapped dome made of bamboo. However, when he leaves, Khan has Molly kidnapped and Prang killed. As Jake, wearing the mask of Hanuman makes his way through the first round of goons in the dome, he plays it off pretending like he doesn't know what's going on and even throws his mask to the ground. However, Khan, wearing a black mask, arrives and has Molly tied up and throws Prang's body to the bottom, watery lake where Jake is shocked. Khan and Jake start out with a sword fight until Jake is hit in the side and Khan's mask is sliced off, revealing his face. A visibly upset Jake reveals the photo of Sean from ten years ago and throws it to Khan. Khan knows who Jake is now and promises to send him to Hell. Jake says he has been there for ten years and the two go one-on-one with both nearly equally matching their skills. Khan gets the upper hand and almost sends Jake to death via impalement on a ground spike only for Jake to barely hang on to the cage. When Khan breaks a piece of bamboo as a staff to knock Jake down, Jake grabs the staff and jumps up and begins his assault on Khan. Khan attempts the triple death kick combination only to learn that thanks to Prang's training, Jake has learned to counter the three kicks. Jake finally defeats Khan, to the shock of everyone on set. When Jake attempts to get Molly, Khan gets up and runs towards Jake, who kicks Khan to the dome entryway, which falls on Khan. In his last breath, Khan grabs the rope in an attempt to send Molly to a grounded spike in the water only for Jake to rescue her. The Thai authorities arrive with O'Day and Anderson. Jake is relieved to see the film finally get shut down. The Thai authorities blow up the bamboo dome as Molly and Jake celebrate as they can start their lives over together. ==Cast== * Loren Avedon - Jake Donahue * Billy Blanks - Khan * Richard Jaeckel - Captain O'Day * Don Stroud - Anderson * Keith Cooke - Prang * Sherrie Rose - Molly * William Long - Big Boss * John Kay - Mr. Director * David Michael Sterling - McKinney * Michael DePasquale Jr. - Sean Donahue * Jerry Trimble - Drug Dealer * Vincent Lyn - Warehouse Fighter #1 * Steve Tartalia - Warehouse Fighter #2 * Dean Harrington - ==Production== According to an interview with actor Loren Avedon, he shot his scenes independently with his scenes involving Richard Jaeckel as his boss. In addition, in the scene where Avedon's character does the Stallone- like scream after seeing Khan and remember the death of his brother, Avedon told director Lo he wanted to just toss the tape into the fire in anger. However, the director didn't allow it so Avedon ended doing the scream. He also did not get along well with Sherrie Rose, who played his girlfriend in the film. Avedon claimed Rose was acting like a prima donna and told her to \\"shut up\\" and she had bad mouthed him afterwards. According to an interview with screenwriter/producer Keith W. Strandberg, actress Sherrie Rose had issues with a scene where she was to go topless in a love scene with co-star Loren Avedon. She replaced an actress who refused to do the nudity scene but she also had complained once it was time to shoot the scene. However, the filmmakers were careful in only getting a few seconds of the nudity in the scene. Strandberg also confirmed that Billy Blanks' character of Khan is actually the son of a Thai mother abandoned by his American serviceman father, thus Khan having a hatred for Americans. The film has some noticeable similarities to the Jean-Claude Van Damme film Kickboxer, which was released a year earlier and features similar locations, plot and general atmosphere. ==Sequels== King Of The Kickboxers was actually the fourth film In the No Retreat No Surrender/Karate Tiger Film series, preceded by No Retreat No Surrender, No Retreat No Surrender 2 Raging Thunder and No Retreat No Surrender 3 Blood Brothers. In 1991 Seasonal Films released American Shaolin which was marketed as being King Of The Kickboxers Part II, So there was speculation that it was No Retreat No Surrender 5 until in 2017 when the film The Town Monger by Kufewa Acrobatics was released in Malawi it was announced that that was No Retreat No Surrender 5, making American Shaolin its own standalone film outside the No Retreat No surrender canon and The Town Monger essentially being No Retreat No Surrender 5 The Town Monger or The King of The Kickboxers Part II. ==Influence== James Goddard, former member of Research and Development at Capcom confirmed in an interview with Capcom Unity that Blanks' character of Khan was the inspiration for his creating the character of Dee Jay in the video game Super Street Fighter II in 1993. ==ReferencesInterview with Loren Avedon at cityonfire.com Category:1990 films Category:1990s action thriller films Category:Kickboxing films Category:Underground fighting films Category:Snuff films in fiction Category:Martial arts tournament films ","title":"The King of the Kickboxers"},{"id":"2226228","text":"Libellula depressa, the broad-bodied chaser or broad-bodied darter,Hart. M., et al, (1978), The Naturetrail Omnibus, London: Usborne Publishing Limited, page 157 is one of the most common dragonflies in Europe and central Asia. It is very distinctive with a very broad flattened abdomen, four wing patches and, in the male, the abdomen becomes pruinose blue. == Identification == The male and female have a broad, flattened abdomen which is brown with yellow patches down the sides. In the male the abdomen develops a blue pruinosity that covers the brown colour. Both fore and hind wings have a dark patch at the base. Both the male and female have broad antehumeral stripes. The average wingspan is approximately 70 mm. L. depressa is very distinctive and should not be confused with any other dragonflies in the region. Broad-bodied Chaser, maturing male, South of France Broad-bodied Chaser, adult female, South of France ==Distribution and habitat== L. depressa is found in central and southern Europe, central Asia and the Middle East. It range extends northwards to southern Scotland, southern Sweden and southern Finland and it occurs on some Mediterranean islands including Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and Menorca. Its range does not extend beyond southern Europe into Africa. L. depressa is seen near still-water lakes and ponds, feeding on many types of small insects. They occur in both bare and sunny locations, where it is often the first dragonfly to colonise new habitats such as newly created ponds, and well vegetated ponds. L. depressa are often seen away from water as the adults are very mobile and undergo a period of maturation away from water after emergence. The adults are also migratory. ==Behaviour== The flight period is from April to September but are mostly seen in May and June. Their flight is very fast as they dart and dive above the water. They are very territorial and will fight with rival males and any other dragonflies they happen to encounter.Hunting and returning to a favoured perch They characteristically return to a favoured perch, in the sun. When a female enters a male's territory the male will fly up and grab the female. Mating occurs on the wing and the pair are in tandem for only a brief period, often less than a minute. The pair separate and the female will find a suitable location for ovipositing, usually a stretch of open water with submerged vegetation. The female oviposits in flight, hovering above the water and dipping the tip of her abdomen in. The eggs hatch in 4 or 5 weeks and the larvae take one to two years to develop. The larvae live in the silt and detritus at the bottom of the pond, lying buried in mud with just the head and eyes showing. After emergence the adults move away from water and undergo a period of maturation which lasts 10 to 14 days. ==Systematics== This species is usually placed in the genus Libellula but there is some evidence, based on RNA and DNA analysis, that this species should be placed within the genus Ladona (Artiss et al., 2001).

It is one of the most common dragonflies in Europe, occurring in a wide variety of water bodies, though with a preference for breeding in still water such as ponds and lakes. In the south of its range adults are on the wing all year round. ==Appearance== Sympetrum species are not easy to tell apart and in most areas more than one Sympetrum species will occur. Females and teneral individuals have light yellow thorax and abdomen. Males turn red as they mature. Females darken with age, becoming a dark chocolate brown, and sometimes develop a blue colouration to the bottom of the abdomen. The wings also develop a brown tinge with age. In all cases the legs have a cream or yellow stripe on a black background - this is a diagnostic feature of this species. The pterostigma of the females can be red, blue, pale blue or brown.

This small dragonfly is seen in a wide variety of habitats, including lakes, ponds, canals and slow-flowing rivers. They are ambush predators, waiting on a prominent perch - such as a leaf or the top of a gate, until prey fly past, whereupon they will fly after it. They are territorial on breeding waters, often attempting to chase much bigger dragonflies away such as southern hawkers. This habit of repeatedly returning to a sunny spot allows you to easily predict where they are going to land, which is why it is one of the easiest dragonflies to photograph. In suitable hunting areas away from water, however, they are not territorial: large numbers may assemble - groups of several hundred in a single field have been recorded - and lines of insects can be seen along the top of field gates. Eggs are not laid, but broadcast from the air: the male holds the female in tandem and swings her down and forward over water. At the furthest point of the arc the female releases some of her eggs to fall on the water.

It is one of the founding texts of Brazilian modernism. The novel follows a young man, Macuna√≠ma, \\"a hero without a character,\\" born in the Brazilian jungle and possessing strange and remarkable abilities‚Äîmostly shapeshifting‚Äî, as he travels to S√£o Paulo and back again. The protagonist is often considered a representation of the Brazilian personality. The novel employs a composite structure using elements of what would later be called magic realism and a number of dialects of both interior Brazil and S√£o Paulo. It is based on Andrade's research in language, culture, folklore, and music of the indigenous peoples in Brazil. ==Style== Macuna√≠ma was an attempt on the part of Andrade to write a novel which represented pan-Brazilian culture and language.. The author desired to write Macuna√≠ma in the spoken language of Brazil. Macuna√≠ma's catch phrase \\"Ai, que pregui√ßa!\\" is a pun in both Tupi language and Portuguese as \\"Ai\\" is a Tupi word for sloth and \\"pregui√ßa\\" is Portuguese for sloth. This is an example of Andrade using a fused language to write this text, which begins with a simple description \\"In the depths of the virgin jungle was born Macuna√≠ma, hero of our people. He was jet black and son of the fear of the night\\". Considered a \\"rhapsody\\" by Andrade himself, Macuna√≠ma is a melding of the cultures of Brazil. Most of the folk lore contained within the text is taken directly from native stories; Lucia S√° has shown that Andrade's novel draws heavily on the narratives of the Pemon people that were collected and recorded by Theodor Koch-Gr√ºnberg.S√°, Lucia, Rain Forest Literatures: Amazonian Texts and Latin American Culture. University of Minnesota Press, 2004. pp. 35-68. ==Plot== In the tale, Macuna√≠ma travels from his home tribe in the jungle to S√£o Paulo and back again, with chase scenes that go all over the country of in between, in order to retrieve an amulet which he lost. The amulet had been given to him by his lover, Ci before she ascended into the sky to become a star. He encounters all sorts of folk legends and orixas along the way. The interactions which Macuna√≠ma had with most of these characters was imagined by Andrade, though the essence of the folk lore remains true. ==Cinematic Adaptation== In 1969, the Brazilian production company Filmes do Serro made a film based on the novel, but with a substantially different storyline. The story takes place in Rio de Janeiro rather than S√£o Paulo, and is set at more or less the time the film was made.. == Characters == *Macuna√≠ma: The main protagonist and Tapanhumas youngest child. A shapeshifting anti-hero born in the fictional indigenous tribe of Tapanhumas (that as the same name of his mother), who is well known for his hedonism, self-centredness and general laziness (his most recurring feature). After he accidentally slays his mother Tapanhumas, he, along with his brothers Jiqu√™ and Maanape, leave their tribe in shame, but he soon finds his true love C√≠, who gives him a child. Unfortunately, the child dies of poisoning, and a grief-stricken C√≠ gives him an amulet before she literally ascends to heaven. However, Macuna√≠ma loses this amulet in a fight against a supernatural snake and has to travel to S√£o Paulo, as the giant who stole it, (Piaim√£), lives there. After several misadventures in S√£o Paulo, Macuna√≠ma eventually slays the giant and retrieves the amulet before he and his brothers return to their tribe. However, in an argument with his brother Jiqu√™, Macuna√≠ma literally curses him, but his spell backfires as he himself becomes ill and both his brothers become a shadow-like monster that eventually bonds with the king vulture. To make matters worse, Macuna√≠ma has previously angered the sun goddess, \\"Vei\\" when he rejects her daughters sometime before (or a little after) he retrieves his amulet, and in revenge, she tricks him into making out with a monstrous Iara who steals his amulet again and literally tears him apart. He survives, but knowing that he has no true reason to live without his amulet (and that his chance to find it again is slim at best), Macuna√≠ma also ascends to heaven and becomes the constellation Ursa Major. For most of the rhapsody, Macuna√≠ma is a figure of fun and, despite being described as ugly, he's a quite successful ladies' man, which is evident by the relative ease with which he dates (and makes out) with almost all women that he encounters. *Jiqu√™: Macuna√≠ma's older brother, Maanape younger brother and Tapanhumas second child. Described as loyal and hard-working, Jiqu√™ despises his younger brother's immature and selfish nature as he makes no effort to help his family. Worse, Macuna√≠ma frequently causes some sort of hard-time or humiliation for Jiqu√™ himself in both direct and indirect ways, having for example, stole Jiqu√™'s dates and girlfriends even since he was a 6 years old child (indeed, a recurring gag in the book is that any woman that express the slightest sign of romance or attraction towards Jiqu√™ almost invariably ends up having sex with Macuna√≠ma, much to Jiqu√™'s chagrin). For the most, Jiqu√™ is loyal to his family and makes his best to help his brothers, but grows increasingly annoyed at Macuna√≠ma's antics, and after he twice lost magical objects that Jiqu√™ stole to help to find food, Jiqu√™ gets mad at him and refuses to bring any food to their house. Macuna√≠ma, in response, curses Jiqu√™ so potently that he, his Brother Maanape and another lover of Macuna√≠ma, jaguataci, are turned into a kind of Shadow-like demon that decides to get revenge on Macuna√≠ma by eating anything before Macuna√≠ma himself can, but he eventually bonds with the king vulture and becomes his fearsome shadow. *Maanape: Tapanhumas's eldest child. Already quite old at the beginning of the tale, Maanape has a supportive role and serves as a mediator between Macuna√≠ma's immaturity and Jiqu√™'s short temperament, and while not approval of the former's hedonism, he is always willing to defend him from the latter's angers and do his best to help his younger brothers. The narrator often says that he is a sorcerer, but Maanape's magic is seldom seen, though he has twice resurrect Macuna√≠ma when he was inadvertently killed during the story, and the narrator often notices that Maanape already knows something before his brothers themselves notice or have the chance (or interest) to share, implying that Maanape has some sort of divinatory/telepathical ability. in the end, he gets turned into the shadow creature cited above by Macuna√≠ma, and eventually gets bonded to the king vulture. *Piaim√£: A cannibalistic Peruvian giant and commercian and the novel's primary main antagonist. Also known as Venceslau Pietro Pietra, Piaim√£ founded Macuna√≠ma's amulet in the woods and takes it with him to S√£o Paulo. Macuna√≠ma make several attempts to retrieve his amulet from Piaim√£, but no attempt to trick or to kill him worked well (even a powerful Macumba only make him heavenly, but temporally ill). Eventually, though, Macuna√≠ma becomes stronger and, through clever tricks, makes Piaim√£ falls in the same pot in which he intended to cook the protagonist, and his last words before dying were \\"Needs salt...\\". His exact height wasn't said, but he was tall enough to use a normal human as an earring. *Ci: An Icamiaba (Brazilian equivalent of an amazon) and nature spirit, Ci, \\"mother of the forest\\", was Macuna√≠ma's main and true love of his life. When he first saw her, he became horny and, with the help of his two brothers, successfully overpowers the strong woman and has sex with her. Despite (or perhaps, due to) the rape, Ci actually became infatuated with Macuna√≠ma, and they soon marry and come to love each other genuinely. She also eventually gives birth to Macuna√≠ma's first (and only) son (in whom Macuna√≠ma takes great pride) who already make economical plans for him. Unfortunately, Ci's breast was poisoned by a snake and when she was forced to breast feed him, he dies. In grief, Ci leaves Earth to become a star, but not before she gives him a magical amulet as a reminder of their love. this will set in motion the main events of the novel. Macuna√≠ma gains the title of \\"The King of the Virgin Forest\\" (Rei da Mata), which grants him the status of nature spirit/deity. *Vei: The playful, but also vengeful sun goddess and second main antagonist. Vei appears very early on the story, \\"gently\\" warming the backs of Macunaima and his brothers as they leave Tapanhuma's tribe, but she gains pivotal importance during the middle of the book in the chapter Vei. During an incident (before or after he retrieves his amulet) in which Macuna√≠ma becomes trapped on a small island, Vei, in mortal guise and along with her daughter, rescued and bathed Macunaima. As they browse in the river, Vei proposes to Macuna√≠ma to married to any daughter that she has (even more than one if necessary), under the condition of respect the marriage and to never have sex with any other women. It is never revealed why she makes such offer (possibly because of his status as the \\"king of the Virgin Forest\\" and the playful affections that she already as for him), but Macuna√≠ma soon breaks his promise, and so Vei angrily reveals that, if he had married any of her daughters, he would become immortal. This revelation surprises Macuna√≠ma, but he remains indifferent to Vei's anger as the damage was already done. Vei gets her revenge, though, in the final of the book as she tricked Macuna√≠ma into having sex with a monstrous Iara that quickly rips him apart and takes away his amulet, this time for good. *Macuna√≠ma's parrot: The last main character to appear, but the very first to be heard as he's also the story's narrator. He \\"first\\" appears in the very end of the book, when he finds a sick and lonely Macunaima in his hut some time after he has turned his brothers into shadow. At first, Macuna√≠ma finds him to be little more than an annoyance, but soon (possibly out of loneliness) warms to him and even tells him one of his \\"famous\\" fairy tales. On the next morning, though, Macuna√≠ma discovers that the parrot has stolen his amulet and, after a short but heated chase, soon finds the bird and forces him to give his amulet back. However, Macuna√≠ma quickly notices the presence of an attractive woman in the river, unaware of the fact that she was an Iara sent by Vei to get revenge upon him. Sex-crazed as he is, Macuna√≠ma can't help but try to make out with that woman, only to have his amulet stolen and be torn apart by the river monster, while the parrot is powerless to do anything but witness the brutality. After Macuna√≠ma recovers most parts of his body (except his leg), Macuna√≠ma tells the parrot his story and, knowing that there was not point or hope to find his amulet again, Macuna√≠ma plants a magical seed that grows into a giant plant that takes him to the sky where he turns into Ursa Major. Out of sorrow and respect, the parrot decides to tell Macunaima's story to the readers so his legend will not be forgotten. ==References== Category:1928 novels Category:Brazilian magic realism novels Category:Brazilian novels Category:Portuguese-language novels Category:Fiction about shapeshifting Category:High fantasy novels Category:Novels set in S√£o Paulo Category:Novels about cannibalism Category:Brazilian novels adapted into films ","title":"Macuna√≠ma (novel)"},{"id":"2226278","text":"Mikel Scicluna (July 29, 1929 - March 20, 2010) was a Maltese professional wrestler who gained his fame during the 1960s and 1970s.Obituary New York Times, March 25, 2010; page A29. ==Professional wrestling career== Scicluna started wrestling during the 1950s,Baron Mikel Scicluna.

Scicluna worked primarily in Canada until 1965, when he ventured to the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), now known as WWE, using his most famous moniker \\"Baron\\" Mikel Scicluna. Scicluna was famous for entering the ring with a royal blue cape over his shoulders, indicating that he was of Maltese royal descent. Scicluna was also known for being a master of the \\"foreign object\\", mainly utilizing a roll of coins to bash opponents out of sight of the referee. He enjoyed success as a tag team wrestler, winning the WWWF United States Tag Team Championship with Smasher Sloan on September 22, 1966, in Washington, D.C. (though they eventually lost the belts in the same city to Spiros Arion and Antonio Pugliese), then the WWWF World Tag Team Championship with King Curtis Iaukea on February 1, 1972, in Philadelphia. In singles competition, Scicluna defeated Spiros Arion for Australia's IWA World Championship on June 15, 1968, and would challenge Bruno Sammartino and Pedro Morales for the WWWF Championship from time to time. One of his biggest career wins was pinning Waldo Von Erich in six minutes at Madison Square Garden, prior to two Garden title matches with Sammartino. In the first match at MSG against Sammartino he was disqualified; Sammartino scored the pin in a rematch. Scicluna went on to lose a series of matches to Spiros Arion. In June 1976, Scicluna found himself part of history, as the opponent for Gorilla Monsoon on the night Monsoon engaged in an impromptu tussle with boxing great Muhammad Ali. Scicluna was wrestling Monsoon in a televised match and was sent over the top rope to the floor after receiving a Manchurian Chop. Scicluna waved off his opponent and walked off, taking a countout loss. From there, Ali entered the ring from the audience and tried to jab at Monsoon. Monsoon responded by dropping Ali with an airplane spin. This angle was a part of the buildup toward Ali's infamous boxer vs. wrestler match with Antonio Inoki later in the month. Scicluna retired from active competition in 1983. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 1996. ==Personal life== He was the son of Vincenzo Scicluna and Maria (n√©e' Catania) who were married in Mosta, Malta, on 27 August 1927. He was named after his paternal grandfather Michele Scicluna. In retirement, he lived in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He also worked as a driver for the New York Times.

In Balinese gong kebyar styles, there are two types of gangsa typically used: the smaller, higher pitched kantilan and the larger pemade. Each instrument consists of several tuned metal bars (either iron or bronze) each placed over an individual resonator. The bars are hit with a wooden panggul, each producing a different pitch. Duration of sound intensity and sound quality factors are generally accomplished by damping the vibration of the bar with the fingers of the free hand. Balinese gong kebyar gangsas, as with other metallophones in gong kebyar ensembles, are played in neighboring pairs with interlocking, rapid-tempo parts that elaborate on the melody of a piece of music (see Kotekan); these pairs are tuned to be dissonant and create certain wavelengths of sympathetic vibrations to create a shimmering tone (see Ombak) that travels long distances.

The race featured 21 lead changes among a dozen different drivers. Jeff Gordon passed Mark Martin with 11 laps remaining and sped to victory. Terry Labonte took second, giving Hendrick Motorsports another 1-2 finish. *2000: Jeremy Mayfield scores a win for Penske Racing South, his second of his career, during the post race celebration, Mayfield jumped on the roof of the car and dented it, leaving the car to be too short and penalizing Mayfield championship points. After that, the NASCAR Sanctioning Body strictly allows jumping on the roof in celebration but it has been done since then numerous times. *2001: On what would have been Dale Earnhardt's 50th birthday, the race was ran with Rusty Wallace holding off Jeff Gordon at the end. During the celebration, Rusty had a 3 flag to fly around the track in the reverse direction. In 1993, Earnhardt and Wallace ran in reverse to hold Alan Kulwicki and Davey Allison flag's at the last race in Atlanta that year. After Dale's death, Rusty was the last driver of that group of four drivers to race. *2002: There were ten drivers who failed to finish the race; with five of the drivers forcing to leave the race due to terminal crashes while five other drivers had engine issues. Nearly 10% of the 199-minute race was held under a caution flag and the average green flag run was approximately 38 laps. Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s unfortunate accident forced NASCAR to pass a regulation forcing drivers to take the ambulance ride to the infield care center every time they crashed; he did not admit to have this injury until mid-September. At the end, Jimmie Johnson holds off Kurt Busch to score his first career win. *2008: The race started on Sunday, completing only 87 laps with 7 yellow flags and 2 red flags. One red flag was caused on lap 21 during the first day when Casey Mears spun upon hitting water that had seeped up through cracks in the track, collided with Dale Earnhardt Jr., then got turned over on his roof by Sam Hornish Jr.. NASCAR postponed the remainder of the event to Monday due to a lengthy red flag for rain. The rain delay on Sunday also delayed the Stater Brothers 300 to Monday. Carl Edwards would go on to win the event, while he finished 5th in the Nationwide Series race. The Cup Race was postponed at 2 AM ET on Monday and resumed at 1 PM ET the same day. The Nationwide Series Race was held shortly after 5 PM ET on Monday. *2013: Kyle Busch won after Joey Logano and Denny Hamlin crashed fighting hard for the lead on the last lap. Busch also took the weekend sweep by winning the Nationwide race the day before. It is the first Fontana victory in the NASCAR Cup Series both for Joe Gibbs Racing and Toyota. From 2011 to 2013, Busch finished in a reverse order: 3rd (2011), 2nd (2012) and 1st (2013). The last lap crash between Logano and Hamlin sent Hamlin into the inside wall (without a SAFER Barrier) head-on. As a result, he suffered a compression fracture of his L1 vertebra in his back, which forced him to miss four races. *2014: Denny Hamlin missed the race when he came down with a sinus infection that impacted his vision about an hour before the race, necessitating Joe Gibbs Racing to hire Sam Hornish, Jr. to drive the car. The race was marred by a massive rash of tire failures, with over 20 tire failures happening in the race itself. Multiple drivers, like Dale Earnhardt Jr., Kevin Harvick, Jimmie Johnson, Brad Keselowski, Marcos Ambrose, and more, fell victim to tire failures and had to work their way back through the field to salvage a lead lap finish. A spin by Clint Bowyer with two laps to go set up a dramatic green-white-checkered finish. Over the second-to-last lap, the field went five wide, with Kurt Busch leading. Over the last lap, Kyle Busch and Nationwide race winner Kyle Larson overtook Kurt for the lead. A side-by-side battle for the lead between Busch and Larson nicknamed the \\"Kyle and Kyle Show\\" unfolded. Larson looked like he was going to win his first Cup race, but Busch cleared and moved in front of Larson out of turn 4 and took his second straight win at Auto Club. There were a race high 35 lead changes among 15 leaders. *2016: After a late race caution, Jimmie Johnson pulls out of the crowd to hold of leaders Kevin Harvick, and Denny Hamlin to claim his 77th career win in the Superman car, passing Dale Earnhardt in career wins. Johnson would later win his 7th Championship, tying Earnhardt and Richard Petty in most career championships. *2019: Kyle Busch earns his 200th win after sweeping all 3 stages and coming back from an penalty on pit road, tying Richard Petty for most the NASCAR National Series wins. ==References *Ratings For NASCAR From Fontana Since 1999 Category:1997 establishments in California Category:NASCAR Cup Series races Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1997 Category:Annual sporting events in the United States ","title":"Auto Club 400"},{"id":"2226345","text":"The vagrant darter (Sympetrum vulgatum) is a European dragonfly.

He was known for his role as Dr. Joe Gannon in the television drama Medical Center, which aired on CBS from 1969 to 1976. ==Early life== He was born in South Bend, Indiana, in 1937, to Virdeen Ruth (n√©e Hopper) and Harry Clyde \\"Ted\\" Cramton.Chad Everett profile at FilmReference.com His father was a racecar driver as well as a racing mechanic and an auto parts salesman. Some confusion existed regarding the year of his birth. According to The Washington Post, \\"many reference sources list Mr. Everett's date of birth as 1936, but legal records indicate he was born one year later. He routinely gave his age as consistent with a birth date in 1937.\\" His name was later changed to Chad Everett by his agent Henry Willson. Everett said he did not mind the change because he was tired of explaining his real name, \\"Raymon-no-D, Cramton-no-P.\\" He was raised in Dearborn, Michigan, where he attended Fordson High School. While there, he played on the football team as a quarterback and began acting in stage plays at age 14. During his junior year at Wayne State University in Detroit, he joined a State Department-sponsored acting troupe that toured India. \\"I went into acting because I'm easily bored\\", Everett once said. \\"Acting seemed to give vent to a lot of different feelings.\\"Hoosier Actors, Cont'd He graduated from WSU with a degree in drama. ==CareerActing=== Everett's first notable role came in an episode of the ABC/Warner Bros. 1960-1962 detective series Surfside 6. His first major role came a year later in the film Claudelle Inglish, and he subsequently played a deputy in the short-lived 1963 ABC Western television series The Dakotas, which featured Jack Elam as a fellow lawman. After appearing in a number of movies and television series in the later 1960s, he got his big break, landing the role of Dr. Joe Gannon on the medical drama, Medical Center, with costar James Daly.Erickson, Hal. Chad Everett He appeared in numerous films and television series, including The Singing Nun, Centennial, Hagen, Airplane II: The Sequel, Star Command, and Mulholland Drive. He also appeared as a guest star in more than 40 television series such as Redigo, Melrose Place, The Nanny, Touched by an Angel, Diagnosis: Murder, Caroline in the City, Murder, She Wrote, The Red Skelton Show, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., and Route 66. In 1986, Everett's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was unveiled. In 1987, Everett supplied the voice of Ultraman Chuck in the English version of the animated movie Ultraman: The Adventure Begins and voiced several characters in the animated television series The New Yogi Bear Show. He hosted Trinity Broadcasting Network's Master's Theater. He was selected by the family of John Wayne to be the voice of the audio-animatronic figure of Wayne in Disney's Hollywood Studios' The Great Movie Ride. Based on Patrick Wayne's suggestion, Everett also provided the voice of Wayne in a scene that only appears in the VHS version of Gremlins 2: The New Batch (replacing the Hulk Hogan scene that appeared in the theatrical and DVD versions). In 2001, Everett played one brief scene with Naomi Watts in David Lynch's Mulholland Drive. Salon online magazine cited this scene as \\"the heart of the movie\\". ===Writing=== Everett authored and self-published a book of romantic poetry, which he dedicated to wife Shelby Grant. ===Philanthropy=== For many years, Everett co-hosted the Labor Day Jerry Lewis Telethon, which raises money and awareness for and about the affliction of muscular dystrophy. ==Personal life== Everett married actress Shelby Grant in Tucson, Arizona, on May 22, 1966. Everett was on location in Tucson filming the 1967 movie, Return of the Gunfighter, at the time of their wedding. They had two daughters, Katherine and Shannon Everett. The couple remained married for 45 years until her death after a brain aneurysm on June 25, 2011. Everett credited his family with being a stabilizing force in his life, stating that even in the worst of times, Grant \\"never threatened to leave. She would tell me that she was there for me. If not for my family, I would have been in big trouble.\\" Grant noted his romanticism; he sent her so many flowers during their courtship that \\"my balcony looked like a burial ground.\\" He also often wrote sentimental poems to Grant throughout their marriage, as well as to his daughters. The couple renewed their marriage vows every seven years. During an appearance on The Dick Cavett Show that aired on March 31, 1972, Everett notoriously listed his animals as \\"three horses and three dogs and a wife\\" and that his wife was \\"...the most beautiful animal I own.\\" Fellow guest Lily Tomlin gasped \\"You own? I have to leave!\\" and walked off the set. After Medical Center ended, Everett became frustrated when no movie roles were forthcoming and television roles were not working out. A long-time social drinker, he began drinking heavily. He was consuming a quart of vodka a day by the time he quit drinking in 1986. \\"I was a functional alcoholic.\\" Shelby noted his alcohol-related mood swings and has said, \\"finally I confronted him. I came into the bedroom with a big pot of coffee one morning and said 'we have a major problem to deal with here.'\\" A month later, Everett caught sight of himself on a video and did not like what he saw. \\" 'Finally,' I said, 'I am really in trouble'. I stepped outside and I looked up and said, 'Father, you take it. I can't handle it anymore.'\\" The next day, he told his daughters (who were living at home at the time), \\"I am addicted to alcohol, and I am not going away to detox. I am going to do it here so that you can see what happens to someone if you let a substance take control of you.\\" He attended his first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting the next day and claimed he never drank again, attributing his discipline to his Christian faith and his self-pride. ===Lawsuit=== Beginning in 1973, actress Sheila Scott initiated court proceedings against Everett three times, claiming her son Dale (born 1973) was fathered by him. The lengthy and complicated paternity suit finally ended in 1984, when a California Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Everett. The court stated: > \\"From the evidence adduced, the jury concluded that Everett was not Dale's > father despite the 94.67 percent probability of paternity from the HLA > test.\\" and \\"In this appeal, we affirm a judgment following a jury verdict > finding the defendant and respondent not to be the father of the minor > child.\\" Everett refused to take any more tests regarding paternity. He entered into a private financial settlement with Scott in 1973, but steadfastly maintained he was not Dale's father. In 1991, Scott was sentenced to three months' probation following a guilty verdict of \\"harassing\\" Everett for 18 years, including death threats against him and his wife. She was also ordered to undergo psychological testing and to never publicly declare that Everett was Dale's father. ==Death== Everett died July 24, 2012, at his home in Los Angeles after an 18-month battle with lung cancer.LA Times obit for Chad Everett, July 24, 2012 He was 75 years old.He was cremated and his ashes were combined with the ashes of his wife, Shelby Grant. ==TV and filmography== *Claudelle Inglish (1961) as Linn Varner *Lawman (1961, TV Series) as Cole Herod / Jim Austin *77 Sunset Strip (1962, TV Series) as Ross / Anthony Chase / Mark Adams *Rome Adventure (1962) as Young Man *The Chapman Report (1962) as Bob Jensen *The Dakotas (1962-1963, TV Series) as Deputy Del Stark *Get Yourself A College Girl (1964) as Gary Underwood *Branded (1965, TV Series) as Adam Manning / Tad Manning *Combat!

The Deepings () are a series of settlements close to the River Welland near the borders of southern Lincolnshire and north western Cambridgeshire near the city of Peterborough and between the towns of Spalding and Stamford in eastern England. The adjoining villages and a town are in the Lincolnshire fens near the River Welland, some 8 miles to the north of Peterborough and 10 miles or so east of Stamford. The area is just north of the Peterborough border. The Deepings include: Deeping St James, Deeping St Nicholas, Market Deeping and West Deeping. Frognall, Stowgate, Hop Pole and Tongue End are all within the various civil parishes. Another village that is also included in The Deepings is Deeping Gate, a small hamlet across the River Welland in Cambridgeshire. The area is very low-lying, and gave The Deepings their name (a Saxon name translatable as either 'deep places' or 'deep lands'). The villages are mentioned in the Domesday Book. Deeping Fen lies to the North, and the drainage of it was an important part of seventeenth and eighteenth century land reclamation.

Walter S. Burr was the Voice Director for the series. == Production  Background === The series was created to launch Marvel Productions, successor of DePatie‚ÄìFreleng Enterprises, who had previously produced the 1978 New Fantastic Four and 1979 Spider-Woman animated series (where Spider-Man made two appearances). === Character designs === The character design for Peter Parker (as well as other supporting characters including Aunt May and J. Jonah Jameson) was also quite faithful to the comic books of the period and hearkened back to the illustrations by John Romita Sr. of the young hero in Spider-Man's newspaper strip adventures from the 1970s. Due to network constraints and demands from parents, characters such as Spider-Man were not allowed to make a fist to strike an opponent, but the show's creators managed to conceal these issues with a focus on action and relatively fluid animation. Much like the Spider- Man newspaper strip of the late 1970s, Peter Parker's character design did away with the 1960s crew cut for a more modern hairstyle during this time, which the character continued to be portrayed with through the 1980s and early 1990s. Likewise; Parker abandoned the conservative suit and tie of the 1960s comics and previous animated series in favor of dark blue straight-legged linen pants; Paired with a hip turquoise/light blue jacket over a yellow turtleneck (although he infrequently wore a button down shirt in the series and put on a tie for the President's arrival at the New York City airport in \\"Dr. Doom, Master of the World\\"). Stan Lee once remarked that John Romita Sr. often drew Parker with a turtleneck instead of a collared shirt since he felt it would better hide his Spider-Man costume, which was always worn under his street clothes. Peter's mask was connected to his costume at the back of the neck, almost like a hood, which he would pull over his head when he changed into Spider-Man. === In relation to Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends === Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends was originally believed to be something of a sequel to this solo Spider-Man animated series, although this has since been disputed as both series first aired at the same time on September 12, 1981. The two series are connected in the latter's third-season episode \\"Origin of the Spider-Friends.\\" Although not as well known as Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, it does remain faithful to the character's origin. The animation style of both incarnations and incidental music soundtrack are identical, although the voice actors are different. One seeming inconsistency is Norman Osborn (The Green Goblin). In this series, his portrayal is similar to that seen in the comics: wearing a costume and having a split personality. In Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends he seems to be portrayed as having a serious medical condition as a result of a lab accident, and physically transforming into the Goblin. However, at the end of Triumph of the Green Goblin, he is shown falling, with his disguise in shreds (after colliding with electric wires), and tells Spider-Man he'll go back to the clinic he left to be cured, which can be interpreted as either having a treatment for his Goblin transformation or therapy for his split personality. In the episode \\"The Prison Plot\\" of Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends, there is a flashback sequence that depicts a scene from this series' \\"When Magneto Speaks...People Listen\\", which hints the two shows are, in fact, connected. Doctor Doom is pulverized by his laser cannon, accidentally tampered by Spider-Man, and Boris, his old assistant, joins the protagonist to be able to stop him, just like Red Skull dies in the decisive battle. However, since Doctor Doom appears in the third episode and his faithful Boris accompanies him as always, just like Red Skull is still alive in the thirteenth episode, Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends can not be considered the sequel of 1981 TV series. == Episodes == The episodes featuring Doctor Doom had an ongoing storyline about rebels in Latveria trying to topple Doom. Throughout these episodes Doom is able to trick people, especially Jameson, into thinking that he is a kind ruler and international humanitarian. == Broadcast and home media release == All 26 episodes have been released on DVD in the UK by Clear Vision, over four DVD volumes. To avoid confusion with other Spider-Man DVD titles, Clear Vision released the show on DVD under the name Spider-Man 5000. As was the case with Amazing Friends, the series was later re-aired in the late 1980s as part of the 90-minute Marvel Action Universe, a syndicated series that was used as a platform for old and new Marvel-produced animated fare (the newer programming featured RoboCop: The Animated Series, Dino-Riders and on occasion, X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men, which was intended to serve as a pilot for a potential X-Men animated series). The show was last rerun in the US in 1998 as part of the UPN Kids Action Zone block alongside several other Marvel shows. The rights to all Marvel shows were owned by Disney, before Marvel acquired them in 2008. Currently there are no plans for a DVD release in the US or elsewhere. In Canada, Morningstar Entertainment released the episode \\"The Vulture Has Landed\\" on DVD in the set entitled Spider-Man Vs. The Vulture. The set also contains \\"The Vulture's Prey\\" and \\"The Dark Terrors\\", both from the 1967 Spider-Man TV series. Morningstar also released \\"Canon of Doom\\" (on the Fantastic Four VS. Doctor Doom set, included in the Villains Showdown Gift Set that also includes \\"Spider-Man Vs. The Vulture\\"), although the episode is the Bonus episode on the disc. \\"Arsenic And Aunt May\\" was also released in the Heroes box set. All the Morningstar DVDs were mastered from VHS/Betamax copies that were released by Prism Video in 1985 as part of their Marvel Video Library series. The series was available for streaming on Netflix from 2011 to 2013. The series became available on the Disney+ streaming service at its U.S. launch in November 2019. == References  External links == * * * 1981 Spider-Man Cartoon at Toon Zone Category:1981 American television series debuts Category:1982 American television series endings Category:1980s American animated television series Category:American children's animated action television series Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:Television shows based on Marvel Comics Category:Animated television series based on Marvel Comics Category:Animated Spider-Man television series Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:UPN Kids Category:UPN original programming Category:Marvel Action Universe Category:Television series by Marvel Productions Category:American children's animated superhero television series ","title":"Spider-Man (1981 TV series)"},{"id":"2226387","text":"Lowell House is one of twelve undergraduate residential Houses at Harvard University, located at 10 Holyoke Place facing Mount Auburn Street between Harvard Yard and the Charles River. Officially, it is named for the Lowell family, but an ornate ALL woven into the ironwork above the main gate discreetly alludes to Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Harvard's president at the time of construction. Its majestic neo-Georgian design, centered on two landscaped courtyards, received the 1938 Harleston Parker Medal and might be considered the model for later Harvard houses nearby. Lowell House is simultaneously close to the Yard, Harvard Square, and other Harvard \\"River\\" houses, and its blue-capped bell tower, visible for many miles, is a local landmark. ==History and traditions== Lowell House bell tower in autumn. Lowell was one of the first Houses built in the realization of President Lowell's long-held dream of providing on-campus accommodations for every Harvard College student throughout his career at the College. (See Harvard College house system.) Its first Master, was Mathematics Department chairman Julian Lowell Coolidge, who also instituted Monday-night high table. Historian Elliott Perkins was the first to hold the position of Resident Dean (until recently known as the Allston Burr Senior Tutor) then was Master from 1942 to 1963. Classicist Zeph Stewart was the third Master, and William and Mary Lee Bossert served from 1975 to 1998. The current faculty deans of Lowell House are David Laibson and Nina Zipser. Lowell's sister college at Yale University is Pierson College. House traditions include Masters' Tea on Thursday afternoons, a May Day Waltz at dawn on the Weeks Footbridge, high table, and the annual Lowell House Opera mounted in the dining hall. Springtime brings the Bacchanalia Formal, often with a live swing band in the courtyard. For each Arts First event, the first weekend in May, there is a courtyard performance of the 1812 Overture, during which those not part of the official orchestral ensemble are encouraged to assist on kazoos; in lieu of cannon, hydrogen-filled balloons are ignited by the House chemistry tutor; and until recently (see below) the performance would climax with the role originally scored by Tchaikovsky for authentic Russian zvon (a \\"bell\\" in the Slovakina language or \\"bell sound\\" in Russian), being played (appropriately enough) by Lowell's own authentic Russian zvon. There is a winter holiday dinner, and various sophomore, senior, Roundtable and faculty dinners take place throughout the year. Language tables and special-interest tables are common features of everyday lunches and dinners. Many House events are organized by Lowell's \\"House Committee\\" of elected undergraduates from within the House. The committee operates separately from the Harvard Undergraduate Council (UC), to organize student events and manage funding. The HoCo, as with the other student government organizations in the Houses, is funded by the UC. Lowell House was the residence of Silas (Method Man) and Jamal (Redman) in the 2001 comedy How High. As part of Harvard's House Renewal Project, Lowell House closed for renovation in the summer of 2017; work was completed in the summer of 2019. ==Architecture== Designed by the firm of Coolidge Shepley Bulfinch and Abbott and constructed in 1930 for $3.62 million,Lowell House History, retrieved from the official House website the House was named for the prominent Lowell family, closely identified with Harvard since John Lowell graduated in 1721. The busts of President Abbott Lawrence Lowell (1909‚Äì1933) and poet James Russell Lowell, are featured in the main courtyard. In the Dining Hall are portraits of Lowell and his wife Anna Parker Lowell; his sister, poet Amy Lowell; his brother, astronomer Percival Lowell; and his grandfather John Amory Lowell. Prior to the 1996 transition to randomized House assignments, Lowell's central location, picturesque courtyard, elegant dining hall, and charming traditions made it a popular housing choice. The Lowell House arms are those of the Lowell family, blazoned: Shield: sable, a dexter hand couped at the wrist grasping three darts, one in pale and two in saltire, all in argent. The crest is a stag's head cabossed, between the attires a pheon azure. The motto is Occasionem Cognosce (\\"Recognise Opportunity\\") (In more prosaic terms, a shield with a black field displays a right hand cut off at the wrist and grasping three arrows, one vertical and two crossed diagonally, in silver. Above is a stag's head mounted behind the ear, and between its antlers is a barbed, broad arrowhead in blue. The house colors are blue and white. ==The Lowell House Bells== Lowell House's bell tower and two courtyards, with Malkin Athletic Center at upper left For three-quarters of a century, Lowell House's bell tower was home to a set of authentic Russian zvon, one of the few complete sets of pre-revolutionary Russian bells surviving anywhere. The eighteen bells were bought in Russia around 1930 by Thomas Whittemore with the financial aid of millionaire Chicago plumbing magnate Charles R. Cranewho reportedly paid merely their value as scrapjust as they were to be melted down by Soviet authorities. Crane donated them to Harvard in 1930 just as plans for Lowell House were nearing completion.Luis Campos, Amiable Discord: The Rescue and Return of Harvard's Russian Bells, Harvard University Press, forthcoming Like those seen today on Dunster and Eliot Houses, Lowell's tower was originally meant to be a clock-towerLowell's in particular is reminiscent of Philadelphia's Independence Hall, although it was actually modeled after a Dutch church. With word of Crane's gift, the planned tower was changed to the blue-capped bell tower seen today. (One of the eighteen bells did not harmonize with the others, so was hung in the Harvard Business School's Baker Library.) The bells originally hung in Moscow's Danilov Monastery (now the seat of the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church) and were installed with the help, at first, of musician Konstantin Konstantinovich Saradzhev, and Vsevolod Andronoff, a former resident of the monastery They range in weight from 22 pounds (10 kg) to 26,700 pounds (12,100 kg, and known to Lowell House students as \\"Mother Earth\\"). The bells are consecrated, and are of great significance to the Russian Orthodox Church, in the liturgy of which bells play an important role. At Lowell, the bells were usually rung on Sundays at 1pm by resident Klappermeisters. After the annual Harvard‚ÄìYale football game, Harvard's score would sometimes be proclaimed on the \\"Mother Earth,\\" with Yale's score tolled on the \\"Bell of Pestilence, Famine, and Despair.\\" With the reopening of the Danilov Monastery, it was suggested that the bells be returned to their original home. At Harvard's June 2008 Commencement, they sounded for the last time at Lowell House, after which the bell tower was partially dismantled so that the bells could be withdrawn. In their places were hung newly cast near-replica bells obtained with the financial assistance of the Link of Times Foundation, created by Russian industrialist Viktor Vekselberg.Elif Batuman, \\"The Bells\\", The New Yorker, April 27, 2009, pp. 28-29; for complete details, see Luis Campos, Amiable Discord: The Rescue and Return of Harvard's Russian Bells, Harvard University Press, forthcoming The now-departed bells may still be heard on the Lowell House Virtual Bell Tower. The bells sound Sunday afternoons during term time, and at special events such as commencement. ==Notable alumni== Lowell House courtyard in winter.

It was the second of two Sprint Cup Series races held at the Auto Club Speedway (the other being the Auto Club 500) and in 2009 and 2010 it was run in October as part of the Chase for the Sprint Cup. ==History== The event was first held in 2004, added as part of the 2004 NASCAR Realignment, and was partially featured in the film, Herbie: Fully Loaded. From its inception until 2008 the race was run on Labor Day weekend, which was previously the traditional date of the Southern 500 at Darlington, and in the Inland Empire in the 1970s, the former California 500 United States Auto Club Marlboro Championship Trail race. The 2005 race was famous for Kyle Busch becoming the youngest NASCAR Cup Series winner ever (then known as the Nextel Cup Series). As part of the 2009 realignment in NASCAR Auto Club Speedway, Talladega Superspeedway, and Atlanta Motor Speedway agreed to switch dates, with the Atlanta race moving from its traditional fall date to Labor Day weekend and becoming known as the Labor Day Classic 500. The realignment returned the Labor Day weekend race to the southern United States and gave California its first late season race since the final running of the Winston Western 500 at Riverside International Raceway in 1987. The AMP Energy 500 at Talladega moved into the race date vacated by Atlanta, with the Pepsi 500 moving into Talladega's former October date. The Pepsi 500 name was used in August 2008, with Pepsi taking title sponsorship from Sharp. This announcement was made by the speedway's website, Pepsi has been the official soft drink sponsor of the speedway since 1997, before Auto Club Speedway became part of International Speedway Corporation, owner of several circuits on the NASCAR schedule. This was done despite ISC signing a contract with Coca-Cola to replace Pepsi as the official soft drink sponsor of its racetracks in 2008 (the contract is slowly being phased in). NASCAR announced on January 13, 2010 that they would be shortened 100 miles. NASCAR then announced that, due largely to poor attendance, the 2010 running of this race would be the last as Auto Club Speedway returned to a single date on the Sprint Cup schedule as that race was exchanged to Kansas Speedway in 2011 marking a 2nd race date on June 5, 2011. ==Past winners== {  style=\\"font-size: 95%;\\" - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Year ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Date ! rowspan=\\"2\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Driver ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Team ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Manufacturer ! colspan=\\"2\\"Race Distance ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Race Time ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Average Speed (mph) ! rowspan=\\"2\\"Report - !

Nowotaniec (, 1409; ; , Novotanets‚Äô) is a village in south-eastern Poland, inhabited by about 430 (2002), in the Pog√≥rze Bukowskie (Bukowsko Upland) mountains. Situated in the Subcarpathian Voivodeship (since 1999), previously in the Krosno Voivodeship (1975‚Äì1998) and the Sanok district, Bukowsko subdistrict, located near the towns of Medzilaborce and Palota (in northeastern Slovakia). Nowotaniec is bordered on the east by Bukowsko, on the north by Wola Sƒôkowa, on the west by Nadolany, on the right bank of the Pielnica river (a tributary of the Wis≈Çok), on the left side of the highway nr 889 from the railroad running from Sanok to Krosno, and on the west by forests covering the slopes of the Bukowica Range. This village consists of one street which runs north to south displaying Latin church stone and several houses. The parish belongs to the Diocese of Przemy≈õl, deanery of Sanok. It includes, Nag√≥rzany, Nadolany, and Wola Sƒôkowa. The Roman Catholic cemetery is located westward of the village center. ==History== Latin church in Nowotaniec Nowotaniec is just up the road from Bukowsko. Historically it has been a mostly Polish village. The region subsequently became part of the Great Moravian state. Upon the invasion of the Hungarian tribes into the heart of the Great Moravian Empire around 899, the Lendians of the area declared their allegiance to Hungarian Empire. The region then became a site of contention between Poland, Kievan Rus' and Hungary starting in at least the 9th century. This area was mentioned for the first time in 981 (by Nestor the Chronicler), when Vladimir the Great of Kiev took the area over on the way into Poland. In 1018 it returned to Poland, 1031 back to Rus', in 1340 Casimir III of Poland recovered it. In the 14th century the Galicia region along with the Sanok district were annexed to Poland by Casimir III the Great of Poland, who began colonisation of these areas (see: Walddeutsche). In the 14th and 15th centuries a number of new settlements were set up, including Trepcza, Czerte≈º, Prusiek, Nowotaniec, Kostarowce, Tyrawa Solna, Str√≥≈ºe Wielkie and Ma≈Çe, H≈Çomcza, P≈Çowce, Sanoczek, Miƒôdzybr√≥d≈∫. Those settlements were owned by noble and knights‚Äô families. Substantial land was the property of the Kmita family ruling from Sobie≈Ñ Castle, and Bal from Nowotaniec Castle. Nowotaniec, with upper-suburb Nagorzany,\\" Nowotaniec, with Zagorzany, a small town in the county of Sanok, lies in a wooded, hilly area on the highway from Zarszyn to Bukowsko (. away). The town itself consists of a marketplace and several streets in the valley of the Pielnica River, a tributary of the Wislok on the right bank, elevation above sea level. Several streams flow into the Pielnica there from nearby hills, namely, on the west from Wysoka gora (), and on the east from Bukowica (). To the north the village of Nadolany and to the south the village of Nagorzany create a kind of suburb. Nowotaniec itself has 595 inhabitants, 428 Roman Catholic, 11 Greek Catholic, and 156 Jews. A Roman Catholic parish is headquartered there, with a beautiful church made of stone; there are also an elementary school, a manor transformed from an ancient castle, and a brewery. There is a weekly market held every Mon-day, as well as four annual fairs: on the Monday after the feast of the Holy Trinity, and on 1 May, 2 August, and 11 November. The major estate has 16 morgs of farmland; the minor estate [land owned by peasants] has 496 morgs of farm-land, 40 of meadows, and 35 of forests. We do not know much about the history of Nowotaniec. The date of its founding is unknown. In the 15th century there was a German settlement there called Lebetanz, and Piotr, its noble owner, signed his name to the document founding the parish in Humniska. Later the name was changed to Nebetanz, and finally to the one it bears today. In the 16th century the latter name had already come into general use, spelled Nowothancze or Nowotancze. The Archiwum grodzkie i ziemskie (vol. IX, Lwow 1885) contains two documents signed by Stanislaw Bal and Maciej Bal, castellans of Sanok. Nowotaniec remained in the Bals' possession until the time of King Stefan Batory. Jan Bal, cupbearer of Sanok, founded a parish there in 1492. Later Nowotaniec came to be owned - partly by way of inheritance, partly through purchases - by the Hungarian family de Stano related to the Bals. The 16th century was marked by intensified conflicts caused by the worsened living conditions in villages. Arian and Calvinistic (Nowotaniec) congregations were established, promoting protestant ideas. Hieronim de Stano was a religious dissenter and converted the church into a Helvetian congregation [i. e., Calvinist or other Swiss Protestant sect], and he paid for a minister for the congregation; but in 1613 it was returned to the Catholics. In 1643 the Sejm wanted to elevate this settlement, and for this reason established a warehouse there for Hungarian wine. During Bishop Denhoff's inspection visit in 1699 it was recorded that on one side of the church stood the castle of Aleksander de Stano, and on the other a congregation of dissenters. Several years later Boguslaw Stan sold Nowotaniec to Bukowski, royal chamberlain, and he built the church that still exists today, which was consecrated by Bishop Sierakowski in 1745 under the name of St. Mikolaj [St. Nicholas]. The parish belongs to the diocese of Przemy≈õl, deanery of Sanok, and includes Darow, Nadolany, Nagorzany, Pielnia, Pulawy, Wola Jaworowska, and Wola Selkowa [this is probably Sekowa Wola], with a total of 1,960 Roman Catholics and 156 Greek Catholics. Not far from Nowotaniec lies the castle of Zborsko, built in 1529 by Odnowski, palatinate of Krakow. After the Bukowskis, Nowotaniec was owned by the Bronieckis, and currently Wiktor Pozniak owns the major estate and the exclusive right to produce and sell alcohol on its grounds\\". [Mac.

Translated by William Fred Hoffman, PGSA Fall 2001 Rodziny a small town in the county of Sanok, lies in a wooded, hilly area on the highway from Zarszyn to Bukowsko ( away). The start of settlement that became Nowotaniec began as a royal village established in 1366 based on the Privilege of Casimir III the Great. The village was founded on the principles of the Magdeburg Rights, and its inhabitants were exempted from all taxes towards the king for a period of twenty years. In 1409, the ownership of Nowotaniec (Lobetanz) was passed over to the knights of Hungary (Petrus Hungarus de Lobetanz) and his brother. The town itself consists of a marketplace and several streets in the valley of the Pielnica river, a tributary of the Wis≈Çok river (ger. Weisslog ) on the right bank, elevation above sea level. The parish belongs to the diocese of Przemy≈õl, deanery of Sanok, and includes Darow, Nadolany, Nagorzany, Pielnia, Pu≈Çawy, Wola Jaworowa and Wola Sekowa with a total of 1,960 Roman Catholics and 156 Greek Catholics (in 1887). Not far from Nowotaniec lies the castle of Zboiska, built in 1529 by Odnowski, palatinate of Krak√≥w. The village was a center of the Polish Reformed Church and the Stano family were staunch members of it, supporting a Calvinist church in the village from the end of 16th century until 1713 when they sold the property to Roman Catholics and the Calvinist church in the village was suppressed. In the first half of the 19th century plagues fell upon the residents of the region. From the time of the Austrian annexation (1772) Nowotaniec became a subdistrict settlement First owner Mathias Bal de Lobetanz (Bals ownership since 1366 - 1556), next owners family de Stano, since 1714 the Bukowskis family. In the 17th century the village was quite important centre of trade and craftsmanship. A good period ended in 1709, when it was looted by the Swedish troops in the Great Northern War. Nowotaniec was owned by the earl Jaworski-Sas since 1767, and currently Krziwkowicz-Pozniak owns to 1944. This part of Poland was controlled by Austria for almost 120 years. At that time the area (including west and east of Subcarpathian Voivodeship) was known as Galicia since 1772. The Roman Catholic Church in Nowotaniec has a collection of records for Nowotaniec and surrounding Roman Catholic villages in its parish like Nadolany and Nag√≥rzany. The Roman Catholic Church in Nowotaniec was established in 1409, the parish in 1424. At the end of World War II, after the Germans withdrew, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army became active. Its units terrorised Polish population and destroyed military and police posts. Fights ended in 1947 when as the result of Operation Vistula the Ukrainian population was resettled to Western Poland. Between 1945 - 1949 Nowotaniec was the gmina due to the destruction of Bukowsko by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. The village was burned down April 1946 by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army too.3,000 in rebel band terrorized Galicia, Ukrainian Nationalists, German deserters led by SS colonel burn 3 villages (Nowoataniec, Nag√≥rzany, Bukowsko) in a night (by wireless to The New York Times) Sanok, Poland, April 17, 1946 ‚Äì a strong, well-organized and elusive band of Ukrainian nationalists and German deserters, estimated at more than 3,000 under the leadership of a German colonel, in a fortnight have succeeded in transforming this sector of the Carpathian foothills of old Galicia into a virtual partisan stronghold. With the burning of three large villages on a single night two weeks ago, they now have made 10,000 of this area's total pre war population of 135,000 homeless and are resisting with complete success all efforts to quell what is tantamount to open insurrection. [...] The writer of this dispatch lat week went to the heart of the bandit country, to the village of Bukowsko, where on the night of April 4 the bandits burned down all but eleven of the 400 houses and made more than 3,000 persons homeless. Our escort consisted of the refugee Mayor, now in Sanok and two squads of well-armed Security Police under the command of a nervous 20-year- old second lieutenant. Before burning the village the bandits who were well armed with German and Russian automatics and machine guns, had demanded 1,000,000 zlotys tribute, and the village had raised 300,000. On the night of the fire the villagers received scant warning a few hours before from a peasant that the bandits were coming, but had not had time to remove their cattle. The first Jewish families appeared in Nowotaniec at the start of the 18th century. In 1765, 74 Jews lived in the village. They belonged to the Ryman√≥w community (kohal). However, they have gotten independence earlier, before 1777. Then, 10-12 Jewish families were in village. Four houses belonged to they. In 1824, community (kohal) counted 84 persons. In 1870, 249 persons were Jewish inhabitants already. Community owned synagogue and school. 22 pupils walked for school. In 1900, Jewish community counted 287 persons. Did not have community in village Rabbi. Then, 148 Jews lived in city. In 1921, village counted 524 half-breeds, these 42 Jews in Nowotaniec. 1885 - Yeshi Michal Gilernter, born 1842 was appointed rabbi.Shtetl Finder: Jewish Communities in the 19th and Early 20th Centuries in the Pale of Settlement of Russia and Poland, and in Lithuania, Latvia, Galicia, and Bukovina, with Names of Residents.

The adult stage is found between April to early September in the United Kingdom, and from mid-May to mid-August in Ireland. Larvae have a two-year developmental cycle. Adults feed predominantly on mosquitoes, gnats, and midges;http://www.shgresources.com/ak/symbols/insect/ Retrieved 16 Feb. 2010 the larvae feed primarily on other aquatic insect larvae and on tadpoles. There is a variant form, praenubila Newman, which has exaggerated wing spots. This is believed to be related to water temperatures during larval development, and appears to be more common in Europe than in the Americas. The four-spotted skimmer is the state insect of Alaska. ==Habitat== This active dragonfly mainly lives by ponds, vernal pools, and slow flowing rivers; they are most common in June and July. ==Identification== The brown colour and the four spots on the wings make them unmistakable. ==Behaviour== Four-spotted chaser on its perch The male is considered to be highly aggressive and will defend a given territory from incursions from other males of the species. The male is known to form preferences for prominent perches and will often return to the same perches around the margins of pools and ponds whilst it patrols for intruders. Males have a favourable view of the sky during perching. They look toward a section of the sky away from the sun, with less radiation but a higher UV and blue-violet saturation. Thus, the fovea of the eyes, which is sensitive to blue and UV radiation, is optimally suited to the detection of flying insects against the blue sky. Both sexes are prolific fliers, and mating takes place in the air, rather than on perches or amongst the vegetation. The female lays her eggs on floating vegetation. They tend to be easier to approach than Broad-bodied Chasers. ==Predators== The larger emperor dragonfly (Anax imperator) is a predator of this species. Another is the green tiger beetle (Cicindela campestris). ==Gallery== Libellula quadrimaculata LC0270.jpgfemale Four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata) female dorsal.jpgfemale, variant praenubila Libellula quadrimaculata in flight- pjt3.jpgIn flight Libellula quadrimaculata asahinai(Copulation , Japan , 2018.06.02).jpgCopulation Libellula quadrimaculata.ogvthumbtime=0:52Hunting and returning to a favoured perch at a pond ==References== * ==External links== * USA Distribution Data * Four-spotted chaser British Dragonfly Society * Fauna Europaea taxonomy and mapping * Biolib.cz Libellula quadimaculata photos Biolib.cz taxonomical synonyms and photos * Photo * Photo of L. q. praenubila * Libellula quadrimaculata at AzOdes * Libellula quadrimaculata at funet.fi * Libellula quadrimaculata profile and photos Category:Libellulidae Category:Dragonflies of Europe Category:Fauna of Alaska Category:Insects described in 1758 Category:Insects of Canada Category:Insects of the United States Category:Odonata of Asia Category:Odonata of North America Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Symbols of Alaska ","title":"Four-spotted chaser"},{"id":"2226401","text":"The Rossendale Valley is in the Rossendale area of Lancashire, England, between the West Pennine Moors and the main range of the Pennines. The area includes the steep-sided valleys of the River Irwell and its tributaries (between Rawtenstall and Bacup), which flow southwards into Greater Manchester. The rivers cut through the moorland of the Rossendale Hills, generally characterized by open unwooded land, despite the ancient designation of \\"forest\\". ==History== One of the earliest sites of historical interest in the valley is that of the dykes at Broadclough, which are associated with the Battle of Brunanburh. In late Middle Ages, the valley was part of the Royal Forest of Rossendale. The original medieval meaning of 'forest' was similar to a ‚Äòpreserve‚Äô, for example land that is legally kept for specific purposes such as royal hunting. So ‚Äòforests‚Äô were areas large enough to support species such as wolves and deer for game hunting and they encompassed other habitats such as heaths, open grassland and farmland, so not necessarily extensively wooded.Woodland Trust blog/2018/03/difference-between-wood-and-forest Initial settlement would have been in \\"booths\\" or farmsteads and encroachment into the forest would have developed them into small hamlets. Rossendale was governed by a constable nominated by principal landowners who held the position of \\"The Greave of The Forrest\\" which after 1515 became a quasi-hereditary position held by the Whitacker family at the only ancient hall in the district: Broadclough Hall. In 1507 the land in the Forest of Rossendale was demised to copyhold farmers and a new church was established on the hillside at Seatnaze around 1511, presumably considered a convenient location for the population at that time. In 1789 an act authorised the construction of new Turnpike trust roads through the district, connecting Bury and Haslingden with Blackburn and Whalley, with a junction at Haslingden to Todmorden via Oakenheadwood, Newchurch, Stacksteads and Bacup. In 1826 the Haslingden and Todmorden trust built another new road along the valley bottom, from Stacksteads through Thrutch, Rawtenstall and Newhall Hey. By 1848 a number of woollen and cotton mills had been established along the river. And by the late 19th century it was the valley bottom that had become the population centre. In 1889, the short-lived Rossendale Valley Tramways Company was established to operate a route between Bacup and Crawshawbooth via Rawtenstall. In 1908 the route was taken over by Rawtenstall Corporation Tramways. ==Geography== The Forest contains two Marilyns; Hail Storm Hill and Freeholds Top, as well as the summit of Great Hameldon. Geographically, it is sandwiched between the West Pennine Moors to the west and the South Pennines to the east. The Irwell Valley in Rossendale is characterised by the steep sided valley of the River Irwell and its tributaries which dissect the moorland of the Rossendale Hills. In the valley bottom, urban settlements grew up at river crossing points between Rawtenstall and Bacup and today form a contiguous urban and industrial development. Textile mills and chimneys and gritstone terraced houses are the dominant buildings and roads are concentrated in the narrow valley. The river has its source on Deerplay Moor in Cliviger near Burnley, heading south to Bacup, where it turns to the west past Stacksteads. The valley narrows at Thrutch, and the Irwell collects Whitewell Brook shortly afterwards at Waterfoot. It flows onward to Rawtenstall where it is met by Limy Water and then turns back to the south. Collecting the River Ogden at Irwell Vale it continues into Greater Manchester. The geology of the area is layers of gritstone, coal and glacial deposits of sand and gravel. These rocks were cut by fast flowing rivers, the Irwell and its tributaries, to form steep valleys with sides typically high and a narrow valley floor. Tree cover on the steep slopes includes remnants of ancient woodland but most areas are more recently planted. ==Culture== Most Rossendalians consider themselves to live in 'The Valley' and this is still locally a commonly used term to describe the district. ==References== Category:Geography of the Borough of Rossendale Category:Mountains and hills of Lancashire Category:Moorlands of England ","title":"Rossendale Valley"},{"id":"2226403","text":"A man playing a gend√®r A gend√®r is a type of metallophone used in Balinese and Javanese gamelan music. It consists of 10 to 14 tuned metal bars suspended over a tuned resonator of bamboo or metal, which are tapped with a mallet made of wooden disks (Bali) or a padded wooden disk (Java). Each key is a note of a different pitch, often extending a little more than two octaves. There are five notes per octave, so in the seven-note p√©log scale, some pitches are left out according to the pathet. Most gamelans include three gend√®r, one for sl√©ndro, one for pelog pathet nem and lima, and one for pelog pathet barang. The gend√®r is similar to the Balinese gangsa, which also has an individual resonator under each key, and the saron, which, although trough-resonated, does have a set of tuned metal bars or keys. It is also similar to the Javanese slenthem, which is pitched lower and has fewer notes. In some types of gamelan, two gend√®rs are used, both spanning approximately two and a half octaves, the gend√®r barung and the gend√®r panerus, pitched an octave higher than the other. In Gamelan Surakarta, the gend√®r panerus plays a single line of melodic pattern, following a pattern similar to the siter. The gend√®r barung plays a slower, but more complex melodic pattern that includes more separate right and left hand melodic lines that come together in kempyung (approximately a fifth) and gembyang (octave) intervals. The melodies of the two hands sometimes move in parallel motion, but often play contrapuntally. When playing gend√®r barung with two mallets, the technique of dampening, important to most gamelan instruments, becomes more challenging, and the previously hit notes must be dampened by the same hand immediately after the new ones are hit. This is sometimes possible by playing with the mallet at an angle (to dampen one key and play the other), but may require a small pause. Both types of gend√®r play semi-improvised patterns called cengkok, which generally elaborate upon the seleh. These are relatively fixed patterns, but can be varied in a number of ways to suit the style, pathet, irama, and mood of the piece, as well as the skill of the performer. The cengkok repertoire for gend√®r are more developed and specific than those for most other elaborating instruments. Similarly, the gend√®r barung is likely to give cues for changing parts or irama, especially in the absence of a rebab, which usually leads the ensemble. It may also play the buka of a piece. ==See also== * Gamelan * Bonang * Kethuk * Music of Java ==References *Video *Javanese Gend√®r barung *Javanese Gend√®r panerus, with audio Category:Panerusan instruments Category:Plaque percussion idiophones Category:Keyboard percussion ","title":"Gend√®r"},{"id":"2226410","text":"A sonicator at the Weizmann Institute of Science during sonicationSonication is the act of applying sound energy to agitate particles in a sample, for various purposes such as the extraction of multiple compounds from plants, microalgae and seaweeds. Ultrasonic frequencies (>20 kHz) are usually used, leading to the process also being known as ultrasonication or ultra- sonication. In the laboratory, it is usually applied using an ultrasonic bath or an ultrasonic probe, colloquially known as a sonicator. In a paper machine, an ultrasonic foil can distribute cellulose fibres more uniformly and strengthen the paper. ==Effects== Sonication has numerous effects, both chemical and physical. The chemical effects of ultrasound are concerned with understanding the effect of sonic waves on chemical systems, this is called sonochemistry. The chemical effects of ultrasound do not come from a direct interaction with molecular species. Studies have shown that no direct coupling of the acoustic field with chemical species on a molecular level can account for sonochemistry or sonoluminescence. Instead, in sonochemistry the sound waves migrate through a medium, inducing pressure variations and cavitations that grow and collapse, transforming the sound waves into mechanical energy. ==Applications== Sonication can be used for the production of nanoparticles, such as nanoemulsions,Peshkovsky, A.S., Peshkovsky, S.L., Bystryak, S. \\"Scalable high-power ultrasonic technology for the production of translucent nanoemulsions\\", Chemical Engineering and Processing: Process Intensification, 2013. 69: p. 77‚Äì62. nanocrystals, liposomes and wax emulsions, as well as for wastewater purification, degassing, extraction of seaweed polysaccharides and plant oil, extraction of anthocyanins and antioxidants, production of biofuels, crude oil desulphurization, cell disruption, polymer and epoxy processing, adhesive thinning, and many other processes. It is applied in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, water, food, ink, paint, coating, wood treatment, metalworking, nanocomposite, pesticide, fuel, wood product and many other industries. Sonication can be used to speed dissolution, by breaking intermolecular interactions. It is especially useful when it is not possible to stir the sample, as with NMR tubes. It may also be used to provide the energy for certain chemical reactions to proceed. Sonication can be used to remove dissolved gases from liquids (degassing) by sonicating the liquid while it is under a vacuum. This is an alternative to the freeze-pump-thaw and sparging methods. In biological applications, sonication may be sufficient to disrupt or deactivate a biological material. For example, sonication is often used to disrupt cell membranes and release cellular contents. This process is called sonoporation. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) can be made by sonication of a dispersion of large multilamellar vesicles (LMVs). Sonication is also used to fragment molecules of DNA, in which the DNA subjected to brief periods of sonication is sheared into smaller fragments. Sonication is commonly used in nanotechnology for evenly dispersing nanoparticles in liquids. Additionally, it is used to break up aggregates of micron-sized colloidal particles. Sonication can also be used to initiate crystallisation processes and even control polymorphic crystallisations.Deora, N.S., Misra, N.N., et al. (2013) Ultrasound for improved crystallisation in food processing, Food Engineering Reviews, 5(1):36-44. It is used to intervene in anti-solvent precipitations (crystallisation) to aid mixing and isolate small crystals. Sonication machines for record cleaning at Swiss National Sound Archives Sonication is the mechanism used in ultrasonic cleaning‚Äîloosening particles adhering to surfaces. In addition to laboratory science applications, sonicating baths have applications including cleaning objects such as spectacles and jewelry. Sonication is used in food industry as well. Main applications are for dispersion to save expensive emulgators (mayonnaise) or to speed up filtration processes (vegetable oil etc.). Experiments with sonification for artificial ageing of liquors and other alcoholic beverages were conducted. Soil samples are often subjected to ultrasound in order to break up soil aggregates; this allows the study of the different constituents of soil aggregates (especially soil organic matter) without subjecting them to harsh chemical treatment. Sonication is also used to extract microfossils from rock. ==Equipment== Schematic of bench and industrial-scale ultrasonic liquid processors Substantial intensity of ultrasound and high ultrasonic vibration amplitudes are required for many processing applications, such as nano- crystallization, nano-emulsification, deagglomeration, extraction, cell disruption, as well as many others. Commonly, a process is first tested on a laboratory scale to prove feasibility and establish some of the required ultrasonic exposure parameters. After this phase is complete, the process is transferred to a pilot (bench) scale for flow-through pre-production optimization and then to an industrial scale for continuous production. During these scale-up steps, it is essential to make sure that all local exposure conditions (ultrasonic amplitude, cavitation intensity, time spent in the active cavitation zone, etc.) stay the same. If this condition is met, the quality of the final product remains at the optimized level, while the productivity is increased by a predictable \\"scale-up factor\\". The productivity increase results from the fact that laboratory, bench and industrial-scale ultrasonic processor systems incorporate progressively larger ultrasonic horns, able to generate progressively larger high-intensity cavitation zones and, therefore, to process more material per unit of time. This is called \\"direct scalability\\". It is important to point out that increasing the power capacity of the ultrasonic processor alone does not result in direct scalability, since it may be (and frequently is) accompanied by a reduction in the ultrasonic amplitude and cavitation intensity. During direct scale-up, all processing conditions must be maintained, while the power rating of the equipment is increased in order to enable the operation of a larger ultrasonic horn.Peshkovsky, S.L. and Peshkovsky, A.S., \\"Matching a transducer to water at cavitation: Acoustic horn design principles\\", Ultrason. Sonochem., 2007. 14: p. 314‚Äì322.A.S. Peshkovsky, S.L.

It has not been adapted for the 6th edition HERO rules introduced in 2009. ==History== Steven S. Long wrote the subgenre book Dark Champions (1993), as well as several additional sourcebooks supporting it. Hero Games later released the modern action game Dark Champions (2004). Dark Champions only had a handful of releases, ending with Dark Champions: The Animated Series (2005), the new Hero Games's first subgenre book. ==Contents== When the original Dark Champions book was published in the early 1990s, its focus was on dark vigilantes in a superhero or almost- superhero setting, focusing on adventures similar to those of Batman, the Punisher, and others. The edition provoked some controversy upon its release because of an emphasis on The Harbinger of Justice, an extraordinarily powerful and murderous vigilante who was the setting's signature character. The second edition, published in 2004, emphasizes general action-adventure scenarios such as one might find in the adventures of James Bond, Lara Croft, The A-Team, the Die Hard and Lethal Weapon movies, and so forth, though costumed vigilantes are still considered a subgenre (given detail in a supplement, Dark Champions: The Animated Series). Harbinger still appears but is somewhat de-emphasized. Dark Champions also introduced the Hudson City campaign setting, which has been expanded with further supplements. ==Reviews== *Challenge #75 (1994) *White Wolf #37 (July/Aug., 1993) ==References== Category:Hero System Category:Contemporary role-playing games Category:Year of introduction missing ","title":"Dark Champions"},{"id":"2226421","text":"Olivier Bernard (born 14 October 1979) is a French former footballer. He announced his retirement after leaving Newcastle United on 16 May 2007. He is currently the owner and CEO of Durham City. ==Club careerNewcastle United=== Bernard made his name during his first spell with Newcastle United, after joining on a free transfer from Lyon in late-August 2000. He had an evolving career with the Magpies between 2000 and 2005, even though he was at Darlington on loan in the 2000‚Äì01 season. He formed a strong left flank partnership with fellow Frenchman Laurent Robert, being a part of Bobby Robson's side, which finished fourth, third and fifth as well as reaching the knockout rounds of the Champions League and the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup. He was a regular starter at the beginning of the 2004‚Äì05 season, but Robson was sacked on 28 August 2004 and replaced by Graeme Souness, who made drastic changes at the club, cutting star players like Craig Bellamy and Laurent Robert. ===Southampton=== After a dispute over contract negotiations, Bernard left Newcastle on 31 January 2005 to join Southampton on a five-month contract. When Southampton were relegated to the Championship in 2005, Bernard's contract expired and was not renewed by the club. ===Rangers=== After leaving Southampton, Bernard signed a two-year deal with Rangers on 1 September 2005, after turning down potential moves back to the Premier League with Birmingham City and Bolton Wanderers. He cited the prospect of playing in the Champions League once again was a driving force for his move. After just one season with Rangers, and only nine league appearances, he was released after being made surplus to requirements by new manager Paul Le Guen. ===Return to Newcastle United=== Newcastle fans had mixed opinions when Bernard re-signed for them on 1 September 2006 after reneging on an agreement to join Leeds United. However, his second spell on Tyneside did not turn out as well as hoped, with Bernard struggling for fitness and a series of niggling injuries preventing him from making his second debut for Newcastle. The latest injury was reported to be a hip injury. He made numerous reserve team outings, and was an unused substitute in some UEFA Cup fixtures, including away to Palermo and Levadia Tallinn. He never made an appearance for Newcastle during his injury hampered spell. As a result of this, on 16 May 2007 it was announced that, following the appointment of Sam Allardyce as Newcastle boss Bernard, along with Titus Bramble, Oguchi Onyewu, Craig Moore, and Pavel Srn√≠ƒçek would not be playing for the side the following season having been released from their contracts. He trained with Toronto FC to keep his fitness up in June 2008, mainly because he is friends with former Toronto midfielder Laurent Robert. ==Retirement== Bernard retired from football due to a hip injury. In a 2011 interview, he criticised manager Graeme Souness's man management and blamed him for the death of his career. Bernard's injury will require an operation eventually, but he is prolonging it despite the pain. He may never be able to run or have full mobility again- living with a limp for the rest of his life is almost a certainty . He now fights racism in football as a prominent memberShow Racism the Red Card and has recently appeared on Sky Sports News expressing his views on the 'Suarez/Evra dispute' and stating his displeasure at the consequent actions of the Liverpool players. ==Durham City ownership== In December 2013 it was announced that Bernard had purchased non- league Durham City and become owner and chairman of the club. On buying the club, Bernard stated \\"I want to make Durham one of the best feeder clubs in the north east. At the moment, I don't think the area develops enough youngsters. I want to raise the profile of the club and get links with Sunderland, Newcastle and Middlesbrough. Look at the England team, how many of them are from around here?

Brewer, and is a graduate of Swartz Creek High School. ==Early career== Brewer started his first band, called 'The Red Devils', at the age of 12. After leaving 'The Red Devils', Brewer formed another band named the 'Jazzmasters' for whom he played drums and sang. In 1964, Brewer joined former DJ Terry Knight as well as bassist Herm Jackson, guitarist Curt Johnson, and keyboardist Bobby Caldwell and formed the band Terry Knight and the Pack. In 1966, he experienced his first top 40 hit with \\"I (Who Have Nothing)\\".http://www.grandfunkrailroad.com/bios/Don_bio.html In 1967, Brewer met guitarist Mark Farner who joined the band after Johnson left. ==Grand Funk Railroad== Brewer in 1970 In 1968, Brewer left Terry Knight and the Pack along with bandmate Mark Farner and recruited Mel Schacher, the bassist for the hit band ? and the Mysterians, and formed Grand Funk Railroad. They hired Terry Knight as their manager. In 1973, Grand Funk released the album We're an American Band, featuring the hit song \\"We're an American Band\\". This track, written and sung by Brewer, was the band's first #1 single. Still popular, the song has since been recorded by other artists. In addition to playing drums for Grand Funk, Brewer also provided lead vocals for a number of songs. This is evidenced by the first and third verses of the song \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" (1974). Brewer was the baritone lead singer for the group, in contrast to the tenor vocals of Mark Farner. In 1977, following the initial breakup of Grand Funk, Brewer and former Grand Funk bandmates Mel Schacher and Craig Frost formed a new band named 'Flint'. Flint released one self-titled album in 1978 before disbanding. He also continued in other musical endeavors, including producing for the band The Godz (from Columbus, Ohio) their self- titled debut album The Godz in 1978. In 1981, Brewer and Farner resurrected Grand Funk for the album Grand Funk Lives that cracked the Billboard albums chart. Two years later, they split again and Brewer joined Bob Seger's Silver Bullet Band. In 1996 Brewer, Schacher, and Farner reunited as Grand Funk, and were eventually named one of Pollstar's top-grossing acts of 1998. Farner decided to leave the band at the end of 1998 to resume his solo career. In 2000, Brewer and Schacher added vocalist Max Carl, former Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick and keyboardist Tim Cashion to the line-up. This band has been touring the U.S. and Canada playing about 40 shows per year. ==Other drumming== Brewer played the bongo on Frank Zappa's song \\"Let Me Take You to the Beach\\" from the album Studio Tan, released in 1978. Brewer was featured in Classic Rock Drum Solos DVD (2007), performing a solo from when he and Grand Funk Railroad sold out Shea Stadium in 1971. In 2000, Don performed as a guest clinician at Modern Drummer Magazine's annual Drum Festival event, where he was honored as one of the most influential drummers in the history of rock. In 2006 Brewer rejoined Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band for their 2006‚Äì07 tour; it was his first appearance with the band since he played for them on their 1983 tour. He also played with them on Seger's 2011 tour. He also played drums during Bob Seger's 2014-2015 Ride Out concert tour throughout the United States. ==Personal life== Brewer lives in Jupiter, Florida, with his wife Sunny Quinn, together since 1985. They have two daughters, and five grandchildren.http://www.grandfunkrailroad.com/bios/Don_bio.html ==References== Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:American rock drummers Category:Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band members Category:Florida Atlantic University alumni Category:Grand Funk Railroad members Category:Musicians from Flint, Michigan Category:20th-century American drummers Category:American male drummers Category:Terry Knight and the Pack members Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Don Brewer"},{"id":"2226424","text":"The Swaziland Communist Party (SWACOPA) was a communist party in Swaziland.

The work is widely considered a gem of medieval Japanese literature and one of the three representative works of the zuihitsu genre, along with Makura no S≈çshi and the H≈çj≈çki. ==Structure and Content== Tsurezuregusa comprises a preface and 243 passages (ÊÆµ, dan), varying in length from a single line to a few pages. Kenk≈ç, being a Buddhist monk, writes about Buddhist truths, and themes such as death and impermanence prevail in the work, although it also contains passages devoted to the beauty of nature as well as some accounts of humorous incidents. The original work was not divided or numbered; the division can be traced to the 17th century. The work takes its title from its prefatory passage: > „Å§„Çå„Å•„Çå„Å™„Çã„Åæ„Çù„Å´Êó•ÊöÆ„Çâ„ÅóÁ°Ø„Å´„ÇÄ„Åã„Å≤„Å¶ÂøÉ„Å´„ÅÜ„Å§„Çä„ÇÜ„Åè„Çà„Åó„Å™„Åó‰∫ã„Çí„Åù„Åì„ÅØ„Åã„Å®„Å™„ÅèÊõ∏„Åç„Å§„Åè„Çå„Å∞„ÅÇ„ÇÑ„Åó„ÅÜ„Åì„Åù„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Åê„Çã„Åª„Åó„Åë„Çå > Tsurezurenaru mama ni, hikurashi, suzuri ni mukaite, kokoro ni utsuriyuku > yoshinashigoto wo, sokowakatonaku kakitsukureba, ayash≈´ koso > monoguruoshikere. In Keene's translation: > What a strange, demented feeling it gives me when I realise I have spent > whole days before this inkstone, with nothing better to do, jotting down at > random whatever nonsensical thoughts that have entered my head. Here „Å§„Çå„Å•„Çå (tsurezure) means ‚Äúhaving nothing to do.‚Äù For comparison, Sansom's translation: > To while away the idle hours, seated the livelong day before the inkslab, by > jotting down without order or purpose whatever trifling thoughts pass > through my mind, truly this is a queer and crazy thing to do! ==Mystery of the Origin== Despite the distinguished work of Kenk≈ç being continually held in high regard among many and considered a classic since the 17th century, the origin to the publication of Kenk≈ç's work is unclear. Many people have speculated different theories to the arrival of his work, however, little is known to the exact manner of how the book itself was compiled and put together. One of the most popular beliefs held among the majority was concluded by Sanjonishi Saneeda (1511-1579), who stated that Kenk≈ç himself did not edit the 243 chapters of his work, but rather, simply wrote his thoughts on random scrap pieces of paper which he pasted to the walls of his cottage. It was then hypothesized that Kenk≈ç's friend, Imagawa Ryoshun, who was also a poet and general at that time, was the one who compiled the book together. After finding the notes on Kenk≈ç's wall, he had prudently removed the scraps and combined the pieces together with other essays of Kenk≈ç's which were found in possession by Kenk≈ç's former servant, and carefully arranged the notes into the order it is found in today. Modern critics today have rejected this account, skeptical of the possibility that any other individual aside from Kenk≈ç himself could have put together such an insightful piece of work. However, the oldest surviving texts of Tsurezuregusa have been found in the hands of Ryoshun's disciple, Shotetsu, making Sanjonishi's theory to become widely considered by people today. ==Theme of Impermanence== Throughout Tsurezuregusa, a consistent theme regarding the impermanence of life is noted in general as a significant principle in Kenk≈ç's work. Tsurezuregusa overall comprises this concept, making it a highly relatable work to many as it touches on the secular side among the overtly Buddhist beliefs mentioned in some chapters of the work. Kenk≈ç relates the impermanence of life to the beauty of nature in an insightful manner. Kenk≈ç sees the aesthetics of beauty in a different light: the beauty of nature lies in its impermanence. Within his work, Kenk≈ç quotes the poet Ton‚Äôa: ‚ÄúIt is only after the silk wrapper has frayed at top and bottom, and the mother-of-pearl has fallen from the roller, that a scroll looks beautiful.‚Äù In agreement with this statement, Kenk≈ç shows his support for an appreciation for the uncertain nature of things, and proposes the idea of how nothing last forever is a motivation for us to appreciate everything we have. Kenk≈ç himself states this in a similar manner in his work: ‚ÄúIf man were never to fade away like the dews of Adashino, never to vanish like the smoke over Toribeyama, but lingered on forever in this world, how things would lose their power to move us! The most precious thing in life is its uncertainty.‚Äù Kenk≈ç clearly states his point of view regarding the nature of things in life, and regards the perishability of objects to be moving. In relation to the concept of impermanence, his works links to the fondness of the irregular and incomplete, and the beginnings and ends of things. Kenk≈ç states: ‚ÄúIt is typical of the unintelligent man to insist on assembling complete sets of everything. Imperfect sets are better.‚Äù ‚ÄúBranches about to blossom or gardens strewn with faded flowers are worthier of our admiration. In all things, it is the beginnings and ends that are interesting.‚Äù Within his work, Kenk≈ç shows the relation of impermanence to the balance of things in life. Beginnings and ends relate to the impermanence of things, and it is because of its impermanence that beginnings and ends are interesting and should be valued. Irregularity and incompleteness of collections and works show the potential for growth and improvement, and the impermanence of its state provides a moving framework towards appreciation towards life. Kenk≈ç's work predominantly reveals these themes, providing his thoughts set out in short essays of work. Although his concept of impermanence is based upon his personal beliefs, these themes provide a basic concept relatable among many, making it an important classical literature resonating throughout Japanese high school curriculum today. ==Translations== The definitive English translation is by Donald Keene (1967). In his preface Keene states that, of the six or so earlier translations into English and German, that by G. B. Sansom is the most distinguished. It was published by the Asiatic Society of Japan in 1911 as The Tsuredzure Gusa of Yoshida No Kaneyoshi: Being the Meditations of a Recluse in the 14th Century. ==Sources== *Chance, Linda H (1997).

The construction of a large steel plant and port facility was meant to bring income and jobs to Calabria. Until then Gioia Tauro had been a productive and beautiful agricultural area. Profitable farms and olive groves were expropriated and demolished. The 'Ndrangheta, a Mafia-type criminal organisation based in Calabria, and in particular the Piromalli clan, exploited the construction of the steelworks until the project was abandoned in 1979, when the crisis in the steel industry could no longer be ignored and the government decided there was no economic basis for it. In the meantime some 1,000 people were killed in conflicts over construction contracts. For a while the homicide rate of Gioia Tauro, was higher than that of New York City.Spotts & Wieser, Italy, a Difficult Democracy, p. 186 Following this, a proposed electrical energy power station was never built, due to environmental problems. Gioia Tauro became an example of the failure that characterized much of the development of Italy's South as \\"industrialisation without development.\\"Spotts & Wieser, Italy, a Difficult Democracy, p. 236 ==Gioia Tauro seaport== The seaport has seven loading docks with an extension of ; it is the largest in Italy and the seventh-largest container port in Europe, with a 2007 throughput of s from more than 3,000 ships. In 2018 the port was in eighth place for EU container traffic, on a higher throughput of In 2002 more than one-third of national traffic went through the seaport; it specializes in transshipment activities, replacing the port of Malta as the node for overseas traffic to and from the US and the Far East. The Medcenter Container Terminal (Medcenter, Contship) is the main operator working in the port. ==='Ndrangheta control of port=== According to a 2006 report, Italian investigators estimate that 80% of Europe's cocaine arrives from Colombia via Gioia Tauro's docks. The port is also involved in the illegal arms trade. These activities are controlled by the 'Ndrangheta.Bitter harvest, The Guardian, December 19, 2006 In 2014 the US FBI and the Italian police made arrests in a joint operation aimed at smashing a new trafficking route for drugs and weapons that officials said had brought together the Gambino crime family of New York and the 'Ndrangheta. It was alleged that representatives of the criminal organisations discussed plans to ship cocaine and heroin from Gioia Tauro to the United States, selling more than of heroin to an FBI undercover agent, thinking it would be distributed across the United States. A mafia expert said that the US mafia understood that the Sicilian Cosa Nostra had been so weakened that it allowed the 'Ndrangheta to rise.Guardian newspaper:Police break transatlantic network of US and Italian crime families, 1 February 2014 ‚ÄúIn the 1970s, the Christian Democratic Italian Government (with the active encouragement of the left) appropriated (and wasted) tens of billions of dollars to build one of the country‚Äôs largest steel plants in Calabria, but the project was abandoned because of a crisis in the steel industry.... ‚ÄúThe government ultimately completed construction of a huge seaport at Gioia Tauro (the sixth largest in the Mediterranean) which was originally meant to service the steel plant....[Alex] Perry [in his book, ‚ÄúThe Good Mothers: The True Story of the Women Who Took on the World‚Äôs Most Powerful Mafia,‚Äù William Morrow publishers, 2018] notes that ‚Äòthe railway that connected Gioia Tauro to Europe stopped 1.5 kilometers short of the port, meaning all the cargo‚Äô ‚Äî legal and illegal ‚Äî ‚Äòfrom one of the biggest Mediterranean container ports had to be loaded onto mafia-owned trucks and driven three minutes to the station.‚Äô The port‚Äôs legitimate business has struggled in recent years, no doubt a result of Mafia control.‚Äù ‚ÄúBreaking the Silence in Calabria,‚Äù Alexander Stille, The New York Review of Books, Vol. LXVI, No. 16 (October 24, 2019) The Piromalli-Mol√® clan managed to condition the management of the new container terminal. Established in the mid-1990s, it became the largest terminal in the Mediterranean, moving over 2 million containers in 1998. Since 1994, when Contship Italia rented the port area to start transshipment activity and the Medcenter Container Terminal was set up thanks to 138 billion lire (about US$86 million) in state financing, the Piromallis aimed to oblige the Medcenter company, through its vice president Walter Lugli, and the Contship company, through its president Enrico Ravano, to pay a kickback of US$1.50 for each transshipped container, about half of the net profits earned by the two companies.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, p. 218 Il caso Gioia Tauro, Relazione sullo stato della lotta alla criminalit√† organizzata in Calabria, Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul fenomeno della mafia e delle altre associazioni criminali similari, July 2000 In February 2008 the parliamentary Antimafia Commission concluded that the 'Ndrangheta \\"controls or influences a large part of the economic activity around the port and uses the facility as a base for illegal trafficking.\\" In its report it said that \\"the entire gamma of internal or sub-contracted activities is mafia-influenced, from the management of distribution and forwarding to customs control and container storage.\\" The extortion of Ravano and Contship was part of a project that \\"did not involve simply this security tax, which grew with the port, but also control of activities tied to the port, the hiring of workers, and relations with port unions and local institutions\\". \\"It effectively eliminated legitimate competition from companies not influenced or controlled by the mafia in providing goods and services, performing construction work and hiring personnel. And it threw a shadow over the behaviour of local government and other public bodies.\\"Gioia Tauro 'controlled by mafia for over a decade', Lloyd‚Äôs List, February 21, 2008 Relazione annuale sulla 'ndrangheta, Commissione parlamentare di inchiesta sul fenomeno della criminalit√† organizzata mafiosa o similare (Relatore: Francesco Forgione), February 2008 =='Ndrangheta infiltration of city council== The city council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved in 1991 because of infiltration by the 'Ndrangheta. In April 2008, it was dissolved for the second time for the same reason. Sciolto Consiglio comunale di Gioia Tauro, Corriere della Sera, April 22, 2008 The town is home to several 'ndrine, such as the Alvaro, Mammoliti, Mol√®, and Piromalli families. Gioia Tauro's former mayor and deputy mayor, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, were arrested on mafia charges on October 13, 2008. Both had been forced to step down in April, when the city council was dissolved on suspicion of mafia infiltration. 'Ndrangheta boss Gioacchino Piromalli was arrested as well, along with his nephew, also named Gioacchino Piromalli, who is a lawyer. The mayors were accused of employing the younger Piromalli. Police believe the legal work was a front to enable the Piromallis to regain a slice of the business generated by the port of Gioia Tauro.Mayors, mobsters in 'Ndrangheta op, ANSA, October 13, 2008 ==Notable people== * Stesichorus ‚Äì ancient poet * Nick Nostro ‚Äì film director ==Winds== * Sirocco, a hot, dry wind originating in Sahara Desert (southeasterly) * Libeccio, very dangerous for shippers (to be avoided; southwesterly) * Mistral (Ponente), the predominant and quiet wind (northwesterly) == Demographic evolution == Colors= id:lightgrey value:gray(0.9) id:darkgrey value:gray(0.8) id:sfondo value:rgb(1,1,1) id:barra value:rgb(0.6,0.7,0.8) ImageSize = width:500 height:400 PlotArea = left:50 bottom:50 top:30 right:30 DateFormat = x.y Period = from:0 till:20000 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical AlignBars = justify ScaleMajor = gridcolor:darkgrey increment:5000 start:0 ScaleMinor = gridcolor:lightgrey increment:1000 start:0 BackgroundColors = canvas:sfondo BarData= bar:1861 text:1861 bar:1871 text:1871 bar:1881 text:1881 bar:1901 text:1901 bar:1911 text:1911 bar:1921 text:1921 bar:1931 text:1931 bar:1936 text:1936 bar:1951 text:1951 bar:1961 text:1961 bar:1971 text:1971 bar:1981 text:1981 bar:1991 text:1991 bar:2001 text:2001 bar:2008 text:2008 PlotData= color:barra width:20 align:left bar:1861 from: 0 till:1364 bar:1871 from: 0 till:1754 bar:1881 from: 0 till:3174 bar:1901 from: 0 till:5764 bar:1911 from: 0 till:7208 bar:1921 from: 0 till:8289 bar:1931 from: 0 till:9465 bar:1936 from: 0 till:10811 bar:1951 from: 0 till:13894 bar:1961 from: 0 till:13912 bar:1971 from: 0 till:15016 bar:1981 from: 0 till:17488 bar:1991 from: 0 till:18484 bar:2001 from: 0 till:17762 bar:2008 from: 0 till:18367 PlotData= bar:1861 at:1364 fontsize:XS text:1,364 shift:(-8,5) bar:1871 at:1754 fontsize:XS text:1,754 shift:(-8,5) bar:1881 at:3174 fontsize:XS text:3,174 shift:(-8,5) bar:1901 at:5764 fontsize:XS text:5,764 shift:(-8,5) bar:1911 at:7208 fontsize:XS text:7,208 shift:(-8,5) bar:1921 at:8289 fontsize:XS text:8,289 shift:(-8,5) bar:1931 at:9465 fontsize:XS text:9,465 shift:(-8,5) bar:1936 at:10811 fontsize:XS text:10,811 shift:(-8,5) bar:1951 at:13894 fontsize:XS text:13,894 shift:(-8,5) bar:1961 at:13912 fontsize:XS text:13,912 shift:(-8,5) bar:1971 at:15016 fontsize:XS text:15,016 shift:(-8,5) bar:1981 at:17488 fontsize:XS text:17,488 shift:(-8,5) bar:1991 at:18484 fontsize:XS text:18,484 shift:(-8,5) bar:2001 at:17762 fontsize:XS text:17,762 shift:(-8,5) bar:2008 at:18367 fontsize:XS text:18,367 shift:(-8,5) TextData= fontsize:S pos:(20,20) text:Data from ISTAT ==References== * Paoli, Letizia (2003).

The division was composed primarily of Hungarian Army Volksdeutsche conscripts who were transferred to the Waffen-SS following an agreement between Germany and Hungary. The division is commonly known under the Maria Theresia name in publications, although no documents have been found to confirm this name. Jan- Hendrik Wendler: 22. ochotnicza dywizja kawalerii SS (22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division) in: \\"Militaria XX Wieku\\" No. 4/2009(31), pp. 74‚Äì75 ==HistoryFormation and training=== In December 1943, the 17th SS-Cavalry Regiment from the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer was ordered to become the cadre for a new SS cavalry division. On 29 April 1944, the SS- F√ºhrungshauptamt authorised the division to be raised on basis of the 17th SS- Cavalry Regiment. The unit was sent to Kisb√©r in Hungary to begin forming the new division. While personnel from the Florian Geyer formed the nucleus of the division, the bulk of the troops were Hungarian Volksdeutsche (ethnic German) conscripts, transferred to the Waffen-SS following an agreement between Germany and Hungary. The division was designated the 22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division Maria Theresia. The title referred to Maria Theresa, who had ruled Austria, Hungary and Bohemia in the 18th century. The symbol of the division, a cornflower, was emblazoned on the divisional shield. However, some authors claim that the division was always referred-to in official documents as the 22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division, and there are no records that would officially confirm it being named Maria Theresia. Over the next months, the division continued its organization and training in Kisber, Gy≈ër and Budapest, equipped with mostly Hungarian weapons, vehicles and equipment. By June 1944, the divisional strength reached 4,900. In early August Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) ordered all divisions forming up in Hungary to send units to the combat zone. The 52nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Regiment entrained for the front in Romania, while the 17th SS Volunteer Cavalry Regiment remained in Hungary to train the rest of the division. ===Romania=== Kampfgruppe Wiedemann consisted of SS Volunteer Cavalry Regiment 52 with attached artillery, Flak and reconnaissance elements. The Kampfgruppe was transported from Gyula-Szalonta, Hungary to Arad, Romania, where it was attached to General der Panzertruppe Hermann Breith's III Panzer Corps, stationed in the area around Debrecen. Elements of the division went into the line on 30 September, forming a defensive ring around the city of Arad along with the Hungarian 9th Infantry Division. On 2 October, the Soviet spearheads of Marshal Rodion Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front began probing towards Arad. On 6 October, Malinovsky launched a major offensive, thus beginning the Battle of Debrecen. Units of the division were quickly outflanked and encircled. The second echelon of Soviet forces sought to destroy the pocket; on 8 October it was split in two. One unit broke out however, with troops swimming across the Harmas river to German lines on the other side. On 30 October the remaining 48 survivors, after a 200-mile trek across enemy territory, linked up with German forces at the town of Dunaf√∂ldv√°r, south of Budapest. ===Operation Panzerfaust - Budapest=== In mid-October 1944, pro-German Honv√©ds√©g officers had revealed that the Hungarian Regent, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy, was negotiating a secret surrender to the Soviets. Hitler sent SS-Obersturmbannf√ºher Otto Skorzeny to deal with the problem. Skorzeny commandeered all available elements of the Maria Theresia to take part in Operation Panzerfaust, which began at 0600 on 15 October. In little over half an hour, a German column led by four Tiger IIs, including a number of Maria Theresia men, stormed Buda Castle and forced Horthy to abdicate. Simultaneously, Operation Panzerfaust resulted in the forced detainment of Horthy's youngest son, the pro-peace Nicholas Horthy. Pro-German Arrow Cross leader Ferenc Sz√°lasi replaced Horthy, negotiations were broken off and Hungary remained in the war. The battle-ready units of the division were assigned to the IX SS Mountain Corps, which was deployed in Budapest. The division arrived in early November 1944 and took up defensive positions. There it was encircled along with the rest of the Axis troops in the Hungarian capital and destroyed. Only some 170 men got out of the encirclement. The survivors, along with those who had not been sent to Budapest, were used to form the 37th SS Volunteer Cavalry Division L√ºtzow, with the remnants of the Flak units being transferred to 32nd SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division 30 Januar. ==Commanders== * SS-Brigadef√ºhrer August Zehender (21 Apr 1944 - 11 Feb 1945) ==Order of Battle, Budapest Jan 1945== * 52nd SS Cavalry Regiment * 53rd SS Cavalry Regiment * 54th SS Cavalry Regiment * 17th SS Cavalry Regiment * 22nd SS Artillery Regiment * 22nd SS Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion * 22nd SS Panzer J√§ger Battalion * 22nd SS Pionier Battalion * 22nd SS Nachrichten Battalion * 22nd SS Division Nachschubtruppen * 22nd SS Verwaltungstruppen Battalion * 22nd SS Sanit√§ts Battalion ==References== *The Florian Geyer Division by Charles Trang #22 2*22 Category:Military units and formations established in 1943 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1945 ","title":"22nd SS Volunteer Cavalry Division Maria Theresia"},{"id":"2226475","text":"AllianceBernstein Holding L.P.

In 1997, the bank entered the capital market with an initial public offering of 1,360,000 shares at a premium of Rs. 440 per share. For the year 2015-16 the net profit of the company was Rs. 8.5 billion.http://info.shine.com/Company/State-Bank-of-Bikaner-and- Jaipur/373.aspx Company Overview: State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipurhttp://sbbjbank.com/About-Us/history.htm SBBJ History ==History== State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur came into existence on 1963 when two banks, namely, State Bank of Bikaner (established in 1944) and State Bank of Jaipur (established in 1943), were merged. Both these banks were subsidiaries of the State Bank of India under the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Bank) Act, 1959. On 25 April 1966 SBBJ took over Govind Bank (Private) Ltd., Mathura, established on 8 February 1963. In 1984 SBBJ sponsored and established Ganganagar Kshetriya Gramin Bank as a Regional Rural Bank. Thereafter, in 1985 SBBJ opened the Bikaner Kshetriya Gramin Bank, the second Regional Rural Bank sponsored by it. The third Regional Rural Bank, sponsored by SBBJ was Marwar Gramin Bank, which covered the districts of Pali, Jalore and Sirohi. On 12 June 2006, SBBJ merged all three regional rural banks that it sponsored under the name MGB Gramin Bank, with headquarters in Jodhpur. The plans to make SBI one of the top 50 banks in India affected SBBJ very much. In 2016, the plan to merge SBBJ with its five co-subsidiaries was made, and it was ratified by the Government of India on 15 February 2017. It finally merged with SBI on 31 March 2017. ==References * SBBJ official website Category:State Bank of India Category:Banks established in 1963 Category:Companies based in Rajasthan Category:Economy of Jaipur Category:Defunct banks of India ","title":"State Bank of Bikaner &amp; Jaipur"},{"id":"2226488","text":"Kenton. State Route 53 is a north-south state highway in the U.S. state of Ohio (physically northeast-southwest). Its southern terminus is at the beginning of the U.S. 68/S.R. 67 concurrency in Kenton, Ohio, and its northern terminus is on Catawba Island in Ottawa County, north of Port Clinton. ==Route description== From Kenton, State Route 53 moves northeast to Forest, then continues eastward to Upper Sandusky. It then moves north through the small towns of Tymochtee and McCutchenville before entering Tiffin. The route then moves due north to Fremont, where it joins a four-route bypass around the city with U.S. Routes 6 and 20 and State Route 19. From its northern bypass interchange, it continues on a northeast heading, following the northern coastline of Sandusky Bay to Port Clinton, where it joins State Route 2 on a bypass around that city. From its eastern bypass interchange, State Route 53 heads north onto Catawba Island. ==History== State Route 53 was an original state highway which stretched from the Ohio River at Higginsport to Port Clinton. The route followed that of current State Route 221 to Georgetown, then followed the route currently followed by U.S. Route 68 to Kenton, then along its current route into Port Clinton. The route entered Port Clinton and truncated at State Route 163. Before the Fremont bypass was certified, State Route 53 was routed along the Sandusky River through Old Fort into Fremont. In 1929, State Route 53 was routed through the town of St. Martin, a town it originally bypassed. This reroute was reversed in 1931 and is now State Route 251. In 1933, State Route 53's southern terminus was moved to Kenton when U.S. Route 68 was certified. In 1946, State Route 53's northern terminus was extended to Catawba Island. It shared a route with State Route 163 for approximately five miles, then split north to the island. This route was formerly the southern portion of State Route 357. In 1969, State Route 53 was routed along the State Route 2 bypass with an interchange approximately south of its split with State Route 163. ==Major junctionsReferences== 053 Category:Transportation in Hardin County, Ohio Category:Transportation in Wyandot County, Ohio Category:Transportation in Seneca County, Ohio Category:Transportation in Sandusky County, Ohio Category:Transportation in Ottawa County, Ohio ","title":"Ohio State Route 53"},{"id":"2226500","text":"Comparison of the four major styles of The Chi Wara / Chiwara / Chi-Wara mask of the Bambara people of Mali. Left to right Abstract / Bougouni / Southern region style, Vertical/ Segu/ Northern region style, the Horizontal / Bamako / Northern region style, and the Abstract / Sikasso region style. Two Chiwara at the Art Institute of Chicago. Female (left) and male Vertical styles. A Chiwara (also Chi wara, Ci Wara, or Tyi Wara; ; ) is a ritual object representing an antelope, used by the Bambara ethnic group in Mali. The Chiwara initiation society uses Chiwara masks, as well as dances and rituals associated primarily with agriculture, to teach young Bamana men social values as well as agricultural techniques. == Stylistic variations == Chiwara masks are categorized in three ways: horizontal, vertical, or abstract. In addition, Chiwara can be either male or female. Female Chiwara masks are denoted by the presence of a baby antelope and straight horns. Male Chiwara masks have bent horns and a phallus. The sex of a Chiwara mask is much clearer on horizontal and vertical masks while abstract masks tend to be difficult to classify. The appearance of the Chiwara form varies greatly both by region and time produced. Specific master wood carvers also subtly modified the accepted (or even religiously mandated) local forms, forming a distinct \\"signature\\" or \\"school\\" of Chiwara figures.Allen Wardwell (November 1984) A Bambara Master Carver, African Arts, 18(1):pp83‚Äì84. These regional variations have been roughly assigned the stylistic categories above. Thus the Bougouni / Southern region style are an amalgam of several animal motifs combined in the same work, in an abstract style; the Bamako / Northern region style is usually of the horizontal style; the Segu/ Northern region style (the heartland of the Bambara Empire) matches the vertical style with the unique \\"cut out\\" triangular body motif of the males. Other regional styles have been proposed, including the Sikasso region style, with a thin, delicate, vertical form within almost human, snoutless face.See descriptions at Ciwara, African chimeras. Exhibition, Mus√©e du quai Branly, Paris. 23 June ‚Äì 17 December 2006 . and see the galleries at Hamill Gallery:Bamana Chi Wara. ==Ceremonial usage== In Bambara, chi wara means laboring wild animal,Elisabeth Salzhauer Axel, Nina Sobol Levent (2003) and is a representation of Bambara mythos about the creation of farming. === Mousso Koroni === While there are several versions of the story, the discovery of agriculture is credited to the hero Chi Wara, a half antelope, half human figure born from the union of the sky goddess Mousso Koroni and an earth spirit in the shape of a cobra. The Chi Wara came to earth to teach humans to sow crops, and thus is honored at both sowing and harvest festivals. === The Chi Wara figure === The Chi Wara itself is usually represented as a Roan Antelope with an almost human face, but also takes shapes of other creatures and emblems of farming. The hero descends from the sky goddess, and thus represents the sun, its body is often elongated and short legged to represent the aardvark who burrows into the earth like a farmer. Its high horns echo the stalks of millet, and it stands on a dancer clad in a mass of raffia stalks to represent both flowing water and a bountiful harvest. The zig-zag patterns echo the movement of the sun across the sky, and the penis of the male figure stands low to the ground, fertilizing the earth. The Chi Wara figures always appear as a male/female pair, combining the elements of fertility of humans with fertility of the earth. The female figure usually carries a young antelope on her back, and is said to represent human beings carried by the Chi Wara hero, as well as a newborn human carried on a mother's back. ===chi wara ton=== As farmers of the upper Niger river savanna, the blessing of agriculture is of central importance to Bambara society. These traditions survive in part because the Bambara were one of the last cultures in the area to embrace Islam, after the fall of the Bambara Empire in the late 19th century. Bambara culture has traditionally had a strict set of age and caste fraternities (ton/jo/jow), and the chi wara ton society is one of the more important. It gathers all young adult males of the Soli age group to work the fields at clearing, sowing and harvest, when the greatest number of laborers is needed. Secret teachings of the chi wara ton pass the needed skills for this work, upon which the very survival of the community depends. The chi wara ton is also the only major Bambara society which includes both sexes. Women's labor is needed for agriculture, just as both sexes are needed for human reproduction. === Dance === The Chi Wara is always danced with each wooden figure attached to a basket on the dancer's head, and the body covered in a huge pile of raffia. Often the face is obscured with raffia that has been colored or decorated, and the dancer carries a long staff. The figures are always in one or more male/female pairs, with the female usually dancing behind the male, fanning him and spreading his powers into the gathered community. The Male figures leap to represent the antelope, and then scratch the earth with their staves or horns as the Chi Wara teaches humans to cultivate crops. In some communities the Mousso Koroni figure also appears. Initiated children wear a \\"Sogono Kuni\\" (\\"Little antelope head\\"), which is quite rare to find in museums. princetonol.com: Chi Wara Headdress of the Bamana . This provides much greater detail and sources, while University of Virginia. ART IN CONTEXT: How is the Chi Wara Used? and Humboldt State University: gallery of Chi Wara and other Bambara dancers , show images of the full ceremony. == World influence == African sculptural forms became fashionable amongst European artists and collectors at the beginning of the Twentieth century, and the Chiwara, especially in its more abstract forms, became one of the icons of what Europeans called Primitive Art. The artist Guillaume Apollinaire and collector Paul Guillaume published images of the Chiwara in their Sculptures n√®gres in 1917, while Picasso, Braque, and Les Fauves became fascinated with African sculpture and masks in general, and the Chiwara figure in particular.Some examples of French studies of African sculpture among the artists, critics, and collectors of Modern Art include: √Ä propos d'art n√®gre by Guillaume Apollinaire; Opinions sur l'art n√®gre with contributions by Braque, Matisse, and Picasso; Rencontre avec l'art n√®gre by Jean Laude; La Sculpture n√®gre et l'art moderne by Paul Guillaume; and L'art n√®gre by Henri Clouzot and Andr√© Level. A vertical, male, semi-abstracted Chiwara figure was included in the 1935 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibit African Negro Art, and the Masterpieces of African Art at the Brooklyn Museum in 1954, (as well as shows in LondonThe Sculptor Henry Moore singles out the Chiwara in a review of a 1951 London show.

Alongside the Bren, Scout and Machine Gun Carriers, they also moved infantry support weapons. ==Design and development== The Loyd Carrier was built upon the mechanicals (engine, gearbox and transmission) of a 15 cwt 4x2 Fordson 7V truck with mild steel bodywork to which armour plate - 'BP Plate' (from \\"Bullet Proof\\") - was bolted (to the front and upper sides) depending on application. The engine was at the rear of the Carrier with the radiator behind rather than in front. The transmission then took the drive forward to the axle at the very front where it drove the tracks. Both the front drive sprockets and idlers (which were also sprocketed) at the rear of the tracks were fitted with brakes, actuated by a pair of levers by the driver. To turn the vehicle to the left, the brakes were applied on that side and the Carrier would slew round the stopped track. The upper hull covered the front and sides but was open to the rear and above; as the Carrier was not expected to function as a fighting vehicle, this was not an issue. To protect the occupants from the weather, a canvas tilt could be put up; this was standard fitment from the factory. PartsBook As part of the rapid development program, the Loyd used parts from other vehicles: From the Universal Carrier, the track, drive sprockets, and Horstmann suspension units; from the Fordson 7V, the chassis, engine, gearbox, torque tube and front axle. The brake drums and back plates were designed specifically for the Loyd. The Army tested the Loyd Carrier in 1939 and placed an initial order for 200 as the Carrier, Tracked, Personnel Carrying i.e. a personnel carrier. Initial deliveries were from Vivian Loyd's own company, but production moved to the larger firms, including the Ford Motor Company and Wolseley Motors (13,000 between them) and Dennis Brothers Ltd, Aveling & Barford and Sentinel Waggon Works. Total production of the Loyd Carrier was approximately 26,000. ==ServiceSecond World War=== Early in the war, the TT along with the TPC variants were part of the standard equipment of Royal Engineer Chemical Warfare Companies. Most of the Chemical Warfare Companies were disbanded or repurposed in 1943 in order to free up their 4.2 inch mortars for desperately needed conventional use by infantry divisions in-theatre; the mortars and supporting equipment were attached to each division's machine-gun battalion in company strength. By far the most notable use of the Loyd was in the TT (Tracked Towing) configuration, where it pulled the 6 pounder anti-tank gun from the Normandy landings of 1944 through to the end of the war. There are many wartime photographs of Loyds in action in Normandy, and a number were photographed destroyed in the well-known battle of Villers-Bocage in 1944. The Loyd Carrier was also paired with Caterpillar D8 tractors in service with Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers for tank recovery - the Carrier carrying spare equipment for the tractor. ===Post-war=== A Belgian CATI 90 displayed in the Royal Military Museum Brussels (2010) Both Belgium and the Netherlands bought Loyd TTs from the British Army; they were still in Belgian Army ownership up to at least 1963 as engine rebuild plates have been seen with this date in original Belgian vehicles. A Belgian variant was the CATI 90 (Canon antitank d'infanterie automoteur 90mm), a self-propelled gun in use from 1954 to 1962. The vehicle served in infantry units with a paired ammunition carrier. Some vehicles were sold on into private ownership for farming use (a 1941 No1Mk1 TPC with a ploughing conversion still exists in Nottinghamshire, UK) and a number were placed as targets on Belgian ranges. ==Variants== Loyd carriers were available in three \\"numbers\\", which were available in two \\"marks\\"; all manufactured during wartime, and varied in the type/sourcing of the flathead Ford V8 they were powered with: * No. 1 - British Ford V8 engine (21 stud) and gearbox * No. 2 - US Ford V8 engine (24 stud) and gearbox * No. 3 - Ford Canada V8 engine (24 stud) and gearbox The two marks were: * Mark I - Bendix brake system * Mark II - Girling brake system === Roles === There were not many differences between variants, mainly seating and armour plate location: ;Tracked Personnel Carrier (TPC) :Equipped with a front bench seat and seating for troops on the track guards. Frontal and full side armour fitted. ;Tracked Towing (TT) - Initially known as 'Tractor Anti-tank, MkI' :Equipped with four single seats and ammunition stowage on the track guards. Used for towing the 4.2 inch mortar and hauling the QF 2 pounder and QF 6 pounder anti-tank guns and carrying its crew. Frontal and front quarter armour fitted. The main variant by number manufactured. ;Tracked Cable Layer Mechanical (TCLM) :A vehicle for Royal Corps of Signals work. No armour fitted. ;Tracked Starting and Charging (TS&C;) :Equipped with a front bench seat, 30 volt and 12 volt DC generators driven from the gearbox layshaft and battery sets to support armoured regiment tanks.

The building was built in the Art Deco style of the late 1920s by George Conrad Reifel and designed by architect H.H. Gillingham. Best known for showcasing special performances, the venue is also famous for its sprung dance floor, whose horsehair lining absorbs, rather than reflecting back, some of the impact of dancers' feet. At the time it was installed, only a few venues in the world had similar floors. The general-admission ballroom accommodates approximately 990 guests (including standing room and table seating). The building's street level was built for retail outlets, some of them in their time also notable. Downstairs, below street level, is the Commodore Lanes, a vintage bowling alley and poolroom. ==History== The building opened in December 1929 as the Commodore Cabaret.Commodore Ballroom Celebrates 75 Years With the onset of the Great Depression, the venue briefly closed four months later.

The winner was Joel Sherman of the United States.http://www.wscgames.com/1997/prizes.html ==Format== The World Scrabble Championship 1997 was held in the Stouffer Renaissance Mayflower Hotel, Washington, D.C., and was the second to be held in the United States. Eighty players played a Swiss tournament of twenty-one games each, with each player playing seven games on each of the first three days. The two top players from this tournament then played a best-of-five game final to decide who would be World Scrabble Champion 1997. Prize money was provided by the Milton Bradley Company, owned by the tournament's sponsor Hasbro, to a total value of $50,100. The winner received $25,000, the runner-up $10,000 and the remainder of the top twenty players received prizes down to $150. This was the first World Championship to have featured a live web site, a copy of which is now archived at the main WSC web site. ==Results== After the initial Swiss tournament, the top two players were Joel Sherman (16 wins, winning spread +829) and Matt Graham (15 wins, winning spread +993). Notably, all the top four players were representing the United States. This was particularly surprising since the WSC uses the SOWPODS wordlist, which includes many words not present in the traditional American wordlist, TWL 98. Graham took the first game of the finals 409-334 but lost a 387-363 squeaker in the second after missing BOWNED. In game three, Graham made another error when he played HERB instead of BERTH and Sherman took another close game, 419-405. In game four, Sherman got off to a big lead and began shutting down the board. Graham took a chance on FLEXERS for 101 points, but Sherman successfully challenged it off. Graham drew a rack full of consonants. Sherman won the game and was crowned World Scrabble Champion, after losing in the final two years earlier. ==Complete results== {  - bgcolor=\\"#ececec\\" !Position !Name !Country !Win-Loss !Spread !Prize (USD) -

They are nicknamed Tugs by rail enthusiasts. ==History== In the 1980s, British Rail determined there was a requirement for a high-powered Type 5 diesel locomotive for use on its Trainload Freight sector. On 10 August 1987, the British Railways Board issued a competitive tender for response by 7 November, for a fleet of 100 locomotives. Of the six companies invited to tender, only three bid responses were received: *Metro-Cammell - offered a Metro-Cammell body with an option of traction packages, many untried, and could not offer performance guarantees as stipulated by the tender *General Electric Company - a partnership with General Motors Electro Motive. They offered a state-of-the-art Class 59, built in the UK, probably at Crewe Works, which had an existing partnership for construction of the Class 91 electric locos *Brush Traction - offered a locomotive powered by either a Mirrlees or Ruston engine, and used separately excited (Sepex) traction control, as previously tested on the Class 58. Of the three bidders, Brush was selected, and an order was placed for 100 locomotives in a deal worth around ¬£120 million. Brush sub-contracted parts construction, with final construction at Brush's erecting shops at Loughborough. The bodyshells, shared with the Class 92 electric locomotives, were fabricated by Procor (UK) of Wakefield. The engine was a higher-powered development of the Mirrlees engine previously fitted experimentally to Class 37 nos. 37 901-37 904. The first locomotive was delivered in June 1989 and sent to Derby for testing, which revealed a number of teething problems. Parts requiring modifications included the axle box suspension and the Mirlees engine cylinder head. ==DesignBodywork=== Unlike the Classes 59 and 66 (solid girder underframe) the Class 60s have a monocoque stressed skin construction with diagonal trusses - with the external bodywork providing support for the internal components. Two different cab designs were considered and full size mock-ups were made in wood, plastic and metal by the Engineering Development Unit at the Railway Technical Centre in Derby. One of these had a French-style raked-forward cab end, similar to the SNCF Class CC 72000, but this was rejected in favour of a more conventional cab. ===Electrical=== The main alternator is a Brush BA1006A type, providing power for the traction motors via rectification circuits to DC, the auxiliary alternator is Brush BAA 702A Auxiliary Alternator, providing power for the radiator fans, lubrication and fuel oil pumps, traction motor cooling fans and air compressors amongst others. The main and auxiliary alternators are both driven by the main engine. Each of the six axles is driven via a reduction gear by one nose suspended axle hung traction motor (Brush designed and built TM2161A four pole motors). Each motor has a separate microprocessor-controlled power supply (SEPEX in Brush's designation - from \\"Separately Excited\\"), a system that was first tried on one Class 58, 58050. One feature of this system is that if one set of wheels/axle/motor starts to wheelslip their speed can be reduced without affecting the other motors. ===Prime mover=== The engine is an 8-cylinder, 145 litre Mirrlees Blackstone 8MB275T diesel traction engine (275 mm cylinder diameter); the Mirrlees engine was one of the most fuel efficient available at the time (189g of fuel per kWhr), but relatively heavy. The engine was also successfully installed in marine applications such as small ships and passenger ferries. The low cylinder count for the rated power was expected to result in lower maintenance costs.Sources: * * ;Engine dimensions * Eight cylinders in line * Bore, 275 mm (10.8 inch) * Stroke, 305 mm (12 inch) * Power output, 3,100 hp (2,311 kW) at 1,000 rpm ==Current operatorsDB Cargo UK=== 60 019 (Westerleigh, 2009) Following the privatisation of British Rail all 100 units came under the management of the English Welsh & Scottish (EWS), It was EWS's policy not to reduce the 100 strong fleet, with both fire and collision damaged locomotives receiving repairs. In 2003/04 a number of the fleet were stored, surplus to requirements.At the same time the Class 47, 56 and 58 fleets were withdrawn and the Class 37 fleet reduced ( see 2000 to present day) Between 2004 and 2007 typically between 50‚Äì75%During this period the Class 60s saw more work during the winter, and higher numbers available for work - owing to the seasonal demand for fuel oil. of the fleet would be out of action at a given time. In 2007 the operational fleet was estimated to be 60 locomotives. 60 079 (Westerleigh, 2012) In June 2007 EWS was acquired by DB Schenker, a wholly owned subsidiary of the German railway company, Deutsche Bahn. Since working for EWS/DB Schenker, Class 60s have typically been employed on stone, aggregate, ballast and petroleum traffic and also on steel trains. By 2009 many Class 60s were in storage, with only fifteen in operation at any one time. In September 2010 twenty of the class were offered for disposal by DB Schenker UK, whilst in November 2010 DBS announced that 20 units would be overhauled. In January 2011 DB Schenker announced that seven units would undergo an overhaul, with an option of an overhaul on a further fourteen units. In January 2013, the overhaul was described as an \\"upgrade\\" to create a new fleet of \\"Super 60's\\". DB Schenker gave no technical details but, according to Tugtracker, there were mechanical upgrades trialled on 60 099 and electrical upgrades trialled on 60 011. Tugtracker also gives a list of eighteen locomotives upgraded between 1 September 2011 and 1 October 2013. Locomotives which had gone through the Super 60 program by September 2013 included (17); 60 007, 010, 015, 017, 019, 020, 024, 039, 040, 054, 059, 062, 063, 074, 079, 091, 092, with another four programmed later that year; 60 001, 044, 066 and 60 100, although its unclear if all of these were completed. https://www.railmagazine.com/trains/current-trains/making-the-class-60s-super- again In 2012 some Class 60s were offered for sale through Romic-Ace International Pte Ltd. In late 2013 DB Schenker Rail UK offered 20 locomotives for sale. These were to be purchased on 31 October 2013 by Doncaster-based Wabtec Rail in a ¬£10m deal - the deal was reported to have fallen through in 2014. In August 2017 DB Cargo UK offered a further 20 locomotives for sale, these being 60 003, 004, 005, 006, 008, 013, 014, 018, 022, 023, 025, 027, 030, 031, 032, 037, 042, 050, 051, and 052. They were sold to Wabtec Rail.Class 60s sold to Wabtec Railways Illustrated 8 August 2017 However again this sale subsequently fell through. In late 2018 DB Cargo UK offered 3 Class 60's (60 004, 014 and 018) for sale, which caused the status of the previous sale of Class 60 locomotives to Wabtec to be uncertain, given all 3 locomotives had thought to have been included in the previous Wabtec sale.DB Cargo to Dispose of 3 Class 60s DB Cargo UK 28 November 2018 On 1 December 2018 DB Cargo UK offered further Class 60s for sale - 60 008, 028, 029, 046, 055, 064, 070 and 098, which was the first time 60 064 had been put up for sale.DB Cargo to Dispose of 8 Class 60s DB Cargo UK 04 December 2018 In 2019 DB Cargo UK offered 60 006, 050, 060, 081 and 086 for sale, stored at Toton.https://uk.dbcargo.com/rail-uk-en/what-we- offer/additional_services/Disposals-1926106 All found buyers with three, initially, sold to metal recyclers (60 006 & 086 sold to Ron Hull, Rotherham, 60 050 to Raxstar) and 60 060 & 081 to 'Private Sales'. Subsequently, 60 086 was resold to a private owner and 60 050 was purchased by the same individual. On 20 January 2020 60 006 was scrapped at Toton and was the first of the class to be scrapped. On 10 February 2020 60 086 was transferred to the Wensleydale Railway and into preservation. This was followed by 60 050. ===GB Railfreight=== In July 2018 GB Railfreight bought all ten of Colas Rail‚Äôs Class 60 locomotives, Colas having replaced them with a further seven orders for Class 70 locomotives. ===DCRail=== In March 2019 DCRail acquired four locomotives from DB Cargo; 60 028, 029, 046, 055. These are being overhauled by DB Cargo at Toton TMD with 60 046 the first to enter service in November 2019.DCRail gets first Class 60 - William Wilberforce] The Railway Magazine issue 1425 December 2019 page 105 ==Former operatorsBritish Rail=== 60 024 Elizabeth Fry at Eastleigh By 1990, the class had started to be introduced onto the mainline, replacing previously double headed Class 33 Type 3s in the South East region, as well as Classes 20, 26, 27, 31 and 73. The first locos accepted into traffic were 60 017 and 60 018 in October 1990. The class 60s primarily worked on aggregate (specifically stone) traffic also replacing Class 56s and Class 58s, some of which were withdrawn, others transferred. Their introduction replaced double-heading and also allowed longer and/or heavier trains to be worked. ===Colas Rail=== 60 076 (Bristol, 2015) In June 2014 it was reported that 10 locos have been sold to Colas Rail. The numbers are 60 002/021/026/047/056/076/085/087/095/096. The first one to appear in the Colas yellow and orange livery was 60 087, which was photographed at Burton- on-Trent on 2 June 2014. In July 2018 Colas Rail sold all ten of its locomotives to GB Railfreight.https://www.railmagazine.com/news/fleet/gb- railfreight-buys-more-locomotives ==Accidents and incidents== *On 30 June 2015, 60 054 was hauling a tanker train that derailed at , Lincolnshire due to buckled track. *On 26 August 2020, 60 062 Stainless Pioneer was hauling a tanker train that derailed and caught fire at Morlais Junction, near , Glamorgan. ==Naming and liveries== 60 054 named Charles Babbage In 1989 Railfreight named the Class 60s in traditional fashion; those locomotives attached to the construction and metals sectors were named after British mountains as were some attached to the coal sector. The others (coal and petroleum sectors) received the names of famous British citizens, with an emphasis on those whose contribution had been to science and engineering. Locomotives numbered 60 001 and 60 098 were exceptions, being named Steadfast and Charles Francis Brush respectively. The locomotives received the standard liveries of their respective sectors. 60 033 Tees Steel Express in British Steel blue at in 1999 After coming into EWS's ownership, the Class 60 locomotives were repainted in the red and yellow EWS livery as and when repainting was necessary. Many others carried vinyl stickers on their sides over the former BR sector liveries, demonstrating EWS's ownership. A few locos received new names including 60 033: Tees Steel Express, painted in British Steel blue, and 60 081, repainted in a mock Great Western Railway green livery and renamed Isambard Kingdom Brunel in 2000. In 2007/08, two locomotives received special liveries: 60 074 received a 'powder blue' livery and was named Teenage Spirit at the National Railway Museum in York as part of a charity event for the Teenage Cancer Trust. 60 040 was repainted in a red livery and named The Territorial Army Centenary as part of the celebration of that event. Both of these locos have since been repainted into standard DB Schenker livery. In 2010 class 60 number 60 099 was repainted into a Tata Steel silver livery and logo at Toton TMD and unveiled at Tata's Scunthorpe plant on 27 September. In January 2011 60 011 became the first member of the class to receive the standard DB Schenker livery, after a repaint at Toton TMD. In late May 2014 60 087 emerged from Toton TMD in Colas livery. It was joined by 60 002, 021, 026, 047, 056, 076, 085, 095 and 096. In 2019 DCR Cappagh acquired four former DB Cargo Class 60s, from store, which were overhauled and repainted by DB Cargo at Toton TMD. 60 046 and 60 055 were repainted in the DC Rail Freight corporate grey livery. 60 046 regained its original name, William Wilberforce, whilst 60 055 regained its original name, Thomas Barnardo. 60 028 was turned out in a blue livery, with large CAPPAGH logo. On 18 February 2020 the final locomotive of the quartet, 60 029, emerged from a repaint, at Toton TMD, in DC Rail Freight grey and carrying its original name, Ben Nevis. ==Scrapping== On 20th January 2020 work began scrapping locomotive 60 006 at Toton depot, the first Class 60 to be dismantled. ==Fleet summary== Fleet summary 2020. {  - !

It was founded in 1977 as a result of a merger between Neville's Cross College of Education and Durham Technical College. Until 2004, the college operated on two main sites near the city of Durham: Neville's Cross and Framwellgate Moor. The site at Framwellgate Moor opened in 1957 and was extended in 1970; the site housed the bulk of the college's further education (FE) provision, whilst the Neville's Cross site, an ex-college of education site built in the 1920s, housed most of the higher education (HE) provision. In 2002, the college was given planning permission to build a new ¬£37 million campus at Framwellgate Moor. Construction work began in 2003 with the new buildings being constructed around the old buildings. When the new buildings were completed, work began to demolish the old site at Neville's Cross. The construction work was completed in September 2005, whilst the landscaping was finally completed in October. In the academic year 1999‚Äì2000, the college enrolled 8,270 FE students, of whom 1,877 were full-time, and 1,934 HE students, of whom 675 were full-time. Business and management was offered on the Neville's Cross Campus until 2004. In 2011, the College became one of only two in the country to be granted Foundation Degree Awarding Powers. These can be converted to bachelor's degrees via a \\"top up\\" year, with the degrees validated by Teesside University, Sunderland University and Leeds Metropolitan University. ==Notable alumni== * David Anderson, Labour Member of Parliament for Blaydon (2005‚Äì2017), Shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland (2016‚Äì2017) (Durham Technical College) *John Cummings, Labour Member of Parliament for Easington (1987‚Äì2010) (Durham Technical College) *Stephen Hughes, Labour Member of the European Parliament for Durham and then North East England (1984‚Äì2014) *Ian Lavery Labour Member of Parliament for Wansbeck and Chairman of the Labour Party\\"Lavery, Ian, (born 6 Jan. 1963), MP (Lab) Wansbeck, since 2010.\\" WHO'S WHO & WHO WAS WHO. 1 Dec. 2010 ==References * Category:Buildings and structures in Durham, England Category:Further education colleges in County Durham Category:Educational institutions established in 1977 Category:1977 establishments in England Category:Sixth form colleges in County Durham ","title":"New College Durham"},{"id":"2226566","text":"Statue by Konrad Knoll, Braunau, 1866 Johann Philipp Palm or Johannes Philipp Palm (17 December 1768 - 26 August 1806) was a German bookseller and a strong anti-French agitator and freedom fighter executed during the Napoleonic Wars at Napoleon's orders. He was born at Schorndorf in W√ºrttemberg. Having been apprenticed to his uncle, the publisher Johann Jakob Palm (1750-1826), in Erlangen, he married the daughter of the bookseller Stein in Nuremberg, and in the course of time became proprietor of his father-in-law's business. In the spring of 1806, the Stein publishing house sent to the bookselling establishment of Stage in Augsburg a pamphlet (presumably written by Philipp Christian Yelin in Ansbach) entitled Deutschland in seiner tiefen Erniedrigung (\\"Germany in her deep humiliation\\"), which strongly attacked Napoleon and the behaviour of the French troops in Bavaria. On learning of the violent rhetorical attack made upon his r√©gime and failing to discover the actual author, Napoleon had Palm arrested in and handed over to a military commission at Braunau am Inn on the Bavarian-Austrian frontier, with peremptory instructions to try the prisoner and execute him within twenty-four hours. Palm was denied the right of defence, and after a show trial on 25 August 1806, he was shot the following day without having betrayed the pamphlet's author. A life-size bronze statue was erected to his memory in Braunau in 1866, and on the centenary of his death, numerous patriotic meetings were held throughout Bavaria. Since 2002 a private foundation at Schorndorf awards a Johann Philipp Palm Prize for freedom of speech and the press. It was to Palm that the poet Thomas Campbell was referring when he gave his famous (and possibly apocryphal) toast to Napoleon at a literary dinner. When this caused uproar, he admitted that Napoleon was a tyrant and an enemy of their country, \\"But gentlemen! He once shot a publisher.\\" Palm is briefly mentioned in Adolf Hitler's autobiography Mein Kampf (My Struggle), in the first page of the book. Hitler wrote, \\"To-day I consider it a good omen that Destiny appointed Braunau-am-Inn to be my birthplace.\\" Later on the same page, Palm is mentioned by name as an \\"uncompromising nationalist and enemy of the French, put to death here because he had loved Germany even in her misfortune.\\" Hitler compares his death to that of Leo Schlageter, who had also been executed by the French after being betrayed to them.Mein Kampf (\\"My fight\\"), Volume 1: \\"A Reckoning\\", first real page.

He was first associated with his father in 1136, when he first carried the ducal title. This was confirmed by Conrad III of Germany, who had married the sister of Godfrey's wife. Waleran left a son, Henry II of Limburg, who asserted his father's ducal rights. Godfrey and Henry entered into a war in which the latter was decisively and quickly destroyed. Godfrey did not long enjoy his victory. He was killed by a disease of the liver two years thence. He was buried in St. Peter's Church in Leuven. He married Luitgarde, daughter of Berengar II of Sulzbach and sister of Gertrude von Sulzbach, wife of Conrad III of Germany, and Bertha, wife of Manuel I Comnenus, the Byzantine emperor.

She was the daughter of the Portuguese king Afonso I and Matilda of Savoy. She served as co-regent of Portugal with her brother during the illness of their father Afonso I of Portugal from 1172 until 1173, and regent of Flanders during the interim period after the death of her spouse and the accession of his heir. == Regent of Portugal == Theresa, her brother Sancho and sister Urraca were the only children of Afonso and Matilda to survive to adulthood. Named after her paternal grandmother, Countess Theresa, she was reputedly King Afonso I's favourite. During their father's illness, Sancho at first exercised regency alone but from 1172 he shared the government with Theresa. At that time Afonso started considering to allow Theresa to succeed to the throne, and in 1173 he declared Sancho and Theresa co-heirs. As Afonso's illness progressed, the role of the siblings increased. Sancho took over military matters, while Theresa assumed administrative functions. Due to her proximity to the throne and fears of a loss of independence, a marriage with an Iberian lord was undesirable. Theresa thus remained unmarried until relatively late. == Countess of Flanders == Around 1183 envoys came from the County of Flanders to ask for Theresa's hand in marriage to Count Philip. Perhaps because of the difficulty of pronouncing her name, she became known as Matilda. Her marriage was celebrated (in the Tournai Cathedral, Bruges) after the death of Elisabeth of Vermandois, first wife of Philip, who hadn't given him any children, and was because Philip needed an heir so that his county wouldn't fall into French hands. For its part, Portugal, a new-born country, managed to secure an important alliance with Flanders, and European recognition. Theresa brought a considerable dowry, something that helped Philip manage his war with France for a couple of more years, before making peace in 1186. A reasonable number of Portuguese immigrants (mainly merchants) also went to Flanders with the infanta. Matilda lived in one of the most luxurious courts of Europe, in which Philip patronized Chr√©tien de Troyes, author of a famous cycle of Arthurian stories and one of the fathers of the Holy Grail theme in literature. However, like Elisabeth of Vermandois, Matilda never gave birth, and after Philip's death, the county passed to his sister, Margaret I, and her husband, Baldwin VIII. After Philip's death in August 1191, Matilda, holding extensive dower lands in southern and coastal Flanders, was powerful enough to challenge the rule of her sister-in-law and brother-in-law, provoking unrest among the public in her dower lands by raising the taxes and becoming a central figure of the part of the nobility opposing the succession of Margaret and Baldwin, but was forced to relent.David M Nicholas, Medieval Flanders == Duchess of Burgundy == In 1193, Matilda married again, this time to Odo III, Duke of Burgundy. Her second marriage produced no children, and so, she ended up being repudiated by the Duke, so that he could marry Alice of Vergy. She returned to Flanders and would be instrumental in arranging the marriage of her nephew Ferdinand to Margaret I and Baldwin VIII's granddaughter, Joan, Countess of Flanders. She died when her carriage accidentally fell into a marsh near Veurne where she drowned. She is celebrated in Bruges every year. ==References== - - Category:1150s births Category:1218 deaths Category:House of Burgundy-Portugal Category:Portuguese infantas Category:Countesses of Flanders Category:Duchesses of Burgundy Category:People from Coimbra Category:12th-century Portuguese people Category:13th-century Portuguese people Category:12th-century Portuguese women Category:13th-century Portuguese women Category:12th-century French people Category:13th-century French people Category:12th-century French women Category:13th-century French women Category:12th-century women rulers Category:12th-century people from the county of Flanders ","title":"Theresa of Portugal, Countess of Flanders"},{"id":"2226584","text":"Bryan Lee (March 16, 1943 ‚Äì August 21, 2020) was an American blues guitarist and singer based in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was also known by the nickname 'Braille Blues Daddy' and was a fixture on Bourbon Street since the 1980s. ==History== Lee was born on March 16, 1943, in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, United States, and completely lost his eyesight by the age of eight. His avid interest in early rock and blues was fostered through the 1950s by late night listening sessions via the Nashville-based radio station WLAC-AM, where he first encountered the sounds of Elmore James, Albert King and Albert Collins. By his late teens, Lee was playing rhythm guitar in a regional band called The Glaciers that covered Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Chuck Berry material. Through the 1960s, Lee's interest turned to Chicago blues and he soon found himself immersed in that scene, opening for some of his boyhood heroes. In 1979 he released his first album named Beauty Isn't Always Visual. In January 1982, Lee moved to New Orleans, eventually landing a steady gig at the Old Absinthe House on Bourbon Street becoming a favorite of tourists in the city's French Quarter. For the next 14 years, Lee and his Jump Street Five played five nights a week at that popular bar, developing a huge following and a solid reputation. To the end of his life, Lee continued to perform in New Orleans. He also toured several times a year in the Midwest, Eastern Seaboard, Rocky Mountain States and recently Europe and Brazil. Lee appeared with Kenny Wayne Shepherd as the musical guest on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on February 14, 2007.

He attempted to enhance the public house environment, at a time when standards were often low. The bars are designed for a youthful clientele, and aim to attract an equal number of men and women with \\"female friendly\\" designs. The chain has remained relevant by continually re-inventing itself for the contemporary marketplace. The chain has gone through a number of owners throughout its history, and is currently owned by the Stonegate Pub Company, based in Luton, Bedfordshire. ==History== Hugh Corbett, an entrepreneur with a background in the hotel industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1985. At the time, Islington was becoming increasingly gentrified due to its proximity to the City of London financial district. Corbett owned a small number of pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable differential of stripped out carpets and enlarged windows so that people could see inside from the street. Corbett listed his business in 1989 as Fast Forward, by which time it was a nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as an imitation of David Bruce's Firkin chain pubs. Durham In 1992, the David Bruce-controlled Grosvenor Inns acquired Fast Forward for ¬£4.46 million, bringing Grosvenor's total number of pubs to thirty.Pearse, Peter. \\"Grosvenor Inns Joins Usm with an ¬£8.1m. Tag.\\" Financial Times 21 May 1992: 25. Financial Times. Web. 4 November 2012. By this time, Fast Forward owned thirteen pubs, all based around the London area, with seven under the Slug name. The decision was taken to appeal to customers in their 20s and 30s and make the bar \\"more contemporary\\", \\"more of a bar, less of a pub\\", \\"young and even rowdy\\" and \\"not blokey ‚Äì not a very male environment\\", aiming for an equal proportion of both male and female clientele. Sheila McKenzie, who had founded the female-friendly Pitcher & Piano chain, was enlisted to enact these changes, and the Slug and Lettuce concept has been described as her \\"brainchild\\". Grosvenor felt that the pub chain had \\"lost its way\\", and concentrated on boosting its food operations. In 1995, Slug and Lettuce was rebranded again, this time as a \\"contemporary English bar\\", designed to occupy the middle ground between a continental caf√© and a classic English pub. By this time, food constituted 30 per cent of total sales. In 1997 the chain identified its primary competitors as the All Bar One and Pitcher & Piano bar chains. In 1998 Grosvenor Inns changed its name to The Slug and Lettuce Group, reflecting the fact that the now 22-strong chain had become the company's sole focus. The chain also announced that it would not stock the amusement with prize machines common in many other pubs. In 1998, the chain encountered its first major setback after it expanded into the North of England with five outlets in Nottingham, York, Manchester, Harrogate and Leeds. These sites all made profit losses in their first six months of operation, which triggered the company's first profit warning. In 1999, the chain first entered the Scottish market, with an outlet in Glasgow. Meanwhile, the company board was criticised for a lack of dynamism and being too slow to expand its number of outlets. The chain launched a website in February 2000. All Slug and Lettuce outlets serve food throughout the day, and the meals are English inspired, with offerings including sandwiches, burgers, pasta and salads. Outlets sell a range of cocktails, beer and wine. Since 2011, outlets have opened early for breakfast. A Slug and Lettuce at Canary Wharf, London In mid-2000, SFI, the owner of the Litten Tree bar chain, announced a ¬£31.6 million takeover of Slug and Lettuce, paid for in shares, and McKenzie left the chain to pursue new challenges. By this time the chain had 32 outlets. According to analysts, the chain was too small and had too much debt to survive alone. SFI refurbished a number of their existing pubs under the Slug and Lettuce concept, and by 2004 the chain had 56 outlets.Blackwell, David. \\"Slug & Lettuce Owner Trims Loss by ¬£83.6m.\\" Financial Times [London, England] 2 October 2004: 4. Financial Times. Web. 4 November 2012. In 2005, SFI attempted to reposition the chain as an upmarket place to eat, in anticipation of the forthcoming smoking ban. In June 2005 SFI went into administration, and sold 98 of its 150 outlets to the Laurel Pub Company, controlled by Robert Tchenguiz, for ¬£80 million.Grande, Carlos. \\"SFI Agrees to ¬£80m. Sale of 98 Outlets to Laurel.\\" Financial Times [London, England] 25 June 2005: 2. Financial Times. Web. 4 November 2012. In 2008 Laurel itself collapsed, and the Slug chain became a part of the Bay Restaurant Group, later Town & City Pub Company. The chain has withdrawn from a number of locations, including Glasgow and Cardiff, leaving it with only one location in Scotland, and no presence in Wales. In 2010, Town & City began to refurbish the outlets, switching from a brown colour scheme to aubergine and updating upholstery and lighting. In June 2011 Town & City merged with the Stonegate Pub Company. Since 2011 outlets have opened early to serve breakfast. In September 2012 the Stonegate company chairman Ian Payne announced plans to expand the chain, which he claimed had outperformed the high street for the past three years, and was enjoying double digit growth. As of 2012, outlets are being refurbished with a colour scheme of gold, purple, green and plum. ==Operations== The menu largely comprises traditional English inspired cuisine, and includes such items as burgers, curries, pasta and salads. In drinks, the chain focuses on beer, wine and spirits based cocktails such as the Long Island Ice Tea and mojitos. Some outlets sell cask ale. In 2006 the chain switched to selling exclusively fair trade coffee. In 2000, average annual turnover of each site was just below ¬£900,000. Outlets typically occupy around 2,000 square feet in area, and include converted banks and churches. ==Reception== In 1994 The Times described the chain as \\"a modish hang-out for the stripped pine brigade\\". The chain's interior layout has been described as \\"minimalist\\". The chain has been criticised by some, such as the writer Will Self, for spreading a bland uniformity throughout British high streets, and for removing individual elements from the pubs that it converts. In 1997, a Slug and Lettuce in a listed building in Islington Green illegally removed its old mahogany bar, which it was later forced to restore. The appeal of the Slug and Lettuce concept has seen it become widely imitated, with Zoe Williams of The Guardian commenting in 2012, \\"Does anybody remember in the 90s, when the Slug and Lettuce pub chain deliberately fancied itself up to appeal to the lady drinker? And wham, two seconds later, that's where all the men wanted to drink as well, so that all pubs had to become more like Slugs and Lettuces just to survive?\\" == References  * Official website * Category:Companies based in Luton Category:Pub chains Category:Restaurants established in 1984 Category:Stonegate Pub Company Category:1984 establishments in England ","title":"Slug and Lettuce"},{"id":"2226629","text":"Jonathan Williams (26 October 1942 ‚Äì 31 August 2014) was a British racing driver.

His racing career began in the early 1960s, competing in saloons and various junior formulae, graduating to Formula Three in 1963 and in 1966 drove for the de Sanctis team.Jonathan Williams. f1rejects.com During this time he worked with the young Sir Frank Williams, Sheridan Thynne and Piers Courage.F1 Rejects Interview with Jonathan Williams. f1rejects.com In 1967, he was signed by Scuderia Ferrari, initially competing in sports car racing. That year, Ferrari lost several drivers, including team leader Lorenzo Bandini who died from injuries sustained at that year's Monaco Grand Prix and Williams' sports car co-driver, G√ºnter Klass, killed during practice at the Mugello Circuit in July. Later that year, Williams was offered a drive in F1, but after only one Grand Prix he was dropped by Ferrari and a subsequent F1 project with Abarth did not come to fruition. However, he did compete in some Formula Two events in 1968 winning the Rhine Cup race in a car entered by Sir Frank Williams, before driving the works Serenissima. In 1969 he helped develop the De Tomaso F1 car for Frank Williams as well as continuing to compete in F2. He continued also to be active in sports car racing. At the 1970 24 Hours of Le Mans, he co-drove the Porsche 908/02 which carried cameras for the Steve McQueen movie Le Mans. Williams retired from racing in 1972 and became a pilot, (initially for Alessandro de Tomaso) an occupation he claimed to dislike and subsequently a writer and photographer. Williams died on 31 August 2014, aged 71. He appeared in the documentary film Steve McQueen: The Man & Le Mans, released nine months after his death and which closes with a clip of Williams driving in the 1971 film Le Mans. ==Racing recordComplete Formula One World Championship results=== (key) {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\\" - !

It is the only species in the monotypic genus Howellia. Thomas Jefferson Howell and Joseph Howell discovered the species in 1878. ==Distribution== The water howellia is found in large area of the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It can be found in California, Idaho, Montana, and Washington, and it is known historically from Oregon.USFWS Species Profile. The plant grows in wetland habitat surrounded by forests, which provide organic material. Associated tree species include Populus trichocarpa (California poplar), P. tremuloides (quaking aspen), and Fraxinus latifolia (Oregon ash). The water bodies are located in glacial potholes, river oxbows, ephemeral ponds, flood plains and other areas that fill with water periodically as snow melts and spring rain falls. ==Biology== The plant produces two types of flowers. Submerged cleistogamous flowers remain closed and self-pollinate, and flowers that bloom above the surface of the water open into white blossoms and may cross with other individuals. Because it often pollinates itself, the species has a low genetic diversity. Seeds are produced in the water but they require open air for germination, so they sprout when the wetland has dried in the fall. ==Conservation== Threats to this species include loss of habitat to logging and draining and conversion to urban use, alteration of the local hydrology by placement of dams and dikes, deposition of silt, livestock activity, introduced species of plants, low genetic diversity, and climate change.USFS Wildflowers. ==References *USDA Plants Profile Category:Lobelioideae Category:Monotypic Campanulaceae genera ","title":"Howellia"},{"id":"2226636","text":"Slug and Lettuce is a pub chain in the United Kingdom.

She studied economics at the University of British Columbia (UBC) earning her bachelor's degree in 1975. She received an MA from the University of Toronto in 1978. == Career as an economist == Chong's career as an economist began when she moved to Ottawa to work in the Department of Finance, where she was employed until 1980. She then worked for one year as a special advisor in the Prime Minister's Office, dealing with issues pertaining to British Columbia. In 1981 she became a senior economic advisor and worked closely with the late Pierre Elliot Trudeau until the end of his term in 1984. It has been noted that her presence, as a Chinese female, was remarkable in the white male dominated world of government finance and that \\"she was a trailblazer for the more inclusive public service that was to come.\\" Denise Chong's career in the Canadian government is made even more significant with her realization, through her familial and historical research, that her \\"grandparents lived in Canada at a time when they could not participate in White society. They were excluded from it: they could not take out citizenship, they couldn't own land, they couldn't vote.\\" http://www.asian.ca/media/chinacity/jsoo.htm With the end of Trudeau's term in 1984, Denise Chong left her role as a public servant in order to pursue a career as a professional writer. == Writing career == Though her professional writing career did not begin until much later, Denise Chong was a journalist for the Ubyssey, a student newspaper at UBC, while she was an undergraduate student there. Denise Chong has published four non-fiction books of literary non-fiction and edited one compilation of short stories. Because of the importance of the Canadian historical research in Chong's first book, a memoir of her family, The Concubine's Children, she has become \\"renowned as a writer and commentator on Canadian history and on the family.\\" This book, one of the first non-fiction narrative accounts of the Chinese in Canada, was a Globe and Mail best seller for ninety-three weeks. That Denise Chong's work has been important to the study of Canada is also reflected by the fact that a speech that she gave for Citizenship Week in 1995Morton, D. and M. Weinfeld, ed. Who Speaks for Canada? : Words that Shape a Country. Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1998, pp. 327‚Äì32. entitled \\"Being Canadian\\" has been widely anthologized, including in the books Who Speaks for Canada: Words that Shape a Country by D. Morton and M. Weinfeld (1998), and Great Canadian Speeches by D. Gruending (2004).. Chong's emphasis on the voices of women, as well as her particular brand of nationalism (which is more than a little critical), are both reflected in her edited compilation The Penguin Anthology of Stories by Canadian Women. That many of the authors published in this anthology are also women of transnational identities is a reflection of Denise Chong's concern for the multicultural quality of being Canadian. In Chong's own words, \\"Canadian citizenship recognizes differences. It praises diversity. It is what we as Canadians choose to have in common with each other [‚Ä¶] How we tell our stories is the work of citizenship\\".Chong, Denise. \\"Being Canadian\\". In Morton, D. and M. Weinfeld, ed. Who Speaks for Canada? : Words that Shape a Country. Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1998, p. 330 In her Introduction to the anthology, Chong highlights what attracted her to the stories, seeming to also articulate one of the strong characteristics of her own writing: \\"The plot that interested me was life lived in the chaos and uncertainty of everyday happenings and relationships.\\". All of Chong's books evoke such \\"everyday happenings and relationships\\" amidst the extraordinary circumstances of war, communism, immigration, and racism. Denise Chong's second book, The Girl in the Picture, about iconic Vietnamese napalm victim Kim Phuc, was also groundbreaking, in its portrayal of everyday life in war-torn Vietnam. Her book Egg on Mao: The Story of an Ordinary Man Who Defaced an Icon and Unmasked a Dictatorship, released on 29 September 2009 by Random House Canada., was Chong's first book in a decade. Egg on Mao tells the story of Lu Decheng, a bus mechanic, who, with two friends, challenged his family's communist allegiance by defacing a portrait of chairman Mao Zedong during the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square. In an interview about this story exploring human rights in China, Chong said, \\"It was a very Chinese act. In the West, we would view something like this as a quixotic and think how naive these men were. But in China, it's your only gesture. Of course they were naive. But you have to balance the futility of the gesture against the weight of repression‚Ä¶ people are willing to make a futile gesture for the nobility of having acted.\\". Her 2013 non-fiction book, Lives of the Family: Stories of Fate and Circumstance, relates stories about the experiences of Chinese-Canadian families who settled in Canada's National Capital Region.

Instead, he goes by the first name Tad‚Äîoriginally Tadpole, the nickname he was given whilst in the orphanage because of his diminutive size.

He beat people for minor offences, and performed acts of vigilantism at its worst; he brutally assaulted innocent bystanders on at least two occasions, assuming them to be criminals‚Äîit is implied that at least one of his victims was killed. One day, he met John Law, the retired hero \\"Tarantula\\", and after hearing his stories, decided to become a superhero. He had difficulty coming up with a name until he looked across the street from his apartment at an all- night deli specializing in chicken wings. Thus, Nite-Wing was born.Nighwing #21 Unfortunately, on his first night out, he ran into a gang that shot him repeatedly. Rushed off to an emergency room, Nightwing spent the whole night defending him from Blockbuster's men, who thought it was Nightwing who was in the hospital. Tad was released from the hospital and went back to take revenge on the gang who put him there, killing them. Tad‚Äôs rampage continued, killing men who worked for Blockbuster, eventually even Ricky Noone, one of his major capos. One night, he was cornered by Dudley Soames, the former police inspector turned psychopath, who now called himself Torque. Here, he finally met Nightwing. The two escaped Torque, and Nightwing agreed to help train Tad, not realizing how violent he could be. Tad cornered Bl√ºdhaven‚Äôs corrupt Police Chief Redhorn and got all the files he had pertaining to Blockbuster. Presenting them to Nightwing, the two began to attack Blockbuster‚Äôs powerbase. They were captured and separated. When Cisco Blaine, an undercover FBI agent, came to free Tad, Tad beat him to death. Upon discovering that he was not a villain, but a government agent, Tad fled. Nightwing eventually tracked him down, and he was imprisoned in Lockhaven Penitentiary. Tad naively attempted to get himself released by giving a detailed account of his \\"crime fighting career\\" to the Federal agents who held him in custody, fully expecting them to release him since he was a \\"good guy\\", and the murder had been an innocent mistake on his part.

Tad was arrested again, along with Tarantula, and resides again in Lockhaven, serving his time for the murders of Cisco Blaine and Torque. ===True origins=== In Nightwing #51, \\"Tad's Story\\" revealed the detailed history of Tad, but contradicted the previous claim of him being abandoned.

Due to his lack of parental involvement, Tad began to read comic books as a means of escapist fantasy. Nighwing #51 Soon, he began to resent his father, who earned money through the sale of stolen goods. Believing firmly in the world of comic books, Tad performs an act he believes to be heroic: the framing of his father. Tad informed his father's crack-dealer of an employer and accused his father of being a snitch. As a result, his father was murdered and his mother sent to jail. After being sent to live with foster parents, he ran away and began to live on his own. Due to his lack of a job, he was usually a vagrant, and could afford to feed himself only through stealing from criminals. Following his capture at the hands of Nightwing and subsequent arrest for the murder of Cisco Blaine, he was revealed to have been left on a Bl√ºdhaven bus on Christmas Eve. ==Modus operandi== Nite-Wing saw himself as a hero, and he sought to bring justice to the world, but his methods were very flawed; he had killed a number of people, including an undercover FBI agent. Tad does not appear to understand the consequences of his actions, merely shrugging off any regret or responsibility by stating that he is a \\"good guy\\". ==Powers and abilities== Tad has no superpowers, however he is a capable and ruthless street fighter. Often, he carries many billiard balls taped to his back and uses a modified three-foot pool stick as a weapon. ==See also== *List of Batman Family enemies ==References== Category:Characters created by Chuck Dixon Category:Comics characters introduced in 1997 Category:DC Comics supervillains Category:Fictional orphans Category:Fictional vigilantes Category:Dick Grayson ","title":"Nite-Wing"},{"id":"2226658","text":"United Student Aid Funds or USA Funds, currently known as the Strada Education Network,http://www.stradaeducation.org/about/ is a nonprofit corporation which assists students into post-secondary education by providing financial support and other help.

For a devise (bequest) of a specific item of property (a specific gift), such property is considered adeemed, and the gift fails. For example, if a will bequeathed the testator's car to a specific beneficiary, but the testator owned no car at the time of his or her death, the gift would be adeemed and the aforementioned beneficiary would receive no gift at all. General bequests or general gifts - gifts of cash amounts - are never adeemed. If the cash in the testator's estate is not sufficient to satisfy the gift, then other assets in the residuary estate will need to be sold to raise the necessary cash. Some property lies in a \\"gray\\" area, in which the testator's specific intent must be determined. For example, where the testator bequeathes \\"500 shares of stock\\" in a company, this may be read as a general bequest (that the estate should purchase and convey the particular stocks to the beneficiary), or it may be read as a specific bequest, particularly if the testator used a possessive (\\"my 500 shares\\"). Such a gift is deemed to be a demonstrative gift. Such demonstrative gifts are deemed to be a hybrid of both specific and general gifts. If one were to bequeath \\"500 shares of stock,\\" most states would deem that to be a demonstrative gift. The resultant gift to the heir receiving \\"500 shares,\\" would be the date of death value of 500 shares of that particular stock. Ademption may be waived if the property leaves the estate after the testator has been declared incompetent. Furthermore, in some cases the beneficiary will be entitled to the proceeds from the sale of property, or to the insurance payout for property that is lost or destroyed. To avoid confusion as to what may or may not be adeemed, sometimes the phrase \\"if owned by me at my death\\" is placed into the articles of a will in which property is being bequeathed. As for the sale of land under an executory contract, traditional case law agrees that ademption occurs upon the death of the testator and that the proceeds of sale, when the closing occurs, should not pass to the specific devisee of the property. However, the more modern view and the Uniform Probate Code, which has been adopted by some states, disagrees. These jurisdictions find that when property subject to specific devise is placed under contract of sale before the decedent's death, the proceeds of the sale will pass to the specific devisee. ==Statutory variations== Many US jurisdictions have ameliorated the effects of the common law doctrine by statute. In Wisconsin, state law (854.08) attempts to abolish the common law doctrine of ademption by extinction, by, for example, awarding beneficiaries the balance of the purchase price of the item sold (subject to some limitations). In Virginia, ademption occurs with respect to most forms of property, but if the property at issue is stock certificates, then the buyout of the issuer of the stock by another company, and the swapping of the stocks for a new issue by that company, will not adeem the gift of stock. Similarly, if the shares of stock that existed at the time the gift was made have split (for example, where the holder of 500 shares receives a reissue of 1,000 shares each having half the value of the original), then the beneficiary of that gift will be entitled to the number of shares that exist after the split. ==References== Category:Wills and trusts Category:Inheritance ","title":"Ademption"},{"id":"2226669","text":"\\"No, Not Much\\" is a popular song published in 1955.

Organizational units most commonly appear in X.500 directories, X.509 certificates, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directories, Active Directory (AD), and Lotus Notes directories and certificate trees, but they may feature in almost any modern directory or digital certificate container grouping system. In most systems, organizational units appear within a top-level organization grouping or organization certificate, called a domain. In many systems one OU can also exist within another OU. When OUs are nested, as one OU contains another OU, this creates a relationship where the contained OU is called the child and the container is called the parent. Thus, OUs are used to create a hierarchy of containers within a domain. Only OUs within the same domain can have relationships. OUs of the same name in different domains are independent. == Specific uses == The name organizational unit appears to represent a single organization with multiple units (departments) within that organization. However, OUs do not always follow this model. They might represent geographical regions, job-functions, associations with other (external) groups, or the technology used in relation to the objects. Examples would include: * Department (e.g. human resources) within a corporation * Division (e.g. LifeScan, Inc.) that is owned by but separate from a parent corporation (Johnson & Johnson), although this would commonly be placed in a separate domain * Association (e.g. contractors) that is external to the organization. * To identify geographically distinct regions (e.g. Kansas City) the X.521 standard recommends a \\"locality\\" entry instead. * Job types or functions (e.g. managers, storage servers) that runs across all divisions of a company should be represented by an \\"organizational role\\" entry. ===Sun Enterprise Directory Server and Active Directory=== In Sun Java System Directory Server and Microsoft Active Directory (AD), an organizational unit (OU) can contain any other unit, including other OUs, users, groups, and computers. Organizational units in separate domains may have identical names but are independent of each other. OUs let an administrator group computers and users so as to apply a common policy to them. Organizational Units give a hierarchical structure, and when properly designed can ease administration. == Origins with X.500, Novell, and Lotus software == Novell and Lotus supplied the two largest software directory systems. Each of these companies started with flat account and directory structures, and encountered the support and name-conflict limitations inherent in their flat structures. They adopted the X.500 OU concept into their next-generation software around 1993 ‚Äì Novell with the release of Novell Directory Services (subsequently known as eDirectory), and Lotus with the release of the third version of Lotus Notes. Microsoft allegedly used Novell's directory as a blueprint for the first released versions of AD, but this claim appears suspect, given that X.500 served as the \\"granddaddy\\" of all directory systems. ==References== Category:Computer networking Category:Identity management ","title":"Organizational unit (computing)"},{"id":"2226690","text":"\\"Moments to Remember\\" is a 1955 popular song about nostalgia recorded by Canadian quartet The Four Lads.

His father was a school teacherT. S. Gomolitskaya-Tretyakova. About my father. (in Russian). Tretyakov graduated in 1916 from the department of law at Moscow University. He began to publish in 1913 and just before the Russian Revolution he became associated with the ego- futurists. Soon after the publication of Iron Pause, he became heavily involved in the Siberian futurist movement known as Creation along with artists such as Nikolay Aseyev and David Burlyuk. Perhaps his most famous play at the time was the anti-imperialist Roar China! (1926), about the Wanhsien Incident. Tretyakov was one of the founders of the constructivist journal LEF, (1923‚Äì1925), and its successor Novyi LEF (New LEF)(1927‚Äì1928), and of the associated artistic movement, whose main driving force was the poet Mayakovsky. They declared war on 'bourgeois' culture and claimed that the experimental avant garde works they produced were the artistic voice of the Bolshevik revolution. Boris Pasternak did not believe that any of the group actually wanted to destroy pre-revolutionary art, with one exception - \\"The only consistent and honest man in this group of negationists was Sergei Tretyakov, who drove his negation to its natural conclusion. Like Plato, Tretyakov considered that there was no place for art in a young socialist state.\\" His first play, Earth Rampant, also known as The World Turned Upside Down, premiered on March 4, 1923, directed by Vsevolod Meyerhold, was a commercial success that ran to 44 performances in 11 weeks, rescuing Moscow's Sohn Theatre, in which it was staged, from imminent bankruptcy. It was dedicated to 'the Red Army and the first soldier of the RSFSR, Leon Trotsky'. His next two of Tretyakov's first plays, Can You Hear Me. Moscow? and Gas Masks were directed by the young Sergei Eisenstein. The latter was staged in the Moscow Gas Works, for maximum realism. In 1924 Sergei Tretyakov made a lengthy visit to China, where he taught Russian literature and collected materials for some of his later publications. Roar China (Rychi Kitai) had its premier at the Meyerhold Theatre on January 23, 1926, and later went on foreign tour, and on tour of provincial theatres in the USSR. Tretyakov also wrote the controversial \\"I Want a Baby\\" (\\"I Want a Child\\") (1926), which has seen recent performances in Europe and America. The play advocated selective breeding for the purposes of political (not racial) purity. Meyerhold immediately accepted it for production, but then spent four years battling with the censorship to get it put on stage. Between 1930 and 1931 Tretyakov travelled in Germany, Denmark, and Austria. Before he fell foul of the authorities he translated and popularised other European writers such as Bertolt Brecht. Brecht was also familiar with Tretyakov's literary work and indeed stayed with him in 1935. Tretyakov contributed song lyrics to the film Pesn' o geroyakh (Song of Heroes) by Joris Ivens set in music by Hanns Eisler. Tretyakov was arrested on July 25, 1937 and charged with espionage. He had fallen under suspicion because of his contacts with foreign writers, and because the political attitudes he had expressed in the 1920s were no longer tolerated. His play \\"I Want a Baby\\" was denounced in Pravda in December 1937 as \\"a hostile slur on the soviet family.\\" He was sentenced to death on September 10, 1937, though in the introduction to the English publication of I Want a Baby, Robert Leach says it seems that in a last act of defiance he threw himself to his death down the stairwell at Butyrka prison. It was standard procedure for those sentenced to death to be photographed prior to execution: the last photograph of Tretyakov, staring defiantly at the camera, is reproduced in David King, Ordinary Lives. Tretyakov was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956. ==See also== *Russian avant-garde *Soviet art Tretyakov worked with: *Vsevolod Meyerhold (director) *Sergei Eisenstein (director) *El Lissitzky (stage designer) *Vladimir Mayakovsky (poet, playwright) *Osip Brik (literary theorist, essayist) *Alexander Rodchenko (artist and photographer) and his wife *Varvara Stepanova who was a fellow constructivist and textile designer. ==Works== By S.M Tretyakov: *\\"Roar China!: A Drama in Seven Scenes\\", Rialto Service Bureau, (1930) *\\"Iron Pause\\" Vladivostok, 1919 (book of verse) *\\"I Want a Baby!\\" University of Birmingham, (1995), *\\"Gas-Masks\\" Vserossiisky Proletkult, (1924) *\\"Can You Hear, Moscow?

Guns), is the debut extended play (EP) by American hard rock band L.A. Guns. Recorded in 1984 at Westwind Studios in Thousand Oaks, California, it was produced by Chuck Rosa and released in 1985 by Raz Records. The EP is the only release by the band to feature vocalist Michael Jagosz, bassist Ole Beich and drummer Rob Gardner, all of whom left shortly after its release (Guns, Beich and Gardner subsequently co-founded Guns N' Roses). ==Background== L.A. Guns recorded its debut EP at Westwind Studios in Thousand Oaks, California, a recording studio owned by former Rainbow and Black Sabbath frontman Ronnie James Dio. According to former vocalist Michael Jagosz, the group had only 24 hours available in the studio to record the EP, with \\"20‚Äì21 hours\\" used for the instrumentals and the remaining four used for vocals. The session was produced by Chuck Rosa and the EP released by the band's manager Raz Cue on his own label. Jagosz left shortly after the EP's release and was replaced by Paul Black, who would later rebuild the group after guitarist Tracii Guns, bassist Ole Beich and drummer Rob Gardner left to co-found Guns N' Roses with Hollywood Rose vocalist Axl Rose and guitarist Izzy Stradlin in March 1985. The tracks recorded for Collector's Edition No. 1 have been re-released several times since 1985. First, in 2004, the songs were included as a bonus second disc with Hollywood Raw: The Original Sessions, a compilation containing several recordings from before the release of the band's self-titled debut album in 1988.

The band achieved popular success in 2004 with the release of their debut album, The Caitiff Choir. After frontman Nicholas Brooks departed in 2006, just after the release of the band's sophomore effort Sirens, It Dies Today released Lividity in 2009 before going on an hiatus in 2010. The band reunited briefly for a show in 2012, but the reunion paused again in 2015. == History Formation, EPs and The Caitiff Choir (20012004)=== It Dies Today was formed in August 2001 in Buffalo, New York and was originally composed of vocalist Nicholas Brooks, guitarist Chris Cappelli, and guitarist Steve Lemke (who now plays bass). During their formation, most of the band members were only 16 years old. Their initial release was a three-track demo titled Let the Angels Whisper Your Name, recorded in late 2001. The following year, It Dies Today released an EP titled Forever Scorned, which led to the band touring the U.S. with artists such as Between the Buried and Me and Alexisonfire. In 2003, Lemke switched to bass as guitarist Mike Hatalak joined. Prior to joining It Dies Today, Hatalak played in bands called Short of Breath, Plain of Ashes, and Stricture. The group eventually signed with Trustkill Records, home to hardcore heavyweights such as Throwdown, Eighteen Visions, and Bleeding Through. Fall 2004 brought about the release of the band's debut full-length The Caitiff Choir. The album sold over 25,000 copies within four months and allowed the band to sell out two national headlining tours with support from Twelve Tribes, Anterrabae, Trivium and others. Alternative Press named them a \\"Band To Know\\" in 2005. The album has sold 90,000 copies to date. In 2005, It Dies Today went on a series of whirlwind tours including tours supporting Bleeding Through, Walls of Jericho, All That Remains, and Throwdown, as well as appearing on the PETA-sponsored \\"Compassion Over Fashion\\" tour with Most Precious Blood and Remembering Never. The group also supported metal bands such as God Forbid, Machine Head and The Haunted, as well as securing a spot on the coveted Ozzfest second-stage in the summer of 2005. The following summer, the band was scheduled to take part in the Van's Warped Tour but had to cancel due to a vocal injury sustained by Brooks. ===Sirens and departure of Nicholas Brooks (20062007)=== It Dies Today spent 2006 writing and recording their follow-up album with producers Gggarth and Ben Kaplan. Co- producing were vocalist Nick Brooks and guitarist Mike Hatalak, who owns DWS Studios in Niagara Falls, New York. On October 17, 2006, It Dies Today released Sirens, which was followed by a U.S. tour. A song from the album, \\"Sacred Heart (Sacre Coeur)\\" was featured in the 2009 film Jennifer's Body, while another song, \\"Sixth of June\\", was featured on the Resident Evil: Extinction. On January 17, 2007 it was announced that Brooks had left the band and that his replacement would be Jason Wood, whom they met while on tour with Still Remains. Before joining It Dies Today, Jason, a Grand Rapids, Michigan native, was the vocalist for the metal outfits Kamilla and The Orphan. Later that year, the band played Warped Tour alongside Still Remains, Throwdown, Poison the Well, As I Lay Dying, and Parkway Drive, among others. ===Lividity and hiatus (20072010)=== It Dies Today spent the latter half of 2007 working on their third album, breaking in early 2008 for a small tour before getting back to work for the remainder of the year. After several delays in recording, as well as push-backs by Trustkill Records, the new album Lividity was released on September 15, 2009. The band immediately embarked on a North American tour but were denied access into Canada and had to cancel a handful of shows. On August 13, 2009, it was announced that the band would be playing at Australia's Soundwave Festival in 2010. The band then played at the Mountain Metal Mayhem Festival in Berlin, NH on August 14, 2010 with Within The Ruins, Bloodlined Calligraphy, Threat Signal, Thy Will Be Done, Unearth, and local support. In September 2010, former vocalist Nick Brooks and current It Dies Today guitarist Mike Hatalak formed a new hardcore band called The March. They have since recorded and posted demos on the band's MySpace page. Rumors of a break-up began to spread due to the lack of updates, but in December 2010 drummer Nicholas Mirusso posted on the band's Facebook account, \\"We are currently on an indefinite hiatus. No promising news to give at the moment, other than we've all been submerged into the \\"real\\" world.\\" Their Facebook account also uploaded two unreleased tracks entitled ‚ÄúPee Wee‚Ä¶Listen To Reason‚Äù and a cover of Alice In Chains' ‚ÄúThem Bones‚Äù in October 2011. ===Temporary reunion (20122015)=== On November 23, 2011 the band announced a reunion show with original vocalist Nicholas Brooks. Days after the performance on January 28, 2012, guitarist Mike Hatalak publicly stated that It Dies Today was no longer a band, but less than a month later, the statement would be retracted when the band stated that their new EP would be out on December 12, 2012. Someone from the band said, \\"Yes, patience, please. We are no longer in our early twenties living at our parents' house. We have jobs, responsibilities, and new families we've created. We're not bound by a label, so true fans will appreciate the time we're investing in this.\\" However, the planned EP never came to fruition. On January 19, 2014, a video featuring a new recording, presumably by Mike Hatalak, was posted on the band's Facebook page. The full demo of the recording, titled \\"Son of Dawn, Brilliant Star\\", was later released on Lambgoat.com on April 29, 2014, with the band also announcing a set of shows in September to celebrate the 10 year anniversary of the release of The Caitiff Choir on the same day. This is the first track to feature Nicholas Brooks since the release of Sirens eight years prior, marking a return to the original lineup for the band. In response to his return, Brooks commented, \\"I honestly could not be happier to have the opportunity to not only play shows with these dudes again but to write and record a new album with them as well.\\" However, on February 13, 2015, Nicholas Brooks announced that due to a \\"severe case of writer's block and family life\\", the potential album effort had been postponed indefinitely. ==Members== ;Current *Nicholas Brooks - lead vocals (2001‚Äì2007, 2012‚Äì2015) *Chris Cappelli - guitars (2001-2015) *Steve Lemke - bass guitar, backing vocals (2003-present), guitars (2001-2003) *Mike Hatalak - guitars (2003-2015) *Nick Mirusso - drums, percussion (2002-2015) ;Former *Jason Wood - lead vocals (2007‚Äì2012) *Seth Thompson - bass(2001-2003) *Joe Cuonze - drums (2001) *Steven Sanchez - bass (2003) *Aaron Adkins - guitar (2001) ;Touring *Tony Lorenzo - guitars (2004) ==DiscographyStudio albums=== * 2004: The Caitiff Choir (re-released in 2006) * 2006: Sirens * 2009: Lividity ===EPs and Demos=== * 2001: Let the Angels Whisper Your Name * 2002: Forever Scorned (re-released in 2006) ===Compilations=== * 2005: Masters of Horror Soundtrack * 2006: The Best Of Taste Of Chaos * 2006: Headbanger's Ball: The Revenge * 2006: A Santa Cause: It's a Punk Rock Christmas * 2007: Resident Evil: Extinction Soundtrack * 2009: Saw VI Soundtrack * 2009: Soundwave 2010 ==References== Category:American metalcore musical groups Category:Heavy metal musical groups from New York (state) Category:Musical groups established in 2001 ","title":"It Dies Today"},{"id":"2226724","text":"This is a list of educational institutions located in the district of Lahore in Pakistan.

Most of its early shows were based on unconventional topics such as: birdwatching, Catholicism, and healthy living. Soon after, it gravitated towards shows that brought in a larger audience such as: cooking instruction, car shows, fitness, and yoga.

In the modern era, the typical interpretation for men is black tie for evening wear and black lounge suit for day wear, corresponded by evening dress or cocktail dress for women. \\\\- Whether one would choose to wear morning or evening semi-formal has traditionally been defined by whether the event will commence before or after 6:00 p.m. In addition, equivalent versions may be permitted of semi-formally applicable ceremonial dresses (including court dresses, diplomatic uniforms and academic dresses), full dress uniforms, religious clothing, and national costumes, and military mess dresses. ==Evening wear: \\"black tie\\" dinner suit== For evening wear (after 6 p.m.), the code is black tie. In formal evening dress, or white tie dress, this practice of substituting colors in ties is much less common since men's fashion tends to follow tradition more deeply as it becomes more formal. The origins of evening semi-formal attire date back to the later 19th century when Edward, Prince of Wales (subsequently Edward VII), wanted a more comfortable dinner attire than the swallowtail coat. In spring 1886, the Prince invited James Potter, a rich New Yorker, and his wife Cora to Sandringham House, the Prince's hunting estate in Norfolk. When Potter asked for the Prince's dinner dress code, the Prince sent him to his tailor, Henry Poole & Co., in London, where he was given a suit made to the Prince's specifications with the dinner jacket. On returning to Tuxedo Park, New York, in 1886, Potter's dinner suit proved popular at the Tuxedo Park Club. Not long afterward, when a group of men from the club chose to wear such suits to a dinner at Delmonico's Restaurant in New York City, other diners were surprised. They were told that such clothing was popular at Tuxedo Park, so the particular cut then became known as the \\"tuxedo\\". From its creation into the 1920s, this dinner jacket was considered appropriate dress for dining in one's home or club, while the tailcoat remained in place as appropriate for public appearance. Etiquette and clothing experts continue to discourage wearing of black tie as too formal for weddings, or indeed any event before 6 p.m., such as by Emily Post (1872-1960) and Amy Vanderbilt (1908-1974), the latter arguing that \\"no man should ever be caught in a church in a tuxedo\\". == Supplementary alternatives  Mess dress === For formal dining, uniformed services officers and non-commissioned officers often wear mess dress equivalents to the civilian black tie and evening dress. Mess uniforms may vary according to the wearers' respective branches of the armed services, regiments, or corps, but usually include a short Eton-style coat reaching to the waist. Some include white shirts, black bow ties, and low-cut waistcoats, while others feature high collars that fasten around the neck and corresponding high-gorge waistcoats. Some nations' armed services have black tie and white tie equivalent variants in their mess dress. === Red Sea Rig === In tropical areas, primarily in Western diplomatic and expatriate communities, Red Sea rig is sometimes worn, in which the jacket and waistcoat are omitted and a red cummerbund and trousers with red piping are worn instead. ==See also== * Western dress codes * Suit * Informal wear ==References * ","title":"Semi-formal wear"},{"id":"2226755","text":"Alexandrina Maria da Costa (30 March 1904 - 13 October 1955), best known as Blessed Alexandrina of Balazar, was a Portuguese mystic and victim soul, member of the Association of Salesian Cooperators, who was born and died in Balazar (a rural parish of P√≥voa de Varzim). Alexandrina left many written works, which have been studied mainly in Italy by Father Umberto Pasquale. On 25 April 2004 she was declared blessed by Pope John Paul II who stated that \\"her secret to holiness was love for Christ\\". ==Early life== General view of Balazar where lived and died Blessed Alexandrina. Alexandrina Maria da Costa was born on 30 March 1904, in Balazar, a rural parish of P√≥voa de Varzim, Portugal. Her father abandoned the family when she was very young. She had only eighteen months' schooling before being sent to work on a farm at the age of nine. In her teens she started to work in Balazar as a seamstress along with her sister.Freze, Michael. 1993, They bore the wounds of Christ, OSV Publishing page 279 Alexandrina said that when she went with other girls to the countryside, she picked flowers that she later used to make flower carpets to the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows in P√≥voa de Varzim. One day, she started bleeding from her head, due to a crown of spines, she said. Jesus spoke to her and called her Alexandrina das Dores (Alexandrina of Sorrows). At 14 years old, in March 1918 an incident changed her life. Her former employer along with two other men tried to break into her room. To escape them, Alexandrina jumped 13 feet down from a window, barely surviving. Her spine was broken from the fall. Until age 19, Alexandrina was still able to \\"drag herself\\" to church where, hunched over, she would remain in prayer, to the great amazement of the parishioners. During the early years, Alexandrina asked the Blessed Mother for the grace of a cure. She suffered gradual paralysis that confined her to bed from 1925 onward. She remained bed-ridden for about 30 years. The parish priest lent her a statue of the Immaculate Heart of Mary for the month of May. She asked for a little altar to be fixed to the wall by her bed where it was graced with the statue of Our Lady of Fatima and decorated with flowers and candles. ==Later life== In June 1938, based on the request of Alexandrina's confessor, Father Mariano Pinho SJ, several bishops from Portugal wrote to Pope Pius XI, asking him to consecrate the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.The first consecration of the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary by Jos√© FerreiraFor Love Alone! by COSTA, Alexandrina Maria (organized by Eug√©nie Signorile and translated into English by Leo Baron Madigan of Lumiar) This request was renewed several times until 1941, in which the Holy See asked three times more information about Alexandrina to the Archbishop of Braga. At that time, Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) was the secretary of the state of the Vatican, and he later performed the consecration of the world.Totus tuus: John Paul II's program of Marian consecration and entrustment by Msgr Arthur Burton Calkins 1992 page 97 The Holy See recognized the relation of Alexandrina Maria da Costa with the act of the World Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary in an article about her life and virtues. After December 1938, she corresponded regularly with Sister Lucia. Blessed Alexandrina's bedroom in Balazar. According to her Vatican biography, from March 1942, for about 13 years until her death, she received no food except for the Holy Eucharist, and her weight dropped to about 33 kilograms (i.e. approximately 73 pounds). She was examined by medical doctors, with no conclusion. Based on the advice of a priest, her sister kept a diary of Alexandrina's words and mystical experiences. According to her Vatican autobiography Jesus spoke to her, at one point saying: \\"You will very rarely receive consolation... I want that while your heart is filled with suffering, on your lips there is a smile\\". In 1944, she joined the \\"Union of Salesian Cooperators\\", offering her suffering for the salvation of souls and for the sanctification of youth. Umberto Pasquale (1906 - 1985) was a Salesian priest and writer. At the beginning of the 1930s, he went to Portugal and in 1944 he met Alexandrina Maria da Costa, the main subject of his books. ==Legacy== Tomb of Blessed Alexandrina in Balazar. Based on her request, the following words were written on her tombstone: :\\"Sinners, if the dust of my body can be of help to save you, come close, walk over it, kick it around until it disappears. But never sin again: do not offend Jesus anymore! Sinners, how much I want to tell you.... Do not risk losing Jesus for all eternity, for he is so good. Enough with sin. Love Jesus, love him!\\". In Ireland there is an Alexandrina Society that spreads knowledge of her life and teachings. The aims of the Society are 1) To spread devotion to Alexandrina and make her known, 2) To pray for the conversion of sinners, 3) To pray for Priests and acknowledge any favours received, 4) To pray for members' intentions. ==See also== * Pope Pius XII Consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary * Mary of the Divine Heart * Anne Catherine Emmerich * Maria Domenica Lazzeri * Marthe Robin * Marie Rose Ferron ==ReferencesFurther reading== * MADIGAN, Leo; Blessed Alexandrina Maria da Costa, the Mystical Martyr of F√°tima.

It has been used for saloon cars/sedans, estate cars/station wagon, and coup√©s - under the Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Audi, SEAT and ≈†koda marques over the years. More recently, Volkswagen Group have introduced a new alphanumeric nomenclature for car platforms. The platform code is composed as follows: * A letter, P, indicating a passenger car platform * A letter indicating the configuration of the engine: ** Q indicates a transverse engine (Quer in German) ** L indicates a longitudinal engine (L√§ngs in German) * A digit indicating the platform size or class (4 corresponding to the \\"B\\" series of platforms) * A digit indicating the generation or evolution An additional + suffix indicates a long-wheelbase variant. ==B1== 19741988\\\\. An Audi derived platform, the first Volkswagen Passat was nearly identical to the Audi 80 (Audi Fox in US), sharing much of its mechanical systems, including its longitudinal engine placement. *VW Passat B1/VW Dasher (Typ 32, 1974‚Äì1981; 1974‚Äì1988 in Brazil) *Audi 80 (Typ 80, 1973‚Äì1976) *Audi 80 (Typ 82, 1977‚Äì1978) ==BX== 19801996\\\\. The BX platform, developed by Volkswagen's Brazilian subsidiary (Volkswagen do Brasil), again borrowed heavily from the Audi 80 (Fox/4000) of the day. The BX platform was used for the Brazilian Volkswagen Gol (hatchback), Voyage (sedan, also sold as the Gacel or Senda in Argentina, Fox in the US, or Amazon in some other markets), Parati (3-door wagon/estate), Saveiro (pickup) and Furg√£o (van) models. The BX platform was quite unique in that it started life with a four-cylinder Volkswagen air-cooled engine (borrowed from the Volkswagen Beetle), and eventually ended up with a more modern water-cooled engine, being sold in the US for the first time as a 1987 model. The VW BX family was restyled in 1987 and 1991. ==B2== Still an Audi derived platform, this time based on the Audi 80/4000, again, including its longitudinal engine placement and, on some European models, the quattro four- wheel drive system, rebranded Syncro for Volkswagen cars. The Santana (facelifted) was produced until 2012 in China. *Volkswagen Passat B2 (Typ 32B, 1981‚Äì1988; 19842012 in China; 19821988 in the US where it was sold as the Quantum) *Audi 80 and 90 (Typ 81, 1979‚Äì1987) *Audi 4000 (Typ 85, 1984‚Äì1987) *Audi Coup√© (Typ 85, 1981‚Äì1987) *Audi Quattro (Typ 85, 1981‚Äì1991) *Audi Sport Quattro (1984‚Äì1987) *Volkswagen Santana (Typ 33, 1984‚Äì2006) ==B3== The B3 Volkswagen Passat was the first B platform car to be called Passat in the United States. The B3 was also the first Passat with an independently designed platform: it did not share parts with Audi models. Instead, the design borrowed heavily from the Volkswagen Group A2 platform, being essentially a stretched version of it, and sharing the same transverse engine layout. *Volkswagen Passat B3 (Typ 35i, 1988‚Äì1993; 19901994 in US) The Volkswagen Corrado was an A2 platform car, but it borrowed heavily from the B3 Passat platform for ancillary components (the VR6 version borrowed some suspension components from the A3 platform too). The \\"B3\\" designation is also used to refer to the \\"Typ 89\\" version of the Audi 80/90 produced from 1987 to 1992 and the \\"Typ 8B\\" Audi Coup√© and S2. However these are not based on the same platform as the B3 Passat, being longitudinally engined cars, and that platform should be considered the \\"true\\" B3, being the B-class platform historically longitudinally engined and primarily developed by Audi rather than Volkswagen. ==B4== The B4 Passat was a face lifted B3 (receiving its own generation number is controversial), remaining nearly mechanically identical, but with entirely new sheetmetal, and an updated interior design. *Volkswagen Passat B4 (Typ 35i, 1993‚Äì1996; U.S. 19951997) The \\"B4\\" designation is also used to refer to the \\"Typ 8C\\" version of the Audi 80 and RS2 produced from 1991 to 1994. However these are not based on the same platform as the B4 Passat. These are developed from the longitudinal B3 platform too, with some modifications such as an extended rear overhang, longer wheelbase, redesigned suspension and fuel tank. ==PL45 (B5)== The B5 platform employs a longitudinal engine placement, which differs from the Volkswagen Group A platform which have been traditionally transversely mounted. This platform (also known as PL45 under the new VAG scheme) was introduced with the first-generation Audi A4 and the 1996 Volkswagen Passat. B5 platform cars can be equipped with a multilink front suspension and a Torsen centre differential for quattro or 4motion branded four-wheel drive systems. A long-wheelbase derivative of this platform - originally designed for the Chinese market and being used in the 1999 Volkswagen Passat Lingyu, but ultimately being used for its rebadged version under the ≈†koda brand, the 2002 ≈†koda Superb - is referred to as PL45+. In late 2000, the B5 Passat received a facelift, referred to as \\"B5.5\\". ===PL45=== *Audi A4 (Typ 8D, Avant 8D5, 1994‚Äì2002) *Audi S4 (Typ 8D, 1997‚Äì2002) *Volkswagen Passat B5 (Typ 3B, 1996‚Äì2000) *Audi RS4 Avant (Typ 8D, 2000‚Äì2001) *Volkswagen Passat B5.5 (Typ 3BG, 2000‚Äì2005) ===PL45+=== *Volkswagen Passat Lingyu B5 (Typ 9F, 2005‚Äì2011; long-wheelbase version for Chinese market) *≈†koda Superb (Typ 3U, 2001‚Äì2008) ==PL46 (B6)== The designation \\"B6\\" is used to identify the \\"Typ 8E\\" Audi A4/S4 produced from late 2000 to 2005. The platform used by these models is formally known as the PL46 platform. Confusingly, the historical generation of Volkswagen's Passat are also colloquially referred to as \\"B6\\", given that they are Volkswagen's sixth generation mid-sized saloon. However this generation of the Passat uses the PQ46 platform, a stretched version of the transverse engined Golf Mk5 and Jetta Mk5's PQ35 platform, also known as A6 to distinguish it from the \\"true\\" B6 platform. ===PL46 (B6) === *Audi A4 (Typ 8E/8H (saloon: 8E2, Avant: 8E5) / 8H7 (Cabriolet), 2001‚Äì2005) *Audi S4 (Typ 8E/8H (saloon: 8E2, Avant: 8E5) / 8H7 (Cabriolet), 2003‚Äì2005) === PQ46 (A6) === *Volkswagen Passat CC (3C, 20082011) *Volkswagen CC (35, 20122017) *Volkswagen Passat (B6/B7) (3C, 20052014) *Volkswagen Passat NMS, North America/China/Korea (NMS [stretched 3C], 2011‚Äìpresent) *Volkswagen Sharan/SEAT Alhambra (7N, 2010present) *Volkswagen Tiguan (5N, 20072017) *≈†koda Superb (3T, 20082015) ==PL47 (B7)== The Audi A4, S4 and RS4 has a \\"B7\\" generation, from 2005 to 2008. However, this seventh generation of the car was a minor revision of the PL46 platform, but with major revisions to engine ranges, suspension revisions, updated chassis and consumer electronics, and restyled bodywork. The B7 A4/S4 retains the Typ 8E/8H numbers of the B6 A4/S4, though with different suffixes, while the SEAT Exeo though it has derived from the Audi A4 B7 takes the Typ 3R number. === PL47 (B7) === *Audi A4 (Typ 8E2 (saloon), 8E5 (Avant), 8H7 (Cabriolet), 2005‚Äì2008**) *Audi S4 (Typ 8E2 (saloon), 8E5 (Avant), 8H7 (Cabriolet), 2006‚Äì2008) *Audi RS4 quattro (Typ 8E2 (saloon), 8E5 (Avant), 8H7 (Cabriolet), 2006‚Äì2008) *SEAT Exeo (Typ 3R5 (saloon), 3R9 (Sport Tourer), 20092013) **Audi 2009 Cabriolet was a carry-over from the 2008 model year ==MLB/MLP (B8)== The MLB (Modularer L√§ngsbaukasten in German) or MLP (Modular Longitudinal Platform) component matrix is used in the B8 (A4, A5, Q5), C7 (A6, A7, Q7) and D4 (A8) families of Audi vehicles. This is noteworthy for placing the front differential ahead of the clutch, allowing the front axle to be moved forward 4 inches. This results in an increase in wheelbase and a slightly more rearward weight distribution for better vehicle dynamics. ==References== * * ==External links== *Volkswagen Group corporate website B ","title":"Volkswagen Group B platform"},{"id":"2226760","text":"The World Scrabble Championship 2001 was the sixth World Scrabble Championship. The winner was Brian Cappelletto of the United States.http://www.scrabble-assoc.com/tourneys/2001/wsc/#prizes The event took place at The Venetian on the Las Vegas Strip, USA. The eighty-eight players played eight games on each of the first three days, in a Swiss tournament. As usual, the top two players then competed in a best-of-five final to decide who would become world champion. ==Results== After the Swiss tournament, the top two players were Brian Cappelletto representing the United States, with 18 wins and winning spread of +921, and Joel Wapnick, defending champion from 1999, with 17 wins and winning spread +1006. These two players thus contested the final. In the first game of the final, Wapnick played first. Both players began by changing tiles, then exchanged straightforward bingos (ANALYSE and IRATELY respectively). Further highlights included Wapnick's WHEEP and BAJU and Cappelletto's INDUSIA. In the final move, trailing 482-464 and with only the O remaining on his rack, Cappelletto needed to score 16 points to force a draw. Unfortunately for him, there was no such move available and, while he played the best available move (ZO for 13), Wapnick took the game 482-479. The second game was less high-scoring, with only two bonuses; Wapnick's DRESSING and CONDOLER. Despite this, Cappelletto won the game 410-372 to level the match at 1-1. In the third game, Wapnick began the game with a bonus (LOURINg for 64), but Cappelletto won a claustrophobic game 400-352, and lead the match 2-1. Notably, he finished with just six seconds left, and his opponent had only four seconds remaining. The fourth game proved decisive, as Cappelletto again won by a comfortable margin, 444 to 338. By three games to one, Brian Cappelletto was declared World Scrabble Champion 2001. ==Complete Results== {  - bgcolor=\\"#ececec\\" !Position !Name !Country !Win-Loss !Spread !Prize (USD) - !1 Cappelletto, BrianUnited States18-6align=\\"right\\"+921align=\\"right\\"25,000 -

Since 1921, the stadium has been the home of Torquay United Football Club, who currently compete in the National League, the fifth tier of English football. During the first half of the 2018-19 National League South season, the stadium also hosted Truro City games. ==History== At the time of Torquay United's formation in 1899, Plainmoor was the home of Torquay Athletic Rugby Football Club. In 1904, the rugby club secured the lease of the Recreation Ground, where United had been playing, and United's Torquay and District League rivals Ellacombe moved into the vacated site at Plainmoor, leaving United homeless. In 1910 United merged with Ellacombe to become Torquay Town. Ellacombe‚Äôs Plainmoor ground became the home of the new club, and the shared home of local rivals Babbacombe. Main Stand at Plainmoor in 1981 Torquay Town and Babbacombe finally merged and became Torquay United (again) in 1921. In 1927 United were elected into Division Three South of the Football League. A new wooden grandstand costing ¬£150 (around ¬£8,958.33 todayhttps://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary- policy/inflation/inflation-calculator) was erected for United‚Äôs inaugural season in the Football League; it had previously stood at Buckfastleigh Racecourse, where its twin can still be seen today. The roof of the stand was blown off during a gale in 1930. Very little changed for the next fifty years as the ground saw generations of supporters move through its turnstiles. During the 1954/55 season over 21,000 fans watched Torquay‚Äôs 0-1 defeat at the hands of Huddersfield Town. The same season also saw United become one of the first lower division clubs to introduce floodlights to their ground. David Webb came to Plainmoor in 1984 and prompted a few cosmetic changes to the terracing. Then on 16 May 1985,http://www.thisisdevon.co.uk/Work-starting- Plainmoor-month/story-12753881-detail/story.html \\"This is Devon - Work starting at Plainmoor next month\\" Retrieved 15 August 2011 just six days after the Bradford City stadium fire, a third of the old grandstand was destroyed during an early morning blaze.http://www.fanzone.co.uk/Team/Torquay-United- Football-Club.aspx \\"Fanzone - Torquay United F.C.\\" Retrieved 15 August 2011 Nobody was hurt, but as a result, the ground‚Äôs capacity fell to below 5,000. In the few years after the fire the ground saw little change. At one point the manager‚Äôs office and changing rooms were situated in a couple of portable cabins behind the old Mini Stand. During the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s, Plainmoor has finally seen some major changes. The old Mini Stand made way for the all-seating Family Stand, which also houses offices, the boardroom and the club shop, as well as the pub and restaurant Boots and Laces, and the 200 Club bar. The Cowshed, made out of corrugated iron and wood, was replaced at the Ellacombe end of the ground by the old mini-stand, while a TV gantry sits on top of the popular side stand. Also, in time for the beginning of the 2000/01 season, the new Sparkworld Stand was opened to accommodate away fans. The main stand that was originally from Buckfastleigh Racecourse was demolished in the autumn of 2011 and accordingly the ground capacity was reduced. A new stand filling the complete length of the pitch, unlike the previous stand, was erected during the 2011-2012 season and opened in August 2012, in time for the start of the following season. It was named Bristow's Bench after the late former director, Paul Bristow who so generously supported the club after a lottery win. In December 2012 a big screen was installed between the popular side and the away end. On 15 September 2014, Torquay United announced a four-year deal with local company Launa Windows to rename Plainmoor to 'The Launa Windows Stadium', presumably in an effort to increase revenue. ==Future== The land is still owned by the local council, talks about the club purchasing the ground have taken place on several occasions in the past. In the not too distant past there was some talk of re-location, Mike Bateson believed that would only happen if: * Torquay saw a multimillion-pound sale or two. * The authorities pay the club to make way for further development of Westlands school. * The club become League One regulars (at present in the National League). After ownership of Torquay United was transferred to Gaming International under the company name Riviera Stadium Limited, talks with Torbay Council have re-opened about the purchase of Plainmoor and developing the ground into housing. ==Record attendance== * 21,908 v Huddersfield Town, FA Cup 4th Rd, 29 January 1955. *Record away attendance - Truro City v Torquay United (2,760), National League South, 1 January 2019. * * * ==External links== * Plainmoor at StadiumDB ==References== Category:Football venues in England Category:Buildings and structures in Torquay Category:Torquay United F.C.

Her mother, Lady Saltoun, is the suo jure Lady Saltoun and the Chief of the name and arms of Fraser. Her father was great-grandson of Queen Victoria. As the eldest daughter without any brothers, Fraser is the heir presumptive to the chiefship and the lordship held by her mother. Since one cannot become the chief of a clan without taking the clan's surname, Lord Lyon King of Arms recognized her use of the surname Fraser in 1973. On 20 April 2005, Fraser was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Aberdeenshire. ==Marriage and children== In February, 1980, the engagement between Fraser and Captain Mark Malise Nicolson (b. 29 September 1954) was announced. Fraser and Captain Nicolson married on 3 May 1980. They have three children: * Louise Alexandra Patricia Nicolson (born 2 September 1984) * Juliet Victoria Katharine Nicolson (born 3 March 1988) * Alexander William Malise Fraser (born 5 July 1990) As Katharine's heir-apparent, Alexander bears the surname \\"Fraser\\" and not his father's surname. ==References== Category:1957 births Category:Clan Fraser Category:Living people Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Aberdeenshire ","title":"Katharine Fraser, Mistress of Saltoun"},{"id":"2226817","text":"The Fox sitcom Married... with Children aired its pilot on April 5, 1987, and its series finale aired on May 5, 1997, with the episode \\"The Desperate Half- Hour (Part 1)\\" and \\"How to Marry a Moron (Part 2)\\". A total of 259 original episodes aired during the program's run. Currently, all 11 seasons are available on DVD, in Region 1. The list is ordered by the episodes' original air dates. Specials that aired during a regular season run are highlighted in yellow in the list. A season 3 episode, \\"I'll See You in Court\\", is known as the \\"lost episode\\" and did not air in North America until June 18, 2002, five years after the series' original run. == Series overview EpisodesSeason 1 (1987)=== The first season of Married... with Children introduces the major characters: Al, Peg, Kelly and Bud Bundy, along with their neighbors, Steve and Marcy Rhoades. The first season is the only one in which Al and Peg are regularly intimate, to the point of Al initiating the sessions. It is also the only one where Peg can be seen doing housework under normal circumstances (despite being bad at it), and she even has her own car, a red Ford Mustang (as seen in \\"Sixteen Years and What Do You Get\\"). In \\"Thinergy,\\" Bud mentions that Kelly had been held back a year in school. Al's dislike of the French is first shown in this season and it is also the first time that he calls Marcy a \\"chicken.\\" It also contains the first mention of Peg's family being \\"hillbillies\\" from the fictional Wanker County, Wisconsin. ===Season 2 (1987‚Äì88) === At the beginning of the second season, Kelly is portrayed as a girl of reasonable intelligence (though she is often teased by Bud for her promiscuity and bleached hair). By the end, however, her character obtains her trademark stupidity that will become both a plot device and comic focus for the rest of the series. This season also contains the first use of the \\"Bundy Cheer\\" and the first instance of the Bundys leaving Chicago. Additionally, it marked the beginning of the \\"Thank your father, kids\\" running gag. Although Buck is portrayed in later seasons as having been with the Bundys since he was a pup, Peg implies that they have had him for only three years and Al states that he is actually Bud's pet; he even \\"speaks\\" once (\\"Buck Can Do It\\"), something that becomes a regular feature beginning in the fourth season. Michael Faustino (David's younger brother) makes the first of five guest appearances during the course of the series. ===Season 3 (1988‚Äì89) === The third season marks a notable increase in the show's popularity, based on Terry Rakolta's morality campaign against the show, which began after the episode \\"Her Cups Runneth Over\\", where Al and Steve go to a lingerie store in search of Peggy's favorite bra (which had been discontinued). This season also contains the \\"lost episode\\" \\"I'll See You in Court\\", which was not aired in North America until June 18, 2002, after the show's initial run on the cable channel FX (and was included in the season-three DVD set). Michael Faustino makes his second guest appearance. During the season, the show became the first to have a quarter of the viewership on Fox. ===Season 4 (1989‚Äì90) === The fourth season had the departure of Marcy's husband Steve Rhoades. Marcy remained single for the remainder of the season. This was also the first season where the audience would applaud when a major character would enter a scene for the first time in the episode, and a Bundyesque version of the classic film It's a Wonderful Life. In the episode \\"It's a Bundyful Life (Part 2),\\" Ted McGinley makes a guest appearance as Norman Jablonsky before reappearing as a regular cast member in the next season as Jefferson D'Arcy. Also, Michael Faustino makes his third guest appearance. ===Season 5 (1990‚Äì91)=== The fifth season marked the introduction of Jefferson D'Arcy (Ted McGinley), as Marcy's new husband. The series reached its 100th episode this season, which was the pilot for the spin-off Top of the Heap, the first of three spinoffs from Married... with Children. Al's favorite show Psycho Dad is also first referred to in this season, along with his first mention of scoring four touchdowns in one high school football game. ===Season 6 (1991‚Äì92)=== Throughout the season, both Peg and Marcy were pregnant, as Katey Sagal was pregnant in real life. Sagal's child was stillborn six weeks before term, causing her to miss four episodes of this season. At the end of the season's 11th episode, \\"Al Bundy, Shoe Dick\\", the women's pregnancies were revealed to be merely part of one of Al's nightmares. This season also had Steve Rhoades return for one episode, Kelly becoming the \\"Verminator\\", and the Bundys traveling to England. Additionally, this season introduced Bud's hip hop- inspired alter ego \\"Grandmaster B\\", concocted to help him with women, which continued after the dream revelation by having Al ask Bud about the nickname and Bud deciding that he likes it enough to use it. ===Season 7 (1992‚Äì93)=== In the seventh season, the writers introduced Seven (played by Shane Sweet) in an attempt to give the Bundys a third child. When the audience was unreceptive, he was removed from the series with no explanation other than being left at the D'Arcys' (Seven was last seen being told a bedtime story in \\"Peggy and the Pirates\\"). However, a subtle reference to him is made in season eight, episode 22, when he appears as the missing child on a carton of milk. Bud also loses his virginity during this season and he makes his first appearance with a beard (which was mistaken for dirt in the episode where Bud first notices he is growing a beard). Steve Rhoades also makes another guest appearance during this season, as do Dan Castellaneta and Michael Faustino. ===Season 8 (1993‚Äì94) === The eighth season introduces many of Al's friends, including Aaron, Bob Rooney, and Officer Dan (though Officer Dan was not a character in the earlier seasons, the actor who played him also appeared in \\"Rock 'n Roll Girl\\" as the sheriff who issued Al a ticket for an insulting bumper sticker, \\"Weenie Tot Lovers and Other Strangers\\" as the police officer who arrested Al, and \\"The Egg and I\\" as the FBI agent searching for Steve). Al, Jefferson, Bob Rooney, and Officer Dan (along with Griff and Ike, who are introduced in season nine) all become members of NO MA'AM in the episode where the men fight back against a talk show host (played by Jerry Springer) known as \\"The Masculine Feminist\\". This is also the season where Bud joins a fraternity. The closest to an explanation for Seven's mysterious disappearance 14 months before is in the episode \\"Ride Scare\\", where a closeup on a carton of milk reveals a picture of Seven with the word \\"Missing\\". Al's plus-sized model friends simply look at it without comment before helping themselves. ===Season 9 (1994‚Äì95) === The ninth season rounds out the cast of Al's friends by introducing Griff, who works at Gary's Shoes with Al, and Ike. Steve Rhoades also makes his final two appearances during this season. The season also includes the cancellation of Psycho Dad, Bud getting a job as a driving examiner, and the first appearances of shoe-store owner Gary (who turns out to be a woman), Marcy's niece Amber (who was introduced as a foil for Bud, before being dropped from the show after a couple of episodes), and reporter Miranda Veracruz De La Hoya Cardinal. Michael Faustino makes his fifth and final guest appearance. ===Season 10 (1995‚Äì96)=== The tenth season had the death of family pet Buck and his subsequent reincarnation into the body of Lucky, the Bundys' next dog. The season also marks the first appearances of Peggy's father Ephraim (played by Tim Conway) and Peggy's mother, who moves in with the Bundys (although she is never seen, only heard). Also, Peg leaves Al and goes on a search for her father. ===Season 11 (1996‚Äì97)=== The 11th season was the final season of Married... with Children. Fox moved the show's time slot several times throughout the course of the season, which cost the show ratings. Rising production costs and decreasing viewer shares led to the show's cancellation in April 1997, after the final taping for season 11. Due to this decision, no official \\"final\\" episode of Married... with Children was shown. While \\"How to Marry a Moron\\" was the final episode to be shot, \\"Chicago Shoe Exchange\\" was the last episode that Fox broadcast. This was the only season to feature teaser scenes before the opening credits, and a few episodes during this season also featured tag scenes just before the closing credits. For this season, the still of Al and Peggy sitting on the couch was dropped from the closing credits, which for this season are shown against a black background and in a separate card format, instead of scrolling. The opening theme was also greatly shortened, dropping the highway scenes taken from National Lampoon's Vacation, and the scene where Al hands every member of his family money. ==Specials== {  style=\\"width:100%; background:#F2F2F2; text-align:center\\" - ! ff0;\\" Airdate ! ff0;\\" Title ! ff0;\\" Station -  December 12, 1986 (taping date)  \\"Unaired Pilot\\"  Unaired - fff;\\"  January 1, 1998  Bundymania  ProSieben (Germany) -  August 26, 2001  Married... with Children: The E!

It is located 65 kilometers from Tegucigalpa. ==History== The municipality of Yuscar√°n was founded in 1730. After gold, silver and other precious metals were found in its foothills in 1746, Spanish mining companies flooded the area and Spaniards settled the town. Thus, Yuscar√°n was constructed in the traditional colonial style of 18th-century Spain. Years of exploitation by the Spanish and later by North American mining companies followed, bringing both advantages and disadvantages. At its height, Yuscar√°n was a wealthy mining town and home to some of Honduras's most influential families. It was one of the first places in Honduras to get electricity in 1898 ‚Äì even before Tegucigalpa. Because of its importance, it was declared the capital of the El Para√≠so Department in 1869. However, after the mining stopped, most of the foreigners supporting Yuscar√°n abandoned the town, taking their money and possessions with them. In 1979 Yuscar√°n was declared a National Monument. In its center there are more than 200 colonial homes. Natives of Yuscar√°n include the painter Teresita Fort√≠n. ==Geography== The mountain of Montserrat towers over the town to the southeast. This biological reserve is also the main source of water for the area, the same water that the villagers use to produce the Yuscaran-brand sugar cane alcohol aguardiente. ==Economy== With the decline of the mining industry came the rise of another industry, from which Yuscar√°n gets its present-day fame: the fabrication of aguardiente, or guaro. The Yuscar√°n factory, also called the Distileria del Buen Gusto, was founded in 1939.

It was written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman with cover art by Larry Elmore. It is the story of a young man, born without magic in a society where magic is life, who has been prophesied to destroy the world. The books are published by Bantam Spectra, the science fiction division of Random House.http://www.randomhouse.com/gm/results.pperl?x=0&y;=0&title;_auth_isbn=Darksword Each book of the trilogy reached the New York Times best seller list. ==Overview== The Darksword Trilogy consists of Forging the Darksword (December 1, 1987), Doom of the Darksword (May 1988), and Triumph of the Darksword (September 1988). A fourth book is a sequel, Legacy of the Darksword (June 1998). The role-playing game is Darksword Adventures (December 1988). == Characters Main characters=== ;Joram :The son of the Emperor and Empress of Merilon, and heir to the throne, Joram was born completely Dead (devoid of magical power) in a society where magic is considered life. He is left to die but a distraught woman named Anja finds him and takes him to replace her own stillborn child. :Anja teaches Joram sleight-of-hand tricks and non-magical illusions to conceal the fact that he has no magic of his own. Joram's lack of magical ability is discovered and he flees to the Outland while Anja dies trying to protect him. In the wilds of the Outland, Joram joins the outlawed Technologists who are practicing the long-forbidden Mystery of Death, Technology. :There he plans to forge the Darksword, a blade capable of absorbing magic. However, his plans are delayed because forging such a sword requires a Catalyst (special magicians that have little personal magic but are necessary to enhance the magic powers of all the others). Saryon is sent by Bishop Vanya, ostensibly to capture Joram. The two are opposed to the tyranny displayed by Blachloch, and Joram convinces Saryon to help him forge the Darksword. Then, together with Simkin and Mosiah, they leave the village for Merilon so Joram can claim his heritage. :Joram and Gwendolyn live \\"Beyond\\" - the technological Planet Earth - for ten years (but only one year in Thimhallan time), and Gwendolyn goes mad. Joram meets Menju, a mage from Thimhallan. Simkin changed into a copy of the Darksword and placed by Joram on Merlyn's tomb. Merlyn's spirit was awakened and transported mankind and the Magic to a new world, so men could make a new start. :With this, Joram fulfilled the prophecy: He was born Dead and lived, died by Smythe's poison and resurrected by Simkin, and held his hand into the destruction of the world (by the Hch'nyv) or its salvation (by awakening Merlin who saved mankind). ;Father Saryon :Saryon is a scholarly catalyst with a natural talent for mathematics. A transgression in his youth, as well as the traumatizing experience of performing the tests that proved the Empress's son to be Dead, led him to question the tenets of his faith more than others of his order. He is sent by Bishop Vanya to track down Joram in the Technologists' village so that Joram can be captured. However, Saryon ends up siding with Joram, and becomes something of a father figure to the younger man. When Joram had to undergo the Turning (being turned into stone while still living, thus experiencing eternal suffering), Saryon took his place allowing Joram to escape. After Joram releases the magic from Thimhallan, Saryon leaves for Earth with the other survivors. ;Mosiah :Mosiah is a field magus who grew up with Joram in the village of Walren. He befriended Joram despite the other's taciturn nature, and proves to be a trustworthy friend and ally of Joram's. Mosiah is naturally gifted at magic, though he was never formally trained in its use. He became one of the Duuk-tsarith on Earth under the charge of King Garald ;Simkin :Simkin is one of Joram's companions, a powerful magus who seemingly has no morals or regard for human life. He is well known in all the royal courts in Thimhallan and often regales his friends with scandalous tales and gossip about the nobility. As many characters in the novels remark, Simkin has a game of his own to play, though he chooses to not reveal his true motivations to anyone, preferring to put people in various alarming situations in order to see how they react. :Not much is known about Simkin's age, he could be 100 years old or as old as time itself. Simkin, however, can look anything from 14 to 75 years old. In Legacy of the Darksword, Simkin reveals that he truly is \\"Magic\\". ===Villains=== ;Bishop Vanya :As the Bishop of the realm, he is one of the only people apart from the Duuk-tsarith who is aware of the Prophecy. He fears that Joram will bring the Prophecy to fruition, and does all that he can to ensure that Joram is captured‚Äîthough whether this is out of concern for the good of the realm, or in order to protect his own political power, is debatable. ;Blachloch :Blachloch is a Duuk-tsarith spy in the Technologist Village. He overthrew the real leader Andon by claiming he left the order of the Duuk-tsarith and rallying the technologists into fighting Merilon, thus making himself more popular than the pacifist Andon. He even went as far as making an alliance with Sharakan. His true plan was to start a war between Sharakan and Merilon, helping Merilon behind the scenes. Before he could make his plan reality, he was killed by Joram and Saryon who had just finished the Darksword. When he ordered Saryon to channel magic to him for use to attack Joram, Saryon did the illegal and drain magic from him instead, making him helpless. After that, it was revealed he was working for Vanya instead of being a renegade. ;Prince/Emperor Xavier :Xavier is Joram's uncle and second in line to the throne of Merilon. (Joram being the first.) He is a D'karn-Duuk (a warmaster). The right to rule in Thimhallan is determined by the family of the queen, thus if the queen dies, her closest family member takes over the throne, in this case Xavier. His only problem was that because the Emperor kept his wife 'alive' by using illusions, Xavier could not do anything but wait until the people realized the truth. But when the truth arose, and Joram was sentenced to the Turning, Xavier quickly took the chance and crowned himself emperor. Garald challenged him to war, which he gladly took. However, when both armies clashed, a third army came, which consisted of Dead people using Iron Creatures and people with Iron skin (which were in fact tanks and infantry of future earth). Because he could not defeat this threat, he became mentally unstable and was later killed by a shot from one of the tanks. ;Kevon Smythe :Kevon Smythe is the leader of the Technomancers in Legacy of the Darksword. Smythe is trying to get a hold of the second darksword forged by Joram in order to trade it to an alien race known as the Hch'nyv. The Hch'nyv are an extremely violent alien race bent upon the destruction of all human life. The diviners of the Hch'nyv have prophesied that the dark sword could be their great undoing. Smythe agrees to deliver them the darksword and allow them to take over Earth if the Hch'nyv will allow him and his people to take over Thimhallan. The Hch'nyv agree to this but they have no intention of keeping their bargain. ==PlotThe Prophecy=== In the chaotic times after the Iron Wars (in which the Technologists attempted to take over the world), the Bishop of the Realm decided to attempt a vision of the future, in order to calm the fears of the populace. In the month leading up to the attempt, he secluded himself in a small room and fasted, in order to purify himself. The spell succeeded, but the strain was too much for the Bishop's weakened body. He died before the Prophecy was given in full, and the theurgist assisting him was rendered catatonic. Since the theurgist was the last of his profession in the world, no further attempts to see the future could be undertaken. The Prophecy begins \\"There will be born to the Royal House one who is Dead yet will live, who will die again and live again. And when he returns, he will hold in his hand the destruction of the world--\\" It is revealed in Triumph of the Darksword that the broken-off sentence would have ended with \\"or its salvation\\". It is also revealed that The Prophecy was only supposed to be a warning. ===The Nine Mysteries=== ;Fire :After the testing, a magus who is powerful in the mystery of fire is taken to a place known only as the Mountain to begin training as one of the Duuk-tsarith (warlocks and witches). Those who show greater potential are kept for three additional years of training to become a 'DKarn-duuk (warmaster). ;Water :Those born to the mystery of water are called druids. There are three types of druid: :*Field druids, Fihanish, who help the field magi clear the land for farming. :*Druids of minor healing, Mannanish, who deal with cuts and scrapes. :*Druids of major healing, Theldara, who deal with broken bones. ;Earth :Those born to the mystery of earth are born either: :*Mon-alban, the alchemists, who change metals into more useful metals. :*Quin-alban, the conjurers, who use Life as the only material in their work. :*Pron-alban, the shapers, who can alter materials and produce chairs from a single piece of wood or a fort from a mountain. :*Albanara, the noble magi born to rule, who possess skills in all parts of the earth mystery. ;Air :Any magus born to this mystery is either a Kan-hanar, a gate keeper, or a Sif-hanar, a weather changer. It is the Sif- hanar that keep the city of Merilon in perpetual spring; when most of the Sif- hanar were killed in the battle on the Field of Glory, Merilon passed from spring to winter, much to the horror of the city's inhabitants. ;Shadow :This mystery's practitioners are called illusionists. Illusionists are the artists of Thimhallan. They use Life to create plays, music, and images of dragons and other creatures. ;Life :The rare magi born to this mystery are known as catalysts or thaumaturgists. A catalyst does not possess magic in great measure himself; however, he possesses the unique ability to channel Life. A catalyst takes magical energy from his surroundings and, by assimilating it within his own body, is able to enhance it and transfer it to magi who can wield it. Catalysts are recruited into the clergy of Thimhallan. ;Spirit :This mystery allows magi to communicate with the dead, but its practitioners were allegedly wiped out during the Iron Wars, and have been suppressed by the Church ever since. Devotees of this mystery are called necromancers. Also born to this mystery are enchanters, who change the desires of people, and theurgists, who can communicate directly with the Almin (God). ;Time :This mystery deals with the future and the past. The magi of Time, known as Diviners, also created the Corridors, holes in time and space that take a person from one place to another. The Corridors became the main form of transportation for all magi. When the Diviners were wiped out during the Iron Wars, the Corridors were maintained by the Kan-hanars Life while the church took control of the use of the Corridors. It is stated in Darksword Adventures that for a person to be a Diviner, one parent must also be a Diviner. ;Death (Technology) :This mystery is believed to have been banished from the world. This mystery gives Life to that which is Dead, an unforgivable sin. The magi of Death are known as Sorcerers, and they make and use magical devices (wands, scrolls, potions, and similar items). These nine mysteries were known as the Mysteries of Light. Prior to the Great Passage from Earth to Thimhallan, there were four Mysteries of Darkness that were cast out, since its members wanted revenge against the Mundanes for the persecution they suffered. These mysteries were the negative aspects of Earth, Air, Fire and Water: War, Famine, Pestilence and Spirit-Death. ==Reception== Forging the Darksword reached 15 on the New York Times bestseller list on December 27, 1987.

Richard Joseph Camellion, as described in the books, is a master of disguise, the martial arts and wet-work. Cynical and lethal in equal measure, his normal employer was the CIA ‚Äì at a cost of $100,000 a mission. He is described on the back of the books as \\"Richard Camellion, master of death, destruction, and disguise. He gets the dirty jobs, the impossible missions, the operations that cannot be handled by the FBI, CIA, or any other legal or extra-legal force. He is a man without a face, without a single identifying characteristic...except that he succeeds by being a Merchant of Death!\\" == Fictional character biography == According to information in #30, The Shambhala Strike, Camellion was born in St. Louis, Missouri. He keeps a ranch in Votaw, Texas, where he lives when not on a mission and has two pet pigs, known as Damon and Pythias. Two books, #30 The Shambhala Strike and #53 The Judas Scrolls mention Camellion studying at St. Louis University, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree. It is stated in the former book that Camellion holds a degree in engineering from Washington University in St. Louis. Three other books (#1 The Death Merchant, #9 Laser Mission, #11 Manhattan Wipeout) mention that Camellion is an ex- teacher of history, but this may simply be a cover story. Camellion is very interested in the occult and the prophecies of Nostradamus. Camellion's father was in the hardware business (#13, The Mato Grosso Horror). Camellion donates an unspecified percentage of his fees for each mission to assist struggling college students and also the underprivileged in Texas (#17, \\"The Zemlya Expedition\\"). The character uses at least one alias in every book. Examples: James Valdorian, Chester Giffwangle, Leonard Higgdon, Emil Milrich, Milton Sessions, Ludwig Huelsenbeck, Thomas Wang-Ji. On two occasions, when asked if Camellion is his real name, he replies that it does not matter. #63 The Soul Search Project reveals that Richard Joseph Camellion is not the name on his birth certificate. In the first book, he is hired by the Mafia to kill an informant. In later books, he never works for organized crime again but accepts missions from the ONI (Office of Naval Intelligence), NSA, CIA and MAD (West German counter-intelligence) The series is more nihilistic than many of its 1970s and 1980s action series counterparts; Camellion does not think twice about killing innocent people if it is the quickest way to get the mission accomplished. For example, #62, The Soul Search Project sees his team killing 18 New York Police Department officers who try to stop them during a mission. Another book series by Rosenberger, COBRA, features similar characters in this regard. == The books == 1\\\\. The Death Merchant ‚Äì Richard Camellion versus the Chicago mob. 2\\\\.

After the death of his father, Peter took the side of his sisters Mafalda, Sancha and Theresa, in their quarrel with his elder brother, now King Afonso II, over inheritance of the castles of Seia, Alenquer and Montemor-o-Novo, Peter got the protection of his sister Theresa, then Queen of Le√≥n, from whose territory he launched several inconclusive attacks on the Portuguese border province of Tr√°s-os-Montes e Alto Douro, but eventually had to concede defeat and perpetual exile from Portugal. Peter then left Le√≥n to become a mercenary in the service of Yusuf II, the Almohad Caliph, commanding a troop of Christian exiles and adventurers in Marrakesh. As such, he was in 1220 involved with the arrival in Morocco of Berard of Carbio and four other Franciscan missionaries. Prior to setting out to the Muslim lands, the Franciscans had met with Peter's sister, who told them that she had \\"a little piece of Morocco in her heart\\" and asked them to give Peter her love.Father Gwenole Jeusset, OFM, \\"Francis and His Friars Face Islam\\", in Holy Land Review, New Series, Vol. 2, Nu.3, Summer 2009 Once arrived, the Franciscans started preaching in Marrakesh and strongly denouncing Islam and Muhammad. The Caliph declared them \\"mad\\" and charged Peter and his Christian soldiers with escorting them out of his kingdom. However, the Franciscans managed to avoid Peter and his men, and repeated their act, highly sacrilegious in Muslim terms, in the market-place of Marrakesh - leading to their being decapitated by the Caliph personally. Subsequently, Peter moved to Aragon, his mother's homeland, where he became involved in the schemes and campaigns of his relative,Queen Petronila of Aragon, Peter's grandmother, had been James's great-grandmother. the young and ambitious King James I. In 1229 Peter - continuing his family tradition of seeking a bride in Catalonia - married Countess Aurembiaix of Urgell, who had long been exiled from Urgell by the usurper Guerau IV de Cabrera, and who had been James I's mistress. With Peter as her husband and co-ruler, James helped Aurembiaix regain Urgell under the Aragonese overlordship - after she and Peter agreed to hand over to the King the city of Lleida (see Acquisition of Urgell). In 1230, Peter helped the Bishop of Tarragona to conquer the Balearic island of Ibiza from the Moors. Following Aurembiaix's death in 1231, Peter continued as Count of Urgell in a titular capacity, but this position was disputed by his overlord James I. In 1236 they came to an agreement by which Peter gave up Urgell, which was given over to the rule of the House of Cabrera and was eventually annexed to Aragon. In exchange, Peter got the newly conquered Balearic islands of Majorca, Ibiza and Formentera, as well as the castles of Pollen√ßa, and Alar√≥ (also in the Baleares) and of Almudaina (in Alicante). Peter ruled these Balearic possessions until his death there in 1258. As he left no legitimate issue, they then reverted to the Aragonese Crown, later becoming the core of Kingdom of Majorca ruled by a minor branch of the Aragonese Royal Family. Peter left two illegitimate sons, Rodrigo and Fernando. ==AncestryReferencesSources== * Category:1187 births Category:1258 deaths Category:People from Coimbra Category:Counts of Urgell Category:Mercenaries Category:House of Burgundy- Portugal Category:Portuguese infantes Category:Crown of Aragon Category:History of the Balearic Islands Category:13th-century Catalan people ","title":"Peter I, Count of Urgell"},{"id":"2226889","text":"La Esperanza () is the capital city and a municipality of the same name of the department of Intibuc√°, Honduras. La Esperanza is famous for having the coolest climate in Honduras. It is considered the heart of the Ruta Lenca (Lenca Trail), a region of Lenca ethnic influence that spans Honduras from Santa Rosa de Copan to Choluteca. Sites on the Lenca Trail have been designated by the government and United Nations development in order to encourage more cultural tourism, and help create new markets for the traditional crafts, such as pottery, practiced by the Lenca, in order to preserve their culture. The city of La Esperanza is merged indistinguishably with the city of Intibuc√°, the head of the neighboring municipality of Intibuc√°. Intibuc√° is the older of the twin cities and was originally an indigenous Lenca community, while La Esperanza is the newer ladino community. Although the two cities have separate municipal governments, they are often referred to jointly as La Esperanza as they are only separated by a city street that crosses the city. Residents of La Esperanza are traditionally referred to as esperanzanos and residents of Intibuc√° as intibucanos. ==History== The area was originally occupied by Maya and Lenca people from pre-Columbian times who formed two settlements called Eramani and Lentercala. In 1647, Mayor Francisco de La Cerda was appointed by the Spanish throne to officially demarcate the territory of the indigenous population. He divided the land into two jurisdictions, not corresponding to the Eramani and Lentercala sites, and created boundaries and names for the surrounding small communities. Over time, the two jurisdictions developed a rivalry, especially over land. The cities grew in population, especially in the 1800s, and La Esperanza was named a villa on 22 September 1848. La Esperanza officially became a city in 1883 when the department of Intibuc√° was formed by separating from the neighbouring department of Lempira, then called Gracias. In 2002, permits were obtained by the Consorcio de Inversiones SA de CV (CISA) to build a hydro electric dam on the Rio Intibuc√° over an abandoned hydro project. Called the La Esperanza Hydro Project after the city, the dam began producing electricity for the surrounding communities in 2003, but its phase two expansion was not completed until 2006. The project was the first in the world to generate Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). ==Geography== Catholic Church in the Central Park of La Esperanza La Esperanza sits at an altitude of 1700 meters, making it the highest city in Honduras. It is bisected by the Rio Intibuc√° which runs from the municipality of Intibuc√° through the municipality of La Esperanza. La Esperanza is situated in a relatively flat mountain valley, bordered by two chains of mountains, the Sierra de Puca Opalaca to the north and Monta√±a Zapochoco to the Southeast. The area of the La Esperanza municipality is 138.8 km2 and Intibuc√° 531 km2.Honduras Geographic Information Systems Data, Honduran National Census, Peace Corps Honduras, 2001. La Esperanza Airport runs along the valley south of the two cities. ===Climate=== La Esperanza experiences two distinct seasons: the rainy season/winter from May to October and the dry season/summer from November to April. The rainiest months are June and September, and the driest months February and March. During the winter, it rains primarily in the afternoon and the intense showers often make small dirt roads into the surrounding mountain communities impassable. La Esperanza receives average annual precipitation of 1400 mm. Due to its high altitude, La Esperanza has a cooler climate than most of Honduras, with an average annual temperature of 18.6 ¬∞C (65.5 ¬∞F). Temperatures in December and January often fall into the 40s at night. Hail has been reported on occasion, but it has never snowed. In the summer, high temperatures reach the 80s, but with low average humidity around 76%. ==Population== The projected population of La Esperanza for 2018 is 13,800, with 9,900 in the urban area and 3,900 in rural areas of the municipality. Additionally, the projected population for the neighboring municipality of Intibuc√° of 63,000 in the municipality, including 23,800 in the urban area and 39,000 in the rural areas, translates to a population of 37,600 in the combined urban areas of La Esperanza and Intibuc√°. === Towns and Hamlets === The municipality has the following five villages (aldeas), which encompass 36 hamlets (caser√≠os): * La Esperanza ** El Terrero ** Finca Las Terrazas o El Refugio ** Finca San Jos√© Del Ed√©n ** Finca Santa Anita ** La Laguna ** La Pozona ** Las Anonas ** Lepaterique ** San Esteban ** Tierra Colorada ** Los Diez Chorritos ** Piedra Menuda ** El Invernadero * Chogola ** Chogola ** Agua Blanca ** El Arenal ** El Mango o Las Pilas ** Hda. de Quiala ** Llano de La Cruz ** Quiala ** Puente Hondo ** La Sierra * El Pel√≥n ** El Pel√≥n ** Llano Chalingua * La Pimienta ** La Pimienta ** El Garrapatero * Nueva Esperanza ** Nueva Esperanza ** El Pastal ** El Pital ** La Monta√±a ** San Antonio ** San Juan o Los Roquitos ** San Vicente ** Palos Blancos ==Culture== The predominant ethnic group are the Lenca people, who have occupied the southwest region of Honduras since pre-Columbian times. The Lenca are the largest ethnic group in Honduras, numbering just over 100,000. The Lenca once had a distinct language which is now extinct. They continue to practice traditional customs and arts, such as the production of textiles and pottery, dances, and clothing. The Lenca people, particularly women, can be recognised by their unique style of dress, including brightly coloured dresses and woven head scarves called pa√±uelos. Daily Lenca fresh produce market Life in La Esperanza and Intibuc√° is centred primarily on agriculture, which is the mainstay of most residents, especially the Lenca. Due to its uniquely cool climate, the department is able to produce products that other departments cannot, including potatoes, strawberries and apples. La Esperanza is famous for its daily farmers market which draws vendors and shoppers from around the department. Lenca farmers arrive from the surrounding communities and sell their fruits and vegetables in the street, while some La Esperanza residents manage permanent wooden stalls. Produce available includes lettuce, spinach, carrots, cucumbers, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes, sweet and hot peppers, yucca, onions, cilantro, apples, blackberries, mangoes, pineapple, bananas, platanos, avocadoes, grapes, peaches and strawberries. The busiest market days are Saturday and Sunday. ===Celebrations=== Dancers in the national dance festival, El Grande de Grandes As in the rest of Honduras, the majority of the population is Roman Catholic, with a growing percentage of Evangelicals. As such, Christmastime or Navidad, and Holy Week preceding Easter, called Semana Santa, are major times of celebration. Christmas Eve, known as Nochebuena, is celebrated with a late-night dinner with family and friends followed by lighting fireworks at midnight. For Holy Week, there is generally a series of processions and activities related to each day. Good Friday, Viernes Santo has the largest procession in a re-enactment of Christ's journey to the cross. The people create alfombras along the path of the procession, designed carpets on the street made of coloured sawdust. Most businesses are closed Thursday (Maundy Thursday) and Friday of Holy Week, which are national holidays. In addition to Christmas and Easter, the people celebrate several other annual festivals and holidays, including: * Artisan Festival (Feria de Artesan√≠a de La Ruta Lenca) ‚Äì February * Anniversary of the Department of Intibuc√° ‚Äì 16 April * National Mushroom and Wine Festival (Festival Nacional del Choro y el Vino) ‚Äì June or July * Potato Festival (Feria de La Papa) ‚Äì July * El Grande de Grandes (International traditional dance competition) ‚Äì the last Saturday in October * Independence from Spain (D√≠a de Independencia) ‚Äì 15 September * Festival of the Patron Saint, Virgin of Conception (Feria Patronal de la Virgen de Concepcion) ‚Äì 29 November to 7 December Festivals may include parades, processions, marching bands, food tents, artisan demonstrations, traditional dancing, live music and fireworks. ===Artisan products=== Local people make a variety of skilled handicrafts. Many women's groups use hand-constructed wooden looms to produce traditional Lenca woven textiles such as ponchos, scarves, shawls, head scarves, table runners and tablecloths in bright colours. A growing number of groups have begun to take advantage of the ample number of fallen pine needles from the surrounding forests, which they weave into sturdy and decorative baskets, pot holders, and vases. White clay local to the region is used to produce a variety of unique ceramic items. La Esperanza is well known for the production of sweet, liqueur-like wines from fruits such as strawberries, pears, peaches, blackberries, and apples as well as the local favourite, potatoes. Visitors to La Esperanza can purchase these items and many other artisan products from around Honduras at one of the three primary souvenir stores in town, UMMIL (Union de Mujeres Microempresarias Lencas de Intibuca), Opalacas, and El Rincon del Turista. ===National Capital of Honduran Folklore=== On 23 July 2013 La Esperanza was declared the national capital of Honduran folklore, in tribute to the folklorist and native son of La Esperanza, Rafael Manzanares Aguilar. Rafael Manzanares was a Honduran folklorist, author and musical composer. He created the Cuadro Nacional De Danzas Folkl√≥ricas de Honduras and was instrumental in the revival of folklore traditions in Honduras. The designation of the capital of Honduran folklore is realised in La Esperanza each year by the folklore festival El Grande de Grandes. Folk dance groups from all parts of Honduras present their regional dances and costumes while competing in this all-day festival. ==Tourism== La Esperanza is located on the route between Tegucigalpa and Western Honduras, making it a convenient place for stopping while traveling in the country. It is a designated site of the Ruta Lenca. La Esperanza/Intibuc√° has plenty of hotels, restaurant and shops in every price range. Some sites of interest in and around La Esperanza include: La Gruta Laguna de Chiligatoro outside of La Esperanza *La Gruta ‚Äì This cave is located on a small hill overlooking town, 5 minutes walk from the Central Park. La Gruta is a shrine to Virgin of the Immaculate Conception (also known as the Virgin of Lourdes) at the top of 31 steps carved by hand in stone of volcanic origin. Religious ceremonies and cultural activities characteristic of the region are performed at the foot of the staircase. According to tradition, La Gruta was made by area residents and inmates of the penal center under orders of the commander of arms J. In√©s P√©rez during the government of Tiburcio Car√≠as Andino. Perez reportedly built it to fulfill a vow that he made while hiding in the cave to escape being killed by his enemies. The staircase forks behind the chapel until it reaches a hill of dense vegetation that affords a dramatic view the city and the surrounding region. *Lenca Cultural Museum ‚Äì This is housed in the Casa de Cultura of La Esperanza, a large pink building two blocks up from the Central Park toward La Gruta. Open Monday through Friday, usually 12-4 pm, it features artefacts, artisan products, and a great deal of information about the history and culture of the Lenca people in the area (in Spanish). By asking a day in advance, docents are available. *Ba√±os Publicos El Quiscamote (Public Baths) ‚Äì This is a spot where people wash their laundry at public water spigots. It also has a small pool for swimming, and tables and chairs for a picnic. People from the area are frequently found here on the hottest days. It is a 15-minute walk outside of town from near La Gruta. *Lenca Market ‚Äì The market features fresh produce, meat and cheese, and household items, clothes and other trinkets. It winds around a few blocks just north of the Intibuc√° Municipal Building. *Parque de Bosque Enano (Dwarf Forest) ‚Äì A short drive out of town on the road to Marcala, the forest contains can encounter over 500 unique dwarf trees that grow less than half a meter tall. Scientists still do not know exactly why this forest exists, but it's an interesting sight to see. There are no signs, services or designated areas; it is necessary to ask a local resident. *Laguna de Madre Vieja (Lagoon of the Old Mother) ‚Äì Arriving from Siguatepeque, you will find this small lagoon on the left side of the road just before entering town. The visitor can fish, rent a rowboat or just enjoy the silence at this tranquil spot. *Laguna de Chiligatoro (Lagoon of Chiligatoro) ‚Äì Just 30 minutes by bus from La Esperanza, this lagoon is an ideal spot to relax and swim for the day or rent a rowboat. There is a nearby restaurant with tipico food and just a few km further up the road the tourist can visit the women of El Cacao to watch them make traditional woven textiles. * Estadio Romualdo Bueso ‚Äì The main sports stadium in La Esperanza, Honduras. It is the home stadium of Atl√©tico Esperanzano soccer team and Lenca Rugby Club. The stadium holds 3,000 people. * Ballet Folkl√≥rico Oro Lenca ‚Äì During festivals and holidays, this dance troupe performs regional dances in traditional costumes of La Esperanza and surrounding communities. Headquartered in the Casa de Cultura of La Esperanza, the group also hosts a national folk dance festival in La Esperanza each October. ==Transportation== La Esperanza can be most easily reached by car or bus from Siguatepeque via Highway 22 which is paved and in good condition. From La Esperanza, one can take the road to Yamaranguila and connect with Highway CA 11-A to reach San Juan, Intibuc√°; Gracias, Lempira; and Santa Rosa de Cop√°n, Copan. Parts of the road between La Esperanza and San Juan are unpaved making them sometimes impassable during the rainy season, but the road is currently being paved. Transportes Carolina operates a fleet of Pullman buses which run hourly to/from Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula making stops at major cities along the way. There is also regular mini bus service to Marcala, Yamaranguila, San Juan, Erandique, Gracias and Santa Rosa de Copan all leaving from the main bus terminal near the entrance to town. Chicken buses run to smaller surrounding communities. The nearby village of San Juan is known for its coffee production. It is near Erandique, home to the ancient fortress of Lempira, an indigenous Honduran hero who fought against the Spanish. ==Notable people== *Berta Caceres (Lenca), founder of COPINH and environmental and human rights activist; assassinated in March 2016. *Nelson Gracias (Lenca), environmental activist, assassinated in March 2016. *Rafael Manzanares Aguilar, Honduran folklorist, author and musical composer; founder and first director of the National Office of Folklore of Honduras (Oficina del Folklore Nacional de Honduras); founder and first director and choreographer of the Cuadro Nacional de Danza Folkloricas de Honduras. *Vicente Mej√≠a Colindres, president of Honduras in 1919 and again from 1929 to 1933. Both the start and end of the second tenure was marked by until then nearly unprecedented peaceful transfers of power from incumbent to opposition party. == Notes  References  External links == *Ballet Folkl√≥rico Oro Lenca Website *La Esperanza and Intibuc√° Municipal Website *La Esperanza's Open Air Market *Union de Mujeres Microempresarias Lencas de Intibuc√° (UMMIL) Website *Welcome to la Esperanza Intibuca Honduras: Land of the Lencas and the White Mantle Category:Municipalities of the Intibuc√° Department Category:1848 establishments in the Spanish Empire ","title":"La Esperanza, Honduras"},{"id":"2226890","text":"Lieutenant General Frederick William \\"Fred\\" Kwasi Akuffo (21 March 1937 - 26 June 1979) was a soldier and politician. He was a Chief of Defence Staff of the Ghana Armed Forces and a Head of state and chairman of the ruling Supreme Military Council in Ghana from 1978 to 1979. He came to power in a military coup, was overthrown in another military coup and executed three weeks later, on 26 June 1979. ==Early life and education== Fred Akuffo was born at Akropong in the Eastern Region of Ghana. He completed his secondary education at the Presbyterian Boys' Secondary School in 1955 at Odumase krobo, Ghana. He then enlisted in the Ghana Army in 1957 and trained at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, UK among others, receiving his commission in 1960. He was married to Mrs. Emily Akuffo. He also attended the National Defence College in India in 1973. ==Career== While in the army, he served as commanding officer of the Airborne Training School at Tamale and later the 6th Battalion of Infantry of the Ghana army between 1969 and 1970.

Like the earlier com√©die en vaudeville and the later Singspiel, its distinguishing characteristic is the use of tunes in a popular style (either pre-existing or newly composed) with spoken dialogue. These English plays were 'operas' mainly insofar as they satirized the conventions of the imported opera seria. Music critic Peter Gammond describes the ballad opera as \\"an important step in the emancipation of both the musical stage and the popular song.\\" ==Earliest ballad operas== Ballad opera has been called an \\"eighteenth- century protest against the Italian conquest of the London operatic scene.\\"M. Lubbock, The Complete Book of Light Opera (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467‚Äì68 It consists of racy and often satirical spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short (mostly a single short stanza and refrain) to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story, which involves lower class, often criminal, characters, and typically shows a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period. It is generally accepted that the first ballad opera, and the one that was to prove the most successful, was The Beggar's Opera of 1728.J. Milling, P. Thomson, J. W. Donohue, eds, The Cambridge History of British Theatre: 1660 to 1895 / edited by Joseph Donohue (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 131. It had a libretto by John Gay and music arranged by Johann Christoph Pepusch, both of whom probably experienced vaudeville theatre in Paris, and may have been motivated to reproduce it in an English form. They were also probably influenced by the burlesques and musical plays of Thomas D'Urfey (1653‚Äì1723) who had a reputation for fitting new words to existing songs; a popular anthology of these settings was published in 1700 and frequently re-issued.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, \\"D'Urfey, Thomas\\". A number of the tunes from this anthology were recycled in The Beggar's Opera. After the success of The Beggar's Opera, many similar pieces were staged. The actor Thomas Walker, who played Macheath in the original production, wrote several ballad operas, and Gay produced further works in this style, including a much less successful sequel, Polly. Henry Fielding, Colley Cibber, Charles Coffey, Thomas Arne, Charles Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity. By the middle of the century, however, the genre was already in decline.J. Warwick and E. West, The Oxford Dictionary of Opera (Oxford: Oxford University Press), p. 43. Although they featured the lower reaches of society, the audiences for these works were typically the London bourgeois. As a reaction to serious opera (at this time almost invariably sung in Italian), the music, for these audiences, was as satirical in its way as the words of the play. The plays themselves contained references to contemporary politics‚Äîin The Beggar's Opera the character Peachum was a lampoon of Sir Robert Walpole. This satirical element meant that many of them risked censorship and banning‚Äîas was the case with Gay's successor to The Beggar's Opera, Polly. The tunes of the original ballad operas were almost all pre-existing (somewhat in the manner of a modern \\"jukebox musical\\"): however they were taken from a wide variety of contemporary sources, including folk melodies, popular airs by classical composers (such as Purcell) and even children's nursery rhymes. A significant source from which the music was drawn was the fund of popular airs to which 18th century London broadside ballads are set. It is from this connection that the term \\"ballad opera\\" is drawn. This ragbag of \\"pre-loved\\" music is a good test for distinguishing between the original type of ballad opera and its later forms. Many ballad operas used the same tunes, such as \\"Lillibullero\\", and by about 1750 it had become clear that there was a need for new tunes to be written. In 1762, Thomas Arne's Love in a Village presented a new form of ballad opera, with mainly new music and much less reliance on traditional tunes. It was followed in similar style by Charles Dibdin's Lionel and Clarissa in 1768. The Disappointment (1762) represents an early American attempt at such a ballad opera. ==Singspiel connection== In 1736 the Prussian ambassador in England commissioned an arrangement in German of a popular ballad opera, The Devil to Pay, by Charles Coffey. This was successfully performed in Hamburg, Leipzig and elsewhere in Germany in the 1740s. A new version was produced by C. F. Weisse and Johann Adam Hiller in 1766. The success of this version was the first of many by these collaborators, who have been called (according to Grove) \\"the fathers of the German Singspiel\\". (The storyline of The Devil to Pay was also adapted for Gluck for his 1759 French opera Le diable √† quatre). ==Pastoral ballad opera == A later development, also often referred to as ballad opera, was a more \\"pastoral\\" form. In subject matter, especially, these \\"ballad operas\\" were antithetical to the more satirical variety. In place of the rag-bag of pre-existing music found in (for example) The Beggar's Opera, the scores of these works consisted in the main of original music, although they not infrequently quoted folk melodies, or imitated them. Thomas Arne and Isaac Bickerstaffe's Love in a Village, and William Shield's Rosina (1781) are typical examples. Many of these works were introduced as after-pieces to performances of Italian operas. Later in the century broader comedies such as Richard Brinsley Sheridan's The Duenna and the innumerable works of Charles Dibdin moved the balance back towards the original style, but there was little remaining of the impetus of the satirical ballad opera. ==19th century== English 19th century opera is very heavily drawn from the \\"pastoral\\" form of the ballad opera, and traces even of the satiric kind can be found in the work of \\"serious\\" practitioners such as John Barnett. Much of the satiric spirit (albeit in a greatly refined form) of the original ballad opera can be found in Gilbert's contribution to the Savoy operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, and the more pastoral form of ballad opera is satirised in one of Gilbert and Sullivan's early works, The Sorcerer (1877). Balfe's opera The Bohemian Girl (1843) is one of the few British Ballad operas of the 20th century to gain international recognition.Grout, Donald Jay, Hermine Weigel Williams \\"National Traditions of Opera\\", A Short History of Opera, Columbia University Press (2013), p. 563 ==20th century== The Threepenny Opera of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht (1928) is a reworking of The Beggar's Opera, setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite. On the other hand, it uses just one tune from the original‚Äîall the other music being specially composed, and thus omits one of the most distinctive features of the original ballad opera. In a completely different vein, Hugh the Drover, an opera in two acts by Ralph Vaughan Williams first staged in 1924, is also sometimes referred to as a \\"ballad opera\\". It is plainly much closer to Shield's Rosina than to The Beggar's Opera. In the twentieth century folk singers have produced musical plays with folk or folk-like songs called \\"ballad operas\\". Alan Lomax, Pete Seeger, Burl Ives, and others recorded The Martins and the Coys in 1944, and Peter Bellamy and others recorded The Transports in 1977. The first of these is in some ways connected to the \\"pastoral\\" form of the ballad opera, and the latter to the satiric Beggar's Opera type, but in all they represent yet further reinterpretations of the term. Ironically, it is in the musicals of Kander and Ebb‚Äîespecially Chicago and Cabaret‚Äîthat the kind of satire embodied in The Beggar's Opera and its immediate successors is probably best preserved, although here, as in Weill's version, the music is specially composed, unlike the first ballad operas of the 18th century. ==NotesReferences== * Gay, John, Hal Gladfelder, and John Gay.

It also appears as Ister, equivalent to the Ancient Greek ·ººœÉœÑœÅŒøœÇ, which also meant the Danube or the region around its mouth. The Ancient Greek colony of Histria in today's Romania was named using this form of the river's name. The term may be related to the name of the region Istria in what is now northwestern Croatia, where a tribe called the Histri lived in ancient times. Some once thought that the local freshwater streams in Istria derived from a (non-existent) southward branch of the Danube. In modern English the term is most commonly encountered in its use by Nostradamus, especially in a phrase at quatrain II.24 commonly translated \\"most of the battle (or armies) will be against Hister\\": :Bestes farouches de faim fluves tranner: :Plus part du camp encontre Hister sera, :En caige de fer le grand fera treisner, :Quand Rin enfant Germain observera. :::[Nostradamus, Les Propheties, first printing 1555]See original text (second printing) here . or, in English: :Beasts wild with hunger shall cross the rivers: :Most of the fighting shall be close by the Hister [Danube], :It shall result in the great one being dragged in an iron cage, :While the Rhine child of Germany will observe. This is often interpreted to be a prediction of the war against Adolf Hitler's Nazi state in the twentieth century. However, none of the reputable sources listed support this view. In fact all of them point out that the name 'Hister' (as Nostradamus himself explains in his Almanac for 1554Chevignard, B.: Presages de Nostradamus, Seuil, 1999, p. 216) in fact refers in his writings to the Danube, being mentioned (as elsewhereSee IV.68) alongside 'R[h]in' (Rhine) ‚Äì two rivers that formed the north-eastern frontier of the ancient Roman Empire. Un bien s√ßavant homme dans ce dernier quart se pourmenant le long de la riviere Hister dite Danube, he writes at Prose Presage 222, la terre se parfondant, dans ladite riviere se perdra ('A very scholarly man during this last quarter, while walking along the river Hister known as Danube, the ground subsiding, in the said river shall be lost'). This is evidently based on a historical incident described by Nostradamus himself in his Trait√© des fardemens (Proem, p. 19, 1552), involving one Gaspar Ursinus Vellius consellier √† Vienne en Austriche, qui un soir soy pourmenant le long du Danube la terre se fendit, & tumba & se nya ('a councillor at Vienna in Austria who one evening was walking along the Danube, the ground split apart and he fell in and was drowned'). Nevertheless, it has also been acknowledged that Hitler referred to the Danube as \\"the river of the future\\"Hitler, pg. 43 and sought to use it to affirm control of \\"the heart of Europe.\\"Hitler, Adolf (2000).

The Brigade became operational on October 2, 1989, under the command of General Jean-Pierre Sengeisen. Currently, the FGB is stationed at M√ºllheim, Metz, Donaueschingen, Illkirch-Graffenstaden, Sarrebourg, and Immendingen as part of the Eurocorps. In February 2009 it was announced that a German battalion of the force was to be moved to Illkirch near Strasbourg, the first time a German unit had been stationed in France since the German occupation of World War II. On 31 October 2013, France announced that in 2014 it would shut down the 110th Infantry Regiment based in Donaueschingen and thus withdraw around 1000 men from Germany. This would leave the brigade with 4000 men, but would put an end to each country having a major presence in the other, France would be left with ~500 troops in Germany and vice versa.

In 1887, his family moved to Gedera. In 1888 Hankin married Olga Belkind (1852‚Äì1943) in Gedera. She was a woman twelve years his senior, who would become his partner in all his endeavors. Their marriage remained childless.http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/belkind-hankin-olgaHankin died in Tel Aviv and was buried in the Galilee next to his wife Olga, at the house (\\"Bet Hankin\\") he had built for themselves at Ein Harod on Mount Gilboa. ==Land purchases== While living in Gedera, Hankin became friendly with local Arabs, helping him negotiate the purchase of land. Hankin's first purchase was the land of Rehovot, acquired in 1890. A year later he bought the land that later became the settlement and city of Hadera. He then purchased territories for the Jewish Colonial Association in the Galilee. In 1908, when the Zionist organization sent Arthur Ruppin and set up the Palestine Land Development Company, Hankin joined. In 1909 or 1910, Hankin completed his first major purchase in the Jezreel Valley. He bought some 10,000 dunams (10 km¬≤) of land in Al-Fuleh, which became the home of Merhavia. This purchase also marked the start of bitter disputes between Arabs and Jews over the rights of tenant farmers who had been evicted, and regarding the employment of Jewish or Arab watchmen for the land. In his article, Buying the Emek, Arthur Ruppin described the vicissitudes of this purchase: :In order to execute this plan the Jaffa office communicated with Messrs. Kalvariski and Joshua Hankin. The latter, then a young man of twenty-five had already demonstrated his skill in such negotiations in the acquisition of land for the colonies Rehoboth and Hederah. By energetic work he succeeded, in 1891, in reaching an agreement with large owners in the Emek Jezreel and the Plain of Acco for the purchase of 160,000 dunams [160 km¬≤] at 15 francs per dunam [15,000 franc/km¬≤]....Before the consummation of the agreement, however the Turkish Government, alarmed by the increasing inflow of Russian Jews, prohibited Jewish immigration entirely. This blow proved disastrous for the negotiations. The Russian societies formed for the purposes of purchasing land were dissolved, failed to send in the money they had promised, and the entire magnificent project fell through...It was only in 1910 that Hankin -- who, in the meanwhile, had purchased land in Lower Galilee for the ICA -- resumed his negotiations for land in the Emek. Because of the reluctance of Zionist organizations to pay for land, Hankin frequently agreed to purchase lands and then convinced the Jewish agency or others to finance the \\"done deal.\\" As Ruppin notes: :Authorized by a Russian Jew, Elias Blumenfeld, to arrange for the purchase of 1,000 dunams [1 km¬≤] on which he, Blumenfeld, intended to establish a farm with his own means, Hankin concluded an agreement for a stretch of 9,500 dunams [9.5 km¬≤] in Fule, later Merchavia [Al-Ful in Arabic]. He hoped that the ICA, in whose employ he was at that time, would buy the remainder of the land. When, however, the ICA refused to do so, he inquired of me, who was then the director of the Palestine Bureau of the Zionist Organization, whether the Zionists would be prepared to purchase this land. Even before that it had occurred to me, whenever, going from Haifa to Nazareth, I had viewed the broad expanse of the Emek Yizrael, that, because of its proximity to Haifa, its excellent railroad and highway connections, and the ease with which its soil could be cultivated, this land would be preeminently suited for Jewish colonization. :But it was no simple matter to obtain the money for this purchase. Only the fact that Franz Oppenheimer was just then seeking land for the co-operative colonization society he had recently organized, and the simultaneous appearance of some private purchasers, made it possible to carry through this project. 3,500 dunams [3.5 km¬≤] were taken over by the National Fund for the co-operative colonies, and the rest by the Palestine Land Development Company. Yehoshua and Olga Hankin 1910 Yehoshua and Olga Hankin 1920 During World War I, Hankin was exiled by the Turks to Anatolia. Returning to Palestine, he soon resumed his work where he had left off. In 1920, he concluded a deal with the Sursuk family of Beirut for purchase of 60,000 dunams (60 km¬≤) of land in the Jezreel Valley. He negotiated for this land when he had in fact not a penny to finance the purchase. The chairman of the Jewish National Fund, Nehemiah De Lieme, refused to pay for the land, arguing that it was beyond the budget of the Fund, but he was overruled by the Zionist organization and in particular Chaim Weizmann. This tract became home to numerous new kibbutzim and other settlements, including Nahalal, Ginegar, Kfar Yehezkel, Geva, Ein Harod, Tel Yosef and Beit Alfa. Half of this land was unirrigated and considered of low value, but the remainder contained about 500 Arab tenant farmers. These latter, though reimbursed above and beyond the requirements of the law, continued to complain of dispossession. Subsequently, Hankin was involved in large scale purchases of land in and around Acco. In 1927, Hankin proposed an ambitious 20 year land purchase plan to the Jewish Agency for Israel, a plan that was never carried out in full. In 1932 he became head of the Palestine Land Development Corporation. Hankin understood the necessity to plan for Arab as well as Jewish settlement, and apparently intended to do so. In July 1930 he wrote: :...Had we desired to disregard the interests of such workers of the land as are dependent, directly or indirectly, upon lands of the landlords, we could have acquired large and unlimited areas, but in the course of our conversation I have pointed out to you that this has not been our policy and that, when acquiring lands, it is our ardent wish not to prejudice or do harm to the interests of anybody.

In early 2002, Res released the third single from How I Do, \\"They-Say Vision.\\" The song and accompanying video were breakthrough hits and reached #1 on the Billboard Dance chart and #37 on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart. With the chart success of the single, the album entered the Billboard 200 for the first time. A fourth single, \\"Sittin' Back,\\" was also released, but did not enjoy the same success as \\"They-Say Vision.\\" Meanwhile, in 2002, Res appeared on a track with Tony Allen, Ray Lema, Baaba Maal, Positive Black Soul and Archie Shepp for the Red Hot Organization's compilation album Red Hot and Riot, a tribute to Nigerian musician Fela Kuti. Res also performed a cover of Jefferson Starship song, \\"Miracles\\" for the Jennifer Lopez movie Maid in Manhattan. In 2003, her record label, MCA Records, was phased out by MCA Inc. and absorbed by Geffen Records.

In 2009, Res released her second album Black.Girls.Rock! through digital media available on iTunes. The album features tracks originally recorded for her shelved Geffen album. Black.Girls.Rock! is described by Res as \\"more of a singer/songwriters album than my debut. Great, classic songs!\\" Res funded a limited production run of vinyl pressings. On February 14, 2011, Res released a compilation of unreleased demos and remixed songs titled A Box of Chocolates after the Forrest Gump quote. The digital-only album is mixed by DJ NI** Sky (Nicole Albino of Nina Sky) and features a blend of music from multiple genres of music. The album was intended as a Valentine's Day gift to her fans as they awaited a proper release of Black.Girls.Rock!. In 2013, Res signed with Javotti Media/EOne Records and her long-awaited third studio album \\"Reset\\" was set to be released September 15, 2016.https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/reset-the-new-album-from-res-music As of June 2018, the album had not been released, but an Indigogo campaign to raise funds for the album had raised $39,000. ==Idle Warship== In 2009, Res joined long-time collaborator and emcee Talib Kweli to form a hip-hop/electro duo known as Idle Warship. They have released a few teaser tracks online including a song named \\"Steady\\" that borrows from '80s classic \\"Sunglasses At Night\\" by Corey Hart. In June 2009, Idle Warship completed their first headlining tour through Europe. They performed to sold-out crowds in Switzerland, Norway, France and Germany.

It was compiled by Capitol Records rather hastily after Brian Wilson had announced the shelving of Smile, the album he had spent the better part of a year toiling on. Released at a perilous moment in the Beach Boys' career, the appearance of their past glories on Best of The Beach Boys Vol. 2 perhaps helped confirm to the general public that the band was not up to the challenge of the new psychedelic music, spearheaded by albums such as The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Forever Changes by Love, Disraeli Gears by Cream, Surrealistic Pillow by Jefferson Airplane and The Jimi Hendrix Experience's radical debut Are You Experienced. \\"I Get Around\\", \\"California Girls\\", \\"Let Him Run Wild\\", and \\"Please Let Me Wonder\\" were considered old hat in the face of psychedelia and as a result Best of The Beach Boys Vol. 2 initially flopped in the US, only reaching #50. The fact that Smile had been shelved two months earlier meant the group had no new material to release in time for the Summer Of Love, although the music composed for that album was radical enough to have been part of it. Another commercial blunder came from their failure to appear at the Monterey International Pop Festival, which they had helped to organize and had been slated to headline as the closing act. In time the album would go on to sell over two million copies but the initial reaction must have given the Beach Boys cause for concern about their popularity and status in their homeland. However, a reworked track list issued under the same title in the UK in late 1967 proved to be another big success. Like its predecessor, Best of The Beach Boys Vol. 2 is out of print. ==Track listing== The Duophonic version of the album features true stereo mixes of \\"Long Tall Texan\\", \\"Don't Worry Baby\\" and \\"Little Saint Nick\\". \\"Please Let Me Wonder\\" and \\"Little Saint Nick\\" do not appear on the cassette tape version. Best of The Beach Boys Vol. 2 (Capitol (D) 2706) hit number 50 in the US during a 22-week tenure. In the UK, it reached number 3. == British version == The British version of Best of The Beach Boys Vol. 2 was released in mid-1967 with 14 songs, instead of the usual 12 found on American albums.

The monastery is one of the few places where one can see a piece of the Holy Cross. Stavrovouni Monastery was founded by Saint Helena (Saint Constantine's mother) in around 327‚Äì329 AD and therefore it is one of the oldest monasteries in the world. ==Location== The monastery is located on the peak of the mountain of the same name (Stavrovouni) in the District of Larnaca. The mountain in earlier times had been known under the name of Olympus, but nowadays the highest point of the Troodos Mountains further to the west bears that name. Stavrovouni, as the name already indicates, is dedicated to the Holy Cross; it can be derived from two words 'stavros' (Greek: Œ£œÑŒ±œÖœÅœåœÇ) for cross and 'vouno' (Œ≤ŒøœÖŒΩœå) for mountain, so that it basically means \\"the mountain of the Cross\\". ==Establishment== According to religious tradition, the monastery was founded by St. Helena, the mother of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine I, the Great. According to the 15th century Cypriot chronicler Leontios Makhairas, after the end of the First Ecumenical Synod in Nicaea (325), Helena went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land when she discovered the three crosses on which Jesus and the two thieves had been crucified. She had them excavated and wanted to bring them to Constantinople, but she is said to have left one of these crosses in Cyprus during an involuntary visit caused by shipwreck. Religious history says that the Holy Cross was transferred by a miracle to the peak of a high hill overnight and that a strong light was coming out of that peak. After several unsuccessful attempts to get the Holy Cross out of that mountain, Helena decided to leave a piece there, and built a small chapel to accompany it. Stavrovouni is therefore considered to be one of the oldest monasteries in the world; other ancient monasteries are: Saint Athanasius (344), Saint Anthony (356), Saint Macarius (360), Saint Gabriel (Mor Gabriel) (397), Saint Euthymius (460), Saint Sabbas (Mar Saba) (483) and Saint Catherine, Sinai (565). ==Relics== The most important relic of Stavrovouni Monastery: The Holy Cross The most significant relic that Stavrovouni Monastery possesses is a piece of the Holy Cross, left at the monastery by Saint Helena. There are references from several sources which report that the Holy Cross used to stand unsupported in the air. Nowadays, the remaining piece of the Cross is kept within a large silver cross. Other relics left at the monastery by Helena include the Cross of the Good Thief, a nail, and, according to some sayings, a part of the rope that had bound Jesus to the Cross. In addition, visitors will find two small chains which were worn by Saint Panaretos, Bishop of Paphos, during his life, and which were in direct contact with his body. ==History== Stavrovouni is the earliest documented monastery on the island. The oldest written reference dates from the Byzantine period, and it proves that Stavrovouni had been an important religious centre since the 4th century. The relevant information can be found in the memoirs of a Russian traveler, Abbot Daniel, who stayed on Cyprus in 1106. He recorded that the Holy Cross was located on Mount Olympus with the objective of \\"warding off evil spirits and curing any illness\\", and he noted, \\"This cross is like a meteorite, it is not supported in the ground, because the Holy Ghost holds it in the empty space. I, unworthy man, knelt down before this holy, mysterious object and have seen with my own, sinful eyes the inherent holy grace present in this place.\\" After its foundation, Stavrovouni was occupied by Orthodox monks living according to the rule of St. Basil. We obtain further historical information from Western visitors to Cyprus in the 13th century. Willibrandi de Oldenburg, for example, visited Stavrovouni in 1211 and wrote, \\"The cross of the Good Thief is on the highest mountain in Cyprus\\" ‚Äì which was incorrect, as Stavrovouni is not as high as the Troodos peak. Ludolph von Suchen noted in 1305, \\"The mountain is like the Mount Tabor on which the Benedictine monks live. From its peak one can see the Lebanon.\\" This is true, but the weather must be very clear in order to verify this. In its long history, Stavrovouni went through times of great poverty and hardship caused by the numerous invasions by foreigners on the island. Nowadays, the Holy Cross is no longer there and nobody knows what has happened to it. In 1598, the Bohemian nobleman Krystof Harant noted, \\"Nobody knows what the Turks have done with the Holy Cross.\\" The walls, the church, the iconostasis, and the monks' cells in Stavrovouni were almost completely destroyed during a great fire in 1888. The only relic which has been preserved down to the present is a silver cross in which a minute piece of the Holy Cross is inserted, the only major reliquary which is still kept in Stavrovouni. ===Recent history=== The records suggest that the monastery had no monks for a period roughly between the 16th and the 19th century, a time when the Turks ruled the island. The monastery was abandoned from 1571, however, some hermits continued to live there. This fact was mentioned by Russian monk and pilgrim, Vasil Grigorovich-Barsky in first half of 18th century. At the end of the 19th century, Elder Dionysios A' moved to Stavrovouni from Mount Athos in 1889, and the monastery was in operation again. In 1890, three more Cypriot monks, again from Mount Athos, joined him at Stavrovouni: Fathers Varnavas ‚Äì who would become the next Abbot ‚Äì and his two brothers Kallinikos and Gregorios. Following that, new monks entered the monastery, which grew larger and larger and soon became the spiritual center of the island of Cyprus. The monastery grew so much during the mid-20th century that it was in a position where it was able to send monks to other ruined monasteries to help their growth. For example, monks from Stavrovouni moved to the Monastery of Panagia Trooditissa in Troodos and created a new group. Other monks attempted to move to, and revive, the Monastery of Saint John the Baptist in Mesa Potamos in Limassol. ===Most recent Abbots=== Elder Dionysios A' served as the first Abbot until 1902, and then Elder Varnavas took over. The most recent Abbots are: * Elder Dionysios A' ‚Äì 1889‚Äì1902 * Elder Varnavas ‚Äì 1902‚Äì1948 * Elder Dionysios B' ‚Äì 1948‚Äì1952 * Elder Germanos ‚Äì 1952‚Äì1982 * Elder Athanasios ‚Äì 1982‚Äìpresent ===Known monks=== Stavrouvouni Monastery has been a center of spirituality and worship in Cyprus over the last century, as many spiritual monks made their homes there. Saint Filoumenos the Cypriot martyr, member of the Brotherhood of the Holy Sepulchre, is one such important monk who started his monastic life at Stavrovouni. On the 16/29 November 1979, he died violently as a martyr at Jacob's Well, where he served as Superior. His twin brother Archimandrite Elpidios started his monastic life at Stavrovouni, as well. The Hieromonk Kyprianos (‚Ä† 1955) is another significant figure who lived at Stavrovouni; he was known for his strict way of life and his helpful advice to the people of Cyprus. Archbishop Leontios of Cyprus (1896‚Äì1947) was staying at Stavrovouni for some period and was closely related with Hieromonk Kyprianos. ==Today== Recently, the monastery underwent a complete renovation. Its small church was restored again with frescoes and icons by the well-known painter, Fr. Kallinikos, a monk from Stavrovouni. The legend of the foundation is recorded in these pictures: St. Helena in a brilliant red garment and the Finding of the True Cross in Jerusalem. (As an aside, the emperor's mother recognised that she had the true Holy Cross by the miraculous healing of a woman.) Colourful, but also not without the skull painted beneath Christ's Cross for centuries is the Deposition. The majority of the frescoes in the church refer to the Cross and the life of St. Helena. In this manner, Stavrovouni is continuing the deeply rooted Byzantine painting tradition. ===Services=== Stavrovouni has a long tradition in icon painting and frescoes, and its most famous icon painter monk is Father Kallinikos.Father Kallinikos, icon painter Even the first Abbot Dionysios A' was an icon painter, and there are several pieces of work by monks from Stavrovouni in the island. Apart from icon painting, the monks work in a number of other services, such as agriculture and production of aromatics for the church. Moreover, locals visit the monastery, especially on feast days, and follow the monks in their worship programme ‚Äì in liturgy, vespers, etc. ===Metochia=== Metochia or Dependencies (Greek: ŒúŒµœÑœåœáŒπŒ±) are small monasteries or chapels that belong to a main monastery. Stavrovouni has a number of metochia, of which the most well-known is Agia Varvara at the foot of Stavrovouni hill. Until some decades ago, most of the monks used to stay at this metochi as there was no water and electricity at the top of the hill, and only two or three monks would stay at the top. Other metochia are Panagia Stazousa and Agios Modestos, which are located between the villages of Pyrga and Klavdia. Today, monks at Agia Varvara work as icon painters and in agriculture, whereas monks at the other two metochia concentrate more on prayers and live more closely to a hermitic life. At present, monks in Stavrovouni live a very strict form of monastic life, similar to that of the monks on Mount Athos. The rule of their first abbot, Dionysios I, forms the basis of this. Women are not allowed to enter the main part of the monastery, but they are allowed to visit the chapel out of it on the top of the hill. They are also allowed to visit the Metochi Agia Varvara at the foot of the hill only on Sundays. This rule is called avato (Greek: Œ¨Œ≤Œ±œÑŒø, meaning: entry is prohibited), and it is analogous to the strict life of monks in Mount Athos where women are not allowed to enter. This rule is applied in order to keep the monks isolated and living a stricter way of life. Today, there are over 30 monks in Stavrovouni Monastery, and the current Abbot is Archimandrite Athanasios. ==See also== * List of oldest church buildings ==References External links == * Cyprus Monasteries ‚Äì Stavrovouni Monastery * Stavrovouni Monastery * Œ£œÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøŒ≤ŒøœçŒΩŒπ * ŒôŒµœÅŒ¨ ŒúŒøŒΩŒÆ Œ£œÑŒ±œÖœÅŒøŒ≤ŒøœÖŒΩŒØŒøœÖ * Stavrovouni Monastery surrounding photos Category:Cypriot Orthodox monasteries Category:Mountains of Cyprus Category:Christian monasteries established in the 4th century Category:Greek Orthodox monasteries ","title":"Stavrovouni Monastery"},{"id":"2226953","text":"Richer Sounds store in Southampton A typical shop layout in 2009 Richer Sounds original logo, 1978-2006 Richer Sounds is a British home entertainment retailer that operates through a chain of 52 stores and through online, mainly in England.

The term SOWPODS is an anagram of the two abbreviations OSPD (Official Scrabble Players Dictionary) and OSW (Official Scrabble Words), these being the original two official dictionaries used in various parts of the world at the time. Although the two source dictionaries have now changed their respective titles, the term SOWPODS is still used by tournament players to refer to the combination of the two sources. There has not been any actual hard-copy list produced called SOWPODS, although the current Collins Scrabble Words, or CSW, is in effect the full SOWPODS list by a different name. Currently the two main sources for the words making up the combined list (generally known as Collins) are: * The British words. Derived from two sources; the Collins English Dictionary and the Collins Corpus, and * The American words. From the NASPA Word List, formerly Official Tournament and Club Word List, or TWL, derived from the Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and four other collegiate dictionaries. Latest version is NWL2018. ==History== In 1980 in the United Kingdom, the Chambers Dictionary replaced the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as the official choice for arbitration of the British National Scrabble Championship. In 1988 for the first time a single list of all the valid words, without the ambiguity of discussing conjugations, declensions and plurals was published under the title Official Scrabble Words from Chambers (this would come to be known as OSW). North American Scrabble was using the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary (OSPD), hence when the first World Scrabble Championship took place in 1991 words from either word source were allowed. Over the following years there was disagreement in the competitive Scrabble community over the desirability of a combined word source, which came to be known as SOWPODS as an easily pronounced anagram of OSW and OSPD. Australia changed all its rated tournaments to using the SOWPODS word list in 1994, while the UK made the same change in 2001. This latter move coincided with the publication of the first official book to contain all words from OSW and OSPD (Chambers' Official Scrabble Words: International Edition). In due course, Collins took over the publication of the official word list sanctioned by WESPA, and the current edition is CSW19. ==Word countSee also== * Tournament Word List ==References * www.collinsdictionary.com ‚Äì Collins Scrabble Word Finder Category:Scrabble lexica Category:English dictionaries ","title":"Collins Scrabble Words"},{"id":"2226961","text":"The Dreamcast is a home video game console by Sega, the first one introduced in the sixth generation of video game consoles. With the release of the Dreamcast in 1998 amid the dot-com bubble and mounting losses from the failure of its predecessor, the Sega Saturn, Sega made a major gamble in attempting to take advantage of the growing public interest in the Internet by including online capabilities in the console as a selling point. As such, the Dreamcast was the first console to include a built-in modem for Internet support and online play. Sega would end up leaning heavily into the online capabilities to sell the Dreamcast as hype grew for Sony's then-upcoming competitor, the PlayStation 2, which also promised online gaming in addition to its DVD capabilities. To create further incentive for use of the Dreamcast's online capabilities, Sega went beyond the scope of their prior online ventures and invested heavily in the development of unified online services for it, a concept that predated former partner Microsoft's Xbox Live service by a few years. Sega also predated Microsoft in pioneering the concept of downloadable content for games released on a console, though it was hampered by the small memory of the VMU. Despite the foresight Sega had in the emergence of broadband Internet access by making the modem modular and upgradeable with a broadband adapter, the services mainly supported dial-up Internet access throughout their lifetimes; only in Japan did broadband service arrive for the Dreamcast before Sega discontinued it in 2001, abandoning the console business altogether with its transition to third-party publishing. The services were gradually discontinued by Sega in the subsequent years; the last remaining service lingered on in Japan before it was shut down in 2007. In response, hobbyists have revived parts of the online services by creating private servers for a handful of games that had their official servers shut down. == Hardware == The 56K modem that was included with the Dreamcast. Sega produced two networking accessories for the Dreamcast worldwide, one for dial-up connections and one for broadband connections. A third accessory, also intended for broadband connections, was only available in Japan. All adapters are visually similar; however, the first accessory includes a telephone jack while the latter two accessories include an Ethernet jack instead. The adapters attach flush to an expansion port, named \\"Extension,\\" on the side of the Dreamcast. Sega also produced a keyboard and a computer mouse for easier navigation of the Internet on the Dreamcast. === Modem Adapter === The motherboard for the dial-up modem, which shows a Conexant chip. The Modem Adapter is a dial-up modem that was included with all Dreamcast consoles sold worldwide except for Brazil, where it was excluded due to the high price of the console there. As a result, the adapter was sold separately only in Brazil, where it was sold as the Dreamcast Link and retailed for R$49.99. European and early Japanese models came with a 33.6 kbit/s modem, while North American and most Japanese models included a 56 kbit/s modem. To produce the modem, Sega partnered with Rockwell International through its semiconductor division, which was spun off as Conexant on January 4, 1999. There are two models of the modem adapter, 670-14140A and 670-14140B. The \\"A\\" model can use power from the Dreamcast game console to allow it to operate without the need of power from the telephone line. The \\"B\\" model does not use power from the Dreamcast; thus, it is dependent on the power from the telephone line or a modem that runs power through the telephone line.  Custom dial-up server  There are multiple ways to create a server between a Dreamcast and a personal computer (PC) using the standard modem which allows the Dreamcast to share the PC's network connection. * PC-DC Server using Windows 95/98. * PC-DC Server using a Linux distribution like Ubuntu. * Dial-up Network by using a LAN modem (like a Netopia R2020) with a telephone line simulator. * PC-DC Server using Dreamcast Now software on a Raspberry Pi. === Broadband Adapter === The HIT-0400 broadband adapter. The Broadband Adapter is a network adapter that was released as a separate accessory for the Dreamcast in Japan on July 15, 2000, retailing at ¬•8,800; the United States followed suit on January 9, 2001, with a retail price of USD$59.95. The adapter was never bundled with any console, and in the United States, the adapter was only available in Sega's online store for a few months after its release; it appeared in retail stores starting in March of that year. Though it was never released in Europe, use of an American (or Japanese) adapter on a PAL system is possible since the adapter is not region coded. Only a few hundred thousand were produced as worldwide broadband adoption was still poor at the time. Due to the adapter's launch late in the lifespan of the Dreamcast, only a handful of games supported the adapter as developers had to explicitly include support for the adapter in their games; the games that did support it were able to take advantage of the 10 and 100 Mbit speeds provided by the adapter. However, it also had an unintended consequence of much faster Dreamcast GD-ROM copying, leading to a dramatic increase in game piracy towards the end of the console's North American lifespan. It is a common misconception that the Broadband Adapter was released with two model numbers (HIT-0400 for the US, and HIT-0401 for Japan); in actuality, both Japan and US models have the code HIT-0400 and use a Realtek 8139 chip. The code HIT-0401 refers to the Japanese model's packaging and documentation, while the code HIT-0400 refers to the adapter hardware. Besides the Broadband Adapter, Sega also released the LAN Adapter in 1999 for sale in Japan only. It is inferior compared to the Broadband Adapter as it supports only the low 10 Mbit speed with the use of a Fujitsu MB86967 chip. The LAN Adapter was also not compatible with any online Dreamcast games and worked only with the included Japanese browser disk. Due to the decline of dial-up networking and the rise of the more modernized, faster LAN connection, the Broadband Adapter has reached very high demand over the pre-packaged Modem Adapter. Combined with the scarcity of the adapter, this has resulted in highly inflated prices for it; as early as 2004, retailers such as eBay sold the adapter alone for around $100 to $150, and it still regularly sells for more than the Dreamcast itself. Some games are still playable online via the Broadband Adapter through private servers, such as Phantasy Star Online, Toy Racer, and Quake III Arena. == Online services  Dricas (Japan) === Dricas was an Internet service intended for Dreamcast consoles in Japan. The service launched the week of April 28, 1998, with only a few features such as e-mail available; the feature set expanded in the months preceding the Dreamcast's launch in Japan on November 27, 1998. Much of its infrastructure was developed by ISAO Corporation, which was spun-off from Sega on November 26, 1999. Its accompanying web browser, DreamPassport, added the ability to send images and videos through e-mail and video chat via the Dreameye accessory, which was only sold in Japan. Dricas persisted until March 7, 2000, when the service was consolidated into ISAO's multi-platform online service, isao.net. Broadband support arrived for the service a few months later on July 15 of that year, launching with the debut of the Broadband Adapter in Japan. Isao.net maintained online services and game servers for the Dreamcast until Sega ceased the online servers for the last remaining Dreamcast game, Phantasy Star Online, along with its GameCube port on March 31, 2007. Sega ultimately terminated the Dreamcast-dedicated portion of the isao.net service on September 28, 2007, eliminating the last remaining vestige of Sega's ambitious plan for online gaming with the Dreamcast close to ten years after the initial launch of Dricas. === SegaNet (United States) === SegaNet was a short-lived Internet service geared for dial-up-based online gaming on the Dreamcast game console in the United States. The service was created by Sega in collaboration with GTE through its GTE Internetworking division, which was spun-off from GTE and renamed Genuity in the midst of development as GTE merged with Bell Atlantic to form Verizon Communications on June 30, 2000. As such, it was Genuity that ended up providing the dial-up service and network infrastructure. Microsoft also participated with Sega in the development of the service until they terminated their relationship just a few months before its launch over differences in its direction. As a replacement for Sega's original PC-only online gaming service, Heat.net, SegaNet was initially quite popular when it launched on September 7, 2000. Just over a month after launch, by October 27, 2000, SegaNet had 1.55 million Dreamcast consoles registered online, including 750,000 in Japan, 400,000 in North America, and 400,000 in Europe. This was somewhat surprising given that Sega initially set a monthly subscription fee of USD$21.95, relatively expensive compared to other Internet service providers (ISPs) of the time. However, it was unavailable outside of the contiguous United States; support for Canada, Alaska, and Hawaii was planned, but never realized. Unlike a standard ISP, game servers would be connected directly into SegaNet's internal network, providing very low connection latency between the consoles and servers along with standard Internet access via the included PlanetWeb browser. SegaNet originally offered a rebate for a free Dreamcast with a two-year contract along with a free keyboard to encourage sales of the console. However, with pressure mounting from Sony's PlayStation 2 and the announcements of Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo's GameCube, sales of the Dreamcast continued to drop and, on July 20, 2001, Sega announced they would discontinue the service just less than 11 months after launch. At this point, all subscribers were given the option to transfer their accounts to EarthLink. Sega continued to operate the online game servers, initially removing the subscription fee for accessing them before reinstating it, albeit reduced to $9.95 per month, on November 1 of that year. They permanently eliminated the required subscription at the beginning of August 2002 with the intention of shutting down the servers by the end of that year;\\" however, they decided to extend the service by six months, officially ending online support for most Dreamcast games effective June 2003. Sega continued to provide online support for Phantasy Star Online and Phantasy Star Online Ver. 2 until September 30, 2003; the online servers for both games were shut down at that point, officially ceasing online gaming on the Dreamcast in the United States. === Dreamarena (Europe) === Dreamarena was a free dial-up-based online gaming service provided for all Dreamcast consoles in Europe, launching with the debut of the Dreamcast in Europe on October 14, 1999. The service was created and operated for Sega Europe by a partnership between ICL, BT and various ISPs; ICL developed the web sites and software, with BT providing the dial-up capabilities and network infrastructure, and the ISPs (one for each country) providing the Internet dial-up connection and telephone service. The service was free, and the game servers hosted within it could not otherwise be accessed from the Internet. Some games released in Europe after the Dreamcast was discontinued did not include the online functionality present in other regions, infuriating some consumers who anticipated using the online features. Dreamarena went through two revisions, with the final one coinciding with DreamKey 3.0. Dreamarena was discontinued in March 2002, but online functions for the Dreamcast continued to run until the beginning of March 2003. Although people could change their ISP settings thanks to American online games like Quake III Arena, European Dreamcast web browsers DreamKey 1.0 and 1.5 didn't allow users to input their own ISP settings. After the end of Dreamarena, Sega offered to send DreamKey 3.0/3.1 free from Sega-Europe's website, allowing users to replace the Dreamarena ISP settings with their own ISP settings, to continue to browse the web and to play online games until the discontinuation of online services. == Supported games == Despite the emphasis of online gaming by Sega, no games supported online play at launch despite a handful of games offering free downloadable content (DLC) to store on a VMU, including Sonic Adventure. This caused much ire among consumers such that complaints were filed to the BBC's Watchdog programme and the Independent Television Commission (ITC) in the United Kingdom, accusing Sega of misleading advertising. The ITC subsequently forced Sega to remove references to online gaming in Dreamcast advertisements, with Sega deciding to switch European advertising agencies from WCRS to Bartle Bogle Hegarty as a result of the controversy. The first game to support online play was ChuChu Rocket!, which first released in Japan on November 11, 1999. Online games on the Dreamcast initially allowed free access to their game servers with expectations of cost offsetting through SegaNet subscriptions and game sales. Phantasy Star Online Ver. 2 was one of the exceptions to the free access, charging a monthly fee throughout the existence of its official servers. There are some private servers still online that are playable with the following games: Phantasy Star Online Ver. 1 and Phantasy Star Online Ver. 2, Sega Swirl, 4x4 Evolution, Quake III Arena, Maximum Pool, Planet Ring, Toy Racer, Starlancer, ChuChu Rocket!, The Next Tetris On-line Edition, PBA Tour Bowling 2001, Sonic Adventure, Alien Front Online, Worms World Party, Racing Simulation 2 On-line: Monaco Grand Prix, POD: Speedzone, Ooga Booga, World Series Baseball 2K2, Jet Set Radio, NCAA College Football 2K2: Road to the Rose Bowl, NFL 2K1, NFL 2K2, NBA 2K1, and NBA 2K2, with more games upcoming. == Notes == : a.The Apple Bandai Pippin, released in 1996, included a 14.4 kbit/s modem; however, it was external and plugged in via a nine-pin mini-DIN connector. == See also  Competing online services === * GameCube online functionality * PlayStation 2 online functionality * Xbox Live === Prior online ventures by Sega === * Sega Meganet for the Mega Drive (Japan, Brazil) * Sega Channel for the Genesis (United States) * Sega NetLink for the Saturn == References == Category:Products and services discontinued in 2007 Category:Dreamcast Category:Internet service providers Category:Online video game services Category:Sega hardware ","title":"Dreamcast online functionality"},{"id":"2226975","text":"National Comics Publications, Inc.

The city has a population of 200,000, according to the 2012 census, while the population of the department is more than 604,900. Matagalpa is Nicaragua's fourth largest city, the largest in the country's interior, and one of the most commercially active outside of Managua. Matagalpa is the 4th most important city in Nicaragua and is known as the \\"Pearl of the North\\" and \\"Land of Eternal Spring.\\" ==Origin of the name== A waterfall in the Apante area of Matagalpa. According to Jeronimo Perez, a historian who visited this area in 1855‚Äì1856 the name Matagalpa means Cabeza Principal (Main Head) or Pueblo Grande (Big Town) from the Matagalpa indigenous language words: Maika=Head, Calpul* Town- But according to the Matagalpan linguist father Guillermo Kiene, a Catholic priest and missionary who lived from 1898 to 1959, the word Matagalpa comes from the Sumo language, and means \\"let's go where the rocks are.\\" There have been other descriptions of the word Matagalpa: -Here next to the water, and -Among Mountains ( \\"Aqu√≠ junto al agua\\" y \\"Entre Monta√±as\\"). These descriptions are believed to be related to the geographic location of the city, which is next to the Grand River of Matagalpa, and also surrounded by mountains. ==Precolonial history== Matagalpa was originally an indigenous village. The Cacaopera people, or Matagalpa had their own language, which has been extinct since 1875. A document from the year 1855 with 97 words and phrases from the Matagalpa language can be found in the Daniel G. Brinton section of the American Philosophical Library in Philadelphia. The Matagalpa made ceramics of a style known as \\"Ceramica Negra\\" and \\"Naranja Segovia\\", they also built stone statues representing their chieftain and warriors. They were feared by the Spanish because they were very brave and effective with their bows and other arms. It took 300 years for the Spanish to submit them, even at the time of Nicaragua Independence in 1821, there were many Cacaopera free in the central mountains of Nicaragua. In 1856 they were decisive to defeat William Walker's filibusters in the Battle of San Jacinto on 14 September 1856, where a column of 60 Cacaopera people with bow and arrows fought at the side of Nicaraguan Patriots winning that battle, which marked the end of Walker adventure in Nicaragua. That quest has been recognized by historians and archaeologists, and there is a popular movement to declare the Cacaopera as National Heroes by the Congress of the Republic next month of September 2011. ==Post-colonial history== View of downtown from one of the surrounding hills Street in Matagalpa, April 1988. The National Police of Nicaragua operates the Matagalpa District Station. Matagalpa was an existing indigenous town when the first Spaniards came to this region by 1528 during an attempt to find a water passage to the \\"Northern Sea\\", the Caribbean. (Nicaragua's Spanish colonization originated from the direction of the Pacific Ocean, which was called the Southern Sea by the Spaniards. Matagalpa is located in the continental divide between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Many stories are preserved from colonial times about the British-controlled Mosquito Coast, and the Spanish-colonized Pacific area. Gold was discovered around Matagalpa by 1840. Along with many Spaniards and Mestizos, it attracted German, American and British immigrants. Two of the better known immigrants of this period were Ludwig Elster (from Hannover) and his wife Katharina Braun (from Schwarzwald, Germany Black Forest) who planted the first coffee trees in the area, the beans from which quickly went to market in Germany. Coffee agriculture attracted more than 120 European immigrants, many of whom married Matagalpan women, and many of their descendants still live in the area. In 1923 some Danish immigrants also came to Matagalpa, and settled in the highlands as well. Most of the Danish families went back to Denmark. Three families stayed: the Gr√∂ns, the M√∂llers, and the Petersens. Matagalpa was also the city of refuge for many Nicaraguans escaping the invasion of Tennessean filibuster William Walker who took over much of the country and government in 1856. In Matagalpa the patriots organized the Ej√©rcito del Septentri√≥n (\\"Army of the North\\"), which fought in and won the Battle of San Jacinto, assisted by 60 Matagalpa, on 14 September 1856, helping to end Walker's rule. Visitor at Selva Negra Mountain Resort. Matagalpa was also the birthplace of Nazario Vega, Governor and builder of the Cathedral; Bartolom√© Mart√≠nez, President of Nicaragua, 1923‚Äì24; and Carlos Fonseca Amador, founder of the Sandinista Front in 1961. Currently the department of Matagalpa is the second most populous in Nicaragua after the national capital (Managua), and the most diversified in production. Over the past few years Matagalpa has experienced a large influx of migrants (mainly peasants) from other departments, causing stress on infrastructure and the environment. Matagalpa has a panoramic highway that starts in the city of Matagalpa and extends to the city of Jinotega. Scenic views extend up to away, to the volcanic range near the Pacific coast. Many historians, archeologists, botanists and ethnologists have arrived in recent years to do research in this region. American and European descendants of the first settlers are also returning to visit the historical homes of their ancestors. ==Economy== Cocoa is one of the main Productions of Matagalpa. Matagalpa produces and exports beef, cheese, coffee, cacao, onions, tomatoes and mixed fruits and vegetables. For local consumption it produces flowers, wood, corn, beans, fruits (oranges, grapefruits, bananas, plantains) and many kinds of vegetables such as broccoli, and cauliflower. Matagalpa is known for its coffee, its cattle, milk products, vegetables, flowers and mountains popular with ecotourists. It is the location of such storied mountain tourist resorts as Aranjuez, Santa Maria de Ostuma, and Selva Negra Mountain Resort. A large part of the economy in Matagalpa depends on eco-tourism. Nature hikes, walks, and excursions are very common throughout Matagalpa, and the northern region on Nicaragua. One of the most recognized eco-tourism sites is Selva Negra Wildlife Refuge, with over of land dedicated to the conservation of the area's diverse flora and fauna. ==Climate== Matagalpa, along with nearby Jinotega, enjoy \\"eternal spring\\" or all year, spring-like weather. Matagalpa lies more than above sea level with the average temperature ranging from ., and relative humidity between 75% to 85%.

The UK version was written by English satirist Tony Hendra, who was also the voice director. ==Plot== In 1995, World War III begins by accident when a hitman uses an miniature nuclear weapon in a hit which destroys Sicily; Italy mistakes the blast for nuclear terrorism and annihilates Libya, which destroys Israel. Africa bombs Germany, which in turn attacks France. Luxembourg bombs England. Sweden destroys itself. The Russians decide to liquidate the Americans, who in turn unleash their nuclear fleet, leaving only two continents on the verge of World War IV. In the north, America and Russia merge, containing a mutated strain of males, forming the USSSR. In the south, all that is left of womankind retreat to their territory of Vaginia. The armies of these two nations are soon at odds with each other as they perfect their most destructive weapons capable of destroying the universe. The Council of the Universe, fearing for everyone's safety, appoints Fred Hero, a retired superhero now working as a garbageman to diplomatically calm the situation down. He is given a powerful light bulb that makes him invincible. Fred firsts starts off with the USSSR and tries to persuade the nation's leader, the Comrade-In-Chief, to get rid of all of the bombs. The Comrade-In-Chief sees Fred as a lunatic and whispers to his three minions to fetch the guards. While he's waiting, The Comrade-In-Chief explains to Fred that all of the men lost their asses during World War III. The women were safe underground. When the war was over, and the women came back up and saw the men without their asses, they just laughed. The Comrade-In-Chief plans to destroy Vaginia with their weapon \\"The Big One\\" - a missile shaped like a penis. After the history lesson, Fred accidentally meets and promptly falls in love with the nation's female mascot, Liberty. Fred escapes the Comrade's lair with Liberty. When they're finally alone, Fred wishes to marry Liberty, but Liberty finds out that Fred's married. Liberty is shocked and decides to return to the Comrade. Fred then flies over to Vagina and meets the multi- breasted leader Una. Una reveals the Vaginia has a super-weapon called \\"Big Mama\\" - a spherical missile that has a vagina and nipple on it that is designed to combine with \\"The Big One\\" and thus destroy the universe. Fred once again tries to get Una to make peace with the USSSR, but this time, Una agrees, but only if he and her have sex. Fred is unable to withstand her advances, and unable to please her complex body. With no hope for peace and mad with rage at the idea of being separated from Liberty, Fred inadvertently starts the Fourth World War. While the two nations fight, Fred eventually decides to try to win Liberty's heart back and save the universe. Liberty is taken on board \\"The Big One\\", which starts to rise as Fred hurries to her rescue. He manages to get on board and escape with her to the safety of a tropical island only for them to be caught up in the final battle between both nations armies. As the two missiles circle above the sky, this gets the two nations extremely horny for each other. While the two nations have an orgy on the island, Fred tries to get back with Liberty, who still declines Fred's offer, due to Fred still being married. Just then, Fred gets a message from his wife, who says that she's seeing another man, Conan, Fred's Conan the Barbarian-like coworker. Fred and Liberty run toward each other with open arms. As they hug, \\"The Big One\\" penetrates \\"Big Mama\\" and both explode in a cosmic orgasm which causes the entire universe to be destroyed. God, who is having sex with his wife notices this but doesn't care. Fred and Liberty arrive in Heaven, and they both have sex in a lone cloud, beginning their new life together. ==Production== After Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle and The Missing Link, The Big Bang is the third feature by Picha, which includes Picha's typical humor and his love of provocation and nonsense. Picha claims that the film is \\"the culmination of a trilogy, a mixture of these concerns in the other two films ... a little more tied to the news of the day, only more excessive. The Big Bang is a film about the all wars, including personal wars you find in the family.\\" Production lasted from 1984 to 1986. When the film was released in the UK, the British Board of Film Censors cut the film by 10 seconds to remove a sequence in which an animated version of God appeared to be having sex and then uttered an expletive. After the release of the film, Picha put his theatrical work on hold, choosing to produce television cartoons instead. ==Release== The film was released on DVD on 7 February 2011 in the United Kingdom by Lace DVD.

SR 542 travels east as the Mount Baker Highway from an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5) in Bellingham through the Nooksack River valley to the Mt. Baker Ski Area at Austin Pass. It serves as the main highway to Mount Baker and the communities of Deming, Kendall, and Maple Falls along the Nooksack River. The highway was constructed in 1893 by Whatcom County as a wagon road between Bellingham and Maple Falls and was added to the state highway system as a branch of State Road 1 in 1925. The branch was transferred to Primary State Highway 1 (PSH 1) during its creation in 1937 and became SR 542 during the 1964 highway renumbering. ==Route description== SR 542 begins as Sunset Drive and the Mount Baker Highway at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-5 to the northeast of downtown Bellingham. The highway travels northeast through suburban neighborhoods along Squalicum Creek and passes Squalicum High School as it leaves the city of Bellingham. SR 542 continues northeast through rural Whatcom County, crossing the Nooksack River and intersecting SR 9 at a roundabout. The concurrent SR 9 and SR 542 travel southeast through the community of Deming along a BNSF rail line and passes Mount Baker Senior High School. SR 542 leaves SR 9 east of Deming and turns north along the North Fork of the Nooksack River and the eastern slope of Sumas Mountain to Kendall, where it serves as the southern terminus of SR 547. The Mount Baker Highway turns east and continues along the Nooksack River North Fork into the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest at Glacier in the foothills of Mount Baker. SR 542 turns south and serves the Mt. Baker Ski Area on the northeast side of the mountain before splitting into a one-way pair around Picture Lake. The Mount Baker Highway continues through Austin Pass and ends at Artist Point, located at above sea level on Kulshan Ridge. Table Mountain reflected in roadside pond near Austin Pass Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 542 was the I-5 interchange in Bellingham, serving 38,000 vehicles, while the least busy section of SR 542 was the one- way pair around Picture Lake in Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, serving 230 vehicles. The Mount Baker Highway is designated as a National Forest Scenic Byway and serves as the eastern section of the Ski to Sea Race between Mount Baker and Maple Falls, a Memorial Day race with seven legs hosting seven events. The eastern terminus of SR 542, at Artist Point on Kulshan Ridge, is closed annually by WSDOT between October and July due to extreme weather conditions. ==History== The Mount Baker Highway was constructed by Whatcom County in 1893 as a wagon road traveling northeast from Bellingham along the Nooksack River through Deming and Kendall to Maple Falls. The wagon road was extended from Maple Falls through Glacier to the Mt. Baker Ski Area at Heather Meadows began 1921 and ended in 1926.Heller, p. 7. The Mount Baker Highway was added to the state highway system in 1925 as the Austin Pass branch of State Road 1 and was extended to its current terminus at Artist Point in 1931.Heller, p. 31. The highway was closed seasonally between Glacier and Artist Point until the filming of The Call of the Wild in 1934 and 1935 prompted interest in the Mount Baker area. The Department of Highways began clearing the highway of snow during the winter of 1934 for the film and continued annually between Glacier and Heather Meadows;Heller, p. 34. however, the highway was not cleared during World War II due to gasoline shortages.

Casual wear became popular in the Western world following the counterculture of the 1960s. When emphasising casual wear's comfort, it may be referred to as leisurewear. While casual is \\"informal\\" in the sense of \\"not formal\\", informal attire traditionally refers to a Western dress code associated with suits - a step below semi-formal attire - thus being more formal than casual attire. ==Overview== With the popularity of spectator sports in the late 20th century, a good deal of athletic gear has influenced casual wear, such as jogging suits, running shoes, and track clothing. Work wear worn for manual labor also falls into casual wear. Basic materials used for casual wear include denim, cotton, jersey, flannel, and fleece. Materials such as velvet, chiffon, and brocade are often associated with more formal clothes. While utilitarian costume comes to mind first for casual dress, however, there is also a wide range of flamboyance and theatricality. Punk fashion and fashion of the 1970s and 1980s is a striking example. Madonna introduced a great deal of lace, jewelry, and cosmetics into casual wear during the 1980s. In the 1990s, hip hop fashion played up elaborate jewelry and luxurious materials worn in conjunction with athletic gear and the clothing of manual labor. ==Men== Jeans, dress shirt (casually turn down collared), and a T-shirt or sleeveless shirt are typically considered casual wear for men in modern times. ==Women== Casual wear is typically the dress code in which forms of gender expression are experimented with. An obvious example is masculine jewelry, which was once considered shocking or titillating even in casual circles, and is now hardly noteworthy in semi-formal situations. Amelia Bloomer introduced trousers of a sort for women as a casual alternative to formal hoops and skirts. The trend toward female exposure in the 20th century tended to push the necklines of formal ball gowns lower and the skirts of cocktail dresses higher. For men, the exposure of shoulders, thighs, and backs is still limited to casual wear. ==Gallery== File:Cycling woman wearing miniskirt.jpgWoman cycling while wearing sweater and miniskirt in Canada.

It is the capital of the department of Alto Paraguay. Straddling the river Paraguay which forms the border with Brazil, Fuerte Olimpo is Paraguay's northernmost departmental capital, located over 830 km (515 mi) north of the capital Asunci√≥n. It was originally called Fuerte Borb√≥n. The city is also known as ‚Äúla puerta de entrada al Pantanal‚Äù, or entrance to the Pantanal region. Fuerte Olimpo is on east of Chaco Boreal on east shore of Paraguay River near the mouth of Blanco River, to the north the moist ground called humedales from the Gran Pantanal. Fuerte Olimpo is far away from the flood area. The city is surrounded by a wall 4 km long. ==Geography== This plain is almost 300 metres above the sea level. The soil is good for farming and cattle raising. Laguna Capit√°n is a lagoon in Fuerte Olimpo. Fuerte Olimpo is between two hills, in one is Fuerte Bord√≥n and in the other one is Maria Auxiliadora Cathedral. The hill 3 hermanos are elevations of the region, on top of the middle cerro palms of karanday can be seen and also the moist ground of the Pantanal Nabileque and Sierra de Bord√≥n in Brazil. == Weather == The weather is tropical, temperature is around in summer, and the minimum in winter. The average is . Long droughts followed by strong rains are important characteristics of the region. ==Demography== Fuerte Olimpo is a city with 4998 inhabitants, 2585 men and 2413 women, according to the Census. ==History== The city was founded by Spain in 1792 named Fuerte Borb√≥n by the Governor Joaqu√≠n Alos y Bru, who sent the Commandant Jos√© Antonio de Zavala y Delgadillo, to protect the area from the Virreinato del R√≠o de la Plata from the bandeirantes from Brazil. The first settlement was between the Brazilian Forte Porto Carrero and Fecho dos Morros. Caciques Mbayaes were invited for the foundation. During Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia government it was called Fuerte Olimpo, maybe because of the main Cerro (hill) which was said to resemble Mount Olimpus in ancient Greece. At that time Paraguayan sovereignty established a free port for Brazilian trading. At the beginning of Paraguayan War (1865‚Äì1870) it was a very important offensive spot in the Mato Grosso, in 1866 Fuerte Olimpo was a strategic place too but it was taken by Brazilians when the campaign ended. Originally, Argentina wanted to own from Fuerte Olimpo to Chaco Boreal to the Bah√≠a Negra, but when Brazil left Paraguay, Argentina did not claim it. After the 1870s the area belonged to large landowners who chopped the quebrechales having native people work as slaves, that period was called tannin cycle, it was the beginning of some industries, forests were destroyed and the place was used for cattle raising good for the kind of weather. Another important aspect was the industries of tiles, palm and bricks. So Fuerte Olimpo became a port for exportation. During the Chaco war in the 1930s Fuerte Olimpo was again an important place for offensive strategies. ==Economy== It includes some ports: 14 de Mayo, Esperanza, Leda, Lida, and Maria Elena. The main activity is cattle raising. ==Transportation== Boats and canoes are the main important means of transportation to get to Fuerte Olimpo. People travel in the riverboat Aquidab√°n, which goes from Concepci√≥n to Bah√≠a Negra. Another way to go there is going Route 9 ‚ÄúThe Transchaco highway‚Äù to ‚ÄúCruce Pioneros‚Äù, at km. 409, there is no paved route to get to Fuerte Olimpo.

It was published in 1956 and translated into English by Ivan Morris in 1959. The novel is loosely based on the burning of the Reliquary (or Golden Pavilion) of Kinkaku-ji in Kyoto by a young Buddhist acolyte in 1950. The pavilion, dating from before 1400, was a national monument that had been spared destruction many times throughout history, and the arson shocked Japan. ==PlotChildhood=== The protagonist, Mizoguchi, is the son of a consumptive Buddhist priest who lives and works on the remote Cape Nariu on the north coast of Honsh≈´. As a child, the narrator lives with his uncle at the village of Shiraku (Â∏´Ê•Ω), near Maizuru. Throughout his childhood he is assured by his father that the Golden Pavilion is the most beautiful building in the world, and the idea of the temple becomes a fixture in his imagination. A stammering boy from a poor household, he is friendless at his school, and takes refuge in vengeful fantasies. When a naval cadet who is visiting the school makes fun of him, he vandalises the cadet's belongings behind his back. A neighbour's girl, Uiko, becomes the target of his hatred, and when she is killed by her deserter boyfriend after she betrays him, Mizoguchi becomes convinced that his curse on her has been fulfilled. His ill father takes him to the Kinkaku-ji for the first time in the spring of 1944, and introduces him to the Superior, Tayama Dosen. After his father's death, Mizoguchi becomes an acolyte at the temple. It is the height of the war, and there are only three acolytes, but one is his first real friend, the candid and pleasant Tsurukawa. During the 1944‚Äì5 school year, he boards at the Rinzai Academy's middle school and works at a factory, fascinated by the idea that the Golden Pavilion will inevitably be burnt to ashes in the firebombing. But the American planes avoid Kyoto, and his dream of a glorious tragedy is defeated. In May 1945, he and Tsurukawa visit Nanzen- ji. From the tower, they witness a strange scene in a room of the Tenju-an nearby: a woman in a formal kimono gives her lover a cup of tea to which she adds her own breast milk. After his father dies of consumption, he is sent to Kinkaku-ji. On the first anniversary of his father's death, his mother visits him, bringing the mortuary tablet so that the Superior can say Mass over it. She tells him that she has moved from Nariu to Kasagun, and reveals her wish that he should succeed Father Dosen as Superior at Rokuon-ji. The two ambitions‚Äîthat the temple be destroyed, or that it should be his to control‚Äîleave him confused and ambivalent. On hearing the news of the end of the war and the Emperor's renunciation of divinity, Father Dosen calls his acolytes and tells them the fourteenth Zen story from The Gateless Gate, \\"Nansen kills a kitten\\", which leaves them bemused. Mizoguchi is bitterly disappointed by the end of hostilities, and late at night he climbs the hill behind the temple, Okitayama-Fudosan, looks down on the lights of Kyoto, and pronounces a curse: \\"Let the darkness of my heart [...] equal the darkness of the night which encloses those countless lights!\\" ===Friendship with Kashiwagi=== During the winter of that year, the Temple is visited by a drunk American soldier and his pregnant Japanese girlfriend. He pushes his girlfriend down into the snow, and orders Mizoguchi to trample her stomach, giving him two cartons of cigarettes in exchange for doing so. Mizoguchi goes indoors and obsequiously presents the cartons to the Superior, who is having his head shaved by the deacon. Father Dosen thanks him, and tells him he has been chosen for the scholarship to Otani University. A week later the girl visits the temple, tells her story, and demands compensation for the miscarriage she has suffered. The Superior gives her money and says nothing to the acolytes, but rumours of her claims spread, and the people at the temple become uneasy about Mizoguchi. Throughout 1946 he is tormented by the urge to confess, but never does so, and in the spring of 1947 he leaves with Tsurukawa for Otani University. He starts to drift away from Tsurukawa, befriending Kashiwagi, a cynical clubfooted boy from Sannomiya who indulges in long \\"philosophical\\" speeches. Kashiwagi boasts of his ability to seduce women by making them feel sorry for him‚Äîin his words, they \\"fall in love with my clubfeet.\\" He demonstrates his method to Mizoguchi by feigning a tumble in front of a girl. She helps him into her house. Mizoguchi is so disturbed that he runs away, and takes a train to the Kinkaku-ji to recover his self- assurance. In May, Kashiwagi invites him to a \\"picnic\\" at Kameyama Park, taking the girl he tricked, and another girl for Mizoguchi. When left alone with the girl, she tells him a story about a woman she knows who lost her lover during the war. He realises that the woman she is talking about must be the same one he saw two years before through a window of Tenju Hermitage. Mizoguchi's mind fills with visions of the Golden Pavilion, and he finds himself impotent. That evening a telegram arrives at the university bearing news of kindly Tsurukawa's death in a road accident. For nearly a year, Mizoguchi avoids Kashiwagi's company. In the spring of 1948 Kashiwagi comes to visit him at the temple, and gives him a shakuhachi as a present. He takes the opportunity to demonstrate his own skill as a player. In May he asks Mizoguchi to steal some irises and cat-tails for him from the temple garden. Mizoguchi takes them to Kashiwagi's boarding-house, and while discussing the story of Nansen and the kitten, Kashiwagi starts to make an arrangement, mentioning that he is being taught ikebana by his girlfriend. Mizoguchi realises that this girlfriend must be the woman he saw at Tenju Hermitage. When she arrives, Kashiwagi breaks up with her, and they quarrel. She runs away and Mizoguchi follows, telling her that he witnessed her tragic scene two years ago. She is moved, and tries to seduce him, but again he is assailed by visions of the temple, and he is impotent. ===Enmity with Father Dosen=== In January 1949 Mizoguchi is walking through Shinkyogoku when he thinks he sees Father Dosen with a geisha. Momentarily distracted, he starts to follow a stray dog, loses it, and then in a back alley he runs into the Superior just as he is getting into a hired car with the geisha. He is so surprised that he laughs out loud, and Father Dosen calls him a fool. Over the next two months Mizoguchi becomes obsessed with reproducing Dosen's brief expression of hatred. He buys a photograph of the geisha and slips it into Dosen's morning newspaper. The Superior gives no sign of having found it, but secretly places the photo in Mizoguchi's drawer the next day. When Mizoguchi finds it there, he feels victorious. He tears it up, wraps the shreds in newspaper with a stone, and sinks it in the pond. As Mizoguchi's mental illness worsens, he neglects his studies. On 9 November 1949, the Superior reprimands him for his poor work. Mizoguchi responds by borrowing ¬•3000 from Kashiwagi, who characteristically raises ¬•500 of the money by taking back and selling the flute and dictionary he had given as presents. He goes to Takeisao-jinja (a shrine also known as Kenkun-jinja) and draws a mikuji lot which warns him not to travel northwest. He sets off northwest the next morning, to the region of his birth, and spends three days at Yura (now Tangoyura), where the sight of the Sea of Japan inspires him to destroy the Kinkaku. He is retrieved by a policeman, and on his return he is met by his angry mother, who is relieved to learn that he did not steal the money he used to flee. Obsessed by the idea of arson, one day he follows a guilty-looking boy to the Sammon Gate of the My≈çshin-ji, and is amazed and disappointed when the boy does not set it alight. He compiles a long list of old temples which have burnt down. By May his debt (with 10% simple interest per month) has grown to ¬•5100. Kashiwagi is angry, and comes to suspect that Mizoguchi is considering suicide. On 10 June Kashiwagi complains to Father Dosen, who gives him the principal; afterwards, Kashiwagi shows letters to Mizoguchi that reveal the fact that Tsurukawa did not die in a road accident, but committed suicide over a love affair. He hopes to discourage Mizoguchi from doing anything similar. For the last time, they discuss the Zen story of Nansen and the kitten. ===Final events=== On 15 June, Father Dosen takes the unusual step of giving Mizoguchi ¬•4250 in cash for his next year's tuition. Mizoguchi spends it on prostitutes in the hope that Dosen will be forced to expel him. But he quickly tires of waiting for Dosen to find out, and when he spies on Dosen in the Tower of the North Star, and sees him crouched in the \\"garden waiting\\" position, he cannot account for this evidence of secret shame, and is filled with confusion. The next day he buys arsenic and a knife at a shop near Senbon-Imadegawa, an intersection 2 km to the southeast of the temple, and loiters outside Nishijin Police Station. The outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June, and the failure of Kinkaku's fire-alarm on 29 June, seem to him signs of encouragement. On 30 June a repairman tries to fix it, but he is unsuccessful, and promises to return the next day. He does not come. A strange interview with the visiting Father Kuwai Zenkai, of Ryuho-ji in Fukui Prefecture, provides the final inspiration, and in the early hours of 2 July Mizoguchi sneaks into the Kinkaku and dumps his belongings, placing three straw bales in corners of the ground floor. He goes outside to sink some non-inflammable items in the pond, but on turning back to the temple he finds himself filled with his childhood visions of its beauty, and he is overcome by uncertainty. Finally he remembers the words from the Rinzairoku, \\"When you meet the Buddha, kill the Buddha\\", and he resolves to go ahead with his plan. He enters the Kinkaku and sets the bales on fire. He runs upstairs and tries to enter the Kukky≈çch≈ç, but the door is locked. He hammers at the door for a minute or two. Suddenly feeling that a glorious death has been \\"refused\\" him, he runs back downstairs and out of the temple, choking on the smoke. He continues running, out of the temple grounds, and up the hill named Hidari Daimonji, to the north. He throws away the arsenic and knife, lights a cigarette, watches the pavilion burn, and thinks that \\"I will live\\". ==Characters== *Mizoguchi (Ê∫ùÂè£) **Mizoguchi's father **Mizoguchi's mother *Uiko (ÊúâÁÇ∫Â≠ê), the girl who is \\"cursed\\" by him *Tsurukawa (È∂¥Â∑ù), his kind friend, a fellow acolyte *Kashiwagi (ÊüèÊú®), his evil friend, a student at Otani University *Father Tayama Dosen, the Superior at Rokuon-ji *Father Kuwai Zenkai, who visits (ch. 10) *the American soldier and his girlfriend (ch. 3) *the girl whom Kashiwagi tricks (ch. 5) *the girl from Kashiwagi's boarding-house (ch. 5) *the woman from Tenju Hermitage *the naval cadet (ch. 1) *the prostitute Mariko (ch. 9) ==Reception== Hortense Calisher of The New York Times referred to The Temple of the Golden Pavilion as \\"surely one of his best\\" and noted that it had been praised upon its 1959 release in the west. ==Allusions and referencesStructure of the pavilion=== *the ground floor, H≈çsui-in (Ê≥ïÊ∞¥Èô¢), from which the S≈çsei juts into Ky≈çko Pond ÔºàÈè°ÊπñÔºâ *the middle floor, Ch≈çond≈ç (ÊΩÆÈü≥Ê¥û) *the top floor, Kukky≈çch≈ç (Á©∫Á´üÈ†Ç) ===Allusions to other works=== *The Rinzairoku (Ëá®Ê∏àÈåÑ, late 9th century), a sacred text of the Rinzai school of Zen **In Chinese this is called L√≠nj√¨-l√π, the Record of Linji *The Mumonkan (ÁÑ°ÈñÄÈóú, \\"The Gateless Gate\\", 1228) **J≈çsh≈´ J≈´shin is the Japanese rendering of Ë∂ôÂ∑ûÂæûË´ó, Zh√†ozh≈çu C≈çngshƒõn (778‚Äì897) **Nansen Fugan is the Japanese rendering of ÂçóÊ≥âÊôÆÈ°ò, N√°nqu√°n P«îyu√†n (748‚Äì835) *On Crimes and Punishments, by Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria (ch. 9) ===Allusions to actual history, geography and current science=== The real story The only detailed information in English on the arson comes from Albert Borowitz's Terrorism For Self-Glorification: The Herostratos Syndrome (2005), which includes translations of interview transcripts published in the book Kinkaku-ji Enj≈ç (1979) by Mizukami Tsutomo, a novelist who had known the boy at school. The acolyte's name was Hayashi Y≈çken, and the Superior's name was Murakami Jikai. The prostitute to whom he boasted was called Heya Teruko. Hayashi's mother threw herself in front of a train soon after the event. His sentence was reduced on account of his schizophrenia; he was released on 29 September 1955, the same year that the rebuilding commenced, and died in March 1956. (Borowitz comments that many accounts avoid giving the acolyte's name, perhaps to prevent him from becoming a celebrity.) The pavilion's interior paintings were restored much later; even the gold leaf, which was mostly all gone long before 1950, was replaced. Mishima collected all the information he could, even visiting Hayashi in prison, and as a result the novel follows the real situation with surprising closeness. ==Film, television, and theatrical adaptationsFilm=== *Enjo (\\"Conflagration\\", 1958), directed by Kon Ichikawa, was by far the most critically successful film to be made from a Mishima novel. *Kinkaku-ji (1976), directed by Yoichi Takabayashi *The book was one of three Mishima novels adapted by Paul Schrader for episodes in his film Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters (1985). ===Other=== *Kinkaku-ji (1976), an opera by Toshiro Mayuzumi *Kinkaku-ji (2002), a modern dance work by Kenji Kawarasaki (Company East) *Kinkaku-ji (2011), a stage adaptation by Serge Lamothe, directed by Amon Miyamoto (Kanagawa Art Theater) *The Golden Pavilion (2012), an ensemble piece in two movements by Karol Beffa.

Prior to RFD, individuals living in remote homesteads had to pick up mail themselves at sometimes distant post offices or pay private carriers for delivery (this fee was in addition to the postage paid by the mailer). RFD became a political football, with politicians promising it to voters and using it themselves to reach voters. The proposal to offer free rural delivery was not universally embraced. Private carriers and local shopkeepers feared a loss of business. The United States Post Office Department began experiments with Rural Free Delivery as early as 1890. However, it was not until 1893 that Georgia Representative Thomas E. Watson pushed through legislation that mandated the practice. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica - Rural Free Delivery However, universal implementation was slow; RFD was not adopted generally in the United States Post Office until 1902. The rural delivery service has used a network of rural routes traveled by carriers to deliver mail to and pick it up from roadside mailboxes. Rural Free Delivery vehicle (from Popular Mechanics, September 1905) ==History== Rural carrier in an early electric vehicle, circa 1910 Until the late 19th century, residents of rural areas had to travel to a distant post office to pick up their mail or to pay for delivery by a private carrier. Postmaster General John Wanamaker, owner of a major department store, was ardently in favor of Rural Free Delivery (RFD), with many thousands of Americans living in rural communities who wanted to send and receive retail orders inexpensively. However, the adoption of a nationwide RFD system had many opponents. Some were simply opposed to the cost of the service. Private express carriers thought inexpensive rural mail delivery would eliminate their business, and many town merchants worried the service would reduce farm families' weekly visits to town to obtain goods and merchandise or that mail order merchants selling through catalogs, such as Sears, Roebuck and Company, might present significant competition. Support for the introduction of a nationwide rural mail delivery service came from The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, the nation's oldest agricultural organization. Fayette County in east-central Indiana claims to be the birthplace of Rural Free Delivery. Milton Trusler, a leading farmer in the county, began advocating the idea in 1880; as the president of the Indiana Grange, he spoke to farmers statewide frequently over the following sixteen years.Division of Historic Preservation and Archeology. Fayette County Interim Report. Indianapolis: Indiana Department of Natural Resources, 1981-07, xviii. The Post Office Department first experimented with the idea of rural mail delivery on October 1, 1891 to determine the viability of RFD. It began with five routes covering ten miles, 33 years after free delivery in cities had begun. The first routes to receive RFD during its experimental phase were in Jefferson County, West Virginia, near Charles Town, Halltown, and Uvilla. Legislation by US Representative Thomas E. Watson of Georgia mandated the practice, and RFD finally became an official service in 1896. That year, 82 rural routes were put into operation. A massive undertaking, nationwide RFD service took several years to implement, and remains the \\"biggest and most expensive endeavor\\" ever instituted by the U.S. postal service. The service has grown steadily. By 1901, the mileage had increased to over 100,000; the cost was $1,750,321 and over 37,000 carriers were employed. In 1910, the mileage was 993,068; the cost was $36,915,000, and 40,997 carriers were employed. In 1913 came the introduction of parcel post delivery, which caused another boom in rural deliveries. Parcel post service allowed the distribution of national newspapers and magazines, and was responsible for millions of dollars of sales in mail-order merchandise to customers in rural areas. In 1930, 43,278 rural routes served about 6,875,321 families, about 25,471,735 persons, at a cost of $106,338,341. In 1916, the Rural Post \\"Good\\" Roads Act authorized federal funds for rural post roads. ==First routes== The following is a list of the first rural routes established in each state, along with the names of the (up to three) post offices served and the date of establishment. { !

Zubeldia also failed to deliver in the 2004 Tour de France, to the chagrin of Basque fans lining the road. \\"I wish that our uniform was not so easy to spot,\\" admitted directeur sportif Juli√°n Gorospe. In the 2005 season the team recruited Aitor Gonz√°lez, who won the Tour de Suisse. They again failed to make an impression in the 2005 Tour de France. In 2006 the sporting director Juli√°n Gorospe was replaced by Igor Gonz√°lez de Galdeano, who became technical secretary. Euskaltel‚ÄìEuskadi ranked 13th in the UCI World Tour rankings among 18 teams, but only the top 15 teams automatically qualify for the World Tour for the following year (source?). The other teams qualify based on a variety of criteria, including team points and a dedication to clean racing, but the most important are points earned by individual riders. Under points pressure, Euskaltel confirmed in 2012 that it would break with its long-standing policy of signing a majority of Basque riders and would employ riders of other countries to assure its UCI World Tour standing. This has had knock on effects for the makeup of other traditionally Basque teams such as Orbea and Caja Rural. For example, in the 2013 season Euskaltel's Amets Txurruka and Iv√°n Velasco moved to . The withdrawal of sponsorship via government funds prompted the team to announce it would be unable to continue after the 2013 season. In September 2013 Formula One racing driver Fernando Alonso expressed a wish to ensure the team's survival by buying their UCI World Tour license but reached no agreement with the team. In 2018 Mikel Landa, the President of the Euskadi Cycling Foundation, established Team Fundaci√≥n Euskadi on the Continental tour. ==Final team rosterMajor wins== ;1995 : Stages 4 & 8 Volta ao

(c. 1195 ‚Äì May 1, 1256 in Rio Tinto, Gondomar; ) was a Portuguese infanta (princess), later Queen consort of Castile for a brief period. She was the second youngest daughter of King Sancho I of Portugal and Dulce of Aragon. Married briefly to the ten-year-old Henry I of Castile, she held for a time the title Queen of Castile. Upon the dissolution of the marriage, Mafalda returned to her homeland. She chose to become a Cistercian nun, and became noted for the holiness of her life. She was declared Blessed by the Catholic Church five centuries after her death. ==LifeEarly life=== Mafalda of Portugal was born around 1195, the daughter of King Sancho I of Portugal and his queen, Dulce of Aragon. On the death of her father, Mafalda, under the provisions of his will, was to receive the Seia Castle and the remaining portion of the municipality as well as all income produced there. Furthermore, she was granted the right to use the title of queen. This created a conflict with her brother Afonso II O Gordo, who, wanting a centralized power, hindered his sister from receiving the titles and the corresponding rights. Afonso feared that something similar could happen with his two sisters, Teresa and Sancha, and their eventual heirs, creating a problem of sovereignty that could come to divide the country. Much of the Portuguese nobles sided with Mafalda and her sisters, but they were defeated.McMurdo, Edward. The History of Portugal: From the Commencement of the Monarchy to the Reign of Alfonso III, S. Low, Marston, Searle, & Rivington, 1888 On the death of Afonso II, his son Sancho II granted some lands and castles to his aunts but he made them renounce the title of princess-queen. The final peace came in 1223. ===Marriage=== In 1215, a political marriage was arranged between Mafalda and her young cousin Henry I of Castile. As he was about ten years old, the marriage was never consummated, and it was dissolved the following year on grounds of consanguinity.A History of Portugal, CUP Archive She then returned to Portugal. Altar of Our Lady of Silva, Porto ===Monastic life=== In 1220, Mafalda chose not to marry again and became a nun at the Abbey of Arouca, though she was granted a special dispensation to retain control of her inheritance. She became abbess of the community, then one of Benedictine nuns, and in 1226 had her request to transfer the abbey to the Cistercian Order granted by the pope. She had a great devotion to Our Lady of Silva and made substantial donations to the shrine. She also had a hospice for travelers built as well as a number of bridges, churches, monasteries, and hospitals.Merton, Thomas. In the Valley of Wormwood, Liturgical Press, 2013, She helped to establish her own abbey as a major religious center in the region for centuries. Returning from a pilgrimage to the shrine of Our Lady of Silva, she fell ill at Rio Tinto, Gondomar, and died at the monastery of Cistercians monks there on May 1, 1256. In 1616, wanting to return her body to Arouca as part of the process of her possible canonization, it was found not to have deteriorated, which generated a strong devotion to the Portuguese princess. She was beatified in 1792 by Pope Pius VI. Her feast day is celebrated on June 20, together with her two sisters. ==AncestryReferences== Category:1190s births Category:1256 deaths Category:House of Burgundy-Portugal Category:Portuguese infantas Category:Castilian queen consorts Category:Portuguese Roman Catholic religious sisters and nuns Category:Portuguese Roman Catholics Category:Female saints of medieval Portugal Category:Cistercian abbesses Category:Cistercian beatified people Category:Roman Catholic royal saints Category:13th-century Christian saints Category:13th-century venerated Christians Category:Incorrupt saints Category:12th-century Portuguese women Category:13th-century Portuguese women Category:13th-century Spanish women Category:13th-century Castilians ","title":"Mafalda of Portugal"},{"id":"2227136","text":"The Bolivian city of Cobija is located about 600 km (373 mi.) north of La Paz in the Amazon Basin on the border with Brazil. Cobija lies on the banks of the Rio Acre across from the Brazilian city of Brasil√©ia. Cobija lies at an elevation of ca. 280 m (920 ft.) above sea level and has a tropical and rainy climate. Cobija has approximately 56,000 inhabitants, is the seat of a university and capital of the Bolivian Pando Department. Cobija has two airports and is connected by one road to El Choro in the Beni Department, which is not always passable during the rainy season. When the rain allows it, Cobija is connected to the rest of Bolivia also via road. Cobija is connected to Brazil by two bridges. ==History== Cobija was founded in 1906 by Colonel Enrique Cornejo, originally under the name of Bah√≠a and received its current name in 1908 in commemoration of the former Bolivian seaport Cobija on the Pacific, which has been a part of Chile since the War of the Pacific. In the early 1900s, Cobija experienced a boom as an India rubber industry center. When the industry collapsed, a major source of income being lost, Cobija became impoverished and its population fell. Nowadays, Cobija is developing again and its population is increasing. Currently, the region's primary industry is Bolivia nuts, although tourism and commerce are growing. There is a Free economic zone in the city, the largest in Bolivia.http://zofracobija.gob.bo/ ==Population== The inhabitants of Cobija has risen very strongly during the past two decades to more than five-fold. Currently the estimated population is as much as 60,000 inhabitants with a population growth of 6 to 8% per year. {  ! Year ! Population !

Located at an altitude of above sea level and in the north-western jungle region ‚Äì in Brazilian border ‚Äì Cobija is considered the rainiest region in Bolivia. It is also a warm spot (exception made for a couple of weeks a year, when a fresh wind from the south blows), with day temperatures above most of the time. Cobija has two seasons: The rain season (when is possible to enjoy powerful rainfalls and the vegetation is at its best) and the dry season (when roads are good and excursions deep into the Jungle are made possible, to \\"lago Bay\\" for instance). Usually locals use the hottest hours of the day to stay at home, have lunch and a good siesta. But the most active ones enjoy also outdoor activities. The average annual precipitation averages between depending upon the seasonal flooding intensity. Furthermore, contrary to popular belief, Cobija is not the wettest area in Bolivia, as the average annual precipitation in the Chapare lowlands of Cochabamba can receive more than of rain per year in some areas. ==Gallery== File:COBIJA 149 Busto Jos√© Manuel Pando.JPGCobija, Bolivia File:Cobija Parque Central por Richard Weiss.JPGCentral Park in Cobija File:Riberalta to Cobija por Richard Weiss.JPGView along the road towards Riberalta File:Cobija Airport1.JPGOld facade of Cobija airport, before the reformation.

Her childhood was not happy and her father died in 1792. In 1808 she married Jan Alois Sudiprav Rettig, a Czech patriot from a half-German speaking family. Under his influence she learned to speak and write correctly in the Czech language and also started to use her middle name Dobromila. Rettigov√° was active in the Czech National Revival movement, also helped to found an educational institute for girls (her main advice for the girls was to keep their husband happy no matter what). Of her 11 children only three survived into adult age. She died, aged 60, in Litomy≈°l. Her early literary works were mostly syrupy and sentimental texts. In 1826 Rettigov√° published her legendary (in Czech circles) recipe book \\"A Household Cookery Book or A Treatise on Meat and Fasting Dishes for Bohemian and Moravian Lasses\\". This book became a 19th-century bestseller and for a long time remained the only cookery book written in Czech. Rettigov√° continued to improve the book with culinary experiments.

Before the formation of the Comarca in 1997, Chichica was in the province of Chiriqu√≠ in the Republic of Panama. The Comarca is divided into three regions: ≈á√∂ Kribo, Nedrini, and Kadri. Each of these is divided into districts, and the districts are divided into corregimientos, or townships per the Panamanian system. Chichica is located in the region Kadri, District M√ºn√§, and corregimiento of Chichica. The Comarca Ng√§be-Bugl√© is characterized by mountainous terrain, steep slopes, and generally nutrient poor soil with high rock content, all characteristics that make farming difficult. This is interesting because agriculture and subsistence farming are the main forms of work in the Comarca. On the Caribbean slope there is no dry season and tropical forest dominates the landscape; on the Pacific slope there is a windy dry season (December to April) and a wet season. As a result of increased seasonal variation, there are more localized geographies on the Pacific slope and vegetation consists of grasses mixed with tropical forest cover. Small perennial streams and larger rivers run on both sides of the continental divide and are used for bathing, laundry, and drinking. In the region most travel is done on foot or horseback, however in the community of Chichica year-round road access is available. The topography of Chichica is dominated by ridges and valleys, where the concentration of population is along the ridges extending into the valleys. The main town of Chichica is more contiguous as neighborhoods expand or as older neighborhoods grow from water sources in the valleys toward the main ridge. To the North is the Cordillera, or central spine of mountains, that split Panama in North and South halves. To the South are the Pacific Ocean and the coastal plain ‚Äì making Chichica in the Pacific slope climate. Chichica and its corregimiento does not touch the Cordillera or the Pacific Ocean, however these two topographical/geological formations play heavily into the climate, transportation, diet, and daily lives of the people of Chichica. The city of Chichica is located 8.4 miles (13.5 kilometers) North of Tol√© in direct line of travel. On roads, Chichica is 15.7 miles (25.2 kilometers) North of Tol√©. Using public transportation, which can be picked up at the piquera, or bus stop, in Tol√©, it takes between 45 minutes and 1 hour to reach Chichica. Using private transportation, which 4x4 is necessary, the time can be cut in half. Its primary road is oriented in a Southwesterly to Northeasterly direction on top of a ridge. The initial rise into Chichica from the river ‚Äì R√≠o Culebra ‚Äì and stream ‚Äì Quebrada Otoe ‚Äì is Northwest to Southeast. Lastly, in the neighborhood of Cuatro Pinos, the road changes to a direct North/South orientation. As you drive into Chichica from Tol√©, the first neighborhood is El Retiero ‚Äì which is located on the initial incline into Chichica, until the road changes to its SW/NE direction. At this point, there is a trail on your right that leads to the neighborhood of Cerro Plata ‚Äì a 45 minute walk from the Chichica schools. As you continue forward into Chichica, the neighborhood of La Loma will be to your left, before you reach the store ‚ÄúLa Tiendita.‚Äù La Loma continues down the hill and wraps behind the school where it meets up with the neighborhood of Las Naranjas. The main part of town that runs from ‚ÄúLa Tiendita‚Äù to the Health Center is called Chichica Centro or just Chichica. Within that space, there is a small path that runs off to the right, in front of the Evangelical Church, to the neighborhood of La Jujuca. This neighborhood runs past the stream all the way to the large rock outcrop that looks over La Tinta Valley. This trail is also the primary trail to Las Tijeras. Just after the Health Center, there is a nondescript trail on the left to the neighborhood of La Pita ‚Äì previously called Los Mangos. When the road diverges for the first time, you have reached the neighborhood of Cuatro Pinos. This neighborhood continues on both roads and stops at the large hill that descends toward Cerro Grito and Pe√±a Blanca. The center of Cuatro Pinos, where a piquera used to exist, is at the triangle of land that divides the road the second time. This division routes the road toward Pe√±a Blanca or toward Cerro Algad√≥n. Lastly, if you follow the road that diverges toward Cerro Algad√≥n, you will descend into the town of Las Lajitas. There is some disagreement about Las Lajitas being its own city or a neighborhood of Chichica; however, the consensus that has been discovered is that Las Lajitas is not part of Chichica due to gathered census data from the Panamanian Government. The main disagreement is between the age groups ‚Äì older people dividing the two towns and younger people grouping Las Lajitas as a neighborhood of Chichica. There is a confusion of boundaries as well because of the conjoined aqueduct system and a cultural center of Chichica that is located in Las Lajitas. ==References== Category:Comarcas of Panama ","title":"Chichica, Ng√∂be-Bugl√©"},{"id":"2227186","text":"Eastern Orthodox cross July 14 - Eastern Orthodox Church calendar - July 16 All fixed commemorations below are celebrated on July 28 by Old Calendar.

Yuksom is where there is the Norbugang Chorten near the Norbugang throne, the place Namgyal was crowned and several monasteries and a lake. The dynastic rule of the Chogyals lasted for 333 years. The Chogyal established the first monastery at Yuksom in Sikkim known as the Dubdi Monastery in 1701, which is part of Buddhist religious pilgrimage circuit involving the Norbugang Chorten, Pemayangtse Monastery, the Rabdentse ruins, the Sanga Choeling Monastery, the Khecheopalri Lake, and the Tashiding Monastery. For the Bhutia tribal community of Sikkim, Yuksom has special religious and cultural significance. It has a number of famous Buddhist monasteries and historical monuments as well as ancient Gorkhas small Village. Being at the head of the Khangchendzonga National Park and as the base camp for trekking to Mt. Khangchendzonga, it has large influx of mountaineers from all parts of the world. The village people, as stake holders in biodiversity preservation of the Rathong Chu valley, where the village is situated, have played a significant role in trendsetting and promotion of eco- tourism in the area. The inhabitants of this village have most successfully adopted promotion of ecotourism not only in the region but also for other similar areas in Sikkim. Yuksom is thus considered a model village for eco- tourism. ==Etymology== Yuksom literally means the \\"meeting place of the three learned monks\\" as three monks who came from Tibet selected Phuntsog Namgyal as the first King of Sikkim and gave him the title Chogyal. 'Chogyal' means \\"Religious King\\" or \\"the king who rules with righteousness\\". Yuksom is also one of the sacred landscape \\"Demazong\\" (meaning a valley of rice) of four religious sites blessed by Guru Padmasambhava, which are considered to be the four plexuses of the human body, and Yuksom symbolically represents the 'third eye'. ==History== Buddhism was introduced to the state from Tibet as early as the 9th century. In Tibet, the struggle for power between the \\"Yellow hats\\" and the \\"Red hats\\" led to the latter migrating to Sikkim and converting the mild mannered local Lepchas to Buddhism. In the 13th century, relations between Sikkim and Tibet were cemented by a \\"Brotherhood treaty\\" signed between the Lepcha chief Thekong Thek and Tibetan prince Khe-Bhumsa at Kavi, in north Sikkim. In 1641, Lama Lutsum Chembo travelled from Tibet to Denjong (meaning hidden country) now known as Sikkim to propagate the Buddhist religion. He was then joined by two other lamas, Sempa Chembo and Rinzing Chembo. The trinity of Lamas came from the Kham district in Tibet. Their primary aim was to perpetuate Tibetan hold on Sikkim and to propagate Buddhism in Sikkim. They assembled from different directions at Norbugang, which later came to be known as Yuksom. The area in the Rathong chu Valley at Narbugong was considered as blessed by the 9th century Guru Padmasambhava (Guru Rinpoche). In 1642 the Lamas went in pursuit of the fourth person, as the current three lamas represented three directions of North, South and West and Padmasambhava's vision had predicted the requirement for a fourth person from the east. Near present-day Gangtok, they found a man churning milk. He offered them some refreshments and gave them shelter. So impressed were they by his deeds that they realised that he was a chosen one. They also identified Phunstsog Namgyal's ancestral royal links with Tibet and decided that he was the right person to become the temporal and religious head of the region so brought him to Yuksom. They then crowned him at Norbugang near Yuksom as the temporal and religious king of Sikkim, with the title \\"Chogyal\\". The crowning took place at Norbugang on a pedestal set in stones, in a pine-covered hill, and he was anointed by sprinkling water from a sacred urn. At that time he was 38 years of age. He was a fifth generation descendant of Guru Tashi, a 13th- century prince from the Mi-nyak House in Kham in Eastern Tibet. Thereafter, the dynastic rule of Chogyals, propagation of the Buddhist religion and building of monasteries and chortens took firm roots in Sikkim. The Namgyal monarchy of 12 kings lasted from 1642 till 1975 (333 years). Tibetan Mahayana Buddhism known as Vajrayana sect was introduced, which ultimately was recognized as the state religion of Sikkim. ==Geography and environment== Location map of Yuksom and other religious sites nearby on the Yuksom-Goecha trek route Yuksom is a large village with a total area of situated at an average altitude of . It lies in a basin-like valley surrounded by mountain ranges. Located at the head of the Khangchendzonga National Park, it is the gateway to Mt. Kangchenjunga A popular mountaineering trek starts from Yuksom, which is well connected by a road network with Geyzing and Gangtok. The climate in Yuksom, which is located at a moderate altitude, is pleasant from March to June and September to November, while in the winter season, the coldest months are December and February. Countryside en route to Yuksom from Gangtok The natural environmental setting of the town, ensconced amidst rich forests is further accentuated by its history, architecture and Buddhist legacy that evolved from the 17th century with Yuksom's establishment as the first capital of Sikkim. Situated at the head of Khangchenjunga National Park, the largest Protected Area in Sikkim, and at starting gate for the trekking trail to Mt. Khangchendzonga, Yuksom and its hills was named in the past as Ney-Pemathang for its beautiful landscape. The forest cover in the hills consist of broad-leaved oak, birch, maple, chestnut, magnolia, rhododendron, silver fir, ash and alder, which complement the epithet of \\"biodiversity hot- spot\\" given to Sikkim. ==Administration== The main street in Yuksom The first act that Phuntsog initiated after becoming the King was the conversion of the local Lepcha tribes to Buddhism and set about expanding his kingdom up to the Chumbi Valley in Tibet, parts of modern-day Darjeeling in the south, and parts of eastern Nepal. In this effort the three lamas also lent full support to him. Phuntsog moved his capital to Yuksom and instituted the first centralised administration. The kingdom was divided into twelve Dzongs or districts under a Lepcha Dzongpon (governor) who headed a council of twelve ministers. During his reign Buddhism was consolidated as the established religion in Sikkim. He was succeeded by his son, Tensun Namgyal in 1670. However, the importance of Yuksum as capital ended when in 1670, Phuntsok Namgyal‚Äôs son Tensung Namgyal, shifted the capital to Rabdentse. At present, Yuksam is a heritage village in the Geyzing subdivision of West District of Sikkim. It is now an important tourist destination. It is also the starting point of the popular trek to Goechala (via Dzongri). It is the base camp of Himalayan Mountaineering Institute for treks to Mt. Khangchendzonga. ==Demographics== Yuksom is a well established village; according to 2001 census, there are 364 households in the village inhabited by 1,951 persons. However, the visiting population of tourists far exceeds the permanent population as it is on the trekking route and is also as a religious centre for Buddhists. In the village, the Bhutias and the Nepalese constitute major communities, with the Bhutia community being the dominant ethnic group. However, the service and the trading sectors are dominated by people from the plains. ==Economy and facilities== Gupta's Restaurant, Yuksom Hotel Demazong, Yuksom With the Himalayan trekking to Khangchendzonga mountain and the Khangchendzonga National Park, centred in the Yuksom town as the base camp, the economy of the town has now become tourism centric. Consequently, the Khangchendzonga Conservation Committee (KCC) located at Yuksom, with the village community as the stakeholders, with Forest Department acting as the chief coordinating agency, have planned several innovative programmes to promote ecotourism, concurrent with encouragement of local handicrafts. The village has well established primary and secondary schools. There are three primary schools, one junior school and a senior secondary school. Basic amenities of primary health, potable drinking water, gas and electric supply, post and telegraph office are all well established. To meet the increasing tourist inflow, infrastructure facilities such as hotels guest houses and transportation have also developed, although with attendant concerns of effect on biodiversity and ecological preservation. The environment awareness level is also very high among the village community so much so that the village is now at the core of social activists. They keep a close watch on the environmental and economic conditions in the village. The Yuksom-Dzongri trek is a popular high altitude trek along the Rathong Chu River in West Sikkim. The trek passes through dense forests, alpine lakes and terminates at the Khangchendzonga. An ecotourism impact study of this route has been carried out jointly by the Forest Department, the Mountain Institute and the Khangchendzonga Conservation Committee (KCC), which is based in Yuksom. Considering that this route has recorded large number of visitors (mostly from England, United States, Germany, France, Australia, Netherlands and Switzerland) in the period between 1990 and 2005 (more than doubled in this period of 15 years), two main trekking seasons of March to May and September to November with October being the peak month have been noted. However, the winter months of January and February are the lean months. Based on this study, innovative additional trek routes have been planned to encourage ecotourism all through the year. The additional packages suggested are the \\"Monsoon Magic\\" Alpine Treks and Subtropical Winter Treks, which would promote ecotourism economy with due consideration of the carrying capacity of the region. ==CultureBiodiversity festival=== 250px As sequel to the above efforts by the local community, a biodiversity festival was held at Yuksom, for one day, the first of its kind to be held in Sikkim (the second festival was held at Chungthong) by KCC, and the Forest Department of Government of Sikkim. The objective of the festival was to create awareness among the people of the villages to conserve cultural and natural heritage. This festival was attended by 200 villagers and also some foreign tourists. In the festival the focus was on pictorial exhibitions of the natural biodiversity setting and cultural heritage of the Rathong Chuu valley, the steps taken to preserve and conserve the biosphere, interest of ecotourism in the valley along the trek route Yuksom Dzongri through the Khangchendzonga National Park, diverse exhibits relating to medicine, paper making, horticulture, Khecheopalri Lake pollution and actions for its preservation, effects of deforestation and need to preserve forest wealth, measures for hill slope stability, energy efficient methods for cooking using local produce, garbage reduction, replacement and reuse, composting with biodegradable wastes, promoting traditional handicrafts and handlooms (carpets, sheep wool blankets, etc.). Puppet shows, music and local dance programmes also formed part of the festival.Apte, pp.63‚Äì65 ===Monasteries=== The Tibetan Buddhist monastery, Dubdi Monastery, is located in the area and also the smaller Mallu Monastery. Established in 1701, Dubdi Monastery professes to be the oldest monastery in Sikkim and is located at the top of a hill about an hour's walk from Yuksom. It was also known as the Hermit's Cell after its reclusive founder Lhatsun Namkha Jigme. ==Gallery== File:Yuksom Dubdi Gompa.jpgDubdi Monastery File:Ngadak Chenpo chorling gumpa ‚Äì Yuksam.jpgNgadak Chenpo Chorling Gompa File:Kartok gumpa - yuksam.jpgKartok Gompa ==References External links == * * Yuksom ==Films== * Singalila in the Himalaya * Goecha La: In Search of Kangchenjunga by George Thengummoottil http://www.theindia.info/Goecha_La:_In_Search_of_Kangchenjunga Film speaks about Yuksum and Goecha La trekking in Sikkim Category:Cities and towns in West Sikkim district Category:Hill stations in Sikkim ","title":"Yuksom"},{"id":"2227208","text":"WOI (640 AM) ‚Äì branded Iowa Public Radio ‚Äì is a non-commercial educational radio station licensed to serve Ames, Iowa. Owned by Iowa State University, the station covers the Des Moines metropolitan area. Broadcasting a mix of public radio and talk radio, WOI is the flagship station for Iowa Public Radio's News Network and the market member station for NPR, Public Radio International, and the BBC World Service. The WOI studios are located at Iowa State University's Communications Building, while the station transmitter resides southwest of Ames. Besides a standard analog transmission, WOI broadcasts a digital signal utilizing the HD in-band on-channel standard,http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/sta_det.pl?Facility_id=29119 is relayed over low-power Ames FM translator K234CN (104.7 FM) and is available online. Historically, WOI is among one of the oldest radio stations in the United States, and one of the oldest surviving stations in North America, having begun experimental transmissions in 1911. ==History== The history of WOI can be traced back to 1911 when physics professor \\"Dad\\" Hoffman set a transmission line between the Campus Water Tower and the Engineering Building and set up a wireless telegraph station. By 1913 this was known as experimental station 9YI and it was sending and receiving weather reports by Morse code on a regular basis. The first sound broadcast was an hour of concert music on November 21, 1921. The Commerce Department issued a full radio license for station WOI in April 1922 and the first regular broadcast took place on April 28, 1922. The original call sign 9YI is now W0YI and is retained by the ISU Campus Radio Club, with the amateur radio station in the Electrical Engineering building. WOI may be the oldest fully licensed noncommercial station west of the Mississippi River. Another university radio station in Iowa, WSUI at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, also began telegraph transmissions in 1911 and also has claims to being the earliest educational station west of the Mississippi. Other Midwestern universities also started experimental stations in the 1910s: the University of Minnesota's KUOM and St. Louis University's WEW in 1912 and the University of Wisconsin's WHA in 1915. The first regular programming on WOI was farm market reports gathered by ticker tape and Morse code, broadcast throughout the state. Another early staple was sporting events by Iowa State's athletic teams. In 1925, \\"The Music Shop\\" aired for the first time. One of the longest-running programs in the history of radio, it moved to WOI-FM in the 1970s before going off the air in 2006. In 1927. another longtime favorite, \\"The Book Club\\" was added; it also aired until 2006. On December 1, 1949, Iowa State launched an FM adjunct to WOI, WOI-FM at 90.1 MHz. WOI-TV was subsequently launched in 1950 as the first television station in central Iowa. It was also the first commercial TV station in the country owned by an educational institution. It was affiliated with all four networks of its time before it became solely an ABC affiliate in 1955. WOI-TV was sold by the Iowa Board of Regents on March 1, 1994; the station is now owned by TEGNA. WOI-AM-FM became a charter member of National Public Radio when it began its regular schedule of afternoon news program All Things Considered in 1971. Today WOI's programming consists of both NPR and locally produced talk shows along with local news and BBC news updates. The classical music of the early years migrated exclusively to WOI-FM in the 1960s. When the radio services of Iowa's state universities were merged into Iowa Public Radio in 2004, WOI became the flagship of IPR's Operations and IT services. Due to its location near the bottom of the AM dial and Iowa's mostly flat landscape (with near-perfect ground conductivity), WOI's non-directional 5,000 watt daytime signal reaches most of the state of Iowa, similar to 50,000 watt WHO. With a good radio, WOI can also be heard in parts of Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska and South Dakota. A single tower is used during the day. At night, because of the nighttime propagation the signal is reduced to 1,000 watts at night and two towers are used in a phased array configuration to protect KFI in Los Angeles, concentrating the signal eastward around Des Moines, Waterloo and Cedar Rapids. ==ReferencesIowa Public Radio ‚Äì IPR News * Spark to Voice - History of 9YI and early WOI ¬µ Category:Radio stations established in 1922 Category:NPR member stations Category:1922 establishments in Iowa Category:American radio stations with a three-letter call sign ","title":"WOI (AM)"},{"id":"2227216","text":"Comendador is the capital of the El√≠as Pi√±a province of the Dominican Republic.

It has been divided into several current cities and towns, including Nashua, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimack. The town was originally part of a larger town of Dunstable, Massachusetts, when Massachusetts stretched from Rhode Island up to Maine. The original tract of land was bisected by the Merrimack River, an important route for the lucrative fur and log trade. Dunstable was incorporated as a township in 1673.History of the old township of Dunstable: including Nashua, Nashville, Hollis, Hudson, Litchfield, and Merrimac, N.H.; Dunstable and Tyngsborough, Mass. , by Charles James Fox, 1846 on Google books On July 3, 1706, during Queen Anne's War, tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy raided the town, killing nine while seven of the natives were killed.https://archive.org/stream/borderwarsnew00drakrich#page/218/mode/1up When the New Hampshire-Massachusetts border was surveyed and adjusted in 1741, the northern part of the town was determined to be in New Hampshire, and was incorporated as a New Hampshire town in 1746. Both the northern New Hampshire half and the southern Massachusetts half prospered, and various villages were formed along the Merrimack, but also along Salmon Brook, the Nashua River, Pennichuck Brook, and the Souhegan River, which also ran through the tract. Over the years, other towns were formed from parts of the original area on both sides of the state line, and in 1836 the remaining part that still bore the name of \\"Dunstable, New Hampshire\\" was renamed \\"Nashua\\", after the name of the river that flowed into the Merrimack at the location then referred to as \\"Indian Head\\".

It serves as one of the two main border crossings to Haiti (with Dajab√≥n), with a duty-free open-air marketplace operating on the border with Haiti. The town suffered damages in the flash flood of May 25, 2004, which killed many citizens during the night and washed away hundreds of homes. ==History== The name \\"Ximani\\" is of native Ta√≠no origin. Historian Rafael Leonidas P√©rez y P√©rez in his book \\"Annotations on the history of Jiman√≠\\", says that Ximani was a Cacique of the chieftainship of Xaragua who had control of the town that lied in the middle of the two lakes, Lake Enriquillo and Lake Azuei, as well as the pass that leads to Pic la Selle making it a strategical and important part of the island. The name \\"Ximan√≠\\" is recognized when the Spaniards signed a peace agreement with the natives through Enriquillo at \\"the Lagoon of Ximan√≠\\" in 1536. Another version claims the name belongs to a French Count (Count of Jiman√≠). P√©rez y P√©rez clarifies however that this official, was called \\"of Jimani\\" because of him having owned that land, which was awarded to him during the expansion of the French occupation. The historian argues that the French did not occupy the west side of the island, particularly that territory, until the mid 18th century. By the time of the Dominican War of Independence, Jimani was practically deserted with most of the fighting taking place in Neiba. After the independence of 1844 the earliest inhabitants of Jiman√≠ came from various communities of the southwest, such as Neiba, Duverg√©, El Estero, Las Salinas, Azua de Compostela, Santa Cruz de Barahona, and Haitian immigrants from the mountains that married or had common-law marriages with Dominicans, forming families in the most populous neighborhood of the community, known as Jiman√≠ Viejo. By the 1930s Jiman√≠ belonged to Neiba and in 1938 it became part of the commune of La Descubierta, forming a part of the Province of Baoruco. On the 18 of March 1943, by means of the law number 229, Jimani was elevated to municipal district. On December 29 1948 the province of Baoruco was split into two provinces, the west side receiving the name of Independence Province. On January 1 1950, Jimani officially became the Capital of the new province Independencia. ==Climate== Jiman√≠ has a tropical wet and dry climate and relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. Annual rainfall is distributed, peaking in May and October; the dry season occurs from December through February. ==Economy== Agriculture and commerce with Haiti represent the main economic activities of this municipality. In agriculture the main products are cassava, batata, melon, peppers, cilantro and tomatoes. Jiman√≠ has a popular duty-free open-air marketplace with Haiti that is also visited by people from adjoining towns and even from distant regions of the country. In this market, basic food products are sold, as well as foreign beverages, clothes, shoes, and new and used electrical appliances. The customs zone of the border is called \\"The Door\\" and it is visited by foreign tourists that come to observe the dynamics of the business and intercultural and interracial relation between Dominicans and Haitians. The municipal City Hall receives monthly RD$1,000,000 as mandated by the General Law of Budget, through the Dominican Municipal League. The authorities of the City Hall estimate the internal tax collection to be about $15,000 monthly. The municipal districts El Lim√≥n and Boca de Cach√≥n receive monthly $500,000 each one, from the transfer ordered by the law through the Dominican Municipal League. There are two financial institutions in Jiman√≠. A branch office of the Reserve Bank and a branch office of the Cooperative of Savings and Credit of Neiba (Coopacrene). ==Education== There are six basic schools with two daily schedules and four public high schools, three of them for adults. ==Health== The municipality has a municipal hospital and four rural clinics or hospitals. The majority of the Jimanisenses prefer to seek medical attention in the Regional University Hospital Jaime Mota of Barahona. ==Culture and religion== Jiman√≠ is mostly Catholic. Local holidays are celebrated March 19, in honor of their Saint San Jos√©. A carnival is being added to the Patronal Feast, to expand the celebration. Also being instituted is the celebration of a Cultural Week each year, in memory of the flood that destroyed a big part of the population in May 2004. As a historic-cultural monument, Jiman√≠ conserves intact and conditioned the \\"Mansion of Trujillo\\", one of many the dictator built in the border region, although he never spent the night in this particular one. ==Public works== Local governments have carried out different works for the community, such as the reconstruction and restructuring of the municipal cemetery, the reconstruction of street gutters, rehabilitation of electric lighting in the urban area and in the sector of Tierra Nueva. There are also ongoing projects to enlarge the aqueduct network for the neighborhoods of La Cu and El Cerro. ==Organizations== In Jiman√≠ there are several community associations. For example, in each of the towns that conform the municipality there is an Association of Farmers as well as an Association of Mothers. There is also a Lions Club, the Association of Minibuses Jiman√≠- Barahona, a committee that represents the Association of \\"Jimanisenses\\" in Massachusetts, US, a technical team of World Vision, Fundasur (Foundation of the South) and Conani (the National Council for Childhood and Adolescence). ==References== Category:Populated places in Independencia Province Category:Municipalities of the Dominican Republic Category:Dominican Republic‚ÄìHaiti border crossings ","title":"Jiman√≠"},{"id":"2227227","text":"The Political Party of Radicals (, PPR) was a progressive Christian and green political party in the Netherlands. The PPR played a relatively small role in Dutch politics and merged with other left-wing parties to form GreenLeft (Dutch: GroenLinks) in 1991. ==HstoryBefore 1968=== The foundation of the PPR is linked to formation of the De Jong cabinet and the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA). After the 1967 general election, it became clear that a centre-right cabinet would be formed by the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) and Christian Historical Union (CHU), the Catholic People's Party (KVP) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). Progressive forces within the KVP and ARP had hoped for the formation of a centre-left cabinet with the Labour Party (PvdA) without the participation of the CHU and the VVD. In March 1967 a group of \\"regret voters\\" (ARP-members who regretted voting ARP) published an advertisement in the Protestant newspaper Trouw, aimed at the leadership of the ARP: they claimed that the left-wing, so called \\"evangelically radical\\", ideal of the ARP could not be realised in a cabinet with the VVD. In April, the group began to meet regularly with dissidents from the KVP in the Hotel Americain, this gave the group the name \\"American Group\\". The group included Wilhelm de Gaay Fortman, prominent ARP politician, his son Bas de Gaay Fortman, Jo Cals, former KVP prime minister, and Ruud Lubbers, member of the KVP and future prime minister. In May, the group became a formal organisation, the Working Group Christian Radicals, which was oriented at making their mother parties more progressive. They had some success in the KVP, which was seeking new allies and a new image, after it had lost the 1967 general election. In February 1968 the leaders of the KVP, Norbert Schmelzer, ARP, Barend Biesheuvel and CHU, Jur Mellema made a public appearance, stating that the three parties wanted to work together more closely. The co-operation would eventually lead to the formation of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) in 1974. With that appearance, the hopes of the Christian Radicals within the KVP that a progressive alliance with the Labour Party would be formed were shattered. ===1968‚Äì1977=== Poster for the 1974 elections showing the green nature of the party On 27 April 1968 part of the group of Catholic radicals left the KVP and formed the Political Party of Radicals (PRP). Prominent radicals, like Lubbers and Cals, did not join the party. A group of radical KVP MPs led by Jacques Aarden left the KVP parliamentary party and formed their own group-Aarden, the parliamentary party of the PPR. The party is joined by some prominent \\"regret-voters\\" from the ARP, most prominently Bas de Gaay Fortman. The party began to co-operate closely with the Labour Party (PvdA), the newly founded Democrats 66 (D66) and initially with the left-wing Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP) in the so-called Progressive Accords (PAK). The parties proposed common election manifestos and formed a shadow cabinet. The PSP left the alliance before the negotiations ended, because the alliance was not socialist enough. The PPR participated in the 1971 general election as part of the PAK. The PPR won only two seats, while the PAK wins only 52 seats, a third of parliament. Jacques Aarden led the party in parliament. Some prominent members left the PPR, because they think the party has failed. The Biesheuvel cabinet was formed by the ARP, KVP, CHU, VVD and the Democratic Socialists '70. In the 1972 general election the parties tried again. The PAK now won 56 seats and the PPR 7. Former ARP-politician Bas de Gaay Fortman led the party in the elections. A continuation of the Biesheuvel cabinet, which fell within one year is excluded. The only possibility is a centre-left government with the PAK parties and the Christian democratic parties. The PAK parties refuse this possibility and want to form a PAK minority cabinet. A compromise is found in the progressive Den Uyl cabinet, an extra-parliamentary cabinet composed out of PvdA, D66 and PPR and progressive individuals from the ARP and the KVP, including former Radicals such as Lubbers and Wilhelm de Gaay Fortman. The PPR supplied two ministers, Harry van Doorn Minister for Culture, Recreation and Social Work, and Boy Trip, Minister without Portfolio for Science and one state secretary, Michel van Hulten, for Transport, Public Works and Water Management. The fact that the PPR was co-operating with the ARP and KVP, which many members of the party had just left led to considerable upheaval within the party. The party congress adopted a resolution stating that the party would not co-operate with these parties in the next cabinet. ===1977‚Äì1989=== Poster for the 1986 elections showing party leader Ria Beckers in front of the 1983 anti-nuclear weapons demonstration Before the 1977 elections Bas de Gaay Fortman was replaced as political leader by Ria Beckers. The election results were especially disastrous: the party lost four seats: this is attributed to the political competition between PvdA Prime Minister Joop den Uyl and his Christian Democrat competitor Dries van Agt, which caused many PSP-sympathisers to vote for Den Uyl, and also the anti-KVP/ARP resolution adopted by the congress, which made serious participation in cabinet impossible. in 1979, following the first direct elections to the European Parliament, the PRP was involved with the Coordination of European Green and Radical Parties (CEGRP) and its unsuccessful efforts to create a single pan-European platform for green and radical politics. In the early 1980s the placement of American nuclear weapons became an important political issue. The PPR was involved in the organisation of national demonstrations against nuclear weapons and more than 80% of the members of the PPR attended one of the two mass protests against the placement nuclear weapons of 1981 and 1983.Lucardie P. et al. Verloren Illusie, Geslaagde Fusie? GroenLinks in Historisch and Politicologische Perspectief 1999, Leiden: DSWO-press; p.45 The party began to debate its political course: some members (known as the Godebald-group) wanted to continue co-operation with the PvdA. Many of the party's founders and former ministers, such as Erik Jurgens were part of this group. Others wanted to co-operate with the Pacifist Socialist Party and the Communist Party of the Netherlands. They were called the Wageningen Group. Another group wanted to reform the party's course and continue as an independent Green party: Bas de Gaay Fortman and former Provo and Kabouter Roel van Duijn were important exponents of this group. At the party congress of 1981 the party voted on these options, which were colour-coded: the Red option (cooperation with the PSP and CPN), the Blue option (co-operation with the D66 and the PvdA) and the Green option (independent green party). An alliance was struck between the Reds and Greens. The party decided to break its alliance with D66 and the PvdA and try to form an alliance with the PSP and CPN, which would have a strong green identity. In the 1981 general election it kept its three seats. After the elections a CDA/PvdA/D66 cabinet was formed ‚Äì a continuation of the Den Uyl cabinet without the PPR. The cabinet fell after several months in the subsequent 1982 election where the party lost one seat. In 1985 CDA-dissident Stef Dijkman joined the PPR parliamentary party. He had split from the CDA in 1983 together with Nico Sholten, who joined the PvdA parliamentary party. In the 1980s the cooperation between PPR, CPN and PSP began to take shape. The parties co-operated mainly in municipal and provincial elections and legislatures, because a higher percentage of votes is necessary to gain seats in such elections. In the 1984 European election the PPR, CPN and PSP formed the Green Progressive Accord that entered with one list in the European elections. They won one seat, which rotated between the PSP and PPR. Party-members also met each other in grassroots extraparliamentary protest against nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Both the PSP and CPN were unwilling to co-operate intensively with the PPR, which was slightly larger in seats and which they saw as a non- socialist party. ===After 1989=== In 1989 the PSP initiated talks with the PPR and the PSP. Their initiative was supported by an open letter from members of trade unions, environmental movements and the arts which called for one progressive formation to the left of the PvdA. After long negotiations, which were pressured by the fall of the second Lubbers cabinet and the subsequent earlier elections, the party entered in the 1989 general election as part of GreenLeft. They were joined by the Evangelical People's Party (EVP). Ria Beckers was top candidate and she became chair of the GreenLeft parliamentary party. In 1991 the PPR dissolved itself into GreenLeft when GreenLeft became a formal political party. In the same year, GreenLeft's only MEP, former PPR- chair, Verbeek announced that he would not give up his seat in the European Parliament, to allow a former member of the PSP to enter the European Parliament. He would continue as an independent and would be top candidate for The Greens in the 1994 European election, without success. The PPR left a considerable mark on GreenLeft. In particular the green, environmentalist ideals of the PPR still play an important role. ==Name== The name \\"Political Party of Radicals\\" referenced the origin of the party, it was founded by the so-called Christian Radicals: progressive Catholics. Because they wanted to open their party to all Christians as well as to non-Christians, the dropped the reference to Christianity in their name. ==Ideology and issues== The party did not have a manifesto of principles, instead election manifestos which addressed current issues guided the party's behaviour. Although the party had Christian roots, it denounced a direct relationship between religion and politics. The party can be seen as an early green party with a post- materialist agenda consisting of environmental protection, third world development, nuclear disarmament, democratisation of the economy and grass roots democracy. The party favoured the implementation of a basic income. During its existence the party changed from a Christian ally of the Labour Party (PvdA) with its roots in the Catholic trade union movement to a party on the left of the PvdA with links to the environmental movement. Several decisions were important in this, but especially the 1981 congress in which the party decided not to cooperate, but try to found a political alliance left of the PvdA with a green program. ==Representation== This table the PPR's results in elections to the House of Representatives, Senate, European Parliament and States-Provincial, as well as the party's political leadership: the fractievoorzitter, is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lijsttrekker is the party's top candidate in the general election, these posts are normally taken by the party's leader. It also possible that the leader of the PPR is a member of cabinet, therefore its participation in cabinets is also listed: if the PPR was in cabinet the highest ranking minister is listed. The membership of PPR and the party chair is also represented. { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" - bgcolor=\\"#cccccc\\" !Year ! HoR ! S ! EP !

In the 1970s it also cooperated in the North Holland provincial executive and in several local executives such as Amsterdam. In the following figure one can see the election results of the provincial election of 1982 per province. It shows that the support for the party was distributed equally throughout the country, with a slight tendency to the West (North, Utrecht and South Holland) and South (Brabant and Limburg). { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" - bgcolor=\\"#cccccc\\" !Province !Result (seats) - Groningen 1 - Friesland 1** - Drenthe 1** - Overijssel 1 - Gelderland 2 - Utrecht 1* - North Holland 2 - South Holland 2** - Zeeland 1 - North Brabant 1 - Limburg 2 } *: elected on combined PvdA/PPR lists (estimate). **: elected on combined PPR/CPN/PSP or PPR/PSP lists (estimate). ==Electorate== The PPRs electorate consisted of young, well educated voters, who often had a Catholic or Protestant background. The electorate was slightly more concentrated in the West (North, Utrecht and South Holland) and South (Brabant and Limburg). ==OrganisationOrganisational structure=== The highest organ of the PPR was the Congress. It convened once every year. It appointed the party board and decided the order of candidates on electoral lists for the House of Representatives, Senate and European Parliament and had the final say over the party program. ===Linked organisations=== The PPR published its own magazine which was called Radicals Paper (Dutch: Radikalenkrant) between 1968 and 1973 and 1982 and 1990 and PPR Action Paper (Dutch: PPR aktiekrant; PPRAK) between 1973 and 1981. The PPRs youth was organised in the Political Party of Radicals Youth (Dutch: Politieke Partij Radicalen Jeugd; PPRJ) In 1991 the PPRJ merged into DWARS GreenLeft youth. In the 1980s the scientific institute of the PPR cooperated strongly with the scientific institutes of the PSP and CPN. They published De Helling together since 1987. The Rode Draad was published since 1985 it was a magazine for municipal and provincial councillors of both the PSP, PPR and CPN. ===International cooperation=== Since 1979 the party cooperated with other Green and left-wing parties in organisations like Grael, which later became the European Green Party. ===Relationships to other parties=== Cooperation has been an important theme for the PPR as the party was founded as party of left-wing Christians who wanted to cooperate with the PvdA, which later became committed to forming a political alliance left of the PvdA. Between 1971 and 1977 the relations with PvdA and Democrats 66 were especially close. The three parties formed the core of the Den Uyl cabinet. After the elections of 1977, when the PPR lost a lot of seats, and 1981 when the PPR was excluded from the second Van Agt cabinet. The relations with the CPN and PSP started out badly, as the CPN and the PSP saw the party as a reformist, non-socialist party. After 1981 when the PPR had committed itself to extra-parliamentary protest the relations with the reforming CPN and PSP became better. In 1989 this resulted in the formation of the GreenLeft ==See also== *Rainbow (Netherlands) ==References== Category:Confessional parties in the Netherlands Category:Defunct Christian political parties Category:Defunct political parties in the Netherlands Category:Green political parties in the Netherlands Category:GroenLinks Category:Political parties established in 1968 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1991 Category:Catholic political parties Category:Progressive parties Category:Radical parties ","title":"Political Party of Radicals"},{"id":"2227231","text":"For the clothing style among some indigenous peoples in Panama, Puerto Rico and Costa Rica see Ng√§be people#Dress Nagua is the capital of Mar√≠a Trinidad S√°nchez province, in the northeastern Dominican Republic. A medium-sized town, Nagua's economy relies on the production of agricultural products, principally rice, coconuts, and cocoa bean. Located on the north of the Saman√° Peninsula, Nagua lies on the highway leading from Puerto Plata to the city of Saman√°. Most of the town lies below sea level, which some believe makes Nagua susceptible to flooding that could destroy a substantial part of the town. In fact, during the reign of Rafael Trujillo (1930‚Äì1961), the neighboring town of Matanza, also below sea level, was destroyed by flooding caused by a magnitude 8.0 earthquake, in 1946. Many residents of Matanza chose to resettle in the area that is now Nagua. Matanza is now a small town called Matancita, just south of the city limits of Nagua. ==ClimateNotables== *Baltimore Orioles pitcher Ubaldo Jim√©nez was born in Nagua. *Oakland Athletics pitcher Jordan Norberto was born in Nagua. *St. Louis Cardinals utilityman Yairo Mu√±oz was born in Nagua. *Cieguito de Nagua Bartolo Alvarado was a musician known for playing merengue and bachata. *Nolito de Nagua Chap was a musician known for playing Haitian music. *Tatico Henriquez which some consider to be the godfather of merengue tipico. == References == Category:Populated places in Mar√≠a Trinidad S√°nchez Province Category:Municipalities of the Dominican Republic ","title":"Nagua"},{"id":"2227242","text":"Eastern Orthodox cross July 15 - Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar - July 17 All fixed commemorations below are celebrated on July 29 by Old Calendar.

The goal of the project was to reduce overpopulation in the southern Gilbert Islands by developing three mostly uninhabited atolls in the Phoenix Islands archipelago: #Nikumaroro (Gardner) #Manra (Sydney) #Orona (Hull) A secondary goal was to enhance the British presence in the western Pacific in response to growing American influence through the Guano Islands Act, especially on Canton (later Kanton), where a commercial seaplane base was being established. The three atolls, Sydney, Hull and Gardner, were renamed in Gilbertese as Manra Island, Orona Atoll and Nikumaroro respectively. Colonisation efforts by Gilbertese settlers were almost immediately hampered by the onset of the Second World War, the islands' isolation and the 1941 death on Nikumaroro of the project's officer in charge, 29-year-old civil servant Gerald Gallagher. ==Abandonment== After 1945 the three settlements continued to struggle with supply problems, limited markets for copra, the settlements' only major product, and drought, until the British government determined the colony could not be self- sustaining and evacuated the settlers in 1963, ending the project. The Phoenix Islands are part of Kiribati and in 2005 were officially uninhabited except for a few families on Kanton Island (census population 61 in 2000 and 41 in 2005). == See also == * American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project == References Category:British colonisation of Oceania Category:History of Kiribati Category:1938 in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Category:Settlement schemes Category:Guano Islands Act Category:Phoenix Islands (Kiribati) Category:Gilbert and Ellice Islands ","title":"Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme"},{"id":"2227255","text":"Eastern Orthodox cross July 16 - Eastern Orthodox Church calendar - July 18 All fixed commemorations below are celebrated on July 30 by Old Calendar.

He was a member of the Whig administrations headed by Lord Grey and Lord Melbourne of the 1830s and also published works on financial and penal questions as well as on civil engineering. He was the great-uncle of Irish nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell. ==Background and education== Parnell was the second son of Sir John Parnell, 2nd Baronet, Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer, and Laetitia Charlotte, daughter of Sir Arthur Brooke, 1st Baronet. His younger brother William Parnell-Hayes was the grandfather of Charles Stewart Parnell. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1801 he inherited the family estates in Queen's County on the death of his father, bypassing his disabled elder brother according to a special Act of Parliament passed in 1789. In 1812 he succeeded as fourth Baronet, of Rathleague, on the death of his brother.thepeerage.com Henry Brooke Parnell, 1st Baron Congleton ==Political career== Parnell represented Maryborough in the Irish House of Commons from 1798 until the Act of Union in 1801. In April the following year he was elected to Parliament of the United Kingdom for Queen's County, but relinquished this seat already in July of the same year, when he was returned for Portarlington. However, he resigned the seat already in December 1802. In 1806 he was once again elected for Queen's County, and represented the constituency until 1832. In 1828 he was chairman of the Select Committee on the State of Public Income and Expenditure which successfully recommended abolition of the 280-year old Navy Board and the merging of its functions into the Board of Admiralty. It was Parnell's motion on the civil list that the Duke of Wellington's administration was defeated in 1830. The Whigs came to power under Lord Grey and in 1831 Parnell was admitted to the Privy Councilleighrayment.com Privy Counsellors 1679‚Äì1835 and appointed Secretary at War, a post he held until February 1833. He resigned his seat in Parliament the same year but returned in 1833 as the representative for Dundee. When the Whigs again came to power in April 1835 under Lord Melbourne, Parnell was made Paymaster of the Forces and Treasurer of the Ordnance and Navy. These offices were consolidated into that of Paymaster-General in 1836, and Parnell retained this post until the government fell in 1841. The latter year he was raised to the peerage as Baron Congleton, of Congleton in the County Palatine of Chester. ==Writings== Henry Parnell was also the author of several volumes and pamphlets on matters connected with financial questions, the most important being that On Financial Reform, published in 1830. Parnell was strongly opposed to the prevailing protectionist system and passionately believed in the retrenchment of public expenditure, especially on the armed services.Sidney Buxton, Finance and Politics: An Historical Study, 1783‚Äì1885. Volume I (London: John Murray, 1888), p. 32, n. ‚Ä°. In On Financial Reform, he advocated the repeal of taxes on raw materials and home manufactures, along with the reduction of import duties on foreign manufactures. He also favoured the reduction of taxes on \\"luxuries\\", such as tea, sugar, tobacco, wine and spirits. In order to pay for these reforms, Parnell proposed the reintroduction of the income tax. According to Sidney Buxton, On Financial Reform exercised a considerable influence on public opinion and \\"laid before the country the financial and fiscal policy that Peel and Gladstone afterwards carried through\\". He was one of the main representatives of the so-called \\"Free Banking School,\\" which argued that the best way to achieve monetary stability was to revoke the Bank of England's monopoly on the issue of banknotes. These ideas were defended by Parnell and others in opposition to those of the \\"Currency School\\" (which advocated legal restrictions on the amount of notes that could be issued, with respect to their deposits in specie) and the \\"Banking School,\\" which advocated discretionary policy by the banks in monetary matters. The influence of the \\"Free Banking School\\" declined significantly after Parnell's death in 1842, and the Bank Charter Act 1844 eliminated the right of new banks in England and Wales to issue notes, thus consolidating the Bank of England's monopoly, which Parnell had opposed.Anna J. Schwartz, \\"Banking School, Currency School, Free Banking School,\\" in The New Palgrave: Money (London, W. W. Norton & Company, 1989), . Parnell also wrote about penal matters. In the domain of civil engineering, he authored the 1833 and 1838 editions of \\"A Treatise on Roads ...\\" in which the works and techniques of Thomas Telford are described. ==Family== Lord Congleton married Lady Caroline Elizabeth, daughter of John Dawson, 1st Earl of Portarlington, in 1801. In 1842, having suffered for some time from ill-health and melancholy, he committed suicide by hanging, aged 65. He was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son John Vesey Parnell.

There are three main scenarios: *a cash bar (a.k.a. a no-host bar): Attendees pay for their own drinks. *a cash bar with tickets: The host issues vouchers to attendees for a limited number of free drinks, and attendees pay for any further drinks themselves. *a host bar (a.k.a. an open bar): The host pays for all drinks, either by the hour, by the bottle, by the drink, or per person. Choosing among the several options is influenced by several factors. One such factor is etiquette. Providing a cash bar at a function such as a wedding reception is generally considered poor etiquette in the United States. Another such factor is cost. A cash bar is the least expensive option for a host. However, there are alternatives between a cash bar and a fully open bar that can limit costs. The host can set a hard limit on cost, beyond which all beverages have to be paid for by attendees. The host can specify that specific beverages, such as a few selected types of wines and beers, are paid for by the host, and that attendees pay for all other types of drinks. The host can set a time limit for an open bar, beyond which it reverts to being a cash bar. Or more complex combinations of these can be employed. Some venues, such as hotels, subject to the terms of their liquor licenses, may allow attendees to bring their own alcoholic drinks to beverage functions. However, they may also charge attendees a fee, usually charged per bottle (either at a flat rate or as a percentage of the bottle's price), for doing so, known as corkage. Cash bars have their problems for caterers and venue managers. One major problem is the possibility of theft. To prevent this, managers can set up cashiers, who take money and issue drinks tickets, separate from the serving staff who actually serve drinks. Brown and Godsmark recommend to managers that they place only their most trustworthy staff in charge of the cash bars at banquets. Conversely, open bars have problems for hosts, in that they can result in an increased number of intoxicated, and potentially obnoxious and aggressive, attendees, as compared to other options. With open bars, the level of waste also increases (which is reflected in increased costs to the host). Since attendees do not pay for their drinks, they often do not consider them to be as valuable as they would if they had paid for them themselves. This results in drinks being abandoned or forgotten, or simply discarded by guests who leave their drinks (as they go and do something else) after only partly consuming them and then replace them with fresh ones rather than finishing the drinks that they already had. == Types of drinks served == The types of drinks served at functions can vary, according to the type of the event, and the types and ages of the attendees. In particular, at wedding receptions whether the bride and groom are themselves alcohol drinkers can affect whether attendees pay for their own alcoholic drinks, or indeed whether alcohol is offered at all. Similarly, alcohol is not served at beverage events for children. Another factor that affects whether alcohol is served is liability, for subsequent intoxication and anything that results from it. Many U.S. jurisdictions allow the victims of accidents to sue not only the person who was intoxicated, but also the person who served the alcohol, the person or company employing the bartender, and the board of directors of the company. == References  Further reading == * * Category:Drinking culture Category:Social events ","title":"Beverage function"},{"id":"2227311","text":"The first Golden Age of Science Fiction, often recognized in the United States as the period from 1938 to 1946,Nicholls, Peter (1981) The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Granada, p. 258 was an era during which the science fiction genre gained wide public attention and many classic science fiction stories were published. In the history of science fiction, the Golden Age follows the \\"pulp era\\" of the 1920s and 1930s, and precedes New Wave science fiction of the 1960s and 1970s. The 1950s are a transitional period in this scheme; however, Robert Silverberg, who came of age in the 1950s, saw that decade as the true Golden Age. According to historian Adam Roberts, \\"the phrase Golden Age valorises a particular sort of writing: 'Hard SF', linear narratives, heroes solving problems or countering threats in a space-opera or technological-adventure idiom.\\"Roberts, Adam The History of Science Fiction, p 195, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. ==From Gernsback to Campbell== One leading influence on the creation of the Golden Age was John W. Campbell, who became legendary in the genre as an editor and publisher of science fiction magazines, including Astounding Science Fiction, to such an extent that Isaac Asimov stated that \\"...in the 1940s, (Campbell) dominated the field to the point where to many seemed all of science fiction.\\"Asimov, Isaac (1989), The Mammoth Book of Golden Age Science Fiction, Carroll & Graf Published Inc., p.1 Under Campbell's editorship, science fiction developed more realism and psychological depth to characterization than it exhibited in the Gernsbackian \\"super science\\" era. The focus shifted from the gizmo itself to the characters using the gizmo. Most fans agree that the Golden Age began around 1938-39, slightly later than the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, another pulp-based genre. The July 1939 issue of Astounding Science Fiction is sometimes cited as the start of the Golden Age. It included \\"Black Destroyer\\", the first published story by A. E. van Vogt, and the first appearance of Isaac Asimov (\\"Trends\\") in the magazine. Science fiction writer John C. Wright said of Van Vogt's story, \\"This one started it all.\\" The August issue contained the first published story by Robert A. Heinlein (\\"Life-Line\\"). Robert Silverberg in a 2010 essay argued that the true Golden Age was the 1950s, saying that ‚ÄúGolden Age‚Äù of the 1940s was a kind of \\"false dawn\\". \\"Until the decade of the fifties\\", Silverberg wrote, \\"there was essentially no market for science fiction books at all\\"; the audience supported only a few special interest small presses. The 1950s saw \\"a spectacular outpouring of stories and novels that quickly surpassed both in quantity and quality the considerable achievement of the Campbellian golden age\\", as mainstream companies like Simon & Schuster and Doubleday displaced specialty publishers like Arkham House and Gnome Press. ==Developments in the genre== Many of the most enduring science fiction tropes were established in Golden Age literature. Space opera came to prominence with the works of E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith; Isaac Asimov established the canonical Three Laws of Robotics beginning with the 1941 short story \\"Runaround\\"; the same period saw the writing of genre classics such as the Asimov's Foundation and Smith's Lensman series. Another frequent characteristic of Golden Age science fiction is the celebration of scientific achievement and the sense of wonder; Asimov's short story \\"Nightfall\\" exemplifies this, as in a single night a planet's civilization is overwhelmed by the revelation of the vastness of the universe. Robert A. Heinlein's 1950s novels, such as The Puppet Masters, Double Star, and Starship Troopers, express the libertarian ideology that runs through much of Golden Age science fiction.Roberts, Adam The History of Science Fiction, pp. 196-203, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. Algis Budrys in 1965 wrote of the \\"recurrent strain in 'Golden Age' science fiction of the 1940s‚Äîthe implication that sheer technological accomplishment would solve all the problems, hooray, and that all the problems were what they seemed to be on the surface\\". The Golden Age also saw the re-emergence of the religious or spiritual themes--central to so much proto-science fiction before the pulp era--that Hugo Gernsback had tried to eliminate in his vision of \\"scientifiction\\". Among the most significant such Golden Age narratives are Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles, Clarke's Childhood's End, Blish's A Case of Conscience, and Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz.Roberts, Adam The History of Science Fiction, pp. 210-218, New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006. ==Cultural significance== As a phenomenon that affected the psyches of a great many adolescents during World War II and the ensuing Cold War, science fiction's Golden Age has left a lasting impression upon society. The beginning of the Golden Age coincided with the first Worldcon in 1939 and, especially for its most involved fans, science fiction was becoming a powerful social force. The genre, particularly during its Golden Age, had significant, if somewhat indirect, effects upon leaders in the military, information technology, Hollywood and science itself, especially biotechnology and the pharmaceutical industry. ==Prominent Golden Age authors== A number of influential science fiction authors emerged in the early Golden Age (1938‚Äì1946), including the following: * Isaac Asimov (1920‚Äì1992) * Alfred Bester (1913‚Äì1987) * James Blish (1921‚Äì1975) * Nelson S. Bond (1908‚Äì2006) * Leigh Brackett (1915‚Äì1978) * Ray Bradbury (1920‚Äì2012) * Fredric Brown (1906‚Äì1972) * A. Bertram Chandler (1912‚Äì1984) * John Christopher (1922‚Äì2012) * Hal Clement (1922‚Äì2003) * L. Sprague de Camp (1907‚Äì2000) * Lester del Rey (1915‚Äì1992) * Robert A. Heinlein (1907‚Äì1988) * L. Ron Hubbard (1911‚Äì1986) * Henry Kuttner (1915‚Äì1958) * Fritz Leiber (1910‚Äì1992) * Murray Leinster (1896‚Äì1975) * C. L. Moore (1911‚Äì1987) * Frederik Pohl (1919‚Äì2013) * Ross Rocklynne (1913‚Äì1988) * Eric Frank Russell (1905‚Äì1978) * Clifford D. Simak (1904‚Äì1988) * E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith (1890‚Äì1965) * Theodore Sturgeon (1918‚Äì1985) * William Tenn (1920‚Äì2010) * A. E. van Vogt (1912‚Äì2000) * Jack Vance (1916‚Äì2013) * Jack Williamson (1908‚Äì2006) * John Wyndham (1903‚Äì1969) and in the later Golden Age (1947‚Äì1959): * Arthur C. Clarke (1917‚Äì2008) * Poul Anderson (1926‚Äì2001) * Philip K. Dick (1928‚Äì1982) * James Gunn (1923‚Äì) * C. M. Kornbluth (1923‚Äì1958) * Walter M. Miller, Jr. (1923‚Äì1996) * Chad Oliver (1928‚Äì1993) ==End of the Golden Age== Asimov said that \\"The dropping of the atom bomb in 1945 made science fiction respectable\\" to the general public. He recalled in 1969 \\"I'll never forget the shock that rumbled through the entire world of science fiction fandom when ... Heinlein broke the 'slicks' barrier by having an undiluted science fiction story of his published in The Saturday Evening Post\\". The large, mainstream companies' entry into the science fiction book market around 1950 was similar to how they published crime fiction during World War II; authors no longer could only publish through magazines. Asimov said, however, that He continued, \\"In fact, there was the birth of something I called 'tomorrow fiction'; the science fiction story that was no more new than tomorrow's headlines. Believe me, there can be nothing duller than tomorrow's headlines in science fiction\\", citing Nevil Shute's On the Beach as example. It is harder to specify the end of the Golden Age of Science Fiction than its beginning, but several factors changed the market for magazine science fiction in the mid- and late 1950s. Most important was the rapid contraction of the pulp market: Fantastic Adventures and Famous Fantastic Mysteries folded in 1953, Planet Stories, Startling Stories, Thrilling Wonder Stories and Beyond in 1955, Other Worlds and Science Fiction Quarterly in 1957, Imagination, Imaginative Tales, and Infinity in 1958. In October 1957, the successful launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 narrowed the gap between the real world and the world of science fiction, sending the West into a space race with the East. Asimov shifted to writing nonfiction he hoped would attract young minds to science, while Robert A. Heinlein became more dogmatic in expressing political and social views in his fiction. Emerging British writers, such as Brian W. Aldiss and J. G. Ballard, cultivated a more literary style, indicating the direction other writers would soon pursue. Women writers, such as Joanna Russ and Judith Merril, emerged. When the leading Golden Age magazine, Astounding Stories of Super-Science, changed its title to Analog Science Fiction and Fact in 1960, it was clear the Golden Age of Science Fiction was over. ==References * Fear of Fiction: Campbell's World and Other Obsolete Paradigms, at Infinity Plus, by Claude Lalumi√®re * 'John W.

From 1848 he had been a member of the Bavarian second chamber, at first representing the district of Erlangen-F√ºrth, and afterwards Nuremberg, which city also sent him after the war of 1866 as its deputy to the German customs parliament, and from 1871 to 1874 to the first German Reichstag.

He arrived in the UK in 1969. He was the founding Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain (established 1997), and served four further years as Secretary General from 2002 to 2004 and 2004 to 2006. He was honoured with an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1999, and was Knighted by the Queen in 2005. During the controversy on Salman Rushdie, shortly after the fatwa by Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini for his book The Satanic Verses, Sacranie stated: \\"Death, perhaps, is a bit too easy for him his mind must be tormented for the rest of his life unless he asks for forgiveness to Almighty Allah.\\" Sacranie states that this quotation was misinterpreted and that he merely wanted to convince Muslims that they should not kill Rushdie. On 3 January 2006 Sacranie told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he believes homosexuality is \\"not acceptable\\", and denounced same-sex civil partnerships as \\"harmful\\". He said that bringing in gay marriage did \\"not augur well\\" for building the foundations of society.

Consequently, they use organic compounds from the environment to satisfy their carbon requirements; these compounds include carbohydrates, fatty acids, and alcohols. Examples of photoheterotrophic organisms include purple non-sulfur bacteria, green non-sulfur bacteria, and heliobacteria. Recent research has indicated that the oriental hornet and some aphids may be able to use light to supplement their energy supply. == Research == Studies have shown that mammalian mitochondria can also capture light and synthesize ATP when mixed with a light-capturing metabolite of chlorophyll. A research demonstrated that the same metabolite when fed to the worm Caenorhabditis elegans leads to increase in ATP synthesis upon light exposure, along with an increase in life span. ==Metabolism== Photoheterotrophs generate ATP using light, in one of two ways: they use a bacteriochlorophyll-based reaction center, or they use a bacteriorhodopsin. The chlorophyll-based mechanism is similar to that used in photosynthesis, where light excites the molecules in a reaction center and causes a flow of electrons through an electron transport chain (ETS). This flow of electrons through the proteins causes hydrogen ions to be pumped across a membrane. The energy stored in this proton gradient is used to drive ATP synthesis. Unlike in photoautotrophs, the electrons flow only in a cyclic pathway: electrons released from the reaction center flow through the ETS and return to the reaction center. They are not utilized to reduce any organic compounds. Purple non-sulfur bacteria, green non-sulfur bacteria, and heliobacteria are examples of bacteria that carry out this scheme of photoheterotrophy. Other organisms, including halobacteria and flavobacteria and vibrios have purple-rhodopsin-based proton pumps that supplement their energy supply. The archaeal version is called bacteriorhodopsin, while the eubacterial version is called proteorhodopsin. The pump consists of a single protein bound to a Vitamin A derivative, retinal. The pump may have accessory pigments (e.g., carotenoids) associated with the protein. When light is absorbed by the retinal molecule, the molecule isomerises. This drives the protein to change shape and pump a proton across the membrane. The hydrogen ion gradient can then be used to generate ATP, transport solutes across the membrane, or drive a flagellar motor. One particular flavobacterium cannot reduce carbon dioxide using light, but uses the energy from its rhodopsin system to fix carbon dioxide through anaplerotic fixation. The flavobacterium is still a heterotroph as it needs reduced carbon compounds to live and cannot subsist on only light and CO2. It cannot carry out reactions in the form of :n CO2 \\\\+ 2n H2D + photons ‚Üí (CH2O)n \\\\+ 2n D + n H2O, where H2D may be water, H2S or another compound/compounds providing the reducing electrons and protons; the 2D + H2O pair represents an oxidized form. However, it can fix carbon in reactions like: :CO2 \\\\+ pyruvate + ATP (from photons) ‚Üí malate + ADP +Pi where malate or other useful molecules are otherwise obtained by breaking down other compounds by :carbohydrate + O2 ‚Üí malate + CO2 \\\\+ energy.

Pools and streams in wet heathland sites are favoured. wet heathland sites are favoured. ==Description== Orthetrum coerulescens can reach a body length of . These dragonflies have a thorax with pale yellow ante-humeral stripes. In the males the color of these stripes fades with age. The abdomen is rather slim and shows an evident dorsal keel. Males have blue-grey eyes and a blue pruinescence on the abdomen, developed with age. Young males are yellow-brown. On the contrary some (androchrome) females at the end of the reproductive cycle assume the bluish color of the male. In the female the abdomen is yellowish-brown, with a thin median black line and small transverse lines to the connections of the various segments. The hyaline wings have yellow costa and a long yellow-brown pterostigma (about 4 mm). They are usually hold well forward at rest. This species resembles the black-tailed skimmer but is smaller and slimmer and the male has no black tip. Females and immature males lack the black abdominal pattern.

Its flight is quite skittish, with frequent hovering, and it lands often. It can fly quite a distance from water, despite its seemingly weak flight. When it perches, the wings are held forward. This species breed mainly in peat bogs. The mating lasts between 5 and 120 seconds. The mating wheel usually lands, but not always. After copulation and a short rest period on the side of the male, the female flies, followed by the male to the water and lays the eggs in flight by touching the surface of the water. The larvae develop in running water but also in stagnant waters (ponds, peat bogs, etc.). After five to six weeks, the larvae hatch. Their development cycle is estimated in two years. ==See also== * List of British dragonflies == Bibliography== * Robert, Paul-A.

The party took part in several elections in Poland and Lithuania in the 1920s and 1930s and did not survive the Holocaust. ==Ideology== According to the historian Simon Dubnow (1860-1941), Jews are a nation on the spiritual and intellectual level and should strive towards their national and cultural autonomy in the Jewish diaspora (Yiddish gales) in some way a secularized and modernized version of the Council of Four Lands under the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth.Henry Abramson, The end of intimate insularity: new narratives of Jewish history in the post-Soviet era, in Acts of Symposium ‚ÄúConstruction and Deconstruction of National Histories in Slavic Eurasia,‚Äù at Sapporo, Japan, on July 10‚Äì13, 2002 He said, \\"How then should Jewish autonomy assert itself? It must, of course, be in full agreement with the character of the Jewish national idea. Jewry, as a spiritual or cultural nation, cannot in the Diaspora seek territorial or political separatism, but only a social or a national-cultural autonomy.\\"Koppel S. Pinson, Simon Dubnow, Nationalism and History, The Jewish Publication Society of America, Philadelphia, 1958 Close to the General Jewish Labour Bund for the emphasis on Yiddish and its culture, it differed from that party by its middle class, craftsmen and intellectual base, but also because of its ideological options. According to Dubnov, Jewish assimilation was not a natural phenomenon and the Jewish political struggle should be centered on a Jewish autonomy based upon community, language and education, and not upon class struggle as advocated by Bundist theorists. It was a liberal party in economic matters, committed to political democracy and secularism. Annette Wieviorka, \\"Les Juifs de Varsovie √† la veille de la Seconde Guerre mondiale\\", in Les Cahiers de la Shoah n¬∞ 1, 1994 ==Folkspartei in Ukraine== The Folkist Ya'akov Ze'ev Latsky (\\"Bertoldi\\") (former member of the Zionist Socialist Workers Party) was appointed Minister for Jewish Affairs in the Ukrainian People's Republic in April 1918, replacing Fareynikte Moishe Zilberfarb. He was succeeded by Abraham Revutzky of Poale Zion. ==Folkspartei in Poland== A local organization and a newspaper, Warszawer Togblat (The Warsaw Daily), was set up in Warsaw in 1916 in order to contend for the municipal elections (under German occupation), where they gained 4 seats, including Noach Pry≈Çucki, one of the founders of the party's newspaper, later renamed as 'Der Moment'. He was also elected at the 1919 Constituent Sejm, but had to resign for a citizenship matter. In the 1922-27 Polish Parliament (Sejm) Noach Pry≈Çucki was the only Folkist MP out of 35 Jewish MPs (25 Zionists, but no Bundist). He was elected on the list of the Bloc of National Minorities. The party split in 1927 between the Warsaw branch, led by Pry≈Çucki, and the Vilnius (then a part of Poland) branch, led by Dr. Zemach Shabad, less hostile to Zionism than the Warsaw branch but more Yiddish-centered. After the split the party seems to have declined, with an attempt to revitalize it in Warsaw in 1935. At the 1936 Jewish community elections in Warsaw, the Folkspartei only got 1 seat out of 50, while the Bund got 15. ==Folkspartei in Lithuania== Lawyer and banker Shmuel Landau (also spelled Landoi), later municipal councillor in PonevezhJoseph Rosin, Panevezys (Ponevezh) (Lit. Panevƒó≈æys), was elected (or rather succeeded elected MP Naphtali Friedman, a nonpartisan lawyer, after his death) for the Folkspartei on a common Jewish electoral list (with the Zionist parties and Agudat Israel) at the first elected Lithuanian Parliament (Seimas) in 1920 when there were 6 Jewish parties deputies out of 112. Vilnius (Yiddish Vilne), where Jews formed the majority of the population, was incorporated into Poland in 1922-1939, and also sent at least one Folkist to the Polish Parliament (Sejm), Zemach Shabad (Szabad)(1864-1935). The next elections (1922) were rigged against the Polish and Jewish minorities, but the Seimas was dissolved and another Folkist, the lawyer Oizer Finkelstein (also spelled Euser), was elected in 1923 on a national minorities bloc. In 1926, a coup d'√©tat took place in Lithuania and the parliament was dissolved in 1927. The Folkist newspaper in interwar Lithuania was the Folksblat, published in Kaunas. == See also == * Jewish Autonomism * National personal autonomy * Benno Straucher == Sources == *C.

On 22 July 1987, while outside the London offices of al-Qabas, a Kuwaiti newspaper for which he drew political caricatures,Harlow, 1994, p. 167. al-Ali was shot in the neck and mortally wounded.Black, Ian, (10 March 2008) \\"Drawing Defiance\\" The Guardian. Naji al-Ali died five weeks later in Charing Cross Hospital. ==Early life== Naji al-Ali was born in 1938 or thereabouts in the northern Palestinian village of Al-Shajara, located between Tiberias and Nazareth, which is currently moshav Ilaniya. He lived as an exile in the south of Lebanon with his family after the 1948 Palestinian exodus, the Nakba, and lived in Ain al-Hilweh refugee camp near Sidon,Harlow, 1994, p. 168. where he attended the Union of Christian Churches school. After graduation, he worked in the orchards of Sidon, then moved to Tripoli where he attended the White Friars' vocational school for two years. Naji al-Ali then moved to Beirut, where he lived in a tent in Shatila refugee camp and worked in various industrial jobs. In 1957, after qualifying as a car mechanic, he travelled to Saudi Arabia, where he worked for two years. ==Career as a cartoonist and journalist== In 1959 Naji al-Ali returned to Lebanon, and that year he joined the Arab Nationalist Movement (ANM), but was expelled four times within one year for lack of party discipline. Between 1960 and 1961, along with comrades from the ANM, he published a handwritten political journal Al-Sarkha ('the scream'). In 1960, he entered the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts, but was unable to continue his studies there as he was imprisoned for political reasons soon afterwards. After his release he moved to Tyre, where he worked as a drawing instructor in the Ja'fariya College. The writer and political activist Ghassan Kanafani saw some of Naji al-Ali's cartoons on a visit to Ain al-Hilweh and printed the artist's first published drawings along with an accompanying article in Al-Hurriya no. 88 on 25 September 1961. In 1963 Naji al-Ali moved to Kuwait, hoping to save money to study art in Cairo or Rome. There he worked as an editor, cartoonist, designer and newspaper producer on the Arab nationalist Al-Tali'a newspaper. From 1968 on he worked for Al-Siyasa. In the course of these years he returned to Lebanon several times. In 1974 he started working for the Lebanese newspaper Al-Safir, which permitted him to return to Lebanon for a longer period. During the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, he was briefly detained by the occupying forces along with other residents of Ain al-Hilweh. In 1983 he once more moved to Kuwait to work for Al-Qabas and in 1985 moved to London where he worked for its international edition until his death. In 1984 he was described by The Guardian as \\"the nearest thing there is to an Arab public opinion\\".Haifaa Khalafallah, 'Third World Review: This pen is mightier... Profile of Naji al- Ali, Arab cartoonist', The Guardian, September 21, 1984. ==Work, positions and awards== In his career as a political cartoonist, Naji al-Ali produced over 40,000 drawings. They generally deal with the situation of the Palestinian people, depicting suffering and resistance and harshly criticizing the Israeli state and illegal Israeli occupation, Palestinian leadership, and the Arab regimes. Naji al-Ali was a fierce opponent of any settlement that would not vindicate the Palestinian people's right to all of historic Palestine, and many of his cartoons express this position. Unlike many political cartoonists, specific politicians do not appear in person in his work: as he stated, \\"... I have a class outlook, that is why my cartoons take this form. What is important is drawing situations and realities, not drawing presidents and leaders.\\" Naji al-Ali published three books of his cartoons, in 1976, 1983 and 1985, and was preparing another at the time of his death. In 1979, Naji al-Ali was elected president of the League of Arab Cartoonists. In 1979 and 1980, he received the first prize in the Arab cartoonists exhibitions held in Damascus. The International Federation of Newspaper Publishers awarded him the \\"Golden Pen of Freedom\\" posthumously in 1988.'Murdered Arab cartoonist honoured', The Guardian, February 8, 1988. ==Handala== Handala, the Palestinian defiance symbol Handala, also known as Handhala (), is the most famous of Naji al-Ali's characters. He is depicted as a ten-year-old boy, and appeared for the first time in Al-Siyasa in Kuwait in 1969. The figure turned his back to the viewer from the year 1973, and clasped his hands behind his back. The artist explained that the ten-year-old represented his age when forced to leave Palestine and would not grow up until he could return to his homeland; his turned back and clasped hands symbolised the character's rejection of \\"outside solutions\\". Handala wears ragged clothes and is barefoot, symbolising his allegiance to the poor. In later cartoons, he is actively participating in the action depicted not merely observing it. Handala became the signature of Naji al-Ali's cartoons and remains an iconic symbol of Palestinian identity and defiance. Handala has also been used as the web mascot of the Iranian green movement. The artist remarked that \\"He was the arrow of the compass, pointing steadily towards Palestine. Not just Palestine in geographical terms, but Palestine in its humanitarian sense‚Äîthe symbol of a just cause, whether it is located in Egypt, Vietnam or South Africa.\\" ==Other characters and motifs== Other characters in Naji al-Ali's cartoons include a thin, miserable-looking man representing the Palestinian as the defiant victim of Israeli oppression and other hostile forces, and a fat man representing the Arab regimes and Palestinian political leaders who led an easy life and engaged in political compromises which the artist fervently opposed. The motifs of the Crucifixion (representing Palestinian suffering) and stone-throwing (representing the resistance of ordinary Palestinians) are also common in his work. ==Assassination== It is still not known who opened fire on Naji al-Ali outside the London office of Kuwaiti newspaper Al Qabas in Ives Street on 22 July 1987, hitting him in the right temple. Naji al-Ali was subsequently taken to hospital and remained in coma until his death on 29 August 1987. Although his will requested that he be buried in Ain al-Hilweh beside his father, this proved impossible to arrange and he was buried in Brookwood Islamic Cemetery outside London. British police arrested Ismail Sowan, a 28-year-old Jerusalem- born Palestinian researcher at Hull University, and found a cache of weapons in his apartment that they said were intended for terrorist attacks around Europe; he was only charged with possession of weapons and explosives. Initially, police said Sowan was a member of the PLO, though that organisation denied any involvement.David Pallister, 'Arab on arms find charge', The Guardian, August 18, 1987. Sowan later confessed that he worked for both the PLO and the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad.Clines, Francis (18 June 1988) \\"Britain Orders Israeli Diplomat to Leave.\\" The New York Times. Retrieved on 31 August 2010. A second suspect arrested by Scotland Yard also said he was a double agent. It was later revealed that Mossad had two double agents working in London-based PLO hit teams and had advance knowledge of the killing. By refusing to pass on the relevant information to their British counterparts, Mossad earned the displeasure of Britain, which retaliated by expelling three Israeli diplomats, one of whom was the embassy attache identified as the handler for the two agents. A furious Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister, closed Mossad‚Äôs London base in Palace Green, Kensington.Gardham, Duncan (17 February 2010) \\"Dubai Hamas assassination: the sticky relationship\\" The Daily TelegraphThe Daily Telegraph, London, April 5, 1998 The gun used in the murder, a 7.62 Tokarev pistol, was found on the Hallfield Estate in Paddington by police, on 22 April 1989. Force 17, acting under orders from Yasser Arafat, has also been claimed to be responsible for his assassination. In August 2017, detectives relaunched an investigation into his murder case, 30 years after his death. ===Commemorative statue=== Naji statue when it was first erected (right), exploded and damaged, and then re-erected A statue of Naji al-Ali by the sculptor Charbel Faris was erected at the northern entrance of Ain al- Hilweh camp, where Naji was raised for most of his youth years. Work on the fiberglass and colored polyester statue (with a steel inner support) took around five months. When finished, it was tall, with an average width of , and average thickness of . The statue holds a rock in its right hand and a booklet of drawings in the left hand. Shortly after being completed, the statue was damaged in an explosion caused by unknown assailants; like al-Ali the statue was shot in the left eye. The statue was repaired and re-erected. ==Media== A movie was made about the life of Naji al-Ali in Egypt, with the Egyptian actor Nour El-Sherif playing the lead role.El-Taieb, Atef, director.

After a playing career as a midfielder including for several Serie A clubs, he began managing in the lower leagues, and took Ternana to consecutive promotions into Serie B. He then spent four years at Chievo, helping the Verona neighbourhood club into Serie A for the first time and 5th place and UEFA Cup qualification in their first season at the top. Delneri left Chievo in 2004 for UEFA Champions League holders Porto, but was dismissed within weeks and before a competitive game. He subsequently managed several Serie A clubs in the following years, including one season with Juventus after taking Sampdoria to fourth place in 2010. ==Playing career== Born at Aquileia, Udine, Delneri made his professional debut as player at the age of 16 for SPAL, Ferrara's football team, for which he had worked as storer. After playing for Foggia and Novara, he moved to Udinese, with whom he gained promotion to Serie A, Italy's top division. He was later traded to Sampdoria and then to Vicenza, Siena, Pro Gorizia and Opitergina, an amateur team from Oderzo, where he ended his playing career at 34. ==Coaching careerEarly career / Chievo=== After his retirement as a player, Delneri stayed at Oderzo, appointed by chairman Ettore Setten (now owner of Treviso) as head coach. In 1986, he signed for Serie D team Pro Gorizia. He then coached Partinicaudace, a minor Sicilian Serie D team, in 1989, Teramo, Ravenna, Novara and Nocerina of Serie C2; with this last team he won the league and promotion to Serie C1. He then moved to Ternana of Serie C2, guiding it to Serie B after two consecutive promotions. In 1998, after his second consecutive promotion, Delneri was signed by Serie A's Empoli, but was fired before starting the championship and was subsequently recalled by his former team Ternana in Serie B. In 2000, Delneri signed with Chievo of Serie B, a team representing a small quarter of the city of Verona. It was the beginning of the so-called \\"Chievo miracle\\" in which the team was promoted for the very first time to Serie A, where they topped the league for the first half of the season and then qualified for the UEFA Cup by coming 5th. ===Porto, Roma and Palermo=== In June 2004, Delneri signed a three-year contract to succeed Jos√© Mourinho at UEFA Champions League holders Porto. He was sacked on 7 August, without even managing a competitive game, allegedly for missing training sessions. Delneri became Roma's third manager of the season in October 2004, after Cesare Prandelli and Rudi V√∂ller. His team failed to advance from their Champions League group, and he dropped young forward Antonio Cassano after a dispute. He resigned from his two-year contract in March 2005, with the team in 7th, and handed the job over to Bruno Conti. In June 2005, Delneri signed for Palermo, succeeding Francesco Guidolin who had quit for new challenges after qualifying them for the 2005‚Äì06 UEFA Cup. He was fired on 28 January 2006 with the team in 10th after a 3‚Äì1 home loss to Siena, having taken them into the knockout stages of the UEFA Cup. ===Chievo return, Atalanta and Sampdoria=== Delneri as Sampdoria manager in 2009 On 16 October 2006, Delneri returned to coach Chievo, replacing Giuseppe Pillon at the 15th-place club. Despite a strong start, he did not manage to save his side from relegation, losing a spot in the following season's Serie A with a 2‚Äì0 loss to Catania on the final matchday. Following the relegation, Delneri was announced as new Atalanta boss in June 2007. He led the team from Bergamo to 9th and 11th place in his two seasons; he announced in April 2009 that he would leave at the end of the season. Delneri left to take over at Sampdoria on 1 June 2009, a team that had just finished 13th. He guided Sampdoria to a surprising fourth-place finish, and a spot to the third qualifying round of the 2010‚Äì11 UEFA Champions League, leaving the next day. ===Juventus=== On 19 May 2010, two days after leaving Sampdoria, Delneri was appointed as coach of Juventus. At the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season, having finished 7th and not qualified for Europe, Delneri was sacked by the Juventus board of directors. ===Later career=== On 22 October 2012, Delneri was named new head coach of tenth-place Genoa in Serie A, succeeding sacked coach Luigi De Canio at Sampdoria's rivals. On 20 January 2013, however, Delneri was himself sacked following a 0‚Äì2 home loss to Catania and a string of bad results for the team, which recorded only two wins in his 13 matches with the club. Delneri was hired at another of his former club's rivals, this time Chievo's adversaries Hellas Verona, replacing Andrea Mandorlini on 1 December 2015; the team had not won once all season. He left by mutual consent after the season ended in relegation for the club on 23 May 2016. On 3 October 2016, Delneri signed a one-year deal with the option of a second at Udinese, succeeding Giuseppe Iachini who had won two of seven games. He finished the campaign in 13th, earning a second year, but took 12 points from the first 12 games and lost his job on 21 November 2017 when three points above the relegation places. On 4 September 2020, Delneri was officially appointed manager of Brescia, following their relegation to Serie B. On 6 October 2020, after one draw and one loss, positioned in last place, Delneri was sacked. ==Style of management== As a manager, Delneri is known for using a spectacular, offensive-minded style of football, which is heavily influenced by Arrigo Sacchi's tactics at Milan, as well as Dutch total football. His teams are known for their work-rate, strength, heavy running, and aggressive use of pressing when defending off the ball, while they are known for their movement off the ball, ability to change positions, and make overlapping runs when attacking. A tactically intelligent manager, his preferred formation is the 4‚Äì4‚Äì2, which relies on a high defensive line, although he has also been known to adopt other systems which better suit the characteristics of his players, including the 4‚Äì3‚Äì3. ==Managerial statistics== http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/ital05.htmlhttp://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/italcup05.htmlhttp://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/ital06.htmlhttp://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/italcup07.htmlhttp://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/italcup08.htmlhttp://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/italcup09.html {  style=\\"text-align: center\\" + Managerial record by team and tenure - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Team !rowspan=\\"2\\"From !rowspan=\\"2\\"To !colspan=\\"5\\"Record - ! ! ! ! ! - Teramo 1 July 1990 1 July 1991 - Ravenna 1 July 1991 1 July 1992 - Novara 1 July 1992 1 July 1994 - Nocerina 24 October 1994 1 July 1996 - Ternana 1 July 1996 1 July 1998 - Empoli 1 July 1998 1 September 1998 - Ternana 6 November 1998 25 January 1999 - Chievo 1 July 2000 4 June 2004 - Porto 4 June 2004 7 August 2004 - Roma 29 September 2004 13 March 2005 - Palermo 1 July 2005 29 January 2006 - Chievo 16 October 2006 30 June 2007 - Atalanta 1 July 2007 30 June 2009 - Sampdoria 1 June 2009 17 May 2010 - Juventus 19 May 2010 23 May 2011 - Genoa 22 October 2012 20 January 2013 - Hellas Verona 1 December 2015 23 May 2016 - Udinese 4 October 2016 21 November 2017 - Brescia 4 September 2020 Present - !colspan=\\"3\\"Total } ==HonoursCoach=== ;Individual *Serie A Coach of the Year (1): 2001‚Äì02 *Panchina d'Oro (1): 2001‚Äì02 ==References Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Aquileia Category:Association football midfielders Category:Italian footballers Category:Italian football managers Category:Calcio Foggia 1920 S.S.D. players Category:Udinese Calcio players Category:U.C.

The auditorium was named in honor of Arthur Hill (1847-1909), who served as a regent of the university from 1901 to 1909. He bequeathed $200,000 to the university for the construction of a venue for lectures, musical performances, and other large productions. Opened in 1913, the auditorium was designed by Albert Kahn and Associates. It was recently renovated by the same firm beginning in 2002 and was re-opened in 2004. With seating for up to 3,538 (originally 4,100 prior to the 2004 renovation) audience members, Hill is one of the most popular venues for large productions on campus. The building routinely hosts performances given by the Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra and the School of Music's various ensembles, including the University of Michigan Symphony Orchestra, University of Michigan Philharmonia Orchestra, University of Michigan Concert Band, University of Michigan Symphony Band, and University of Michigan Choirs, as well as the mostly non- major ensembles such as the University of Michigan Arts Chorale, the Campus Symphony Orchestra, Campus Bands, the Michigan Marching Band, and the Men's Glee Club and Women's Glee Club. The auditorium is also host to the Detroit Catholic Central High School and Father Gabriel Richard Ann Arbor graduation each May. Hill Auditorium shown in winter. Hill Auditorium's acoustics have been widely praised. The University of Michigan website that describes the recent $33.5 million Hill Auditorium refurbishing and restoration states: \\"When it opened in 1913, Hill Auditorium was hailed as a 'monument to perfect acoustics.' The excellent acoustics, a result of collaboration by architect Albert Kahn with noted acoustical engineer Hugh Tallant, are known world-wide and have made the auditorium a favorite venue for legions of famous musicians and other artists, as well as numerous noted speakers.\\" \\"Careful attention will be given throughout the renovation to maintaining the acoustic quality of Hill, said Henry Baier, associate vice president for facilities and operations. In addition, further work will be done to reduce street and lobby noise by building a ‚Äúsound lock‚Äù between the lobby and the auditorium.\\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070315073348/http://www.umich.edu/~urel/hill/pr.html Michigan's University Musical Society presents performances of many world- renowned artists at Hill Auditorium. The hall's unique oval-shaped stage has seen performances by Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, the Denishawn Dance Company, the Vienna Philharmonic,the Berlin Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony, the Chicago Symphony, the Cleveland Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Leningrad Philharmonic, the Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia, the Lahti Symphony Orchestra, Jan Kubelik, Jascha Heifetz, Fritz Kreisler, Carl Flesch, Eugene Ysaye, Efrem Zimbalist, Myra Hess, Ravi Shankar, Anne Sofie von Otter, Audra McDonald, the Kremerata Baltica, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Emilia Parks Butryn, the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, Enrico Caruso, Joan Sutherland, Robert Frost, Jessye Norman, Van Cliburn, Yo-Yo Ma, Vladimir Horowitz, Helen Hayes, Cecilia Bartoli, Eugene Ormandy, Leonard Bernstein, Isaac Stern, Benny Goodman, Harry Chapin, Dave Brubeck, Jack DeJohnette, the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, Alexander Frey, Louis Lortie, the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra, Wynton Marsalis, George Winston, Elton John, the Grateful Dead, Brandi Carlile, Rufus Wainwright, I'm With Her, and Lupe Fiasco among others. ==Design concept== An interior view of Hill Auditorium is shown. Carol Rose Kahn, the architect‚Äôs granddaughter recounted that her grandfather had set out to develop a hall with perfect acoustics. The brief was to design an auditorium that would seat five thousand people, where they could hear from every seat. The only known previous example was the Mormon Tabernacle where, it was said that one could hear a pin drop from the stage to the top balcony, although the chamber suffered from excess reverberation. Being aware that only one man in the country who was pre- eminent at that time - Hugh Tallant, partner of Henry Beaumont Herts - Kahn wrote to ask him if it would be possible to build an auditorium for five thousand people, where they'd hear from every seat. Tallant responded, but only after several months had elapsed, to the affirmative; so Tallant designed the acoustics. The result was an auditorium in the shape of a megaphone. The granddaughter said: \\"Hill Auditorium was nearly finished when I was fourteen or so. My father and I went out to Ann Arbor. Father stood up in the last seat of the second balcony, and I went down on the stage. On my word of honor, I dropped a pin and he heard it.\\" ==See also== *List of concert halls ==References *Grateful Dead Concert December 14, 1971 *Hill Auditorium renovation *UM School of Music - Hill Auditorium Category:University of Michigan campus Category:Performing arts centers in Michigan Category:Albert Kahn (architect) buildings Category:Music venues completed in 1913 Category:Tourist attractions in Ann Arbor, Michigan Category:1913 establishments in Michigan Category:Concert halls in Michigan ","title":"Hill Auditorium"},{"id":"2227455","text":"William Rankine Milligan, Lord Milligan, (12 December 1898 ‚Äì 28 July 1975) was a Scottish judge and Unionist politician.

The band had released three albums (Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over, and Love Gun) since the previous live outing, the 1975 release Alive!, so they drew upon the variety of new tracks, with Eddie Kramer producing. ==Album information== The origins of Alive II go back to early 1977 when the band's manager Bill Aucoin suggested that Kramer record a live album during the evening show at Budokan Hall in Tokyo, Japan on April 2, 1977. The plan was to release a live album to give Kiss some much deserved time off before recording the album that would become Love Gun later that autumn. Kramer finished work on the album, but Casablanca and Kiss deemed it unusable, and the band forged ahead with their Love Gun sessions. Most of the live tracks on Alive II were recorded during the band's August 26‚Äì28 shows at the Forum while on their Love Gun Tour. The 3 p.m. soundchecks at the August 26 and 27 shows were recorded, and later used on the album (i.e. \\"I Stole Your Love\\" with crowd noise being dubbed in later). \\"Beth\\" and \\"I Want You\\" were lifted from the aborted Japanese live album and used on the finished Alive II. As the band did not want to duplicate songs included on Alive!, the songs chosen for the three live sides of the album were all drawn from Kiss' three preceding studio albums: Destroyer, Rock and Roll Over and Love Gun. On the original double album, the songs on side 4 (tracks 6‚Äì10 on the second CD) are studio tracks recorded September 13‚Äì16, 1977.Kiss Alive! 1975-2000 cd liner notes Although Ace Frehley was originally credited for lead guitar on the studio tracks, the remastered version released in 1997 confirmed what had been speculated by Kiss fans for years: Bob Kulick actually played lead guitar on three tracks (\\"All American Man\\", \\"Rockin' in the U.S.A.\\" and \\"Larger Than Life\\"), not Frehley. Frehley's sole involvement for the studio songs was \\"Rocket Ride\\" (originally written for a solo album), on which he sang lead vocals and played both guitar and bass guitar. Paul Stanley played all guitars on \\"Any Way You Want It\\", which was originally recorded by the Dave Clark Five in 1964. Several early copies of the album's cover featured a rare misprint of three additional songs (\\"Take Me\\", \\"Hooligan\\" and \\"Do You Love Me?\\") with a slightly altered song order. None of these additional songs appeared on the LP. On the misprint, \\"Take Me\\" is after \\"Detroit Rock City\\", with \\"King of the Night Time World\\" appearing after \\"Ladies Room\\" on Side 1. Side two features \\"Hooligan\\" after \\"Shock Me\\", which is placed after \\"Hard Luck Woman\\". On Side 3, \\"Do You Love Me?\\" appears after \\"God of Thunder\\", with \\"Beth\\" sandwiched between \\"I Want You\\" and \\"Shout It Out Loud\\". \\"Hooligan\\" and \\"Take Me\\" were performed on the 1977 Love Gun tour, and \\"Do You Love Me?\\" was performed on the Japanese tour that same year, making their consideration for inclusion with the second live album possible. ==Promotional items== The original vinyl issue of Alive II was a 2-LP set with a gatefold cover and picture inner sleeves. Continuing the Kiss tradition of including promotional items with their albums, Alive II was packaged with a full-color booklet titled \\"The Evolution of Kiss\\" and a set of temporary transfer tattoos in a cartoon style. The tattoos depicted the band logo, Kiss Army logo, band member heads, member signatures and symbols. The symbols were meant to represent the four personas of the group and included a skull and crossbones for Gene Simmons, a rose and star with eye for Stanley, a Saturn- like planet and block print-style \\"ACE\\" for Frehley, and a drum and cat's head for Peter Criss. The rose and \\"ACE\\" are copies of Stanley and Frehley's actual tattoos, respectively. A merchandise order form was also included with the album, listing an array of official Kiss merchandise as well as a chance to \\"enlist\\" in the Kiss Army. The inner sleeves depicted crazed Kiss fans in a confetti storm and the band's album discography to date. ==Re-release== Alive II was originally reissued as a double-CD set in what has now become known as a \\"fatboy\\" 2CD case. When the Kiss back catalog was remastered, it was housed in a slimline 2CD case and, in keeping with the rest of the reissue program, had the artwork restored. This included the set of tattoos. The booklet \\"The Evolution of Kiss\\"' and the picture inner sleeves were incorporated as part of the CD booklet. Alive II was re-released in 2006 as part of Kiss Alive! 1975-2000. It included \\"Rock and Roll All Nite\\" (single edit version) as a bonus track. The short running time of Alive II allowed for a single CD edition in the latest release. ==Reception== Coming off of a period of extensive touring, Alive II received a huge fan response and critical acclaim, reaching the No. 7 spot on the Billboard 200 chart. The album has received praise from several critics. In a retrospective review, critic Greg Parto of AllMusic remarked that several tracks such as \\"Detroit Rock City\\", \\"Shock Me\\" and \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" featured an \\"adrenaline-charged\\" vibe. He lauded the album for showing the group in its element as an \\"exciting live band\\". ==Track listingNotes== *Tracks 1‚Äì8,11,13,15 recorded at The Forum, Los Angeles, CA, August 25‚Äì28, 1977 *Tracks 9, 10 recorded at the Capitol Theatre, Passaic, NJ, September 13, 1977 and Electric Lady Studios, New York, NY *Tracks 12, 14 recorded at Budokan Hall, Tokyo, Japan, April 2, 1977 *Track 16 recorded at the Capitol Theatre, Passaic, NJ, September 16, 1977 and Electric Lady Studios, New York, NY *Tracks 17, 19 recorded at the Capitol Theatre, Passaic, NJ, September 14, 1977 and Electric Lady Studios, New York, NY *Track 18 recorded at the Capitol Theatre, Passaic, NJ, September 13, 1977 and Electric Lady Studios, New York, NY *Track 20 recorded at the Capitol Theatre, Passaic, NJ, September 15, 1977 and Electric Lady Studios, New York, NY ==Personnel== ;Kiss *Paul Stanley ‚Äì vocals, rhythm guitar (all guitars, bass and vocals on \\"Any Way You Want It\\") *Ace Frehley ‚Äì lead guitar, vocals (all guitars, bass and vocals on \\"Rocket Ride\\") *Gene Simmons ‚Äì vocals, bass guitar (rhythm guitar on \\"Larger Than Life\\") *Peter Criss ‚Äì drums, vocals ;Additional personnel *Eddie Balandas ‚Äì Introduction on \\"Detroit Rock City\\" *Bob Kulick ‚Äì lead guitar on \\"All American Man\\", \\"Larger Than Life\\" and \\"Rockin' in the U.S.A‚Äù ;Production *Eddie Kramer ‚Äì producer, engineer , mixing *Kiss ‚Äì co- producer *Corky Stasiak ‚Äì engineer *Neil Dorfsman ‚Äì mixing ==Charts== ;Album { !Chart (1977) !scope=\\"col\\"Peak position !Weeks on chart - Australia align=\\"center\\"17 align=\\"center\\" - Canada align=\\"center\\"5 align=\\"center\\" - Japan align=\\"center\\"10 align=\\"center\\"22 - New Zealand align=\\"center\\"13 align=\\"center\\" - Sweden align=\\"center\\"28 align=\\"center\\" - UK align=\\"center\\"60 align=\\"center\\" - US Billboard Pop Albums align=\\"center\\"7 align=\\"center\\"33 } ;Singles { !Single !Year !Chart !Peak position - \\"\\"Shout It Out Loud\\"\\" (Live) 1977 Canada US Billboard align=\\"center\\"74 54 - \\"Rocket Ride\\" 1978 Canada US Billboard align=\\"center\\"46 39 } ==CertificationsReferences== Category:1977 live albums Category:Albums produced by Eddie Kramer Category:Albums recorded at Electric Lady Studios Category:Kiss (band) live albums Category:Casablanca Records live albums Category:Sequel albums ","title":"Alive II"},{"id":"2227459","text":"A Man Called E is Mark Oliver Everett's 1992 major-label debut album, and the first on which he used the pseudonym \\"E\\".

An encounter with Luigi Nono at Dartington consolidated his interest in serialism; subsequently he studied at Oxford University with Edmund Rubbra and Egon Wellesz. In 1964 he went to Paris, ostensibly to study with Olivier Messiaen but with the prime objective of meeting and studying with Jean Barraqu√©. Returning to England, he supported himself as a music critic in London and then, after moving first to Tintagel, Cornwall and subsequently to Peel, Isle of Man, by translation and writing music criticism. He married Clare Gilbert in 1972. Subsequently, he taught at Birmingham University and University of Newcastle upon Tyne before succumbing to a heart attack, in Chopwell, near Newcastle, at the age of 37. His few pupils included the British composers Paul Keenan and Patrick Ozzard-Low. He was upset at an under-rehearsed first performance of En Attendant in 1977 and this possibly discouraged him from composition for a while. He was working on an opera project, tentatively called Ness, but little if any of this was completed. ==Compositions== Bill Hopkins' compositions were largely unpublished at his death, but following efforts by Nicolas Hodges and Patrick Ozzard-Low they are now all published, many in new editions. * Sous-structures.

In 2015-16 season the team played in the Azerbaijani First Division, and became defunct as a professional club the next year. ==Colours and logo== The club's traditional kit is a white and blue shirt, white shorts with grey socks. Their away kit is all maroon. Baku's kits are manufactured by Macron. The club sponsored by the Baghlan Group and ZQAN Holding. The club's logo is based on The Maiden Tower, a noted landmark and one of Azerbaijan's most distinctive emblems. ==Stadium== Tofik Bakhramov Stadium was used for long period of time as Baku's main stadium. In 2008, Baku's president Hafiz Mammadov announced that a new stadium which will have a capacity of 10,000 fans will be built. The new stadium was expected to be finish 2010, but construction is currently on hold. The club's training base is currently used for its domestic games, which holds 2,000 fans. ==Supporters== The club enjoys support from fans scattered all over the city, and the local area in general. The club has been the subject of an independent supporters' fanzine Toplu Bakƒ± since the 2010s. ==League and domestic cup historyPost-independence period=== { -bgcolor=\\"#efefef\\" ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Season ! colspan=\\"9\\"  League ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Azerbaijan Cup ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Top goalscorer - !

Data of recursive types are usually viewed as directed graphs. An important application of recursion in computer science is in defining dynamic data structures such as Lists and Trees. Recursive data structures can dynamically grow to an arbitrarily large size in response to runtime requirements; in contrast, a static array's size requirements must be set at compile time. Sometimes the term \\"inductive data type\\" is used for algebraic data types which are not necessarily recursive. ==Example== An example is the list type, in Haskell: data List a = Nil  Cons a (List a) This indicates that a list of a's is either an empty list or a cons cell containing an 'a' (the \\"head\\" of the list) and another list (the \\"tail\\"). Another example is a similar singly linked type in Java: class List { E value; List next; } This indicates that non-empty list of type E contains a data member of type E, and a reference to another List object for the rest of the list (or a null reference to indicate that this is the end of the list). ===Mutually recursive data types=== Data types can also be defined by mutual recursion. The most important basic example of this is a tree, which can be defined mutually recursively in terms of a forest (a list of trees). Symbolically: f: [t[1], ..., t[k t: v f A forest f consists of a list of trees, while a tree t consists of a pair of a value v and a forest f (its children). This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types. This mutually recursive definition can be converted to a singly recursive definition by inlining the definition of a forest: t: v [t[1], ..., t[k A tree t consists of a pair of a value v and a list of trees (its children). This definition is more compact, but somewhat messier: a tree consists of a pair of one type and a list another, which require disentangling to prove results about. In Standard ML, the tree and forest data types can be mutually recursively defined as follows, allowing empty trees: datatype 'a tree = Empty  Node of 'a * 'a forest and 'a forest = Nil  Cons of 'a tree * 'a forest In Haskell, the tree and forest data types can be defined similarly: data Tree a = Empty  Node (a, Forest a) data Forest a = Nil  Cons (Tree a) (Forest a) ==Theory== In type theory, a recursive type has the general form ŒºŒ±.T where the type variable Œ± may appear in the type T and stands for the entire type itself. For example, the natural numbers (see Peano arithmetic) may be defined by the Haskell datatype: data Nat = Zero  Succ Nat In type theory, we would say: nat = \\\\mu \\\\alpha. 1 + \\\\alpha where the two arms of the sum type represent the Zero and Succ data constructors. Zero takes no arguments (thus represented by the unit type) and Succ takes another Nat (thus another element of \\\\mu \\\\alpha. 1 + \\\\alpha). There are two forms of recursive types: the so-called isorecursive types, and equirecursive types. The two forms differ in how terms of a recursive type are introduced and eliminated. ===Isorecursive types=== With isorecursive types, the recursive type \\\\mu \\\\alpha . T and its expansion (or unrolling) T[\\\\mu \\\\alpha.T / \\\\alpha] (Where the notationX[Y/Z] indicates that all instances of Z are replaced with Y in X) are distinct (and disjoint) types with special term constructs, usually called roll and unroll, that form an isomorphism between them. To be precise: roll : T[\\\\mu\\\\alpha.T/\\\\alpha] \\\\to \\\\mu\\\\alpha.T and unroll : \\\\mu\\\\alpha.T \\\\to T[\\\\mu\\\\alpha.T/\\\\alpha], and these two are inverse functions. ===Equirecursive types=== Under equirecursive rules, a recursive type \\\\mu \\\\alpha . T and its unrolling T[\\\\mu\\\\alpha.T/\\\\alpha] are equal -- that is, those two type expressions are understood to denote the same type. In fact, most theories of equirecursive types go further and essentially specify that any two type expressions with the same \\"infinite expansion\\" are equivalent. As a result of these rules, equirecursive types contribute significantly more complexity to a type system than isorecursive types do. Algorithmic problems such as type checking and type inference are more difficult for equirecursive types as well. Since direct comparison does not make sense on an equirecursive type, they can be converted into a canonical form in O(n log n) time, which can easily be compared. Equirecursive types capture the form of self-referential (or mutually referential) type definitions seen in procedural and object- oriented programming languages, and also arise in type-theoretic semantics of objects and classes. In functional programming languages, isorecursive types (in the guise of datatypes) are far more common. In type synonyms Recursion is not allowed in type synonyms in Miranda, OCaml (unless \`-rectypes\` flag is used or it's a record or variant), and Haskell; so for example the following Haskell types are illegal: type Bad = (Int, Bad) type Evil = Bool -> Evil Instead, it must be wrapped inside an algebraic data type (even if it only has one constructor): data Good = Pair Int Good data Fine = Fun (Bool -> Fine) This is because type synonyms, like typedefs in C, are replaced with their definition at compile time. (Type synonyms are not \\"real\\" types; they are just \\"aliases\\" for convenience of the programmer.) But if this is attempted with a recursive type, it will loop infinitely because no matter how many times the alias is substituted, it still refers to itself, e.g. \\"Bad\\" will grow indefinitely: \`Bad\` ‚Üí \`(Int, Bad)\` ‚Üí \`(Int, (Int, Bad))\` ‚Üí \`...\` . Another way to see it is that a level of indirection (the algebraic data type) is required to allow the isorecursive type system to figure out when to roll and unroll. ==See also== * Recursive definition * Algebraic data type * Inductive type * Node (computer science) ==Notes== Category:Data types Category:Type theory ","title":"Recursive data type"},{"id":"2227486","text":"Jarron Thomas Collins (born December 2, 1978) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected in the second round of the 2001 NBA draft by the Utah Jazz, and played 10 seasons in the NBA. He has a twin, Jason, who also played in the league. ==High school career== Jarron Collins was born in Northridge, California. He and his twin brother Jason, who also became an NBA player, graduated from Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles, California. Also on the team was actor Jason Segel, who starred in a slam dunk contest after Collins deferred to allow his teammate to participate. Collins shot 72 percent from the floor and averaged 13.8 points and 9.2 rebounds during his senior year in high school. ==College career== Collins attended Stanford University, where he was a two- time All-American and finished his Stanford career in the top ten all time in four career categories: rebounds, blocked shots, field-goal percentage and games played. He was also recruited by UCLA, where he, his brother, and Earl Watson were the guests at the recruiting dinner that led to the firing of Jim Harrick at UCLA. ==NBA career== Collins was selected by the Utah Jazz in the second round of the 2001 NBA Draft and played eight seasons with the Jazz until becoming a free agent following the 2009 season. Collins spent the 2009 NBA preseason with the Portland Trail Blazers. He was waived by Portland, but then claimed off waivers by the Phoenix Suns. Collins later joined the Los Angeles Clippers, signing a 10-day contract on January 7, 2011. He renewed his tenure, later signing another 10-day contract on January 17, 2011. On March 1, 2011, he signed a 10-day contract with the Portland Trail Blazers, and was released after finishing a second ten-day contract. He retired from basketball after the season. == Post-playing career == In 2013, he was working for the Los Angeles Clippers as a scout.Jason Collins, openly gay and still unsigned, waits and wonders He later worked as a college basketball analyst for Pac-12 Networks. On July 3, 2014, Collins joined Steve Kerr's staff as a player development coach for the Golden State Warriors. Collins won his first championship when the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2015 NBA Finals. On July 29, 2015, he was promoted to assistant coach by the Warriors. Collins won his second championship in three years when the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2017 NBA Finals. Collins won his third championship in four years when the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2018 NBA Finals. == NBA career statistics  Regular season === -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Utah  70  68  20.6  .461  .000  .740  4.2  .8  .4  .3  6.4 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Utah  22  7  19.1  .442  .000  .710  2.7  .6  .2  .3  5.5 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Utah  81  31  21.4  .498  .000  .718  3.9  1.0  .3  .2  6.0 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Utah  50  38  19.2  .414  .000  .697  3.3  1.2  .2  .1  4.3 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Utah  79  41  21.9  .461  .000  .717  4.2  1.2  .5  .3  5.3 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Utah  82  9  11.1  .441  .000  .651  2.1  .7  .2  .1  2.5 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Utah  70  9  10.0  .439  .000  .622  1.7  .5  .1  .1  1.7 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Utah  26  3  7.7  .457  .000  .727  1.4  .3  .1  .0  1.5 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  Phoenix  34  10  7.7  .387  .000  .400  1.8  .2  .1  .1  1.0 -  align=\\"left\\"   align=\\"left\\"  L.A.

In August 2011 it was rated as 4 stars (northbound - Moto) and 3 stars (southbound - Roadchef) by quality assessors at Visit England. It is unusual, in that the facilities on the northbound (opened 1996) and southbound (1999) sides of the motorway are operated by separate companies: Moto (formerly Granada) and Roadchef respectively. They are apart. ==History== Prior to the construction of the station, a geophysical survey was undertaken to examine cropmarks which possibly marked the location of a ring ditch to ensure that an archaeological site was not destroyed. The ditch was not found, although medieval and post-medieval artefacts were recovered. Blue Boar constructed the southbound services, in addition to their services at Watford Gap but shortly before completion in 1999 they were acquired by Roadchef, who now operate the site.Stafford South, Motorway Services Online, UK.

Built between 1987 and 1989, it spans the Fraser River and connects New Westminster with Surrey. The SkyBridge opened for revenue use on March 16, 1990, with the second half of the Phase II extension of SkyTrain to Scott Road station. ==History== Construction of the bridge began on October 28, 1987. The first half of the bridge heading towards Surrey was completed first, with the New Westminster half being completed on March 19, 1990.

The bridge was the longest cable-supported transit-only bridge in the world from its opening in 1990 to 2019, when it was surpassed by the Egongyan Rail Transit Bridge. ==See also== * List of crossings of the Fraser River * List of bridges in British Columbia == Notes References== * Bridges of Greater Vancouver ==External links== *Illustration of the SkyBridge *Crossing the SkyBridge (YouTube Video) Category:1989 establishments in British Columbia Category:Bridges completed in 1989 Category:Bridges in Greater Vancouver Category:Bridges over the Fraser River Category:Buildings and structures in New Westminster Category:Buildings and structures in Surrey, British Columbia Category:Cable-stayed bridges in Canada Category:Expo Line (SkyTrain) Category:Railway bridges in British Columbia Category:Rapid transit bridges ","title":"Skybridge (TransLink)"},{"id":"2227503","text":"Langmuir film consisting of complex phospholipids in liquid-condensed state floating on water subphase, imaged with a Brewster Angle Microscope. A Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett (LB) film is a nanostructured system formed when Langmuir films‚Äîor Langmuir monolayers (LM)‚Äîare transferred from the liquid-gas interface to solid supports during the vertical passage of the support through the monolayers. LB films can contain one or more monolayers of an organic material, deposited from the surface of a liquid onto a solid by immersing (or emersing) the solid substrate into (or from) the liquid. A monolayer is adsorbed homogeneously with each immersion or emersion step, thus films with very accurate thickness can be formed. This thickness is accurate because the thickness of each monolayer is known and can therefore be added to find the total thickness of a Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett film. The monolayers are assembled vertically and are usually composed either of amphiphilic molecules (see Chemical polarity) with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail (example: fatty acids) or nowadays commonly of nanoparticles. Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett films are named after Irving Langmuir and Katharine B. Blodgett, who invented this technique while working in Research and Development for General Electric Co. ==Historical background== Advances to the discovery of LB and LM films began with Benjamin Franklin in 1773 when he dropped about a teaspoon of oil onto a pond. Franklin noticed that the waves were calmed almost instantly and that the calming of the waves spread for about half an acre. What Franklin did not realize was that the oil had formed a monolayer on top of the pond surface. Over a century later, Lord Rayleigh quantified what Benjamin Franklin had seen. Knowing that the oil, oleic acid, had spread evenly over the water, Rayleigh calculated that the thickness of the film was 1.6 nm by knowing the volume of oil dropped and the area of coverage. With the help of her kitchen sink, Agnes Pockels showed that area of films can be controlled with barriers. She added that surface tension varies with contamination of water. She used different oils to deduce that surface pressure would not change until area was confined to about 0.2 nm2. This work was originally written as a letter to Lord Rayleigh who then helped Agnes Pockels become published in the journal, Nature, in 1891.354x354pxAgnes Pockels‚Äô work set the stage for Irving Langmuir who continued to work and confirmed Pockels‚Äô results. Using Pockels‚Äô idea, he developed the Langmuir (or Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett) trough. His observations indicated that chain length did not impact the affected area since the organic molecules were arranged vertically. Langmuir‚Äôs breakthrough did not occur until he hired Katherine Blodgett as his assistant. Blodgett initially went to seek for a job at General Electric (GE) with Langmuir during her Christmas break of her senior year at Bryn Mawr College, where she received a BA in Physics. Langmuir advised to Blodgett that she should continue her education before working for him. She thereafter attended University of Chicago for her MA in Chemistry. Upon her completion of her Master's, Langmuir hired her as his assistant. However, breakthroughs in surface chemistry happened after she received her PhD degree in 1926 from Cambridge University. While working for GE, Langmuir and Blodgett discovered that when a solid surface is inserted into an aqueous solution containing organic moieties, the organic molecules will deposit a monolayer homogeneously over the surface. This is the Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett film deposition process. Through this work in surface chemistry and with the help of Blodgett, Langmuir was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1932. In addition, Blodgett used Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett film to create 99% transparent anti-reflective glass by coating glass with fluorinated organic compounds, forming a simple anti-reflective coating. ==Physical insight== Langmuir films are formed when amphiphilic (surfactants) molecules or nanoparticles are spread on the air at an air‚Äìwater interface. Surfactants (or surface-acting agents) are molecules with hydrophobic 'tails' and hydrophilic 'heads'. When surfactant concentration is less than the minimum surface concentration of collapse and it is completely insoluble in water , the surfactant molecules arrange themselves as shown in Figure 1 below. This tendency can be explained by surface-energy considerations. Since the tails are hydrophobic, their exposure to air is favoured over that to water. Similarly, since the heads are hydrophilic, the head‚Äìwater interaction is more favourable than air‚Äìwater interaction. The overall effect is reduction in the surface energy (or equivalently, surface tension of water). File:Surfactant.jpg Figure 1: Surfactant molecules arranged on an air‚Äìwater interface For very small concentrations, far from the surface density compatible with the collapse of the monolayer (which leads to polylayers structures) the surfactant molecules execute a random motion on the water‚Äìair interface. This motion can be thought to be similar to the motion of ideal-gas molecules enclosed in a container. The corresponding thermodynamic variables for the surfactant system are, surface pressure (\\\\Pi), surface area (A) and number of surfactant molecules (N). This system behaves similar to a gas in a container. The density of surfactant molecules as well as the surface pressure increases upon reducing the surface area A ('compression' of the 'gas'). Further compression of the surfactant molecules on the surface shows behavior similar to phase transitions. The ‚Äògas‚Äô gets compressed into ‚Äòliquid‚Äô and ultimately into a perfectly closed packed array of the surfactant molecules on the surface corresponding to a ‚Äòsolid‚Äô state. The liquid state is usually separated in the liquid-expanded and liquid-condensed states. All the Langmuir film states are classified according to the compressionality factor of the films, defined as -A(d (\\\\Pi)/dA), usually related to the in-plane elasticity of the monolayer. The condensed Langmuir films (in surface pressures usually higher than 15 mN/m ‚Äì typically 30 mN/m) can be subsequently transferred onto a solid substrate to create highly organized thin film coatings. Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett troughs Besides LB film from surfactants depicted in Figure 1, similar monolayers can also be made from inorganic nanoparticles. ==Pressure‚Äìarea characteristics== Adding a monolayer to the surface reduces the surface tension, and the surface pressure, \\\\Pi is given by the following equation: : \\\\Pi = \\\\gamma_0 - \\\\gamma where \\\\gamma_0 is equal to the surface tension of the water and \\\\gamma is the surface tension due to the monolayer. But the concentration-dependence of surface tension (similar to Langmuir isotherm) is as follows: : \\\\gamma_0 - \\\\gamma = RTK_H C = - RT\\\\Gamma Thus, : \\\\Pi = RT\\\\Gamma or : \\\\Pi A = RT. The last equation indicates a relationship similar to ideal gas law. However, the concentration-dependence of surface tension is valid only when the solutions are dilute and concentrations are low. Hence, at very low concentrations of the surfactant, the molecules behave like ideal gas molecules. Experimentally, the surface pressure is usually measured using the Wilhelmy plate. A pressure sensor/electrobalance arrangement detects the pressure exerted by the monolayer. Also monitored is the area to the side of the barrier which the monolayer resides. File:WilhelmyPlate.jpg Figure 2. A Wilhelmy plate A simple force balance on the plate leads to the following equation for the surface pressure: : \\\\Pi = -\\\\Delta \\\\gamma = - \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\Delta F}{2(t_p + w_p)} \\\\right] \\\\approx - \\\\frac{\\\\Delta F}{2w_p}, only when w_p \\\\gg t_p. Here, \\\\ell_p, w_p and t_p are the dimensions of the plate, and \\\\Delta F is the difference in forces. The Wilhelmy plate measurements give pressure ‚Äì area isotherms that show phase transition-like behaviour of the LM films, as mentioned before (see figure below). In the gaseous phase, there is minimal pressure increase for a decrease in area. This continues until the first transition occurs and there is a proportional increase in pressure with decreasing area. Moving into the solid region is accompanied by another sharp transition to a more severe area dependent pressure. This trend continues up to a point where the molecules are relatively close packed and have very little room to move. Applying an increasing pressure at this point causes the monolayer to become unstable and destroy the monolayer forming polylayer structures towards the air phase. The surface pressure during the monolayer collapse may remain approximately constant (in a process near the equilibrium) or may decay abruptly (out of equilibrium - when the surface pressure was over-increased because lateral compression was too fast for monomolecular rearrangements). File:P-A-Char surfactant.jpg Figure 3. (i) Surface pressure ‚Äì Area isotherms. (ii) Molecular configuration in the three regions marked in the \\\\Pi-A curve; (a) gaseous phase, (b) liquid- expanded phase, and (c) condensed phase. (Adapted from Osvaldo N. Oliveira Jr., Brazilian Journal of Physics, vol. 22, no. 2, June 1992) ==Applications== Many possible applications have been suggested over years for LM and LB films. Their characteristics are extremely thin films and high degree of structural order. These films have different optical, electrical and biological properties which are composed of some specific organic compounds. Organic compounds usually have more positive responses than inorganic materials for outside factors (pressure, temperature or gas change). LM films can be used also as models for half a cellular membrane. * LB films consisting of nanoparticles can be used for example to create functional coatings, sophisticated sensor surfaces and to coat silicon wafers. * LB films can be used as passive layers in MIS (metal-insulator-semiconductor) which have more open structure than silicon oxide, and they allow gases to penetrate to the interface more effectively. * LB films also can be used as biological membranes. Lipid molecules with the fatty acid moiety of long carbon chains attached to a polar group have received extended attention because of being naturally suited to the Langmuir method of film production. This type of biological membrane can be used to investigate: the modes of drug action, the permeability of biologically active molecules, and the chain reactions of biological systems. * Also, it is possible to propose field effect devices for observing the immunological response and enzyme-substrate reactions by collecting biological molecules such as antibodies and enzymes in insulating LB films. * Anti-reflective glass can be produced with successive layers of fluorinated organic film. * The glucose biosensor can be made of poly(3-hexyl thiopene) as Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett film, which entraps glucose-oxide and transfers it to a coated indium-tin-oxide glass plate. * UV resists can be made of poly(N-alkylmethacrylamides) Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett film. * UV light and conductivity of a Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett film. * Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett films are inherently 2D-structures and can be built up layer by layer, by dipping hydrophobic or hydrophilic substrates into a liquid sub-phase. * Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett patterning is a new paradigm for large-area patterning with mesostructured features * Recently, it has been demonstrated that Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett is an effective technique even to produce ultra-thin films of emerging two-dimensional layered materials on a large scale. ==See also== *Brewster angle microscope *Langmuir‚ÄìBlodgett trough *Nanoparticle deposition *Self-assembled monolayers *Wilhelmy plate ==ReferencesBibliography== * R.

Simply two lens system such as a refractor telescope, the object at infinity forms an image at the focal point of the objective lens, which is subsequently magnified by the eyepiece. The magnification is equal to the focal length of the objective lens divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. Cultured Kiwi In practice, not all photographic lenses are capable of achieving infinity focus by design. A lens used with an adapter for close-up focusing, for example, may not be able to focus to infinity. Failure of the human eye to achieve infinity focus is diagnosed as myopia. All optics are subject to manufacturing tolerances; even with perfect manufacture, optical trains experience thermal expansion. Focus mechanisms must accommodate part variations; even custom-built systems may have some means of adjustment. For example, telescopes such as the Mars Orbiter Camera, which are nominally set to infinity, have thermal controls. Deviations from its operating temperature are actively compensated to prevent shifts of focus. ==See also== * Hyperfocal distance ==References== Category:Geometrical optics Category:Science of photography ","title":"Infinity focus"},{"id":"2227536","text":"In the common law of England, the doctrine of worthier title was a legal doctrine that preferred taking title to real estate by descent over taking title by devise or by purchase. It essentially provides that a remainder cannot be created in the grantor's heirs, at least not by those words. The rule provided that where a testator undertook to convey an heir the same estate in land that the heir would take under the laws of inheritance, the heir would be adjudged to have taken title to the land by inheritance rather than by the conveyance, because descent through the bloodline was held to be \\"worthier\\" than a conveyance through a legal instrument. ==History of the doctrine== The doctrine of worthier title, like the Rule in Shelley's Case, had its origin in attempts by royal courts to defeat various devices contrived by lawyers during the era of feudalism to retain lands in their families while avoiding feudal duties, and to secure its free alienability. The creation of family settlements designed to preserve land within the family, transfer it without feudal duties due to the lords of the fee upon transfer at death, and preserve it from claims of creditors, occupied the ingenuity of many common lawyers during the late Middle Ages. So did efforts to undo the restrictions placed by ancestors once they became inconvenient. These concerns underlie the explanation given in Coke on Littleton: The law deemed that since no one is an \\"heir\\" until the person he or she inherits from dies, an attempt to create a remainder interest in the heir created no present interest at all. This interpretation draws strength by analogy from the common words of a conveyance in fee simple, \\"to N. and his heirs.\\" This conveyance creates no present interest in any heir; why should a remainder do the same? ==Why it makes a difference== But if the heir receives the same interest in the property that he would have received either way, the doctrine of worthier title would appear at first impression to be a distinction without a difference. ===The rule divests heirs of interests they seem to have under instruments=== The rule makes a difference when property owners make inter vivos gifts of less than fee simple interests. Suppose Adam owns title to lands, is married to Beulah, and executes a deed \\"to Beulah for life, and then to Adam's heirs\\", Caleb and Dinah. Adam's intent in these words of conveyance would appear to be to grant Beulah a life estate, and then create a vested remainder interest in his apparent heirs Caleb and Dinah. The remainder interest is vested because Beulah is mortal; her death is certain to happen. But, since Caleb and Dinah are already Adam's apparent heirs, their interest under the laws of descent is \\"worthier\\" than the interest they take under the instrument, and the deed is construed as if Adam had stopped with \\"to Beulah for life.\\" This doctrine is further complicated by the fact that although Caleb and Dinah are Adam's heirs apparent, it is legally impossible to determine who is an heir until the death of the grantor. The remainder interest Caleb and Dinah were meant to have in the land subject to Beulah's life estate would have been a vested interest as the conveyance was written, but that vested interest is wiped out by the doctrine of worthier title. Imagine then that Adam then falls on hard times, and his creditors take judgments against him. If the deed were given effect as written, Caleb and Dinah's vested rights to the remainder interest would have existed prior to any judgment liens, and would therefore be prior in right to the claims of Adam's creditors. The doctrine of worthier title, preferring title by intestate succession over title by the instrument, wipes out that vested interest and prefers the rights of Adam's creditors over the rights of Adam's heirs. This illustrates that although the doctrine of worthier title, by its terms, does not affect the right passed from the ancestor to the heir, it can operate to cut off rights of the heirs against third parties. ===It makes a difference who one's heirs are=== The doctrine of worthier title can also affect estates created by will, when those estates are in people who would not take by intestate succession. Suppose once more that Adam is a testator; Adam's good friends in life were Edward and Fran, and Adam's surviving child is Dinah. Under applicable state laws of intestate succession, Dinah would be Adam's heir if Adam had no will. But Adam does have a will: It firstly leaves his land \\"to Edward for life, then to Adam's heirs\\", and it also contains a residuary clause that leaves the remainder of Adam's estate to Fran. By the operation of the instrument, Edward would have a life estate in the land, while Fran would inherit the rest of the estate immediately; then \\"Adam's heirs\\"i.e., Dinahwould have a vested remainder interest in the land, and expect to inherit it upon Edward's death. The doctrine of worthier title intervenes, however, with unexpected results. The doctrine prefers the interest \\"Adam's heirs\\" would have taken to the interest created by an instrument. Here, however, Adam's will designates Fran as his heir at law. Instead of a life estate in Edward, followed by a vested remainder in Dinah, the doctrine of worthier title operates to disinherit Dinah completely, treats the interest of the heirs as a mere reversion, and upon Edward's death gives the land, as well, to Fran. ==Obsolescence of the doctrine== The doctrine of worthier title can be avoided by naming specific people, or classes of people (e.g. \\"my children\\"), instead of using the phrase \\"my heirs\\". As such, the doctrine of worthier title seldom comes into play. The doctrine has also been abolished, either by statute or by judicial decisions, in many common law jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, the rule survives, but only as a presumption or a rule of construction, that can be rebutted by evidence that the grantor meant otherwise. ==References== *Dillman v.

It is the drinking water source for approximately 85,000 residents in the city of Bellingham as well as Whatcom County. It is approximately in length and in width at its widest. Lake Whatcom is located and managed within three political jurisdictions: the city of Bellingham, Whatcom County, and the Lake Whatcom Water and Sewer District. The lake is a popular area for motor boating, swimming, fishing, and other recreational activities. The lake is divided into three basins. Basin 1, the Silver Beach Basin, is the furthest north, and has a maximum depth of . Land use in Basin 1 is primarily residential development, with one large park and several small parks. Basin 2, the Geneva Basin, is the central basin where the drinking water for the city of Bellingham is withdrawn. This basin is the shallowest, with a maximum depth of just . Land use is primarily residential, with a mix of lake protection program properties and some rural forestry. Basin 3 is the southernmost basin and is the most remote. At its greatest depth, Basin 3 is deep, and is estimated to contain 96% of the lake's total water volume.Moore, p.4 Land use in Basin 3 is composed of scattered residential development, mostly in the community of Sudden Valley, as well as rural and commercial forestry. The total area of the Lake Whatcom Watershed is . There are nine annual streams and approximately 25 additional small creeks and tributaries that flow into Lake Whatcom, accounting for 23 sub-watersheds in all. Lake Whatcom drains into Bellingham Bay by way of Whatcom Creek. The lake has only one island, the Reveille Island, owned by Camp Firwood, which is believed to be the site of past ceremonies by Native Americans, due to the presence of pictographs and a zoomorphic stone bowl found on the island. ==Brief history== The earliest known settlement was a Northwest Coast Salish village at the south end of the lake, occupied by the Saquantch tribe. Around 1800 the Saquantch were pushed out by the Lummi tribe. In the 1850s came the first known settlement of Westerners on Lake Whatcom. The first claim of private land was reported for $8. Most of the area surrounding the lake was extensively logged by the end of the 19th century. Large coal mining operations also existed near the lake from the late 19th century through 1919, when the Whatcom Mining Company closed down. In 1946 J.H. Bloedel donated 12.5 acres to the city for what would eventually become Bloedel Donovan Park. In 1962 water was diverted from the Middle Fork of the Nooksack River, through a tunnel, to supply water to a then-new paper-mill on the Bellingham waterfront. ==Water quality== As a drinking water source, Lake Whatcom‚Äôs quality is in compliance for all tested chemicals, bacteria and turbidity.water-brochure-10 Bellingham is a participant in the Partnership for Safe Water and the City‚Äôs drinking water also meets the higher standards set by this group. For the past 10 years the City of Bellingham Public Works has received the Partnership for Safe Water‚Äôs Director Award for commitment to providing safe drinking water.2009-07-01-natl-award ==Pollution== Lake Whatcom was placed on the Environmental Protection Agency's 303(d) list for impaired water bodies in 1998, due to low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels, which are directly related to the amount of phosphorus Lake Whatcom receives. Low DO levels do not directly affect drinking water quality. As required by the 303(d) listing, the Washington State Department of Ecology (DOE) created a computer model to find the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) of phosphorus the lake can receive while maintaining adequate dissolved oxygen levels. In 2008 the DOE estimated that in order to achieve acceptable levels of DO, impervious/run off surfaces need to be returned to pre-1988 levels. Most of the phosphorus enters the lake through non point sources, such as water runoff from storms in parks and lands surrounding the lake. A small portion is attributed to lawns, gardens, and streets containing some phosphorus. Aging septic systems serving development in the watershed possibly could leach phosphorus into the water body. In 2005 fertilizers containing phosphorus were banned to try to reduce the amount of phosphorus entering the lake. The city of Bellingham and Whatcom County have also restricted development activities such as land clearing, from October 1 through May 31 annually to prevent runoff from exposed soil during high precipitation months. A 2010-2014 management program Work Plan for Lake Whatcom was approved by the councils of the City of Bellingham, Whatcom County and Lake Whatcom Water & Sewer District (formerly Water District 10.) Annual analysis and progress reports are prepared to support of the five year management program. View of Lake Whatcom from south end. ==Hydrology== Lake Whatcom is a monomictic lake. The water body is stratified for part of the year (late spring through mid-fall) and mixed during the rest. This phenomenon is important to the hydrology of the lake. The top layer of water (epilimnion) is warmed by the sun and sits atop the metalimnion (also a thermocline). In this middle layer water temperatures take a pronounced decline and eventually a distinct third layer forms (hypolimnion), much colder and isolated from the rest of the water body. Minimal oxygen from the air diffuses down to the hypolimnion, causing very low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. This combined with sediment oxidation, cause for near or complete anoxic conditions in the deeper levels of the lake. This stratification is more pronounced in Basin 3 where water is deepest. This layering of the lake, as well as the distinct physical barriers (sills) between basins cause for slow movement of water through the lake. (Ecology TMDL, 2008) Another important hydrological phenomenon on Lake Whatcom is the occurrence of seiches. A seiche is the slow sloshing of water from one side of the lake to the other, due to winds in Lake Whatcom‚Äôs case. Winds will push water to one side of the lake, causing water levels to rise on one end and lower on the other. When the wind stops, the water rebounds back and forth until it is settled again. This up and down movement of the water causes the thermocline to rise and fall as well, which can result in the cold, anoxic water from Basin 3, to spill over the Strawberry Sill into Basin 2. Major outputs of lake water are Whatcom Creek (77.5% of outflow), City of Bellingham intake (11.3%), evaporation (7.9%) and hatchery (2.5%). The estimated residence time of water entering the lake until it leaves is 7.4 years. (Lake Whatcom Annual Report, 2008/09) ==Invasive species== Invasive species of particular threat to Lake Whatcom include zebra mussel, New Zealand mud snail, Asian carp, and viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). Currently, none of the fifteen species identified by the state of Washington as \\"most unwanted\\" are found in the lake. Eurasian water milfoil is the only species on Washington's list of 50 unwanted species (13 of which are freshwater) that is known to exist in Lake Whatcom. ==Fish== Lake Whatcom is home to 13 species of fish. Among these are six native species: Kokanee salmon (non-anadromous form of Sockeye), coastal cutthroat trout, Longnose Sucker, Peamouth Chub, Sculpin and Threespine Stickleback. Three species have been introduced to the lake: Bluegill, rainbow trout, and smallmouth bass by fisheries authorities. There are four species that have been illegally introduced: Brown Bullhead, Largemouth bass, Pumpkinseed Sunfish and Yellow Perch.WSU The Department of Health has consumption advisories for smallmouth bass and yellow perch, which can be found at the DOH Website ==Lake Whatcom Watershed Land Use== Based on the 2014 Lake Whatcom Watershed Annual Report there are currently 6,877 dwelling units in the Whatcom County Watershed with appropriate assessor‚Äôs residential land use codes, and improvement values of greater than 10,000 dollars. 1,595 of these units are zoned within the city of Bellingham, 1,551 are zoned within the urban growth boundary, 2,566 are zoned in the Sudden Valley neighborhood, and 1,165 are zoned as rural. There are 1,811 existing vacant lots with improvement values of greater than $10,000 and an estimated 8,688 total units with build-out potential. Currently, based on the city of Bellingham‚Äôs 2007 guide to Lake Whatcom, the Lake Whatcom Watershed is zoned for residential use, private commercial forest use, public land, urban growth area, and watershed protected properties, along with non-residential reconveyance areas. There are 31, 127 total acres in the Lake Whatcom Watershed. 4,007 of these are developed, 5,552 are zoned for development but are currently undeveloped, and 2,519 are protected under conservation easement, as a result of land use acquisition by the city of Bellingham and private individuals. ==NotesReferences== * Moore, F.

His parents were Harry Shigekiyo Kiyooka and Mary Kiyoshi Kiyooka. Roy's grandfather on the maternal side, a samurai ≈åe Masamichi, was the 17th headmaster of the Mus≈ç Jikiden Eishin-ry≈´ school of swordsmanship. Roy Kiyooka's brother Harry Mitsuo Kiyooka also became an abstract painter, a professor of art, and sometimes a curator of his brother's work. Roy's youngest brother Frank Kiyooka became a potter. In 1942, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the family was uprooted and moved to a small town in rural Alberta called Opal. Roy Kiyooka was unable to finish high school. From 1946 to 1949, he studied with Jock Macdonald and Illingworth Holey Kerr at the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art. With a scholarship, he was able in 1955 to go to Mexico for eight months to study under James Pinto at the Instituto Allende in San Miguel de Allende. In 1956 he began teaching at the Regina College of Art. In Regina, he worked with a group of abstract painters, but Kiyooka left for Vancouver in 1959 and thus was not included in the group show coined the Regina 5. At the time, Kiyooka was very impressed with Clement Greenberg's ideas. In the summers from 1957 to 1959 he took part in the Emma Lake Artists' Workshops of the University of Saskatchewan, and there worked with Will Barnet and Barnett Newman. From 1960 to 1964, he was at the Vancouver School of Art (now Emily Carr University of Art and Design), from 1965 to 1970 at the Sir George Williams University in Montr√©al (now Concordia University). In 1971‚Äì72 he taught at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Halifax and then, from 1973 to 1991, at the Fine Arts Department of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, where he lived on Keefer Street. He was made an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1965. In the same year he represented Canada in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and won a Silver Medal at the Eighth Sao Paulo Biennial. In 1975, the Vancouver Art Gallery organized a twenty-five-year retrospective of his work. In 1978 he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada. At the end of the 1960s, Kiyooka had lost faith in modernism and stopped painting. He began to use performance, film and music. He also began to work with photography and he produced a few series of sculptures. In 1969, Roy was commissioned to build a sculpture, Abu Ben Adam‚Äôs Vinyl Dream, for the Canadian pavilion at Expo ‚Äò70 in Osaka, Japan. While in Japan he made the StoneDGloves: Alms for Soft Palms photographic series, shown at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa and later he made 16 Cedar Laminated Sculpture series, shown alongside the Ottoman/Court Suite of silk-screen prints, at the Bau Xi Gallery in Vancouver in May 1971. ‚ÄúPear Tree Pomes‚Äù illustrated by David Bolduc (Coach House Press, 1987) was nominated for a Governor General's Literary Award. ==Books== *Kyoto Airs. designed and printed by Takao Tanabe at Periwinkle Press, Vancouver 1964.

The chamber consists of 42 members which are elected by party-list proportional representation. 28 members are elected from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH), and 14 from the Republika Srpska (RS). Members serve for terms of four years. The current membership of the chamber was elected on 7 October 2018. ==Electoral system== The house is elected by party list proportional representation with open lists. For the first two elections, representatives were elected from nationwide lists, but in 2000, local representation was introduced. Eight constituencies, known as electoral units each elect between three and six representatives, giving a total of 30. To ensure proportionality, a further 12 representatives are elected on a nationwide basis. When a party is entitled to one of these nationwide seats, it is given to the candidate from that party who received the most votes without being elected in his or her electoral unit. ==Chairmen of the House of Representatives== {   -- ! # !

He was chief conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, and was formerly music director of the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra from 2005 until 2018. ==BiographyEarly life=== Robertson was born and raised in Malibu, California, and grew up in a music-loving family. His father was a research scientist at Hughes Laboratory and his mother studied literature, but later had a career as a baker. In grade school, he played French horn and violin, and first conducted at age 12. He later studied horn, composition, and conducting as a college student at the Royal Academy of Music in London. ===Career=== After his college years, Robertson began to receive conducting offers in Europe and performed often in both symphonic and operatic repertoire. His early career lectured under the rubric of the U.S. Information Agency in the Middle East and around the world on the subject of music. In 1985, Robertson was appointed resident conductor of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra. From 1992 to 2000, Robertson was music director of the Paris-based Ensemble Intercontemporain (EIC), the first American to hold the post. He broadened the EIC's repertoire to include works by composers such as John Adams. In 2000, Robertson was named the Music Director of the Orchestre National de Lyon (ONL) and artistic director of Lyon's Auditorium. He was the first individual to serve simultaneously in both capacities and the first American to be appointed to either position. He and the ONL toured the United States in 2003, with concerts in New York City, Seattle, Berkeley, and Los Angeles. He concluded his tenure in Lyon in 2004. ===St. Louis Symphony Orchestra=== Robertson's relationship with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra (SLSO) began in January 1999 when he made his first conducting appearance with the orchestra. Robertson's second appearance with the SLSO occurred in February 2002 at Carnegie Hall after the SLSO's then-music director Hans Vonk withdrew a few days before the concert due to health problems. Robertson agreed to substitute, and he and the orchestra had only one rehearsal before the concert. He later appeared with the SLSO in March 2003. The SLSO named Robertson its next Music Director in December 2003, effective with the 2005-2006 season. In April 2005, Robertson led the SLSO for the second time in a Carnegie Hall concert, after a labor dispute at the SLSO was resolved. Robertson conducted the SLSO in Carnegie Hall again in November 2005, March and April 2006, and March 2007. Robertson was one of Carnegie Hall's Perspectives artists for the 2005-2006 season, and he curated concerts with the SLSO and other performances with various guest artists and ensembles. Robertson is generally regarded as having restored the SLSO's artistic prominence after the sudden resignation of the prior music director Hans Vonk, and the orchestra's labor dispute in the winter of 2005.Cheryl Wittenauer, \\"Music director Robertson hits the right notes in St. Louis\\". Associated Press, May 2006. New concert series begun during his tenure include a group of contemporary music concerts with the Pulitzer Arts Foundation and a series of \\"Fusion Concerts\\" at the Touhill Performing Arts Center of the University of Missouri‚ÄìSt. Louis. In September 2006, the SLSO announced the extension of Robertson's contract through 2010, with a clause to allow for yearly renewal.\\"Music Director David Robertson's Contract Extended Through 2010\\" Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra, 14 September 2006. As of November 2009, his SLSO contract was through the 2011-2012 season. Following a subsequent contract renewal through 2014, his SLSO contract was extended, in January 2013, through the 2015-2016 season.c In March 2014, the orchestra and Robertson announced a further extension of his SLSO contract through the 2017-2018 season. In December 2016, the SLSO and Robertson jointly announced an additional one-year extension of his contract through the 2018-2019 season, which was the intended time for the close of his SLSO tenure. However, in June 2017, the orchestra noted an update to Robertson's contract, with a newly scheduled conclusion of his music directorship at the close of the 2017-2018 season, in a reversion of the December 2016 situation. Robertson stood down as SLSO music director in 2018. During Robertson's tenure, the SLSO made its first-ever appearance at The Proms in September 2012. With the SLSO, Robertson has conducted several commercial recordings of music of John Adams (composer) for the Nonesuch label. These works include: * Guide to Strange Places, Doctor Atomic Symphony (revised version) * City Noir, Saxophone Concerto * Scheherazade.2 ===Other conducting work=== In February 2005, Robertson was named the principal guest conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBC SO) and he assumed that post later in the year, in parallel with the beginning of his St. Louis tenure. On September 12, 2009, Robertson became the second American conductor and the first standing BBC SO principal guest conductor to conduct the Last Night of the Proms. He concluded his tenure as the BBC SO's principal guest conductor in August 2012.Catherine Bott, BBC Radio 3, Broadcast of Prom 25, 1 August 2012. Robertson first guest-conducted the Sydney Symphony Orchestra in 2003. In 2014, he became the Sydney Symphony Orchestra's chief conductor and artistic adviser. He concluded his tenure in Sydney in December 2019, following a one-year extension of his contract announced in July 2017. Robertson's other work in contemporary music has included serving as Festival Director for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's January 2008 Concrete Frequency Festival, as well as Music Director of the 2008 Ojai Music Festival in Ojai, California. His work in opera has included several appearances at the Metropolitan Opera, including Jan√°ƒçek's The Makropulos Affair (1996), Mozart's Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail (2008), Britten's Billy Budd (2012). and Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro in 2012. Robertson also conducted the first production of The Death of Klinghoffer at the Metropolitan Opera in October 2014. In February 2018, the Juilliard School announced the appointment of Robertson as its next director of conducting studies, effective with the 2018-2019 academic year. Robertson has recorded for the Sony Classical, harmonia mundi, Naive, EMI/Virgin Classics, Atlantic/Erato, Nuema, Ades Valois, Naxos and Nonesuch labels, featuring the music of such composers as Adams, Bart√≥k, Boulez, Carter, Dusapin, Dvor√°k, Ginastera, Lalo, Manoury, Milhaud, Reich, Saint-Sa√´ns, and Silvestrov. ===Personal life=== Robertson has been married three times. His third wife is pianist Orli Shaham, the sister of violinist Gil Shaham. Robertson and Shaham first met at a January 1999 SLSO concert, which was the SLSO debut for both of them. They married on January 3, 2003. She is mother to their twin boys, Nathan Glenn, and Alex Jacob, born September 15, 2007.\\"Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra's Music Director, David Robertson, and Wife Have Twin Boys\\". Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra (press release), 17 September 2007. The family makes its home in New York City. Robertson has two grown sons, Peter and Jonathan, from his second marriage to the German writer Ane Dahm. ==Honors and awards== Robertson received the Seaver/National Endowment for the Arts Conductors Award in 1997. In December 1999, Musical America named David Robertson Conductor of the Year. Robertson received the 2006 Ditson Conductor's Award from Columbia University for his championing of American music. In April 2010, Robertson was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. On May 15, 2010, Robertson received the degree Doctor of Music honoris causa from Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey. In October 2011, Robertson was named a Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres by the Ministry of Culture of France.\\"Conductor David Robertson Named 'Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres'\\". Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra (press release), 14 October 2011. His recording of John Adams' 'City Noir' won a Grammy. Along with Diana Doherty, Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Nigel Westlake and Synergy Vocals, Robertson was nominated for the 2019 ARIA Award for Best Classical Album for the album Nigel Westlake: Spirit of the Wild / Steve Reich: The Desert Music. The album is a recording of Nigel Westlake‚Äôs Spirit of the Wild and of Steve Reich‚Äôs The Desert Music with the latter conducted by Robertson. ==References * Official Web Site of Conductor David Robertson * Official Facebook Page of Conductor David Robertson * David Robertson biography at the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra * Tommasini, Anthony. \\"Under a Baton in a Younger Hand\\".

Undesirable conformation can limit the ability to perform a specific task. Although there are several faults with universal disadvantages, a horse's conformation is usually judged by what its intended use may be. Thus \\"form to function\\" is one of the first set of traits considered in judging conformation. A horse with poor form for a Grand Prix show jumper could have excellent conformation for a World Champion cutting horse, or to be a champion draft horse. Every horse has good and bad points of its conformation and many horses (including Olympic caliber horses) excel even with conformation faults. ==Conformation of the head and neck== The standard of the ideal head varies dramatically from breed to breed based on a mixture of the role the horse is bred for and what breeders, owners and enthusiasts find appealing. Breed standards frequently cite large eyes, a broad forehead and a dry head-to-neck connection as important to correctness about the head. Traditionally, the length of head as measured from poll to upper lip should be two-thirds the length of the neck topline (measured from poll to withers). Presumably, the construction of the horse's head influences its breathing, though there are few studies to support this. Historically, a width of 4 fingers or 7.2 cm was associated with an unrestricted airflow and greater endurance. However, a study in 2000 which compared the intermandibular width-to-size ratio of Thoroughbreds with their racing success showed this to be untrue. The relationship between head conformation and performance are not well understood, and an appealing head may be more a matter of marketability than performance. Among mammals, morphology of the head often plays a role in temperature regulation. Many ungulates have a specialized network of blood vessels called the carotid rete, which keeps the brain cool while the body temperature rises during exercise. Horses lack a carotid rete and instead use their sinuses to cool blood around the brain. These factors suggest that the conformation of a horse's head influences its ability to regulate temperature. A dished face on an Arabian. Shires often have a Roman nose. ===Muzzle=== *A horse with a dished face or dished head has a muzzle with a concave profile on top, often further emphasized by slight bulging of forehead (jibbah). Dished heads are associated with Arabians and Arabian-influenced breeds, which excel at Endurance riding and were originally bred in the arid Arabian desert. There are several theories regarding the adaptive role of the dished head. It may be an adaptation to reduce airflow resistance and increase aerobic endurance. Dished head is not considered a deformity. *A Roman nose is a muzzle with a convex profile. Convex heads are associated with Draft horses, Baroque horse breeds and horses from cold regions. This trait likely plays a role in warming air as it is inhaled, but may also influence aerobic capacity. Roman nose is not considered a deformity. A pig-eyed horse A horse with a parrot mouth. *A horse with small nostrils or small nares can be found in any breed and often accompanies a narrow jaw and muzzle. Small nostrils limit the horse's ability to breathe hard while exerting itself. This especially affects horses in high- speed activities (polo, racing, eventing, steeplechase) or those that need to sustain effort over long duration (endurance, competitive trial, combined driving). Horses with small nostrils are therefore best used for pleasure riding or non-speed sports. ===Eyes=== *A horse with pig eye has unusually small eyes. This is primarily an aesthetic issue, but claimed by some to be linked to stubbornness or nervousness, and thought to decrease the horse's visual field. ===Jaw size=== *The lower jaw should be clearly defined. The space between the two sides of the jawbone should be wide, with room for the larynx and muscle attachments. The width should be 7.2 cm, about the width of a fist. *The jaw is called narrow if the width is less than 7.2 cm. *The jaw is called large if it is greater than 7.2 cm. A large jaw gives head a false appearance of being short and adds weight to the head. Too large of a jaw can cause a reduction to the horse's ability to flex at the poll to bring his head and neck into proper position for collection and to help balance. ===Jaw position=== *A parrot mouth is an overbite, where the upper jaw extends further out than the lower jaw. This can affect the horse's ability to graze. Parrot mouth is common and can be managed with regular teeth floating by a veterinarian. *A monkey mouth, sow mouth, or bulldog mouth is an underbite, where the lower jaw extends further out than the upper jaw. This is less common than parrot mouth. This can affect the horse's ability to graze. Monkey mouth is common and can be managed with regular teeth floating by a veterinarian. ===Ears=== *Ears should be proportional to the head. They should be set just below the level of the poll at the top of the head. Ears should be a position where they can be rotated forward and backward. Ears that are too large or too small may make the head seem too small or large in proportion with the body. ===Neck length and position=== *A neck of ideal length is about one third of the horse's length, measured from poll to withers, with a length comparable to the length of the legs. *An ideally placed neck is called a horizontal neck. It is set on the chest neither too high nor too low, with its weight and balance aligned with the forward movement of the body. The horse is easy to supple, develop strength, and to control with hand and legs aids. Although relatively uncommon, it is usually seen in Thoroughbreds, American Quarter Horses, and some Warmbloods. Horizontal neck is advantageous to every sport, as the neck is flexible and works well for balancing. *A short neck is one that is less than one third the length of the horse. Short necks are common, and found in any breed. A short neck hinders the balancing ability of the horse, making it more prone to stumbling and clumsiness. A short neck also adds more weight on the forehand, reducing agility. Bull neck: short and thick. * A short, thick, and beefy neck with short upper curve is called a bull neck. The attachment to its body is beneath the half-way point down the length of shoulder. Bull neck is fairly common, especially in draft breeds, Quarter Horses, and Morgans. Bull neck makes it more difficult to maintain balance if the rider is large and heavy or out of balance, which causes the horse to fall onto its forehand. Without a rider, the horse usually balances well. A bull neck is desirable for draft or carriage horses, so as to provide comfort for the neck collar. The muscles of the neck also generate pulling power. A horse with bull neck is best for non-speed sports. Bull neck is not considered a deformity. *A long neck is one that is more than one third the length of the horse. Long necks are common, especially in Thoroughbreds, Saddlebreds, and Gaited Horses. A long neck may hinder the balancing ability of the horse, and the horse may fatigue more quickly as a result of the greater weight on its front end. The muscles of a long neck are more difficult to develop in size and strength. A long neck needs broad withers to support its weight. It is easier for a long necked horse to fall into the bend of an S-curve than to come through the bridle, which causes the horse to fall onto its inside shoulder. This makes it difficult for the rider to straighten. A horse with this trait is best used for jumping, speed sports without quick changes of direction, or for straight line riding such as trail riding. ===Neck arch and musculature=== A nicely arched neck. *A neck with an ideal arch is called an arched neck or turned-over neck. The crest is convex or arched with proportional development of all muscles. The line of the neck flows into that of the back, making for a good appearance and an efficient lever for maneuvering. The strength of the neck with proportional development of all muscles improves the swing of shoulder, elevates the shoulder and body, and aids the horse in engaging its hindquarters through activation of the back. An arched neck is desirable in a horse for any sport. Ewe-neck, with muscling on the underside. *A ewe neck or upside-down neck bends upward instead of down in the normal arch. This fault is common and seen in any breed, especially in long-necked horses but mainly in the Arabian Horse and Thoroughbred. The fault may be caused by a horse who holds his neck high (stargazing). Stargazing makes it difficult for a rider to control the horse, who then braces on the bit and is hard-mouthed. A ewe neck is counter- productive to collection and proper transitions, as the horse only elevates its head and doesn't engage its hind end. The horse's loins and back may become sore. The sunken crest often fills if the horse is ridden correctly into its bridle. However, the horse's performance will be limited until proper muscling is developed. * A swan neck is set at a high upward angle, with the upper curve arched, yet a dip remains in front of the withers and the muscles bulge on the underside. This is common, especially in Saddlebreds, Gaited horses, and Thoroughbreds. A swan neck makes it easy for a horse to lean on the bit and curl behind without lifting its back. It is often caused by incorrect work or false collection. * A knife neck is a long, skinny neck with poor muscular development on both the top and bottom. It has the appearance of a straight crest without much substance below. A knife neck is relatively common in older horses of any breed. It is sometimes seen in young, green horses. It is usually associated with poor development of back, neck, abdominal and haunch muscles, allowing a horse to go in a strung-out frame with no collection and on its forehand. It is often rider-induced, and usually indicates lack of athletic ability. Knife neck can be improved through skillful riding and the careful use of side reins to develop more muscle and stability. A knife necked horse is best used for light pleasure riding until its strength is developed. Large crest. ===Crest=== *Large crests are relatively uncommon but can be found in any breed. It is most often seen in stallions, ponies, and draft breeds. There may be a link to the animal being an easy keeper. An excessively large crest puts more weight on the forehand. A large crest is usually caused by large fat deposits above the nuchal ligament. An excessive crest due to obesity or insulin resistance can be treated with a reduced diet. ==Conformation of the shoulder, forearm, and chestThe Shoulder=== Upright shoulder Straight, upright, or vertical shoulder * The shoulder blade, measured from the top of the withers to the point of shoulder, lies in an upright position, particularly as it follows the scapular spine. Often accompanies low withers. * Upright shoulders are common and seen in any breed. An upright shoulder affects all sports. * The horse has shorter muscular attachments that thus have less ability to contract and lengthen. This shortens the stride length, which requires the horse to take more steps to cover ground, and thus causes a greater risk of injury to structures of front legs and hastened muscular fatigue. * An upright shoulder may cause a rough, inelastic ride due to the high knee action. It increases concussion on front limbs, possibly promoting the development of DJD or navicular disease in hard-working horses. The stress of impact tends to stiffen the muscles of the shoulder, making the horse less supple with a reduced range of motion needed for long stride reach. * An upright shoulder causes the shoulder joint to be open and set low over a short, steep arm bone, making it difficult for a horse to elevate its shoulders and fold its angles tightly, which is needed for good jumping, or in cutting. A horse with an upright shoulder usually does not have good form over fences. * An upright shoulder is best for gaited or park showing, parade horses, and activities requiring a quick burst of speed, like roping or Quarter Horse racing. Sloping shoulder Laid-back or sloping shoulder * The horse has an oblique angle of shoulder (measured from the top of the withers to the point of shoulder) with the withers set well behind the elbow. Often accompanies a deep chest and high withers. * A sloping shoulder is common. It mostly affects jumping, racing, cutting, reining, polo, eventing, and dressage. * The horse has a long shoulder blade to which attached muscles effectively contract and so increase the extension and efficiency of stride. It distributes muscular attachments of the shoulder to the body over a large area, decreasing jar and preventing stiffening of the shoulders with impact. The horse has an elasticity and free swing of its shoulder, enabling extension of stride that is needed in dressage and jumping. A long stride contributes to stamina and assists in maintaining speed. * The longer the bones of the shoulder blade and arm, the easier it is to fold legs and tuck over fences. The laid back scapula slides back to the horizontal as the horse lifts its front legs, increasing the horse's scope over fences. * A sloping shoulder has better shock-absorption and provides a comfortable ride because it sets the withers back, so a rider is not over the front legs. * A sloping shoulder is most advantageous for jumping, dressage, eventing, cutting, polo, driving, racing, and endurance. \\\\---- The humerus (a.k.a. the arm bone) The arm bone is from the point of shoulder to the elbow, it is covered in heavy muscle and serves as a leverage point for the muscle of the front leg attached near the elbow. \\"Ideal\\" * The humerus should be very strong and shorter than the length of the shoulder, has many points of connections for muscle. * It should connect with the shoulder in a ball and socket joint, this is the only joint in the front limb that is capable of side-to-side movement. * The length can be determined by looking at the point of shoulder to the point of elbow. Conformation of the Ideal Humerus (all measurements are while the horse is standing squarely) * the angle of the shoulder blade and upper arm should be between 100-120 degrees * instead of trying to visualize where the bones of the arm and shoulder are to get the above angle measured, the judge could use the angle between then point of shoulder and the humerus, which should be at the angle of around 85 degrees. * long, well-sloped shoulder and short upright humerus * the humerus is at desirable length when it is 50-60% the length of the shoulder Faults \\"Too long humerus\\" * The humerus is considered too long when it is more than 60% the length of the scapula. * When this fault occurs then the shoulder muscles become overstretched, and movement of the forearm is decreased. * Because movement is constricted then the horse is more likely to be clumsy. * too long = too horizontal which leads to the horse \\"standing under himself\\" note \\"standing under\\" simply means that the horses legs are too far under his body and his chest sticks out. \\"Short humerus\\" * The humerus is considered too short when it is less than 50% the length of the shoulder. * Humerus is usually in a horizontal position, which closes the shoulder angle (shoulder and humerus) to less than 90 degrees. * With a short arm bone the horse will look like he has no chest at all and his legs will stick out too far in front of his body. * Common, usually seen in Quarter Horses, Paints, and Warmbloods * A short humerus decreases the scope of a horse, and contributes to a short, choppy stride. * A short stride increases the impact stress on front legs, especially the feet. The rider is jarred and the horse absorbs a lot of concussion. More steps are needed to cover ground, increasing the chance of front-end lameness. * The horse tends to be less able to do lateral movements. note: that is the shoulder is too angled (less than 45 degrees) then the horse's front legs will be stilted and stiff. \\\\---- The Elbow * The highest point in the front leg, not covered in muscle. * The part of the ulna that protrudes back to form the elbow, known as the olecranon process. * Range of motion in the elbow is 55-60 degrees Conformation * Should not turn out or in and should sit squarely on the forearm. * The olecranon process should be viewed in a vertical position from the rear. * The elbow should be in line with the front of the withers and not farther back than the peak of the withers. * Should blend in smoothly with the muscles of the forearm. Possible faults \\"Turned-in/tied-in elbow\\" * Elbows are too close to the body and twist the leg. * This conformation will make the horse toe-out. * They tend to wing in when the knee is flexed. * The feet may cross over, and they could stumble as a result. * This also tends to be accompanied with a narrow chest. * There is also restricted movement and this results in a shorter stride. \\"Out-turned elbow\\" * Usually associated with base-narrow and pigeon-toed conformation. * The legs are too wide at the chest and too close at the feet. * This makes the horse paddle out when they flex the knee. ===The Forearm (radius)=== * Connects the elbow and knee Conformation * Should be in perfect line with the knee and cannon (when viewed from the front or the side) * Needs to be thick, wide, well-developed and long. * Fused with the ulna. * Minimal fat, muscles should be visible. * The muscles of the front of the forearm are known as extensors and the back of the forearm are known as flexors. * The muscling of the forearm should be not bulky unless the breed is known for this; i.e. Quarter Horses and more so in the Draft breeds * There should be an inverted \\"V\\" at the top of the chest. Long forearm * A long forearm is desirable, especially if the horse also has a short cannon. It increases leverage for maximum stride length and speed. * Good muscling of a long forearm is especially advantageous to jumping horses, as the strong forearm muscles absorb concussion from the impact and diffuse the strain on tendons and joints on landing. * A long forearm is best for speed events, jumping events, and long-distance trail riding. Short forearm * Although uncommon, it is usually seen in Morgans and Quarter Horses. * A short forearm affects speed and jumping events, but has little effect on stock horse events. * The length of stride is dependent on the forearm length and shoulder angle, so a short forearm causes horse to need to increase the number of steps to cover a distance, increasing overall muscular effort and hastening fatigue. * Increases the action of the knees, giving an animated appearance. Knee action is not compatible with speed. ===The Chest=== The conformation of the horse's chest plays a significant role in his level of endurance and stamina. A horse that will do work requiring speed, power, or endurance needs as much room as possible for maximum lung expansion. The horse's ribs form the outer surface of the chest and define the appearance of the horse's midsection, or barrel, the area between the front legs and hindquarters. The thorax of the horse is flatter from side to side, as compared to the human thorax, which is flatter from back to back. The horses thorax is also deeper from the breastbone to the spine. This gives the horse a greater lung capacity, and thus greater endurance. Conformation * A horse's chest is measured from the bottom end of the neck to the tops of the front legs. * Ribs play an important role in the shape of the chest, whether they are narrow or wide. * The overall shape of a horse's chest plays a key role in the front leg movement. * The horse's chest should be well defined and not blend into the neck. * Width of the chest is measured from shoulder to shoulder, at the points of shoulders. * Chest should be wide, with relatively wide gap between the front legs, but not too wide, as this may cause the horse to have decreased speed and agility. Chest shape When viewing the chest from the front, the chest should be wider at the bottom than at the top. The shoulder blades should be much closer together at their tops, toward their withers, than at the points of shoulders where the front legs attach. * Most important thing to remember: The chest width allows for lung expansion and determines agility! Well-sprung ribs * Ribs that have a greater degree of curvature, have the \\"greater spring of rib.\\" * A horse with a well rounded rib is usually more endurance type (i.e. Arabian or Thoroughbred) Slab-sided ribs * Flat, short and upright rather than sloping backward. * Ribs go straight down instead of outward and back, limiting room for lung expansion. * Horses with slab-sided ribs tend to have less-developed abdominal muscles and less stamina. * Also a longer, weaker loin, and can not carry as much weight. Barrel chest and deep chest * Most horsemen prefer a deep, wide chest over the barrel chest, as his length of leg tends to be greater than his depth of chest. * Although, a horse with a barrel chest that has proper proportions can provide just as much lung room as a deep chest (in terms of actual efficiency and endurance) * Barrel chest horses tend to have good stamina. Chest faults Narrow chest * Too narrow in front with a narrow breast, and not enough room between his front shoulders. * Narrow chested horses have a harder time carrying a riders weight. * With a too narrow chest the forelegs may be too close together, or may angle out to be base wide. Too-wide chest * Too wide ribs hinder the backward sweep of the upper arm. * Also spreads riders' legs apart uncomfortably and apply stress to the riders' knees. * Too- wide chest cuts down on speed and agility [All information is derived from \\"The horse Conformation Handbook\\" written by Heather Smith Thomas] Narrow breast * With the horse standing square, the width between the front legs is relatively narrow. However, this can be skewed by how far apart feet are placed at rest. A narrow breast often represents general thickness and development of shoulder. * A narrow breast is usually seen in Gaited horses, Saddlebreds, Paso Finos, and Tennessee Walkers * A horse's ability to carry weight is dependent on the size of its chest, so a horse that doesn't do well with draft work may be fine in harness or with a light rider. * Narrowness may be from turned-in elbows which can cause toes to turn out, making the horse appear narrow. * Narrowness in the chest may be from immaturity, poor body condition, inadequate nutrition, or under-developed breast muscles from a long time in pasture and lack of consistent work. The horse usually has undeveloped shoulder and neck muscles. * The horse may tend to plait, and is more likely to interfere, especially at the trot * The horse is best for pleasure riding, driving in harness, and trail riding. Pigeon-breasted horse, with the sternum protruding Pigeon-breasted * The front legs come too far back under the body, giving a bulky appearance to the breast as viewed from the side. The front legs lie behind a line drawn from the withers to the ground, setting the horse under himself. It is often associated with a long shoulder blade that drops the point of shoulder somewhat low with the arm bone relatively horizontal, setting the elbow more to the rear. * A relatively uncommon fault, mostly seen in Quarter Horses with big, bulky muscles. * Bulky breast muscles and legs set under the body decrease the efficiency of stride and swing of shoulders, thus hastening fatigue. It may interfere with the front legs, forcing them to move to the side rather than directly under horse. Causes a ‚Äúrolling‚Äù gait that slows the horse's speed, especially at the gallop. * Should have little interfering in the sprinting sports that need rapid acceleration. The inverted V of the pectorals are important for quick turns, doges, and spins needed by stock horses. * This conformation quality is most useful in Quarter Horse racing, barrel racing, roping, and stock horse sports where a low front end crouches & the horse makes quick turns. \\\\---- ==Conformation of the bodyWithers=== Mutton withers. Mutton withers * The horse has flat and wide withers, from short spines projecting off the 8th-12th vertebrae. * Can be seen in any breed. * The withers are an important attachment for ligaments and muscles that extend head, neck, shoulder, and back vertebrae, and are also insertion point for muscles that open ribs for breathing. If mutton withered, the horse has less range of motion when extending the head and back muscles, so is less able to elevate its back with its head and neck extended, which affects ability for collection. * Difficult to hold on saddle. If saddle slides forward, it can put weight on the forehand, interfering with balance and restrict the shoulder movement by saddle and rider movement, causing shortened stride, interfering or forging. * The horse is often difficult to fit with a driving harness * Pleasure riding and non-jumping activities are best for the horse Hollow behind withers * A ‚Äúshelf‚Äù behind the withers, gives a hollow appearance, often created by lack of muscular development * Usually found in high-withered horses of any breed * Often implies a less-developed muscular bed for the saddle to rest on. The saddle will often bridge in this area to pinch the withers, creating soreness of the withers and muscles. The horse is then less willing to move out, extend the shoulders, or use its back, especially for speed or jumping. It also prevents a horse from true elevation of the back needed for collection. A poorly-fitting Saddle (with an insufficiently high pommel arch or a narrow tree) may initiate or exacerbate this condition, as the horse will avoid movements which cause discomfort, thus leading to muscle loss behind the withers. * Horses that trot fast with high, erect neck (like Standardbred race horses) do not develop strong, active back muscles. They are often hollow behind and just below withers due to lack of collection. * This conformation is commonly rider-induced from a horse allowed to move strung-out behind, and is usually seen in gaited horses and long- distance trail or endurance horses. * Protective movement by the horse to minimize saddle pinching may contribute to back pain. Persistent body carriage without collection can overuse some musculoskeletal structure, leading to arthritis. * This conformation will not affect performance if saddle fits correctly. If the saddle does not, the horse is best used for non-speed and non-jumping sports. High withers on a Thoroughbred. High withers * The 8th through 12th thoracic vertebrae are long and angle backward to create steep, high withers * Especially seen in Thoroughbreds, Saddlebreds, and some Warmbloods * High withers provide a lever for the muscles of the back and neck to work together efficiently. As the head and neck lower to extend, the back and loin muscles correspondingly shorten or lengthen. The backward angle of withers is usually associated with sloping shoulders, which provides good movement of the shoulder blade. This makes it easy for the horse to engage in collection, lengthen, round its back for jumping, or extend its shoulder for improved stride length and speed. * If the withers are too high and narrow, there is a chance that a poorly fit saddle will impinge on withers and slip back too far, creating pain especially with the rider's weight. Performance and willingness will suffer. ===Back=== A slightly long back. Long back * With the back measured from peak of withers to peak of croup, exceeds 1/3 of horse's overall body length. Usually associated with long, weak loins. * Especially common in gaited horses, Saddlebreds, Thoroughbreds, and some Warmbloods. * The horse's ability to engage back depends on its ability to elevate the back and loins, requiring strong back and abdominal muscles. A long back is flexible, but harder for horse to stiffen and straighten spine to develop speed or coil loins to collect and engage the hindquarters to thrust rear limbs forward. This then affects upper level dressage, cutting, reining, barrel racing, and polo: sports that require rapid engagement of the hindquarters. Reduced flexion forces the horse to jump flatter with less bascule. * It is difficult to develop a long back's muscle strength, so a horse is more likely to fatigue under the rider and to sway over time. The abdominal have more difficulty in compensating, so they are also less likely to develop. Loins and hindquarters may swing more than normal, increasing the occurrence of sore muscles which leads to a stiff, rigid ride. Cross-firing or speedy cutting likely at high-speeds from a horse with a long back. * Movement of the back is flatter and quieter, making a more comfortable ride and is easier for horse to change leads. Short back Short back * The horse's back measures less than 1/3 of overall length of horse from peak of withers to peak of croup * Can be seen in any breed, especially in American Quarter Horses, Arabians, and some Warmbloods * The back may lack flexibility and become stiff and rigid. If vertebral spines of back are excessively small, the horse may have difficulty bending and later develop spinal arthritis. This adversely affects dressage and jumping performance. If still in back and torso, the stride will become stiff and inelastic. The horse may overreach, forge, or scalp itself if the hind legs do not move straight. * The horse may be handy and agile, able to change direction with ease. Good for polo, roping, cutting, reining. If the horse has good muscling, it is able to support weight of rider with rare occurrence of back pain. * Conformation best used in agility sports This horse has a significant sway in the back. Saddle-, hollow-, low-, sway- backed/ down in the back * The span of the back dips noticeably in center, forming a concave contour between the withers and croup. Usually causes high head carriage and stiffness through the back. Associated with a long back. * Often associated with weakness of ligaments of the back. Examples include a broodmare who had multiple foals and the back dips with age, an old horse where age is accompanied with weakening of the ligaments, a horse with poor fitness/conditioning that prevents adequate ligament support of the back muscles, or an overuse injury to the muscles and ligaments from excess work, great loads, or premature work on an immature horse. * Some horses with high croups and straight backs often appear to be swayed. * Often accompanies long loins. If the loins aren't broad, the ligament structures may weaken, causing the back to drop. * A sway back positions the rider behind the center of gravity, interfering with balance. * The horse is unable to elevate for true collection, which can affect any sport but most notably dressage, jumping, and stock work. The back may get sore from lack of support and the rider's weight. * The horse is unable to achieve rapid impulsion since the rear is less connected with front end. To achieve speed, the horse must create some rigidity in back and spine, which is not possible with a sway. This causes problems in racing, eventing, Steeplechasing, and polo. * This horse is most suited for pleasure riding and for teaching students. * Although sway backs are usually associated with older horses, there is also a congenital (sometimes genetic) form of sway back.Rooney, James (1998). The Lame Horse: 093. Horses with this condition will already be obviously swaybacked at a young age, sometimes even before they are a year old. Some lines of American Saddle Horse seem to carry this gene. ===Loin and coupling=== Roached back * In the area where the back and loins join the croup (the coupling) there is an upward convex curvature of the spine. Often a result of a short back, or injury or malalignment of the lumbar vertebrae. * Often accompanied by less- developed loin muscles in breadth, substance, and strength. The spine already ‚Äúfixed‚Äù in a curved position, and the attaching muscles are unable to contract properly to round or elevate the back. Thus it is difficult to engage the hindquarters or round the back by elevating loin muscles. Vertebrae often have reduced motion so the horse takes shorter steps behind. * Jumping and dressage especially are affected. * The horse is stiffer through the back and less flexible in an up and down motion as well as side to side. * There may be back pain from vertebral impingement. * There is a less elastic feel beneath rider as the back too rigid. Agility sports (polo, cutting, reining, barrel racing, gymkhana) are more difficult. * Common fault The mare in the picture has both a \\"widows peak\\" and long loins. Long or weak loins/weak coupling * Coupling is the joining of back at the lumbosacral joint. Ideally, the L-S joint should be directly over the point of hip. Weak coupling is where the L-S joint is further to the rear. The loin is the area formed from last rib to point of hip. The loin is measured from the last rib to the point of hip, and it should be one to one and a half hands width. Long loins are associated with a long back. The croup is often relatively flat and the quarters are high. * Horse with weak or slack loin might have good lateral bend, but collection suffers as true collection depends on coiling loin to bend the hind legs. Because the hind legs and hocks aren't able to be positioned under body, the hind legs string out behind, so the horse is more likely to go on the forehand. This creates coordination and balance problems, as well as forelimb lameness. * The horse needs the hind legs under for jumping, and for going up and down hill. A weak loin inhibit's this, especially affecting eventing, jumping, and trail horses. * The loin regulates the distribution of weight on the forehand by allowing the horse to elevate its back and distribute its weight to the hind end. Horses unable to coil the loins move with stiff backs and a flattened L-S joint, throwing the rear legs out behind. This limits the ability of dressage horses, and also affect reining, cutting, and polo horses as they are unable to explode with thrust. *Long-coupling is associated with a long back and short hindquarters. This will limit collection is any discipline. Short ‚Äìcoupling * Also known as close coupled. * Associated with a short back, which will enable high thrust and collection. Rough coupling/widow's peak * In the loin, the horse has a hollow area considerably lower than foremost part of the croup. * Fairly uncommon, and does not affect the horse's use in sport. * Cosmetically displeasing. Muscling of the loin may be ample and strong with minimal effect on ability to collect back or push with haunches. However, if a horse doesn't have a strong loin, it will have difficulty in raising the back for engagement. ===Croup and \\"hip\\"=== The croup is from the lumbosacral joint to the tail. The \\"hip\\" refers to the line running from the ilium (point of the hip) to the ischium (point of the buttock)of the pelvis. After the point that is made by the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae, the line following is referred to as the croup. While the two are linked in terms of length and musculature, the angle of the hip and croup do not necessarily correlate. But it is desirable for a horse to have a square to slightly pear shaped rump. A horse can have a relatively flat croup and a well-angled hip. Racehorses do well with hip angles of 20-30 degrees, trotting horses with 35 degrees. Once a horse is developed, the croup should be approximately the same height as the withers. In some breeds a high croup is hereditary trait. Steep croup but fairly long \\"hip\\". Steep Croup or Goose Rump *A steep croup is often linked to shortened stride *Less of a fault for slow-moving horses such as draft breeds than for light riding horses *Some breeds prefer a steep croup on their horses. Quarter horses in particular. Flat croup. Flat or Horizontal Croup * The topline continues in a relatively flat manner to the dock of tail rather than falling off at oblique angle at the hips. * Seen especially in Saddlebreds, Arabians, and Gaited horses * Encourages a long, flowing stride. This helps a horse go faster, especially when a flat croup is sufficiently long to allow a greater range of muscle contraction to move the bony levers of skeleton. Short croup *Length from L-S joint to dock of the tail is insufficient for adequate muscular attachment *Reduces power of hindquarters *Usually seen in conjunction with multiple hind leg faults Short \\"hip\\" * The L-S joint is often behind the point of hips. Insufficient length from point of hip to point of buttock * Horse will have difficulty collecting. * A well-muscled build may hide a short pelvis. * Provides less length of muscular attachments to the thigh and gaskin. This diminishes engine power in speed or jumping events. * Short hip is less effective as a muscular lever for collection and to contract the abdominal muscles as the back rounds. More muscular effort is required. Flat \\"hip\\" *Flat pelvis, line from point of hip to point of buttock flat and not properly angled, result is pelvis structure too long. L-S joint often tipped, ischium improperly placed. *It is more difficult to engage the hindquarters, so the back tends to stiffen. Thus it is hard to excel in dressage, jumping, stock horse work. Minimizes the ability to develop power at slower paces needed by draft horses. Jumper's Bump (also known as Hunter's or Racking Bump) A \\"jumper's bump\\" A Clydesdale with a very low set tail. *The horse has an enlargement at the top of the croup, or a malalignment of the croup with the pelvis and lumbar vertebrae, caused by the tearing of a ligament at the top of the croup. One or both sides of L-S joint may be affected. *Fairly common, usually seen in jumping horses and in horses that rack in an inverted frame. * It is a torn ligament caused by excessive hindquarter effort, or from a horse that had the hindquarters slip out underneath or trotted up a very steep hill. Usually does not cause problems once healed, although it is easier to re-injure. * Usually associated with horses with weak loins or a long back that is unable to coil loins properly for collection. Commonly caused by overpacing young horses, a rider allowing a horse to jump while strung out, or by racking (or other gaiting) in a very inverted frame. ===Tail=== High Tail Set * Tail comes out of body on a level with the top of the back. * Commonly seen in Arabians, Saddlebreds, Morgans, and Gaited horses. * There is no direct performance consequence. Often, although not always, it is associated with a flat croup. A high-set tail contributes to the appearance of a horizontal croup, which may be an aesthetic concern to some. * Gives as animated appearance, which is good for parade, showing, or driving Low Tail Set * Tail comes out of the body well down along the haunches. Associated with goose-rumped or steep pelvis. * Seen in any breed, especially in draft breeds * Only aesthetic concern unless directly caused by pelvic conformation. Wry Tail/ Tail Carried to One Side *The tail is carried cocked to one side rather than parallel to the spine *May be hereditary *May be linked to spinal misalignment, possibly due to injury *May be because the horse is not straight between the rider's aids, can be used to determine how straight a horse is traveling behind. Over time, incorrect body carriage may place undue stress on limbs. *May be from discomfort, irritation or injury ===Ribcage and flanks=== Wide Chest and Barrel/Rib Cage * Rounded ribs increase the dimensions of the chest, creating rounded, cylindrical or barrel shape to the rib cage. Length of the ribs tends to be short. * Seen in any breed, especially American Quarter Horses, and some Warmbloods * Provides ample room for the expansion of the lungs. * Too much roundness increases the size of the barrel, may restrict upper arm movement, the length of stride, and thus speed. Round ribs with a short rib length further restrict the shoulder. * Pushes the rider's legs further to the side of the body, and can be uncomfortable, especially in sports that require long hours in saddle or that require sensitive leg aids (dressage, cutting, reining). Pear-Shaped Ribcage/Widens Toward Flank * The horse is narrow at and behind the girth at midchest, then widens toward the flank * Common, especially in Arabians, Saddlebreds, and Gaited horses * Makes it difficult to hold the saddle in place without a breastplate or crupper, especially on uneven terrain, jumping, or low crouch work with quick changes of direction (cutting). When saddle continually shifts, the rider's balance is affected, and the horse and rider must make constant adjustments. Saddle slippage has the potential to create friction and rubs on back or cause sore back muscles. * Horse is best used in sports on level terrain and for non-jumping activities Well-Sprung Ribs * Ribs angle backward with sufficient length, breadth, and spacing with arched rib cage and deep chest from front to back. Largest part of the barrel is just behind the girth area. Last rib is sprung outward and inclined to the rear, with the other ribs similar in length, roundness, and rearward direction. * Desirable for any sport. * Promotes strong air intake, improving performance and muscular efficiency * Ample area of attachment of shoulder, leg and neck muscles, enabling a large range of motion for muscular contraction and speed of stride. * The rider's weight is easily balanced and stabilized since the saddle stays steady and the rider can maintain close contact on horse's side with leg. * There is sufficient room for developing strong loin muscles while still having short loin distance between last rib and point of hip (close coupling). Slab-Sided * Poor spring of the ribs due to flatness and vertical alignment of the ribs. Ribs are adequate in length. * Common, especially in Thoroughbreds, Saddlebreds, Tennessee Walkers, and Gaited horses * There is less room for the lungs to expand, limiting the efficiency of muscular metabolism with prolonged, arduous exercise * If there is a short depth in the chest, the horse will have a limited lung capacity which is likely to limit the horse's ability for speed work * Horse generally has lateral flexibility. * Narrowness makes it difficult for the rider to apply aids since the legs often hangs down without fully closing on the horse. More effort needed to stay on horse's back because of limited leg contact and the saddle tends to shift. * Horse has a harder time carrying the rider's weight because of reduced base of support by narrow back muscles. Tucked Up/Herring-Gutted/Wasp- Waisted * Waist beneath the flanks is angular, narrow, and tucked up with a limited development of abdominal muscles. Often associated with short rear ribs, or undernourished horses. * Seen in any breed * Often a result of how horse is trained and ridden. If a horse doesn't use its back to engage, they never develop their abdominal muscles. Appears to be like a lean runner (greyhoundish), with stringy muscles on topline and gaskin. * Lack of abdominal development reduces overall strength of movement. Stamina is reduced, and the back is predisposed to injury. The horse is incapable of fluid, elastic stride, but is probably capable of ground-cover despite correct body carriage. * Speed and jumping sports should be avoided until the muscles are developed. Good Depth of Back * The depth of the back is the vertical distance from lowest point of back to bottom of abdomen. Point in front of sheath or udder should be parallel to the ground and comparable in depth to front portion of chest just behind the elbow at the girth. * Seen in any breed, especially Warmbloods, Quarter Horses, and Morgans. * Good depth indicates strong abdominal muscles, which are important for strength and speed. Critical to dressage, jumping, and racing. Strong abdominals go with a strong back, which is suitable for carrying a rider's weight and engaging the haunches. * Should not be confused with an obese horse in ‚Äúshow‚Äù condition, as fat just conceals wasp-waistedness. ==Conformation of the hindquarters and hips== The Hindquarters Short Hindquarters * Measured from the point of hip to the point of buttock, the hindquarters should be ideally at least 30% of length of overall horse. Anything less is considered short. Most horses are between 29-33%; 33% is typically \\"Ideal,\\" Thoroughbreds may have a length reaching 35%. * Insufficient length minimizes the length of the muscles needed for powerful and rapid muscular contraction. Thus, its reduces speed over distance, stamina, sprint power, and staying ability. * Tends to reduce the horse's ability to fully engage the hindquarters need for collection or to break in a sliding stop * Horse is most suited for pleasure sports that don't require speed or power * Often associated with too steep angles causing Goose Rump * The point of croup is behind the point of hips, thus making a weaker loin and coupling * May also cause horse to be sickle-hocked with the hind foot being too far under the body Steep-Rumped * Viewed form the side, the pelvis assumes a steep, downward slope. * Uncommon, except in draft horses, but seen in some Warmbloods. * A steep slant of the pelvis lowers the point of buttock bringing it closer to the ground & shortening the length of muscles from the point of buttock & the gaskin. Shortens the backward swing of the leg because of reduced extension & rotation of hip joint. A horse needs a good range of hip to get a good galloping speed and mechanical efficiency of hip and croup for power & thrust. Therefore, a goose-rumped horse is not good at flat racing or sprinting. * Harder for a horse to ‚Äúget under‚Äù and engage the hindquarters. Causes the loins and lower back to work harder, predisposing them to injury. * A goose-rump is valuable in sports with rapid turns & spins (reining, cutting). The horse is able to generate power for short, slow steps (good for draft work). * Horse is most suited for stock horse work, slow power events (draft in harness), low speed events (equitation, pleasure, trail) Goose-Rumped * Viewed from the side, the pelvis has a relatively flat, but sloping profile of adequate length, but the flatness does not extend to the dock of the tail as in a Flat-Crouped horse. * The croup is exceptionally high and exhibits a sloping quarter and low tail connection, also with a sharp, sloping rump * The pelvis is too far downward and too short * Creates a low point of buttocks, making it closer to the ground, thus making the hindquarters less strong & inhibiting the stifle's movement * Common in some Warmbloods and may be considered a desirable trait in some breeds. * Often seen in Arabian breed due to the high tail placement; may exhibit levelness * This conformation allows good engagement of the hindquarters, while giving the long stride and speed of Flat-Crouped conformation. * A horse that is goose- rumped does not have enough swing and power in the hindlegs and would not be suitable for speed and endurance events * Often associated with good jumping performance. * Note that the term Goose-Rumped is sometimes used as a synonym for Steep-Rumped, potentially causing confusion, as the two conformations imply rather different qualities in the horse's performance. * Horses with goose-rump also are more prone to hindquarter injuries * Often associated with \\"Cat-Hammed\\" horses * Does not severely affect draft breeds because of their short, slow steps A cat-hammed horse. Cat-Hammed/Frog's Thighs * The horse exhibits long, thin thighs and gaskins with insufficient muscling * The horse has poor development in the hindquarters, especially the quadriceps and thighs. Associated with goosed-rumps & sickle hocks. * Uncommon, most usually seen in Gaited horses. Can develop from years in confinement. * The horse lacks the development needed for speed and power, so the horse is not fast or strong. Thus it is not advantageous for flat racing, polo, eventing, jumping, steeplechase, and harness racing. * The horse's gait tends to be more ambling than driving at the trot, so the horse often develops a stiff torso & back, making the ride rigid. * This fault can also be attributed to poor nutrition and conditioning Thighs * The thighs are the muscled area over the femur bone. * The femur and tibia bones should be about the same lengths, thus allowing for more room for longer thigh muscles; this allows for greater speed and power and for a longer stride * Thighs should be well-muscled, long and deep. * The inner thighs should be full and give a square or oblong look to the hindquarters when viewed from the rear * The back of the thighs or the \\"hams\\" should be thick enough that they touch each other until they split. \\\\---- The Hips Narrow Hips * Viewed from the rear, the breadth between the hips is narrow. * In horses with narrow hips, the pelvis is crowded and aligned improperly which puts more strain and stress on the joints of the legs * Common, seen in any breed, although Quarter Horses tend not to have them. Usually in Thoroughbreds, Saddlebreds, Arabians, and Gaited horses. * A narrow pelvis contributes to speed since the horse can get its hind legs well under its body to develop thrust. * The narrow hip shape is partially dictated by exercise development of haunch muscles. * Good width widens the breadth between stifles, hocks & lower legs to enable power, acceleration, & foot purchase into ground, preventing interference injuries. Narrow pelvis limits size of muscular attachments of hips, affecting strength & power. * The horse is best suited for flat racing, trail, carriage driving; does not possess much driving power Rafter Hips/Wide Hips * Wide, flat hip shaped like a \\"T\\" when viewed from behind. Cattle tend to have this pelvis type to the extreme. * The horse's legs are too far apart at the top and the feet are too close together; often exhibit base narrow stance (not straight from behind), thus exuding less amount of strength and placing more stress on the joints * Uncommon, usually seen in Gaited horses, Saddlebreds, and Arabs. * Rafter hips are often amplified by poor muscling along thighs and lower hips. Exercises to improve muscling helps the problem. * Not desirable in a riding horse with fast gaits One Hip Bone Lower/Knocked-Down Hip * From behind, the point of hip on one side is lower than the other. May be due to an injury to the point of hip, or to sublaxtion or fracture of the pelvis. * Uncommon * Generally induced by a traumatic blow to hip. Not heritable. * The gait symmetry is affected (which is bad for dressage or show horses). Interference with power and thrust may alter strength of jumping high fences or reduce speed. * The horse may not be able to perform strenuous activities. * Knocked-down hips interfere with speed and jumping. * The horse is more prone to developing muscular or ligament soreness associated with re-injury or strain. This is especially likely to occur in a jumper, racer, steeplechaser, or eventer. However, in most cases the horse recovers completely, others will often still experience muscle soreness and will have to settle for only performing slow work. High Stifles/ Short Hip * Ideal hip forms equilateral triangle from point of buttock, point of hip, and stifle. A short hip has a short femur (thigh bone) that reduces the length of quadriceps and thigh muscles. The femur is short when the stifle seems high (sits above sheath in male horse) * Found in any breed, but usually in racing Quarter Horses or Thoroughbreds. * Effective in generating short, rapid, powerful strokes (sprint or draft work). The horse has a rapid thrust & thus rapid initiation of sprint speed. * Ideally, the bones of the gaskin and femur should be of similar length in horse that does anything but sprint or draft work. A short femur reduces stride length behind & elasticity of stride that jumpers, dressage horses, and flat/harness racers want. Low Stifle/ Long Hip * A long hip is created by a long femur which drops the level of stifle to or below the sheath line on a male horse. * Favorable in all sports except sprint sports and draft work * Enables the horse to develop speed and power after it gets moving. * The muscles of the hip, haunches, and thighs will be proportionately long with a long hipbone, giving the horse the capacity to develop speed and power over a sizeable distance. Produces ground-covering and efficient stride in all gaits. * Good for eventing, steeplechase/timber, flat/harness racing, jumping, and long-distance riding ==Conformation of the front and hind legs== The Cannon and Tendons Long cannon bones. Long Cannon Bone * The cannon is long between the knee and fetlock, making the knees appear high relative to the overall balance of the horse * Reduces the muscular pull of the tendons on the lower leg. * Uneven terrain or unlevel foot balance will magnify the stress on the carpus since lengthy tendons are not as stabilizing to the lower limb as shorter ones * Increases the weight on the end of the limb, contributing to less efficient and less stable movement. Added weight to front legs increases the muscular effort needed in picking up a limb, leading to hastened fatigue. * Increase in tendon/ligament injury, especially when the horse is also tied-in above the knee. * Horses with long cannons are best for flat racing short distances. Short cannon bones. Short Cannon Bone * Cannon is relatively short from fetlock to knee as compared to knee to elbow * This conformation is desirable in any performance horse * A short cannon bone improves the ease and power of the force generated by the muscles of a long forearm or gaskin. Enables an efficient pull of the tendons across the back of the knee or point of hock to move the limb forward and back. * Also reduces the weight of the lower leg so less muscular effort is needed to move the limb, which contributes to speed, stamina, soundness, and jumping ability. Rotated Cannon Bone * The cannon rotates to the outside of the knee so it appears twisted in its axis relative to knee. May still be correct and straight in alignment of joint, but more often associated with appearance of carpus valgus. * Places excess strain on the inside of the knee and lower joints of the leg, potentially leading to soundness issues, although this is not common. Bench or Offset Knees/ Offset Cannons * The cannons are set to the outside of the knee so an imaginary plumb line does not fall through middle. * Causes excessive strain on the lateral surfaces of the joints from the knee down and on the outside portions of the hoof. * There is an exaggerated amount of weight supported by the medial splint bone, leading to splints. * The horse is most suited for non-speed activities like pleasure riding, driving, and equitation. Tied-in Below the Knee * The cannon, just below the knee, appears ‚Äúcut out‚Äù with a decreased tendon diameter. Rather than parallel with cannon, tendons are narrower than the circumference measured just above the fetlock. * Affects speed event (racing, polo) and concussion events (steeplechase, jumping, eventing, endurance). * Limits the strength of the flexor tendons that are needed to absorb the concussion and diffusion of impact through the legs, making the horse more prone to tendon injuries, especially at the midpoint of the cannon or just above. * The leverage of muscle pull is decreased as the tendons pull against the back of knee rather than a straight line down back of leg. This reduces power and speed. * Associated with a reduced size in the accessory carpal bone on back of knee over which the tendons pass. The small joints are prone to injury and don't provide adequate support for the column of leg while under weight- bearing stress. * Horse is most suited for sports that shift the animal's weight to the rear or that don't depend on perfect forelimb conformation (dressage, driving, cutting). \\\\---- The Front Legs- The Knee Medial Carpal Deviation/ Carpus Valgus/ Knock-Kneed * One or both knees deviate inward toward each other, with the lower leg angles out, resulting in a toed-out stance. Occurs because of an unequal development of the growth plate of distal radius, with the outside growth plate growing faster than inside. The bottom of the forearm seems to incline inward. * Any horse can inherit this, but it may also be acquired from imbalanced nutrition leading to developmental orthopedic disease (DOD) or a traumatic injury to growth plate. * The horse is most suited for pleasure riding, low-impact, and low speed events * The medial supporting ligaments of the carpus will be under excess tension. May cause soundness problems in the carpals or supporting ligaments. Horse also tends to toe-out, causing those related problems. * Some research is beginning to indicate that deviation of the front leg in this way will reduce the injuries to horses with sport use, especially racing, the research done in Thoroughbreds and Quarter Horses.TheHorse.com: AAEP 2003, \\"Conformation and Racing Problems\\", http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=4986 retrieved 6 August 2009 Even in his statue, Seabiscuit was visibly over at the knees Bucked, Sprung, or Goat Knees/ Over at the Knee * Knee inclines forward, in front of a plumb line, when viewed from the side. * Often a result of an injury to the check ligament or to the structures at the back of the knee. The column of the leg is weakened. Thus, the horse is apt to stumble and lose balance due to the reduced flexibility and from the knee joints that always are ‚Äúsprung.‚Äù * If congenital, often associated with poor muscle development on the front of the forearms, which limits speed and power. * More stress is applied to the tendons, increasing the risk of bowed tendons. The angle of attachment of the DDF and check ligament is increased, predisposing the check ligament to strain. Tendons and fetlock are in an increased tension at all times, so the horse is predisposed to injury to the suspensory (desmitis) and sesamoid bones. If the pasterns are more upright there is further stress. Calf-Kneed/Back at the Knee * The knee inclines backward, behind a straight plumb line dropped from the middle of the forearm to the fetlock. * Usually leads to unsoundness in horses in speed sports. Places excess stress on the knee joint as it overextends at high speeds when loaded with weight. Backward angle causes compression fractures to the front surfaces of the carpals, and may cause ligament injury within knee. Worsens with muscle fatigue as the supporting muscles and ligaments lose their stabilizing function. * Calf-knees weaken the mechanical efficiency of the forearm muscles as they pull across the back of the carpus, so a horse has less power and speed. The tendons and check ligament assume an excess load so the horse is at risk for strain. Often the carpals are small and can't diffuse the concussion of impact. ‚àë * The horse should have good shoeing, eliminating LTLH (long-toe, low-heel) syndrome. * Sports that have more hindquarter function, like dressage, or slow moving activities like pleasure riding, are best for this horse. \\\\---- The Front Legs- The Fetlock Toed-Out/Lateral Deviation of Pastern from Fetlock/ Fetlock Valgus * An angular limb deformity that creates a toed-out appearance from the fetlock down. * A fairly common fault * Creates excess strain on one side of the hoof, pastern and fetlock, predisposing the horse to DJD, ringbone, foot soreness or bruising. * The horse will tend to wing, possibly causing an interference injury. May damage splint or cannon bone. * This conformation diminishes the push from rear legs, as symmetry and timing of the striding is altered with the rotated foot placement, particularity at the trot. Thus, stride efficiency is affected to slow the horse's gait. * The horse is unable to sustain years of hard work. Toed-In/Medial Deviation of Pastern/Fetlock Varus * An angular limb deformity causing a pigeon toed appearance from the fetlock down, with the toe pointing in toward the opposite limb. * Horse is most suited for pleasure riding, non-impact, low-speed, and non-pivoting work. * These horses tend to paddle, creating excess motion and twisting of the joints with the hoof in the air. This is unappealing in show horse, wasteful energy, which reduces the efficiency of the stride, so the horse fatigues more quickly. The hoof initially impacts ground on inside wall, causing excess stress on the inside structures of the limb, leading to ringbone (DJD) and sole or heel bruising in inside of hoof. \\\\---- The Hindlegs Short Gaskin/Hocks High * Results from a relatively short tibia with a long cannon. Ideally, hocks are slightly higher than the knees, with the point of hock level with the chestnut of the front leg. Hocks will be noticeable higher in horse with this conformation. * The horse may have a downhill balance with the croup higher than the withers. * See especially in Thoroughbreds, racing Quarter Horses, and Gaited horses. * With this conformation, the horse can pull the hind legs further under the body, so there is a longer hind end stride, but the animal may not move in synchrony with the front. This will create an inefficient gait, as the hind end is forced to slow down to let the front end catch up, or the horse may take high steps behind, giving a flashy, stiff hock and stifle look. May cause forging or overreaching. ‚àë * Often results in sickle hock conformation. Long Gaskin/Low Hocks * Long tibia with short cannons. Creates an appearance of squatting. * Usually seen in Thoroughbreds and stock horses. * A long gaskin causes the hocks and lower legs to go behind the body in a camped-out position. The leg must sickle to get it under the body to develop thrust, causing those related problems. * The long lever arm reduces muscle efficiency to drive the limb forward. This makes it hard to engage the hindquarters. The rear limbs may not track up and the horse may have a reduced rear stride length, forcing the horse to take short steps. * The horse is best used for galloping events, sprinting sports with rapid takeoff for short distance, or draft events. Hocks Too Small * Hock appears small relative to the breadth and size of adjacent bones. Same principals with knees too small. * The joints are a fulcrum which tendons and muscles pass over for power and speed, and large joints absorb concussion and diffuse the load of the horse. Small joints are prone to DJD from concussion and instability, especially in events where the horse works off its hocks a lot. * A small hock doesn't have a long tuber calcis (point of hock) over which the tendons pass to make a fulcrum. This limits the mechanical advantage to propel the horse at speed. The breadth of the gaskin also depends on hock size, and will be smaller. Cut Out Under the Hock * Front of the cannon, where it joins the hock, seems small and weak compared to the hock joint. In the front end, it is called ‚Äútied in at knee.‚Äù * Mainly affects sports that depend on strong hocks (dressage, stock horse, jumping) * Reduces the diameter of the hock and cannon, which weakens the strength and stability of the hocks. Means a hock is less able to support a twisting motion (pirouettes, roll backs, sudden stops, sudden turns). The horse is at greater risk for arthritis or injury in hock. Slightly camped out behind. Camped Out Behind * Cannon and fetlock are ‚Äúbehind‚Äù the plumb line dropped from point of buttock. Associated with upright rear pasterns. * Seen especially in Gaited horses, Morgans, and Thoroughbreds. * Rear leg moves with greater swing before the hoof contacts the ground, which wastes energy, reduces stride efficiency, and increases osculation and vibrations felt in joints, tendons, ligaments, and hoof. May cause quarter cracks and arthritis. * Difficult to bring the hocks and cannons under unless the horse makes a sickle hocked configuration. Thus, the trot is inhibited by long, overangulation of the legs and the horse trots with a flat stride with the legs strung out behind. * It is difficult to engage the back or haunches, so it is hard to do upper level dressage movements, bascule over jumps, or gallop efficiently. Sickle- or Sabre-Hocked/ Overangulated Long Hind Legs * The hind leg slants forward, in front of the plumb line, when viewed from the side. The cannon is unable to be put in vertical position. Also called ‚Äúcurby‚Äù hock, as it is associated with soft tissue injury in the rear, lower part of the hock. * Limits the straightening and backward extension of hocks, which this limits push-off, propulsion, and speed. There is overall more hock and stifle stress. * Closed angulation and loading on the back of the hock predisposes the horse to bone and bog spavin, thoroughpin, and curb. Post-Legged/Straight Behind * Angles of the hock and stifle are open. The tibia is fairly vertical, rather than having a more normal 60 degree slope * Common, usually seen in Thoroughbreds, steeplechasers, timber horses, eventers, and hunter/jumpers. * In theory, sickle hocks facilitate forward and rearward reach as the hock opens and closes with a full range of motion without the hock bones impinging on one another. This led to selective breeding of speed horses with straight rear legs, especially long gaskins. * The problem is that this breeding has been taken to the extreme. Tension on the hock irritates the joint capsule and cartilage, leading to bog and bone spavin. Restriction of the tarsal sheath while in motion leads to thoroughpin. A straight stifle limits the ligaments across the patella, predisposing the horse to upward fixation of the patella, with the stifle in a locked position, which interferes with performance and can lead to arthritis of the stifle. * It is difficult for the horse to use its lower back, reducing the power and swing of the leg. * Rapid thrust of the rear limbs causes the feet to stab into the ground, leading to bruises and quarter cracks. Bow-Legged/Wobbly Hocks * Hocks deviate from each other to fall outside of plumb line, dropped from point of buttocks, when the horse is viewed from behind. * Most commonly seen in Quarter Horses with a bulldog stance. * Hoof swings in as the horse picks up its hocks and then rotates out, predisposing the animal to interference and causing excess stress on lateral hock structures, predisposing the horse to bog and bone spavin, and thoroughpin. * The twisting motion of the hocks causes a screwing motion on the hoof as it hits the ground, leading to bruises, corns, quarter cracks, and ringbone. * The horse does not reach forward as well with the hind legs because of the twisting motion of the hocks once lifted, and the legs may not clear the abdomen if the stifles are directed more forward than normal. This reduces efficiency for speed and power. Cow Hocks/Medial Deviation of the Hocks/Tarsus Valgus * Hocks deviate toward each other, with the cannon and fetlock to the outside of the hocks when the horse is viewed from the side. Gives the appearance of a half- moon contour from the stifle to hoof. Often accompanied by sickle hocks. * Fairly common, usually seen in draft breeds. * Disadvantages to trotting horses, harness racers, jumpers, speed events, and stock horses. ‚àë * Many times Arabians, Trakehners, and horses of Arabian descent are thought to have cow hocks. But really the fetlocks are in alignment beneath the hocks, so they're not true cow hocks. * A slight inward turning of hocks is not considered a defect and should have no effect. * A horse with a very round barrel will be forced to turn the stifles more out, giving a cow-hocked appearance * Medial deviation in true cow hocks causes strain on the inside of the hock joint, predisposing the horse to bone spavin. Abnormal twisting of pastern and cannon predisposes fetlocks to injury. * More weight is carried on medial part of hoof, so it is more likely to cause bruising, quarter cracks, and corns. The lower legs twist beneath the hocks, causing interfering. * The horse develops relatively weak thrust, so speed usually suffers. ==Conformation of the pasterns== The angle of the pasterns is best at a moderate slope (between 50-55 degrees) and moderate length. Long, sloping pasterns on a Thoroughbred. Pasterns Long and Sloping * The pasterns are long (more than 3/4 length of cannon) relative to rest of leg. * This defect affects long-distance and speed sports * Long pasterns have been favored because they can diffuse impact, giving a more comfortable ride. However, excess length puts extreme tension on the tendons and ligaments of the back of the leg, predisposing the horse to a bowed tendon or suspensory ligament injury. The suspensory is strained because fetlock is unable to straighten as horse loads the limb with weight. * The pasterns are weak and unable to stabilize fetlock drop, so the horse is predisposed to ankle injuries, especially in speed events where the sesamoids are under extreme pressure from the pull of the suspensory. This can cause sesamoid fractures & breakdown injuries. * May be associated with high or low ringbone. Increased drop of fetlock causes more stress on pastern and coffin joints, setting up conditions for arthritis. * There is a delay time to get the feet off the ground to accelerate, and thus long pasterns make the horse poor for speed events. * The horse is best for pleasuring riding, equitation, and dressage Short, upright pasterns. Pasterns Short and Upright * A horse's pasterns are short if they are less than 1/2 length of cannon. The pasterns are upright if they are angled more toward the vertical. A long, upright pastern has the same performance consequences as short and upright. * Most commonly seen in Quarter Horses, Paints, and Warmbloods * The horse is capable of rapid acceleration, but is restricted to a short stride. They excel in sprint sports. The short stride is a result of both a short pastern and upright shoulder, creating a short, choppy stride with minimal elasticity and limited speed. * Short pasterns have less shock-absorption, leading to more a jarring ride and amplified stress on the lower leg. The concussion is felt over the navicular apparatus, so the horse is more at risk for navicular disease, high or low ringbone, and sidebone. Also windpuffs and windgalls occur from chronic irritation within fetlock or flexor tendon sheath. * The horse has reduced mechanical efficiency for lifting and breaking over the toe, so it may trip or stumble. * The horse is best for sprint sports like Quarter Horse racing, barrel racing, roping, reining, and cutting ==Conformation of the feet and base== Toeing out causing the horse to wing-in with the front legs. Horse feet conformation The hooves bear all the weight of the horse. As each foot hits the ground, a concussive force passes through the foot up to the leg. The complex structure of the hoof is designed to absorb this impact, preventing injury. The internal hoof structure also aids circulation. When a horse is ridden, the weight of the rider adds to the force absorbed by the legs and feet. Poor conformation of the feet may lead to uneven or ineffective distribution of these impacts, in some cases increasing the risk of injury. Therefore, the hoof conformation is important to soundness. Toe-Out/Splay Footed * The horse's feet are turned away from each other * Common fault * Causes winging motion that may lead to interfering injury around fetlock or splint. * As horse wings inward, there is a chance that he may step on himself, stumble, and fall. * A horse that is ‚Äútied in behind the elbow‚Äù has restricted movement of the upper arm because there is less clearance for the humerus (it angles into the body too much). Reduced clearance of legs causes horse to toe-out to compensate. Toe-In, Pigeon-Toed * Toes of hooves face in toward each other * Common fault * Pigeon-toes cause excess strain on the outside of the lower structures of the limb as the horse hits hard on the outside hoof wall. This often leads to high or low ringbone. The horse is also predisposed to sidebone and sole bruising. * The horse moves with a paddling motion, wasting energy and hastening fatigue so that he has less stamina. Base narrow in front. Base Narrow in Front: Toed-Out or Toed-In * The feet are closer together and more under the body than the shoulders * Fairly common fault * Base-narrow, toed-out: Stresses the outside structures of the limb, especially the outside of the foot. Causes a winging motion, leading to interfering. Predisposes the horse to plaiting. The horse tends to hit himself more when fatigued. * Base narrow, toed-in: Excessive strain on the lateral structures of fetlock, pastern, and outside of hoof wall. Causes the horse to paddle. * The horse is least suited for speed or agility sports. Base Wide in Front: Toed-In or Toed-Out * The horse stands with its feet placed wider at the shoulders, often associated with a narrow chest. * Uncommon fault * Base wide, toed-out: the horse lands hard on the outside of the hoof wall and places excessive strain on the medial structures of the fetlock and pastern, leading to ringbone or sidebone, & potentially spraining structures of the carpus. The horse will wing in, possibly leading to an interference injury or overload injury of the splint bone. * Base wide, toed-in: the horse lands hard on the inside hoof wall, placing stress on the medial structures of limb. The horse will also paddle. Stands Close Behind/Base Narrow Behind * With a plumb line from the point of buttock, the lower legs & feet are placed more toward the midline than the regions of hips & thigh, with a plumb line falling to the outside of the lower leg from the hock downward. Usually accompanied by bow- legged conformation. * A fairly common fault, especially in heavily muscled horses like Quarter Horses. * The hooves tend to wing in, so the horse is more likely to interfere. If the hocks touch, they may also interfere. * The horse can't develop speed for rapid acceleration. * The outside of the hocks, fetlocks, & hooves receive excessive stress & pressure. This leads to DJD, ligament strain, hoof bruising, & quarter cracks. * The horse is best for non- speed sports & those that don't require spins, dodges, or tight turns \\\\---- The Hoof Feet Too Small * Relative to size and body mass, the feet are proportionately small * There is a propensity to breed for small feet in Thoroughbreds, Saddlebreds, and American Quarter Horses. * A small foot is less capable of diffusing impact stress with each footfall than a larger one. * On hard footing, the foot itself receives extra concussion. Over time, this can lead to sole bruising, laminitis, heel soreness, navicular disease, and ringbone. Sore-footed horses take short, choppy strides, so they have a rough ride and no gait efficiency. * If the horse has good shoeing support, it can comfortably participate in any sport, although it is more likely to stay sound in sports that involve soft footing. Feet Large and Flat/ Mushroom-Footed * Large in width & breadth relative to body size & mass. May have slight pastern bones relative to large coffin bone. * Flat feet limit the soundness of the horse in concussion sports (jumping, eventing, steeplechase, distance riding). * Without proper shoeing or support, the sole may flatten. Low, flat soles are predisposed to laminitis or bruising. The horse takes on a choppy, short stride. It is hard for the horse to walk on rocky or rugged footing without extra protection on the hoof. * A large foot with good cup to sole is ideal foot for any horse. There is less incidence of lameness, and it is associated with good bone. * For flat footed horses, sports with soft footing and short distances like dressage, equitation, flat racing, barrel racing are best. Mule Feet * Horse has a narrow, oval foot with steep walls * Mule feet are fairly common, usually seen in American Quarter Horses, Arabians, Saddlebreds, Tennessee Walkers, Foxtrotters, and Mules * A mule foot provides little shock absorption to foot & limb, creating issues like sole bruising, corns, laminitis, navicular, sidebone, and ringbone. Not all horses have soundness issues, especially if they are light on the front end & have very tough horn. * Because the hind end provides propulsion, it is normal to see more narrower hooves on back compared to front * Soft-terrain sports like polo, dressage, arena work (equitation, reining, cutting), and pleasure riding are most suitable Coon-Footed * The slope of hoof wall is steeper than the pastern, often associated with long, sloping pasterns tending to the horizontal, which breaks the angulation between pastern and hoof. Usually seen in rear feet, esp in post-legged horses. Coon feet are sometimes due to a weak suspensory that allows the fetlock to drop. * Quite uncommon, it particularly affects speed sports and agility sports * Coon feet create similar problems as too long & sloping pasterns (the horse prone to run-down injuries on back of fetlock). If foot lift off is delayed in bad footing, ligament and tendon strain & injury to the sesamoid bones is likely. * Weakness to supporting ligaments due to post leg or injury to suspensory will result in a coon-foot as the fetlock drops. * The horse is most suited for low-speed exercise like pleasure riding or equitation Club Foot * The slope of the front face of hoof exceeds 60 degrees. Horse often has long, upright heels. May be from contracture of DDF (deep digital flexor tendon) that was not addressed at birth or developed from nutritional imbalances or trauma. * Fairly common, best to use horse in activities done in soft-footing & those that depend on strong hindquarter usage * Various degrees of angulation, from slight to very pronounced. Horses with obvious club feet land more on the toes, causing toe bruising or laminitis. The horse generally does poorly at prolonged exercise, especially if on hard or uneven terrain (eventing, trail riding). * Because the toe is easily bruised, the horse moves with a short, choppy stride, and may stumble. The horse is a poor jumping prospect due to trauma incurred on impact of landing. Contracted Heels * The heels appear narrow and the sulci of frogs are deep while the frog may be atrophied * May be seen in any breed, but most common in American Quarter Horses, Thoroughbreds, Saddlebreds, Tennessee Walkers, or Gaited horses * Contracted heels are not normally inherited, but a symptom of limb unsoundness. A horse in pain will protect the limb by landing more softly on it. Over time, the structures contract. The source of pain should be explored by a vet. * Contracted heels create problems like thrush. The horse loses shock absorption ability, potentially contributing to the development of navicular syndrome, sole bruising, laminitis, and corns. Heel expansibility may also be restricted, causing lameness from pressure around the coffin bone and reduced elasticity of the digital cushion. * Horse is best used for non-concussion sports. Thin Walls * Wall is narrow and thin when viewed from bottom. Often associated with flat feet or too small feet. * Common, especially in American Quarter Horses, Thoroughbreds, and Saddlebreds. * Thin walls reduce the weight-bearing base of support, and are often accompanied by flat or tender soles that easily bruise. The horse is subject to developing corns at the angles of the bar. The horse tends to grow long- toes with low heels, moving the hoof tubules in horizontal direction, and so it reduces shock absorption ability and increases the risk of lameness. * Less integrity for expansion and flexion of hoof, making it more brittle and prone to sand & quarter cracks. Narrow white line makes it hard to hold shoes on. * Horse does best when worked only on soft footing. Flared Hoof Wall * One side of the hoof flares towards its bottom, relative to the steep appearance of the other side. Flared surface is concave. * Horse is best to use in low-impact or low-speed sports * May be conformationally induced from angular limb deformity or malalignments of the bones within the hoof. These conformational problems cause excess strain on one side of hoof making it steepen, while the side with less impact grows to a flare. The coronary band often slopes asymmetrically due to pushing of hoof wall & coronet on steep side, which gets more impact than flared. May develop sheared heels, causing lameness issues, contracted heels & thrush. * May be acquired from imbalanced trimming methods over time that stimulate more stress on one side of foot. * Chronic lameness may make the horse load the limb unevenly, even if the lameness may be in hock or stifle. ==Overall balance and bone== Insufficient Bone * Measuring the circumference of the top of the cannon bone, just below the knee, gives an estimation of the substance. Ideally a 1,000 lb horse should have 7-8 inches. Insufficient is less than 7 inches for every 1,000 lb of weight. * A horse with insufficient bone is more at risk for injury (within the bones, joints, muscle, tendons, ligaments, and feet). * Repeated impact creates soundness issues, especially in those sports with a lot of concussion (jumping, galloping, racing, long-distance trail). Track horses get bucked shins, event and trail horses get strained tendons and ligaments. Light-framed Thoroughbred Light-Framed/Fine Boned * Substance of long bones is slight and thin relative to the size & mass of the horse. Especially noticed in the area of the cannon & pastern. * Seen especially in show horses, halter horses in non-performance work, Paso Finos, Gaited horses, and Thoroughbreds. * Affects the longevity of hard-working performance horses. * See ‚Äúinsufficient bone.‚Äù Doesn't provide ample support for bulky musculature & there is a lack of harmony visually. * Theoretically, a lighter frame reduces the weight on the end of the limbs, making it easier to pick up the legs & move freely across the ground. However, with a lot of speed & impact work, light bone suffers concussion injury, leading to bucked shins, splints, & stress fractures. Tendons, ligaments, & muscles have less lever system to pull across to effectively use or develop muscle strength for power & stamina. * It is best to match the horse with a petite & lean rider. It is best to use the horse for pleasure, trail, driving, non-impact sports, and non-speed work. Coarse-Boned/Sturdy-Framed * Overall bones are larger, wider, & stronger in a horse with either light or bulky muscled appearance. * Advantageous for any sport, the horse tends to hold up well. * The horses tend to be rugged and durable, capable of carrying large weights relative to size. * Big, solid bones provide strong levers for the muscles to pull against to improve efficiency of motion, thus minimizing the effort of exercise & reduces the likelihood of fatigue, contributing to endurance. May add mass to each leg, and consequently slightly hinder speed. Withers higher than croup. Withers Higher than Croup * The peak of the withers is higher than the peak of the croup when the horse is square. * This is commonly but incorrectly referred to as built uphill. True uphill build refers to the spine and is very advantageous in dressage, eventing, etc. as the horse has an easier time engaging the hind end. High withers give the false visual of an uphill build. * Many breeds characteristically have high and prominent withers, such as the TB. In these horses the withers may be higher than the croup giving the impression of an uphill build while the horse's actual spine levelness is downhill. * Common in well-built warmbloods. A \\"croup-high\\" horse. Withers Lower than Croup/Rump High/Downhill Balance * The peak of the croup is higher than the peak of the withers. This is less desirable than a horse with higher withers. * Seen in any breed but especially in Thoroughbreds, Standardbreds, and Quarter Horses. * Young horses are usually built this way. * More weight is placed on the forehand, reducing the front- end agility. Muscles must work harder to lift the forehand, leading to muscular fatigue. It is difficult to raise the forehand at the base of a jump for liftoff. At speed, more work of loins, back & front end is needed to lift the forelimbs. * Increases concussion on the front legs, so the horse is at greater risk of front-end lameness. * Tends to throw the saddle & rider toward the shoulders, leading to chafing, pressure around withers, & restricted shoulder movement. Too Tall or Too Short (in context to rider) This horse is too tall for this specific rider. * The height of the horse is dependent on the size of its intended rider, but does not affect the overall bone structure and balance of the horse. Each rider should be paired with a horse that is proportional to their body structure. ==See also== *Glossary of equestrian terms ==References== Category:Horse anatomy ","title":"Equine conformation"},{"id":"2227563","text":"Tiddy Mun was a legendary bog spirit in Lincolnshire, England, who was believed to have the ability to control the waters and mists of The Fens of South Lincolnshire and The Carrs of North Lincolnshire. ==Legend== The belief in Tiddy Mun was first documented in June 1891 in an article by M. C. Balfour in the Folklore Society journal Folk-Lore. In the article she recalls a story, collected in the Ancholme Valley, told to her by an older person who spoke of a curse of pestilence that had been cast upon his village by the Tiddy Mun, who was angered at the draining of the Fens by the Dutch, led by Cornelius Vermuyden, in the seventeenth century. According to the story the Tiddy Mun was eventually placated after the villagers gathered at twilight at the time of the new moon, poured buckets of water into the dyke and apologised for the damage caused. He was not exclusively malevolent; if the Fens flooded and the waters reached the villages, people would go out at night and call Tiddy Mun wi'out a name, tha watters thruff! (\\"Tiddy Mun without a name, the water's through!Peacock, E (1889) A Glossary of Words used in the Wapentakes of Manley and Corringham, Lincolnshire. English Dialect Society: Trubner page 562\\") until they heard the cry of a peewit, and the next morning the waters would have receded. In his 1987 Folklore paper \\"Tiddy Mun's Curse and the Ecological Consequences of Land Reclamation\\", Darwin Horn argues that all but one of Tiddy Mun's specific curses may be connected to misfortune and disease brought about by the effect of draining the fenland. ==Description== The Tiddy Mun was described, by folklorist M.C. Balfour in 1891, as being no bigger than a three-year-old child, but looking like an old man with long, tangled white hair and a matted white beard. He is said to have worn a grey gown so that at dusk he was difficult to see. His laughter was said to resemble the call of the peewit. ==The Tiddy people== Writing in 1955, folklorist E. H. Rudkin also records another Ancholme Valley belief of an imp-like race of beings who were generally considered mischievous but benevolent. They were 'called the Tiddy people', but also the Strangers, Greencoaties and Yarthkins. The 'Tiddy' name related to their size and Rudkin quotes a source describing them: 'They be tiddy critturs, no more than a span high, wi' arms an' legs as thin as thread, but great big feet an' hands, an' heads rollin' aboot on their shoulders'. The Tiddy people would dance, by moonlight, on large flat stones, known as Strangers Stones, found in the area. Rudkin records a local tradition of smearing the stones with blood and lighting fires on them, but was unable to determine a meaning, or specific belief, behind the practice. The first of the crops would also be left on the Strangers Stones, as well as bread and salt, to keep the Tiddy people happy and ensure a good harvest. ==References in popular culture== * In Caliban and the Fen Demons of Lincolnshire: The Englishness of Shakespeare's Tempest, Dr Todd Andrew Borlik identifies Tiddy Mun as a possible inspiration for Caliban in William Shakespeare's The Tempest. ==References== Category:English legendary creatures Category:History of Lincolnshire Category:Lincolnshire folklore Category:Water spirits ","title":"Tiddy Mun"},{"id":"2227569","text":"Game being played at Fairchild Air Force Base. CRUD, (also known as \\"Slosh‚Äù, \\"Remiball\\", ‚ÄúGoonball‚Äù, or ‚ÄúMolliball\\") is a fast-paced game loosely based on billiards or pool, and originated in the Royal Canadian Air Force. It is played in units of the Canadian Armed Forces, the Canadian Coast Guard, the United States Air Force, the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps, the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force. The game is played on an old pool or snooker table (usually the latter, when available) using the cue ball (the shooter ball), and one object ball (most commonly a striped ball since it is easiest to determine if it is in motion). Playing Crud on a new or good condition table may get you banned from the Mess. Pool cues are not used; the shooter ball is launched across the table surface with the hand. A game of crud involves moving around the table and other players, trying to grab the shooter ball and either strike the object ball before it stops moving or sink it. ==Rules== CRUD is a competitive, team sport. Each member of the two teams normally has three lives. A team's order of play is established at the beginning of a game and recorded on the scoreboard. A team must play in order, like baseball's batting order. Anyone caught playing out of turn loses a life. In the event of an uneven number of players wishing to be involved with a crud match, a \\"ghost\\" may be assigned to a team missing the required number of players. Losing a life will instead damage the ghost, regardless of which player on the team loses it. Once the ghost loses 3 lives, it is gone and play resumes as normal.http://regimentalrogue.com/srsub/rules_crud.htm There will be at least one referee or judge, who is usually positioned centered on one of the long sides. If the referee is holding a drink and is bumped/jostled in such a way as to spill it, the offending player loses a life and must replace the beverage. In addition, a scorekeeper is sometimes used to keep track of lives lost. The referee's rulings are final. Arguing with the referee is authorized; however, intelligence and sportsmanship may become suspect if it continues unabated. Continual quibbling may be penalized by the loss of a life. Above all else, crud is a gentleman's game. ===The Lag=== The game opening event used to determine which team has choice. From the Shooter End, Team Captains simultaneously release a ball so that it touches the opposite short side of the table. The ball that returns closest to the Shooter end without touching it or the side rails determines choice of shooting or receiving. If neither player can keep the lag within the legal limits after 3 attempts, other players may try again, or a coin will be flipped. ===The Serve=== The opening event of each Round. With the Object Ball spotted on the center line 6 inches (152 mm) from the Receiver end of the table, the Shooter is given 3 attempts to hit the spotted Object Ball using any number of bumper bounces. Shooter Ball movement may only be stopped by the Judge or the Shooter. Any Service where the Shooter Ball goes beyond half the length of the Table will be counted as 1 attempt. If he/she does not manage to hit the object ball or the object ball does not travel 6 inches within 3 attempts, the shooter is assessed a life. Neither the defender nor anything on his/her person (i.e. clothing) may touch the object ball once it is set or in motion nor the shooter ball until it has struck the object ball or play has been declared over. An infraction of this rule ends play and the player is assessed a life. (Exception - see shooter ball leaving the table). Once the shooter ball strikes the object ball, the defender becomes the shooter and the next player from team A becomes the defender. The previous shooter must vacate the playing area without affecting play in any way. Any time a life is lost for any reason play stops and is restarted with a serve - the team which lost a life receiving (Exception - last player on a team is never obliged to serve unless both teams are down to their last player. A single player left against a team of several is called 'a runner' and always has the option to serve or receive regardless of which team loses a life). ===Play=== Once continuous play has commenced with the object ball moving at least six inches, the next shooter picks up the shooter ball from anywhere she can reach it and attempts to strike the object ball before it stops moving. If possible, the shooter will attempt to sink the object ball in one of the available pockets. The shooter may move around the table to grab the shooter ball and may move back and forth to either end to shoot. The shooter may crawl or roll or jump over the table while moving provided that his feet do not touch the felt surface. Contact between the feet and the felt surface ends play and the offending shooter loses a life. There is no limit to the number of misses a player can make as long as the object ball remains in motion. When attempting a shot, the Shooter must keep one foot on the floor at all times. If both feet end up off the floor, the Shooter forfeits a life. The shooter may only make contact with the object ball by throwing the shooter ball from one of the short ends of the table, not from the sides. The validity of a shot at the end of the table is determined by the location of the player's crotch with respect to an imaginary 45¬∞ line drawn (or extension of long side imaginary line -ACPA) from the corners of the table. Failing to be within the end of the table while shooting the shooter ball is a foul, called 'Balls' (or 'Lips' if female), and the offending player is assessed a life. If the player is unable to hit the object ball with the shooter before the object ball stops moving (dead ball) he/she loses a life. If the object ball is sunk by team A in one of the legal pockets (a kill), a life may be assessed on either the previous shooter or the next shooter on team B, depending on who allowed the object ball to be killed; determination is solely within the discretion of the Judge, but is usually assessed against the player who last held the shooter ball (ie if the next shooter has already grabbed the shooter ball, he loses a life - otherwise the previous player on her team loses the life). The shooter ball is then passed to the next player (in this case the next shooter on team B) to serve. Legal pockets - house rules vary as to which pockets are allowed for kill shots. Sinking the object into the pockets at the same end as the shooter (close corners) being quite easy, variants which allow this turn the game into a more tactical attempt to keep the object ball in the centre of the table. Game which disallow close corners tend to see more violent shots and faster moving balls. Some house rules disallow the side pockets. Toilet paper rolls may be used to block disallowed pockets or if the pockets are open, sinking the object ball into a disallowed pocket costs the shooter a life. \\"No Six\\" ‚Äì Whenever the Object Ball is hit, it must travel 6 inches, including bumper bounce, except in the cases of the \\"Double Kiss, Dead.\\" The Judge will determine the distance of travel based on his judgment of where the Object Ball was last hit. If full travel is less than 6 inches, center-ball to center-ball, the Life is against the last Shooter. While taunting an opponent is legal, fun, and generally encouraged, players may not physically interfere with each other or either ball (exception - shooter ball leaves the table). Interference calls may result in the referee warning the offender, or assessing the offending blocker a life. Stationary blocking is permitted provided that the player holds onto the table with both hands. Light body checks by the shooter in order to jockey for position are permitted. If the body check is excessive in the eyes of the referee, the shooter may be warned or assessed a life. The level of physical contact between team members may be waived to any level deemed appropriate by the referee in coordination and agreement of both teams involved in the match. The shooter must be given a reasonable opportunity to acquire the shooter ball. \\"Blocking\\" ‚Äì When blocking has been allowed, the Shooter has the primary right to the table. The Shooter has a right to get to the Shooter Ball without being blocked by the Defender. The Shooter has a right to make a shot. In some cases, the Shooter will need to go around a Defender who is up against the side of the Table. Inadvertent or accidental Blocking, as determined by the Judge, will not be held against the Defender. The Defender's team has blocking rights based on the following: \\\\-- A blocker must hold onto the side portion of the Table. \\\\-- Once established in a position to block, a blocker may not move his feet to re- establish another position as the Shooter moves around the Defender. If the Shooter moves to the other end of the table, this rule then applies at that end. The shooter may run over, under, around or through blockers (knocking them aside) though the judge may rule that excessive violence has been used and penalize the shooter with a life. Blockers may not retaliate against a shooter who uses fair roughness against them and may not move once set in position. The shooters team-mates may not attempt to clear blockers but may assist him by, for example, lifting him over blockers. \\"F.O.D.\\" ‚Äì Any Foreign Object Debris that falls or spills onto the playing surface. A piece of attached clothing will not constitute F.O.D. unless it touches one of the Balls during play. Whereas it may be necessary for a Shooter to transit the playing surface to retrieve or shoot the Shooter Ball, a player's shoes or feet may not touch the playing surface or bumpers. The Defender may not be on or somehow resting on the playing surface when anticipating a Shooter's play. ===Losing Players=== When a player loses all three lives, that player must withdraw from the match. Order of play is adjusted accordingly, with play still alternating between the two teams regardless of how many survivors are playing. IE: the last survivor could alternate between several opponent players. It is customary for the first player out to procure a beverage of choice for the referee as penalty for their lack of finesse in the game. It is also customary for the second player out to procure a beverage for the lineman/scorekeeper (as used in play). The third player should procure a beverage for the scorekeeper if a lineman is employed. ===Single-man Rules=== Single-man rules apply only when one team has only one player remaining. If both teams are down to one player, then normal rules apply. For the sake of simplicity, the team with the single man is referred to as team A and the opposing team as team B. #Team A has the choice to serve or defend on the serve. #While defending, team B may not make any contact with the player on team A, but may visually obstruct, harass, or otherwise distract team A. #While defending, team A is permitted to make contact with team B in accordance with any applicable combat rules (see below). (ACPA rules differ somewhat. ) ===Other Rules=== \\"Ball off the Table\\" ‚Äì When the Shooter Ball is shot so vigorously that it causes the object ball to leave the playing surface the shooter loses a life. Exception - if the object ball bounces off anything, including a player, and returns to the table, play continues. No player may intentionally knock the object ball back into play (penalty is a life). Contact with a player must be accidental. In cases of doubt the referee will decide whether contact was accidental or intentional. When the shooter ball leaves the table, play continues. The shooter must retrieve the shooter ball wherever it is and return to the table to resume play. The shooter's team- mates may assist him by retrieving the ball and passing / throwing it to her (only when it has clearly left the table and struck the floor or a wall etc). The defender's team may not interfere with attempts to retrieve the shooter ball except by blocking with both hands on the sides of the table (if blocking has been allowed before the start of play) or by kicking the shooter ball (they may, for example, attempt to kick it out of the room). Under no circumstances shall anyone make contact with the Judge, Ass't Judge, or scorekeeper or spill their drinks. Anyone doing so will be assessed a life and/or be required to purchase the offended party a replacement drink at the bar. ===Winning=== When a team loses all of its players the match is over and the other team is declared the victor. The players of the losing team are required to buy their counterparts a beverage of their choice. If there is a member on the winning team with all three lives intact, said team member is also called a crudmaster. ==Combat Crud== When teams agree to allow full body checking and blocking similar to what one finds in ice hockey (combat crud) rank is left out of the game. Junior officers are allowed to knock over more senior officers without any disciplinary repercussions, just as in any contact sport. This version is therefore quite popular among subalterns. ==Variations== There are many variants on these rules, including the degree to which contact is allowed (for example, full contact, no contact, or contact so long as the blocker is stationary). Check the rules posted on the wall at your establishment; however, reading the rules or mouthing the words while reading the rules may cost you a life (local rules vary). A dominant variation of crud is also played under many names. In this variation, the game is played on regular-sized pool tables, but every man is for himself/herself (no teams) and the object ball must be struck from the opposite end of the table. All six pockets are in play. The game has also spread under the name \\"Balls\\" and may be played with two opponents (singles), three opponents in free-for-all (triples) or with two teams of two (doubles). If the game is played in doubles, the teams are diagonal players, who usually remain stationary. Games play up to 11 points (win by 2) assessed to an entire team instead of lives assessed to individual players. In singles or doubles, a team scores a point when the ball dies while in the possession of the other team (a sunk ball is dead). In doubles, either team member may strike during a team's possession. In triples, points are strikes assigned to the next player in the striking order (when any of the three players has at least 11 strikes and two more than either of the other players, they are eliminated and the game follows doubles rules). Service is always provided by the team who did not gain a point on the previous play, except in the case of an imminent loss (next point would be a loss). The striker ball leaving the table is not a foul, and the game remains in play. ==Shuck== Shuck utilizes the same two-ball system and many of the rules of crud, but does not employ a referee ‚Äì it is geared towards casual home and bar play. Rules not mentioned below are generally acquired from crud. Basic concept: Two teams of two players each. Unlike crud, there is no rotation of turns, instead all 4 players are involved in every point and either player on a team can grab the cue ball during the play of a point, but no player can ever reach over the center of the table to grab the cue ball; one team may shoot several times in a row. First team to 11 points wins, losing team takes a shot. The opening serve comes from either player on the serving team. The server gets only two attempts to hit \\"the object ball\\" otherwise the opposing team receives a point and control of the serve. The cue ball must be rolled (not thrown) and either it or the object ball must hit a wall or be on pace to hit a wall following the serve for it not to be called a fault. The team that scored a point on the prior play always takes the next serve. Scoring: Once the object ball is moving it is like a \\"time-bomb\\" in the sense that when it stops moving the location of the cue ball on the table will (may) determine the winner of the point, i.e. if the cue ball is on your side of table when the object ball stops moving, you lose the point. The only variation to this is the \\"Gentleman's Rule\\" (see below). Making the ball: You score a point by making the object ball in one of the two corner pockets on your opponent's (i.e., the opposite) side of the table or by banking the ball into a side pocket or back into one of your own pockets. If, upon striking the object ball, it goes either directly into a side pocket or the pockets on your own side of the table then you lose the point (note: toilet paper to block the side pockets is an acceptable variation). If the cue ball goes into ANY pocket on your throw, you lose the point‚Äîwith one exception, the shuck, explained below. Gentleman's rule: If the ball is coming to a stop and you throw (roll) the cue ball at it but miss and the ball stops, it does not matter what side of the table the cue ball is on, you still lose the point because you missed it (it's pretty obvious when it happens ‚Äì no complaining allowed). Also part of the Gentleman's Rule is that you cannot just simply roll/push the cue ball onto your opponent's side when the ball is slowing to a stop. This rule is both as complicated as it is critical to the gameplay, and those attempting to play may not quite understand it at first but it will become obvious soon after playing a couple of rounds (think \\"I Know It When I See It\\" from Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart's opinion in the landmark 1964 case involving what should or should not be considered obscene‚Äîyou'll just know it). Shuck: A rare and gutsy play for advanced players. If your opponent strikes the object ball and you believe it is going into your pocket (or banking into a side pocket or their own pocket), you can take the cue ball and \\"shuck\\" it at your opponent's corner pockets. If you sink the cue ball in their pocket before the object ball falls into a pocket, you have essentially stolen the point away from your opponent. Of course, if you attempt a shuck and sink the cue ball, but the object ball does not fall into a pocket then you lose the point. The Gentleman's rule is also employed if the object ball stops just short of a pocket as your shuck with the cue ball misses (i.e., you would still lose the point). ===H-O-R-S-E=== A more simple, popular variation is called H-O-R-S-E (or horse pool) or P-I-G (or pig pool), building on the rules of Tim. Like the H-O-R-S-E variation of basketball, each player has five lives (represented by letters of H-O-R-S-E). Like Tim, it is played on a six-pocket pool table, as individuals, and is particularly challenging because all shots must be released from the table end opposite the object ball. The defender of a served the ball is called the server. The server rolls the object ball horizontally from the shooter, from one side to the other. The server must roll the ball on the opposite end of the table between the first and third dot, from either the left or the right side of the shooter. A mis-serve is any ball rolled by the Server that goes out of the bounds of the first and third dot. Three mis- serves in a row results in a letter for the server. The shooter has three tries to hit the ball. If the ball is not tapped, the shooter gets a letter. If the ball is released from the near side of the table to the object ball, the shooter gets a letter. If the ball goes in a pocket, the next person in order gets a letter. Nobody gets a letter if the object ball goes in a pocket on a serve. This is called T-N-A. The Shooter may only T-N-A twice in a row; the third T-N-A results in a letter to the shooter. There is not a no six rule in H-O-R-S-E; the player is allowed to stop the object ball dead, if it is possible, resulting in a letter for the next player. The double-kiss rule is replaced with a double-tap rule, which reverses the order of play. A shooter who performs a double-tap does not play again; the player who was in order before that player must now play. The new order persists after play stops. (A double-tap does nothing in a two-person game.) Walking the table is never permitted, and the shooter must have at least one foot on the ground when shooting. There may or may not be a referee. The player who gains the last letter becomes the shooter, and the winner of a game becomes the shooter of the next game and may choose to start play in forward or in reverse order. ==References== Category:Games of physical skill Category:Finger billiards Category:Royal Canadian Air Force ","title":"Crud (game)"},{"id":"2227584","text":"Crud or CRUD may refer to: * Waste, dirt, feces, or something of poor quality * Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD), basic functions of a computer database * Crud (game), a game played on a billiard table * CRUD (radio station), a former radio station of Rochdale College in Toronto, Canada ==See also== * Crud Puppy, a fictional character ","title":"Crud"},{"id":"2227605","text":"Babukodi Venkataramana Karanth (19 September 1929 ‚Äì 1 September 2002) was a film and theatre personality from India. Throughout his life he was director, actor and musician of modern Indian theatre both in Kannada as well as Hindi, and one of the pioneers of Kannada and Hindi new wave cinema. He was born in Dakshina Kannada. He was an alumnus of the National School of Drama (1962) and later, its director. He has directed many successful plays and has directed award-winning works in Kannada cinema. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri. ==Biography== Born in Manchi, a village near Babukodi in Bantwal taluk of Dakshina Kannada district in 1929, Karanth's passion for theatre started at an early age. His first tryst with theatre was when he was in standard III ‚Äì he acted in Nanna Gopala, a play directed by P.K. Narayana. He then ran away from home and joined the legendary Gubbi Veeranna drama company where he worked alongside Rajkumar who also was starting out then as a novice. Gubbi Veeranna sent Karanth to Banaras to gain a Master of Arts degree, where he also underwent training in Hindustani music under Guru Omkarnath Thakur. Thereafter, along with his wife, Prema Karanth, Karanth set up \\"Benaka\\", one of Bangalore's oldest theatre groups. It is an acronym for Bengalooru Nagara Kalavidaru. Then, Prema took up a teaching job in Delhi and supported Karanth through the National School of Drama. He was to return the compliment after he graduated from the NSD, and eventually became its director. He later graduated from the National School of Drama (NSD), New Delhi, in 1962, then headed by Ebrahim Alkazi. Between 1969 and 1972, he worked as a drama instructor at the Sardar Patel Vidyalaya, New Delhi after which the couple returned to Bangalore. Here Karanth dabbled in some cinema as well as music and was involved with the likes of Girish Karnad and U.R. Ananthamurthy in these ventures. He then returned to the NSD, this time as its Director in 1977. As the director of NSD, Karanth took theatre to far-flung corners of India. He conducted several workshops in places far away as Madurai in Tamil Nadu. After his stint as the director of NSD, the Madhya Pradesh government invited him to head the Rangamandal repertory under the aegis of the Bharat Bhavan. After rendering yeoman service to the theatre scene in Madhya Pradesh between 1981 and '86, Karanth returned to Karnataka. It was alleged by the MP Police that he was having an affair with one actress-Vibha Mishra, where in a drunk state, he poured Kerosene over her, and burnt her. However, Vibha, after recovering from her injuries, gave a statement that proved Karanth's innocence and freed him from the charges of an attempt to murder. He was criticised bitterly by Women activists and was forced to move out of Bhopal. In 1989, the Karnataka government invited him to set up a repertory in Mysore, which he named Rangayana and headed until 1995.A genius of theatre The Hindu, 11 October 2002. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the late 1990s and died at 8 p.m. (IST) on 1 September 2002 in a private hospital in Bangalore. ==Legacy== Karanth entered the Kannada theatre scene in the late 1960s and early '70s. His entry brought about a sea change in Kannada theatre which then was steeped in the old, formal proscenium style. His plays like Jokumara Swamy, Sankranti, Huchu Kudure and Oedipus to name a few, which were directed in the early 1970s, were hailed as trendsetters. These plays touched upon all aspects of theatre like language, music, song, stylisation The innovative use of music was one Karanth's biggest contributions to theatre.\\"I would say this is an essential component of the Karanth legacy,\\" said Lakshmi Chandrashekhar, leading stage artist and theatre critic. One of Karanth's strengths was his ability to draw on classical, traditional and folk forms and fuse them in his compositions. His plays were less famous for design as for their musical content, which became part of the prose of theatre.\\" In 2010, at the 12th Bharat Rang Mahotsav, the annual theatre festival of National School of Drama, Delhi, a tribute exhibition dedicated to life, works and theatre of B.V. Karanth and Habib Tanvir was displayed. ==Plays of B. V. Karanth== Karanth directed over a hundred plays, more than half of which were in Kannada with Hindi close behind. He also directed plays in English, Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil, Punjabi, Urdu, Sanskrit and Gujarati. Hayavadana (by Girish Karnad), Kattale Belaku, Huchu Kudure, Evam Indrajit, Oedipus, Sankranti, Jokumara Swami, Sattavara Neralu, Huttava Badidare and Gokula Nirgamana are some of his most popular plays in Kannada. Of the forty or so plays he directed in Hindi, Macbeth (using the traditional Yakshagana dance drama form), King Lear, Chandrahasa, Hayavadana, Ghasiram Kotwal, Mrichha Katika, Mudra Rakshasa, and Malavikagni Mitra are some of the more popular ones. Karanth also revelled in directing children and directed several children plays like Panjara Shale, Neeli Kudure, Heddayana, Alilu Ramayana and The Grateful Man. ==Benaka== In 1974, Karanth started BeNaKa a repertory in Bangalore. Benaka was an acronym for Bengalooru Nagara Kalavidaru. Benaka stages several hugely popular plays like Hayavadana all across Karnataka and even overseas. At Benaka, Karanth also took a special interest in children's theatre and directed several plays with children. This group has been taken care of by Prema Karanth, Karanth's late wife and a noted theatre personality in her own right. She died on 29-10-07. ==Contribution to Madhya Pradesh theatre== Karanth was largely responsible for starting the new theatre movement in Madhya Pradesh. As director of the NSD, at the invitation of the Bharat Bhavan in Bhopal, he organized a training-cum-production camp in 1973. In the 1980s, he returned to set up the Rangmandal repertory in Bharat Bhavan. This was to be the first-ever repertory in the state and he became the main creative spirit behind the now-legendary Bharat Bhavan. Rangmandal, for the first time, folk professionals were used for training contemporary actors, and the repertory also included folk performers among its members. Apart from Hindi, plays were also produced in dialects such as Bundelkhandi, Malavi and Chhattisgarhi which created huge ticket-buying audiences for the Rangmandira. ==Contribution to Andhra Pradesh theatre== With the integration of Alarippu and National school of Drama-New Delhi, Karanth had contributed three great plays in Telugu.

The state was formed in 1976 when the former North-Eastern State was broken up. It originally included the area now in Gombe State, which became a distinct state in 1996. The Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University is located in the capital city Bauchi. Other educational institutions located in the state include Bauchi State University, Abubakar Tatari Ali Polytechnic and Federal Polytechnic, Bauchi. == Name == According to tradition, it was named for a hunter known as Baushe, who settled in the region before the arrival of Yakubu, the first traditional ruler of Bauchi emirate (founded 1800‚Äì10). In Hausa the word Bauchi means the land of freedom and tourism. Bauchi and Adamawa were the two main sources of freedom and tourism for the Fulani empire of Sokoto. ==History== What is now known as Bauchi was until 1976 a province in the then North-Eastern State of Nigeria. According to the 2006 census, the state has a population of 4,653,066. Bauchi State has gone through tremendous transformation over the years. The Ajawa language was spoken in Bauchi State, but became extinct between 1920 and 1940 as speakers switched to Hausa. at Ethnologue During the colonial era up to independence, it formed part of the Bauchi Plateau of the then Northern Region, until the 1967 state creation exercise, when the Bauchi, Borno, and Adamawa provinces constituted the former North-Eastern State. With the creation of Bauchi State in 1976, then comprising present Bauchi and Gombe State, it included 16 local government areas. The number of local government areas in the then Bauchi State was increased to 20 and later to 23. However, in 1997 when Gombe State was created out of Bauchi and additional local governments were created in the country, Bauchi State was left with 20 local government areas as shown below. Sharia law was adopted in June 2001. ==Local Government Areas== Bauchi State consists of twenty Local Government Areas (LGAs). They are: { class=\\"sortable \\" - ! LGA ! Area (km2) !

The state is bordered by seven states, Kano and Jigawa to the north, Taraba and Plateau to the south, Gombe and Yobe to the east and Kaduna to the west. Bauchi state is one of the states in the northern part of Nigeria that span two distinctive vegetation zones, namely, the Sudan savannah and the Sahel savannah. The Sudan savannah type of vegetation covers the southern part of the state. Here, the vegetation gets richer and richer towards the south, especially along water sources or rivers, but generally the vegetation is less uniform and grasses are shorter than what grows even farther south, that is, in the forest zone of the middle belt. The Sahel type of savannah, also known as semi-desert vegetation, becomes manifest from the middle of the state as one moves from the state's south to its north. This type of vegetation comprises isolated stands of thorny shrubs. On the other hand, the southwestern part of the state is mountainous as a result of the continuation of the Jos Plateau, while the northern part is generally sandy. The vegetation types as described above are conditioned by the climatic factors, which in turn determine the amount of rainfall received in the area. For instance, the rainfall in Bauchi state ranges between per annum in the south and only per annum in the extreme north. This pattern is because in the West Africa sub-region, rains generally come from the south as they are carried by the southwesterlies. There is therefore a progressive dryness towards the north, culminating in the desert condition in the far north. So also is the case in Bauchi state. Consequently, rains start earlier in the southern part of the state, where rain is heaviest and lasts longer. Here the rains start in April with the highest record amount of per annum. In contrast, the northern part of the state receives the rains late, usually around June or July, and records the highest amount of per annum. In the same vein, the weather experienced in the south and the north varies considerably. While it is humidly hot during the early part of the rainy season in the south, the hot, dry and dusty weather lingers up north. In addition to rainfall, Bauchi state is watered by a number of rivers. They include the Gongola and Jama'are rivers. The Gongola River crosses Bauchi state in Tafawa Balewa Local Government Area in the south and in Kirfi and Alkaleri Local Government Areas in the eastern part of the state, while the Jama‚Äôare River cuts across a number of Local Government Areas in the northern part of the state. Moreover, a substantial part of the Hadeja-Jama'are River basin lies in Bauchi state, which along with various fadama (floodplain) areas in the state provides suitable land for agricultural activities. These are further supported by the number of dams meant for irrigation and other purposes. These include the Gubi and Tilde-Fulani dams. There also lakes such as the Maladumba Lake in Misau Local Government Area that further provide the necessary conditions to support Agriculture. ==Population== Bauchi State has a total of 55 tribal groups in which Gerawa, Sayawa, Jarawa, Kirfawa, Turawa Bolewa, Karekare, Kanuri, Fa'awa, Butawa, Warjawa, Zulawa, Boyawa MBadawa, Hausa and Fulani are the main tribes. This means that they have backgrounds, occupational patterns, beliefs and many other things that form part of the existence of the people of the state. There are cultural similarities in the people's language, occupational practices, festivals, dress and there is a high degree of ethnic interaction especially in marriage and economic existence. Some of the ethnic groups have joking relationships that exist between them, e.g. Fulani and Kanuri, Jarawa and Sayawa, etc. The Durbar Festival is a major annual attraction. ==Languages== West Chadic language groups spoken in Bauchi State: *North Bauchi languages *South Bauchi languages Languages of Bauchi State listed by LGA: {  !

Its capital and largest city is Maiduguri. The state was formed in 1976 from the split of the North-Eastern State. Until 1991 it contained what is now Yobe State. The motto or slogan of the state is \\"Home of Peace\\". Borno is the homeland of the Kanuri people in Nigeria and several other ethnic groups. Borno has been the epicenter of the Islamist group Boko Haram since it began its insurgency in 2009. The conflict in Borno drew media attention in 2009 after clashes between Boko Haram and government security forces in which the founder of Boko Haram Mohammed Yusuf was reportedly captured alongside 300 of its members. Days later Mohammed Yusuf was announced dead after he reportedly attempted to escape from detention. After a decade of protracted conflict that has destroyed economic activities and normal life, the governor of the state Babagana Umara Zulum in 2019 commenced a multi-pronged strategy of his own recruiting 10,000 hunters with \\"voodoo powers\\" to help government forces rout the insurgents. ==History== Dancers in Borno state attire The state has a predominance of Kanuri people. Other ethnic groups such as Lamang, Babur/Bura and Marghi are also found in the southern part of the state. Shuwa Arabs are mainly the descendants of Arab people and is an example of the endurance of traditional political institutions in some areas of Africa, where the emirs of the former Kanem-Bornu Empire have played a part in the politics of this area for nearly 1,000 years.Barkindo, Bawuro, and Dierk Lange, ‚ÄòThe Chad Region as a Crossroads‚Äô, in General History of Africa, ed. by M Elfasi and I Hrbek (London: Unesco, Heinemann, 1988), III, 436‚Äì60. The current Kanemi dynasty gained control of the Borno Emirate in the early 19th century after the Fulani jihad of Usman dan Fodio. Conquered by Rabih in 1893, Borno was invaded by the British, French and Germans at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1902, the British officially incorporated Borno into the Northern Nigeria ProtectorateIkime, Obaro, ‚ÄòThe Fall of Borno‚Äô, in The Fall of Nigeria: The British Conquest (London: Heinemann Educational, 1977), pp. 178‚Äì84 and established a new capital at Maiduguri or Yerwa in 1907, which remains the capital to this day.Kawka, Rupert, From Bulamari to Yerwa to Metropolitan Maiduguri : Interdisciplinary Studies on the Capital of Borno State, Nigeria (K√∂ln: K√∂ppe, 2002). After Nigerian independence in 1960, Borno remained fairly autonomous until the expansion of the number of states in Nigeria to 12 in 1967. Local government reform in 1976 further reduced the power of the emirs of the former dynasty, and by the time of Nigeria's return to civilian rule in 1979, the emirs' jurisdiction has been restricted solely to cultural and traditional affairs. The emirs still exist, and serve as advisers to the local government. Mala Kachallah was elected governor of Borno State in 1999 under the flagship of the then APP(All Peoples Party) later ANPP. Ali Modu Sheriff was elected governor of Borno State in Nigeria in April 2003. He is a member of the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP). Ali Sheriff was the first governor in Borno state to win the seat two consecutive times. Boko Haram's insurgency began in 2009, with Borno being the worst-affected area. On 14 May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in northeastern Nigeria, including Borno State along with the neighboring states of Adamawa and Yobe. This happened after fighting between Boko Haram and the state armed forces killed 200 people in the town of Baga. A spokesman for the armed forces declared that the offensive would continue \\"as long as it takes to achieve our objective of getting rid of insurgents from every part of Nigeria.\\" In July 2014, Borno State governor Kashim Shettima said that \\"176 teachers had been killed and 900 schools destroyed since 2011.\\" After the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapping in April 2014, most schools in Borno State were closed.

The government readily took advantage of this by initiating and establishing a free trade zone at the border town of Maigatari in Niger. ==Topography== The state has a total land area of approximately 22,410 square kilometres. Its topography is characterized by undulating land, with sand dunes of various sizes spanning several kilometres in parts of the State. The southern part of Jigawa comprises the basement complex while the northeast is made up of sedimentary rocks of the Chad Formation. The main rivers are Hadejia, Kafin Hausa and Iggi Rivers with a number of tributaries feeding extensive marshlands in north-eastern part of the State. Hadejia ‚Äì Kafin Hausa River traverses the state from west to east through the Hadejia-Nguru wetlands and empties into the Lake Chad Basin. ==Vegetation== Most parts of Jigawa lie within the Sudan Savannah with elements of Guinea Savannah in the southern part. Total forest cover in the state is below national average of 14.8%. Due to both natural and human factors, forest cover is being depleted, making northern part of the state highly vulnerable to desert encroachment. The state enjoys vast fertile arable land to which almost all tropical crops could adapt, thus constituting one of its highly prized natural resources. The Sudan savannah vegetation zone is also made up of vast grazing lands suitable for livestock production. ==Population== The socio-cultural situation in Jigawa State could be described as homogeneous: it is mostly populated by Hausa/Fulani, who can be found in all parts of the state.http://www.onlinenigeria.com/map.gif Kanuri are largely found in Hadejia Emirate, with some traces of Badawa mainly in its Northeastern parts. Even though each of the three dominant tribes have continued to maintain its ethnic identity, Islam and a long history of inter- marriages have continued to bind them together. About 3.6 million people inhabit Jigawa State. Life expectancy as at 2001 was about 52 years with a total fertility rate of about 6.2 children per woman of childbearing age (a little above the national average). Although population of the state is predominantly rural (90%), the distribution in terms of sex is almost equal between male (50.8%) and female (49.2%). This pattern of population distribution is same across various constituencies and between urban and rural areas. The 2002 CWIQ Survey indicated that 45.2% of the population was made up of young people below the age of 15; 49.0% between the ages of 15 and 59 while 5.8% were people aged 60 and above. This survey reveals a dependency ratio of almost 1; meaning that there is almost one dependent to every economically active person in the population. Average household size was about 6.7 almost all of which were headed by males. About 60% of household heads were self- employed with agriculture as their main occupation, and nearly two-thirds of these households were monogamous families. The overall literacy rate was about 37% in 2002 (22 percent for women and 51 percent for men). School enrolment ratio is fairly high with very good improvements in the last few years, even though there is still clear disparity between boys and girls. Basic indicators for water supply sector show that access to potable water is over 90%, which is among the highest in the country. The 2002 CWIQ Survey however, indicated that while access to high quality safe drinking water (pipe born, hand pump boreholes and protected wells) is low at about 63%, nearly two-thirds of households have good means of sanitation. In terms of health services, about two-fifths of the population have access to medical services which is, however, higher in urban areas where access was found to be about 55%. The CWIQ Survey found that an average of 70% of those who consulted a health facility expressed satisfaction with the services provided. ==Languages== The Bade language is spoken in Guri LGA, the Warji language is spoken in Birnin Kudu LGA, and the Duwai language is spoken in Hadejia LGA. Major languages are Hausa and Fulani. ==Religion== 98.9% of the population in Jigawa State are Muslim, while 1.1% are Christians. ==Government== Jigawa State‚Äîcreated out of the old Kano State in August 1991‚Äîis one of the 36 states in Federal Republic of Nigeria. The agitation for the creation of the state was led by Malam Inuwa-Dutse, a former commissioner in the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources during the governorship of late Audu Bako, the governor of old Kano State (comprising present Kano and Jigawa states). By the 1999 Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria, the state comprises 27 local government councils, which are divided into 30 state constituencies, grouped into 11 federal constituencies and 3 senatorial districts. These 27 local government councils were further subdivided into 77 development areas by law No. 5 of 2004 of the State House of Assembly. In line with the democratic setting in the country, the governments at both the state and local government levels are elected, and comprise an executive with a unicameral legislature. The state legislature has 30 elected members each representing one of the state constituencies. To complete the state governance structure, there is an independent state judiciary as the third arm of government. The State Government administrative apparatus is organized into ministries, extra-ministerial departments and parastatals, which are located across the three senatorial districts in the state since 1999. This decentralized approach to governmental administrative structure was seen as a move towards stimulating economic activities socio- economic development and empowerment over a wider area since government is the largest employer, perhaps second only to agriculture. In addition, this was also seen as a way for spreading even development among major urban centers and a shift from ‚Äúcity-state syndrome‚Äù that obtained in the old Kano State. ==Local Government Areas== Jigawa State consists of twenty-seven (27) Local Government Areas, They are: * Auyo * Babura * Biriniwa * Birnin Kudu * Buji * Dutse * Gagarawa * Garki * Gumel * Guri * Gwaram * Gwiwa * Hadejia * Jahun * Kafin Hausa * Kaugama * Kazaure * Kiri Kasama * Kiyawa * Maigatari * Malam Madori * Miga * Ringim * Roni * Sule Tankarkar * Taura * Yankwashi ==Political economy== The economy of Jigawa State is largely characterized by informal sector activities with agriculture as the major economic activity. Over 80% of the population is engaged in subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Trade and commerce are undertaken on small and medium scale, especially in agric goods, livestock and other consumer goods. Other informal sector activities include blacksmithing, leather-works, tailoring services, auto repairs, metal works, carpentry, tanning, dyeing, food processing, masonry etc. Even though modern industrial sector is yet to gain a solid footing, the seed for their development was planted through establishment of small-scale industries particularly in areas of food processing and other agro-allied activities such as the Jigawa ethanol programme. These industries have been helped by the Information Communication Technology program initiated by the Saminu Turaki, the states former governor. 4 The Federal Office of Statistics, in 2001, classified Jigawa State among those with relatively high severity and incidence of poverty in the country, with a Gross Per Capita Income of N35, 000 per annum (US$290), which is below the National Average; till date Jigawa State is being rate among the poorest states in Nigeria. However, the 2002 Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) Survey indicated that over two- fifths of the population do not consider themselves poor. The State of infrastructure for economic development such as roads, electricity, telecommunication and information technology have recently witnessed tremendous improvements through massive rehabilitation and expansion works. With massive road rehabilitation projects already undertaken throughout the State during the last five years, coupled with efforts made towards power generation via Independent Power Platforms, and the Internet Broadband Project, investment climate in Jigawa State in terms of economic infrastructure is quite promising. ==Schools== Education in Jigawa state is progressing well. Currently the state has a Federal University which is situated in the state capital, Dutse and a state-owned University situated at Kafin Hausa Local Government Area of the state. There is also Federal Polytechnic in Kazaure and a number of Monotechnics across the state. Established in 2011, Federal University Dutse is fast growing with number of applicants rapidly growing. ==Relation with multilateral agencies== British support has provided the Jigawa State School of Midwifery in northern Nigeria with essential equipment as well as helping the teachers develop the curriculum and get accreditation for the programme. Government of Jigawa State relates very well with multilateral agencies in the country particularly the World Bank, UNDP, UNICEF, DFID and other international donor agencies and NGOs. Multilateral agencies have been a veritable source of development funds and technical assistance to State Government. Presently, the State partners with DFID, UNDP, UNICEF, IBRD, IFAD, ADF and some other International Development Agencies in pursuit of several development projects and programmes, particularly in the sphere of pro-poor growth, poverty reduction, education, and positive reform programmes such as Public Expenditure Management, Health Systems and Justice System Reforms. ==References * Jigawa Online * Nigeria News Category:States of Nigeria Category:States and territories established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in Nigeria ","title":"Jigawa State"},{"id":"2227638","text":"Katsina, usually referred to as Katsina State to distinguish it from the city of Katsina, is a state in North West zone of Nigeria.

The diameter of the aperture of the main objective is a common criterion for comparison among optical systems, such as large telescopes. The two traditional systems are mirror-systems (catoptrics) and lens-systems (dioptrics), although in the late twentieth century, optical fiber was introduced. Catoptrics and dioptrics have a focal point, while optical fiber transfers an image from one plane to another without an optical focus. Isaac Newton is reported to have designed what he called a catadioptrical phantasmagoria, which can be interpreted to mean an elaborate structure of both mirrors and lenses. Catoptrics and optical fiber have no chromatic aberration, while dioptrics need to have this error corrected. Newton believed that such correction was impossible, because he thought the path of the light depended only on its color. In 1757 John Dollond was able to create an achromatised dioptric, which was the forerunner of the lenses used in all popular photographic equipment today. Lower-energy X-Rays are the highest energy electromagnetic radiation that can be formed into an image, using a Wolter telescope. There are three types of Wolter telescopes Near infrared is typically the longest wavelength that are handled optically, such as in some large telescopes. ==References== Category:Optics Category:Telescopes ","title":"Image-forming optical system"},{"id":"2227643","text":"Kebbi is a state in north-western Nigeria with its capital at Birnin Kebbi. The state was created out of a part of Sokoto State in 1991. Kebbi State is bordered by Sokoto State, Niger State, Zamfara State, Dosso Region in the Republic of Niger and the nation of Benin. It has a total area of 36,800 km¬≤. ==History== Kebbi is traditionally considered by Sarki mythology as the homeland of the Banza bakwai states and Hausa Kingdoms. According to recent research based on local oral traditions, king lists and on the Kebbi chronicle, the state of Kebbi was founded towards 600 BCE by refugees of the Assyrian empire conquered by Babylonian and Median forces in 612 BCE. A major local event was the conquest by Songhai in the second half of the fifteenth century CE.D. Lange, \\"Successor state\\", Anthropos, 104, 2 (2009), 366-380.

Sokoto is located near to the confluence of the Sokoto River and the Rima River. As of 2005 it has an estimated population of more than 4.2 million. The name Sokoto (which is the modern/anglicised version of the local name, Sakkwato) is of Arabic origin, representing suk, \\"market\\". It is also known as Sakkwato, Birnin Shaihu da Bello or \\"Sokoto, Capital of Shaihu and Bello\\"). Being the seat of the former Sokoto Caliphate, the city is predominantly Muslim and an important seat of Islamic learning in Nigeria. The Sultan who heads the caliphate is effectively the spiritual leader of Nigerian Muslims. ==History== Since its creation as a state in 1976 (from the bifurcation of the erstwhile North-Western State (Map) into Sokoto and Niger States, Sokoto state has been ruled by governors, most ex-military officers, who succeeded each another at short intervals. Sokoto, as a region, knows a longer history. During the reign of the Fulani Empire in the 19th century Sokoto was an important Fula state, in addition to being a city, of what was then west central Nigeria. From ca. 1900, with the British take-over, Sokoto, which then encompassed the entire north-west corner of Nigeria, became a province of the British protectorate of Nigeria. Not long after Gando was added as a sub-province. This double province then covered an area of with an estimated population over 500,000. It included the then Zamfara and Argungun, or Kebbi, kingdoms. The following excerpt from the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica offers some information from the perspective of the occupying British power: In 1967, not long after Nigeria's independence from the British, the region became known as the Northwestern State. This territory was, in 1976, split into Sokoto State and Niger State. Later on, Kebbi State (1991) and Zamfara State (1996) split off from Sokoto State. ==Demographics== Sokoto State is mainly populated by Hausa people.http://www.onlinenigeria.com/map.gif Most Sokoto State residents are Sunni Muslims, with a Shia minority; violence between the two groups is uncommon. Over 80% of people living in the state practice agriculture. ==Climate== Sokoto State is in the dry Sahel, surrounded by sandy savannah and isolated hills. With an annual average temperature of , Sokoto is, on the whole, a very hot area. However, maximum daytime temperatures are for most of the year generally under and the dryness makes the heat bearable. The warmest months are February to April when daytime temperatures can exceed . The rainy season is from June to October during which showers are a daily occurrence. The showers rarely last long and are a far cry from the regular torrential rain known in wet tropical regions. From late October to February, during the cold season, the climate is dominated by the Harmattan wind blowing Sahara dust over the land. The dust dims the sunlight thereby lowering temperatures significantly and also leading to the inconvenience of dust everywhere in houses. The region's lifeline for growing crops is the floodplains of the Sokoto-Rima river system (see Sokoto River), which are covered with rich alluvial soil. For the rest, the general dryness of the region allows for few crops, millet perhaps being the most abundant, complemented by rice, corn, other cereals and beans. Apart from tomatoes few vegetables grow in the region. ==Cities and villagesLocal Government Areas== Sokoto State consists of twenty-three (23) Local Government Areas. They are: *Binji *Bodinga *Dange Shuni *Gada *Goronyo *Gudu *Gwadabawa *Illela *Isa *Kebbe *Kware *Rabah *Sabon Birni *Shagari *Silame *Sokoto North *Sokoto South *Tambuwal *Tangaza *Tureta *Wamako *Wurno *Yabo ==Sources== * Nigeria [map].

Its capital is Gusau and its current Governor is Bello Matawalle, a member of the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Until 1996, the area was part of Sokoto State. Zamfara is populated with the Hausa and Fulani peoples. Major groups of people are the Zamfarawa mainly in Anka, Gummi, Bukkuyum and Talata Mafara Local Governments areas. Gobirawa populated Shinkafi Local Government. Gobirawa actually migrated from the Gobir Kingdom. Burmawa are found in Bakura and Fulani peopled Bungudu, Maradun, Gusau and are scattered all over the State. In Tsafe, Bungudu and Maru Local Governments are mainly Katsinawa, Garewatawa and Hadejawa. While Alibawa peopled Kaura Namoda and Zurmi. The people of Zamfara have over the years struggled for autonomy, it was not until 1996 that the then military administration of the Late General Sani Abacha detached the Zamfara State from Sokoto State. With an area of 38,418 square kilometres, it is bordered in the North by Niger republic, to the South by Kaduna State. In the east, it is bordered by Katsina State and to the West by Sokoto and Niger States. It has a population of 3,278,873 according to the 2006 census and contains fourteen local government areas. ==History== The area today called Zamfara state was one of the old Hausa city-states like Kano, Katsina, Gobir, Kabi and Zazzau. The earliest inhabitants of Zamfara were said to have been hunters and giants. They established their first settlement at Dutsi which was the first capital of Zamfara. It extends up to the bend of River Rima to the north west and River Ka in the south west. Zamfara Kingdom was established in the 11th century and flourished up to 16th century as a city-state. Its capital has shifted with the fortunes of the kingdom from place to place like Dutsi and Birnin Zamfara. In the first half of the 18th century, its then capital Birnin Zamfara, was destroyed by the Gobir Kingdom and a new capital was established in Anka by the second half of the 19th century. Zamfara had many centers of commerce and scholarship that attracted many scholars like the Yandoto city. It became part of the Sokoto Caliphate after the 1804 jihad by Usman dan Fodio. In fact, Usman Danfodiyo settled in Sabon Gari where Sarkin Zamfara Abarshi had already established a garrison headquarters during the early days of his Jihad as a base from where fought Gobir and Kabi. At the wake of British colonialism, the emerging town of Gusau became an important commercial and administrative center with road and rail networks passing through it. With the creation of states during the Gowon Administration, Zamfara Kingdom became part of the then North West state and later the Sokoto State. ==Climate== The climatic condition of Zamfara is tropical, with temperatures rising up to and above between March to May. Rainy season starts in late May to September while the mild season known as Harmattan lasts from December to February. ==Local Government Areas== Zamfara State consists of fourteen (14) Local Government Areas. They are: ==Demographics== Zamfara State is mainly populated by Hausa and Fulani people, with some members of Gwari, Kamuku, Kambari, Dukawa, Bussawa and Zabarma ethnic communities.http://www.onlinenigeria.com/map.gif Others include the Igbo, Yoruba, Kanuri, Nupe and Tiv. The state capital is an important commercial center with a heterogeneous population of people from all over Nigeria. As in all major towns in Nigeria, all the major towns in Zamfara have a large population of other peoples from different parts of Nigeria. ==Languages== The Kainji languages C'Lela and Gwamhi-Wuri are spoken in Gummi LGA. Ut-Ma'in is also spoken in the state and in Kebbe, Sokoto State. Major languages are Hausa and Fulani. ==Economy== Agriculture and gold minning are the main occupations of the people of the state and the central source of income. Irrigation is required for cereals and legumes hence its slogan \\"farming is our pride\\". And also Home Of Shari'ah. ==Incidents== In 2009, gold mining became a greater source of income in Zamfara State as worldwide gold prices rose dramatically. High concentrations of lead in the ore from which gold was being extracted led to a lead poisoning epidemic in the state, requiring national and international intervention to remediate affected areas and provide medical care to children with severe lead poisoning. ==Religion== Islam is the principal and major religion of the state. Zamfara was the first state in Nigeria to introduce Sharia law during the regime of Ahmad Sani Yerima, the former Governor of the state. Christianity also has many adherents. The original native religions also remain but they have the fewest followers. These religions are mainly practiced in ancient settlements like Dutsi and Kwatarkwashi. ==Language== Hausa is the official language of the state. Other main languages spoken in Zamfara are English, French, Fulfulde, Arabic; minority populations also speak languages like: Yoruba and Igbo. ==See also== *States of Nigeria ==References * Official website of Zamfara State * Nigerian Post Office- with map of LGAs of the state Category:States of Nigeria Category:States and territories established in 1996 Category:1996 establishments in Nigeria ","title":"Zamfara State"},{"id":"2227671","text":"{ align=right   { align=\\"right\\"  align=\\"center\\"  Range  align=\\"center\\"  Tessitura - { \\\\set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1/8) ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } { \\\\clef treble d'\\\\glissando fis} } { \\\\set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 1/8) ew Staff \\\\with { \\\\remove \\"Time_signature_engraver\\" } {\\\\clef treble d'\\\\glissando d} } } } 'Habanera (music or dance of Havana, ) is the popular name for \\"'\\" (\\"Love is a rebellious bird\\"), an aria from Georges Bizet's 1875 op√©ra comique Carmen. It is the entrance aria of the title character, a mezzo-soprano role, in scene 5 of the first act. ==Background== The score of the aria was adapted from the habanera \\"El Arreglito ou la Promesse de mariage\\", by the Spanish musician Sebasti√°n Iradier, first published in 1863, which Bizet thought to be a folk song. When others told him he had used something written by a composer who had died 10 years earlier,Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed. 1954 he added a note of its derivation in the first edition of the vocal score which he himself prepared.Curtiss Mina, Bizet and His World. New York, Vienna House, 1958 p. 401. Although the French libretto of the complete op√©ra comique was written by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal√©vy, the words of the habanera originated from Bizet.Milnes, Rodney. Darkness and light in 'Carmen'. Glyndebourne Festival Opera 2002 programme book, p103.Dean has a photograph of Bizet's manuscript words as plate 8 between 118 and 119 of the 1977 paperback edition of his book. The Habanera was first performed by Galli-Mari√© at the Op√©ra-Comique on 3 March 1875. Bizet, having removed during rehearsals his first version of Carmen's entrance song, in with a refrain in , rewrote the Habanera several times before he (and Galli-Mari√©) were satisfied with it. ==Music== \\\\header { tagline = \\"\\" % removed } \\\\score { << ew Voice = \\"Carmen\\" { \\\\set Staff.vocalName = \\\\markup \\\\smallCaps Carmen \\\\clef treble \\\\time 2/4 \\\\key d \\\\minor R2 R2 R2 \\\\relative d { \\\\autoBeamOff r4 d8 cis \\\\tupletUp \\\\times 2/3 { c c c } b bes a8 a16 a gis8 g \\\\autoBeamOn \\\\times 2/3 { f16( g f) } e[( f)] \\\\autoBeamOff g8 f e8 \\\\autoBeamOn } } ew Lyrics \\\\lyricsto Carmen { L'a -- mour est un oi -- seau re -- bel -- le que nul ne peut ap -- pri -- voi -- ser. } ew Staff { \\\\set Staff.instrumentName = \\"Cello\\" \\\\clef bass \\\\time 2/4 \\\\key d \\\\minor { d,8-. r16 a,( f8-.) a,-. d,8-. r16 a,( f8-.) a,-. d,8-. r16 a,( f8-.) a,-. d,8-. r16 a,( f8-.) a,-. d,8-. r16 a,( f8-.) a,-. d,8-. r16 a,( f8-.) a,-. d,8-. r16 a,( f8-.) a,-. d,8-. } } >> } Although Bizet kept the basic layout of the Iradier song, which has each verse in D minor and each refrain in the tonic major, he let go of the long ritornelli and second half material, and by adding chromaticism, variations in the refrain and harmonic interest in the accompaniment, made it a memorable number.Dean, Winton. Bizet. The Master Musicians, JM Dent & Sons, London, 1975, pp. 251 & 229-230. The reharmonization, addition of triplets in the vocal line and the flute in its low register add to the effect. Despite the change in mode there is no actual modulation in the aria, and the implied pedal point D is maintained throughout. The vocal range covers D4 to F5 with a tessitura from D4 to D5. Although Bizet borrowed the melody from a song by Iradier he developed it \\"with his inimitable harmonic style and haunting habanera rhythm\\".MacDonald, Hugh. Carmen. In: The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Macmillan, London & New York, 1997. The orchestration for the number consists of the two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, timpani, triangle and tambourine, full strings, and pistons (for the final chord only).Georges Bizet.

The refrain also returns briefly at the end of the act, in scene XI, No.1 Final where Carmen hums it ('fredonnant') in the face of the lieutenant Zuniga. ==Libretto== Lyrics in parentheses are sung by the chorus.

Nothing to be done, threat or prayer, The one talks well, the other is silent, And it's the other that I prefer, He said nothing, but he pleases me. (Love is a rebellious bird) Love! (That none can tame,) Love! (And it is well in vain that one calls it,) Love! (Because it suits it to refuse.) Love! Love is a gypsy child, It has never, never known the law, If you don't love me, I love you, If I love you, be on your guard! (Be on your guard!) If you don't love me, If you don't love me, then I love you! (Be on your guard!) But if I love you, if I love you, Be on your guard! (Love is a gypsy child,) (It has never, never known the law,) (If you don't love me, I love you,) (If I love you, be on your guard!) (Be on your guard!) If you don't love me, If you don't love me, I love you! (Be on your guard!) But if I love you, if I love you, Be on your guard! (On guard!) The bird you hoped to catch Beat its wings and flew away, Love is far, you can wait for it; You no longer await it, there it is! All around you, swift, swift, It comes, goes, then it returns, You think to hold it fast, it flees you, You think to flee it, it holds you! (All around you, swift,) Love! (It comes, goes, then it returns,) Love! (You think to hold it fast, it flees you,) Love! (You think to flee it, it holds you!) Love! Love is a gypsy child, It has never, never known the law, If you don't love me, then I love you, If I love you, be on your guard! (Be on your guard!) If you don't love me, If you don't love me, then I love you! (Be on your guard!) But if I love you, if I love you, Be on your guard!

It was, however, administered separately by the Minister responsible for local government. With effect from 23 July 1982, Greater Accra was created by the Greater Accra Region Law (PNDCL 26) as a legally separate region. ==GeographyLocation and size=== The Greater Accra Region is bordered on the north by the Eastern Region, on the east by the Volta Region, on the south by the Gulf of Guinea, and on the west by the Central Region.

It is celebrated in remembrance of a great famine that hit the Ga people in the sixteenth century. It is mainly a food festival which celebrates the passing of that terrible period in Ga history. It takes place in August every year and is celebrated by all the Ga clans. The Adangbe people from Ada celebrate the Asafotu festival, which is also called 'Asafotufiam', an annual warrior's festival celebrated by Ada people from the last Thursday of July to the first weekend of August commemorates the victories of the warriors in battle and is a memorial for those who fell on the battlefield. To re-enact these historic events, the warriors dress in traditional battle dress and stage a mock battle. This is also a time for male rites of passage, when young men are introduced to warfare. The festival also coincides with the harvest cycle, when these special customs and ceremonies are performed. These include purification ceremonies. The celebration reaches its climax with a durbar of chiefs, a colourful procession of the Chiefs in palanquins with their retinue. They are accompanied by traditional military groups called 'Asafo Companies' amidst drumming, singing and dancing through the streets and on the durbar grounds. At the durbar, greetings are exchanged between the chiefs, libations are poured and declarations of allegiance are made. ===Other tourist attractions=== * Fishing port at Jamestown * Du Bois Memorial Center for Pan- African Culture * George Padmore Research Library on African Affairs * Agblobloshie Market * Makola Market * Trade Fair Center ==DemographicsPopulation=== The center of population of the Greater Accra region is located in the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area which comprises the Accra Metropolitan, Tema Metropolitan, Adenta Municipal, La Nkwantanang Madina Municipal District, Ashaiman Municipal, Ledzokuku-Krowor Municipal, Ga East Municipal, Ga West Municipal, and Ga South Municipal districts According to the 2010 census, the region had a population of 4,010,054, making it the second most populous (total number of people) region of Ghana behind the Ashanti Region.

They form the largest ethnic sub-group in the Greater Accra Region, with 18.9% of the population.Ga-Adangbe people The Ga peoples were organized into six independent towns (Accra (Ga Mashie), Osu, La, Teshie, Nungua, and Tema). Each town had a stool, which served as the central object of Ga ritual and war magic. Now, the town of La has a community bank which offers banking services to them. Accra became the most prominent Ga-Dangme towns and is now the heartbeat and capital of Ghana.[4] The Ga people were originally farmers, but today fishing and trading in imported goods are the principal occupations. Trading is generally in the hands of women, and a husband has no control over his wife's money. Succession to most offices held by women and inheritance of women's property are by matrilineal descent. Inheritance of other property and succession to male-held public offices are by patrilineal descent. Men of the lineage live together in a men's compound, while women, even after marriage, live with their mothers and children in a women's compound. Each Ga town has a number of different cults and many gods, and there are a number of annual town festivals. The Adangme people occupy the coastal area of Ghana from Le Kpone to Ada, on the Volta River and South Atlantic Ocean along the Gulf of Guinea and inland along the Volta River.

The party was defeated in the May 1956 UN plebiscite in British Togoland, which resulted in the unification of British Trans-Volta Togoland with Gold Coast, which later became independent as Ghana.Daniel Miles McFarland, Historical Dictionary of Ghana, 1985, p. 173 On 9 May 1956, a vote was conducted to decide the future disposition of British Togoland and French Togoland. The native and dominant ethnic group, the Ewe people, were divided between the two Togos. British Togoland inhabitants voted in favor of state union with the Gold Coast, and the Togo Ewe state was incorporated with Gold Coast. There was vocal opposition to the incorporation of Togoland into modern Ghana, from the Ewe people who voted (42%) against in British Togoland, as the Ewe wanted the unification of the Ewe people in British Togoland and French Togoland as a separate Ewe state (modern Togo).McLaughlin & Owusu-Ansah (1994), \\"The Politics of the Independence Movements\\". Recently, a campaign for the cessation of some part of the Volta Region from Ghana to be known as \\"Western Togoland\\" is being led by a group calling itself Homeland Study Group Foundation. The group is led by Charles Kormi Kudzodzi. ==Tourism== Theora video of Tagbo Falls in Hohoe, Hohoe Municipal, Volta region. ===Recreation areas=== ;Museum ;* Volta Regional Museum ===Mountains=== * Mount Afadja * Mount Adaklu * Mount Gemi ===Other Tourist Attractions=== ;Waterfalls * Tafi Agome Caves *Tafi Atome Monkey Sanctuary * Wli Waterfalls * Tagbo Falls * Amedzofe Falls * Biakpa Falls and Caves * Kpoeta waterfalls (at Ho West District) *Mount Afadja * Mount Gemi * Akpom Falls and limestone cave Logba Tota * Snake Village Liate Wote * Adidime waterfalls Klefe (at Ho Municipal) ==Notable native citizens== {  - ! colspan=3  Notable native citizens of Volta - ! # !

Released during the Cold War era, Raid Over Moscow is an action game in which the player (an American space pilot) has to stop three Soviet nuclear attacks on North America, then fight his way into and destroy a nuclear facility located in Moscow's Kremlin. According to the game's storyline, the United States is unable to respond to the attack directly due to the dismantlement of its nuclear arsenal. The game is famous in Finland due to the political effect of its content. A leftist member of the Finnish parliament went as far as to make a parliamentary question about whether it was acceptable to sell the game. The resulting debate and publicity made the game a top seller in the country. == Gameplay  First stage === Screen shot from the Commodore 64 version showing early gameplay The game opens with an alert that a nuclear missile has been launched from a Soviet city towards a North American city. The game begins in the hangar where the American spaceplanes are stored. The player has to safely fly the craft out. The view switches to the earth as seen from low Earth orbit, and the player guides the spaceplane to the city launching the attack. Alternatively, the player may decide to maneuver more of the available spaceships out of the space station before attacking the launch site; the surplus ships are docked outside the space station. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking, and the time before impact is continually displayed. The player has then to fly through the defense perimeter around the launch site missile silo, dodging obstacles, heat-seeking missiles, and Soviet tanks and planes. If successful, the player proceeds to the next screen; otherwise, the player has to start the next life back at the hangar, with the clock still ticking. However, should the player have spare spaceplanes parked outside the space station, the game continues with a new life at the current screen, skipping the flight from space station to the launch site. The decision to launch more than a single spaceship first may therefore save time if the player later loses a life. The final part of this stage involves destroying the missile silo while avoiding Soviet planes trying to shoot down the player. Destroying the primary missile silo in the center before the missile lands will thwart the attack. Destroying the secondary silos on either side of the primary earns extra lives and points. The Soviets launch a total of four missile attacks, from Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, and Saratov, all of which must be stopped in the same manner as the first. After the fourth launch, the player progresses to the second stage of the game. === Second stage === The State Historical Museum is used as a backdrop in the second stage of the game. The pilots become foot soldiers and are placed outside the front facade of the \\"Defence Centre\\", depicted as the State Historical Museum. Using a mortar they must blast open the correct door to the facility, randomly chosen from five available. Bonus points can be gained from this section by destroying parts of the building and defeating the troops stationed there. Once the door is open, the soldiers make their way to the nuclear reactor, and the final stage of the game. === Third stage === In this stage, the player has to destroy maintenance robots that feed coolant into the reactor. The number of robots is determined by the difficulty level chosen by the player. The player is provided with several disc grenades that he throws at the robot, which is moving and firing at him the entire time. The robot is reinforced at the front, so the only way to do any damage is to bounce the discs off the wall and hit the robot in the back. As the number of discs is limited, the player should attempt to catch returning discs which missed the robot. To successfully complete the game, all robots must be defeated, the final one within a two-minute time limit. If the robot is not destroyed within the limit the game is still considered complete, but with no survivors. == Releases == The game was first published for the Commodore 64 with Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari 8-bit, BBC Micro, and ZX Spectrum versions following. Upon reissue the game was retitled to Raid. An Amiga port was in development in the late 1980s but was cancelled along with Beach Head and Beach Head II: The Dictator Strikes Back when the developers were unable to secure a deal with the publisher, U.S. Gold. According to the graphical artist Adrian Cummings, the graphics were at that point \\"99.9% complete\\". However the coding was barely started. == Reception == Raid over Moscow was Access' second best-selling Commodore game as of late 1987, after Beach-Head. The game received generally positive reviews. Computer and Video Games praised the graphics and sound of the Commodore 64 version, while Crash gave the ZX Spectrum version an overall score of 92%. The theme of the game, nuclear war, was subject to questioning, however, with Computer and Video Games publishing several letters from readers arguing for and against its publication. Unauthorized copies of Raid on Moscow circulated widely in East Germany during the 1980s, despite the Stasi describing it as among those games having \\"a particularly militaristic and inhumane nature\\". The West German Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons added the game to its index in 1985, stating that \\"In older adolescents, playing (...) can lead to physical tension, anger, aggressiveness, agitated thinking, difficulty concentrating, headaches, etc.\\" The ban automatically ended in 2010. === Political crisis in Finland === The game was shortly presented in YLE's current affairs television programme A-studio on after being reviewed by the computer magazine MikroBitti. On the leftist newspaper Tiedonantaja published an article which criticized the review and called a ban on all similar \\"anti-USSR\\" games. Parliament member Ensio Laine (SKDL) left a parliamentary question for the Finnish government on the next day. The Soviet embassy at Tehtaankatu, Helsinki was the scene of part of the discussions concerning the game. The following days included various discussions between the Finnish foreign ministry and Soviet Union representatives. On , an unofficial petition was received from the USSR, asking for a ban on various books, articles and other media, including Raid Over Moscow, which were supposed to purport a distorted view on the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, on , Minister of foreign trade Jermu Laine answered the parliamentary question, claiming that the Finnish legislation only allowed to restrict the import on products that constitute a hazard on health. The foreign ministry thus was able to dodge possible claims of Finlandization by referring to unsuitable legislation. Finally, Minister of foreign affairs Paavo V√§yrynen gave an official answer to the petition on , expressing a friendly attitude towards the USSR and apologizing on behalf of negative publications about the country on the media. The USSR interpreted the game as military propaganda, but settled on the answer. As a result of the public debate, the game was the top selling Commodore 64 game in Finland from March to September 1985 according to MikroBitti. The full extent of the affair was unveiled in 2010, when the Finnish foreign ministry memos were declassified. ==References== * ==External links== * * * A remake of the game * Complete video from the C64 version at Archive.org and high quality playthrough video of the C64 version on YouTube Category:1984 video games Category:Cold War video games Category:Video games set in the Soviet Union Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Apple II games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:BBC Micro and Acorn Electron games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:U.S. Gold games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:ZX Spectrum games ","title":"Raid over Moscow"},{"id":"2227730","text":"Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway can refer to: *The portion of Interstate 5 in Oregon *The portion of Interstate 70 in Frederick County, Maryland *The portion of Interstate 287 in New Jersey *The toll portion of Delaware Route 1 *New York State Route 59 ==See also== *Korean War Veterans Parkway in Staten Island, New York Category:Korean War memorials and cemeteries Category:United States in the Korean War ","title":"Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway"},{"id":"2227734","text":"Charnock Richard Services is a motorway service station, between Junctions 27 and 28 of the M6 in England.

He was the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia from 1993 until his death in 1999. According to French political scientist Gilles Kepel, Baz was a \\"figurehead\\" whose \\"immense religious erudition and his reputation for intransigence\\" gave him prestige among the population of Saudi Arabia and he \\"could reinforce the Saud family's policies through his influence with the masses of believers\\", and his death left the government without a comparable figure from within the Salafi clergy to \\"fill his shoes\\". Ibn Baz issued a fatwa authorizing a wealth tax to support the Mujahideen during the anti-Soviet jihad.Saudi Arabia: Background and U.S. Relations, Christopher Blanchard, Congressional Research Service, 2010, p. 27 . His endorsement of In Defence of Muslim Lands, principally written by Abdullah Azzam, was a powerful influence in the successful call for jihad against the Soviet Union. It is said to be the first official call for jihad by a nation state against another nation state in modern times.Ibn Baaz's fatwa in support of the war against the soviets . Ibn Baz Fatwas, Volume 27, Book on Da\`wah. An interview by the Pakistani magazine: Takbir. Many of Ibn Baz's views and rulings are considered controversial (both inside and outside Saudi Arabia), including those relating to cosmology, women's rights, Saudi Arabia's support for the Oslo Accords, and the acceptability of stationing non-Islamic troops in the Land of the Two Holy Mosques (Haramayn) during and after the Persian Gulf War. Osama bin Laden bitterly condemned Bin Baz and his rulings that supported Saudi Arabia's foreign policy and alliances with Western powers. ==Youth== Ibn Baz was born in the city of Riyadh during the month of Dhu al-Hijjah, 1910 to a family with a reputation for their interest in Islam. His father died when he was only three. By the time he was thirteen he had begun working, selling clothing with his brother in a market. He also took lessons in the Qur‚Äôan, Hadith, Fiqh, and Tafsir, with the man who would precede him as the country's top religious official, Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al ash-Sheikh. In 1927, when he was sixteen, he started losing his eyesight after being afflicted with a serious infection in his eyes. By the time he was twenty, he had totally lost his sight and had become blind.\\"Ad- Da'wah Ilallah wa Akhlaaqud-Du'aat\\" (pp. 37‚Äì43) ===Education=== At that time, Saudi Arabia lacked a modern university system. Ibn Baz received a traditional education in Islamic literature with Islamic scholars.Main Page \\"Words of Advice Regarding Da'wah\\" by 'Abdul 'Azeez ibn 'Abdullaah ibn Baaz (translated by Bint Feroz Deen and Bint Abd al-Ghafoor), Al-Hidaayah Publishing and Distribution, Birmingham: 1998, Page 9‚Äì10 ==Career== He held a number of posts and responsibilities, such as:\\"Words of Advice Regarding Da'wah\\" by 'Abdul 'Azeez ibn 'Abdullaah ibn Baaz (translated by Bint Feroz Deen and Bint 'Abd al-Ghafoor), Al-Hidaayah Publishing and Distribution, Birmingham: 1998, Pages 10‚Äì11 *Judge of Al Kharj district upon the recommendation of Muhammad ibn 'Abdul-Lateef Al ash-Shaikh from 1938 to 1951. *In 1992 he was appointed Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia and Head of the Council of Senior Scholars and was granted presidency of the administration for Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta. *President and member of the Constituent Assembly of the Muslim World League.

Ibn BƒÅz was a prolific speaker, both in public and privately at his mosque. He also used to invite people after Isha prayer to share a meal with him. Ibn BƒÅz was among the Muslim scholars who opposed regime change using violence.ÿßŸÑÿπŸÜŸÅ Ÿäÿ∂ÿ± ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿØÿπŸàÿ© He called for obedience to the people in power unless they ordered something that went against God.ÿ≠ŸÇŸàŸÇ ŸàŸÑÿßÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÖŸàÿ± ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÖÿ© ==Works== The number of books written by Ibn BƒÅz exceeds sixty and the subject matter covered topics such as Hadith, Tafsir, Fara'ed, Tawheed, Fiqh, Salat, Zakat, Dawah, Hajj and Umrah. He also authored a criticism of the concept of nationhood. ==Personal life== His wives and children lived in the Shumaysi neighbourhood of Riyadh in \\"a little cluster of modern two-story buildings\\". Like all senior Saudi clerics, his home was a gift from a wealthy benefactor or a religious foundation for his distinguished religious work. ==Death== On Thursday morning, 13 May 1999, Ibn BƒÅz died at the age of 88. He was buried in Al Adl cemetery, Mecca. King Fahd issued a decree appointing Abdul-Azeez ibn Abdullaah Aal ash-Shaikh as the new Grand Mufti after Ibn BƒÅz's death.\\"New Saudi Grand Mufti\\" , BBC News, May 16, 1999. In his career as the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, he attempted to both legitimize the rule of the ruling family and to support calls for the reform of Islam in line with Salafi ideals. Many criticized him for supporting the Saudi government when, after the Persian Gulf War, it muzzled or imprisoned those regarded as too critical of the government, such as Safar al-Hawali and Salman al-Ouda. His influence on the Salafi movement was large, and most of the current prominent judges and religious scholars in Saudi Arabia are his former students. ==Controversies== His obituary in The Independent said \\"His views and fatwas (religious rulings) were controversial, condemned by militants, liberals and progressives alike\\". He was also criticized by hardline Salafists and jihadists for supporting the decision to permit U.S. troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia in 1991. ===Cosmology=== In 1966, when Ibn Baz was vice-president of the Islamic University of Medina, he wrote an article denouncing Riyadh University for teaching the \\"falsehood\\" that the earth rotates and orbits the sun. In his article, Ibn Baz claimed that the sun orbited the earth, and that \\"the earth is fixed and stable, spread out by God for mankind and made a bed and cradle for them, fixed down by mountains lest it shake\\". As a result of the publication of his first article, Ibn Baz was ridiculed by Egyptian journalists as an example of Saudi primitiveness, and King Faisal was reportedly so angered by the first article that he ordered the destruction of every unsold copy of the two papers that had published it. In 1982 Ibn Baz published a book, Al-adilla al-naqliyya wa al-·∏•issiyya  øala imkƒÅn al-·π£u æ≈´d ila al-kawƒÅkib wa  æala jarayƒÅn al-shams wa al-qamar wa suk≈´n al-ar·∏ç (\\"Treatise on the textual and rational proofs of the rotation of the sun and the motionlessness of the earth and the possibility of ascension to other planets\\"). In it, he republished the 1966 article, together with a second article on the same subject written later in 1966, and repeated his belief that the sun orbited the earth. In 1985, he changed his mind concerning the rotation of the earth (and, according to Lacey, ceased to assert its flatness), when Prince Sultan bin Salman returned home after a week aboard the space shuttle Discovery to tell him that he had seen the earth rotate. In addition, there was controversy concerning the nature of the takfir (the act of declaring other Muslims to be kafir or unbelievers) which it was claimed Ibn Baz had pronounced. According to Malise Ruthven, he threatened all who did not accept his \\"pre-Copernican\\" views with a fatwa, declaring them infidels. Ibn Baz wrote a letter to a magazine in 1966 responding to similar accusations: > I only deemed it lawful to kill whoever claims that the sun is static > (thƒÅbita la jƒÅriya) and refuses to repent of this after clarification. This > is because denying the circulation of the sun constitutes a denial of Allah > (Glorified be He), His Great Book, and His Honourable Messenger. It is well > established in the Din (religion of Islam) by way of decisive evidence and > Ijma\` (consensus) of scholars that whoever denies Allah, His Messenger or > His Book is a Kafir (disbeliever) and their blood and wealth become > violable. It is the duty of the responsible authority to ask them to repent > of this; either they repent or be executed. Thanks to Allah that this issue > is not debatable among scholars. Ibn Baz's second article written in 1966 also responded to similar accusations: > I did not declare those who believe that the earth rotates to be infidels, > nor those who believe that the sun moving around itself, but I do so for > those who say that the sun is static and does not move (thƒÅbita la jƒÅriya), > which is in my last article. Whoever says so being an infidel is obvious > from the Quran and the Sunnah, because God almighty says: 'And the sun runs > on (tajri) to a term appointed for it' ... As for saying that the Sun is > fixed in one position but still moving around itself, ..., I did not deal > with this issue in my first article, nor have I declared as infidel anyone > who says so.For another response from the 1970s see Western writers > subsequently have drawn parallels between their perception of Ibn Baz and > the trial of Galileo by the Catholic Church in the 16th century. Ibn Baz is often said to have believed that the Earth was flat. Author Robert Lacey says that Ibn Baz gave an interview \\"in which he mused on how we operate day to day on the basis that the ground beneath us is flat ... and it led him to the belief that he was not afraid to voice and for which he became notorious.\\" Though satirized for his belief, \\"the sheikh was unrepentant. If Muslims chose to believe the world was round, that was their business, he said, and he would not quarrel with them religiously. But he was inclined to trust what he felt beneath his feet rather than the statements of scientists he did not know.\\" According to Lacey, Ibn Baz changed his mind about the earth's flatness after talking to Prince Sultan bin Salman Al Saud who had spent time in a space shuttle flight in 1985. However, Malise Ruthven and others state that it is incorrect to report that Ibn Baz believed \\"the earth is flat\\" Professor Werner Ende, a German expert on Ibn Baz's fatwas, states he has never asserted this. Abd al-Wahh√¢b al-Turayr√Æ calls those that attribute the flat earth view to Ibn Baz \\"rumour mongers\\". He points out that Ibn Baz issued a fatwa declaring that the Earth is round, and, indeed, in 1966 Ibn Baz wrote \\"The quotation I cited [in his original article] from the speech of the great scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah be merciful to him) includes proof that the earth is round.\\" Lacey quotes a fatwa by Ibn Baz urging caution towards claims that the Americans had landed on the moon. \\"We must make careful checks whenever the kuffar [unbelievers] or faseqoon [immoral folk] tell us something: we cannot believe or disbelieve them until we get sufficient proof on which the Muslims can depend.\\" ===Grand Mosque Seizure=== Ibn Baz has been associated with some members of the 20 November‚Äì4 December 1979 takeover of the Grand Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Mecca. The two-week-long armed takeover left over 250 dead, including hostages taken by the militants. According to interviews taken by author Robert Lacey, the militants (known as Beit Al- Ikhwan) led by Juhayman al-Otaybi, were students of Ibn Baz and other high ulema. Juhayman declared his brother-in-law, Mohammed al-Qahtani, to be the Mahdi. The Mabahith (secret police) of the Minister of Interior, Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, had identified Mohammed al-Qahtani and a number of the Ikhwan as troublemakers. They had them imprisoned months before -- only to release them at the request of Sheikh Ibn Baz. Islam forbids any violence within the Grand Mosque. Ibn Baz found himself in a delicate situation, especially as he had previously taught al-Otaybi in Medina. The situation was compounded and complicated by the fact that the Saudi Government found itself unprepared and incapable of dislodging the militants from the Mosque.Thomas Hegghammer and Stephane Lacroix. Rejectionist Islamism in Saudi Arabia: The Story of Juhayman al-Utaybi Revisited. International Journal of Middle East Studies, February 2007, pp 103-122, Cambridge University Press (p. 3 PDF). They asked for outside assistance from the non-Islamic French GIGN and non- Arab Pakistani SSG. Non-Muslims are not permitted within the Meccan city limits, let alone the Grand Mosque. When asked for a fatwa by the Government to condemn the militants, the language of Ibn Baz and other senior ulama \\"was curiously restrained\\". The invaders of the Masjid al-Haram were not declared non-Muslims, despite their killings and violation of the sanctity of the Masjid, but only called \\"al-jamaah al-musallahah\\" (the armed group). Regardless, the ulema issued a fatwa allowing deadly force to be used in retaking the mosque.Wright, Looming Tower, (2006), pp. 103‚Äì104 ‚Äì softcover The senior scholars also insisted that before security forces attack them, the authorities must offer the option \\"to surrender and lay down their arms\\". Ibn Baz, through a loophole, issued another fatwa allowing the French Special Operations Forces to do a last minute, if only temporary, conversion to Islam, to be able to enter the city and the Grand Mosque to shed the blood of militants Ibn Baz refused to condemn as non-Muslim. ===Women's rights=== Ibn Baz has been described as having harsh and inflexible attitudes towards women and being a bulwark against the expansion of rights for women. Commenting on the Sharia rule that the testimony in court of one woman was insufficient, Ibn Baz said: \\"The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) explained that their shortcoming in reasoning is found in the fact that their memory is weak and that their witness is in need of another woman to corroborate it.\\" He also issued a fatwa against women driving cars, which in the West may have been his most well known ruling. He declared: \\"Depravity leads to the innocent and pure women being accused of indecencies. Allah has laid down one of the harshest punishments for such an act to protect society from the spreading of the causes of depravity. Women driving cars, however, is one of the causes that lead to that.\\" ===Persian Gulf War=== During the Persian Gulf War Ibn BƒÅz issued a fatwa allowing the deployment of non-Muslim troops on Saudi Arabian soil to defend the kingdom from the Iraqi army. Some noted that this was in contrast to his opinion in the 1940s, when he contradicted the government policy of allowing non-Muslims to be employed on Saudi soil. However, according to The New York Times, his fatwa overruled more radical clerics.See also Salafi Fatwa Of Takfeer On Their Own Imams Ibn Baaz, Albani & Co. By: Maulana Muhammad A. K. Azad [ Abu Arif Al Alawi ], 14 NOVEMBER 2012, contains full text of Salafi fatwa - Ibn Baaz Is Kafir, by Judith Miller, The New York Times, 20 January 1991 as well. In response to criticism, Ibn Baz condemned those who \\"whisper secretly in their meetings and record their poison over cassettes distributed to the people\\". Another key issue was to allow the wearing of the cross by non-Muslim soldiers and the carrying of New Testaments into battle against other Muslims from the holiest land in Islam. This ruling shook Saudi society like an earthquake, and remains at the heart of many violent disputes Salafi jihadis have with the House of Saud till this day.Satanic Fatwa of bin Baz and Some Remarks . millatibraheem.wordpress.com The radical cleric Abdullah el-Faisal declared Ibn Baz takfir (a Muslim traitor) who died unrepentant. ===Criticism of Osama bin Laden=== According to his obituary in The Independent, Ibn Baz held ultra-conservative views and strongly maintained the puritan and non-compromising traditions of Wahabism. However, his views were not strict enough for Osama bin Laden who condemned Ibn Baz for \\"his weakness and flexibility and the ease of influencing him with the various means which the interior ministry practises\\". Ibn BƒÅz was the subject of Osama bin Laden's first public pronouncement intended for the general Muslim public. This open letter condescendingly criticized him for endorsing the Oslo peace accord between the PLO and Israeli government.Messages to the World, The Statements of Osama Bin Laden, Edited and Introduced by Bruce Lawrence, Translated by James Howarth, Verso, 2005 Ibn Baz defended his decision to endorse the Oslo Accords by citing the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, saying that a peace treaty with non-Muslims has historical precedent if it can avoid the loss of life.al-Muslimoon Magazine, 21st Rajab 1415 AHat-Tawheed Magazine, vol. 23, Issue #10 Ibn Baz deemed it mandatory to destroy media that promoted Bin Laden's views, and declared that it was forbidden for anyone to co-operate with him. He wrote: > ...It is obligatory to destroy and annihilate these publications that have > emanated from al-Faqeeh, or from al-Mas'aree, or from others of the callers > of falsehood (bin Laden and those like him), and not to be lenient towards > them. And it is obligatory to advise them, to guide them towards the truth, > and to warn them against this falsehood. It is not permissible for anyone to > co-operate with them in this evil. And it is obligatory upon them to be > sincere and to come back to guidance and to leave alone and abandon this > falsehood. So my advice to al-Mas'aree, al-Faqeeh and Bin Laden and all > those who traverse their ways is to leave alone this disastrous path, and to > fear Allah and to beware of His vengeance and His Anger, and to return to > guidance and to repent to Allah for whatever has preceded from them. And > Allah, Glorified, has promised His repentant servants that He will accept > their repentance and be good to them. So Allah the Glorified said: \\"Say, 'O > My servants who have transgressed against themselves. Do not despair of the > Mercy of Allah; verily, Allah forgives all sins.' Truly, He is Oft- > Forgiving, Most Merciful.\\" [39:53].Majmoo'ul-Fataawaa wa Maqaalaatul- > Mutanawwiyah, Volume 9, as quoted in Clarification of the Truth in Light of > Terrorism, Hijackings & Suicide Bombings of Salafi Publications. ==See also== * Islam in Saudi Arabia * Salafi * Muhammad ibn al Uthaymeen * Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani == References  Bibliography == * * * ==External links== * * The Official Site of 'Abd al-'Aziz ibn Baaz * BURKE'S REDEMPTIVE CYCLE OF RHETORIC APPLIED TO EIGHT FATWAS ISSUED BY SAUDI ARABIA REGARDING SAUDI PARTICIPATION IN THE FIRST Persian GULF WAR, BY SYDNEY PASQUINELL; see Appendix for English language texts of the Eight Fatwas.

The Ford Escort name was also applied to several small car types produced in North America by Ford between 1981 and 2000. In 2014, Ford revived the Escort name for a car based on the second-generation Ford Focus sold on the Chinese market. The Escort was frequently the best selling car in Britain during the 1980s and 1990s. A total of more than 4.1 million Escorts of all generations were sold there over a period of 33 years. ==Ford Escort 100E (1955‚Äì1961)== Ford Escort 100E The first use of the Ford Escort name was for a reduced specification version of the Ford Squire, a 1950s estate car version of the British Ford Anglia 100E. ==First generation (1967‚Äì1975)== The Mark I Ford Escort was introduced in Ireland and the United Kingdom at the end of 1967, making its show debut at the Brussels Motor Show in January 1968. It replaced the successful, long-running Anglia. The Escort was as also presented in Europe as the first passenger car to be developed by the merged Ford of Europe (the Transit van having been the first product of this collaboration). Escort production commenced at the Halewood plant in England during the closing months of 1967, and for left hand drive markets during September 1968 at the Ford plant in Genk. Initially the continental Escorts differed slightly under the skin from the UK built ones. The front suspension and steering gear were differently configured and the brakes were fitted with dual hydraulic circuits; also the wheels fitted on the Genk-built Escorts had wider rims. At the beginning of 1970, continental European production transferred to a new plant on the edge of Saarlouis, West Germany. The Escort was a commercial success in several parts of western Europe, but nowhere more than in the UK, where the national best seller of the 1960s, BMC's Austin/Morris 1100 was beginning to show its age while Ford's own Cortina had grown, both in dimensions and in price, beyond the market niche at which it had originally been pitched. It competed with the Vauxhall Viva, and from early 1970 the Rootes Group's Hillman Avenger. In June 1974, six years into the car's UK introduction, Ford announced the completion of the two millionth Ford Escort, a milestone hitherto unmatched by any Ford model outside the US. It was also stated that 60% of the two million Escorts had been built in Britain.Oswald 1945‚Äì90 (vol 3), p 397 : 1,297,308 Mark I Escorts were built in Britain, while 848,388 were built by Ford Germany at Genk in Belgium and at Saarlous. In West Germany cars were built at a slower rate of around 150,000 cars per year, slumping to 78,604 in 1974 which was the last year for the Escort Mark I.Oswald 1945‚Äì90 (vol 3), pp 396 & 397: \\"Der grossere Teil der Produktion ging ins Ausland, weil der Ford Escort [Mk I] auf dem deutschen Markt wegen seiner pummeligen Form, seiner simplen Konstruktion, seiner holprigen Stra√üenlage und seines bescheidenen Komforts nur m√§√üigen Zuspruch fand... 848 388 [Escort Mk Is fertigten] die deutschen Ford-Werke, doch nur 234 667 Exemplaren fanden deutsche K√§ufer.\\" Many of the German built Escorts were exported, notably to Benelux and Italy; from the West German domestic market perspective the car was cramped and uncomfortable when compared with the well-established and comparably priced Opel Kadett, and it was technically primitive when set against the successful imported Fiat 128 and Renault 12.Oswald 1945‚Äì90 (vol 3), pp. 396 & 397: Of the 848,388 Escort Mk Is built by Ford Germany, only 234,667 were actually sold in Germany. Subsequent generations of the Escort made up some of the ground foregone by the original model, but in Europe's largest auto-market the Escort sales volumes always came in well behind those of the General Motors Kadett and its Astra successor. Just over two months after the launch of the saloon/sedan, Ford announced a three-door station wagon / estate version of their new Escort. The Escort had conventional rear- wheel drive and a four-speed manual gearbox, or three-speed automatic transmission. The suspension consisted of MacPherson strut front suspension and a simple live axle mounted on leaf springs. The Escort was the first small Ford to use rack-and-pinion steering. The Mark I featured contemporary styling cues in tune with its time: a subtle Detroit-inspired \\"Coke bottle\\" waistline and the \\"dogbone\\" shaped front grille ‚Äì arguably the car's main stylistic feature. Similar Coke bottle styling featured in the larger Cortina Mark III (a visually similar car was built in West Germany as the Taunus) launched in 1970. Less than two years after launch, Ford offered a four-door version of the Escort. Initially, the Escort was sold as a two-door saloon (with circular front headlights and rubber flooring on the \\"De Luxe\\" model). The \\"Super\\" model featured rectangular headlights, carpets, a cigar lighter and a water temperature gauge. A two-door estate was introduced at the end of March 1968 which, with the back seat folded down, provided a 40% increase in maximum load space over the old Anglia 105E estate, according to the manufacturer. The estate featured the same engine options as the saloon, but it also included a larger, clutch, stiffer rear springs and in most configurations slightly larger brake drums or discs than the saloon. A panel van appeared in April 1968 and the 4-door saloon (a bodystyle the Anglia was never available in for UK market) in 1969. Underneath the bonnet was the Kent Crossflow engine also used in the smallest capacity North American Ford Pinto. Diesel engines on small family cars were rare, and the Escort was no exception, initially featuring only petrol engines ‚Äì in 1.1 L, and 1.3 L versions. A 940 cc engine was also available in some export markets such as Italy and France. This tiny engine remained popular in Italy, where it was carried over for the Escort Mark II, but in France it was discontinued during 1972. Hannu Mikkola and Gunnar Palm's 1970 World Cup Rally-winning Escort Roger Clark's 1972 RAC Rally -winning Escort RS1600 There was a 1300GT performance version, with a tuned 1.3 L Crossflow (OHV) engine with a Weber carburetor and uprated suspension. This version featured additional instrumentation with a tachometer, battery charge indicator, and oil pressure gauge. The same tuned 1.3 L engine was also used in a variation sold as the Escort Sport, that used the flared front wings from the AVO range of cars, but featured trim from the more basic models. Later, an \\"executive\\" version of the Escort was produced known as the \\"1300E\\". This featured the same 13\\" road wheels and flared wings of the Sport, but was trimmed in an upmarket, for that time, fashion with wood trim on the dashboard and door cappings. A higher performance version for rallies and racing was available, the Escort Twin Cam, built for Group 2 international rallying. It had an engine with a Lotus-made eight-valve twin camshaft head fitted to the 1.5 L non-crossflow block, which had a bigger bore than usual to give a capacity of 1,558 cc. This engine had originally been developed for the Lotus Elan. Production of the Twin Cam, which was originally produced at Halewood, was phased out as the Cosworth-engined RS1600 (RS denoting Rallye Sport) production began. The most famous edition of the Twin Cam was raced on behalf of Ford by Alan Mann Racing in the British Saloon Car Championship in 1968 and 1969, sporting a full Formula 2 Ford FVC 16-valve engine producing over 200 hp. The Escort, driven by Australian driver Frank Gardner went on to comfortably win the 1968 championship. The Mark I Escorts became successful as a rally car, and they eventually went on to become one of the most successful rally cars of all time.Ford Motor Company ‚Äì Press Release ‚Äì Ford heads Marathon rally to Sydney The Ford works team was practically unbeatable in the late 1960s / early 1970s, and arguably the Escort's greatest victory was in the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally, driven by Finnish legend Hannu Mikkola and Swedish co-driver Gunnar Palm. This gave rise to the Escort Mexico (1598cc \\"crossflow\\"-engined) special edition road versions in honour of the rally car. Introduced in November 1970, 10,352 Mexico Mark Is were built using bodyshells using additional strengthening panels in high stress areas making them more suitable for competition. In addition to the Mexico, the RS1600 was developed with a 1,601 cc Cosworth BDA which used a Crossflow block with a 16-valve Cosworth cylinder head, named for \\"Belt Drive A Series\\". Both the Mexico and RS1600 were built at Ford's Advanced Vehicle Operations (AVO) facility located at the Aveley Plant in South Essex. As well as higher performance engines and sports suspension, like the Mexico these models featured the strengthened bodyshell. Ford also produced an RS2000 model as an alternative to the somewhat temperamental RS1600, featuring a 2.0 L Pinto (OHC) engine. This also clocked up some rally and racing victories; and pre- empted the hot hatch market as a desirable but affordable performance road car. Like the Mexico and RS1600, this car was produced at the Aveley plant using the strengthened bodyshell. The Escort was built in Germany and Britain, as well as in Australia and New Zealand.

The four-door sedan was added in 1970. Trim levels were revised after the 1972 UK facelift with just one run of 1.3XLs (with the GT instrument pack) before these were downgraded to 'L' trim. Base and L trims were offered to the end of the Mk I run. Some 1.6 Mexicos were imported in 1973‚Äì74 after the government temporarily freed up import licensing owing to a shortage of new cars. Estate versions were mostly imported. ===Australia=== The Mk I was produced by Ford Australia from 1970 to 1975 as a two- or four-door saloon and as a two-door panel van.Ford Escort Production Numbers And Identification Guide Retrieved on 28 January 2010 1100 cc and 1300 cc engines were offered, as was the 1558 cc twin cam unit., the last only in the Escort Twin Cam model, which was renamed the Escort GT 1600 in late 1971.Glass‚Äôs Price Guide, June 1973, page 46 Some 67,146 examples of the Mk I were built in Australia, with local sourcing bringing the Australian content of the vehicles to 85 per cent. ===Israel=== Assembly of the Mk I Escort was undertaken by Automotive Industries in Upper Nazareth, in conjunction with the local distributor, Israeli Automotive Corp. Assembly from UK-sourced kits started in April 1968. The last Mk I, a light green 1100cc two-door, was produced on 14 November 1975. A total of 14,905 units were assembled in Israel, including 105 Escort 400 vans. ===Japan=== The Mk I Escort was sold in Japan, imported from the United Kingdom by Kintetsu Motors and was available with the 1.3 L engine in GT trim, and was sold alongside the Ford Cortina and the Ford Capri. Sales were helped by the fact that this generation Escort complied with Japanese government dimension regulations concerning vehicle dimensions and engine displacement. Only the four-door saloon was offered, and this was the only generation available to Japanese buyers. The engine displacement contributed to a lower annual road tax obligation to Japanese buyers which helped sales. ==Second generation (1974‚Äì1981)== The squarer- styled Mark II version appeared in January 1975. The first production models had rolled off the production lines on 2 December 1974. Unlike the first Escort (which was developed by Ford of Britain), the second generation was developed jointly between the UK and Ford of Germany. Codenamed \\"Brenda\\" during its development, it used the same mechanical components, floorpan and core structure as the Mark I. The 940 cc engine was still offered in Italy where the smaller engine attracted tax advantages, but in the other larger European markets in Europe it was unavailable. The estate and van versions used the same doors, roof and rear panelwork as the Mark I, but with the Mark II front end and interior. The car used a revised underbody, which had been introduced as a running change during the last six months production of the Mark I. The rear suspension still sat on leaf springs though some contemporaries such as the Hillman Avenger had moved on to coil springs. The car came in for criticism for its lack of oddments space, with a glove compartment available on only higher end models, and its stalk-mounted horn. The \\"L\\" and \\"GL\\" models (2-door, 4-door, estate) were in the mainstream private sector, the \\"Sport\\", \\"RS Mexico\\", and \\"RS2000\\" in the performance market, the \\"Ghia\\" (2-door, 4-door) for a hitherto untapped small car luxury market, and \\"base / Popular\\" models for the bottom end. Panel-van versions catered to the commercial sector. The 1.6 L (1598 cc/97 CID) engine in the 1975 1.6 Ghia produced 84 hp (63 kW) with 125 N¬∑m (92 ft¬∑lbf) torque and weighed 955 kg (2105 lb). A cosmetic update was given in 1978 (note that Australia received differing updates - see below), with L models gaining the square headlights (previously exclusive to the GL and Ghia variants) and there was an upgrade in interior and exterior specification for some models. Underneath a wider front track was given. In 1979 and 1980 three special edition Escorts were launched: the Linnet, Harrier and Goldcrest. Production ended in Britain in August 1980, other countries following soon after. ===Oceania=== Australia The Mk II Escort was assembled at Ford Australia's Homebush Plant, Sydney from March 1975 to 1980 in 2-door and 4-door sedan, and 2-door panel van forms ‚Äì the estate versions were unavailable to the Australian market. The sedan models were available in L, XL (later renamed GL) and Ghia forms, and a Sport pack option ‚Äì similar to the 1300 and 1600 Sport models sold elsewhere. Unlike other markets ‚Äì likely due to the estate's absence ‚Äì the van was offered in a higher level of trim ‚Äì a GL, and a Sport pack van was also available. Unusual fitments for the range not offered elsewhere on the Australian Escort included 'dog-dish' steel hubcaps, and high-backed front seats. Australian 1979 Ford Escort RS2000 four- door form The initial powerplants utilized in the Australian Escorts were Ford's 1.3 L and 1.6 L OHV Crossflow units, offered with either 4-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmissions. In 1977, to cope with Australian emission laws, in particular ADR27A, the 1.3L models were dropped and the Ford Cortina's 2.0L OHC Pinto engine (in a lower tune to European units) was introduced to the Escort range, available as an option on nearly all models. Codenamed internally by Ford Australia as \\"BC\\", the Australian Escort range's bodies were modified to fit the larger engine and a redesigned fuel-tank, which involved the placement of the fuel filler being behind the rear numberplate. In 1978, Ford Australia standardised the use of the blue oval logo across the Escort model range. These Escort models are identified by the familiar blue Ford oval in the centre of the grille and on the right of the bootlid. It also revamped the image of its 'leisure range' by introducing the Escort Sundowner panel van, positioning it as a youth-orientated lifestyle vehicle complete with bold body decorations and domed side windows, available in 1.6L and 2.0L forms. In 1979, Ford Australia gave the Escort an update, increasing basic equipment levels and standardising square headlights on L and GL models (previously only available on Escort Ghia). Chasing both youth and performance, Ford Australia introduced their take on the RS2000, which ‚Äì complete with its slant-nose ‚Äì was available in both two-door form and as a unique to Australia four-door, in a choice of five solid paint colours. These RS cars certainly looked the part, but were actually powered by the same 2.0-litre engine as the rest of the local Escort range, and available with a choice of manual or automatic transmission. A total of 2,400 Australian RS2000 cars were made. While offered in many model forms, the Escort, like the Cortina, was not popular on the Australian market, largely due to expanding competition from Japanese imports and the established preference of Australian drivers for larger six-cylinder vehicles. Australian Escort production ceased in late 1980, with 79,142 examples of the Mk II produced, the range being replaced by FWD derivatives of the Mazda 323/Familia, namely the Ford Laser 3-door and 5-door hatchback and the Meteor 4-door sedan. New Zealand The Mk II Escort was introduced to New Zealand in early 1975, assembled at Ford's plant in Wiri, South Auckland. Unlike the Australian models, the New Zealand Escort range followed the specifications of the British models, aside from the use of metric instrumentation. All bodystyles were assembled, including the estate ‚Äì previously (in Mk I guise) a built-up import from the United Kingdom. A large choice of models were available in the NZ Escort range, consisting of 1.1 L (base), 1.3 L (L, GL, 1300 Sport, estate and van variants) and 1.6 L (Ghia, 1600 Sport) variants ‚Äî the 1.1 being aimed at budget conscious buyers, the 1.3 L models were popular, and the 1.6 L ‚Äì which appeared in New Zealand production in 1976 ‚Äì being reserved for 1600 Sport and Ghia models. A three-speed automatic transmission was available as an option for most 1.3- and 1.6-litre models. Unlike Australia, the Escort and Cortina ranges sold well and often topped the car monthly sales lists. An update was given for the range for 1979, which notably involved the addition of the Ghia model, the adoption of the GL's square headlights on the lower end models, Ford blue oval badging, and sport wheels on the L and GL. For 1980, all Ghia models gained standard alloy wheels. The production of British-sourced and New Zealand-assembled Escorts ended in late 1980. Ford dealers offered large price reductions to shift their remaining Mk II Escort stock when the model was replaced in New Zealand by the Ford Laser in May 1981, which was a badge engineered Mazda 323, available in sedan and hatchback forms. ===Rest of the world=== ;Israel Assembly of the Mk II Escort commenced in August 1975. The Escort was a best-seller in the Israeli market, its best year being 1976, when a total of 3,801 units were assembled. The line-up included 1.1- and 1.3-litre versions. Most were of the four-door variety, and only 150 were built as a 2-door 1.1L. Assembly ended after 12,700 units, in April 1981. No Ford passenger car was since then assembled in Israel. ;South Africa Escort Mark II shells built in Halewood, England were assembled in Silverton, South Africa from late 1975 until 1980. When originally launched, the Escort Mark II was sold as the 1300 L or as the 1600 GL, with two- or four-door bodywork. Aside from colour-coded hubcaps, most of the equipment differences were only on the inside with the GL being considerably better equipped.bigger and better, p. 21 The GL also received square headlights, back-up lights, and body-side mouldings. The South African Escort received the 1.3-litre Kent engine with , while the 1.6 claimed . Early in 1979 the 1600 sport was launched, featuring a two-door bodyshell, revised gear ratios and a sporty look, using the 1600 motor proving to become a highly popular vehicle to the present day. The \\"One Six Double O\\" Sport was the best selling car in South Africa in 1980 at its retail price of R4995.00. These vehicles had a stronger Kent block cast in South Africa that had thicker cylinder walls, which was and is still utilised in the Formula Ford series. SA vehicles differed in minor ways from European built counterparts in that the interior exposed metal parts were painted Matt black as opposed to body colour and the bonnet/hood prop pivoted from the right as opposed to the left. Nevertheless, South Africa is now a popular source for re-importing Mk II's back to the UK, since many have survived in the hotter climate (and are therefore not as vulnerable to rust), compared with the number of good condition European and British built examples rapidly dwindling. Like the Mk I, many road cars were converted for rally use which further degraded the number of usable examples for classic enthusiasts. ===Rallying=== As with its predecessor, the Mark II had a successful rallying career. All models of the Mark I were carried over to the Mark II, though the Mexico gained the RS badge and had its engine changed to a OHC Pinto instead of the OHV. A \\"Sport\\" model was also produced using the 1.6 L Crossflow. A new model was released, the RS1800, which had a naturally aspirated Cosworth BDE DOHC 4 valves per cylinder with a 32/36 DGAV Weber carburetor inline-four engine, producing at 6000 rpm and of torque at 3750 rpm. It was essentially a special created for rallying. The works rally cars were highly specialised machines. Bodyshells were heavily strengthened and characterised by the wide wheelarch extensions, and fitment of four large spotlights for night stages. The Cosworth BDE engine was replaced with 2.0 L BDG and gave up to with Cosworth-made aluminium block by 1979. It was complemented by a strengthened transmission, five-speed straight-cut ZF gearbox, five-linked suspension and more minor modifications. The RS1800 was re-homologated with the aluminium block on 2 April 1977 as the 1975 cc Group-4 Escort RS.FIA Book of Recognition Number 650, 2 April 1977 This was after the FIA removed the 100-off rule from Appendix J 1976 and banned modifications approved under the previous rules for groups 2 and 4, effective from the end of 1977.FIA, Appendix J to the International Sporting Code 1976: Classification, definition and specifications of cars, December 11, 1975, Article 261, paragraph dd. The Mark II Escort continued its predecessor's run on the RAC Rally, winning every year from 1975 to 1979 and racing in a variety of other events around the world. In the 1979 season of the World Rally Championship, Bj√∂rn Waldeg√•rd took the drivers' title, Hannu Mikkola was runner-up and Ari Vatanen finished the year in fifth place, all driving Escort RS1800s. These drivers' successes throughout the year gave Ford the manufacturers' title, the only time the company had achieved this until the 2006 season, when Marcus Gr√∂nholm and Mikko Hirvonen won the title for Ford in Ford Focus RS WRC 06. Vatanen won the drivers' title in 1981, again at the wheel of an RS1800. This victory came despite the arrival on the WRC scene of the four-wheel drive Audi Quattro. Ford placed in the top three in the manufacturers' championship for the sixth year in a row. The 2.0 L RS2000 version, with its distinctively slanted polyurethane nose, and featuring the Pinto engine from the Cortina, was announced in the UK in March 1975 and introduced in Germany in August 1975, being reportedly produced in both countries. It provided a claimed 110 bhp and a top speed of 110 mph (177 km/h). For acceleration to 100 km/h (62.5 mph) a time of just 8.9 seconds was claimed by the manufacturers. The 2.0 L engine was also easily retro-fitted into the Mark I, along with the Ford Sierra's five-speed gearbox, for rallying and other sports.

The car, Ford Europe's second front-wheel drive model, was originally meant to be called the \\"Ford Erika\\",Pint-sized Pinto, Popular Science, February 1978 but ended up retaining the Escort name. Some say this was due to British consumers' reluctance to let go of the \\"Escort\\" badge (as the first two generations of Escort had been among Britain's most popular cars, with the Mk II being Britain's best selling car in 1976), and some say that the Germans were concerned with the song Erika, which was a famous battlemarch of the German armed forces during World War II. The North American Escort introduced at this time was a distantly related derivative. Sales in the United Kingdom increased, and by 1982 it had overtaken the ageing Cortina as the nation's best-selling car, beginning an eight-year run as Britain's best selling car. Unlike the Mark II, which had essentially been a reskin of the original 1968 platform, the Mark III was a completely new design, and was conceived as a hi- tech, high-efficiency vehicle which would compete with the Volkswagen Golf and Honda Civic ‚Äì considered at the time the class benchmarks, and indeed the car was launched with the advertising tagline \\"Simple is Efficient\\". The Mark III was a departure from the two previous models, the biggest changes being the adoption of front-wheel drive and the new hatchback body. The suspension was fully independent all around, departing from the archaic leaf spring arrangement found on its predecessors. It was Ford Europe's second front-wheel drive model launch, the first being the smaller Fiesta in 1976. The car used Ford's contemporary design language of the period with the black louvred radiator grille and straked rear lamp clusters, as well as introducing the aerodynamic \\"bustle-back\\" bootlid stump (trademarked by Ford as Aeroback) which would be further developed in the forthcoming Sierra and Scorpio; the stump was proven to reduce the car's aerodynamic drag co-efficient significantly, which was a class-leading 0.37 at launch. New were the overhead camshaft CVH engines in 1.3 L and 1.6 L formats, with the older Ford Kent- based \\"Valencia\\" engine from the Fiesta powering the 1.1 L derivative, although there was a short-lived 1.1 version of the CVH engine sold in certain markets before it was discontinued in 1982. The Escort Mark III was voted European Car of the Year in 1981, fighting off stiff competition from Italy's Fiat Panda and British Leyland's Austin Metro. From launch, the car was available in base (Popular), L, GL, Ghia and XR3 trim. From mid-1982, a five- speed manual gearbox was introduced across the range. This was now standard on the 1.6 L versions and could be specified as an option on most 1.3 L engines. A selection of features was available, either as standard fitment or optional extras depending on model, including a tilt-and-slide sunroof, central locking, and electric windows. All models except for base and L were fitted with a check-light system for low fuel, low oil, low coolant, low screenwash, and worn out brake pads. Power steering was not available on European Escorts although it was available on the US Escort. For the 1983 model year, the Ford ATX three-speed automatic transmission (developed primarily for the US version) was available on the 1.6 L engine within a couple of years of the car's launch. However, the car attracted criticism from the motoring press at launch due to its suspension, with positive camber on the front wheels and negative camber at the rear, giving rise to the Mark III's infamous \\"knock- kneed\\" stance. The Mark III soon had a reputation for a harsh, unforgiving ride. In 1983 the revised suspension mounts from the Escort-based Orion and the larger Sierra steering rack were introduced as running changes for the 1984 model year which also coincided with a minor update for it including a new Escort badge at the rear. Another engine, introduced in August 1983, was the 1.6 L diesel engine. Developed in Dagenham, it was remarkably economical for its time, and still is to this day, managing over 70 mpg. It was available on the L and GL models. However, the performance was not so impressive, with only and a top speed of barely . The Escort estate was initially only available with three doors, but a five-door version was introduced in 1983. In that year, a saloon version of the Escort, the Orion, was launched. It used the same mechanicals as the hatchback, but had a more upmarket image and was not available with the smaller 1.1 L engine. It was also directed at buyers of the earlier Cortina, which had ceased production in 1982, with its Sierra successor not available as a saloon at the time. The Mk III model (1980‚Äì1986), was the most common type of car on British roads in December 1989, with almost 1,500,000 examples registered. A convertible version, made by coachbuilder Karmann, appeared the same year as the five-door estate (1983). It was the first drop-top car produced by Ford Europe since the Corsair of the 1960s. The Escort Cabriolet was initially available in both XR3i and Ghia specification, but the Ghia variant was later dropped. ===Sporting models=== Ford Escort RS 1600i To compete with Volkswagen's Golf GTI, a hot hatch version of the Mark III was developed ‚Äì the XR3. Initially this featured a tuned version of the 1.6 L CVH engine fitted with a twin-choke Weber carburettor, uprated suspension and numerous cosmetic alterations. It lacked a five-speed transmission and fuel injection. Fuel injection finally arrived in October 1982 (creating the XR3i), eight months behind the limited edition (8,659 examples), racetrack-influenced RS 1600i. The Cologne-developed RS received a more powerful engine with , thanks to computerized ignition and a modified head as well as the fuel injection. The final performance update arrived in the form of the turbocharged RS Turbo model in October 1984. The RS Turbo was somewhat of a disappointment; it had been delayed several times and when it went on sale in early 1985 the chassis came in for severe criticism. The RS Turbo Series 1 was only marketed in a few European nations as production was limited to 5,000 examples, all in white. They were well equipped, with the alloy wheels from the limited production RS 1600i, Recaro seats, and a limited slip differential. One car only was finished in black; it was built especially for Lady Diana. The Series 2 RS Turbo continued with the 1986 MKIV model. RS 1700T The Ford Escort RS 1700T was a prototype RWD car designed by Ford Motor Company in 1980 to compete in Group B rallying. Prototypes were based on the Mk III Escort and featured a Cosworth developed 1.8-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine that produced over maximum power. Also a prototype with a 2.4 litre Hart engine (derived from a Formula Two unit) was tested in 1982. Persistent problems during the vehicle's development prompted Ford to drop plans for its production and instead begin work on an all-wheel- drive model to beat the Audi Quattro, designed and built from scratch, resulting in the famous RS200. ===Commercial models=== The two-door Escort Van was first sold in February 1981, a slightly delayed introduction caused by large remaining stocks of the Mark II Escort Van. The Van has twin rear doors and unusual small side windows behind the front doors, necessary to provide more over-the-shoulder visibility which would otherwise be limited by the use of the short front doors from the five-door Escort. Derived from the van was a pickup version of the Escort, the Bantam, which was produced in South Africa. ===Latin America=== The Escort entered production in Brazil in July 1983, with either three or five doors. To better deal with the tropical heat, the Brazilian three-door Escort received swing-out rear windows, unlike their European counterparts. It was equipped with the Renault-based Ford CHT engine, of either 1341 or 1555 cc. Both size engines were also available in alcohol- fuelled versions with marginally more power.Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985, pp. 383‚Äì384 It was originally available in base (Popular), LX or GLX trim levels, with four- or five-speed manual transmissions. In October 1983 the luxurious Ghia version was added. This model was exported to Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway from 1983 until 1986, where it replaced the low priced German-built Escort L. The car had a bad reputation in Scandinavia, with severe rust problems and issues with the wet liners of the Renault-designed engine. The engines were also designed to run on petrol containing some ethanol (15-20%), leading to troubles when using straight petrol. The Brazilian Escort LX was also available in Switzerland, only with the larger engine option. Brazil also received an XR3 version towards the very end of 1983, only available with a tuned version of the 1.6-liter engine running on alcohol. Aside from interior and exterior enhancements including spoilers and 14-inch alloy wheels, the XR3's engine produced , a bit more than the regular versions but not quite enough to be considered a sporting car. In April 1985, the Escort Cabriolet was introduced. It was built in Brazil in collaboration between Ford and Karmann, with the top imported from Germany. ===South Africa=== The Escort was also available in South Africa, as hatchback only, from March 1981, with the 1.3 and 1.6 litre engines. The South African Escorts differ only slightly from European ones, as a result of local parts content regulations.Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985, pp. 427‚Äì429 The XR3 was also sold, known simply as the Ford XR3 and later XR3i, rather than the Ford Escort XR3. ==Fourth generation (1986‚Äì1992)== Escort XR3i formerly used as a British police car thumb200pxleftDashboard of a Mk4 Escort The fourth version of the Ford Escort was launched in March 1986, with only a small number of changes. Although popularly regarded as a fourth generation model (and is popularly known as the \\"Mark IV\\"), internally within Ford it was regarded as a Mark III facelift and consequently carried the codename 'Erika-86'. It was instantly recognisable as an updated version of the previous model, taking styling cues from the recently introduced Scorpio/Granada III - with a smooth style nose and the \\"straked\\" rear lamp clusters smoothed over. Internally the car had a completely new dashboard and other smaller changes. Optional new features included a mechanical anti‚Äêlock braking system (standard on RS Turbo models), a fuel computer on fuel-injected models, and a heated windscreen. However, the check-light system for low fuel, low oil, low coolant, low screenwash, and worn out brake pads was no longer fitted to any model. Air conditioning was not available on cars sold in Europe although it was an option on cars sold in Argentina and Brazil. These changes were welcome at a time when the Escort was faced with a host of new competitors; General Motors had brought out a new version of the Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra 18 months earlier, shortly after Volkswagen had introduced the Mk II Golf and British Leyland had launched the Austin Maestro, while the British-built Peugeot 309 had gone on sale just weeks before the updated Escort. All-new competitors from Fiat and Renault were just two years away. In 1987, an LX trim designation was introduced, situated between the L and GL models. As well as an all-new interior, a new 1.4 L derivative of the CVH engine was introduced, as well as numerous suspension tweaks to address the long-standing criticisms of the Escort's handling and ride quality, although these had limited success. In 1988, the diesel engine was enlarged to 1.8 L. Also for the 1989 model year, the entry level 1.1 L and 1.3 L models were updated with the redesigned HCS version of the Kent/Valencia family developed for the Mk III Fiesta. For the same year, a Ford developed electronic fuel injection system replaced the Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system in the XR3i and Orion Ghia injection models, and a central point fuel injection system replaced the carburettor on models with the 1.4 L engine. Ford gave the Escort‚Äêbased Orion saloon a similar makeover. Carried over from the previous range was the 3-speed automatic which was ultimately replaced late in the production run with a variant of the CTX stepless gearbox as first used in the Fiesta a couple of years earlier. A luxurious Orion 1600E with leather seats, fuel injection, alloy wheels, and a Ghia trim was produced during 1989 and 1990. A total of 1,600 were made, with 1,000 of these having leather trim. The Orion range was also broadened to include a more basic \\"L\\" trim for the first time. A minor update occurred in Spring 1989 where the Escort badge at the rear changed to look more modern as well as some minor trim revisions in order to maintain interest in the car until the Mark V arrived the following year. Escorts for European markets continued to be assembled at Halewood, near Liverpool, and at the West German factory of Saarlouis. Sales were strong through the decade, and during the later 1980s Escort production also commenced at the Ford plant originally established for Fiesta production in Valencia. European production finished in 1990, although stocks of the model, especially the XR3i and RS Turbo variants continued into 1991 and finished in 1992. At this time, the Escort was dropped in South Africa and replaced by the Mazda-derived Laser and Meteor.Financial Mail, Volume 104, Issues 5-9, page 221 However, the Escort‚Äêbased Bantam pick- up remained in production, facelifted, and was also sold as a Mazda Rustler. ===Latin America=== Brazilian Escorts were introduced only shortly after the European originals, in August 1983. At first, only the CHT 1.6-liter engine was available, running on alcohol or petrol and in a more powerful XR3 version only running on alcohol. Power was up marginally over the previous generation. As of May 1989, the 1.8 L AP engine made by Volkswagen became available. This was part of the AutoLatina agreement, where Ford CHT engines were used in Volkswagen cars and vice versa. The 1.0 L and 1.6 L were all Ford CHT motors. All Escorts made after 1993 were fuel-injected, excepting the Hobby models. Additionally, the Mark IV model was made until 1992 on all versions, except the Hobby which was made until 1996. This generation was only built with three doors in Brazil, although the five-door model was produced in Argentina. The advent of Mercosur opened the door for trade with Brazil's neighbours. In late 1991, for the 1992 model year, the Argentinian-made five-door became available in Brazil under the name \\"Escort Guaruj√°\\" (named after a town in the state of S√£o Paulo). This was only available with a catalyzed version of the 1.8-liter \\"AP\\" engine and a high standard of equipment, including the Ghia's body- coloured rear spoiler and distinct, eight-hole alloy wheels. The Guaruj√° was the first catalyzed car to be built in Argentina, although it was not available in its home market. It sold well initially, leading all other imports in January 1992. However, Argentinian products had a low reputation in Brazil at the time and the Guaruj√° only remained on the market for about a year. The more powerful Volkswagen engine finally allowed the XR3, now with , to live up to the promises made by its appearance. In 1990, the XR3 gained body-colored skirts and wings. Argentinian production had begun in 1988 with many parts imported from Brazil, although the five-door model was available there from the beginning and the engine options differed. The original versions were the GL and Ghia, both fitted with the 1.6-liter CHT; these were then replaced by the Volkswagen-made AP 1.6 (not used in Brazilian Escorts) in the Escort 1.6 LX and Ghia SX after a little over a year. There was also the 1.8-liter Ghia S - close in spec to the Guaruj√° export version, and with available air conditioning - and the sporty XR3. The convertible was available, shipped in fully built from Brazil. The fourth generation Escort remained in production in Argentina until 1994. In 1993, the Escort Hobby trim was introduced in Brazil, using a 1.0 L engine. This was a small-bore version derived from the CHT 1.3 L used in the Brazilian Mk III. This engine was unique to Brazil, whereas the 1.1 L engine was smallest available in most markets. The 1.0 was less powerful, but fuel efficient. Brazil has a special tax break for cars with engines of less than one litre, making this a closely contested segment. The Hobby did not receive Escort badging. There were no trims with a high-power engine in Brazil. The most powerful Escort was the 1991 Escort XR3 Formula which had . The on-board computer was not available in Brazil. ==Fifth generation (1990‚Äì1997)== The Escort Mark V (and Mark III Orion saloon) arrived in September 1990 with an all-new bodyshell and a simplified torsion beam rear suspension (instead of the Mark III's fully independent layout). Initially the 1.3 L HCS, 1.4 L and 1.6 L CVH petrol and 1.8 L diesel units were carried over from the old model. This model however was poorly received by the motoring press, and was panned by journalists for its mediocre driving dynamics and unremarkable styling. The engines which had been carried over from the previous generation largely unmodified were also heavily criticised for their poor refinement. In early 1992, an all new Zetec 16-valve engine was launched bringing improved driveability, while also marking the return of the XR3i which was available with two versions of the 1.8 L Zetec engine. The 150 PS (110 kW) RS2000 also appeared in the autumn of 1991 with a 16v version of the Sierra's I4 2.0 L engine and also improved ride and handling meaning that this version of the Escort finally delivered on the road. Specifications, however, were also higher than before. The Escort was now available with items such as power steering, electric windows, central locking, electronic antilock brakes, and air conditioning. Some of these options were even available on some of the entry-level models. ===South America=== The fifth generation Escort was launched in South America in December 1992, being manufactured in Brazil and Argentina by AutoLatina, a joint-venture between Volkswagen and Ford. A result of this collaboration was that these Escorts were equipped with a VW AP engine in the top 1.8 and 2.0 L versions, now fitted with catalytic converters. The top of the line was the Escort XR3i, equipped with a multipoint fuel injected version of the VW AP 2.0 L engine generating 115 PS (85 kW). The entry-level Escorts received the old Renault-derived 1.6-liter CHT engine with ,Automobil Revue 1994, p. 282 while the earlier Mark IV continued to be available as the Escort Hobby, with a 1.0 or 1.6-liter engine. Three- and five-door hatchbacks were available, as was a two-door convertible. In October 1993 the Verona appeared, a rebadged Orion/Escort saloon. The Verona was not available in Argentina. This generation also spawned two VW-branded cars with the same mechanics (but different body styles and interiors) called Volkswagen Pointer (five-door hatchback) and Logus (a two-door saloon). In 1996, just before being redesigned to match the European Mark VI, Brazilian production came to a halt and Argentina became the sole Escort manufacturer in South America. The cars were exported to Brazil and elsewhere. The facelifted Mark V was never built in South America. ===Escort RS Cosworth=== Mk5 Ford Escorts: XR3i cabriolet and behind it an RS Cosworth Early 1992 saw the launch of the Escort RS Cosworth. Intended to replace the Sierra Sapphire RS Cosworth (which finished production shortly afterwards) as Ford's stalwart rally challenger as well as a competitor to supercars with private buyers, it used the turbocharged 2.0 L Cosworth 16-valve engine, generated some 227 PS (167 kW) and was capable of 150 mph. As well as having four-wheel drive, its most memorable feature was its extremely large \\"whale-tail\\" tailgate spoiler. The 2,500 road-going examples sold (required for homologation purposes) were made, but demand for the car was so high that Ford kept producing them. Later models (1995 up) have a smaller turbo than the homologation versions and came with the whale-tail spoiler as an option. The Escort Cosworth ceased production in 1996, but it has already achieved classic status and has a huge following. However, the car wasn't mechanically an Escort, being based on the four-wheel drive Sierra floorpan and mechanicals, including its longitudinally mounted engine, and was merely clothed in body panels to resemble a Mark V. ===Engines=== * 1.3 L (1297 cc) HCS * 1.4 L CFi (1392 cc) CVH * 1.4 L EFi (1392 cc) CVH * 1.6 L G/H (1597 cc) CVH * 1.6 L EFi (1597 cc) CVH * 1.6 L EFi (1598 cc) Zetec * 1.8 L EFi (1796 cc) Zetec * 1.8 L EFi (1796 cc) Zetec * 1.8 L EFi (1796 cc) Zetec * 1.8 L D (1753 cc) Endura D * 1.8 L TD (1753 cc) Endura D * 1.8 L TD (1753 cc) Endura D * 1.8 L TD (1753 cc) Endura D * 2.0 L EFi (1998 cc) I4 DOHC * 2.0 L (1993 cc) Cosworth YBT * 1.8 L (1781 cc) VW AP * 2.0 L (1984 cc) VW AP ===Facelift=== Front view of 5-door hatchback (post facelift) Stung by the criticism of the original Mark V (which was still hugely popular despite motoring press criticism of its styling, ride and handling), Ford facelifted the Escort and Orion in September 1992, giving the revised cars a new grille, bonnet and, in the Escort convertible and hatchback's case, a new rear end. A new 1.6 L 16-valve 90 bhp (66 kW) Zetec engine was introduced, replacing the previous CVH. Fuel injection was now standard on all petrol models, and Ford introduced a four-wheel-drive variant of the RS2000, offering much improved handling over its front-wheel-drive cousins. A first for the Escort also saw the introduction of all disc brakes on all four wheels as standard on all RS2000 and XR3i models. Also new for 1993 were 1.3 L and 1.4 L CFi petrol engines and 1.8 L diesel engines. In September 1993, the Orion name was retired, with the saloon taking on the Escort badge. The XR3i was discontinued several months later, at the beginning of 1994. The crash structure of the Escort and Orion was also improved for 1993 as part of the facelift, featuring side impact bars, a reinforced safety cage, improved crumple zones and front seat-belt pretensioners and for 1994 airbags were added to the Escort range. This Escort was the first European Ford after the Mondeo to feature an airbag; shortly afterwards a driver's airbag became standard across the whole Ford range, with many other models having a passenger airbag as at least optional equipment. Production ended in 1995, although stocks including the Escort, Escort L, Ghia and Si continued through 1996 and finished in 1997.

This version had new front lights, bonnet, front wings, front and rear bumpers, wing mirrors, door handles and 4 different front radiator grilles (slats, honeycomb, circles and chrome). At the rear, the Ford logo moved from the right to the centre of the boot, except for the van and some convertible models. The interior of the car was hugely revised too following heavy criticism of the original 1990 car which featured low quality plastics for its interior mouldings - the car now featured an all new dashboard arrangement of competitive quality. However, the underlying car was now five years old and most of its rivals were either new or to be imminently replaced. The two entry level engines were revised ‚Äì the 1.3 L received the latest version of the Kent/Valencia family ‚Äì the Endura-E from the recently launched Mk IV Fiesta and Ka, whilst the 1.4L CVH was replaced by the updated CVH-PTE unit. There were no changes to either the venerable 1.8 diesel or the 1.6/1.8 Zetec units at the top end of the range. The improved iB5 version of the venerable BC-series transmission was also later introduced as a running change. Dynamically, the handling and ride were also much improved with revised suspension set up from that on the previous Mark V models. The sporty \\"Si\\" model had slightly stiffer suspension than the Encore, LX and Ghia variants, although the Si was otherwise the same as the LX with some additional standard, mainly cosmetic, enhancements such as front and rear spoilers (which were also available as options on the LX), sports seats and white-faced dashboard instruments. Some special trim levels of the Escort include: Calypso Cabriolet, Freedom, Serenade, and Mexico. 1996 Ford Escort RS2000. The last Escort to wear the famous RS badge. The RS2000 models ceased production in June 1996, and were the last Escorts ever to wear the famous RS badge. The RS badge did not resurface until the Focus RS arrived in 2002. A new Ghia X model was introduced around 1996, which included air conditioning and a 6 CD autochanger as standard. Although the equipment of the Ghia below it was reduced, it was now more affordable. The last \\"standard\\" model to be introduced in 1997 was the GTi ‚Äî the only GTi-badged Ford to ever be sold in Europe. This used the same existing 115 PS (85 kW) 1.8 L Zetec-E engine found in other cars in the range, but included a body kit borrowed from the now cancelled RS2000 model, part-leather seats plus the standard fitment of ABS. The GTi was available in 3- and 5-door hatchback and estate bodystyles. In Chile, to avoid confusion with the US-market Escort which was being sold alongside it, this generation was sold as the \\"EuroEscort\\" for several years. ===Escort Classic=== A late Escort \\"Finesse\\" from 2000 In 1998, Ford announced an all-new car, the Focus, which replaced the Escort and superseded the \\"Escort\\" name that had been in use for 30 years. The Escort range was cut down to just \\"Flight\\" and \\"Finesse\\" editions, and sold for a further two years in parallel with the Focus. All engines except the 1.6 L petrol and 1.8 L turbo diesel were dropped, as were the three-door hatchback, four-door saloon and cabriolet bodystyles (except in mainland Europe, New Zealand, South Africa and South America). The Flight cost ¬£10,380 and offered electric front windows, a three-speed fan and a cassette player. For an additional ¬£1,000 the Finesse added alloy wheels, air conditioning, a CD player, fog lamps and metallic paint. The more competitive prices managed to keep European Escort sales going until the last one rolled off the Halewood assembly line in July 2000, although remaining stocks were sold into 2001, making it the last Ford car to be assembled there. The plant was transferred to Jaguar that year for the new X-Type saloon, and following the later merger with Land Rover and the sale of the plant to Tata, Ford now only has a small presence at Halewood - retaining the transmission works at the site. ===Van=== The van variant remained in production in a facility located behind the now Jaguar plant at Halewood until 2002 when the new Transit Connect model was introduced. The Escort hatchback and estate were produced in Argentina until 2004, having been sold alongside its successor (the Focus) during the final stages of production. Escort-based light vans had been offered since 1968, although the market sector, always larger in the UK than in continental Europe, dated back beyond the 1950s when successive Ford Anglias had been available with a van variant. After the demise of the Escort, Ford would be represented in this niche by the Turkish assembled Ford Transit Connect. ===New Zealand=== While this generation was not sold in Australia at any point, it was however sold in New Zealand imported fully built up from the UK between 1996 and 1998 in all bodystyles including the van, replacing the Ford Laser. The hatch and saloon were discontinued in 1999 due to unfavourable exchange rates - this is also the reason why the Laser was reintroduced, and the Focus was not introduced to the New Zealand market until 2003. The Escort estate and van continued on sale on the local market until 1999 until stock from the UK dried up, the estate having reasonable success due to the lack of a replacement Laser wagon following the end of local production of the outdated 1980s KE Laser wagon in 1996. 1.6 or 1.8-litre petrol and the diesel 1.8 were available. ===Engines=== { !Model!!Modelyear!!Engine!!Displacement!!Power / rpm.!!Torque / rpm.!!Top Speed!!fuel system - 1.3 CFi/H Endura-E1995-1998OHV 8V inline-four1299 cc / 5000 / 2500 rowspan=\\"6\\" petrol, fuel injection - 1.4 EFi CVH-PTE1995-1998SOHC 8V inline-four1392 cc / 5500 / 2750 - 1.6 EFi Zetec1995-2000 rowspan=\\"4\\" DOHC 16V inline- four1597 cc / 5500 / 3000 - 1.8 EFI Zetec1996-19981796 cc / 5750 / 4500 - 1.8 EFI ZETEC 1996-98 1796 cc  / 6250  / 4500  - RS2000 I4 DOHC19961988 cc / 6000 / 4500 - 1.8 D Endura D1995-98rowspan=\\"3\\" SOHC 8V inline-fourrowspan=\\"3\\"  1753 cc / 4800 / 2500diesel - 1.8 TD Endura D1995-98 / 4500 / 2500 rowspan=\\"2\\" turbodiesel - 1.8 TDi Endura D1995-00 / 4500 / 2000‚àí2500 } ==See also== * Ford Escort RS Cosworth * Ford Verona ==ReferencesBibliography== * * ford Britain .co.uk ==External links== * Escort Category:Euro NCAP small family cars Category:Station wagons Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Convertibles Category:Hatchbacks Category:Hot hatches Category:Sedans Category:Rally cars Category:Touring cars Category:Cars introduced in 1967 Category:1970s cars Category:1980s cars Category:1990s cars Category:2000s cars Category:Cars of Turkey Category:Group 4 cars Category:Vehicles with CVT transmission ","title":"Ford Escort (Europe)"},{"id":"2227751","text":"are a fictional race of creatures primarily in Nippon Ichi's Disgaea series of role-playing games. First appearing in Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, they have appeared in all later titles by the company, as well as on various merchandise such as hats and plush toys. With a few notable exceptions, they are voiced by Junji Majima in Japanese releases and Grant George in the English releases from Disgaea: Hour of Darkness to Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten. The Prinnies are regarded as the mascots for the Disgaea series and have received generally positive reception. ==Concept and creation== The Prinny was created by Takehito Harada while he was trying to come up with a character whose thoughts players could not try to envision. He began by choosing to make it animal-based, eventually deciding on making something similar to a penguin. He was told that he could use this character as much as he wanted. While it initially started out as looking somewhat realistic, it eventually gained a doll-like form. ==Appearances== A prinny is a small, usually blue, pouch- wearing penguin-like creature with disproportionately small bat wings, two peg legs where feet would normally be, and stitches at the top of the chest. When thrown, they explode on impact. A common trait of prinnies is their upbeat attitude and tendency to end their sentences with \\"-ssu\\". In the English translation, they frequently use \\"dood\\" as an interjection. Prinnies stand roughly three feet, three inches (100 cm) tall, though the weight can vary. Prinnies attack with knives, bombs, and occasionally other weapons stored in their bags. While rarely mentioned in the game, prinnies have been known to dispense a beverage known as prinny juice, which according to a Nippon Ichi Software America interview is produced from \\"the most flavorful and delicious parts of our fresh, vine-grown Prinnies\\". In Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, humans who have led a worthless life, such as thieves or murderers, or have committed a mortal sin such as suicide, have their souls sewn into the body of a prinny upon their death. Due to the unstable soul of a human,Takehito, Harada (2008), World of Disgaea, Volume 2. Broccoli Books. p. 100. regular prinnies will explode when they hit something with great force, such as when thrown.Takehito, Harada (2008), World of Disgaea, Volume 2. Broccoli Books. p. 84. However, Prinny suits filled with demon souls, as seen in Makai Kingdom or in the case of recurring boss Baal, will not. After being reborn, the newly created prinny will serve as a soldier, slave, or servant in the Netherworld or Celestia. The prinny remains until it has earned reincarnation by redemption through good deeds or earning enough money, and leaves its servitude in a ritual involving the Red Moon. In Celestia, prinnies mostly act as maids and domestic servants. The good deeds they perform there lead to their reincarnation. In the Netherworld, depending on the lord they serve, they spend their difficult after-lives doing excessively hard labor for very little pay, and are often thrown around just for the amusement of their lords. The pittance of money they earn in the Netherworld goes towards their reincarnation. Some prinnies live in Prinny Land, their own world in which prinnies do not explode when thrown. Some prinnies flee there to escape their lives in the Netherworld, and some may have rebelled or have been banished there. Another place prinnies can be found is the Land of Carnage. These prinnies live for battle and look down on newcomers. While prinnies manage all shops and such, an old friend can be found here too. Prinny Kurtis makes a comeback as a Land of Carnage only character. The player can summon Kurtis with cell phones and pass some bills from the Earth Defense Forces to aid him, it is not needed to gain access to Kurtis. In the Land of Carnage, the prinnies call warriors who fight hundreds of thousands of battles \\"Shura.\\" Rumor has it, there is a prinny who has lived in the Land of Carnage longer than anyone else and is the master of the land. Prinnies have appeared in almost every major Nippon Ichi video game; their first appearance was in the game Disgaea: Hour of Darkness. Prinnies follow a ranking system, starting at Private Prinny and moving up to Prinny God. The \\"Uber Prinny\\", which is the prinny form of Baal, cannot be utilized by players. Prinnies are usually under Etna's control. In Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories they lead the Dark Court and are responsible for judging the party's crimes, of which a guilty verdict will always be passed. In general the felonies applied by the Dark Court are to the player's benefit but if one wants to remove them from a character for various reasons then the character must reincarnate as a Prinny to atone for their sins. Unlike most other incarnations, prinny gods do not have immunity to status effects. In Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice, a special Prinny under the title Hero Prinny appears as part of special downloadable content. The Hero Prinny claims that he has come to make a guest appearance from Prinny: Can I Really Be The Hero?, but Mao doesn't believe him. It ends up that Mao defeats and captures Hero Prinny, and turns him into a hero. The Hero Prinny then becomes playable. Prinnies star in their own game Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero? for the PSP handheld console. In Makai Kingdom: Chronicles of the Sacred Tome, prinnies are said to possess the soul of a demon, rather than that of a human. Their bodies are manufactured in Ruskan factories, located in another dimension, by inventor demons. In order to create Prinny units in Makai Kingdom, the player must first make a wish to create Prinnies in The Sacred Tome. Then the first Prinny class will become available to create. The weaponry available to a prinny is expanded to include expertise with shovels and wrenches. The Prinnies do not explode when thrown. Prinnies appear in Phantom Brave, which does not use a subclass system, and are able to use all weapon types, but have a smaller role in the game's plot. Pringer X serves as the final challenge of the bonus storyline. Phantom Brave's Prinnies cause explosions upon being summoned or unsummoned, these explosions do not injure the Prinny itself. Airborne prinnies make an appearance in Tori no Hoshi: Aerial Planet, a game similar to Pilotwings, used to add a \\"Nippon Ichi flavor\\" to the title. The crossover role playing game Cross Edge features a prinny and Etna. They also appeared in Trinity Universe, a crossover game with characters from Idea Factory, Nippon Ichi, and Gust Corporation. Nippon Ichi's characters include the Prinny as well as Etna and Flonne. A giant Prinny appeared as a special attack in the company-collaborative RPG, Hyperdimension Neptunia Mk2, where the in-game character Nisa (named Nippon Ichi in the Japanese version) throws a bunch of kunais at enemies, then throws the giant Prinny at the enemies, which results in a nuclear bomb type explosion. Nisa is also designed to resemble a Prinny. A Prinny cap is unlockable in the 3D remake of the 2004 Cave Story, published by Nippon Ichi Software. Prinny also appear in the PS3 Exclusive title Last Rebellion as optional bosses to be faced in the final mirror when entered as Nine. ===In other media=== Prinny appeared in a Penny Arcade comic strip on September 4, 2006. Prinny also appears as a recurring character in Fred Perry's LvlUp! comic series. ==Promotion and reception== Prinnies are regarded as mascots for the Disgaea series, featuring strongly in Nippon Ichi's marketing such as the annual Tipsy Prinny press events. The third event, held in the Zebulon Bar San Francisco on June 5, 2008, featured green Prinnies suspended from every banister and light fitting. Nippon Ichi Software's online store sells various merchandise such as several different Prinny plushies,\\"PlayStation: The Official Magazine Holiday Gift Guide '08,\\" PlayStation: The Official Magazine 13 (Holiday 2008): 37.ÈñãÂÇ¨ÊúüÈñìÔºö2008Âπ¥11Êúà20Êó•(Êú®) ÔΩû 2009Âπ¥ÔºëÊúà11Êó•(Êúà„ÉªÁ•ù) (in Japanese).

Sharing its name with the third-generation European Ford Escort, the model line is the first front-wheel drive Ford developed and sold in North America. The direct successor of the Ford Pinto, as the smallest Ford car in North America, the Escort largely replaced the European-imported Ford Fiesta. Overcoming the tarnished reputation for quality and safety established by the fuel tank defect of the Pinto, the Escort became highly successful in the American marketplace. After 1982, the model line became the best-selling car in the United States, a position it held during most of the 1980s. The 1981 replacement of the Pinto by the Escort was the first Ford model line to adapt front-wheel drive. By the end of the 1980s, nearly the entire Ford car range would adopt the powertrain layout (with the sole exception of the Mustang, Thunderbird, and LTD Crown Victoria/Country Squire). The Escort was produced across three generations. The first was the first Ford \\"world car\\", designed as Ford of Europe transitioned the Escort Mk III to front-wheel drive. In North America, the model line was also sold as the Mercury Lynx and the two-seat Ford EXP/Mercury LN7 (no version was sold by the Lincoln division). Introduced for 1991, the second generation became a near-twin of the Mazda-designed Ford Laser (a model line sold in Asia and Oceania); sharing a platform and powertrain with the Mazda 323, the Escort grew into the compact car segment. The second generation was also sold as the Mercury Tracer. For 1997, the third generation was an extensive redesign of the second-generation platform Escort sedan, introducing the ZX2 coupe; Mercury continued to sell the Tracer sedan/wagon. For the 1999 model year, the Ford Focus succeeded the Escort as the compact model line as a new-generation \\"world car\\"; after the 2000 model year, the Escort shifted primarily to fleet sales, ending production after the 2002 model year. During its entire production, the Escort was produced by Wayne Stamping & Assembly (Wayne, Michigan) and Hermosillo Stamping and Assembly (Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico); the first generation was also produced by Edison Assembly (Edison, New Jersey), San Jose Assembly Plant (Milpitas, California), and Oakville Assembly (Oakville, Ontario, Canada) ==First generation (1981‚Äì1990)== The first North American Escort went on sale on October 3, 1980 for the 1981 model year, along with its corporate twin, the Mercury Lynx. It was intended to share common components with the European Mk III Escort. It was launched with a , 1.6-liter hemi overhead cam inline-four. It was available as a three-door hatchback and as a five-door station wagon, with a four-speed manual or a three-speed automatic. The five-door hatchback was first shown in May 1981. The North American Escort had considerably more chrome than Escorts sold elsewhere (except for the 1981 SS model and 1982+ GT models which feature blacked out trim). 1981 models never had the blue oval logo; on the front fenders there was an Escort badge which included a globe representing the earth, which implied this was a \\"World Car\\". The car was freshened in 1982, and added Ford's blue oval logo for the first time along with a new grille. For 1982 models, the base price of the Escort 3-door was $5,518. The engine was also uprated, to . In March 1982 a HO (High Output) version of the engine was added, originally only in the EXP and with an automatic transmission, but soon thereafter available with a manual and also in the sporting Escort GT. This unit produces , thanks to a higher compression ratio, a new exhaust system, and larger venturis in the carburetor. In addition to the HO engine, the GT featured cosmetic changes such as \\"GT\\" emblems and stripes, while under the shell there were uprated brakes and a close-ratio four-speed gearbox. Also included were metric TR sport wheels with Michelin TRX tires. For 1984, the GLX model was dropped and replaced with a fuel injected LX model, available as a five-door hatchback or wagon, with a GT engine, blackout trim, and styled cast aluminum wheels. The interior received a new dashboard, and a new rubber shift boot for manual models; automatic models received a new gear selector lever with a straight line for gear selection instead of the twisting \\"?\\" mark pattern of the previous models. Flush headlamps, revised taillamps and restyled steel wheels appeared when the Escort was revised and introduced as the 1985¬Ω Ford Escort. There was also the Ford EXP, and sister version Mercury LN7, targeting the sports car market, essentially a two-seat hatch with lower roofline which was not as successful as other body styles. Although the basic silhouette was the same, it was almost completely different from the European version, apart from the Ford CVH engine. There was a 1.6 L engine, a 4-speed MTX-2 and a 5-speed MTX-3 manual transmission as standard options, and an optional 3-speed ATX/FLC automatic transmission. A 1.3 L engine was designed and prototyped but did not see production due to lack of power, and an inability to get it certified. Beginning in 1983, a GT model offered a multi- port EFI version of the 1.6 L four-cylinder that increased power by 20 hp over the base carbureted version. It also came with a 5-speed transmission, TRX handling package, front and rear spoilers, metric-sized alloy wheels and fog lights. Also beginning with the 1984 model year, the Ford EXP received the option of the turbocharged 1.6 L four-cylinder rated at and matching torque. The turbo engine then found its way into the Escort GT (and Lynx RS) as well during the 1984 model year. 1984 was also the year that Mazda's 2-liter diesel engine became available in the Escort and Lynx. ===Engines=== * 1981‚Äì1985 1.6 L CVH I4, * 1982‚Äì1985 1.6 L CVH High Output (HO) I4, * 1983‚Äì1985 1.6 L CVH Multi-port Fuel Injected (MFI) I4, * 1984‚Äì1985 1.6 L turbocharged CVH I4, * 1984‚Äì1985 2.0 L RF diesel I4, ===1985‚Äì1990=== The 1985¬Ω model received a facelift (less chrome, restyled tail lamps, flush headlights), and the 1.6 L engine was replaced with a 1.9 L. GT models featured a high output engine with revised intake manifold, cylinder head and a real header available only with a manual transmission. The Lynx was retired for 1987, but was replaced by the Mazda 323-derived Tracer model. [This Mazda platform was revamped in 1989 and debuted as the 1990 Mazda Protege. The updated platform would form the basis for the next generation (1990‚Äì1996) Escort/Tracer.] The Escort saw another minor facelift in mid-1988, which smoothed out the front and rear fascias. New plastic bumpers (which replaced the metal bumpers), larger rear side windows, a more rounded rear-end design and larger (14 inch versus 13 inch) wheels modernized the look of the cars. Three-door hatchback models had a curving windowline along the side towards the rear of the car. The engine was also updated with a slightly revised camshaft and roller lifters. The new design is commonly referred to as the \\"88.5\\" year, and existed until the end of the 1990 model year. Finding some popularity during the final three years of this generation was the Pony model, which was the least-expensive U.S.-built Ford at the time. Pony models used plainer interior trim with greater use of vinyl and plastic instead of cloth, and a 4-speed manual transaxle was standard, although buyers could opt for the 5-speed found in LX models or the 3-speed ATX automatic. The list of available options was very limited, to the extent that such luxuries as power steering and factory-installed air conditioning were not offered (a dealer-installed A/C system was available). Given their lighter weight, Pony models were known for their ability to deliver excellent fuel economy‚Äîmileage upwards of in highway driving was not uncommon.

Original trims were base, L, GL, GLX and SS. Mercury Lynx is the Escort's twin. 1982 - The GT replaced the SS. There were now new trims as the base, L, GL, GLX, GT And LX == Second generation (1991‚Äì1996) == For 1991, the Escort and the Mercury Tracer were replaced by models based on the Mazda B platform (BG), which was also used by the Mazda 323, Proteg√© and first generation Kia Sephia. Ford, which owned a 25% stake in Mazda, already sold a version of the 323/Familia in Asia and Australasia, called the Ford Laser, which had replaced the old rear-wheel drive Escort there. Although the Escort was now essentially a twin of the Laser instead of the European Escort, it kept the Escort name in North America due to strong brand equity on the Escort name as well as Chrysler already using the Laser name on the Plymouth equivalent of the Mitsubishi Eclipse. The prior Escort used localized engines and shared some elements of design with the European model. The Escort for the 1990s, however, would be almost identical to the Ford Laser and its derivatives, with minor differences in appearance and base engine. While the Laser would feature identical powertrains to the Mazda Familia, the Escort carried over the 1.9 liter 8-valve Ford-designed CVH engine from the previous Escort, with the GT and LX-E receiving the Mazda-built 1.8 L BP I4. Much of the external styling mimicked the first generation Ford Taurus, no doubt Ford's hope to give the Escort the appeal of that successful model. This generation of the Escort was one of the first Ford automobiles to feature, on the 1.9 L engine, distributorless ignition (known as EDIS, Electronic Distributorless Ignition System). It also featured a new electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission, as well as an independent rear suspension, both (at the time) relatively uncommon in cars in this class. The Mazda-based model sold sluggishly in America at first, since only hatchback models were offered upon launch, but became popular later by 1992, after the sedan was introduced, available in either LX or LX-E trim levels. For the 1993‚Äì1995 model years, Ford offered the Escort on a \\"one price\\" basis, with the same price for a three- or five-door hatchback, a sedan or a wagon when equipped with the most popular options (3-doors quickly added alloy wheels to the \\"one price\\" specification). The LX-E, equipped with the same sporting equipment as the GT and Mazda Proteg√© LX (four-wheel disc brakes, larger front brakes, larger clutch, equal-length driveshafts, larger anti-roll bars, dual-outlet exhaust, sport interior and 1.8 L Mazda DOHC 16-valve engine), lasted only until 1993. The Pony departed in 1992, replaced by the Standard trim level. Trim levels were originally Pony, LX, and GT. The GT was the North American equivalent of the Laser XR3i version, featuring a 1.8 L Mazda DOHC engine. The LX and Standard or Pony were equipped with the 1.9 L overhead cam 8-valve CVH inline 4. The Pony or later Standard was the base trim level, lacking most features like power steering or a radio. The LX was the upscale trim level, and a Sport package could be added to make it look like a GT. Subtle differences can be noticed in all three Escort models (sedan, hatchback and wagon) from 1990 to 1996. In 1992, the grill oval hall around the \\"Ford\\" emblem became a little larger in order to allow more air to enter under the hood to cool the engine. In 1993, the wheel size was changed from 13 inches to 14 inches and the black exterior door handles were changed to match the exterior color of the car. A driver's airbag was introduced in 1993 as well, and by 1994, both driver and passenger airbags were standard with the redesigned dash for the 1995 model year. ===Engines=== * 1990‚Äì1996 1.9 L (1859 cc) CVH I4, , Standard/Pony and LX * 1990‚Äì1996 1.8 L (1839 cc) Mazda BP I4, , LX-E and GT ==Third generation (1997‚Äì2003)== The restyle dropped the hatchbacks and added a new sporty coupe for the 1997 model year. The 1998 Escort ZX2 replaced the Ford Probe as Ford's sport compact car. The ZX2 was a much lower-slung and rakish car than either the Escort sedan and wagon, aimed squarely at the youth market as a replacement for the Escort GT (although lacking the latter's rear disc brake setup) and was built exclusively at Ford's Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico assembly plant. The interior was refreshed for 1999, and the model was retired after 2003. It had a completely redesigned dashboard, and included a panel that unified the heat and radio controls, similar to that of the third generation Ford Taurus. The 1998 Escort ZX2 coupe featured the 2.0 L, Zetec DOHC four- cylinder engine as standard equipment, an option unavailable on the sedan or wagon. Intended for use as the base engine in the larger European Ford Mondeo and its American cousins, the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique, the Zetec gave the ZX2 more-than-respectable performance, running 0‚Äì60 in 7.4 seconds. The 1999 and 2000 models offered a performance limited edition ZX2 S/R which further enhanced the car's performance in every aspect. The Escort sedan and wagon used the lower-powered CVH SPI2000 engine with . Subtle differences can be noticed in the Escort sedan from 1996 to 2002. The trim lines for 1997 were base and LX, for 1998‚Äì2002 it was offered in LX and SE trims. For 1999, the reverse lights were moved into the same piece as the tail lamps; they were previously below the tail lamp on the body. A very rare trim package could be found with chrome wheel covers and other features. It was offered in 1999. Ford Escort sedan Ford Escort LX wagon The Escort was offered in a Sport package as well. The Mercury Tracer's version was called the Trio or Sport depending on the year. A basketweave type of wheel was put on the Tracer Trio while a flower petal pattern was used on the Tracer Sport. The Sport/Trio package included aluminum wheels, sport exhaust tip, a tachometer, and a rear decklid spoiler. The Escort wagon largely retained the same body style, gaining only the new interior, front end & fascia, side-view mirrors, door handles, badging, and slightly restyled taillamps & reflectors. The black window frames on the doors of some models became body-colored. Both the Escort wagon and the Mercury Tracer sedan and wagon were discontinued after 1999. The Escort sedan was discontinued in 2002, but continued to be sold as fleet & rental cars only. It was replaced by the Ford Focus . The last Ford Escort rolled off the assembly line on February 20, 2002. The last ZX2 rolled off the assembly line on March 21, 2003. In Mexico, it was replaced by the smaller Ford Ikon. ===Engines=== * 1997‚Äì2002 2.0 L (1986 cc) CVH SPI2000, SOHC I4, @ 5000 rpm, @ 3750 rpm, redline 5500 rpm Sedan and Wagon * 1998‚Äì2003 2.0 L (1989 cc) Zetec, DOHC I4, @ 5750 rpm, @ 4250 rpm, redline 6500 rpm, 7200 rpm rev limiter ZX2 * 1999‚Äì2000 2.0 L (1989 cc) Zetec, DOHC I4, , ZX2 S/R ==ZX2== 2003 Ford ZX2 For 2001, the 4-door sedan was limited to fleet sales only and the Escort moniker on the Escort ZX2 was quietly dropped, making the car officially just ZX2 as a 2-door notchback coupe. The Ford Focus debuted in 1998 (1999 in U.S.) and was produced concurrently with the ZX2. Though not without its fans, both then and now, and still fairly well represented in the automotive aftermarket, the ZX2 was replaced by the Focus ZX3, ZX4 and ZX5. Though the two cars shared the same Zetec engine, there were a few differences. The Focus lacked the exhaust-side VCT, and contained less aggressive camshafts that pushed the power band down a few hundred RPM. The two models shared the same block but, due to the different camshafts and the different cylinder head, the torque output for the Focus was bumped up by . Thanks to better gearing and less weight, the ZX2 continued to outperform the Focus. The ZX2 continued with little more than alloy wheels and a rear defroster now offered as standard equipment, and for 2003, a revised front fascia. Production ceased at the end of the 2003 model year. ===ZX2 S/R=== The increased presence and success of tuner models from overseas in the late 90s caused Ford to create their own performance model, the ZX2 S/R. Meant to compete with cheap factory performance sport compacts such as the Honda Civic Si or the Dodge Neon ACR, Ford created the ZX2 S/R to show that they had plenty to bring to the table. Its initial debut was at SEMA's Import Auto Salon in Pomona in 1999. The ZX2 S/R was the first product jointly developed by Ford Racing and Ford Motor Company's Small Vehicle Center Product Development. Ford's final limited production count was 2,110 units, consisting of 110 yellow S/Rs for 1999, the first two of which were sold in Columbus, Ohio, and the other 108 in California; and for 2000, 500 black, 500 red and 1,000 yellow S/Rs were sold. The upgrade price to the S/R package was $1,500 in both years. It is believed that only 35 of those 2000 S/Rs were sold in Canada, making it a very rare trim there. The optional S/R package adds stiffer suspension parts (Eibach springs (M-5560-Z2), Tokico struts (M-18000-Z2) and Energy Suspension brand polyurethane suspension bushings), more power (through a Ford Racing PCM (M-12650-Z2)), more efficient intake (Roush or Iceman), rear disc brakes (M-2300-Z2), a stronger clutch (Centerforce dual friction M-7560-Z2), a short-throw B&M; manual-transmission shifter (M-7210-Z2), an S/R-unique shift knob (M-7213-Z2) and boot (M-7277-Z2), upgraded seats, a unique blue valve cover, a different speed cluster that goes up to and a unique tire/wheel package. Engine power was increased 10% over the base Zetec engine used in the ZX2 to , courtesy of a recommended premium fuel re-calibration, new air inlet system, the performance PCM, improved Borla muffler and pipe (M-5230-Z2). All ZX2 S/R have a special \\"S/R\\" badge on the back, either silver (on a red car) or red (on a yellow or black car). Some S/R went out of the assembly plant without some of the performance mods (example: missing the Centerforce clutch). The suspension bushings were not installed at the factory but instead packaged with the car for installation at the dealership. This also led to many cars leaving the showroom without the full complement of S/R parts. ==Sales== {  -ross's s10 is way cooler ! Calendar Year !

It is one of the predecessors of the present day Audi company, which itself resulted from the merger of Auto Union Aktiengesellschaft (AG) and NSU Motorenwerke in 1969. Auto Union AG in turn was formed in 1932, following the merger of Horch DKW, Wanderer and the original Audi Automobilwerke GmbH Zwickau, established by August Horch in 1910. According to insiders, a resurrection is planned. ==History at a glance== August Horch in his car (1908) Horch hood ornament (1924) Horch 670, 12-cylinder luxury cabriolet (1932) Horch 930 V Phaeton (1939) August Horch and his first business partner Salli Herz established the company on November 14, 1899 in the district of Ehrenfeld, Cologne in Cologne.August Horch: \\"Ich baute Autos - Vom Schmiedelehrling zum Autoindustriellen\\", Sch√ºtzen-Verlag Berlin 1937 August Horch had previously worked as a production manager for Karl Benz. Three years later, in 1902, he moved the company to Reichenbach im Vogtland. On May 10, 1904 he founded the Horch & Cie. Motorwagenwerke AG, a joint-stock company in Zwickau (Kingdom of Saxony). The city of Zwickau was the capital of the South Western Saxon County and one of Saxony's industrial centres at that time. After troubles with the Horch chief financial officer, August Horch founded a second company on 16 July 1909, the August Horch Automobilwerke GmbH in Zwickau. He had to rename the company because Horch was already a registered brand and he did not hold the rights to the name. On 25 April 1910 the name Audi Automobilwerke was entered in the company's register at the Zwickau registration court. Audi is the Latin translation of horch, from the German verb \\"horchen\\", which means \\"listen!\\" (compare English \\"hark\\"). The Audi name was proposed by a son of one of Horch's business partners from Zwickau.Audi AG motion picture 1994: 'The Silver Arrows from Zwickau, running time approx. 49 mins. In 1932 both companies from Zwickau (Horch and Audi) merged with Zschopauer Motorenwerke J. S. Rasmussen (the DKW brand) and the Wanderer car-production facilities to become the Auto Union corporation of Saxony. The Silver Arrow racing cars of the Auto Union racing team in Zwickau‚Äîdeveloped by Ferdinand Porsche and Robert Eberan von Eberhorst, and driven by Bernd Rosemeyer, Hans Stuck, Tazio Nuvolari and Ernst von Delius‚Äîbecame known the world over in the 1930s. ==Initial cars== The company initially began producing and twin-cylinder engine automobiles near Cologne in 1901. The first Horch had a engine, with an alloy crankcase, a unique achievement in those days. It had an open-body design, with lighting provided by lanterns with candles in them. In contrast with the powerful cars of later years, the first Horch could barely reach a top speed of . It was significant at that time because it used a friction clutch, and also had a drive shaft to power the wheels. The firm soon ran into financial troubles, not surprising considering the pioneering nature of the automobile business at that time. Horch had to seek new partners. In March 1902, August Horch produced a four-cylinder car with a shaft drive in Reichenbach in Vogtland. Horch cars were considered more advanced and superior to those being then built by Mercedes or Benz (who were then separate manufacturers). By 1903, Horch had built a car with a four-cylinder engine. In March of the following year, he introduced his new car at the Frankfurt Fair. In 1904, August Horch developed the first six-cylinder engine, which appeared in 1907. In 1906 a Horch automobile driven by Dr. Rudolf St√∂ss from Zwickau won the Herkomer Competition (equivalent to a 'brand-name' world championship at the time). In the 1920s, Moritz Stauss, a cosmopolitan Berliner, was the principal stockholder of the Horch company. He succeeded in making the Horch brand highly desirable by introducing art into the advertising of their products. He recognized that only a brand emphasising Horch's unique characteristics would be successful. In 1923, Paul Daimler (a Stauss associate) worked for Horch as the chief engineer for 8-cylinder engines. Horch vehicles were subsequently the first to introduce 8-cylinder engines in series production. ==Audi connection== In 1909, the supervisory board (the German equivalent of the Board of Directors) of the corporation forced out Horch. Horch went on to found Audi as Audiwerke GmbH, which became effective on 25 April 1910. The name was a solution to the legal dispute with his old company over use of the Horch brand and a clever play of words (\\"audi\\" is the literal Latin translation of the Old German \\"horch\\", meaning the imperative \\"Listen!\\"). In 1928, the company was acquired by J√∏rgen Skafte Rasmussen, owner of DKW (from the German Dampfkraftwagen, or steam engine vehicle) who had bought the remains of the US automobile manufacturer Rickenbacker in the same year. The Rickenbacker purchase included their manufacturing equipment for eight-cylinder engines. ==Auto Union== Auto Union Typ C (1936) Eventually, on 29 June 1932, Horch, Audi, DKW and Wanderer merged to form the Auto Union AG, Chemnitz affiliated group. The current Audi four-ring logo is the Auto Union logo that represents the merger of these four brands. In the 1930s, Horch introduced a new line of smaller and cheaper, but still presentable, V8 automobiles. In 1936, Horch presented the 25,000th 8-cylinder luxury car in Zwickau. The Auto Union Grand Prix racing cars types A to D, were developed and built by a specialist racing department of Horch works in Zwickau between 1933 and 1939. Between 1935 and 1937 Auto Union cars won 25 races, driven by Ernst von Delius, Tazio Nuvolari, Bernd Rosemeyer, Hans Stuck and Achille Varzi. Heavy standard passenger car Type Horch 108 (1942) Auto Union became a major supplier of vehicles to the German Wehrmacht, such as Heavy standard passenger car (Horch 108), Medium standard passenger car (Horch 901 and Wanderer 901) and Half-track Sd.Kfz. 11. Civilian production was suspended after March 1940. After the war the Auto Union AG at Chemnitz was dissolved and in Ingolstadt, West Germany the new Auto Union GmbH was founded, where civilian car production continued. Due to widespread poverty in postwar Germany, only small DKW vehicles with two stroke engines were produced. After Auto Union was purchased in 1964 by the Volkswagenwerk AG, the old brand Audi was introduced again, together with the new four stroke vehicle Audi F103. Daimler-Benz retained the trademark rights to the Horch brand until the mid 1980s. Daimler-Benz then transferred the rights to the Horch brand name to Audi who in turn signed a waiver to use the name ‚ÄûSilberpfeil‚Äú (silver-arrow) for any modern Audi racing car.The brand has, however, remained dormant. The Romanian Army purchased 300 Horch 901 4x4 field cars to mechanize some of its anti-tank companies. ==Trabant connection== During the Second World War, the factories suffered heavy bomb damage. Later, the advancing Soviet forces captured the area, and it became part of the Soviet sector of divided Germany in 1945, and later became part of East Germany. Horch P240 (Sachsenring) Cabriolet (1956) From 1955 to 1958, old Horch factories produced the Horch P240, a six-cylinder car that was respected at the time. The former Horch and Audi operations from Zwickau were unified in 1958. A new brand, Sachsenring, within the East German corporation IFA was born. After unification in 1958, the P240 car was renamed as the Sachsenring P240. As the Soviet Administration inexplicably banned the foreign exportation of the P240, the East German economic administration decided to stop production of the vehicle. IFA also produced the initial Trabant \\"P-50\\" model from 1957. The Zwickau site was acquired in 1991 by Volkswagen, effectively restoring its connection with Audi. ==Rare collectibles== On June 24, 2006, a rare 1937 Horch 853A Sport Cabriolet in original unrestored, unprepared condition sold at auction in Cortland, NY for US$299,000. In the late 1930s, Horch supplied a limited number of promotional scarves bearing the Horch logo. Sent only to the wealthiest drivers, it is a major collectible amongst diehard enthusiasts of the pre-war car era. However, there is also a degree of controversy associated with these scarves as they were commonly sought by senior SS members. 1939 Horch 853 A Cabriolet 1937 Horch 853 Voll & Ruhrbeck Sport Cabriolet ==Horch models== {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\\" - !efefef;\\"  Type !efefef;\\"  Construction !efefef;\\"  Cylinders !efefef;\\"  Displacement !efefef;\\"  Power !efefef;\\"  Top speed - 4-15 PS 1900‚Äì1903 straight-2  2.9-3.7 kW  - 10-16 PS 1902‚Äì1904 straight-2  7.4-8.8 kW  - 22-30 PS 1903 straight-4 2,725 cc 16.2-18.4 kW  - 14-20 PS 1905‚Äì1910 straight-4 2,270 cc 10.3-12.5 kW  - 18/25 PS 1904‚Äì1909 straight-4 2,725 cc 16.2 kW  - 23/50 PS 1905‚Äì1910 straight-4 5,800 cc 29 kW  - 26/65 PS 1907‚Äì1910 straight-6 7,800 cc 44 kW  - 25/60 PS 1909‚Äì1914 straight-4 6.395 cc 40 kW  - 10/30 PS 1910‚Äì1911 straight-4 2,660 cc 18.4 kW  - K (12/30 PS) 1910‚Äì1911 straight-4 3,177 cc 20.6 kW  - 15/30 PS 1910‚Äì1914 straight-4 2,608 cc 22 kW  - H (17/45 PS) 1910‚Äì1919 straight-4 4,240 cc 33 kW  - 6/18 PS 1911‚Äì1920 straight-4 1,588 cc 13.2 kW  - 8/24 PS 1911‚Äì1922 straight-4 2,080 cc 17.6 kW  - O (14/40 PS) 1912‚Äì1922 straight-4 3,560 cc 29 kW  - Pony (5/14 PS) 1914 straight-4 1,300 cc 11 kW  - 25/60 PS 1914‚Äì1920 straight-4 6,395 cc 44 kW  - 18/50 PS 1914‚Äì1922 straight-4 4,710 cc 40 kW (55 PS)  - S (33/80 PS) 1914‚Äì1922 straight-4 8,494 cc 59 kW  - 10 M 20 (10/35 PS) 1922‚Äì1924 straight-4 2,612 cc 25.7 kW  - 10 M 25 (10/50 PS) 1924‚Äì1926 straight-4 2,612 cc 37 kW  - 8 Typ 303/304 (12/60 PS) 1926‚Äì1927 straight-8 3,132 cc 44 kW  - 8 Typ 305/306 (13/65 PS) 1927‚Äì1928 straight-8 3,378 cc 48 kW  - 8 Typ 350/375/400/405 (16/80 PS) 1928‚Äì1931 straight-8 3,950 cc 59 kW  - 8 3 L Typ 430 1931‚Äì1932 straight-8 3,009-3,137 cc 48 kW (65 PS)  - 8 4 L Typ 410/440/710 1931‚Äì1933 straight-8 4,014 cc 59 kW (80 PS)  - 8 4.5 L Typ 420/450/470/720/750/750B 1931‚Äì1935 straight-8 4,517 cc 66 kW (90 PS)  - 8 5 L Typ 480/500/500A/500B/780/780B 1931‚Äì1935 straight-8 4,944 cc 74 kW (100 PS)  - 12 6 L Typ 600/670 1931‚Äì1934 V12 6,021 cc 88 kW (120 PS)  - 830 1933‚Äì1934 V8 3,004 cc 51 kW (70 PS)  - 830B 1935 V8 3,250 cc 51 kW (70 PS)  - 830Bk/830BL 1935‚Äì1936 V8 3,517 cc 55 kW (75 PS)  - 850/850 Sport 1935‚Äì1937 straight-8 4,944 cc 74 kW (100 PS)  - 830BL/930V 1937‚Äì1938 V8 3,517 cc 60 kW (82 PS)  - 830BL/930V 1938‚Äì1940 V8 3,823 cc 67.6 kW (92 PS)  - 851/853/853A/855/951/951A 1937‚Äì1940 straight-8 4,944 cc 74 kW (100 PS)  } ==See also== * List of German cars ==References Further reading == * Horch, August: Ich baute Autos.

Its name comes from that of the national hero, Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, who fought for the emancipation of the River Plate, and sought to create a federative nation from these colonies. As of the census of 2011, it is the eleventh most populous city of the country. ==Location== The city is located on the border with Brazil, separated only by a bridge from the town Quara√≠ of the state Rio Grande do Sul of Brazil. It is the farthest city from Uruguay's capital Montevideo, being away. ==History== It was founded on 12 September 1852 by Don Carlos Catal√° as the town of San Eugenio del Cuareim. On 5 September 1884 it became capital of the department. It was renamed Artigas and its status was elevated from villa (town) to ciudad (city) on 31 August 1915. ==Economy== Artigas is a centre for trading grain crops (primarily maize) with Argentina and Brazil. The railroad station and, since 1973, airport are focused on this commerce. The hills in the area contain significant numbers of precious stones, especially agate and amethyst, which were first found in 1860, since when mining has taken place.

The programme is used to fill the station's overnight downtime, where a closedown would have once been used at the end of programmes. The programme is generally shown 7 days a week with the typical weekday show airing from 3:50am ‚Äì 5:05am daily. On STV, UTV and in the Channel Islands the programme starts earlier, sometimes as early as midnight, breaking for a signed programme at 3am before resuming and occasionally in Scotland it has been known to broadcast continually from 1:00 am to 6:00 am without a break. However on ITV's digital channels, the amount of Teleshopping affects how much Nightscreen is broadcast and also on ITV during Summer & Christmas and on emergency recovery test more hours are being broadcast as live Jackpot 24/7 is not shown - thus sees the Nightscreeen broadcasting until 5:05am ‚Äì 6:00am non stop. Very occasionally it is not broadcast due to live events and other programming filling its hour. The programme also broadcasts on all of ITV's +1 channels. It was first broadcast on 14 January 1998, and consisted of teletext pages taken from the ITV regional teletext services, with interstitial teletext-based animations in a similar style to the former 4-Tel On View.ITV Nightscreen 23rd May 1998 Since 2003 the screens have been produced using Scala InfoChannel3. In early 2009, updated systems were installed with the latest version of Scala5, with a dual redundant system to counter any issues of service. In April 2012, the system was upgraded again to a newer version of Scala5. This, amongst other minor presentational changes, allowed compatibility of the service to be transmitted in 16:9 widescreen for the first time, as opposed to 4:3. Nightscreen has, in the past, been criticised for highlighting programmes which had already aired, and for some careless typing and spelling errors but now regularly avoids doing this. As well as providing focus on upcoming programmes, films and TV listings, it also offers some news from the world of entertainment. In the past it also offered sports news and even on some occasions cooking tips, recipes and also fact files of characters from famous ITV shows such as Emmerdale and Coronation Street. The Scala system was provided by Beaver Group, and the programme is currently produced by Gower Creative Communications. The Soundtracks are supplied by EMI Production Music. (These can be found in the Positive Tunes (1-6) Albums in the Library of Juice On Demand (JMOD). On STV, most of the soundtracks can be found in various Albums in the Library of Music House (MH).) ==Origins== Teletext screens had been employed by the BBC since 1980 and by Channel 4 since 1983 to fill airtime cheaply. In-vision teletext was only ever occasionally used on the ITV network. From April 1986 certain regions, firstly Central Independent Television, followed in January 1987 by Yorkshire Television, started showing overnight teletext sequences containing details of local job vacancies under the title Jobfinder. Initially the pages were broadcast for an hour after the end of regular programming but from April 1987 Central broadcast Jobfinder throughout their overnight downtime.Ident Central ‚Äì More Central When 24-hour television began in 1988, the majority of ITV regions broadcast a Jobfinder programme in the hour preceding the ITV Morning News. Also, for a short while in 1987, an Oracle-provided service preceding TV-am broadcasts, known as Daybreak, was broadcast before the start of TV-am's programming. ITV Nightscreen's origins can also be found in a programme simply titled Freescreen, which was made and screened by Meridian Broadcasting in its early years. The Meridian version mixed the teletext pages with local news stories and short videos made and sent in by viewers. ==Broadcasts== ITV Nightscreen is broadcast on ITV, STV and UTV starting from when the last programme finishes and ending at 05:05 most weekdays and at 06:00 at weekends and holidays. Its availability on ITV2, ITV3, ITV4, and ITVBe is dependent on how much unused time is left, and can sometimes last for as little as five minutes on 2, 3, 4, and Encore (as teleshopping is shown on ITV2, ITV3 and ITV4 between 03:00 and 06:00. Although not an ITV-branded channel, ITV's defunct Men & Motors channel would in its later years carry the filler from the close of programming until 06:00; between 06:00 and the start of programmes at 11:00, M&M; would broadcast an animated caption card or teleshopping presentations. In its early years, Nightscreen would take up most of the early morning schedule, often starting at 02:00 or 03:00 and finishing before the ITV News at 5:30. In December 2005, three months before the now defunct ITV Play began transmitting, a quiz show entitled Quizmania began broadcasting in the early hours on ITV. Subsequent programmes that followed were The Mint, Make Your Play and Glitterball. This resulted in Nightscreen being pushed back to just a half-hour service between 05:00 and 05:30. In 2008, largely as a result of widespread scandal surrounding phone-ins, ITV Play was permanently axed, since when Nightscreen now regularly runs from around 04:00. ITV Channel Television previously ran its own version of the service entitled Channel Nightscreen consisting of local news headlines and programming information. Channel Nightscreen was axed towards the end of 2011 shortly after ITV plc brought Channel Television. In mid-2010, ITV started airing The Zone for 2 hours, a gaming and shopping programme block, usually airing from 00:30 to 02:30, leaving Nightscreen often cut back to as little as an hour and sometimes removed from ITV's schedule altogether. In April 2010, STV launched its own Scottish night-time service, The Nightshift, broadcast in the STV Central region and consisting of programming highlights, news, competitions and viewers texts & emails read out by a live out-of-vision presenter. STV North continued to broadcast ITV Nightscreen until July 2010, when The Nightshift was extended to the North region. The programme included regional news opt-outs for the four STV sub-regions: Aberdeen & the North, Dundee & Tayside, Edinburgh & the East and Glasgow & the West. STV dropped The Nightshift from its schedules in June 2015, meaning Nightscreen was extended on the station, usually running from around 02:00 until just after 05:00 (06:00 at the weekend). On 1 August 2019, home shopping channel Ideal World began simulcasting during part of the overnight period on ITV, however, it is not able to be viewed on ITV Hub. Consequently, the two bursts of Nightscreen on UTV and Channel have now ceased as these regions now follow network scheduling due to there being no restrictions about them showing Ideal World, unlike the previous gaming programmes. STV still shows the service from not long after 1am till 5 or 6am depending upon schedule requirements. Sometimes Nightscreen is scheduled between blocks of teleshopping on ITV2, 3 and 4. On ITVBe, Nightscreen is shown for the small amount of time after the last programme before 5 or more hours of teleshopping is shown. Former ITV channel ITV Encore used the service to fill left time in nighttime programming. The CITV channel does not use the service as their channel finishes at 9pm. ==Other similar servicesCurrent=== RT√â Aertel A similar filler to ITV Nightscreen was also provided by RT√â, who currently uses this to fill airtime cheaply on RT√â Two. It is very similar in fashion to ITV Nightscreen as it provides rolling teletext pages while RT√â Two is not broadcasting. It has been criticised by many FAI League of Ireland fans who have dubbed the service \\"Errortel\\" due to the constant inaccuracies, delays & incorrect information with live scoring and reporting of games. ===Defunct=== Pages from Ceefax Ceefax was the BBC's teletext information service transmitted via the analogue signal, started in 1974 and continued to run until the UK analogue switch off in October 2012. In-vision Ceefax broadcasts started in 1980, initially as a daytime filler, but as programme hours expanded Ceefax was shown before the start of programming. From 1995 until October 2012 they were seen on BBC Two late at night, most commonly at the weekend but occasionally during the week. The final broadcast was in the early hours of Monday 22 October 2012, two days before Ceefax was switched off when digital switchover was completed. Broadcasts on BBC One had ceased in November 1997 when BBC News was launched as BBC One carries BBC News overnight although occasional Ceefax broadcasts were seen on BBC One Scotland. 4-Tel On View Originally broadcast on weekdays, it alternated with showings of the IBA ETP-1 testcard and Oracle On View.

Its capital is the city of Artigas, which borders on the Brazilian city of Quara√≠. Artigas Department has an area of , making it the fifth largest in the country. The population is 73,378 inhabitants, according to the 2011 census. It is bordered on the north and east by Brazil, from which it is separated by the Cuareim River. To the south, Artigas Department borders on Salto Department, and to the west is Argentina, from which it is separated by the Uruguay River. Artigas is the only Uruguayan department that borders two other countries. The department and its capital city are named after Jos√© Gervasio Artigas (1764‚Äì1850), leader of the Orientales (inhabitants of the Banda Oriental, the Eastern bank of the Uruguay River) during Uruguay's wars of independence. ==History== Owner region of a prehistoric past which later became \\"no man's land\\" between the Spanish and Portuguese empires. The initial indigenous predominance (chan√°s-charr√∫as- Guarani) was displaced by the native settlement and subsequent colonies of immigrants. Artigas department was created by law on 1 October 1884, on territory previously belonged to the department of Salto; from that date it is designated to Villa de San Eugenio as capital, which in 1915 passed to the category of city with the name of Artigas, capital of the department with the same name in tribute to the national hero of Uruguay Jos√© Gervasio Artigas. He was linked to the fact Colonel Carlos Lecueder, first politician and police chief Artigas. Sacred Heart Church Its capital Artigas comes at the end of the \\"Guerra Grande\\" in order to consolidate the borders with Brazil, with the name of San Eugenio del Cuareim. It was founded on September 12, 1852 by Don Carlos Catala, choosing as the best site located on the banks of the Cuareim River opposite the Villa San Juan Bautista on the other side of the river, which was a military settlement that was then transformed into what is today the city of Quara√≠. With the name of Santa Rosa del Cuareim was founded the current Bella Union by Fructuoso Rivera and refugees Guarani after the campaign Eastern Missions against Brazil in 1829. In 1852 after winning the allies Colorados Brazil national, territory north of Cuareim was yielded to Brazil which prompted an evacuation of the population. It was refounded in 1853 under the name of Santa Rosa de la Bella Union Quareim. In 1929 the national government to mark the centenary of the campaign of Missions, sent a bill to the Senate, which established the name Bella Union, which for that time was a villa . ==Geography and climate== Topographic map of Artigas Department showing main populated places and roads Two portions of the department's border with Brazil are disputed (Isla Brasilera or Brazilian Island near Bella Uni√≥n, and an area called Rinc√≥n de Artigas near Masoller), but unlike many border disputes between Latin American countries, this issue has not strained Uruguay's relations with Brazil, which remain friendly. Two main geostructural regions can be found inside Artigas' limits: *The central and eastern area, which includes a basaltic cuesta, and some sedimentary plains near the Cuareim River. Also found in the region are some hill ranges, such as Cuchilla de Bel√©n. *The western area, which consists of a narrow alluvial plain. Artigas Department's average temperature is the highest in the whole country (over 19¬∞C or 66¬∞F, and may go as high as 47¬∞C or 116¬∞F during the summer months). So are its precipitation levels (up to an annual average of 1400 mm). ==Economy== Plantations in Bella Uni√≥n, north of Artigas. The unique climatic conditions of Artigas has made possible the development of an important agro-industrial centre around the city of Bella Uni√≥n. Several crops are planted, namely fruits and vegetables, sugar cane, and rice. In the rest of the department, the main economic activity is livestock raising. Semi- precious gemstones, such as agates and amethysts, are also found in the department, and an entire industry has risen up around their extraction and manufacturing, especially near the capital city of Artigas. The proximity of the department to Brazil has made it possible for an important flow of trade to be established here, but unfortunately this is generally unfavorable to Uruguayan economic interests. Nevertheless, this partially compensates for the fact that the per capita income is the lowest of the country, and the percentage of households in poverty is the highest in the country (13.19% of the inhabitants). ==Population and Demographics== A polished slice of an amethyst stalactite from Artigas Department As of the census of 2011, the Artigas Department had a population of 73,378 (36,079 male and 37,299 female) and 26,231 households.

It shows programming aimed at students in Primary, Secondary and Higher Education and to adult learners. Viewers are encouraged to watch programmes after the original broadcast via the use of, originally VHS, currently DVD. In 2015, the BBC confirmed that due to budget cuts, the service would no longer be running. ==History== The BBC Learning Zone was launched as The Learning Zone on 9 October 1995, as an extension service of BBC2, to free up more of their schedule. Previously, these educational programmes had been based on the channel in mornings and often until the early afternoon on weekdays. However, following the channel's rebranding to the '2' idents and the increased viewer perception that resulted from it, the channel was anxious to use more of their daytime for different programming. The Learning Zone was the solution to this problem. The idea had been around for a while: by 1995 ITV was operating as a 24-hour channel, freeing up their prime time and daytime schedules. The BBC attempted producing specialist television overnight by launching BBC Select. This service played out encrypted programming for professions such as medicine and law overnight between 1992 and 1995. Also, from the start of 1993, some BBC Schools programmes were shown (as subject blocks or a series block) overnight as part of a new experiment called Night School.Airings of Nightschool from 1993-1995 The service would begin after BBC Two's closedown and transfer to Pages from Ceefax, with the service beginning at 12.30am (2am on Monday mornings) until 7.00am (3.00-5.00am Fridays and Saturdays). In 2004 the service started at 2am every day and continuing until approximately 6am when programming on BBC Two would begin, however this was not always the case. The service then ran between 4am and 6am, and usually did not operate when schools were not open (Summer, Easter Holidays etc.). In 1997, when the BBC rebranded, The Learning Zone was renamed BBC Learning Zone, became a separate strand of programming in its own right and became independent of BBC Two. In 2015, the BBC confirmed that 'due to budget cuts', the service would be no longer be running on BBC Two. Instead, it was said to be moving online on the BBC Education and BBC Teach websites. The final BBC Learning Zone aired in the early hours of 24 July 2015. ==Programming== The service, upon launch, was used for the transfer of programming, including the bulk of Open University programming, secondary school programming previously from the BBC Schools strand as well as other programming. Programming was divided up into segments, as seen below: *Open University and General Interest - Programming from the open university for Degree students and other programmes that may be of interest to the public. This later category came about by the Open University's use of education programming in the style of prime time documentaries, pioneered by Coast. Also included in the category was the programme WorkSkills, that helped with applying for jobs, however this programme ceased after some time. This segment ceased when the Open University stopped programming. *Languages and Travel - Programming focusing of teaching new languages and the differing cultures. Programming in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Portuguese, Greek and Japanese. This service ceased in Summer 2012. *Schools - Programming from BBC Schools for students at GCSE and A-Level and for those in Secondary and Primary education. Includes repeats of old schools programmes. These segments ran on alternate days and for only certain times of the year. The segments and programming may be changed during exam seasons, so programming is revision orientated, with the programme Bitesize being a staple of the schedule. On 15 December 2006, the last Open University programme was broadcast on the service, following which the strand was removed from the service. Schools programmes ended when BBC Learning Zone finished in 2015. Languages programmes (shown during the summer months) were dropped after Summer 2012. BBC Two instead now show rolling programme previews under the name 'This is BBC Two'. In 2010, the remaining primary schools programmes, previously shown at 11am for one hour during weekdays (except Wednesday), were transferred to the Learning Zone from BBC Two. Unusual among BBC services, few to no programme shown on the BBC Learning Zone is available to be watched again on the BBC iPlayer, due to rights restrictions on the programmes. As compensation, the BBC launched a section called Learning Zone Broadband, or more simply Class Clips which includes segments from Learning Zone as well as clips taken from other relevant BBC programmes. These clips were available to watch on demand over the internet for free. This service provided teachers and students with a range of resources, including case studies and experiments, to use in class or elsewhere. The service is no longer in use. Clips are now available on the BBC Teach website. ==Presentation== Upon launch on 9 October 1995, the strand was introduced with a variation of the '2' idents and had a logo featuring an orange stylised Learning Zone logo. On 6 October 1997, when the strand became separate, the station's current identification was created, showing an oak tree and an acorn. The acorn falls from a tree, while a number of identification processes take place, including a thermal image, a database match on computer, measurements taken, newspaper archives, aerodynamic investigation, cross section, 3D image and the name in different languages before the acorn finally falls to the ground and seeds to become an oak sapling. The ident is accompanied by an updated logo featuring the BBC logo and 'Learning Zone' written after in capital letters. The identification was generally only used at the beginning of the strand. Links between programmes were made using programme menus and continuity voice overs. Programme menus and static information slides were made using the logo at the bottom, and an image related to the identification featuring in the background. Very few programme slides and promotions were used. In 2004, four supplementary idents were introduced to link into the programmes themselves. They still featured the 1997 presentational style and were based around the theme of the seasons, with one used each season. They featured the oak tree in the background and people at rest and play around it. The 1997 ident was still used to open the strand. Also introduced in 2004, were opening films to introduce the programme menu. These featured clips showing on screen of the programmes in the Learning Zone and of the acorn falling, before a version of the logo with back-lighting moving from left to right, accompanied by the music 'Wired' by Atmosphere Music Ltd. The programme menu was also redesigned with falling acorns as the background. Both new devices were colour-coded to the strand: blue for Open University, green for languages and red for schools. Unusually for a terrestrial BBC channel, the strand is accompanied by a BBC Two DOG in the top left corner of the screen. Other DOGs accompany the programmes, while some lengthy educational programmes include a timer in the top right corner to make it easier to scan and find the section the viewer wants. The acorn ident is the longest BBC ident ever used, having beaten the BBC Two '2' idents in 2008. ==Similar strands== *Schools programming had previously been broadcast in a designated BBC Schools strand shown in the morning and early afternoon on BBC1 and from September 1983 on BBC2. These broadcasts have since lost their special strand, and the final programmes moved from BBC Two to the Learning Zone in 2010. *Open University programming became common viewing during daytime and weekend hours for many years since 1971, before having the hours reduced in the 1990s. These programmes have since ceased. *The digital channel BBC Knowledge was launched in 1999 following the launch of the Learning Zone, featuring educational and cultural programming. The channel ceased broadcasting in 2002 to make way for CBeebies (6am-7pm) and BBC Four (7pm-4am). *A programming strand called BBC Learning on the subscription international channel BBC Prime broadcast similar programming. The service was axed in August 2006. ==References *Learning Zone at bbc.co.uk *BBC Teach - The new home of Schools clips at bbc.co.uk Learning Zone, BBC Category:Educational broadcasting in the United Kingdom Category:Television channels and stations established in 1995 Category:1995 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"BBC Learning Zone"},{"id":"2227762","text":"In France, a pays () is an area whose inhabitants share common geographical, economic, cultural, or social interests, who have a right to enter into communal planning contracts under a law known as the Loi Pasqua or LOADT (Loi d'Orientation pour l'Am√©nagement et le D√©veloppement du Territoire; ), which took effect on February 4, 1995. It was augmented on June 25, 1999, by the Loi Voynet or LOADDT (Loi d'Orientation de l'Am√©nagement Durable du Territoire). The LOADDT enables the citizens of a community to form a legally recognized pays after deciding to do so by mutual consent; its aim is to help bring the inhabitants of urban and neighboring rural districts into dialogue and agreement. The Council of Development in each pays assembles together the elected officials and the economic, social, and cultural actors, and their associates, into a deliberative forum to discuss the development policies which should be followed by the community. While the Council can give advice, submit proposals, and monitor development projects, it does not have the authority to make official decisions. The Charter of the Pays makes it possible to fix the stakes and the objectives of the community. Few structures are recognized as pays Voynet, meaning nationwide, because the recognition criteria are sometimes far from what the pays are. Then again, several pays are recognized by the Commission R√©gionale d'am√©nagement et de d√©veloppement du Territoire. ==Sense of the word== In France, the contract of the Pays can be signed among the members of the pays, or between the pays and its surrounding area, the department, the region, or with the national state when the stakes are well-identified. In this context, the French term pays is not used in the modern sense of \\"country\\" but preserves the original meaning of the Latin word from which it was derived, pagus, which designated the territory controlled by a medieval count. The majority of pays are roughly coextensive with the old counties (e.g., county of Comminges, county of Ponthieu, etc). Today Pays de France still refers to a tiny area in northwest Ile-de-France, hence city names such as Roissy-en-France or Tremblay-en- France. Although this word is frequently translated into English as country, its usage can mean a region or territory of a nation (bounded by borders and constituting a geographical entity) considered from the point of view of a certain identity or community of interest of its inhabitants. It is held to be the geographical basis of the state. The word is also used less precisely as an alternative for √©tat (state). ==Pays of Brittany== Brittany, consisting of 4 departments, is also subdivided into 21 pays. * pays de Brest * pays de Cornouaille * pays du Centre-Ouest de Bretagne * pays de Morlaix * Pays de Tr√©gor-Go√©lo * pays de Guingamp * pays de Saint-Brieuc * pays de Centre- Bretagne * pays de Pontivy * pays de Lorient * pays d'Auray * pays de Vannes * pays de Plo√´rmel-Coeur de Bretagne * pays de Broc√©liande * pays de Dinan * pays de Saint-Malo * pays de Foug√®res * pays de Rennes * Pays de Vitr√©-Porte de Bretagne * pays es Vallons de Vilaine * pays de Redon et Vilaine, note this pays straddles 3 departments, including one located outside Brittany, the Loire Atlantique. ==Pays of Franche-Comt√©== La Franche-Comt√©, consisting of 4 departments, is also subdivided into 16 pays : * pays de l'Aire Urbaine (Belfort-Montb√©liard-H√©ricourt-Delle ) * pays du Doubs Central * pays du Haut- Doubs * pays Horloger * pays de Loue Lison * pays de Pierrefontaine Les Varans * pays des Vosges Sa√¥noises * pays Dolois * pays du Haut Revermont * pays de la Haute Vall√©e de l'Ain * pays des Lacs et de Petite Montagne * pays L√©donien * pays du Haut Jura * pays Graylois * pays des Sept Rivi√®res * pays de Vesoul et du Val de Sa√¥ne ==See also== *Pays d'outre mer *Pays-d'en-Haut (disambiguation) *Pays des Illinois ==References== Category:Politics of France Category:Government of France Category:Former subdivisions of France Category:Geographical, historical and cultural regions of France ","title":"Pays (France)"},{"id":"2227766","text":"Rudolf von Delbr√ºck, Portrait by Gottlieb Biermann (1875). Tombstone of von Belbr√ºck, Berlin. Martin Friedrich Rudolf von Delbr√ºck (16 April 1817 ‚Äì 1 February 1903) was a Prussian statesman at the time of Otto von Bismarck. ==Biography== Delbr√ºck was born at Berlin, Province of Brandenburg. He came of a distinguished family, his father, Johann Friedrich Gottlieb Delbr√ºck (d. 1830), having been preceptor of the two Prussian princes afterwards known as King Frederick William IV and Emperor William I. Rudolf von Delbr√ºck studied in Halle, Bonn, and Berlin. On completing his legal studies, he entered the service of the state in 1837; and after holding a series of minor posts was transferred in 1848 to the ministry of commerce, which was to be the sphere of his real life's work. The states of the German Confederation, including Prussia and the Austrian Empire, had realized the influence of commercial upon political union. Delbr√ºck in 1851 induced Hanover, Oldenburg, and Schaumburg- Lippe, who formed the Steuerverein, to join the Zollverein; and the southern states, which had agreed to admit Austria to the union, found themselves forced in 1853 to renew the old union, from which Austria was excluded. Delbr√ºck now began, with the support of Otto von Bismarck, to apply the principles of free trade to Prussian fiscal policy. In 1862 Delbr√ºck concluded an important commercial treaty with France. In 1867 he became the first president of the chancery of the North German Confederation, and represented Bismarck on the federal tariff council (Zollbundesrath), a position of political as well as fiscal importance owing to the presence in the council of representatives of the southern states. In. 1868 he became a Prussian minister without portfolio. In October 1870, when the union of Germany under Prussian headship became a practical question, Delbr√ºck was chosen to go on a mission to the South German states, and contributed greatly to the agreements concluded at Versailles in November. In 1871 Delbr√ºck became president of the newly constituted Reichskanzleramt. Delbr√ºck, however, began to feel himself uneasy under Bismarck's leanings towards protection and state control. On the introduction of Bismarck's plan for the acquisition of the railways by the state, Delbr√ºck resigned office, nominally on the ground of ill-health (June 1, 1876). In 1879 he opposed in the Reichstag the new protectionist tariff, and on the failure of his efforts retired definitely from public life in 1881. In 1896 he received from William II the Order of the Black Eagle. He died at Berlin. ==NotesReferences== * Category:1817 births Category:1903 deaths Category:Politicians from Berlin Category:People from the Province of Brandenburg Category:Members of the 4th Reichstag of the German Empire Category:Members of the Prussian House of Representatives Category:Recipients of the Order of the Black Eagle ","title":"Rudolf von Delbr√ºck"},{"id":"2227768","text":"Elizabethtown, California was a California Gold Rush town that began in 1852 in Plumas County, California. It was named after a woman in the miners camp called Elizabeth Stark Blakesley.Elizabethtown Pioneer Trails 1927 Monument Speech - 79.29 (29th submission submitted to county museum in 1979) - Plumas County Museum It is said that the value of gold taken from the Elizabethtown area ran into the millions of dollars. It was started from other gold mining camps all around American Valley (where Quincy, CA is now located). In 1852, a 10 to 15 family wagon train came up Beckwourth Pass (which was created by James Beckwourth, the first pioneer to this area). They brought a large supply of horses, oxen, cows, and other needed supplies and were the first settlers of American Valley. When they got there, they found a population of hundreds of Maidu Indians, which were peaceful and friendly. In 1852 Alexander and Frank Tate discovered gold in what is known as Tate ravine. After that, Lewis Stark, Peter Day, and George Ferrier one morning went up Elizabeth ravine and by noon they panned out an ounce of gold. After dinner they found several ounces using a rocker. After digging a small ditch, they discovered one 28 ounce gold piece. After that many miners came to search for gold which developed into a village. Later on Elizabethtown was also known as Betysburg after a rivalry started with Quincy. The winter of 1852 and 1853 were very harsh with low provisions. So the spring of 1853 the Stark family went to Sacramento Valley and hauled up many cattle for beef for the starving families.Pages 276 and 277 of \\"Reproduction of Fariss and Smith's History of Plumas, Lassen & Sierra Counties, California, 1882; and biographical sketches of their prominent men and pioneers.

The State Bank collapsed due to the weight of the grossly irresponsible lending made in the 1980s, in particular by its merchant bank subsidiary Tricontinental, after the Reserve Bank of Australia decision to increase interest rates in 1989 brought about the deep recession that put pressure on those financial institutions that were heavily exposed to the property market.D.T. Merrett (1992), Another contributor to the State Bank‚Äôs decline was its acquisition of the already troubled Australian Bank in January 1989. Tricontinental eventually collapsed with losses of A$1.5 billion, which threatened the existence of the State Bank and led to its sale to the Commonwealth Bank.Hugo Armstrong (1992), 'The Tricontinental Affair,' in Mark Considine and Brian Costar (eds.), Trials in Power. Cain, Kirner and Victoria 1982-1992, Melbourne University Press, Carlton, Ch.3 The overall sale price was A$2.0 billion. The collapse of the State Bank was a key factor in the defeat of the State Labor government led by Joan Kirner and the election of the Liberal Party led by Jeff Kennett, at the 1992 Victorian state election. ==References *State Bank (Succession of Commonwealth Bank) Act 1990 *Public Record Office of Victoria *State Bank of Victoria House Plans and Designs *State Bank Victoria Category:Banks established in 1842 Category:Banks disestablished in 1990 Category:Defunct banks of Australia Category:Economic history of Victoria (Australia) Category:1842 establishments in Australia State Bank of Victoria collapse Category:Australian companies established in 1842 Category:Australian companies disestablished in 1990 ","title":"State Bank of Victoria"},{"id":"2227772","text":"Canelones () is the capital of the department of Canelones in Uruguay.

Its capital is Canelones. ==Geography and climate== Neighbouring departments are Maldonado and Lavalleja to the East, Florida to the North, San Jos√© to the West, and Montevideo to the South. Part of the southern border is formed by the R√≠o de la Plata. It is the second smallest department of the country after that of Montevideo, but the second largest in population. Located in the humid templated region, the average temperature is low compared to that of the rest of the country (around 15¬∞C), as are the levels of precipitation (up to 2,000 mm yearly, on average). By area Canelones Department is the second smallest of Uruguay's 19 departments. === Topography and hydrography === San Ram√≥n. Canelones Department, is characterized by flat lands and absence of relief (as most parts of Uruguay), with small coastal sand dunes at the south, and with meadows and woods in the center, north and west. The department is rich in waterways, with many rivers and streams. However, there are two rivers that stand out for their importance: the Santa Luc√≠a River and the R√≠o de la Plata, which is actually a sea of salt water. On the coastline formed by the R√≠o de la Plata, there are many spa towns and their respective beaches. Santa Lucia River, meanwhile, forms the northern boundary with Florida, which is separated by a bridge known as the Paso Pache. === Regions === Despite being a small department, Canelones has a population of over 500,000 inhabitants and one of the highest densities in the country with 114 inhabitants per square kilometer. The department is divided into approx. 20 sections. Within these, there are significant populations centers, some of which have the status of municipality, others are part of recently formed cities by decree, and then there are also those that do not have enough inhabitants and are therefore often considered simple population entities with no mayor or government, remaining under the direct jurisdiction of the Municipality of Canelones (in Spanish, Intendencia Municipal Canelones or Comuna Canaria), which is based in the departmental capital, Canelones. ==History== Canelones was one of the nine original departments created in 1830. Over the years its boundaries have changed little. ==Economy== Agriculture is one of the principal contributors to the economy of Canelones. The cultivation of grapevines is widespread, and the area is a major contributor to Uruguay's burgeoning wine industry. In addition cereal crops, principally maize are produced, as are a wide variety of fruits and vegetables. Tourism, in the eastern coastal area, is also a major source of income for the department, and has enabled the development of important urban centres, such as Atl√°ntida. ==Population and Demographics== At the 2011 census, Canelones Department had a population of 520,187 (253,124 male and 267,063 female) and 222,193 (+44.25% than in 2004 (153,931)) households. The average household size was 2.3 persons. Demographic data for Canelones Department in 2010: *Population growth rate: 1,095% *Birth Rate: 14.83 births/1,000 people *Death Rate: 8.45 deaths/1,000 people *Average age: 32.9 (31.4 Males, 34.3 Females) *Life Expectancy at Birth **Total population: 76.37 years **Male: 72.95 years **Female: 80.00 years *Average per household income: 25,087 pesos/month *Urban per capita income: 10,015 pesos/month 2010 Data Source: { style=\\"margin-top:16px;\\" - ! colspan=2 align=\\"left\\" style=\\"padding-left:20px;\\"  Main Urban Centres ! align=\\"left\\" style=\\"padding- left:20px;\\"  Other towns and villages -  colspan=3  Population stated according to the 2011 census. - valign=\\"top\\"  {  !

The book covers the mathematical theory of mirrors, particularly the images formed by plane and spherical concave mirrors. *Hero's Catoptrics. Written by Hero of Alexandria, this work concerns the practical application of mirrors for visual effects. In the Middle Ages, this work was falsely ascribed to Ptolemy. It only survives in a Latin translation.A. Mark Smith, (1999), Ptolemy and the Foundations of Ancient Mathematical Optics, pages 16-17. American Philosophical Society.

He made the observation that the ratio between the angle of incidence and refraction does not remain constant, and investigated the magnifying power of a lens. His work on catoptrics also contains the problem known as \\"Alhazen's problem\\". Alhazen's work influenced Averroes' writings on optics, and his legacy was further advanced through the 'reforming' of his Optics by Persian scientist Kamal al-Din al-Farisi (d. ca. 1320) in the latter's Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir (The Revision of [Ibn al-Haytham's] Optics). ==Catoptric telescopes== The first practical catoptric telescope (the \\"Newtonian reflector\\") was built by Isaac Newton as a solution to the problem of chromatic aberration exhibited in telescopes using lenses as objectives (dioptric telescopes). ==See also== * Dioptrics * Catadioptrics * Optical telescope * List of telescope types * Image-forming optical system * Fresnel lens * Lighthouse lens ==References== * Category:Optical telescopes ","title":"Catoptrics"},{"id":"2227789","text":"Melo () is the capital city of the Cerro Largo Department of north-eastern Uruguay.

Given its proximity to some Portuguese colonies in Brazil, the \\"Melo Village\\" (in Spanish, \\"Villa de Melo\\"), as it was once named, was invaded by Portuguese forces in 1801, 1811, and 1816. With Uruguayan independence, Melo was officially declared capital of the department of Cerro Largo. In 1845, the city square was renamed in honor of Manuel Oribe, a former President of Uruguay and a political leader of the White Party (Partido Blanco), which brought to light the relations of this corner of the country with that National Movement (the vast majority of its inhabitants have belonged to that same political community).

In 1795, the Captain of the Spanish Infantry Agust√≠n de la Rosa founded the town of Melo, a fortress to repel attacks of the Portuguese and the Indios. The territory was invaded by the Portuguese in 1801, 1811, and 1816. The history of this place is marked by battles before, during and after the Independence of the Republic. The old Posta del Chuy, from the town, was the historic Inn where travellers from Melo to Villa Artigas (the actual R√≠o Branco) could rest and pay the fares for using the first public work of the Republic, the stone bridge over the stream Chuy del Tacuar√≠, today a Heritage Monument, built in 1855 by the French Basque brothers Etcheverry. In 1830, when Uruguay was divided in nine departments, Cerro Largo was one of them, including the biggest part of what was later separated as the Treinta y Tres Department. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, when intermittent periods of civil war occurred in Uruguay, the department was a stronghold of the Blanco party. This was the precursor of the Partido Nacional.

At that time, Paysand√∫ Department included all the territory north of the R√≠o Negro, which included the actual departments of Artigas, Rivera, Tacuaremb√≥, Salto, Paysand√∫, and R√≠o Negro. On 17 June 1837, a new division of Uruguay was made and this territory was divided into three parts. In the new division, Paysand√∫ Department included also the actual department of R√≠o Negro, until it was split from it in 1868. ==Population and demographics== As of the census of 2011, Paysand√∫ Department had a population of 113,124 (55,361 male and 57,759 female) and 42,849 households.

Livestock raising is one of the principal agricultural activities, with cattle being raised for both the dairy and beef industries alongside sheep for wool production. Market-gardening is also prominent with the cultivation of oranges and blueberries, whilst wheat, barley, sunflowers and soya beans are also produced. There is also a small fishing industry on the Uruguay River. Tourism too, is important for the area. Ecotourism is gaining prominence especially in the Esteros de Farrapos National Park further down the river. In addition many farms provide accommodation and facilities for tourists visiting the area. Paysand√∫ is home to a large brewery and hosts an annual Semana de la Cerveza (Week of the Beer), a weeklong festival of music, arts, carnival type rides, and beer. ==Map of the department== Topographic map of Paysand√∫ Department showing main populated places and roads ==See also== * List of populated places in Uruguay#Paysand√∫ Department ==References * INE map of Paysand√∫ Department * Nuestra Terra, Colecci√≥n Los Departamentos, Vol.11 \\"Paysand√∫\\" Category:Departments of Uruguay Category:States and territories established in 1820 ","title":"Paysand√∫ Department"},{"id":"2227826","text":"Salto () is the capital city of the Salto Department in northwestern Uruguay. As of the 2011 census it had a population of 104,028 and is the second most populated city in Uruguay. ==Location and geography== The city is located on Route 3 about northwest of Montevideo, and on the east bank of the R√≠o Uruguay across from the city of Concordia in Argentina. About north of the city the Salto Grande Bridge, built on top of the Salto Grande Dam, joins the two sides. Built on hills and bluffs, the city is situated near the Rio Uruguay's 'big jump' falls, which is also the location of the Salto Grande Dam. The land is low lying alongside the river bank, with an elevation of above sea level. ==History== During the Guarani War the governor of Rio de la Plata, Jos√© de Andonaegui, and the Marquis of Valdelirios pleaded with Governor Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Viana to move north with an army of 400 men and enforce the terms of the Treaty of Madrid. In October 1756 Viana built several barracks for his army located in the area who had to survive on hunting and fishing. The sheds he built were called San Antonio del Salto Chico. Thus, the short-lived first settlement in the present city of Salto dates from 8 November 1756, which remains as its date of foundation. Some people say it was \\"by chance\\", such as the writer Francisco Bauza in his book Dominaci√≥n espa√±ola en Uruguay. In 1757, Viana and the superior Governor of Buenos Aires, Pedro de Cevallos, built a strong fort called San Antonio. The fort had a chapel, which was under the patronage of San Antonio de Padua. Also in that period, Spanish troops captured the Portuguese colony at Colonia del Sacramento and used its facilities for seven years before abandoning it in 1763. On 16 June 1768, the buildings in Salto were occupied by Francisco de Paula Bucareli with 1,500 soldiers seeking to expel the Jesuits from all Spanish territory, as ordered by Carlos III. The fort of San Antonio served as an arms depot and later as a prison for most of the priests, who were later taken to Buenos Aires or deported overseas. While the Jesuits were imprisoned Lieutenant Nicol√°s Garc√≠a took care of the fort and three boats. A big flood of the Yapey√∫ River caused considerable damage and the fort was rebuilt at a nearby site, this time on the western side of the Uruguay River in the current Concordia area, in order to act as a river-road junction. In early 1782 the settlement already had permanent residents. On 12 February 1811 Francisco Javier de El√≠o declared war on the Board of Buenos Aires. Montevideo was besieged by Jos√© Rondeau and Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, so El√≠o asked for help from Portugal. Later the Spanish and the Board of Buenos Aires had to sign an agreement, because Buenos Aires was blockaded by sea. In an armistice agreement it decided to lift the siege of Montevideo and the blockade of the Rio de la Plata. However, General Artigas had to withdraw to the north in what became known at the Exodus of the Western People. Among the members of the Exodus of the Western People were a considerable number of important people in Uruguayan history, including some 6,000 military personnel and 4,500 civilians. In December 1811 they camped for one month on the Uruguay River very close to Salto. In that place the Board of Buenos Aires awarded the title of Lieutenant Governor, Chief Justice and Captain of the Department to Artigas who \\"guided the revolutionaries in a ten- year crusade to liberate the people from Imperial Spanish rule.\\" After the Battle of Las Piedras on 18 May 1811, Artigas was named \\"Chief of the Orientales\\". After 1820, Artigas was forced to live in exile in Paraguay but his movement had been very successful and led to the establishment of the First Republic of Uruguay on 25 August 1825. Before the Independence of Uruguay Salto had acquired the category of \\"Pueblo\\" (village) and on 16 May 1835, by Decree, it was recognized as being a \\"Villa\\" (town). Then, on 16 June 1837, Salto was made capital of the department by the Act of Ley N¬∫ 158. In late October 1845 roughly 1,000 of Giuseppe Garibaldi's Italian and Uruguayan troops advanced up the Uruguay River and took Gualeguaych√∫ in Argentina before seizing Salto, remaining there several months as they plotted against Justo Jos√© de Urquiza, Cesar Diaz and Servando Gomez. On 8 February 1846 Garibaldi defeated Gomez's army, killing several hundred at San Antonio Chico Creek outside Salto. Garibaldi lost about a hundred men in the battle. Montevideo accepted him as General on February 16 when news of his victory reached the city. On 8 June 1863 Salto's status was elevated to \\"Ciudad\\" (city) by the Act of Ley N¬∫ 780, which was reaffirmed on 3 March 1869 by the Act of Ley N¬∫ 1.000. Salto Grande Dam During the late 2010s, Salto city saw a spate in criminal activity similar to those of other border cities across Latin America like Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, with drug trafficking and femicides among the principal crimes committed. According to Nicolas SantAnna, the president of the local commerce and industry syndicate, Salto's Don Atilio has become Uruguay's most dangerous barrio. ==Population== In 2011, Salto had a population of 104,028. {  style=\\"line-height:1.1em;\\" !

Calle Uruguay, Downtown Salto At the entrance of the city there is a memorial to the engineer Eladio Dieste. The memorial is formally called \\"La Puerta de la Sabidur√≠a\\" (\\"The Door of Wisdom\\") and commonly known as \\"La Gaviota\\" (\\"The Seagull\\"). It was constructed by moving a structure built for station facilities and service by Leggiero Barbieri, a now-defunct trading firm. It is located at the intersection of Route 3 and Route 31 with Avenida Pascual Harriague, named after Pascual Harriague, who introduced grape cultivation in Uruguay. Salto is the site of a large number of works by Eladio Dieste, including an industrial warehouse/factory (Refrescos del Norte, 1978), an inn (north coast), a Municipal Bus Terminal, and a private bus company terminal (Turlit, 1980). Other prominent architects include J.P. Sanguinetti with his masterpiece \\"El Campo y yo\\". The center of the city lies on Calle Uruguay, the heart of the business district, and many of the historic buildings in the immediate vicinity are significant. An apartment building called \\"El Mirador\\", the highest building in the city, opened in 2007. A museum of note is the Museo del Hombre y la Tecnolog√≠a. There is a Plaza named after General Artigas in the central part of the city, containing a large statue of him. The largest park in the city is called the Parque Solari. ==Places of worship== * Cathedral Basilica of St. John the Baptist (Roman Catholic) * Holy Cross Parish Church (Roman Catholic) * Sacred Heart of Jesus Parish Church (Roman Catholic) * Parish Church of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel (Roman Catholic) ==Culture== Popular activities among young people include drinking mate (an herbal beverage), going dancing at night and crossing into Argentina to go shopping in Concordia on weekends. One of the attractions are the thermal pools located close to the city. They are kept at over 38 ¬∞C (100 F) around the year. Salto is also known for its street Calle Uruguay, where locals stroll during weekend nights to socialize and drink mate with friends. Despite its many slum areas, Salto is considered one of the higher class areas of Uruguay for its various amenities that most of the country is lacking. The International Cultural Centre was founded in Salto in August 1990. The main football club is Salto F√∫tbol Club which plays in the Uruguayan Segunda Divisi√≥n. Their home ground is located at the Estadio Ernesto Dickinson, which has a capacity of about 6,500. ===Sports=== Salto was one of the host cities of the official 1967 Basketball World Cup. ==Transportation== Salto lies at the junction of the north-south National Route 3 and east-west National Route 31 on the eastern bank at the beginning of the Lower Uruguay River, opposite the Argentine city of Concordia. The city is located by road south of Bella Union and by road north of Paysandu. It is located by road west of Tacuarembo. Salto is connected to Montevideo by regular bus services and by the railroad track Montevideo ‚Äì Salto ‚Äì Artigas. The main railway station is the Salto railway station (Estacion Salto). Nueva Hesperides International Airport had scheduled connections with Montevideo until 2015, enabling easy access to the local thermal baths. There are plans to improve it and local business people are keen to see it expand, allowing freight (particularly fruit) to be shipped directly from the region.

Flight planning is the process of producing a flight plan to describe a proposed aircraft flight. It involves two safety-critical aspects: fuel calculation, to ensure that the aircraft can safely reach the destination, and compliance with air traffic control requirements, to minimise the risk of midair collision. In addition, flight planners normally wish to minimise flight cost through the appropriate choice of route, height, and speed, and by loading the minimum necessary fuel on board. Air Traffic Services (ATS) use the completed flight plan for separation of aircraft in air traffic management services, including tracking and finding lost aircraft, during search and rescue (SAR) missions. Flight planning requires accurate weather forecasts so that fuel consumption calculations can account for the fuel consumption effects of head or tail winds and air temperature. Safety regulations require aircraft to carry fuel beyond the minimum needed to fly from origin to destination, allowing for unforeseen circumstances or for diversion to another airport if the planned destination becomes unavailable. Furthermore, under the supervision of air traffic control, aircraft flying in controlled airspace must follow predetermined routes known as airways (at least where they have been defined), even if such routes are not as economical as a more direct flight. Within these airways, aircraft must maintain flight levels, specified altitudes usually separated vertically by , depending on the route being flown and the direction of travel. When aircraft with only two engines are flying long distances across oceans, deserts, or other areas with no airports, they have to satisfy additional ETOPS safety rules to ensure they can reach some emergency airport if one engine fails. Producing an accurate optimised flight plan requires millions of calculations, so commercial flight planning systems make extensive use of computers (an approximate unoptimised flight plan can be produced using an E6B and a map in an hour or so, but more allowance must be made for unforeseen circumstances). When computer flight planning replaced manual flight planning for eastbound flights across the North Atlantic, the average fuel consumption was reduced by about per flight, and the average flight times were reduced by about 5 minutes per flight.Simpson, L., D. L. Bashioum, and E. E. Carr. 1965. ‚ÄúComputer Flight Planning in the North Atlantic.‚Äù Journal of Aircraft, Vol 2, No. 4, pp. 337-346. Some commercial airlines have their own internal flight planning system, while others employ the services of external planners. A licensed flight dispatcher or flight operations officer is required by law to carry out flight planning and flight watch tasks in many commercial operating environments (e.g., US FAR ¬ß121, Canadian regulations). These regulations vary by country but more and more countries require their airline operators to employ such personnel. ==Overview and basic terminology== A flight planning system may need to produce more than one flight plan for a single flight: *summary plan for air traffic control (in FAA and/or ICAO format) *summary plan for direct download into an onboard flight management system *detailed plan for use by pilots The basic purpose of a flight planning system is to calculate how much trip fuel is needed in the air navigation process by an aircraft when flying from an origin airport to a destination airport. Aircraft must also carry some reserve fuel to allow for unforeseen circumstances, such as an inaccurate weather forecast, or air traffic control requiring an aircraft to fly at a lower-than-optimal altitude due to congestion, or the addition of last-minute passengers whose weight was not accounted for when the flight plan was prepared. The way in which reserve fuel is determined varies greatly, depending on airline and locality. The most common methods are: *US domestic operations conducted under Instrument Flight Rules: enough fuel to fly to the first point of intended landing, then fly to an alternate airport (if weather conditions require an alternate airport), then for 45 minutes thereafter at normal cruising speed *percentage of time: typically 10% (i.e., a 10-hour flight needs enough reserve to fly for another hour) *percentage of fuel: typically 5% (i.e., a flight requiring 20,000 kg of fuel needs a reserve of 1,000 kg) Except for some US domestic flights, a flight plan normally has an alternate airport as well as a destination airport. The alternate airport is for use in case the destination airport becomes unusable while the flight is in progress (due to weather conditions, a strike, a crash, terrorist activity, etc.). This means that when the aircraft gets near the destination airport, it must still have enough alternate fuel and alternate reserve available to fly on to the alternate airport. Since the aircraft is not expected at the alternate airport, it must also have enough holding fuel to circle for a while (typically 30 minutes) near the alternate airport while a landing slot is found. United States domestic flights are not required to have sufficient fuel to proceed to an alternate airport when the weather at the destination is forecast to be better than ceilings and 3 statute miles of visibility; however, the 45-minute reserve at normal cruising speed still applies. It is often considered a good idea to have the alternate some distance away from the destination (e.g., ) so that bad weather is unlikely to close both the destination and the alternate; distances of up to are not unknown. In some cases the destination airport may be so remote (e.g., a Pacific island) that there is no feasible alternate airport; in such a situation an airline may instead include enough fuel to circle for 2 hours near the destination, in the hope that the airport will become available again within that time. There is often more than one possible route between two airports. Subject to safety requirements, commercial airlines generally wish to minimise costs by appropriate choice of route, speed, and height. Various names are given to weights associated with an aircraft and/or the total weight of the aircraft at various stages. *Payload is the total weight of the passengers, their luggage, and any cargo. A commercial airline makes its money by charging to carry payload. *Operating weight empty is the basic weight of the aircraft when ready for operation, including crew but excluding any payload or usable fuel. *Zero fuel weight is the sum of operating weight empty and payload‚Äîthat is, the laden weight of an aircraft, excluding any usable fuel. *Ramp weight is the weight of an aircraft at the terminal building when ready for departure. This includes the zero fuel weight and all required fuel. *Brake release weight is the weight of an aircraft at the start of a runway, just prior to brake release for takeoff. This is the ramp weight minus any fuel used for taxiing. Major airports may have runways that are about 2 miles (3 km) long, so merely taxiing from the terminal to the end of the runway might consume up to a ton of fuel. After taxiing, the pilot lines up the aircraft with the runway and puts the brakes on. On receiving takeoff clearance, the pilot throttles up the engines and releases the brakes to start accelerating along the runway in preparation for taking off. *Takeoff weight is the weight of an aircraft as it takes off partway along a runway. Few flight planning systems calculate the actual takeoff weight; instead, the fuel used for taking off is counted as part of the fuel used for climbing up to the normal cruise height. *Landing weight is the weight of an aircraft as it lands at the destination. This is the brake release weight minus the trip fuel burned. It includes the zero fuel weight, unusable fuel, and all alternate, holding, and reserve fuel. When twin-engine aircraft are flying across oceans, deserts, and the like, the route must be carefully planned so that the aircraft can always reach an airport, even if one engine fails. The applicable rules are known as ETOPS (ExTended range OPerationS). The general reliability of the particular type of aircraft and its engines and the maintenance quality of the airline are taken into account when specifying how long such an aircraft may fly with only one engine operating (typically 1‚Äì3 hours). Flight planning systems must be able to cope with aircraft flying below sea level, which will often result in a negative altitude. For example, Amsterdam Schiphol Airport has an elevation of ‚àí3 metres. The surface of the Dead Sea is 417 metres below sea level, so low-level flights in this vicinity can be well below sea level.Official details regarding Dead Sea ==Units of measurement== Flight plans mix metric and non-metric units of measurement. The particular units used may vary by aircraft, airline, and location across a flight. Since 1979, Council action in pursuance of Assembly Resolution A22-18 adopted 23 March 1979: [..]to cover all aspects of air and ground operations; provision of standardized system of units based on the SI; identification of non-SI units permitted for use in international civil aviation; provision for termination of the use of certain non-SI units. the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has recommended a unification of units of measurement within aviation based on the International System of Units (SI).International Civil Aviation Organization - Assembly Resolutions in Force (as of 8 October 2010) - Doc 9958 - Published by authority of the Secretary General Since 2010, ICAO recommends using:International Civil Aviation Organization - International Standards and Recommended Practices - Annex 5 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation - Units of Measurement to be Used in Air and Ground Operations Fifth Edition - July 2010 * Kilometers per hour (km/h) for speed during travel. * Meters per second (m/s) for wind speed during landing. * Kilometers (km) for distance. * Meters (m) for elevation. However, a termination date for completion of metrication has not been established.Aviation's Crazy, Mixed Up Units of Measure - AeroSavvy While SI units technically are preferred, various non-SI units are still in widespread use within commercial aviation: * Knots (kn) for speed. * Nautical mile (nm) for distance. * Foot (ft) for elevation. === Distance units === Distances are nearly always measured in nautical miles, as calculated at a height of , compensated for the fact that the earth is an oblate spheroid rather than a perfect sphere. Aviation charts always show distances as rounded to the nearest nautical mile, and these are the distances that are shown on a flight plan. Flight planning systems may need to use the unrounded values in their internal calculations for improved accuracy. === Fuel units === Fuel measurement will vary on the gauges fitted to a particular aircraft. The most common unit of fuel measurement is kilograms; other possible measures include pounds, UK gallons, US gallons, and litres. When fuel is measured by weight, the specific gravity of the fuel used is taken into account when checking tank capacity. There has been at least one occasion on which an aircraft ran out of fuel due to an error in converting between kilograms and pounds. In this particular case the flight crew managed to glide to a nearby runway and land safely (the runway was one of two at a former airport then being used as a dragstrip). Many airlines request that fuel quantities be rounded to a multiple of 10 or 100 units. This can cause some interesting rounding problems, especially when subtotals are involved. Safety issues must also be considered when deciding whether to round up or down. === Height units === The altitude of an aircraft is based on the use of a pressure altimeter (see flight level for more detail). The heights quoted here are thus the nominal heights under standard conditions of temperature and pressure rather than the actual heights. All aircraft operating on flight levels calibrate altimeters to the same standard setting regardless of the actual sea level pressure, so little risk of collision arises. In most areas, height is reported as a multiple of , i.e. A025 is nominally . When cruising at higher altitudes aircraft adopt flight levels (FLs). Flight levels are altitudes corrected and calibrated against the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA). These are expressed as a three-figure group e.g., FL320 is ISA. In most areas, the vertical separation between aircraft is either . In Russia, China and some neighbouring areas, altitudes are measured in metres. The vertical separation between aircraft is either 300 metres or 600 metres (about 1.6% less than 1,000 or 2,000 feet). Until 1999, the vertical separation between aircraft flying at high altitudes on the same airway was . Since then there has been a phased introduction around the world of reduced vertical separation minimum (RVSM). This cuts the vertical separation to between flight levels 290 and 410 (the exact limits vary slightly from place to place). Since most jet aircraft operate between these heights, this measure effectively doubles the available airway capacity. To use RVSM, aircraft must have certified altimeters, and autopilots must meet more accurate standards. === Speed units === Aircraft cruising at lower altitudes normally use knots as the primary speed unit, while aircraft that are higher (above Mach Crossover Altitude) normally use Mach number as the primary speed unit, though flight plans often include the equivalent speed in knots as well (the conversion includes allowance for temperature and height). In a flight plan, a Mach number of \\"Point 82\\" means that the aircraft is travelling at 0.820 (82%) of the speed of sound. The widespread use of global positioning systems (GPS) allows cockpit navigation systems to provide air speed and ground speed more or less directly. Another method of obtaining speed and position is the inertial navigation system (INS), which keeps track of a vehicle's acceleration using gyroscopes and linear accelerometers; this information can then be integrated in time to obtain speed and position, as long as the INS was properly calibrated before departure. INS has been present in civil aviation for a few decades and is mostly used in medium to large aircraft as the system is fairly complex. If neither GPS or INS is used, the following steps are required to obtain speed information: * An airspeed indicator is used to measure indicated airspeed (IAS) in knots. * IAS is converted to calibrated airspeed (CAS) using an aircraft-specific correction table. * CAS is converted to equivalent airspeed (EAS) by allowing for compressibility effects. * EAS is converted to true airspeed (TAS) by allowing for density altitude (i.e., height and temperature). * TAS is converted to ground speed by allowing for any head or tail wind. === Mass units === The weight of an aircraft is most commonly measured in kilograms, but may sometimes be measured in pounds, especially if the fuel gauges are calibrated in pounds or gallons. Many airlines request that weights be rounded to a multiple of 10 or 100 units. Great care is needed when rounding to ensure that physical constraints are not exceeded. When chatting informally about a flight plan, approximate weights of fuel and/or aircraft may be referred to in tons. This \\"ton\\" is generally either a metric tonne or a UK long ton, which differ by less than 2%, or a short ton, which is about 10% less. ==Describing a route== A route is a description of the path followed by an aircraft when flying between airports. Most commercial flights will travel from one airport to another, but private aircraft, commercial sightseeing tours, and military aircraft may do a circular or out-and-back trip and land at the same airport from which they took off. ===Components=== Aircraft fly on airways under the direction of air traffic control. An airway has no physical existence, but can be thought of as a motorway in the sky. On an ordinary motorway, cars use different lanes to avoid collisions, while on an airway, aircraft fly at different flight levels to avoid collisions. One can often see planes passing directly above or below one's own. Charts showing airways are published and are usually updated every 4 weeks, coinciding with the AIRAC cycle. AIRAC (Aeronautical Information Regulation and Control) occurs every fourth Thursday, when every country publishes its changes, which are usually to airways. Each airway starts and finishes at a waypoint, and may contain some intermediate waypoints as well. Waypoints use five letters (e.g., PILOX), and those that double as non-directional beacons use three or two (TNN, WK). Airways may cross or join at a waypoint, so an aircraft can change from one airway to another at such points. A complete route between airports often uses several airways. Where there is no suitable airway between two waypoints, and using airways would result in a somewhat roundabout route, air traffic control may allow a direct waypoint-to-waypoint routing, which does not use an airway (often abbreviated in flight plans as \\"DCT\\"). Most waypoints are classified as compulsory reporting points; that is, the pilot (or the onboard flight management system) reports the aircraft's position to air traffic control as the aircraft passes a waypoint. There are two main types of waypoints: *A named waypoint appears on aviation charts with a known latitude and longitude. Such waypoints over land often have an associated radio beacon so that pilots can more easily check where they are. Useful named waypoints are always on one or more airways. *A geographic waypoint is a temporary position used in a flight plan, usually in an area where there are no named waypoints (e.g., most oceans in the Southern Hemisphere). Air traffic control require that geographic waypoints have latitudes and longitudes that are a whole number of degrees. Note that airways do not connect directly to airports. *After takeoff, an aircraft follows a departure procedure (standard instrument departure, or SID), which defines a pathway from an airport runway to a waypoint on an airway, so that the aircraft can join the airway system in a controlled manner. Most of the climb portion of a flight will take place on the SID. *Before landing, an aircraft follows an arrival procedure (standard terminal arrival route, or STAR), which defines a pathway from a waypoint on an airway to an airport runway, so that the aircraft can leave the airway system in a controlled manner. Much of the descent portion of a flight will take place on a STAR. Airline routes between Los Angeles and Tokyo approximately follow a direct great circle route (top), but use the jet stream (bottom) when heading eastwards Special routes known as ocean tracks are used across some oceans, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, to increase traffic capacity on busy routes. Unlike ordinary airways, which change infrequently, ocean tracks change twice a day, so as to take advantage of favourable winds. Flights going with the jet stream may be an hour shorter than those going against it. Ocean tracks may start and finish about 100 miles offshore at named waypoints, to which a number of airways connect. Tracks across northern oceans are suitable for east‚Äìwest or west‚Äìeast flights, which constitute the bulk of the traffic in these areas. ===Complete routes=== There are a number of ways of constructing a route. All scenarios using airways use SIDs and STARs for departure and arrival. Any mention of airways might include a very small number of \\"direct\\" segments to allow for situations when there are no convenient airway junctions. In some cases, political considerations may influence the choice of route (e.g., aircraft from one country cannot overfly some other country). *Airway(s) from origin to destination. Most flights over land fall into this category. *Airway(s) from origin to an ocean edge, then an ocean track, then airway(s) from ocean edge to destination. Most flights over northern oceans fall into this category. *Airway(s) from origin to an ocean edge, then a free-flight area across an ocean, then airway(s) from ocean edge to destination. Most flights over southern oceans fall into this category. *Free-flight area from origin to destination. This is a relatively uncommon situation for commercial flights. Even in a free-flight area, air traffic control still requires a position report about once an hour. Flight planning systems organise this by inserting geographic waypoints at suitable intervals. For a jet aircraft, these intervals are 10 degrees of longitude for eastbound or westbound flights and 5 degrees of latitude for northbound or southbound flights. In free-flight areas, commercial aircraft normally follow a least- time-track so as to use as little time and fuel as possible. A great circle route would have the shortest ground distance, but is unlikely to have the shortest air distance, due to the effect of head or tail winds. A flight planning system may have to perform significant analysis to determine a good free-flight route. ==Fuel calculation== Calculation of fuel requirements (especially trip fuel and reserve fuel) is the most safety-critical aspect of flight planning. This calculation is somewhat complicated: *Rate of fuel burn depends on ambient temperature, aircraft speed, and aircraft altitude, none of which are entirely predictable. *Rate of fuel burn also depends on airplane weight, which changes as fuel is burned. *Some iteration is generally required due to the need to calculate interdependent values. For instance, reserve fuel is often calculated as a percentage of trip fuel, but trip fuel cannot be calculated until the total weight of the aircraft is known, and this includes the weight of the reserve fuel. ===Considerations=== Fuel calculation must take many factors into account. *Weather forecasts :The air temperature affects the efficiency/fuel consumption of aircraft engines. The wind may provide a head- or tailwind component, which in turn will increase or decrease the fuel consumption by increasing or decreasing the air distance to be flown. :By agreement with the International Civil Aviation Organization, there are two national weather centres - in the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and in the United Kingdom, the Met Office - which provide worldwide weather forecasts for civil aviation in a format known as GRIB weather. These forecasts are generally issued every 6 hours and cover the subsequent 36 hours. Each 6-hour forecast covers the whole world using grid points located at intervals of or less. At each grid point, the wind speed, wind direction, air temperature is supplied at nine different heights between . :Aircraft seldom fly exactly through weather gridpoints or at the exact heights at which weather predictions are available, so some form of horizontal and vertical interpolation is generally needed. For intervals, linear interpolation is satisfactory. The GRIB format superseded the earlier ADF format in 1998‚Äì99. The ADF format used intervals; this interval was large enough to miss some storms completely, so calculations using ADF-predicted weather were often not as accurate as those that can be produced using GRIB- predicted weather. *Routes and flight levels :The particular route to be flown determines the ground distance to cover, while winds on that route determine the air distance to be flown. Each inter-waypoint portion of an airway may have different rules as to which flight levels may be used. Total aircraft weight at any point determines the highest flight level which can be used. Cruising at a higher flight level generally requires less fuel than at a lower flight level, but extra climb fuel may be needed to get up to the higher flight level (it is this extra climb fuel and the different fuel consumption rate that cause discontinuities). *Physical constraints :Almost all the weights mentioned above in \\"Overview and basic terminology\\" may be subject to minimum and/or maximum values. Due to stress on the wheels and undercarriage when landing, the maximum safe landing weight may be considerably less than the maximum safe brake-release weight. In such cases, an aircraft that encounters some emergency and has to land immediately after taking off may have to circle for a while to use up fuel, or else jettison some fuel, or else land immediately and risk having the undercarriage collapse. :Further, the fuel tanks have a maximum capacity. On some occasions, commercial flight planning systems find that an impossible flight plan has been requested. The aircraft cannot possibly reach the intended destination, even with no cargo or passengers, since the fuel tanks are not big enough to hold the amount of fuel needed; it would appear that some airlines are over-optimistic at times, perhaps hoping for a (very) strong tailwind. *Fuel consumption rate :The rate of fuel consumption for aircraft engines depends on the air temperature, height as measured by air pressure, aircraft weight, aircraft speed relative to the air, and any increased consumption as compared with brand-new engines due to engine age and/or poor maintenance (an airline can estimate this degradation by comparing actual with predicted fuel burn). Note that a large aircraft, such as a jumbo jet, may burn up to 80 tons of fuel on a 10-hour flight, so there is a substantial weight change during the flight. ===Calculation=== The weight of fuel forms a significant part of the total weight of an aircraft, so any fuel calculation must take into account the weight of any fuel not yet burned. Instead of trying to predict the fuel load not yet burned, a flight planning system can handle this situation by working backward along the route, starting at the alternate, going back to the destination, and then going back waypoint by waypoint to the origin. A more detailed outline of the calculation follows. Several (possibly many) iterations are usually required, either to calculate interdependent values such as reserve fuel and trip fuel, or to cope with situations where some physical constraint has been exceeded. In the latter case it is usually necessary to reduce the payload (less cargo or fewer passengers). Some flight planning systems use elaborate systems of approximate equations to simultaneously estimate all the changes required; this can greatly reduce the number of iterations needed. :If an aircraft lands at the alternate, in the worst case it can be assumed to have no fuel left (in practice there will be enough reserve fuel left to at least taxi off the runway). Hence a flight planning system can calculate alternate holding fuel on the basis that the final aircraft weight is the zero fuel weight. Since the aircraft is circling while holding, there is no need to take wind into account for this or any other holding calculation. :For the flight from destination to alternate, a flight planning system can calculate alternate trip fuel and alternate reserve fuel on the basis that the aircraft weight on reaching the alternate is zero fuel weight plus alternate holding. :A flight planning system can then calculate any destination holding on the basis that the final aircraft weight is zero fuel weight plus alternate holding plus alternate fuel plus alternate reserve. :For the flight from origin to destination, the weight on arrival at the destination can be taken as zero fuel weight plus alternate holding plus alternate fuel plus alternate reserve plus destination holding. A flight planning system can then work back along the route, calculating the trip fuel and reserve fuel one waypoint at a time, with the fuel required for each inter-waypoint segment forming part of the aircraft weight for the next segment to be calculated. :At each stage and/or at the end of the calculation, a flight planning system must carry out checks to ensure that physical constraints (e.g., maximum tank capacity) have not been exceeded. Problems mean that either the aircraft weight must be reduced in some way or the calculation must be abandoned. An alternative approach to fuel calculation is to calculate alternate and holding fuel as above and obtain some estimate of the total trip fuel requirement, either based on previous experience with that route and aircraft type, or by using some approximate formula; neither method can take much account of weather. Calculation can then proceed forward along the route, waypoint by waypoint. On reaching the destination, the actual trip fuel can be compared with the estimated trip fuel, a better estimate made, and the calculation repeated as required. ==Cost reduction== Commercial airlines generally wish to keep the cost of a flight as low as possible. There are three main factors that contribute to the cost: :*the amount of fuel needed (to complicate matters, fuel may cost different amounts at different airports), :*actual flying time affects depreciation charges, maintenance schedules, and the like, :*overflight charges are levied by each country the aircraft flies over (notionally to cover air traffic control costs). Different airlines have different views as to what constitutes a least-cost flight: :*least cost based only on time :*least cost based only on fuel :*least cost based on a balance between fuel and time :*least cost based on fuel costs and time costs and overflight charges ===Basic improvements=== For any given route, a flight planning system can reduce cost by finding the most economical speed at any given altitude and by finding the best altitude(s) to use based on the predicted weather. Such local optimisation can be done on a waypoint- by-waypoint basis. Commercial airlines do not want an aircraft to change altitude too often (among other things, it may make it more difficult for the cabin crew to serve meals), so they often specify some minimum time between optimisation-related flight level changes. To cope with such requirements, a flight planning system must be capable of non-local altitude optimisation by simultaneously taking a number of waypoints into account, along with the fuel costs for any short climbs that may be required. When there is more than one possible route between the origin and destination airports, the task facing a flight planning system becomes more complicated, since it must now consider many routes in order to find the best available route. Many situations have tens or even hundreds of possible routes, and there are some situations with over 25,000 possible routes (e.g., London to New York with free-flight below the track system). The amount of calculation required to produce an accurate flight plan is so substantial that it is not feasible to examine every possible route in detail. A flight planning system must have some fast way of cutting the number of possibilities down to a manageable number before undertaking a detailed analysis. ===Reserve reduction=== From an accountant's viewpoint, the provision of reserve fuel costs money (the fuel needed to carry the hopefully unused reserve fuel). Techniques known variously as reclear, redispatch, or decision point procedure have been developed, which can greatly reduce the amount of reserve fuel needed while still maintaining all required safety standards. These techniques are based on having some specified intermediate airport to which the flight can divert if necessary; in practice such diversions are rare. The use of such techniques can save several tons of fuel on long flights, or it can increase the payload carried by a similar amount. A reclear flight plan has two destinations. The final destination airport is where the flight is really going to, while the initial destination airport is where the flight will divert to if more fuel is used than expected during the early part of the flight. The waypoint at which the decision is made as to which destination to go to is called the reclear fix or decision point. On reaching this waypoint, the flight crew make a comparison between actual and predicted fuel burn and check how much reserve fuel is available. If there is sufficient reserve fuel, then the flight can continue to the final destination airport; otherwise the aircraft must divert to the initial destination airport. The initial destination is positioned so that less reserve fuel is needed for a flight from the origin to the initial destination than for a flight from the origin to the final destination. Under normal circumstances, little if any of the reserve fuel is actually used, so when the aircraft reaches the reclear fix it still has (almost) all the original reserve fuel on board, which is enough to cover the flight from the reclear fix to the final destination. The idea of reclear flights was first published in Boeing Airliner (1977) by Boeing engineers David Arthur and Gary Rose. The original paper contains a lot of magic numbers relating to the optimum position of the reclear fix and so on. These numbers apply only to the specific type of aircraft considered, for a specific reserve percentage, and take no account of the effect of weather. The fuel savings due to reclear depend on three factors: :*The maximum achievable saving depends on the position of the reclear fix. This position cannot be determined theoretically since there are no exact equations for trip fuel and reserve fuel. Even if it could be determined exactly, there may not be a waypoint at the right place. :*One factor identified by Arthur and Rose that helps achieve the maximum possible saving is to have an initial destination positioned so that descent to the initial destination starts immediately after the reclear fix. This is beneficial because it minimises the reserve fuel needed between reclear fix and initial destination, and hence maximises the amount of reserve fuel available at the reclear fix. :*The other factor which is also helpful is the positioning of the initial alternate airport. ==Filing suboptimal plans== Despite all the effort taken to optimise flight plans, there are certain circumstances in which it is advantageous to file suboptimal plans. In busy airspace with a number of competing aircraft, the optimum routes and preferred altitudes may be oversubscribed. This problem can be worse in busy periods, such as when everyone wants to arrive at an airport as soon as it opens for the day. If all the aircraft file optimal flight plans then to avoid overloading, air traffic control may refuse permission for some of the flight plans or delay the allocated takeoff slots. To avoid this a suboptimal flight plan can be filed, asking for an inefficiently low altitude or a longer, less congested route.Low Altitude Alternate Departure Routes Once airborne, part of the pilot's job is to fly as efficiently as possible so he/she might then try to convince air traffic control to allow them to fly closer to the optimum route. This might involve requesting a higher flight level than in the plan or asking for a more direct routing. If the controller does not immediately agree, it may be possible to re-request occasionally until they relent. Alternatively, if there has been any bad weather reported in the area, a pilot might request a climb or turn to avoid weather. Even if the pilot does not manage to revert to the optimal route, the benefits of being allowed to fly may well outweigh the cost of the suboptimal route. ==VFR flights== Although VFR flights often do not require filing a flight plan (Source?), a certain amount of flight planning remains necessary. The captain has to make sure that there will be enough fuel on board for the trip and sufficient reserve fuel for unforeseen circumstances. Weight and centre of gravity must remain within their limits during the whole flight. The captain must prepare an alternate flight plan for when landing at the original destination is not possible. In Canada, however, the regulations state that \\"... no pilot-in-command shall operate an aircraft in VFR flight unless a VFR flight plan or a VFR flight itinerary has been filed, except where the flight is conducted within 25 NM of the departure aerodrome.\\" ==Additional features== Over and above the various cost-reduction measures mentioned above, flight planning systems may offer extra features to help attract and retain customers: *Other routes :While a flight plan is produced for a specific route, flight dispatchers may wish to consider alternative routes. A flight planning system may produce summaries for, say, the next 4 best routes, showing zero fuel weight and total fuel for each possibility. *Reclear selection :There may be several possible reclear fixes and initial destinations, and which one is best depends on the weather and the zero fuel weight. A flight planning system can analyse each possibility and select whichever is best for this particular flight. *What-if summaries :On congested routes, air traffic control may require that an aircraft fly lower or higher than optimum. The total weight of passengers and cargo might not be known at the time the flight plan is prepared. To allow for these situations a flight planning system may produce summaries showing how much fuel would be needed if the aircraft is a little lighter or heavier, or if it is flying higher or lower than planned. These summaries allow flight dispatchers and pilots to check if there is enough reserve fuel to cope with a different scenario. *Fuel tank distribution :Most commercial aircraft have more than one fuel tank, and an aircraft manufacturer may provide rules as to how much fuel to load into each tank so as to avoid affecting the aircraft centre of gravity. The rules depend on how much fuel is to be loaded, and there may be different sets of rules for different total amounts of fuel. A flight planning system may follow these rules and produce a report showing how much fuel is to be loaded into each tank. *Tankering fuel :When fuel prices differ between airports, it might be worth putting in more fuel where it is cheap, even taking into account the cost of extra trip fuel needed to carry the extra weight. A flight planning system can work out how much extra fuel can profitably be carried. Note that discontinuities due to changes in flight levels can mean that a difference of as little as 100 kg (one passenger with luggage) in zero fuel weight or tankering fuel can make the difference between profit and loss. *Inflight diversion :While en route, an aircraft may be diverted to some airport other than the planned alternate. A flight planning system can produce a new flight plan for the new route from the diversion point and transmit it to the aircraft, including a check that there will be enough fuel for the revised flight. *Inflight refuelling :Military aircraft may refuel in midair. Such refuelling is a process rather than instantaneous. Some flight planning systems can allow for the change in fuel and show the effect on each aircraft involved. ==See also== * ICAO recommendations on use of the International System of Units *Balanced field takeoff *Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO) *Step climb *Maximum zero-fuel weight Flight planning providers: *AirData *Air Partner PLC *Air Support PPS *Air Routing International *ARINC *Electronic Data Systems (EDS) *FlightAware *Fltplan.com *Flugwerkzeuge aviation software ‚Äì part of Sabre HoldingsSabre Holdings acquires flight planning company f:wz *Jeppesen *Lufthansa Systems *Navbluehttps://www.navblue.aero/product/n-flight-planning/ *Portable Flight Planning Software (military) *RocketRoute *Sabre Airline Solutions *SITA *Skyplan Services Limitedhttps://www.skyplan.com/flight-planning/ *Takeflite Solutions *TopoFlight *Universal Weather and Aviation (Business Aviation) ‚Äì 3d Flight Planning Software ==References== Category:Aircraft operations ","title":"Flight planning"},{"id":"2227875","text":"Florida () is the capital of Florida Department of Uruguay.

The border with Brazil joins it with the Brazilian city of Santana do Livramento, which is only a street away from it, at the north end of Route 5. Together, they form an urban area of around 200,000 inhabitants. As of the census of 2011, it is the sixth most populated city of Uruguay. ==History== Obelisk of the Plaza Internacional, at the \\"Frontera de la Paz\\", between the cities of Rivera (Uruguay) and Santana do Livramento (Brazil). On 21 March 1860 a pueblo (village) named Pereira was created by the Act of Ley N¬∫ 614. On 7 May 1862, it was substituted by the villa (town) named Ceballos and founded by the Act of Ley N¬∫ 704, in honour of the Spanish viceroy Pedro de Cevallos. In July 1867 it took on the official name Rivera and was recognized as a villa. The Brazilian town Santana do Livramento already existed just across the border. On 1 October 1884, it became capital of the Department of Rivera by the Act of Ley N¬∫ 1.757. Its status was elevated to ciudad (city) on 10 June 1912 by the Act of Ley N¬∫ 4.006. In 1943, the Plaza Internacional Rivera-Livramento (see photo) was built to celebrate the Fifth Conference of the Commission Mixta for Mixed Limits and as a hope for the future integration of the two towns, claimed to be the only international square in the world. From 1851 to this day, inhabitants of both communities are free to move in both sides. Today, duty-free shops are one of the main economic resources of Rivera. The first inhabitants of the city were Spaniards, Italians, Portuguese and some Brazilians immigrants who lived in Santana do Livramento, on the Brazilian side of the border. ==Border control== The two cities of Rivera (Uruguay) and Santana do Livramento (Brazil) maintain an open border without any physical border barriers or checkpoints. Inhabitants of the twin cities are free to move anywhere within the two communities without having to undergo checks. Travellers crossing the border here and proceeding further into the other country are required to complete border formalities at an integrated border control post located at Si√±eriz Shopping in Rivera. The integrated border control post housing the immigration and customs offices of both countries was inaugurated on 28 December 2016. Previously, travellers had to visit various offices located in different parts of the twin cities. == Economy == One of the main economic activities of the city of Rivera is the free-shop stores, aimed at Brazilian neighbors, mainly coming from the cities of Rio Grande do Sul, near the border with Uruguay, making Rivera a popular destination for buying imported dollar products. With the fall in the price of the US currency, many devices can be bought for prices up to 40% smaller than similar ones sold in Brazil. The Rivera shopping limit is $300 per person. Purchases above this amount must be declared at the Federal Revenue Office for the payment of the corresponding import tax so that the product can legally enter Brazil. It is also worth mentioning the existence of a casino, located on one of the avenues where the border between the two countries runs. Within the department, livestock farming, agriculture and afforestation predominate. ==Population== In 2011, Rivera had a population of 64,465 {  !

His interest in show business began during his childhood, when he would accompany his mother, Carolyn Folks, to NBC studios in Burbank where she worked as a publicist. At age 14, Allen put together his first stand-up routine and began appearing on amateur night at comedy clubs throughout the Los Angeles area. ==Career== Comedian Jimmie Walker saw Allen's stand-up act and invited the 14-year-old comedian to join his comedy writing team alongside promising young comedians Jay Leno and David Letterman. At age 18, Allen made his television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. One of his earliest roles was as a regular presenter on the NBC series Real People, joining the cast at the beginning of the second season. His show Jammin was picked up as Kickin' It with Byron Allen in 1992, and by the end of its run had made the list of longest-running United States television series. Allen's foray into television production began in Los Angeles in 1993 when he founded Entertainment Studios with the launch of his first series ‚Äî Entertainers with Byron Allen ‚Äî a weekly, one-hour series profiling the current stars of film and television.

Two more departments were formed later in that year. At that time, Paysand√∫ Department included all the territory north of the R√≠o Negro, which included the current departments of Artigas, Rivera, Tacuaremb√≥, Salto, Paysand√∫ and R√≠o Negro. On 17 June 1837 a new division of Uruguay was made and this territory was divided in three parts. In the new division, the Tacuaremb√≥ Department included also the actual department of Rivera, until it was split from it in 1884. ==Geography== Topographic map of Tacuaremb√≥ Department showing main populated places and roads The south borders of the department are delimited by R√≠o Negro, which, as a result of the dam near Paso de los Toros along its course, forms the Rinc√≥n del Bonete Reservoir, also called the Gabriel Terra Reservoir.

The Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA-098) was built by Rockwell International as a testbed for the definitive propulsion and fuel delivery systems for the U.S. Space Shuttle Program. ==Description== Never intended for actual spaceflight, the MPTA consisted of the internal structure of a Space Shuttle orbiter aft- fuselage, a truss structure that simulated the basic structure and shape of an orbiter mid-fuselage and a complete Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) assembly, including all main propulsion system plumbing and the associated electrical systems. Later, the very different STA (Structural Test Article) was converted into a flightworthy orbiter, re-designated OV-099, and christened Challenger. Rockwell and NASA thus retroactively re-designated the MPTA as MPTA-098, though it was never christened with a name. ==History== On June 24, 1977, MPTA-098 was delivered by Rockwell International to the National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL), in Hancock County, Mississippi, where it was mated with the Main Propulsion Test Article External Tank (MPTA-ET), mounted in a launch orientation and used for static engine tests. On July 2, 1979, MPTA-098 suffered major structural damage due to a fractured fuel valve on Space Shuttle Main Engine number 2002. The fracture allowed hydrogen to leak into the enclosed aft compartment, raising the pressure to beyond the structural capability of the heat shield supports, severely damaging the structure. After extensive repairs were completed, testing resumed in September, but on November 4, a high-pressure oxidizer turbopump failed 9.7 seconds into a scheduled 510-second test. Finally, on December 17, 1979, a complete static firing was accomplished that included all three Space Shuttle Main Engines running at up to 100 percent of rated thrust for 554 seconds, exceeding the predicted maximum time that the SSMEs would burn during an operational shuttle launch. ===Flight certification=== The preliminary flight certification (PFC) program, which would clear the way for the SSMEs to be flown aboard manned vehicles, began in early 1980. A number of setbacks, including an overheating high-pressure turbopump that shut down an engine 4.6 seconds into a 544-second test on April 16, 1980, in July, the burn-through of a hydrogen preburner cancelled a 581-second test after 105 seconds and the structural failure of a flight-rated nozzle shut down a November 1980 test after 20 seconds, slowed progress dramatically. These failures led to a number of critical changes to the SSMEs and their associated systems. In June 1980, due to the number of changes in the SSME design since the SSME installation on Columbia, the three flight-rated SSMEs (numbers 2005, 2006 and 2007) which had performed successful individual 520-second mission demonstration test firings on the NSTL SSME test stand in early 1979, were removed from OV-102, shipped to NSTL, and successfully recertified. The engines were then shipped back to Kennedy Space Center and reinstalled on Columbia. Close-up of three Space Shuttle Main Engines mounted on MPTA-098 On January 17, 1981, with less than three months remaining before the scheduled STS-1 launch date, MPTA-098 successfully demonstrated a 625-second firing that included simulated abort profiles, completing the final PFC test and allowing the SSME design to be fully certified for flight, clearing the way for the launch of STS-1 on April 12, 1981. ===Shuttle-C=== From 1981 until 1988, the MPTA-098 and MPTA-ET remained in-situ on the NSTL test stand, unused. In late 1988, the Essex Corporation used the thrust structure of the MPTA as the basis for an engineering development model for the proposed Shuttle-C launch vehicle. The model was used by NASA and Boeing at Kennedy Space Center and the Marshall Space Flight Center to conduct fit-checks and manufacturing engineering studies. The Shuttle-C program was cancelled by the United States Congress in 1990 and the model was disassembled. ===Present status=== The Main Propulsion Test Article, without truss work, is on display at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center, Visitor Information Center for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, alongside the MPTA-ET which is mounted under the refurbished Pathfinder orbiter simulator. ==ChronologyConstruction=== * 07/26/72 Contract award * 07/17/74 Start of long-lead fabrication * 06/24/75 Start structural assembly of aft-fuselage * 01/23/76 Truss on dock at Rockwell Downey * 03/17/76 Complete premate at Downey and delivered to Palmdale * 05/03/76 Complete proof load test setup at Palmdale * 06/29/76 Move truss assembly from Palmdale Building 294 to 295 * 07/08/76 MPTA-098 on dock at Downey * 07/12/76 Start of Final Assembly * 07/24/76 Complete MPTA-098 proof load test * 05/27/77 Completed Final Assembly, Transport to Seal Beach * 06/03/77 Transport from Seal Beach to NSTL * 06/24/77 Arrival at NSTL for static firing * 09/10/77 Arrival of MPTA-ET at NSTL ===Test firings=== * 04/21/78 1st static firing (2.5 sec) * 05/19/78 2nd static firing (15 sec) * 06/15/78 3rd static firing (50 sec) * 07/07/78 4th static firing (100 sec) * 05/04/79 5th static firing flight nozzles (1.5 sec) * 06/12/79 5th static firing flight nozzles (54 sec) * 10/24/79 6th static firing flight nozzles (scrubbed) * 11/04/79 6th static firing flight nozzles (10 sec cutoff) * 12/17/79 6th static firing non-flight (554 sec) * 02/28/80 7th static firing non-flight (555 sec) * 03/28/80 8th static firing non-flight (539 sec) * 04/16/80 9th static firing non-flight (4.6 sec cutoff) * 05/30/80 9th static firing non-flight (565 sec cutoff) * 07/12/80 10th static firing flight nozzles (105 sec shutdown) * 11/03/80 11th static firing flight nozzles (20 sec shutdown) * 12/04/80 11th static firing non-flight (591 sec) * 01/17/81 12th static firing flight nozzles (625 sec) ==See also== *Boilerplate * MPTA- ET * Space Shuttle Main Engine ==Further reading== * Category:Space Shuttle program ","title":"MPTA-098"},{"id":"2227933","text":"The University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance is an undergraduate and graduate institution for the performing arts in the United States. It is part of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. The school was founded by Calvin Brainerd Cady in 1880 as the Ann Arbor School of Music, and it was later incorporated into the University of Michigan with Cady joining the faculty. With the exception of the Department of Dance, the School is located on the University of Michigan's North Campus, which is also home to the College of Engineering, the School of Information, and the Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning.About North Campus, Go North. Retrieved 12 February 2013. ==History== The school was founded in 1880. Administrators and Deans include Charles Sink, Earl V. Moore, James B. Wallace, Allen Britton, Paul Boylan, Karen Wolff (2000‚Äì05), Christopher Kendall (2005‚Äì15), Aaron Dworkin (2015-18), and David Gier (2018‚Äìpresent). The school was originally independent of the university. ===Notable alumni=== Well known alumni include playwright Arthur Miller, actors James Earl Jones, Gavin Creel, Darren Criss, David Alan Grier and Lucy Liu, musicians Jessye Norman, Yakov Kreizberg, Ashley Putnam, William Albright, George Crumb, Alexander Frey, Normand Lockwood, Cynthia Phelps, Colin Stetson, David Daniels, Chip Davis, and Michael Fabiano, as well as the pop star Madonna. See also the list of list of University of Michigan arts alumni. ==Performance training areas== The University puts on more than a dozen main stage productions and concerts every year. Besides its main stage productions, the school also offers performance opportunities through studio productions and student-run groups. ===Main stage and studio productions=== Main stage and studio productions staged by the university every year include: *Three main stage musicals and a musical theatre studio show (often a play) *Two main stage operas as well as opera scenes, and two studio productions *Four or five main stage plays *Multiple dance productions ===Ensembles=== Musicians have the opportunity to perform in many ensembles in connection with the university. These include choral ensembles, orchestras, wind bands, historical music ensembles, jazz ensembles, electronic and new music ensembles, chamber music groups, and world music ensembles. Gamelans The school is home to one of the longest- established Javanese gamelan ensembles in the United States. This group of instruments, known formally as Kyai Telaga Madu (Venerable Lake of Honey), has been at the university since 1966, when its purchase was negotiated and organized by Bill Malm. From 1968 until 2002, the ensemble was under the direction of faculty ethnomusicologist Judith Becker. The ensemble is currently directed by Susan Walton. Bands Wind ensembles, under the University Bands, provide a central performance and training opportunity for students at the school. The wind ensembles provide a primary training opportunity for most instrumentalists at the school, who may audition to perform in one of the two top ensembles, the Symphony Band and Concert Band. The Michigan Marching Band is also a component of the University Bands and provides music and entertainment at university athletic events. Orchestras Students also receive training in large orchestral ensembles. ===Student organizations=== Student organizations through the university include: * Arts Enterprise which invites students to create projects and make connections to the local, national, and international cultural spheres. * Basement Arts which allows students the opportunity to direct, produce and star in studio productions. This student group is well known for performing student written works such as A Very Potter Musical. *MUSKET, founded in 1908, puts on two large scale productions of musicals every year run entirely by students. Recent Productions have included: Rent, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and Into the Woods. * The University of Michigan Gilbert and Sullivan Society, which produces main stage productions of operettas every year. Most of these are works by Gilbert and Sullivan, however they have also ventured into other works. ==Facilities== The school's facilities are located in Ann Arbor, Michigan. On the University of Michigan north campus, these include the Earl V. Moore Building, the Stearns Building, the Walgreen Drama Center, and the Lurie Carillon. Specific north campus facilities include studios in the James and Anne Duderstadt Center, as well as the Arthur Miller Theater and the Stamps Auditorium (both in the Walgreen Drama Center). The Miller Theater is the only theater given permission by the estate of Arthur Miller to bear the playwright's name. On central campus, the school's facilities include Hill Auditorium, the Power Center, the Dance Building, and Burton Memorial Tower, which houses the Charles Baird Carillon. The university's south campus is home to William D. Revelli Hall, which houses offices and rehearsal space for the University of Michigan Marching Band. ===History of the Moore Building=== The majority of the school's teaching spaces, faculty offices, and music library, are located in the Earl V. Moore Building. This building is named after a previous dean of the school, and was designed in a mid-century modern style by architect Eero Saarinen. Saarinen was commissioned to design the master plan for the University of Michigan's North Campus, he requested to design the music school building (now the Earl V. Moore Building). The original scheme called for an L-shaped building and a circular concert hall. Completed in 1964, the result was a five-level pavilion with flanking wings. Saarinen envisioned a building in harmony with nature, and so designed the building to be built into a hill overlooking a pond. The brick-clad concrete structure has narrow vertical windows that contrast with the horizontal brick patterns, thought to represent the alternating colors of piano keys. The brick color is known as ‚ÄúCranbrook Buff‚Äù for its reference to the color of the buildings on the campus of the Cranbrook Education Community. The style of this building has influenced almost all of the later construction on North Campus. The building contains 2 rehearsal/concert halls, 45 performance teaching studios, 18 classrooms, 40 offices, a large library, 120 practice rooms, including 12 organ practice rooms, and other special facilities for piano, harp, harpsichord and percussion practice. The construction of this building allowed for the first increase in enrollment since 1946. During construction of the building, Saarinen was diagnosed with a brain tumor, but he was able to watch the progress of the building from his room at University Hospital. According to the financial report submitted by President Harlan Hatcher to the Board of Regents in 1966, the University of Michigan had the second academic music school in the United States, after the University of Indiana School of Music. The Ann Arbor campus and the University Division of the National Music Camp at Interlochen enrolled the largest summer music session in the U.S. ===Renovation=== On October 30, 2012, University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman announced an $8-million gift from William K. Brehm and Delores S. Brehm, a major contribution toward the cost of renovating and expanding the Moore Building. Of the total cost, another $14 million is allocated from the university, with the remaining balance to come from additional fundraising, including a gift from Glenn E. Watkins, emeritus professor of musicology. Construction for the project commenced in early 2014 and was finished in the fall of 2015. The renovation, which cost 29.5 million and added 34,000 square feet, includes a rehearsal with the footprint of Hill Auditorium, revamping of the McIntosh Theater, a lecture hall, an entrance and lobby, and new practice and teaching rooms. ==Departments and degree programs== The School of Music, Theatre & Dance offers degrees from the bachelors to the doctoral level. Fifteen departments make up the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, each offering several degree programs. They include: *Department of Chamber Music‚ÄîMM in chamber music. *Department of Composition‚ÄîBM, BMA, MM, MA, PhD and DMA in composition. *Department of Conducting‚ÄîMM and DMA in Conducting (Band/Wind Ensemble, Orchestral and Choral programs). *Department of Dance‚ÄîBFA and MFA in Dance. *Department of Jazz and Improvisation Studies‚ÄîBFA in Jazz and Contemplative Studies, Jazz Studies and Jazz and Contemporary Improvation, BMA in Jazz Studies, MM in Improvisation. *Department of Music Education‚ÄîBM in Choral or Instrumental Music Education, MM in Music Education. *Department of Music Theory‚ÄîBM, BMA and PhD in Music Theory. *Department of Musical Theatre‚ÄîBFA in Musical Theatre. *Department of Musicology‚ÄîBM, BMA, Specialist and Certificate programs in Musicology, PhD in Historical Musicology, PhD in Ethnomusicology. *Department of Organ‚ÄîBM and BMA in Organ Performance, MM in Church Music, MM Carillon Performance, MM in Early Keyboard Instruments, MM Harpsichord performance, MM Organ Performance, DMA Harpsichord Performance, DMA Organ Performance, and DMA Liturgical, Church, and Synagogue Music. *Department of Performing Arts Technology‚ÄîBM in Music and Technology, BM in Performing Arts Technology, Music Concentration, BFA in Performing Arts Technology, Media Arts Concentration BS in Sound Engineering, and MA in Media Arts. *Department of Piano‚ÄîBM in Piano Performance, BMA in Piano Performance, MM in Chamber Music (Piano), MM in Collaborative Piano, MM in Early Keyboard Instruments, MM in Performance: Fortepiano, MM in Performance: Piano, MM in Piano Pedagogy & Performance, Specialist in Collaborative Piano, DMA in Piano Performance, DMA in Collaborative Piano, DMA in Piano Pedagogy & Performance. *Department of Strings‚ÄîHarp, Violin, Viola, Cello, Double Bass: BM or BMA in Performance, MM in Performance, MM in Chamber Music, Specialist in Performance, DMA in Performance. *Department of Theatre and Drama‚ÄîBFA in Performance, Design and Production, and Interarts Performance, BTA. *Department of Voice‚ÄîBM, BMA, MM, Specialist and DMA in Performance. *Department of Winds and Percussion‚ÄîBM in Performance, BM in Wind Instruments, BMA in Performance, MM in Performance, MM in Chamber Music, MM in Wind Instruments, Special in Performance, DMA in Performance. ==Notable projects== Michigan Performance Outreach Workshop *In 2011, musical theatre students Ashley Park and Laura Reed founded the Michigan Performance Outreach Workshop, or MPOW. The group coordinates a one-day event every semester which brings in students from Detroit Public Schools for a day of arts performances and lessons. All of the activities and performances are given and led by U of M students from a variety of disciplines, including singers, dancers, musicians and actors. The event is provided free of charge and includes lunch for DPS students, and is dedicated to providing youth who have limited creative outlets with exposure to as many aspects of the performing arts as possible. The Gershwin Initiative *In 2013, the School entered into a partnership with the Gershwin family to undertake a two-part initiative that will bring the music of George and Ira Gershwin to students, scholars, performers and audiences across campus and worldwide through new critical editions of all the Gershwin brothers' works. An American in Paris (edited by Mark Clague) and Rhapsody in Blue (jazz band version) will be the first editions published. University of Michigan Javanese Gamelan *Since the 1960s, the school has been home to one of the longest-established Javanese gamelan ensembles in the United States. This group of instruments, known formally as Kyai Telaga Madu (Venerable Lake of Honey), has been at the university since 1966, when its purchase was negotiated and organized by Bill Malm. From 1968 until 2002, the ensemble was under the direction of faculty ethnomusicologist Judith Becker. The ensemble has actively given performances in Ann Arbor since 1967, and has benefitted from many guest artist instructors from Java who have been in residence at the university to teach Indonesian performance styles such as wayang. The gamelan is housed in a special room built at the school with support from a bequest from Rosannah Steinhoff, who with her husband Bill, was a loyal member of the gamelan in the 1980s, and it is supported with a special endowment fund at the university. The gamelan instruments are part of the Stearns Collection of Music Instruments. EXCEL Program * Founded in 2015, the career program at the School of Music, Theatre & Dance, EXCEL (Excellence in Entrepreneurship, Career Empowerment, and Leadership), provides individual career coaching, workshops, and more than $100,000 in annual funding for student projects, including new venture incubation (the EXCELerator) and an annual $10,000 EXCELprize. ==Research== *American Music Institute *U-M Amerigrove Project *Gershwin Initiative *EXCEL *MPOW ==References== Music, University of Michigan School of Category:Music schools in Michigan Category:Music of Ann Arbor, Michigan Category:Dance schools in the United States Category:Performing arts education in the United States Category:Educational institutions established in 1880 Category:Drama schools in the United States Category:1880 establishments in Michigan Category:Dance in Michigan Category:University of Michigan campus ","title":"University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre &amp; Dance"},{"id":"2227943","text":"The Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study brings together researchers from many disciplines to study the phenomenon known as the mind. A unit of George Mason University, the Krasnow Institute also serves as a center for doctoral education in neuroscience. Research at the Institute is funded by agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense. ==History== Krasnow Institute building front entranceThe Krasnow Institute was chartered in 1990 as a result of a bequest from Shelley Krasnow, a long-time resident of the National Capital Area. The work of the Institute began in 1993 with a scientific conference, co-sponsored with The Santa Fe Institute (SFI) and hosted at George Mason University. This conference on \\"The Mind, the Brain, and Complex Adaptive Systems\\" brought together an unusual group of scientists including two Nobel laureates (Murray Gell-Mann and Herbert A. Simon) and produced new approaches to this frontier in addition to a book published by SFI. The Mind, The Brain And Complex Systems, Morowitz and Singer Eds 1993 These efforts set the Institute on the path of human cognition within the context of the intersection of neuroscience, cognitive psychology and computer sciences. ==Current Institute== MRI viewed from console roomThe Krasnow Institute is home to a scientific community of 100 (many of them Ph.D.'s) most of whom are also either faculty or trainees at George Mason University. The range of their research on cognition spans from molecules to mind. The Institute is housed in a dedicated facility on the Fairfax Campus of George Mason which includes extensive wet-laboratories, computer labs, a 3T MRI human brain imaging center, a cellular imaging facility, as well as faculty offices and breakout space. Additional research space on the Fairfax campus houses the Institute's Center for Social Complexity. ==An Academic Unit of George Mason University== The Krasnow Institute is also an academic unit of George Mason University. It houses the department of Molecular Neuroscience, which plays a key role in the interdisciplinary neuroscience doctoral program. The Institute hosted several events in the \\"Decade of the Mind\\" initiative, which urged the U.S. Congress to invest in understanding how mind emerges from brain. What Makes Up My Mind, Joel Achenbach, Washington Post Sept 23, 2007 The Institute has collaborated closely with the Janelia Research Campus of Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the National Institutes of Health to develop better methods of reconstructing neuronal architectures. Diadem Challenge ==Research== Researchers at the Institute include neuroscientists, bio-engineers, computer scientists, and computational social scientists. The Institute's various research programs are conducted by three centers (described below) and multiple lab groups. Many of the programs focus on research that may lead to cures to some of the most devastating brain diseases. ===The Center for Neural Informatics, Neural Structures, and Neural Plasticity (CN3)=== The Center for Neural Informatics, Neural Structures, and Neural Plasticity (CN3) pursues fundamental breakthroughs in neuroscience by fostering neuroinformatic and computational approaches to neuroplasticity and neuroanatomy. By bringing together faculty expertise in these multiple disciplines, the Center provides opportunities for cross-training in neuroscience, psychology, and engineering, both at the graduate and postdoctoral levels. CN3 researchers investigate the relationship between brain structure, activity, and function from the subcellular to the network level, with a specific focus on the biophysical and biochemical mechanisms of learning and memory. In the long term, we seek to create large-scale, biologically plausible network models of entire portions of the mammalian brain, such as the hippocampus, to understand the neural circuits and cellular events underlying the expression, storage, and retrieval of associative memory. ===Center for Neuroeconomics=== Krasnow scientists are using functional magnetic resonance imaging of the human brain to study human interactions within the context of free-markets. These studies allow, for the first time, the elucidation of a biological basis for economic decisions. ===Center for Social Complexity (CSC)=== Scientific projects at the Center for Social Complexity focus on investigating social systems and processes on multiple scales: groups, organizations, economies, societies, regions, international systems. Researchers use a variety of interdisciplinary tools, including multi-agent systems and agent-based models (including the MASON toolkit in Java), cellular automata and other social simulation methods, network and graph-theoretic models, GIS (geographic information systems), events data analysis, complexity-theoretic models and other advanced computational methods. The Center houses a specialized simulation environment (the Simulatorium), where faculty, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate research assistants collaborate in a variety of projects. Conflict and cooperation, emergent economic systems, network dynamics, and long-term societal adaptation to environmental change are among the current lines of investigation. Funding for the Center is provided by grants from the US National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, and other agencies. The center does work in computational sociology. ==References External links == * Category:George Mason University Category:Educational institutions established in 1990 Category:Research institutes in the United States Category:Cognitive science research institutes Category:Artificial intelligence laboratories Category:Laboratories in the United States Category:1990 establishments in Virginia ","title":"Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study"},{"id":"2227949","text":"NS√ç Runav√≠k is a Faroese football club, playing in Runav√≠k founded 24 March 1957.

The series was directed by Tomoki Kyoda, with series composition by Dai Sat≈ç, character designs by Kenichi Yoshida and music by Naoki Sat≈ç. Eureka Seven tells the story of Renton Thurston and the outlaw group Gekkostate, his relationship with the enigmatic mecha pilot Eureka, and the mystery of the Coralians. The fifty episode series premiered in Japan on MBS between April 17, 2005 and April 2, 2006 and was subsequently licensed by Funimation in North America, Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand and by Anime Limited in the United Kingdom for English home video releases. The series spawned six manga adaptations, a light novel, three video games and a feature- length anime film which was released in Japan on April 25, 2009. One of the manga titled Eureka Seven: AO which was serialized in Sh≈çnen Ace between January 2012 and October 2013, was further adapted into an anime series which aired twenty-four episodes in Japan between April 13 and November 20, 2012. Eureka Seven was well received by critics and earned several awards at numerous award shows in Japan, most notably the 2006 Tokyo International Anime Fair. ==OverviewSetting=== ; Scub Coral : Eureka Seven takes place in the year 12005 and it's now been 10,000 years after humanity has made a mass exodus into space, due to the arrival of the , an intelligent, sentient life who merged with the planet, forcing the humans to abandon it. In the current timeline, the remnants of humanity are now settled on an unknown planet (actually a terraformed Earth) known as the Land of Kanan, but the majority of the surface of this planet is now covered by a rock-like surface formed by the Scub Coral. The Scub Coral inhabited the Planet until the return of humans. The theory that the Scub Coral is an intelligent life form was proposed by the scientist Adroc Thurston, who also claimed the Scub is looking for mutual co- existence with humanity. All theories and information about the Scub Coral being a sentient being are kept from the general population. In addition to being the surface of the planet, the Scub Coral has several physical manifestations, called , that are observed throughout the series. These manifestations are either natural occurrences or a response to attacks from humans. The manifestations are: ; Command Cluster Coralian : The Command Cluster is a large concentration of the Scub Coral which acts as the central mind for the rest of its \\"body\\". It stores all the information the Scub has collected over the last 10,000 years, and keeps the rest of the Scub Coral in a dormant state. ; Kute-class Coralian : A Kute-class is massive sphere of concentrated energy that materializes suddenly in the skies. Though it is a rare natural occurrence, they can be artificially triggered by causing heavy damage to the Scub Coral. The disappearance of a Kute causes a massive release of energy, ravaging the surrounding landscape and lowering the Trapar count in the area to almost non-existent levels. ; Antibody Coralians : Antibody Coralians are, as the name suggests, creatures created by the Scub Coral to destroy anything nearby that might be causing it harm. They are unleashed in massive swarms through a Kute-class Coralian when the Scub Coral is threatened or attacked. These antibodies can range in size from as small as a wheelbarrow, or as large as a bomber plane. Their shapes vary wildly, from eyeballs to flying slugs to giant hovering flower-like objects. Most forms are based on the sea creatures they absorbed when they just started their 'growth'. Their powers are: sending lasers in profusion from their bodies, thus being able to destroy large aircraft, burrowing into a victim's body and imploding it (unconfirmed), and creating a spherical void, which makes anything within its surface area to vanish. Antibody Coralians generally appear in response to deliberate attacks on the Scub Coral. They appear for 1246 seconds (20 minutes 46 seconds) - which is the amount of time the Seven Swell phenomenon is active. After those 1246 seconds, they crumble to dust. Their appearances are that of basic invertebrates such as flat worms, mollusks, and cnidaria. One of each kind appears in Another Century's Episode 3: The Final and Super Robot Wars Z. ; Human-form Coralians : Human-form Coralians are beings created by the Scub Coral in the form of humans. They are regarded by scientists as emissaries of the Scub Coral, sent to learn about humanity. Humans have attempted to create their own artificial human-form Coralians, but the results are often less than satisfactory. As shown with Eureka in the sequel series, human-form Coralians are biologically capable of reproducing the same way as humans do; she gave birth to a daughter and son. However, due to her children being Human-Coralian hybrids, the high level of Trapar would be too dangerous for them. ; Trapar waves and lifting : In Eureka Seven, as a result of the Scub Coral covering the planet, the atmosphere is permeated by an enigmatic energy known as , dubbed waves for short. Norbu, the Vodarac leader, states that all thought carries with it energy. As a result, a sentient life form on the scale of the Scub Coral produces a tremendous amount of energy. The most important use of Trapar energy is its use as a method of propulsion for flight-capable vehicles. : Though Trapar-propelled airships are relatively common, using Trapar waves for is their predominant use. Lifting uses surfboard-like devices called \\"reflection boards\\" ( for short) to ride Trapar waves in a manner similar to surfing, and is a popular sport in the series. The most grandiose use of Trapar‚Äîmassive humanoid fightercraft‚Äîare a recent development, made possible by the discovery of bizarre alien life-forms within the Scub Coral. ===Plot=== The series focuses on Renton Thurston, the fourteen-year-old son of Adrock Thurston, a military researcher who died saving the world. He lives what he considers a boring life with his grandfather in a boring town. He loves lifting, a sport similar to surfing but with trapar, a substance abundant throughout the air, as the medium. He dreams of joining the renegade group Gekkostate, led by his idol Holland Novak, a legendary lifter. An opportunity to do so literally falls into his lap when a large mechanical robot, called the Nirvash type ZERO, and Eureka, its pilot and a member of Gekkostate, crash into Renton's room. Renton's grandfather orders him to deliver a special part to the Nirvash called the \\"Amita Drive\\", which releases the immense power dormant within the type ZERO called the \\"Seven Swell Phenomenon\\". Afterwards, Renton is invited to join Gekkostate, where he quickly discovers that the behind-the-scenes life of Gekkostate is hardly as glamorous or as interesting as printed in the glossy pages of their magazine, ray=out. Only one thing makes it all worthwhile for him: the presence of Eureka, the mysterious pilot of the Nirvash. Renton, Eureka, and the Gekkostate embark on an adventure that will shape their future as well as the world's. ==Development== The series was made by Bones and co-produced by Bandai Entertainment. Bandai Entertainment provided the title and handled the creative aspects of the series. Bandai had originally proposed a mecha anime series to the animation studio Bones. The studio had initially rejected it, but later reversed its position because it had already planned to create an anime using mecha designs by Shoji Kawamori. With the appointment of director Tomoki Kyoda and writer Dai Sat≈ç, Bandai's proposal was more or less scrapped and the staff began work on their own series that would become Eureka Seven. While conceptualizing Eureka Seven, Kyoda \\"wanted something that reflected the music and the subculture of his generation‚Äîand a love story.\\" As such the show contains several references from music of the 1980s and the 1990s, and almost all of the show's episodes are named after real songs, composed by both Japanese and foreign artists. The director wished to design the series as one that would at first focus on the personal elements and conflicts of the characters, then subsequently move the framework into a broader scale and perspective. The series' two halves each have their own very clear focus that reflects this design choice. With the premise of the surfer robots in mind, Sat≈ç interviewed several real-life surfers and came to conclusion that they are close to nature. From this perception, he envisioned the environmental thematic as central point of the story. He said \\"I thought it might be an effective message for children, especially in Japan. It's pretty veiled. I didn't want to be preachy.\\" ==ReleaseAnime=== Eureka Seven consists of fifty episodes which aired from April 17, 2005, to April 2, 2006, on the Mainichi Broadcasting System and Tokyo Broadcasting System networks. Eureka Seven was available for online viewing on the Adult Swim Fix, Adult Swim's online video service before its televised debut on the Adult Swim channel between April 15, 2006, and ended on April 28, 2007. Adult Swim traditionally cut down the opening and ending themes from each episode to fit the series to American television's time restraints, which resulted in the final episode's first airing having actual content cut from it as the episode originally had no theme song sequences; it was re-aired properly the following week. In Canada, Eureka Seven premiered on YTV's Bionix block on September 8, 2006. Bandai Entertainment and its affiliates distributed the English version of Eureka Seven. It was released in the United States and Canada by Bandai Visual USA, in the United Kingdom by Beez Entertainment, and in Australia by Madman Entertainment.

On January 6, 2014, Manga Entertainment had released the first half of the series. An anime sequel titled Eureka Seven: AO began airing on April 12, 2012, and ended on November 20, 2012.

It is 30 km from the Venezuelan border. ===Climate=== In√≠rida has a tropical rainforest climate (Af). It has heavy to very heavy rainfall year-round. ==Economy== The main economic activities in the municipality, aside from government, are agriculture, fishingCastro, Dario M.

Laus perennis was imported to Western Europe at St. Maurice's Abbey in Agaunum, where it was carried on, day and night, by several choirs, or turmae, who succeeded each other in the recitation of the divine office, so that prayer went on without cessation. Called the Akoimetoi (\\"Sleepless Ones\\"), these monks prayed \\"a monastic round of twenty-four offices to fill every hour.\\"Barbara H.

The inauguration of laus perennis at Agaunum circa 515 was the occasion of a solemn ceremony, and of a sermon by St. Avitus which survives.Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Agaunum\\" On-line text. The \\"custom of Agaunum\\", as it came to be called, spread over Gaul, to Lyons, Ch√¢lons, the Abbey of Saint Denis, to Luxeuil, Saint-Germain at Paris, Saint Medard at Soissons, to Saint-Riquier, and was taken up by the monks of Remiremont Abbey and Laon Abbey, though the Abbey of Agaunum had ceased to practice it from the beginning of the ninth century.Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Acometae\\" On-line text. ==Perpetual adoration== The various Roman Catholic orders of nuns dedicated to the perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament may be seen as a modern variation on this theme, because in addition to the usual complete daily liturgical celebration of the Eucharist and Divine Office, these monastic communities also observe a perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, which usually involves having at least two members of the monastic community always being present in prayerful, silent contemplation of the Blessed Sacrament (i.e., a consecrated Host) exposed to view in a monstrance on the altar of the principal chapel. These monastic communities may themselves see their particular vocation as a part of a larger, more traditional monastic order, such as the Benedictine Sisters of Perpetual Adoration in Clyde, Missouri. ==Present day== The International House of Prayer in Kansas City, MO, a 24-7 prayer houseThe first known Protestant continuous prayer was the \\"Hourly Intercession\\" of the Moravian Brethren in Herrnhut, Saxony. Beginning in 1727, the prayer continued 24 hours a day every day uninterrupted for over 100 years. The Moravian Unity began this continuous prayer vigil anew in 1957 as part of their 500th anniversary observance. Today, perpetual prayer is a common practice in many churches. Often the term 24-7 prayer is used to express that the prayer continues 24 hours 7 days a week. A notable example of current day perpetual prayer is the Jerusalem House of Prayer, International House of Prayer in Kansas City as well as other prayer houses such as the Justice House of Prayer that were inspired by this ministry. Many churches organize 24-7 prayer weeks that last for one or several weeks. Also, many of the Cursillo, Walk to Emmaus and other similar Three Day and 4th Day Movements employ a similar laus perennis model during the actual retreats as 4th Day members who have already attended the events sign up for and maintain a continuous prayer clock throughout each retreat of each community with specific prayers for each new participant, or pilgrim. ==See also== *Eucharistic adoration *Forty Hours' Devotion ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * www.24-7prayer.com official website of 24-7 Prayer International, a UK registered charity * www.24-7gebed.nl official website of 24-7 Prayer in the Netherlands Category:Christian movements Category:Christian prayer ","title":"Continual prayer"},{"id":"2227976","text":"U.S. Rangers train on the terrain of the 8 November 1942 assault at Arzew Arzew inhabitants meet U.S. troops during Operation Torch (November 1942) 'Arzew or Arzeu (' Berber; ) is a port city in Algeria, 25 miles (40 km) from Oran. It is the capital of Arzew District, Oran Province. ==HistoryAntiquity=== Like the rest of North Africa, the site of modern-day Arzew was originally inhabited by the Berbers. Arzew's original Berber population came mainly from the nearby town of Bethioua, families from nearby Mostaganem, Kabyles that were deported there, as well as some semi-nomadic tribe called Hamian. It was named Arsenaria, or Portus Magnus (Great Harbour) under the Roman Empire (the latter name is the one that can be seen in its former coat of arms). It has several Roman remains, mosaics, and artworks, which were removed to the museum of nearby Oran. During Roman times, Arzew's exports used to be grain and salt. The Vandals destroyed Portus Magnus in 429/430. Since the Muslim conquests, it regained some importance, as it was noted by the geographer El Bekri, during his description of North Africa (1068) where he described the Roman ruins as Arzao, an abandoned Roman port. The Almohads refounded the port in 1162. Under the Ziyanids, the port, located near the Ziyanid Tlemcen was renamed to Marsa Ben Zian (i.e. the port of the Zian tribe). ===French Algeria=== On 10 July 1833, the French forces coming from Oran went further east and occupied the locality, which was then simply called Marsa (i.e. port). After years of war (ended by the Treaty of Desmichels) Arzew became a legal possession of France, with its name transliterated in Arabic as Arziou (Arziw) and in French as Arzowe. King Louis-Philippe ordered the creation of the settlement of Arzew Le Port on 12 August 1845, which encouraged people from Europe to settle the area. It became a fully functional commune on 31 December 1856. It was an important war site during World War II (see Operation Torch). During the Algerian War the city hosted one of the two SDECE French intelligence service CIPCGs (\\"counter-guerrilla and pacification instruction centre\\").Fr√©d√©ric Guelton: The French Army 'Centre for Training and Preparation in Counter-Guerrilla Warfare' (CIPCG) at Arzew, Journal of Strategic Studies, vol. 22:2 (2002), pp.35-55. ===Algerian republic=== After the independence of Algeria in 1962, Arzew became an important port and industrial area, home to a refinery exporting LNG (liquified natural gas), as well as a fleet of small fishing boats to work the local waters. ==DemographyCulture== During the French colonial era, the settlers introduced a Roman Catholic celebration on August 15 -Assumption of Mary day- known as the \\"Procession of the Virgin\\" (la Procession de la Vierge). ==NotesReferences== * * * ==External links== *111th Observation Squadron World War II Narrative History, Part VI: The Battle Of Arzew - John C.L.

Before she can find the number, one of the Bringers appears behind her with a knife. She backs away to escape the cloaked figure and others like him until she hits a wall, but before the Bringers can attack, Buffy arrives and rescues the young Potential Slayer. Once Buffy disposes of the Bringers, Buffy welcomes the frightened woman, Rona, to Sunnydale. At the Summers house, Willow struggles to sleep on the floor of her room while Kennedy talks constantly from her spot on the bed. Kennedy talks about the luxurious life she had when she was younger, prompts Willow to do some magic and repeatedly attempts to get Willow to join her on the bed, making Willow uncomfortable. Downstairs, Molly tells several new Slayers-in-Training about the recently killed Anabelle. Xander suggests they be quiet and sleep, but a still-bound and very bored Andrew suggests they speak louder. Buffy arrives with Rona and the gang is updated on the recent activities and findings. The gang lacks answers to most of their current problems like destroying the Turok-Han and rescuing Spike from the First Evil. The Slayers in Training are worried and lacking confidence. Giles suggests they seek answers from an oracle-like creature known as Beljoxa's Eye. Down in the cave where he's kept prisoner, Spike is approached by one of the Bringers, but for once, he fights back and breaks free of the bonds that hold him to a wall. He runs through the tunnels and finds Buffy waiting for him, but quickly is pulled away from his dream and into reality where the First Evil, looking like Buffy, is waiting for him. Giles and Anya go together to meet with a demon, named Torg, about Beljoxa's Eye. After some careful persuasion, Torg opens up a dimensional portal for the both of them to pass through. On the other side, they find themselves in a dark, windy dimension and soon come face-to-face with a caged mass of eyes, the Beljoxa's Eye. Willow gets a call from a member of the Coven in England. Andrew is freed from his bonds and Buffy attempts to scare him by asking if he's ever seen Misery, which Andrew starts comparing with the book before he realizes the implied threat. Willow informs Buffy about another potential Slayer in town and Buffy rushes off with Xander to pick the girl up before the Bringers do. As they leave, Dawn questions the usefulness of these potential slayers. The Slayers in Training work out in the basement of Buffy's house and thanks to some depressing comments from Eve, they talk about the seemingly insurmountable challenge they are facing and being called as a Slayer. Buffy and Xander knock at the room where the latest potential slayer is staying. When no one answers, Buffy kicks the door in and they find a dead blond girl lying on the ground. Upon closer inspection, they find that the girl is Eve and she's been dead for days. Back at the house, Andrew, still desperate to get on the Scoobies' good side, asks Dawn how he could be useful, but Dawn informs Andrew that Buffy gave her permission to kill him if he talks too much. Suddenly, Buffy and Xander return to the house and go down to the basement, where they tell \\"Eve\\" to get away from the others. The First in Eve's form finally reveals itself and with some thanks for all the information over the past few days and threatening comments about the future, then disappears. In the other dimension, Giles and Anya speak with the Beljoxa's Eye, which tells them that the First Evil cannot be destroyed and that its mission exists now because of a disruption in the Slayer's line, which was in fact, caused by the Slayer. The gang, all worried after the frightening invasion by the First, talk about what they are going to do. Buffy tries to keep the potential Slayers calm, but they continue to worry about whether they are prepared to handle anything that lies before them. Buffy and Willow exchange glances and then both leave the dining room, followed by a confused Xander while the others continue to panic. Back in the cave, the First approaches the Turok-Han as Eve and sends him out to kill everyone except \\"her.\\" A crowd of Bringers forms outside Buffy's house that night, but do nothing but keep the Slayers from leaving. Buffy disperses weapons to the gang as they all wait for the expected attack of the Turok-Han. Willow practices some simple magic to see if the First would go after her again. Kennedy interrupts and is intrigued by Willow's skills and her past struggles with it. Willow warns her that the evil magic she's been exposed to in the past is not something Kennedy wants to see. The Turok-Han charges at the house and breaks the front door down. Willow puts up a barrier that keeps the vampire at bay, but it's almost too much for Willow and Buffy instructs everyone to run out the back. The gang encounters Bringers in the backyard, but they are destroyed and the gang runs off as the Turok-Han finally breaks through Willow's magical barrier. Meanwhile, Anya and Giles return to their usual dimension and Giles explains that the disturbance in the Slayer line was Buffy's revival from death. Anya realizes that if they had never brought Buffy back to life, the First wouldn't be doing this to them now. The gang runs down the street together and then Buffy tells them to break up. Willow and Xander lead the potential slayers, as well as Dawn and Andrew to a safe location while Buffy turns and attacks the Turok-Han. After a brief struggle, Buffy runs and tries to get the vampire to follow her. Xander leads the way through a construction site, which the potential Slayers find to be an extremely exposed and unsafe location for them hiding at. The Turok-Han appears, proving that it decided to go after the easier potential Slayers instead of Buffy. Kennedy prepares to attack the vampire, but then bright lights flood the site and Buffy appears as the potential Slayers move back to watch from a distance. Buffy tells the ubervamp that he's going to help her set an example for the other girls and begins a fight. A vicious battle ensues, but the ubervamp again proves to be stronger. As Dawn watches, she realizes aloud that Willow and Buffy planned everything as a teaching tool. A quick flashback to the panic-filled discussion at the house earlier shows that at the moment that Buffy, Willow and Xander left the others, the three were communicating telepathically about a plan to destroy the ubervamp and boost morale of the others at the same time. The potential slayers begin to worry as Buffy ends up on the losing end of the fight, but Willow tells them to wait. Just in time, Buffy turns things around and strikes the ubervamp with a few harmful blows. Buffy finally grabs a wire to wrap around the vampire's neck and pulls until she beheads the creature, turning it to dust. The Turok-Han dusted, the bruised and blood splattered Buffy ends her lesson and leads the newly confident Slayers-in- Training back home. In the cave, Spike tries to tell off the First in Buffy's form as she stands before him with a knife in hand. Buffy cuts away his bonds as Spike wraps his arm around her, realizing it's not the First but the real Buffy. She helps the sobbing vampire out of the cave. ==Production detailsWriting=== *In keeping with this season's theme of going \\"back to the beginning\\", in the shot right before the opening credits Buffy greets Rona by saying \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\", which is the same as the title of the first episode of the series. ===Arc significance=== * The Turok-Han is killed by Buffy. * Spike is rescued from the First's cave, though he has not overcome the behavioral trigger. * Xander is shown sleeping on the couch at Buffy's house, completing the Scooby Gang's migration to Buffy's house. * It is revealed exactly why the First has decided to mount an attack on the slayer line. It is explained by the Beljoxa's Eye that The First exploited a weakness in the Slayer line that was created when Buffy died at the end of season 5, and was subsequently resurrected. * Kennedy is intrigued by Willow's use of magic. She will continue to try to coax her into using her powers more throughout the series. Willow tells her that the dark magic in her is something Kennedy doesn't want to see. This will come to light in the episode \\"Get It Done\\", which will strain their relationship for a little while. * The barrier Willow uses to stop the Turok-Han from entering Buffy's house is the same barrier she used in Season 5's episode 'Spiral'. ===Cultural references=== *Andrew claims Dawn has a Licence to Kill, and then goes on to discuss Timothy Dalton's era as James Bond. *Andrew states that he is \\"Bored. Episode one bored,\\" referring to the fan disappointment of the Star Wars: Episode I film. *Andrew asks Dawn if she wants \\"to play Kevin Bacon\\", a reference to the game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. *Before the final fight with the Turok-Han, Buffy says \\"Welcome to Thunderdome.\\" and Andrew continues \\"Two men enter, one man leaves\\", a reference to Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome. *After defeating the Turok-Han, Buffy says \\"Here endeth the lesson.\\" She is directly referencing Spike from the episode \\"Fool for Love\\" in season 5. In that episode, Spike taught Buffy how he killed two slayers. At the very end of his teachings he stated \\"Here endeth the lesson.\\" In the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, \\"Here endeth the lesson\\" is announced at the conclusion of each reading of biblical passages during the Order for Daily Morning Prayer. The English poetry-writing Spike would be well acquainted with Anglican canonical forms. The Master also says this in the episode \\"Never Kill a Boy on the First Date\\" after he reads about The Anointed One and throwing a vampire into a coffin. ==Cited texts== * ==External links== * * Category:2003 American television episodes Category:Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 7) episodes Category:Television episodes written by David Fury ","title":"Showtime (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)"},{"id":"2227981","text":"Riohacha (), Rio Hacha or Rio de la Hacha ( - Wayuu: S√ºchiimma, \\"S√ºchii\\" means river, and \\"mma\\" means land, Riverland), is a city in the Riohacha Municipality in the northern Caribbean Region of Colombia by the mouth of the Rancher√≠a River and the Caribbean Sea. It is the capital city of the La Guajira Department. It has a sandy beach waterfront. Founded by conquistador Nikolaus Federmann in 1535, Riohacha was named after a local legend, \\"The legend of the Axe\\". Because of the powerful rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, the area is mostly desertic. It is inhabited primarily by Amerindians, predominantly the Wayuu ethnic group. During colonial times, Riohacha was a very important port, as divers could retrieve vast numbers of pearls from the harbor. In the second half of the 20th century, the city developed as one of Colombia's medium important, maritime commercial ports. It is also a multicultural center for La Guajira Department. The city is mentioned several times in novels written by Colombian writer Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature. Among his important works are One Hundred Years of Solitude, Love in the Time of Cholera, and Chronicle of a Death Foretold. ==History== Cathedral of Riohacha The Riohacha area was long inhabited by American Indians of the Wayuu culture, part of the larger Arawak group. The first European to visit the area was the Spanish sailor Alonso de Ojeda in 1498, though he never landed. A short time later, Juan de la Cosa, another Spanish explorer, landed on what is today called Cabo de la Vela (Cape of the Sail, so called because of its shape). In 1535, the German explorer Nikolaus Federmann founded a city with the name Nuestra Se√±ora Santa Maria de los Remedios del Cabo de la Vela (Our Lady Saint Mary of the Remedies of the Cape of the Sail) at the place where de la Cosa had landed. The Spanish discovered a vast amount of pearls in the city's area. This treasure frequently attracted raids by pirates. After the city was destroyed by a pirate raid, the city government relocated the city to the mouth of the Rancher√≠a River, in order to confuse the pirates, and to give the city time to rebuild before the next attack. The new city, named Nuestra Se√±ora de los Remedios del R√≠o de la Hacha (Our Lady of the Remedies), expanded peacefully for a short time in its new location. Pirate attacks soon resumed. The next major attack, led by the famous English pirate Francis Drake, took place in 1569, when Drake pillaged the city searching for gold and pearls. In the 18th century, Riohacha was incorporated to the Viceroyalty of New Granada as part of the province of Santa Marta. During the battles for independence from Spain, the port of Riohacha served many vessels fighting for Colombian and Venezuelan independence. Many Riohachans also served in the revolutionary navy, most notably Admiral Jos√© Prudencio Padilla, who would come to be considered a hero in the revolutions of Colombia and Venezuela. In 1954, Riohacha City acquired municipality status, and in 1964 was declared capital of the new La Guajira Department.

The last day celebrates the creation of the Department of La Guajira. National System for Cultural Information: National Festival of the Dividivi ==Transportation== Riohacha has one airport, the Almirante Padilla Airport. It serves airlines covering the route to and from the Colombian capital city Bogot√°, the near cities of Valledupar and Santa Marta, and the Caribbean resort island of Aruba. In September 2016 the low- cost carrier Easy Fly initiated service between Riohacha and Barranquilla. ==Climate== Riohacha, owing to the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, has a semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen BSh), which owing to the extremely torrid temperatures is not that far above an arid climate despite receiving as much as of rainfall per year. This rain falls almost exclusively in May and between August and November, and for the rest of the year there are a mere thirteen wet days out of 212 in an average year. Despite the lack of rainfall, humidity is high year round and adds to the uncomfortable heat. ==Notable People== *Luis Antonio Robles Su√°rez, first Afro-Colombian lawyer and politician. ==Gallery== File:Riohachacity.jpgView of the beachfront File:Colombia-riohacha001.JPGMalecon Beach File:Colombie- riohacha003.jpgTypical building File:Colombie-riohacha004.jpgColombian Wayuu craft on Avenida Primera (1st Ave.) File:Colombie-riohacha005.jpgRiohacha's Touristic Dock File:Riohacha.jpgRiohacha's Sunrise at a house roof File:Rancher√≠a River Mouth in Riohacha.jpgRancher√≠a River empties into Riohacha File:Convento de los padres capuchinos, Riohacha Colombia.pngCa√±ones Park File:Riohacha Carrera 6.jpgOne of the areas of the historic center of the city File:Riohacha artesania.JPGIdentidad Monument, eriged in 2010 File:Centro Cultural Riohacha (Visto desde la playa) - panoramio.jpgDepartmental Cultural Center seen from the beach File:Antigua Aduana y Actual Secretar√≠a de Cultura de Riohacha.jpgLate Nineteen Century Building in Riohacha File:Casa M√°rquez Iguar√°n en Riohacha.jpgHouse where Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez was conceived, according to his autobiography Living to Tell the Tale (2002) File:Interior de la Universidad de La Guajira.jpgLa Guajira University, located in Riohacha File:Alijuna y Way√∫.jpgFishing between Alijuna and Way√∫ Caribbean coast, Riohacha ==References * Gobernacion de La Guajira - Riohacha * Riohacha official website Category:Port cities in the Caribbean Category:Municipalities of La Guajira Department Category:Capitals of Colombian departments Category:1535 establishments in the Spanish Empire Category:Populated places established in 1535 ","title":"Riohacha"},{"id":"2227982","text":"Looking Glass servers are computers on the Internet running one of a variety of publicly available Looking Glass software implementations.

The fundamental frequency of this sound is usually double of fundamental 50 Hz or 60 Hz, 100 Hz or 120 Hz depending on the local power-line frequency. The sound often has heavy harmonic content above 50‚Äì60 Hz. Because of the presence of mains current in mains-powered audio equipment as well as ubiquitous AC electromagnetic fields from nearby appliances and wiring, 50/60 Hz electrical noise can get into audio systems, and is heard as mains hum from their speakers. Mains hum may also be heard coming from powerful electric power grid equipment such as utility transformers, caused by mechanical vibrations induced by magnetostriction in magnetic core. Onboard aircraft (or spacecraft) the frequency heard is often higher pitched, due to the use of 400 Hz AC power in these settings because 400 Hz transformers are much smaller and lighter. == Causes == Electric hum around transformers is caused by stray magnetic fields causing the enclosure and accessories to vibrate. Magnetostriction is a second source of vibration, in which the core iron changes shape minutely when exposed to magnetic fields. The intensity of the fields, and thus the \\"hum\\" intensity, is a function of the applied voltage. Because the magnetic flux density is strongest twice every electrical cycle, the fundamental \\"hum\\" frequency will be twice the electrical frequency. Additional harmonics above 100 Hz or 120 Hz will be caused by the non-linear behavior of most common magnetic materials. Around high-voltage power lines, hum may be produced by corona discharge. In the realm of sound reinforcement (as in public address systems and loudspeakers), electric hum is often caused by induction. This hum is generated by oscillating electric currents induced in sensitive (high gain or high impedance) audio circuitry by the alternating electromagnetic fields emanating from nearby mains-powered devices like power transformers. The audible aspect of this sort of electric hum is produced by amplifiers and loudspeakers. The other major source of hum in audio equipment is shared impedances; when a heavy current is flowing through a conductor (a ground trace) that a small-signal device is also connected to. All practical conductors will have a finite, if small, resistance, and the small resistance present means that devices using different points on the conductor as a ground reference will be at slightly different potentials. This hum is usually at the second harmonic of the power line frequency (100 Hz or 120 Hz), since the heavy ground currents are from AC to DC power supplies that rectify the mains waveform. See also ground loop. In vacuum tube equipment, one potential source of hum is current leakage between the heaters and cathodes of the tubes. Another source is direct emission of electrons from the heater, or magnetic fields produced by the heater. Tubes for critical applications may have the heater circuit powered by direct current to prevent this source of hum.Robert B. Tomer, Getting the most out of vacuum tubes, Howard W. Sams, Indianapolis, USA 1960, Library of Congress card no. 60-13843, available on the Internet Archive. Chapter 3 Leakage of analogue video signals can give rise to hum sounding very similar to mains hum. == Prevention == It is often the case that electric hum at a venue is picked up via a ground loop. In this situation, an amplifier and a mixing desk are typically at some distance from one another. The chassis of each item is grounded via the mains earth pin, and is also connected along a different pathway via the conductor of a shielded cable. As these two pathways do not run alongside each other, an electrical circuit in the shape of a loop is formed. The same situation occurs between musical instrument amplifiers on stage and the mixing desk. To fix this, stage equipment often has a \\"ground lift\\" switch which breaks the loop. Another solution is to connect the source and destination through a 1:1 isolation transformer, called variously audio humbucker or iso coil. Another extremely dangerous option is to break contact with the ground wire by using an AC ground lift adapter or by breaking the earth pin off the power plug used at the mixing deck. Depending on the design and layout of the audio equipment, lethal voltages between the (now isolated) ground at the mixing desk and earth ground can then develop. Any contact between the AC line live terminals and the equipment chassis will energize all the cable shields and interconnected equipment. === Humbucking === Humbucking is a technique of introducing a small amount of line-frequency signal so as to cancel any hum introduced, or otherwise arrange to electrically cancel the effect of induced line frequency hum. Humbucking is a process in which \\"hum\\" that is causing objectionable artifacts, generally in audio or video systems, is reduced. In a humbucker electric guitar pickup or microphone, two coils are used instead of one; they are arranged in opposing polarity so that AC hum induced in the two coils will cancel, while still giving a signal for the movement of the guitar strings or diaphragm.Tom Hirst, Electric Guitar Construction, Hal Leonard Corporation, 2003 , page 126 In certain vacuum-tube radio receivers, a winding on the dynamic speaker field coil was connected in series with the power supply to help cancel any residual hum. Some other common applications of this process are: * Humbucking transformers or coils used in video systems. * Telephone (and other audio) system and computer communications wiring. == Tone == Assuming a tempered scale with A=440 Hz, a 60 Hz tone is almost exactly halfway between A‚ôØ (58.24 Hz) and B (61.68 Hz) two octaves below Middle C, and a 50 Hz tone is between G (49.04 Hz) and G‚ôØ (51.93 Hz) two octaves below Middle C, but slightly flatter than the quarter-tone. These notes are within the range of a 4-string bass guitar. Or consider this scenario: Suppose the 60 Hz tone is B two octaves below Middle C, A would be tuned to 427.63 Hz (widely used as the classical pitch in period instrument ensembles). And if G‚ôØ two octaves below Middle C is a 50 Hz tone, then A is set to 423.79 Hz. {  cellpadding=\\"2\\" style=\\"border:0px;\\" align=\\"center\\" - align=center   } == Consequences  In music === In musical instruments, hum is usually treated as a nuisance, and various electrical modifications are made to eliminate it. For instance, humbucker pickups on electric guitars are designed to reduce hum. Sometimes hum is used creatively, for example in dub and glitch music. === In audio systems === Power line hum can be alleviated using a band- stop filter. === In video systems === In analog video, mains hum can be seen as hum bars, (bands of slightly different brightness) scrolling vertically up the screen. Broadcast television frame rates are chosen to match the line frequency, to minimize the disturbance these bars cause to the picture. A hum bar can be caused by a ground loop in cables carrying analog video signals,John J. Fay, Encyclopedia of Security Management: Techniques and Technology, Butterworth-Heinemann, 1993, page 372 poor power supply smoothing, or magnetic interference with the cathode ray tube. === In forensics === Electrical network frequency (ENF) analysis is a forensic technique for validating audio recordings by comparing frequency changes in background mains hum in the recording with long-term high-precision historical records of mains frequency changes from a database. In effect the mains hum signal is treated as a time-dependent digital watermark that can be used to find when the recording was created, and to help to detect any edits in the sound recording.Cooper, A.J: , Conference paper, AES 33rd International Conference, USA (2008)Grigoras, C.: , International Journal of Speech Language and the Law, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 63-76 (2005)Mateusz Kajstura, Agata Trawinska, Jacek Hebenstreit.

Founded in 1936, Mit√∫ lies next to the Vaup√©s River at 180 meters above sea level. It is where the core of the services (transport and trade) are provided to the Vaup√©s Department. The Vaup√©s River serves as connecting link between Mit√∫ and nearby hamlets on the riverbanks, but there are no roads connecting the town to rest of the country. Accessible only by airplane, Mit√∫ is the most isolated Capital of Department in Colombia. ==History== The founding of Mit√∫ can be traced to the rivalry between Brazilians and Colombians exploiting rubber in the basins and ranges of the upper Guain√≠a and Apaporis rivers. By 1903 there was an intense activity exploiting rubber in the area around the Vaup√©s river using the local Indians, of the ethnic groups tucano and carijonas, as slaves. Mit√∫ was erected as a modest hamlet in October 1936 by Miguel Cuervo Araoz. The town served as a meeting point between different indigenous communities, in addition to being a center of rubber tree exploitation, fur trade and missionary center. Its main activity was the rubber trade for food, clothing and fuel. After being for a time a township, in 1963 Mit√∫ became the capital of the Vaup√©s Commissary (Comisaria). In 1974, it was made municipality and in 1991 it became the capital of the new created department.

The term is now used mostly in the history of philosophy and of psychology. One idea was thought to follow another in consciousness if it were associated by some principle. The three commonly asserted principles of association were similarity, contiguity, and contrast, numerous others had been added by the nineteenth century. By the end of the nineteenth century physiological psychology was so altering the approach to this subject that much of the older associationist theory was rejected. Everyday observation of the association of one idea or memory with another gives a face validity to the notion. In addition, the notion of association between ideas and behavior gave some early impetus to behaviorist thinking. The core ideas of associationist thinking recur in some recent thought on cognition, especially consciousness. ==Early theory== The associationist theory is anticipated in Plato's Phaedo, as part of the doctrine of anamnesis. The idea of Simmias is recalled by the picture of Simmias (similarity) and that of a friend by the sight of the lyre on which he played (contiguity). But Aristotle is credited with originating associationist thinking based on this passage: The passage is obscure, but it indicates the principles known as contiguity, similarity, and contrast. Similar principles are stated by Zeno the Stoic, by Epicurus (see Diogenes Laertius vii. ¬ß 52, x. ¬ß 32), and by St Augustine of Hippo (Confessions, x. c. 19). Aristotle's doctrine was expanded and illustrated during throughout the Middle Ages, and in some cases even into the 17th century. William Hamilton listed philosophical authorities who gave prominence to the general fact of mental association - the Spanish philosopher Ludovicus Vives (1492-1540) especially being exhaustive in his account of memory. In Thomas Hobbes's psychology much importance is assigned to what he called, variously, the succession, sequence, series, consequence, coherence, train of imaginations or thoughts in mental discourse. But not before David Hume is there an express question as to what are the distinct principles of association. John Locke had, meanwhile, introduced the phrase \\"association of ideas\\" as the title of a supplementary chapter incorporated with the fourth edition of his Essay, though with little or no suggestion of its general psychological import. Hume reduced the principles of association to three: similarity, contiguity in time and place, and cause and/or effect. Dugald Stewart suggested resemblance, contrariety, and vicinity in time and place, though he added, as another obvious principle, accidental coincidence in the sounds of words, and further noted three other cases of relation: cause and effect, means and end, and premise and conclusion, as connecting trains of thought under circumstances of special attention. Thomas Reid, made light of association, remarking that it seems to require only the power of habit to explain the spontaneous recurrence of trains of thinking, which become familiar by frequent repetition (Intellectual Powers, p. 387). Hamilton's own theory of mental reproduction, suggestion, or association is a development of his ideas in Lectures on Metaphysics (vol. ii. p. 223, seq.), which reduced the principles of association to simultaneity and affinity, and these further to one supreme principle of Redintegration or totality. In the final scheme he sets out four general laws of mental succession: *(1) Associability or possible co-suggestion (all thoughts of the same mental subject are associable or capable of suggesting each other); *(2) Repetition or direct remembrance (thoughts identical in a modification, but differing in time, tend to suggest each other); *(3) Redintegration, indirect remembrance or reminiscence (thoughts once identical in time, but different as mental modes, are suggestive of each other in the order they originally held); *(4) Preference (thoughts are suggested not merely by the general subjective relation subsisting between them, they are also suggested in proportion to the amount of interest they hold to the individual mind). These special laws logically follow from the general laws above: *A - Primary - modes of the laws of Repetition and Redintegration: **(1) law of Similars (Analogy, Affinity); **(2) law of Contrast; and **(3) law of Coadjacency (Cause and Effect, etc.). *B - Secondary - modes of the law of Preference, under the law of Possibility: **(1) laws of Immediacy and Homogeneity and **(2) law of Facility. ==The Associationist School== The \\"Associationist School\\" includes the English psychologists who aimed at explaining all mental acquisitions and the more complex mental processes generally under laws under the associations which their predecessors applied only to simple reproduction. Hamilton, though professing to deal with reproduction only, formulates a number of still more general laws of mental succession: law of Succession, law of Variation, law of Dependence, law of Relativity or Integration (involving law of Conditioned), and, finally, law of Intrinsic or Objective Relativity. These he posits as the highest to which human consciousness is subject, but it is in a sense quite different that the psychologists of the Associationist School intend their appropriation of the principle or principles commonly signalized. In this regard, as far as can be judged from imperfect records, they were anticipated to some extent by the experientialists of ancient times, both Stoic and Epicurean (cf. Diogenes Laertius, as above). In the period that led to modern philosophy, Hobbes was the first thinker of permanent note to whom this doctrine may be traced. Although he took a narrow view of the phenomena of mental succession, he (after dealing with trains of imagination or \\"mental discourse\\") sought in the higher departments of intellect to explain reasoning as a discourse in words, dependent upon an arbitrary system of marks, each associated with or standing for a variety of imaginations. Except for a general assertion that reasoning is a reckoning (otherwise, a compounding and resolving), he had no other account of knowledge to give. The whole emotional side of mind (\\"the passions\\") he similarly resolved into an expectation of consequences based on past experience of pleasures and pains of sense. Thus, though he made no serious attempt to justify his analysis in detail, he is undoubtedly to be classed with the associationists of the next century. They, however, were wont to trace their psychological theory no further back than to Locke's Essay. Bishop Berkeley was driven to posit expressly a principle of suggestion or association in these terms: > \\"That one idea may suggest another to the mind, it will suffice that they > have been observed to go together, without any demonstration of the > necessity of their coexistence, or so much as knowing what it is that makes > them so to coexist.\\" (New Theory of Vision, ¬ß 25) and, to support the obvious application of the principle to the case of the sensations of sight and touch before him, he constantly urged that association of sound and sense of language which the later school has always put in the foreground, whether as illustrating the principle in general or in explanation of the supreme importance of language for knowledge. It was natural, then, that Hume, coming after Berkeley and assuming Berkeley's results (though he reverted to the larger inquiry of Locke), should be more explicit in his reference to association. But Hume was original also, when he spoke of it as a \\"kind of attraction which in the mental world will be found to have as extraordinary effects as in the natural, and to show itself in as many and as various forms.\\" (Human Nature, i. 1, ¬ß 4) Other inquirers about the same time conceived of association with this breadth of view, and set themselves to track, as psychologists, its effects in detail. ===David Hartley=== David Hartley is the thinker most precisely identified with the Associationist School. In his Observations on Man, published in 1749 (11 years after Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature and one year after the better known An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding), opened the path for all the investigations of like nature that have been so characteristic of English psychology. A physician by profession, he sought to combine with an elaborate theory of mental association a minutely detailed hypothesis as to the corresponding action of the nervous system, based upon the suggestion of a vibratory motion within the nerves thrown out by Isaac Newton in the last paragraph of the Principia. So far, however, from promoting the acceptance of the psychological theory, this physical hypothesis proved to have rather the opposite effect, and it began to be dropped by Hartley's followers (as Joseph Priestley, in his abridged edition of the Observations, 1775) before it was seriously impugned from without. When it is studied in the original, and not taken upon the report of hostile critics, who would not, or could not understand it, no little importance must still be accorded to the first attempt, not seldom a curiously felicitous one, to carry through that parallelism of the physical and psychical, which since then has come to count for more and more in the science of mind. Nor should it be forgotten that Hartley himself, for all his paternal interest in the doctrine of vibrations, was careful to keep separate from its fortunes the cause of his other doctrine of mental association. Of this the point lay in no mere restatement, with new precision, of a principle of coherence among \\"ideas\\" (which were also called by Hartley \\"vestiges\\", \\"types\\" and \\"images\\"), but in its being taken as a clue by which to follow the progressive development of the mind's powers. Holding that mental states could be scientifically understood only as they were analysed, Hartley sought for a principle of synthesis to explain the complexity exhibited not only in trains of representative images, but alike in the most involved combinations of reasonings and (as Berkeley had seen) in the apparently simple phenomena of objective perception, as well as in the varied play of the emotions, or, again, in the manifold conscious adjustments of the motor system. One principle appeared to him sufficient for all, running, as enunciated for the simplest case, thus: > \\"Any sensations A, B, C, etc., by being associated with one another a > sufficient number of times, get such a power over the corresponding ideas a, > b, c, etc., that any one of the sensations A, when impressed alone, shall be > able to excite in the mind b, c, etc., the ideas of the rest.\\" To render the principle applicable in the cases where the associated elements are neither sensations nor simple ideas of sensations, Hartley's first care was to determine the conditions under which states other than these simplest ones have their rise in the mind, becoming the matter of ever higher and higher combinations. The principle itself supplied the key to the difficulty, when coupled with the notion, already implied in Berkeley's investigations, of a coalescence of simple ideas of sensation into one complex idea, which may cease to bear any obvious relation to its constituents. So far from being content, like Hobbes, to make a rough generalization to all mind from the phenomena of developed memory, as if these might be straightway assumed, Hartley made a point of referring them, in a subordinate place of their own, to his universal principle of mental synthesis. He expressly put forward the law of association, endued with such scope, as supplying what was wanting to Locke's doctrine in its more strictly psychological aspect, and thus marks by his work a distinct advance on the line of development of the experiential philosophy. ===Continuing reception=== The new doctrine received warm support from some, as William Law and Priestley, who both, like Hume and Hartley himself, took the principle of association as having the like import for the science of mind that gravitation had acquired for the science of matter. The principle began also, if not always with direct reference to Hartley, yet, doubtless, owing to his impressive advocacy of it, to be applied systematically in special directions, as by Abraham Tucker (1768) to morals, and by Archibald Alison (1790) to aesthetics. Thomas Brown (d. 1820) subjected anew to discussion the question of theory. Hardly less unjust to Hartley than Reid or Stewart had been, and forward to proclaim all that was different in his own position, Brown must yet be ranked with the associationists before and after him for the prominence he assigned to the associative principle in sensory perception (what he called \\"external affections of mind\\"), and for his reference of all other mental states (\\"internal affections\\") to the two generic capacities or susceptibilities of Simple and Relative Suggestion. He preferred the word \\"suggestion\\" to \\"association\\", which seemed to him to imply some prior connecting process, for which there was no evidence in many of the most important cases of suggestion, nor even, strictly speaking, in the case of contiguity in time where the term seemed least inapplicable. According to him, all that could be assumed was a general constitutional tendency of the mind to exist successively in states that have certain relations to each other, of itself only, and without any external cause or any influence previous to that operating at the moment of the suggestion. Brown's chief contribution to the general doctrine of mental association, besides what he did for the theory of perception, was, perhaps, his analysis of voluntary reminiscence and constructive imagination, faculties that appear at first sight to lie altogether beyond the explanatory range of the principle. In James Mill's Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind (1829), the principle, much as Hartley had conceived it, was carried out, with characteristic consequence, over the psychological field. With a much enlarged and more varied conception of association, Alexander Bain reexecuted the general psychological task, while Herbert Spencer revised the doctrine from the new point of view of the evolution hypothesis. John Stuart Mill made only occasional excursions into the region of psychology proper, but sought, in his System of Logic (1843), to determine the conditions of objective truth from the point of view of the associationist theory, and, thus or otherwise being drawn into general philosophical discussion, spread wider than any one before him its repute. ===French and German associationists and Kant=== The Associationist School was composed chiefly of British thinkers, but in France also it had distinguished representatives. Of these it will suffice to mention Condillac, who professed to explain all knowledge from the single principle of association (liaison) of ideas, operating through a previous association with signs, verbal or other. In Germany, before the time of Immanuel Kant, mental association was generally treated in the traditional manner, as by Christian Wolff. Kant's inquiry into the foundations of knowledge, agreeing in its general purport with Locke's, however it differed in its critical procedure, brought him face to face with the newer doctrine that had been grafted on Locke's philosophy. To account for the fact of synthesis in cognition, in express opposition to associationism, as represented by Hume, was, in truth, his prime object, starting, as he did, from the assumption that there was in knowledge that which no mere association of experiences could explain. To the extent, therefore, that his influence prevailed, all inquiries made by the English associationists were discounted in Germany. Notwithstanding, under the very shadow of his authority a corresponding, if not related, movement was initiated by Johann Friedrich Herbart. As peculiar and widely different from anything conceived by the associationists as Herbart's metaphysical opinions were, he was at one with them and at variance with Kant in assigning fundamental importance to the psychological investigation of the development of consciousness. Further, his conception of the laws determining the interaction and flow of mental presentations and representations, when taken in its bare psychological import, was essentially similar to theirs. In Friedrich Eduard Beneke's psychology also and in more recent inquiries conducted mainly by physiologists, mental association has been understood in its wider scope, as a general principle of explanation. ===Differences among versions of associationist thought=== The associationists differ among themselves in the statement of their principle and, when they adduce several principles, in their conception of the relative importance of these. * Hartley took account only of Contiguity, or the repetition of impressions synchronous or immediately successive. * The same is true of James Mill, though, incidentally, he made an express attempt to resolve the received principle of Similarity and, through this, the other principle of Contrast, into his fundamental law (the law of Frequency, as he sometimes called it, because upon frequency, in conjunction with vividness of impressions, the strength of association, in his view, depended). * In a sense of his own, Brown also, while accepting the common Aristotelian enumeration of principles, inclined to the opinion that \\"all suggestion may be found to depend on prior coexistence, or at least on such proximity as is itself very probably a modification of coexistence\\", provided account be taken of > :\\"the influence of emotions and other feelings that are very different from > ideas, as when an analogous object suggests an analogous object by the > influence of an emotion which each separately may have produced before, and > which is, therefore, common to both\\". * To the contrary effect, Spencer maintained that the fundamental law of all mental association is that presentations aggregate or cohere with their like in past experience, and that, besides this law, there is in strictness no other, all further phenomena of association being incidental. Thus in particular, he would have explained association by Contiguity as due to the circumstance of imperfect assimilation of the present to the past in consciousness. * Alexander Bain regarded Contiguity and Similarity logically, as perfectly distinct principles, though in actual psychological occurrence blending intimately with each other, contiguous trains being started by a first (it may be, implicit) representation through Similarity, while the express assimilation of present to past in consciousness is always, or tends to be, followed by the revival of what was presented in contiguity with that past. ===Inseparable association=== The highest philosophical interest, as distinguished from that which is more strictly psychological, attaches to the mode of mental association called Inseparable. The coalescence of mental states noted by Hartley, as it had been assumed by Berkeley, was farther formulated by James Mill in these terms: > \\"Some ideas are by frequency and strength of association so closely combined > that they cannot be separated; if one exists, the other exists along with it > in spite of whatever effort we make to disjoin them.\\" (Analysis of the Human > Mind, 2nd ed., vol. i, p. 93) John Stuart Mill's statement was more guarded and particular: > \\"When two phenomena have been very often experienced in conjunction, and > have not, in any single instance, occurred separately either in experience > or in thought, there is produced between them what has been called > inseparable, or, less correctly, indissoluble, association; by which is not > meant that the association must inevitably last to the end of life - that no > subsequent experience or process of thought can possibly avail to dissolve > it; but only that as long as no such experience or process of thought has > taken place, the association is irresistible; it is impossible for us to > think the one thing disjoined from the other.\\" (Examination of Hamilton's > Philosophy, 2nd ed., p. 191) It is chiefly by John Stuart Mill that the philosophical application of the principle has been made. The first and most obvious application is to so- called necessary truths, those that are not merely analytic judgments but involve a synthesis of distinct notions. Again, the same thinker sought to prove Inseparable Association the ground of belief in an external objective world. The former application, especially, is facilitated, when the experience through which the association is supposed to be constituted is understood as cumulative in the race, and transmissible as original endowment to individuals - endowment that may be expressed either, subjectively, as latent intelligence or, objectively, as fixed nervous connexions. Spencer, as suggested before, is the author of this extended view of mental association. ==Criticism in the 19th century== In the later part of the 19th century the associationist theory was subjected to searching criticism, and it was maintained by many writers that the laws are both unsatisfactorily expressed and insufficient to explain the facts. Among the most vigorous and comprehensive of these investigations is that of F. H. Bradley in his Principles of Logic (1883). Having admitted the psychological fact of mental association, he attacks the theories of Mill and Bain primarily on the ground that they purport to give an account of mental life as a whole, a metaphysical doctrine of existence. According to this doctrine, mental activity is ultimately reducible to particular feelings, impressions, ideas, which are disparate and unconnected, until chance Association brings them together. On this assumption, the laws of Association naturally emerge in the following form: * The law of Contiguity :\\"Actions, sensations and states of feeling, occurring together or in close connection, tend to grow together, or cohere, in such a way that, when any one of them is afterwards presented to the mind, the others are apt to be brought up in idea.\\" (A. Bain, Senses and Intellect, p. 327) * The law of Similarity :\\"Present actions, sensation, thoughts or emotions tend to revive their like among previous impressions or states.\\" (A. Bain, Senses and Intellect, p. 457compare J. S. Mill, Logic, 9th ed., ii, p. 440) The fundamental objection to the law of Contiguity is that ideas and impressions, once experienced, do not recur; they are particular existences, and, as such, do not persevere to recur or be presented. So Mill is wrong in speaking of two impressions being \\"frequently experienced.\\" Bradley claims thus to reduce the law to :\\"When we have experienced (or even thought of) several pairs of impressions (simultaneous or successive), which pairs are like one another; then whenever an idea occurs which is like all the impressions on one side of these pairs, it tends to excite an idea which is like all the impressions on the other side.\\" This statement is destructive of the title of the law, because it appears that what were contiguous (the impressions) are not associated, and what are associated (the ideas) were not contiguous; in other words, the association is not due to contiguity at all. Proceeding to the law of Similarity (which in Mill's view is at the back of association by contiguity), and having made a similar criticism of its phrasing, Bradley maintains that it involves an even greater absurdity; if two ideas are to be recognized as similar, they must both be present in the mind; if one is to call up the other, one must be absent. To the obvious reply that the similarity is recognized ex post facto, and not while the former idea is being called up, Bradley replies simply that such a view reduces the law to the mere statement of a phenomenon and deprives it of any explanatory value, though he hardly makes it clear in what sense this necessarily invalidates the law from a psychological point of view. He further points out with greater force that in point of fact mere similarity is not the basis of ordinary cases of mental reproduction, inasmuch as in any given instance there is more difference than similarity between the ideas associated. Bradley himself bases association on identity plus contiguity: :\\"Any part of a single state of mind tends, if reproduced, to re-instate the remainder.\\" or :\\"Any element tends to reproduce those elements with which it has formed one state of mind.\\" This law he calls by the name \\"redintegration\\", understood, of course, in a sense different from that in which Hamilton used it. The radical difference between this law and those of Mill and Bain is that it deals not with particular units of thoughts but with universals or identity between individuals. In any example of such reproduction, the universal appears in a particular form which is more or less different from that in which it originally existed. ==Psychophysical researches== F. H. Bradley's discussion deals with the subject purely from the metaphysical side, and the total result practically is that association occurs only between universals. From the point of view of empirical psychologists Bradley's results are open to the charge which he made against those who impugned his view of the law of similarity, namely that they are merely a statement - not in any real sense an explanation. The relation between the mental and the physical phenomena of association has occupied the attention of all the leading psychologists (see Psychology). William James holds that association is of \\"objects\\" not of \\"ideas,\\" is between \\"things thought of\\" - so far as the word stands for an effect. \\"So far as it stands for a cause it is between processes in the brain.\\" Dealing with the law of Contiguity he says that the \\"most natural way of accounting for it is to conceive it as a result of the laws of habit in the nervous system; in other words to ascribe it to a physiological cause.\\" Association thus results because when a nerve current has once passed by a given way, it will pass more easily by that way in future; and this fact is a physical fact. He further seeks to maintain the important deduction that the only primary or ultimate law of association is that of neural habit. The objections to the associationist theory are summed up by George F. Stout (Analytic Psychol., vol. ii. pp. 47 seq.) under three heads. Of these the first is that the theory as stated, e.g., by Alexander Bain, lays far too much stress on the mere connexion of elements hitherto entirely separate; whereas, in fact, every new mental state or synthesis consists in the development or modification of a pre-existing state or psychic whole. Secondly, it is quite false to regard an association as merely an aggregate of disparate units; in fact, the form of the new idea is quite as important as the elements which it comprises. Thirdly, the phraseology used by the associationists seems to assume that the parts that go to form the whole retain their identity unimpaired; in fact, each part or element is ipso facto modified by the very fact of its entering into such combination. The experimental methods in vogue in the early part of the 20th century to a large extent removed the discussion of the whole subject of association of ideas, depending in the case of the older writers on introspection, into a new sphere. In such a work as Edward B. Titchener's Experimental Psychology (1905), association was treated as a branch of the study of mental reactions, of which association reactions are one division. Today the field is studied by neuroscientists and artificial intelligence researchers as well as philosophers and psychologists. == See also == *Association (psychology) *Associationism ==ReferencesSources== * ==Further reading== See the works of Bradley, Stout, and James, above quoted, and general works on psychology; articles in Mind (passim); *A.

In 1934 the town was renamed after Pedro Maria Carre√±o, the Colombian Minister of External Relations from 1912 to 1913.\\"Relaci√≥n cronol√≥gica de Ministros de Relaciones Exteriores Colombia\\" Ministerios de Relaciones Exteriores, Colombia (\\"Chronological list of the Ministers of External Relations, Colombia\\" Ministry of External Relations, Colombia) The \\"municipio\\" (similar to county in the U.S.) was created in 1974.Decree #1594 of 5 August 1974 On July 5, 1991, Vichada's status was updated to \\"departamento\\" under the Colombian Constitution and Puerto Carre√±o was ratified as its capital. The DANE (Colombian government's bureau for statistics) projected Puerto Carre√±o's municipal population to be around 10,034 for 2005, based on the 1993 Census. There are some Indigenous tribes within Puerto Carre√±o's administrative zone as well. ==Geography== The municipality of Puerto Carre√±o is located on the extreme northeastern part of the Department of Vichada bordering to the north and east with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela using the Meta and Orinoco rivers as borders. To the south Puerto Carre√±o limits with the municipality of Cumaribo and to the west with the municipality of La Primavera. Puerto Carre√±o: Geography The area of the municipality is uniformly flat, although there is a very slight rise at the town which gave it its original name. The climate is hot and dry, with a heavy rain season from April through October averaging a temperature of 28 ¬∞C. The area of the municipality is within the Llanos plains which covers areas in Colombia and Venezuela. Geologically the municipality of Puerto Carre√±o lies on the Guiana Shield mostly made up by cenozoic and precambric formations, with some low altitude mountains such as the Mounts of Casuarito and the Hormiga and Guaripa mountains. ==Climate== Puerto Carre√±o has a tropical monsoon climate (Am) with hot, dry winters and warm, wet summers. {{Weather box location = Puerto Carre√±o single line = Yes metric first = Yes Jan high C = 34.6 Feb high C = 35.8 Mar high C = 36.2 Apr high C = 34.7 May high C = 32.6 Jun high C = 31.3 Jul high C = 30.9 Aug high C = 31.3 Sep high C = 32.1 Oct high C = 32.8 Nov high C = 33.4 Dec high C = 33.7 year high C = Jan mean C = 28.7 Feb mean C = 29.5 Mar mean C = 30.1 Apr mean C = 29.5 May mean C = 28.1 Jun mean C = 27.2 Jul mean C = 26.8 Aug mean C = 27.0 Sep mean C = 27.7 Oct mean C = 28.2 Nov mean C = 28.5 Dec mean C = 28.3 year mean C = Jan low C = 22.8 Feb low C = 23.3 Mar low C = 24.1 Apr low C = 24.3 May low C = 23.7 Jun low C = 23.1 Jul low C = 22.8 Aug low C = 22.8 Sep low C = 23.3 Oct low C = 23.6 Nov low C = 23.6 Dec low C = 23.0 year low C = rain colour = green Jan rain mm = 11.1 Feb rain mm = 17.0 Mar rain mm = 45.4 Apr rain mm = 156.1 May rain mm = 285.3 Jun rain mm = 466.3 Jul rain mm = 487.9 Aug rain mm = 340.9 Sep rain mm = 208.5 Oct rain mm = 167.5 Nov rain mm = 108.8 Dec rain mm = 33.8 year rain mm = Jan rain days = 2 Feb rain days = 3 Mar rain days = 5 Apr rain days = 13 May rain days = 21 Jun rain days = 25 Jul rain days = 26 Aug rain days = 24 Sep rain days = 19 Oct rain days = 17 Nov rain days = 11 Dec rain days = 5 Year rain days = Jan humidity = 62 Feb humidity = 58 Mar humidity = 58 Apr humidity = 67 May humidity = 76 Jun humidity = 80 Jul humidity = 80 Aug humidity = 79 Sep humidity = 77 Oct humidity = 75 Nov humidity = 73 Dec humidity = 68 year humidity = Jan sun = 260.4 Feb sun = 231.5 Mar sun = 223.2 Apr sun = 171.0 May sun = 142.6 Jun sun = 126.0 Jul sun = 139.5 Aug sun = 148.8 Sep sun = 162.0 Oct sun = 195.3 Nov sun = 207.0 Dec sun = 238.7 year sun = Jand sun = 8.4 Febd sun = 8.2 Mard sun = 7.2 Aprd sun = 5.7 Mayd sun = 4.6 Jund sun = 4.2 Juld sun = 4.5 Augd sun = 4.8 Sepd sun = 5.4 Octd sun = 6.3 Novd sun = 6.9 Decd sun = 7.7 yeard sun = source 1 = IDEAM ==Economy== Economic activity is based on agricultural and ranching activities, fishing, and mining.

Ralph Maybank (August 17, 1890 ‚Äì March 19, 1965) was a politician from Manitoba, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1932 to 1935, and in the House of Commons of Canada from 1935 to 1951. Maybank was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. The son of John Maybank and Marion Bates, Maybank was born in London, Ontario. He served in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. He was educated at the University of Manitoba, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree (1919) and a law degree (1922). He was called to the Manitoba bar in 1923. In 1927, Maybank married Dora Boys. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1927, in the Winnipeg constituency. At the time, Winnipeg elected ten members via a single transferable ballot. Maybank, running as a Liberal, finished seventeenth on the first count and was not elected. From 1929 to 1931, Maybank served as a member of Winnipeg city council. In 1932, the governing Progressive Party of Manitoba formed an electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, and government members subsequently became known as Liberal- Progressives. Maybank again ran in Manitoba, finished tenth on the first count, and narrowly won election for the final seat. On the final count, he defeated Leslie Morris by 309 votes for tenth place. Had Morris been elected, he would have been the first Communist to serve in a provincial legislature in Canada. For the next three years, Maybank served as a backbench supporter of John Bracken's government. He resigned his seat on October 1, 1935, to run for the Canadian House of Commons in the 1935 federal election. He elected for the riding of Winnipeg South Centre, defeated Conservative candidate William Walker Kennedy and Cooperative Commonwealth Federation candidate Stanley Knowles. The Liberal Party won this election, and Maybank served as a backbench supporter of William Lyon Mackenzie King's government. Maybank defeated Kennedy a second time in the 1940 election, and defeated future Manitoba Cooperative Commonwealth Federation leader Lloyd Stinson by 3,996 votes in the 1945 election. On November 30, 1947, he was promoted to parliamentary assistant to the Minister of National Health and Welfare. On January 25, 1949, he was named assistant to the Minister of Mines and Resources. Maybank defeated Progressive Conservative Gordon Churchill in the 1949 federal election. On January 24, 1951, he was named parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Resources and Development. He resigned his seat on March 30, 1951. In the 1940s, Maybank led a revolt of Liberal Members of Parliament from western Canada against a proposed rise in the cross-border tariff. They were successful, and the tariff increase was set aside. In July 1951, he was named to the Manitoba Court of King's Bench. He died in Winnipeg while still a judge. There is currently a Ralph Maybank School in Winnipeg, and the surrounding area is known as Maybank. Maybank had three sons: John (deceased), Roger, and Micky (deceased). == References == Category:1890 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Judges in Manitoba Category:Liberal Party of Canada MPs Category:Manitoba Liberal Party MLAs Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from Manitoba Category:Politicians from London, Ontario Category:Winnipeg city councillors ","title":"Ralph Maybank"},{"id":"2228039","text":"Trouble is the first studio album from British hard rock band Whitesnake, led by former Deep Purple vocalist David Coverdale.

The company began making cars in 1919 and diversified into light commercial vehicles in 1924. For a few years in the early 1920s Bean outsold Austin and Morris. Bean suffered financial difficulties and the steel-maker Hadfields Limited took it over in 1926. The launch of an under-developed new model in 1928 worsened sales, and the company stopped making cars in 1929. Hadfields continued Bean commercial vehicle production as \\"Bean New Era\\" until June 1931. In 1933 Hadfield re-launched the company as Beans Industries, making components for other motor vehicle manufacturers. ==HistoryFoundation=== Absolom Harper founded the iron foundry A. Harper & Sons in Dudley in 1822. George Bean married Absolom's granddaughter and in 1901 became the company's principal shareholder. In 1907 George became company chairman and the name was changed to A. Harper & Sons & Bean. The company had been a supplier of car parts and in 1911 the company installed drop hammers to increase production and in 1912 the company opened a new forging plant in Smethwick. At the same time George Bean served as Mayor of Dudley in 1908, 1911 and 1912. In First World War Bean prospered from military contracts to supply shrapnel and shell cases to the government. The company's factories were expanded in order increase production. By 1916 Bean was making about 21,000 shells a week. After the war George Bean was knighted for his wartime service and his son Jack was made a CBE. After the war Bean needed a product to replace the gap left by the end of military contracts so Bean entered the increasingly active car market by becoming a car maker. The manufacturing rights for the pre-war Perry car were for sale so in January 1919 A. Harper & Sons & Bean bought them for ¬£15,000, giving it a quick entry into the car market. It set up a new factory in Hurst Lane, Coseley, to make the chassis, which were then driven to Dudley where the company's Waddams Pool works built the bodies. The first model had a 1795 cc four-cylinder engine linked to a separate three-speed gearbox. It was a revival of the pre-war Perry 11.9, and was rated at 11.9 RAC horsepower. The Bean 11.9 in chassis form initially cost ¬£400, but this was reduced to ¬£245. A four-seat open body was ¬£80. Production of the model peaked at 80 a week in 1922; about 10,000 were made in total.

The Times, Thursday, 27 November 1919; pg. 14; Issue 42268 Jack Harper Bean was managing director of the company and he visited America in order to buy the latest machinery for car-making. Bean became one of the first UK companies to adopt twin moving track assembly lines. Bean also wanted to form a consortium of manufacturers along the lines of the General Motors model. He brought together a group of companies including the vehicle makers Swift and Vulcan, the steel-maker Hadfields, and the Regent Carriage company and together they formed Harper Bean Limited in November 1919. Harper Bean Limited offered its shares for sale for which buyers would be required to pay ¬£6 million though only ¬£1.5 million would be offered to the public. The ¬£6 million proceeds would be used to buy: * 99 per cent of shares in A Harper Sons & Bean Limited of Dudley, Tipton and Smethwick * 166,666 shares in Hadfields Limited of Hecla Works, Sheffield to a value of ¬£250,000 * 60 per cent of the shares in The Vulcan Motor and Engineering Co Limited of Crossens Southport * 50 per cent of the ordinary shares in Swift of Coventry Limited, Cheylesmore Coventry * 50 per cent of the ordinary shares in British Motor Trading Corporation Limited (Motor Union Insurance‚ÄîAA) * 50 per cent of the ordinary shares in Harvey Frost Limited (of Great Portland Street, distributors of recovery cranes) together with Rushmores (1919) Limited, Jigs Limited, Regent Carriage Co Limited, Gallay Radiator Co Limited, Aeromotor Components Limited and Alex Mosses Radiator Co Limited Harper Bean Limited would carry on the business of ironfounders, metalworkers and manufacturers and distributors of motor vehicles.Directors were : H J Whitcomb of British Motor Trading (chairman) : J Harper Bean of A Harper Sons and Bean (managing director) : R Burns of Swift of Coventry : A B H Clerke of Hadfield‚Äôs : J E Hodgkin of Motor Union Insurance : C B Wordman of Vulcan Motor and Engineering : J A Wilding consulting engineer After investment in the above companies the balance of the new capital would be used to: : expand the plant of Harper Sons and Bean used for drop forgings, castings, stampings and kindred products and to extend the plant for the Bean car to 50,000 cars per annum : lay out a plant to produce another 50,000 complete engine and transmission units for Vulcan, Swift and other motor manufacturers : develop plant to produce Bean‚Äôs patented aluminium alloy body : increase Vulcan production from 500 to 10,000 motor vehicles per annum : increase Swift output to six times the current level Distribution was intended to be carried out through British Motor Trading which belonged to the Automobile Association's Motor Union InsuranceHarper Bean Limited.

The Times, Thursday, 27 November 1919; pg. 11; Issue 42268 Financial commentators noted the company's financial structure was \\"rather complicated\\".City Notes. The Times, Monday, 1 December 1919; pg. 22; Issue 42271 The new company wanted to emulate the success of the Ford Model T and exhibited its first car at the 1919 Motor Show. Its initial models were two- and four-seat tourers and coup√©s with prices starting from ¬£425. By early 1920 the company was making 80 chassis a week and Bean's Dudley plant could not produce enough bodies, so it ordered 2,000 bodies from Handley Page of Cricklewood. In 1920 2,000 Bean cars were made. But prices and wages soared and the car industry had entered recession. The Harper Bean conglomerate disbanded and the company ran up debts of ¬£475,000 to its suppliers. It stopped production in October 1920 and Jack Bean resigned from the company a month later. ===Revival=== In November 1921 Sir George Bean, Barclays Bank, the National Provincial Bank and Hadfields rescued the company with a huge sum by buying a controlling interest in A Harper, Sons & Bean and paid off its creditors. Production resumed early in 1922 and the company was making 100 cars a week by August. In October 1923 the company launched a new and much improved model, the Bean 14, with a 2.3-litre engine and a four-speed gearbox. About 4,000 of all the variants were made up to 1929. The car sold well, particularly in Australia. In 1924 the company launched a smaller Bean 12 and also began making light commercial vehicles. Also in 1924 Sir George Bean died aged 68 and was succeeded as chairman by Major Augustus Clerke who had previously been managing director of Hadfields. But A Harper, Sons & Bean was still short of money with debts of ¬£1.8 million, mainly as a result of its restructuring in 1921. Hadfields again rescued the company, The same models were made but there were changes in management with Jack Bean leaving the company and moving to another Wolverhampton manufacturer, Guy Motors. From 1922 Bean supplied engines for a light car, the Ariel Nine, which was made in Coventry. It was a water-cooled side-valve flat twin engine with \\"square\\" dimensions of 85 mm bore and 85 mm stroke, giving it 997 cc displacement. However, the engine was vibratory and noisy, so in 1924 Ariel discontinued the model. Bean launched a new model, the 18/50, with a 2.7-litre six-cylinder Meadows overhead valve engine. It was in production for only a year, in which time 500 were made. In chassis form it cost ¬£365. Some Bean factories were sold with production concentrated at its Tipton site. From 1927 all cars were branded Hadfield-Beans, and the 14 was updated to become the 2300 cc 14/40, still using the Bean engine. ===Bean commercial vehicles=== In November 1924, partly to maintain production volumes, Bean added a 20/25 cwt lorry to its range. It made commercial vehicles from then until 1931, concentrating on the lighter end of the market. The original truck was based on a Bean car, but in 1927 the company launched a larger model with a commercial chassis and a capacity of 30 cwt (about 1,500 kg). Unfortunately for Bean, Morris Commercial entered the market at the same time: intense competition drove most other competitors out of the UK market. Bean's finances suffered, despite ongoing funding from Hadfields. File:Bean Pick-up.JPG1926 Bean 14 HP pickup truck File:Bean New Era Commercial Vehicle.jpg1931 Bean New Era truck File:Bean bus.JPG1929 bus built by Birch Brothers of London on a Bean 30 cwt chassis ===Later years=== In 1927 Hadfields made a number of changes to the Bean range. Production of the Bean 12 ended with about 3,000 built in total. The Bean 14 became the Long 14, and a Short 14 was introduced. This was a Bean 12 chassis, powered by a 14 engine. Hadfields discontinued Long 14 in 1928. In 1928 Hadfield launched Hadfield-Bean 14/45, which severely damaged the company's reputation. It also offered a sporting variant, the 14/70. The new models were not properly tested and went on sale with a number of serious faults. This led to a significant drop in sales and Hadfields ended Bean car production in 1929. Commercial vehicle production continued until June 1931, when Bean stopped making vehicles and entered voluntary liquidation. Hadfields relaunched Bean in 1933 as Beans Industries to make castings for the motor industry. The company became profitable again and in 1937 Beans Industries became a public company. In World War Two the company made truck engines and parts. Standard-Triumph took over Bean in 1956 and became part of Leyland Motors in 1960. In the 1980s the Margaret Thatcher in her third ministry broke up British Leyland and in 1988 Bean was bought by its management team. The team also bought Reliant, which failed in 1995 and forced Bean into receivership. A German company, Eisenwerk Bruhl, bought the Tipton factory and renamed it as Bruhl (UK). The owners sold it to the directors and it became Ferrotech, which was a major supplier to Ford and Perkins Engines. The order book almost doubled in twelve months but appalling mismanagement led to increasing and unsustainable losses, the company was put in administration and as the administrators could not sell it as a going concern the factory ceased production in August 2005 and closed within six months. ==Record breakers== Francis Birtles' record-breaking Bean 14 HP Sundowner Australian adventurer Francis Birtles made a number of epic and record-breaking journeys in a two- seat Bean 14 HP called the Sundowner. In September 1926 Birtles and co-driver Alec Barlow drove it from Darwin to Melbourne. The next month they drove it back in a record eight and a half days. Then from October 1927 to July 1928 Birtles drove the car solo from London to Melbourne. The Coseley factory also made Captain George Eyston's world-land-speed-record car Thunderbolt, which took the record in 1937. ==Factories== The Dudley factory still exists as part of an unconnected private business. The Coseley factory made automotive parts supplier until Ferrotech was forced to close it in 2005. It was demolished three years later. The newer part of the factory site in Coseley / Tipton that was built in Bean's years as a parts supplier was sold and demolished in 2003‚Äì04, and the land redeveloped for housing within a few months. One of the streets on this new estate, Thunderbolt Way, is named after Eyston's record- breaking car. On moving to the Coseley site, Bean built a block of offices on Sedgley Road West on the Tipton side of the boundary with Coseley. Tipton Council bought them and opened them as their municipal offices on 7 March 1935, a use which lasted for the next 31 years until Tipton council was abolished and the bulk of the town was placed under control of West Bromwich Council. Dudley College used the building until 1993, since when it has since been used by a number of different ventures. The residential street Bean Road (Dudley DY2) has long existed within of the Dudley factory, while Bean Road (Coseley) gives access to the former Coseley factory site, and the nearby Bean Drive is a cul-de-sac off Thunderbolt Way in Tipton. Bean Drive is to the southeast. ==Main car models== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" align=\\"center\\" - ! efefef;\\"  Type ! efefef;\\"  Model ! efefef;\\"  Year ! efefef;\\"  Number made ! efefef;\\"  Engine ! efefef;\\"  Notes -  11.9  1 (1919‚Äì22), 2 (1923‚Äì24), 4 (1924‚Äì27)  1919‚Äì27  10,000  1796 cc four cylinder  Later called the 12 -  14  3 (later the Long 14), 6 (Short 14)  1924‚Äì28  4000 (all 14s)  2300 cc four-cylinder  Became the model 8 14/40 in 1928 -  18/50  7  1926‚Äì28  500  2692 cc Meadows six-cylinder  -  14/45  8  1928‚Äì29  see 14  2300 cc four-cylinder  Updated 14, branded as a Hadfield- Bean -  14/70  8  1928‚Äì29  see 14  2300 cc four-cylinder  Sports version of the 14/45 - } ==Survivors== A 1927 Bean 14 coup√© was in the Museum of Science and Industry, Birmingham until it closed in 1997.

The Black Country Living Museum has a 1926 20/25 HP truck as a static exhibit. The National Motor Museum, Beaulieu has a 1928 Short 14 car as a static exhibit. The Bredgar and Wormshill Light Railway in Kent has had a number of Bean vehicles, including a 1923 14 HP Open Tourer that is driven to historic vehicle events both in the UK and overseas. Francis Birtles' record-breaking Bean 14 Sundowner is in the National Museum of Australia. A number of Bean vehicles, most of them 12 HP and 14 HP cars, survive and are driven in private ownership. It is thought about 500 of the six cylindered 18-50 Beans were produced and today around 20 of those are thought to survive. Two are in the UK and a number in Australia. ==See also== * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom ==NotesReferences== George Eyston's Thunderbolt car ==External links== *Bean Car Club *Black Country History Category:1919 establishments in England Category:Companies based in Worcestershire Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of England Category:History of Dudley Category:Tipton Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1919 ","title":"Bean Cars"},{"id":"2228068","text":"Keflav√≠k √çF (Keflav√≠k, √≠√ær√≥tta- og ungmennaf√©lag) is an Icelandic sports club, from the town of Reykjanesb√¶r.

They currently play in √örvalsdeild kvenna and are the reigning national champions and cup champions. ==History== The history of Keflav√≠k √çF is considered to have begun in 1929. Its history has been convoluted, with several changes in name and status. ===Early years=== Keflav√≠k Youth Club (Ungmennaf√©lag Keflav√≠kur, UMFK) was founded on 29 September 1929 by 28 young people in the town of Keflav√≠k. The club became a member of The Icelandic Youth Federation which had been established in 1907 as part of Iceland's drive for independence. The Keflav√≠k Youth Club was a typical youth club of the era; forming teams in swimming and athletics, teaching physical education, putting on theatre productions and supporting various local causes. An important part of the Youth Federation was appreciation for the country and its people and the movement was especially active in rural areas and small towns. Helgi S. J√≥nsson: '20 √°ra afm√¶lisfagna√∞ur U.M.F.K.', Faxi 1949 (9:9‚Äì10), pp. 2‚Äì5 On 12 July 1950 a second sports club was founded in Keflav√≠k, the Keflav√≠k Football Club (Knattspyrnuf√©lag Keflav√≠kur, KFK). Despite its name, the club formed teams in football, handball and swimming. '√âg treysti √¶skunni til st√≥rr√¶√∞a √≠ framt√≠√∞inni : KFK 25 √°ra', Faxi 1976 (36:1), pp. 12‚Äì13 ===Sports federation=== With two major sports clubs in the small town of Keflav√≠k it was felt that resources were being spread too thin. On March 18, 1956 a new club was formed, Keflav√≠k Sports Federation (√ç√ær√≥ttabandalag Keflav√≠kur, √çBK). Similar sports federations were formed in towns around Iceland. The idea behind them was that various groups and clubs could come together to represent the town in various sports, often against other towns. Another aim was to enable sportsmen from smaller towns to compete against the bigger clubs from Reykjav√≠k, especially in football and other team sports. The town federations also represented the town's clubs within national associations. In Keflav√≠k the existing clubs were not disbanded but their operations were limited. Keflav√≠k Youth Club continued to work within the national youth movement, mainly on social and cultural issues. Sporting activities within the youth club and Keflav√≠k Football Club were virtually non-existent, although the youth club participated in the semi- annual national youth festival. The two clubs also played against each other in team sports like football and handball on special occasions in the town, like Independence Day. '√ç√ær√≥ttabandalag stofna√∞ √≠ Keflav√≠k', Faxi 1956 (16:3), p. 31 ===Modern era=== In 1994 the town of Keflav√≠k merged with its neighbouring towns of Njar√∞v√≠k and Hafnir to form a new municipality, Reykjanesb√¶r. A new sports federation was formed for the new town, Reykjanesb√¶r Sports Federation (√ç√ær√≥ttabandalag Reykjanesb√¶jar,√çRB). With the Keflav√≠k club no longer a sports federation it was decided to form a new club, Keflav√≠k Sports and Youth Club (Keflav√≠k, √≠√ær√≥tta- og ungmennaf√©lag), which was to be commonly known as Keflav√≠k. The youth in the title was to indicate that the club was a member of The Icelandic Youth Federation. The new club also became a member of The National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland (√ç√ær√≥tta- og √ìlymp√≠usamband √çslands, √çS√ç) and Reykjanesb√¶r Sports Federation. ==References *Keflav√≠k ‚Äì Official website *The National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland *The Icelandic Youth Federation *Reykjanesb√¶r Sports Federation Category:Football clubs in Iceland Category:Multi-sport clubs in Iceland Category:Keflav√≠k ","title":"Keflav√≠k √çF"},{"id":"2228069","text":": For the Western Canadian casual dining chain, see Cactus Club Cafe. The Cactus Club was a nightclub in the South of First Area (SoFA) of Downtown San Jose, California. It was one of the first clubs to replace some of the 'red light' businesses on South First Street (across the street was the Pussycat Theater which later became F/X). The Cactus Club took over The Bachelor Club and went on to become a legendary live music venue in San Jose for close to 15 years. The concept of The Cactus Club was created by Sean Galvin and Mike Trippett. It was Producer/Promoter Ric Hines who made the opening of the Cactus Club possible with his business experience and professional network. Hines recruited a local lawyer as a partner, Bob Cullen, whose nickname \\"Cactus Bob\\" was used to name the club. Mike's brother Calvin Trippett was brought in later as the booking agent for the club. The Cactus Club opened in 1988 and remained open until 2002. Emphasizing music, the club featured many local and national touring acts as well as themed dance nights. Among the San Francisco Bay Area bands that got some of their start from playing the Cactus Club are Smash Mouth, The Donnas, Papa Roach, Insolence, Green Day, Alien Ant Farm, Carbonation and The Odd Numbers. The Cactus is often noted as being one of the first clubs in the Bay Area to attempt an end of pay-to-play practices that Bay Area clubs had been doing for a long time. Major touring acts such as Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Korn, Queens of the Stone Age, Deftones, MC Hammer, Pigeon Project, Dropkick Murphys, Flogging Molly, Alanis Morissette, Mother Love Bone, Incubus, System of a Down, A Perfect Circle, Rage Against the Machine and Weezer have all played the Cactus Club. A famous story went around when Nirvana played to around 10 people at the club, and merely months later they were on top of the charts. The Red Hot Chili Peppers were among the first bands to play Cactus Club, playing January 16, 1988 with their original line-up. After closing in 2002, Cactus Club co-owner Craig Yamato opened a new nightclub in downtown San Jose called The Blank Club. ==References * The Blank Club Website Category:Nightclubs in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Culture of San Jose, California ","title":"Cactus Club"},{"id":"2228087","text":"Where's My Cow? is a picture book written by Terry Pratchett and illustrated by Melvyn Grant. It is based on a book that features in Pratchett's Discworld novel Thud!, in which Samuel Vimes reads it to his son. Where's My Cow? was released on 23 September 2005, to coincide with Thud!. The cover bears a gold sticker reading \\"OOK! The Ankh-Morpork Librarians' Award - Children's Winner\\". This looks slightly similar to the Carnegie Medal sticker on the paperback of The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents. The book is written as a children's picture book and tells the story of Sam Vimes reading the picture book Where's My Cow? to Young Sam. The book describes the search for a cow, in which various animals that are not cows are identified by the noise they make. Sam eventually decides that this is a daft way to look for a cow, and that Young Sam should, in any case, be getting taught about Ankh-Morpork rather than animals he will only see on a plate. He therefore attempts to rework the story into what he calls the 'Vimes street version', about a search for \\"daddy\\" through the city, encountering such characters as Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, Foul Ole Ron, and the Patrician. In Thud! we learn that the next day Young Sam said \\"Buglit!\\" (an attempt at Ron's distinctive \\"Buggrit!\\") and Sybil pointedly never raised the subject. Sam then stuck rigidly to the authorized version. In the framing story of Where's My Cow?, Young Sam also says \\"Buglit!\\" when Sybil comes upstairs to see what all the excitement is. There are three art styles in the book, all drawn by Melvyn Grant. The first art style is a fairly realistic style, with a slight cartoony feel. This is used for Vimes relating the story to Young Sam. The second style is that of the book within the book, which is simple, with thick lines and pastel colours. The pictures of Vimes and Young Sam are in front of these pictures, and do not interact with them. The third style occurs when Vimes starts changing the story. The Discworld characters are drawn in the same style as Vimes and Young Sam, but the pastel animals are still present, and all three settings (the world of Where's My Cow?, the streets of Ankh-Morpork, and Young Sam's nursery) begin blurring together. The objects in Young Sam's nursery also become animated. This quite possibly represents Young Sam's imagination. The illustration of the nursery contains as an Easter egg a painting of the author himself, Terry Pratchett. Also of note is that the various other animals, which are mistaken for cows, are drawn in such a way that their outlines, combined with their surroundings, forms a cow shape. For example, the sheep has a tree's branches for horns and a rabbit chewing greenery for an udder, the horse has a pitchfork for horns and a chicken for an udder, etc. In this book Vimes bears a passing resemblance to actor Pete Postlethwaite. Pratchett has previously commented that this is who he has always perceived Vimes as looking like, rather than Paul Kidby's 'Clint Eastwood' representation.The Art of Discworld, Terry Pratchett & Paul Kidby, The book has played a cameo at the end of Wintersmith, being read by the character Rob Anybody. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * * ==External links== * Category:Discworld books Category:Doubleday (publisher) books Category:2005 children's books Category:Cattle in literature ","title":"Where's My Cow?"},{"id":"2228091","text":"Iovan Tsaous (, from the Turkish word √ßavu≈ü, meaning \\"sergeant\\") (1893‚Äì1942), was a Greek musician and composer of rebetiko songs from Pontus. His real name was Yiannis Eitziridis or Etseiridis (ŒìŒπŒ¨ŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÇ ŒïœäœÑŒ∂ŒπœÅŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ or ŒïœÑœÉŒµŒπœÅŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ). ==Biography== Tsaous was born in 1893 in Kastamonu on Turkey's Black Sea coast. As a citizen of the Ottoman Empire, he completed his military service in the Ottoman army, attaining the rank of sergeant.Yovan is a Slavic form (adopted also by the Turks) of the Greek name Yiannis and √ßavu≈ü is the Turkish word for sergeant. After the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922), he came to Greece as a refugee and settled in Piraeus. He worked initially as a tailor for some years, before opening an ouzeri. He and his wife died in 1942 of food poisoning during the famine caused by the Nazi-Fascist occupation during WWII. Much of the information on his life comes from descendants of his sister-in- law. ==Instruments== Yovan Tsaous is particularly noted for the unique instruments he played.A detailed illustrated analysis of the construction and fretting of these instruments, and of Tsaous' discography, is to be found in Kourousis, Stavros From Tambouras to Bouzouki - The History and Evolution of the Bouzouki and its first Recordings (1926-1932) Orpheum Phonograph ORPH-01 (2013) They were custom-built for him in Piraeus by the luthier Kyriakos Peismatoglou, and differed in one important respect from other plucked long- necked lutes in use in Greece at this time, in that they were not fretted according to the equal temperament division of the octave into twelve identical semitones. Instead theyAt least the two surviving instruments, the sazi and the baglamas. had sixteen frets to the octave, which permitted, among other things, the playing of microtonally different intervals such as the so- called three-quarter tone, and the neutral third, at certain positions on the fretboard. We know of at least three instruments, of which two have survived to the present day. The smallest was called baglamas although it did not resemble the instrument known by that name in the rebetiko context, being considerably larger, and in fact rather corresponding to what Greeks call tzour√°s. The next in size was called s√°zi, which had approximately the same vibrating string length as a bouzouki. Finally there was an instrument whose identity is still obscure. It is to be heard very clearly playing an introductory taxim to the song Diam√°nto alani√°ra (ŒîŒπŒ±ŒºŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâ Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒΩŒπŒ¨œÅŒ±), during which is to be heard the exclamation ŒìŒπŒ¨ œÉŒøœÖ ŒìŒπŒøŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩ Œ§œÉŒ±ŒøœçœÇ ŒºŒµ œÑŒø œÑŒ±ŒºœÄŒøœçœÅŒ∑ œÉŒøœç (approx: Hi there Yovan Tsaous with your tambouri).Pictures of the two surviving instruments, and an account of them in Greek, are to be found in the sleeve notes to the LP ŒìŒπŒøŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩ Œ§œÉŒ±ŒøœçœÇ AF97 (1988) published by the Falireas Bros. The LP contains twelve of Tsaous' recordings, including the one referred to here. What this tambouri actually was we may never know. It sounds as though it is a fretless instrument, with perhaps a parchment head rather than a soundboard of wood. It appears that Tsaous was almost alone in playing these particular instruments; the fact that they did not produce equally tempered intervals made them problematic in ensemble work, and this is readily audible in his recordings, which have a unique sound. He appears to have had at least one co-musician who played similarly tuned instruments, namely one G. Kik√≠dis (gr. Œì. ŒöŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ¥Œ∑œÇ) who is given as playing bouzouki on a record label, but whose instrument pitches exactly in parallel with Tsaous' baglamas and does not sound like a bouzouki. ==Works== Tsaous is to be heard on at least fifteen recordings made between 1936 and 1937. The first twelve songs listed below were his own compositions. These songs have a truly idiosyncratic character, and resemble no other songs of the period in their melodic language, their subtle use of metre, and their use of intervals unusual in contemporary recordings. A further two songs were credited to Panagiotis Tountas, one more to Giorgos Kamvisis. The first six were sung by Antonis Kalyvopoulos, the following eight by Stellakis, and the last by Roza Eskenazi. Tsaous was band leader on at least the first twelve songs. He played three different instruments on his recordings (see previous section), none of which was a bouzouki, although the record labels often mention bouzoukia. *P√©nte m√°nges ston Pir√©a (Œ†Œ≠ŒΩœÑŒµ ŒºŒ¨Œ≥Œ∫ŒµœÇ œÉœÑŒøŒΩ Œ†ŒµŒπœÅŒ±ŒØŒ±) ‚Äì Five manges in Piraeus *Iovan Tsaous (ŒìŒπŒøŒ≤Œ¨ŒΩ Œ§œÉŒ±ŒøœçœÇ) *Paraponio√∫nte i m√°nges (Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±œÄŒøŒΩŒπŒøœçŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ ŒøŒπ ŒºŒ¨Œ≥Œ∫ŒµœÇ) ‚Äì The manges are complaining *Kat√°dikos (ŒöŒ±œÑŒ¨Œ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ) ‚Äì Convict *I Eleni i zontochira (Œó ŒïŒªŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑ Œ∑ Œ∂œâŒΩœÑŒøœáŒÆœÅŒ±) ‚Äì 'leni the divorc√©e *O Prez√°kias (Œü œÄœÅŒµŒ∂Œ¨Œ∫ŒπŒ±œÇ) ‚Äì The Junkie *Vl√°missa (ŒíŒªŒ¨ŒºŒπœÉœÉŒ±) ‚Äì Girlfriend *Diam√°nto alani√°ra (ŒîŒπŒ±ŒºŒ¨ŒΩœÑœâ Œ±ŒªŒ±ŒΩŒπŒ¨œÅŒ±) ‚Äì Diamanto, tramp *Gelasm√©nos (ŒìŒµŒªŒ±œÉŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ) ‚Äì Fooled *M√°ngissa (ŒúŒ¨Œ≥Œ∫ŒπœÉœÉŒ±) ‚Äì M√°ngas girl *Se mia mikro√∫la (Œ£Œµ ŒºŒπŒ± ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅŒøœçŒªŒ±) ‚Äì To a little girl *Dros√°ti Pelop√≥nnisos (ŒîœÅŒøœÉŒ¨œÑŒ∑ Œ†ŒµŒªŒøœÄœåŒΩŒΩŒ∑œÉŒøœÇ) ‚Äì In the cool Peloponnese *Eg√≥ th√©lo pringip√©ssa (ŒïŒ≥œé Œ∏Œ≠Œªœâ œÄœÅŒπŒ≥Œ∫Œ∑œÄŒ≠œÉœÉŒ±) ‚Äì I want a princess (Panagiotis Tountas) *I Varv√°ra (Œó ŒíŒ±œÅŒ≤Œ¨œÅŒ±) (Toundas) ‚Äì Barbara (Panagiotis Tountas) *Yia na ks√©reis (ŒìŒπŒ¨ ŒΩŒ± ŒæŒ≠œÅŒµŒπœÇ) ‚Äì You ought to know (Giorgos Kamvisis) Tsaous' wife Katerina Charmoutzi (ŒöŒ±œÑŒµœÅŒØŒΩŒ± ŒßŒ±œÅŒºŒøœÖœÑŒ∂ŒÆ) was probably involved in writing the lyrics of Tsaous' songs. ==Notes * *https://web.archive.org/web/20050226122904/http://www.rembetiko.gr/forum/messages/130/1438.html Category:1893 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Greek songwriters Category:Greek male singers Category:Pontic Greeks Category:Rebetiko musicians Category:Greek bouzouki players Category:Modern Greek-language singers Category:20th-century singers Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Iovan Tsaous"},{"id":"2228098","text":"CRISP may refer to: * Center for Research in Security and Privacy, largest research center for IT security in Europe * C-language Reduced Instruction Set Processor, an AT&T; microprocessor design * Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients, a health information exchange in Maryland, US * Computer Registration Involving Student Participation, online course registration system designed by Bernard Galler * Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects, a database of biomedical research projects funded by the U.S. government * Construction Research and Innovation Strategy Panel, a construction industry study group in the United Kingdom * Coral Reef Initiative for the South Pacific, a French inter-ministerial project founded in 2002 * Cross-industry standard process for data mining (CRISP-DM), a data mining process model * Cross Registry Information Service Protocol, an Internet standard for looking up information on domain names and network numbers * Cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISPs), a family of proteins important to mammalian reproduction and also found in various snake venoms ==See also== * Crisp (disambiguation) ","title":"CRISP"},{"id":"2228100","text":"The Arveyron is a left tributary to the river Arve, rising in the famous Mer de Glace just above Chamonix in south-eastern France.

They speak a dialect of the Oromo language that is distinct enough that it is difficult for other Oromo speakers to understand. The Borana people are notable for practicing Gadaa system without interruption. They are predominantly Traditional faith. ==Demography and language== Borana girls in Ethopia Between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries, the Oromo people had differentiated into two major confederations of pastoral tribes: the Borana and the Barentu, and several minor ones. The Barentu people thereafter expanded to the eastern regions now called Hararghe, Arsi, Wello and northeastern Shawa. The Borana people, empowered by their Gadda political and military organization expanded in the other directions, regions now called western Shawa, Welega, Illubabor, Kaffa, Gamu Goffa, Sidamo and thereafter into what is now northern Kenya regions. The Borana further subdivided into various subgroups such as Macha, Tulama, Sadacha and others.Asafa Jalata (2010), Oromo Peoplehood: Historical and Cultural Overview, Sociology, University of Tennessee Press, pages 5, 11-12 The Borana speak Borana (or afaan Booranaa), a dialect of Oromo language, which is part of the Cushitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic family of languages. In the border regions of Ethiopia-Kenya and southwestern Somalia, one estimate places about 1,094,000 people as Boranas. Another estimate in 2019 suggests 874,000 Boranas in Ethiopia, 210,000 in Kenya and 10,000 in Somalia. The Borana are the southernmost Horners of the Horn peninsula.Cossins, Noel J., and Martin Upton. \\"The Borana pastoral system of southern Ethiopia.\\" Agricultural Systems 25.3 (1987): 199-218. ==History== The Borana, Gabbra and Sakuye peoples are sub- ethnic groups within the Oromo people group, and share language and culture. Some groups from the Oromo people from southern Ethiopia entered northern Kenya during the 16th century. They then differentiated into the cattle- keeping Borana, while the Gabbra and Sakuye specialized in camel-keeping. They lived together, each with different pastoral focus. As competition for grazing lands and resources increased, conflicts emerged. ==SocietyGadaa=== The Oromo people were traditionally a culturally homogeneous society with genealogical ties. The Borana and other Oromo communities governed themselves in accordance with gadaa (literally \\"era\\"), a limited democratic socio- political system long before the 16th century, when major three party wars commenced between them and the Christian kingdom to their north and Islamic sultanates to their east and south. The Gadaa system elected males from five Oromo miseensa (groups), for a period of eight years, for various judicial, political, ritual and religious roles. Retirement was compulsory after the eight year term, and each major clan followed the same gadaa system. Women and people belonging to the lower Oromo castes were excluded., Quote: \\"gadaa government was a preclass institution based on democratic principles even though it did exclude caste groups such as smiths and tanners, and women (...)\\". Male born in the upper Oromo society went through five stages of eight years, where his life established his role and status for consideration to a gadaa office. Under gadaa, every eight years, the Oromo would choose by consensus an Abbaa Bokkuu responsible for justice, peace, judicial and ritual processes, an Abbaa Duulaa responsible as the war leader, an Abbaa Sa'aa responsible as the leader for cows, and other positions. ===Social stratification=== Like other ethnic groups in the Horn of Africa and East Africa, Borana Oromo people regionally developed social stratification consisting of four hierarchical strata. The highest strata were the nobles called the Borana, below them were the Gabbaro (some 17th to 19th century Ethiopian texts refer them as the dhalatta). Below these two upper castes were the despised castes of artisans, and at the lowest level were the slaves.J. Abbink (1985), Review: Oromo Religion.

Three of them are activators: E2F1, 2 and E2F3a. Six others act as suppressors: E2F3b, E2F4-8. All of them are involved in the cell cycle regulation and synthesis of DNA in mammalian cells. E2Fs as TFs bind to the TTTCCCGC (or slight variations of this sequence) consensus binding site in the target promoter sequence. ==E2F family== Schematic diagram of the amino acid sequences of E2F family members (N-terminus to the left, C-terminus to the right) highlighting the relative locations of functional domains within each member: {  - ! Family members ! Legend -  400px  * cyc A - Cyclin A binding domain * DNA - DNA-binding domain * DP1,2 - domain for dimerization with DP1, 2 * TA - transcriptional activation domain * PB - pocket protein binding domain } ==Genes== Homo sapiens E2F1 mRNA or E2F1 protein sequences from NCBI protein and nucleotide database. == Structure == X-ray crystallographic analysis has shown that the E2F family of transcription factors has a fold similar to the winged-helix DNA-binding motif. ==Role in the cell cycle== Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in apoptosis. E2F family members play a major role during the G1/S transition in mammalian and plant cell cycle (see KEGG cell cycle pathway). DNA microarray analysis reveals unique sets of target promoters among E2F family members suggesting that each protein has a unique role in the cell cycle. Among E2F transcriptional targets are cyclins, CDKs, checkpoints regulators, DNA repair and replication proteins. Nonetheless, there is a great deal of redundancy among the family members. Mouse embryos lacking E2F1, E2F2, and one of the E2F3 isoforms, can develop normally when either E2F3a or E2F3b, is expressed. The E2F family is generally split by function into two groups: transcription activators and repressors. Activators such as E2F1, E2F2, E2F3a promote and help carryout the cell cycle, while repressors inhibit the cell cycle. Yet, both sets of E2F have similar domains. E2F1-6 have DP1,2 heterodimerization domain which allows them to bind to DP1 or DP2, proteins distantly related to E2F. Binding with DP1,2 provides a second DNA binding site, increasing E2F binding stability. Most E2F have a pocket protein binding domain. Pocket proteins such as pRB and related proteins p107 and p130, can bind to E2F when hypophosphorylated. In activators, E2F binding with pRB has been shown to mask the transactivation domain responsible for transcription activation. In repressors E2F4 and E2F5, pocket protein binding (more often p107 and p130 than pRB) mediates recruitment of repression complexes to silence target genes. E2F6, E2F7, and E2F8 do not have pocket protein binding sites and their mechanism for gene silencing is unclear. Cdk4(6)/cyclin D and cdk2/cyclin E phosphorylate pRB and related pocket proteins allowing them to disassociate from E2F. Activator E2F proteins can then transcribe S phase promoting genes. In REF52 cells, overexpression of activator E2F1 is able to push quiescent cells into S phase. While repressors E2F4 and 5 do not alter cell proliferation, they mediate G1 arrest. E2F activator levels are cyclic, with maximal expression during G1/S. In contrast, E2F repressors stay constant, especially since they are often expressed in quiescent cells. Specifically, E2F5 is only expressed in terminally differentiated cells in mice. The balance between repressor and activator E2F regulate cell cycle progression. When activator E2F family proteins are knocked out, repressors become active to inhibit E2F target genes. ==E2F/pRb complexes== The Rb tumor suppressor protein (pRb) binds to the E2F1 transcription factor preventing it from interacting with the cell's transcription machinery. In the absence of pRb, E2F1 (along with its binding partner DP1) mediates the trans-activation of E2F1 target genes that facilitate the G1/S transition and S-phase. E2F targets genes that encode proteins involved in DNA replication (for example DNA polymerase, thymidine kinase, dihydrofolate reductase and cdc6), and chromosomal replication (replication origin-binding protein HsOrc1 and MCM5). When cells are not proliferating, E2F DNA binding sites contribute to transcriptional repression. In vivo footprinting experiments obtained on Cdc2 and B-myb promoters demonstrated E2F DNA binding site occupation during G0 and early G1, when E2F is in transcriptional repressive complexes with the pocket proteins. pRb is one of the targets of the oncogenic human papilloma virus protein E7, and human adenovirus protein E1A. By binding to pRB, they stop the regulation of E2F transcription factors and drive the cell cycle to enable virus genome replication. === Activators: E2F1, E2F2, E2F3a === Activators are maximally expressed late in G1 and can be found in association with E2F regulated promoters during the G1/S transition. The activation of E2F-3a genes follows upon the growth factor stimulation and the subsequent phosphorylation of the E2F inhibitor retinoblastoma protein, pRB. The phosphorylation of pRB is initiated by cyclin D/cdk4, cdk6 complex and continued by cyclin E/cdk2. Cyclin D/cdk4,6 itself is activated by the MAPK signaling pathway. When bound to E2F-3a, pRb can directly repress E2F-3a target genes by recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes and histone modifying activities (e.g. histone deacetylase, HDAC) to the promoter. === Inhibitors: E2F3b, E2F4, E2F5, E2F6, E2F7, E2F8 === * E2F3b, E2F4, E2F5 are expressed in quiescent cells and can be found associated with E2F-binding elements on E2F-target promoters during G0-phase. E2F-4 and 5 preferentially bind to p107/p130. * E2F-6 acts as a transcriptional repressor, but through a distinct, pocket protein independent manner. E2F-6 mediates repression by direct binding to polycomb-group proteins or via the formation of a large multimeric complex containing Mga and Max proteins. * The repressor genes E2F7/E2F8, located on chromosome 7, are transcription factors responsible for protein coding cell cycle regulation. Together, they are essential for the development of an intact, organized, and functional placental structure during embryonic development. While the specific molecular pathways remain unknown, researchers have used placental and fetal lineage specific cre mice to determine the functions of the synergistic E2F7 and E2F8 genes. Knockout mice, deplete of E2F7 and E2F8, result in abnormal trophoblastic proliferation accompanied by advanced cellular apoptosis. Phenotypically, the placenta presents with disruptions in cellular architecture to include large clusters of undifferentiated trophoblastic cells, which have failed to invade the maternal decidua.Ouseph, M., Li, J., Chen, H., Pecot, T., Wensel, P., Thompson, J., Comstock, G., Chokshi, V., Byrne, M., Forde, B., Chong, J., Huang, K., Machiraju, R., Bruin, A., and Leone, G. \\"Atypical E2F Repressors and Activators Coordinate Placental Development\\". Developmental Cell 22, 849-862, April 17, 2012. E2F7 and E2F8 proteins can function as repressors independently of DP interaction. They are unique in having a duplicated conserved E2F-like DNA-binding domain and in lacking a DP1,2-dimerization domain. They also appear to play a role in angiogenesis through the activation of vascular endothelial growth factor A. Using zebrafish, severe vascular defects of the head and somatic vessels were discovered when animals were depleted of E2F7 and E2F8.Weijts, B., Bakker, W., Cornelissen, P., Liang, K., Schaftenaar, F., Westendorp, B., De Wolf, C., Paciejewska, M., Scheele, C., Kent, L., Leone, G., Schulte-Merker, S., and Bruin, A. \\"E2F7 and E2F8 Promote Angiogenesis Through Transcriptional Activation of VEGFA in Cooperation with HIF-1. The EMBO Journal (2012) 31, 3871-3884. Antagonized by E2F3a, a transcriptional program has been discovered that functions through the coordination of multiple genes in the E2F family in order to ensure proper development of the placenta. ==Transcriptional targets== * Cell cycle: CCNA1,2, CCND1,2, CDK2, MYB, E2F1,2,3, TFDP1, CDC25A * Negative regulators: E2F7, RB1, TP107, TP21 * Checkpoints: TP53, BRCA1,2, BUB1 * Apoptosis: TP73, APAF1, CASP3,7,8, MAP3K5,14 * Nucleotide synthesis: thymidine kinase (tk), thymidylate synthase (ts), DHFR * DNA repair: BARD1, RAD51, UNG1,2, FANCA, FANCC, FANCJ * DNA replication: PCNA, histone H2A, DNA pol\\\\alpha and \\\\delta, RPA1,2,3, CDC6, MCM2,3,4,5,6,7 == See also == *Transcription factor DP *Type 3c (Pancreatogenic) Diabetes == References  External links == * * Drosophila E2F transcription factor - The Interactive Fly * Drosophila E2F transcription factor 2 - The Interactive Fly Category:Cell cycle Category:Transcription factors ","title":"E2F"},{"id":"2228132","text":"is a Super Robot anime series created by Yoshiyuki Tomino and Yoshitake Suzuki, featuring character design by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko and produced by Sunrise. It was first broadcast on Japanese TV in 1977. The series lasted for 23 episodes. == Story == There once existed a planet named Beal, until it was wiped out by the mysterious entity known as Gaizok. The few remaining survivors escaped to Earth and split into three families, named Jin, Kamie, and Kamikita respectively. While attempting to start a new life, the collectively known \\"Jin Family\\" prepared for the inevitable Gaizok invasion on Earth and its giant mechanical beasts known as \\"Mecha Boosts\\". In order to defend their new home, they have built three vehicles which when combined form the mighty Zambot 3. The Jin Family must not only defend against Gaizok attacks, but also harsh criticisms from the very people they protect, who blame the Jin Family for the invasion in the first place. The show begins as a typical Super Robot anime, but made an effort to giving a realistic explanation to the \\"strangeness\\" seen in precedent anime. It gives a rational explanation \\"why young children are chosen for the pilots\\", and tries to depict civilians' sufferings under the invasion of aliens. A much darker twist begins in episode 16 with the introduction of the cruel Human Bombs, which within two episodes leads to deaths that tug on the audience's heartstrings. Indeed, most protagonists are killed in the tragic ending. For these reasons, Zambot 3 is regarded as the most important forerunner to the Real Robot anime. Director Yoshiyuki Tomino's nickname, \\"Kill 'Em All Tomino\\" originates from this work. ==CharactersJin Family=== Zambot 3 Crew Kappei Jin is the main character of Zambot 3 and pilot of the Zambird/Zambo Ace as well as controlling the primary functions of the titular robot. At 12 years old, Kappei is always eager to get into dangerous, high-risk situations, be it in battle against one of Gaizok's Mecha Boosts or against his rival K≈çzuki. While Kappei is generally willing to go into battle, he will at times run into an emotional dilemma, generally stemming from civilian backlash against the Beal- Seijin. Kappei is also very athletic and a skilled martial artist. His best friends are his pet dog, Chiyonishiki and the girls Aki and Michi. Out of the entire team, Kappei is the only member to survive the final battle, as Uch≈´ta and Keiko perish in a successful suicide attack, Chiyonishiki is killed when the Zambo Ace's right lower leg (which houses his cockpit) is destroyed, and the rest of the Jin Family dies when their ship burns up while they are giving Kappei time to escape. Chiyonishiki is Kappei's pet dog akita inu and his faithful friend, who \\"copilots\\" Zambird alongside Kappei. Yoshinori Kanada of Studio Z misunderstood him as a robot dog, so there are some scenes which implicate his robotic nature. Uch≈´ta Kamie is 15 years old and pilot of the Zambull. While Uch≈´ta is more mature than Kappei, he is about as eager to jump into battle, to the point that early on in the series Kappei and Uch≈´ta would argue over who should be doing most of the fighting. Uch≈´ta has to deal with a family that is not as devoted to the fight against Gaizok as himself. In the final battle, he and Keiko perish in a successful suicide attack. Keiko Kamikita is 14 years old and pilot of the Zambase. On the Kamikita's ranch, Keiko's hobbies are archery and horseback riding. While not as overtly aggressive as her male teammates, Keiko is if anything more willing to fight Gaizok, even at times attempting to pilot despite bodily injury. While Keiko has the strongest convictions of the team, she is also perhaps the most emotionally vulnerable. One of Keiko's most famous lines is, \\"Please transform, and don't make a girl say 'please!'\\" In the final battle, she and Uch≈´ta perish in a successful suicide attack. Other Jin Family members Heizaemon Kamikita is Keiko's grandfather and commander of the King Beal. Gengoroh Jin is Kappei's father. Ichitaroh Jin is Kappei's older brother. Hanae Jin is Kappei's mother and the only family survivor of the Jin family. Including Kappei. Umee Jin is Kappei's grandmother. ===Humans=== Shingo K≈çzuki is 13 years old and the leader of a local gang of kids. Shingo (most frequently referred to as K≈çzuki in the series) is essentially Kappei's rival, as both have tendencies to play in the most dangerous ways possible, e.g. fighting each other with anchors. Like Kappei, Shingo is a skilled martial artist. Shingo is a civilian and does not pilot any anti-Gaizok vehicles, but he is nevertheless thrust into the middle of the conflict due to both circumstances beyond his control and through his own actions. Shingo has a mother and a sister, Kaoru, of whom he is very protective. Kaoru K≈çzuki is Shingo's little sister. Unlike most others, Kaoru sees the Jin Family and particularly Kappei as good people. Aki is 12 years old and can be seen as Kappei's \\"love interest.\\" Along with her best friend, Michi, Kappei frequently takes them along on his adventures, both in and out of Zambird. Aki is very sensible and confident, and will give Kappei a few harsh words if need be. At the same time, she is rather impressed by Kappei and the Zambird. The Zambot Archives book refers to Aki and Michi as the \\"Kappei Fan Club.\\" Michi is 12 years old and best friends with Aki. Michi, like Aki, tends to follow Kappei for one reason or another. Shyer and more reserved than Aki, Michi is usually worried about what will happen to them whenever Kappei does anything dangerous/stupid. The Zambot Archives book refers to Aki and Michi as the \\"Kappei Fan Club.\\" Hamamoto is 12 years old and Kappei's first known child who has an Human Bomb in his back. Jin Kappei's try to save him by that bomb but there is no solved medicine to trust thoughout Hamamoto known that he is becoming died. And cried over his family when the Bomb killed alot of people where Kappei becoming crying that he can't solve this problem. Kenta is 12 years old and Kappei's second friend who has an human bomb in it. ===Gaizok=== Gaizok is the mysterious entity responsible for the destruction of the planet Beal. He seeks to do the same to Earth as he did to Beal, and perhaps other planets as well. No one knows Gaizok's true motives or even his true identity, including his subordinate, Killer the Butcher. In the last episodes, Gaizok is revealed to be an extremely evolved artificial intelligence, that was once created by an ancient, super-advanced civilization, with the task of destroying anyone that would display aggressive feelings. But, having turned mad with old age, Gaizok has come to the conclusion that every feelings are dangerous and must be suppressed, meaning the destruction of all sentient beings. Killer the Butcher is the most prominent villain in Zambot 3. Butcher is responsible for sending out Mecha Boosts to attack the Earth, particularly Japan. Butcher is a rather eccentric villain, and is seen constantly indulging in luxuries, be it eating endless amounts of meat, trying on jewelry, or attempting to sun bathe despite being inside of the Bandok. However, this extravagance does not make him any less ruthless. Butcher was sent to kill the humans, and that's exactly what he plans to do. Butcher's headquarters is the powerful mobile fortress, Bandok. Gizzar is Butcher's right-hand man and field commander coming up with diabolical plots. Unlike Butcher he takes his job very seriously and is very thin, but he is still just as ruthless. Gizzar is often Butcher's whipping boy whenever something goes wrong. Barettar is a field commander nearly identical to Gizzar except for muscular and has scars all over his face. Zubutar is the Bandok's chief designer of the Mecha-Boosts. Snai-Sworders are small snail-like reconnaissance robots used by Butcher to observe battles. They possess no offensive capabilities. Bandok is the four- legged robot space fortress commanded by Butcher. For the first nine episodes it serves as only a headquarters near Earth's orbit where Mecha-Boosts are produced. In episode ten it comes to Earth and releases a series of Beltar Tanks to defend itself. After Mecha-Boost Tracid is destroyed, Zambot 3 attempts to attack only for a barrier to knock it away. In the next episode it is forced to flee back into space after being destroyed internally by Zambo Ace. Returns to Earth in episode 18 as the primary facility for converting humans into living bombs, keeping itself underwater at well over twelve hundred meters below the surface until Zambot 3 discovers its location. The head detaches itself and starts firing extremely large torpedoes at Zambot 3 from its mouth as well as stops the Moon Attack with an energy barrier. It retreats to space again in episode 19 after large quantities of damage and the energy barrier being destroyed by Zambot 3's Moon Attack and destruction of Mecha-Boost Gaidar. In episode 21 the Bandok uses well over two thousand space mines and homing missiles with eyeballs for nose cones called Gaizok Missiles to attack the King Beal as the Jin family approaches for the final battle. When King Beal is close enough, each arm of the Bandok fires a Bandok Cannon presumably just as powerful as the Ion Cannon. After 2nd Beal rams into its underside the main body is ultimately destroyed with the head being all that is left. In its final battle in episode 22 the head piloted by Butcher fires Bandok Missiles and eye lasers only for it to be finished off by the Ion Cannon. Red Knight Deathcain and Blue Knight Heldyne are the two knights of Gaizok sealed within the Bandok as its guardians. Both appearing in episode 22 after most of the Bandok was destroyed, Butcher is forced into battle by Gaizok with both of these death personified knights as a last resort. Both appear as European knights on horses. Each one is armed with a small round shield that fires lightning bolts that can be combined for an extremely bright flash that launches swords and maces, although Deathcain possesses a sword while Heldyne possesses a double sided lance. Mecha-Boosts *Mecha-Boost Domira: Appears in episode 1. Appears as a humanoid with a chicken head and octopus arms.

Can be destroyed if hit in the inside of the mouth on its upper half. Garuchak reappears in episode 20 with a no name Mecha-Boost, Doyozurar, and Anmosgar. Unlike the first version this one launches fire balls instead of missiles from the mouth on its lower half. *Mecha-Boost Anmosgar: Appears in episode 9. Appears as a turtle with dog ears, masks on each of its upper arms that can be launched as projectiles, and a tank from the waist down. Armed with a strong freeze gas from the mouth and will convert its body into highly magnetic timed hydrogen bombs if destroyed by combustion.

After launching, the tail mace can eject the edges with thorny elastic wires to constrict its target *Mecha-Boost Zondar: Appears in episode 21. Appears as a four-armed humanoid with a bird head and mullet. Armed with four rapiers. Zondar is sometimes translated as Zondia. ==Mechanical weapons and vehiclesBealian machines=== Zambot 3 Zambot 3, along with the King Beal, are the primary defenses against the Gaizok invasion. Zambot 3 is formed when the Zambird, Zambull and Zambase combine by a sequence called Zambot Combination. There is a separate cockpit for each pilot. In the final battle, the Zambull and Zambase are destroyed in Uch≈´ta and Keiko's successful suicide attack, and the Zambo Ace is damaged beyond repair. Height: 60 meters Weight: 500 tons Output: 350,000 horsepower (260 MW) Energy source: Ion energy Main weapons *Arm Punch ‚Äì Retaining the launching fists of the Zambull, Zambot 3 fires its fist in typical super robot fashion. *Teisatsu Mecha Regon (Reconnaissance Mecha Regon) ‚Äì Zambot 3 retains Zambase's remote cameras. *Zambot Grap ‚Äì A pair of sai that can also join at the handles to transform into a double-sided lance, Zambot Blow, as well as a sword, Zambot Cutter. The variations are often used one after the other and to adapt to different situations. *Buster Missile ‚Äì Missiles fired from the pods on sides of Zambot 3's legs. *Zambot Buster ‚Äì The pods on the side of Zambot 3's legs are thrown like shuriken, and will often hit the enemy twice. *Moon Attack ‚Äì Energy is gathered from Zambot 3's hands to the moon on is forehead. A crescent moon- shaped energy attack flies at the target, multiplies and surrounds it, then recombines and punches a crescent moon-shaped hole through the target. Weaknesses: Zambot 3 has very few glaring design flaws, but the most prominent one is that its armor begins to fail when in waters deeper than 7000 meters. Zambird/Zambo Ace Pilot: Kappei Jin Zambird is a high-speed aerial vehicle which is able to go faster than Japan Self-Defense Force fighter jets. Zambird can transform into the humanoid Zambo Ace. Zambo Ace's primary armament is its Zambo Magnum.

The series was created and executive produced by Stephen J. Cannell. Most of the show's creative staff (Cannell, Juanita Bartlett, Gordon T. Dawson) were veterans of the private detective series The Rockford Files, which concluded its run about two weeks before Tenspeed and Brown Shoe debuted. ==Plot== The one-hour program revolved around two detectives who had their own detective agency in Los Angeles. E. L. (\\"Early Leroy\\") \\"Tenspeed\\" Turner (Ben Vereen) was a hustler who worked as a detective to satisfy his parole requirements. His partner Lionel \\"Brownshoe\\" Whitney (Jeff Goldblum) was an archetypal accountant, complete with button-down collars and a nagging fiancee (at least for the pilot episode), who had always wanted to be a 1940s-style Bogart P.I. A running joke was his penchant for reading a series of hard-boiled crime novels, subtitled \\"A Mark Savage Mystery\\", written by Stephen J. Cannell (though he never wrote such a series of novels), with Goldblum reading some passages in voice-over. He was sharper than he seemed, although a little na√Øve and more reasonable than his career path demanded, and had picked up karate to black-belt standard. ==Cast== * Ben Vereen as E.L. Turner * Jeff Goldblum as Lionel Whitney * Richard Romanus as Tedesco * Larry Manetti as Chip Vincent ==Production== This was the first series to come from Stephen J. Cannell Productions as an independent company (it was distributed through Paramount Television, one of only two such collaborations - the other was Riptide) and is also the only one not to carry the famed Cannell logo on any episodes, having \\"A Stephen J. Cannell Production\\" appearing in-credit (the logo was introduced in 1981 when The Greatest American Hero began airing). The show had broad similarities to the later television series Simon & Simon and Moonlighting, in that it was a lightly dramatic program with many comedic moments about two dissimilar detectives who attempt to solve cases together. Cannell recycled the basic idea of Tenspeed and Brown Shoe (a crime-solver on the right side of the law working with and taking responsibility for the rehabilitation of an ex-criminal) in watered-down form as the successful Hardcastle and McCormick. ==Episodes== { class=\\" plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:#FFFFFF\\" ! 6B4226\\" No. ! 6B4226\\" Title ! 6B4226\\" Directed by ! 6B4226\\" Written by ! 6B4226\\" Original air date } ==Reception== The show was heavily promoted by ABC at the time it premiered in late January 1980. The series attracted a substantial audience for its first few episodes (indeed, the series was the 29th-most watched program of the 1979‚Äì80 U.S. television season, according to Nielsen ratings), but viewership dropped off substantially after that, and the series was not renewed for the 1980‚Äì81 season. ==Home media== On March 9, 2010, Mill Creek Entertainment released Tenspeed and Brown Shoe on DVD in Region 1 for the first time. Because CBS, who held ownership of the pilot, refused to come to an agreement on its use, MCI revealed in January 2010 that it would not be included on the DVD. However, the full-length pilot is included in the German DVD release. ==Awards== { border=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#B0C4DE\\" align=\\"center\\" ! style=\\"background-color: #BCBCBC\\"Year ! style=\\"background- color: #BCBCBC\\"Award ! style=\\"background-color: #BCBCBC\\"Result ! style=\\"background-color: #BCBCBC\\"Category ! style=\\"background-color: #BCBCBC\\"Recipient -  1981  Edgar Award  Nominated  Best Television Episode  Stephen J.

It automatically records an incoming telegraph message as a wiggling ink line on a roll of paper tape. Later a trained telegrapher would read the tape, translating the pulses representing the \\"dots\\" and \\"dashes\\" of the Morse code to characters of the text message. The syphon recorder replaced Thomson‚Äôs previous invention, the mirror galvanometer as the standard receiving instrument for submarine telegraph cables, allowing long cables to be worked using just a few volts at the sending end. The disadvantage of the mirror galvanometer was that it required two operators, one with a steady eye to read and call off the signal, the other to write down the characters received. Its use spread to ordinary telegraph lines and radiotelegraphy radio receivers. A major advantage of the syphon recorder was that no operator has to monitor the line constantly waiting for messages to come in. The paper tape preserved a record of the actual message before translation to text, so errors in translation could be checked. == Principle of operation == Diagram of a siphon recorder mechanism from 1922 The siphon recorder works on the principle of a d'Arsonval galvanometer. A light coil of wire is suspended between the poles of a permanent magnet so it can turn freely. The coil is attached via two wire linkages to the metal plate siphon support, which pivots on a horizontal suspension thread. From this plate a narrow glass siphon tube hangs down vertically with its end almost touching a paper tape. The paper tape is pulled by motorized rollers at a constant speed under the siphon pen. Ink is drawn up from a reservoir into the tube by siphon action and comes out a tiny orifice in the end of the siphon tube, drawing a line down the moving paper tape. In order not to affect the motion of the coil, the siphon tube itself never touches the paper, only the ink. The current from the telegraph line is applied to the coil. The pulses of current representing the Morse code \\"dots\\" and \\"dashes\\" flowing through the coil create a magnetic field which interacts with the magnetic field of the magnet, creating a torque which causes the coil to rotate slightly about its vertical suspension axis. The wire linkages cause the siphon support plate to rotate about its horizontal axis, swinging the siphon tube across the paper tape. This draws a displacement in the ink line on the tape as long as the current is present in the coil. Thus the ink line on the tape forms a graph of the current in the telegraph line, with displacements representing the \\"dots\\" and \\"dashes\\" of the Morse code. An operator knowing Morse code later translates the line on the tape to characters of the text message, and types them onto a telegram form. == Kelvin's electrostatic syphon == Example of transatlantic radiotelegraph message recorded on paper tape by a siphon recorder at RCA's receiving center in New York City in 1920. Due to poor transmission quality of long telegraph lines the paper tape was often hard to read. The siphon and an ink reservoir are together supported by an ebonite bracket, separate from the rest of the instrument, and insulated from it. This separation permits the ink to be electrified to a high potential while the body of the instrument, including the paper and metal writing tablet, are grounded, and at low potential. The tendency of a charged body is to move from a place of higher to a place of lower potential, and consequently the ink tends to flow downwards to the writing tablet. The only avenue of escape for it is by the fine glass siphon, and through this it rushes accordingly and discharges itself upon the paper. The natural repulsion between its like-electrified particles causes the shower to issue in spray. As the paper moves over the pulleys a delicate hair line is marked, straight when the syphon is stationary, but curved when the siphon is pulled from side to side by the oscillations of the signal coil. Power to pull the roll of paper tape through the syphon recorder was usually supplied by one Froment's mouse mill motors. These also drove an electrostatic machine to generate the electricity to power the syphon. == Muirhead's vibrating recorder == Muirhead mechanism A simpler mechanism, operating quite differently, was developed by Alexander Muirhead. This used a vibrating pen to avoid the same problem of the ink sticking to the paper. The recording pen was suspended on a thin wire, vibrated by an electromagnet mechanism similar to that of an electric bell, to break contact with the paper. == References == * Category:Telegraphy Category:Non-impact printing Category:Recording devices ","title":"Syphon recorder"},{"id":"2228165","text":"Esbjerg forenede Boldklubber (; commonly known as Esbjerg fB or EfB in short) is a professional football club based in Esbjerg, West Jutland, Denmark, that plays in the 1st, the second-tier of the Danish football league system.

The new club was driven by ambition for something bigger, which already produced results the day after when the club's best start-up team defeated Kolding IF with 7‚Äì0. The club's golden years were in the first half of the 1960s with the Austrian coach Rudi Strittich throughout most of the decade. The club won the Danish Championship in 1961, 1962, 1963 and 1965 and won the DBU Cup in 1964.

C. Wilsher and produced by World Productions for the BBC. It was first shown on BBC1 between 1992 and 1994, running for three series. The show centred on the eventful life of Detective Superintendent Tony Clark, played by Neil Pearson. Clark was an ambitious member of the Complaints Investigation Bureau (CIB), an internal organisation of the Metropolitan Police that investigates complaints against officers as well as claims of corruption inside the police force. Along the way Clark had to overcome strong influence from his superiors and problems in his private life, most notably the break-up of his marriage following an affair with WPC Jenny Dean (Lesley Vickerage). Throughout the series Clark was assisted by colleagues Harry Naylor (Tom Georgeson) and Maureen 'Mo' Connell (Siobhan Redmond). The show became a surprise hit for the BBC, winning a British Academy Television Award (BAFTA) for Best Drama Series in 1994. In 2000 it was voted into the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes by the British Film Institute. The series was reviewed in an episode of the BBC documentary series Call the Cops,Call the Cops at BBC Four which stated the series had \\"found a way of getting to grips with the corruption scandals of the 1990s\\".Call the Cops, episode 4: Between the Lines at BBC Four Executive producer Tony Garnett had begun his career as an actor before becoming a producer in the late 1960s. His credits included The Wednesday Play and Play for Today. Following Between the Lines, he went on to produce several popular and notable series including This Life (1996‚Äì97), Ballykissangel and The Cops (1998‚Äì2000). ==Plot== Clark's work as a lead officer in CIB was the focus of the first two series. In the first series his boss was Deakin, a tough ex-RUC Northern Irish policeman. At the end of the first series, Deakin was revealed to be a corrupt officer himself. He left the force but remained a recurring character, working freelance for the security services and others, sometimes in conflict with Clark and sometimes assisting him. At the start of the third series (after a dramatic shoot-out at the end of the second) Clark, Naylor and Connell leave the police force and work in the murky world of private security, far-right political groups and espionage. The third series ends with the betrayal of Clark and Naylor who had been masquerading as mercenaries. The betrayal is made by Connell in league with Deakin, their former boss and nemesis. It is unclear whether Clark and Naylor have died as the show ended on a cliffhanger. Rumours of a remake did circulate for some years, but Pearson confirmed in 'Watching the Detectives' that he had wanted a 'final' ending at the time and would never return to the role. Between The Lines was one of the first British TV dramas to include a bisexual character (whose sexual orientation is incidental rather than central to the plot). Maureen (Mo) Connell (Siobhan Redmond) has two significant romantic partners during the series, a husband in the first series (whom she divorces), and later on a long-term girlfriend. While some other police officers are briefly shown making disapproving comments (e.g. when she brings her girlfriend as plus-one to a police social), her bisexuality is shown as completely accepted by close colleagues, if a subject of occasional friendly banter (e.g. Mo mentions having a date that night, Tony asks \\"girl or boy?\\" and she replies sarcastically \\"one of each\\".) ==Background== Until the 1970s, complaints against the police in Britain were dealt with internally, with no outside oversight, leading to public dissatisfaction amid allegations that misconduct and corruption were not being effectively dealt with. The 1976 Police Act established the Police Complaints Board, an independent review body, but following the Scarman Report in 1982 this was replaced by the more effective Police Complaints Authority, creating the background of the series.History and context, report by LibertyHistory ipcc.gov.uk However, even today, under the current Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), the majority of complaints against the police are dealt with internally. The IPCC investigates the most serious cases and deals with appeals.Role of the IPCC ipcc.gov.uk At the time of the series in the 1990s, the department of the Metropolitan Police responsible for internal investigations was the Complaints Investigation Bureau (CIB); it has subsequently been replaced by the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS). The two first series of Between the Lines is a dramatisation of the work of the CIB. In the third series focus is shifted more towards the secret services and MI5 in particular. John Deakin, whose shadow is present throughout all three series, has a past in the Ulster police. He is the \\"fireproof\\" high rank detective who decides which other high ranked detectives that may use which methods. Tony manages to discover who he really is, but not good enough. Deakin also has contacts in the secret services. And the final two episodes (\\"The End User\\" 1 & 2) deals with a story of illegal weapon smuggling to Northern Ireland.

After earning a master's degree in Rehabilitation Counseling at San Francisco State University in 1969, he served as a probation officer in Contra Costa County, California. He later worked for the Peace Corps, serving as Associate Director of the Peace Corps program in the Philippines from 1980 to 1985. He served as Director of Administration at the Rehabilitation Services of Northern California until joining the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in 1988. After working in Bolivia, Peru, and Zimbabwe, Foley became Supervisory Executive Officer of USAID/Jordan in 2000. ==Death== On the morning of October 28, 2002, Foley was killed by gunshots from a 7 mm pistol as he walked to his car outside his Amman home. On December 14, two men, Libyan Salem bin Suweid and Jordanian Yasser Freihat, were arrested and charged with killing Foley. According to the Jordanian government, the men were paid to kill Foley by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, an Islamist militant leader, who at that time was the commander of the group later renamed al-Qaeda in Iraq. Though the men confessed, they later claimed they were forced to by Jordanian authorities. In April 2004, the two men were sentenced to death for killing Foley. Zarqawi was sentenced to death in absentia for his role in the assassination, but was killed in a U.S. airstrike on June 7, 2006. Foley's assassins were executed on March 11, 2006. Another conspirator, Mohammed Ahmed Youssef al-Jaghbeer, was sentenced to death on July 13, 2009. ==References== Category:1942 births Category:2002 deaths Category:2000s murders in Jordan Category:2002 crimes in Jordan Category:2002 murders in Asia Category:People from Boston Category:American diplomats Category:Assassinated American diplomats Category:Deaths by firearm in Jordan Category:American terrorism victims Category:Terrorism deaths in Jordan Category:American people murdered abroad Category:People murdered in Jordan Category:Peace Corps volunteers Category:American expatriates in India Category:American expatriates in the Philippines Category:American expatriates in Jordan ","title":"Laurence Foley"},{"id":"2228227","text":"Peter Criss is the 1978 debut solo album by Peter Criss, the drummer of American hard rock band Kiss. It was one of four solo albums released by the members of Kiss on September 18, 1978. The album was produced by Vini Poncia, who went on to produce the Kiss albums Dynasty (1979) and Unmasked (1980). Criss covered \\"Tossin' and Turnin'\\", which was a #1 hit for Bobby Lewis in the U.S. during the summer of 1961. The song was subsequently covered by Kiss on their 1979 tour. ==Songs== Much of the material on the album was originally written in 1971 for Criss's pre-Kiss band Lips. These include \\"I'm Gonna Love You\\", \\"Don't You Let Me Down\\", \\"That's the Kind of Sugar Papa Likes\\", and \\"Hooked on Rock 'n' Roll\\". The album also includes a cover of the song \\"Tossin' and Turnin\\" by Bobby Lewis. == Reception == Reviews for Peter Criss were mostly negative. AllMusic called it \\"the most undistinguished of the bunch, lacking hooks on either the pop-metal rockers or the power ballads, as well as personality throughout.\\" The album was the lowest charting of all the Kiss solo albums of 1978, reaching #43 on the US Billboard album chart.

The club won Georgian championship in 1937, which gave them the permission to participate in USSR Top League. Their debut season in the highest level of the Soviet football championship came in 1938, where the club took 24th place out of 26 and got relegated. However, the Tbilisi- based club managed to get another promotion during the following season and participated in 1940 Soviet Top League. But they were eventually disqualified from the tournament. These were the only seasons when Locomotive managed to take part in the top league. From the following years until the dissolution of USSR, the club moved between the lower divisions, played in the second the third divisions of the Soviet football championship.

The winner was Peter Morris, a Canadian, representing the United States. Plans for a World Scrabble Championship had formed as early as 1986/87. After Coleco bought Selchow and Righter, the company announced that they were interested in helping players to organize a \\"World-Class Open\\" in 1988. At the 1987 Nationals, John Williams announced that the first World Scrabble Championship would be held the following summer in New York. It would be 1991, however, before it became a reality. The 48 players were separated into random groups of 6 and played round robins within their groups. The top 2 players from each group then played a knockout to produce two finalists who played a best-of-three finals. Morris and Cappelletto split their first two games then met for a final game to decide it all. On his tenth move, Cappelletto made a rare blunder by playing the phony SMAIL instead of CLAIMS. The move may have cost him the championship. As it was, Morris pulled out a complicated end game for a 4-point win and the first world title. ==Complete Results== {  - bgcolor=\\"#ececec\\" !Position !Name !Country !Prize (USD) - !1 Morris, PeterUnited Statesalign=\\"right\\"10,000 - !2 Cappelletto, BrianUnited Statesalign=\\"right\\"5,000 - !3 Boys, DavidCanadaalign=\\"right\\"2,500 - !4 Edley, JoeUnited Statesalign=\\"right\\"1,000 - !5 Tiekert, RonUnited Statesalign=\\"right\\"500 - !6 Cansfield, JoyceUnited Kingdom - !7 Simonis, SandieUnited Kingdom - !8 Benjamin, LarrySouth Africa - !9 Fisher, StephenCanada - !10 Southwell, CharlieUnited States - !11 Finley, PeterEngland - !12 Cohen, EvanIsrael - !13 Carroll, CharlieUnited States - !14 Elbourne, PeterMalta - !15 Warusawitharana, MissakaSri Lanka - !16 Nderitu, Patrick GitongaKenya - !17 Grant, JeffNew Zealand - !18 Sapong, KwakuGhana - !19 Holgate, JohnAustralia - !20 Fisher, AndrewUnited Kingdom - !21 Spate, CliveUnited Kingdom - !22 Nyman, MarkEngland - !23 Violett, BobUnited Kingdom - !24 Schonbrun, LesterUnited States - !25 Sigley, MichaelNew Zealand - !26 Kane, AlistairAustralia - !27 Wapnick, JoelCanada - !28 Pratesi, DianeUnited Kingdom - !29 Filio, RolandPhilippines - !30 Donkoh, GeorgeGhana - !31 Brown, Christine√âire - !32 Harridge, BarryAustralia - !33 Appleby, PhilEngland - !34 Butler, LynneNew Zealand - !35 Lawrie, GlenysAustralia - !36 Felt, RobertUnited States - !37 Filio, CandidoPhilippines - !38 Rowe, DennisEuropean Community - !39 Saldanha, NorbertUnited Arab Emirates - !40 Saldanha, AllanUnited Kingdom - !41 Sim, TonySingapore - !42 Berger, AverilSouth Africa - !43 Thobani, ShafiqueKenya - !44 Ismal, MuhammedMalaysia - !45 Cleary, Paul StephenAustralia - !46 Thompson, MartinUnited Kingdom - !47 Levine, EliSouth Africa - !48 Nakai, KenJapan } *Finals *Game 1: Morris 463 - Cappelletto 349 *Game 2: Cappelletto 368 - Morris 301 *Game 3: Morris 371 - Cappelletto 367 == References == 1991 Category:1991 in the United Kingdom Category:1991 in London Category:Scrabble in the United Kingdom ","title":"World Scrabble Championship 1991"},{"id":"2228273","text":"Lovehunter is the second studio album by British band Whitesnake, released in 1979.

Marie-Jeanne Rose Bertin (2 July 1747, Abbeville, Picardy, France ‚Äì 22 September 1813, √âpinay-sur-Seine) was a French milliner (Marchande de modes), known as the dressmaker to Queen Marie Antoinette. She was the first celebrated French fashion designer and is widely credited with having brought fashion and haute couture to the forefront of popular culture. ==Life== Rose Bertin was the daughter of Nicolas Bertin (d. 1754) and Marie-Marguerite M√©quignon, and spent her childhood in St Gilles in Picardie. She came from a family of small means; her mother worked as a sick nurse, which at the time was a profession with very low salary and status, and the financial situation became even worse after the death of her father.Langlade, √âmile. Rose Bertin: Creator of Fashion at the Court of Marie Antoinette (London: John Long, 1913). She and her brother Jean-Laurent received a modest education, but had a high level of ambition. ===Early career=== At the age of sixteen, Rose Bertin moved to Paris, where she became apprenticed to a successful milliner, Mademoiselle Pagelle, with clients among the aristocracy. Bertin's early success can be attributed to her good relations with the Princesse de Conti, the Duchesse de Chartres and the Princesse de Lamballe, who would one day arrange her meeting with Marie Antoinette. After having acquired a big order for Pagelle, she became her business partner. In 1770, Bertin opened her own dress shop, Le Grand Mogol, on the Rue Saint-Honor√© with the support of the Duchesse de Chartres (it moved to 26 Rue de Richelieu in 1789). She quickly found customers among influential noble ladies at Versailles, many of whom followed her from Mademoiselle Pagelle's, including many ladies-in-waiting to the new Dauphine, Marie Antoinette. ===Dressmaker to Marie Antoinette=== Before Marie Antoinette arrived in France from Austria, she had been schooled in the nuances of galant spoken French and French fashions. She was introduced to Bertin in 1772. Twice a week, soon after Louis XVI's coronation, Bertin would present her newest creations to the queen and spend hours discussing them. The queen adored her wardrobe and was passionate about every detail, and Bertin, as her milliner, became her confidante and friend. Her position as the designer of the queen also secured her the position as the leading fashion designer of the French aristocracy and, as French fashion was the leader in Europe, the central figure of European fashion. Called \\"Minister of Fashion\\" by her detractors, Bertin was the brains behind almost every new dress commissioned by the queen. Dresses and hair became Marie Antoinette's personal vehicles of expression, and Bertin clothed the queen from 1770 until her deposition in 1792. Bertin became a powerful figure at court, and she witnessed‚Äîand sometimes effected‚Äîprofound changes in French society. Her large, ostentatious gowns ensured that their wearer occupied at least three times as much space as her male counterpart, thus making the woman a more imposing presence. Her creations also established France as the center of the fashion industry, and from then on, dresses made in Paris were sent to London, Venice, Vienna, Saint Petersburg and Constantinople. This inimitable Parisian elegance established the worldwide reputation of French couture. In the mid-18th century, French women had begun to \\"pouf\\" (raise) their hair with pads and pomade and wore oversized luxurious gowns. Bertin used and exaggerated the leading modes of the day, and created poufs for Marie Antoinette with heights up to three feet. The pouf fashion reached such extremes that it became a period trademark, along with decorating the hair with ornaments and objects which showcased current events. Working with L√©onard Auti√©, the queen's hairdresser, Bertin created a coiffure that became the rage all over Europe: hair would be accessorized, stylized, cut into defining scenes, and modeled into shapes and objects‚Äîranging from recent gossip to nativities to husbands' infidelities, to French naval vessels such as the Belle Poule, to the pouf aux insurgents in honor of the American Revolutionary War. The queen's most famous coif was the \\"inoculation\\" pouf that she wore to publicize her success in persuading the king to be vaccinated against smallpox. Marie Antoinette also asked Bertin to dress dolls in the latest fashions as gifts for her sisters and her mother, the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. Bertin's fashion dolls were called \\"Pandores,\\" and were made of wax over jointed wood armatures or porcelain. There were small ones the size of a common toy doll, or large ones as big or half as big as a real person, petites Pandores and grandes Pandores. Fashion dolls as couriers of modesSee the cultural analysis of fashion dolls in Julie Park (2010), The Self and It: Novel Objects and Mimetic Subjects in Eighteenth-Century England: \\"The Fahion doll and the mimetic self\\" pp 103ff. remained in vogue until the appearance of Fashion magazines. With the queen's patronage, Bertin's name became synonymous with the sartorial elegance and excess of Versailles. Bertin's close relationship with the queen provided valuable background into the social and political significance of fashion at the French court. The frequent meetings between the queen and her couturi√®re were met, however, with hostility from the poorer classes, given Bertin's high prices: her gowns and headdresses could easily cost twenty times what a skilled worker of the time earned in a year. During Marie Antoinette's imprisonment, Bertin continued to receive orders from her former prized customer, for much smaller, almost negligible ribbons and simple alterations. She was to provide the former queen's mourning outfit following the execution of Louis XVI, recalling a dream that Marie Antoinette had had years before of her favorite milliner handing her ribbons that all turned to black. ===French Revolution=== The French Revolution did not immediately diminish her business despite the emigration of many of her clients abroad, and she continued to be in favor of the queen, though the bills were significantly lower. According to L√©onard Auti√©, he, Rose Bertin and Henriette Campan collectively contributed to the secret negotiations between the queen and Honor√© Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau by informing her about political gossip and public opinion and the fear that Mirabeau would ally himself with the Duke of Orl√©ans. Their information allegedly convinced the queen to meet Auguste Marie Raymond d'Arenberg in the rooms of her maid Marie-√âlisabeth Thibault and ask him to meet with Mirabeau in the home of Florimond Claude, Comte de Mercy-Argenteau, resulting in contact between the queen and Mirabeau. Bertin made several journeys abroad during the Revolution, which attracted attention. She made a trip to England and Germany in 1791‚Äì92, leading to suspicions that she was acting as Marie Antoinette's agent. According to these speculations, she secretly visited Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor to deliver a message from Marie Antoinette, as the latter's correspondence was scrutinized and an oral message through a loyal messenger was regarded as the safest method to deliver a sensitive message across borders. This is unconfirmed, but not improbable, as the queen is confirmed to have used her hairdresser L√©onard Auti√© as a messenger during the Flight to Varennes, and it is noted that Henriette Campan claimed that the queen managed to get secret messages to her nephew the emperor during this period. Officially, these were business trips, and Bertin is confirmed to have been in Germany in July 1791, when her presence is noted at the French √©migr√© court in the Castle Schoenbornhut in Koblenz, where she was said to have contributed to the extravagant fashion of the women attending the court. Bertin was absent from France during the September Massacres, which resulted in her being placed in the list of √©migr√©s. She managed to have herself removed from the list and returned to France in December 1792 to attend to her business. During this stay, popular legend says she destroyed her account books in order to spare the queen from having her bills used against her during her trial. However, this does not appear to be true: all the bills of the queen prior to August 1792 was already in the possession of the government through Henry, liquidator of the civil estate, and there was at that point not yet a trial planned against Marie Antoinette. It would therefore have been pointless for Bertin to destroy her account books for that reason, and the bills of Marie Antoinette were in fact inherited by her heirs, who would demand payment of them until 1830. In February 1793, Rose Bertin left France for London. For a while, she was able to serve her old clients among the √©migr√©s, and her fashion dolls continued to circulate among European capitals, as far away as Saint Petersburg. During these years, her main income was through demanding payment of bills owed to her by her old foreign clients, such as the queen of Sweden, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark. Her business in Paris still operated, despite her absence, through representatives she appointed and money she sent to it from London, and she still delivered orders to Marie Antoinette. ===Later career=== In January 1795, Rose Bertin managed to have her name struck from the list of √©migr√©s through her lawyer, who claimed that she had been absent legally since she left the country for business purposes on a legal passport from July 1792 (omitting her stay in France December 1792-February 1793), and she was thus free to return and resume her business. She is alleged to have acted as a secret messenger for √©migr√©s during this trip, and it is known that she provided them with funds, but this could have been merely a sign of her well-known generosity. Her business never fully recovered, but continued on a smaller scale. This was partially because of inflation and partially because fashions changed after the French Revolution ended. Jos√©phine de Beauharnais was among her clients, and she had foreign clients such as Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily (1799) and Maria Luisa of Parma (1808). She was eventually replaced as the leading fashion designer by Louis Hippolyte Leroy. As the 19th century dawned, Bertin transferred her business to her nephews and retired to her estate in √âpinay. She died in 1813 in √âpinay-sur-Seine. ==Famous quote== Bertin is said to have remarked to Marie Antoinette in 1785, when presenting her with a remodelled dress, \\"Il n'y a de nouveau que ce qui est oubli√©\\" (\\"There is nothing new except what has been forgotten.\\"). ==See also== * Le Sieur Beaulard * Mademoiselle Alexandre * Madame Eloffe * Marie Madeleine Duchapt ==ReferencesBibliography== *Fraser, Antonia.

Credited with breaking down barriers of racial segregation in professional wrestling, Harris is considered one of the first successful African-American professional wrestlers.Google Books Jackie Robinson reference == Early life == Houston Harris was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, but later lived in East St. Louis, Illinois, and Benton Harbor, Michigan. He played baseball in the Negro Leagues for The House of David, where he was discovered to become a wrestler at a steel mill. == Professional wrestling career == Harris was trained by Joe Savoldi after meeting him at matches at the Naval Armory. Savoldi originally named Harris, BuBu Brasil, \\"The South American Giant,\\" but a promoter misprinted his first name as \\"Bobo\\" in an advertisement and it stuck. Brazil would have many matches with competitors such as Killer Kowalski, Dick the Bruiser, Johnny Valentine, and The Sheik, who feuded with Brazil over the course of several decades. These and other rivals would all fall victim to Brazil's finishing maneuver, the Coco Butt. Brazil also once wrestled Bill Miller to a draw, and challenged Bruno Sammartino for the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship in a battle of two top babyface competitors. On October 18, 1962, Brazil defeated \\"Nature Boy\\" Buddy Rogers by hitting him in the groin causing Rogers to be unable to continue. Brazil refused the championship and they met a couple of weeks later and Rogers won. At the time the promoters were working a gimmick where the champ would be hit in the groin and the challenger wouldn't accept the title. The same scenario occurred in Toronto two weeks earlier with Bruno Sammartino and Rogers. Neither Brazil, nor Sammartino were officially recognized by the NWA as having won the World Heavyweight Championship. (This distinction is usually given to Ron Simmons, the first recognized African American world champion after winning the WCW World Heavyweight Championship). On October 9, 1970, Brazil and El Mongol defeated Mr. Ito and The Great Ota in the first racially mixed match in Atlanta history. Brazil served as a mentor to wrestler \\"Soulman\\" Rocky Johnson. Brazil's manager was James Dudley, the first African American to be in charge of a major arena in the United States. Dudley would run to the ring waving a towel, as Brazil followed behind. Brazil retired in 1993 after a four-decade career. His last official match was in Chicago, Illinois against Kelly Kiniski, son of rival Gene Kiniski. Brazil was inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame class of 1994 by Ernie Ladd. The following year, Brazil inducted Ladd into the WWF Hall of Fame. == Personal life and death == Harris had a wife and six children. After retiring from wrestling, he ran a restaurant called Bobo's Grill. His son Karl wrestles as Bobo Brazil Jr. in the independent circuit. As of 2019 he still wrestles at 67 years old. Harris died on January 20, 1998, at the Lakeland Medical Center in St. Joseph, Michigan. He had been admitted to the hospital on January 14, after suffering a series of strokes. == Championships and accomplishments == * Big Time Wrestling (Detroit) ** NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Detroit version) (9 times) ** NWA World Tag Team Championship (Detroit version) (8 times) ‚Äì with Art Thomas (1), Bill Miller (1), Athol Layton (1), The Stomper (1), Tony Marino (3) and Fred Curry (1) *Big Time Wrestling (San Francisco) ** NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (San Francisco version) (1 time) * Championship Wrestling from Florida ** NWA Florida Tag Team Championship (2 times) ‚Äì with Sweet Brown Sugar (1) and Dusty Rhodes (1) * Eastern Sports Association ** ESA North American Heavyweight Championship (1 time) * Japan Wrestling Association ** NWA International Heavyweight Championship (1 time, 1st reign is unofficially Recognised) * Maple Leaf Wrestling ** NWA Canadian Open Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Whipper Billy Watson ** NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Toronto version) (1 time) * Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling ** NWA United States Heavyweight Championship (Mid- Atlantic version) (1 time) * Midwest Wrestling Association (Ohio) ** MWA Ohio Heavyweight Championship (1 time) ** MWA Ohio Tag Team Championship (3 times) ‚Äì with Frankie Talaber * National Wrestling Alliance ** NWA Hall of Fame (Class of 2013) * NWA Hollywood Wrestling/Worldwide Wrestling Associates ** NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship (3 times) ** NWA \\"Beat the Champ\\" Television Championship (1 time) ** NWA International Television Tag Team Championship (4 times) ‚Äì with Wilbur Snyder (2), Sandor Szabo (1), and Primo Carnera (1) ** NWA Pacific Coast Heavyweight Championship (Los Angeles version) (1 time) ** WWA World Heavyweight Championship (2 times) * Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum ** Television Era (Class of 2008) * Pro Wrestling Illustrated ** PWI Editor's Award (1998) * Superstars of Wrestling ** SoW United States Heavyweight Championship (1 time) * World Wrestling Association (Indianapolis) ** WWA World Heavyweight Championship (2 times) ** WWA World Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äì with Chris Carter * World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation ** WWWF United States Heavyweight Championship (7 times) ** WWF Hall of Fame (Class of 1994) * Wrestling Observer Newsletter ** Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame (Class of 1996) * Other championships ** World Negro Heavyweight Championship (2 times) == References  External links == * * Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame profile (archived) * Category:1924 births Category:1998 deaths Category:20th-century American male actors Category:African-American male professional wrestlers Category:American male professional wrestlers Category:NWA/WCW/WWE United States Heavyweight Champions Category:Professional wrestlers from Arkansas Category:Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum Category:Sportspeople from Little Rock, Arkansas Category:WWE Hall of Fame inductees ","title":"Bobo Brazil"},{"id":"2228281","text":"Major William Addams Welch (August 20, 1868 - May 4, 1941) was an American engineer and environmentalist who would have a major impact on the state and national park systems of the United States. Born in Cynthiana, Kentucky, he obtained a civil engineering degree from Colorado College in 1882 and a master's degree from the University of Virginia in 1886. ==Background== In the 1890s, working for the U.S. government in Alaska, he assembled the first iron steamship to be built in that territory. He also designed railroads in southwest Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela, and worked on the legendary Madeira-Mamor√© Railway in Bolivia. In 1907, yellow fever forced him to return to the U.S. where he worked for John C. and Frederick Law Olmsted. In 1912, he was hired as assistant engineer by George W. Perkins, chairman of the newly formed Palisades Interstate Park Commission (PIP), and in 1914, he was made chief engineer and general manager. Under his leadership, Bear Mountain State Park and Harriman State Park grew from an initial to . By 1919, it was estimated that a million people a year were coming to the park. In the early 1920s, Welch's engineering work gained nationwide attention when he built Storm King Highway into the sheer cliffs above the Hudson River north of Bear Mountain. Plaque dedicated for Welch in Harriman State Park When Welch started work on Bear Mountain State Park and Harriman State Park, there were no existing models or precedents to guide him. Welch organized a massive reforestation program, built 23 new lakes, a hundred miles of scenic drives and 103 children's camps, where 65,000 urban children enjoyed the outdoors each summer. He helped found the Palisades Interstate Park Trail Conference and served as chairman of the Appalachian Trail Conference.

The winner was Mark Nyman, representing the United Kingdom, as this was before the countries of the UK were given individual representation. The first 15 rounds used modified Swiss pairing. After this, players #1 and #3 and players #2 and #4 played a best-of-five semifinal to determine the finalists while the remaining 64 players played three more games. The semifinals were followed by a best-of-five finals while the two other semifinalists played a best-of-five match to determine third and fourth place. The first game of the finals looked like it would go Nyman's way when he bingoed with MUTAGENIC from an MU on his second play and then challenged off Wapnick's DOX. But Nyman later played a phony of his own (VERGINGS) and then got stuck with the Q while Wapnick drew both blanks and won by 38. In game two, Wapnick drew both blanks again and won by almost 100 points, aided by the 102-point DYSURIC. Game three was tight until Nyman played two successive bingos and went on to a 530-victory. The fourth game again started close, until Wapnick scored 212 points on three successive turns (though he missed a 107-point bingo in the process) and took a seemingly insurmountable 174-point lead. A few turns later, Wapnick had the opportunity to take a 212 point lead with HELMING, but the play would have opened a triple-triple line with both blanks unseen so he opted for a more conservative 41-point play and still led by 170. Against the odds, Nyman came back with a 50-point X play and bingos with both blanks and went on to a devastating 9-point victory. The key point in the final game came when Wapnick, holding a blank, played STUM instead of SMUR (of which he was unsure). Nyman then bingoed with BEDAWIN setting up an S-hook on the O column. Unable to play a bingo ending in S because of his STUM play, Wapnick instead played GROANERs when he could have blocked the O column with ORANGiER. Sure enough, Nyman drew an S and played VELURES for 91 points then coasted to an easy win to become the first non-North American to win the world championship. ==Complete Results== {  - bgcolor=\\"#ececec\\" !Position !Name !Country !Win-Loss !Spread !Prize (USD) - !1 Nyman, MarkEngland18-7align=\\"right\\"+779align=\\"right\\"10,000 - !2 Wapnick, JoelCanada17-8align=\\"right\\"+1200align=\\"right\\"6,000 - !3 Gibson, DavidUnited States16-9align=\\"right\\"+503align=\\"right\\"3,000 - !4 Williams, GarethWales15-10align=\\"right\\"+404align=\\"right\\"1,500 - !5 Saldanha, AllanUnited Kingdom13-5align=\\"right\\"+951align=\\"right\\"900 - !6 Felt, RobertUnited States12-6align=\\"right\\"+642align=\\"right\\"750 - !7 Sigley, MichaelNew Zealand12-6align=\\"right\\"+467align=\\"right\\"600 - !8 Schoenman, BobUnited States12-6align=\\"right\\"+131align=\\"right\\"500 - !9 Spate, CliveUnited Kingdom11-7align=\\"right\\"+530align=\\"right\\"400 - !10 Sherman, JoelUnited States11-7align=\\"right\\"+526align=\\"right\\"300 - !11 Logan, AdamCanada11-7align=\\"right\\"+477align=\\"right\\"250 - !12 Morris, PeterWorld Champion11-7align=\\"right\\"+421align=\\"right\\"200 - !13 Nelkon, PhilUnited Kingdom11-7align=\\"right\\"+336align=\\"right\\"175 - !14 Lund, RichieUnited States11-7align=\\"right\\"+224align=\\"right\\"150 - !15 Odom, LisaUnited States11-7align=\\"right\\"+221align=\\"right\\"125 - !16 Catto, JohnUnited Kingdom10-8align=\\"right\\"+557align=\\"right\\"100 - !17 Greenspan, RandyUnited States10-5align=\\"right\\"+541 - !18 Edley, JoeUnited States10-5align=\\"right\\"+495 - !19 Dennis, DiEngland10-5align=\\"right\\"+399 - !20 Thorogood, BlueNew Zealand10-5align=\\"right\\"+326 - !21 Byers, RussellEngland10-5align=\\"right\\"+215 - !22 Day, DarrellUnited States10-5align=\\"right\\"+204 - !23 Lipton, BobUnited States10-5align=\\"right\\"+196 - !24 Grant, JeffNew Zealand10-5align=\\"right\\"+188 - !25 Kaufman, ZevCanada10-5align=\\"right\\"+26 - !26 Ploysangngam, AmnuayThailand10-5align=\\"right\\"-433 - !27 Nderitu, Patrick GitongaKenya9-6align=\\"right\\"+743 - !28 Graham, MattUnited States9-6align=\\"right\\"+319 - !29 Jaruwan, Ong- ArjThailand9-6align=\\"right\\"+274 - !30 Cappelletto, BrianUnited States9-6align=\\"right\\"+272 - !31 Ballard, NickUnited States9-6align=\\"right\\"+168 - !32 Elbourne, PeterMalta9-6align=\\"right\\"+52 - !33 Warusawitharana, MissakaSri Lanka9-6align=\\"right\\"+34 - !34 Luebkemann, JohnUnited States9-6align=\\"right\\"-141 - !35 Sim, TonySingapore9-6align=\\"right\\"-164 - !36 Finley, PeterEngland9-6align=\\"right\\"-230 - !37 Nevarez, JohnnyUnited States9-6align=\\"right\\"-293 - !38 Gruzd, StevenSouth Africa9-6align=\\"right\\"-362 - !39 Daniel, Robin PollockCanada8-7align=\\"right\\"+463 - !40 Rosenthal, JoanAustralia8-7align=\\"right\\"+62 - !41 Khoshnaw, KarlKurdistan- Iraq8-7align=\\"right\\"-34 - !42 Filio, RolandPhilippines8-7align=\\"right\\"-48 - !43 Cohen, EvanIsrael8-7align=\\"right\\"-113 - !44 Grayson, JohnWales8-7align=\\"right\\"-177 - !45 Wright, GeoffAustralia8-7align=\\"right\\"-379 - !46 Chishty, IshtiaqSaudi Arabia8-7align=\\"right\\"-482 - !47 Heaton, KenUnited Kingdom8-7align=\\"right\\"-737 - !48 Raychbart, PalomaIsrael7¬Ω-7¬Ωalign=\\"right\\"-259 - !49 Onani, MagwangaKenya7¬Ω-7¬Ωalign=\\"right\\"-391 - !50 Butler, LynneNew Zealand7-8align=\\"right\\"+190 - !51 Neuberger, JimUnited States7-8align=\\"right\\"-123 - !52 Clenaghan, NualaIreland7-8align=\\"right\\"-245 - !53 Benjamin, LarrySouth Africa7-8align=\\"right\\"-331 - !54 Lerman, JerryUnited States7-8align=\\"right\\"-424 - !55 Holgate, JohnAustralia7-8align=\\"right\\"-617 - !56 Jackman, BobAustralia6¬Ω-8¬Ωalign=\\"right\\"-525 - !57 Filio, CandidoPhilippines6¬Ω-8¬Ωalign=\\"right\\"-588 - !58 Norr, RitaUnited States6-9align=\\"right\\"-372 - !59 Koroda, KunihikoJapan6-9align=\\"right\\"-913 - !60 Meghan, Eileen√âire6-9align=\\"right\\"-950 - !61 Abdullah, Raja FuadinMalaysia6-9align=\\"right\\"-1205 - !62 Alimohamed, AmiraliUnited Arab Emirates5-10align=\\"right\\"-1237 - !63 Roff, LynnSouth Africa5-10align=\\"right\\"-867 - !64 Yeh, WinnieHong Kong3-12align=\\"right\\"-896 } *Semifinals *Mark Nyman 3 - David Gibson 2 *Joel Wapnick 3 - Gareth Williams 2 *Consolation Match *David Gibson 3 - Gareth Williams 2 *Finals *Game 1: Wapnick 446 - Nyman 408 *Game 2: Wapnick 443 - Nyman 357 *Game 3: Nyman 530 - Wapnick 374 *Game 4: Nyman 469 - Wapnick 460 *Game 5: Nyman 417 - Wapnick 369 == References == 1993 Category:1993 in American sports Category:1993 in sports in New York (state) ","title":"World Scrabble Championship 1993"},{"id":"2228289","text":"James Francis Gnecco III (born September 30, 1973) is an is a singer, songwriter and multi instrumentalist who makes music both under his name and the moniker Ours.

Centered in their capital of Sabzavar, they continued their reign until Khwaja 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad submitted to Timur in 1381, and were one of the few groups that managed to mostly avoid Timur's famous brutality. ==Religion== The Sarbadar state was marked by divisions in religious belief during its existence. Its rulers were Shi'i, though often Sunnis claimed leadership among the people with the support of Ilkhanid rulers. The leadership of the Shi'is stemmed chiefly from the charisma of Sheikh Khalifa; a scholar from Mazandaran, the shaikh had arrived in Khurasan some years before the founding of the Sarbadar state and was subsequently murdered by Sunnis. His successor, Hasan Juri, established the former's practices in the Sarbadar state. The followers of these practices were known as \\"Sabzavaris\\" after the city. The Sabzavaris, however, were divided; among their number were moderate Shi'is who were often at odds with the dervishes, adherents of a mystic ideology. The capital city of Sabzavar likely had a large Shi'ite community, but as the Sarbadars conquered the neighboring territory, they acquired cities with Sunni populations. ==Government== The Sarbadars are unique among the major contenders in post- Ilkhanid Persia in that none of their leaders ruled as legitimate sovereigns. None of them had a legitimate claim to the Ilkhanid throne, or were related to a Mongol or any other royal house, and none of them had previously held a high post within the Ilkhanate. While they on occasion recognized claimants to the Ilkhanid throne as their overlord, they did so purely as a matter of convenience, and in all other aspects they had no ties to the Ilkhanate. This fact had a strong influence regarding the nature of the Sarbadar political state. The Sarbadars had a form of government which would, in modern times, probably be identified as an oligarchy or a republic. Unlike their neighbors, the Sarbadars had no dynastic lines; power usually went to the most ambitious. This view is not universally held, however. Some point to the fact that one of the Sarbadar rulers, Vajih al-Din Mas'ud, produced a son who also eventually reigned, named Lutf Allah. While seven other rulers separated the reign of Mas'ud and that of his son, those seven rulers are sometimes considered regents for Lutf Allah, until he was old enough to grab power for himself. Nevertheless, the seven are generally considered the heads of state in their own right. A ruler would hold power for as long as he could; the fact that several of them met violent deaths was a sign of the instability that plagued the state for most of its existence. The founder of the Sabadar state, 'Abd al-Razzaq, used the title of amir during his reign. While many of the Sarbadar leaders were secular, the dervishes also had their turns in power, and on occasion they ruled the state in co-dominion with each other; such partnerships, however, tended to fall apart quickly. Because the two sides held radically different views on how the Sarbadar government should be run, there were often drastic changes in policy as one side would supplant the other as the most powerful. ==HistoryFoundation=== The Sarbadar state came into existence around early 1337. At that time, much of Khurasan was under the control of the Ilkhanid claimant Togha Temur and his amirs. One of his subjects, 'Ala' al-Din Muhammad, had jurisdiction over the city of Sabzavar. His oppressive taxation of the area caused an 'Abd al-Razzaq, a member of the feudal ruling class, to murder a government official in Bashtin, a district of the city. The official was a nephew of 'Ala' al-Din, and 'Abd al-Razzaq raised the standard of revolt. The rebels at first settled in the mountains, where they defeated militias sent against them and raided caravans and herds of cattle, and then in the summer of 1337 took possession of Sabzavar. Togha Temur was most likely campaigning in the west at this time, against the Jalayirids, making him unable to deal with the revolt. 'Abd al- Razzaq took the title of amir and had coins made in his name, but he was stabbed to death by his brother Vajih al-Din Mas'ud during an argument in 1338. Mas'ud, taking command of the Sarbadars, made peace with Togha Temur, promising to recognize him as sovereign and to pay taxes to him. The khan agreed, in the hope that it would put a stop to the Sarbadar raids on his supply trains. In the meantime, Shaikh Kalifa's follower Hasan Juri had been preaching in towns all across Khurasan, with great success. His accomplishments attracted the suspicion of the government authorities, and in May 1336 he fled to eastern Iraq. When he returned some years later, Togha Temur's lieutenant and commander of the Ja'un-i Qurban Arghun Shah had him arrested in 1339 or 1340. He was eventually released, perhaps due to the insistence of Mas'ud, who soon after decided to take advantage of Hasan Juri's popularity. He joined Hasan's order as a novice, and had him proclaimed as joint ruler. Hasan Juri proclaimed that the Twelfth Imam would soon return. While the sharing of power began well, differences quickly emerged between the two. Mas'ud believed in accepting the nominal suzerainty of Togha Temur, while Hasan Juri was intent on establishing a Shi'i state. The two rulers each gained bases of support; the former had his family and the gentry, while the latter had the dervishes, the aristocracy, and the trade guilds. Both also had their own armed forces; Mas'ud had 12,000 armed peasants and a bodyguard of 700 Turkish slave troops, while Hasan Juri had an army composed of artisans and merchants. In 1340 Mas'ud moved against the Ja'un-i Qurban under Arghun Shah; the latter was forced to abandon Nishapur and retreat to Tus. The Sarbadars continued to mint coins in Togha Temur's name, in the hope that he would ignore this move as he was campaigning in the west again at this time. The khan, however, moved against them; his forces were destroyed, and while fleeing to Mazandaran several important figures such as 'Ala' al-Din (formerly in charge of Sabzavar), 'Abd-Allah, and Togha's own brother 'Ali Ke'un were killed. The Sarbadars gained control of Jajarm, Damghan and Simnan, along with Togha's capital of Gurgan. Mas'ud and Hasan Juri, however, soon came into disagreement over several issues. Mas'ud, following the defeat of Togha Temur, gained a new suzerain in the form of Hasan Kucek of the Chobanids, as well as the latter's puppet khan Sulaiman. Mas'ud considered the move necessary; with the conquest of Simnan, the Chobanids were now neighbors. Since the Chobanids were Sunnis, however, this doubtless did not go over well with Mas'ud's co- ruler. With the defeat of the Ja'un-i Qurban and Togha Temur, the Sarbadars still had one more force to contend with in Khurasan: the Kartids of Herat. Their leader Mu'izz al-Din Husain also recognized Togha Temur's overlordship, and when the Sarbadars threw off the khan's nominal rule, they became enemies. The Sarbadars decided to destroy the Kartids with an offensive campaign. The armies of the two forces met at the Battle of Zava on July 18, 1342. The battle started out well for the Sarbadars, but then Hasan Juri was taken and killed. His supporters, assuming (perhaps correctly) that his death had been the result of an assassin of Mas'ud, promptly retreated, turning the tide of the battle. The Kartids therefore survived. Following the return home, Mas'ud attempted to rule without the support of the dervishes, but his power was decreased. He attempted to end the threat of Togha Temur, who had in the meantime made his camp in the Amul region and was preventing the Sarbadars from staying in contact with the Chobanids. Mas'ud undertook a campaign against him in 1344 which got off to a good start, but ended in disaster. On the route from Sari to Amul, the Sarbadar army was trapped in a pincer movement, and Mas'ud was taken prisoner and executed. Most of the Sarbadar conquests were lost as a result of the two losses; only the region around Sabzavar, as well as maybe Juvain and Nishapur remained in their hands. Togha Temur returned to Gurgan and once again gained the allegiance of the Sarbadars. ===1344‚Äì1361=== Mas'ud's first three successors ruled for a period totaling only three years. Both of the first two men had served as his military commanders; Mas'ud's brother Shams al-Din came next, only to fall as well. These internal conflicts were countered by good news on the external front; namely, the death of Arghun Shah in 1343, and the rise of his successor Muhammad Beg, who abandoned the alliance of the Ja'un-i Qurban with Togha Temur in favor of one with the Sarbadars. Shams al-Din was replaced in turn by the dervish Shams al-Din 'Ali in 1347, marking the loss of power by Mas'ud's adherents. Shams al-Din 'Ali was an effective administrator, reorganizing the state finances, carrying out tax reforms, and paying officials in cash. As a religious man, he attempted to stamp out prostitution, drugs and alcohol, and lived a simple life. His military was effective; although he failed to take Tus, he was able to destroy a rebellion in Damghan in the west. He was, however, prevented from turning the Sarbadar state to the Shi'i creed by Mas'ud's supporters, who kept the government Sunni. In the meantime, he gained enemies among the opponents of the dervishes, as well as the corrupt officials of the state that hated his reforms. One of these officials named Haidar Qassab, who was possibly a member of the artisan guild, murdered him around 1352. Shams al-Din 'Ali's successor was a member of the Sabzavari aristocracy named Yahya Karavi. Yahya was forced to deal with Togha Temur, who in spite of the loss of the allegiance of the Ja'un-i Qurban and, in 1349, the Kartids, still was a danger of the Sarbadars. His army of 50,000 dwarfed the Sarbadar army, which numbered only around 22,000. Yahya neutralized the khan by recognizing him as suzerain, striking coins in his name and paying taxes to him. He also promised to visit Togha Temur once a year. He was probably making one of these visits when he arrived in November or December 1353 at the khan's camp of Sultan-Duvin near Astarabad. Yahya and a group of his followers entered the camp and were allowed into Togha Temur's tent. There, they murdered the khan and his courtiers, then put to death the Mongol troops and killed the nomads' herds. With the death of Togha Temur, the last serious contender for the Ilkhanid throne was gone. The Sarbadar lands then expanded to the borders reached by Mas'ud, and then gained even more: the area around Ray, the city of Tus, and Astarabad and Shasman. Yahya, however, was murdered around 1356, possibly at the hands of Mas'ud's adherents. Mas'ud's son Lutf Allah was possibly involved in the murder. Haidar Qassib, the murderer of Shams al-Din 'Ali, now took advantage of the situation. Arriving from Astarabad, ostensibly to hunt down Yahya's killers, he installed Yahya's nephew Zahir al-Din Karavi to rule. Soon afterwards, however, he removed him from power and ruled in his own name. Unfortunately for him, he was unpopular with nearly everyone even before he came to power. As a former member of Shams al-Din 'Ali's party, the supporters of Mas'ud disliked him, and his murder of Shams al-Din 'Ali alienated him from the dervishes. Nasr Allah, Lutf Allah's tutor, allied with Yahya's murderers and rose in revolt in Isfara'in, the second city of the Sarbadars. Haidar moved to put the rebellion down, but before he could he was stabbed to death by an assassin hired by a Hasan Damghani. Lutf Allah now gained control of the state, but he soon came into conflict with Hasan Damghani as well. He was defeated, and in the process Mas'ud's adherents were mostly eliminated. Hasan Damghani was now forced to deal with Amir Vali, who was a son of the former governor of Astarabad before its conquest by the Sarbadars. Amir Vali had taken advantage of Haidar Qassib's move out of Astarabad to return to the city. Amir Vali then claimed to be acting in the name of Luqman, the son of Togha Temur, although he never handed power over to him. Hasan sent two expeditions against him, both of which ended in failure; he himself led a third force, but met no more success, allowing Amir Vali to be in a position to gain more Sarbadar territory. Meanwhile, in the east a radical Shi'i named Darvish 'Aziz revolted and established a theocratic state in Mashhad in the name of the Twelfth Imam. Darvish 'Aziz gained more territory with his conquest of Tus. Hasan recognized that the entire Sarbadar state was in jeopardy: the Sabzavari dervishes might declare their support for the theocratic state at any time. He moved against Darvish 'Aziz, defeated him and destroyed the Mahdist state; Darvish 'Aziz went to Isfahan in exile. Soon afterward, however, an 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad rose in revolt in Damghan and gained the support of Hasan's enemies. He recalled Darvish 'Aziz from exile and joined his order. While Hasan was besieging the castle of Shaqqan, near Jajarm, 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad captured Sabzavar around 1361. In the process, he captured the possessions and families of many of Hasan's followers. When he demanded Hasan's head, they therefore complied. ===Decline and submission to Timur=== 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad enjoyed, by far, the longest reign out of all the Sarbadar rulers. The partnership with Darvish 'Aziz lasted for ten months; while 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad, who was Shi'i, helped raised Shi'ism to the state religion, he opposed several of Darvish 'Aziz's theocratic ideas. Tensions were high when a campaign was begun against the Kartids of Herat. Even before they had met any resistance, the Sarbadar army erupted in violence. While on the march, 'Ali's men picked a quarrel with the dervishes; Darvish 'Aziz and many of his followers were killed trying to escape. 'Ali returned and attempted to destroy the power of the dervishes completely. He moved against their organization and forced them out of Sabzavar, and even destroyed the graves of Shaikh Khalifa and Hasan Juri. The dervishes, however, fled, being granted refuge by the Kartids, the Ja'un-i Qurban, and the Muzaffarids of Shiraz. Meanwhile, the Ja'un-i Qurban regained Tus, though the two sides seemed to have no further conflict. Amir Vali gained control of Simnan and Bistam, though Astarabad was temporarily reconquered by the Sarbadars (1365/6-1368/9. Administratively, 'Ali increased the quality of the coinage, and instituted tax reforms. In 1370 Mu'izz al-Din Husain of the Kartids died, to be succeeded by his sons Ghiyas al-Din Pir 'Ali and Malik Muhammad. Pir 'Ali, a grandson of Togha Temur by his mother Sultan Khatun, considered the Sarbadars his enemy, and used the emigrant Sabzavaris in his realm to stir up discontent against Ali-yi Mu'ayyad. The latter responded by supporting Malik Muhammad, who ruled a small part of the Kartid lands from Sarakhs. Pir 'Ali then moved against his stepbrother, but Ali-yi Mu'ayyad stopped him by a flanking attack after overcoming one of Pir 'Ali's castles near the border, whose commanders were Sabzavaris. Pir 'Ali was forced to come to terms with his stepbrother. The fighting with the Sabadars, however, continued, and 'Ali was forced to throw his forces to defend Nishapur, leaving the western part of his lands exposed. At the same time, he made a hostile enemy out of Shah Shuja of the Muzaffarids. A revolt in 1373 in Kirman against Shah Shuja led by Pahlavan Asad received military support from 'Ali, but the rebellion was defeated in December 1374. The dervishes in Shiraz, meanwhile, found a leader in Rukn al-Din, a former member of Darvish 'Aziz's order. Shah Shuja gave them money and arms, and they conquered Sabzavar around 1376, forcing 'Ali to flee to Amir Vali. At about the same time, Nishapur was conquered by the Kartids of Pir 'Ali. The new government in Sabzavar established a Shi'i rule based on the teachings of Hasan Juri. Not long afterward, however, Amir Vali arrived before the city. His group included Ali- yi Mu'ayyad, as well as the Muzaffarid Shah Mansur. 'Ali was reinstated as Sarbadar ruler once the city was captured, but many of his reforms had been abandoned. The partnership with Amir Vali furthermore did not last, and in 1381 the latter was besieging Sabzavar again. 'Ali, believing he had little other choice, asked for the assistance of Timur the Lame. He submitted to the conqueror in Nishapur, and Timur responded by ravaging Amir Vali's lands in Gurgan and Mazandaran. In Radkan, as he was returning from the victorious campaign, he confirmed 'Ali as governor of Sabzavar. 'Ali remained loyal to Timur, dying in 1386 after being wounded during Timur's campaign in Lesser Luristan. As a reward for this loyalty, Timur never occupied Sabzavar with his own troops, and allowed 'Ali to retain his local administration. After 'Ali's death, the Sarbadar territories were split amongst his relatives, who mostly remained loyal to Timur as well and took part in his campaigns. Muluk Sabzavari did become involved with the revolt of Hajji Beg of the Ja'un-i Qurban (which had been forcibly submitted to Timur's rule around 1381) in Tus in 1389, and afterwards sought refuge with the Muzaffarid Shah Mansur in Isfahan, but was eventually pardoned by Timur and given the governorship of Basra near the end of 1393. That same year, following the conquest of Baghdad by Timur, the governorship of that city was given to 'Ali's nephew Khwaja Mas'ud Sabzavari, who had a force of 3,000 Sarbadars. Despite this, he was forced to retreat in 1394 when Sultan Ahmad of the Jalayirids marched to recapture the city, and he retreated to Shushtar. Following the death of Timur, the Sarbadars slowly fell out of prominence. ==Legacy== Historically, the Sarbadars have been considered a robber-state; they have been accused of being a group of religious fanatics who terrorized their neighbors, with little regard for legitimate rule. Considering the conduct of nearly all of the Persian states during this time period, this assessment seems needlessly harsh. Other historians have considered the Sarbadars to be an example of class struggle; the downtrodden rising up against oppressive taxation by their masters, and establishing a republic in the middle of several feudal states. This, however, is not entirely accurate either. 'Abd al-Razzaq was a member of the ruling class, which was taxed the heaviest at the time. It could however be said that it was definitely a struggle of a people with a certain belief system against an oppressive ruler desiring to establish what could be easily be labelled a republic. Religious orders were common in this period of Persian history, as the order of the Ilkhanate fell apart, to be replaced by a period of anarchy and incessant warfare. Aside from the Safavid dynasty of Persia in the 16th century, the Sarbadars were probably the most successful example of such orders, although they rarely managed to achieve the state that they so desired. ==Sarbadar influence== The Sarbadars had an indirect on northern Iran, where several Shi'i attempts to gain power locally were launched: Mazandaran: During Shams al-Din 'Ali's reign, a supporter of Hasan Juri named 'Izz al-Din, with a group of fellow adherents, returned to his homeland in Mazandaran. They were apparently unable to accept the moderate tone taken by the Sabadars in Sabzavar. 'Izz al-Din died en route, leaving his son Sayyid Qivan al-Din (also known as Mir-i Buzurg) to lead the group. They arrived in Amul and set up a state together with Kiya Afrasiyab, a son of a Hasan Chulabi, who had destroyed the local Bavand dynasty in 1349. Like the Sarbadars, conflict soon erupted in this state between the secular rulers and the dervishes; the latter eventually won. Destroyed in 1392 by Timur, it emerged once more after his death, but only for a brief time. Gilan: In Gilan, in northwestern Persia, a group of Shi'i shaikhs received help from the Mazandarani dervishes, and gained control of the region under Shaikh Amir Kiya. Due to the region's relative obscurity, the state survived until 1592, when it was absorbed by the Safavid Persians. ==Other Sarbadars== Samarkand: A group of \\"sarbadars\\" (it is not known whether they actually called themselves that) was instrumental of the defeat of the khan of Moghulistan (the Eastern Chagatai Khanate), Ilyas Khoja, during his invasion of the Western Chagatai Khanate in 1365. The sarbadars of Samarkand closed the gates of the city and refused to open them for the invader. They withstood the subsequent siege and organized ambushes on the enemy until an epidemic began striking down the Moghul horses, forcing them to retreat. Shortly afterwards, an early ally of Timur, Husayn, forced his way into Samarkand and put most of the sarbadar leaders to death. Despite being a nomad, Timur decided to court the assistance of the sedentary sarbadars following the breakdown of the alliance with Husayn, and they were an important factor in his rise to power in the Chagatai horde. ==Rulers== *Abd al-Razzaq ibn Fazlullah (1332‚Äì1338) *Wajih ad-Din Masud ibn Fazlullah (1338‚Äì1343) *Muhammad Ay Temur (1343‚Äì1346) *Kaba Isfendiyar (1346‚Äì1347) *Lutf Allah (1347-1348 d.1361) *Khwaja Tadj ad-Din Ali (1348‚Äì1353) *Yahya ibn Karawi (1353‚Äì1356) *Zahir ad-Din (1358‚Äì1359) *Haidar al-Qassab (1359‚Äì1360) *Lutf Allah (restored) (1360‚Äì1361) *Hasan al-Damghani (1361‚Äì1364) *Khwaja 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad ibn Masud (1364-1376 d.1386) *Rukn ad-Din (1376‚Äì1379) *Khwaja 'Ali-yi Mu'ayyad ibn Masud (restored) (1379‚Äì1386) ==See also== *List of Shi'a Muslims dynasties ==References== *Peter Jackson (1986).

This was the first election in Manitoba history to elect members through a single transferable ballot in all constituencies. Ten candidates were elected in Winnipeg, while every other constituency returned members by instant runoff voting. The result was a second consecutive victory for the Progressive Party of Manitoba, which was supported by the United Farmers of Manitoba. The Progressives, led by Premier John Bracken, won twenty-nine seats out of fifty- five to win their second majority government. During the campaign, the Progressives stressed that they were not a party in the traditional sense and promised \\"A business (not a party) government\\". Many Progressive candidates simply described themselves as Bracken supporters. The Conservatives won fifteen seats under the leadership of Fawcett Taylor, an improvement from seven in the election of 1922. This election re-established the Conservatives as the leading opposition party in Manitoba, and made the party a credible challenger for government in the next election. The Manitoba Liberal Party was unable to regain the support it lost to the Progressive Party in the previous election. The Liberals won seven seats under the new leadership of Hugh Robson, down one from their 1922 total. After the election, many senior Liberals began to work for an electoral alliance with the Progressives. Robson, who opposed this plan, was persuaded to resign as leader in 1930. The alliance was formalized in 1932. The Independent Labour Party fell to three seats, down from six in the previous election. All three members, including party leader John Queen, were elected in the city of Winnipeg. Independent candidate John Edmison was also re-elected in Brandon. Jacob Penner ran in Winnipeg as a Communist candidate, but was not successful. ==Results== { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\\" - bgcolor=\\"darkgray\\" !rowspan=2 colspan=2Party !rowspan=2Party Leader !rowspan=2# of candidates !colspan=3Seats !colspan=3Popular Vote - bgcolor=\\"darkgray\\" align=\\"center\\"1922 align=\\"center\\"Elected align=\\"center\\"% Change align=\\"center\\"# align=\\"center\\"% align=\\"center\\"% Change align=\\"center\\" John Bracken align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 28 align=\\"right\\" 29 align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"32.4% align=\\"right\\"  Conservative align=\\"center\\" Fawcett Taylor align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 7 align=\\"right\\" 15 align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"27.2% align=\\"right\\"  Liberal align=\\"center\\" Hugh Robson align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 8 align=\\"right\\" 7 align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"20.7% align=\\"right\\"  Independent Labour align=\\"center\\" John Queen align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 6 align=\\"right\\" 3 align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"10.5% align=\\"right\\" align=\\"center\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"  colspan=2Independent align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 1 align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" - colspan=3 Total align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" 55 align=\\"right\\" 55 align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\" align=\\"right\\"100% align=\\"right\\" } ==See also== * List of Manitoba political parties ==Results by electoral division== Quotas in the single-member districts are the simple majority (50 percent plus 1).

If any more fuel were to be injected then black smoke would result. At wide open throttle, manifold vacuum decreases. The higher manifold pressure in turn allows more air to enter the combustion cylinders, and thus additional fuel is required to balance the combustion reaction. The additional air and fuel reacting together produce more power. ==References== Category:Engine technology ","title":"Wide open throttle"},{"id":"2228306","text":"A jivan mukta or muktaThe Vivekac≈´·∏çƒÅma·πái of ≈öa·πÖkarƒÅcƒÅrya BhagavatpƒÅda: An Introduction and Translation edited by John Grimes \\"A mukta is a mukta, with or without a body.110 It may be said that a knower of the Self with a body is a Jivan Mukta and when that person sheds the body, he attains Videhamukti.

S√©rie in-8¬∞, Fasc. 61, √âdition-Diffusion de Boccard (Paris), , pages 1-9 A Jivanmukti is also called atma-jnani (self-realized) because they are the knowers of their true self (atman) and the universal self hence also called as Brahma-Jnani. At the end of their lives, jivanmuktas destroy remaining karmas and attains Paramukti (final liberation) and becomes Paramukta. When a Jivanmukti gives his insight to others and teach them about his realisation of the true nature of the ultimate reality (Brahman) and self (Atman) and takes the role of a guru to show the path of Moksha to others, then that jivanmukta is called as Avadhuta and some Avadhutas also achieves the title of Paramhamsa. When a Rishi (Seer sage) becomes a Jivanmukta then that rishi is called Brahmarshi. Some of the examples of Jivan Mukta are Mahavira, Buddha, Adi Shankaracharya, Saint Dnyaneshwar, Kabirdas, Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Ramakrishna Paramahansa, Ramana Maharshi, Vishwamitra, etc. They realized Self (atman) i.e. God within their lifetime by travelling the path of pure Spirituality. They reached the stage of Enlightenment, Self- Realization, God-Realization, Jivan-mukti, Atma-jnana(all words are synonyms). They have negated the karma to zero, to reach the state of Jivan-Mukta. After gaining enlightenment, they retained their body, to disseminate the Jnana to masses. After leaving the body, they attained the Paramukti. ==Etymology== Jivanmukta (‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§) is an adjective derived from a combination of Sanskrit noun ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ jiva, \\"life\\", and the past participle of the verb ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ö‡•ç (much, or IAST muc), \\"to liberate\\". Monier-Williams gives the meaning \\"emancipated while still alive\\". Jivanmukti (‡§ú‡•Ä‡§µ‡§®‡•ç‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø), the corresponding abstract noun means, \\"liberation during life, liberation before death\\", or \\"emancipation while still alive\\".Jivanmukti, Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany This is the only meaning given in authoritative dictionaries of classical Sanskrit, including Monier-Williams. Other translations, not found in standard dictionaries and therefore presumably of more modern date, include \\"self realization\\", \\"living liberation\\", \\"enlightenment\\", \\"liberated soul\\", or \\"self liberation\\". ==Description== The various texts and schools of Hinduism describe Jivanmukti state of existence as one of liberation and freedom reached within one's life.See for example Muktika Upanishad, Varaha Upanishad, Adhyatma Upanishad, Sandilya Upanishad, Tejobindu Upanishad, etc.; in K.N.

For example, according to Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad, the enlightened individual shows attributes such as:see: K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada, pp 140-147 * S. Nikhilananda (1958), Hinduism: Its meaning for the liberation of the spirit, Harper, , pp. 53‚Äì79; * Andrew Fort (1998), Jivanmukti in Transformation, State University of New York Press, * his consciousness of individuality has disappeared; * he is not bothered by disrespect and endures cruel words, treats others with respect regardless of how others treat him; * when confronted by an angry person he does not return anger, instead replies with soft and kind words; * even if tortured, he speaks and trusts the truth; * he does not crave for blessings or expect praise from others; * he never injures or harms any life or being (ahimsa), he is intent in the welfare of all beings;see also Sandilya Upanishad for ahimsa and other virtues; Quote: \\"‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡§®‡•ã‡§µ‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ø‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ‡§≠‡§ø‡§É ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡•á‡§∑‡•Å ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§¶‡§æ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§≤‡•á‡§∂‡§ú‡§®‡§®‡§Æ‡•ç\\"; Aiyar translates this as: He practices Ahimsa - no injury or harm to any living being at any time through actions of his body, his speech or in his mind; K.N. Aiyar (Transl. 1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Robart Library Archives, Canada, pp 173-174 * he is as comfortable being alone as in the presence of others; * he is as comfortable with a bowl, at the foot of a tree in tattered robe without help, as when he is in a mithuna (union of mendicants), grama (village) and nagara (city); * he does not care about or wear sikha (tuft of hair on the back of head for religious reasons), nor the holy thread across his body. To him, knowledge is sikha, knowledge is the holy thread, knowledge alone is supreme. Outer appearances and rituals do not matter to him, only knowledge matters; * for him there is no invocation nor dismissal of deities, no mantra nor non-mantra, no prostrations nor worship of gods, goddess or ancestors, nothing other than knowledge; * he is humble, high spirited, of clear and steady mind, straightforward, compassionate, patient, indifferent, courageous, speaks firmly and with sweet words. ==Advaita view== Adi Shankara explains that nothing can induce one to act who has no desire of his own to satisfy. The supreme limit of vairagya (\\"detachment\\"), is the non-springing of vasanas in respect of enjoyable objects; the non-springing of the sense of the \\"I\\" (in things which are the ƒÅnatman) is the extreme limit of bodha (\\"awakening\\"), and the non-springing again of the modifications which have ceased is the extreme limit of Uparati (\\"abstinence\\"). The Jivanmukta gains divine and infinite knowledge and has complete self-knowledge and Self-realization, a Jivanmukta by reason of his ever being Brahman, is freed from awareness of external objects and no longer aware of any difference between the inner atman and Brahman and between Brahman and the world, he knows the he is same as Brahman and has an ever experiencing infinite consciousness. \\"Vijnatabrahmatattvasya yathapurvam na samsrtih\\" ‚Äì \\"there is no sa·πÉsƒÅra as before for one who has known Brahman\\". There are three kinds of prarabdha karma: Ichha (\\"personally desired\\"), Anichha (\\"without desire\\") and Parechha (\\"due to others' desire\\"). For a self realized person, a Jivanamukta, there is no Ichha-Prarabdha but the two others, Anichha and Parechha, remain, which even a jivanmukta has to undergo. According to the Advaita school, for those of wisdom Prarabdha is liquidated only by experience of its effects; Sancita (\\"accumulated karmas\\") and Agami (\\"future karmas\\") are destroyed in the fire of Jnana (\\"knowledge\\"). The term Paramukti is commonly used to refer to final liberation, which occurs upon the death of the body of someone who has attained Jivanmukti or Kaivalya during his or her lifetime. It implies the ultimate release of the soul (atman) from the Sa·πÉsƒÅra and karma and merger of the atman in Brahman, so when a Jivanmukta dies he becomes a Paramukta. In the Hindu view, when an ordinary person dies and his physical body disintegrates, the person's unresolved karma causes his atman to pass on to a new birth; and thus the karmic inheritance is reborn in one of the many realms of samsara. However, when a person attains Jivanmukti, he is liberated from karmic rebirth. When such a person dies and his physical body disintegrates, his cycle of rebirthing ends and he become one with Brahman, then that person is said to have achieved Paramukti and became a Paramukta, so, a Jivanmukta has a body while a Paramukta is bodyless and pure. When a Jivanmukta attains the state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi then he or she can become a Paramukta by his or her own will. A Jivanmukta who has attained the state of nirvikalpa samadhi, will, at an appropriate time, consciously exit from their body and attains Paramukti. This act of consciously and intentionally leaving one's body is called as Mahasamadhi. In the ≈õrama·πáic traditions, the jivanmukta is called an arhat in Buddhism and arihant in Jainism. ==Implication== The Advaita school holds the view that the world appearance is owing to avidya (ignorance) that has the power to project i.e. to superimpose the unreal on the real (adhyasa), and also the power to conceal the real resulting in the delusion of the Jiva who experiences objects created by his mind and sees difference in this world, he sees difference between the ƒÅtman (\\"the individual self\\") and Brahman (\\"the supreme Self\\"). This delusion caused by ignorance is destroyed when ignorance itself is destroyed by knowledge. When all delusion is removed there remains no awareness of difference. He who sees no difference between Self and Brahman is said to be a Jivanmukta. Jivanmukta experience infinite knowledge, infinite power and infinite bliss while alive and also after death i.e., after becoming Paramukta, while Videhmukta experiences these only after death. There are four stages for becoming a Jivanmukta:‚Äì 1\\\\. SƒÅlokya ‚Äì living in the same world. 2\\\\. SƒÅr≈´pya ‚Äì having the same form 3\\\\. SƒÅmƒ´pya ‚Äì being close to 4\\\\. SƒÅyujya ‚Äì merging into. STAGE 1. The first stage is called sƒÅlokya ‚Äî corresponding to the waking state of consciousness (jƒÅgrata) ‚Äî the realization that the entire vast universe of billions of galaxies and universes is all pervaded by the Divine Consciousness. (Vi·π£·πáu means That which pervades the entire universe and everything in it.) It is the undifferentiated Ocean of Being. When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from the idea that the world is separate and independent from us and is an ultimate source of abiding pleasure and joy. STAGE 2. The second stage is sar≈´pya or sadhƒÅrmya ‚Äî corresponding to the dreaming state of consciousness ‚Äì realization that every being is interconnected and all \\"apparently\\" separate jivas are embodiments of the One Divine Consciousness. When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from aha·πÖkƒÅra - the notion of self-identity and the notion of difference and the other, thus being able to cultivate empathy with all and universal compassion for all beings. STAGE 3. The third stage samƒ´pya ‚Äî is intimacy with the Divine ‚Äî corresponding to the unconscious dreamless state of consciousness ‚Äì God-realization occurs when the nature of the sagu·πáa ƒ´≈õvara is cognized and one surrenders to Him/Her. When this stage is achieved then the person gets the freedom from all self-effort to achieve liberation, freedom from religion and its bondage and the relinquishing of all self-imposed burdens ‚Äì achieving a state of equanimity, tranquility, abiding joy and peace. STAGE 4. The final stage sƒÅyujya ‚Äî communion with, or unification with the Absolute Godhead ‚Äî corresponding to the Turiya or inconceivable and inexpressible fourth state of consciousness ‚Äì a merging with the Godhead bordering on complete identity. When this stage is achieved then the person becomes a complete Jivanmukta and gets the absolute freedom from rebirth and suffering ‚Äîthis is the final stage of Brahma-nirvƒÅna. ==Significance== The Advaita philosophy rests on the premise that noumenally the Absolute alone exists, Nature, Souls and God are all merged in the Absolute; the Universe is one, that there is no difference within it, or without it; Brahman is alike throughout its structure, and the knowledge of any part of it is the knowledge of the whole (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad II.4.6-14), and, since all causation is ultimately due to Brahman, since everything beside Brahman is an appearance, the Atman is the only entity that exists and nothing else. All elements emanated from the Atman (Taittiriya Upanishad II.1) and all existence is based on Intellect (Aitareya Upanishad III.3). The universe created by Brahman from a part of itself is thrown out and re-absorbed by the Immutable Brahman (Mundaka Upanishad I.1.7). Therefore, the Jiva (the individual self) is non- different from Brahman (the supreme Self), and the Jiva, never bound, is ever liberated. Through Self-consciousness one gains the knowledge of existence and realizes Brahman. ==References== Category:Hindu philosophical concepts ","title":"Jivanmukta"},{"id":"2228310","text":"Arakkonam (), previously Arkonam is one of the most important railway towns in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu connecting major cities such as Bangalore, Mumbai, Goa, Vijayawada, Tirupathi, Coimbatore, Kochi and thiruvananthapuram.

The band was formed in 1994 and has released 6 studio albums to date. == Biography == Savoy, unlike Waaktaar-Savoy's other band A-ha, has a more down-to-earth indie rock approach to their music. All songs are composed by Paul Waaktaar-Savoy and Lauren Savoy. Lauren herself is known as a film maker, and Frode Unneland is one of Norway's best drummers known from the Bergen music scene as drummer with Chocolate Overdose and Popium. He has also drummed for Norwegian singer-songwriter Sondre Lerche. Savoy have achieved great critical success in Norway. They have been nominated for 3 Norwegian Grammy Awards (Spellemannprisen) and won two of them, in 2000 and 2002. Their most known hits include \\"Velvet\\" (also covered by A-ha), \\"Rain\\", \\"Star\\", \\"Grind You Down\\", \\"If You Won't Come to the Party\\" and \\"Whalebone\\" (from the soundtrack of the well-acclaimed Norwegian film Hawaii, Oslo). The latter track cleverly recycles lyrics from A-ha's 1993 track, \\"Locust\\". Savoy have sold a total of 200,000 albums. On August 6, 2007, Savoy released Savoy Songbook Vol. 1, a double-CD where CD2 is a \\"best of\\"-album with 14 tracks, and CD1 contains three new songs and seven re-worked versions of some of their older songs. It will work as an introduction to the band outside Norway (noting a possible worldwide release). The first single from this release, \\"Karma Boomerang\\", is one of the new tracks and was released on 13 April 2007. The second single was announced as \\"Best Western Beauty\\" and was released on August 5, 2007. Savoy signed a UK deal with indie label Genepool Records. In 2016, it was announced that the band's back catalogue would be remastered and re-released by Apollon Records. Lackluster Me and Mountains of Time were subsequently re-released in 2016 and 2017 respectively. As of 2020, the remaining albums have not been re- released. After some speculation and social media posts confirming recording in 2015, Savoy's first studio album in 14 years, See the Beauty in Your Drab Hometown, was released on January 12, 2018. ==Band members== ;Current members *Paul Waaktaar-Savoy - Vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards *Lauren Savoy - Vocals, guitar *Frode Unneland - Drums, backing vocals ;Guest musicians *Greg Calvert - Bass (1995‚Äì1997) *Geir Luedy - Bass (1997‚Äì1998) *Maya Vik - Bass (2004) *Christer Ottesen - Bass (2004) *J√∏run B√∏geberg - Bass *Preben Grieg-Halvorsen - Keyboards *Erin Hill - Harp, backing vocals *Linn Fr√∏kedal - Keyboards (2018) *Chris Holm - Bass (2018) == Discography Studio albums=== {  - !Year !Title !Label - 1996 Mary Is Coming rowspan=\\"1\\"Warner Bros. - 1997 Lackluster Me rowspan=\\"3\\"EMI - 1999 Mountains of Time - 2001 Reasons to Stay Indoors - 2004 Savoy rowspan=\\"1\\"Eleventeen Records - 2018 See The Beauty In Your Drab Hometown Drabant Music } ===Compilation=== {  - !Year !Title !Label - 2007 Savoy Songbook Vol. 1 rowspan=\\"1\\"Universal } ==External links== *Savoy on Myspace Official Savoy Myspace site * https://web.archive.org/web/20110427032004/http://savoy.aha-fr.com/ French fan site Category:A-ha Category:Norwegian musical trios Category:Musical groups established in 1994 ","title":"Savoy (band)"},{"id":"2228321","text":"Henry Meadows, usually known simply as Meadows, of Wolverhampton, England were major suppliers of engines and transmissions to the smaller companies in the British motor industry. Founded in 1920 in Park Lane, Wolverhampton, as a car gearbox maker, they expanded into petrol engines in 1922 and in the 1930s built a large factory in Fallings Park, Wolverhampton. ==ProductsPetrol engines=== 4¬Ω-litre engine in an Invicta car, 1931 Early production was connected with the move from W.H. Dorman & Co of the Dorman works manager (W.H. Dorman's son, John E. Dorman) in August 1921, and a design engineer Mr R.S. Crump. Dorman had been producing engines from 1903. The early Meadows engines and gearboxes were produced with Meadows-Dorman on the castings. This resulted in a court case between Dorman and Meadows, claiming that this was a misuse of the Dorman name and reputation. Dorman won the case One of the most popular petrol engines was the 1¬Ω-litre four-cylinder Type 4ED engine (following their less powerful 4EB and 4EC engines, used by several makers in the pre 1931 period), widely used by Frazer Nash and Lea-Francis during the 1920s and 30s, and in the H.R.G. light car from 1936 to 1939 which was sold with a guaranteed top speed of 90 mph.The Light Car, C.F. Caunter, HMSO, 1970, p95 Another successful product, the 4¬Ω-litre 6-cylinder engine is best remembered as the power unit for Invicta and Lagonda cars. Meadows also produced marine engines after a visit from Hubert Scott-Paine in 1931 who was looking for some better engines for his prototype seaplane tender (RAF200) which was fitted at that time with Brooks engines. After some modification to allow the engines to be angled at 17 degrees, the British Power Boat Company selected Meadows 6-cylinder petrol engines for the high-speed seaplane tenders, each having two engines rated at 100 bhp, and being capable of 29 knots. In the 1930s Meadows developed a flat-12 type-MAT/1 engine of 8858cc for military applications including the Tetrarch Light Tank. Later they built a 16litre 300 bhp flat-12 type-DAV petrol engine used in the Covenanter tank This engine was also used in the prototype A20 tank, although this weighed more than twice the Covenanter and so was considered underpowered. The later, and widely used, A22 Churchill tank was a development of the A20. Partly to provide more power, and also to improve production time, this was instead powered by a Vauxhall flat-12 engine termed the \\"Twin-Six\\", as it was based on two pre-existing Bedford six-cylinder lorry engines. This engine was slightly more powerful, but only to a rated 350 bhp. The Guy Armoured Car, made in 1939‚Äì1940, used the Meadows 4-cylinder 4-ELA petrol engine. Meadows also made the 600 bhp Rolls-Royce Meteor V-12 petrol tank engine from 1944. This came about because Rolls-Royce Merlin engines came under the Ministry of Aircraft Production, but tank engines came under the Ministry of Supply, and the huge demand for the Merlin engine was causing Meteor production to falter and this was in turn affecting Cromwell tank production. Meadows was already involved with the Ministry of Supply, so they were brought in from 1944 to manufacture Meteor engines to cover the shortfall.Cromwell Cruiser Tank 1942‚Äì1950, David Fletcher, Osprey Publishing, 2012 The Rover Company also produced Meteor engines in this period. ===Diesel engines=== Meadows started developing diesel engines in the 1930s, and a 5-litre 4-cylinder diesel developing 75 bhp at 2000rpm was launched at the 1935 Olympia Motor Transport Show.The Modern Diesel, 11th Edition, G.G. Smith, Iliffe & Sons Ltd, 1949 They introduced a 6-cylinder 100 bhp version in 1938. Both of these engines used a Lanova combustion chamber design, CAV injector pumps, and they were listed both for road transport and marine use. In 1938 they supplied diesel engines for the New Zealand Railways Standard class railcars. After World War II they resumed making diesel engines, but with a completely new design this time with direct injection and toroidal cavity pistons. The 6.9 litre 4-cylinder unit gave 85 bhp at 1800rpm, and the 10.35 litre 6-cylinder unit developed 150 bhp at 1800rpm. These were aimed at both vehicle, marine, and stationary markets, and there was a horizontal version of the 6-cylinder unit for flat underfloor mounting. The same two engines were rated at 60 and 90 bhp for continuous marine use at 1600rpm, and a larger engine of similar design rated at 130 bhp and of 15.5 litres capacity was also listed. One of the unusual features of these engines is the ability to swap the utilities from side to side and from end to end, which also allows for making handed-engines for twin-engined marine craft. For marine use helical reduction gears of different ratios, and epicyclic reversing gears were also available. Many engines were supplied to their neighbour in Fallings Park, Guy Motors for use in their buses and trucks. A small number of diesel engines was supplied for British Rail Railbuses in 1958. They also powered the Fowler Challenger crawler tractors, the 6DC-630 in the Mk III, and the 6DJ-970 in the Mk IV. Meadows adverts show they were also used in plant like rock-crushers, ditch diggers, compressors and other equipment used in road building. They were also used to power military FV2502 27.5kVA generator sets.

After engines were introduced in 1922 they sold complete engine, clutch, and gearbox packages, initially with either 3 or 4 speed gearboxes, and later with 4 or 5 speed gearboxes. During the early 1950s, Meadows supplied gearboxes for the Jowett Javelin car.Images of Motoring: Jowett Cars by Noel Stokoe () ===Cars=== They were also responsible for making the Meadows Frisky microcar between 1957 and 1961. ==Merger and closure== In 1965, Henry Meadows was purchased by Jaguar.Jaguar buy Meadows Commercial Motor 1 January 1965 page 20Jaguar Acquires Meadows Railway Transportation March 1965 page 8 ==References External links == * Information from Wolverhampton Local History Category:Engine manufacturers of the United Kingdom Category:Diesel engine manufacturers Category:Motor vehicle engine manufacturers Category:Manufacturing companies based in Wolverhampton Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1920 Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of the United Kingdom Category:1920 establishments in England ","title":"Henry Meadows"},{"id":"2228334","text":"NEG is an abbreviation that may refer to: * the IATA code for Negril Aerodrome in Jamaica * Net energy gain * New economic geography, a sub-field of Economic geography * Non-evaporable getter, a material used in high vacuum technology * Negative (disambiguation), in various contexts, and a common military command * Negotiator, e.g. estate agent * National Express, a UK-based transport group * NEG Micon, now part of Vestas * Nippon Electric Glass, a Japanese glass manufacturer * Noah Eli Gordon, an American poet * National Energy Guarantee, an energy policy in Australia It may also refer to someone with the name Neg: * Neg Dupree, of Neg's Urban Sports ","title":"NEG"},{"id":"2228347","text":"The World Scrabble Championship 1999 was the fifth World Scrabble Championship and was held at the Carlton Crest Hotel, Melbourne, Australia. The winner was Joel Wapnick of Canada. This was the second time a player representing Canada has won, the first being when David Boys won in 1995. The 1991 champion, Peter Morris, was also a Canadian but represented the United States. Eight games were played on each of the first three days with the top two players advancing to a best-of-five finals. In the first game, Wapnick opened with the bingo CHAPLET and took a 249-60 lead three turns later with the double -double FILTHIER then cruised to a 624-307 victory. Nyman took the second game and Wapnick took the third then got off to an early lead in the fourth before losing a turn when he tried the phony FUROUR. The game remained tight, with both players getting down two bingos, until Wapnick drew the X and DEOXY for 50 to take a one -point lead and take the last tile out of the bag. With Wapnick having multiple places to go out, Nyman was unable to catch him and lost by a single point. Joel Wapnick could now add a world title to his US national title and Canadian title, one of only two players to have won the big three. ==Complete Results== {  - bgcolor=\\"#ececec\\" !Position !Name !Country !Win-Loss !Spread !Prize (USD) -

The law school sits in Arlington, roughly 15 miles east- northeast of the university's main campus in Fairfax. U.S. News & World Report ranks the school 42nd among American law schools, and it is the 3rd-highest- ranked law school in the Washington metropolitan area, behind Georgetown University Law Center and George Washington University Law School. In 2017, the school had 525 students in its J.D., LL.M., JD/MBA, and JD/MPP programs. The median LSAT score among incoming J.D. students in 2018 was 163 and the median GPA was 3.76. The passage rate for first-time takers of the Virginia bar exam in July 2017 was 80.33%, fifth among Virginia's eight law schools. ==Rankings== * 45th-best law school ‚Äì U.S. News and World Report * 21st ‚Äì Scholarly impact of the faculty based on per capita citations to faculty scholarship. * 4th-best part-time law program ‚Äì U.S. News and World Report * 44th-best law school in the US ‚Äì Times Higher Education * 19th-best law school in the US ‚Äì Academic Ranking of World Universities ==History== George Mason University School of Law was authorized by the Virginia General Assembly in March 1979 and was founded on July 1, 1979. The school had started as the \\"International School of Law\\" (ISL), which opened in 1972 in a classroom at the Federal Bar Building on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, DC. In 1973, it moved into the home of former United States Chief Justice Edward Douglass White on Rhode Island Avenue, and in 1975 purchased the old Kann's Department Store in Arlington. Despite growth, ISL could never obtain accreditation. In 1976, it discussed a merger with George Mason University, which was interested in setting up a law school. In 1978, the Virginia State Council of Education denied GMU's proposal to start a law school and encouraged a merger with ISL instead. Later that year, the Council advised against allowing that merger, but the Virginia state legislature nonetheless approved the merger in early March 1979. The school became fully accredited by the American Bar Association in 1986, but was still not widely known during the late 1980s. Since then, however, its rankings have risen rapidly. In 2016, the school was offered $30 million to rename itself for Antonin Scalia, the late United States Supreme Court justice: $10 million from the Charles Koch Foundation and $20 million from an anonymous donor. On March 31, its Board of Visitors approved the deal. School officials soon announced that the new name would be \\"The Antonin Scalia School of Law\\", but changed their minds after observers noted that this could be abbreviated \\"ASSLaw\\". Several days later, school officials announced a new new name: Antonin Scalia Law School, a decision ratified by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia on May 17. === Conservatism === The law school has a reputation for conservative teaching which increased with the renaming in 2016 for Scalia, who was a conservative. The Washington Post editorial board wrote that \\"university officials aren‚Äôt fooling anyone if they contend that naming the school after such a polarizing figure doesn‚Äôt give it an ideological brand.\\" In 2019, the law school received a gift of $50 million, the largest ever received by the university, from the estate of Allison and Dorothy Rouse to \\"fund a chair or chairs that will promote the conservative principles of governance, statesmanship, high morals, civil and religious freedom and the study of the United States Constitution\\". The university has accepted donations from conservative donors in exchange for allowing the donors to have a say in hiring and firing for the Mercatus Center, the university's think tank, and to be notified of any change in the law school's leadership. The Washington Post editorial board called the law school's students and faculty \\"fairly...libertarian- and conservative-leaning\\" David Bernstein, a professor at the law school, wrote that in his experience \\"the average George Mason law school student ‚Äî unlike the average faculty member ‚Äî leans a bit to the moderate left.\\" ==Tuition== The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) for the 2017-18 academic year at Mason Law was $49,219 for in-state students attending full- time; the total cost of attendance for non-resident students attending full- time is $64,605. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $179,567 for residents, and $234,586 for non- residents. To combat the high cost of law school, George Mason's Board of Visitors voted in 2013 to freeze tuition through the 2016-2017 academic year. ==Curriculum== Mason Law is somewhat distinctive in offering a wide variety of intense law tracks, each of which requires that about one-third of the credits for graduation be completed in the track, and law concentrations, which are elective specializations and have a less restrictive credit requirement as compared to the track program. The law tracks include Litigation Law, Patent Law, and Regulatory Law. The law concentrations include Antitrust Law, Communications Law, Corporate and Securities Law, Criminal Law, Homeland & National Security Law, Immigration Law, Intellectual Property Law, International Business Law, Legal and Economic Theory, Litigation Law, Personal Law, Regulatory Law, Tax Law, and Technology Law. Also, the school has a Legal Research, Writing and Analysis (LRWA) curriculum. Mason Law requires its students to complete four semesters (two years) of LRWA coursework. Students acquire the necessary skills for trial and appellate practice. The first-year LRWA curriculum is taught by third-year (and fourth- year evening) law students under the guidance of full-time faculty. During the first semester, students learn how to conduct legal research and write a predictive memorandum, while during the second semester, students compete in intramural oral arguments while producing both predictive and persuasive memoranda. The second year of LRWA is taught by legal practitioners, and consists of Appellate Writing and Legal Drafting. Student transcripts bear a separate grade-point average (GPA) for LRWA and writing-intensive coursework in addition to the overall GPA. Students must successfully complete 89 credits to graduate. ===First-year curriculum=== In addition to two semesters (5 credits total) of LRWA, the first-year curriculum is filled with foundation courses. First-year day students cover the following legal foundation courses: Torts (4 credits), Contracts (5 credits), Property (4 credits), Civil Procedure (4 credits), Legislation and Statutory Interpretation (2 credits), and Criminal Law (3 credits). In addition, every student is required to complete one semester of \\"Economic Foundations of Legal Studies,\\" a basic economics course taught by distinguished economists. First-year students may not take any electives. The first-year students are graded according to a mandatory 3.25 curve. ===Second-year curriculum=== In their second year of study, day students must complete a 4-credit Constitutional Law course and complete an additional 4 credits of LRWA. Students may select from a variety of upper-level electives in addition to these requirements. ==Employment== According to George Mason's official ABA-required disclosures, 56% of the Class of 2014 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. Ten months after graduation, 84% of the Class of 2014 was employed in or about to begin full-time jobs requiring bar passage or jobs for which a J.D. provides an advantage. George Mason's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 16.8%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2014 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non- professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. ==Law library== The George Mason Law Library has a collection of electronic and print materials providing access to legal treatises, journals, and databases. Non-legal materials are available through the GMU University Libraries. It is a selective depository for U.S. Government documents, and it provides interlibrary lending services with other academic libraries, which enables students and faculty to borrow materials from major academic libraries. The library occupies four levels of the law school building.

In particular, they opposed a federal open-access mandate in 2020. Other Antonin Scalia Law School professors were criticised by lawmakers for their conflict of interest within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as they advocated for policies favorable to financial corporations which were also their paying clients. The Antonin Scalia Law School partially overlapped at times with the George Mason Environmental Law Clinic or Free Market Environmental Law Clinic, which merged with the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E; Legal) (formerly the American Tradition Institute (ATI)), known for its climate science denialism and funded by the coal industry. Antonin Scalia Law School leadership in one occasion ¬´admonished the professors for engaging in \\"irresponsible advocacy\\"¬ª which had the goal to receive corporate donations in return for attacks on climate science. ==JournalsStudent-edited=== * George Mason Law Review () * George Mason Civil Rights Law Journal () * Journal of International Commercial Law * National Security Law Journal () * The Journal of Law, Economics & Policy () ===Other=== * The Green Bag (second series), created by professor Ross Davies. * Supreme Court Economic Review, published by University of Chicago Press in conjunction with the Law and Economics Center at the George Mason University School of Law. * Faculty Working Papers, papers published by the faculty of the school. ==Clinics and externships== * Arts & Entertainment Advocacy Clinic * Mason Veterans and Servicemembers Legal Clinic (MVETS) * Domestic Relations Supervised Externship & Legal Clinic * Law and Mental Illness Legal Clinic * Practical Preparation of Patent Applications * Supreme Court Clinic * Supervised Externship - Fall, Spring, Summer * Capitol Hill Supervised Externship * Virginia Practice Supervised Externship * Regulatory Comments Legal Practicum ==Student organizations== * Alternative Dispute Resolution Society * American Constitution Society * American Inn of Court * Black Law Students Association * Business Law Society * Christian Legal Society * Communications Law Association * Environmental Law Society * Federalist Society * Honor Committee * Immigration Law Society * Intellectual Property Law Society * International Law Society * J.

It is part of the WWE SmackDown vs. Raw (later renamed to WWE 2K) video game series based on the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It is the sequel to 2004's WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw and was succeeded by WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007 in 2006. The main focus of the game is to bring more realism and authenticity to the series with many new features, breaking away from the arcade-like gameplay that earlier games in the SmackDown! series possessed. As well as the addition of the new Buried Alive and Fulfill Your Fantasy matches, the game also included two new modes: General Manager and Create-An-Entrance. This game is the first one in the SmackDown! series to be published for the PlayStation Portable. It is also the last game in the series to be released exclusively for the PlayStation 2. It is the best selling game for the PlayStation 2 console out of the series. A steelbook version of the game was released exclusively in Australia. ==GameplayMatch gameplay=== A new momentum bar has been introduced to determine the flow of the match, replacing the old clean/dirty and SmackDown! meters. If the player chooses their wrestler to fight clean, he/she will be portrayed as a face, If they choose fight dirty, he/she will be portrayed as a heel. The player also has to deal with a stamina bar, which drains as the wrestlers fights; the more elaborate the move, the more the wrestler will be tired. However, this is an optional feature and can be removed in the options menu. The player has to regenerate their stamina bar to prevent becoming completely exhausted and unable to perform. Each character also has a new stamina attribute, making those with a low stamina rating tire more easily. Also included is a new Hardcore attribute, allowing those rated high to inflict more damage to their opponent with weapons. Grapples have been improved, with each character having more specialized grapple types than the previous game's unchangeable group of four grapples. Each character has choice of three out of seven grapples: Power, Speed, Technical, Brawler, Martial Arts, Luchadore, and Old School. Each character has as well a Clean/Dirty grapple and a Submission grapple, making the total of grapples five. A new power Irish whip has been included, giving more offense to the opponent but at the price of draining more stamina. The game includes the SummerSlam, Backlash, ECW One Night Stand, Royal Rumble, No Mercy, No Way Out, Judgment Day, Unforgiven, New Year's Revolution, Vengeance, Vengeance, The Great American Bash, The Great American Bash, Taboo Tuesday, Survivor Series, and WrestleMania 21 PPV arenas, as well as the WrestleMania IX arena. There are also arenas based on each WWE television show (Raw, SmackDown!, Heat, and Velocity). The arena crowd has also improved, with fully 3D characters replacing the mixture of 3D and 2D characters in the previous games. ===Roster=== WWE Smackdown! vs. Raw 2006 features the video game debuts of 20 superstars, as well as the returns of Hulk Hogan (in both his 1980s, nWo \\"Hollywood\\", and 2000s versions) and Stone Cold Steve Austin; both men had been left out from the previous game (and in Hogan's case, WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain) due to their sabbaticals from the company. ===Match types=== WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 includes an improved steel cage match, now allowing the player to escape through the cage's door. The Bra and Panties match has been replaced by a Fulfill Your Fantasy match, which is based on the costume-based diva match that occurred on the Taboo Tuesday pay-per-view event. Unlike the real event which is more battle royal‚Äìbased, this version involves divas stripping their opponents to their bra and panties, spanking and throwing pillow shots instead. In addition, in Exhibition and in General Manager mode, the match can only take place in the SummerSlam arena. The Buried Alive match, a feature requested by players for several years, finally makes its debut. The gameplay of the \\"Buried Alive\\" match is actually more reminiscent of a heavily improved casket match from WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role, in that the player had to trap their opponent in a casket to show a cut scene of the burial. Backstage fights are also improved and now include random people (referees, officials, and WWE personnel), who can be interacted with, backstage passing by during matches. In total, 100 different match types are available. ===Game modes=== The series' trademark Season mode lasts for two in-game years, one for the RAW brand and one for the SmackDown! brand. The objective of the mode is to win both brands' two main championships, the WWE Championship (Raw!) and the World Heavyweight Championship (Smackdown). The mode features 100 different motion-captured cinematic cut scenes, real-time storytelling, and improved voice acting. Players have a choice of five original voices for created superstars. A new 3D customizable locker room is also included. In contrast to the game's predecessor, some of the in-game legends also have voice-overs and are made playable in Season mode. In an interview, THQ designer Bryan Williams confirmed that only 32 superstars (which included Stone Cold Steve Austin, Mankind, and Hulk Hogan) could be used in season mode. Some of the standard characters in the game cannot be used in Season mode. These wrestlers include Steven Richards, Ric Flair, and Eugene. General Manager mode, which could be compared to the Extreme Warfare games and Final Fire Pro Wrestling's Management of the Ring mode, is included for the first time. In this mode, the player takes the role of General Manager for either the SmackDown! or Raw brand. Players begin by picking one of the two brands, followed by a choice of simulating or participating in a draft, where a player can pick a total of 20 Superstars. The player then allocates the championships before beginning the season. This mode goes into depth, with e-mail capabilities, the ability to book matches and statistics of how the fans reacted to the show, among other features. When WrestleMania rolls around, the General Manager of the Year is awarded, along with some unlockable features. As in the previous game, online play is available for those with a Sony Network Adapter. The title belts (including Create-A-Belt creations) can be defended online via a \\"virtual WWE Championship\\" with career leader boards and a permanent ID system that tracks all user stats. Players are also able to trade wrestlers created in the Create-A-Superstar mode with each other online. All arenas are also available for online play, including the unlockable WrestleMania IX Arena. ===Create modes=== The game sports a variety of create modes. Create-A-Belt is a returning feature, with players now able to create Tag Team belts. Along with the created belts is the inclusion of title belts used in WWE during 2005, the WWE, World Heavyweight, Intercontinental, United States, WWE Tag Team, World Tag Team, Women's, and Cruiserweight championships. Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Championship and the WWE Hardcore Championship can also be won and defended in the game. The game also allows the player to defend and challenge for any of the titles in the game in Exhibition mode, a feature which was missing in previous games (after Smackdown 2: Know Your Role). The Create-A-Superstar mode is much the same as the previous installments in this series. SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 adds a few new features, such as new items in the makeup category to give the player's created superstar more realistic facial features (such as wrinkles, a cleft chin, acne, and scars). Also included are new shirts and pants, which while unchangeable in color, look more realistic (as opposed to the \\"painted on\\" look of shirts from previous games). The Create-A-Move-Set mode, much like Create-A-Superstar, remains the same, except for updated and new moves. The Create-A-Stable mode has five pre-made stables such as The Basham Brothers and La R√©sistance. This mode gives players a chance to make wrestler 'groups' of 2-5 wrestlers, give a name for the stable, make an entrance (but not as advanced as the Create-An-Entrance mode) for the stable, and customize their teamwork attributes, deciding on how well they perform as a team in the ring. The game also includes a new Create-An-Entrance mode, allowing the player to customize a wrestler's entrance, down to details such as pyrotechnics, arena lighting, and camera angles. The one-minute limit for all entrances that was enforced in previous games is now abolished. However, it received some criticism in comparison to sister game WWE Day of Reckoning 2 which had more options, no loading times, and was easier to use. ===PlayStation Portable exclusive features=== For the first time in the SmackDown! series, a game is also available on the PlayStation Portable (PSP). Although it is very similar to the PS2 version, there are special features that are exclusive to this version that the PS2 version did not bear. Because of this, to unlock the full features of each game, USB connectivity between the PS2 and PSP is needed. Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts is the exclusive PSP Legend and can only be played in the PS2 version by connecting the PSP to the PS2. However, before the PSP game was released, cheat devices also allowed Roberts to be unlocked. Other notable differences between the PS2 and PSP versions include the lack of in-ring commentary and the inclusion of voiceovers from the more popular wrestlers. The only major problem seen by most gamers were the game's loading times, which were described as \\"abysmally long\\" by GameSpy. They were so long that there was a warning about the load times when a created superstar is chosen for a match. The PSP version includes some features that were not included in the PS2 version. These features include three exclusive minigames that are playable from the start. All of these minigames offer single player and multiplayer modes. In multiplayer mode, players can make use of PSP's Wi-Fi functionality. Each mode allows up to four players to join in and play over a local connection. The first minigame, WWE Game Show, tests the knowledge of wrestling fans by offering 500 multi-layered wrestling questions. The WWE Game Show covers every wrestling topic imaginable including costumes, trends, music, finishers, styles, history, feuds, and more. Most questions include excerpts of songs and have players guess the tune or players are shown a video clip and must guess the match the clip is from. The questions range from easy to extremely difficult. Other minigames include a poker game and Eugene's airplane game in which the player navigates Eugene around the ring in the fastest time. ==Reception== The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews on both platforms, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game was praised by some critics for its depth of content. A GameSpot reviewer mentioned \\"the sheer breadth of content makes it an easy choice for any wrestling enthusiast, and quite possibly the best wrestling game available for the system.\\" Comparisons with the game and the highly acclaimed Nintendo 64 game WWF No Mercy were made, with some reviewers putting the game on par with No Mercy. An IGN reviewer commented that \\"there's no other wrestling game since No Mercy that offers this much replay, value, or depth\\", while a Netjak reviewer quoted, \\"WWF No Mercy on the Nintendo 64 ruled as the best wrestling game, but WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 is the new standard.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave the PlayStation 2 version a score of three eights and one seven for a total of 31 out of 40. However, there were some complaints for the game's limitations of game modes. Critics such as X-Play's reviewer felt that the General Manager mode \\"does not go as far as it should--no underhanded options --but it's a great start,\\" while an eToychest reviewer quoted about the Season mode \\"for the first time through this more visual style of story has a lot going for it, but gameplay is about replayability, which is something that is sorely lacking here due to the limit placed on possible story arcs.\\" From the game's release up until December 2006, the game sold 3.3 million copies. The PlayStation 2 version received a \\"Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 300,000 copies in the United Kingdom. On 23 October 2006, the game was added to Sony's Greatest Hits collection. ==See also== *List of licensed wrestling video games *List of fighting games *List of video games in the WWE 2K Games series ==References * Category:2005 video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 2 games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:THQ games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:WWE Raw video games Category:WWE SmackDown video games Category:Yuke's games Category:Professional wrestling games ","title":"WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006"},{"id":"2228373","text":"Eastern and Central Europe around 750 BC The Basarabi culture was an archaeological culture in Southeastern Europe (mainly in Romania), dated between 8th - 7th centuries BC. It was named after Basarabi, a village in Dolj County, south-western Romania, nowadays an administrative component of the Calafat municipality. It is sometimes grouped with related Bosut culture, into the Bosut-Basarabi complex. The Basarabi culture is related to the Hallstatt culture of the Iron Age period that, when normalised, is uniformly spread apart from a reduced number of sites in Muntenia, the central Moldavian Carpathians and Oltenia. The Hallstatt A (12-11th BC) and B (10-8th BC) corresponds to the late Bronze Age, Hallstatt C (7th BC) to the early Iron Age, and Hallstatt D (6th BC) to the Iron Age. The Hallstatt culture probably consisted of many different peoples and language groups. The variant known as the Basarabi culture was present over much of Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia (Vojvodina), and central Moldavia up to the Dniester River (Nistru in Romanian) around 650 BC. During this period the Greeks founded cities along the Black Sea coast and the first written records describe their encounters with the indigenous people.

Founded in 1999, it was the first new CPS high school to be built in 20 years. It is a selective enrollment school, and teaches only at the Honors and AP levels (excluding the P.E. department). Northside has earned a reputation for academic excellence, and has been consistently ranked as the #1 high school in Illinois by US News and World Report. In 2014, it was ranked #3 in the nation by Newsweek. The school's establishment, part of former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's plan to reinvent the city's public school system, generated controversy in the city and in the education community. The facilities were built with a $52.5 million budget that critics said could have better served other schools in city. ==History== Founded in 1999, it was the first new Chicago Public School (CPS) high school to be built in 20 years.

Factors considered in the application include a student's grades from 7th grade, standardized test scores, entrance exam scores, and socio-economic status. As of 2016-2017, the demographic makeup of Northside Prep HS was 30.0% white, 19.0% Asian, 29.0% Hispanic, 8.0% black, and 0.4% Native American. As of 2012-2013, 35.5% of the school's students were low- income, 6% were special education students, and 0.7% were limited English learners. ==College admissions and rankings== Northside College Prep is well known for the success of its students in the college admissions process, with over a quarter of the senior class gaining admission to the nation's top universities. Over 99% of the graduating senior class matriculates to college. In addition, the student body as a whole earns a large amount of financial aid from various sources. *In 2018 Northside was rated #2 in Illinois and #82 in the nation by U.S. News and World Report *In 2016 Northside was rated the #8 high school in the nation by \\"Newsweek\\" *In 2014 Northside was rated the #3 high school in the nation by \\"Newsweek\\" *In 2013 Northside was rated #1 in Illinois and #33 in the nation by U.S. News and World Report *In 2011 Northside was rated #1 in Illinois and #24 in the nation by Newsweek *In 2013 Northside was rated the #2 public high school in the nation by \\"The Best Schools.\\" http://www.thebestschools.org/blog/2013/03/27/50-public-high- schools-u-s/ ==Curriculum/scheduling and colloquium== With the exception of physical education classes, all courses in Northside are either Honors or (AP) (Advanced Placement). Northside has 24 advanced placement classes. Northside's math program is unique from most other high schools in that it uses the Interactive Mathematics Program, also known as IMP, instead of a traditional math track. IMP is very writing based, with students writing portfolios and projects instead of simply solving mathematical equations. Aside from four IMP courses, Northside also offers College Math, AP Statistics, AP Calculus BC, AP Calculus AB, and Multi-Variable Calculus. Northside also offers special education services for incoming students with diagnosed disabilities. The school's Office of Specialized Services helps to arrange appropriate accommodations.Special Education Information Given its extremely competitive academic environment, Northside successfully lobbied the Chicago Board of Education to eliminate class rankings. This effort was led by former principal Dr. James Lalley. Northside's classes run on a block schedule. Classes meet twice a week: on Mondays and Thursdays or Tuesdays and Fridays. The school day used to start at 8:16 a.m. and ended at 3:30 p.m. until the 2014‚Äì15 school year when the school day at Northside now starts at 8:00 a.m. and now ends at 3:04 p.m. (except for Colloquium schedule where it ends at 3:01 p.m.). Each block is 100 minutes long with an 8 minute passing period between blocks. Wednesdays are reserved for an approximately three-hour non-credit class on five-day weeks called Colloquium. Dozens of colloquia are offered, with a wide range of interest such as motorcycle repair, computers, robotics, consumer- education, sewing, quilting, art, photography, paper craft, and Asian calligraphy, and each relates to one specific theme that changes every year. Classes are chosen by students twice a year (every semester, or otherwise it is year-long); availability is dependent on popularity and student's year ranking: seniors get first pick, then juniors, sophomores, and lastly freshmen; all of this is done online, through sound programming, with student portals opening at 7 am for students to start registering. There are different dates for different year students. These are the only classes in which students either pass or fail. Colloquium clubs vary from year to year. After colloquium on Wednesdays, Northside College Prep has X and Y block classes. X and Y block classes are classes that students re-pick every week that will help them most that specific week. For instance if a student needs help in math homework they can choose a math tutoring class for either their X or Y block that week (each block used to be about 50 minutes long until the 2014‚Äì15 school year where now X and Y are 60 minutes long). Northside recently implemented and utilizes online student programming, in which students access and select their schedules through internet programming for both classes and colloquium. Courses for the upcoming school year are programmed at the end of the first semester of the current school year. ==Sustainability== In the summer of 2010, Northside installed a 105-panel solar thermal system on the southern half of its roof. These solar panels work to heat the school's pool and have the capacity to provide hot water to the entire school. This project was head by Northside science teacher Mr. Mike Coy, and Alexandra Rojek, Northside's 2011 valedictorian. Located behind the school is the Joy Garden, a continuation of Northside's efforts to become a more sustainable institution. The Joy Garden is a 10,000 square foot situated adjacent to the eastern front of the building and was built entirely through the efforts of students with the help of Urban Habitat Chicago. The garden is equipped with the latest in green technology, including a self-sustainable storm water management system and permeable concrete. However, it is more than just ecologically functional and friendly. This garden was built with a particular emphasis on providing a stimulating environment for special needs students. It extends from a traditional garden environment to one that is accessible to all students. ==Athletics== Northside competes in the Chicago Public League (CPL) and is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA). The Boy's Varsity Cross Country Team won the IHSA Regional title in 2008 and was the City Champion in 2009. The Boy's Varsity Track and Field Team won the IHSA Sectional Title in 2013 and 2016. The Girl's Varsity Cross Country Team won the IHSA Regional title in 2011, 2015, and 2016. The Girls Varsity Cross Country Team won the IHSA Sectional Title in 2016. The Girl's Varsity Cross Country Team was the City Champion in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. The Girl's Varsity Track and Field Team won the IHSA Sectional Title in 2012.

All of them have now been reclassified as Homo erectus, and the genus Sinanthropus is disused. Beginning in the year 1928 to the year 1937, 14 fragmented skulls belonging to the hominids were found in various locations in China. Peking and Chou K‚Äôou-tien are two notable places with fossils found. It has been noted by researchers that it is likely that the found fragmented skulls were brought to the cave after being severed from the bodies they belonged to. This is very likely, because most of the found pieces are teeth and jaws. Some skulls are missing large parts which indicates separation before they were fossilized, not the loss of pieces due to fossilization process. Sinanthropus contained four species: * Peking Man -- Sinanthropus pekinensis (currently Homo erectus pekinensis) * Lantian Man -- Sinanthropus lantianensis (currently Homo erectus lantianensis) * Nanjing Man -- Sinanthropus nankinensis (currently Homo erectus nankinensis) * Yuanmou Man -- Sinanthropus yuanmouensis (currently Homo erectus yuanmouensis) Homo erectus pekinensis == Discovery == Of the four species placed within the genus Sinanthropus, the first to be found were remnants of the Peking man (Sinanthropus pekinensis). The first fossil was retrieved by Otto Zdansky (1894-1988) near the village of Chou K'ou-tien (China) after the Swedish Geologist and Archaeologist Johan Gunnar Andersson (1874-1960) and his colleagues instigated the excavations at the beginning of the 1920's. Many more finds would follow. The Canadian Davidson Black (1884-1934) was the first to identify the fossils as a new hominid genus, Sinanthropus. A substantial part of the originally discovered remains of the Peking man was lost during WWII, when the fossils were transferred to the United States. After the discovery of the Peking Man remnants, other fossils were found which were classified within the genus Sinanthropus. The discovery of the fossils following up the ones of the Peking man were the remnants of the Lantian man in 1963 and consequently the fossils of the Yuanmou man in 1965 and Nanjing man in 1993. The fossils of the Peking man were the most abundant compared to the other species within Sinanthropus with bones belonging to around 40 individuals. From the Lantian man, a mandible and cranium were found, from the Yuanmou man only two incisors and the fossil record of the Nanjing man consists out of two skulls. Because of the variety in different body parts found at the Chou K'ou-tien excavation site, the traumas which some of the remains suffered, and the incompleteness of some of the skeletons, Henri Breuil (1877-1961) suggested in 1929 that Sinanthropus species were cannibalistic. Opposing the cannibalism theory, the idea was raised that the damage on the remains could be the result of animal scavenging, most probably by the Hyena. A study performed in 2001 showed strong evidence for the animal scavenging theory by linking damage done to the bones to Hyena bite-marks. === Missing link === After the discovery of Sinanthropus Pekinensis, Davidson Black first concluded that the found hominid could be the missing link in the discovery of human evolution. Black stated that Sinanthropus supported the theory that mankind originated in central Asia. However, in 1943 Franz Weidenreich (1873-1984) suggested that Sinanthropus could be the ancestor of the modern Chinese, due to their resemblance in facial characters. Nowadays, both theories are seen as invalid and the ‚ÄúOut of Africa‚Äù theory is seen as the most likely, stating that all humans originated from a common African ancestor. == Features == In accordance with the findings of the systematic studies on the fossils, Sinanthropus holds the following phenotypic features. Sinanthropus had an erect posture with similar limbs and trunk to those of modern man but had a different face and head characteristics. The average cranial capacity is assessed to be 1,075cc, which is considerably smaller than the size of the brain of modern humans (1350cc). The facial structure included an extremely broad face, cheekbones which were sharply angled and frontally orientated, a low forehead, enormous eyebrow bones (supraorbital ridges) which protruded forward, broad nasal bones, and big teeth. The stature of Sinantropus was calculated by Weidenreich to be 156 cm for males and 144 cm for females. This contrasts the claims of Soviet anthropologists, who suggested a higher stature, namely 162 cm for males and 152 cm for females. More specificities described by researchers indicated that Sinanthropus had a different jaw than found in gorillas, similar cranial size to Pithecanthropus, and smaller molars than those found in Pithecanthropus. Researchers were also able to conclude that the teeth found were larger in comparison to Neanderthal men found at the time and the upper canine was long, wide, and similar to that of a tusk. At the time, the genus Sinanthropus was distinguished by the massiveness of the bone fragments that were found. The difference in teeth size created variability among the genus. == Controversy == In the 1930s, papers were published regarding the Sinanthropus and they sought to examine the new hominids and their similar features to other discovered hominids. Dr. Weidenreich was a well-known contributor who was also received blame for a controversy surrounding Sinanthropus. He wrote a research paper about the similarities found in Sinanthropus and Pithecanthropus, where he mentioned the cranial size, jaw proportions and teeth size. Another researcher took an opposing stand and stated that Sinanthropus was ‚Äúclearly Neanderthaloid‚Äù. These two conversations may be responsible for sparking the question revolving if Sinanthropus was even to be considered a genus. ==References== __FORCETOC__ Category:Early species of Homo Category:Prehistoric vertebrate genera ","title":"Sinanthropus"},{"id":"2228379","text":"Paul Stanley is a 1978 solo album from American musician Paul Stanley, the singer-songwriter being best known for serving as the rhythm guitarist and lead vocalist of hard rock band Kiss.

He served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives from 1973 to 1975, Philadelphia City Council from 1975 to 1991 and the United States House of Representatives from 1991 to 1995. He was a member of the Democratic Party. ==Early life== Blackwell was born in Whitsett, Fayette County, Pennsylvania on August 1, 1931. After attending West Philadelphia High School, he took a job as a dockworker and briefly pursued a career as a boxer. In 1953, he was drafted into the United States Army and served in the Korean War. Blackwell was a boxing champion during his years in the Army. After his service ended, he returned to the docks as a longshoreman. In 1973, he became the president of the International Longshoremen's Association, Local 1332. ==Pennsylvania politics== Blackwell's professional political career began with election to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives where he served from 1973 to 1975. ===Philadelphia City Council=== \\"Lucien the Solution\\" was best known as a vibrant member of the Philadelphia City Council from 1975 to 1991. While serving on the Council, Blackwell served several terms as Chairman of the Finance Committee, where he led the charge to divest pension funds from businesses doing business in South Africa. Blackwell also sponsored the Philadelphia's first law to create opportunities for minorities and women to compete to obtain city contracts. Blackwell was also heavily involved in legislation to create the Pennsylvania Convention Center and in passing the law that broke Philadelphia's long-standing building height limit, allowing for the construction of Philadelphia's One Liberty Place. Blackwell was perhaps best known for his fiery oratory on the Council floor and for serving as a mentor to the former Philadelphia Mayor (and Council President) John Street. During his City Council tenure, Blackwell was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Philadelphia in both 1979 and 1991. ==United States House of Representatives== Blackwell was elected as a Democrat to the One Hundred Second Congress by special election to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Representative Bill Gray, and reelected to the succeeding Congress. In Congress, Blackwell was a member of the United States House Committee on the Budget and a reliable advocate for President Bill Clinton's economic policies. Blackwell was ultimately an unsuccessful candidate for renomination to the One Hundred Fourth Congress in 1994, losing the primary to Chaka Fattah, and served as lobbyist following his tenure in Congress. On January 24, 2003, Blackwell died at the age of 71. A mural reading \\"Thank you, Mr. Blackwell\\", can be seen at 42nd Street and Haverford Avenue in West Philadelphia. Blackwell's widow, Jannie Blackwell, was formerly a member of the Philadelphia City Council, also representing the Third District, and his son, Thomas, was a former member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. ==See also== *List of African-American United States Representatives ==References== Retrieved on 2008-07-20 *The Political Graveyard * Category:1931 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania Category:Members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Category:African-American state legislators in Pennsylvania Category:American army personnel of the Korean War Category:Philadelphia City Council members Category:Pennsylvania Democrats Category:African-American members of the United States House of Representatives Category:International Longshoremen's Association people Category:Leaders of American trade unions Category:African-American military personnel Category:Military personnel from Philadelphia Category:United States Army soldiers Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:20th-century American politicians ","title":"Lucien Blackwell"},{"id":"2228422","text":"Casimir, Comte de Montrond (1768‚Äì1843) was a French diplomatic agent and the son of a military officer. His mother, Anglique Marie d'Arlus, comtesse de Montrond (died 1827), was a royalist writer, said to be the author of the Troubadour barnois, a song which has the refrain \\"Louis, le fils de Henri, Est prisonnier dans Paris\\". Casimir was imprisoned in 1794 in St. Lazare, where he met a woman. He bought her freedom and his own with 100 louis. They married and crossed to London, but the union proved unhappy, and they were divorced on their return to Paris. Turning to the fashionable world, Casimir de Montrond became famous for his successes. He was the confidant and political agent of Talleyrand, and his inside knowledge of politics enabled him to make a large fortune on the Bourse. In 1809 he was disgraced for some imprudent comments on the imperial system, and exiled from Paris. After spending some time at Antwerp he removed to Spa, where he was on intimate terms with Pauline Borghese, and in 1811 he returned to Antwerp; here he was arrested on Napoleon's orders and sent to the fortress of Ham. After a month's imprisonment, he received permission to reside, under police supervision, at Ch√°tillon-sur-Seine, whence he presently escaped to England. He returned to France at the first Bourbon restoration, and during the Hundred Days was entrusted with a mission to Vienna to convert Talleyrand to Napoleon's interests, to see Metternich and Nesselrode, and to bring back, if possible, Marie Louise and the King of Rome. The second restoration restored him to his social triumphs, though he was always under police supervision, and on Talleyrand's fall he accompanied him to Ch√¢teau de Valen√ßay and continued to help with his intrigues. He followed Talleyrand to London in 1832. Montrond returned to Paris some time before his death in 1843. According to Recollections and Anecdotes of Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Montrond originated the sayings falsely attributed to Talleyrand: ‚ÄúLa parole a √©t√© donn√©e √† l‚Äôhomme pour l‚Äôaider √† cacher sa pens√©e.‚Äù [‚ÄúSpeech was given to man to aid him at concealing his thoughts.‚Äù] ‚ÄúD√©fiez-vous des premiers mouvements ; ils sont presque toujours bons.‚Äù [‚ÄúMistrust first impulses; they are nearly always good.‚Äù] ==References== * ==External links== Category:1768 births Category:1843 deaths Category:19th-century French diplomats Category:Counts of Montrond ","title":"Casimir, Comte de Montrond"},{"id":"2228424","text":"Stephen Edward Claridge (born 10 April 1966) is an English football pundit, coach and former player. He was a pundit for BBC Sport football shows including Football Focus and The Football League Show, until 2015 when he became both manager and a director at newly formed Salisbury.Salisbury FC www.salisburyfc.co.uk Claridge's career was known for its longevity and diversity. Born in Portsmouth, he has spent a number of periods with teams from Hampshire and Dorset, having begun his career with non-league Fareham Town in 1983. After failing to gain a permanent contract at local league club A.F.C. Bournemouth, Claridge spent three years at Weymouth, in his longest single spell with any club. From 1988 till 1996 Claridge played for a number of Football League teams, before moving to Leicester City with whom he played in the Premier League and won the 1997 Football League Cup. In 1998, he moved to Portsmouth, where he was also player manager from 2000 to 2001. After a spell with Millwall, he dropped down to the Southern Premier League to work as player-manager for Weymouth. After this ended in 2004, Claridge played for ten different clubs in a variety of leagues, never spending more than a season with one team. He has played at all levels of English football and has also appeared in 1000 professional or semi-professional football matches. After formally retiring from football in 2007, Claridge moved into media work for the BBC. His experience of the Football League has been used to position him as an expert at that level, though he works across a variety of different football programmes on the BBC. After retirement he occasionally played semi- professional football for clubs in south England, most recently in 2017 for Salisbury. ==Early years== Claridge was born in Portsmouth and grew up in Titchfield, a village near Fareham, and attended Brookfield Community School in Sarisbury Green. He was an adopted child. Claridge initially played for Fareham Town in the Southern League. He got into Football League side Bournemouth, though Claridge again stepped down the leagues after just seven games for Bournemouth to sign for Weymouth. In October 1988 Claridge moved to Crystal Palace for a brief period before opting to join Division Four team Aldershot for season 88‚Äì89. He spent two years with the club before signing with Cambridge United for ¬£75,000. He moved with Cambridge up into the Second Division (which later became the First Division) and stayed with the club for most of the next four years. His tempestuous relationship with manager John Beck, which was exacerbated by Claridge's gambling problems,Cambridge United ‚Äì Former Player News. Cambridge-united.co.uk. Retrieved on 29 October 2011. eventually led to his being sold to Luton Town for only ¬£120,000 in March 1992. With Luton in financial difficulties however he was sold back to Cambridge, for ¬£190,000, just five months later (Beck having left the club by this time). In January 1994 Claridge moved to Birmingham City for ¬£350,000. In 1994‚Äì95, he became the first player since Trevor Francis to score 20 goals in a season for Birmingham, a performance that earned him the club's Player of the Year award. Claridge was transferred to Leicester City for ¬£1.2 million in March 1996. It was at Leicester that Claridge reached the Premiership, scoring winning goals in both the 1996 play-off final that gave Leicester promotion and the 1997 League Cup final replay. In 1997 his autobiography Tales From The Boot Camps, co-written with Ian Ridley, was first published. ==Moves into management== In 1998 Claridge joined hometown club Portsmouth on loan and, following a brief period at Wolverhampton Wanderers, signed for Portsmouth on a permanent basis. From 2000 this was as a player-manager, though Claridge's reign lasted for just twenty-five games before he was demoted. After a period on loan with Millwall, he moved to the London club on a free transfer in 2001. He spent two seasons with Millwall before returning to Weymouth as the club's new player-manager. Weymouth just missed out on promotion to the Football Conference. Following Ian Ridley's resignation as chairman, Claridge also left to return to playing league football. ==Later playing career== In his later playing career, chronologically, Claridge played for Brighton and Hove Albion, Brentford, Wycombe Wanderers, Gillingham, Bradford City and Walsall. In the summer of 2005 he was appointed as manager of Millwall, but following board- room changes he was relieved of his duties after just 36 days, before his team had played any competitive matches. His replacement was Colin Lee.

The winner was David Boys of Canada. A fifteen round, Swiss- paired preliminary event was used to determine initial placement. The top four players then played a three-game round-robin (with the results of the first 15 games carrying over) to determine the finalists, who played a best-of-five final. The first game of the finals was a close one with Sherman winning 431‚Äì421. Sherman missed a bingo (pENTROOF) but at that point, the game was already in the bag. In the second game, many felt that Sherman blundered in his opening play while Boys cruised to an easy 404‚Äì278 victory despite missing ABOmASA early on. Sherman and Boys traded wins again in games three and four, setting up a single game to decide the championship. The final game was a bit of an anti-climax with Boys winning easily 432‚Äì300 (after challenging off Sherman's early phony TWINNERS) to take the World Championship. With two tiles in the bag, Boys chose to bypass a 98-point bingo (LADYBUGS) to block a triple-triple line that Sherman had a 1-in-18 chance of using for the game- winning 212-point PEJORATE.

K. Rowling's Harry Potter series of fantasy novels comprises two distinct societies: the Wizarding World and the Muggle world. In the novels, the Muggle world is the world inhabited by the non-magical majority, with which the Wizarding world exists coextensively, albeit mostly remaining hidden from the non-magical humans. The plot of the series is set in 1990s Britain, but in a veiled and separate shadow society wherein magic is commonly used and practised, and those who can use it live in self-enforced seclusion, hiding their abilities from the rest of the world. The term \\"Wizarding World\\" refers to the global wizard community that lives hidden in parallel with the Muggle world; the different terms refer to different communities within the same area rather than separate planets or worlds. Any new works taking place in this universe are released under the \\"J. K. Rowling's Wizarding World\\" brand. ==Fundamentals== The entire Harry Potter series is set from 1991 to 1998 aside from the opening chapter of the first book, which takes place on 1 November 1981, and the epilogue of the seventh book, which takes place on 1 September 2017. At various points throughout the Harry Potter timeline, flashbacks and flash-forwards depict the 1920s, the 1930s, the 1940s, the 1970s, the 1980s, the 2010s, and the 2020s. The depiction of the Wizarding World is centred on magic, which not only imbues objects such as wands, but is portrayed as an inborn ability. It is also centred on the separation of the wizarding world from the non-wizarding (Muggle) world. Despite being an inherent talent, magic is honed through study of various branches of magic and practical training into a skill. A great deal of effort is expended in keeping the Muggles unaware of magic. Originally the two worlds co-existed; however, persecution of those with magic meant laws have been put in place over the centuries, designed to keep the existence of the magical world hidden from Muggles. The first and most important statute is the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy of 1692. Enchantment of Muggle artefacts is forbidden; under-age wizards are restricted from using magic outside school, and any deliberate revelation of magical ability to the Muggle community is punishable. However, allowances are made for the use of magic in the presence of a Muggle in case of a life-threatening situation (for the wizard or the Muggle). These laws are enforced by the Ministry of Magic, while a special arm of it, the Obliviators, has the job of making certain that Muggles who have seen magic in action will be left with no \\"inconvenient\\" memories. Exceptions to the statute of secrecy include wizards' Muggle relatives and high-ranking political leaders; the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, for instance. As seen in the first chapter of \\"Philosopher's Stone\\", jubilation and euphoria at Voldemort's first downfall in 1981 led to these rules being momentarily ignored and wizards exposing themselves gratuitously to muggles, who were greatly puzzled. Some aspects of the Wizarding World are depicted as being less-than-modern in comparison to the Muggle world, sometimes even old-fashioned or quaint. The technological development of the Wizarding World is substantially behind that of its Muggle counterpart ‚Äî for instance, candles are used for illumination instead of electrical or gas bulbs/tubes ‚Äì and owls, a more cumbersome and slower mode of communication, are used to send messages instead of simple phone calls. On the other hand, an owl can be sent to deliver a message without the sender needing to know the recipient's exact location or phone number. However, a large number of technologically complex devices do exist, and most of these devices exist in the Muggle world. From a certain perspective, it can be seen that Magic and electricity are the equivalents of each other in their respective worlds, but electronic equipment doesn't work around magic-filled areas, such as Hogwarts, and Muggle devices used by wizards (such as cameras and radios) can be made to function using magic instead of electricity. Such examples are rare, however; wizards rarely make use of Muggle technology, nor do they have much interest in doing so, even when such technology might make their lives much easier. Pure-blood Wizards are baffled by how Muggle technology works and most have no interest in understanding it (with occasional exceptions, such as Muggle aficionado Arthur Weasley, whose dearest ambition is \\"to find out how an aeroplane stays up\\"). \\"Muggle Studies\\" classes are offered at Hogwarts for those students with an interest. On several occasions, Harry Potter is tasked with having to explain the workings of commonplace Muggle technology, such as introducing the telephone to Mr Weasley in Chamber of Secrets; at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban, Ron Weasley makes his first telephone call ‚Äì with disastrous results for Harry. The Wizarding World has also not embraced modern Muggle modes of information collection and transfer. For instance, instead of pen/pencil, paper and electronic equipment like computers, Hogwarts students use ink-dipped quills and parchment to take notes and do their homework. Wizarding money is also old-fashioned; whilst Muggle Britain was decimalised in 1971, Magical Britons continued with their system of 17 silver Sickles to a gold Galleon, and 29 bronze Knuts to a Sickle. Also, magical currency is all metal coins, and there is no paper money. The magical world does have at least one train - the Hogwarts Express - pulled by a steam locomotive. There is radio but no television is shown. Magical brooms are mass-produced, with new models coming out regularly, similar to muggle cars. On the other hand, magical wands are hand made by skilled artisans, each individual wand taking long and painstaking labor. Printing is carried out by mechanical printing presses, rather than by magic (at least, the Quibbler is so produced). Many aspects of the British Wizarding World have Muggle equivalents. For example, after reaching age of 17 wizards can be licensed to apparate, while Muggles can learn and be licensed to drive cars. In the fifth and seventh years of Hogwarts or Muggle secondary school, external examinations take place. Some aspects of Muggle pop culture are also mirrored in the Wizarding World such as rock music, posters, and tabloids. A few young wizards embrace Muggle culture whole-heartedly: as a teenager, Sirius Black filled his room with pictures of Muggle pin-up girls, motorcycles and rock bands in rebellion against his prejudiced, Muggle-hating parents. Muggle music is heard in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - music by The Ordinary Boys is heard playing in the background of the Gryffindor common room. Wizards and witches who are Muggle-born, or are half- bloods (of mixed Muggle and magical parentage) find it easier (or even commonplace) to integrate into Muggle society and take on Muggle trends, as they are predisposed to Muggle ways growing up. Gryffindor student Dean Thomas has frequent references to the adorning of his part of the dormitory with posters of West Ham United Football Club. Albus Dumbledore has expressed interest in Muggle knitting patterns and ten-pin bowling. ==Geography== There is no separate \\"magical land\\" in the Harry Potter universe; the wizarding world not only coexists alongside the world of Muggles, but also is embedded within it. Only one settlement in Britain, the village of Hogsmeade, is home to an entirely magical population. The vast majority of witches' and wizards' locations are integrated within the wider non-magical area. Wizards will often live in small communities of several families within Muggle villages such as Godric's Hollow in the West Country (home of the Dumbledores and the Potters) or Tinworth in Cornwall. The all-wizard Weasley, Diggory, Lovegood, and Fawcett families live near the Muggle village of Ottery St Catchpole, in Devon. Many wizarding houses in the Harry Potter books are depicted as being on the outskirts of towns, usually isolated from most of the town. Similarly, the wizarding high street Diagon Alley lies in central London, just off Charing Cross Road. A train called the Hogwarts Express departs from the real King's Cross station, albeit from Platform 9¬æ. These locations are hidden by a combination of Muggle-repelling charms, illusions, and other magical protections. Many magical locations, such as the Isle of Drear off the coast of Scotland, or the Quidditch World Cup Stadium, and the wizarding prison, Azkaban, are rendered \\"unplottable\\", or impossible to locate on a map. This is further banked by the natural tendency of non-magical people to ignore anything they cannot explain or understand. Hogwarts Castle appears as abandoned ruins to any Muggles close enough to see. Although wizarding society lives for the most part directly alongside Muggles, interaction between the two communities is virtually non-existent since the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was introduced in 1692. Few wizards are aware of basic Muggle culture (for instance, most wizards do not understand Muggle clothing customs). On the odd occasions when it may be necessary for a wizard or witch to dress in Muggle clothing, the result is usually comical. While the series is set in Great Britain, there is evidence that the wizarding world has locations throughout the globe. This is shown in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, when it describes many people at the Quidditch World Cup speaking foreign languages. The number of Irish wizards working for the Ministry and attending Hogwarts, as well as the various nationalities attending Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, suggest the wizarding world's borders differ from the geopolitical divisions of the Muggle world. However, countries such as Bulgaria and Ireland have national teams representing them at the Quidditch World Cup - even though the muggles of these countries have no idea that the competition is taking place. It is also suggested in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban that wizards played a part in ancient Egyptian history, and possibly are behind many historical wonders in the modern world such as the Egyptian pyramids and tombs. ==Animals and plants== The Wizarding World is home to many magical creatures and plants, some of which are familiar from folklore and myth. Giants, dragons, unicorns, boggarts, and goblins all have roles in the series, while many plants long believed to have magical properties, such as mandrake root, aconite, asphodel and wormwood, also make appearances. Within the stories, the conceit is that these creatures and their magical powers are real, but have been hidden for centuries from the non- magical world by the efforts of wizards, to the point where they have faded into folklore. In Hogwarts, some types of pets are allowed: cats, owls, rats, and toads. J.K. Rowling wrote a spin-off book about magical creatures to complement the main Harry Potter novels, titled Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. === Laws concerning magical creatures === In both the book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and the film of the same name, laws governing magical creatures are often referenced. Like any laws, these are changed over time, and vary from country to country. There are three distinct definitions for all magical creatures given in the Fantastic Beasts book, which are \\"Beasts\\", \\"Beings\\" and \\"Spirits\\" (spirits being for ghosts) which were defined in 1811 by the British Minister for Magic. \\"Beings\\" are defined as \\"any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws\\". Laws have been created surrounding the management of magical creatures, largely for the purposes of their protection, but also to protect wizards from dangerous creatures, govern ownership of certain creatures, and also to hide them from the Muggle world. In the Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them film, the political climate of the wizarding community at the time saw a blanket ban on possessing all magical creatures. ==Blood purity== The longstanding separation between the wizarding and Muggle worlds in the Harry Potter universe has led many wizards to advocate keeping the two apart. Wizards of pure Muggle parentage are viewed as untrustworthy, foolish, or, in extreme cases, racially inferior. The common practice of wizards marrying Muggles is viewed by such extremists as miscegenation, and they instead advocate maintaining a so-called \\"purity of blood\\". This was part of Lord Voldemort's ideology, and the Black family disowned anyone who married a half- blood or muggle. However, in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Hagrid and Ron both state there is probably no such factor as \\"blood purity\\", with all wizards (given sufficient research) likely to find in their family history some marriages to Muggles. ===Pure-blood=== Pure-blood is the term applied to wizards and witches who have no Muggle blood, Muggle-borns, or half-bloods at all in their family tree. They are the rarest of the three blood statuses, with J.K. Rowling saying 10% of the Wizarding community is made up of pure- bloods. Although technically pure-bloods have no Muggle ancestors, the small wizarding population means that \\"true\\" pure-bloods are rare, with some just ignoring or disowning the few Muggles in their family.J.K.Rowling Official Site JKRowling.com Retrieved on 24 April 2007. Identified pure-blood families include the Blacks, the Crouches, the Fudges, the Gaunts (though that line died out before the beginning of Philosopher's Stone), the Lestranges, the Longbottoms, the Malfoys, and the Weasleys (but the most recent generation has had half-blood members). To maintain their blood purity, some supremacist families have been known to inbreed into their own families by marrying their cousins, resulting sometimes in mental instability and violent natures. The Gaunt family displayed both tendencies by the time of the sixth book., chapter 6, chapter 10 Pure-blood supremacists believe blood purity is a measure of a wizard's magical ability ‚Äì notwithstanding examples of skilled Muggle-born witches and wizards such as Hermione Granger and Lily Potter ‚Äì and less skilled pure-bloods such as Neville Longbottom (whose skills developed in Deathly Hallows due to his heroism) ‚Äì and Muggles to be low-life, having no magic in them. Supremacists apply the term \\"blood traitor\\" to pure-bloods who married and had children with non-pure-bloods. The pure-blood wizards and witches in the Harry Potter books are almost all supremacists, while there are some of them who don't advocate ancestral superiority; the Weasleys, Potters, and Longbottoms are old pure-blood families, but no known members of these families are sympathetic to supremacist aims., chapter 23, chapter 4 The Black family, traditionally pure-blood supremacists, also seem to have produced one or two such \\"black sheep\\" in every generation, namely Sirius and Andromeda (Bellatrix and Narcissa's sister who married the Muggle-born Ted Tonks). Several wizards question the notion of blood purity altogether. In his copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard (later bequeathed to Hermione Granger), Dumbledore has made annotations that he thinks the much-vaunted blood purity does not exist, and is only a fiction maintained by the deceptions of supremacist wizards. ===Half-blood=== Half-blood refers to those wizards and witches who have magical and Muggle ancestors in their family trees. Half- bloods are the most common wizard blood, far outnumbering pure-bloods and Muggle-borns. Rowling has stated that, of the Hogwarts annual intake, 50% are half-bloods. Pure-blood supremacists view half-bloods as inferior to them, although superior to Muggles and Muggle-borns. The Malfoy family, a family of wealthy Wizards who showed disdain to Muggles, attempted to maintain blood purity, but found it acceptable to marry half-bloods if there was a dearth of marriageable pure-bloods. Voldemort is a half-blood, and his most guarded secret which few Wizards know is that his father was Tom Riddle, a Muggle. Severus Snape is also a half-blood (he gave himself the nickname \\"The Half- Blood Prince\\"), as his father Tobias Snape was a Muggle. Harry himself is a half-blood, since his pure-blood father, James, married a Muggle-born woman named Lily, and his maternal grandparents were Muggles. ===Muggle-born=== Muggle-born is the term applied to wizards and witches whose parents were Muggles. J.K. Rowling has said they are second-most common of the three types of blood status wizards, numbering about 25% in the Wizarding community. They are often believed to be descended from Squibs who married Muggles, and the dormant magical gene may resurface after a couple of generations. Harry Potter's mother, Lily Evans, and his best friend, Hermione Granger, were Muggle-born. Unlike children of Wizarding families who get a Hogwarts acceptance letter from an owl, a Hogwarts employee will usually hand-deliver the letter to Muggle-borns in order to meet the Muggle parents and explain. Supremacists typically believe Muggle-borns to be magically deficient, despite examples to the contrary, such as Hermione and Lily, who are exceptionally skilled in their abilities., chapter 4 Pureblood supremacists refer to Muggle- borns with the offensive derogatory term Mudblood. Hagrid was shocked to find out that Draco Malfoy uttered the term to Hermione in order to insult and provoke her, since the slur is never used in proper conversations. Hermione, after being tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange, due to her blood status, decided to reclaim use of the term \\"Mudblood\\" with pride instead of shame in an effort to defuse its value as a slur., chapter 24 During Voldemort's rule, Muggle- borns were legally required to register with the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, headed by Dolores Umbridge. During this time, the Department of Mysteries claimed that Muggle-borns acquired their magic by stealing magic and wands from \\"real\\" wizards. Other wizards and witches rejected this notion, such as Ron Weasley, who asks how such an accusation can be proven. After the fall of Voldemort, Dolores Umbridge is imprisoned in Azkaban, with the other members of the commission either imprisoned or becoming fugitives. ===Squibs=== Squib is the term applied to a child who is born of magical parents, but who develops no magical abilities. They are considered to be the opposite of Muggle-born wizards/witches.http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19 JKRowling.com Retrieved on 04-24-07 Squib births are rare: the only Squibs noted as such in the books are Argus Filch, Arabella Figg, and Molly Weasley's second cousin, who was an accountant. The Ministry does not require them to be registered as part of the community. Squibs share some things with wizards and they are aware of and comprehend the wizarding World. They can also see Hogwarts and Dementors, which ordinary Muggles cannot. However, according to Ron's Aunt Muriel, the custom with Squibs has been to send them to Muggle schools and encourage them to integrate into the Muggle world, which is \\"much kinder\\" than keeping them in the wizarding world where they will always be \\"second-class\\". In contrast to most of the wizarding world's acceptance and even respect for Muggles and Muggle-born wizards and witches, it is often considered embarrassing to have a Squib in the family. Neville once said that his family originally thought he was a Squib, until his great-uncle Algie dropped him out of a second-story window and Neville bounced down the road. Albus Dumbledore's sister, Ariana, was inaccurately rumoured to be a squib. ===Mixed species=== Some wizards are the products of unions between humans and magical creatures of more-or-less human intelligence, such as Fleur Delacour and her sister Gabrielle (both quarter veela), Professor Flitwick (a quarter goblin), and Madame Maxime and Hagrid (both half giant). Prejudiced wizards (such as Umbridge) often use the insulting term half-breed to refer to mixed- species wizards and werewolves, or to other beings such as house elves, merpeople and centaurs (who are separate species). The centaurs within the series prefer to exist amongst themselves, with little interaction with humans. ==Government and politics== The Ministry of Magic is the government for the magical community of Britain. The government is first mentioned in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. The Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, is the first minister to make an appearance in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. The Ministry itself is not shown until Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. As the books progress, the Ministry becomes more corrupt and blind to happenings in the Wizard world, reaching a nadir of corruption during Voldemort's uprising. Known Ministers for Magic include Millicent Bagnold (before the books begin), Cornelius Fudge, Rufus Scrimgeour, Pius Thicknesse (under the Imperius Curse, controlled indirectly by Lord Voldemort), Kingsley Shacklebolt (at first temporarily, but later known to be permanent) and Hermione Granger. ==RelationsTo the Muggle world=== The Muggles remain, for the most part, oblivious to the wizarding world. This situation is considered preferable to the alternative by wizards. Most things of magical nature are hidden or otherwise obscured from Muggles; others, such as Dementors, are invisible to them, although they experience the same depression and sense of manifest darkness and despair while near a Dementor. It is commented that Muggles generally dismiss anything they cannot explain. Likewise, to many magical people, many functional aspects of the Muggle world are rarely glimpsed and mysterious. Wizards and witches' attempts to disguise themselves as Muggles, as when they have to venture out onto \\"normal\\" streets, often have humorous results. When magic is seen in the muggle world, the Ministry of Magic is often tasked with clean-up. The mispronunciation of common Muggle terms like \\"telephone\\", \\"escalator\\", \\"plumber\\", \\"firearms\\" or \\"policeman\\", as \\"fellytone\\", \\"escapator\\", \\"pumble\\", \\"firelegs\\", and \\"please- men\\", respectively, is a running gag in the series. Arthur Weasley is known for being fascinated with the muggle world and has a vast collection of muggle objects. Muggle Studies is an option of study at Hogwarts. However, while some professions require its study, to others it is often considered a \\"soft option\\". Hermione surprised Harry by taking the course, as her parents are Muggles. She explained that she thought it would be \\"fascinating\\" to study Muggles from the wizarding point of view. The only official relations described with the Muggle world are between the Minister for Magic and the Muggle Prime Minister. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince it is revealed that the Minister for Magic privately introduces himself to each new Prime Minister. There is a magical painting in the Prime Minister's office that notifies him of such visits, and a fireplace that is connected to the Floo Network, which is how the Minister for Magic travels to the Prime Minister's office. Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge informed the Prime Minister of the escape of Sirius Black. Fudge also informed the Prime Minister that several problems he was facing were rooted in the war against Voldemort, and that the Prime Minister's new secretary Kingsley Shacklebolt was an Auror. Fudge treats the Muggle Prime Minister with condescension, and the Muggle Prime Minister is often frustrated by the Minister for Magic. The exact extent to which the secrecy and isolation of the wizarding world is maintained varies. Many references are made to the Ministry of Magic performing memory charms to preserve secrecy; however, some Muggles have necessary interactions with the wizarding world. Hermione's parents are Muggles, but have been seen in Diagon Alley. They are fully aware that magic exists, but they forbade Hermione to use magic to fix her teeth (as dentists, they felt that this was cheating). The Dursleys are also aware of the Wizarding World; Petunia Dursley indicates that she learned of it when her sister, Lily, was accepted for Hogwarts. She shared this information with her husband, who is shown to be contemptuous of the wizarding world even before Harry shows up at their doorstep. There is no indication that Dudley was aware of this until Harry is told about Hogwarts. Along with the families of Muggle-born wizards, there are mixed marriages. Seamus Finnigan reports that his mother was a witch who did not inform his Muggle father of her magical abilities until after they were married. There is also some unspecified financial relationship between the two worlds, as it is possible to exchange Muggle money into wizard money. Hermione's parents are shown doing this in the second book. Policies on wizard-muggle relationships In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry writes an essay on medieval witch burning, which was cited as the reason behind the introduction of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, and wizards going into hiding from the Muggle world. This is further explored in other novels, and is notably covered in some depth in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, where Albus Dumbledore writes notes after each story that often concern Wizard-Muggle relationships. Part of these 'observations' note how The Tales were modified in the face of anti-Muggle sentiments, in order to remove any pro-Muggle messages for wizards who did not want their children exposed to those messages. This included Lucius Malfoy, who demanded that the Tales be removed from the Hogwarts syllabus. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them shows that different wizarding governments around the world may have different levels of relationships with Muggles depending on their social and political climate, and that these relationships may even change over time like other political policies. In the film, Newt Scamander describes American wizarding law in regard to Muggles as \\"rather backward\\", and further explains that American wizards are forbidden from having any contact or relationships with Muggles. ===Internally=== Since a person's most important capability ‚Äì magical aptitude ‚Äì does not depend on sex, sexual equality is highly advanced in the Wizarding World, and the \\"battle of the sexes\\" never became much of an issue (for example, Quidditch teams have both male and female players ‚Äì except for a known example, the Holyhead Harpies, which are an all-female team). The most obvious example of wizard prejudice is a longstanding disdain, even a genocidal hatred, toward Muggles and wizards and witches of Muggle parentage (Muggle-borns, half-bloods) among certain wizards. This has led to a eugenic philosophy among some of the older wizarding families, leading to a practice of \\"pure-blood\\" intermarriage that has exposed many of them (such as the Gaunt family) to the risks of mental instability. Other internal tensions include the slavery of house elves and the suspicion or disregard for some species of near-human intelligence (\\"beings\\" in Wizard parlance). Voldemort and his allies frequently exploit these divisions to bring non-human magical creatures, particularly werewolves and giants, over to their cause. Internationally The magical governments of the world are to some degree united in the International Confederation of Wizards. This organisation has many responsibilities, mostly to enforce the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy. There is a reference to the Ministry of Magic's Department of International Magical Cooperation and to various international bodies such as the International Magical Trading Standards Body, the International Magical Office of Law, the International Confederation of Wizards and the International Quidditch Association. As noted in the depiction of the Quidditch World Championship in Goblet of Fire, Irish and Bulgarian wizards (and presumably, also those from other countries) can feel a strong national pride and be intensely eager for their country to win ‚Äì even though Irish and Bulgarian Muggles, who form most of the population in the two countries, are not aware that the Championship is taking place. The books do not refer to the degree to which wars and tensions between Muggle governments (e.g., the World Wars or the Cold War) influence the relations between the respective wizarding governments. However, Rowling has strongly implied that the rise of the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald and his defeat by Dumbledore in 1945 were related to the rise and fall of the Third Reich. ==EducationBefore Hogwarts=== There appears to be no official precursor to a magical education; apparently, wizard parents home-school their children in basic non-magical topics, such as literacy and arithmetic. Muggle-born wizards (or Muggle-raised wizards), however, clearly experience an ordinary Muggle primary education before enrolling at Hogwarts, something that could be viewed as either a cognitive edge or a disadvantage. There are also no compulsory educational laws that exist in the British Wizarding World. Parents may continue to home-school their children, send them to Hogwarts, or send them abroad to other wizarding schools. However, during the time Voldemort had overthrown the Ministry of Magic, attendance at Hogwarts was compulsory, so that his followers could have complete control over the wizarding youth. ===After Hogwarts=== Following completion of a Hogwarts education, there is no standard tertiary education, and there are no wizard universities. Successful Hogwarts students are considered ready to function as adults, though some wizarding professions do require special, years-long training programmes after finishing Hogwarts. These include the professions of the Auror and the Healer (the wizard physician). Sometimes, the young travel the world to \\"observe foreign witches and wizards\\" after graduation to complete their education. In the Deathly Hallows, Elphias Doge describes how his plans to travel the world with his friend Dumbledore were disrupted by the death of the latter's mother. Similarly, Professor Quirrell took time off to gain first-hand experience after a celebrated academic career. ===Wizarding Examinations Authority=== The Wizarding Examinations Authority is an organisation responsible for examining students in their fifth and seventh years taking their O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. exams. These relate to the Muggle world's GCSE and A-Level examinations in English, Welsh and Northern Irish schools (National 5 and Higher in Scottish schools) in the UK. The head of the authority, Griselda Marchbanks, is an elderly witch who examined a school-aged Dumbledore in his N.E.W.T.s. === O.W.L.s === Ordinary Wizarding Levels (O.W.L.s) are wizarding examinations taken in the fifth year. O.W.Ls affect what jobs a witch or wizard is eligible for after school, and are presided over by the Wizarding Examinations Authority (see above).  Grading  {  O Outstanding Highest grade possible - E Exceeds Expectations Above average - A Acceptable Average; the lowest passing grade - P Poor Fail grade - D Dreadful Lowest common grade; fail grade - T Troll Lowest grade } === N.E.W.T.s === Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests(N.E.W.T.s) are wizarding examinations taken in the seventh year. N.E.W.T.s are the final tests to see what jobs a witch or wizard is eligible for. While Hermione goes back to Hogwarts to take her exams in the aftermath of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Harry and Ron never take their N.E.W.T.s. In spite of this, Harry manages to become the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at some point in the future. ===Known foreign schools=== * Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France * Durmstrang Institute for Magical Learning in Northern Europe * Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in North America * Uagadou in Africa * Mahoutokoro in Japan * Castelobruxo in Brazil * Koldovstoretz in RussiaWonderbook: Book of Potions ==Economy== Gringotts Bank film set at The Making of Harry Potter A fictional system of currency is used by the wizards of the United Kingdom. The currency uses only coins as the units of account. It is based on three types of coin; in order of decreasing value, the gold Galleon, the silver Sickle, and the bronze Knut. Wizarding banks provide money-changing services for those with Muggle currency. The only bank seen in the Harry Potter series is Gringotts, which is located in Diagon Alley in London and has hundreds of vaults. Account-holders may use these vaults to store anything they wish. Hagrid indicates that wizards have \\"just the one\\" bank, and considers Gringotts to be the most secure place to store valuable or sensitive items aside from Hogwarts. Some Gringotts employees are stationed in countries other than England and tasked with recovering treasure for use by the bank. Bill Weasley is introduced as one such employee, working in Egypt as a curse-breaker to extract riches from ancient tombs. ===Coins=== The Galleon is the largest and most valuable coin in the British wizard currency. It is gold, round and larger than the other coins in use. Around the rim of the Galleon is inscribed at least one serial number, which identifies the goblin who was responsible for minting the coin. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Hermione enchants fake Galleons to show the time and date of the next Dumbledore's Army meeting instead of the serial number. As explained in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone there are 17 silver Sickles to a gold Galleon, and 29 bronze Knuts to a Sickle. According to Pottermore, the wizards never changed their units of measurement (i.e. feet to metres, ounces to grams, pounds to kilograms, etc.) because they can do the calculations with magic, so strange number conversions do not bother them. ===Exchange rate=== {  style=\\"float:right; width:33%; text-align:center;\\" - !One Knut is !One Sickle is !One Galleon is - fafad2;\\"  1 Knut  29 Knuts  493 Knuts - fafad2;\\"  0.03448... Sickles  1 Sickle  17 Sickles - fafad2;\\"  0.002028... Galleons  0.05882...

K. Rowling said a Galleon was approximately five pounds (at the time of the interview approximately US$7.50 or ‚Ç¨5.50), although \\"the exchange rate varies.\\" In the book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, it is said that the ¬£174 million raised for charity is equivalent to 34,000,872 Galleons, 14 Sickles, and 7 Knuts (the figure is truncated to \\"over thirty-four million Galleons\\" in Quidditch Through the Ages). This means that ¬£5.12 = 1 galleon. However, the book's cover price is ¬£2.50 ($3.99 US), or \\"14 Sickles and 3 Knuts,\\" which implies either an exchange rate of ¬£3.01 = 1 galleon or a 41% discount to Muggle purchasers. ==Games and sports== Sports, specifically Quidditch, play an important role in the Wizarding world, and in the Harry Potter series. Quidditch is a team sport played up in the air on brooms. Wizards all around the globe fanatically follow it in a similar manner to football, and the Quidditch World Cup is a major event on the wizard calendar. Not long into his first year at Hogwarts, Harry proves himself a talented Quidditch player and is named to the Gryffindor team as its Seeker, with the role of finding and catching the Golden Snitch. His activities on the Quidditch pitch feature prominently in several of the books. Lee Jordan, two years older than Harry, serves as the commentator for the Quidditch matches at Hogwarts until he graduates. The sport appears in every book except the seventh; school matches are canceled in the fourth due to the need to use the pitch for the Triwizard Tournament, but Harry attends the Quidditch World Cup as a guest of the Weasley family. Other wizard games and sports include Gobstones (a version of marbles in which the stones squirt foul-smelling liquid into the other player's face when they lose a point), Exploding Snap (a card game in which the cards explode), and Wizard Chess (in which the pieces are sentient and under the command of the player). The wizarding world is also home to a number of other wizard spectator sports, such as Creaothceann (a now-banned broom game from Scotland in which players try to catch rocks with cauldrons strapped to their heads), QuodpotQuidditch Through The Ages (a popular game in the United States involving a Quaffle that explodes), and broom racing.Quidditch Through the Ages ==Communications== Several magical communication methods are available to the wizarding world. ===Owls=== By far the most popular method of communication is via owls. Owls are used for conveying packages, with multiple owls acting in concert to deliver heavier packages. Owls also deliver mail and newspapers, acting as a replacement for the postal service of the Muggle world. If an owl delivers something for which payment is expected, such as a newspaper, the recipient places the money in a small pouch attached to the owl's leg. Not only owls may be used; Sirius Black makes use of a tropical bird, likely a macaw, on one occasion. The Ministry of Magic regulates Owl Mail. How the owls find the recipients of the letters they carry is not specifically stated. In some circumstances, letters have extremely explicit addresses on them (specifying rooms or locations inside of a building). Other times, there is no mention of an address, and the owl is simply told to whom to deliver. The Ministry of Magic used to use owls to deliver inter-office mail within the ministry building, but according to Mr. Weasley, the mess was incredible. Now the ministry uses enchanted memos, which fly throughout the building as paper aeroplanes, rather than owls. In addition, though owls are portrayed as flying directly to the recipient of their package, it is implied that owl traffic can be monitored and even interrupted. There are several references to \\"the owls being watched\\" and Harry uses different owls to communicate with Sirius (his godfather) since his snowy owl, Hedwig, would supposedly attract too much attention. On one occasion Hedwig is injured after being intercepted and searched (supposedly by Umbridge). ===Patronuses=== A Patronus is primarily used to repel Dementors. They can also be used for communication by accomplished witches and wizards. Albus Dumbledore devised a method of using Patronuses to deliver vocal messages, putting this to the exclusive use of the Order of the Phoenix. Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and Arthur Weasley all deliver messages via Patronus in the course of the series. McGonagall is also the only character in the series to have shown the ability to project multiple Patronuses to send multiple messages.Rowling, J.K. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (New York: Scholastic Press), 2007. Page 596. Patronuses are also the only known way of repelling Lethifolds. Severus Snape used his Patronus to lead Harry Potter to the forest pool wherein Gryffindor's sword was hidden in The Deathly Hallows. === Floo Network === While the Floo Network (a play on the word 'flue') is intended for use as a method of transport, it also occasionally serves as a method of communication. A wizard can throw a pinch of Floo Powder into a lit fireplace connected to the Network and put his/her head into the flames, causing it to appear in the fireplace of the wizard with whom he/she intends to speak. This use of the Network is first seen in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire when Harry sees Amos Diggory's head in the Weasleys' fireplace at The Burrow, talking to Molly Weasley. Harry also uses this method to communicate with Sirius Black on several occasions during the series. The etiquette surrounding using the fireplace for communication is not explicitly addressed in the series. Dumbledore tells Harry it is not polite for a wizard to apparate (appear out of thin air) directly into another wizard's house. However, at one point Harry uses Floo Powder to contact Grimmauld Place unannounced. Severus Snape uses a fireplace to contact Remus Lupin and tell him he wants a word, before speaking to him in person in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. ===Dark magic communication=== Lord Voldemort uses a method of communication called the Dark Mark, which is like a brand on the inner forearms of the Death Eaters. When the mark is pressed, contact is made with other Death Eaters and Voldemort himself. Pressing one's Dark Mark causes every other Death Eater's mark to burn, signalling them to Disapparate from wherever they were and immediately Apparate to Voldemort's side. Those who follow Voldemort consider the Dark Mark to be of great importance, and while some people are 'lucky' enough to have one, the privilege is restricted to those of 'pure' blood. It is stated that Fenrir Greyback (a vicious werewolf) is not allowed the Dark Mark, which is likely because he is a werewolf. Hermione uses the principle of the Dark Mark in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Instead of burning/engraving the message into the members of Dumbledore's Army's skin, she uses fake Galleons which all mimic each other and have messages on the rim. Later Malfoy and Madam Rosmerta, who was under the Imperius Curse, used Galleons to contact each other. ===Other forms of communication=== Apart from the fake Galleons enchanted by Hermione for Dumbledore's Army, there are a few other methods of closed-channel communications used in the books and films. Subjects painted into wizarding portraits are frequently used to carry messages between locations where their portraits hang. Phineas Nigellus (former Hogwarts headmaster and member of the Black Family) is used to send messages between Dumbledore's office and his other portrait in Grimmauld Place. Hermione takes Phineas from Grimmauld Place during Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and uses Phineas to obtain information about events at Hogwarts. Dumbledore also uses two other former headmasters in a similar fashion when Arthur Weasley is attacked by Nagini in the Ministry of Magic. A portrait is also seen carrying messages between the Minister for Magic and the Muggle Prime Minister in the opening of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Another form of closed communication used in the books and films is a set of mirrors which belonged to Sirius Black. Sirius gives Harry one mirror in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, with a note explaining to Harry that Sirius and James Potter used to use the mirrors to talk to each other when they were put in separate detentions. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Harry uses a shard of his broken mirror to call for help from the Malfoy's cellar, and later finds out that Aberforth Dumbledore had been watching over Harry using Sirius' mirror, which he obtained from Mundungus Fletcher. Flying paper aeroplanes (referred to as \\"interdepartmental memos\\") are used within the Ministry of Magic. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix when Arthur Weasley takes Harry to the Ministry of Magic, Mr. Weasley explains that these took the place of the owls to minimise the mess. They are pale violet with MINISTRY OF MAGIC stamped along the edges of the wings. A variation on this method of communication is shown in the film version of Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban, when Draco Malfoy sends Harry a note in class in the form of a flying paper crane. ==TransportationApparition=== Wizards and witches often Apparate to their destinations, which is quite similar to teleportation. It is quite difficult to Apparate; therefore underage wizards and witches are forbidden to do it. There are many examples of failed Apparition attempts made by people who have not passed their \\"Apparition test\\", which is like a Muggle driving test. If not Apparating correctly, a person may lose a body part in the process, referred to as \\"splinching\\". In Deathly Hallows, Ron gets splinched after being grabbed by Yaxley, a Death Eater. Hermione heals him with a liquid - essence of dittany - that she carried in her bag, a process which takes several days. Bob Ogden, once the head of Magical Law Enforcement, after being attacked by Morfin and Marvolo Gaunt, apparated back to his headquarters, returning with several more policemen to subdue the lawbreakers. ===Transportation objects=== Characters in the series make use of several magical devices and artefacts to transport themselves within the Wizarding World and to the Muggle world. Among the most common of these objects are broomsticks, the Floo Network (a network of fireplaces magically connected to one another), the Knight Bus, and the Hogwarts Express. Some characters have been known to enchant Muggle vehicles to have magical features, such as Arthur Weasley's Ford Anglia or Sirius Black's Flying Motorbike. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a discussion is held around the politics of importing flying carpets. ===Portkeys=== Portkeys are used if witches or wizards are unable to Apparate, whether that be because they are unable to or because they have an underage witch or wizard in their company. Portkeys can be almost anything, usually a mundane, everyday object that would easily be overlooked by a muggle. Using the charm \\"Portus,\\" they are able to carry the user to their destination, so long as the user has hold of the object upon leaving. Portkeys are able to carry multiple people at once, an example being in The Goblet of Fire when Harry, Hermione Granger, the Weasleys and the Diggorys travel to the Quidditch World Cup. Portkeys are usually disguised as rubbish such as a tin can or old sock so Muggles won't notice them. ===Thestrals=== Thestrals are skeletal, winged horses, black in colour, which can only be seen by those who have witnessed death firsthand. They pull the Hogwarts school coaches and can also be tamed and ridden. This method of transportation was used in Order of the Phoenix, when members of the Dumbledore's Army needed to go to the Ministry of Magic to rescue Sirius Black, and also used when transporting Harry from the Dursleys' house to The Burrow in Deathly Hallows. Other magical birds have also been known to be flown; for instance Fawkes the phoenix by Harry, Ron, Ginny and Lockhart in Chamber of Secrets and Buckbeak the hippogriff by Harry, Hermione and Sirius in Prisoner of Azkaban. ==Wizarding mediaThe Daily Prophet=== The Daily Prophet is the most widely read daily newspaper in Britain's wizard community. The articles include moving pictures. Its journalistic integrity is lacking; it has been known to be more concerned about sales than about factual accuracy and is often a mouthpiece for the Ministry of Magic; as described by Rita Skeeter, \\"The Prophet exists to sell itself!\\" The Prophet remains respectable for the first three books, but by Goblet of Fire, it has hired Rita Skeeter, an unscrupulous journalist who supplies several thrilling and blatantly false articles. These include an article that, while correctly asserting that Hagrid is part giant, also makes numerous scurrilous accusations about his personal character, and declares Harry \\"disturbed and dangerous\\" based on remarks by Draco Malfoy. When Minister Fudge takes the stance of firmly denying Voldemort's return, the Prophet initiates a smear campaign against Dumbledore and Harry, the most influential proponents of the opposing view. After Fudge is forced to admit that Voldemort has returned, the Prophet changes its stance overnight, calling Harry \\"a lone voice of truth\\". The newspaper even buys, from The Quibbler, Harry's interview on Voldemort's return and claims it to be exclusive. The editor of The Daily Prophet is Barnabas Cuffe, a former pupil of the Potions master Horace Slughorn. It is unclear how long he has been editor of The Daily Prophet. According to J. K. Rowling, in the events after the book series, Ginny Weasley becomes Senior Quidditch correspondent at The Daily Prophet, after her retirement from the Holyhead Harpies. The Daily Prophet has a late edition named The Evening Prophet, and a weekend edition named The Sunday Prophet. The Warner Bros. Harry Potter website's news and events page has been named after the paper.Warner Bros. Harry Potter website's news and events page ===The Quibbler=== The Quibbler is a magazine first mentioned in Order of the Phoenix. The magazine's editor is Xenophilius Lovegood. The Quibbler mainstays are conspiracy theories and cryptozoology. Articles in The Quibbler have claimed that Fudge has had goblins cooked in pies, and uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons, which he supposedly feeds to people who disagree with him, and that he has a secret army of fire-demons called \\"heliopaths\\". Numerous (presumably imaginary) beasts are mentioned in The Quibbler, such as Crumple-Horned Snorkacks (which supposedly live in Sweden and cannot fly), the Blibbering Humdinger and Nargles (which are supposed to infest mistletoe). In Order of the Phoenix, Hermione blackmails Rita Skeeter into writing an article about Harry's encounter with Voldemort. The interview is published by Xenophilius, and he later sells it to the Daily Prophet for a good price (enough to finance an expedition to Sweden to hunt for the Crumple-Horned Snorkack). In Deathly Hallows, Xenophilius continues to support Harry in his magazine until his daughter Luna gets kidnapped to silence him. Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit Xenophilius for information but discover that the latest issue features an anti-Harry story on the cover. Following Voldemort's ultimate defeat, the Quibbler goes back to its condition of advanced lunacy and becomes popular, still being appreciated for its unintentional humour. === Radio === The most popular radio station is the Wizarding Wireless Network. Harry learns about the popular wizarding band The Weird Sisters from his peers that listen to the WWN. Over Christmas with the Weasley family during Harry Potter and the Half- Blood Prince, the Weasley family listens to Celestina Warbeck on the network. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Ron introduces Harry and Hermione to Potterwatch. Potterwatch is an underground anti-Voldemort radio program which is only accessible with a secret password. The Potterwatch episode that the trio listen to features various members of the Order of the Phoenix and is hosted by Lee Jordan. ==Food and beverages== The following are food and beverages unique to the wizarding world: ===Magical sweets=== Multitudes of sweets are referred to in the stories; many have a violent or bizarre side effect, especially those created by Fred and George Weasley. Most sweets can be found in the sweetshop Honeydukes. Dumbledore seems to be partial to these as he often uses their names as passwords., chapter 29 Chocolate Frogs are, as the name suggests, frogs made of chocolate, and are very popular wizarding sweets. They are each packaged with a collectible card displaying a magical picture and brief biography of a famous witch or wizard of medieval to modern times. Cards named in the Harry Potter series include wizards such as Merlin, Dumbledore, Nicholas Flamel and the four founders of Hogwarts. According to a web chat with the author, Harry and his friends are eventually featured on a series of Chocolate Frog cards, with Ron calling it \\"his finest hour\\". Some of the most notable magical sweets such as Bertie Bott's Every-Flavour Beans, Skiving Snackboxes and Cockroach Clusters have been manufactured in real life, mainly by the Jelly Belly candy company. They have produced real versions of Bertie Bott's Every-Flavour Beans odd flavours in and out of the market since 2001. Apart from some \\"regular\\" flavours, the company also produces several \\"unusual\\" flavours mentioned in the books. Other flavours include bacon, dirt, earthworm, earwax, vomit, rotten egg, sausage, pickle, toast, grass and soap. A description of Honeydukes in the third book says that the store sells candies called Coconut Ice, Ice Mice (which make your teeth chatter and squeak), Fizzing Whizbees, Pepper Imps (which allow you to breathe fire on your friends), Sugar Quills, Cockroach Clusters, self-flossing mints, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum (which make a room fill up with bluebell-coloured bubbles which wouldn't pop for days), Peppermint Creams shaped like toads (which hop in your stomach), Exploding Bonbons, Jelly Slugs, Acid Pops, and blood-flavoured lollipops. ===Butterbeer=== Butterbeer is the drink of choice for younger wizards. Harry is first presented with the beverage in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Although house-elves can become intoxicated on Butterbeer, the amount of alcohol contained in Butterbeer has a negligible effect on witches and wizards. J.K. Rowling said in her interview to Bon App√©tit magazine that she imagines it \\"to taste a little bit like less- sickly butterscotch\\". Butterbeer can be served cold or hot, but either way it has a warming effect. The earliest reference to buttered beer is from The Good Huswifes Handmaide for the Kitchin, published in London in 1588. It was made from beer, sugar, eggs, nutmeg, cloves and butter. Another old recipe for buttered beer, published by Robert May in 1664 from his recipe book The Accomplisht Cook, calls for liquorice root and aniseed to be added. British celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal recreated the drink for his show \\"Heston's Tudor Feast\\".Feasting on butterbeer channel4.com Retrieved on 07-28-09 It was announced in April 2010 that a drink named after butterbeer would be sold in the theme park The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando. The beverage is also sold at the Warner Bros. Studio Tour London. It has a sweet taste and is a non-alcoholic beverage. It was taste-tested by J. K. Rowling herself. According to Neil Genzlinger, a staff editor on the culture desk of The New York Times, the beverage \\"is indistinguishable from a good quality cream soda\\". ===Firewhisky=== Firewhisky is a type of alcohol that wizards under the age of seventeen are not allowed to drink; however, this rule is not always followed. Firewhisky is described as burning the drinkers' throats as they consume it. It can be seen as a very strong whisky, and by all intents is used as such. The characters drink it in the last book when Mad-Eye Moody dies in flight, to numb the shock and toast to his life. Hagrid also drinks it, although in much larger quantities. ===Pumpkin juice=== Pumpkin juice is a cold drink favoured by the Wizarding world, and among the students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It is drunk at any occasion, such as breakfast, lunch, at feasts or on other occasions. It seems to have taken on the same role that orange juice has to Muggles. Pumpkin juice is readily available, and can be purchased on the Hogwarts Express. Severus Snape threatened to Harry in his fourth year that he might slip Veritaserum in his morning pumpkin juice while believing that Harry had stolen some of Snape's potion ingredients. Prior to a Quidditch match in his sixth year, Ron Weasley believed that Harry had slipped Felix Felicis into his morning juice to help him play perfectly. Pumpkin juice is one of several speciality beverages developed for Universal's Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park (along with butterbeer, see above). According to a preview by The New York Times' Neil Genzlinger, \\"Pumpkin juice (in a cute, pumpkin-topped bottle) is far more interesting [than the park's butterbeer], perhaps because the actual pumpkin content seems minimal ‚Äì it‚Äôs more like a feisty apple cider with a little pumpkin thrown in.\\" ===Gillywater=== Gillywater is a beverage sold in the Harry Potter universe. Professor McGonagall drinks this in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. ==See also== * The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter ==ReferencesHarry Potter movies ‚Äì Official website (Warner Bros.) * Harry Potter at Bloomsbury.com (International publisher) * Harry Potter at Scholastic.com (US publisher) Category:Mythopoeia he:◊î◊ê◊®◊ô ◊§◊ï◊ò◊® - ◊û◊ï◊†◊ó◊ô◊ù ","title":"Fictional universe of Harry Potter"},{"id":"2228439","text":"Genetic redundancy is a term typically used to describe situations where a given biochemical function is redundantly encoded by two or more genes. In these cases, mutations (or defects) in one of these genes will have a smaller effect on the fitness of the organism than expected from the genes‚Äô function. Characteristic examples of genetic redundancy include (Enns, Kanaoka et al. 2005) and (Pearce, Senis et al. 2004). Many more examples are thoroughly discussed in (Kafri, Levy & Pilpel. 2006). The main source of genetic redundancy is the process of gene duplication which generates multiplicity in gene copy number. A second and less frequent source of genetic redundancy are convergent evolutionary processes leading to genes that are close in function but unrelated in sequence (Galperin, Walker & Koonin 1998). Genetic redundancy is typically associated with signaling networks, in which many proteins act together to accomplish teleological functions. In contrast to expectations, genetic redundancy is not associated with gene duplications [Wagner, 2007], neither do redundant genes mutate faster than essential genes [Hurst 1999]. Therefore, genetic redundancy has classically aroused much debate in the context of evolutionary biology (Nowak et al., 1997; Kafri, Springer & Pilpel . 2009). From an evolutionary standpoint, genes with overlapping functions implies minimal, if any, selective pressures acting on these genes. One therefore expects that the genes participating in such buffering of mutations will be subject to severe mutational drift diverging their functions and/or expression patterns with considerably high rates. Indeed it has been shown that the functional divergence of paralogous pairs in both yeast and human is an extremely rapid process. Taking these notions into account, the very existence of genetic buffering, and the functional redundancies required for it, presents a paradox in light of the evolutionary concepts. On one hand, for genetic buffering to take place there is a necessity for redundancies of gene function, on the other hand such redundancies are clearly unstable in face of natural selection and are therefore unlikely to be found in evolved genomes. Duplicated genes that diverge in function may undergo subfunctionalization or can become degenerate. When two protein coding genes are degenerate there will be conditions where the gene products appear functionally redundant and also conditions where the gene products take on unique functions. ==References== * Pearce, A.

It runs from Tavistock to north west of the city of Truro. Starting in Tavistock, it heads south- westwards towards Liskeard, crossing over the River Tamar and into Cornwall, then through Gunnislake and Callington. Immediately before Liskeard, it merges with the A38 north of the town. It diverges from the A38 at Dobwalls, where it then runs in a south-westerly direction to Truro via Lostwithiel, St. Blazey, and St Austell. It then forms an upside down elongated square loop, and bypasses Truro City Centre. It then heads north west out of the city, where it forms the main corridor into Truro from the west. It passes the Royal Cornwall Hospital and skirts the village of Threemilestone, before linking up with the A30 road at Chiverton Cross, where the A390 terminates. Chiverton Cross is where the A390 trunk road from Truro and the B3277 to St Agnes meet the east- west A30 trunk road.

One of his better known statues is Die Partei, representing the spirit of the Nazi Party that flanked one side of the carriage entrance to Albert Speer's new Reich Chancellery. == Life == Breker was born in Elberfeld, in the west of Germany, the son of stonemason Arnold Breker. He began to study architecture, along with stone-carving and anatomy. At age 20 he entered the D√ºsseldorf Academy of Arts where he concentrated on sculpture, studying under Hubert Netzer and Wilhelm Kreis. He first visited Paris in 1924, shortly before finishing his studies. There he met with Jean Cocteau, Jean Renoir, Pablo Picasso, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, and Alfred Flechtheim. In 1927 he moved to Paris, which he thereafter considered to be his home, in the same year he had an exhibition with Alf Bayrle. Breker was quickly accepted by the art dealer Alfred Flechtheim. He also established close relationships with important figures in the art world, including Charles Despiau, Isamu Noguchi, Maurice de Vlaminck and Andr√© Dunoyer de Segonzac, all of whom he later portrayed. He travelled to North Africa, producing lithographs which he published under the title \\"Tunisian Journey\\". He also visited Aristide Maillol, who was later to describe Breker as \\"Germany's Michelangelo\\". Adolf Hitler in Paris, 1940, with Albert Speer (left) and Arno Breker (right) In 1932, he was awarded a prize by the Prussian Ministry of Culture, which allowed him to stay in Rome for a year. In 1934 he returned to Germany on the advice of Max Liebermann. At this time Alfred Rosenberg, editor of the Nazi newspaper V√∂lkischer Beobachter, actually denounced some of Breker's work as degenerate art. However, Breker was supported by many Nazi leaders, especially Adolf Hitler. Even Rosenberg later hailed his sculptures as expressions of the \\"mighty momentum and will power‚Äù (‚ÄúWucht und Willenhaftigkeit‚Äù) of Nazi Germany.Caroline Fetscher, \\"Why Mention Arno Breker Today?\\", The Atlantic Times, August, 2006. He took commissions from the Nazis from 1933 through 1942, for example participating in a show of his work in occupied Paris in 1942, where he met Jean Cocteau, who appreciated his work. He maintained personal relationships with Albert Speer and with Hitler. In 1936 he won the commission for two sculptures representing athletic prowess, intended for the 1936 Olympic games, one representing a Decathlete (‚ÄúZehnk√§mpfer‚Äù) and the other The Victress (‚ÄúDie Siegerin‚Äù). In 1937 he married Demetra Messala (ŒîŒÆŒºŒ∑œÑœÅŒ± ŒúŒµœÉœÉŒ¨ŒªŒ±), a Greek model. The same year, Breker joined the Nazi Party and was made \\"official state sculptor\\" by Hitler, given a large property and provided a studio with forty-three assistants.Evans, Richard, \\"The Third Reich in Power\\", New York: Penguin Books, 2005, p. 167. Hitler also exempted him from military service. His twin sculptures The Party and The Army held a prominent position at the entrance to Albert Speer's new Reich Chancellery, as well as the ‚ÄúStriding Horses‚Äù (1939), which until 1945 flanked the entrance stairs on the garden front of Adolf Hitler's Reich Chancellery in Berlin. The neoclassical nature of his work, with titles like Comradeship, Torchbearer, and Sacrifice, typified Nazi ideals, and suited the characteristics of Nazi architecture. On closer inspection, though, the proportions of his figures, the highly colouristic treatment of his surfaces (the strong contrasts between dark and light accents), and the melodramatic tension of their musculatures perhaps invites comparison with the Italian Mannerist sculptors of the 16th century. This Mannerist tendency to Breker's neoclassicism may suggest closer affinities to concurrent expressionist tendencies in German Modernism than is acknowledged. Until the fall of the Third Reich, Breker was a professor of visual arts in Berlin. While nearly all of his sculptures survived World War II, more than 90% of his public work was destroyed by the allies after the war. In 1946, Breker was offered a commission by Joseph Stalin but he refused and stated \\"One dictatorship is sufficient for me\\".Evans, Richard J. The Third Reich at War. New York: Penguin 2008, p. 754 In 1948 Breker was designated as a \\"fellow traveller\\" of the Nazis and fired, upon which he returned to D√ºsseldorf. The latter city remained his base, with periods of residence in Paris. During this time he worked as an architect. However, he continued to receive commissions for sculptures, producing a number of works in his familiar classical style, working for businesses and individual patrons. He also produced many portrait sculptures. In 1970 he was commissioned by the king of Morocco to produce work for the United Nations Building in Casablanca, but the work was destroyed. Many other works followed, including portraits of Anwar Sadat and Konrad Adenauer. Breker's rehabilitation continued, culminating in plans for the creation of a Breker museum, funded by the Bodenstein family, who set aside Schloss N√∂rvenich (between Aachen and Cologne) for the purpose. The Arno Breker Museum was inaugurated in 1985. Breker's rehabilitation led to backlashes from anti-Nazi activists, including controversy in Paris when some of his works were exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou in 1981. In the same year anti-Breker demonstrations accompanied an exhibition in Berlin. Breker's admirers insisted that he had never been a supporter of Nazi ideology (despite being a member of the Nazi Party), but had simply accepted their patronage. Breker's last major work was a monumental sculpture of Alexander the Great intended to be located in Greece. ==Marriages and family== Arno Breker was married twice. His first wife, Demetra Messala, was a Greek model. She died in 1956 in a car accident. He remarried in 1958 to Charlotte Kluge. They had two children, Gerhart (1959) and Carola (1962). Breker remained married to Kluge until his death in 1991.Arno Breker biography == Portraits (mostly in bronze) == Arno Breker carves a portrait of Albert Speer in 1940 Arno Breker's Grave in D√ºsseldorf Bust of Richard Wagner in Bayreuth. * Baron von Mirbach, 1920 * Friedrich Ebert, Berlin 1924 (erster Staatsauftrag) * Walter Kaesbach, D√ºsseldorf, 1925 * Artur Kaufmann, 1925 * Herbert Eulenberg, 1925/26 * Otto Dix, Paris 1926/27 * Isamu Noguchi, Paris 1927 * Hermann Kesser, 1927 * Moissey Kogan, Paris 1927/28 * Inge Davemann, 1928 * Albert Lindgens, 1928 * Walter Lindgens, 1928 * Illa Fudickar, 1929 * Robert Gerling, 1929 * Arnold von Guilleaume, 1929 * Jean Marchand, 1929 * Mossey Kogan, 1929 * H.

Moorcroft travelled extensively throughout the Himalayas, Tibet and Central Asia, eventually reaching Bukhara, in present-day Uzbekistan. ==Early life and education== Moorcroft was born in Ormskirk, Lancashire, the illegitimate son of Ann Moorcroft, daughter of a local farmer. He was baptised in 1767 in St Peter & St Paul, the Parish Church of Ormskirk, where there is a commemorative plaque to his life. His family had sufficient means to secure an apprenticeship with a surgeon in Liverpool but during this time an unknown disease decimated cattle herds in Lancashire and young William was recruited to treat stricken animals. His proficiency so impressed the county landowners they offered to underwrite his education if he would abandon surgery to attend a veterinarian college in Lyon, France. He arrived in France in the revolutionary year of 1789 and became the first Englishman to qualify as a veterinary surgeon. On completing his course he began practice in London, established a \\"hospital for horses\\" on Oxford Street, helped found the first British veterinary college, proposed new surgical methods for curing lameness in horses, and acquired four patents on machines to manufacture horseshoes. In 1795, Moorcroft published a pamphlet of directions for the medical treatment of horses, with special reference to India, and in 1800 a Cursory Account of the Methods of Shoeing Horses. ==Superintendent of stud== In 1803 a citizen army was mobilised to defend Britain against a threatened Napoleonic invasion. Moorcroft joined the Westminster Volunteer Cavalry. His activities with the volunteers brought him to the attention of Edward Parry, a director of the East India Company (EIC). Parry recruited Moorcroft to manage the Company stud in Bengal. In 1808 Moorcroft left the comforts of his home and the security of his thriving practice for Calcutta, India, the seat of British rule. Everywhere the new Superintendent of Stud looked upon his arrival he found depressing signs of laxness, neglect and ignorance. Often undersized mares were bred with local stallions, the best colts were kept back and stud books falsified. Nevertheless, under his care the stud rapidly improved. He took brisk charge of his staff and weeded out deficient horses. Moorcroft became the first to cultivate oats on a large scale in India and set aside at Pusa for its production. In 1811 Moorcroft travelled extensively in the northern sub- continent in search of better breeding stock. Despite travelling to Lucknow, the capital of Oudh, and to Benares, then still part of Maratha territory, Moorcorft failed to acquire the ideal breeding horses that he sought. In Benares he learned that Bukhara was rumoured to have \\"the greatest horse market in the world.\\" Moorcroft recruited a Persian named Mir Izzat-Allah to make a scouting trip to Bukhara and map out the route. He also learned that fine breeding horses might be found in Tibet. ==Expedition to Tibet== Disguised as gosains (Hindu trading pilgrims), Moorcroft and Captain William Hearsey, carrying a stock of merchandise for the purpose of establishing trade relations between India and Central Asia, travelled the upper Ganges through the foothills of the Himalayas. They left Joshimath, well within the mountains, on 26May 1812. Proceeding along the valley of the Dauli, a tributary of the Ganges, they reached the summit of the frontier pass of Niti on 1July. Here they were met by Rawats who were under strict orders from Tibet to repel the foreigners. With his charm, the promise of gain, and proficient use of his medical kit, Moorcroft gained the friendship of two influential Rawats, Deb Singh and his brother Bir Singh. The orders from Tibet were ignored and Amer Singh, the son of Bir Singh, was recruited to serve as a guide through the Niti pass and over the Tibetan plateau. Arriving at the town of Daba they awaited permission to proceed to Gartok seat of the Garpon, (Governor of western Tibet). The Garpon agreed to sell them cashmir shawl wool, and granted permission for them to travel to the sacred lake of Manasarowar. Moorcroft reached the main upper branch of the Indus near its source, and on 5August arrived at Lake Manasarovar, which they explored extensively. Returning via the Sutlej valley, he was detained for some time by the Gorkhas in Nepal, but eventually reached Calcutta in November, only to be chastised severely by the EIC for his failure to find horses‚Äîthey were not interested in shawl wool or Tibetan lakes. ==Bukhara== The journey to Tibet only served to whet Moorcroft's appetite for more extensive travel. But when he broached the idea of a new horse buying expedition to Bukhara in 1816, a searing reply from the EIC Board of Managers warned Moorcroft to keep \\"steady\\" at his stud duties and not \\"waste his time\\" on \\"wild and romantick (sic) excursions to the banks of the Amoo (Oxus) and the plains of Chinese Tartary.\\" What Moorcroft coveted most were the Turkoman horses, with their pale golden coats, narrow chests, long necks and sturdy legs. The \\"good Turcoman horses\\" that Marco Polo had described some 500 years earlier could travel a day for weeks on end. Their descendants, the Akhal-Teke, are bred to this day in Turkmenistan and Russia. Moorcroft persisted in his quest and his seven-year campaign was finally rewarded in May 1819 when Charles Metcalfe, head of the EIC's Political and Secret Department, granted him leave to proceed. Metcalfe's goal was to use his friend as an intelligence scout on his epic journey. Moorcroft's preparations took nearly a year. His roster of recruits included the Persian, Mir Izzat Khan, who had already made the trip alone some years before and an Afghan, Gulam Hyder Khan from his previous expedition to Tibet. Nineteen-year-old George Trebeck, a recent arrival in Calcutta, was selected as second in command. The total expedition totalled 300 persons, including an escort of 12 Gurkas, sixteen horses and mules along with ¬£4,000 of trading goods as well as medical supplies and equipment. Leaving the main caravan at the border of the Punjab on the Sutlej River, Moorcroft travelled separately to Lahore to obtain permission from Maharaja Ranjit Singh to traverse his territory. This was finally granted in mid May 1820. He then met up with Trebeck and the rest of his party at Sultanpur in the Kulu valley in August. From there the caravan trekked up the Beas River, crossed the Rohtang Pass and descended into the Lahul valley and the city of Leh, capital of the Buddhist kingdom of Ladakh. Leh was reached on 24September where several months were spent exploring the surrounding country. A commercial treaty was concluded with the government of Ladakh, by which the whole of Central Asia was virtually opened to British trade in exchange for British protection. Unfortunately, this treaty would have required the Ladakhi's to break relations with Ranjit Singh, the Maharajah of the Sikh Empire. The EIC placed a high value on its alliance with Ranjit Singh so once again Moorcroft had overstepped his authority. His engagement with Ladakh was repudiated and his salary suspended. In all nearly two years were spent in Ladakh, awaiting permission from the Chinese in Yarkand to proceed. While exploring Ladakh he had a chance encounter with another European, Alexander Csoma de K≈ër√∂s a penniless Hungarian philologist from Transylvania. Csoma was searching for the ancient Asian roots of the Hungarian language in the Tibetan tongue. Moorcroft shared his own Tibetan dictionary with the traveller and although Csoma failed to prove his thesis he is now widely seen as the founder of Tibetology. It was Moorcroft who steered Csoma towards the compilation of the first Tibetan- English dictionary and grammar book for the EIC. Moorcroft continued his journey, reaching Kashmir on 3November 1822, Jalalabad on 4June 1824, and Kabul on 20 June. He and his companions were the first Europeans to see the Buddhas of Bamiyan and the first Englishmen to see the upper Oxus. They reached Bokhara on 25 February 1825, but found none of the rumored horses and also learned that a Russian mission had reached Bokhara four years before. Returning, at , in Afghan Turkestan, Moorcroft was seized with fever, of which he died on 27August 1825, with Trebeck surviving him by only a few days. However, according to the Abb√© Huc, Moorcroft reached Lhasa in 1826, and lived there twelve years, being assassinated on his way back to India in 1838, although this story of Moorcroft's \\"second life\\" has been explained by late 20th-century research as unlikely.Recent Research on Ladakh 4 & 5: Proceedings of the Fourth and Fifth International Colloquia on Ladakh ‚Äì Routledge 1996 In 1841, Moorcroft's papers were obtained by the Asiatic Society, and published under the editorship of H.

Kreis was born in Eltville am Rhein in Hesse-Nassau. He first came to prominence with his 1896 submission for the V√∂lkerschlachtdenkmal in Leipzig, although the commission went to Bruno Schmitz. Around the turn of the century, Kreis designed 58 of the Bismarck Towers, a number of civic projects in Dresden, the 1924 William Marx house, and other significant projects. The 1926 Rheinhalle (today:Tonhalle D√ºsseldorf) in D√ºsseldorf was his first major cultural project, followed by the German Hygiene Museum in Dresden. As opposed to the modernist movement then emerging, Kreis was among those architects like Heinrich Tessenow and Paul Bonatz who continued to work in a historical, conservative style. Kreis was dismissed from the presidency of the League of German Architects (BDA) in 1933 and he saw his commissions dry up as a result. But within two years he was again working, under the direction of Albert Speer, for war projects in Dresden and the gigantic plans for Berlin, notably the design for the massive Soldiers Hall. Employing the respected Kreis brought Speer some legitimacy; Kreis responded by becoming an active supporter of National Socialism. He was named as one of the Reich's most important artists in the Gottbegnadeten list of September 1944. In the postwar period, Kreis continued to receive commissions despite his advanced age.

It is the longest runic inscription in Uppland and the second longest one in Sweden after the R√∂k runestone. ==Description== The inscription on the Hillersj√∂ stone, which is 2.8 by 1.0 meters, consists of runic text in the younger futhark that is carved on an intertwined serpent. The main text is written on the serpent with extraneous information, such as the fact that \\"√ûorbj√¥rn Skald carved the runes,\\" carved outside of the serpent. The inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. The runic text indicates that Gerl√∂g married with Germund when she was very young, and they had a son who is not named. Germund drowned and the son died. Then Gerl√∂g remarried with Gudrik and they had several children, but only one survived, who was named Inga. Inga married Ragnfast of Snottsta and they had a son who is not named. Both Ragnfast and the son died and so Inga inherited the estate Snottsta. Inga then married Eric, but both soon died without leaving any children. This meant that Gerl√∂g inherited her daughter's property. It has been noted that the chain of inheritance documented on the Hillersj√∂ stone, including how property passed to women through their children, is consistent with the inheritance rules later codified in the 1296 Uppland Law. This text is completed with information from runestone U 20/U 21, where it is said that both Gudrik (Gerl√∂g's second husband and Inga's father) and Eric (Inga's second husband) had died. The estate Snottsta (also spelled Sn√•ttsta) still exists. At Snottsta and the neighboring Vreta there are several other runestones that complete the saga of Inga that are called the Snottsta and Vreta stones. The runic text begins with the imperitive Ra√∞ √æu! which is translated as \\"Interpret!\\" Other runestones with similar imperitive exclamations in their runic texts include U 328 in Stora Lundby and S√∂ 158 in √ñsterberga. p. 197. On the Hillersj√∂ stone, Ra√∞ √æu! is carved on the eye of the serpent, perhaps indicating that the stone as a record of inheritance was intended for the public. The inscription is signed by the runemaster √ûorbj√¥rn Skald, who also signed the runestone U 532 at Roslags-Bro. Other inscriptions have been attributed to him, including several stones signed only with \\"√ûorbj√¥rn.\\" He was likely selected as the runemaster for his composition of the Hillersj√∂ stone's text in alliterative verse known as h√∂jningar, a traditional style which uses half-lines characterized by two stressed and accented or rising syllables. pp. 30-31. The Stockholm County Museum presents the story of Gerl√∂g and Inga as a dramatic real life family saga which was documented for posterity on this runestone sometime between 1060 and 1100.Estrid - Stockholm L√§ns Museum presentation. Local theater associations nearby have conducted plays which recreate the rather dramatic tale of Gerl√∂g. ==Transliteration into Latin letters== :ra√æ √æu kai Ämuntr -ik * kai Ä[l]a[uk *] (m)aytumi i √æa * finku * √æau sun * a√æ han * trukna√æi * in sun to : si√æan : √æa + fi(k) (h)(u)- --√ærik * ha- ...

After the elections on 12 March 2006, the party became one of the most important in the new Congress, receiving 20 seats in the lower house and 15 in the upper house. Along with the Social Party of National Unity, or \\"Party of the U\\" (the largest party in the lower house and the second-largest in the upper house) and the Conservative Party, it was president √Ålvaro Uribe's main ally in Congress and formed part of his majority. The party is regularly troubled by criminal or corruption cases. ==HistoryOrigin=== After the tenure of president Ernesto Samper (1994-1998), a faction of the Liberal Party was not happy with the new social democratic route the party was moving towards. As such, a more right-wing faction of the party split away and formed Radical Change. However, it did not run for either parliamentary or presidential elections during the 1990s. ==Uribe government== In the 2002 elections, the party won two seats in the Senate and seven in the chamber of representatives. The party joined a coalition with the government of √Ålvaro Uribe, and voted in favor of the re- electionist project; this involved changing sections of the constitution that prevent a president from running for a second term. 2006 was their best electoral year. They became the 4th largest political group in Congress with 15 senators and 18 representatives. They remained in coalition with the Uribe administration and supported his candidacy for re-election. German Vargas Lleras, then leader of the party and senator, became one of the Senate's most active voices. ===Breakup=== The biggest party in Congress (and Uribe's new U Party) proposed to change the constitution, yet again, to allow the president to run for a third term. The party was divided between those who wanted a second direct re-election for a third term and those who were against it. Vargas Lleras was among those opposed. Although a third term was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, the damage was done and those who still supported Uribe quit the party to run for Congress in the 2010 parliamentary elections with the newly-formed U party. The party suffered big blows in 2010, losing votes and members in both chambers: seven Senators and two Representatives. Vargas Lleras then ran as the candidate in the 2010 presidential election, finishing in third place in the first round. The party then joined the first-round winner, Juan Manuel Santos, along with the Liberal Party and the Conservative party to form the \\"National Unity Pact\\" that would work together for the next four years. ===National Unity Pact=== The party assisted the government with most of their agenda in Congress. When the peace talks with the FARC began, the party offered their approval and criticized then ex-President √Ålvaro Uribe for opposing dialogue. In 2014, the party participated in the parliamentary elections and joined in a coalition with Santos for his reelection. Vargas Lleras was named the vice-presidential candidate. Although the party received fewer votes than in 2010, they added one senator, but lost one seat in the lower chamber. Santos won the second round of the presidential elections that year, making the vice-presidential position the highest the party had ever achieved. ==References * Official web site * Democracia a distancia: Elecciones 2006 (Portalcol.com) (Information about the party's list of candidates to the Colombian Senate).

Since 1998, the mall has been owned and operated by the Simon Property Group. It is home to four major department stores, 179 specialty shops and boutiques, and a food court. It is . The anchors are Macy's, Macy's Men's & Home, JCPenney, and Nordstrom with one vacant anchor last occupied by Sears that has yet to be redeveloped into Life Time Fitness, retail, entertainment, and apartments. ==History== Interior of Brea Mall in May 2007 The mall opened in 1977. Originally, the mall was anchored by Sears and May Company California. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Later, The Broadway was added, and Nordstrom opened their second California store. J. W. Robinson's and a larger Nordstrom were then constructed along with a Y-shaped addition to the main mall in the early 1990s. In 1993, The May Department Stores Company merged J. W. Robinson's and May Company California to form Robinsons-May. As a result, the J. W. Robinson's store was sold to JCPenney, and the May Company California location was renamed and expanded. The Broadway was converted to Macy's after Federated Department Stores, Inc.'s purchase of The Broadway's parent company Carter Hawley Hale Stores in 1996. In 2006, due to the merger between Federated Department Stores and The May Department Stores Company, the Robinsons-May location was converted to a Macy's furniture store. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Brea Mall also had an ice skating rink that was later removed to expand the food court. The Brea Mall has also been host to recording artists such as Ashlee Simpson, M√Ωa, Ryan Cabrera, and The Summer Obsession. On January 4, 2018, Sears announced that its Brea store would be closing as part of a plan to close 103 stores nationwide. The store closed on April 8, 2018, making it the last original anchor store to close. On April 9, 2018, Simon announced plans to repurpose the Sears with a Life Time Fitness as well as new retail, entertainment, and apartments on three levels. The first phase is expected to open in the fall of 2020, with the remaining phases expected to open in 2021. It is one of the five malls owned by Simon that had Sears closed planned to be redeveloped. By June, Pink's Hot Dogs opened their own restaurant here. == Fame == The mall was featured in the Jeffries Fan Club song: \\"JFC Where Did You Go\\" on their 1999 album JFC Sucks: The Early Years.

This composition runs 10.000 verses and describes the landscape as well as the conquest of the territory. The word was reintroduced in Argentina manuscrita, a prose chronicle by Ruy D√≠az de Guzm√°n. Argentine literature began around 1550 with the work of Mat√≠as Rojas de Oquendo and Pedro Gonz√°lez de Prado (from Santiago del Estero, the first important urban settlement in Argentina), who wrote prose and poetry. They were partly inspired by oral aboriginal poetry‚Äîin particular, according to Carlos Abreg√∫ Virreyra, by the lules, jur√≠es, diaguitas and tonocot√©s. A symbiosis emerged between the aboriginal and Spanish traditions, creating a distinct literature, geographically limited (well into the 18th century) to the Argentine north and central regions, with the province of C√≥rdoba as its center, due to the foundation of the National University of C√≥rdoba. Two names stand out from this period: Gaspar Ju√°rez Baviano, and Antonia de la Paz y Figueroa, also known as \\"Beata Antula\\". Gradually, with the economic prosperity of the port, the cultural axis moved eastward. The letters of the colonial age (Viceroyalty-neoclassicism, baroque and epic) grew under the protection of the independentist fervor: Vicente L√≥pez y Planes, Pantale√≥n Rivarola and Esteban de Luca. During the 17th century, Argentine baroque literature was poor in comparison with that from Europe and some other parts of the New World. The only remarkable poet of this period was fray Jos√© Luis de Tejeda who wrote Coronas l√≠ricas and El peregrino de Babilonia ===Cultural independence from Spain=== salon of the 1837 generation. As in the rest of the continent, strong feelings of emancipation from Spain were present in Argentina. Before independence, some neoclassical authors such as Juan Cruz Varela produced numerous works related with this revolutionary spirit but still under the paradoxical Spanish domain. Argentina's true break with Spanish tradition was manifested in literature through the adoption of French romanticism as a model, postulating the return to popular sources and to the medieval. This aesthetic and intellectual was brought by Esteban Echeverr√≠a who wrote the first local and realistic story, El Matadero (\\"The slaughterhouse\\"), as well as the nativist poem La Cautiva (\\"The Captive\\"), with the Pampas as its background. His barbed wit and opposition to powerful Buenos Aires governor Juan Manuel de Rosas forced him into exile. In the middle of the 19th century Jos√© M√°rmol published the first Argentine novel, Amalia (1851‚Äì1852), a historical novel set during the dark year of 1840 which mixed fictional characters (Amalia, Daniel Bello, Eduardo Belgrano) with actual historical characters like Juan Manuel de Rosas.Mar√≠a Minellono. \\"Entre el follet√≠n y la novela hist√≥rica; el problema del g√©nero en Amalia de Jos√© M√°rmol\\" As Rosas' power increased, more literary works from the opposition were produced, such as Juan Bautista Alberdi's play El Gigante Amapolas, a good example of local sainete. In the genre of essay, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento published his Facundo, a particular (re)vision of Facundo Quiroga's life from a deterministic point of view. Sarmiento conveyed aspects of sociology and semiotics in this analysis. Echeverr√≠a, M√°rmol and Sarmiento are among the group of writers known as Generaci√≥n del 37, who are considered the first generation of local intellectuals. Poetry lessened in combative spirit and turned towards the anecdotal and sentimental: Carlos Guido y Spano and Ricardo Guti√©rrez, the chronicle writers of folk literature. Lucio V. Mansilla published in 1870 Una excursi√≥n a los indios ranqueles, a sort of chronicle of a voluntary expedition to sign a peace treaty with the Indians. His work (enrolled in a realistic aesthetic) anticipated Generaci√≥n del '80, which would be deeply influenced by modernism. Juana Manuela Gorriti was one of the first popular female writers, mainly due to her melodramatic narrative works like the novel La hija del mazorquero and the foundation of La alborada, a cultural magazine. ===Literatura Gauchesca=== Cover of Mart√≠n Fierro by Jos√© Hern√°ndez, 1894 edition. European-oriented, indeed Euro-centric, themes and styles would remain the norm in Argentine letters, especially from Buenos Aires, during this century. The (romantic) poetry as La cautiva or the latter Santos Vega by Rafael Obligado gave a lot of importance to the nature of the pampa,Eduardo Romano. El nativismo como ideolog√≠a en \\"Santos Vega\\" de Rafael Obligado: Editorial Biblos sharing some elements with a picturesque, imitation-gaucho literature, purporting to use the language of the gauchos and to reflect their mentality. The first current is known as poes√≠a nativista (nativist poetry) and became a literary tradition. The second (known as poes√≠a gauchesca) developed in parallel as a part of that generation's understanding of national identity. Although it also is a product of literary authors, this writing takes the voice of the gaucho as protagonist from the beginning. Gauchesca is related to payador's singing, a payador being a modern equivalent of the illiterate medieval singers. A payador's work, in opposition to gauchesca, is sung spontaneously.Wikipedia article The first gauchesco author was Bartolom√© Hidalgo who wrote during the war of independence and therefore his works had a strong political ideology. His compositions were mainly cielitos (payadoresque songs but with provocative political messages) and di√°logos patri√≥ticos (conversations between two characters about current affairs). In a second period, gauchesca was influenced by political-faction fights. Estanislao del Campo, and Hilario Ascasubi are the most representative writers of this period. Del Campo wrote Fausto, a poem which has been read both as a parody of gauchesca and an intelligent joke towards city people.Enrique Anderson Imbert. Pr√≥logo a Fausto. Buenos Aires: Editorial de Belgrano In the poem, Anastasio El Pollo meets a friend and tells him his impressions on particular event: he has seen the Devil. What El Pollo doesn't know (or pretends he doesn't) is that all he saw was actually an opera performance at Teatro Col√≥n.Enrique Anderson Imbert. An√°lisis de Fausto. Buenos Aires: CEAL, 1968 The last author of gauchesca is Jos√© Hern√°ndez, the author of Mart√≠n Fierro. Gauchesca leaves its political influences and becomes social in the sense that gauchos are disappearing, mainly due to Sarmiento and the new economic model. Hern√°ndez is considered the responsible for consolidating the gauchesco style. ===Generation of 1880=== The generation of 1880 emphasized the European color and cultural supremacy of Buenos Aires. The migratory current of mixed ethnicity accentuated the change of the big village for the cosmopolitan metropolis. The poetry of this period is lyric: Leopoldo D√≠az y Almafuerte. The latter usually depicts the worker's life in passionate attacks against the contradictions of contemporary society. Almafuerte (pseudonym of Pedro Bonifacio Palacios) was also a teacher and a journalist whose opinions and articles gave him a lot of problems. Essay is a recent genre that developed in the late 19th century: Jos√© Manuel Estrada, Pedro Goyena and Joaqu√≠n V. Gonz√°lez. Narrative works oscillated between social issues and folk literature. The predominant tendency was Realism, best represented by Miguel Can√© in his autobiographical novel Juvenilia. Other writers influenced by realism were Lucio V. Mansilla, Francisco Sicardi, Benito Lynch and Carlos Mar√≠a Ocantos. Naturalism was also an important tendency towards the end of the century. Argentine Naturalism was commanded by Eugenio Cambaceres in his novels Sin rumbo and M√∫sica sentimental, almost forgotten today. Cambaceres was inspired by √âmile Zola's theory about the naturalistic approach to literary work, but its ideology suffered considerable alterations. Juli√°n Martel and Antonio Argerich with added a highly loaded moral touch to Argentine naturalism. ===Modern=== Adolfo Bioy Casares, Victoria Ocampo and Jorge Luis Borges in Mar del Plata, 1935. Towards the end of the 19th century, led by the Nicaraguan Rub√©n Dar√≠o, modernism appears in Latin American literature. Preciosity of manner and a strong influence from Symbolism sum up the new genre, which inspires the clearest voice in poetry, Leopoldo Lugones, who was the author of the first Argentine science fiction story. The first truly modern generation in Argentine literature is the Martinfierristas (c. 1922). The movement contributes an intellectual doctrine in which a number of current trends come together: the trend represented by the Florida group, adscript to ultra√≠smo, with Oliverio Girondo, Jorge Luis Borges, Leopoldo Marechal and Macedonio Fern√°ndez; and the trend of Boedo, impressed by Russian realism, with Ra√∫l Gonz√°lez Tu√±√≥n, C√©sar Tiempo y El√≠as Catelnuovo. Ricardo G√ºiraldes, however, remains classical in style, giving a whole new freshness to gauchesca poetry and writing what is perhaps the novel, Don Segundo Sombra. Benito Lynch (1885‚Äì1951), an eccentric short-story writer who, like G√ºiraldes, does not easily fit into any \\"generation\\", wrote his quirky tales in an enchanted neo-gauchoesque manner about this time. Between the end of this decade and the beginning of the following one emerged the Nov√≠simos (\\"Newest\\"), a generation of poets (Arturo Cambours Ocampo, Carlos Carlino and Jos√© Portogalo), fiction writers (Arturo Cerretani, Roberto Arlt, Luis Maria Albamonte and Luis Horacio Vel√°zquez) and playwrights (Roberto Valenti, Juan Oscar Ponferrada and Javier Villafa√±e). The group promoted philosophical reflection and a new essence for Argentinidad. Leopoldo Marechal's novel Ad√°n Buenosayres, published in 1948 and praised by Julio Cort√°zar in 1949. Also worthy of note is the literary work of Leonardo Castellani (1899‚Äì1981), a Jesuit priest who left a considerable bulk of essays, novels, tales and poetry. Expelled from the Company of Jesus, the outspoken Castellani was also widely ignored ‚Äì like his contemporary Marechal ‚Äì by the literary intelligentsia of his time due to his nationalist ideology. ===Generation of '37=== The Generation of 1937 centers on poetry, where it developed the descriptive, nostalgic and meditative in the work of Ricardo E. Molinari, Vicente Barbieri, Olga Orozco, Le√≥n Benar√≥s and Alfonso Sola Gonz√°les. Fiction writers subscribed to idealism and magic realism, Mar√≠a Granata, Adolfo Bioy Casares, Julio Cort√°zar, Silvina Ocampo) or to a subtler form of realism Manuel Mujica La√≠nez, Ernesto L. Castro, Ernesto Sabato and Abelardo Arias) with some urban touches, as well as folk literature (Joaqu√≠n G√≥mez Bas and Roger Pl√°). Essayists do not abound. Antonio Pag√©s Larraya, Emilio Carilla, Luis Soler Ca√±as are some of the few who stand out, although the greatest Argentine essayist after Sarmiento ‚Äì Ezequiel Mart√≠nez Estrada ‚Äì also belonged to the Generation of '37. Many of these writers and a number of European ones contributed extensively to Sur, a literary journal published by Victoria Ocampo, a noted commentator on the day's culture. ===Neohumanism, Existentialism and other influences=== Julio Cort√°zar in 1967, photograph by Sara Facio. In 1950, another milestone arose: the New Humanism, a response to World War II and its aftermath. On one level are avant-gardists like Ra√∫l Gustavo Aguirre, Edgar Bayley and Julio Llin√°s; on another, existentialists: Jos√© Isaacson, Julio Ar√≠stides and Miguel √Ångel Viola. Further away are those who reconcile both tendencies with a regionalist tendency: Alfredo Veirav√©, Jaime D√°valos and Alejandro Nicotra. Other fiction writers left a highly charged testimony of the times: Beatriz Guido, David Vi√±as, Marco Denevi and Silvina Bullrich. In a majority of the writers, a strong influence of Anglo- Saxon and Italian poetry can be perceived. Of particular interest are the poetic works of two of Marechal's disciples, the poets Rafael Squirru and Fernando Demar√≠a. A new trend started in 1960, continuing until about 1990. Its influences are heterogeneous: Sartre, Camus, Eluard; some Spanish writers, like Camilo Jos√© Cela; and previous Argentine writers like Borges, Arlt, Cort√°zar and Marechal. Two trends were in evidence: the tracing of metaphysical time and historicity (Horacio Salas, Alejandra Pizarnik, Ram√≥n Plaza) and the examination of urban and social disarray: (Abelardo Castillo, Marta Lynch, Manuel Puig, Alicia Steinberg). ===Dirty War=== The 1970s were a dark period for intellectual creation in Argentina. The epoch is characterised by the exile (Juan Gelman, Antonio Di Benedetto) or death (Roberto Santoro, Haroldo Conti, and Rodolfo Walsh) of major writers. The remaining literary journalists, like Liliana Heker, veiled their opinions in their work. Some journalists (Rodolfo Walsh), poets (Agust√≠n Taviti√°n and Antonio Aliberti), fiction writers (Osvaldo Soriano, Fernando Sorrentino), and essayists (Ricardo Herrera, Mar√≠a Rosa Lojo) stood out among the vicissitudes and renewed the field of ethical and aesthetic ideas. ===Current=== The 1990s are marked by reunion among survivors of different generations, in an intellectual coalition for the review of values and texts as Argentina faced the end of the century. Some examples are Alan Pauls, Mario Areca, An√≠bal Cristobo, Ernesto de Sanctis, Marco Denevi, Edgar Brau and some more. ==See also== *Latin American Boom *Latin American literature *Latin American poetry *Cultural movement ==NotesReferences== * ==Further reading== * Arce, Emilia Isabel. \\"La institucionalizaci√≥n del rol materno durante gobiernos autoritarios: respuestas de escritoras argentinas y brasile√±as a la construcci√≥n patriarcal de g√©nero y naci√≥n.\\" (Archive) (PhD thesis).

The 1925 and 1938 teams claimed National Champions status due to their undefeated records and defeats of other top national teams, but the 1925 claim is considered a mythical national championship because there was no tournament.

The party also has functions as a non-profit organization. It has representation in the Chamber of Representatives and in the Senate of the Congress of the Republic of Colombia, and has also participated in the public corporations of Colombia at a regional level, being stated as the eight most influential political force in the country. Commonly, the party is known in Colombia as \\"Movimiento MIRA\\" or just \\"MIRA\\". Members and affiliates are known as \\"Miraists\\", and their ideology is called Miraism. On a global level, MIRA has been registered with the World Intellectual Property Organization of the United Nations since September 27, 2011. Miraism has presence in many American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, USA, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Peru, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, as well as in some European countries: the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. In Asia, it is present in Japan. At the elections of 2002 the party won as one of the many small parties parliamentary representation. The MIRA Movement took part in the legislative elections of 2006, in which it won 1 out of 165 deputies and 2 out of 100 senators. In 2018, MIRA took part in the legislative elections, in which it won 1 out of 166 deputies and 3 out of 102 senators. The current party Chairman is Carlos Eduardo Guevara. ==HistoryFoundation=== Carlos Alberto Baena, Chairman of the MIRA party The MIRA party was created on 2 March 2000 by Carlos Alberto Baena and Alexandra Moreno Piraquive, being elected as party Chairman and Vice chairwoman, respectively. On 20 June of the same year, they requested legal recognition of the party by the National Electoral Council of Colombia, which they obtained on 26 July under the name \\"Independent Movement of Absolute Renovation\\". ===First elections=== The first elections in which the MIRA party participated were the regional elections of 28 October 2000. In Bogota D.C., Carlos Alberto Baena was elected councillor thanks to 20,701 votes. In the Quind√≠o department, the economist Bernardo Valencia Cardona was elected deputy. In the Risaralda department, Martha Cecilia Alzate was elected deputy. Besides, the party obtained councillors in several municipalities and seats in several Local Administrative Units. In total, the party obtained 53 curule seats, becoming the 18th political force in the Colombian politic spectrum. Two years later, in the parliamentary elections of 2002, Alexandra Moreno Piraquive gets 81,061 votes, the highest number of votes reached by a woman running for senator in that period, and becomes senator of the Republic of Colombia. ===Chairmanship of Alexandra Moreno=== Alexandra Moreno Piraquive, Former Senator of Colombia On 26 October 2003, the MIRA party participated in the parliamentary elections and kept Baena's position as councillor thanks to 24,277 votes and the position of Bernardo Valencia as deputy of the Assembly of Quind√≠o thanks to 10,743 votes. The party also obtained 84 curule seats, included 10 councillor curule seats. In this period, Alexandra Moreno assumed the chairmanship of the party.

Europe's largest network association in the field of management development, it has over 890 member organizations from academia, business, public service and consultancy in 88 countries (as of September 2017). EFMD provides a forum for networking in management development. EFMD operates the EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS), which is one of the leading international systems of quality assessment, improvement, and accreditation of higher education institutions in management and business administration. It is comparable to its American equivalent Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business and provides a forum for information, research, networking and debate on innovation and best practice in management development. The foundation also runs the EFMD Programme Accreditation System (EPAS) for programmes as well as the EFMD Deans Across Frontiers development programme (EDAF) and the Business School Impact System (BSIS). == Types of accreditation == While the EQUIS accreditation process, which is valid for an entire school (or faculty), is the main type of accreditation EFMD offers, there are a variety of other accreditations available. With EPAS it is possible for business schools to have certain degree programs accredited rather than the entire school. This variant somewhat resembles the AMBA (Association of MBAs) accreditation, as the London-based Association accredits the school's entire portfolio of MBA programs, but does not accredit the entire business school. EFMD also offers an accreditation for online courses (EOCCS) and for corporate learning (CLIP). == EFMD activities == EFMD is the European partner in the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS), a joint venture with Shanghai Jiaotong University established as the first international business school with autonomous status in 1994 under an agreement between the European Commission and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. EFMD is also founding partner of the Global Foundation for Management Education (GFME), which is a joint venture with the US-based Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International). EFMD organizes conferences and seminars around the world for management development industry and published the Global Focus magazine. In 2009, EFMD received an EU grant worth ‚Ç¨2.2m for a project that aims to improve the efficiency of Cuban companies by providing training to senior managers. This project, called Consolidating and Strengthening Cuban Managerial Capabilities, is to be implemented under the leadership of EFMD together with ESADE, a business school in Barcelona, and the Cuban Ministry of Higher Education. ==References *official website Category:Educational organisations based in Belgium Category:Management education Category:Educational organizations based in Europe Category:1972 establishments in Belgium ","title":"European Foundation for Management Development"},{"id":"2228693","text":"{ border=1 align=\\"right\\" cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 style=\\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" -

Gemeindebau (; plural: Gemeindebauten) is a German word for \\"municipality building\\". Gemeinde and Bau in Wiktionary. It refers to residential buildings erected by a municipality, usually to provide public housing. Apartments in the building can be rented from the respective municipality. ==ViennaHistory=== Gemeindebauten have become an important part of the architecture and culture of Vienna since the 1920s. Up to 1918, the housing conditions of Vienna's growing working class were appalling by modern standards. City investigators routinely discovered unsanitary living conditions during inspections, with issues of overcrowding, excessive moisture, and a complete lack of light and air being among the most frequently cited problems. By 1877, the municipal health authority of the city (the Stadtfysikat) reported 1,113 instances of unfit dwellings, over two-thirds of which were cited for excess moisture. Overcrowding was also a perennial issue, and one case documented in the municipal health report of 1871 found that When the Social Democratic Party of Austria gained control of the municipal administration during Austria's First Republic (1918-1934) (so called \\"Red Vienna\\"), it began the project of improving living conditions for workers. A large number of Gemeindebauten, usually large residential estates, were built during that time. Including those buildings that were finished after the events of February 1934, 64,000 apartments where completed, which created housing space for about 220,000 people. Apartments were assigned on the basis of a point system favoring families and less affluent citizens. The classic interwar Gemeindebauten typically have a main entrance with a large gate, through which one enters into a yard. Inside, there are trees and some greenery, where children can play without having to go out on the street. Apartments are accessed from the inside. This fortress-like structure made the buildings adaptable to military use. Several Gemeindebauten in Vienna, most notably the Karl-Marx-Hof, were sites of fighting during the Austrian Civil War of February 1934, when they were defended as Social Democratic Party strongholds. Gemeindebauten continued to be built after 1945, but the style of architecture changed over the decades. During the 1960s and 1970s, the municipality began to build extensive residential blocks consisting of high- rise buildings such as Gro√üfeldsiedlung. ===Characteristics=== The Sandleitenhof and tobacconist in the 16th district Ottakring Gemeindebauten in Vienna can be recognized by the following text (or similar) which can usually be found in large red letters above the main entrance: Wohnhausanlage der Gemeinde Wien errichtet in den Jahren 1925 bis 1927 aus den Mitteln der Wohnbausteuer (Residential estate of the Municipality of Vienna built from 1925 to 1927 financed from the revenues of the Residential Construction Tax). Larger Gemeindebauten are identified by their name. The names sometimes derive from the building's geographic location, but usually they are named after a person, sometimes after a famous freedom fighter (e.g., George Washington), but much more often after a famous socialist (e.g., Olof Palme) or a Viennese Social Democratic Party functionary. Today, about 600,000 people (not necessarily poor ones), about a third of the population of Vienna, live in apartments owned by the city. As the Social Democratic Party has been firmly in control of the municipal administration since World War II, opposition politicians sometimes claim that party members are more likely to be assigned an apartment. ===Notable Gemeindebauten=== The most famous Gemeindebau in Vienna is the Karl-Marx-Hof, built between 1927-33. Other notable buildings are: *Lassalle-Hof (1926) *Rabenhof (1927) *Metzleinstaler Hof (1920) *Reumannhof (1926) *Viktor-Adler-Hof (1924) *George-Washington-Hof (1930) *Sandleitenhof (1928) *Wohnhausanlage Friedrich-Engels-Platz (1933) *Karl-Seitz-Hof (1933) *Paul-Speiser-Hof (1929) *Goethehof (1930) ==References External links == * * Historical and architectural information on Germeindebauten in German Category:Residential buildings in Vienna Category:Public housing Category:Public housing in Austria Category:German words and phrases ","title":"Gemeindebau"},{"id":"2228696","text":"The Toldi trilogy is an epic poem trilogy by the Hungarian poet J√°nos Arany, inspired by the legendary Mikl√≥s Toldi, who served in the Hungarian King Louis the Great's army in the 14th century.

The parish is approximately south of the Swale and east of Maidstone. The village of Frinsted lies to the east and Bicknor to the north-west; while Hollingbourne is to the south-west. The village lies on an exposed high point of the North Downs, within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Archaeological and toponymic evidence of Wormshill's existence predates its appearance in the Domesday survey of 1086. The village contains a number of heritage-listed buildings, which include a Norman church, a public house and one of the oldest surviving post office buildings in the United Kingdom. The fields and woodland surrounding Wormshill have changed little in the past 500 years, and the village itself remains rural with a low population density compared to the national average. The population of 200 is a mixture of agricultural workers employed by local farms and professional residents who commute to nearby towns. ==HistoryToponymy=== Road sign with the village's name Wormshill was listed under the name Godeselle in the Domesday Book of 1086. The village is thought to be much older, its name deriving from the Anglo-Saxon god W≈çden (a cognate with the Norse god, Odin) and meaning \\"Woden's Hill\\". The area was also described in a paper in Archaeologia Cantiana, 1961, as \\"Wormshill, an ancient possession of the Kings of Kent, the hill where they worshipped the heathen Woden\\"..The Archaeologia Cantiana also attributes the variants \\"Wormeshull\\", \\"Worneselle\\" and \\"Worneshill\\" to the settlement. The University of Nottingham's Institute for Name-Studies has offered the suggestion that the name means \\"shelter for a herd of pigs\\". The Latinised form, Wornesell, appears in the Kent Hundred Rolls of 1274-75 and in a mediaeval will recorded in September 1409. A corruption of the name, Wormsell, is mentioned as the birthplace of a Cistercian Abbot at the nearby Boxley Abbey in 1474; a further variant, Wormysell, is found in a will of 1487, and court papers concerning a land dispute in 1534 use the name Wormeshell. ===Early history=== A 1994 landscape survey identified woodland to the north of the village as having contained ancient flint tools and what appeared to be flint boundary markers, the latter apparently gathered from loose-lying surface flints. The area around the village features ancient deneholes, or agricultural chalk mines, some of which are pre-Roman. These holes, which may be up to deep, were often dug at the edges of fields, onto which the chalk marl would be spread. A Lower Palaeolithic (Acheulian) hand axe was unearthed in the garden of Blacksmiths cottage in the village. In 1966, the remains of a U-shaped mediaeval pastoral enclosure for controlling the movement of stock were recorded in woodland to the north of the village. The extensive woodland in the parish also meant that it was one of several sources of wooden planking for the piers of Rochester Bridge ( away) from the early 11th century (and theoretically was still liable to do so until the passing of the Rochester Bridge Act in 1908). The parish of Wormshill was originally appended to the village and parish of Boughton Malherbe, since both had the same patron; the patron of a parish was the land- owner who often built the church on the estate and who had the right (known as advowson) to appoint the parish priest. The first recorded patron of Wormshill was Robert de Gatton, who owned the Manor of Wormsell during the reign of Henry III (1207-72). From the Gatton family, the village passed by marriage in the 13th century to Sir Simon de Northwood, whose coat of arms appears in the stained glass of St Giles, the village's only church, and whose name (Norwood) is given to the farm at the north of the village. Patronage of the parish subsequently transferred through a number of landholding families, vesting by the 17th century with the prominent Kent family of Sir Charles Sedley, which at times held the barony of Aylesford. During this period the Tylden (or Tilden) family, believed to have had links to the Crusades of Richard I, were also significant landholders in the area in the early 17th century; a memorial to William Tylden, who died in 1613, rests in the north chancel of St Giles church. Around the same time in the late 16th century, recruits of Sir Francis Drake's navy may have used a track, now known as Drake Lane, in the south west of the parish or camped nearby as they marched from the Weald of Kent to the dockyards at Sheerness. Patronage is believed to have lapsed from the Sedley family to the Archbishop of Canterbury and then to Sir Joseph Aylosse before being conveyed by gift from a Mr. Serjeant Moses to the charity of the president and governors of Christ's Hospital in London in gratitude for a University of Cambridge scholarship he had received. As late as 1798 the parish was still paying its traditional castle-guard rent to Dover Castle and retained a court baron; this fee was a substitute for a feudal obligation requiring the provision of knights to defend the castle. Little (if any) information exists about the village's population or demographics before 1801; however evidence from the first census indicates that the village grew steadily, reaching a peak in 1871. A possible indication of the growth in the agricultural output of the village is the construction of two windmills (possibly used for the production of oil from linseed or rapeseed) marked at \\"Beddington\\" (present-day Bedmonton) on Ordnance Survey drawings dated 1797 and an Ordnance Survey map published between 1819 and 1843. The mills stood north and south of each other and were approximately to the north-west of the church. House building continued during the mid-to-late 19th century, and Table indicating parish population 1801-1971. Graphic representation of total houses from census data 1881-1961. together with a post office and school. Like much of rural Kent during the time of the Swing Riots (1830), Wormshill experienced a degree of civil unrest and Home Office records indicate that \\"a large body of men, numbering 50-100\\" assembled at Wormshill with the purpose of \\"intimidation and to enforce demands on farmers ... inducing other labourers to join them\\". ===20th century=== Aerial view of The Street taken on 16 April 1948. The rectory is in the foreground. Records indicate that at least one former resident of the village fought as part of the Australian contingent in the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War. Private Frederick George Kite, born at Wormshill on 16 February 1894, and educated at Wormshill and Milstead, enlisted on 8 September 1915. Originally employed as a fireman, after training at Blackboy and Broadmeadows camps in Victoria, he sailed from Melbourne as part of the Australian Imperial Force, 16th Infantry Battalion aboard HMAT Ceramic A40 on 23 December 1914. He participated in the landing at Gallipoli and was wounded in the left arm and shoulder, ending his active service. During the Second World War, Wormshill joined a number of similar settlements in the region to form part of the anti-invasion network. On the outskirts of the village, near the hamlet of Ringlestone, there are the remains of a zero station (or Operational Base), a secret underground communications relay post operated by Auxiliary Units of the British Home Guard. In the event of a German invasion the zero station was to be used by defending forces to receive and transmit coded messages between a series of similar stations in the area as well as to the operational command headquarters at Hannington Hall in Wiltshire. A concealed underground concrete bunker, it was designed to be invisible from the surface and is located in woodland about from the road. Although its primary purpose was a communications post, the zero station was also designed to hold ammunition and explosives and provide living quarters for the radio equipment operators. Anecdotal evidence also indicates that anti-aircraft guns were sited near the village and that a Bren gun emplacement was installed in the valley between Wormshill and Frinsted. A Diver Battery was located to the south west of the village. Forming part of the Kentish Gun Belt, designed to provide a defence to attacks by V-1 flying bombs or \\"doodlebugs\\", it was armed with eight mobile 3.7-inch guns, and manned by 424 Battery of 138 Regiment of the 40th Anti Aircraft Brigade. It was initially equipped with Predictor AA No.10 and No.3 Mark V radar, and was manned by 57 Brigade in July 1944. There are records of a V-1 being shot down by a Supermarine Spitfire to the west of the village. Flt Lt A. R. Cruikshank is reported as having \\"Sited a Diver north of Ashford and attacked from astern at 100 yards range. Saw strikes and Diver fell and exploded in a field\\". Villagers resident during the war also recall a V-1 being shot down in orchards near Norwood Farm and a fighter aircraft crashing in fields to the south of Yew Tree Farm. Roadside checkpoints were set up on the main routes into the village to the north and south and allied forces moving through the region camped overnight in the area, including a detachment of New Zealand troops in fields near Home Farm. Following an initial decline in the population at the turn of the 20th century, more houses were constructed between the Great War and the Second World War and again in the 1950s and 1960s, adding to the cluster of cottages from the 19th century and earlier. ==Governance== At the time of the Kent Hundred Rolls in 1275, Wormshill was in the Hundred of Eyhorne, a regional sub-division used in the Middle Ages by feudal and crown officials to administer communities. Although the Hundred of Eyhorne (including Wormshill) still exists, it is a mediaeval anachronism and no longer has any practical or administrative significance. In the 19th century, the village was within the lathe of Aylesford, the Bearsted petty sessional division and the Hollingbourne Rural District. The village was also incorporated into the Hollingbourne Poor Law Union (a means of funding and administering the operation of the Poor Laws in the area). The parish of Wormshill in part sits astride the West Kent and East Kent divide, a demarcation which until 1814 applied to an administrative boundary for the purposes of the law courts' Quarter Sessions. According to Edward Hasted (writing in 1798): \\"northward of the church, including the borough of Bedmanton, is in the division of East Kent, but the rest of it, including the church and village, is in that of West Kent\\". This differs from the traditional distinction between Men of Kent and Kentish Men, which are separated by the River Medway, accordingly persons born in Wormshill would be Men of Kent. Since 1975, Wormshill has been administered within the North Downs ward and, together with surrounding communities, elects a representative councillor for the ward in the Borough of Maidstone. The incumbent councillor for the North Downs ward is Patrik Garten. The village forms the central focus of the civil and church parishes of Wormshill. The parish chairman is Simon Bass. Wormshill is part of the parliamentary constituency of Faversham and Mid Kent, whose Member of Parliament is Helen Whately of the Conservative Party. It is also in the South East England constituency in the European Parliament. ==Geography== At , the village is in central Kent, approximately south-east of London. The nearest town is Sittingbourne, to the north. Wormshill is surrounded by villages and hamlets of a similar size, including Frinsted, Bicknor, Bedmonton and Hucking. The village is on a high point of the North Downs. The nearby road intersection of Black Post is recorded on the Ordnance Survey maps at above sea level. The landscape is primarily characterised by undulating calcareous grassland and ancient deciduous woodland over chalk downland. The settlement itself (as opposed to the wider parish) is on a downland ridge between two shallow dip slope valleys that separate it from Bicknor to the north-west and Frinsted to the east. View north up The Street after the unusual heavy snowfall of March 2005 Wormshill's elevated and exposed position on the North Downs means it occasionally experiences extreme weather conditions such as the heavy snowfalls of 11-14 January 1987, March 2005, February 2009 and January 2010. Reports indicating snowfall specifically over the Kent Downs Article indicating North Downs received highest snowfall during relevant period (28cm (11 inches)) Article indicating North Downs to experience heavy snowfall during January 2010 In the late 18th century Hasted commented: \\"Being exposed to the northern aspect, it lies very bleak and cold.\\" Much of the local woodland was devastated by the Great Storm of 1987, which in October swept across south-east England with hurricane-force winds. A significant part of the exposed woodland to the north-east of Wormshill was felled and, after replanting, has only recently shown signs of maturing. An ancient yew tree believed to have stood for several hundred years in the grounds of the house at Norwood Farm was destroyed along with other long- standing trees. However, some 25 years later, the village displays few obvious signs of the damage. The countryside around the village has been described as \\"an area where the whole landscape is a piece of history--a valley where time has stood still and the pattern of woods and fields is much as it was 500 years ago\\". A designated ancient woodland lies to the north-west of the village. A website providing detailed map overlays giving landscape information. Predominantly centred on Barrows Wood but also including High Wood and Trundle Wood, this is likely a remnant of the woodland described by Hasted: \\"... at the northern boundary of the parish there is a considerable quantity of wood, consisting mostly of hazel and oak, with numbers of trees of the latter, interspersed among them, which are but small, never here growing to any size.\\" An ancient track that passes through the remnants of this woodland has been damaged by the use of off-road vehicles leading to attempts by local landowners to block Drake Lane, a byway that runs through Drake Lane Wood in the south-west of the parish and which may have been used by recruits of Sir Francis Drake's navy. Photograph of barriers to four-wheel drive vehicles at Drake Lane. Deep water-logged ruts in the track have resulted in the partial resurfacing of the route. and Photographs of tyre ruts and further barriers to access at Drake Lane. The village stretches primarily along a single carriageway road known as The Street. The north-eastern end of The Street is a designated Conservation Area. The lack of development stems from its position within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and a Site of Nature Conservation Interest, which influences local planning laws and limits permission to build new housing. All development is subject to a high level of scrutiny; any development that would adversely affect the natural beauty of the landscape will automatically be resisted, and large- scale development proposals must be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment. The last major development was that of the residential cul-de-sac Draysfield. ==Demography== Looking south on The Street in the late 19th century. The old post office still stands in the village. The record in the Domesday Book does not give the population in 1086, though several people are named. By the late 19th century the village and parish were described as: > WORMSHILL, a parish in Hollingbourn [sic] district, Kent; 5 miles S by W of > Sittingbourne r. station. It has a post-office under Sittingbourne. Acres, > 1,467. Real property, ¬£1,295. Pop., 253. Houses, 46. The property is divided > among a few. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Canterbury. Value, > ¬£260.* Patron, Christ's Hospital, London. The church is plain. Charities, > ¬£12. Wormshill's location remains rural. Because of geography and restrictions on development, building in the village has been scant since the 1960s and 1970s. In 1821, the parish contained only 26 dwellings: by 2001, the total number of houses had risen to 82. The rural nature of the area is indicated by a population density of approximately 0.4 persons per hectare (1 person for every 6.9 acres), compared to the average for the south-east of England of 4.2 persons per hectare (1 person for every 0.6 acres). The village has been recorded as a distinct parish unit for the purpose of census statistics since the first United Kingdom census in 1801.No census was taken in 1941 as a result of World War II. Statistics for 1981 and 1991 are unavailable because of the United Kingdom's Public Records Act restrictions. The majority of the official population of 198 (per United Kingdom Census 2001) is aged 45 or over and lives in homes comprising married family units. The total population has increased by around 40 people since 1801 however, during the past 200 years, it has fluctuated more widely within that range. In 1801 the population was 157 before peaking at 253 in 1861. In 1901 census records indicate a parish population of either 163 or 169. Data for the ethnicity of the wider Maidstone area show that the population is around 97 percent white and that the remainder is of mixed, black, and Asian descent. Specific figures for Wormshill held by Kent County Council indicated in 2001 that all the villagers were of white ethnicity. { border=\\"1\\"  align=\\"center\\" + Population of Wormshill !

A third farm, Home Farm appeared on late 19th and early 20th centuries Ordnance Survey maps in the centre of the village. This farm is no longer in use, but some outbuildings remain. Wormshill at one time included a blacksmith's shop, which is recorded on Ordnance Survey maps until 1898. According to the 1831 Census, 40 of the 48 adult males in the village were employed in the agricultural sector. Census records from the mid- to-late 19th century show a marked increase in the construction of new homes, representing the largest growth in the village for the next 100 years; however, the 1901 Census still described the majority of workers as \\"labourers and servants\\". Detail from Census 1901 indicating the principal employment of residents and identifying farms Graphic representation of industry employment sectors from data in Census 1831 The population spike between 1821 and 1901 is a trend typical to the general growth in the need for physical labour from parishes in the Kent downland agricultural region in the 19th century which was followed in the early 20th century by the increasing mechanisation of farming activity. Although the farms continue to employ from the village, as of 2008 Wormshill is largely a dormitory village, with residents employed in nearby towns or commuting to London. The socio-economic classification of Census 2001 indicated that the most common occupations were \\"lower managerial and professional occupations\\" (21.9 percent) and \\"small employers and own account workers\\" (15.2 percent). ==Landmarks== Blacksmith's Arms public house Red telephone box sited in the centre of the village Until the end of the 20th century, the village had a post office and general stores along with a public house, The Blacksmiths Arms, a Grade II listed building, in part of 17th century origin. The original post office opened in 1847 and was run by church warden Tom Clements from a building next to the rectory.Tom Clements' name also appears in the stained glass dedicated to St Giles in the church The building, which now forms part of a Grade II* listed private dwelling, is thought to be the second-oldest surviving post office building in England with a service dating from 1847. The post office briefly moved to another location in The Street under the stewardship of local schoolmistress Fanny Harris (who operated the service from 1926); however, it returned to the original site in 1946 under the new sub-postmistress Irene Bugden and was run as a small general stores until it closed in 1976. Fanny Harris (then 92 years old and the village's oldest inhabitant) and Robin Leigh-Pemberton were passengers on the first postbus service on 4 March 1974. A new post office and stores operated at a different property in the village for a further 20 years until it was closed in the 1990s. Today, the village retains only the Blacksmiths Arms and a traditional red post box. In the 19th century, an additional public house existed at the northern edge of the village near Norwood Farm and was known as The Woodman's Arms (and possibly also as The Norwood Arms). Detail from the 1901 Census indicating the Woodman's Arms, Wormshill and licensed victualler The pub was recorded on Ordnance Survey maps of the village between 1870 and 1946, but as of May 2012, the building is a Grade II listed private dwelling. Other listed buildings in the village include the timber-framed houses Norwood Manor and Blacksmiths Cottage. A large country house now known as Wormshill Court and bordered to the north and east by a brick wall includes the outbuildings of Manor Farm. The property is part of a large estate which has for several generations belonged to the Nightingale family. The house and farm is also shown on a map of 1636 and at that time appears to represent the only building in the village other than the church and the rectory. In 1858 a further map of the manor named the property Court Lodge Farm and included an inset plan showing the exchange of land between the governors of Christ's Hospital and a Mr. Henry Hudson. Wormshill retained its own telephone exchange until the 1990s, when it became part of the Maidstone exchange. A red telephone box remains in the village after residents insisted that it not be replaced with a modern design however the telephony was disconnected (and the box sealed) in November 2009 as a result of lack of use. An informal village noticeboard is on the side of an old flint and wood barn that was part of the former Home Farm. The post box and telephone box are at the same location. The telephone box is a listed building. The Bredgar and Wormshill Light Railway attracts tourists and railway enthusiasts throughout the summer season. The railway is a narrow gauge light railway run between two small stations on about of track built in woodland between Bredgar and Wormshill. ==Transport== The Post Bus at Wormshill Post Office A number of ancient trackways including the Pilgrims' Way and the North Downs Way (now designated as footpaths or byways) pass within a few miles of the village. Wormshill is not on any major roadways and has no rail service. No standard public transport facilities or taxicab operations exist in the village. A daily Postbus service, incorporated into the village postal delivery and collection timetable and which ran for 35 years, stopped on 14 November 2009. It was one of the last remaining postbus services in the United Kingdom. The service, run by the Royal Mail and subsidised by the county council, began in March 1974 and collected residents from Wormshill and other villages en route to Sittingbourne. The closure of the only means of public transport to and from the village was controversial and, following a campaign by local councillors and journalists, the postbus was replaced by a temporary minibus service, funded by the county council. Royal Mail postal deliveries continue to be made to the village. The village lies between the M2 and M20 motorways, and the nearest railway station is at Harrietsham on the Maidstone Line, to the south by road. ==Education== A small one-roomed National school (a school established by the National Society for Promoting Religious Education) was built in the village in 1872 for about 30 children. However some evidence exists that it had \\"accommodation for forty- two children and an average attendance of twenty-eight\\". The school was recorded on maps of the village until 1909, although it was dissolved in 1930 (school mistresses Miss Fanny Harris and Miss Pepper later ran the post office and general store from an outhouse at Flint Cottage). The building that housed the school has since been converted to a private dwelling. The school's small playground was lined by lime trees planted in memory of a general at the end of the Boer Wars. As of November 2011 the lime trees are still there. The nearest primary school to the village is the Milstead and Frinsted Church of England School at Milstead. Secondary school pupils are educated in the towns of Sittingbourne or Maidstone. ==Religion== Norman era baptismal font, St Giles' Church The church, parts of which date back to the Norman era, is dedicated to Saint Giles and forms part of the united benefice of Tunstall and Bredgar, along with the villages of Rodmersham, Milstead, Bicknor and Frinsted. The ecclesiastical parish of Wormshill is in the Diocese of Canterbury and the Sittingbourne deanery (within the archdeaconry of Maidstone). As of March 2018, the rector was the Reverend Alan Pinnegar. In 1995, the church received a new ring of six bells after a campaign by villagers begun in 1944 by Michael Nightingale of Cromarty, who at age 16 opened a savings account with 10 shillings for the restoration of the church's bells. Fifty years later, he completed the full ring of six bells: one of the six was original, and the other five were rescued from abandoned churches. The last major renovations of the church occurred in 1789 and 1901.However, structurally the church has not changed in at least 200 years. See Of note within the church are a Norman font and Tudor pulpit. The church also contains a 13th century chest, first discovered in the early 20th century. The former rectory is now a private dwelling. ==Community and cultureNotable people=== A vicar at the Rectory of Wormshill in the 19th century, Reverend Josiah Disturnell, was the subject of a debate about exceptional human longevity; it was claimed that he lived to age 107. References to the rector's memorial stone in the church ultimately provided evidence that his actual age of death was \\"either 91 or 93\\". Sir Henry Rew, a leading authority on agricultural economics, a former assistant secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and president of the Royal Statistical Society (1920‚Äì1922) died at his home in the village on 7 April 1929. ===Filmography=== In January 2007, the church and its surroundings were used as locations in the filming of an episode of EastEnders, broadcast in the United Kingdom over the Easter 2007 holiday season. The production crew added mock gravestones and a temporary Victorian-style street lamp to the churchyard. Also featured were other locations in and near the village, including exterior shots of the Blacksmiths Arms combined with interior views of the nearby Ringlestone Inn. ===Recreation=== The village holds typical English rural festivals during the year. The spring and harvest festivals are horticultural shows that include the surrounding villages. The country fair (or f√™te) in the summer previously included traditional country games, stalls and attractions such as hay bale throwing, tug of war and a coconut shy, although the village has not held a f√™te since 2009. Wormshill contains a community village hall and recreation ground, including a small playground. The 9th Sittingbourne (Tunstall and Wormshill) Scout Group are associated with the village and group meetings are occasionally held at the village hall. Wormshill, together with the united benefice villages of Bredgar, Milstead, Bicknor and Frinsted, also produces a free monthly Parish Magazine including village news, announcements and occasional articles. In common with a number of rural communities in the county, Wormshill also receives a weekly mobile library service run by Kent County Council. ==References *Images of Wormshill at Geograph *History and demography of Wormshill at VisionOfBritain.org *Demographic Statistics (2001 Census) *Bredgar & Wormshill Light Railway *Wormshill Parish website Category:Civil parishes in Kent Category:Villages in Kent ","title":"Wormshill"},{"id":"2228722","text":"Jos√© Santiago Bueso Soto, President of Honduras Jos√© Santiago Bueso (1815‚Äì1857) was President of Honduras from 18 October to 8 November 1855.

He was born in the northern Honduran department of Santa B√°rbara on 3 June 1849 to Saturnino Bogr√°n Bonilla and Gertrudis Barahona Leiva. He was a member of a prominent and wealthy political family. The last name \\"Bogr√°n\\" derives from the French surname \\"Beaugrand\\". Luis Bogr√°n was half-brother and first cousin of future president Francisco Bogr√°n (5 October 1919 - 1 February 1920) and first cousin of future president Miguel Paz Barahona (1 February 1925 - 1 February 1929). ==Background== After successfully completing his secondary school studies in his home town, a young Luis Bogr√°n pursued a law degree at the University of San Carlos in Guatemala, and later pursued a career in the military. Bogr√°n reached the rank of General within a few years, after successful military campaigns against Salvadoran military adversaries attempting to infiltrate national territory. He married Teresa Morejon Ferrera in 1878. Soon after, he became involved in politics, and later became ex-president Marco Aurelio Soto's prot√©g√©. His two consecutive terms as president were considered to be very prosperous for the nation. He is known for greatly expanding the educational system by establishing a number of learning institutions around the country, attracting considerable foreign investment (especially into the agricultural sector), improving the infrastructure of the capital city, and encouraging research and investigation of the ancient Mayan city of Cop√°n. As a strong supporter of Francisco Moraz√°n's ideal, President Bogr√°n was a unionist and attempted to bring about, with the help of then Guatemalan President Justo Rufino Barrios, the unification of the five Central American states. Ultimately, the unionist agenda was defeated as the ultra-conservative power elites in these states successfully thwarted unification attempts. Luis Bogr√°n died in Guatemala city, Guatemala on 9 July 1895. == Luis Bogr√°n as President of the Republic of Honduras == Luis Bogr√°n is renowned in Honduras for greatly expanding the educational system throughout the major cities and towns of Honduras. He founded the Escuela de Artes y Oficios (National School of Arts), the Academia Cient√≠fico-Literario (Literary-Scientific Academy), and the Tipografia Nacional (National Typography/Press). He also attracted substantial foreign investment, especially into the agricultural arena, which resulted in job creation and economic development of the northern coast. He improved the infrastructure of the capital city, Tegucigalpa. President Luis Bogr√°n also initiated the process of research and investigation in the ruins of the ancient Mayan city of Copan by inviting foreign universities to study the artifacts and architecture left behind by the Mayans. He was also one of the founding members of the Partido Nacional de Honduras, PNH (National Party of Honduras). ==External links== * brief biography on HRN (Honduran National Radio) website.

It consists of a six or seven letter \\"stem\\" (often, but not always, an acceptable word itself), paired with a phrase in which each letter can be added to the stem and rearranged (anagrammed) to form a new word. Typical stems are sets of six or seven letters, as such anamonics aid in learning and in finding valuable seven- and eight-letter bingo (UK: \\"bonus\\") plays. Just as importantly, a player can quickly verify that he or she should not waste valuable time looking for a word in a set of letters that is ruled out by an anamonic. A successful anamonic will typically have some memorable semantic relationship to the stem. It will usually avoid unnecessary or easily confused words, which might lead to a misconception of just which letters combine with the stem. When no vowel combines with the stem, an anamonic phrase will typically make use of multiple vowels that are meant to be ignored. A skilled Scrabble player will typically be able to verify that at least one of these vowels does not form an acceptable word with the stem, thereby avoiding confusion. Authorship of particularly noteworthy anamonics is often acknowledged, although this is not necessarily expected by the Scrabble community. ==Example anamonic (North American word list)== TSUNAMI: COASTAL HARM *TSUNAMI+C = TSUNAMIC *TSUNAMI+O = MANITOUS TINAMOUS *TSUNAMI+A = AMIANTUS *TSUNAMI+S = TSUNAMIS *TSUNAMI+T = ANTISMUT *TSUNAMI+L = SIMULANT *TSUNAMI+H = HUMANIST *TSUNAMI+R = NATRIUMS NATURISM *TSUNAMI+M = MANUMITS ==Origin of the term== The term \\"anamonics\\" was coined in a private letter to Nick Ballard in 1993. The coiner was Bob Lipton, who was probably the first or second player in history to make extensive use of anamonics before they even had a name. Lipton's first anamonics were constructed in the summer of 1987. It was Ballard who first popularized the technique in a series of articles published in the now-defunct newsletter \\"Medleys.\\" ==External links== *Canonical List of Anamonics (maintained by John Chew) Category:Scrabble Category:Mnemonics Category:Word games Category:Word play ","title":"Anamonic"},{"id":"2228754","text":"Domingo V√°squez Domingo V√°squez (1846‚Äì1909) was President of Honduras 7 August 1893 ‚Äì 22 February 1894.

This saves the trouble and expenses of constructing a second, new set, though they face the difficulty of doing it so the average viewer does not notice the same set is reused. Also there could be logistical problems, such as conflicting shooting schedules, continuity if the set is not quite the same as it was (if it should be the same) or different (if it should be). The latter problem arises because the set dresser may be unaware of changes created by the action. == Examples == A good example of a successful redress occurred in the film Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan where the bridges of the Enterprise and the Reliant were filmed on the same set. Some of the reasons for its success are as follows: * All the scenes on the Reliant bridge were shot after the scenes on the Enterprise bridge, eliminating difficulty with continuity and conflicting shooting schedules. Only one actor, Walter Koenig, had to be present on both the Reliant and the Enterprise. * The film was edited so that the scenes on Reliant and Enterprise are intercut with each other, strengthening the illusion that both exist simultaneously. * It is readily apparent to the audience which ship they are on due to the presence of different characters, a different musical motif, different lighting and different seat covers. * The Enterprise set was built so that portions of it could be moved around for filming. Therefore, the set of each bridge could be made to look slightly different, making it less readily obvious that the set was the same. * Both Enterprise and Reliant are Federation starships, so their bridge designs would likely be similar. However, such perfect circumstances are rare and any Trekkie will be quick to point out that the schematics seen on Reliant are clearly those of the Enterprise. During Hollywood's studio era, the disparate studios often maintained standing sets (interior and exterior) which were intended for long- term use over multiple productions, with only minimal re-dressing. This often led to audience members recognising sets which had appeared in previous films. A double feature of two Twentieth Century-Fox films of the mid-1950s, O. Henry's Full House and We're Not Married, caused unintended laughter when two different street scenes from the respective films‚Äîa street in Manhattan circa 1900, and a street in New Orleans in the present‚Äîwere very obviously the same exterior set. ==See also== * Backlot, the permanent exterior sets reused by major Hollywood studios during the 20th century == References == Category:Cinematic techniques Category:Film production ","title":"Redress"},{"id":"2228762","text":"Gladstone's Library Gladstone's statue in the library. Gladstone's Library staff at the School of Advanced Study History Day 2017. Gladstone's Library, known until 2010 as St Deiniol's Library (), is a residential library in Hawarden, Flintshire, Wales. It is a Grade I listed building. Gladstone's Library is Britain's only Prime Ministerial Library and the national memorial to the Victorian statesman, and four times Prime Minister, William Ewart Gladstone (1809‚Äì98). It is home to a collection of more than 250,000 printed items, including theological, historical, cultural and political materials. ==Foundation== The library was founded by William Gladstone in 1894. He was eager to share his personal library with others, especially those who faced financial constraint. He would allow bright children and young adults of the village of Hawarden to use his collection. His desire, his daughter Mary Gladstone said, was to \\"bring together books who had no readers with readers who had no books\\". In 1895, at the age of 85, William Gladstone gave ¬£40,000 and much of his own library. Armed with only his valet and one of his daughters, William Gladstone wheeled 32,000 books three quarters of a mile between his home at Hawarden Castle and the library. He unpacked them and put them onto shelves using his own catalogue system. In a diary entry (dated 23 December 1895) he concisely described the library's founding thus: \\"I have this day constituted my trust at St Deiniol's. The cost of the work has been I think ¬£41 to ¬£42000, including some charges of maintenance to Dec. 31. 95. May God of His mercy prosper it.\\" H.C.G. Matthew [ed.], 'The Gladstone Diaries, Volume XIII: 1892-1896' (1994) Oxford: Clarendon Press, p 432. Following his death in 1898, a public appeal was launched for funds to provide a permanent building to house the collection and to replace the temporary structure. The ¬£9,000 raised provided an imposing building, designed by John Douglas, which was officially opened by Earl Spencer on 14 October 1902 as the National Memorial to W.E. Gladstone. The Gladstone family were themselves to fulfill the founder's vision by funding the residential wing, which welcomed its first resident on 29 June 1906. ==Today== Today the library has 26 bedrooms, a restaurant called Food For Thought, a chapel and conference facilities. It hosts a year long programme of events based around William Gladstone's core interest areas of religion and theology, history and politics, and 19th- century literary culture. The library's reading rooms are open to visitors on short guided tours only at 12pm, 2pm and 4pm each weekday. ==Future== In March 2018, Gladstone's Library and the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) announced a ¬£4.5 million Living Heritage Project to build a new building and refurbish the existing grade I listed historical library. In June 2018 four architectural companies were shortlisted‚ÄîAOC Architecture, Caruso St John Architects, Hopkins Architects, and Simpson & Brown‚Äîeach receiving ¬£4,000 to develop a proposal. In July 2018 the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) announced that Caruso St John had won the competition to design the new building for Gladstone's Library. == See also == *Dr Williams's Library in London *List of non-ecclesiastical and non-residential works by John Douglas ==References *Official website *U.S. Friends of Gladstone's Library Category:Library buildings completed in 1902 Category:Houses completed in 1906 Category:Libraries in Wales Category:John Douglas buildings Category:Tourist attractions in Flintshire Category:Grade I listed buildings in Flintshire Category:William Ewart Gladstone Category:Authors' libraries Category:1906 establishments in Wales ","title":"Gladstone's Library"},{"id":"2228766","text":"XBAND (stylized as XB‚±ØND) was the first competitive online console gaming network, and was available for Super NES and Genesis systems. It was produced by Catapult Entertainment, a Cupertino, California-based software company. It is the only modem released in America to have been officially licensed by Nintendo. It debuted in various areas of the United States in late 1994 and 1995. Online console gaming networks were eventually stabilized in the sixth and later generations of video games, such as Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, and Nintendo Switch Online. ==History== The Genesis version of the XBAND was released in November 1994, with the Super NES version following in June 1995. The Genesis version also works with the Genesis Nomad. In 1995, Catapult Entertainment signed a deal with General Instrument, producers of the Sega Channel, which stipulated that the XBand modem would henceforth be built into new Sega Channel adapters, and that the top 5 to 10 games offered by Sega Channel each month would be wired for play over XBand. Initially, Catapult Entertainment had a limited staff and virtually no advertising. By January 1997, XBAND network playability had reached practically every metropolitan area and several rural areas in the U.S. The actual XBAND modems were carried by a handful of software and video rental chains across the United States. Internationally, the XBAND saw some limited expansion in the Japanese market, and Catapult was working on PC- and Sega Saturn-based versions of the platform, though they merged with Mpath Interactive, and the focus shifted to the online PC gaming service, Mplayer.com. ==Service== XBAND for the Sega Genesis and the Super NES The concept of playing online was fairly new at the time. Arcades were still quite popular, and online gaming was not yet a household idea. The XBAND modem was widely available at Blockbuster Video branches during its time. It retailed for $19.99, with additional charges based on usage. Two pricing plans were available. One had a monthly fee of $4.95 and allowed the user to connect to the service up to 50 times a month with each additional connection costing 15 cents. The other had a monthly fee of $9.95 and granted the subscriber an unlimited number of connections per month. Activities that consumed a player's monthly allowance of connections included dialing into the XBAND service for matchmaking, downloading mail (called \\"XMAIL\\"), and downloading the daily edition of the two XBAND newsletters, one containing generic news and the other containing platform- specific information such as leaderboards and contest announcements. Players were also assessed a fee of $3.95/hour for connecting to opponents outside their local calling area; player-to-player connections inside their local calling area were free. The modem features built-in storage for up to four users (\\"codenames\\"). It stores user friend lists, which can contain the codenames of up to ten of the user's friends; the users' XMAIL boxes, storing up to ten incoming and ten outgoing messages for each user; the users' rankings, win/loss records, and accumulated scores; a short profile section; and the user's avatar (chosen from 40 preset avatars). Text entry is done either through an on-screen keyboard or an optional XBAND keyboard add-on released later in the network's lifespan. The client-side system worked by manipulating the game's memory in a way similar to Game Genie and third-party computer game modifications such as Multi Theft Auto. A problem of most online services of the time was that the connection would be lost whenever a phone on the same line was picked up. The XBand operating system was designed to ensure that connections are not lost due to phone activity; in the case of call waiting, the system would alert the user to the call and allow the game to be resumed. XBAND had an official website where a member could check any other player's statistics, along with other information and updates that were not available to view on consoles. At its height, XBAND had 15,000 subscribed members. ==Gaming== A 1995 article in Next Generation stated that the XBAND modem's \\"ultra-low latency is the key to its successful handling of realtime videogaming\\". The modem's data transfer rate was 2,400 bits per second, which, while low compared to PC modems of the time, was sufficient to handle the simple one-on-one games which XBAND was used with. When connecting to play, unless a player specified a particular user from their friend list, players would be matched with a random player elsewhere in the country (or the player's local area code depending on their preference settings) who was also connecting to play the same game. The server would attempt to match players of like skill levels, using the Elo rating system. When the network matched two players up, the newly-connected player's XBAND modem would disconnect from the server and dial the other player, whose own XBAND modem would answer when the phone rang. At that point the players would see the XBAND logo slide together, followed by the matchup screen, which displayed each player's codenames, avatars, locations, and a pre-typed \\"taunt\\". In December 1995 XBAND launched its first national tournament. This is the first modem to modem tournament ever to be held over a console. The grand prize winner received a special Genghis Khan icon for their XBAND profile and a $200 cash prize from Catapult. Peter Kappes aka \\"SphiNX\\" of Orlando, FL became the first person in history to win a modem to modem national tournament over a console. ==Icon hacking== During the last few months of service, several users discovered a way to use a Game Genie to hack the icons of XBAND players. This enabled players to use icons that were otherwise restricted, such as unreleased icons or icons reserved for matches between XBAND team members. Icon hacking resulted in complaints from other users. Rumors about XBAND icon hackers often claimed they were part of elite hacking organizations or members of Catapult Entertainment. Eventually, the method used by the hackers was leaked and inevitably spread throughout the community. ==Demise== By March 16, 1997, people could only play within their local area code. On April 30, 1997, the entire network was removed, with Mpath citing a lack of new games for the Genesis and Super NES. XBAND had announced in their previous monthly newsletter that they were shutting down. According to Next Generation, XBAND \\"never turned a significant profit\\". During XBAND's existence, only a handful of advertisements were ever made, and only one game, Weaponlord, had the XBAND logo on its box. XBAND stated in their newsletter that players were their best form of advertising, and offered the \\"XBAND 6 pack\\", where members could order six modems at a discounted rate and receive a month of free gaming in exchange for signing up a certain number of people to the service. Heavy contributors to XBAND's demise were the lack of support from game developers and limited internal resources. With the exception of Weaponlord, Catapult had to individually reverse engineer each game's code, then develop a hack to intercept two-player activity so the game could be shared over a low-latency (fast response time), 2400-baud modem connection. Catapult's second generation attempts were blocked by the hardware manufacturers. The XBAND was launched in Japan on April 1, 1996 for the Sega Saturn. Unlike the SNES and Genesis versions of XBAND, it did not require an XBAND-specific modem, instead utilizing Sega's own Sega NetLink device (which included a 14,400 baud modem in Japan and a 28,800 baud modem in North America). Despite this, neither the Saturn XBAND nor an expansion into the PC market panned out, as developers frequently opted to include their own network linking rather than deal with Catapult's subscription-based service. In 2019, fans were able to patch select Sega Saturn XBAND titles to be playable online over VOIP again, with more coming down the road.https://www.dreamcast- talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t;=8453 ==Service issues== A major issue for the XBAND service was free long-distance phone calls. It was discovered that a user could record the tones sent from an XBAND modem and then receive the long-distance service number, the authentication code, and phone number of the player you were connecting to. This information allowed anyone to access long- distance phone calls that were charged to Catapult. Paging company SkyTel faced similar problems from both XBAND users and their own customers. XBAND users performed brute-force attacks against SkyTel's mobile paging system in order to discover voicemail boxes using the same number as the login and password, using these to extend their communication with each other. Most messages consisted simply of shout-outs with music playing in the background. A common complaint was that if a player was losing a match, they could simply pull their phone cord out or reset their system. This tactic, known as \\"cord- pulling\\" among XBAND users, prevented the XBAND service from crediting either player with the win or loss. In response to complaints, the company developed a program which would detect such forced disconnections and assign a loss to the perpetrator and a win to the victim. However, this led to a flood of calls from users claiming that their reset button had been pushed by accident and demanding that the loss be erased from their record; facing unsustainable customer service costs, Catapult changed the program so that while victims of cord-pulling were awarded a win, perpetrators were no longer penalized in any way. ==Publishing statistics== Despite poor marketing success, the XBAND team did manage some publicity gains when they joined forces with a number of gaming magazines, starting on the web with Game Zero magazine and later in Tips & Tricks Magazine. Daily stats were accessible via 'XBAND News' on the modem, although they were not visible to the general public. Publishing stats added a \\"cool\\" factor to brag about in the early forefronts of online gaming. The top-ranked gamers of the previous month were published starting in January 1996 in Game Zero and, starting in early 1996, in Tips & Tricks magazine as well. ==Supported games== The following games have been analyzed, and online compatibility provided, by XBAND.https://web.archive.org/web/19970209060007/http://www.xband.com/XBAND/products/games/ Additionally, a hidden maze game could be unlocked in the SNES version by inserting a The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past cartridge. ==See also== *GameLine, a third party dialup service for the Atari 2600 *Famicom Modem *Intellivision's PlayCable *Teleplay Modem, a third party modem made for the NES, Super NES, and Genesis *Sega Genesis's Sega Channel *Sega Meganet - Sega's own online gaming service for the Mega Drive *Satellaview - A satellite modem for the Super Famicom with non-interactive online gaming *Sega NetLink - Sega's Online service for the Sega Saturn *64DD Nintendo's 64DD and Randnet online service of 1999-2001 in Japan *SharkWire Online, a third party dialup service for the Nintendo 64 ==References * XBAND - Official Website (ARCHIVED) * Xband (fan) facebook page * Some archived pages of Catapult's \\"XBAND XClusive\\" on GameZero.com * A write-up of the service from Sega-16 * Gamer's Graveyard Article * Popular \\"Blog of the Day\\" entry on 1up.com about one gamer's look back on his XBand obsession Category:Computer- related introductions in 1994 Category:Multiplayer video game services Category:Nintendo hardware Category:Sega hardware Category:Sega Genesis Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System ","title":"XBAND"},{"id":"2228767","text":"Salvador Aguirre (1862‚Äì1947) Salvador Aguirre (1862‚Äì1947) was acting President of Honduras for one week, from 9 through 16 September 1919.

Aeminium was the ancient name of the city of Coimbra, in Portugal. The Romans founded the civitas of Aeminium in this place at the time of Augustus, which came under the protection of nearby Conimbriga situated some to the south. The Roman city was encircled by a wall, and followed an orthogonal plan, with the cardo maximus and decumanus maximus crossing at the Forum. An aqueduct existed, the remains of which were incorporated into a latter medieval renovation. Locations for the theater and amphitheater were also proposed, but still unconfirmed by archeology. A triumphal arch is documented, but was destroyed in 1778. Also a necropolis was located to the east of the city. Aeminium at Museu Nacional de Machado de Castro The Suebi razed the nearby township of Con√≠mbriga in 468. Its inhabitants, who had meanwhile fled to Aeminium, kept the original name of their town. In modern Coimbra there are few remains from ancient Aeminium. The most important is the cryptoporticus, an underground gallery of arched corridors built in the 1st or 2nd century AD to support the forum of the city. Gaius Sevius Lupus was probably the architect. During the Middle Ages the bishop's palace, now turned into the Machado de Castro Museum, was built over the forum; the cryptoporticus is located under it. The cryptoporticus can be visited through the museum. ==See also== *History of Portugal *Lusitania *Roman cities in Portugal ==References== Category:History of Coimbra Category:Roman towns and cities in Portugal ","title":"Aeminium"},{"id":"2228777","text":"Vicente Tosta Carrasco (27 October 1886 ‚Äì 7 August 1930) was provisional President of Honduras for ten months, from 30 April 1924 through 1 February 1925.

Original members included Cub Koda (guitarist/vocalist), Mike Lutz (guitarist/vocalist), T.J. Cronley (drummer), and Tony Driggins (bassist/vocals). Later members included Henry \\"H-Bomb\\" Weck (drummer) and Bruce Nazarian (guitarist/vocalist). They are remembered for the top-10 hit single \\"Smokin' in the Boys Room\\" (1973). ==HistoryEarly history=== Brownsville Station was formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1969. Brownsville Station's early albums included song covers from bands which had inspired them.Erlewine, Stephen. [ \\"Brownsville Station\\"], Allmusic.com. Retrieved 19 August 2009. In 1970, they released their debut studio album, No BS, on a Warners Bros. label. Their biggest hit, \\"Smokin' in the Boys Room\\", written by Michael Lutz & Cub Koda, from their 1973 album Yeah!, reached No. 3 on U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 27 in the UK Singles Chart. The track sold over two million copies and was awarded a gold disc status by the RIAA on 15 January 1974. ===Later history=== In 1977, Brownsville Station recorded \\"Martian Boogie\\", one of their seven singles to chart on the Hot 100. The song was also a feature on Dr. Demento's radio show. \\"(Lady) Put The Light On\\", their penultimate single, also charted in the Hot 100, at 46. After drummer Cronley left the band, Van Wert, Ohio native Henry \\"H-Bomb\\" Weck was called on to fill the position left by Cronley. The band's second-highest Billboard charting single was \\"Kings of the Party\\" which topped out at No. 31 in 1974. Original members of Brownsville Station disbanded in 1979 and their final studio album together, Air Special, was released by Epic in 1978. Cub Koda was the most visible Brownsville Station member after their break up. He recorded a number of solo albums and toured with his own group The Points as well as blues man Hound Dog Taylor's backing band The Houserockers. His solo repertoire included the albums Cub Koda and the Points, It's the Blues, Box Lunch and the career spanning compilation Welcome to My Job. In addition, Koda, a rabid collector of rockabilly, doo wop and blues, wrote liner notes for numerous retro releases (including Jimmy Reed, Freddy Cannon and The Kingsmen) and countless music reviews for the All Music Guide series of books and website. He also wrote a popular column (\\"The Vinyl Junkie\\") for Goldmine magazine and co-authored the book Blues For Dummies. In addition, he hosted The Cub Koda Crazy Show for Massachusetts radio station WCGY during a period in the early 80s. Koda died of kidney disease in July 2000 at the age of 51. Mike Lutz went on to produce many bands, including Ted Nugent's Spirit of the Wild album, and toured in the 1990s with Nugent. Lutz still resides in Ann Arbor, teaches guitar and bass at a local music store called Oz's Music, writes and produces many acts. While still in Brownsville Station, Henry Weck engineered and co-produced the Strikes album for Blackfoot, which produced two hit singles, Highway Song and Train Train (on which Koda played harmonica). Weck continues to record and produce in Memphis, in Ann Arbor at Lutz's Tazmania Studios and is the co-driving force of the re-united Brownsville Station. After T. J. Cronley left Brownsville Station, he spent a career in the U.S. Marine Corps as a Marine aviator, and retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1992. He is currently a pilot for FedEx and resides in Yuma, Arizona. He is also an artist. Bruce Nazarian went on to produce, engineer and perform with his band \\"The Automatix\\", who released their debut LP on MCA in 1983. He was the CEO of Digital Media Consulting Group and ran a popular digital media website \\"TheDigitalGuy.com\\". Nazarian also produced and hosted The Digital Guy radio show in addition to being a music producer, concert impresario and artist manager. His last band, \\"The Brotherhood\\" is slated to release their debut CD \\"(It's) All About The Groove\\" in early 2016. Nazarian died in October 2015. In 2008, Brownsville Station was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. Through the band's early days, Weck captured over 500 hours of Brownsville demos, rehearsals, live shows and even some special events. In 2012, Lutz and Weck began sorting through the recordings in Lutz's Tazmania Studio. The result is Still Smokin', featuring new songs and updated versions of the band's \\"My Friend Jack\\" and ‚ÄúSmokin‚Äô In The Boys Room‚Äù. Augmented by new players Billy Craig, Arlen Viecelli and Brad Johnson, Brownsville Station returned to the road in 2013. == In popular culture == In the television series King of the Hill, Brownsville Station is part of the subplot in Episode 10 Season 10 entitled Hank Fixes Everything, reuniting for the \\"Still Smokin' In The Boys Room\\" tour (incidentally, when the band reunited for real in 2012, their subsequent album would be titled Still Smokin'). The band is a favorite of the character Lucky, who camps outside the ticket booth to purchase seats for prime viewing of Mike Lutz playing guitar. ==Influences== Brownsville Station's early influences included Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and other 1950s rock and roll musicians. Koda's onstage antics influenced many rockers including Peter Wolf and Alice Cooper. ==Band members== * Mike Lutz (1969‚Äì1979, 2012‚Äìpresent) - guitar, lead vocals, bass, keyboards * Henry \\"H Bomb\\" Weck (1972‚Äì1979, 2012‚Äìpresent) - drums, vocals * Billy Craig (2012‚Äìpresent) - guitar, vocals * Arlen Viecelli (2013‚Äìpresent) - guitar, vocals * Brad Johnson (2013‚Äìpresent) - bass, vocals ===Former members=== * Cub Koda (1969‚Äì1979; died 2000) - guitar, lead vocals, harmonica * T.J.

It is also known as FC Saturn Moscow Region (FC Saturn Moskovskaya Oblast). ==History== The club was founded in 1946. Although the club is based in Ramenskoye, the club represents all Moscow Oblast. Due to huge debts it was dissolved in January 2011, but was recreated on the base of their former farm club FC Saturn-2 Moscow Region. It returned to the professional level in Russian Professional Football League in the 2013-14 season. Before the 2015‚Äì16 season, the club didn't receive the professional license and moved back to amateur levels. It returned to the third-tier once again for the 2016‚Äì17 season. Their nickname ‚ÄúAliens‚Äù (Russian –∏–Ω–æ–ø–ª–∞–Ω–µ—Ç—è–Ω–µ) comes from the name 'Saturn'. Also, nicknamed \\"Extraterrestrials.\\" It was previously called Krylya Sovetov (1946‚Äì1957), Trud (1958‚Äì1959) and Saturn-REN TV (February 2002 to January 2004). In 2006 the club beat the record of drawn matches played in the Russian Premier League during one season - 16 times. ===League and Cup history=== ImageSize = width:600 height:60 PlotArea = left:10 right:10 bottom:30 top:10 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1991 till:01/07/2010 ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:1992 Colors = id:bl1 value:rgb(0.5,0.8,0.5) id:bl2 value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.3) id:rs value:rgb(0.8,0.6,0.6) id:rn value:rgb(0.9,0.1,0.1) PlotData= bar:Position width:15 color:white align:center from:01/07/1991 till:01/07/1992 shift:(0,-4) text:14 from:01/07/1992 till:01/07/1993 shift:(0,-4) text:14 from:01/07/1993 till:01/07/1994 shift:(0,-4) text:2 from:01/07/1994 till:01/07/1995 shift:(0,-4) text:2 from:01/07/1995 till:01/07/1996 shift:(0,-4) text:11 from:01/07/1996 till:01/07/1997 shift:(0,-4) text:9 from:01/07/1997 till:01/07/1998 shift:(0,-4) text:1 from:01/07/1998 till:01/07/1999 shift:(0,-4) text:10 from:01/07/1999 till:01/07/2000 shift:(0,-4) text:9 from:01/07/2000 till:01/07/2001 shift:(0,-4) text:6 from:01/07/2001 till:01/07/2002 shift:(0,-4) text:6 from:01/07/2002 till:01/07/2003 shift:(0,-4) text:7 from:01/07/2003 till:01/07/2004 shift:(0,-4) text:7 from:01/07/2004 till:01/07/2005 shift:(0,-4) text:11 from:01/07/2005 till:01/07/2006 shift:(0,-4) text:11 from:01/07/2006 till:01/07/2007 shift:(0,-4) text:5 from:01/07/2007 till:01/07/2008 shift:(0,-4) text:11 from:01/07/2008 till:01/07/2009 shift:(0,-4) text:7 from:01/07/2009 till:01/07/2010 shift:(0,-4) text:10 from:01/01/1991 till:01/07/1993 color:rs shift:(0,13) text: \\"D2\\" from:01/07/1993 till:01/07/1994 color:rn shift:(0,13) text: \\"D3\\" from:01/07/1994 till:01/07/1995 color:rs shift:(0,13) text: \\"D2\\" from:01/07/1995 till:01/07/1998 color:bl2 shift:(0,13) text: \\"D1\\" from:01/07/1998 till:01/07/2010 color:bl1 shift:(0,13) text: \\"Russian Premier League\\" Saturn's reserve squad played professionally as FC Saturn-2 Ramenskoye in the Russian Second Division in 1999 and 2000. A separate farm club called FC Saturn-2 Moscow Oblast played in the Russian Second Division from 2009 to 2012. ==Current squad== As of 21 August 2020, according to the PFL website. ==Supporters== The football club Saturn Ramenskoye (FCSR) supporters movement was born in the second part of the 1980s when the team started playing on the professional level. The organised group of fans at that time consisted of not more than 20 people; however the first trips (Russian: –≤—ã–µ–∑–¥–∞) to Tula, Kaluga, Pskov and other cities were already done by them in 1986. The new age for FCSR supportive movement is connected with the year 1995. Then the famous supporter Andrey Egorishev (nicknamed \\"Arsenal\\") had begun to unite fans of Saturn. It is believed that the team played in black and blue colors because of him. In 1996 Saturn had played in red and white colors. Fans who disliked these colors (because of ideological views) had many discussions ‚Äì and finally chose black and blue colors. Some time after that the team changed colors too. The first union of FCSR fans ‚Äì Dorf Menschen (the bumpkins; the German translates literally as \\"Village People\\") ‚Äì was organised in January 1996. At that moment it consisted from about 15 people, but its size (as the size of FCSR fans in common) has been increasing. Many groups of fans were formed (mainly according to geographical location). Because a large number of these groups became uncontrollable, it was decided to unite them around a Dorf Menschen. The South-East Confederation (Russian: ¬´–Æ–≥–æ-–í–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–∞—è –ö–æ–Ω—Ñ–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è¬ª) was formed in this way. It was able to gather about one thousand supporters at the home game. At the moment the main FCSR band is \\"BBS firm\\" whose name means \\"Black Blue Supporters\\". After beginning to play in the highest Russian league, the structure of the FCSR supportive movement has been changed a lot. There are some different unions at the moment, both hooligans and ultras, which are united by the 46 km. The main enemies of Saturn fans are fans of FC Lokomotiv Moscow, FC Shinnik Yaroslavl and FC Khimki. There is the friendship between FCSR fans and fans of Torpedo Moscow and Spartak Moscow. Many FCSR fans' nicknames are connected with the aliens' club name. The black and blue fans themselves mostly use the nickname gumy (\\"–≥—É–º—ã\\") (short form of Russian \\"–≥—É–º–∞–Ω–æ–∏–¥\\" ‚Äì \\"humanoid\\"). ==Notable players== Had international caps for their respective countries.

As it is a regional newspaper, the Quad-City Times is also circulated and has readership in Cedar, Clinton, Jackson, Louisa and Muscatine counties in Iowa; and Carroll, Henry, Mercer and Whiteside counties in Illinois. According to the Iowa Newspaper Association, the Quad-City Times has a circulation of 61,366. The newspaper is owned by Lee Enterprises, which is also located in Davenport. ==History== The Quad-City Times grew from several predecessors, including the Democratic Banner and Blue Ribbon News. The Democratic Banner was founded in 1848, was sold in 1855 to a group of businessmen and rechristened the Iowa State Democrat. The Iowa State Democrat published its first edition on October 15 of that year, with E. T. Eagel its first publisher. The newspaper underwent many changes through its early history, and by 1899, its circulation was 1,300 daily and 2,500 weekly. By 1903, it was known as the Davenport Democrat, and in 1905, after purchasing its rival newspaper, The Davenport Leader, the name became The Davenport Democrat & Leader, under the city editorship of Ralph W. Cram. The newspaper was sold to Lee Enterprises in 1915; thereafter Cram become editor and publisher, until 1940. The Blue Ribbon News began publication in 1878; by 1886, it was known as the Davenport Daily Times. The newspaper, which struggled for many years, was sold in 1899 to A. W. Lee (founder of Lee Enterprises) for $120,000. Both newspapers continued to grow in circulation, before combining operations in 1964. The formerly separate newspapers became known as the Times-Democrat. By 1974, with circulation expanding throughout eastern Iowa and western Illinois, the newspaper was given its current name. In December 1989, the Quad-City Times moved into its current building at 500 E. Third St., Davenport. The facility, completed at a cost of $23.8 million, includes a five-story press room, mail room, warehouse and editorial offices. The facility also houses Trico, the newspaper's commercial printing business. The Quad-City Times has been on the leading edge of technology, becoming the first all-electronic newspaper in 1973. Electronic pagination began in 1988, with all-digital photography taking root by 1994. Current Quad-City Times columnists include Roy Booker, Linda Cook, Matt Coss, Jennifer DeWitt, Don Doxsie, Alma Gaul, and Barb Ickes. The current editor is Matt Christensen. Deb Anselm is the publisher of the Quad-City Times. ==Other editions== The Quad- City Times building in Downtown Davenport The newspaper receives Iowa political news from Lee Enterprises' Des Moines bureau, and Illinois political news from its Springfield bureau.

From 1927 through sometime in the 2000s decade, the Bettendorf News was a stand-alone weekly newspaper. Since 1975, the newspaper has been owned by Lee Enterprises, and during the 2000s decade, the newspaper became a weekly section comprising features, sports recaps and community news. In the past, special weekly sections were also published for the Clinton, and both the upper and lower Rock Island County markets, but these have since been discontinued. ==Previous publications== Other publications previously produced by the Quad-City Times included: * On the River, a journal dedicated to life on the Mississippi River.

It is loosely based on events that took place after the Malmedy massacre during the Battle of the Bulge. The film stars Corbin Allred, Alexander Niver, Lawrence Bagby, and Peter Asle Holden as the four American soldiers trying to return Kirby Heyborne, a British soldier with vital intelligence, to the Allied lines. After conducting research on World War II and Battle of the Bulge, Little began shooting in January 2003 in Utah. Filming lasted 30 days. Little and Abel were able to save money on production by recruiting a group of World War II reenactors who volunteered their services, costumes, and props. Excel Entertainment released the film at festivals to garner publicity before it was released to the public. The movie won numerous Best Picture awards from over 15 film festivals. Critical reception was generally positive with praise towards the message, story, performances (particularly of Allred and Niver), production values and action sequences. Though the screenplay, pacing and ties to Mormonism were criticized by some reviewers, several film scholars argued that despite the LDS-related themes, the film appeals to a wide audience. The film generated two sequels: Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed and Saints and Soldiers: The Void. ==Plot== During the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, the Germans open fire on their American prisoners of war, in what is known as the Malmedy massacre, killing many troops as they try to run away. Medic Steven Gould (Alexander Niver) manages to escape with Corporal Nathan 'Deacon' Greer (Corbin Allred). Gould and Deacon are joined by two other survivors, Shirl Kendrick (Larry Bagby), a member in Gould's division, and Deacon's close friend Sergeant Gordon Gunderson (Peter Asle Holden). The four stumble on RAF pilot Flight Sergeant Oberon Winley (Kirby Heyborne). Winley explains he has important intelligence photographs he has to get back to the Allies and the group decide to try and reach the Allied lines some 20 miles away. The group fights against German troops, a winter storm, and personal conflict to return Winley to Allied territory. ==Cast== * Corbin Allred as Corporal Nathan \\"Deacon\\" Greer * Alexander Niver as Private Steven Gould * Kirby Heyborne as Flight Sergeant Oberon Winley * Larry Bagby as Private Shirley \\"Shirl\\" Kendrick * Peter Asle Holden as Staff Sergeant Gordon \\"Gundy\\" Gunderson * Ethan Vincent as Rudolph Gertz * Melinda Renee as Catherine Theary - Belgian woman * Ruby Chase O'Neil as Sophie Theary - Catherine's daughter * Lincoln Hoppe as German soldier ==Production== Ryan Little's first project was short film The Last Good War, which won a Student Emmy. Little wanted to produce a World War II themed feature film. In 2002, new director Ryan Little teamed up with film producer Adam Abel to create the film production company, Go Pictures. After finding a private investor in California, Little and Abel sought to produce the film on a budget of $780,000. The original title of the film was \\"Saints and War\\". Before the film had a script, the filmmakers scouted filming locations, determining the film's plot based on available locations and props. They researched World War II events and interviewed World War II veterans to develop the story and characters. Little and Abel quickly cast Corbin Allred and Kirby Heyborne. However, because Heyborne has appeared in many other LDS Church related movie roles, they instructed Heyborne to grow a mustache, dye his hair, use a British accent, and smoke during the movie. Because Heyborne did not smoke, he smoked herbal cigarettes in the movie and practiced dragging daily for a few weeks before filming. Additionally, Heyborne did not have access to a dialect coach so he became familiar with British accents by watching other films. Heyborne was concerned that this would make him a target for film critics. To save on costs, Little and Abel used World War II reenactors as actors who volunteered to travel to Utah and bring their World War II prop equipment at their own expense. The film was shot in early 2003 in 30 days in Utah, Wasatch, and Salt Lake counties in Utah. Camera angles were carefully positioned to avoid showing the Wasatch mountains on camera to create the illusion of being in the Ardennes. They shot the film in January to use the available snow for their set, but they had to use potato flakes when there was not enough snow. Moreover, tight filming budgets required actors to do their own film stunts. Snow and freezing temperatures were challenges to filming which was worsened by the period clothing costumes. Saints and Soldiers was originally rated \\"R\\" by the MPAA, solely for war violence and related images. The director, writers, and producer wanted a rating of \\"PG-13\\". Some criticism has been leveled against the MPAA rating board with regard to their rating independent films more harshly than those of the large studios. (See also \\"LDS cinema and MPAA ratings\\".) The MPAA never communicated to the filmmakers any specific scenes that warranted the rating though Deseret News film critic Chris Hicks speculates that the reason may be due to two scenes, one in which Nazis execute prisoners of war and another that showed a closeup of a leg wound. Producers edited the film to receive a \\"PG-13\\" rating for commercial distribution. The film was officially granted a PG-13 rating on March 30, 2004. ===Historical inaccuracies=== Several members of the 101st Airborne Division are depicted as being present at the massacre. In reality, the 101st was held in strategic reserve by SHAEF at this point in time to recover from combat in Operation Market-Garden. The 101st did not reach the front until December 18 (the massacre was on the 17th), and was sent to Bastogne, far to the south of where Kampfgruppe Joachim Peiper operated. Most of the victims were from the 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion. Furthermore, the events of the massacre are depicted as taking place in deep snow, while in fact it snowed heavily after the massacre. ==Release and reception== The first screening of the film was at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii to an audience of U.S. Naval officers and their wives. The film opened at film festivals nationwide. Saints and Soldiers represents the first LDS film produced after 2000 to be exhibited in film festivals before general release to gain publicity. It was the highest-grossing film released by Excel Entertainment, an entertainment section which targets an LDS Church audience. It grossed over $1 million. Saints and Soldiers was released on video and DVD in May 2005. The reaction to Saints and Soldiers was generally positive. The Washington Times called the film, \\"one of the sharpest and most compelling entries of the early 'Mormon cinema' era\\". The New York Times wrote that the film's, \\"impressive cast of largely unknown actors...[and] meticulously researched film tells its story with quiet conviction.\\" However, Variety insisted that the script had \\"letdowns\\", including anachronisms in the dialogue and other story incongruities, yet they commended the production value considering the film's low budget. The Seattle Times added that \\"the film is intended as a propaganda piece for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but the messages are very subtle, and the movie does have a place in the new WWII genre,\\" and is \\"appropriate for mainstream audiences.\\" Furthermore, scholar Travis T. Anderson, affirmed that films made by LDS filmmakers such as Saints and Soldiers and Napoleon Dynamite can still develop \\"widespread attention\\" or \\"critical acclaim\\". He continued by stating that neither appeals to an exclusively LDS audience nor alienates non-LDS audiences. Moreover, scholar Terryl Givens argued that Saints and Soldiers can be interpreted specifically or universally. Givens claimed that the screenwriting created a film which is authentically Mormon yet reaches to a myriad of audiences. Although ties to Mormonism in the film have been criticized by some, Gideon O. Burton called the film, \\"among the most-praised films of the Fifth Wave [of Mormon cinema] to date\\". ==Legacy== Saints and Soldiers won the 2004 Jury Award for Best Feature at the Stony Brook Film Festival. Furthermore, the film won the award for best picture at 13 other film festivals. The film was nominated for Best First Feature at the 20th Film Independent's Spirit Awards in 2004, losing to Garden State. A second film, Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed, was released on August 17, 2012. A third film, Saints and Soldiers: The Void, was released on August 15, 2014. ==References* * * Category:2003 films Category:American war drama films Category:American films Category:World War II films Category:Mormon cinema Category:English-language films Category:2000s war drama films Category:Films set in Belgium Category:Western Front of World War II films Category:Saints and Soldiers films Category:Films about the United States Army Category:2003 drama films Category:2004 drama films ","title":"Saints and Soldiers"},{"id":"2228851","text":"LPP may refer to: * LPP (company), a Polish clothing retailer * LPP (gene) * Labor-Progressive Party, Canadian Communist Party from 1943 to 1959 * Laboratoire de Phon√©tique et Phonologie, a French laboratory * Labour Party Pakistan * Latvia's First Party * Legitimate peripheral participation, how newcomers become old-timers in a community of practice * Length between perpendiculars, a ship measurement * License Program Product, a complete software product collection * Living Planet Programme, ESA Earth observation programme * Ljubljanski potni≈°ki promet, a public transport company in Slovenia * Lappeenranta Airport in Finland, by IATA code * Lynestrenol phenylpropionate, a progestin that was never marketed * Low-fade positive print, a type of archival color motion picture film ","title":"LPP"},{"id":"2228854","text":"Jos√© N√∫√±ez (born in Tacuaremb√≥), was the first, third, and fifth President (then called Supreme Director) of Nicaragua from 10 March 1834 to 23 April 1835, from 25 January 1837 to January 1838, from 13 March 1838 to 1838 and from 17 November 1838 to 23 April 1839, respectively.

Later he served as a President of one of the several competing governments of Nicaragua from October 30, 1855 to June 24, 1857. However, he was merely a puppet president; rule was held by William Walker. He belonged to the Democratic Party (Liberal Party). Rivas provisionally occupied the Presidency of the Republic of this Central American country during the worst period of the National War of Nicaragua, between October 25, 1855 and June 24, 1857. He had to face the parallel governments of the entreguista Ferm√≠n Ferrer (legitimist) and the usurper William Walker (filibuster). He briefly served as interim Supreme Director of the State of Nicaragua from June 30 to July 27, 1839, before being popularly elected as Supreme Director, a position he held from September 21, 1840 to March 4, 1841 . In 1855, Patricio Rivas was appointed Provisional President as a result of an agreement signed in Granada between the Legitimist General Ponciano Corral and the filibuster William Walker, de facto head of the democratic side. This agreement was rejected by the legitimist Jos√© Mar√≠a Estrada who was the Acting President. Rivas had the support of Walker at the beginning of his government. Due to the patriotic attitude of the government of the Costa Rican President Juan Rafael Mora Porras against the presence of the filibusters in Nicaragua, the government of Rivas declared war on Costa Rica in early 1856, invading Guanacaste. However, the Costa Ricans commanded by Juan Rafael Mora, defeated the filibusters in the battle of Santa Rosa and the Second Battle of Rivas (not to be confused with the First Battle of June 29, 1855, and in which Enmanuele Mongalo had a heroic role to burn the Mes√≥n de M√°ximo Espinoza). The candidacies of Rivas, M√°ximo Jerez, and Trinidad Salazar were presented at convened elections to elect a new President. None obtained an absolute majority and it seemed that Congress was going to choose Jerez. However, Walker wanted to be called new elections. Rivas, eager to get rid of the tutelage of the filibuster, moved from Granada to Le√≥n, where Walker arrived in June 1856, still in apparent cordiality. But, when Walker left, Rivas moved the government to Chinandega and repealed his decree calling for elections. Walker then announced in Granada the deposition of Rivas and his replacement by the proxy government of Ferm√≠n Ferrer. Rivas declared Walker a traitor in Nicaragua, and remained at the head of the government in the western region of the country, where the armies of Guatemala and El Salvador arrived shortly after, attacking the cities of Granada and Masaya. For its part, the Costa Rican army expelled the filibusters from the San Juan river basin. Walker capitulated on May 1, 1857. Shortly thereafter, on June 24, a triumvirate took office, composed of M√°ximo Jerez and Tom√°s Mart√≠nez Guerrero, which ended the turbulent government of Patricio Rivas.

There are different types of fileset though the context will usually give the defining characteristic. Sometimes it is necessary to explicitly state the fileset type to avoid ambiguity, am example is the emacs editor which explicitly mentions its Version Control (VC) fileset type to distinguish from its \\"named files\\" fileset type. ==Fileset types== While there is probably no classification of fileset types some common usage cases do emerge: * A fileset type where the set of files in the fileset are simply enumerated or selected, as an example in the way named filesets are constructed in emacs. * The set of files included in an software installation package is used in both the AIX operating system installation packaging system, and the HP-UX packaging system. * For fileset types relating to filesystems there may be a relationship to directories. In terms of Namespace Database (NSDB) Protocol for Federated File Systems: * In coding forms some libraries may define a fileset object type, typically as a case specific name Fileset, or FileSet which is used to hold an object which references a set of files. ==Specific examples== Fileset has several meanings and usages, depending on the context. Some examples are: In the AIX operating system installation packaging system it is the smallest individually installable unit (a collection of files that provides a specific function). DCE/DFS uses the term fileset to define a tree containing directories, files, and mount points (links to other DFS filesets). A DFS fileset is also a unit of administrative control. Properties such as data location, storage quota, and replication are controlled at this level of granularity. The concept of a fileset in DFS is essentially identical to the concept of a volume in AFS. The glamor filesystem uses the same concept of filesets. Filesets are lightweight components compared to file systems, so management of a file set is easier. In IBM GPFS represents a set of files within a file system which have an independent inode space. ==References== Category:Computing terminology ","title":"Fileset"},{"id":"2228873","text":"Emiliano Madriz was the acting 16th President (then called Supreme Director) of Nicaragua from 26 September to 16 December 1844.

Each state-sponsored body has a sponsor Minister who acts as shareholder, either independently, or in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, who may also be a shareholder. State-sponsored bodies are often popularly called semi-state companies, a misnomer, since they are all (mostly) fully owned by the state, in addition not all of them are actually companies. ==Statutory corporations== State-sponsored bodies may be organised as statutory corporations, meaning that they are officially non-profit and do not formally have shareholders, but have a board or other authority appointed by the sponsor Minister. Corporations of this type include: * C√≥ras Iompair √âireann (Irish Transport Company) * Electricity Supply Board * Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann (Radio and Television of Ireland) * Voluntary Health Insurance Board (Vhi Healthcare) * Horse Racing Ireland * Teilif√≠s na Gaeilge * Bord Bia (Food Board) * IDA Ireland (Industrial Development Authority) Statutory corporations are governed under the particular statute that they are established under, and are not subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts, though similar requirements are often stated in the statute. The statutory corporation form of governance has fallen out of favour recently, with it being seen as less transparent and less commercially free than the limited company (see below). It is planned that VHI will become a limited company in the near future. On 21 January 2006 The Irish Times reported that the ESB and BGE will also move to plc status, however, both companies remained in government hands and never went to plc status. Under the draft Broadcasting Bill 2006 RT√â and Telef√≠s na Gaeilge would have become companies limited by guarantee, however the final Broadcasting Act 2009 retained their statutory corporation status. ==Companies with the Government as shareholder== Others may be organised as public limited companies or private limited companies. These are incorporated with the Companies Registration Office (Ireland) as companies, but their sole (or sometimes majority) shareholder is their sponsor minister. Some of these are exempt from the requirement to carry limited, teoranta, plc, or cpt as part of their company name. State-sponsored bodies incorporated in this fashion are, unlike their statutory corporation peers, subject to the provisions of the Companies' Acts. They have issued share capital, a board of directors, and all the other features of the type of company they are incorporated as. In the case of bank shareholdings, these are the results of recapitalisation during the Irish banking crisis, and are all intended to be sold in timePost-2008 Irish banking crisis Examples include: Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine * Bord na gCon (Irish Greyhound Board) * Coillte (Commercial Irish Forestry Business) * Horse Racing Ireland * Irish National Stud Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources * An Post (The Post Office) * Ervia * Bord na M√≥na plc (The Peat Board) * EirGrid plc * Electricity Supply Board * Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann * TG4 Department of Finance * Allied Irish Banks plc - 71% shareholding * Bank of Ireland plc - 14% shareholding * Permanent TSB - 75% shareholdinghttps://www.gov.ie/en/publication/066a28-banks/ Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport * Dublin Airport Authority plc * Shannon Airport Authority * Cork Airport Authority * Dublin Port Company * Port of Cork * Drogheda Port Company * Galway Harbour Company * New Ross Port Company * Shannon Foynes Port Company * Port of Waterford Company * Wicklow Port Company * C√≥ras Iompair √âireann ===Prominent subsidiaries of State-Sponsored Bodies=== Companies which are subsidiaries of state-sponsored bodies, but which enjoy a separate identity and legal existence, include: Subsidiaries of C√≥ras Iompair √âireann: * Iarnr√≥d √âireann - Irish Rail * Bus √âireann - Irish Bus * Bus √Åtha Cliath - Dublin Bus Subsidiaries of Dublin Airport Authority: * Aer Rianta International cpt Subsidiaries of An Post * Prize Bond Company * Data Ireland Subsidiaries of Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann: * 2RN * RT√â Commercial Enterprises Subsidiary of Horse Racing Ireland * Tote Ireland Limited ==Privatisations== Like many countries with extensive state owned sectors, the Irish Government has embarked on a programme of privatisations in recent years. Privatisations have always been controversial in Ireland. In 1991 the chief executive of Greencore was forced to resign immediately prior to the company's flotation when it was discovered he was a shareholder in a company which had been purchased by Irish Sugar prior to its flotation. However it was after the drop in the Eircom share price following the company's flotation that many became opposed to future privatisations. ===List of privatised State-Sponsored Bodies=== * Dairy Disposal Company - Dairies returned to private ownership * Irish Sugar plc - listed on the Irish Stock Exchange as Greencore Group plc. * Irish Life Assurance plc - listed on the ISE, later merged with Irish Permanent to form Irish Life and Permanent plc.

It is the largest United States FAA Part 135 cargo carrier, operating scheduled and contract cargo services from 19 bases to destinations in 250 cities across 43 US states, as well as Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America. Ameriflight serves major financial institutions, freight forwarders, laboratories and overnight couriers in the US and provides feeder services for overnight express carriers nationwide and internationally. Ameriflight averages 525 daily departures with over 100,000 combined flight hours annually and a 99.5% on-time performance. Ameriflight employs over 700 people (225 pilots, 140 mechanics). ==History== Ameriflight was established in 1968 as California Air Charter. The company's first route, CalAir 103, was bank mail and cancelled checks flown in a Piper Cherokee Six (PA-32) from Hollywood-Burbank Airport to Riverside Municipal Airport, and then on to Blythe Airport near the Colorado River. The company merged in 1971 with United Couriers (UCI), a wholly owned subsidiary of ATI Systems International (ATIS). In April 1993 the fixed-wing division of Wings Express (which was based at Van Nuys Airport) was purchased, and the outstanding shares of Sports Air Travel were acquired in mid-1997. In March 2007, when Canadian company Garda Security bought ATIS, Ameriflight was sold to a group of investors including the company's president, Gary Richards. In May 2014 the airline announced it was moving its headquarters to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Maintenance operations and flight operations are scheduled to move to DFW.Murray, Lance and Nicholas Sakelaris. \\"Cargo carrier Ameriflight to relocate HQ, operations to D/FW Airport.\\" Dallas Business Journal. May 15, 2014. Retrieved on May 16, 2014. In late 2014 Ameriflight reached agreement to acquire Wiggins Airways (48 aircraft and 100 employees), which would result in Ameriflight becoming the largest regional air cargo carrier in the world with 163 aircraft in its fleet. ==Flight services== An Ameriflight Beechcraft Model 99 upon take-off from Mojave Air and Space Port (2009). The majority of Ameriflight's operations consists of air feeder service for major package express integrators such as UPS, FedEx, and DHL. Other significant customers include Lantheus Medical Imaging, ACS Products, and Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals. On schedules set by the customers, cargo is received in the early morning from large jet freighters at hub airports and distributed by Ameriflight airplanes to smaller communities whose traffic (or airports) would not support the big airplanes. In the evening, the Ameriflight aircraft fly back to the hubs, in order to feed them with cargo from the smaller communities, which is carried onwards to the integrators' distribution centers for sorting and redistribution to the ultimate destinations. Although demand is decreasing as use of digital imaging and electronic data transfer increases, Ameriflight also transports high priority intercity financial documents. Pharmaceuticals, film for development, medical laboratory samples, and other miscellaneous cargo are also carried. Ameriflight is one of the few Part 135 cargo carriers in the U.S. with a special Department of Transportation permit to carry high Transport Index radioactive cargo, an important element in the company's time-critical radioactive medical raw materials business, which transports radioactive \\"generator\\" materials between points of manufacture and cities where it is used to produce materials used in diagnostics and cancer therapy. In addition to scheduled flying (with contract schedules set by customers), all Ameriflight bases can respond to unscheduled on-demand cargo flights to destinations in Alaska, Canada, throughout the contiguous U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean, and into South America. A single King Air 200 was used for on-demand passenger charter flights but has since been retired. ==FleetCurrent=== EMB-120ER Brasilia rests on the ramp at the company's new DFW Airport headquarters.

The pilot was killed in the crash. The NTSB determined that a propeller blade separated from the right propeller hub. The rest of the propeller hub then separated striking the right front of the fuselage and the damage done made the aircraft uncontrollable.NTSB Report LAX89FA314 - 09/09/1992 -  AMF107 An Ameriflight Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain (registered N78DE) on a cargo flight, departed from Hollywood-Burbank Airport flying non-stop to Oakland International Airport. At approximately 23:46 local time the aircraft collided with terrain near the summit of Mount Pinos approximately 9 miles west of Frazier Park. The airplane was destroyed, and the ATP rated pilot was killed in the crash. The NTSB determined the probable cause was the pilot's failure to select a cruise altitude which would ensure adequate terrain clearance. Contributing factors related to the dark, nighttime condition and to the pilot's lack of attentiveness.NTSB Report LAX94FA149, adopted - 02/24/1995 - 16 November 1994  - An Ameriflight Beechcraft Model 99 (registered N63995) on a cargo flight from Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport to Oakland International Airport descended steeply into the ground from cruise altitude near Avenal and the pilot was killed in the crash. The probable cause could not be determined, although pilot incapacitation was suspected.Ameriflight 1994 crash at the Aviation Safety Network - 23 December 1995  - While performing a 135.297 instrument competency check, an Ameriflight Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain (registered N27954) impacted terrain in the hills southeast of Oakland International Airport (KOAK) at approximately 00:19 local time. The airplane was destroyed, and the two pilots were killed in the crash. In the National Transportation Safety Board's narrative, they determined the probable cause as the failure of the air traffic controller to comply with instructions contained in the Air Traffic Control Handbook and vectoring an aircraft at below the minimum vectoring altitude (MVA). In addition, the ATC supervisor‚Äôs failure to detect and correct the situation. Lower situational awareness by the flightcrew was also considered a contributing factor.NTSB Report LAX96FA078, adopted - 03/31/1997 - 13 August 1997 AMF262 A Beechcraft 1900 (registered N3172A) was damaged in a crash, landing at Seattle‚ÄìTacoma International Airport and destroyed in a fire that had erupted from spilled fuel. Investigation into the accident determined that the airplane had been overloaded and that the pilot had been misinformed by staff members of the company that contracted for the flight about the cargo weight and center of gravity, which led to a stall1997 accident at the Aviation Safety Network during the landing flare. - 12 February 1999  - A Beechcraft C99 (registered N205RA) crashed into a canyon of the White Mountains, while en route a positioning flight from Tonopah Airport to Bishop Airport. The wreckage was finally discovered two days later. According to relatives and witnesses, the pilot (who was killed in the crash) had stated his intent to take aerial pictures of the local scenery and likely lost control of the aircraft while doing so.1999 crash at the Aviation Safety Network - 14 October 1999 AMF121 An Ameriflight Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain (registered N1024B) on a cargo flight from North Las Vegas Airport (KVGT) to Sacramento Executive Airport (KSAC) impacted terrain 11 miles north of KVGT airport. The pilot was fatally injured. In the National Transportation Safety Board's narrative, they determined that the probable cause was the failure of the pilot-in-command to maintain separation from terrain while operating under visual flight rules. Contributing factors were the improper issuance of a suggested heading by air traffic control personnel, inadequate flight progress monitoring by radar departure control personnel, and failure of the radar controller to identify a hazardous condition and issue a safety alert.NTSB Report: LAX00FA014, adopted 04/06/2001 - 29 November 2003 AMF1966 Flight 1966 from Boeing Field crashed into trees in bad visibility conditions while approaching its destination Felts Field, by which the pilot was killed. The aircraft involved, a Fairchild Metro III registered N439AF, had one of its two ILS receivers deferred due to intermittent flag activity at the time of the accident. The pilot had initiated his final descent late and then descended through the glide slope.2003 accident at the Aviation Safety Network - 18 March 2006 AMF2591 A Beechcraft Model C99 (registered N54RP) crashed during a flight from Helena to Butte in Montana about 8.1 miles South West of its destination, killing the two pilots on board. The plane impacted trees and mountainous terrain, where the wreckage could only be located on March 20. The cause of the crash was determined to be the pilot's failure to follow the proper instrument approach procedure.\\"Accident Description, Ameriflight 2591.\\" Aviation Safety Network.

Born in Guatemala City in 1804 to Bayardo Paez, he was initially known as Fruto P√©rez. His father, Pedro Jos√© Chamorro Arg√ºello, had come to Guatemala from Nicaragua for graduate studies. Fruto grew up in Guatemala and attended school there. His father returned to Nicaragua after completing his studies and married Josefa Margarita Alfaro Monterroso in 1814. They had six children, but Fruto was subsequently considered a member of this family, based on strategic needs related to administration of the family resources, for which the administrator was expected to be at least 25 years of age. He was acknowledged by his father shortly before the latter's death in 1824, and his stepmother insisted he use the name Fruto Chamorro P√©rez. The death of his father forced Fruto to leave his studies and go to Nicaragua to assume responsibility for the family and to manage the abundant inheritance of his father. His half brothers and sisters, Pedro Joaqu√≠n, Dionisio, Carmen, Mercedes and Fernando grew under his guardianship. Fruto's father was one of the founders of the Conservative Party of Nicaragua, centered on the city of Granada. He was committed to the Conservative cause and became an activist of the Party. In 1836, he became a representative in the State Assembly. From 1839 to 1842, he was a Senator of the State of Nicaragua. In 1842, an attempt was made to reestablish a union of Central American states as the Central American Confederation, in accord with the \\"Pact of Chinandega\\". It was to include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. In 1843, Fruto Chamorro was appointed Supreme Director of the Confederation junta, and he took up residence in San Miguel, El Salvador. However, Guatemala withdrew, and Fruto was instrumental in preventing a war over the decision. The nascent Confederation collapsed in 1844. In 1845, Fruto Chamorro was appointed Prefect and Military Governor of the Department of Granada, and Minister of the Treasury. In November 1851, during the administration of Supreme Director Laureano Pineda, he became Commander-in- chief of the Army. Fruto Chamorro himself became Supreme Director of Nicaragua on 1 April 1853. Almost immediately and with support of the conservative oligarchy, he transferred the government headquarters to Granada, the Conservative stronghold. He then convened a Constituent Assembly on 20 January 1854, to promulgate a new Constitution during the absence of the majority of the western (Liberal Party) representatives, virtually expelled from the country by the government's move to Granada. In March, Fruto Chamorro relinquished his title as Supreme Director and with acquiescence of the Assembly, named himself President of Nicaragua. The Liberals saw this as a restoration to power of the provincial oligarchy, continuation of a feudal economic system, and the diminished possibility of an alliance of all Central American reactionary forces as well. Memorial to Fruto Chamorro P√©rez Granada, Nicaragua They initiated a civil war by establishing their own government in Le√≥n in May 1854, with the support of the governments of Honduras and El Salvador. A force under the command of General M√°ximo Jerez was sent to besiege Granada. In preparation for the siege, President Chamorro placed himself at the headquarters of the Army and left executive authority with his deputy, Jos√© Mar√≠a Estrada. His defenses for Granada were successful and subsequent attacks failed to take the city. A victim of dysentery, Fruto Chamorro died at his hacienda outside Granada on 12 March 1855. A few months later, the city was taken in a surprise attack by the filibuster William Walker. He was married to Mercedes Avil√©s ..., without issue. ==References== * Nicaragua America Central, Presidents * Genealogia Familia Chamorro, por El Dr. Emilio Alvarez Lejarza (1951), Talleres Tipograficos y Litograficos de la Editorial Catolica, S.

This source is itself supported by over a dozen citations, many of which are primary sources. Gallagher spent much of his career on Nikumaroro, an island notable for its connection to Amelia Earhart. ==Background and early life== Gallagher was the son of Gerald and Edith Gallagher, and has a younger brother, Terence Hugh Gallagher. His father, Gerald Hugh Gallagher, was born in Ireland and attended the Catholic University in Dublin, becoming a doctor in 1905. Gerald Gallagher attended Stonyhurst College, the Downing College, Cambridge, and St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School. While in college, he was also active in gymnastics and rowing. After studying practical agriculture with George Butler (the father of the writer Hubert Butler) at Maiden Hall in Bennetsbridge, County Kilkenny, Ireland, he joined the Colonial Service in 1936. ==The Phoenix Islands== After arriving at Banaba Island on 21 September 1937, Gallagher received additional training before being appointed deputy commissioner of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony on 3 June 1938. Sent to Ellice Islands to learn Tuvaluan he became popular with the residents, who wanted him to stay. Nevertheless, after a bout with tropical ulcers he was assigned to the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme, as second-in-command to Harry Maude. In December 1938, they sailed with the first Gilbertese colonists to Manra in the Phoenix Islands, where Gallagher remained to supervise development of that island. When Maude fell ill in late 1939 and was assigned to Pitcairn Island, Gallagher was appointed officer in charge of the three atolls selected for development. He was assisted by Jack Kimo Petro, later characterized by archaeologist and historian Tom King as \\"a half-Tuvaluan/half Portuguese engineer and artisan of considerable skill and energy.\\" Gallagher's supervising role in the colony's local government was shared with leaders chosen from among the colonists. The young British official skillfully settled an early, hotly disputed debate among them by suggesting that instead of using the traditional Gilbertese boti system, each household be given a place in the maneaba, or local meeting house. The Phoenix Islands maneaba was subsequently named tabuki ni Karaka, or Gallagher's accomplishment. ==Success at Manra and Orona== By late 1940 there were roughly 672 settlers on Manra and Orona, with coconuts being harvested and processed into copra. On Nikumaroro an area on the southwest side of the island had been cleared and planted, a 20,000 gallon water cistern had been installed and water wells were finally productive. Gallagher, who by now had been affectionately nicknamed \\"Irish\\" by some of the settlers, chose Nikumaroro as the colony's government centre and moved there in late September 1940. == Nikumaroro == Gallagher wished to establish Gardner Island, (later renamed Nikumaroro) as \\"the model island of the Phoenix.\\" Although the gathering war interfered with shipping Gallagher and the settlers were persistent, starting work on the government station and an official rest house by manually clearing away many rocks and tree roots. The end of 1940 saw severe north-westerly gales which damaged newly built houses, coconut plantings and other facilities. The government station was later called Karaka, after Gallagher. It featured a large, expertly levelled parade ground with a crushed white coral surface and flanked on three sides by wide roads with coral slab curbs. At the eastern side two buildings were constructed on concrete platforms with others along the north and west, including a school, village carpenter's shop, boat house, concrete dispensary and a wireless station nearby to the north (with line of sight to Ocean Island). The village was to the south, with typical homes made up of sleeping quarters and a cookhouse under thatched roofs, sometimes raised on coral blocks. The most memorable building is said to have been the rest house, with its sweeping thatched roof and wide veranda, complete with a modern RCA console radio in a wooden cabinet (powered by large batteries). This was both Gallagher's residence and quarters for visiting officials along with other invited guests. ==Death on Nikumaroro== By early 1941 the Battle of Britain had distracted London's attention far from the tiny colony. Shipping was a constant challenge and Gallagher, now certified as fluent in the colonists' Gilbertese language, travelled on the few available ships, working day and night, personally loading and unloading supplies along with distributing coast-watching personnel and equipment throughout the colony, often in secret. On 20 September 1941, Sir Harry Luke, High Commissioner of the western Pacific, sent Gallagher a coded telegram with word he was about to be promoted as secretary to government and reposted to Ocean Island, but Gallagher didn't reply to the polite query asking for his thoughts on this. That day he had fallen seriously ill at sea with tropical sprue, an infection sometimes aggravated by poor nutrition which interferes with the small intestine's ability to absorb nutrients, resulting in symptoms related to malnutrition. He arrived at Nikumaroro on the 24th. Gallagher's first night back on the atoll and in the rest house seemed to bring an improvement. However, according to a witness, when Gallagher learned of his promotion the news put him at \\"the end of his tether.\\" He had come to consider the Gilbertese colonists his own native people. Meanwhile, with Gallagher's permission a British doctor opened his abdomen and was shocked by the advanced state of damage he found. Gallagher's condition deteriorated rapidly and he died on 27 September 1941, at the age of 29 ==Aftermath and Legacy== Nikumaroro, Manra and Orona were evacuated by Her Majesty's Government in 1963. At his mother's request, Gallagher's remains were moved to Tarawa for reburial and the memorial plaque was retrieved. Although reasons cited for giving up on the struggling colony included unstable water lenses and uncertain copra markets, observers familiar with the colony's history remarked that after Gallagher's death a will or nerve to succeed seemed to vanish from the settlements. In 2001 an American archaeological team put a replica of the plaque on his grave, quite unaware it had been empty for 38 years. They were on the island because during the height of the Battle of Britain in October 1940, Gallagher, a licensed pilot, had radioed his superiors in Fiji to inform them he believed a work party of Gilbertese colonists on Nikumaroro had found a sextant box along with the skeletal remains possibly belonging to Amelia Earhart, an aviator who disappeared in 1937. In 2007 Gallagher's long-empty 1941 grave was still visible in the overgrown ruins of the colonial government station on Nikumaroro. ==See also== *Nikumaroro *Phoenix Islands *Gilbert Islands *Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme *Kiribati *Amelia Earhart *Fred Noonan ==References *\\"Gallagher of Nikumaroro\\" by Thomas F.

Literary agents most often represent novelists, screenwriters, and non-fiction writers. They are paid a fixed percentage (usually twenty percent on foreign sales and ten to fifteen percent for domestic sales) of the proceeds of sales they negotiate on behalf of their clients. == Advantages == Literary agents perform various services for authors. They connect the author's work with appropriate publishers, negotiate contracts, ensure royalty payments, and mediate problems between author and publisher. Agents can help new authors get public recognition. Agents also help publishing houses and others expedite the process of review, publication, and distribution of authors' works. Many well-known, powerful, and lucrative publishing houses (such as the Big Five) are generally less open than smaller publishers to unrepresented submissions. A knowledgeable agent knows the market, and can be a source of valuable career advice and guidance. Being a publishable author doesn't automatically make someone an expert on modern publishing contracts and practices‚Äîespecially where television, film, or foreign rights are involved. Many authors prefer to have an agent handle such matters. This prevents straining the author's working relationship with the editor with disputes about royalty statements or late checks. An agent can also function as an adviser, showing an author the various aspects of how to make a living writing. Literary agents often transition from jobs in other aspects of the publishing industry. Though self-publishing is becoming much more popular, literary agents still fulfill a useful role as gatekeepers to publishing houses. == Diversity == Literary agencies can range in size from a single agent who represents perhaps a dozen authors, to a substantial firm with senior partners, sub-agents, specialists in areas like foreign rights or licensed merchandise tie-ins, and clients numbering in the hundreds. Most agencies, especially smaller ones, specialize to some degree. They may represent‚Äîfor example‚Äîauthors of science fiction, mainstream thrillers and mysteries, children's books, romance, or highly topical nonfiction. Very few agents represent short stories or poetry. Legitimate agents and agencies in the book world are not required to be members of the Association of Authors' Representatives (AAR), but according to Writer's Market listings, many agents in the United States are. To qualify for AAR membership, agents must have sold a minimum number of books and pledge to abide by a Canon of Ethics. Effective professional agents often learn their trade while working for another agent, though some cross over to agenting after working as editors. == Cost == Legitimate agents do not charge reading or other upfront fees (e.g., retainers), or bill authors for most operating expenses. They also do not offer to place work with a vanity or subsidy press. == Querying == A client typically establishes a relationship with an agent through querying, though the two may meet at a writers' conference, through a contest, or in other ways. A query is an unsolicited proposal for representation, either for a finished work or unfinished work. Various agents request different elements in a query packet, and most agencies list their specific submission requirement on their Website or in their listing in major directories. It typically begins with the author sending a query letter (1-2 pages) that explains the purpose of the work and any writing qualifications of the author. Some agencies want a synopsis or outline as part of the query. Often, the author sends the first three chapters (typically around 50 pages) of their work. For paper queries, the author must include a self-addressed stamped envelope to receive a response, though email submissions are increasingly common. If an agency rejects a written query, they send the response‚Äîtypically a form letter‚Äîin the self-addressed stamped envelope. A rejection that is not merely a form letter, or has hand-written comments (especially a message to the effect of \\"query me for other projects\\") is typically a good sign. == Notable agents == The first literary agents appeared around the year 1880 (Publishing). * Gerald Drayson Adams * Gillon Aitken * Carmen Balcells * Georges Borchardt * George T.

The bilateral system has its basis under the Chicago Convention and associated multilateral treaties. The Chicago Convention was signed in December 1944 and has governed international air services since then. the convention also has a range of annexes covering issues such as aviation security, safety oversight, airworthiness, navigation, environmental protection and facilitation (expediting and departure at airports). In 1913, in what was probably the earliest such agreement, a bilateral exchange of notes was signed between Germany and France to provide for airship services. One of the first ATAs following World War II was the Bermuda Agreement, which was signed in 1946 by the United Kingdom and the United States. Features of this agreement became models for the thousands of such agreements that were to follow, although in recent decades some of the traditional clauses in such agreements have been modified (or \\"liberalized\\") in accordance with \\"open skies\\" policies adopted by some governments, notably the United States. In principle all ATAs should be registered by the International Civil Aviation Organization in DAGMAR, the ICAO's Database of Aeronautical Agreements and Arrangements, but this source is not absolutely comprehensive. Air service agreements (ASA) are formal treaties between countries ‚Äì accompanying memoranda of understanding (MoU) and exchanges of formal diplomatic notes. It is not mandatory to have an ASA in place for international services to operate, but the cases where services exist without treaty are rare.

It is set in his Discworld universe, and features Lancre witches Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg. It was originally published in a sampler alongside a story called \\"The Wood Boy\\" by Raymond E. Feist, and later in a collection called Legends. The story established a basis for various elements of the novel A Hat Full of Sky, but is not required to understand that novel. ==Plot== A coalition of witches, led by self-appointed organiser Lettice Earwig, asks Granny Weatherwax not to participate in the annual Lancre Witch Trials, on account of her always winning. She agrees, becoming disconcertingly nice. ===Commentary=== It is revealed in later stories, most specifically the Tiffany Aching series, that this is because Granny has made it clear that she does not approve of Lettice Earwig's methods, and admitting that a rival is correct \\"at the time of her own choosing\\" is the greatest and most calculated insult Granny can possibly deliver to another witch, essentially having agreed with Lettice Earwig's own unwitting 'admission' that she cannot beat Granny. The title has confused people; Pratchett has since explained that Granny is the sea, and the other witches are the fishes (at one point Nanny says that calling Granny 'full of pride' is like calling the sea 'full of water'; water is what the sea is). It is based on the \\"ancient phrase\\" The big sea does not care which way the little fishes swim, which Pratchett made up at some point before the story, and finally used in Night Watch. ==Translations== *Rybki Ma≈Çe Ze Wszystkich M√≥rz (Polish) * \\"Œó Œ∏Œ¨ŒªŒ±œÉœÉŒ± Œ∫Œ±Œπ œÑŒ± œàŒ±œÅŒ¨Œ∫ŒπŒ±\\", translated by Nikos Manousakis, Anubis 2006.

She attended the Bronx High School of Science and went on to graduate from Yale University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1976 and Columbia Law School with a Juris Doctor in 1979.A Conversation with the Honorable Dora L. Irizarry, District Judge Accessed 2009-06-29 After law school, she worked as an assistant district attorney in the Bronx and Manhattan from 1979 to 1981. Irizarry said she wanted to improve the quality of life in the neighborhoods she grew up in, and specialized in drug and narcotics cases. ==New York state court judge== She was appointed a New York City Criminal Court judge by former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and then a judge of the New York Court of Claims by Governor George Pataki. As a Court of Claims judge, she served as an Acting Justice of the New York State Supreme Court, sitting in Brooklyn and Manhattan. She was the first Hispanic woman to serve as a state judge in New York. She was an assistant district attorney of the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor in the Bronx County District Attorney's Office from 1981 to 1987 and then in the New York County District Attorney's Office from 1987 to 1995.

It was released in 1989 and was the last album he created for MCA Records. Kershaw chose the album's title as he felt the album represented \\"the collected works of Nik Kershaw\\". He did not release any new solo material until 15 Minutes, 10 years later. The album was not commercially successful, though the lead single \\"One Step Ahead\\" reached No. #55 in the UK. \\"Elisabeth's Eyes\\", the second and final single, failed to chart altogether. Although the album was produced by Peter Wolf and co- produced by Brian Malouf, both singles were written shortly after Kershaw became unhappy with Wolf's production and his direction for the album. They were produced by Kershaw and Julian Mendelsohn, with the two also re-working the production of the entire album, earning them an additional production credit. After its original release, the album remained out-of-print on any format for years. However, in November 2006, the album became available via online MP3 download on major sites such as Amazon and iTunes. ==Background== In an interview of the time, Kershaw spoke of the album's creation and production: Speaking of working with Wolf, Kershaw said: The track \\"One World\\" was later issued on Kershaw's 1991 compilation The Collection, while the German vinyl and Japanese CD editions of the compilation featured a re- recorded version of the track instead. In recent years, Kershaw stated via his Q&A; sessions \\"Drum Talk\\" that the re-recorded version was to be a single after the release of \\"Elisabeth's Eyes\\", however this never materialised as he and the record label MCA parted company. In 1991, English pop singer Chesney Hawkes covered the song for his album The One and Only, where it also appeared as B-side to his third single \\"Secrets of the Heart\\".

Surgeons. Similar programs exist for immediate care providers such as paramedics. The program has been adopted worldwide in over 60 countries, sometimes under the name of Early Management of Severe Trauma, especially outside North America. Its goal is to teach a simplified and standardized approach to trauma patients. Originally designed for emergency situations where only one doctor and one nurse are present, ATLS is now widely accepted as the standard of care for initial assessment and treatment in trauma centers. The premise of the ATLS program is to treat the greatest threat to life first. It also advocates that the lack of a definitive diagnosis and a detailed history should not slow the application of indicated treatment for life-threatening injury, with the most time-critical interventions performed early. The American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma has taught the ATLS course to over 1 million doctors in more than 80 countries. ATLS has become the foundation of care for injured patients by teaching a common language and a common approach. However, there is no high-quality evidence to show that ATLS improves patient outcomes as it has not been studied. If it were studied, this would be known. ==Primary survey== The first and key part of the assessment of patients presenting with trauma is called the primary survey. During this time, life-threatening injuries are identified and simultaneously resuscitation is begun. A simple mnemonic, ABCDE, is used as a mnemonic for the order in which problems should be addressed. ===Airway maintenance with cervical spine protection=== The first stage of the primary survey is to assess the airway. If the patient is able to talk, the airway is likely to be clear. If the patient is unconscious, he/she may not be able to maintain his/her own airway. The airway can be opened using a chin lift or jaw thrust. Airway adjuncts may be required. If the airway is blocked (e.g., by blood or vomit), the fluid must be cleaned out of the patient's mouth by the help of suctioning instruments. In the case of obstruction, pass an endotracheal tube. ===Breathing and ventilation=== The chest must be examined by inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation. Subcutaneous emphysema and tracheal deviation must be identified if present. The aim is to identify and manage six life-threatening thoracic conditions as Airway Obstruction, Tension Pneumothorax, Massive Haemothorax, Open Pneumothorax, Flail chest segment with Pulmonary Contusion and Cardiac Tamponade. Flail chest, tracheal deviation, penetrating injuries and bruising can be recognized by inspection. Subcutaneous emphysema can be recognized by palpation. Tension Pneumothorax and Haemothorax can be recognized by percussion and auscultation. ===Circulation with bleeding control=== Hemorrhage is the predominant cause of preventable post-injury deaths. Hypovolemic shock is caused by significant blood loss. Two large-bore intravenous lines are established and crystalloid solution may be given. If the person does not respond to this, type-specific blood, or O-negative if this is not available, should be given. External bleeding is controlled by direct pressure. Occult blood loss may be into the chest, abdomen, pelvis or from the long bones. As of 2012, use of rFVIIa is not supported by evidence. While it may help control bleeding, there is a risk of arterial thrombosis, and other than in those with factor VII deficiency, its use should be limited to clinical trials. ===Disability/Neurologic assessment=== During the primary survey a basic neurological assessment is made, known by the mnemonic AVPU (alert, verbal stimuli response, painful stimuli response, or unresponsive). A more detailed and rapid neurological evaluation is performed at the end of the primary survey. This establishes the patient's level of consciousness, pupil size and reaction, lateralizing signs, and spinal cord injury level. The Glasgow Coma Scale is a quick method to determine the level of consciousness, and is predictive of patient outcome. If not done in the primary survey, it should be performed as part of the more detailed neurologic examination in the secondary survey. An altered level of consciousness indicates the need for immediate reevaluation of the patient's oxygenation, ventilation, and perfusion status. Hypoglycemia and drugs, including alcohol, may influence the level of consciousness. If these are excluded, changes in the level of consciousness should be considered to be due to traumatic brain injury until proven otherwise. ===Exposure and environmental control=== The patient should be completely undressed, usually by cutting off the garments. It is imperative to cover the patient with warm blankets to prevent hypothermia in the emergency department. Intravenous fluids should be warmed and a warm environment maintained. Patient privacy should be maintained. ==Secondary survey== When the primary survey is completed, resuscitation efforts are well established, and the vital signs are normalizing, the secondary survey can begin. The secondary survey is a head- to-toe evaluation of the trauma patient, including a complete history and physical examination, including the reassessment of all vital signs. Each region of the body must be fully examined. X-rays indicated by examination are obtained. If at any time during the secondary survey the patient deteriorates, another primary survey is carried out as a potential life threat may be present. The person should be removed from the hard spine board and placed on a firm mattress as soon as reasonably feasible as the spine board can rapidly cause skin breakdown and pain while a firm mattress provides equivalent stability for potential spinal fractures. ==Tertiary survey== A careful and complete examination followed by serial assessments help recognize missed injuries and related problems, allowing a definitive care management. The rate of delayed diagnosis may be as high as 10%.Enderson BL, Reath DB, Meadors J, Dallas W, DeBoo JM, Maull KI.The tertiary trauma survey: a prospective study of missed injury.J Trauma. 1990 Jun;30(6):666-9 ==Alternatives== Mannequin surgical simulators are widely used in the United States as alternatives to the use of live animals in ATLS courses. In 2014, PETA announced that it was donating surgical simulators to ATLS training centers in 9 countries that agreed to switch from animal use to training on the simulators. Additionally, Anaesthesia Trauma and Critical Care (ATACC) is an international trauma course based in the United Kingdom that teaches an advanced trauma course and represents the next level for trauma care and trauma patient management post ATLS certification. Accredited by two Royal Colleges and numerous emergency services, the course runs numerous times per year for candidates drawn from all areas of medicine and trauma care. Specific injuries, such as major burn injury, may be better managed by other more programs. In military medicine, the ATLS protocol has been modified to the BATLS protocol. The treatment procedure is cABCDE. Added c = Catastrophic bleeding (massive external bleeding). ==History== James Styner with three of his children who al received severe head trauma in the crash The Barron Beechcraft Plane after the crashATLS has its origins in the United States in 1976, when James K. Styner, an orthopedic surgeon piloting a light aircraft, crashed his plane into a field in Nebraska. His wife Charlene was killed instantly and three of his four children, Kenneth, Randy, and Kim sustained critical injuries. His son Chris suffered a broken arm. He carried out the initial triage of his children at the crash site. Dr. Styner had to flag down a car to transport him to the nearest hospital; upon arrival, he found it closed. Even once the hospital was opened and a doctor called in, he found that the emergency care provided at the small regional hospital where they were treated was inadequate and inappropriate. Upon returning to Lincoln, Dr. Styner declared: \\"When I can provide better care in the field with limited resources than what my children and I received at the primary care facility, there is something wrong with the system and the system has to be changed‚Äù Upon returning to work, he set about developing a system for saving lives in medical trauma situations. Styner and his colleague Paul 'Skip' Collicott, with assistance from advanced cardiac life support personnel and the Lincoln Medical Education Foundation, produced the initial ATLS course which was held in 1978. In 1980, the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma adopted ATLS and began US and international dissemination of the course. Styner himself recently recertified as an ATLS instructor, teaching his Instructor Candidate course in Nottingham in the UK, July 2007,Nottingham Evening Post-July 5, 2007 and then in the Netherlands. Since its inception, ATLS has become the standard for trauma care in American emergency departments and advanced paramedical services. Since emergency physicians, paramedics and other advanced practitioners use ATLS as their model for trauma care it makes sense that programs for other providers caring for trauma would be designed to interface well with ATLS. The Society of Trauma Nurses has developed the Advanced Trauma Care for Nurses (ATCN) course for registered nurses. ATCN meets concurrently with ATLS and shares some of the lecture portions. This approach allows for medical and nursing care to be well-coordinated with one another as both the medical and nursing care providers have been trained in essentially the same model of care. Similarly, the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians has developed the Prehospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS) course for basic Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT)s and a more advanced level class for Paramedics. The International Trauma Life Support committee publishes the ITLS-Basic and ITLS- Advanced courses for prehospital professionals as well. This course is based around ATLS and allows the PHTLS-trained EMTs to work alongside paramedics and to transition smoothly into the care provided by the ATLS and ATCN-trained providers in the hospital. On March 22, 2013, the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma renamed their annual Award for Meritorious Service in ATLS to the James K. Styner Award for Meritorious Service in honor of Dr. Styner's contributions to trauma care. ==See also== * ABC (medicine) * Advanced Cardiac Life Support * Advanced Life Support * Basic Life Support * Battlefield Advanced Trauma Life Support * Care of the Critically Ill Surgical Patient * Definitive Surgical Trauma Skills * List of emergency medicine courses * Pediatric Advanced Life Support * Trauma team ==ReferencesFurther reading== * * ==External links== * American College of Surgeons, About ATLS * Advanced Trauma Care for Nurses * Definitive Surgical Trauma Skills * About ATLS Category:Traumatology Category:Emergency medicine courses Category:Emergency life support Category:Medical credentials Category:Medical mnemonics ","title":"Advanced trauma life support"},{"id":"2229020","text":"Vermont Route 105 (VT 105) is a state highway located in northern Vermont in the United States. The route runs from U.S. Route 7 (US 7) in St. Albans in the west to the New Hampshire state line in Bloomfield in the east. The road continues across the state line as Bridge Street, a short unnumbered New Hampshire state route to US 3 in North Stratford, New Hampshire. As it is not a New Hampshire state highway, the connection is signed with Vermont state highway signage, similar to how connections to Vermont state routes are indicated elsewhere in New Hampshire. Moose are most often encountered on four roads in Vermont, of which this is one. They are seen from Island Pond to Bloomfield. == Route description == VT 105 approaching US 7 in St. Albans === St. Albans to North Troy === VT 105 begins at a fork from US 7 (Swanton Road) in the Franklin County city of St. Albans. VT 105 runs northeast along Sheldon Road, a two-lane road paralleling nearby railroad tracks. The route turns east and merges into Seymour Road, which changes names to Sheldon. Running along the northern side of St. Albans, becoming a two-lane rural road in the town of St. Albans. After a straight stretch of eastbound roadway, VT 105 crosses under, but does not intersect with Interstate 89\\\\. Now running northeast, VT 105 reaches a junction with the northern terminus of VT 104 (Fisher Pond Road). At this junction, VT 105 turns further to the northeast, retaining the Sheldon Road moniker as it crosses through rural St. Albans. Entering the town of Swanton, the route remains rural, crossing railroad tracks. The route soon crosses into the rural hamlet of Greens Corners, crossing into the town of Sheldon. At the junction with Bedard Road, VT 105 enters a small residential area in town, running north to the intersection with Woods Hill Road. At Woods Hill Road, VT 105 turns northeast again, crossing through woods and fields in Sheldon. VT 105 turns eastward, then bends southeast into the hamlet of Sheldon Springs. Crossing through Sheldon Springs, VT 105 crosses railroad tracks, paralleling with nearby Mill Street, which merges back in. The route runs southeast out of Sheldon Springs, paralleling the tracks, and crossing Missisquoi River. VT 105 reaches the hamlet of Sheldon Junction and an intersection with the eastern end of VT 78\\\\. Crossing through Sheldon Junction, the route makes a curve to the northeast again, paralleling the Missisquoi River. VT 105 becomes a rural roadway again, continuing near the river into a junction with VT 120 (Kane Road). VT 105 continues northeast along the riverside before beginning an eastbound wind through Sheldon. Passing an intersection with VT 236 (State Park Road). VT 105 approaching VT 108 in Enosburg Falls VT 105 soon crosses into Enosburg Falls runs southeast into the village, being main west‚Äìeast road through the community. Soon, the route meets a junction with VT 108 (Main Street), which becomes concurrent at the junction with VT 105 turning northeast along Main Street. Now the main north‚Äìsouth road through Enosburg Falls, passing commercial roads through the city. VT 108 and VT 105 continue northeast until the junction with West Berkshire Road, where VT 108 turns off to the northwest and VT 105 turns northeast on Sampsonville Road. VT 105 soon leaves Enosburg Falls, entering the town of Enosburg. Retaining the name Sampsonville Road, VT 105 winds east along the river, reaching the hamlet of Sampsonville. Changing names to East Berkshire Road, crossing into the town of Berkshire and junction with VT 118 (Berkshire Center Road). VT 118 and VT 105 are concurrent for a short stretch, reaching Montgomery Road, where VT 118 turns off. The route bends north as East Berkshire Road, continuing through the town of Berkshire. Continuing along the riverside, VT 105 soon enters the town of Richford, where it is a two-lane residential street. At the junction with Troy Street, VT 139 begins as Main Street, while VT 105 turns off on Troy. VT 105 runs southeast through Richford, paralleling the riverside out of the hamlet as Jay Road. Fast approaching the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border, the route turns northeast and into a junction with VT 105A (Glen-Sutton Road). VT 105A runs northeast to border while VT 105 runs through dense woods in Richford. Making a huge curve to the southeast, the route parallels the border, crossing into Orleans County. Now in the town of Troy, the route bends southeast and then makes a curve to the northeast, along some mountainsides in town. The dense woods start to break up as VT 105 reaches a junction with VT 101. === North Troy to New Hampshire === VT 101 ends at the junction as VT 105 takes over the right- of-way, running north into village of North Troy. In North Troy, VT 105 turns eastward along North Pleasant Street after a junction with VT 243, which runs to the Quebec border and Route 243\\\\. Running along North Pleasant, VT 105 crosses the east branch of the Missisquoi River, changing names to East Main, and turning southeast along a parallel of nearby railroad tracks. The tracks soon divert to the northeast as VT 105 returns to the town of Troy, running southeast through the rural town and turning east once again. VT 105 eastbound approaching VT 243 After crossing the railroad tracks again, VT 105 crosses into the town of Newport, paralleling a nearby creek. The route enters the hamlet of Newport, where it is the main northwest‚Äìsoutheast street through the community as a two-lane residential road. VT 105 soon leaves the hamlet, remaining in the town of Newport. Continuing southeast, the route reaches the northern terminus of VT 100, which trades its right-of-way to VT 105, running northeast. The route bends east, crossing into the town of Coventry. North of Walker Pond, the route bends northeast and turns east into the city of Newport. Now named Highland Avenue, VT 105 runs eastward along the hills around Newport, reaching a junction with US 5 (Pleasant Street). VT 105 and US 5 become concurrent along Pleasant Street, becoming the main street in the city. A block later, the route turns north on Third Street, heading toward Lake Memphremagog. Two blocks north of Pleasant Street, it turns east onto Main Street, paralleling the shoreline of the lake. At Railroad Square, VT 105 and US 5 turn north and crosses the lake. On the other side of the lake, the route parallels the Clyde River, reaching a junction with the western terminus of VT 191. Now known as Union Street, VT 105 and US 5 turn east onto East Main Street, paralleling north of VT 191\\\\. After the junction with Western Avenue, the route continues along East Main, passing north of Clyde Pond. Now in the town of Derby, it turns northeast and away from VT 191, entering an interchange with I-91 (exit 28). VT 105 and US 5 enter Derby Center as the main west‚Äìeast street. At the eastern end of the community VT 105 turns south on the same right-of-way. At this junction, VT 5A becomes concurrent with VT 105, which south through the southern edges of Derby Center, intersecting with the western end of VT 111. VT 105 and US 5 approaching downtown Newport VT 105 and VT 5A run southeast out of Derby Center and into the town of Derby, paralleling Lake Salem, which soon becomes another portion of the Clyde River. VT 105 and VT 5A continue along the Clyde, crossing into the town of Charleston. Now known as East Charleston Road, bending eastward into the hamlet of West Charleston. The route bends southward past Charleston Pond, where VT 5A forks to the southwest. Paralleling the Clyde River, reaching Pensioner Pond, which is surrounded by both routes on each shore, VT 105 turns further to the southeast, passing through the hamlet of East Charleston. Crossing the Pherrins River, VT 105 crosses into Essex County and the town of Brighton. Paralleling the Pherrins River, VT 105 continues southeast into a junction with VT 114 (East Haven Road). VT 105 and VT 114 run northeast through Brighton, reaching the hamlet of Island Pond. Now known as Derby Street, the routes reach the namesake pond, turning north onto Cross Street. One block north on Cross, VT VT 105 turns east onto East Brighton Road. Paralleling railroad tracks and Island Pond, VT 105 runs southeast, leaving Island Pond hamlet for Brighton State Park. The route continues southeast through woods, passing the John H. Boylan State Airport as it turns eastward, passing Nulhegan Pond. Now paralleling the Nulhegan River, VT 105 enters the town of Ferdinand, crossing through the hamlet of East Brighton. Continuing along the railroad tracks, VT 105 makes a long bend southeast and turns northeast again up a mountainside. Running along a mountainside, the route runs east paralleling the Nulhegan River, making a large bend southward into the town of Brunswick and soon into the village of Bloomfield. In Bloomfield, VT 105 runs northwest‚Äìsoutheast, crossing a junction with VT 102\\\\. After VT 102, VT 105 crosses the Connecticut River and enters the state of New Hampshire, marking the eastern end of VT 105\\\\.

Its headquarters were in One California in the Financial District, San Francisco, California.\\"Contact Information.\\" AirTouch. Retrieved on January 10, 2010. After a series of mergers, the company's vestiges are now part of Verizon Wireless. A tote bag bearing the AirTouch logo. ==History== At the time of the Bell System divestiture in 1984, each Regional Bell Operating Company (Baby Bell) was given a portion of the Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS) network corresponding to its service area. Pacific Telesis, the Baby Bell covering California and Nevada, spun off its wireless services as AirTouch Communications in 1994. U S West's U S West New Vector was also created from AMPS. In July 1994, U S West agreed to a joint venture with AirTouch as a prelude to merging the cellular unit into AirTouch. By 1996, all accounts were operated under the AirTouch name. Due to regulatory issues, the full merger was not completed until February 1998. As part of the merger, certain overlapping areas of coverage had to be sold to other wireless providers. Many of these went to GTE Wireless. On June 30, 1999, AirTouch Communications merged with UK-based Vodafone Group Plc, becoming Vodafone AirTouch Plc, after rejecting overtures from Bell Atlantic Corporation. In September 1999, Vodafone AirTouch announced a $70-billion joint venture with Bell Atlantic to be called Verizon Wireless, which would be composed of the two companies' U.S. wireless assets, Bell Atlantic Mobile (another AMPS spinoff) and AirTouch Cellular. This wireless joint venture received regulatory approval in six months, and began operations as Verizon Wireless on April 4, 2000. On June 30, 2000, the addition of GTE Wireless' assets, in connection with the merger of Bell Atlantic and GTE to form Verizon Communications, made Verizon Wireless the nation's largest wireless communications provider. For the joint venture, Verizon Communications owns 55% and Vodafone owns 45%. In 2014, Verizon Communications purchased the 45% owned by Vodafone. AirTouch Paging was re- branded as Verizon Wireless Messaging Services. In June, 2006, Verizon Wireless sold the paging division to American Messaging Services,http://www.americanmessaging.net/ effectively ending Verizon Wireless Messaging Services. Verizon Wireless still maintains a call center in some of the buildings that used to house AirTouch Cellular's call center and administrative offices. In 1994, AirTouch was considered by some to be an innovative company in its approach to employee management. It invested in its employees in incentives, training, opportunities, and innovation. They focused on Total Quality Management (TQM) which encouraged all employees to submit process improvement ideas annually following the Quality Blue Print Advantage. Notable were Benjamin Franklin ($100 bill) distributions with customer growth milestones from the GM/VP's desk without it being taxable and Right Things Right (internal employee recognition program). Former employees often plan reunions to reminisce fondly about their experiences with the company. ==Merger timeline== U S WEST NewVector Group logo *AirTouch Communications was formed when Pacific Telesis spun off PacTel Cellular in 1994.Vodafone *In July 1994, AirTouch Communications and US West formed a joint venture to eventually merge their cellular operations. *In May 1996, US West New Vector Group rebranded US West Cellular as AirTouch Cellular.http://www.isworld.org/onlineteachingcases/cases/USWest.pdf *In April 1997, AirTouch tried to buy US West New Vector but missed the Morris Trust filing deadline by one day.Federal tax legislation could force renegotiation of AirTouch/U S West deal  Mobile Phone News  Find Articles at BNET *In February 1998, AirTouch Communications bought US West New Vector from US West Media for $5.7 billion.

Carvel is best known for its soft-serve ice cream and ice cream cakes, which feature a layer of distinctive 'crunchies'. It also sells a variety of novelty ice cream bars and ice cream sandwiches. It is also known for its slogan, \\"America's Freshest Ice Cream\\". Carvel operates a chain of more than 500 franchised ice cream outlets. It has locations in 25 states mostly in the Northeast, along with Puerto Rico, and internationally in some Middle Eastern countries, found in high-traffic areas such as airports, malls, and sports arenas. The company also sells ice cream cakes in more than 8,500 supermarkets. Since 2001, the corporation has been owned by Roark Capital Group and operated as part of Focus Brands. As of 2020, the Carvel corporate website reports \\"more than 400 franchise and foodservice locations in more than 20 states and over 10 countries.\\" ==Novelty ice creams== Carvel popularized various novelty ice cream items, such as the \\"Flying Saucer\\", a circular ice cream sandwich, the \\"Icy Wycy\\", a paper cone of sherbet on a stick, \\"Brown Bonnet\\" and \\"Cherry Bonnet,\\" frozen vanilla ice cream on a sugar cone dipped in a sweet, waxy confection, the \\"Tortoni\\", a cup of vanilla ice cream covered with toasted coconut and topped with a maraschino cherry, and the \\"Lollapalooza\\", cylindrical ice cream on a stick covered with colored sprinkles, as well as the \\"Mamapalooza\\" and \\"Papapalooza\\". The mainstays of Carvel's line of ice cream cakes were 7- to 12-inch rounds, 10 x 14 and 12 x 17-inch sheet cakes, and the \\"Carvelog\\", a log-shaped cake made in a cylindrical mold. In addition to Cookie Puss, Fudgie the Whale and Hug-Me the Bear, there were special cakes for most major holidays, including a \\"Flower Basket\\" for Mother's Day, \\"Hoot The Owl\\" for June graduations, \\"Dumpy the Pumpkin\\" and \\"Wicky The Witch\\" for Halloween, \\"Tom the Turkey\\" for Thanksgiving, \\"Seamus The Leprechaun\\" or \\"Cookie O'Puss\\" for St. Patrick's Day, and Santa Claus or a \\"Snow Man\\" for Christmas. Most of these were made from one of a limited number of molds; the Santa Claus cake had a two-pointed hat because the mold was ordinarily inverted and used the rest of the year to make Fudgie the Whale, who had a tail. Their primary differences from products available year-round were the designs on the icing. Carvel introduced the Lil' Love ice cream cake on March 30, 1998. The commercials, which first appeared in its introduction, show small children in special situations, such as losing a baby tooth, starring in a class play, getting an A in a school class, and getting new glasses (sung to the tune of \\"Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay\\"). A mother presents the new cake to celebrate. All ads carry the tag line Surprise someone special tonight. ==History == Carvel logo from 1989 to 2012 Carvel was founded and operated by Tom Carvel for its first 60 years. In 1929, Carvel borrowed $15 ($ today) from his future wife Agnes and used it to buy and operate an ice cream truck. Over Memorial Day weekend of 1934, Carvel's truck had a flat tire in Hartsdale, New York. Carvel sold his custard at the site of the breakdown. Within two days Carvel had sold his entire stock, much of it partly melted. He realized that a fixed location and soft (as opposed to hard) frozen desserts were good business ideas. In his first year, he grossed over $3,500. By 1937 he had a custard stand at the Hartsdale site, with a freezer which allowed him to make his own frozen custard. By 1939, gross was over $6,000. In the early 1940s, Tom Carvel traveled, selling custard at carnivals, while his wife Agnes ran the Hartsdale location. During World War II he ran the ice cream stands at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, gaining expertise in refrigeration technology. He invented and patented a freezer, the \\"Custard King\\", and in 1947 sold 71 freezers at $2,900 each. Some freezer purchasers defaulted on payments on the units. Upon investigation, Carvel found that they were running their businesses inefficiently, choosing poor locations and not always maintaining high health standards. Carvel decided that the best course was to participate in running the operations of his freezer customers. He later claimed this led him to develop the concept of franchising. ===Franchising and advertising=== Carvel franchise, Canton, Michigan, 2012 Carvel soft-serve ice cream In 1949, Carvel began franchising under the name \\"Carvel Dari-Freez\\". By the early 1950s, the company had over 50 stores. New franchisees undertook an 18-day training program at the \\"Carvel College of Ice Cream Knowledge\\", and were sent an in-house magazine called \\"The Shopper's Road\\". In addition Carvel provided building plans for franchises, which were initially stand-alone glass fronted stores. In 1955, Tom Carvel began to record his own radio commercials. An unsubstantiated anecdote relates that he was driving in New York City, and heard a commercial for a new Carvel's store which did not mention the new store's location. Convinced he could do better, he drove to the radio station and did the next commercial himself. True or not, from 1955 onwards, Carvel recorded nearly all of the chain's advertising, eventually maintaining an in- house production studio at the headquarters offices, and becoming something of a regional celebrity. Carvel's commercials stood out and raised brand awareness primarily through their lack of sophistication. Carvel had a distinctive \\"gravelly\\" voice, lacking the \\"slick\\" sound of most professional voice-over artists, and all his narration was unrehearsed. His wording was conversational, with commercials frequently ending with the words \\"Thank You\\". Television commercials, aired primarily in the \\"tri-state area\\" of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, began in 1971. Accompanied by the familiar Tom Carvel narration, footage showed the products, and employees in the stores; very few graphics or effects were used. Promotions were part of Carvel's practices from their earliest days. In 1936, they had a \\"Buy One Get One Free\\" promotion, and in later years had various contests. They were an early adopter of corporate sponsorship of various events and tie-in promotions, including a tie-in with the New York Yankees. A long-running and well-known campaign was the \\"Wednesday is Sundae at Carvel!\\" discount. ===Further developments=== In 1956, Carvel transformed the Hartsdale location into their first \\"Ice Cream Supermarket\\" by adding freezer cases containing pre-made cakes and novelty items which customers could choose and purchase. In 1955, Carvel began its \\"lease back land offer\\" program, in which a potential investor could buy land, build a franchise, then lease it back to the corporation. Carvel experimented with various ice cream vehicle options for most of its early history. Vehicle concepts included a scooter (circa 1957) and a custom truck, the \\"Carvehicle\\", for which they applied for several patents (circa 1958). A dispute with franchisees came to a head in 1962. Independent owners attempted to buy products from outside the corporate supply chain (in conflict with their contracts), maintaining that the company was deliberately overcharging them. Carvel argued that the franchisees were trying to use inferior ingredients. As well as the immediate impact on corporate cash flow, this hurt the corporate image, reducing the chain to 175 stores. When the corporation tried to enforce this contract, the Federal Trade Commission sued them for restraint of trade. Legal proceedings reached the Supreme Court of the United States in 1964, with the corporation emerging victorious. In 1967, the corporation bought the Westchester Town House Motel, on Tuckahoe Road in Yonkers, New York and renamed it the Carvel Inn, converting it for use as corporate headquarters, while still operating it as a hotel, providing them with a conference center for the annual franchisee conventions. During the late 1970s, Carvel attempted to distinguish itself from other purveyors of soft-serve ice cream by claiming that its ice cream machines did not infuse the product with air, unlike the competition. During the 1970s, when dieting and fitness became more popular, Carvel began offering a low-fat frozen dessert called Thinny-Thin (\\"Thinny- Thin, for your fatty-fat friends\\"), and a frozen yogurt product called Lo-Yo. From 1973 to 1975, Carvel published a promotional comic book. In 1983, Saturday Night Live parodied Carvel's ad campaigns during its season 9 episode 7 show, with Joe Piscopo portraying Tom Carvel becoming increasingly troubled by a franchisee's line of X-rated Christmas cakes shaped like breasts, buttocks, testicles and penises. The same year, the Beastie Boys released their first single, Cooky Puss, which included audio of the rap band making prank phone calls to a Carvel store. By 1985, there were 865 stores with an income of over $300 million. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Howard Stern used a vocal harmonizer to imitate the \\"outer space\\" voice of Cookie Puss that was used in Carvel's TV advertisements. Stern also made frequent references to longtime co-worker Fred Norris's cluelessness and cheapness in having once given his mother a Cookie Puss cake as a Mother's Day gift. In 1989, an aging Tom Carvel sold the corporation to Investcorp for $80 million. In 1991, its headquarters was moved to Farmington, Connecticut. On December 11, 2001, Roark Capital Group, a private equity firm, purchased a controlling interest in Carvel Corporation from Investcorp. Investcorp became a minority share holder. co-branded store in San Ysidro, California Carvel was for most of its history a regional business, most strongly based on the east coast of the United States. As the business climate has changed, so has some of the focus of the brand. There are, as of 2018, approximately 418 retail franchises and food service locations, far fewer than at its peak. Carvel branded products are available in approximately 9,500 supermarkets. Celebration Foods has pushed the brand's presence from 30 states in 2004 to 49 in 2008, allowing them to form merchandising partnerships with national brands, such as ice cream cakes featuring Mars's M&M;'s characters. Focus Brands is based in Atlanta, Georgia, Celebration Foods is based in New Britain, Connecticut. In August 2007, the current owner of the original Carvel location in Hartsdale revealed that he had applied for permission to knock down the store and develop a retail strip on the property. The Hartsdale store was closed on October 5, 2008. In March 2009, the store was demolished to make way for a Japanese restaurant. In 2015, Carvel started to open co-branded stores with Auntie Anne's and Cinnabon. there were 371 Carvel franchises worldwide, with 324 in the US. ==See also== * List of dairy product companies in the United States * List of frozen custard companies ==References * Official website * Smithsonian Institution Carvel archives page * Washington Post video tour of Carvel archives * Hoovers Company Factsheet Category:Companies based in Hartford County, Connecticut Category:Economy of the Eastern United States Category:Regional restaurant chains in the United States Category:Dairy products companies of the United States Category:Restaurants established in 1929 Category:Ice cream parlors Category:Frozen custard Category:American companies established in 1929 Category:Ice cream brands Category:Farmington, Connecticut Category:1929 establishments in New York (state) Category:2001 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Carvel (franchise)"},{"id":"2229040","text":"The factored language model (FLM) is an extension of a conventional language model introduced by Jeff Bilmes and Katrin Kirchoff in 2003. In an FLM, each word is viewed as a vector of k factors: w_i = \\\\\\\\{f_i^1, ..., f_i^k\\\\\\\\}. An FLM provides the probabilistic model P(ff_1, ..., f_N) where the prediction of a factor f is based on N parents \\\\\\\\{f_1, ..., f_N\\\\\\\\}. For example, if w represents a word token and t represents a Part of speech tag for English, the expression P(w_iw_{i-2}, w_{i-1}, t_{i-1}) gives a model for predicting current word token based on a traditional Ngram model as well as the Part of speech tag of the previous word. A major advantage of factored language models is that they allow users to specify linguistic knowledge such as the relationship between word tokens and Part of speech in English, or morphological information (stems, root, etc.) in Arabic. Like N-gram models, smoothing techniques are necessary in parameter estimation. In particular, generalized back-off is used in training an FLM. ==References== * Category:Language modeling Category:Statistical natural language processing Category:Probabilistic models ","title":"Factored language model"},{"id":"2229041","text":"The N400 is a component of time-locked EEG signals known as event-related potentials (ERP). It is a negative-going deflection that peaks around 400 milliseconds post-stimulus onset, although it can extend from 250-500 ms, and is typically maximal over centro-parietal electrode sites. The N400 is part of the normal brain response to words and other meaningful (or potentially meaningful) stimuli, including visual and auditory words, sign language signs, pictures, faces, environmental sounds, and smells.(See Kutas & Federmeier, 2009, for review) ==History== The N400 was first discovered by Marta Kutas and Steven Hillyard in 1980. They conducted the first experiment looking at the response to unexpected words in read sentences, expecting to elicit a P300 component. The P300 had previously been shown to be elicited by unexpected stimuli. Kutas and Hillyard therefore used sentences with anomalous endings (i.e.I take coffee with cream and dog), expecting to see a P300 to the unexpected sentence-final words. However, instead of eliciting a large positivity, these anomalous endings elicited a large negativity, relative to the sentences with expected endings (i.e. He returned the book to the library) In the same paper, they confirmed that the negativity was not just caused by any unexpected event at the end of a sentence, since a semantically expected but physically unexpected word (i.e. She put on her high-heeled SHOES) elicited a P300 instead of negativity in the N400 window. This finding showed that the N400 is related to semantic processing, and is not just a response to unexpected words. ==Component characteristics== The N400 is characterized by a distinct pattern of electrical activity that can be observed at the scalp. As its name indicates, this waveform peaks around 400 ms post-stimulus onset, with negativity that can be observed in the time window ranging from 250-500 ms. This latency (delay between stimulus and response) is very stable across tasks‚Äîlittle else besides age affects the timing of its peak. The N400 is a negative component, relative to reference electrodes placed on the mastoid processes (the bony ridge behind the ear), and relative to a 100 ms pre- stimulus baseline. Its amplitude can range from -5 to 5 microvolts. However, it is important to note that in studies using the N400 as a dependent measure, the relative amplitude of the waveform compared to another experimental condition (the \\"N400 effect\\") is more important than its absolute amplitude. The N400 itself is not always negative‚Äîit is just a more negative-going deflection than that seen to other conditions. Its distribution is maximal over centro-parietal electrode sites, and is slightly larger over the left side of the head for visual words, although the distribution can change slightly depending on the eliciting stimulus. ==Main paradigms== A typical experiment designed to study the N400 will usually involve the visual presentation of words, either in sentence or list contexts. In a typical visual N400 experiment, for example, subjects will be seated in front of a computer monitor while words are presented one-by-one at a central screen location. Stimuli must be presented centrally because eye movements will generate large amounts of electrical noise that will mask the relatively small N400 component. Subjects will often be given a behavioral task (e.g., making a word/nonword decision, answering a comprehension question, responding to a memory probe), either after each stimulus or at longer intervals, to ensure that subjects are paying attention. Note, however, that overt responses by the subject are not required to elicit the N400‚Äîpassively viewing stimuli will still evoke this response. An example of an experimental task used to study the N400 is a priming paradigm. Subjects are shown a list of words in which a prime word is either associatively related to a target word (e.g. bee and honey), semantically related (e.g. sugar and honey) or a direct repetition (e.g. honey and honey). The N400 amplitude seen to the target word (honey) will be reduced upon repetition due to semantic priming. The amount of reduction in amplitude can be used to measure the degree of relatedness between the words. Another widely used experimental task used to study the N400 is sentence reading. In this kind of study, sentences are presented to subjects centrally, one word at a time, until the sentence is completed. Alternatively, subjects could listen to a sentence as natural auditory speech. Again, subjects may be asked to respond to comprehension questions periodically throughout the experiment, although this is not necessary. Experimenters can choose to manipulate various linguistic characteristics of the sentences, including contextual constraint or the cloze probability of the sentence-final word (see below for a definition of cloze probability) to observe how these changes affect the waveform's amplitude. As previously mentioned, the N400 response is seen to all meaningful, or potentially meaningful, stimuli. As such, a wide range of paradigms can be used to study it. Experiments involving the presentation of spoken words, acronyms, pictures embedded at the end of sentences, music, words related to current context or orientation and videos of real-word events, have all been used to study the N400, just to name a few. ==Functional sensitivity== Extensive research has been carried out to better understand what kinds of experimental manipulations do and do not affect the N400. General findings are discussed below. ===Factors that affect N400 amplitude=== The frequency of a word's usage is known to affect the amplitude of the N400. With all else being constant, highly frequent words elicit reduced N400s relative to infrequent words. As previously mentioned, N400 amplitude is also reduced by repetition, such that a word's second presentation exhibits a more positive response when repeated in context. These findings suggest that when a word is highly frequent or has recently appeared in context, it eases the semantic processing thought to be indexed by the N400, reducing its amplitude. N400 amplitude is also sensitive to a word's orthographic neighborhood size, or how many other words differ from it by only one letter (e.g. boot and boat). Words with large neighborhoods (that have many other physically similar items) elicit larger N400 amplitudes than do words with small neighborhoods. This finding also holds true for pseudowords, or pronounceable letter strings that are not real words (e.g. flom), which are not themselves meaningful but look like words. This has been taken as evidence that the N400 reflects general activation in the comprehension network, such that items that look like many words (regardless of whether it itself is a word) partially activate the representations of similar-looking words, producing a more negative N400. The N400 is sensitive to priming: in other words, its amplitude is reduced when a target word is preceded by a word that is semantically, morphologically, or orthographically related to it. In a sentence context, an important determinant of N400 amplitude elicited by a word is its cloze probability. Cloze probability is defined as the probability of the target word completing that particular sentence frame. Kutas and Hillyard (1984) found that a word's N400 amplitude has a nearly inverse linear relationship with its cloze probability. That is, as a word becomes less expected in context, its N400 amplitude is increased relative to more expected words. Words that are incongruent with a context (and thus have a cloze probability of 0) elicit large N400 amplitudes as well (although the amplitude of the N400 for incongruent words is also modulated by the cloze probability of the congruent word that would have been expected in its place Relatedly, the N400 amplitude elicited by open-class words (i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) is reduced for words appearing later in a sentence compared to earlier words. Taken together, these findings suggest that when the prior context builds up meaning, it makes the processing of upcoming words that fit with that context easier, reducing the N400 amplitude they elicit. ===Factors that do not affect N400 amplitude=== While the N400 is larger to unexpected items at the end of a sentence, its amplitude is generally unaffected by negation that causes the last word to be untrue and thus anomalous. For example, in the sentence A sparrow is a building, the N400 response to building is more negative than the N400 response to bird in the sentence A sparrow is a bird. In this case, building has a lower cloze probability, and so it is less expected than bird. However, if negation is added to both sentences in the form of the word not (i.e. A sparrow is not a building and A sparrow is not a bird), the N400 amplitude to building will still be more negative than that seen to bird. This suggests that the N400 responds to the relationship between words in context, but is not necessarily sensitive to the sentence's truth value. More recent research, however, has demonstrated that the N400 can sometimes be modulated by quantifiers or adjectives that serve negation-like purposes, or by pragmatically licensed negation. Additionally, grammatical violations do not elicit a large N400 response. Rather, these types of violations show a large positivity from about 500-1000 ms after stimulus onset, known as the P600. ===Factors that affect N400 latency=== A striking feature of the N400 is the general invariance of its peak latency. Although many different experimental manipulations affect the amplitude of the N400, few factors (aging and disease states and language proficiency being rare examples) alter the time it takes for the N400 component to reach a peak amplitude.Federmeier, K. D. and Laszlo, S. (2009). Time for meaning: Electrophysiology provides insights into the dynamics of representation and processing in semantic memory. In B. H. Ross (Ed.), Psychology of Learning and Motivation, Volume 51 (pp 1-44). Burlington: Academic Press. ==Sources== Although localization of the neural generators of an ERP signal is difficult due to the spreading of current from the source to the sensors, multiple techniques can be used to provide converging evidence about possible neural sources.Haan, H., Streb, J., Bien, S., & Ro, F. (2000). Reconstructions of the Semantic N400 Effect : Using a Generalized Minimum Norm Model with Different Constraints ( L1 and L2 Norm ), 192, 178‚Äì192. Using methods such as recordings directly off the surface of the brain or from electrodes implanted in the brain, evidence from brain damaged patients, and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings (which measure magnetic activity at the scalp associated with the electrical signal measured by ERPs), the left temporal lobe has been highlighted as an important source for the N400, with additional contributions from the right temporal lobe. More generally, however, activity in a wide network of brain areas is elicited in the N400 time window, suggesting a highly distributed neural source. ==Theories== There is still much debate as to exactly what kind of neural and comprehension processes the N400 indexes. Some researchers believe that the underlying processes reflected in the N400 occur after a stimulus has been recognized. For example, Brown and Hagoort (1993) believe that the N400 occurs late in the processing stream, and reflects the integration of a word's meaning into the preceding context (see Kutas & Federmeier, in press, for a discussion). However, this account cannot explain why items that themselves have no meaning (e.g. pseudowords) also elicit the N400. Other researchers believe that the N400 occurs much earlier, before words are recognized, and represents orthographic or phonological analysis. More recent accounts posit that the N400 represents a broader range of processes indexing access to semantic memory. According to this account, it represents the binding of information obtained from stimulus input with representations from short- and long-term memory (such as recent context, and accessing a word's meaning in long term memory) that work together to create meaning from the information available in the current context (Federmeier & Laszlo, 2009; see Kutas & Federmeier, in press). Another account is that the N400 reflects prediction error or surprisal. Word-based surprisal was a strong predictor of N400 amplitude in an ERP corpus. In addition, connectionist models make use of prediction error for learning and linguistic adaptation, and these models can explain several N400/P600 results in terms of prediction error propagation for learning. As research in the field of electrophysiology continues to progress, these theories will likely be refined to include a complete account of just what the N400 represents. ==See also== * Bereitschaftspotential * C1 and P1 * Contingent negative variation * Difference due to memory * Early left anterior negativity * Error-related negativity * Late positive component * Lateralized readiness potential * Mismatch negativity * N2pc * N100 * N170 * N200 * P3a * P3b * P200 * P300 (neuroscience) * P600 * Somatosensory evoked potential * Visual N1 ==References *Video of the N400 and P600 visualized as animated scalp topographies Category:Electroencephalography Category:Evoked potentials Category:Neurolinguistics ","title":"N400 (neuroscience)"},{"id":"2229056","text":"Then & Now: The Very Best of Nik Kershaw, released in 2005, combines Nik Kershaw hits, collaborations and a few new tracks. ==CD track listing== All tracks written by Nik Kershaw, except track 14 written by Jacques Lucont and Nik Kershaw All songs produced by Nik Kershaw, except Songs 1-7 produced by Peter Collins, Songs 11-12 co-produced with Julian Mendelsohn, Song 14 produced by Jacques Lucont ==DVD track listing== # \\"Wouldn't It Be Good\\" # \\"I Won't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\" (live version) # \\"Dancing Girls\\" # \\"Wide Boy\\" (full-length version) # \\"Nobody Knows\\" # \\"Human Racing\\" # \\"Don Quixote\\" # \\"When a Heart Beats\\" # \\"Radio Musicola\\" # \\"Elisabeth's Eyes\\" ==External links== * Category:2005 greatest hits albums Category:Nik Kershaw albums Category:2005 video albums Category:Music video compilation albums ","title":"Then and Now (Nik Kershaw album)"},{"id":"2229078","text":"This page lists the Barbershop Harmony Society's international quartet champions by the year in which they won.

It was heard on several frequencies in radio's early days, including 1170 kilocycles. In early 1928 the call letters were changed to KEJK.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, February 29, 1928, page 6. It switched to 710 kHz when it was sold to new owners in November 1929. In March 1930 it took the call sign that it would hold for 67 years, KMPC.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 30, 1930, page 10. The station was then owned by the MacMillan Petroleum Company, for which the station's call letters were chosen. The studios and offices were on 3651 Wilshire Boulevard, now part of the property of the Wilshire Boulevard Temple.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 22 Later, George A. Richards of Detroit acquired the station. KMPC became part of the Goodwill Station group that included WJR in Detroit and WGAR in Cleveland, both also owned by Richards. KMPC soon became Southern California's destination for sports programming, as it carried Pacific Coast League baseball, UCLA Bruins sports and, beginning in 1946, the Los Angeles Rams football team. ===Gene Autry=== Legendary singer and actor Gene Autry bought KMPC in 1952, making it the centerpiece of his broadcasting company, Golden West Broadcasters.Broadcasting Yearbook 1954 page 86 Autry eventually owned TV, AM and FM stations around the Western United States. During Autry's ownership, KMPC was a full service middle of the road station, featuring popular music, news and sports. Dick Whittinghill, Geoff Edwards, Wink Martindale, Gary Owens, Bob Arbogast and Roger Carroll formed a powerhouse lineup of disc jockeys during the 1960s and 70s. During 1958 and 1959 baseball seasons, KMPC was also the flagship station for the Los Angeles Dodgers radio network. In 1961, it became the flagship of the new baseball team, the Los Angeles Angels. KMPC and the Angels were both owned by Autry. KMPC remained the Angels' radio voice until 2008 (except for 1997 to 2002). In November 1963, Autry acquired Channel 5 KTLA, LA's top independent television station. The TV station's operations were at 5800 Sunset Boulevard, while KMPC Radio had its studios at 5858 Sunset Boulevard.Broadcasting Yearbook 1965 page A-6 KTLA was sold to investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in 1983, while KMPC remained under Autry's ownership. In the 1980s, KMPC adopted an adult standards format which featured big bands and vocalists. During this time, the legendary DJ Robert W. Morgan began a long stint as morning host. KMPC also aired a weekday evening sports call-in show hosted by Scott St. James, who was also a TV soap opera actor on the side. In the early 1980s, KMPC changed to talk radio and fired its DJs. Whittinghill, Owens, Johnny Magnus and Pete Smith went over to KPRZ and played standards as part of \\"The Music of Your Life\\" format. A few years later, KMPC returned to standards as \\"The Station of the Stars.\\"http://www.socalradiohistory.com/krkd.html, Retrieved on July 21, 2009. ===Sports radio=== In April 1992, KMPC became one of the first all sports stations on the West Coast, billing itself as \\"All Sports, All Hours.\\"http://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-01-31.pdf Jim Lampley and Todd Christensen were co- hosts of one program, Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian began their run as a popular local duo \\"McDonnell & Douglas.\\" Jim Healy, one of the most famous voices in L.A. sports, returned to KMPC after a few years at KLAC. Other show hosts included Brian Golden and Paola Boivin, Chris Roberts and Jack Snow, Fred Wallin and Tony Femino. ===ABC/Disney ownership=== In 1994, the Autry family sold KMPC to ABC, which already owned the successful talk station KABC. The price tag for KMPC was $17.5 million.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1999 page D-48 On May 2 of that year, KMPC began a general talk format to complement KABC. Hosts such as Tom Leykis, Stephanie Miller, Peter Tilden, and Joe Crummey headlined this new format.http://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-04-29.pdf On February 24, 1997, ABC Radio changed KMPC's call letters to KTZN, and flipped to a women's talk format.http://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-02-28.pdf The station hired multiple new hosts, including humor writer and David Letterman Show co-creator Merrill Markoe, psychologist Dr. Toni Grant and comedienne (and former KMPC host) Stephanie Miller. Under this format, the station failed to make the top 30 in Los Angeles Arbitron ratings. The women's talk format lasted less than six months. On August 26, 1997, Radio Disney was launched on the station with the KDIS call letters, becoming the network's fifth affiliate; the station carried the Disney children's radio service until 2003. ===KSPN moves to 710=== 150px As an ESPN Radio outlet, KSPN began on the former KRLA (1110 AM) in December 2000, after ABC purchased that station from Infinity Broadcasting. On January 1, 2003, ABC swapped its Radio Disney and ESPN Radio stations in Los Angeles, with 1110 taking Radio Disney and the KDIS call sign, while 710 became L.A.'s ESPN Radio outlet. KSPN was led by the sports talk team of Joe McDonnell and Doug Krikorian. The KMPC call letters were retired until acquired them in 2000. (The KMPC on 1540 kHz also had an all-sports format, using programming from the co-owned Sporting News Radio Network. On May 1, 2007, that station switched to Korean language programming.)

Steve Mason & John Ireland, football player D'Marco Farr and longtime ESPN personality Gary Miller were among the hosts who rotated through the midday slot from 2004-2007. On November 26, 2007, KSPN introduced yet another local lineup. Mason, sans Ireland, moved into the 1-4 p.m. time slot, followed in afternoon drive by a new show hosted by Dave Dameshek, a member of the Jimmy Kimmel-Adam Carolla comedy connection. Unique to Dameshek's show was a house band similar to those found on late-night television shows.Long Beach Press- Telegram, Nov. 16, 2007, page B2 New-to-Los Angeles Brian Long was hired for the evening show. In the programming shakeup, Kevin Kiley, who had served as an on-air foil to Farr, was let go, and, inexplicably, the popular Ireland also was let go. Ireland was rehired in April 2008 and reunited with Mason in the early afternoon time slot. ===2008‚Äì2009=== Just seven months later, on June 23, 2008, another new local lineup was introduced. Mason and Ireland went on from 1-4 while Dameshek was forced to share his show with Long and Dave Denholm, a three-man pairing. Dameshek eventually began a podcast-only show that has become among the parent network's more popular Web offerings, while Denholm and Long continued in afternoon drive. After KSPN got the Lakers rights, the station started morphing their already Trojan- and Laker-heavy talk programming to be even more Laker-centric. On July 10, 2009, unofficially known as \\"710 Day,\\" L.A. Sports Live with Andrew Siciliano and Mychal Thompson premiered from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mason and Ireland returned to their old drive time slot (3-7 p.m.), replacing Denholm and Long. ===2010‚Äì2018=== More time slot changes were made on April 5, 2010: With ESPN having reduced The Herd with Colin Cowherd to three hours (7-10 a.m. PT), L.A. Sports Live and Mason and Ireland each moved up by one hour but are still on for four hours each. Martinez and Long received a new time slot, 6 to 9 p.m. The local shows originated from ESPN studios at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. KSPN carried two other shows from the network: Mike and Mike in the Morning and All Night with Jason Smith, the latter of which originated from the KSPN studios. The Scott Van Pelt and Dan Le Batard shows moved over to secondary ESPN affiliate KLAA. In December 2010, Mike Thompson was hired as new Programming Director. Thompson reportedly fired Joe McDonnell outside a sandwich shop in Westwood.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KXTA+SHTICKS+IT+TO+BIG+JOE%3B+TALK- JOCK+JOE+MCDONNELL+STILL+BAFFLED...-a083846974 Thompson also introduced Arnie Spanier and Karl Malone to L.A. radio. Thompson's first move at KSPN was to replace Siciliano with a new show hosted by New Yorker Max Kellerman and former NFL player Marcellus Wiley. Mychal Thompson remained as a Lakers analyst and became a morning show host with Mark Willard, who was let go from the station on August 29, 2014. Thompson continued to broadcast in late mornings with Mike Trudell on \\"Thompson & Trudell\\" in the 10 a.m. to noon time slot. Long left the station in December to become program director of KIRO, the ESPN Network affiliate in Seattle. KSPN later added another New Yorker, Stephen A. Smith, to its weeknight lineup, followed by Martinez' \\"In the Zone\\" talk show. These shows were later dropped and KSPN began carrying ESPN Radio's ‚ÄúThe Freddy Coleman Show‚Äù in the evenings (when live sports or a team-focused hour is not airing). In June 2018, the morning show became \\"Keyshawn, Jorge, and LZ\\" (Keyshawn Johnson, Jorge Sedano and LZ Granderson). That was followed by the ESPN Network's Stephen A. Smith, hosting the late morning show, followed by \\"Mason and Ireland\\" in the early afternoon. From 3 to 7 p.m., Marcellus Wiley and Travis Rodgers hosted PM drive time. ==References * *KMPC 710 History & Tribute site Category:Disney radio stations SPN SPN Category:Radio stations established in 1927 Category:1927 establishments in California Category:ESPN Radio stations Category:Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim broadcasters Category:Los Angeles Rams broadcasters ","title":"KSPN (AM)"},{"id":"2229098","text":"The Lama () is a river in the Moscow and Tver Oblasts in Russia, a tributary of the Shosha.

Alv√∏en Manor was once one of the grander private homes in Bergen. ==History== Alv√∏en is the site one of Norway's oldest industrial communities and one of the best preserved industrial locations. In 1626, King Christian IV of Denmark granted the right to establish a gunpowder mill on the site. The mill was destroyed by fire in 1733, but rebuilt. Didrich Jansen Fasmer (1706-1770) improved it and built another gun mill in the 1760s. Towards the end of the 1700s, Alv√∏en became an industrial site with working houses attached to the factories. Later it started production of saltpeter, linseed oil and paper. Hendrik Jansen Fasmer (1766-1836) founded the paper mill during 1797. In 1858, Hendrik Fasmer (1835‚Äì1930) built a new papermill in Alv√∏en and from the late 1800s the production was concentrated on finer grades in different blends of cloths and cellulose. Alv√∏ens Papirfabrik A/S manufacturing paper in Alv√∏en until stopped production in 1981. At that time, it was the oldest paper mill in the country. The specialty was finer paper for documents and from 1908, supplier of paper for Norwegian banknotes. Alv√∏en (Norsk Vasskraft- og Industristadmuseum og Museumssenteret i Salhus) Alv√∏en Manor was the main residence of the owners of the paper factory of Alv√∏en. Alv√∏en Manor was originally built as a countryside retreat for members of the Fasmer family in 1797. Eventually the roccoco main building was surrounded by several gardens. Alv√∏en Manor and the factory were opened as a museum (Alv√∏en Hovedbygning) in 1983, as a branch of the West Norway Museum of Decorative Art. It is now managed by the Bergen City Museum. The site includes Alv√∏en Manor together with some forty worker cottages and production buildings dating from the 1800s.Historikk (Alv√∏en Gamle M√∏lle) Alv√∏en lies at the Vatlestraumen strait, west of Bergen, where the cargo ship Rocknes hit an underwater rock and capsized in January 2004.

His hockey style is quite adverse from the typical style of Swedish hockey players. His grit and intensity, especially among the boards, earned him the role of a dependable checker with the ability to add the odd goal/assist. A talent of Djurg√•rdens IF in Sweden, Nilson moved to North America in 1998 and played most of his first two years in the American Hockey League. After three full seasons with the Panthers, he was traded to the Calgary Flames on March 8, 2004, for a second round draft pick (used to select David Booth). In his first opportunity to play in the Stanley Cup playoffs, Nilson reached the finals and recorded 11 points in 26 playoffs games. He would play for three more years with Calgary. In the summer of 2008, the Flames placed Nilson on waivers and after clearing without being claimed by another club, he was loaned to Lokomotiv Yaroslavl of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) for the season. Nilson returned to Djurg√•rden for the 2009‚Äì10 season, signing a one-year contract. He led his team to the playoffs after scoring 24 goals and 51 points. Nilson kept producing points during the playoffs and Djurg√•rden reached the finals against HV71, which they lost four games to two. Nilson played with the New Jersey Devils on a try-out contract in September 2010, but was ultimately not offered a contract to play the season. ==Career statisticsRegular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

He was also involved in an attempt to resurrect Ansett airlines with Lindsay Fox following its collapse in September 2001. In 2008 he returned to the board of his public company Premier Investments and became its chairman. ==Business careerYannon transaction=== While Chairman of Coles Myer, Lew involved Coles Myer in a deal with a private company Yannon Pty Ltd which ultimately lost Coles Myer 18 million. An internal Coles investigation endorsed Lew's claim that he knew nothing of the deal, and a subsequent four-year investigation by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) ended with no charges being pursued. Alan Cameron, ASIC chairman at the time, acknowledged during the press conference to announce the outcome of the investigation that: \\"It is worth saying that the original loss suffered by Coles Myer was about 18 million, and the recovery made by Coles Myer was in excess of 12 million.\\" Lew contributed to this 1996 settlement with Coles-Myer. Cameron also said that it was \\"clearly true\\" that Lew was not guilty of any breaches of the law. When asked if he believed Lew was innocent, Cameron replied: \\"of course.\\" ABC Radio's PM program described the transaction: When Coles Myer's chief financial officer, Philip Bowman, resigned and revealed the details of the transaction it brought a great deal of unwanted public attention to Lew. Bowman's revelations prompted an investigation into whether the Yannon transaction broke the Corporations Law or other laws that lasted five years and gathered a quarter of a million pages of documents and twelve thousand pages of evidence. The ASIC recommended criminal prosecution against Lew in its brief, although the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, who had the final decision, decided not to proceed with criminal charges against Lew, Lew's advisers, or those working within Coles Myer. The Chairman of ASIC told the ABC: ===The Etiket transaction=== Another controversial business transaction involving Lew related to a single purpose trust called Etiket. The beneficiaries were Lew's family. The trust was used to acquire 2% of Coles Myer in 1989, at a time of high interest rates. Lew offered competing explanations for what happened next. But the end result was that the Coles Myer shares were assigned to Premier Investments for an 8 million profit. A Queen's Counsel who investigated the transaction said: === TESNA === Lew and Lindsay Fox formed a consortium to acquire Ansett Airlines after it had an Administrator appointed. They sought and obtained the exclusive right to negotiate to purchase the airline. They obtained the agreement of various stakeholders in the airline, including trade union members and their representatives. Greg Combet, the secretary of the ACTU said Lew had breached 'repeated commitments'. During this time spent negotiating, the administrators had been persuaded to continue to operate the airline despite heavy losses which reduced the amount ultimately available to creditors, which included employees owed entitlements. Lew and Fox had committed to take on 183 million of these entitlement obligations if they acquired the company. These commitments and their statements that they could and would proceed with the acquisition led the trade unions with members involved in the business to support the bid. The consequence of Lew's withdrawal was much embarrassment for the ACTU, which had strongly supported the Lew-Fox bid. ===Coles Myer board=== In September 2002, a resolution to remove Lew from the Board of Coles Myer was successful after Stan Wallis, the Chairman of the company, campaigned for Lew's removal. Wallis successfully lobbied major institutional shareholders, including insurance companies, banks and large investment firms to take the rare action of voting against an incumbent director. Prior to the vote, Lew campaigned heavily spending an estimated 10 million campaigning for his re-election focusing mainly on smaller shareholders. He was successful in obtaining millions of proxies but they were ultimately insufficient. ===Premier Investments and Just Group=== In March 2008, Lew returned to the public company stage, rejoining the board of the listed company Premier Investments, as its chairman. At the same time, Premier announced a takeover offer for Just Group, one of Australia's largest retailers which owns Just Jeans, Portmans, Dotti, Peter Alexander, Jay Jays, Smiggle and Jacqui E. Analysts criticised the offer for being too low and comprising less than half in cash. In publicly explaining his offer, Lew said Just Group was trading worse than had been disclosed to the investment community. Premier's stationery brand Smiggle was profitable in its first year in the United Kingdom after launching in 2015. The brand was subsequently launched in Hong Kong and Malaysia in 2016. Smiggle's first global flagship store was opened on London's Oxford Street in 2018, along with the first concession outlet in department store Selfridges. ==Personal life== Lew is Jewish and is a member of the Chabad House synagogue in Malvern, Victoria.The Age: \\"Synagogue row led to Lew rumble\\" by Cameron Houston 25 September 2011Sydney Morning Herald: \\"Fractured dynasty bids for privacy ‚Äì Solomon Lew is taking risky action to protect his family's fortune from the former partners of his children\\" by Cameron Houston 15 April 2012 He is separated from his wife Rosie.

ASA took over the Guinea Airways existing fleet of five DC-3s and an Auster, and added a 52-seat Convair 440 VH-BZH. From inception, ASA provided services from Adelaide to Port Lincoln, Minnipa, Ceduna, Cowell, Cleve, Kimba, Radium Hill, Broken Hill, Kangaroo Island, Port Pirie, Whyalla, Renmark, Mildura and Woomera. Throughout the 1960s, services were briefly added to Naracoorte, Millicent and tours to Hayman Island, Queensland from Adelaide while several initial services were progressively discontinued. A Piaggio P166 and a Fokker F-27 Friendship (the first of several) replaced older aircraft. In November 1968 Airlines of South Australia was renamed Ansett Airlines of SA (AASA). By 1973, the fleet had reduced to three Fokker F-27s. In the mid-1970s, AASA trialled special interest weekend flights and began services to Mount Gambier. In 1979, charter flights to the gas fields at Moomba began. In 1980, a route sharing agreement was commenced with Rossair, and in 1981 Ansett reverted AASA back to the original name Airlines of South Australia. However, ASA faced increasing competition through the late 1970s and early 1980s, and in 1985, Ansett announced that another subsidiary Kendell Airlines would progressively move onto South Australian routes. In February 1986, Ansett announced that ASA would cease operations by July. The last passenger flight was made to Whyalla in June 1986. === New entity (1987-2005) === ASA Embraer EMB-120 Airlines of South Australia (ASA) was reborn in 1987 as a small regional airline]. It operated scheduled between Adelaide, Port Lincoln, Port Augusta, and Kingscote all in South Australia, as well as charter flights. It was part of the RegionalLink Airlines group which also included Airnorth and Emu Airways. Its main base was Adelaide International Airport (ADL). Both ASA and Emu Airways ceased operations on 9 November 2005. The airline was established in 1987 as Lincoln Airlines (based in Port Lincoln). It merged with Augusta Airways (based in Port Augusta) and was renamed Airlines of South Australia (ASA) in 1997. In October 2003, Airnorth (based in Darwin, Northern Territory) purchased both Airlines of South Australia and Emu Airways (another small regional airline, based in Adelaide, operating from Adelaide to Kingscote) and merged the three companies into a single business entity called RegionalLink owned by aviation services company Capiteq Group. The participating airlines continued to trade in their local markets under their own names, the logos of which were featured on the fuselages of aircraft within the group. On Monday 31 October 2005 Capiteq Limited, the parent company of Airlines of South Australia and Emu Airways, announced its intention that both airlines would cease operations effective Wednesday 9 November 2005, citing the entry of QantasLink (soon to start flying to Port Lincoln and Kingscote) and other factors in their decision. This left Port Augusta with no scheduled air service.

Founded in 1897, Piedmont's Demorest campus includes 300 acres in a traditional residential-college setting located in the foothills of the northeast Georgia Blue Ridge mountains. Total enrollment is approximately 2,571 students and the campus includes ten dormitories housing more than 720 students. Piedmont College offers more than 50 undergraduate academic programs in the Schools of Arts & Sciences, Business, Education, and Nursing & Health Sciences. Students may earn Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Bachelor of Science (BS), or Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degrees. Graduate programs include Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Arts (MA) and Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT), Education Specialist (EdS), and Doctor of Education (EdD). ==History== The college opened as the J.S. Green Collegiate Institute in 1897, founded by residents of Habersham County, Georgia. The first president was Reverend Charles C. Spence. The American Mission Board of the New England Congregational Churches operated the college from 1901 to 1948 and changed the name to Piedmont College to represent the geographic region. In 1948, under president James Walter, the college became an independent institution, although it maintains an affiliation with the United Church of Christ (UCC) and the related National Association of Congregational Christian Churches (NACCC). Congregationalists took over the school from the Methodists in the early 20th century. In 1994 the college began to expand, adding schools for Business and Nursing & Health Sciences to its existing programs in the Arts and Sciences and Education. The college also opened a campus in Athens, Georgia, and began offering off-campus graduate education courses across the state. The Demorest campus grew substantially with the addition of the Arrendale Library; Stewart Center for Mathematics, Science and Technology; Swanson Center for Communications and the Performing Arts, Mize Athletic Center, the Smith-Williams Art Studios, and in 2015 the Student Commons. The college also added five new dormitories and 48 apartment- style residences. ==Campuses== Piedmont has two campuses, the original one in Demorest and the newer expansion in Athens. Piedmont's Demorest campus is located on roughly in Habersham County. The Athens campus is located on Prince Avenue near downtown Athens, on the site of the original Prince Avenue Baptist Church. ===Demorest=== Stewart Hall, one of Piedmont's classroom buildings, houses labs and classroom space for the mathematics and sciences departments. The Demorest campus is primarily a residential campus, with ten dormitories, including Getman-Babcock, Purcell, Wallace, Swanson, Johnson, Mayflower, New Bedford, Plymouth and Ipswich halls that together house about 600 students. The Piedmont Village (apartment-style living which opened in 2015) houses an additional 180 students. The academic buildings include Daniel Hall, which houses the R.H. Daniel School of Nursing, the Humanities Department, and administrative offices. Stewart Hall houses the Science and Math Departments. The School of Education is located in the Arrendale Library. The Walker School of Business is located in Camp Hall, which is adjacent to the President‚Äôs Home. The Music department is located in the Center for Worship and Music, which includes classroom and performance space, as well as the Sewell Pipe Organ, a 3,675-pipe organ built by the Casavant Fr√®res company of Saint- Hyacinthe, Quebec. The Art Department is located in the Smith-Williams Studios and adjacent Martens Hall. The Mason-Scharfenstein Museum of Art is located in downtown Demorest. It features a large permanent collection and hosts numerous exhibits throughout the year. The Mass Communications and Theatre Departments are located in the Swanson Center for Performing Arts and Communication, a $14-million building which features two theaters and editing rooms for print, video and web productions. Next door is the Arrendale Amphitheater, a 500-seat outdoor venue. WPCZ, the student-run radio station, is housed in the Swanson Center, along with the student-run TV station, PC60. The campus also includes Walker Fields for softball, soccer and lacrosse, as well as Loudermilk Baseball Stadium for baseball. The Johnny Mize Athletic Center houses the O‚ÄôNeal Cave Arena for basketball and volleyball. The Mize Center includes a museum featuring displays of Mize‚Äôs baseball memorabilia collected during his career at Piedmont and as a Hall of Fame player in the major leagues with the St. Louis Cardinals, New York Giants and New York Yankees. The pedestrian footbridge at Piedmont College connects to pieces of campus which are separated by Historic U.S. 441 Highway. There are also a few general purpose buildings. Lane Hall, which faces the quad, is the remodeled old gym, which houses the Student Success Center. There is also the President's House, the Admissions building and the pedestrian bridge which crosses Historic U.S. 441. The bridge was assembled off-site and lowered into place by crane, and was modeled after the Vanderbilt University 21st Avenue Pedestrian Bridge. The installation of the bridge was a joint project of the Georgia Department of Transportation, Piedmont College and the city of Demorest. Much of Piedmont's Demorest property is now wetlands. The wetlands area was once the site of Lake Demorest (from 1890-2008). The lake was drained due to an irreparable dam, and the property was turned into a wetlands for students and faculty to use in their studies. The heart of student life at Piedmont is the new Student Commons, which opened in the fall of 2015. The 58,000 square foot commons features the campus dining hall, fitness center (complete with a full-size basketball court with a walking track, a rock-climbing wall and a racquetball court), the official Piedmont College bookstore and a Starbucks cafe. The commons also is home to Student Services and has a state-of-the-art conference room and study rooms as well as staff offices. ===Athens=== The college opened a small outreach facility in 1996 and now occupies seven buildings near the heart of downtown Athens on Prince Avenue. The campus offers four-year undergraduate programs designed for both traditional and non-traditional students. For graduate students, there are programs in business (MBA), nursing (BSN and MSN), and education (MA, MAT, EDS, and EDD). The Athens campus includes Commons Hall, which houses the majority of classrooms and faculty offices, as well as a large assembly room and dining hall. The School of Business is located in Rogers Hall, and there is a large recreation center for intramural and fitness activities. Lane Hall on North Milledge Avenue houses the library and facilities for the School of Nursing and Health Sciences. ==Academics== The Swanson Center, built in 2007, is home to the Mass Communications Department and Performing Arts. Piedmont is accredited by the following organizations: Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS); National League of Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC); and the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP). ===Schools=== Piedmont College is composed of four schools: the School of Arts & Sciences, the School of Education, the Harry W. Walker School of Business, and the R.H. Daniel School of Nursing & Health Sciences. School of Arts and Sciences Students can take courses in nine departments that comprise the School of Arts and Sciences. These departments include: Art, Humanities, Interdisciplinary Studies, Mass Communications, Mathematics & Physics, Music, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, and Theatre. Through these departments, students can earn Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, and Bachelor of Science degrees. Harry W. Walker School of Business The Harry W. Walker School of Business received national accreditation in November 2007 from the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) for the undergraduate and graduate business programs at both Piedmont‚Äôs Demorest and Athens Campuses. Through the School of Business, students can earn a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Business Administration or a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree. The BA program includes concentrations in accounting, finance, general business, management, and marketing. The MBA program is a lock-step 12-course program that offers the convenience of evening courses and can be completed in as little as 18 months. School of Education The School of Education offers bachelor's degree programs in fields including Early Childhood, Middle Grades, Drama, Secondary, and Spanish education. Students can also earn Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) or Master of Arts (MA) degrees in a variety of areas. Beyond the master's degree, the school offers Education Specialist (EdS) and Doctor of Education (EdD) degree programs. Students from Piedmont College's Nursing Department participate in an annual disaster drill to practice their triage skills. The 2015 drill simulated a gas tank explosion. R.H. Daniel School of Nursing & Health Sciences The R.H. Daniel School of Nursing & Health Sciences offers the BSN degree for students preparing for initial licensure. Separate BSN tracks are also available for students who already hold RN or LPN degrees. ==Student life== In addition to clubs and service organizations, Piedmont offers creative outlets for singers, musicians, and actors. All students can be part of the 100-voice Piedmont Chorale, which performs several concerts each year. The Piedmont Singers is a 50-member ensemble of selected students that performs on campus and each year tours in the U.S. or abroad. Performance groups also include the 10-member Cantabile a cappella singers, Piedmont Camerata chamber ensemble, Wind Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, and String Ensemble. Students interested in theatre may join the Piedmont College Theatre and the Alpha Psi Omega theatre honor society, which together perform a succession of plays each year ranging from Shakespeare to children's theatre. Students interested in writing, photography, radio, television, and web production can also participate in a number of student-run organizations including the student newspaper and media channel, \\"The Roar\\" [formerly The Navigator]; the Yonahian yearbook, and student radio and TV stations. ===Magazine=== The first publication for the college was The Mountain Lantern, which was named for a common firefly in the surrounding area. The Lantern started out as a monthly magazine in 1912. In 1913, The Lantern became the college's yearbook. There would not be a magazine again until the spring semester of 2006, when a mass communications major published PC Magazine as her senior capstone project. In the fall of 2007, the magazine was renamed Pause, which came out twice each semester; two print and two online. Pause has since been out of production. ===Yearbook=== The Mountain Lantern lasted for only a short period until 1915. A yearbook was again issued in 1920, and the name was changed to the Yonahian. The odd-sounding name was derived from nearby Mount Yonah. Since 1920, the Yonahian has been published every year and provides a general record of students and faculty. ===Newspaper=== The first newspaper of Piedmont was The Hustler, which lasted from 1908 to 1909. There was no newspaper until 1917, when a bi-weekly newspaper named The Padded Hammer appeared in September. Later in 1917, after a vote on the name of the paper, it was changed to The Piedmont Owl. The name was chosen as a reference to the concept of wisdom. This became the name of Piedmont's athletic teams as well, until 1921, when the Student Association adopted the name Mountain Lions, later shortened to Lions. The Piedmont Owl lasted for 67 years until the name was changed to match Piedmont's newer mascot. The paper became The Lion's Roar for 21 years until 2005, when it was changed to The Navigator. The name is a reference to the Mayflower ship of the Pilgrims, honoring Piedmont's relationship to American Congregationalism. In the fall of 2015, all the college's media outlets were consolidated under the umbrella name of The Roar.The Roar ==Athletics== Piedmont College is an NCAA Division-III member school, home to 17 intercollegiate athletic programs. Piedmont College teams participate as a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III. The Lions are a member of the USA South Athletic Conference. Intercollegiate sports include men's and women's basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and track and field; women's volleyball and softball; and men's baseball. In 2016, Piedmont introduced men's and women's cycling. The college also offers a wide range of intramural sports competitions. Piedmont was a charter member of the Great South Athletic Conference (GSAC) until the 2012-13 school year. ==Notable peopleAlumni=== *Marvin Hudson (Class of 1986), baseball umpire of the 2004 All- Star Game and the 2005 National League Division Series as well as the 2016 World Series between the Cubs and Indians *Phillip M.

It was co-produced and engineered by the band and longtime associate Martin Birch. It was the final Deep Purple studio record prior to the band's initial disbandment in 1976, therefore making it the only album to feature Tommy Bolin, who replaced Ritchie Blackmore on guitar, and the final of three albums to feature David Coverdale on lead vocals and Glenn Hughes on bass, as none of the three would be involved with the reactivated Deep Purple in 1984. It is also the only studio album to involve neither Blackmore nor vocalist Ian Gillan, as every prior and subsequent album features at least one of the two. ==Release and reception== The album sold reasonably well upon release (#19 in the UK charts, and #43 in the US). The album was certified Silver on 1 November 1975 by the BPI, selling 60,000 copies in the UK. In recent years the album has received some critical reassessment \\"on its own merits\\", in part due to Bolin's contributions to the album. Gillan (who left the band just over two years prior), on the other hand, has stated that he does not view the album as a real Deep Purple album. Lord praised the quality of the album years later in interviews, stating that \\"listening to it now, it's a surprisingly good album,\\" while acknowledging, \\"the worst thing you can say about it is that, in most people's opinion, it's not a Deep Purple album.\\" Released on 25 October 2010, the 2-CD Deluxe 35th Anniversary edition includes the original album in remastered form plus a rare US single edit of \\"You Keep On Moving\\" on the first disc, and a full album remix and two unissued tracks on the second disc: \\"Same in LA\\" a three-minute out-take from the final release in 1975, and \\"Bolin/Paice Jam\\" a five-minute instrumental jam with Bolin and Ian Paice. After tours for this album concluded in March 1976, Deep Purple broke up for eight years. Tommy Bolin formed his own band that toured in support of Peter Frampton and Jeff Beck, but it was short-lived as he died of multiple drug intoxication in December, 1976. Morphine, cocaine, lidocaine and alcohol were all found in his system.Nick Talevski (2006). Knocking on Heaven's Door: Rock Obituaries p.42-43.

Kaiser class and the second U.S. Navy ship named for the Rappahannock River in Virginia, was laid down at Avondale Shipyard, Inc., at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 29 March 1992 and launched on 14 January 1995. She was one of only three of the eighteen Henry J. Kaiser-class ships ‚Äì the other two being and ‚Äì to be built with a double bottom in order to meet the requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Hull separation is at the sides and on the bottom, reducing her liquid cargo capacity by about from that of the 15 ships of her class without a double bottom. Rappahannock entered non- commissioned U.S. Navy service under the control of Military Sealift Command with a primarily civilian crew on 7 November 1995. ==Service history== Rappahannock serves in the United States Pacific Fleet. During Operation Tomodachi, Rappahannock delivered fuel, stores and humanitarian relief supplies to for transport to mainland Japan. Rappahannock then loaded diesel and aviation fuel at Sasebo, Japan, on 24 March before sailing for Gwangyang, South Korea, arriving 27 March. There, Rappahannock loaded 289 pallets of bottled water, which the ship delivered to Yokosuka, Japan, 30 March. Less than 24 hours later, the ship was underway again in the direction of Sendai. Rappahannock completed 10 underway replenishment missions delivering more than 2.4 million gallons of fuel. On 16 July 2012, the Rappahannock was involved in an incident in the Persian Gulf off the coast of Dubai with an Indian fishing boat that the US Navy Fifth Fleet claimed approached the ship despite several warnings. (This has been disputed by those on board the boat and by India's ambassador to the UAE). \\"An embarked security team aboard a U.S. Navy vessel fired upon a small motor vessel after it disregarded warnings and rapidly approached the U.S. ship,\\" Lt. Greg Raelson, media officer for U.S. Navy, said in an e-mailed statement. According to the Navy's Central Command Public Affairs, the Navy vessel followed its force protocol by first attempting to warn away the approaching craft with a series of non-lethal procedures using voice, radio, and lights. After those failed the Rappahannock escalated to lethal force, firing on the approaching vessel with a .50-caliber machine gun, killing an Indian fisherman on board and wounding three others. ==References== * ==External links== * * Category:Henry J.

Amalner city is still densely populated with Wipro shareholders. Azim Premji visited Amalner's Wipro plant on 12 February 2013, to address the employees of the company. There is a historical gate for the entrance in Amalner called \\"DAGDI DARWAJA\\". The famous philosopher and Vedic-Pandit \\"Nyayacharya Shriram Shastri Shankar Guru Upasani\\" was resident of Amalner. He was a gold medalist student of Varanasi Sangveda Vidyalaya. He had eminent knowledge of astrology, Sanskrit, philosophy, Vedanta, Brahmana, and Ayurveda, along with other subjects. Shri Shriram Shastri Upasani not only taught astrology and Sanskrit to academic students but also to many Jain Sadhus (from them many are now well known Sanskrit-astrology experts and book writers). The eminent knowledge of astrology is now continued by his son Pt. Vishweshwar Shastri Upasani. The northern part of Amalner is called \\"Pratapnagar\\", after Srimant Pratap Shethji, for whom the institutes Pratap College and Pratap high school are also named. Amalner is as regarded as 'Prati Pandharpur' in the Khandesh region, meaning \\"as holy as Pandharpur\\". Centuries ago, Saint Muktai resided in the district and made it a holy place. The great Shri Sant Sakharam Maharaj is from Amalner. Shri Sakharam Maharaj travels to Pandharpur every year in a procession called \\"Paai wari\\". This procession takes place in the month of Ashadh (Indian calendar). The honour of organising the first procession (dindi) to visit Lord Vitthal in Pandharpur goes to Amalner. In every Vaishakh month, there is a huge funfair, the biggest in the region, at the Bori river. At that time there is a Rath-Yatra at Vaishakh Ekadashi as well as a Palakhi at Pornima. As a mark of solidarity among communities, the first mogari (a wooden log used as a break for stopping Rath) is always placed by Muslims, and before Rath reaches its destination, Rath stops at a Mosque for Aarati and Dohe. Amalner is second to Pandharpur, in Maharashtra. Two visits to Amalner is as beneficial as one visit to Pandharpur. Saint Shree Sakharam Maharaj of Amalner was a devotee of Lord Vithal. To commemorate him, the Ashadhi Ekadashi celebrations take place at Amalner parallel to the celebrations at the magnificent temple of Lord Viththal in Pandharpur. It is famous for the Jain Temple of \\"Lord Chandraprabhu\\" who was 8th Thirthankar of Jain's and temple of \\"Kshetrapal Maharaj\\". It is believed that a visit to the temple on the day of Amavsya will lead to the fulfillment of all wishes. Another emerging place, Ratnapimpri, 11 km from Amalner and 7 km from Parola tahsil, is situated on the bank of the Gopi river where a famous Shivdham temple is located. And, 2 km away, Tapovan is situated, where farmers are experimenting with organic farming. It is emerging as a tourist and religious place for devotees as it is calm and peaceful, being located away from busy city life. There is a myth stating that people used to find pearls (Ratnna) at Ratnapimpri. Therefore, the town is known as 'Ratnapimpri'. Amalner hosts a weekly market on every Monday, and people from the surrounding area come for shopping. Amalner is also famous for handmade household equipment called ghamelas, made from brass and copper. Mandal, the biggest village in Amalner taluka, is situated on the bank of the Panzara river. It is located around 20 km from Amalner. Shirsale is the smallest village in Amalner taluka. It is located around 9 km from Amalner. It is famous for the Jain temple of \\"Lord Mahavir\\". Chandani kurhe is a small village in Amalner taluka. Kurhe khurd & Kurhe budruk are situated on each bank of the river Chikhali. In the village group grampachayat established on 17 March 1956. There are only two temples of Mangalgrah in India and worldwide, one at Kolkata and one at Amalner. The premises are well developed and have become a picnic spot. Another famous temple is \\"Shri Akkalkot Swami Samarth Kendra\\". Thousands of people visit this temple every day, and it is believed that it fulfills all wishes, having the power of the great Swami Samarth Maharaj.The temple of Swami Samarth Maharaj is situated near the Bus Stand of Amalner. There is a big gate for entering in the temple. The history of the name of Amalner is interesting and provides some important information. In 11th century Rishi Ambarishi prayed to the god Varun (the god of rain). Varun then built the temple of the god Shiv, called \\"Varuneshwar\\", which became famous in the area. Amabarishi then named the village Amalnir, which means \\"the village with pure water\\" or \\"where there is no mal (impurity) in water is Amalnir\\". Over time, the name changed to Amalner. The hill close to Amalner is called \\"Ambarishi Tekdi\\" where there is Fun fare in every monsoon. It is said that Ambarishi fulfills wishes of all who pray. Apart from Varuneshwar, there are two more shiv temples famous in Amalner, named Khaleshwar and Khateshwar Mahadev mandir, which is on the bank of the Bori River. Amalner is also famous for the industrial area (MIDC). Amalner is also famous for Mangal Grah Temple. There are very few such temples in world. It is the only 1 temple in maharashtra. ==Geography== Amalner is located at 18¬∞56‚Ä≤N 75¬∞20‚Ä≤E / 18.93¬∞N 75.33¬∞E / 18.93; 75.33[1]. It has an average elevation of 188 metres. It is 36 km from Dhule. ==Demographics== As of the Indian census of 2001, Amalner had a population of 91,456. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. The average literacy rate is 73%, higher than the national average of 59.5%, with 57% of the males and 43% of females being literate. Some 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. ==Education== Amalner has seen ups and downs in the educational field, just as in the industrial field. Pratap Shethji founded a well-known school and a college in Amalner, both of which were named after him: Pratap High School and Pratap College. Shri Sane Guruji served in Pratap High School as teacher. Pratap College once had the largest library in Maharashtra and hosted thousands of books. Pratap college has CGPA 3.52 Grade A+. The Pratap college campus area is about 40Acres. Pratap Shethji founded \\"‡§§‡§§‡•ç‡§µ‡§¶‡•ç‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§® ‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§¶‡§ø‡§∞\\" (Philosophy Hall) in 1966, which hosted books on the subject of philosophy. Earlier in India, the study of philosophy was based on western philosophy only. This hall gave an opportunity to bring traditional books based on Dharmashastra under one roof. Pratap College, Amalner now affiliated to North Maharashtra University, earlier was part of University of Pune and has produced many rank holders, scientist. The Khandesh Education Society manages the day-to-day operations of these institutes, as well as Khandesh Education Society's College of Pharmacy (For D-Pharmacy). ;English Medium School *PBA English Medium School *Shri N.T.Mundada Global View School *ST.MARY ENGLISH MEDIUM HIGH SCHOOL *Swami Vivekananda International School (CBSE) ;Marathi Medium Schools *(G.S) Gangaram Sakharam HighSchool * D.R.

The rail junction of West Point was one of the two Chattahoochee River crossings, which General James H. Wilson planned to destroy after capturing Montgomery, Alabama. Dividing his army, he detailed Colonel Oscar Hugh La Grange to attack West Point, while he himself moved downriver to the manufacturing center of Columbus. West Point was fortified by the earthwork of Fort Tyler, commanded by Confederate Brig. Gen. Robert C. Tyler, for whom it was named. Union artillery and dismounted cavalry, armed with Spencer repeater-carbines, soon forced the garrison to surrender, Tyler being shot dead by a sniper, and becoming the last Confederate General killed. On hearing of the victory at Columbus, Union troops were free to burn the bridge and the railroad stock. It was one of the last battles of the war. ==Prelude== After defeating Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest's defenders at Selma on April 2, 1865, and capturing Montgomery, Alabama, on April 12, U.S. Brig. Gen. Wilson turned his raiders' attentions toward the Chattahoochee River to the east. He telegraphed Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas:Jones, James Pickett Yankee Blitzkrieg: Wilson's Raid through Alabama and Georgia. University Press of Kentucky, 1976, pp 118‚Äì119. > If I can now destroy arsenals and supplies at Columbus and divide their army > in the southwest, they must disintegrate for lack of munitions. There is no > force to resist me, and I see no reasonable ground for fearing failures. My > command is in magnificent condition. The river was swollen by rains, so capturing a bridge would be required to make swift progress. Wilson determined that either one of two locations with bridges would suit this purpose: the one at West Point or the more heavily defended one at Columbus. The two towns were only 35 miles apart and Wilson divided his force to attack both, in order to increase the chances of one being taken intact. Colonel Oscar Hugh La Grange's brigade was detailed to attack West Point.Jones, pp. 118, 121‚Äì2Cox, Dale. \\"Fort Tyler Historic Site ‚Äì West Point, Georgia.\\" Accessed January 25, 2013. http://www.exploresouthernhistory.com/forttyler.html. West Point did not have mills or foundries, but it was a critical rail center. As the connecting point for two railroads of different gauges, West Point had an extensive rail yard with many locomotives and rail cars.Jones, p. 122 The railway bridges were commanded by Fort Tyler, a 35-yard square earthwork upon a hill on the Alabama side of the river. It had walls four-and-a-half feet high, surrounded by a ditch six to ten feet deep and seven to twelve feet across. The fort was equipped with a 32-pounder siege gun and two 12-pounder field pieces. ==Battle== On the morning of April 16, La Grange's brigade approached West Point. The brigade consisted of the 2nd and 4th Indiana Cavalry, the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry, the 7th Kentucky Cavalry, and the 18th Indiana Battery of light artillery. The cavalry troopers were armed primarily with Spencer carbines.Sanders, Stuart. \\"Robert Charles Tyler: Last American Civil War Confederate General Slain in Combat.\\" Weider History Group ‚Äì Historynet, June 12, 2006. http://www.historynet.com/robert-charles-tyler-last-american-civil- war-confederate-general-slain-in-combat.htm. Awaiting them at Fort Tyler was a small group of Confederates, somewhere between 120 and 265 men,Jones, p. 123 under the command of Brig. Gen. Robert C. Tyler. In addition to the three cannon of the fort, the convalescents and militia were armed with smoothbore muskets. Skirmishing began at 10 a.m., as the fort's pickets were driven in. The Federal battery set up half a mile away on Ward's Hill and began shelling the redoubt while cavalrymen dismounted to serve as skirmishers and invest the fort. Shelling continued until 1:30 p.m. when La Grange arrived with the remainder of the brigade. The dismounted cavalry pressed the fort and exchanged fire with the defenders, closing within 50 yards and sniping at the defending artillerists. The Federals also removed long planks from nearby structures in preparation to span the ditch. As the Federals sniped at the Confederate artillerists attempting to man their pieces, Col. La Grange hoped to use the distraction to secure his primary objective, the bridge span, before it could be burned by the rebels. He led the 4th Indiana Cavalry on a mad dash for the bridge. Seeing this the defenders in the fort turned their cannon to halt the foray, but as the cavalry approached the bridge they soon exceeded the effective range of the cannon. An exploding shell from the 32-pounder did succeed in killing the colonel's horse, two pack animals and resulting in the colonel being stunned and sprawled on the ground. Charging across the bridge the riders encountered a gap where planks had been removed, but were able to spur their horses over and overcome the Confederate defenders on the east side of the Chattahoochee River. Here they dispersed a small defensive force that had incendiaries for burning the structure.Jones, pp. 123‚Äì124 With the defenders pinned inside their fort, Federal artillery and sniper fire suppressed the counter fire of the defenders who lacked protection from headlogs. As a result, many of the Confederate killed and wounded suffered head wounds. The garrison commander's attention was drawn to fire from nearby structures, which Tyler had been urged to burn before the engagement, but had spared because he did not believe the owners could withstand the loss. According to a participant Tyler bravely exposed himself to examine the battlefield and was quickly shot dead by a sniper who was operating from a nearby cottage.Lenz, Richard. \\"The Battle of Fort Tyler.\\" In The Civil War in Georgia, An Illustrated Traveler's Guide. Lenz Design & Communications Inc, 1995. http://www.sherpaguides.com/georgia/civil_war/sidebars/battle_of_fort_tyler.html. Shortly thereafter, his second-in-command, Captain Celestino GonzalezFind a grave for Capt. Celestino Gonzales of 1st FL Inf was also killed and Col. James H. Fannin assumed command. To end the stalemate the dismounted troopers crossed the ditch using their planks. Running low on ammunition, some defenders threw rocks and lit shells over the parapet. A cavalry bugle sounded a final charge as the Union soldiers stormed over the embankment, and the fort immediately surrendered. Brig. Gen. Robert Tyler, last Confederate genera to be killed in the war ==Casualties== Union casualties were seven men killed and twenty-nine wounded. The Confederates' losses were nineteen killed, twenty- eight wounded, and two hundred eighteen captured. The death of Brigadier General Tyler is noted as the last Confederate general to die in a battle. The Confederates who died were buried in what is now known as the Fort Tyler Cemetery in town on the east side of the river. It is believed but not confirmed that the Union dead were buried there as well. In addition, at least 50 other unknown Civil War soldiers are interred there.Cox, Dale \\"Fort Tyler Cemetery ‚Äì West Point, Georgia\\" ==Significance== The rolling stock of the Montgomery and West Point Railroad, along with commissary stores had been sent to West Point before Montgomery fell. Because of their narrow gauge, these trains were trapped.Black, p. 288 After the fort surrendered, Federal cavalry took control of the town of West Point and the vital bridges over the river. The raiders then proceeded to burn the entire rolling stock of the railroad, 19‚Äì20 locomotives and 340‚Äì350 cars.Jones, p. 125 Before the cars were fired, some foodstuffs were removed and given to the mayor of West Point to feed the wounded of both sides as well as destitute citizens. The bridges were spared only briefly, as La Grange awaited word of the attack on Columbus to know if they would be needed. ==NotesReferences== * Black, Robert C., III.

His parents were Ferdinando Carlo, nobleman of Poreƒç and Vis, and Giovanna Parich (Pariƒá, Periƒá), noble of Republic of Dubrovnik. Because of his mixed Italian-Croatian ancestry, his family was at different times also known as Vukiƒá, a Croatianized variant of the name Lupis (both meaning \\"wolf\\"), and he himself is occasionally referred to as Ivan Vukiƒá, especially by Croatians.Luppis was descended from a branch of the Italian noble family of Lupis, which migrated into Dalmatia from Giovinazzo, in Apulia. This branch moved first to the Republic of Dubrovnik and then to the peninsula of Pelje≈°ac in Croatia), where it Slavicized the name into Vuk, Vukiƒá, or Vuka≈°inovic (another adaptation of lupus, meaning \\"wolf\\"). When, in the 17th century, one of his ancestors moved to Rijeka, he Italianized his name back into Luppis. See: Giovanni Luppis family in the Libro d'Oro della Nobilt√† Italiana scanned version here; also: History of the de Lupis Family (in Italian) and Giovanni Luppis genealogy In the city of Fiume, Giovanni Luppis's family has been powerful shipowners.Giovanni Luppis genealogy Luppis attended a gymnasium in Fiume and the Collegio di marina, the Austrian naval academy in Venice. Then he married a noblewoman, the Baroness Elisa de Zotti. He served in the Venezianisch-√ñsterreichische Kriegsmarine (after 1849 K.u.K Kriegsmarinehttps://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/kukmarine/offiziere.html&date;=2009-10-26+01:33:25 ) and rose up the ranks to the position of Frigate Captain (Fregattenkapitan). In 1848/1849 he was an officer on the ships that blockaded Venice.La Voce del Popolo (Fiume), Sabato 3 marzo 2007: Storia del silurificio di Fiume e biografia di Giovanni Luppis (pp.6-7) ==The \\"Salvacoste\\" (Coastsaver)== About the middle in the 18th century, an officer of the Austrian Marine Artillery conceived the idea of employing a small boat carrying a large charge of explosives, powered by a steam or an air engine and remotely steered by cable to be used against enemy ships. Upon his death, before he had perfected his invention or made it public, the papers of this anonymous officer came into the possession of Capt. Giovanni Luppis. Bust of the Baron Captain Giovanni Luppis von Rammer in the Family Palace in Italy He envisioned a floating device for destroying ships that would be unmanned and controlled from land, while the explosive charges would detonate at the moment of impact. His first prototype was one metre long, had glass wings, and was controlled via long ropes from the coast. It didn't succeed due to it being too cumbersome. The second model was built with a clock mechanism as the engine for the propeller. The explosives were in the stern and were ignited through a pistol-like control, which in turn was activated through the bow, the sides or the mast. It had two rudders: one turned to the right, the other to the left, that were moved by ropes/wires from land. After numerous experiments, this design, marked '6 m', finally performed but not well enough. He nicknamed it 'Salvacoste', Italian for \\"Coastsaver\\".1st international Conference on the occasion of 150th anniversary of the Whitehead torpedo factory in Fiume and preservation of industrial heritage In 1860, after Luppis had retired from the Navy, he managed to demonstrate the '6 m' design to the Emperor Franz Joseph, but the naval commission refused to accept it without better propulsion and control systems. ==The meeting with Robert Whitehead== In Fiume in 1864, the future mayor Giovanni de Ciotta introduced Luppis to the British machine engineer Robert Whitehead, manager of the local factory \\"Stabilimento Tecnico Fiumano\\", with whom he signed a contract to develop the 'salvacoste' further. After looking at Luppis's previous efforts Whitehead built a model but decided that the idea was not viable. Whitehead then significantly altered the previous designs and started to think about the problem of setting off explosive charges remotely below a ship's waterline, this being far more effective than above-water bombardment. Whitehead then made a device running under water and installed an engine running on compressed air, as well as automatic guidances for the depth and direction. On 21 December 1866 the first automobile torpedo, now named Minenschiff, was officially demonstrated in front of the Austro-Hungarian State Naval Commission for evaluation. This model was 355 mm in diameter and 3.35 m in length, weighing 136 kg with 8 kg of explosives. The naval commission accepted it, and subsequently on 6 March 1867 the government contracted the inventors for a test production and agreed to pay all the production costs. Whitehead retained the copyrights and even negotiated a new contract with Luppis. This however gave Whitehead full control of all future sales. On 27 May 1867, the navy paid 200,000 forints in royalties to the inventor (Fiume being located in the Hungarian part of the Empire). The invention was generally regarded as a promising one, but in the first years of production there were not enough orders, so \\"Stabilimento\\" went through a crisis and went bankrupt in 1873. Whitehead then took it over and at the beginning of 1875 transformed it into a private company called 'Torpedo- Fabrik von Robert Whitehead'. Giovanni Luppis was given the noble title of Baron von Rammer ('the sinker') by Kaiser Franz Josef on 1 August 1869. He died in the borough (frazione) of Torriggia, in the municipality of Laglio, near Como on 11 January 1875. ==Further reading== * Gray, Edwin.

Launched as SS Fort Necessity on 28 February 1943 by the Sun Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., Chester, Pennsylvania, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. W. Taylor; acquired by the Navy on 17 March 1943; and commissioned on 20 April 1943 Commander P. G. Beck, USNR, in command. It was named for a river in Arkansas. ==World War II== Sailing from Norfolk to Baytown, Texas, to load kerosene, gasoline, and fuel oil in July 1943, Cossatot sailed from Norfolk on 6 August to fuel convoy escorts during their passage to Casablanca, returning to Norfolk on 14 September. She made seven such voyages from Norfolk to the North African ports of Casablanca, Oran, and Bizerte between 4 October 1943 and 30 November 1944. Cossatot put to sea from Norfolk again on 28 December 1944 bound for the Pacific. She loaded diesel oil, fuel oil, and gasoline at Aruba, Netherlands West Indies, and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 30 January 1943. She operated from Saipan from 12 February fueling ships of the 6th Fleet until 3 March, when she began operations from Ulithi. Cossatot sortied as a part of TG 60.8, the logistics group for the 6th Fleet, for operations off Iwo Jima from 13 March to 12 April. On 16 April she sailed with her group to conduct fueling operations off newly assaulted Okinawa. On 28 April she downed a suicide plane as it dove toward her, and remained on this duty unscathed until 4 May when she arrived at Ulithi to reload. From 26 May until the end of the War, Cossatot operated out of Ulithi fueling various units of fast carrier TF 38, engaged in the final strikes against the Japanese homeland. Cossatot left Ulithi on 3 September for Okinawa and Sasebo, arriving on 21 September to fuel ships of the occupation force. On 12 November she sailed from Yokosuka for San Francisco, arriving on 26 November. Cossatot received two battle stars for World War II service. ==Post-war== Cossatot was placed out of commission in reserve 7 March 1946 and transferred to the Maritime Commission on 28 October 1946. Reacquired in February 1948, she was transferred to the Military Sea Transportation Service on 1 October 1949 where she has served in a noncommissioned status under the Maritime Administration. While underway in the Pacific Ocean on 16 April 1963 Cossatot reported seeing an unidentified flying object on a straight and fast course in the skies. It was described as glowing, and star-like, and on a trajectory at about 20 degrees and an altitude around . No investigation was put forward. On 15 June 1968 Cossatot was damaged after a collision with the merchant vessel Copper State, in fog, off the coast of Santa Cruz, California. Cossatot was carrying of jet fuel and lost of her bow section in this collision. Cossatot was stricken on 18 September 1974 and sold 2 September 1975. Beginning in September 1975, Cossatot was broken up by Luria Bros & Co Inc. ==NotesReferences== * * ==External links== * The T2 Tanker Page *Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture entry Category:Suamico-class oilers Category:Type T2-SE-A1 tankers of the United States Navy Category:1943 ships Category:Ships built by the Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Company Category:World War II tankers of the United States Category:Maritime incidents in 1968 ","title":"USS Cossatot (AO-77)"},{"id":"2229292","text":"15 partitions of a 4-element set ordered in a Hasse diagram There are S(4,1), ..., S(4, 4) = 1, 7, 6, 1 partitions containing 1, 2, 3, 4 sets. In mathematics, particularly in combinatorics, a Stirling number of the second kind (or Stirling partition number) is the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k non-empty subsets and is denoted by S(n,k) or \\\\textstyle \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n\\\\atop k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}.Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth, Oren Patashnik (1988) Concrete Mathematics, Addison‚ÄìWesley, Reading MA. , p. 244. Stirling numbers of the second kind occur in the field of mathematics called combinatorics and the study of partitions. Stirling numbers of the second kind are one of two kinds of Stirling numbers, the other kind being called Stirling numbers of the first kind (or Stirling cycle numbers). Mutually inverse (finite or infinite) triangular matrices can be formed from the Stirling numbers of each kind according to the parameters n, k. ==Definition== The Stirling numbers of the second kind, written S(n,k) or \\\\lbrace\\\\textstyle{n\\\\atop k}\\\\rbrace or with other notations, count the number of ways to partition a set of n labelled objects into k nonempty unlabelled subsets. Equivalently, they count the number of different equivalence relations with precisely k equivalence classes that can be defined on an n element set. In fact, there is a bijection between the set of partitions and the set of equivalence relations on a given set. Obviously, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop n} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} = 1 and for n \\\\geq 1, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop 1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = 1 as the only way to partition an n-element set into n parts is to put each element of the set into its own part, and the only way to partition a nonempty set into one part is to put all of the elements in the same part. They can be calculated using the following explicit formula: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{k!}\\\\sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^{i} \\\\binom{k}{i} (k-i)^n. The Stirling numbers of the second kind may also be characterized as the numbers that arise when one expresses powers of an indeterminate x in terms of the falling factorialsConfusingly, the notation that combinatorialists use for falling factorials coincides with the notation used in special functions for rising factorials; see Pochhammer symbol. :(x)_n=x(x-1)(x-2)\\\\cdots(x-n+1) . (In particular, (x)0 = 1 because it is an empty product.) In particular, one has :\\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}(x)_k=x^n. ==Notation== Various notations have been used for Stirling numbers of the second kind. The brace notation \\\\textstyle \\\\lbrace{n\\\\atop k}\\\\rbrace was used by Imanuel Marx and Antonio Salmeri in 1962 for variants of these numbers.Transformation of Series by a Variant of Stirling's Numbers, Imanuel Marx, The American Mathematical Monthly 69, #6 (June‚ÄìJuly 1962), pp. 530‚Äì532, .Antonio Salmeri, Introduzione alla teoria dei coefficienti fattoriali, Giornale di Matematiche di Battaglini 90 (1962), pp. 44‚Äì54.

The notation S(n, k) was used by Richard Stanley in his book Enumerative Combinatorics. ==Relation to Bell numbers== Since the Stirling number \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} counts set partitions of an n-element set into k parts, the sum :B_n=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} over all values of k is the total number of partitions of a set with n members. This number is known as the nth Bell number. Analogously, the ordered Bell numbers can be computed from the Stirling numbers of the second kind via :a_n = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n k! \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. ==Table of values== Below is a triangular array of values for the Stirling numbers of the second kind : { style=\\"text- align:right;\\"  - ! !  0 !  1 !  2 !  3 !  4 !  5 !  6 !  7 !  8 !  9 !  10 - !  0  1 - !  1  0  1 - !  2  0  1  1 - !  3  0  1  3  1 - !  4  0  1  7  6  1 - !  5  0  1  15  25  10  1 - !  6  0  1  31  90  65  15  1 - !  7  0  1  63  301  350  140  21  1 - !  8  0  1  127  966  1701  1050  266  28  1 - !  9  0  1  255  3025  7770  6951  2646  462  36  1 - !  10  0  1  511  9330  34105  42525  22827  5880  750  45  1 - } As with the binomial coefficients, this table could be extended to , but those entries would all be 0\\\\. == Properties Recurrence relation=== Stirling numbers of the second kind obey the recurrence relation :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n+1\\\\atop k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = k \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{ n \\\\atop k }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} + \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n\\\\atop k-1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} for k > 0 with initial conditions :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{{ 0 \\\\atop 0 }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = 1 \\\\quad \\\\mbox{ and } \\\\quad \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{ n \\\\atop 0 }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{ 0 \\\\atop n }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = 0 for n > 0. For instance, the number 25 in column k=3 and row n=5 is given by 25=7+(3√ó6), where 7 is the number above and to the left of 25, 6 is the number above 25 and 3 is the column containing the 6. To understand this recurrence, observe that a partition of the objects into k nonempty subsets either contains the -th object as a singleton or it does not. The number of ways that the singleton is one of the subsets is given by :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{{ n \\\\atop k-1 }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} since we must partition the remaining objects into the available subsets. In the other case the -th object belongs to a subset containing other objects. The number of ways is given by :k \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{ n \\\\atop k }\\\\right\\\\\\\\} since we partition all objects other than the -th into k subsets, and then we are left with k choices for inserting object . Summing these two values gives the desired result. Some more recurrences are as follows: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n+1\\\\atop k+1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\sum_{j=k}^n {n \\\\choose j} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{ j \\\\atop k }\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n+1\\\\atop k+1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\sum_{j=k}^n (k+1)^{n-j} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{j \\\\atop k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} , :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n+k+1 \\\\atop k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\sum_{j=0}^k j \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{ n+j \\\\atop j }\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. ===Lower and upper bounds=== If n \\\\geq 2 and 1 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n-1, then :L(n,k) \\\\leq \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n \\\\atop k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\leq U(n,k) where :L(n,k) = \\\\frac{1}{2}(k^2+k+2)k^{n-k-1}-1 and :U(n,k) = \\\\frac{1}{2}{n \\\\choose k} k^{n-k}. ===Maximum=== For fixed n, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n \\\\atop k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} has a single maximum, which is attained for at most two consecutive values of k. That is, there is an integer K_n such that :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n \\\\atop 1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} < \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n \\\\atop 2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} < \\\\cdots < \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n \\\\atop K_n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n \\\\atop K_n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\geq \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n \\\\atop K_n+1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} > \\\\cdots > \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n \\\\atop n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. When n is large :K_n \\\\sim \\\\frac{n}{\\\\log n}, and the maximum value of the Stirling number of second kind is :\\\\log \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n \\\\atop K_n}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = n\\\\log n - n \\\\log\\\\log n - n + O(n \\\\log\\\\log n / \\\\log n). ===Parity=== Parity of Stirling numbers of the second kind. The parity of a Stirling number of the second kind is equal to the parity of a related binomial coefficient: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n\\\\atop k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\equiv \\\\binom{z}{w}\\\\ \\\\pmod{2}, where z = n - \\\\left\\\\lceil\\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{k + 1}{2}\\\\right\\\\rceil,\\\\ w = \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\displaystyle\\\\frac{k - 1}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor. This relation is specified by mapping n and k coordinates onto the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle. More directly, let two sets contain positions of 1's in binary representations of results of respective expressions: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbb{A}:\\\\ \\\\sum_{i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{A}} 2^i &= n-k,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbb{B}:\\\\ \\\\sum_{j\\\\in\\\\mathbb{B}} 2^j &= \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\dfrac{k - 1}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor.\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} One can mimic a bitwise AND operation by intersecting these two sets: : \\\\begin{Bmatrix}n\\\\\\\\\\\\k\\\\end{Bmatrix}\\\\,\\\\bmod\\\\,2 = \\\\begin{cases} 0, & \\\\mathbb{A}\\\\cap\\\\mathbb{B} e\\\\empty;\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1, & \\\\mathbb{A}\\\\cap\\\\mathbb{B}=\\\\empty; \\\\end{cases} to obtain the parity of a Stirling number of the second kind in O(1) time. In pseudocode: : \\\\begin{Bmatrix}n\\\\\\\\\\\\k\\\\end{Bmatrix}\\\\,\\\\bmod\\\\,2 := \\\\left[\\\\left( \\\\left(n-k\\\\right)\\\\ \\\\And\\\\ \\\\left( \\\\left(k-1\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{div}\\\\,2 \\\\right)\\\\right) = 0\\\\right]; where \\\\left[b\\\\right] is the Iverson bracket. ===Simple identities=== Some simple identities include :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop n-1}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\binom{n}{2}. This is because dividing n elements into sets necessarily means dividing it into one set of size 2 and sets of size 1. Therefore we need only pick those two elements; and :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop 2}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = 2^{n-1}-1. To see this, first note that there are 2 ordered pairs of complementary subsets A and B. In one case, A is empty, and in another B is empty, so ordered pairs of subsets remain. Finally, since we want unordered pairs rather than ordered pairs we divide this last number by 2, giving the result above. Another explicit expansion of the recurrence-relation gives identities in the spirit of the above example. : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop 2} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} & = \\\\frac{ \\\\frac11 (2^{n-1}-1^{n-1}) }{0!} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop 3} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} & = \\\\frac{ \\\\frac11 (3^{n-1}-2^{n-1})- \\\\frac12 (3^{n-1}-1^{n-1}) }{1!} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop 4} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} & = \\\\frac{ \\\\frac11 (4^{n-1}-3^{n-1})- \\\\frac22 (4^{n-1}-2^{n-1}) + \\\\frac13 (4^{n-1}-1^{n-1})}{2!} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop 5} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} & = \\\\frac{ \\\\frac11 (5^{n-1}-4^{n-1})- \\\\frac32 (5^{n-1}-3^{n-1}) + \\\\frac33 (5^{n-1}-2^{n-1}) - \\\\frac14 (5^{n-1}-1^{n-1}) }{3!} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & {}\\\\ \\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\end{align} These examples can be summarized by the recurrence : \\\\left\\\\lbrace\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right\\\\rbrace = \\\\frac{k^n}{k!}-\\\\sum_{r=1}^{k-1} \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\lbrace\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ r\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right\\\\rbrace}{(k-r)!}. ===Explicit formula=== The Stirling numbers of the second kind are given by the explicit formula: :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} =\\\\sum_{j=1}^k (-1)^{k-j} \\\\frac{j^{n-1}}{(j-1)!(k-j)!} =\\\\frac{1}{k!}\\\\sum_{j=0}^{k}(-1)^{k-j}{k \\\\choose j} j^n . This can be derived by using inclusion-exclusion to count the number of surjections from n to k and using the fact that the number of such surjections is k! \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} . Additionally, this formula is a special case of the kth forward difference of the monomial x^n evaluated at x = 0: : \\\\Delta^k x^n = \\\\sum_{j=0}^{k}(-1)^{k-j}{k \\\\choose j} (x+j)^n. Because the Bernoulli polynomials may be written in terms of these forward differences, one immediately obtains a relation in the Bernoulli numbers: :B_m(0)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^m \\\\frac {(-1)^k k!}{k+1} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {m \\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. ===Generating functions=== For a fixed integer n, the ordinary generating function for the Stirling numbers of the second kind \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n\\\\atop 0} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n\\\\atop 1} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\ldots is given by : \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n\\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} x^k = T_n(x), where T_n(x) are Touchard polynomials. If one sums the Stirling numbers against the falling factorial instead, one can show the following identities, among others: : \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n\\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} (x)_k = x^n and : \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n+1 \\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} (x-1)_{k-1} = x^n. For a fixed integer k, the Stirling numbers of the second kind \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {0\\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {1\\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, \\\\ldots have rational ordinary generating function :\\\\sum_{n=k}^\\\\infty \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n\\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} x^{n - k} = \\\\prod_{r=1}^k \\\\frac{1}{1-rx} = \\\\frac{1}{(k+1)! x^{k + 1} \\\\binom{\\\\frac{1}{x}}{k+1}} and have exponential generating function given by : \\\\sum_{n=k}^\\\\infty \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\frac{x^n}{n!} = \\\\frac{(e^x-1)^k}{k!}. A mixed bivariate generating function for the Stirling numbers of the second kind is : \\\\sum_{0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\frac{x^n}{n!} y^k = e^{y(e^x-1)}. ===Asymptotic approximation=== For fixed value of k, the asymptotic value of the Stirling numbers of the second kind as n\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty is given by : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n \\\\atop k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\sim \\\\frac{k^n}{k!}. On the other side, if k = o(\\\\sqrt{n}) (where o denotes the little o notation) then : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n \\\\atop n-k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\sim \\\\frac{(n-k)^{2k}}{2^k k!} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\frac{2 k^2 + k}{n-k} + \\\\frac{1}{18} \\\\frac{4k^4-k^2-3k}{(n-k)^2} + \\\\cdots \\\\right).L. C. Hsu, Note on an Asymptotic Expansion of the nth Difference of Zero, AMS Vol.19 NO.2 1948, pp. 273--277 A uniformly valid approximation also exists: for all such that , one has : \\\\left\\\\\\\\{{n \\\\atop k}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\sim \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{v-1}{v(1-G)}} \\\\left(\\\\frac{v-1}{v-G}\\\\right)^{n-k} \\\\frac{k^n}{n^k} e^{k(1-G)} \\\\left({n \\\\atop k}\\\\right), where G = - W_0(-v e^{-v}), v=n/k , and W_0(z) is the main branch of the Lambert W function.N. M. Temme, Asymptotic Estimates of Stirling Numbers, STUDIES IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS 89:233-243 (1993), Elsevier Science Publishing. Relative error is bounded by about 0.066/n . ==ApplicationsMoments of the Poisson distribution=== If X is a random variable with a Poisson distribution with expected value Œª, then its nth moment is :E(X^n)=\\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\lambda^k. In particular, the nth moment of the Poisson distribution with expected value 1 is precisely the number of partitions of a set of size n, i.e., it is the nth Bell number (this fact is Dobi≈Ñski's formula). ===Moments of fixed points of random permutations=== Let the random variable X be the number of fixed points of a uniformly distributed random permutation of a finite set of size m. Then the nth moment of X is :E(X^n) = \\\\sum_{k=1}^m \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {n \\\\atop k} \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Note: The upper bound of summation is m, not n. In other words, the nth moment of this probability distribution is the number of partitions of a set of size n into no more than m parts. This is proved in the article on random permutation statistics, although the notation is a bit different. ===Rhyming schemes=== The Stirling numbers of the second kind can represent the total number of rhyme schemes for a poem of n lines. S(n,k) gives the number of possible rhyming schemes for n lines using k unique rhyming syllables. As an example, for a poem of 3 lines, there is 1 rhyme scheme using just one rhyme (aaa), 3 rhyme schemes using two rhymes (aab, aba, abb), and 1 rhyme scheme using three rhymes (abc). ==VariantsAssociated Stirling numbers of the second kind=== An r-associated Stirling number of the second kind is the number of ways to partition a set of n objects into k subsets, with each subset containing at least r elements.L. Comtet, Advanced Combinatorics, Reidel, 1974, p. 222. It is denoted by S_r(n,k) and obeys the recurrence relation :S_r(n+1, k)=k\\\\ S_r(n, k)+\\\\binom{n}{r-1}S_r(n-r+1, k-1) The 2-associated numbers appear elsewhere as \\"Ward numbers\\" and as the magnitudes of the coefficients of Mahler polynomials. ===Reduced Stirling numbers of the second kind=== Denote the n objects to partition by the integers 1, 2, ..., n. Define the reduced Stirling numbers of the second kind, denoted S^d(n, k), to be the number of ways to partition the integers 1, 2, ..., n into k nonempty subsets such that all elements in each subset have pairwise distance at least d. That is, for any integers i and j in a given subset, it is required that i-j \\\\geq d. It has been shown that these numbers satisfy :S^d(n, k) = S(n-d+1, k-d+1), n \\\\geq k \\\\geq d (hence the name \\"reduced\\").A. Mohr and T.D. Porter, Applications of Chromatic Polynomials Involving Stirling Numbers, Journal of Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing 70 (2009), 57‚Äì64. Observe (both by definition and by the reduction formula), that S^1(n, k) = S(n, k), the familiar Stirling numbers of the second kind. ==See also== * Bell number - the number of partitions of a set with n members * Stirling numbers of the first kind * Stirling polynomials * Twelvefold way * 20px Partition related number triangles ==References== * . * . * * Calculator for Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind * Set Partitions: Stirling Numbers * Category:Permutations Category:Factorial and binomial topics Category:Triangles of numbers pl:Liczby Stirlinga#Liczby Stirlinga II rodzaju ","title":"Stirling numbers of the second kind"},{"id":"2229296","text":"In mathematics, especially in combinatorics, Stirling numbers of the first kind arise in the study of permutations. In particular, the Stirling numbers of the first kind count permutations according to their number of cycles (counting fixed points as cycles of length one). (The Stirling numbers of the first and second kind can be understood as inverses of one another when viewed as triangular matrices. This article is devoted to specifics of Stirling numbers of the first kind. Identities linking the two kinds appear in the article on Stirling numbers in general.) ==Definitions== The original definition of Stirling numbers of the first kind was algebraic: they are the coefficients s(n, k) in the expansion of the falling factorial :(x)_n = x(x-1)(x-2)\\\\cdots(x-n+1) into powers of the variable x: :(x)_n = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n s(n,k) x^k, For example, (x)_3 = x(x - 1)(x - 2) = 1 \\\\cdot x^3 - 3 \\\\cdot x^2 + 2 \\\\cdot x, leading to the values s(3, 3) = 1, s(3, 2) = -3, and s(3, 1) = 2. Subsequently, it was discovered that the absolute values s(n, k) of these numbers are equal to the number of permutations of certain kinds. These absolute values, which are known as unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind, are often denoted c(n,k) or \\\\left[{n\\\\atop k}\\\\right]. They may be defined directly to be the number of permutations of n elements with k disjoint cycles. For example, of the 3! = 6 permutations of three elements, there is one permutation with three cycles (the identity permutation, given in one-line notation by 123 or in cycle notation by (1)(2)(3)), three permutations with two cycles (132 = (1)(23), 213 = (12)(3), and 321 = (13)(2)) and two permutations with one cycle (312 = (132) and 231 = (123)). Thus, \\\\left[{3\\\\atop 3}\\\\right] = 1, \\\\left[{3\\\\atop 2}\\\\right] = 3 and \\\\left[{3\\\\atop 1}\\\\right] = 2. These can be seen to agree with the previous calculation of s(n, k) for n = 3. The unsigned Stirling numbers may also be defined algebraically, as the coefficients of the rising factorial: : x^{\\\\overline{n}} = x(x+1)\\\\cdots(x+n-1)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\left[{n\\\\atop k}\\\\right] x^k. The notations used on this page for Stirling numbers are not universal, and may conflict with notations in other sources. (The square bracket notation \\\\left[{n\\\\atop k}\\\\right] is also common notation for the Gaussian coefficients.) ===Further example=== s(4,2)=11 The image at right shows that \\\\left[{4\\\\atop 2}\\\\right] = 11: the symmetric group on 4 objects has 3 permutations of the form : (\\\\bullet \\\\bullet)(\\\\bullet \\\\bullet) (having 2 orbits, each of size 2), and 8 permutations of the form : (\\\\bullet\\\\bullet\\\\bullet)(\\\\bullet) (having 1 orbit of size 3 and 1 orbit of size 1). ===Signs=== The signs of the (signed) Stirling numbers of the first kind are predictable and depend on the parity of . In particular, :s(n,k) = (-1)^{n-k} \\\\left[{n \\\\atop k}\\\\right] . ==Recurrence relation== The unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind can be calculated by the recurrence relation : \\\\left[{n+1\\\\atop k}\\\\right] = n \\\\left[{n\\\\atop k}\\\\right] + \\\\left[{n\\\\atop k-1}\\\\right] for k > 0, with the initial conditions :\\\\left[{0\\\\atop 0}\\\\right] = 1 \\\\quad\\\\mbox{and}\\\\quad \\\\left[{n\\\\atop 0}\\\\right]=\\\\left[{0\\\\atop n}\\\\right]=0 for n > 0. It follows immediately that the (signed) Stirling numbers of the first kind satisfy the recurrence : s(n + 1, k) = -n \\\\cdot s(n, k) + s(n, k - 1). = x(x+1)\\\\cdots (x+n-1)(x+n) = n\\\\cdot x^{\\\\overline{n}}+x \\\\cdot x^{\\\\overline{n}}. The coefficient of xk on the left- hand side of this equation is \\\\left[{n+1\\\\atop k}\\\\right]. The coefficient of xk in n \\\\cdot x^{\\\\overline{n}} is n \\\\cdot \\\\left[{n\\\\atop k}\\\\right], while the coefficient of xk in x \\\\cdot x^{\\\\overline{n}} is \\\\left[{n\\\\atop k - 1}\\\\right]. Since the two sides are equal as polynomials, the coefficients of xk on both sides must be equal, and the result follows. }} . To form a new permutation of n + 1 objects and k cycles one must insert the new object into this array. There are n ways to perform this insertion, inserting the new object immediately following any of the n already present. This explains the n \\\\left[{n\\\\atop k}\\\\right] term of the recurrence relation. These two cases include all possibilities, so the recurrence relation follows. }} ==Table of values== Below is a triangular array of unsigned values for the Stirling numbers of the first kind, similar in form to Pascal's triangle. These values are easy to generate using the recurrence relation in the previous section. { cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" style=\\"text-align:right;\\"  -  !  0 !  1 !  2 !  3 !  4 !  5 !  6 !  7 !  8 !  9 - !  0  1 - !  1  0  1 - !  2  0  1  1 - !  3  0  2  3  1 - !  4  0  6  11  6  1 - !  5  0  24  50  35  10  1 - !  6  0  120  274  225  85  15  1 - !  7  0  720  1764  1624  735  175  21  1 - !  8  0  5040  13068  13132  6769  1960  322  28  1 - !  9  0  40320  109584  118124  67284  22449  4536  546  36  1 - } ==PropertiesSimple identities=== Note that although :\\\\left[{0 \\\\atop 0}\\\\right] = 1, we have \\\\left[{n\\\\atop 0}\\\\right] = 0 if n > 0 and :\\\\left[{0\\\\atop k}\\\\right] = 0 if k > 0, or more generally \\\\left[{n\\\\atop k}\\\\right] = 0 if k > n. Also :\\\\left[{n \\\\atop 1}\\\\right] = (n-1)!, \\\\quad \\\\left[{n\\\\atop n}\\\\right] = 1, \\\\quad \\\\left[{n\\\\atop n-1}\\\\right] = {n \\\\choose 2}, and :\\\\left[{n\\\\atop n-2}\\\\right] = \\\\frac{1}{4} (3n-1) {n \\\\choose 3}\\\\quad\\\\mbox{ and }\\\\quad\\\\left[{n\\\\atop n-3}\\\\right] = {n \\\\choose 2} {n \\\\choose 4}. Similar relationships involving the Stirling numbers hold for the Bernoulli polynomials. Many relations for the Stirling numbers shadow similar relations on the binomial coefficients. The study of these 'shadow relationships' is termed umbral calculus and culminates in the theory of Sheffer sequences. Generalizations of the Stirling numbers of both kinds to arbitrary complex-valued inputs may be extended through the relations of these triangles to the Stirling convolution polynomials.See section 6.2 and 6.5 of Concrete Mathematics. ===Other relations=== Expansions for fixed k Since the Stirling numbers are the coefficients of a polynomial with roots 0, 1, ..., , one has by Vieta's formulas that \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ n - k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] = \\\\sum_{0 \\\\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\\\ldots < i_k < n} i_1 i_2 \\\\cdots i_k. In other words, the Stirling numbers of the first kind are given by elementary symmetric polynomials evaluated at 0, 1, ..., .Richard P. Stanley, Enumerative Combinatorics, volume 1 (2nd ed.). Page 34 of the online version. In this form, the simple identities given above take the form \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ n - 1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] = \\\\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} i = \\\\binom{n}{2}, \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ n - 2 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] = \\\\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1}\\\\sum_{j = 0}^{i - 1} ij = \\\\frac{3n - 1}{4} \\\\binom{n}{3}, \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ n - 3 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] = \\\\sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1}\\\\sum_{j = 0}^{i - 1}\\\\sum_{k = 0}^{j - 1} ijk = \\\\binom{n}{2} \\\\binom{n}{4}, and so on. One may produce alternative forms for the Stirling numbers of the first kind with a similar approach preceded by some algebraic manipulation: since :(x+1)(x+2) \\\\cdots (x+n-1) = (n-1)! \\\\cdot (x+1) \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2}+1\\\\right) \\\\cdots \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{n-1}+1\\\\right), it follows from Newton's formulas that one can expand the Stirling numbers of the first kind in terms of generalized harmonic numbers. This yields identities like :\\\\left[{n\\\\atop 2}\\\\right] = (n-1)!\\\\; H_{n-1}, :\\\\left[{n\\\\atop 3}\\\\right] = \\\\frac{1}{2} (n-1)! \\\\left[ (H_{n-1})^2 - H_{n-1}^{(2)} \\\\right] :\\\\left[{n\\\\atop 4}\\\\right] = \\\\frac{1}{3!}(n-1)! \\\\left[ (H_{n-1})^3 - 3H_{n-1}H_{n-1}^{(2)}+2H_{n-1}^{(3)} \\\\right], where Hn is the harmonic number H_n = \\\\frac{1}{1} + \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\ldots + \\\\frac{1}{n} and Hn(m) is the generalized harmonic number H_n^{(m)} = \\\\frac{1}{1^m} + \\\\frac{1}{2^m} + \\\\ldots + \\\\frac{1}{n^m}. These relations can be generalized to give :\\\\frac{1}{(n-1)!} \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ k+1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] = \\\\sum_{i_1=1}^{n-1} \\\\sum_{i_2=i_1+1}^{n-1} \\\\cdots \\\\sum_{i_k=i_{k-1}+1}^{n-1} \\\\frac{1}{i_1 i_2 \\\\cdots i_k} = \\\\frac{w(n, k)}{k!} where w(n, m) is defined recursively in terms of the generalized harmonic numbers by :w(n, m) = \\\\delta_{m, 0} + \\\\sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (1-m)_k H_{n-1}^{(k+1)} w(n, m-1-k). (Here Œ¥ is the Kronecker delta function and (m)_k is the Pochhammer symbol.) For fixed n \\\\geq 0 these weighted harmonic number expansions are generated by the generating function :\\\\frac{1}{n!} \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] = [x^k]\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\sum_{m \\\\geq 1} \\\\frac{(-1)^{m-1} H_n^{(m)}}{m} x^m\\\\right), where the notation [x^k] means extraction of the coefficient of x^k from the following formal power series (see the non-exponential Bell polynomials and section 3 of ). More generally, sums related to these weighted harmonic number expansions of the Stirling numbers of the first kind can be defined through generalized zeta series transforms of generating functions. One can also \\"invert\\" the relations for these Stirling numbers given in terms of the k-order harmonic numbers to write the integer-order generalized harmonic numbers in terms of weighted sums of terms involving the Stirling numbers of the first kind. For example, when k = 2, 3 the second-order and third-order harmonic numbers are given by :(n!)^2 \\\\cdot H_n^{(2)} = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]^2 - 2 \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] :(n!)^3 \\\\cdot H_n^{(3)} = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]^3 - 3 \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] + 3 \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]^2 \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]. More generally, one can invert the Bell polynomial generating function for the Stirling numbers expanded in terms of the m-order harmonic numbers to obtain that for integers m \\\\geq 2 :H_n^{(m)} = -m \\\\times [x^m]\\\\log\\\\left(1+\\\\sum_{k \\\\geq 1} \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ k+1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\frac{(-x)^k}{n!}\\\\right). Factorial-related sums For all positive integer m and n, one has (n+m)!=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n\\\\sum_{j=0}^mm^{\\\\overline{n-k}}\\\\left[{m\\\\atop j}\\\\right] \\\\binom{n}{k}k!, where a^{\\\\overline{b}}=a(a+1)\\\\cdots(a+b-1) is the rising factorial. This formula is a dual of Spivey's result for the Bell numbers. Other related formulas involving the falling factorials, Stirling numbers of the first kind, and in some cases Stirling numbers of the second kind include the following:See Table 265 (Section 6.1) of the Concrete Mathematics reference. \\\\begin{align} n^{\\\\underline{n-m}} & = \\\\sum_k \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ k+1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} k \\\\\\\\\\\\ m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} (-1)^{m-k} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\binom{n}{m} (n-1)^{\\\\underline{n-m}} & = \\\\sum_k \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} k \\\\\\\\\\\\ m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\binom{n}{m} & = \\\\sum_k \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ k+1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} k \\\\\\\\\\\\ m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] (-1)^{m-k} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ m+1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & = \\\\sum_{0 \\\\leq k \\\\leq n} \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} k \\\\\\\\\\\\ m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] n^{\\\\underline{n-k}}. \\\\end{align} Inversion relations and the Stirling transform For any pair of sequences, \\\\\\\\{f_n\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{g_n\\\\\\\\}, related by a finite sum Stirling number formula given by :g_n = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} f_k, for all integers n \\\\geq 0, we have a corresponding inversion formula for f_n given by :f_n = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] (-1)^{n-k} g_k. These inversion relations between the two sequences translate into functional equations between the sequence exponential generating functions given by the Stirling (generating function) transform as :\\\\widehat{G}(z) = \\\\widehat{F}\\\\left(e^z-1\\\\right) and :\\\\widehat{F}(z) = \\\\widehat{G}\\\\left(\\\\log(1+z)\\\\right). The differential operators D = d/dx and \\\\vartheta = zD are related by the following formulas for all integers n \\\\geq 0:Concrete Mathematics exercise 13 of section 6. Note that this formula immediately implies the first positive-order Stirling number transformation given in the main article on generating function transformations. :\\\\vartheta^n = \\\\sum_k S(n, k) z^k D^k :z^n D^n = \\\\sum_k s(n, k) \\\\vartheta^k Another pair of \\"inversion\\" relations involving the Stirling numbers relate the forward differences and the ordinary n^{th} derivatives of a function, f(x), which is analytic for all x by the formulas (Section 26.8) :\\\\frac{1}{k!} \\\\frac{d^k}{dx^k} f(x) = \\\\sum_{n=k}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{s(n, k)}{n!} \\\\Delta^n f(x) :\\\\frac{1}{k!} \\\\Delta^k f(x) = \\\\sum_{n=k}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{S(n, k)}{n!} \\\\frac{d^n}{dx^n} f(x). Congruences The following congruence identity may be proved via a generating function-based approach:Herbert Wilf, Generatingfunctionology, Section 4.6. : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & \\\\equiv \\\\binom{\\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\rfloor}{m - \\\\lceil n/2 \\\\rceil} = [x^m] \\\\left( x^{\\\\lceil n/2 \\\\rceil} (x+1)^{\\\\lfloor n/2 \\\\rfloor} \\\\right) && \\\\pmod{2}, \\\\end{align} More recent results providing Jacobi-type J-fractions that generate the single factorial function and generalized factorial-related products lead to other new congruence results for the Stirling numbers of the first kind. For example, working modulo 2 we can prove that : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & \\\\equiv \\\\frac{2^{n}}{4} [n \\\\geq 2] + [n = 1] && \\\\pmod{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & \\\\equiv \\\\frac{3 \\\\cdot 2^{n}}{16} (n-1) [n \\\\geq 3] + [n = 2] && \\\\pmod{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & \\\\equiv 2^{n-7} (9n-20) (n-1) [n \\\\geq 4] + [n = 3] && \\\\pmod{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & \\\\equiv 2^{n-9} (3n-10) (3n-7) (n-1) [n \\\\geq 5] + [n = 4] && \\\\pmod{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 5 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & \\\\equiv 2^{n-13} (27n^3-279n^2+934n-1008) (n-1) [n \\\\geq 6] + [n = 5] && \\\\pmod{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 6 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & \\\\equiv \\\\frac{2^{n-15}}{5} (9n^2-71n+120) (3n-14) (3n-11) (n-1) [n \\\\geq 7] + [n = 6] && \\\\pmod{2}, \\\\end{align} and working modulo 3 we can similarly prove that : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & \\\\equiv \\\\sum\\\\limits_{j = \\\\pm 1} \\\\frac{1}{36} \\\\left(9-5 j\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\right) \\\\times \\\\left(3+j\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\right)^{n} [n \\\\geq 2] + [n = 1] && \\\\pmod{3} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & \\\\equiv \\\\sum\\\\limits_{j = \\\\pm 1} \\\\frac{1}{216} \\\\left((44n-41)-(25n-24) \\\\cdot j\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\right) \\\\times \\\\left(3+j\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\right)^{n} [n \\\\geq 3] + [n = 2] && \\\\pmod{3} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & \\\\equiv \\\\sum\\\\limits_{j = \\\\pm 1} \\\\frac{1}{15552} \\\\left((1299n^2-3837n+2412)- (745n^2-2217n+1418) \\\\cdot j\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\right) \\\\times \\\\left(3+j\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\right)^{n} [n \\\\geq 4] + [n = 3] && \\\\pmod{3} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & \\\\equiv \\\\sum\\\\limits_{j = \\\\pm 1} \\\\frac{1}{179936} \\\\bigl((6409n^3-383778n^2+70901n-37092) - (3690n^3-22374n^2+41088n-21708) \\\\cdot j\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\bigr) \\\\times \\\\left(3+j\\\\sqrt{3}\\\\right)^{n} [n \\\\geq 5] + [n = 4] && \\\\pmod{3}. \\\\end{align} More generally, for fixed integers h \\\\geq 3 if we define the ordered roots :\\\\left(\\\\omega_{h,i}\\\\right)_{i=1}^{h-1} := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\omega_j : \\\\sum_{i=0}^{h-1} \\\\binom{h-1}{i} \\\\frac{h!}{(i+1)!} (-\\\\omega_j)^{i} = 0,\\\\ 1 \\\\leq j < h \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, then we may expand congruences for these Stirling numbers defined as the coefficients :\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] = [R^m] R(R+1) \\\\cdots (R+n-1), in the following form where the functions, p_{h,i}^{[m]}(n), denote fixed polynomials of degree m in n for each h, m, and i: :\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] = \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=0}^{h-1} p_{h,i}^{[m]}(n) \\\\times \\\\omega_{h,i}^{n} \\\\right) [n > m] + [n = m] \\\\qquad \\\\pmod{h}, Section 6.2 of the reference cited above provides more explicit expansions related to these congruences for the r-order harmonic numbers and for the generalized factorial products, p_n(\\\\alpha, R) := R(R+\\\\alpha)\\\\cdots(R+(n-1)\\\\alpha). In the previous examples, the notation [\\\\mathtt{cond}] denotes Iverson's convention. ===Generating functions=== A variety of identities may be derived by manipulating the generating function: :H(z,u)= (1+z)^u = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty {u \\\\choose n} z^n = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{z^n}{n!} \\\\sum_{k=0}^n s(n,k) u^k = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty u^k \\\\sum_{n=k}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {z^n}{n!} s(n,k). Using the equality :(1+z)^u = e^{u\\\\log(1+z)} = \\\\sum_{k = 0}^\\\\infty (\\\\log(1 + z))^k \\\\frac{u^k}{k!}, it follows that :\\\\sum_{n=k}^\\\\infty (-1)^{n-k} \\\\left[{n\\\\atop k}\\\\right] \\\\frac{z^n}{n!} = \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\log (1+z)\\\\right)^k}{k!}. (This identity is valid for formal power series, and the sum converges in the complex plane for z < 1.) Other identities arise by exchanging the order of summation, taking derivatives, making substitutions for z or u, etc. For example, we may derive: arXiv :(1-z)^{-u} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty u^k \\\\sum_{n=k}^\\\\infty \\\\frac {z^n}{n!} \\\\left[{n\\\\atop k}\\\\right] = e^{u\\\\log(1/(1-z))} and :\\\\frac{\\\\log^m (1+z)}{1+z} = m!\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac { s(k+1,m+1)\\\\,z^k}{k!} ,\\\\qquad m=1,2,3,\\\\ldots\\\\quad z<1 or :\\\\sum_{n=i}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\left[{n\\\\atop i}\\\\right]}{n \\\\, (n!)} = \\\\zeta(i+1),\\\\qquad i=1,2,3,\\\\ldots and :\\\\sum_{n=i}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\left[{n\\\\atop i}\\\\right]}{n \\\\, (v)_n} = \\\\zeta(i+1,v),\\\\qquad i=1,2,3,\\\\ldots\\\\quad \\\\Re(v)>0 where \\\\zeta(k) and \\\\zeta(k,v) are the Riemann zeta function and the Hurwitz zeta function respectively, and even evaluate this integral :\\\\int_0^1 \\\\frac{\\\\log^z(1-x)}{x^k} \\\\, dx = \\\\frac{(-1)^z \\\\Gamma(z+1)}{(k-1)!}\\\\sum_{r=1}^{k-1} s(k-1,r)\\\\sum_{m=0}^r \\\\binom{r}{m}(k-2)^{r-m} \\\\zeta(z+1-m) ,\\\\qquad \\\\Re(z) > k-1 ,\\\\quad k=3,4,5,\\\\ldots where \\\\Gamma(z) is the Gamma function. There also exist more complicated expressions for the zeta-functions involving the Stirling numbers. One, for example, has :\\\\frac{k!}{(s-k)_k}\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{(n+k)!}\\\\left[{n+k \\\\atop n}\\\\right]\\\\sum_{l=0}^{n+k-1}\\\\\\\\!(-1)^l \\\\binom{n+k-1}{l} (l+v)^{k-s}=\\\\zeta(s,v),\\\\quad k=1, 2, 3,\\\\ldots This series generalizes Hasse's series for the Hurwitz zeta-function (we obtain Hasse's series by setting k=1).See also some more interesting series representations and expansions mentioned in Connon's article: . ===Asymptotics=== The next estimate given in terms of the Euler gamma constant applies:These estimates are found in Section 26.8 of the NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions. :\\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ k+1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\sim \\\\frac{n!}{k!} \\\\left(\\\\gamma+\\\\ln n\\\\right)^k,\\\\ \\\\text{ uniformly for } k = o(\\\\ln n). For fixed n we have the following estimate as k \\\\longrightarrow \\\\infty: :\\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+k \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\sim \\\\frac{k^{2n}}{2^n n!}. We can also apply the saddle point asymptotic methods from Temme's article to obtain other estimates for the Stirling numbers of the first kind. These estimates are more involved and complicated to state. Nonetheless, we provide an example. In particular, we define the log gamma function, \\\\phi(x), whose higher-order derivatives are given in terms of polygamma functions as : \\\\begin{align} \\\\phi(x) & = \\\\ln\\\\left[(1+1)(x+2) \\\\cdots (x+n)\\\\right] - m \\\\ln x \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\ln \\\\Gamma(x+n+1) - \\\\ln \\\\Gamma(x+1) - m \\\\ln x \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\phi^{\\\\prime}(x) & = \\\\psi(x+n+1) - \\\\psi(x+1) - m / x, \\\\end{align} where we consider the (unique) saddle point x_0 of the function to be the solution of \\\\phi^{\\\\prime}(x) = 0 when 1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq n. Then for t_0 = m / (n-m) and the constants : B = \\\\phi(x_0) - n \\\\ln(1+t_0) + m \\\\ln t_0 :g(t_0) = \\\\frac{1}{x_0} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m(n-m)}{n \\\\phi^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}(x_0)}}, we have the following asymptotic estimate as n \\\\longrightarrow \\\\infty: :\\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ m+1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\sim e^{B} g(t_0) \\\\binom{n}{m}. ===Finite sums=== Since permutations are partitioned by number of cycles, one has :\\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\left[{n\\\\atop k}\\\\right] = n! The identity :\\\\sum_{p=k}^{n} {\\\\left[{n\\\\atop p}\\\\right]\\\\binom{p}{k}} = \\\\left[{n+1\\\\atop k+1}\\\\right] can be proved by the techniques on the page Stirling numbers and exponential generating functions. The table in section 6.1 of Concrete Mathematics provides a plethora of generalized forms of finite sums involving the Stirling numbers. Several particular finite sums relevant to this article include : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & = \\\\sum_k \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ k+1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\binom{k}{m} (-1)^{m-k} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ m+1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} k \\\\\\\\\\\\ m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\frac{n!}{k!} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} m+n+1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & = \\\\sum_{k=0}^m (n+k) \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n+k \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ l+m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\binom{l+m}{l} & = \\\\sum_k \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} k \\\\\\\\\\\\ l \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n-k \\\\\\\\\\\\ m \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] \\\\binom{n}{k}. \\\\end{align} Other finite sum identities involving the signed Stirling numbers of the first kind found, for example, in the NIST Handbook of Mathematical Functions (Section 26.8) include the following sums:The first identity below follows as a special case of the Bell polynomial identity found in section 4.1.8 of S. Roman's The Umbral Calculus where s(n, k) = B_{n,k}\\\\left(0!, -1!, 2!, -3!, \\\\ldots\\\\right), though several other related formulas for the Stirling numbers defined in this manner are derived similarly. : \\\\begin{align} \\\\binom{k}{h} s(n, k) & = \\\\sum_{j=k-h}^{n-h} \\\\binom{n}{j} s(n-j, h) s(j, k-h) \\\\\\\\\\\\ s(n+1, k+1) & = n! \\\\times \\\\sum_{j=k}^n \\\\frac{(-1)^{n-j}}{j!} s(j, k) \\\\\\\\\\\\ s(n, n-k) & = \\\\sum_{j=0}^k (-1)^j \\\\binom{n-1+j}{k+j} \\\\binom{n+k}{k-j} S(k+j, j) \\\\\\\\\\\\ s(n, k) & = \\\\sum_{j=k}^n s(n+1, j+1) n^{j-k}. \\\\end{align} Additionally, if we define the second-order Eulerian numbers by the triangular recurrence relation A table of the second- order Eulerian numbers and a synopsis of their properties is found in section 6.2 of Concrete Mathematics. For example, we have that \\\\sum_k E_2(n, k) = (2n-1)(2n-3) \\\\cdots (1) = \\\\frac{(2n)^{\\\\underline{n}}}{2^n}. These numbers also have the following combinatorial interpretation: If we form all permutations of the multiset \\\\\\\\{1,1,2,2,\\\\ldots,n,n\\\\\\\\} with the property that all numbers between the two occurrences of m are greater than m for 1 \\\\leq m \\\\leq n, then E_2(n, k) is the number of such permutations that have k ascents. :E_2(n, k) = (k+1) E_2(n-1, k) + (2n-1-k) E_2(n-1, k-1) + \\\\delta_{n,0} \\\\delta_{k,0}, we arrive at the following identity related to the form of the Stirling convolution polynomials which can be employed to generalize both Stirling number triangles to arbitrary real, or complex-valued, values of the input x: :\\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ x-n \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] = \\\\sum_k E_2(n, k) \\\\binom{x+k}{2n}. Particular expansions of the previous identity lead to the following identities expanding the Stirling numbers of the first kind for the first few small values of n := 1, 2, 3: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ x-1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & = \\\\binom{x}{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ x-2 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & = \\\\binom{x}{4} + 2 \\\\binom{x+1}{4} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ x-3 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & = \\\\binom{x}{6} + 8 \\\\binom{x+1}{6} + 6 \\\\binom{x+2}{6}. \\\\end{align} Software tools for working with finite sums involving Stirling numbers and Eulerian numbers are provided by the RISC Stirling.m package utilities in Mathematica. Other software packages for guessing formulas for sequences (and polynomial sequence sums) involving Stirling numbers and other special triangles is available for both Mathematica and Sage here and here, respectively. Furthermore, infinite series involving the finite sums with the Stirling numbers often lead to the special functions. For example arXiv \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty}\\\\\\\\!\\\\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{n!}\\\\sum_{l = 1 }^{n} \\\\\\\\!\\\\frac{s(n, l)}{l+k}=\\\\sum_{l=2}^{\\\\infty}\\\\\\\\!\\\\frac{(-1)^{l}\\\\cdot\\\\zeta(l)}{l+k-1}=\\\\frac{1}{k-1} -\\\\frac{\\\\ln2\\\\pi}{k}+\\\\frac{\\\\gamma}{2} +\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\sum_{l=1}^{\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{1}{2}(k-1)\\\\rfloor}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!

Malenfant, \\"Finite, Closed-form Expressions for the Partition Function and for Euler, Bernoulli, and Stirling Numbers\\" : \\\\begin{align} s(n,n-p) &= \\\\frac{1}{(n-p-1)!} \\\\sum_{0 \\\\leq k_1, \\\\ldots , k_p : \\\\sum_1^p mk_m = p} (-1)^K \\\\frac{(n+K-1)!}{k_1! k_2! \\\\cdots k_p! ~ 2!^{k_1} 3!^{k_2} \\\\cdots (p+1)!^{k_p}} , \\\\end{align} where K =k_1 + \\\\cdots + k_p. The sum is a sum over all partitions of p. Another exact nested sum expansion for these Stirling numbers is computed by elementary symmetric polynomials corresponding to the coefficients in x of a product of the form (1+c_1 x) \\\\cdots (1+c_{n-1}x). In particular, we see that : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left[ \\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ k+1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right] & = [x^k] (x+1)(x+2) \\\\cdots (x+n-1) = (n-1)! \\\\cdot [x^k] (x+1) \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2}+1\\\\right) \\\\cdots \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{n-1}+1\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{1 \\\\leq i_1 < \\\\cdots < i_k < n} \\\\frac{(n-1)!}{i_1 \\\\cdots i_k}. \\\\end{align} Newton's identities combined with the above expansions may be used to give an alternate proof of the weighted expansions involving the generalized harmonic numbers already noted above. Another explicit formula for reciprocal powers of n is given by the following identity for integers p \\\\geq 2: :\\\\frac{1}{n^p} = \\\\frac{1}{n^{p-1}} + \\\\frac{(-1)^{p-1}}{n!}\\\\left(\\\\begin{bmatrix} n\\\\\\\\\\\\p\\\\end{bmatrix}+ \\\\begin{bmatrix} n\\\\\\\\\\\\p-1\\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\right) + \\\\frac{(-1)^p}{n \\\\cdot n!} \\\\begin{bmatrix} n+1\\\\\\\\\\\\p\\\\end{bmatrix} + \\\\sum_{j=0}^{p-3} \\\\begin{bmatrix} n+1\\\\\\\\\\\\j+2\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\frac{(-1)^{j+1} (n-1)}{n^{p-1-j} \\\\cdot n!}. Notice that this last identity immediately implies relations between the polylogarithm functions, the Stirling number exponential generating functions given above, and the Stirling-number-based power series for the generalized Nielsen polylogarithm functions. === Relations to natural logarithm function === The nth derivative of the Œºth power of the natural logarithm involves the signed Stirling numbers of the first kind: {\\\\operatorname{d}^n\\\\\\\\!(\\\\ln x)^\\\\mu\\\\over\\\\operatorname{d}\\\\\\\\!x^n}=x^{-n}\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\\\mu^{\\\\underline{k}}s(n,n-k+1)(\\\\ln x)^{\\\\mu-k}, where \\\\mu^\\\\underline{i}is the falling factorial, and s(n,n-k+1)is the signed Stirling number. It can be proved by using mathematical induction. ==Generalizations== There are many notions of generalized Stirling numbers that may be defined (depending on application) in a number of differing combinatorial contexts. In so much as the Stirling numbers of the first kind correspond to the coefficients of the distinct polynomial expansions of the single factorial function, n! = n (n-1) (n-2) \\\\cdots 2 \\\\cdot 1, we may extend this notion to define triangular recurrence relations for more general classes of products. In particular, for any fixed arithmetic function f: \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} and symbolic parameters x, t, related generalized factorial products of the form :(x)_{n,f,t} := \\\\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \\\\left(x+\\\\frac{f(k)}{t^k}\\\\right) may be studied from the point of view of the classes of generalized Stirling numbers of the first kind defined by the following coefficients of the powers of x in the expansions of (x)_{n,f,t} and then by the next corresponding triangular recurrence relation: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]_{f,t} & = [x^{k-1}] (x)_{n,f,t} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = f(n-1) t^{1-n} \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]_{f,t} + \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} n-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ k-1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right]_{f,t} + \\\\delta_{n,0} \\\\delta_{k,0}. \\\\end{align} These coefficients satisfy a number of analogous properties to those for the Stirling numbers of the first kind as well as recurrence relations and functional equations related to the f-harmonic numbers, F_n^{(r)}(t) := \\\\sum_{k \\\\leq n} t^k / f(k)^r.Combinatorial Identities for Generalized Stirling Numbers Expanding f-Factorial Functions and the f-Harmonic Numbers (2016). One special case of these bracketed coefficients corresponding to t \\\\equiv 1 allows us to expand the multiple factorial, or multifactorial functions as polynomials in n (see generalizations of the double factorial). The Stirling numbers of both kinds, the binomial coefficients, and the first and second-order Eulerian numbers are all defined by special cases of a triangular super-recurrence of the form :\\\\left\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right = (\\\\alpha n + \\\\beta k + \\\\gamma) \\\\left\\\\begin{matrix} n-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right + (\\\\alpha^{\\\\prime} n + \\\\beta^{\\\\prime} k + \\\\gamma^{\\\\prime}) \\\\left\\\\begin{matrix} n-1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ k-1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right + \\\\delta_{n,0} \\\\delta_{k,0}, for integers n, k \\\\geq 0 and where \\\\left\\\\begin{matrix} n \\\\\\\\\\\\ k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right \\\\equiv 0 whenever n < 0 or k < 0. In this sense, the form of the Stirling numbers of the first kind may also be generalized by this parameterized super-recurrence for fixed scalars \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma, \\\\alpha^{\\\\prime}, \\\\beta^{\\\\prime}, \\\\gamma^{\\\\prime} (not all zero). ==See also== * Stirling polynomials * Stirling numbers * Stirling numbers of the second kind * Random permutation statistics ==References== * The Art of Computer Programming * Concrete Mathematics * * . * Category:Permutations Category:Factorial and binomial topics Category:Triangles of numbers pl:Liczby Stirlinga#Liczby Stirlinga I rodzaju ","title":"Stirling numbers of the first kind"},{"id":"2229320","text":"Saint Alphonsa, F.C.C., (born Anna Muttathupadathu; 19 August 1910 ‚Äì 28 July 1946) was an Indian religious sister and educator. She was the first woman of Indian origin to be canonised as a saint by the Catholic Church,India's first woman saint cheers riot-hit Christians reuters.com, 11 October 2008 and the first canonised saint of the Syro-Malabar Church, an Eastern Catholic Church based in Kerala. Her feast day is observed on 28 July. == Life  Early Life === St Alphonsa was born as Anna Muttathupadathu in a Syro-Malabar Nasrani family to Cherian Ouseph and Mary Muttathupadathu in Kudamalloor, near Kottayam, on 19 August 1910. She was baptised on 27 August. Alphonsamma, as she was locally known, was born in Arpookara, a village in the princely state of Travancore within Kerala, India. This lies within the Archdiocese of Changanassery. Her parents nicknamed her Annakkutty (little Anna). She had a difficult childhood and experienced loss and suffering early on in life. Anna's mother died when she was young, so her maternal aunt raised her. Hagiographies describe her early life as one of suffering at the hands of her stern foster mother and the teasing of schoolchildren. Anna was educated by her great-uncle, Father Joseph Muttathupadathu. When Anna was three-years-old, she contracted eczema and suffered for over a year. In 1916, Anna started school in Arpookara. She received her First Communion on 27 November 1917. When the first school cycle ended in 1920, the time had come to transfer to Muttuchira, to the house of her aunt Anna Murickan, to whom her mother, before she died, had entrusted her as her adoptive mother. She was raised in the Murickan family, which was an ancient and prominent family. Anna received many marriage proposals from reputed families. During that period Th√©r√®se of Lisieux appeared and told her that she will become a saint. There are many similarities in the lives of Anna and Th√©r√®se, and she was Anna's all-time favorite person and role model. Anna sacrificed her material fortune and wanted to dedicate her life to Jesus Christ. In 1923, Anna's feet were burnt when she fell into a pit of burning chaff; local hagiographies describe this as a self-inflicted injury in order to avoid her foster mother's attempt to arrange a marriage for her and thereby to fulfill her desire for becoming a religious sister instead. This accident left her partially disabled for the rest of her life. === Sister Alphonsa === When it became possible, Anna joined the Franciscan Clarist Congregation, a religious congregation of the Third Order of St. Francis, and through them, completed her schooling. Anna arrived at the Clarist convent at Bharananganam, Kottayam district, on Pentecost Sunday 1927. She received the postulant's veil on 2 August 1928 and took the name Alphonsa of the Immaculate Conception in honour of St. Alphonsus Ligouri, whose feast day it was. In May 1929 Sister Alphonsa was assigned to teach at Malayalam High School at Vazhappally. Her foster mother died in 1930. She resumed her studies at Changanacherry, while working as a temporary teacher at a school at Vakakkad. On 19 May 1930 Alphonsa entered the novitiate of the congregation at Bharananganam. On 11 August 1931 she completed the novitiate and took her first vows. And became a religious in the Catholic Church. === Health Decline === The period 1930‚Äì1935 was characterised by grave illness. Sister Alphonsa took her permanent vows on 12 August 1936. Two days later she returned to Bharananganam from Changanacherry. She then taught high school at St. Alphonsa Girl's High School, but was often sick and unable to teach. For most of her years as a Clarist Sister she endured serious illness. In December 1936, it is claimed that she was cured from her ailments through the intervention of the Kuriakose Elias Chavara (who was beatified at the same ceremony as she), but on 14 June 1939 she was struck by a severe attack of pneumonia which left her weakened. On 18 October 1940, a thief entered her room in the middle of the night. This traumatic event caused her to suffer amnesia and weakened her again. Her health continued to deteriorate over a period of months. She received extreme unction on 29 September 1941. The next day it is believed that she regained her memory, though not complete health. Her health improved over the next few years, until in July 1945 she developed gastroenteritis and liver problems that caused violent convulsions and vomiting.\\"Alphonsa of the Immaculate Conception (1910‚Äì1946)\\". Vatican News service (12 October 2008). Retrieved on 2018-11-30. During the last year of her life she came to know Father Sebastian Valopilly (later Bishop of Kerala) who frequently brought her communion. This bishop became famous in Kerala for championing the cause of poor people from all religious backgrounds who had come to live in Thalassery as a result of shortages elsewhere. == Death == After a series of serious health problems, she died on 28 July 1946, at a young age of 35. She was buried at St. Mary's Catholic Church, Bharananganam, Travancore (present day Kottayam district) in the Diocese of Palai.\\"St. Alphonsa\\". Kerala Catholic Times. Retrieved on 25 July 2020. == Veneration == Claims of her miraculous intervention began almost immediately upon her death and often involved the children of the convent school where she used to teach. On 2 December 1953, Cardinal Eug√®ne Tisserant inaugurated the diocesan process for her beatification and Alphonsa was declared a Servant of God. In 1985, Pope John Paul II formally approved a miracle attributed to her intercession and on 9 July she became \\"Venerable Sister Alphonsa\\".\\"St. Alphonsa\\". St. Alphonsa Syro Malabar Catholic Church, Los Angeles, California. === Beatification === Venerable Sister Alphonsa was beatified along with Father Kuriakose Elias Chavara, T.O.C.D., at Kottayam, on 8 February 1986 by Pope John Paul II during his Apostolic Pilgrimage to India. During his speech at Nehru Stadium, the Pope said: > From early in her life, Sister Alphonsa experienced great suffering. With > the passing of the years, the heavenly Father gave her an ever fuller share > in the Passion of his beloved Son. We recall how she experienced not only > physical pain of great intensity, but also the spiritual suffering of being > misunderstood and misjudged by others. But she constantly accepted all her > sufferings with serenity and trust in God. ... She wrote to her spiritual > director: \\"Dear Father, as my good Lord Jesus loves me so very much, I > sincerely desire to remain on this sick bed and suffer not only this, but > anything else besides, even to the end of the world. I feel now that God has > intended my life to be an oblation, a sacrifice of suffering\\" (20 November > 1944). She came to love suffering because she loved the suffering Christ. > She learned to love the Cross through her love of the crucified Lord. === Miracles === Hundreds of miraculous cures are claimed from her intervention, many of them involving straightening of clubbed feet, possibly because of her having lived with deformed feet herself. Two of these cases were submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints as proof of her miraculous intervention. The continuing cures are chronicled in the magazine PassionFlower. Bishop Sebastian reported: > About ten years ago, when I was in a small village in Wayanad outside > Manatavady, I saw a boy walking with some difficulty, using a stick. As he > approached me I noted that both of his feet were turned upside down. I had a > stack of holy cards in my pocket with Alphonsa's picture on them, so I > pulled one of them out and gave it to the boy. When I told the boy that he > should pray to this woman for the cure of his feet, the boy ‚Äì he was quite > smart for a ten-year-old boy ‚Äì replied: \\"But I'm a Muslim, and, besides, I > was born this way.\\" I replied that God is very powerful, so let's pray. A > few months later, a boy and a gentleman appeared at the house here. I didn't > recognize them at first but soon learned that it was the Muslim boy with his > father, here to tell me that his feet had been cured through their prayers > to Sister Alphonsa. They showed me the calluses on the tops of his feet, and > you could see the marks which had been made from the years of his walking > with his feet turned under. Before they left, the three of us had our > pictures taken. The boy had reportedly taken Alphonsa's picture card and asked Alphonsa to help fix his feet. Several days afterwards one of his feet supposedly turned around. He and the other members of his family then prayed for the cure of the second foot, which also supposedly turned around later. === Canonization === Birth centenary Commemorative coin released by the Reserve Bank of India On Sunday, 12 October 2008, Pope Benedict XVI announced her canonization at a ceremony at Saint Peter's Square.Indian Catholics cheer their new saintIndian Catholics cheer their first woman saint Indians from across the world, especially people from Kerala, gathered at the ceremony in Rome. Among them was a 10-year-old Kerala boy Jinil Joseph whose clubfoot ‚Äì a birth defect ‚Äì was, in the judgment of Vatican officials, miraculously healed after prayers to Alphonsa in 1999. The final ceremony for the canonization began with the holy relics of Alphonsa being presented to the Pope by Sister Celia, Mother General of the Franciscan Clarist Congregation, the congregation to which Sister Alphonsa belonged. Sister Celia was accompanied by Vice Postulator Father Francis Vadakkel and former Kerala minister K. M. Mani, all holding lit candles. Speaking in English, the Pope declared Sister Alphonsa a saint, after reading excerpts from the Bible. The Pope himself read out the biography of Alphonsa after the ceremony. In the homily, Pope Benedict XVI recalled Saint Alphonsa's life as one of \\"extreme physical and spiritual suffering\\". > This exceptional woman ... was convinced that her cross was the very means > of reaching the heavenly banquet prepared for her by the Father, , By > accepting the invitation to the wedding feast, and by adorning herself with > the garment of God's grace through prayer and penance, she conformed her > life to Christ's and now delights in the \\"rich fare and choice wines\\" of the > heavenly kingdom. \\"(Her) heroic virtues of patience, fortitude and perseverance in the midst of deep suffering remind us that God always provides the strength we need to overcome every trial,\\" the pope stated before the ceremony ended. The canonization was greeted with the bursting of firecrackers and the toll of church bells. St Mary's Forane church at Kudmaloor, her home parish, also celebrated a special Mass. The grave at St Mary's Forane Church in Bharananganam where the Franciscan Clarist Sister was buried had a chapel built there, which houses her mortal remains.

Youtube Tomb of Saint Alphonsa === Shrine === Her tomb at St. Mary's Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Bharananganam, has become a pilgrimage site as miracles have been reported by some of the faithful. St. Alphonsa Church Valiyakolly is known as the \\"Bharanaganam of North Kerala\\" (unofficial). This church is under the diocese of Thamarassery. Valiyakolly church is the first church named after St. Alphonsa in the diocese. And hence this church is one of the main pilgrimage centres of St. Alphonsa in North Kerala. Novena on the name of St. Alphonsa is being conducted here on every Friday evening === Feast === Thousands of people converge on the small town of Bharananganam when they celebrate the feast of Saint Alphonsa from 19 to 28 July each year; her tomb has been designated as a pilgrimage site with numerous miracles being reported by pious devotees.

Hanna was born in Galveston, Texas, on October 12, 1889. During his childhood he was afflicted with deafness following scarlet fever, and lost a foot in a traffic accident. Around 1917, he settled in Dunedin, Florida, and was greatly influenced by the Greek double-ended sponge boats found in nearby Tarpon Springs, Florida. Shortly after his move to Dunedin, Hanna purchased a double-ended ketch-rigged sponge boat that had been built in Apalachicola, Florida by a Greek-American shipwright named Demo George. This vessel, and others that Hanna studied, would inspire the design of Hanna's famous Tahiti ketch.John Stephen Doherty, A Ketch Called Tahiti: John G. Hanna and His Yacht Designs, International Marine, 1987. Hanna died in 1948. Hanna originally wrote of his Tahiti ketch as a 30-foot deep-sea auxiliary cruiser. The design is described and illustrated in detail in the 1935 new edition of How to build 20 boats, pp. 118‚Äì133. Hannah designed a seventy-foot research vessel, Iorano, for amphibian tractor inventor Donald Roebling, which was constructed on Roebling's own property, and which took part in a Smithsonian- connected scientific expedition led by Paul Bartsch in 1937. His 1926 Story- built ketch Faith was later purchased by director John Ford and renamed Araner. Ford, a naval reservist, used the boat both for personal recreation, and for naval intelligence. The boat was later taken into US Navy service directly as USS Araner (IX-57) during World War II. At least two boats of Hanna's design have circumnavigated the world twice. Jean Gau in the Atom; and Tom Steele in the Adios. (Don Holm, The Circumnavigators page 355). Hannah was a gifted small vessel designer, but perhaps his greatest strength -and weakness- was as a writer and critic of other's designs. He was let go by the Rudder after a drawn-out feud with L. Francis Herreshoff, who was also a columnist there, and debated acerbically with Thomas C. Gillmer over Tahiti's design antecedents, as well as with Philip Rhodes, and Howard Chapelle. == References == Category:1889 births Category:1948 deaths Category:People from Galveston, Texas Category:People from Dunedin, Florida ","title":"John G.

Most English Premier League teams now have this installed in their stadium. While it is not an official requirement, it avoids any financial loss that a club might face in having to postpone any matches due to bad weather. The first ground in England to have under-soil heating installed was Goodison Park in 1958. The pitch at Old Trafford has of under-soil heating and at Elland Road there is an under-soil heating system installed beneath the surface, consisting of 59 miles (95 km) of piping. In Germany under-soil heating is mandatory for division 1 and 2 Bundesliga clubs. The first ground to have it installed was the Olympic Stadium of Munich in 1972. In the Czech Republic, despite the league having a winter break, the Czech First League requires all participating teams to play on surfaces with under-soil heating. Several American football teams in the National Football League also have such a system installed. With American football, it is more a matter of player safety, since NFL games are never postponed on account of cold weather. There have been numerous occasions where under-soil heating's effectiveness has been questioned. One notable incident happened on December 27, 2005 when three stadia in the FA Premier League, supposedly equipped with under-soil heating, failed to stop their pitches being covered in thick snow - this led to the matches being postponed. Subsequently, on January 1, 2006, the Premier League investigated as to why the pitches at Macron Stadium (Bolton Wanderers), Ewood Park (Blackburn Rovers) and St. James' Park (Newcastle United) were not able to repel the snow. In the U.S., a notable example of the failure of an under-soil heating system occurred in 1967, when a newly installed system at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin failed before the NFL Championship game.

Created by Brian Michael Bendis and Mark Bagley, the character appears in the pages of Ultimate Spider-Man. Kenny McFarlane is one of the few characters not based on a counterpart from Marvel's main continuity, being an original Ultimate Marvel invention to the comics. However, his personality is based on Flash Thompson of the main continuity during his high school years. A version of the character is later introduced in the main continuity. In Ultimate Spider-Man, despite his apparent lack of intelligence based on being a stereotypical high school bully, Kenny is actually an astute teenager and able to deduce Spider- Man's secret identity but keeps this knowledge to himself; he respects the hero's wishes of secrecy and covertly helps him maintaining it. Knowing that Peter Parker is Spider-Man inspires Kenny to be a better person and occasionally helping others in needs. ==Fictional character biography== Obese yet strong, Kenny McFarlane is the best friend of Flash Thompson and Liz Allan. Kenny attends Midtown High School where he plays basketball for the school team.\\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\" Vol. 1 #1 (October 1, 2000) There, he can regularly be found cooperating with Flash bullying Peter Parker. However, without Flash in the vicinity, he shows a more likeable side and is often shown being friendly and open to Peter, even letting Peter stay at his house after Peter had a fight with Uncle Ben. When Peter is bitten by the genetically enhanced spider that gave the spider powers, Kenny crushes the spider under his sneakers, killing it. Later, noticing changes in Peter's physical strength and abilities and recalling the spider bite, he deduces that Peter is Spider-Man. Flash and Liz refuse to believe him and demand he prove it by kicking Peter from behind. Peter's spider sense warns that the kick is coming and willingly takes the abuse rather than reveal the abilities, which appears to dissuade Kenny. This confrontation is observed by the new-student Gwen Stacy sticking up for Peter by pulling a knife on Kong. Kong's attitude toward's Peter softens after the latter joins the basketball team and demonstrates deep loyalty to his new teammate. Kong maintains a fascination with Spider-Man even to the point of hero worship. Overtime, Kenny becomes a better person, ceased bullying, and tries to improve academically. Upon hearing about the upcoming Spider-Man movie, Kong enters a casting call for extras. His only line was \\"Look in the sky, it's Spider-Man!\\". With the film's success, he achieved some fame in his school. When Kenny and Peter share detention, Peter tells Kenny that Flash only hangs out with the latter solely out of a sense of superiority and treats him badly. Whether or not Kenny takes Peter's words to heart, he later has a particularly violent confrontation with Flash after the latter begins ridiculing the new student Kitty Pryde for being a mutant; Kenny slams Flash into a locker and furiously forces his friend to apologize, claiming he is \\"sick of [Flash's] racist crap\\", ending their friendship in the process. Frightened, Flash leaves the scene and Peter and MJ introduce Kitty to Kenny, and the pair walk away in conversation. He is later seen at Kitty's house, and Kitty later tells Peter of dating Kenny. Later, when Liz's mutant abilities manifest at a party, Kenny tells Peter to go help her; he still knew that Peter was Spider-Man all along but had kept the knowledge to himself. When Kitty was singled out by federal troops for being a mutant after the events of Ultimatum, Kenny was one of the few classmates to stick up for Kitty, physically assaulting an agent to buy her time to escape.\\"Ultimate Spider-Man\\" #10 (July 1, 2010) Kitty phased herself and Kenny through the floor and into the sewers, and they resume their relationship.

With their first hits, they were acclaimed in their home state. When their career was established (subsequent to working with Texas record producer Huey Meaux), the band relocated to the West Coast. Their move coincided with the burgeoning San Francisco psychedelic rock scene of the mid 1960s to early 1970s. Overall, the quintet were exponents of good-times music with strong roots in blues and Texas-regional traditions. ==Group's origins== Doug Sahm, a veteran of the professional music scene who first sang on radio at the age of five, formed the Quintet (first called simply 'Sir Douglas') in 1964 with longtime friend Augie Meyers and the other original members, Jack Barber, Frank Morin, and Johnny Perez. Sahm had started in country music and had played (at age eleven) on-stage with Hank Williams, Sr. during the latter's final performance. Sahm went on to play in blues clubs in his teenage years and had gained experience as a band leader. The initial success of the new group, the Quintet, on the airwaves and sales charts was achieved when they made records in conjunction with Houston music producer Huey P. Meaux. Houston's recording industry had become the center of Texas R&B; music.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine 2003. All Music Guide to the Blues, 3rd edn. Backbeat Books, pp. 694-5.

Aware of major trends, producer Huey Meaux advised connecting the new group with the English pop-music trend. As a consequence, the Texas-local R&B;, Tex-Mex, and other veins the musicians were familiar with initially went through a period of influence by the British pop bands of the early and mid 1960s. For a short while, the youthful members of the group emulated Beatles-like \\"mop-top\\" demeanor and antics on stage. However, they soon outgrew these trappings. ==Best known tracks== The Quintet is perhaps best known for the 1965 hit single \\"She's About a Mover\\" written by Doug Sahm. The song, which has a 12-bar blues structure, was once named the number one 'Texas' song by Texas Monthly. With an infectious Vox Continental organ riff provided by Augie Meyers and soulful vocals from Sahm, the track has a Tex-Mex sound. The regional smash became a breakaway hit, and the recording was used in the soundtracks of the films \\"Echo Park\\" (1986), \\"American Boyfriends\\" (1989), \\"The Doors\\" (1991), \\"Riding in Cars with Boys\\" (2001), \\"Sorority Boys\\" (2002), and \\"Beautiful Darling: (2010). The Quintet's recordings were used as well in the soundtracks of other films, such as Cisco Pike and An Officer and a Gentleman. In addition to \\"She's About a Mover,\\" the band is known for its songs \\"The Rains Came\\" (1966), \\"Mendocino\\" (1968), \\"It Didn't Even Bring Me Down\\" (1969), and \\"Dynamite Woman\\" (1969). \\"Mendocino\\" was released in December 1968 and reached No. 27 in the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 by early 1969, spending 15 weeks in the chart. It was more successful in Europe, selling over three million copies there. The track was featured in the generally highly regarded film High Fidelity, starring John Cusack and Jack Black. Having made considerable musical impact, the Quintet at one point went on to share the same European bill as the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones. ==Style== The Quintet played varied styles with an instrumental line-up that was typical of blues bands: one guitarist, keyboardist, bassist, and drummer, and a member who could play either trumpet or saxophone. Despite the blues band line-up and a musical influence from the blues, the Quintet's live sets didn't overemphasize misery or tension in the lyrical content or musical feeling of the songs. In their sets and on record, the Quintet included such blues classics as \\"I Don't Believe\\" (originally by Bobby Blue Bland) along with the upbeat \\"Hey Little Girl\\" (originally by Texas blues man Frankie Lee Sims) and \\"T-Bone Shuffle\\" (originally by blues giant T-Bone Walker). The Sir Douglas Quintet is considered a pioneering influence in the history of rock and roll for incorporating Tex-Mex and Cajun styles into rock music. However, early influences on the band's emerging Texas style were of course broader than this, and included ethnic and pop music from the 1950s and 1960s, such as doo- wop, electric blues, soul music, and British Invasion. In the mid-1960s, the band relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area and absorbed features of the nascent San Francisco Sound, including the loud and lush electric bass tone and freer percussion and guitar stylings. Band members also explored musical elements specific to modern jazz. For studio recordings, they sometimes added an extra session musician or two, often to flesh out the brass dimension of a track's sound. Good examples of what they produced by absorbing the new jazz and psychedelic elements into their music can be found on the album Sir Douglas Quintet + 2. The lyrics in a Quintet song like \\"The Song of Everything\\" are plainly in the realm of the mystical, whimsical lyrics regarded as one of the characteristics of psychedelic music.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine 2002 All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul,, 3rd edn. Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, , pp. 1322-3 In live performances, blues, often with swing or shuffle beats, was usually a substantial component of the set. Besides doing their own original material, the Quintet revived several classics such as Jimmie Rodgers' \\"In the Jailhouse Now\\" and Freddy Fender's \\"Wasted Days and Wasted Nights\\" to be found on the albums Son of San Antonio (originally on \\"The Best of The Sir Douglas Quintet,\\" 1966) and Texas Fever (originally on \\"The Return of Doug Saldana,\\" 1971), respectively. In 2005 they were among the new class of musicians chosen for the nominating ballot to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. ==Members== Portrait of the Sir Douglas Quintet. (L-R) Johnny Perez, Frank Morin, Augie Meyers, Jack Barber, Doug Sahm. In addition to Sahm and Meyers, original Sir Douglas Quintet members included Jack Barber on bass; Frank Morin on saxophone, trumpet, and keyboards; and Johnny Perez, Ernie Durawa, or T.J. Ritterbach on drums. In 1969 Harvey Kagan joined the Quintet on bass, forming their most familiar line up - Kagan, Morin, Perez, Sahm, and Meyers. Bassist Jim Stallings also contributed to several albums during this period of shifting personnel which included, among others, guitarist Tom Nay of Sarasota, Florida (who played with the group for about a year) and John York, who later replaced Chris Hillman in The Byrds, and contributions from San Antonio crooner/saxophonist Danny Segovia. Sahm and Meyers were later also members of the Texas Tornados (with Freddy Fender and Flaco Jim√©nez) in the early 1990s. In 1972, the group split up when Sahm contracted to produce a solo album. Meyers, Perez, Morin, and Stallings briefly regrouped as The Quintet, with Sonny Farlow taking Sahm's place. In 1973, several Sir Douglas Quintet outtakes were released in their final album from the group's classic era, Rough Edges. Sahm and Meyers continued to work together throughout the late 1970s, and rejoined with Perez in 1980 for a reunion tour and album. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the band was joined by Louie Ortega, formerly of the 1960s band Louie & the Lovers and currently of the Texas Tornados. Founder Doug Sahm died of a heart attack in his sleep in a motel room in Taos, New Mexico, on November 18, 1999, at the age of 58. Johnny Perez owned Topanga Skyline Studios, with \\"the Vibe and the Magic of the '70's.\\" Skyline's grand woodwork, welcoming business culture, and \\"western fort\\" dirt courtyard set the stage for drummer Perez to mentor and inspire generations of young artists - until his death on September 11, 2012 at the age of 69, in a California hospital, from complications of cirrhosis of the liver. Harvey Kagan performed with a San Antonio area wedding/event band, The Oh So Good! Band, best known for discovering American Idol contestant Haley Scarnato. Kagan died on July 5, 2019, aged 73. \\"Harvey Kagan memorial\\", Austin Chronicle, July 21, 2019 Augie Meyers continues to tour, and record on his own independent record labels, based in Bulverde, Texas. Frank Morin remains active in music, with teaching, production, and film soundtracks work. Jim Stallings lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico where he plays bass, guitar, and keyboards at local Pro-Jam sessions. He is also in the process of writing his autobiography with heavy emphasis on his time with the Sir Douglas Quintet and the effect that experience had on his life. ==Selected discographyAlbums=== *1966 - The Best of Sir Douglas Quintet (Tribe) (not a compilation, despite its title) *1968 - Sir Douglas Quintet + 2 = Honkey Blues (Smash) *1969 - Mendocino (Smash) *1970 - Together After Five (Smash) *1970 - 1+1+1=4 (Philips) *1971 - The Return of Doug Salda√±a (Philips) *1972 - Future Tense (as simply The Quintet) without Doug Sahm *1973 - Rough Edges (Mercury) *1975 - Reunion of The Cosmic Brothers (Crazy Cajun) LIVE SDQ with Freddy Fender, Roky Erickson at Armadillo World HQ *1977 - Live Love (Texas Re-Cord Co.) recorded at Armadillo World HQ, Austin, Texas in 1977 *1978 - The Tracker (Crazy Cajun) *1978 - Don Goldie & The Sir Douglas Quintet (Crazy Cajun) *1979 - Wanted: Very Much Alive (Sonet, UK) same 1977 LIVE material as \\"Live Love\\" *1980 - Motive (Mercury, W.

This organoaluminium compound was investigated originally as a co-catalyst for the polymerization of alkenes. ==Properties== Like most organoaluminum compounds, the compound‚Äôs structure is most probably more than that suggested by its empirical formula. A variety of techniques, not including X-ray crystallography, suggest that the compound exists as a dimer and a trimer, consisting of tetrahedral aluminium centers sharing bridging hydride ligands. Hydrides are small and, for aluminium derivatives, are highly basic, thus they bridge in preference to the alkyl groups. DIBAL can be prepared by heating triisobutylaluminium (itself a dimer) to induce beta- hydride elimination: :(i-Bu3Al)2 -> (i-Bu2AlH)2 \\\\+ 2 (CH3)2C=CH2 Although DIBAL can be purchased commercially as a colorless liquid, it is more commonly purchased and dispensed as a solution in an organic solvent such as toluene or hexane. ==Use in organic synthesis== DIBAL is useful in organic synthesis for a variety of reductions, including converting carboxylic acids, their derivatives, and nitriles to aldehydes. DIBAL efficiently reduces Œ±-Œ≤ unsaturated esters to the corresponding allylic alcohol. By contrast, LiAlH4 reduces esters and acyl chlorides to primary alcohols, and nitriles to primary amines [using Fieser work-up procedure]. DIBAL reacts slowly with electron- poor compounds, and more quickly with electron-rich compounds. Thus, it is an electrophilic reducing agent whereas LiAlH4 can be thought of as a nucleophilic reducing agent. Although DIBAL reliably reduces nitriles to aldehydes, the reduction of esters to the same functional group is an infamously finicky reaction which looks useful on paper but often leads to mixtures of alcohol and aldehyde in practice. This problem has been addressed by careful control of the reaction conditions using continuous flow chemistry. ==Safety== DIBAL, like most alkylaluminium compounds, reacts violently with air and water, potentially leading to fires. ==References* Category:Organoaluminium compounds Category:Metal hydrides Category:Reducing agents ","title":"Diisobutylaluminium hydride"},{"id":"2229424","text":"NRX and Zeep buildings, Chalk River Laboratories, 1945. The Ottawa River is behind the reactor buildings. The ZEEP (Zero Energy Experimental Pile) reactor was a nuclear reactor built at the Chalk River Laboratories near Chalk River, Ontario, Canada (which superseded the Montreal Laboratory for nuclear research in Canada). ZEEP first went critical at 15:45 on September 5, 1945. ZEEP's was the first operational nuclear reactor outside the United States. The reactor was designed by Canadian, British and French scientists as a part of an effort to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons during World War II.\\"Canada's Historical Role in Developing Nuclear Weapons\\", Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. It was developed while the Montreal Laboratory and Chalk River Laboratories research facility were under the supervision of the National Research Council of Canada (NRC). ZEEP was instrumental in the development of the NRX and NRU reactors, which led to the development of the successful CANDU reactor.\\"History of Engineering\\", The Canadian Encyclopedia\\"Canada's Nuclear Achievement: Technical and Economic Perspectives\\", IEEE Canada\\"Canadian Engineering Achievements\\", University of Waterloo\\"Candu: The Canadian Nuclear Reactor\\", CBC Digital Archives ZEEP was used to test reactivity effects and other physics parameters needed for reactor development at Chalk River Laboratories, including fuel lattices for the NRU reactor situated next door. ZEEP was one of the world's first heavy water reactors, and it was also designed to use natural (unenriched) uranium; a feature carried through to the CANDU design. Uranium enrichment is a complex and expensive process; thus, the ability to use unenriched uranium gave ZEEP and its descendants a number of distinct advantages. ZEEP continued to be used for basic research until 1970. It was decommissioned in 1973 and dismantled in 1997. In 1966 ZEEP was designated a historic site by Ontario, and commemorated with an historic plaque. Both this plaque and ZEEP itself are now on display at the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa, Canada. ==See also== *Science and technology in Canada *CANDU reactor *Heavy water reactor *AECL *List of nuclear reactors ==References *NRC Archives Photographs - Physics- Atomic Energy Project collection * Atomic Energy of Canada Limited *ZEEP: The Little Reactor that Could (1995) * AECL Public Affairs brochure on ZEEP (1992) * The Canadian Nuclear FAQ Category:Atomic Energy of Canada Limited Category:Nuclear technology Category:Nuclear research reactors ","title":"ZEEP"},{"id":"2229430","text":"During Shrovetide (and especially on Shrove Tuesday, many Christians confess their sins, in preparation for the somber season Lent; depicted is an Evangelical Lutheran confessional in Luther Church (Helsinki, Finland) Many Christian congregations celebrate Shrovetide through pancake breakfasts, which are held on Shrove Monday or Shrove Tuesday. Shrovetide, also known as the Pre-Lenten Season, is the Christian period of preparation before the beginning of the liturgical season of Lent. Shrovetide starts on Septuagesima Sunday, includes Sexagesima Sunday, Quinquagesima Sunday (commonly called Shrove Sunday), as well as Shrove Monday, and culminates on Shrove Tuesday, also known as Mardi Gras. During the season of Shrovetide, it is customary for Christians to ponder what Lenten sacrifices they will make for Lent. Another hallmark of Shrovetide is the opportunity for a last round of merrymaking associated with Carnival before the start of the somber Lenten season. On the final day of the season, Shrove Tuesday, many traditional Christians, such as Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and Roman Catholics, \\"make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs they need to repent, and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to ask God's help in dealing with.\\" During Shrovetide, many churches place a basket in the narthex to collect the previous year's Holy Week palm branches that were blessed and distributed during the Palm Sunday liturgies; on Shrove Tuesday, churches burn these palms to make the ashes used during the services held on the very next day, Ash Wednesday. ==Western churches== In the Roman Rite (pre-1970 form, and today in the Ordinariate (Anglo-Catholic) Form2018 ORDO for the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter, and Extraordinary (Tridentine) Form2016 Ordo for use with the 1962 Missale Romanum Forma Extraordinara, Canons Regular of St John Cantius, Biretta Books, Chicago 2015), and in similar Anglican and Lutheran uses, a pre-Lenten season lasts from Septuagesima Sunday until Shrove Tuesday\\"The season of Septuagesima runs from I vespers of Septuagesima Sunday to compline of Tuesday after Quinquagesima Sunday\\" (1960 Code of Rubrics). and has thus also been known as Shrovetide. The Extraordinary form of the Roman Rite that includes this special period of 17 days refers to it as the season of Septuagesima; the Ordinariate Form uses the term Pre-Lent. The liturgy of the period is characterized by violet vestments (except on feasts), the omission of the Alleluia before the Gospel, and a more penitential mood. Fasting does not commence until the beginning of Lent on Ash Wednesday. The earliest the Pre- Lenten season can begin is January 18 and the latest it can end is March 9. It is absent in the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite and more recent Anglican forms of all these traditions, but may be found in some Lutheran churches who use the One-Year Lectionary to organize the church year. (Candlemas, which can be considered to be the last Christmastime feast, on February 2, can fall in pre-Lent if Easter is early enough. It can never fall in Lent.) In Northern Germany, local tradition states that if \\"sausages and sauerkraut are eaten at Shrovetide, good luck will follow\\". On the last day of Shrovetide, in Bohemia, a man personifies \\"Shrovetide\\" in a procession of masqueraders and whoever is able to snatch straw from his hat and place it under a hen in the coming Spring is said to have eggs that surely will hatch. ==Eastern Churches== In the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, the pre-Lenten season lasts three weeks, beginning on the Sunday of the Publican and the Pharisee and continuing through the Sunday of Forgiveness (the day before the beginning of Great Lent). Since the liturgical day begins at sunset, and Great Lent begins on a Monday, the point at which Great Lent begins is at Vespers on the night of the Sunday of Forgiveness, with a \\"Ceremony of Mutual Forgiveness\\" (in some monasteries, this ceremony is performed at Compline instead of Vespers). Thus begins the first day of the Great Fast, which is known as Clean Monday. The weeks of pre-Lent and Great Lent are anticipatory by nature; they begin on Monday and end on Sunday, each week being named for the theme of the upcoming Sunday. The hymns used during the Pre-Lenten and Lenten seasons are taken from a book called the Triodion. The weeks of the Pre-Lenten Season break are: *Zacchaeus Sunday (Slavic tradition) is sometimes regarded as a pre-Lenten Sunday because of its place in the Slavic lectionary. In that tradition, it is the 11th Sunday before Pascha (Easter). There are no hymns proper to this Sunday, however; its only distinguishing feature is the reading of the Gospel concerning Zacchaeus (). This lectionary reading is sometimes also appointed on the same Sunday in the Byzantine (\\"Greek\\") lectionary, as well. The week following this Sunday is a normal, non-Lenten time, since it falls outside the Triodion. *The Publican and the Pharisee: 10th Sunday before Pascha (70 days). The week following this Sunday is a fast-free week, lest the faithful be tempted, like the Pharisee to boast about fasting. *The Prodigal Son: 9th Sunday before Pascha (63 days). The week following this Sunday is the last during which the laity may eat meat or meat products. The fasting rules for this week are the same as those for non-Lenten periods. *The Last Judgment or Meat-Fare Sunday (the last day meat may be eaten): 8th Sunday before Pascha (56 days). The week following this Sunday is called Cheese-Fare Week and is a fast-free week, with the exception that meat and meat products are forbidden. *Sunday of Forgiveness or Cheese- Fare Sunday: 7th Sunday before Pascha (49 days). This Sunday is the last day dairy products may be consumed. Throughout Great Lent, fish, wine, and olive oil will be allowed only on certain days. ==References== Category:Lent pl:Przedpo≈õcie ","title":"Shrovetide"},{"id":"2229432","text":"Hollywood High School is a four-year public secondary school in the Los Angeles Unified School District, located at the intersection of North Highland Avenue and West Sunset Boulevard in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles, California. ==History== In September 1903, a two-room school was opened on the second floor of an empty storeroom at the Masonic Temple on Highland Avenue, north of Hollywood Boulevard (then Prospect Avenue).

Retrieved January 8, 2019. \\\\- , Mayo Performing Arts Center ==Background== The recitation's genesis was a show that Holbrook performed with his then-wife Ruby in which she would interview him portraying famous people in history, including Twain.Hal Holbrook on PBS.org Holbrook revised the concept into a one-man show in the 1950s, first performing it at the Lock Haven State Teachers College in Pennsylvania in 1954. He made his first New York City appearance as Twain in the Off-Broadway engagement in 1959 and premiered it on Broadway in 1966. Holbrook's performance was first noticed by New York producer John Lotas at The Lambs Club in Manhattan. Lotas presented the show at the Forty-First Street Theatre, where it ran for 174 performances. He won a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play for that appearance and an Emmy Award nomination for the 1967 television broadcast (which was produced by David Susskind) on CBS. The last performance on Broadway was in 2006. Holbrook was known to alternate the material that he performed. The original program from the 1959 Off-Broadway engagement included the note, \\"While Mr. Twain‚Äôs selections will come from the list below, we have been unable to pin him down as to which of them he will do. He claims this would cripple his inspiration. However, he has generously conceded to a printed program for those who are in distress and wish to fan themselves.\\"On Stage, The New York Times Book Co. (1973) This appeared on programs for the show until Holbrook abruptly announced his retirement from the show in September 2017. At the time of his retirement, Holbrook noted that he had been performing under the name \\"Mark Twain\\" 13 years longer than its originator: Samuel Clemens had adopted the pseudonym at age 24 and died at the age of 74. ==The performance== Holbrook performing as Twain at the University of Houston In an interview with William Goldman, Holbrook explained how he structured the show. \\"Who wants to see an evening about a literary figure? I knew that in the first act I had to overcome that natural reluctance, so my biggest desire was to make them laugh their asses off at the start, so they'd go out at intermission and say, 'Hey, this guy's funny.' The second act became the social-comment act. I'd start with some funny material to get them again (but not too much of it, or they'd never stop laughing and take the show right away from you). In the last act I gave them the Twain they'd been expecting all along: warm, whimsical, memories of childhood.\\" Holbrook adapted to concerns that presenting Mark Twain as on an 1890s lecture circuit would use racial slurs acceptable in that era, but unacceptable to modern audiences. Challenging the critics, Holbrook often chose to read a passage from \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" where the orphaned, pipe- smoking, uneducated youngster, Huck, faces a poignant moral dilemma. Holbrook altered the narration to use the dialectally milder \\"Nigra\\" as the young boy wrestles with his conscience over following the law or his heart concerning \\"the widow's Nigra, Jim,\\" a runaway slave. Audiences have embraced this presentation as the boy ultimately rejects the legal, societal and even religious ramifications in favor of helping the runaway on his quest for freedom. It is one of the more somber segments of a usually humorous presentation, which Holbrook has felt important to continue in the spirit of Twain's own message. ==Specials== On the occasion of Clemens's 175th birthday (November 30, 2010), Holbrook performed Mark Twain Tonight! in Elmira, New York, at the Clemens Center in front of a sell-out crowd. April 21, 2010 was the 100th anniversary of his death. The evening began with the singing of happy birthday to Clemens followed by Holbrook's appearance on stage. 2014 marked the 60th consecutive year that Holbrook had performed Mark Twain Tonight!\\"Holbrook's Mark Twain Show Reaches 60th Year\\", Associated Press == See also == *Mark Twain in popular culture *Mark Twain Live!, a similar long- running show by Mike Randall, whom Holbrook sued in the 1970s *Richard Henzel (actor/producer/publisher) Mark Twain in Person - first performed in 1968, has since toured forty states, Canada, and Wales.

Available only as a sedan, it marked the end of Australian production by the Japanese manufacturer. The 380, given the model designation DB, was the successor to the Mitsubishi Magna/Verada line of vehicles first introduced in 1985 (and 1991 for the Verada) but was only available as a sedan. The company spent over A$600 million developing and producing the car, which is heavily based on the ninth generation Mitsubishi Galant designed in the United States. The 380 continued the Mitsubishi Australia tradition of producing front-wheel drive sedans for the Australian market, and along with the Toyota Aurion, competed against the rear-wheel drive Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore vehicles. Even before the car's launch in October 2005, the 380 was stigmatised as the \\"make or break\\" model for Mitsubishi Australia. After a slow sales start, the line-up was updated with the Series II in April 2006, with the entry level model receiving price discount of nearly 20 percent. To generate further interest in the car, a Series III revision came on 29 July 2007 with mainly cosmetic changes. These updates failed to lift sales, and with production still unprofitable, Mitsubishi ceased manufacturing of the 380 in March 2008 after just short of three years in production. A total of 32,044 were produced over the three year production, of which 30,195 were sold in Australia. == Development == The development of the 380 began in 2002, when company executives in Japan gave approval to Mitsubishi Australia to commence work on two closely related vehicles. The first of which was a right-hand drive variant of the ninth generation Mitsubishi Galant, designated the codename PS41. This was to be the replacement for the Magna and Verada. The second, which was planned to be launched in 2007 was a long-wheelbase version known internally as PS41L to be produced in both left- and right-hand drive configurations.Carey, McCarthy (2005), p. 9 However, as Mitsubishi's financial woes worsened, and DaimlerChrysler pulled-out of the DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi alliance, PS41L was abandoned in 2004 and the likelihood of PS41 making it into production looked even more doubtful. Company research conducted in mid-2004 revealed that 84 percent of Australians believed that Mitsubishi would cease production in Australia. To reinstate consumer confidence in the brand, before the launch of the 380, a series of television commercials began airing in December 2004.Carey, McCarthy (2005), p. 10 Centralised around Mitsubishi Australia's then CEO Tom Phillips, the advertisements promoted the introduction of an industry-first five-year/ warranty. Mitsubishi reworked a slogan from former Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca, concluding their commercials with the tagline, \\"if you can find a better-built, better-backed car anywhere, then buy it\\". In total, A$600 million was spent on developing the 380, including $250 million on upgrading the Adelaide production facility to manufacture the vehicle. This included the installation of a new body press, casting the body sides from an individual piece of steel. This has the effect of producing a size differentiation from body-to-body, compared to the industry standard of in 2005.Carey, McCarthy (2005), p. 36 The name 380 was chosen as a fresh start to Mitsubishi's sale of its sole Australian-made vehicle, given that the Magna name was now synonymous of slow-selling vehicle that was long overdue for a replacement. Indeed, among the seven names short-listed from a total of 220, Magna was not one of them. According to then CEO, Tom Phillips, the chosen name polled the best and, at the official launch, he stated \\"'380' conjured up images of high technology, European standards, sophistication and performance with consumers. All of those attributes correlate directly with the positioning of our new car, and when added to the build quality that we are renowned for and a large 3.8-litre engine, '380' was a natural choice for the name of the car\\". === Design === From the very beginning of the project, Mitsubishi had always intended that the PS41 would be set apart from the North American Galant in terms of exterior styling. The problem was that PS41 had to share the same basic foundation and the side profile was to remain for the most part unchanged. A revamp of the Clovelly Park facility allowed for the use of more robust bodies. The consequence of this is the tooling required to produce the panels. This gave Mitsubishi the opportunity to make several low key variances to the design. These came in the form of larger front guards, a revised bonnet, new headlamps as well as grilles and bumpers.Carey, McCarthy (2005), p. 12‚Äì13 The front-end of the PS41 was originally penned by Mitsubishi's design chief, Olivier Boulay. Boulay was also responsible for the 2003 Magna/Verada facelift, but this update fared poorly with buyers. When DaimlerChrysler pulled out of their alliance with Mitsubishi in 2004, it put an end to Boulay-designed Mitsubishis. This allowed for one final chance to progress the exterior design. However, with little more than a year until production, the redesign was shared between Mitsubishi Australia and its parent in Japan. The basic design that was reserved for the base and mid- luxury models was devised by the Japanese studio, whereas the sports oriented design that was conceived locally was reserved for the sports and upper-luxury models within the 380 range.Carey, McCarthy (2005), p. 14 === Engineering === Compared to the Galant, there were changes to 70 percent of the car to create a car more suited to the Australian market. Roads, legislation and consumer preferences were all driving forces behind the changes.Carey, McCarthy (2005), p. 21 The rear of the floorpan had to be overhauled to accommodate a full- sized spare wheel, and superior rear side members were required to improve towing capabilities. Body rigidity was also improved to deal with Australian road conditions. The improved body stiffness resulted in better vehicle dynamics, which were also supported through the use of sophisticated suspension designs, new shock absorbers and stabiliser bars.Carey, McCarthy (2005), p. 22‚Äì23 The 380 was a sedan only and its sole powerplant was an all- new 3.8-litre V6 engine codenamed 6G75, which was also compatible for LPG fuel. Notably, unlike the practice adopted with its predecessor, the 380 sports models (VRX and GT) did not feature a higher output engine relative to other models in the range. The five-speed manual 380 ES (a five-speed sequential automatic was optional on the ES) was actually the fastest vehicle in the range. The new and engine was capable of propelling the car from in 7.6 seconds. Because of the choice of gear ratios, the manual and automatic transmission equipped 380s had the same acceleration figures. == Models == Rear-view of the original base 380 Interior of the DB Series II 380 SXBetween September 2005 and January 2008, the 380 was produced and marketed in three series, as listed below. === DB (2005‚Äì2006) === The 380 went on sale on 13 October 2005. The range consisted of a 380 base model, the LS, LX, VRX and GT models. Standard equipment included: twin front and side airbags, climate control air-conditioning, cruise control, power windows, trip computer, steering wheel audio controls, and Bosch 8.0 anti-lock braking system. There was also a Limited Edition sold from September 2005 and into 2006. === DB Series II (2006‚Äì2007) === On 28 April 2006, Mitsubishi announced price reductions with the introduction of the Series II upgrade. The entry model, now called the ES, was reduced from A$34,490 to $27,990. An SX model was introduced, priced at $32,990, while the LS model was dropped. Prices on VRX, LX, and GT models were also reduced by amounts ranging from $1,500 to $3,000. Mitsubishi announced that up to 1,500 retail customers who paid the old price would be eligible for a factory rebate of up to $2,000. There were essentially no mechanical or visual changes. The 380 received the 2005 Australia's Best Cars Large Car award, as well as Insurance Australia Group's rating as the most secure Australian family car, Safest Australian Car Built 2006 for its four-star ANCAP result, Best Fleet Car by Delivery Australia magazine, and Lowest Running Costs in the Australian Motoring Clubs Report. The 3.8-litre engine won an award for engineering excellence from the Society of Automotive Engineers. ===DB Series III (2007‚Äì2008)=== Mid-July 2007 saw the release of the 380 Series III, with range and price alterations designed to attract further sales and increase private buyer interest. The price of the ES model rose by $1000 but was compensated for by the addition of alloy wheels, fog lights and traction control. A total of four models comprised this range: ES, SX, VRX, and GT. Unlike the Series II, the new series saw all models received subtle visual and trim changes. Available with either a five-speed manual or automatic transmission, standard features on the ES included traction control, front and side air bags, automatic climate control air conditioning, power mirrors, power windows, power driver's seat, steering wheel-mounted remote audio controls, and anti-lock brakes with electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD). Also featured in the ES were alloy wheels and sports front bumper treatment with front fog lamps. Next in the range, the auto-only SX adds sports seats with a unique grey trim, leather steering wheel, six-disc CD stereo with multifunction colour LCD display, sports rear bumper, 17-inch alloy wheels and sports-tuned suspension. The VRX featured a more comprehensive sports styling package, adding charcoal accents on the front and rear bumpers, high-profile rear wing, polished and painted 17-inch alloy wheels. Inside the VRX, blue seat fabric was added, as well as \\"VRX\\" embroidery on the front seats. Embroidered, silver-stitched leather was available as an option. The VRX was available with a five-speed manual or automatic transmission. The range-topping and automatic-only GT model featured standard leather trim, painted and polished 17-inch alloy wheels, integrated boot spoiler and chrome boot garnish, and side rubbing strips. Mitsubishi offer a no-cost luxury option for the GT, aptly titled the GTL. The GTL sported a more conservative rear light treatment, silver-painted alloy wheels, sunroof and a beige-on-black interior treatment. At the Series III launch, Mitsubishi released two special edition variants. The Sports Edition, based on the ES, added 17-inch alloy wheels, high-profile rear wing, sports-tuned suspension, black interior trim and sunroof, for no extra cost. The 380 VRX \\"Fusion Burst\\" was based on the VRX and comes in a limited-edition orange hue. Apart from the colour, the Fusion Burst came with sunroof and matching seat fabric for no extra cost. === TMR 380 === Team Mitsubishi Ralliart (TMR) is an independent motorsport outfit that has also been affiliated with Mitsubishi Motors Australia to market higher performance model variants of the standard Mitsubishi range (in the same mould as FPV, HSV and TRD for Ford, Holden and Toyota Australia, respectively). In 2008, TMR produced the TMR380, a performance-enhanced version of the Series III 380 VRX model on which it was based. It was powered by a supercharged version of the standard 3.8-litre V6 engine, now producing and . The car was claimed to take six seconds over the sprint and was sold exclusively painted in TMR Red with a full body kit, 19-inch chrome alloy wheels and twin chrome exhaust tips. Its retail price was A$56,990, lower than its direct rival, the TRD Aurion). In total, 15 units had already been assembled at TMR's Dandenong facilities with another five on the way from Adelaide for conversion, when Mitsubishi Motors Australia announced the end of local production. All 20 models are individually numbered. == Production and sales == Tyre bay information for the last two 380s built. Vehicle 017 is on display at the National Motor Museum in Birdwood, South Australia. Vehicle 018 was sold at auction with proceeds going to charity. As a consequence of the first DB series selling in fewer numbers than expected, on 20 January 2006, Mitsubishi Australia announced that voluntary redundancies would be offered to 250 production employees to bring production in line with customer demand. In March 2006 the manufacturing plant closed for three weeks. Apart from launching limited editions (essentially base models with greater equipment levels), Mitsubishi took the drastic steps of applying significant price reductions for both the Series II and Series III. One of several export 380s owned by the government of Brunei. While the 380 was exported to other countries in small numbers, in the interest of salvaging local production, Mitsubishi Australia had also entered into negotiations with Proton of Malaysia over the possibility for a large export program. Under this program, a rebadged 380 would have replaced the Proton Perdana executive model, however, this deal never succeeded. On 5 February 2008 Mitsubishi Motors Australia announced that the Clovelly Park plant would be shut down on 31 March, and Mitsubishi would pursue a \\"full import strategy\\" for the Australian market due to unviable 380 sales. The last 380 sedan (a silver Platinum Limited Edition, body number 32044) left the production line on 27 March 2008. The car was auctioned in late April 2008, with the $100,000 final price being donated to charities chosen in consultation with the winning bidder, a car dealership based in Western Australia. The similar second to last vehicle is exhibited at the Birdwood Motor Museum. In October 2009, the president of Mitsubishi Motors, Osama Masuko revealed in hindsight that it \\"was good that we closed the plant in March 2008 because this was the time the economy was still good and employees could find reemployment.\\" ;Production and sales data {  style=\\"font-size:90%; text-align:center\\" - ! style=\\"width:10em\\"  Year ! style=\\"width:15em\\"  Production ! style=\\"width:15em\\"  Sales (Australia) -  2005  11,077  3,548 -  2006  10,560  12,423 -  2007  10,230  10,942 -  2008  177  3,272 -  2009  -  10 -  2010  -  1 - Total 32,044 30,196 } The 380 was also sold in New Zealand. https://www.nzherald.co.nz/motoring/news/article.cfm?c_id=9&objectid;=10491244 == Notes  References == * * Mitsubishi 380 Workshop Manual (pdf) https://www.demonoid.pw/files/details/3648543/ Category:Cars of Australia Category:Front-wheel-drive vehicles #380 Category:Sedans Category:Cars introduced in 2005 ","title":"Mitsubishi 380"},{"id":"2229473","text":"' (Oh God, how much heartache), 3', is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He composed the chorale cantata in Leipzig for the Second Sunday after Epiphany and first performed it on 14 January 1725. It is based on the hymn published by Martin Moller in 1587. Bach composed the cantata in his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig as part of cantata cycle of chorale cantatas, for the second Sunday after Epiphany. The work is based on a hymn without evident connection to the prescribed readings. It is a meditation on Jesus as a comforter in distress, based on a medieval model. An unknown librettist reworked the ideas of the 18 stanzas in six movements, retaining the words of stanzas 1, 2 and 18 as movements 1, 2 and 6. Similarly, Bach retained the choral melody in three movements, set as a chorale fantasia in the opening chorus with the bass singing the cantus firmus, as a four-part setting with interspersed recitatives in the second movement, and in the closing chorale. He scored the cantata for two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo, with an added trobone to support the bass in the first movement, and a horn to support the soprano in the last movement. == History and words == Bach composed the cantata in his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig as part of his second annual cycle, planned to consist only of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. He wrote the cantata for the Second Sunday after Epiphany. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the Epistle to the Romans (we have several gifts ‚Äì ) and from the Gospel of John (the Marriage at Cana ‚Äì ). The cantata is a chorale cantata based on the hymn \\"\\" in 18 stanzas attributed to Martin Moller (1587). It is a paraphrase of the Latin \\"\\", a medieval hymn attributed to Bernard of Clairvaux, a meditation on Jesus as a comforter and helper in distress.C. S. Terry and D. Litti, Bach's Cantata Libretti, Journal of the Royal Musical Association 1917 44(1):71‚Äì125; The unknown librettist retained the words of stanzas 1, 2 and 18 as movements 1, 2 and 6. In movement 2, stanza 2 is expanded by paraphrases of stanzas 3‚Äì5, while movement 3 is a paraphrase of stanza 6; movement 4 incorporates ideas from stanzas 7‚Äì14, and movement 5 relies on stanzas 15 and 16.In movement 2, stanza 2 is expanded by paraphrases of stanzas 3‚Äì5. Movement 3 is a paraphrase of stanza 6. Movement 4 incorporates ideas from stanzas 7‚Äì14. Movement 5 relies on stanzas 15 and 16. The poet did not relate his text to the reading from John 1:2. Bach led the first performance of the cantata on 14 January 1725. == Scoring and structure == Bach structured the cantata in six movements. An opening chorus and a closing chorale frame a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. The first recitative is unusual: the chorus sings one line of the hymn's four lines, continued each time by a soloist in words of the poet. The last aria is a duet. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), bass (B)), a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of horn (Co) to double the cantus firmus in the closing chorale, trombone (Tb) to reinforce the bass in the opening chorus, two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. The autograph score bears the title: \\"Dominica 2 post Epiphanias / Ach Gott! Wie manches Hertzeleyd. / √† / 4 Voci. / 2 Hautb: d'Amour / 2 Violini / Viola. / e Continuo / di J. S. Bach\\", which means \\"Sunday 2 after Epiphany ... for four voices, 2 oboes d'amore, 2 violins, viola and continuo by J. S. Bach\\". In the following table of the movements, the scoring and keys follow the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from the book on all cantatas by the Bach scholar Alfred D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, played throughout, is not shown. == Music == Bach uses a melody of \\"\\" which appeared first in the Lochamer-Liederbuch. The melody appears in the opening chorus, sung by the bass as a cantus firmus, in the second movement, as a four-part setting with interspersed recitatives, and in the closing chorale. === 1 === John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage, in 2007 In the opening chorus, \\"\\" (Ah, God, how much heartache), the cantus firmus is in the bass, which is doubled by the trombone, as in . Its mood of lamentation is supported by \\"elegiac sounds\\" of the oboes d'amore, sighing motifs in the strings, and the upper voices reflecting the oboe motifs. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes that Bach used a repeated motif of six notes in chromatic descent, which is often used in chaconnes of the Baroque opera to express grief. The motif is used for the instrumental opening, each entry of a voice, interludes and conclusion. === 2 === The recitative, \\"\\" (How difficult it is for flesh and blood), combines the hymn tune sung by the four-part choir, with interpolated text sung by the soloists in turn. The lines of the hymn are separated by a joyful ostinato motif derived from the chorale tune. The musicologist Julian Mincham writes that the \\"hybrid recitative provides an excellent example of Bach's experiments of investing long texts with sustained musical interest\\". === 3 === The bass aria, \\"\\" (Although I experience the fear and torment of Hell), is accompanied by the continuo. It expresses the contrast of (hell's anguish) and (heaven of joy), with inestimable sorrows () disappearing into light mist (). === 4 === A tenor recitative, \\"\\" (My body and spirit might despair), expresses trust in Jesus to overcome despair. === 5 === In the duet for soprano and alto, \\"\\" (When cares press upon me), in \\"bright E major\\", as the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff writes, the voices are embedded in a \\"dense quartet texture\\". He concludes that the movement \\"banishes human care by means of joyful singing\\". The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that the obbligato motif, which is later picked up by the voices, is played by the oboes d'amore and violin in unison, providing \\"a new and remarkable tone colour\\". Bach refers to the Cross, as mentioned in the text, by using a cross- motif in the melody and applying double sharp marked by a cross. The voices intensify words such as \\"dringen\\" (press) and \\"singen\\" (sing) by extended coloraturas. === 6 === The closing chorale, \\"\\" (If my heart remains pure in faith), is a four-part setting. The choral melody, now in the soprano, is reinforced by a horn. == Recordings == The selection is taken from the listing on the Bach-Cantatas website. == References  External links == * * Ach Gott, wie manches Herzeleid BWV 3; BC A 33 / Chorale cantata (2nd Sunday of Epiphany) Bach Digital * BWV 3 Ach Gott, wie manches Herzeleid English translation.

It was designed by Steve Chilton for architects Marks Barfield and engineered by Halcrow. It replaced an old concrete footbridge which was probably built for the British Empire Exhibition. The project also included the construction of a public square. The bridge's name was chosen in May 2005, after a BBC Five Live poll. It is named after a grey (though appearing white in old black and white photographs and films) Metropolitan Police horse, named 'Billy', that was used to restore order after the huge numbers of spectators (estimated at between 200,000 and 300,000) who turned up to witness the 1923 FA Cup Final spilled onto the pitch before kick off. That game, the first to be held at the old Wembley Stadium, was won by Bolton Wanderers, beating West Ham United 2‚Äì0. Unlike the old footbridge, the new structure was designed to cope with up to 12,000 people an hour, the estimated number of users during match days. The bridge and square opened in 2008. They now give easy access from the Chiltern Line to London Designer Outlet. The White Horse Bridge at night == Naming == In May 2005, the naming decision took place in the form of an online poll hosted by BBC Five Live, in conjunction with the London Development Agency (who were building the bridge and who had conceived the idea of a public poll), and won from a shortlist of Live Aid bridge (in memory of the 1985 concert held at the stadium), Sir Alf Ramsey (being England's World Cup winning manager), Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Geoff Hurst (two of Sir Alf's team). The LDA received over 670,000 nominations from all over the world. The name with the most nominations, however, mainly coming from Germany, was Dietmar Hamann, who scored the last goal at the old Wembley Stadium. This was a qualification game in October 2000 for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, with a German 1‚Äì0 win against England (2000 England v Germany football match). The LDA decided to name the bridge White Horse Bridge instead. == See also == *List of bridges in London ==References== Category:Pedestrian bridges in London Category:History of the Metropolitan Police Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Brent Category:Bridges completed in 2006 Category:Wembley Stadium and Wembley Arena ","title":"White Horse Bridge"},{"id":"2229490","text":"State Route 839 (SR 839) is an road that runs from the Nevada Scheelite Mine to U.S. Route 50.

He won three elections. Wilson resigned during his third term to become the director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah where he held an adjunct assistant professorship of Political Science. His terms were noted by an election in May, 1979 to change the five member commission form of government to a mayor/council form. This initiative was created by a city scandal involving the take-over of the city personnel department by the chief of police. Other highlights of Wilson's administration included re- construction of the Salt Lake City International Airport, re-building the city's sewage treatment plant, re-tooling the water system, and expanding the green space of the city's parks department. Wilson also initiated and passed the first historical and foothill preservation ordinances in the city's history. Currently, Wilson is the Executive Director of the Utah Rivers Council, a Utah-based environmental organization. == Partial biography == Ted Wilson was born May 18, 1939, in Salt Lake City, Utah.
