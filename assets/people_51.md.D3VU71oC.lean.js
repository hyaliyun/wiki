In Government Order Ms. No. 1835, Health, dated 29 November 1955, the government of Andhra passed orders to establish a medical college, the third one in the state at Kurnool. As the building was not ready for the college the government decided to admit 50 students intended for Kurnool Medical College at Kurnool City in July 1956. When Andhra Pradesh was formed and the capital was shifted to Hyderabad from Kurnool the erstwhile secretariat building was handed over to the college. The college was opened on 21 July 1956 by Sri T.T. Krishnamachari, the then Finance Minister of India. Fifty students were admitted to the M.B.B.S. course. Dr. C.

In accordance with Macau Basic Law, since the transfer of sovereignty over Macau on 20 December 1999, this passport has been issued by the Identification Services Bureau (under the Secretariat for Administration and Justice) of the government of Macau under the prerogative of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The official languages of Macau are Portuguese and Chinese; consequently, all the passport's text is in traditional Chinese characters, Portuguese, and English. == Historical background == According to the nationality law of the People's Republic of China and the explanations given for some questions by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress concerning the implementation of nationality law in Macau, any Macau permanent resident holding Chinese nationality can apply for the Macau SAR passport. Many residents of Macau also possess Portuguese citizenship by virtue of being born in Macau before 3 October 1981, naturalization, or being born to parents with Portuguese citizenship in Macau. Such citizens are also eligible for, and often hold, a Portuguese passport, which grants more visa-free countries than the MSAR passport as well as permitting free movement of passport holders in the European Union. == Physical features == The 2nd version of the passport, a biometric passport, was first issued by the Identification Services Bureau at the start of September 2009, replacing the previous machine-readable type. The cover of the passport is coloured bottle green with the National Emblem of the People's Republic of China emblazoned centermost at the front. The passport's front cover is inscribed with the titles of the PRC and the SAR in ; and . Each passport consists of 48 numbered pages of size emprinted with artistic designs featuring Macau's world culture heritage sites. Besides personal data, the supplemental page of passport is printed with the picture and fingerprint of that holder. == Application procedure == Macau SAR passports are only issued by the Identification Services Bureau in Macau.refer to the web site of DSI An applicant must fill out an application form possess a Macau SAR Permanent Resident Identity Card and two recent 1½-inch colour photos along with (if replacing an old passport) their prior Macau SAR Passport. Qualified applicants can apply in Macau or overseas if necessary. == Use  Mainland China === Although MSAR passport is endorsed by Chinese government, the Ministry of Public Security does not accept MSAR passports for traveling between the mainland and Macau, since both mainland and Macau authorities agreed that using a passport for 'domestic' travel is 'unnecessary' and 'inappropriate'. However, those who are eligible for a Macau SAR passport are also eligible to apply for a Mainland Travel Permit for Hong Kong and Macao Residents (colloquially known as a Home Return Permit through the Chinese Ministry of Public Security (MPS) which serves as a travel document to travel to the mainland, which is represented in Macau by the China Travel Service. The issuance is entirely at the discretion of the MPS, and so the possession of a Macau SAR passport does not necessarily guarantee the issuing of a Home Return Permit. Macao residents who travel to the mainland from a third country without Home Return Permit may obtain Chinese Travel Document from the overseas Chinese embassies or consulates prior to travel. === Hong Kong === Regardless of their citizenship status, Macau permanent residents do not need passports to enter Hong Kong. Instead, residents must bring their permanent ID card, which grants 180-day visa free access to Hong Kong. Non-permanent residents can use a Visit Permit for Residents of Macao to HKSAR to enter Hong Kong for up to 30 days visa-free === Overseas === According to Macau's Identity Services Bureau, as of January 2018 Macau SAR passport holders enjoy visa-free access to 136 countries and territories worldwide, including all Member States of the European Union, Brazil, Japan, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea. According to the Henley Passport Index, in 2019 the Macau SAR passport was ranked as the 36th most powerful passport worldwide; in contrast, the Hong Kong SAR passport was ranked 19th, while the PRC passport was ranked 74th. As Chinese citizens, holders of a Macau Special Administrative Region passport are entitled to full consular protection by Chinese foreign missions abroad. Macau SAR passport holders may undertake a paid activity (i.e. work) visa-free for a maximum of 90 days within a 180-day period in the Schengen Agreement signatory states of Belgium, Denmark, Iceland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia and Sweden (though not in Portugal). In Switzerland, another Schengen signatory state, Macao SAR passport holders can apply for a permit for \\"gainful occupation\\" of maximum 8 days in a calendar year during their visa-exempt stay without needing to apply for a work visa; however, this 8-day exemption does not cover occupation in the primary or secondary construction industry, civil engineering, catering and hotel services, industrial and private cleaning industries, surveillance and security services, and sex industry. Alternatively, if in possession of a long term residence permit issued by any other Schengen member state, a Macau SAR passport holder may undertake gainful occupation for up to 3 months visa-free in Switzerland without any of the aforementioned industry restrictions. In Croatia (a European Union member state but not a Schengen agreement signatory state), Macao SAR passport holders may undertake a paid activity (i.e. work) visa-free for a maximum of 90 days within a 180-day period. Macau SAR passport holders aged between 18 and 30 are eligible to apply under the Working Holiday Scheme by the New Zealand Government. If successful, a visa is issued which permits the holder to spend up to 12 months in New Zealand for the primary purpose of travel but allowing for supplementary short-term employment or study. The scheme is highly competitive as applicants from Macau and Mainland China are subject to a quota of 1000 visas annually (there is a separate quota for Hong Kong applicants). On 10 April 2013, the Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, announced that, starting from 2015, holders of Macao SAR e-passports (along with Hong Kong SAR and PRC passport holders) would be able to use SmartGates in Australia on a trial basis. The three passports were permanently included in the list of eligible nationalities in June 2016. == See also == * Visa policy of Macau * Visa requirements for Chinese citizens of Macau == References  External links == * Macau SAR Identification Department * Macau SAR Government Portal Category:Chinese passports Category:Government of Macau Category:Tourism in Macau Category:Macau society ","title":"Macao Special Administrative Region passport"},{"id":"6194817","text":"Alpthal is a village and municipality in Schwyz District in the canton of Schwyz in Switzerland.

This image is in the public domain. Isabel Clifton Cookson (25 December 1893 – 1 July 1973) was an Australian botanist who specialised in palaeobotany and palynology. == Early years and education == Cookson was born at Hawthorn, Victoria, and attended the Methodist Ladies' College at Kew where she gained honours in anatomy, physiology and botany in the senior public examination. Cookson went on to study for her BSc at the University of Melbourne and graduated in 1916 with majors in botany and zoology. == Career == When she completed her studies she became a demonstrator at the university, and between 1916 and 1917 received a government research scholarship and the MacBain research scholarship in biology, amongst other awards to study the flora of the Northern Territory. She contributed illustrations for the 1917 book The Flora of the Northern Territory by Alfred J. Ewart and O. B. Davies.Australian National Botanic Garden. Cookson, Isabel Clifton (1893–1973) She continued working at the University of Melbourne, until she visited the Imperial College of Science and Technology between 1925 and 1926, and, on a return visit in the University of Manchester between 1926 and 1927. At Manchester she began a long and productive academic relationship with W. H. Lang, Lang named the genus Cooksonia in her honour. From 1929 her research focussed on palaeobotany, she wrote several papers on fossil plants including early vascular plants from the Silurian and Early Devonian which helped to shape theories of early land-plant evolution.Mary E. Dettmann, Cookson, Isabel Clifton (1893–1973), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 13, Melbourne University Press, 1993, pp 491–492. She also studied more recent coal forming deposits. Her work on the early terrestrial fossil plants of Victoria and field work showing associated graptolites and plants led to her research thesis and to a D.Sc. from the University of Melbourne in 1932.Botanical Society of America. The Isabel Cookson Award In 1930 she was appointed lecturer in botany at the University of Melbourne. From the 1940s she worked on fossil spores, pollen and phytoplankton and their relationship with palaeogeography and championed the usefulness of plant microfossils for oil exploration. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research established in 1949 a pollen research unit under her leadership. In 1952 she was appointed a research fellow in botany, and retired in 1959. She was active in her retirement, 30 of her 86 scientific papers were published after 1959. Since 1976 the Botanical Society of America has awarded the Isabel Cookson Award to the best paper on palaeobotany presented at their annual meeting at the bequest of Cookson.

It is considered that intravascular administration (e.g. IV) does not involve absorption, and there is no loss of drug.Kaplan Pharmacology 2010, page6, Absorption The fastest route of absorption is inhalation, and not as mistakenly considered the intravenous administration.Kaplan Pharmacology 2010, Video Lectues, Absorption chapter Absorption is a primary focus in drug development and medicinal chemistry, since the drug must be absorbed before any medicinal effects can take place. Moreover, the drug's pharmacokinetic profile can be easily and significantly changed by adjusting factors that affect absorption. ==Dissolution== In the most common situation, a tablet is ingested and passes through the esophagus to the stomach. The rate of dissolution is a key target for controlling the duration of a drug's effect, and as such, several dosage forms that contain the same active ingredient may be available, differing only in the rate of dissolution. If a drug is supplied in a form that is not readily dissolved, the drug may be released more gradually over time with a longer duration of action. Having a longer duration of action may improve compliance since the medication will not have to be taken as often. Additionally, slow-release dosage forms may maintain concentrations within an acceptable therapeutic range over a long period of time, as opposed is quick- release dosage forms which may result in sharper peaks and troughs in serum concentrations. The rate of dissolution is described by the Noyes–Whitney equation as shown below: :\\\\frac{dW}{dt} = \\\\frac{DA(C_{s}-C)}{L} Where: *\\\\frac{dW}{dt} is the rate of dissolution. *A is the surface area of the solid. *C is the concentration of the solid in the bulk dissolution medium. *C_{s} is the concentration of the solid in the diffusion layer surrounding the solid. *D is the diffusion coefficient. *L is the diffusion layer thickness. As can be inferred by the Noyes-Whitney equation, the rate of dissolution may be modified primarily by altering the surface area of the solid. The surface area may be adjusted by altering the particle size (e.g. micronization). For many drugs, reducing the particle size leads to a reduction in the dose that is required to achieve the same therapeutic effect. The reduction of particle size increases the specific surface area and the dissolution rate, and it does not affect solubility. The rate of dissolution may also be altered by choosing a suitable polymorph of a compound. Different polymorphs exhibit different solubility and dissolution rate characteristics. Specifically, crystalline forms dissolve slower than amorphous forms, since crystalline forms require more energy to leave lattice during dissolution. The most stable crystalline polymorph has the lowest dissolution rate. Dissolution is also different for anhydrous and hydrous forms of a drug. Anhydrous often dissolve faster than hydrated; however, anhydrous forms sometimes exhibit lower solubility. Chemical modification by esterification is also used to control solubility. For example, stearate and estolate esters of a drug have decreased solubility in gastric fluid. Later, esterases in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) wall and blood hydrolyze these esters to release the parent drug. Also, coatings on a tablet or a pellet may act as a barrier to reduce the rate of dissolution. Coating may also be used to modify where dissolution takes place. For example, enteric coatings may be applied to a drug, so that the coating only dissolves in the basic environment of the intestines. This will prevent release of the drug before reaching the intestines. Since solutions are already dissolved, they do not need to undergo dissolution before being absorbed. Lipid-soluble drugs are less absorbed than water-soluble drugs, especially when they are enteral. ==Ionization== The gastrointestinal tract is lined with epithelial cells. Drugs must pass or permeate through these cells in order to be absorbed into the circulatory system. One particular cellular barrier that may prevent absorption of a given drug is the cell membrane. Cell membranes are essentially lipid bilayers which form a semipermeable membrane. Pure lipid bilayers are generally permeable only to small, uncharged solutes. Hence, whether or not a molecule is ionized will affect its absorption, since ionic molecules are charged. Solubility favors charged species, and permeability favors neutral species. Some molecules have special exchange proteins and channels to facilitate movement from the lumen into the circulation. Ions cannot passively diffuse through the gastrointestinal tract because the epithelial cell membrane is made up of a phospholipid bilayer. The bilayer is made up of two layers of phospholipids in which the charged hydrophilic heads face outwards and the non-charged hydrophobic fatty acid chains are in the middle of the layer. The uncharged fatty acid chains repel ionized, charged molecules. This means that the ionized molecules cannot pass through the intestinal membrane and be absorbed. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation offers a way to determine the proportion of a substance that is ionized at a given pH. In the stomach, drugs that are weak acids (such as aspirin) will be present mainly in their non-ionic form, and weak bases will be in their ionic form. Since non-ionic species diffuse more readily through cell membranes, weak acids will have a higher absorption in the highly acidic stomach. However, the reverse is true in the basic environment of the intestines—weak bases (such as caffeine) will diffuse more readily since they will be non-ionic. This aspect of absorption has been targeted by medicinal chemists. For example, a suitable analog may be chosen so that the drug is more likely to be in a non-ionic form. Also, prodrugs of a compound may be developed by medicinal chemists—these chemical variants may be more readily absorbed and then metabolized by the body into the active compound. However, changing the structure of a molecule is less predictable than altering dissolution properties, since changes in chemical structure may affect the pharmacodynamic properties of a drug. The solubility and the permeability of a substance that is a potential drug candidate are important physicochemical properties the scientist wants to know as early as possible W. Curatolo, Physical chemical properties of oral drug candidates in the discovery and exploratory development settings.

Born in La Paz, Adolfo Ballivián was the son of former Bolivian President and war hero José Ballivián. Widely traveled, he was a member of the armed forces, orator, composer, writer, and congressman. Having joined the army at the age of 16, he combatted under the command of his father against insurgent forces. Nonetheless, he was forced to flee Bolivia and lived abroad since 1847, when his father was toppled from power and exiled, first to Chile and then to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. While traveling in Valparaíso, Chile, he met and married Carmen Grimwood Allende, of Quillota, Chile. Following his father's unexpected death in Brazil in 1855, Ballivián Coll returned to his native land. At first he attempted to rejoin the army and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Discouraged from continuing a military career (many mistrusted him for his obvious charisma, education, and potential to become a rival in an era of military supremacy in politics), he was persuaded to run for Congress instead. There he first shone as a brilliant orator and gifted defender of constitutionalism and the rule of law. He also became a part-time journalist. Adolfo Ballivián chose to absent himself again when in 1872 the president, General Agustín Morales, began to quarrel with the legislative and the media and hinted that he (Morales) may arrogate to himself supreme dictatorial powers. Ballivián was still in Europe when Congress and the Constitutionalist forces invoked his name as their official candidate in the 1873 elections, called hastily upon the assassination of President Morales. To his surprise, he was elected president overwhelmingly in what were possibly the cleanest elections up to that point in Bolivian history. Returning to Bolivia, he was sworn in and presented with the presidential sash by his predecessor, Tomás Frías Ametller, on May 9, 1873. At that point Ballivián became the youngest Bolivian president to date, having followed precisely the oldest (Frías). The young chief executive benefited from a short \\"honeymoon\\" period and then faced the customary obdurate, obstructionist opposition of factionalist politicians. It did not help that his short term in office coincided with a global fall in the price of silver, hitherto Bolivia's most important export alongside tin. It was in this context that Congress denied Ballivián's urgent request to buy new warships from Europe in order to re-equip the fledgling, almost non- existent Bolivian Navy, in view of mounting challenges to Bolivian sovereignty in the Pacific by Chile. This congressional denial would be rued by Bolivians in subsequent years, when war finally erupted. Still, Ballivián managed to rule in a rational and enlightened manner, above all adhering to democratic precepts, evincing a strict respect for the rule of law, and allowing full personal freedoms and the operation of an unfettered press. Tragically, President Adolfo Ballivián was stricken with stomach cancer within months of coming to power, and died at the age of 43 on February 14, 1874. He was constitutionally succeeded by Dr. Tomás Frías, the same man who had transferred power to him only 9 months earlier. Grimwood, the paternal surname of Adolfo Ballivián's wife, and maternal surname of their children, is often misspelled Greenwood in genealogical resources such as FamilySearch.org ==References * Category:Presidents of Bolivia Category:Deaths from stomach cancer Category:1831 births Category:1874 deaths Category:Deaths from cancer in Bolivia Category:People from La Paz Category:Bolivian expatriates in Chile Category:Bolivian expatriates in Brazil Category:Bolivian military personnel Category:Children of national leaders Category:People who died in office ","title":"Adolfo Ballivián"},{"id":"6194888","text":"Mindrot was an American extreme metal band formed in 1989 by Adrian Leroux and Matt Fisher in Orange County, California, United States. They disbanded in 1998. ==Biography== The band began in 1989 in Westminster, California. After a year of rehearsal and lineup adjustments, the band held a demo release in a living room in Huntington Beach, California with Glycine Max in June 1990. Shows would follow with other notable bands; Born Against, Rorschach, Neurosis, Bolt Thrower, Grave, Nausea, and Voodoo Glow Skulls. The band next recorded the Endeavor EP and released it through a double-label, Tempest Records and Angry Thoreauan, following with a split 7\\" with a band called Apocalypse (not to be confused with the more notable band also called Apocalypse). In 1992, the first major line-up change came with the addition of long time friend Evan Kilbourne on drums, with whom they recorded Live in the Studio (produced by Jim Barnes, who also produced Dawning and Soul) . In late 1992, Faded Dream was recorded, and was used to shop the band to record labels. One record label wanted to release \\"Faded Dream\\", but the band wanted to re-record some parts for better sound quality. That record label did not want to spend any money on the recording and thus it was never properly released. In 1994, another line-up change occurred. Matt Parrillo decided it would be in his best interests to leave the band and pursue his other band Dystopia as well as his graphic arts career. He was replaced by John Flood, another good friend with the band (as well as one of Matt Fisher's former bandmates in Rupture, which went on to become Confrontation). Forlorn was released in 1995, followed by Dawning. Relapse Records and Nuclear Blast Records ended their business relationship with each other, ending European distribution for Dawning. After the release of Soul, in early 1998 Mindrot played its last show, unknown to anyone there or even anyone in the band. It took place at Club Mesa in Costa Mesa, California with Oxbow. No more than 30 people were in attendance included in the audience guitarist and SST mastermind Greg Ginn. The band ostensibly broke up when Evan Kilbourne decided to pursue other musical interests in Save Ferris. ==Members== 1989–1992 *Adrian Leroux, vocals *Matt Fisher, Bass *Dan Kaufman, Guitar *Matt Parrillo, Guitar *Al Higdon, drums 1992–1994 *Adrian Leroux, vocals *Matt Fisher, Bass *Dan Kaufman, Guitar *Matt Parrillo, Guitar *Evan Kilbourne, drums 1994–1998 *Adrian Leroux, vocals *Matt Fisher, Bass *Dan Kaufman, Guitar *John Flood, Guitar *Evan Kilbourne, drums ==DiscographyDemos=== *Untitled (1990) *Live in the Studio (1992) *Faded Dream (1992) ===Singles=== *\\"Endeavor\\" (1991) *Mindrot/Apocalypse Split 7\\" (1992) ===Albums and ePs=== *Forlorn EP (1995) *Dawning (1995) *Soul (1998) ==Related bands== *Eyes of Fire (Century Media), featuring: Dan Kaufman (Guitar and vocals) and Matt Fisher (Bass and vocals) *Save Ferris (Epic Records), featuring: Evan Kilbourne (drums) *Dystopia (Life is Abuse), featuring: Matt (Mauz) Parrillo (Guitar and vocals), Dan Kaufman (vocals) *Morgion (Relapse Records), featuring: Adrian Leroux (vocals during the \\"Doomination of Europe\\" tour in 2003) ==References *Official Site *Mindrot on MusicMight *Mindrot on Artist Direct * Category:Heavy metal musical groups from California Category:American doom metal musical groups Category:Relapse Records artists Category:Musical groups established in 1989 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1998 Category:Musical groups from Orange County, California Category:Musical quintets Category:People from Westminster, California ","title":"Mindrot"},{"id":"6194895","text":"Baron Holmes was a title that was created twice in the Peerage of Ireland.

The French victories against the larger cities of the swiss plateau led to the creation of the French supported Helvetic Republic on 12 April 1798. Following the declaration of the Republic, the Cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden rejected it and raised an army to fight the French. Under Alois von Reding they were able to raise about 10,000 men. This army was deployed along the defensive line from Napf to Rapperswil. General Reding besieged French controlled Lucerne and marched across the Brünig pass into the Berner Oberland to support the armies of Berne. At the same time, the French General Balthazar Alexis Henri Schauenburg marched out of occupied Zürich to attack Zug, Lucerne and the Sattel pass. Even though the Reding's army won victories at Rothenthurm and Morgarten, Schauenburg's victory near Sattel allowed him to threaten the town of Schwyz. On 4 May 1798, the town council of Schwyz surrendered. ==Geography== Rothenthurm has an area, , of . Of this area, 44.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 48.6% is forested.

After the cancellation of Bunch, the manga was renewed in Monthly Comic Zenon under the title of Angel Heart: 2nd Season, which ran from 2010 to 2017. An animated television series based on the manga aired in Japan from October 3, 2005 to September 25, 2006. The author mentioned in the first tankōbon volume that Angel Heart shares the same characters as City Hunter but is not its continuation. Therefore, the events take place in a parallel universe. == Plot == A young woman stands on top of a building in Shinjuku as she receives a call from her handler. The handler, who calls her \\"Glass Heart\\", congratulates her with a job well done regarding her latest kill, which he refers to as her 50th. Glass Heart recounts the day's events. She had just killed a man sitting on a park bench with a silenced gun. As she was leaving the park, a small girl runs in with some ice cream and Glass Heart realizes that she has just killed the father of a little girl. With that she jumps off the building, impaling her chest on the iron spiked fence below. At the same time, Kaori Makimura is running late for an appointment to take wedding photos with her husband, the \\"City Hunter\\" Ryo Saeba. When she sees a girl about to be run over by a truck, she jumps and pushes the girl out of the way before the truck hits her. A short while later, she is declared brain dead and her heart is harvested for organ donation, as she had a donor card on her when she died. However, the Organization, needing a heart for their assassin, steals Kaori's heart while it is in transit and implants it into Glass Heart's body. Glass Heart is transported to Taiwan, where she remains in a coma for a year. During that time, she is haunted by the images of the people she has killed, along with the images of the donor Kaori as well as Ryo Saeba of whom she does not know. She wakes up after one year to find out who these people are. She travels back to Shinjuku, and after several close events, manages to track down the \\"City Hunter\\". He has retired from his role since his wife's death. Upon finding that Glass Heart is the recipient of Kaori's heart, Ryo decides to adopt her as his daughter, and is also given a name provided by her real father: Xiang Ying. The former mercenary now tries to help the former assassin move on with a normal life in the outside world. == Characters == The cast of Angel Heart === Main characters === Xiang-Ying (香瑩, Japanese: Shan'in, Chinese Pinyin: Xiāng-Yíng) : :Played by: Ayaka Miyoshi :A young Taiwanese girl who is the main protagonist of Angel Heart. In reality, she is the daughter of Li Jian-Qiang, the leader of the crime syndicate Zheng Dao Hui. However at the age of two, she and her mother were involved in a car accident when their car plunged off a cliff into a river. Her mother was killed in the accident but Xiang-Ying was never found, despite the best efforts of her father and his organization to locate her. In a cruel twist of fate, Xiang-Ying was found and taken in by the Zhuque Corps (a section of Zheng Dao Hui which specializes in assassinations) and trained to be an assassin. Because of the accident, she has no memory of her childhood, and as a result does not know her true parentage. While in training for the Zhuque Corps, she was referred to as Number 27 but after her training was complete, she was referred to as Glass Heart. After attempting to commit suicide, the heart of Kaori Makimura was transplanted into her, and with it, the overpowering desire to live and to be reunited with Ryo Saeba. As a result, she busts out of the lab she was kept in and travels to Japan where she finally meets Ryo. Ryo, in turn adopts Xiang-Ying as his daughter. ; : :Played by: Takaya Kamikawa : Like Xiang-Ying, Ryo himself has no memory of his background, being the lone survivor of a plane crash that killed his parents, and raised to be a mercenary. During his time as City Hunter, he was praised as one of the best in the underworld, while being a lecherous skirt chaser. However, he had come to a point where he decided to settle down and take Kaori as his wife. He was with Kaori in her last moments after she was hit by a truck, begging her to live. :At the beginning of the story, Ryo Saeba is a grieved man. He has since closed down his business as City Hunter. To deal with the loss of his fiancée Kaori, he has resorted to his former ways of skirt chasing, while his friends Saeko and Umibozu know that he is doing this to hide his pain. The arrival of Xiang-Ying in his life gives him some form of closure as well as something to live for as he tries to raise someone who he considers to be his and Kaori's daughter. ; : :Played by: Saki Aibu :In this alternate story, Kaori is hit by a truck while trying to save a young girl while on her way to take wedding pictures with Ryo. Her heart was harvested for use in another recipient before it was intercepted by the Zheng Dao Hui for use in Glass Heart after her attempted suicide. Her age at her time of death is listed as 28. :Like Xiang-Ying and Ryo, Kaori also does not know her true parentage, being the daughter of a criminal who died in a police incident and later being adopted by the Makimura family. Kaori somehow knows that she is not related to the family who raised her. When she was younger, she would wait at Shinjuku station every day for her father (who had died) to come through the turnstiles, believing that he would come, before her brother would arrive to pick her up. :Although she may be dead, Xiang-Ying can feel Kaori's thoughts inside of her and Kaori can also communicate to Ryo through Xiang- Ying. ; : :Played by: Brother Tom :Umibozu is owner of the Cat's Eye cafe. Umibozu is blind, but his blindness has not affected his abilities. He even admits that due to his blindness, he can \\"see\\" certain things that people with normal sight cannot see, such as recognizing people before they come into his cafe. Umibozu considers Ryo as his friend as evidenced by his concern for Ryo's mental health. Umibozu is also known by the codename Falcon ; : :Played by: Reiko Takashima :Saeko is Superintendent of the Shinjuku district police department. ; : :Played by: Shohei Miura :Xin-Hong is a childhood friend of Xiang-Ying and was referred to as Number 36 during training for the Zhuque Corps. He has developed feelings of affection for Xiang-Ying, and as a result, the trainers had Xiang-Ying and Xin-Hong face off in a fight to the death in the final exam. Xiang-Ying managed to get the drop on Xin-Hong and reluctantly killed her only friend, or so she thought. Somehow, he survived, and was transferred to the Qinglong Corps, another branch of Zheng Dao Hui. In fact, throughout this time, Xin-Hong has kept his desire to reunite himself with Xiang-Ying as his motivating factor to live. After the Qinglong were killed off by the Xuanwe, he was allowed by Li Jian-Qiang to live a normal life in order to watch over Xiang-Ying. == Media  Manga === The series debuted on May 15, 2001 in the first issue of Weekly Comic Bunch.

Its name is the German word for \\"saddle\\". ==History== Battle of Morgarten Chapel Aerial view (1948) The Battle of Morgarten occurred on 15 November 1315 near Sattel, at Morgarten (now part of Oberägeri). It began when a Swiss Confederation force of 1,500 infantry archers ambushed a group of Austrian soldiers of the Holy Roman Empire near the Morgarten Pass. The Swiss, led by Werner Stauffacher, thoroughly defeated the Austrians, who were under the command of Duke Leopold I of Austria. The Confederates prepared a road- block and an ambush at a point between Lake Aegeri and Morgarten pass where the small path led between the steep slope and a swamp. When about 1500 men attacked from above with rocks, logs and halberds, the knights had no room to defend themselves and suffered a crushing defeat, while the foot soldiers in the rear fled back to the city of Zug. A chronicler described the Confederates, unfamiliar with the customs of battles between knights, as brutally butchering everything that moved and everyone unable to flee. This founded the reputation of the Confederates as barbaric, yet fierce and respectable fighters. Within a month of the battle, in December 1315, the Confederates renewed the oath of alliance made in 1291, initiating the phase of growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy. Within forty years, cities including Lucerne, Zug, Zürich and Bern had joined the confederation. The victory of the Confederates left them in their virtual autonomy and gave them a breathing- space of some sixty years before the next Habsburg attack resulted in the Battle of Sempach (1386). The French invasion of Switzerland in 1798 brought about a swift end of the Ancien Régime. The French victories against the larger cities of the swiss plateau led to the creation of the French supported Helvetic Republic on 12 April 1798. Following the declaration of the Republic, the Cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden rejected it and raised an army to fight the French. Under Alois von Reding they were able to raise about 10,000 men. This army was deployed along the defensive line from Napf to Rapperswil. General Reding besieged French controlled Lucerne and marched across the Brünig Pass into the Berner Oberland to support the armies of Berne. At the same time, the French General Balthasar Alexis Henri Antoine of Schauenburg marched out of occupied Zürich to attack Zug, Lucerne and the Sattel pass. Even though the Reding's army won victories at Rothenthurm and Morgarten, Schauenburg's victory near Sattel allowed him to threaten the town of Schwyz. On 4 May 1798, the town council of Schwyz surrendered. ==Geography== Sattel has an area, , of . Of this area, 55.7% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.2% is forested.

Natsuki Ozawa endorsed the game. ==Gameplay== Otocky can be described as a musical side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The player's spaceship has a ball for a weapon, which can be fired in eight directions; each direction corresponds to a different musical note. The note plays when the player presses the fire button, and is also quantized in time so that it matches the beat playing in the background. By using the weapon selectively the player can improvise music while playing. The ball is used to destroy enemies by touching them, and also to catch various types of objects: * Musical Notes which must be collected to finish the level * Letter 'A's which change the musical instrument sound produced by the ball * Letter 'B's which provide a secondary weapon The ball gets smaller when the player is touched by an enemy, until the player loses a life. Completing a certain number of levels unlocks a music editor which makes it possible for the player to freely compose their own melodies. ==Notability== Otocky is notable for being one of the first games that include creative/procedural generative music. Otocky is a precursor of Rez, Tetsuya Mizuguchi's 2002 Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 game exploring similar themes of player action and musical evolution.handcircus.com: Ode to \\"Otocky\\" (by Toshio Iwai) (July 26, 2006) Retrieved July 30, 2006 Jake Kazdal, the only North-American member of United Game Artists, has confirmed that while the team did become acquainted with the Disk System game during the process of creating Rez, it has not been much of an influence in fact.Jake Kazdal: An American Gaijin - A CoreGamers Interview (September 16, 2008) Retrieved January 06, 2009 ==See also== *List of Family Computer Disk System games *Sound Fantasy *SimTunes *Electroplankton *Rez ==References * HardcoreGaming 101 Otocky Page *Otocky at MobyGames Category:1987 video games Category:ASCII games Category:Famicom Disk System games Category:Famicom Disk System-only games Category:Japan-exclusive video games Category:Music video games Category:Shoot 'em ups Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Otocky"},{"id":"6194993","text":"Steinerberg is a municipality in Schwyz District in the canton of Schwyz in Switzerland. ==Geography== Aerial view (1953) Steinerberg has an area, , of .

According to John Lomax, the song originated in North Carolina. In the early and middle 20th century, \\"Cindy\\" was included in the songbooks used in many elementary school music programs as an example of folk music. One of the earliest versions of \\"Cindy\\" is found in Anne Virginia Culbertson's collection of Negro folktales (At the Big House, where Aunt Nancy and Aunt 'Phrony Held Forth on the Animal Folks, Bobbs-Merrill, 1904) where one of her characters, Tim, \\"sang a plantation song named 'Cindy Ann',\\" the first verse and refrain of which are: As with many folk songs, each singer was free to add verses, and many did. In addition, as Byron Arnold and Bob Halli noted in An Alabama Songbook, performers could swap verses with those of other songs, including \\"Old Joe Clark\\" and \\"Boil Them Cabbage Down\\". The tune is taken from the spiritual \\"The Gospel Train\\", also known as \\"Get on Board Little Children\\". ==Recordings== Benjamin Weisman, Dolores Fuller and Fred Wise wrote a version of \\"Cindy\\" called \\"Cindy, Cindy\\". This version is the familiar one recorded by such performers as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Ricky Nelson, Warren Zevon, Nick Cave (in a duet with Johnny Cash), and others. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961). Mack Wilberg's choral arrangement of the piece was written for four-hand piano, double eight-part choirs, a string bass, xylophone, and a score of quintessential Americana instruments to supplement the melody during the arrangement's hoedown section. This arrangement is available for any choir to learn and perform, although Wilberg also wrote a special arrangement to be performed by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The choral parts are the same, but the accompaniment has been rewritten for full orchestra (specifically the Orchestra at Temple Square). Robert Plant featured an arrangement titled \\"Cindy, I'll Marry You Someday\\" on his 2010 album Band of Joy. Modern versions of the song include modified lyrics, such as the following: : You ought to see my Cindy : She lives way down South : And she's so sweet the honey bees : All swarm around her mouth : Get along home Cindy, Cindy : Get along home Cindy, Cindy : Get along home Cindy, Cindy : I'll marry you some day ==In film and television== Van Johnson sings part of it in the 1956 movie Miracle in the Rain.Miracle In the Rain (1956) - IMDb The song is performed in the 1957 episode of Maverick, \\"Hostage\\" by Don Durant.\\"Maverick\\" Hostage (TV episode 1957) – IMDb The song is performed in the 1959 John Wayne movie Rio Bravo.Rio Bravo (1959) – IMDb It is performed by Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson and Walter Brennan.

Alex Barendregt (left), the main organiser of the festival, with Markus Schenkeli (right), the host of the festival. The World Bodypainting Festival (WBF) is a bodypainting festival and competition which is held annually in Austria. The festival used to be held in Pörtschach on lake Wörthersee, but since 2017 it has taken place in Klagenfurt. It is attended by artists from 50 nations and attracts over 30,000 spectators. ==Overview== The World Bodypainting Festival has been taking place since 1998, forming a part of the art and cultural scene and the festival season of the southern region of Austria. The WBF has been involved in creating the modern bodypainting art movement, which has become worldwide, and the event's media coverage has continually increased. Over the years the festival has been hosted in different towns around the state of Carinthia, and in its 20th year it acquired a new home in the capital city, Klagenfurt am Wörthersee. Interaction with local art initiatives and the cultural institutions of the region has provided the art of bodypainting with opportunities for growth and networking. The WBF is held during the summer months usually in July. It attracts artists from 50+ nations and attracts 30,000+ spectators.Hänninen, Lauri: Väri maalaa tarinan. Kamera magazine 6-7/2010, pp. 14–18. It consists of a preparatory week followed by 3 main days of the festival/competition. The preparatory week consists of workshops and side events. The workshops offer many educational programs and lessons by leading artists in brush & sponge, airbrush, special effects, beauty make-up, head dressing including colour theory and history. All workshops are run and handled under the WB Academy and are also scheduled throughout the year in various cities worldwide. Side events include parties such as the surreal Costume Ball (Body Circus) with international DJs and musical stage performances. Also included are exhibitions, gatherings, meeting points and industry discussions. The three main days are open to the general public in a park also known as \\"Bodypaint City\\" where the World, Special and Amateur Awards are held. The festival is open to both adults and children and is considered a family-friendly environment. Spectators and visitors alike are able to step \\"into the surreal\\" filled with a unique world of art that excites the senses and the imagination. Visitors can also take part and express themselves in various activities throughout Bodypaint City. Artists compete on all three days with a given theme in the categories of brush & sponge, airbrush and special effects for the World Champion Award & title announced on Sunday. Also included is the World Facepainting Award, Armateur Award, Installation Award, Special Effects Face Make-up, Make-up Battle Award and the Photo Award. All categories have separate prizes and trophies. Artists can use either male or female models. The festival is open for both adults and children, and many families come there together. The three main days of the festival also plays host to a VIP area, a bodypainting manufacture & suppliers' market, fashion & crafts market, food & beverage vendors, headline stage bands, performers and international DJs throughout various musical zones of Bodypaint City. \\"There is something for everyone\\" including the closing Paint Party. The festival continues to develop the art form of body painting. The new location in Klagenfurt has brought more opportunities to connect the art of bodypainting with local museums, art galleries and cultural institutions. The city gallery (Stadtgalerie), the Museum of Modern Art Carinthia (MMKK), the literature museum (Musil Museum), theatres and privately-owned galleries provide space and opportunities for bodypainting artists to exhibit and perform, opening their venues free of charge during the festival week. ==History== The festival was first created and launched in 1998 in Seeboden, Austria as the European Bodypainting Festival in order to promote summer tourism to the region by then tourism manager Alex Barendregt. It was a small gathering of artists and the first \\"boutique event\\" of its kind in the world. Also launched in conjunction was the WB Academy, which in 2008 was offered worldwide. As the Bodypainting Movement was growing, in 2001 Mr. Barendregt launched the World Body Painting Association followed by the launch of WB Production in 2010. Due to the increasing attendance of international artists and supporters to the festival, in 2004 the festival was renamed to \\"The World Bodypainting Festival\\" and in 2011 Mr. Barendregt left his position at the tourist office and moved the festival to its new home in Pörtschach, Austria on lake Wörthersee. Today it is the biggest annual event in the bodypainting culture, community and industry at large. It has become the \\"Center of Bodypainting\\" and \\"Home\\" to many. Combined with Mr. Barendregt's efforts, the WB Association, WB Production and the WB Academy are considered and responsible for providing a worldwide platform and introduction into the Art of Bodypainting. In 2017 the festival venue moved a bit further down the lake to Klagenfurt, the capital city of the state of Carinthia. The new venue is the Goethepark, a public park surrounded by the cultural treasures such as the theatre, the art house and many galleries. ==Gallery== File:WBF male 1.jpgArtist at work File:World Bodypainting Festival Asia.jpgArtist at Work ==References * Official site * Photo Galleries from the past World Bodypainting Festivals * World Body Painting Festival 2007 slideshow * Organizer of the WBF * Klagenfurt ist wieder im Rausch der Farben – newspaper article in Kleine Zeitung * 16th World Bodypainting Festival – on the Yahoo!

His company, Canadian Natural Resources, has sketched out plans to spend $25 billion to turn the bitumen- bearing sand found in northern Alberta into barrels of crude oil. This media shy lawyer-turned-financier also owns big stakes in Ensign Energy, Canada's second biggest oil services company, and Magellan Aerospace Corporation.

Remoras attach themselves to other fish with a sucker on the head and this fish is almost exclusively found living on billfishes or swordfishes, and sometimes on sharks. ==Description== This species can reach in total length, though most do not exceed . It is an elongated cylindrical fish, usually whitish or pale blue in life, but tan or dusky-brown when dead. The rather flattened head has an oblong disc or sucker with 14 to 17 transverse plates with which it clings to its host. The dorsal and anal fins are long and set far back on the body. The dorsal fin has between 27 and 34 soft rays, the pectoral fin has 23 to 27 rays and the anal fin 25 to 34 rays. The caudal fin has a straight edge. The sucker reaches no further than the pectoral fins, and the outer two-thirds of the pectoral rays are flexible. There are up to 21 gill rakers in the first branchial arch. ==Biology== The spearfish remora attaches itself with its disc to a host fish, with juveniles often attaching in the gill chambers. Host fish include the sailfish, the white marlin, the black marlin, the striped marlin and the swordfish; all these fish swim faster than does the remora, and it is not clear how the remora attaches to the host in the first place. The remora can move about the body surface of its host and is capable of short bursts of independent swimming. The diet includes parasitic copepods removed from the body of the host, but these do not seem to form such a large percentage of the diet of the spearfish remora as it does for the common remora (Remora remora). Although more than one remora can attach to a single host, it is not clear how remoras come together to breed. ==References *Photograph spearfish remora spearfish remora ","title":"Spearfish remora"},{"id":"6195342","text":"The Southbridge Branch was a branch line railway that formed part of New Zealand's national rail network. It was located in the Canterbury region of the South Island and operated from 1875 until 1967. Five kilometres of the line remains open as the Hornby Branch, formerly the Hornby Industrial Line. == Construction == On 2 November 1870, the Canterbury provincial government resolved to build a line from Rolleston to Southbridge, as the district around Lake Ellesmere had become an economically significant grain-growing region that produced almost a quarter of all wheat in New Zealand in the late 1860s. However, by April 1872, the decision had been taken to establish the junction with the Main South Line in Hornby and work began on the line's formation. Financial difficulties and delays in acquiring materials slowed construction initially, but on 26 April 1875, the line was opened to Springston. This gave the line a length of . On 13 July 1875, the rest of the line to Southbridge was opened, giving the branch a total length of In 1880, construction of a sub-branch line off the Southbridge Branch to Little River from Lincoln began; this became the Little River Branch. == Stations == The following stations were located on the Southbridge Branch (in brackets is the distance from the junction at Hornby): *Prebbleton (5 km) *Ladbrooks (9 km) *Lincoln (13 km) - Little River Branch junction *Springston (18 km) *Goulds Road (20 km) *Ellesmere (24 km) *Lake Road (26 km) *Irwell (29 km) *Doyleston (32 km) *Leeston (34 km) *Hills Road (36 km) *Southbridge (41 km) == Operation == In the very early years of the line, a passenger train ran once each way daily between Christchurch and Lincoln, but this service ceased before 1880 and the line settled down to a pattern of \\"mixed\\" trains that carried both goods and passengers. These trains ran twice daily in 1914, along with a daily goods- only service, and a locomotive depot operated in Southbridge. Passenger numbers peaked in 1924, with approximately 34,000 carried, and picnic trains to Lake Ellesmere were popular, but competition from road transport began to markedly increase, and the line was losing money in the late 1920s. In 1930, the decision was taken to close the Southbridge locomotive depot and operate all trains directly out of Christchurch, and this had a notable short-term impact, as the line made a profit in 1938. However, in 1939, the Southbridge Branch again lost money and never returned to profitably. Post-World War II shortages and other economic factors led to the cancellation of passenger provisions on the line from 12 April 1951. After this stage, freight trains were only required to operate three or four times a week, and as traffic declined further, the decision was taken to abbreviate the line. On 30 June 1962, the 28 km section of line between Lincoln and Southbridge closed to all traffic. The Hornby-Lincoln section was then redesignated as the Hornby Industrial Line, which was cut back to Prebbleton station on 1 December 1967, and to the north side of the Springs Road crossing in 1986. The line still exists as far as Springs Road at Prebbleton, the overbridge having been demolished in the late 1990s. The couple of kilometres still in use serves a number of industries and is shunted when required. Part of the formation near Prebbleton has been incorporated into the Little River Rail Trail, and a motorway being built just north of Prebbleton will see the line truncated just past the Watties siding, with incorporation of the disused track between the motorway and Marshs Road into the rail trail being proposed. Most of the land around the old Prebbleton yard has been developed for housing in the last five years, although some is in reserves and a pedestrian path runs along part of the formation south of Tosswill Road. == The branch today == Remnants of closed railways often diminish and disappear with the passage of time, but some relics of the Southbridge Branch remain. Its formation can be traced for much of the line's length, though it does vanish at some points, at least in part because the flat terrain did not require substantial earthworks in the first place. There are also some bridge and culvert remains to be found along the line's former route, such as a footbridge near Lincoln utilising ex- railway abutments. Doyleston contains some of the most significant remnants, with the station site still in possession of its goods shed, loading bank, and passenger platform. Goods sheds can also be found in Leeston and Springston, with the latter utilised as an engineer's workshop. Ellesmere retains concrete foundation remains, and in Irwell, rails can be found scattered at the station site and embedded in a road near an old factory. Some remnants of the line can be seen today in Southbridge, such as the rail and loading dock inside present day Hamilton Seeds.

To give himself the middle of the week off, he makes a simple change by moving up the date of execution for Lord Farrow (from Wednesday to Monday). However, this simple change goes completely awry when the Queen allows Farrow's wife to visit her husband in prison on Monday, the day before his originally scheduled execution, not aware that he has already been executed. As he is already too late, Blackadder pretends to be Farrow, disguising himself with a bag over his head, as the Queen had given Lady Farrow a death warrant to give to Edmund should he refuse her. He is nearly thwarted, first when he discovers that Farrow had many individual traits, such as a deep voice, being much taller than him, and missing half an arm, and then when Lady Farrow attempts to take the bag off his head. Nevertheless, he manages to go undetected. Afterward, the Queen decides to pardon Farrow, saying 'He probably is innocent anyway', and everything looks bleak for Blackadder. Deciding that the only way to get around this problem is to pretend that they had been taking Farrow to see the Queen, when he said something traitorous in the hallway, and he and Percy had cut his head off there. Upon searching for the head in Traitor's Cloister, they realise the plan will not work, as the head already looks decomposed. However, Lord Percy notices that the head that Blackadder found on Farrow's spike is not actually Lord Farrow's, but rather that of Lord Ponsonby, another death row inmate whose execution was scheduled for Friday, meaning that Baldrick had killed the wrong man. Blackadder is relieved, until he remembers that the Queen is on her way to the prison at that very moment to visit Lord Ponsonby, and he hurries there just in time to pretend to be Ponsonby for the Queen, just as he had done with Farrow, despite Ponsonby only having one leg and a speech impediment. == Cast == *Rowan Atkinson as Edmund Blackadder *Tim McInnerny as Lord Percy Percy *Tony Robinson as Baldrick *Miranda Richardson as Queen Elizabeth I *Stephen Fry as Lord Melchett *Patsy Byrne as Nursie *Holly de Jong as Lady Farrow *Bill Wallis as Ploppy the Gaoler (son of Ploppy the Slopper) *Linda Polan as Mrs. Ploppy *Patrick Duncan as Earl Farrow == See also == *List of Blackadder episodes ==External links== * * Category:Blackadder episodes Category:1986 British television episodes Category:Television shows written by Ben Elton Category:Cultural depictions of Elizabeth I Category:Television shows written by Richard Curtis ","title":"Head (Blackadder)"},{"id":"6195351","text":"\\"Chains\\" is the final episode of the BBC sitcom Blackadder II, the second series of Blackadder, which was set in Elizabethan England from 1558 to 1603. Power-mad and self-professed \\"master of disguise\\", Prince Ludwig the Indestructible kidnaps Lord Blackadder and Lord Melchett. They escape his clutches but Prince Ludwig infiltrates the palace during a fancy dress ball. ==Plot== The episode opens with Melchett informing Queenie that his former tutor's son has been kidnapped and begs for her to pay the hefty ransom. Queenie consults the Lord Blackadder on the matter - he tells her to tell Melchett's tutor's son to get stuffed, stating that only an idiot can be as foolish as to be kidnapped. However, literally seconds later, Blackadder is kidnapped by two Spaniards and held for ransom, followed by Melchett a moment later. They awaken in a damp cell accompanied by a deranged Spanish torturer. Blackadder does not speak Spanish, so he and the torturer engage in a lengthy game of charades to determine the exact insults, threats, and mode of torture (for instance, the Spanish torturer is forced to go through several roles in order to call Blackadder a \\"bastard son of a bitch\\", and Blackadder is unable to explain via body language the meaning of \\"fornicating baboon\\" due to being locked up in a box covered in spikes). Prince Ludwig the Indestructible, a German pretender to the throne who mispronounces English words, interrupts just as the torturer is about to get started on Edmund; when Edmund does not recognise him, Ludwig reveals that he was once disguised as Big Sally, a waitress at The Old Pizzle in Dover. Edmund is horrified: he had an affair with Big Sally, unaware that it was Ludwig. At Ludwig's request, Lord Melchett is dragged in screaming. Melchett does not recognise Ludwig, until Ludwig tells him that he once impersonated Flossie, a sheep at a monastery in Cornwall. Melchett is also aghast, having unknowingly had a sexual encounter with the madman. Queenie replies that she has decided to spend the requested ransom money on \\"a big party\\". Ludwig agrees to imprison them for life instead of killing them in exchange for information on how to get into the palace during the costume party. When he leaves, Blackadder and Melchett escape and make their way back to England, arriving just in time for the party. Queenie is dressed as her father Henry VIII, while Baldrick is a pencil case. Edmund promptly stabs \\"Nursie\\", who is revealed to be Prince Ludwig masquerading as Nursie dressed as a cow. Ludwig, however, is still alive and flees, swearing revenge. Blackadder throws a dagger at him stating \\"you will die and be buried\\". Everyone asks how Blackadder knew the cow was Ludwig. Blackadder explains that Ludwig was a master of disguise so his costume would always look highly impressive while Nursie – a \\"sad, insane old woman with an udder fixation\\" – would be wearing a more ridiculous looking costume filled with udders. Everyone then asks if Blackadder missed them. He tells Percy he wished it was him who was being tortured instead. To Baldrick he says he was not missed at all, and as for the Queen, he states that life without her is like \\"a broken pencil\\"; she asks him to explain, and he replies \\"pointless\\". But after the credits, it is shown that Blackadder has been murdered by a surprise attack, along with Baldrick, Percy, Queenie, Melchett and Nursie.

In the episode, an embarrassing incident with a turnip, an ostrich feather and a fanatically Puritan aunt leads to a right royal to-do in the Blackadder household. The episode marks Hugh Laurie's first ever Blackadder appearance, and Miriam Margolyes's second. Laurie would go on to appear in every subsequent episode of the show. == Plot == Blackadder is having breakfast with Lord Percy when he receives a letter informing him that his fanatically Puritan but extremely wealthy aunt and uncle, Lord and Lady Whiteadder, will be visiting him to discuss the terms of his inheritance over dinner that evening. Before Edmund can revel in his fortune, a messenger arrives and informs him that Queen Elizabeth demands his presence at court. Blackadder rushes to Richmond Palace to discover the Queen and Nursie tending to an ailing Lord Melchett, whom the Queen believes to be dying. However, it is quickly revealed that Melchett is simply suffering from a dire hangover. Blackadder mocks Melchett for his lack of alcoholic tolerance, while Melchett reminds Edmund of his own drunkenness during the visit of the King of Austria, during which Blackadder wandered naked around the grounds of Hampton Court singing \\"I'm Merlin, The Happy Pig\\". Blackadder challenges his rival to a drinking bout, with 10,000 florins at stake. After Blackadder leaves, Queenie conspires to somehow gain entry to the party. Upon arriving back home, Blackadder begins to draft a guest list for the drinking party, with Percy's assistance. The guests include Simon Partridge, a perpetually drunken aristocrat nicknamed \\"Mr. Ostrich\\" who according to Percy, is a fearful oik, Sir Geoffrey Piddle, a deranged civil servant, and Freddie Frobisher, \\"the flatulent friar of Lindisfarne.\\" Baldrick, fully aware that his master does not have ten thousand florins to gamble with, questions the wisdom of his master holding a drinking contest; according to the dogsbody, everyone knows once Blackadder has one drop of the ale, he falls flat on his face and starts singing \\"that song about the goblin\\". Things are further complicated when Percy reminds him that the puritan Whiteadders will also be coming around that evening. Blackadder hastily returns to the Queen and asks that the contest be moved to another night; however, she senses that he is trying to cop out of his promise (since she also knows about his tendency to sing about the goblin when drunk) and refuses to postpone the contest. Back at his house, Blackadder decides to hold both events on the same evening but in different rooms. The drinking party is to be held in Baldrick's bedroom, while the Whiteadders are to dine with Percy in Blackadder's dining room. Blackadder is further annoyed when he's informed by Percy and Baldrick that while rooting through the vegetable patch for suitable food, they came across \\"a turnip shaped exactly like a thingie\\". To outlast Melchett at the drinking contest while simultaneously not making a fool out of himself in front of his aunt and uncle, Blackadder conjures up a plan to avoid alcohol without the other drinkers noticing, telling Baldrick to hand him water when he asks for his \\"incredibly strong ale\\" at the party. The evening begins with the arrival of the Whiteadders, who, particularly Lady Whiteadder, are comically revealed to be maniacally devout and denounce most everyday comforts as the work of Satan, including chairs (for being comfortable; at home, Lord Whiteadder sits on a spike, with his wife sitting on him- \\"Two spikes would be extravagant\\"), mashed foodstuffs, (believing that mashing is not what God intended and was designed to destroy the \\"sacred shape\\" of vegetables), the concept of family (due to the requirement of sex) and warmth (since \\"cold is God's way of telling us to burn more Catholics\\"). To make matters worse, Lord Nathanial Whiteadder has taken a \\"vow of silence\\", leaving Edmund's abusive and volatile aunt to hold the conversation. Whenever Blackadder casually mentions a subject she disapproves of, Lady Whiteadder comically slaps him across the face twice and calls him \\"Wicked child!\\" The drinking guests arrive, wearing fake comedy breasts and rubber noses on their foreheads. Melchett arrives shortly after, sporting a larger, golden pair of breasts. The intoxicated guests make Blackadder's situation even more difficult by being very rowdy, annoying and destructive, causing him to concoct increasingly ridiculous stories and lies to conceal what is going on from his aunt and uncle. Percy's imbecilic behaviour also greatly irritates Lady Whiteadder although she is pleasantly surprised by the \\"thingie-shaped\\" turnip. The Queen arrives at the party, disguised as Percy's girlfriend Gwendolyn, and Blackadder makes the mistake of locking her in the closet. In the other room, Melchett calls Blackadder out on his efforts to participate in the drinking game. Blackadder then calls for his strong ale but Baldrick quickly exposes the supposed ale as being water much to the outrage of Melchett and the other competitors. In revenge, Melchett, Partridge and the other competitors force Blackadder to drink a very strong ale. Forty-two seconds later, Blackadder re-enters the dining room blind drunk, bearing an ostrich feather up his bottom and wearing a Cardinal's hat. His aunt recognises that he has been both drinking and gambling, and the Whiteadders make to leave. Blackadder realises he has not only lost the 10,000 florin bet with Melchett, but also the chance of (as he puts it) \\"a whopping- great inheritance\\". However, things become rather confused when both parties accidentally meet in the hallway. Melchett's drinking crew assume the Whiteadders to be strippers, and release the Queen from the cupboard. With everyone silenced and kneeling after discovering who she really is, she announces she is going to first \\"have a little drinkie\\", and then execute everyone. By dawn the following morning, everyone is drunk or rather hungover and sitting in Blackadder's dining room, singing along to his rendition of the goblin song. The guests are all confused as to what has happened: Melchett has forgotten about the drinking bet, Queenie has forgotten her threats of execution and Lord Whiteadder seems willing to discuss the inheritance, while Lady Whiteadder emerges from beneath Queenie's frock, and upon hearing Blackadder mention the word \\"luck\\", proclaims that it sounds rude, due to its sounding “almost exactly like ‘fu-..’ ”.

Blackadder manages to bully a couple into buying his house for £1,100, but is again tricked out of the money by the Queen. Finally, as Blackadder is visited by the Bishop for failing to repay his debt, Blackadder drugs the Bishop and has a painting made of him in a highly compromising position. He uses this to successfully blackmail the Bishop into writing off the debt and giving him enough money to buy back his house and live in comfort. The Bishop is impressed by his treachery but asks who the other figure in the painting is, at which point Blackadder reveals Percy. == Cast == *Rowan Atkinson as Lord Edmund Blackadder *Tim McInnerny as Lord Percy Percy *Tony Robinson as Baldrick *Miranda Richardson as Queen Elizabeth I *Stephen Fry as Lord Melchett *Patsy Byrne as Nursie *Ronald Lacey as the Bishop of Bath and Wells *Cassie Stuart as Mollie *Lesley Nicol as Mrs. Pants *John Pierce Jones as Arthur the Sailor *Tony Aitken as the Mad Beggar *Philip Pope as Leonardo Acropolis *Piers Ibbotson as the Messenger *Barry Craine as Mr. Pants ==Legacy== *Bishop of Bath and Wells' Lingering torment of Blackadder, from the Telegraph (7 Dec 2008) ==External links== * * Category:Blackadder episodes Category:1986 British television episodes Category:Television shows written by Ben Elton Category:Cultural depictions of Elizabeth I Category:Television shows written by Richard Curtis ","title":"Money (Blackadder)"},{"id":"6195356","text":"\\"Potato\\" is the third episode of the BBC sitcom Blackadder II, the second series of Blackadder, which was set in Elizabethan England from 1558 to 1603. ==Plot== The episode opens with Blackadder at home, preparing to go to court to celebrate the return of Sir Walter \\"Oooh what a big ship I've got\\" Raleigh (Simon Jones). Blackadder is typically sarcastic and embittered, refusing to join in the festivities and endures much taunting from children outside his house, to which he retaliates by shooting one with an arrow. Melchett arrives and offers Blackadder a potato, the last having just been discovered by Raleigh on his voyages; Melchett plans to smoke his. Blackadder declines, scoffing that \\"people will be eating them next\\". At the court, Raleigh's tales of discovery greatly impress the Queen. Blackadder attempts to upstage him by declaring his intention to circumnavigate the Cape of Good Hope, a journey Raleigh believes is impossible, stating that sailors do not count it as part of the \\"Seven Seas\\" owing to its treacherousness. Blackadder enquires of Raleigh which sailor would be insane enough to captain such a voyage, and is told where to find Captain Redbeard Rum. Rum (Tom Baker) is insane, legless, and has no navigation skills whatsoever. Nursie however, is quite taken with him, and agrees to marry him once he returns. Once their journey starts, Rum admits that he does not know the way to the Cape of Good Hope, and intended to resort to his usual trick of circling the Isle of Wight until everybody gets dizzy. Blackadder then reveals that his actual plan is to go to France for a few months, then go back home and falsely claim to have sailed to the Cape of Good Hope. Unfortunately, they soon run into a serious problem; Rum does not know how to get to France either, and in fact does not know how to navigate at all. Utterly lost, they run out of food and water and are reduced to drinking their own urine (joining Rum, who's been swigging his with abandon even before the water ran out) when their ship runs aground on a tropical island with lava streams, mangroves and cannibalistic natives. Two years later, they somehow land back in Britain, but are greeted by a Queenie distinctly fed up of explorers, having spared Raleigh execution only because he \\"blubbed on his way to the block\\". After breaking the news to Nursie that her beloved Rum had been eaten by the savage natives, they give her his beard as a memento. Blackadder offers Queenie a stick that, when thrown away, comes back. She is displeased until she witnesses an offhanded throw of the boomerang return and strike Percy in the back of the head. Having been commanded to also present Melchett and Raleigh with a gift, Blackadder offers a bottle of \\"fine wine\\", which Blackadder states is in inexhaustible supply (seeing as how it is actually Baldrick's urine). == Cast == As in credits *Rowan Atkinson as Lord Edmund Blackadder *Tim McInnerny as Lord Percy Percy *Tony Robinson as Baldrick *Miranda Richardson as Queen Elizabeth I *Stephen Fry as Lord Melchett *Patsy Byrne as Nursie *Tom Baker as Captain Redbeard Rum *Simon Jones as Sir Walter Raleigh ==Notes== Tom Baker has described his own performance as \\"appalling\\".

There can often be high costs for companies associated with training employees. This could be problematic for candidates resulting in failure to secure employment for the position in question. Employers foresee costs related to hiring such “overqualified” candidates. When seeking employment, candidates should consider providing explanation to potential employers as to why they are seeking a position that requires less skill, education and therefore less pay than their education and experience qualify the candidate for. Economy’s markets and recessions have been known to affect the demand for skilled employees. As immigration has been on the rise, particularly in North America, this has resulted in an increase in the proportion of overqualified employees exceeding the demands of the positions within a majority of employment throughout many sectors. ==As a euphemism== The concept of overqualification is often a euphemism used by employers when they do not want to reveal their true reasons for not hiring an applicant. The term \\"overqualified\\" can mask age discrimination, but it can also mask legitimate concerns of an employer, such as uncertainty of an applicant's ability to do the job, or concerns that they only want a job on a temporary basis, while they seek another more desirable position.\\"What does ‘overqualified’ mean?\\", Atlanta Journal- Constitution, Aug. 14, 2008. Being overqualified also often means that a person was asking for too high a salary. \\"Overqualified\\" can also be used to describe a resistance to new technologies, or a pompous approach. In the definition above, which states that an overqualified person may take a job to gain knowledge and leave the company, this could also apply to all other employees of the same company. The term overqualified, in any definition, should be considered as a subjective term developed by the person doing the evaluation of the applicant based upon their point of view which may in itself be biased. There comes a time in a person's life, when a choice is made to reduce the level of responsibility and one could consider the perceived overqualification as \\"added value\\" to the company when the applicant is willing to take a lower-level position, accompanied by a lower salary. When the decision is not based upon factual or unbiased factors, discrimination has occurred. In the United States, the term \\"overqualified\\" has been found by the courts to sometimes be used as a \\"code word for too old\\" (i.e., age discrimination) in the hiring process.Hamm v. New York City Office of the Comptroller (D. Ct. NY, March 4, 1998). ==Protecting less qualified candidates== The governmental employing institution may have written or unwritten upper qualification limits for a particular position. These limits protect less qualified people like newly graduated students, allowing them to find a job as well. For instance, in countries like Germany or Switzerland, a paid position of a PhD student may normally not be given for an applicant who already has a PhD degree. On 11 July 2019, the Madras High Court ruled that public employers can reject overqualified applicants. ==Responses to being described as overqualified== Noluthando Crockett-Ntonga recommends that job applicants address potential concerns such as salary requirements in a cover letter and interview before the employer makes any comments about overqualification. Barbara Moses advises applicants who are described as being overqualified to emphasize their willingness to mentor younger co-workers, and to focus on what attracts them about the position they are applying to rather than emphasizing their ambition or desire to be challenged. Being overqualified can be an asset for employers, especially when the breadth of one's experience enables them to take on additional responsibilities in ways that benefit the employer. ==The PhD== The PhD can reflect overspecialization that manifests itself as a lack of perspective; for example, a PhD might not adequately prepare one for careers in development, manufacturing, or technical management. John A. Armstrong, \\"Rethinking the PhD\\", originally appeared in Issues in Science and Technology. In the corporate world, some PhD graduates have been criticized as being unable to turn theories into useful strategies and being unable to work on a team, although PhDs are seen as desirable and even essential in many positions, such as supervisory roles in research, especially PhDs in biomedical sciences. Even in some college jobs, people can associate negative factors with the PhD, including a lack of focus on teaching, overspecialization, and an undesirable set of professional priorities, often focusing on self-promotion. These forces have led both to an increase in some educational institutions hiring candidates without PhDs as well as a focus on the development of other doctoral degrees, such as the D.A. or Doctor of Arts. Edmond L. Volpe, \\"A Portrait of the PhD as a Failure\\", ADE Bulletin, 027 (November 1970): 4-10. Some employers have reservations about hiring people with PhDs in full-time, entry-level positions but are eager to hire them in temporary positions.Susan Basalla May, \\"Behind the Ivory Tower: Breaking In as a Temp\\", Chronicle of Higher Education, May 2003. Some argue that this reservation is rather a reaction associated with job insecurity, especially in situations where most of the company leaders hold lower qualifications than the PhD; as part of the wide phenomenon of credential creep. ==See also== *Involuntary unemployment * Overengineering *Underemployment *Yield protection ==References== Category:Recruitment Category:Unemployment Category:Social constructionism Category:Waste of resources ","title":"Overqualification"},{"id":"6195363","text":"BenQ-Siemens SL91 is a slider-type GSM 3G mobile phone, created by BenQ Mobile and introduced in July 2006.https://www.cnet.com/news/benq-siemens-reveals- new-phones-e71-e81-and-sl91/ The SL91 phone is the successor of Siemens SL75 and BenQ-Siemens SL80. this phones was stylishhttp://www.phonesreview.co.uk/2006/10/31/benq-siemens-sl91/ slider drawing inspiration and development from the previous Siemens Mobile”SL family“ Siemens SL55.https://www.mobilegazette.com/benq-siemens- sl91-06x07x26.htm SL65 and Siemens SL75.

Founded in 1979, ECFA accredits over 2,200 member organizations which have demonstrated compliance with its financial standards.About ECFA As of 2015, the collective annual revenue of ECFA member organizations is reported to be nearly $25 billion. The organization has, since its inception, been based in the Washington, D.C. area with offices presently in Winchester, Virginia. ==History== In 1977, Senator Mark Hatfield, who since 1973 had been a member of the board of World Vision,Gary F. VanderPol: The least of these: American evangelical parachurch missions to the poor, 1947-2005. Boston University School of Theology, 2010, (Dissertation) page 106 told evangelicals that they needed to formalize some means for financial accountability or government legislation would be required. At the same time, Texas Congressman Charles Wilson had drafted a bill that would have required ministries to disclose \\"at the point of solicitation.\\" A group of representatives from more than thirty evangelical groups met in December of that year to formulate a plan. At that meeting, Hatfield's chief legislative assistant told them that \\"a voluntary disclosure program\\" would \\"preclude the necessity of federal intervention into the philanthropic and religious sector.\\"Jeffrey K. Hadden and Charles E. Swann, Prime Time Preachers: The Rising Power of Televangelism (Reading, MA: Addison- Wesley Publishing Co., 1981), 123.

Hadden and Charles E. Swann, Prime Time Preachers: The Rising Power of Televangelism (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1981), 123. ECFA was founded with the establishment of seven standards of accountability that covered board governance, the requirement for audited financial statements, the requirement for public disclosure of the audited financial statements, the avoidance of conflicts of interest, and standards regarding fundraising activities. It was believed that the proposed standards of accountability generally exceeded the requirements of law. Charities that met those standards and paid the membership fee were granted a seal of approval. Membership fees were based on donated income. Evangelical charities could apply for accreditation and were required to submit information that would be reviewed and evaluated against those standards. Those meeting the standards would be accredited and granted a seal of approval. ==Membership== The ECFA members are organized charities in the US, typically 501(c)3 Evangelical nonprofits and churches. Members range \\"from evangelism in foreign jungles to race car driver evangelism, from ministry to the elderly, children, the impaired, to those in the military, those on the streets, and to many in between. All members are fulfilling a calling to reach a lost world for Christ. ECFA members are located across the U.S. and U.S. territories and range from the very large national ministries to smaller local ministries and churches.\\"FAQ About ECFA: Who are the members of ECFA? Members are required to annually submit a renewal document which includes the recent copy of the audited financial statement and answers to a number of questions related to the membership standards. ==Integrity standards== As an accrediting organization, ECFA provides a seal of approval to those members who adhere to Seven Standards of Accountability. ECFA, Seven Standards of Responsible Stewardship, ecfa.org, USA, retrieved June 20, 2020 Voluntary resignations, mergers, and dissolutions are frequent reasons for terminations. However, ECFA's list of former members also includes terminations for failure to provide information or fully comply with the standards. A notable former member is Gospel For Asia (one of EFCA's charter members), whose membership was terminated in October 2015 after allegations of donation misuse. In a 2004 survey, ECFA was seen by respondents as an effective accreditation program that provided assurance of financial propriety for its members. == Commission on Accountability and Policy for Religious Organizations == In January 2011, Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, asked ECFA to facilitate responses from the ministry community concerning a series of legislative proposals prepared by his staff.

They raced with the 16 Experts, making it a Pro/Am class essentially. This is why, during the early years of the pro division, the national number one racer of a sanctioning body could be either an amateur or professional. This practice continued until the NBA's 1979 season, when the pros earned separate pro points and a separate pro plate from the amateurs. The NBL and the ABA followed suit a year later. **At the start of his pro career, there wasn't a two-tier system of Junior and Senior Pros, therefore his first pro race and/or win was his first in Senior pro. ===Career factory and major bike shop sponsors=== Note: This listing only denotes the racer's primary sponsors.

May 1982 Vol. No.5 pg.11 *He helped Scot Breithaupt in the establishment of SE Racing in 1977. *Named number five of the top five riders in Southern California of 1977 by Bicycle Motocross News.Bicycle Motocross News Vol.4 No.3 pg.12 *One of the most respected and pioneering BMX bicycle models is named after him: The P.K. Ripper manufactured by Scot Enterprises (SE) Racing. It was one of the first production BMX bicycles to be made from aluminum. It is a metal that was difficult to work with vis-à-vis bicycle frame construction and fragile if not manufactured correctly. As a result it was also more expensive than typical steel bicycles. The P.K. Ripper was one of the first aluminum framed BMX bicycles that was reliable and durable for racing and competitively priced. It was in many ways ahead of its time. The fact that it resembles a modern BMX bicycle is no accident; most modern BMX race bicycles are usually made from aluminum. Like the P.K., modern aluminum bicycle frames have oversized flattened downtubes and toptubes which was called on the Ripper (and a pioneering S.E. Racing BMX Cruiser) \\"Floval\\" by the founder of S.E. Racing Scot Breithaupt. Also, there is a pro cruiser by S.E. called the \\"floval flyer,\\" a very unusual-looking bicycle at the time, as was the \\"exotic\\" material it was fabricated from. When introduced, most BMX bicycles were made from either hi-tensile steel or more expensive but stronger chromium-molybdenum steel. Chromium-molybdenum steel, commonly known as \\"Chromoly\\", while more expensive than high-tensile steel, it was cheaper than aluminum, in part it was much easier to fabricate and more reliable in terms of durability than most other aluminum framed race bicycles on the market at the time. Aluminum, while significantly lighter and much less subject to corrosion than chromoly steel, is more brittle and less resilient than chromoly. The frame must be absolutely stiff or it is subject to failing abruptly, i.e. snapping in two suddenly. It will succumb from metal fatigue at a much faster rate, especially if it is subjected to flexing. This is why the tubes of an aluminum frame are both of a larger diameter and are thicker walled than chromoly tubes, to maintain stiffness. Further, aluminum is harder to weld. The welds have to be extra strong and \\"double butted\\" and thorough which gives the aluminum frame with its very obvious beaded welds an \\"unfinished\\" look, as if someone forgot to sand them down at the factory to give it the clean, almost one-piece look of a chromoly frame. As a result, the weight advantage of aluminum is reduced significantly, in addition to it higher fabrication cost.BMX Plus! July 1994 Vol.17 No.7 pg.48 For these reasons, the Chromoly steel frame and fork was the standard of BMX racing and freestyle for twenty years. Only in the mid-1990s, as manufacturing advances - many pioneered in the construction of a mountain bike frame - made aluminum cheaper and easier to work with, did aluminum-framed race and freestyle bicycles begin to supplant chromoly. Today the aluminum BMX bicycle frame is the standard, and the modern iteration of the P. K. Ripper is still manufactured by SE (now called Sports Engineering) Racing. *He was one of the founding members of the Professional Racing Organization (PRO) racers guild in 1977.Bicycle Motocross Action August 1977 Vol.2 No.3 pg.25 *Following in the footsteps of Bobby Encinas he established Perry Kramer's Pro School of BMX traveling BMX clinic in 1978 teaching hundreds of kids what BMX had to offer. *He is a 1991 Inductee into the ABA BMX Hall of FamePerry Kramer's blurb in the ABA BMX Hall of Fame. *He is a 2004 Inductee into the United States Bicycling Hall of Fame.Perry Kramer Inducted into the U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame. ===Significant injuries=Racing traits and habits=Post BMX career== *He stayed within the industry and worked for various bicycle companies including Giant.BMX Action July 1989 Vol.14 No.7 pg.10 ==BMX press magazine interviews and articles== *\\"Perry Kramer's Pro BMX Winners Seminar!\\" BMX Plus!

An Australian international and Queensland State of Origin representative forward, he played his club football in the Brisbane Rugby League for the Souths Logan Magpies under the coaching of Wayne Bennett. He also played in the NSWRL for Eastern Suburbs and Manly- Warringah. ==Background== Brown was born in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. ==CareerClub career=== Dave Brown started his club career in the Brisbane Rugby League competition with the Souths Magpies. In 1981, Brown signed with Sydney club Eastern Suburbs. Under the coaching of Bob Fulton, Brown played 41 games for the Roosters in 1981 and 1982 (and was considered unlucky not to be selected for the 1982 Kangaroo tour), before following Fulton to Manly in 1983 where he would win the 1983 Dally M of the year award, though injury kept him out of the Sea Eagles Grand Final team that lost 18–6 to Parramatta. Brown stayed at Manly for the 1984 season, before once again joining Easts for what would be his last two years of top grade football in Australia. After finishing his career with Easts at the end of the 1986 NSWRL season (after having only played 12 games over the course of 1985 and 1986), Brown ventured to England where he joined Hull F.C. in the 1986–87 season. Dave Brown played Left-, i.e. number 8, in Hull FC's 24–31 defeat by Castleford in the 1986 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1986–87 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 11 October 1986. Hull finished the season in 11th place and only two places away from being relegated to the Second Division. Following the season, Brown returned home to Brisbane. After returning to Australia, Brown played in the Western Australian Rugby League in Perth as Captain-coach of the Belmont Steelers in 1988–90. ===Representative career=== Dave Brown made his first representative appearance when he was selected Queensland in a 30–5 loss to New South wales in 1979. Later that year he was chosen for the Brisbane Firsts team that played in an Amco Cup game at Sydney's Leichhardt Oval in 1979 against the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, a game Cronulla won 22–5. Brown's teammates at Leichhardt that night included pairing Mal Meninga and Chris Close, Ross Strudwick, Test John Lang, while on the interchange bench was a young forward named Wally Lewis. Brown played two State of Residence and ten State of Origin matches for Queensland between 1979 and 1986, scoring his only try for the Maroons in Game 3 of the 1983 State of Origin series at Lang Park after coming on as a replacement for Darryl Brohman who had his jaw broken after a sickening elbow from New South Wales' forward Les Boyd, a Manly teammate of Brown. Brohman had been widely tipped to make his test debut for Australia in the first Trans-Tasman Test against New Zealand at Carlaw Park in Auckland just three days later, but ironically the spot in the test team went to Brown instead. He played his last game for Queensland in Game 1 of the 1986 State of Origin series at Lang Park, but was dropped after NSW defeated Qld 22–16 in front of 33,066 fans. His standout performances for Queensland in 1983 saw him make the first of 5 test appearances for Australia in the opening test of the 1983 Trans-Tasman series against New Zealand, and would retain his spot for the second game at Lang Park. He then went on to play in the front row in the first two games of The Ashes series against Great Britain in 1984, before being relegated to the bench for what would be his final test as Australia defeated Great Britain 20–7 in the final test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Australia retained The Ashes with a 3–0 series win over the Lions. ==References *Queensland Representatives at qrl.com.au Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Queensland Rugby League State of Origin players Category:Australia national rugby league team players Category:Souths Logan Magpies players Category:Sydney Roosters players Category:Manly Warringah Sea Eagles players Category:Brisbane rugby league team players Category:Norths Devils coaches Category:Rugby league props Category:Rugby league players from Brisbane ","title":"Dave Brown (rugby league, born 1957)"},{"id":"6195577","text":"KIHP is a Catholic radio station licensed to Mesa, Arizona, serving the Phoenix metropolitan area. It is owned by Immaculate Heart Media, Inc. ==History== The station signed on in 1946 as KTYL on 1490 kHz, owned by the Harkins Theater group. It was the second station in Mesa, signing on 3 days after KARV (1400 AM). Both stations ran 250 watts full-time with non- directional antennas — the maximum power allowed for Class IV (now Class C) stations at the time. Two years later, KTYL bought and shut down KARV; its frequency was reactivated in Phoenix in 1950 as KONI (now KSUN). Harkins also put Arizona's first FM station (KTYL-FM 104.7, now KZZP) on the air in 1950; this was followed by Phoenix's second TV station (KTYL-TV channel 12, now KPNX) on the air. As with the AM station, both stations were originally located in (and are still licensed to) Mesa. KTYL moved to 1310 in the early 1950s, and eventually increased its power to 5,000 watts day and 500 watts night. It became KBUZ, a beautiful music station, in February 1958, with the slogan 'Drive with care, and KBUZ, everywhere'. At that time, it moved to Thomas Mall on the east side of Phoenix. The format was simulcast on 104.7 FM, by now KBUZ-FM. On January 1, 1977, the station became KQXE, with a very successful personality oriented oldies format For three years it dominated Eastern Phoenix radio, going up against market leader KOY. Management assembled a group of talents from the Phoenix radio region and added experienced, market leading individuals such as Phil Barry (Detroit) and Phil Gardner (Cleveland) https://archive.org/details/KQXEPhoenixPhilGardiner1980. After owners Southwestern Media sold the station to Western Cities Broadcasting, KQXE transitioned to a pop format under the calls KZZP, which is shared with sister FM station 104.7. The station's last logo as KXAM. After a precisely 10-year-long simulcast, 1310 AM split from the simulcast of KZZP-FM on February 19, 1990 and became KXAM. Initially an adult standards station, KXAM later became an independent talk station, airing syndicated shows including Laura Ingraham, Dave Ramsey and Matt Gerson. Gerson was part of the family that controlled KXAM's owner, Embree Broadcasting, and hosted a political talk show until March 2009. Soon afterward, Embree announced that KXAM would cease operations. Two of the station's local programs, Culinary Confessions (a food show) and The Bandwagon (a sports show) moved to KAZG soon after the announcement. Although KXAM employees had offered to buy the station, the Gerson family turned their offers down, insisting at that time on returning the license to the Federal Communications Commission.http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/04/14/20090414sr- kxam0416.html The station went silent April 16, 2009. On June 1, 2009, the Gerson family backed off from its plans to surrender the KXAM license and sold it to IHR Educational Broadcasting for $1 million.http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/cdbsmenu.hts?context=25&appn;=101314847&formid;=314&fac;_num=19468 It returned to the air as KIHP, with its current format on December 17.

B. s. v. . ==History== This city, as appears from its coins - which bear the epigraph or - where the inhabitants are called Macedonians, may have been founded by Antigonos Dokimos.Smith raises doubt whether the coins are genuine. The city's name in Greek is Romanized as Dokimeion, Dokimia Kome, Dokimaion, and later Dokimion. Strabo places Docimium somewhere about Synnada: he calls it a village, and says that there is there a quarry of Synnadic stone, as the Romans call it, but the people of the country call it Docimites and Docimaea; the quarry at first yielded only small pieces of the stone, but owing to the later efforts of the Romans large columns of one piece are taken out, which in variety come near the Alabastrites, so that, though the transport to the sea of such weights is troublesome, still both columns and slabs were brought to Rome of wondrous size and beauty. The red colors which streaked the white marble taken from the city's holy mountain were attributed to the drops of blood from the dying god Attis.Robin Lane Fox, Pagans and Christians, p41 The word Docimaea () in this passage of Strabo appears to be corrupt. It should be either or . Strabo says that the plain of Synnada is about 60 stadia long, and beyond it is Docimium. We may, however, infer that he supposed Docimium to be not far from the limit of the plain. The Table makes it 32 M. P. between Synnada and Docimium, and Docimium is on the road from Synnada to Dorylaeum; but the number is certainly erroneous. The exact site of Docimium was a matter of some dispute until recently; it is now fixed at the modern Turkish town İscehisar, in Afyonkarahisar Province. == Episcopal see == On this site have been found many Christian inscriptions, later than Constantine. Docimium was a suffragan of Synnada in Phrygia Salutaris. Six or seven bishops are known, from 344 to 879 (Lequien, Oriens Christianus, I, 853); another bishop is mentioned in an inscription.

More likely it was situated somewhere in Egypt, and it has been conjectured that it is the same as Psilka, a city of the Thebaid in the neighbourhood of Syene. ==Works== It is well known that the divisions into chapters and verses with which we are familiar were entirely wanting in the original and early copies of the New Testament writings; there was even no perceptible space between words. To obviate the manifest inconveniences arising from this condition of the text, Ammonius of Alexandria, in the third century, conceived the idea of dividing the Four Gospels into sections, varying in size according to the substance of the narrative embodied in them, and Euthalius, following up the same idea, extended a similar system of division to the other books of the New Testament with the exception of the Book of Revelation. So obvious were the advantages of the scheme that it was soon adopted throughout the Greek Church. As divisions of the text these sections have no longer any intrinsic value. But as they were at a given period adopted in nearly all the Churches and noted by the copyists, they are valuable as chronological indications, their presence or absence being an important circumstance in determining the antiquity of a manuscript. Other labours of Euthalius in connection with the text of the New Testament refer to the division of the text into larger sections or lessons to be read in the liturgical services, and to the more minute divisions of the text called verses. The custom of reading portions of the New Testament in the public liturgical services was already ancient in the Church, but with regard to the choice and delimitation of the passages there was little or no uniformity, the Churches having, for the most part, each its own series of selections. Euthalius elaborated a scheme of divisions which was soon universally adopted. Neither the Gospels nor the Apocalypse enter into this series, but the other portions of the New Testament are divided into 57 sections of varying length, 53 of which are assigned to the Sundays of the year, while the remaining four refer probably to Christmas, the Epiphany, Good Friday and Easter. The idea of dividing the Scriptures into verses did not originate with Euthalius. It had already been applied to portions of the Old Testament, especially to the poetical parts, and even to some parts of the New. Here, as with regard to the other divisions, Euthalius only carried out systematically and completed a scheme which had been but partially and imperfectly realized by others, and his work marks a stage of that progress which led finally to punctuation of the text. These were of unequal length, either containing a few words forming a complete sense, or as many as could be conveniently uttered with one breath. Thus, for instance, the Epistle to the Romans contained 920 of these verses; Galatians, 293; Hebrews, 703; Philemon, 37, and so on. Besides these textual labours, Euthalius framed a catalogue of the quotations from the Old Testament and from profane authors which are found in the New Testament writings. He also wrote a short Life of St. Paul and a series of \\"Argumenta\\" or short summaries which are placed by way of introduction to the different books of the New Testament. After having long lain in oblivion, the works of Euthalius were published in Rome, in 1698, by Lorenzo Alessandro Zaccagni, Prefect of the Vatican Library. They are embodied in the first volume of his Collectanea Monumentorum Veterum Ecclesiæ Græcæ ac Latinæ. They can also be found in Gallandi (Biblioth. Pat., X, 197) and in Migne (Patrologia Graeca, LXXXV, 621). ==See also== *Euthalian Apparatus ==References== Category:Ancient Alexandrians Category:5th-century bishops Category:5th-century Byzantine people ","title":"Euthalius"},{"id":"6195629","text":"Angels with Dirty Faces is the third album of English musician Tricky, released in 1998.

He described it as an \\"alluring sonic blur\\" that preserved his previous music's mesmeric sounds yet felt \\"more adventurous, rhythmically and musically, than its predecessors\\". Simon Price hailed it as Tricky's most cogent work since his debut album: \\"Simultaneously challenging and gorgeously formed, it's a brilliant mix of defiance and achievement.\\" Village Voice critic Robert Christgau said it was a rock album with a live band on every song, no samples, and \\"grimy\\" productions that complemented Tricky's anti-social themes, making for a difficult but interesting listen: In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine was less enthusiastic about the record. He wrote that while Tricky had expanded his signature dub-inspired trip hop sound with rhythmic elements from hardcore hip hop and jungle music, Angels with Dirty Faces was \\"slightly different but essentially the same\\" as his previous album Pre-Millennium Tension.

It is now a writer's house museum. The outbuilding on the territory of a property on Chekhov Street (formerly Kupecheskaya Street, later Alexandrovskaya Street, and renamed in honor of Chekhov in 1904, soon after his death) in Taganrog was built in 1859 of wattle and daub, plastered and whitened. The area taken up by the small outbuilding is 30.5 sq. meters. The house and grounds were owned by the merchant Gnutov in 1860, and by the petit bourgeois Kovalenko in 1880-1915. Pavel Yegorovich Chekhov and his family (his wife Yevgeniya Yakovlevna and their two sons—four- year-old Alexander Chekhov and 2-year-old Nikolay Chekhov)—rented the outbuilding in December 1859. Anton Chekhov was born in this house on January 17, 1860. In March, 1861, Pavel Yegorovich Chekhov and his family moved into another apartment. In 1910, a memorial plate was placed on the birth house of Chekhov thanks to the initiative of the Chekhov Circle in Taganrog, formed by the writer Yevgeny Garshin in 1905. In 1916, the Taganrog City Council supported the initiative of the Chekhov Circle and acquired the house and grounds on Chekhov Street 69 to conserve the birth house of Anton Chekhov. In December 1920, the house was freed from all tenants, and a renovation followed in 1921. In 1924, the first exhibition telling of the writer's youth was opened. In 1935 Maria Chekhova and Olga Knipper came to visit the home city of Chekhov, Taganrog, to participate at the events commemorating the 75th anniversary of Anton Chekhov's birth. Within the framework of the visit, Maria Chekhova presented to the Taganrog memorial museum several Anton Chekhov or Chekhov family memorabilia from White Dacha in Yalta. As part of the celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of Chekhov's birth, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev visited the Birth House memorial museum on January 29, 2010.The President of Russian Federation Dmitri Medvedev participated in celebrating the 150th anniversary of the great Russian writer Anton Chekhov in the writer's home city of Taganrog. ==Photos== File:Домик Чехова.jpgThe birth house of Anton Chekhov on an old postcard, 1910 File:Chekhov Birth House 2006.jpgThe memorial museum \\"Birth House of Anton Chekhov\\" in May 2006. ==References== * Taganrog Encyclopedia (Энциклопедия Таганрога), 2nd edition, Taganrog, 2003 ==See also== Anton Chekhov's White Dacha in Yalta Category:Museums in Taganrog Category:Houses completed in 1859 Category:Anton Chekhov Category:Historic house museums in Russia Chekhov ","title":"Birth house of Anton Chekhov"},{"id":"6195635","text":"The Gerry Reilly Memorial under-16 Inter-County Football Tournament is an annual Gaelic football competition in the province of Leinster in Ireland.

The sinking is still the most severe maritime disaster in Finnish lakes or rivers. It led to the loss of 136 lives, according to the passenger counts and the officers; most sources frequently list the death toll as 138. There were 150 passengers and 12 crew members. One of the drowned was the Member of the Parliament Ida Vihuri. The ship capsized due to heavy wind – 8 Beauforts (), and there were some claims of up to 11.5 Beauforts. The capsizing was mostly due to an overly-high centre of gravity; in 1927, a third deck level had been added without expert help or inspecting the balance of the ship. The big waves brought water onto the deck, and the water couldn't flow away. The wreck was raised in the same year and repaired; the ship had suffered only minor damage. Some cabin structures were removed to improve the balance. She served in use until 1939. During the First World War, the ship served as a part of the Imperial Russian Navy's Satakunta Flotilla. ==References * Kuru, SS Kuru, SS Kuru Category:Ships of the Imperial Russian Navy Category:1929 in Finland ","title":"SS Kuru"},{"id":"6195668","text":"(born 1940) is a Japanese physicist in the Nonlinear Dynamics group at Kyoto University who formulated the Kuramoto model and is also known for the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation.

It was recorded in late 1992 and released after many delays on June 15, 1994 through the Italian record label Avantgarde Music. The band had eventually disbanded a year before the release of the album. Stream from the Heavens continues the funeral doom subgenre that Thergothon pioneered with their 1991 demo Fhtagn nagh Yog-Sothoth. The album was re-issued on CD in 1999 and also in 2004 by Belgian label Painiac as a 12\\" LP, limited to 500 copies. ==Background== According to the album notes, the band started to compose songs between 1990 and the end of the recordings, which took place from October to November 1992. In an interview, singer and keyboard player Niko Sirkiä says that he only wrote the documented lyrics on the legend of Kthulu. After having recorded the demo Fhtagn nagh Yog-Sothoth, the band reworked on two songs from this demo and recorded two others during the fall of 1992. The sound of the album is characterized by non-metal influences such as gothic rock, dark ambient and progressive rock and, compared to Fhtagn nagh Yog-Sothoth, extreme slowness, an impression confirmed by Sirkiä, who, questioned on the influences of Thergothon which led to the sound of the album, named the following inspirations: In addition to Paradise Lost and Cathedral, Sirkiä refers to pioneers of their own development, but the musicians did not go far enough, especially with the slow tempos. In retrospect, however, more important than musical influence seemed to him to be the search for means of expressing one of mine considered universal as an existential fear at the end of adolescence. He described music as \\"an appropriate means of expressing and expelling the negative emotions that [the band members] experienced.\\" The lyrics also constantly refer to H.P. Lovecraft. However, Sirkiä described the atmosphere as the central objective of the band's music. All other aspects are only intended to support the desired atmosphere. Despite the completion of the recording process and the complete graphic design of the album without any difficulty, it has not been released for a long time. Some describe problems with the contractual partner as the cause of the long-term delay. After finishing the recordings and before the album was released, the group decided to disband. Sirkiä describes the dissolution as a consequence of the impression that he had completed the project. He also recalled the fact that they had become more and more tired of playing metal. ==Artwork== The design of the album and booklets were done by Niko Sirkiä himself. K. Sirkiä was named as the photographer of the cover picture, a low-lying sunrise with a barely identifiable tower monolithically protruding into the right picture space. The image was given an \\"ominous\\" appearance by Oscar Strik for the review written for the Webzine Doom-Metal.com. In addition to the information on the recording, the lyrics in the booklet were printed in a calligraphic font in white on a black background. ==Release== The album was released on June 15, 1994, via Italian independent label Avantgarde Music, and was reissued by black metal label Obscure Plasma Records, as the first release under the new label name. It contains six songs with a total playing time of 40 minutes and 48 seconds. No changes were made to the volume of the album in later editions and additional bonus material was not added. ==Legacy== Upon its first release, Stream from the Heavens was highly neglected by the professional music press. With time however, it became noticed by the international metal scene. In 2014, Decibel Magazine ranked the album ninth on the 100 Top Doom Metal Albums of All Time. In that same year, Deaf Forever, ranked it at number 34 on the list of the 50 Best Doom Albums of All Time and as part of the list 20 Essential Black / Death Doom Albums. The album is also listed in various similar lists. British magazine Metal Hammer mentioned Stream from the Heavens among The 10 Essential Doom Metal Albums, while Loudwire listed it on The Best Metal Albums From 40 Subgenres and at number 6 of the Top 25 Doom Metal Albums of All Time. In his work for the British magazine Metal Hammer, Christ Chantler placed the album in terms of their importance for the development of doom metal and the genre that follows it in relation to Winter, Eyehategod, Disembowelment and Unholy. He declared that no other band has created more terrifying \\"than the non-Euclidean geometry of the Finnish pioneer band Thergothon, whose only album is an ice age Lovecraftian nightmare that still exudes its distant mysticism.\\" In the weekly series Funeral Friday, which was written for the Webzine Metal Injection, journalist Cody Davis presented Thergothon as the starting point of the genre. According to such assessments, reviewers described the album as original and comparative work for releases in the genre that are currently to be discussed. Accordingly, bands like Rigor Sardonicous, Mournful Congregation, Profetus, Beneath Oblivion, Woebegone Obscured, Ea, and Funeral Moth have released albums which have been compared to Stream from the Heavens.

Yet Bangkok was growing as a base for British and other foreign companies and an increasing numbers of expatriate employees who demanded familiar western-type health care. Western style clinics and hospitals were unknown and doctors trained in contemporary western medicine were exceptional by their absence. On 20 August 1897 Bangkok's British community met at the British Legation with Mr George Grenville the resident British Minister and Consul General; this group proposed the establishment of a hospital modeled on contemporary British practice. As was the custom their decision was proposed to the Siamese monarch, King Chulalongkorn, who endorsed it and instructed the Ministry of Education to supervise the establishment of a nursing home exclusively for the care of Bangkok's foreign residents. The king stipulated that the nursing home should be a non-profit organisation and provided an annual grant of 960 baht. In the middle of 1898, two British nurses Matron Cawley and the hospital's first nursing sister Miss Hitchens arrived from the UK and by August the hospital was ready to receive its first patients. Its first home was in temporary rented accommodation a little way from its present location. In the first few years the hospital faced many difficulties, not the least of them financial. There were times when salaries could not be paid, but nurses being what they are, continued their work. In 1899 the Siamese economy faced a crisis of confidence resulting in an economic slump, making the hospital's precarious financial situation more insecure. But in the year between its opening and the financial crisis the Bangkok Nursing Home had proved its value to the expatriate community, it was clear that it had become a resource that was too valuable to lose. However the haemorrhaging of funds was not easily stemmed, so in April 1901 another meeting was held at the Court House of the British Legation. The original founding group was wound up and a new association established in September of that year, under the wing of a certain Mr Halliday who took over the assets of 2000 baht. Mr Halliday also had the responsibility of paying the nurses' salaries. Later in 1901 the Bangkok Nursing Home Association raised a loan of 50 000 baht and purchased a plot of land in Convent Road from the Crown Property Office. Just twelve months later a new hospital, built at a cost of 31 762 baht was opened. Teresa Lightwood contributed to the maternity services in Siam in the 1940s. For more information read Teresa of Siam published by Cassell in 1960. ===Development=== With an average load of only 50 patients each year between 1902 and 1912 it cannot be said that the nursing staff were overworked. But from this small base the hospital's fortune and revenues grew steadily to such a point that in 1912 a new wing was built. The new building was funded partly by public subscription and by a 500 baht donation from Siam's Anglophile King Vajiravudh. The King Chulalongkorn Wing housed an operating theatre and a maternity ward and was opened by King Vajiravudh on 23 July 1912. Just four years later further expansion was necessary and an 8 000 baht gift from the king facilitated further expansion. By 1922 the Bangkok Nursing Home's services were in such demand that it was necessary to build a new hospital. It appears that money was still tight and the required funds were not readily available. The governing Committee examined a number of funding methods including public subscriptions and a lottery; a combination of a lottery and public subscriptions were considered the best means of raising funds. The ambassadors of The Netherlands, Denmark, United States and Britain agreed to become patrons of the hospital. The king received a deputation and gave consent for the establishment of a lottery. The lottery raised 89 354 baht and public subscriptions 40 000 baht allowing the Nursing Home to buy land for its new building which opened thirty years after the founding of the original hospital. In the late 1980s early 90s the BNH was again stretched to its limit and in need of expansion. With its historical association with the Thai Royal Family, the management committee approached the Crown Property Bureau to become a partner in the building of a new international standard hospital. And on the 14 February 1996 the new Bangkok Nursing Home was opened and a few years later it re-branded itself as the BNH Hospital. ==Present status== A measure of its success is, that in its 107th year it is initiating another upgrading of its services and facilities. George Grenville and the founding fathers would be proud that the little nursing home in rented accommodation, based on British principles, is now one of the leading international hospitals in South East Asia. Because of its roots in the British community and more importantly as it was established as a charitable non-profit institution the BNH still values its role as a contributor to the well being of the people of Bangkok. To this end it organises a major semi-annual fund raising event in the form of a 'bed push'. Over the two years since the first bed push the BNH Hospital has raised over two million baht for a children's charity.

[Though 358 was the last formal meeting, there is no record of when it was actually dissolved and by whom, nor any reference to the last nasi's execution.] The latest effort was in 2004 when a group of seventy- one rabbis claiming to represent varied communities in Israel undertook a ceremony in Tiberias, where the original Sanhedrin was disbanded.Ceremony by rabbis That group claimed to re-establish the body, based on the proposal of Maimonides and the Jewish legal rulings of Rabbi Yosef Karo.The Sanhedrin Reestablished - Part I (17 May 2006) (Jewish Press)The Sanhedrin Reestablished - Part II (31 May 2006) (Jewish Press)The Sanhedrin Reestablished - Part III (7 June 2006) (Jewish Press) As of March 2010, that effort is ongoing and is supported by The Temple Institute. ==Sanhedrin in Judaism== The Sanhedrin is traditionally viewed as the last institution which commanded universal authority among the Jewish people in the long chain of tradition from Moses until the present day. Since its dissolution in 358 CE,The dissolution of the Sanhedrin, in terms of its power to give binding universal decisions, is usually dated to 358CE when Hillel II's mathematical Jewish Calendar was adopted. This marked the last universally accepted decision made by that body. there has been no universally recognized authority within Jewish law (Halakha). Maimonides (1135–1204) was one of the greatest scholars on Judaism of the Middle Ages, and is arguably one of the most widely known scholars among the Jewish people. Influenced by the rationalist school of thought and generally showing a preference for a natural (as opposed to miraculous) redemption for the Jewish people, Maimonides proposed a rationalist solution for achieving the goal of re-establishing the highest court in Jewish tradition and reinvesting it with the same authority it had in former years. There have been several attempts to implement Maimonides' recommendations, the latest being in modern times. ==The dissolution of the classical Sanhedrin== By the end of the Second Temple period, the Sanhedrin achieved its quintessential position, legislating on all aspects of Jewish religious and political life within the parameters laid down by Biblical and Rabbinic tradition. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Sanhedrin was re-established in Yavneh by agreement between Yochanan ben Zakai and Roman Emperor Vespasian. Vespasian agreed in part due to the perception that the Pharisees had not participated in the first revolt to the extent that other groups had. Thus the Sanhedrin in Yavneh was comprised almost exclusively of pharisaic scholars. The imperial Roman government recognized the Sanhedrin. They regarded the head of the Sanhedrin as their own paid government official with the status of Prefect. Roman legislation severely reduced the scope of its authority, but confirmed the body's ultimate authority in religious matters. In an attempt to quash revolutionary elements, Rome in effect declared one form of Judaism to be the only recognized form of religion. This led to persecution of sectarian groups, and attempts by these groups to find fault with the Sanhedrin before the Roman government. The Sanhedrin moved from Yavneh to Usha under the presidency of Gamaliel II in 80. In 116 it moved back to Yavneh, and again back to Usha. It moved in 140 to Shefaram under the presidency of Shimon ben Gamliel II, and to Beth Shearim and Sepphoris in 163, under the presidency of Judah haNasi. Finally, it moved to Tiberias in 193, under the presidency of Gamaliel III (193–220) ben Judah haNasi, where it became more of a consistory, but still retained, under the presidency of Judah II (220–270), the power of excommunication. During the presidency of Gamaliel IV (270–290), it dropped the name Sanhedrin, and its authoritative decisions were subsequently issued under the name of Beth HaMidrash. As a reaction to the emperor Julian's pro-Jewish stance, Theodosius I forbade the Sanhedrin to assemble and declared ordination illegal. (Roman law prescribed capital punishment for any Rabbi who received ordination and complete destruction of the town where the ordination occurred). However, since the Hebrew calendar was based on witnesses' testimony, that had become far too dangerous to collect, Hillel II recommended change to a mathematically based calendar that was adopted at a clandestine, and maybe final, meeting in 358. This marked the last universal decision made by that body. Gamaliel VI (400–425) was the Sanhedrin's last president. With the death of this patriarch, executed by Theodosius II for erecting new synagogues contrary to the imperial decree, use of the title Nasi, the last remains of the ancient Sanhedrin, became illegal after 425. There are records of what may have been of attempts to reform the Sanhedrin in Arabia,The Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614CE compared with Islamic conquest of 638CE in Jerusalem under the Calif 'Umar, and in Babylon (Iraq),Sefer Yuchsin, cf. Yarchei Kallah, Rabbi Nassan describes \\"the seventy judges who comprise the Sanhedrin\\" but none of these attempts were given any attention by Rabbinic authorities and little information is available about them. ==Maimonides' semicha by consensus== Maimonides was one of the greatest scholars of the Middle Ages, and is arguably one of the most widely accepted scholars among the Jewish people since the closing of the Talmud in 500 CE. Influenced by the rationalist school of thought and generally showing a preference for a natural (as opposed to miraculous) redemption for the Jewish people, Maimonides records that it is an absolute, binding requirement of the Jewish people in every generation to set up a Sanhedrin and courts of law. Faced with the demise of classical Semicha (Biblical ordination), he tentatively proposed a rationalist solution for achieving the goal of re- establishing the highest court in Jewish tradition and reinvesting it with the same authority it had in former years. Maimonides writes: :It appears to me [Maimonides] that if all the sages of the Land of Israel consent to appoint dayanim (judges) and grant them semichah (ordination), they have the law of musmachim and they can judge penalty cases and are authorized to grant semichah to others [thus restoring Biblical ordination]. :If so, why did the sages bemoan [the loss of] semichah? So that the judgment of penalty cases wouldn't disappear from among Israel because Jews are so spread out that it's not possible to get their consent [to authorize a dayan]. If someone were to receive semichah from someone who already has semichah, then he does not require their consent – he may judge penalty cases for everyone since he received semichah from beis din (rabbinical court). However, this matter requires a final decision. :(Rambam, Hilchos Sanhedrin 4:11) The wording of this teaching is vague and tentative and leaves several points open. Firstly, it opens with \\"It appears to me\\" and ends with \\"this matter requires a final decision\\". Secondly, it is not specified what is meant by \\"consent\\". Thirdly, it leaves open as to who are \\"all the sages of the Land of Israel\\" and lastly—although not apparent here—what is really meant by the word \\"all\\". These questions led to significant debate within Rabbinic circles, from those who completely disregarded this teaching to others who differed on its meaning. The differing interpretations gradually coalesced by the time of Yosef Karo who recorded as definitive Jewish law that ordination could be established by consensus, and accepted such ordination himself. While Rabbi Yosef Karo's magnum opus, the Shulchan Aruch, is considered the most authoritative collection of Jewish Law in use today, his views on this subject are not widely known.Rabbi Yosef Karo's treatise Maaseh Beis Din and his commentary the Beis Yosef, Choshen Mishpat 295, see also Rabbi Yakov Beirav Iggeret Hasemicha In general, religious Jews not familiar with his writings on the subject tend to reject outright the notion of establishing a Sanhedrin by consensus. The matter of restoring semicha by consensus has been a matter of dispute within the orthodox community. Against the view are such authorities as the Rabbi Avraham Yeshayah Karelitz (the Chazon Ish), who quoted Rabbi David ibn abi Zimra (the Radvaz) on the subject, who in turn sided with Rabbi Levi Ibn Chaviv (the Ralbach), who based his claims on the Rabbi Moses ben Nachman (Ramban) that it is impossible to form a Sanhedrin before Moshiach, the Jewish messiah, comes. On the other hand, authorities based on MaimonidesMishne Torah, Hilchos Sanhedrin 4:11 and Rabbi Yosef Karo,Choshen Mishpat 295 author of the Shulchan Aruch, were of the opinion that semicha could be established by consensus and a Sanhedrin could be formed without waiting for Moshiach. Rabbi Yisrael of Shklov, a leading disciple of the Vilna Gaon, wrote in the name of the Gaon that there was no need to wait for Moshiach before forming a Sanhedrin.The attempt of Rabbi Yisrael of Shklov to re-establish the Sanhedrin in 1830 (Cf. Attempt by Rabbi Yisroel Shklover, 1830 to revive Semicha.) ==A brief summary of the last five rabbinical attempts to create a Sanhedrin== A discussion of the last five rabbinical attempts to reinstate Semicha can be found in the Wikipedia entry on Semicha. Rabbi Bavad, a member of the new Sanhedrin, gives a brief discussion of those attempts and how they affected the most recent attempt.HaSanhedrin HaSamchut VeHaChiddush, Appendix I, by Rabbi Bavad, Beit El Press, 2005 *Attempt by Rabbi Jacob Berab in 1538. Rabbi Berab assembled 25 of the most leading Rabbis of the Holy Land, who at the time were located in Safed, and re-instituted the Semicha. They convened and ordained Rabbi Berab as their \\"Chief Rabbi\\". The Rabbis of Jerusalem felt a slight on their honor and declared the election invalid, and a major dispute ensued. Some Rabbis held that it wasn't possible to renew the Semicha, but Rabbi Yosef Karo, author of the Shulchan Aruch, took the position that the procedure was valid and he was one of four Rabbi ordained by Rabbi Berab. Rabbi Karo in turn ordained Rabbi Moshe Alshich who in turn ordained Rabbi Hayyim Vital the prime disciple of the Ari Hakodosh. The new Sanhedrin has modeled its actions after this attempt. *Attempt by Rabbi Yisroel of Shklov in 1830. In Rabbi Yisroel's lifetime the Turkish empire was crumbling, and for the first time in almost a thousand years westerners were being allowed into Yemen. Scientific journals of the time seriously speculated that the remnants of the lost ten tribes would be found. Based on Jewish traditions and \\"scientific evidence\\" Rabbi Yisroel sent an emissary to obtain Semicha from these lost tribes. In the end, no remnant was found, however the responses involved in this shed light on the Vilna Gaon's position that it was permissible to attempt to re-establish the Sanhedrin. *Attempt by Rabbi Aharon Mendel haCohen in 1901. Rabbi Mendel collected the approval of approximately 500 leading Rabbis in favor of the renewal of Semicha according to Maimonides. His involvement in the founding of Agudath Israel and the breakout of World War I distracted him from implementing this plan. The new Sanhedrin bases its use of phones, fax and regular mail rather than physically assembling \\"all the scholars of the Land of Israel\\" on the rabbinical responsa surrounding this attempt. *Attempt by Rabbi Zvi Kovsker in 1940. Rabbi Zvi Kovsker came to Israel from Soviet Russia. Seeing the condition of Jews in the years leading up to World War II, he undertook an effort to contact and work with many Rabbinic leaders in Israel towards getting their approval for the renewal of Semicha, and the reestablishment of a Sanhedrin, as an authentic government for the Jewish people (this was before the establishment of the State of Israel). His efforts to lobby the Rabbinic leaders were the model for twenty years of groundwork and discussions by the organizers of the new Sanhedrin. *Attempt by Rabbi Yehuda Leib Maimon in 1949. Rabbi Maimon proposed turning the Israeli Rabbinate into a Sanhedrin. The perceived subordinate position to the government of Israel was compared to Napoleon's Sanhedrin, and led to strong vocal opposition by most Haredi rabbis. Israel's Chief Ashkenazi rabbi at the time Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, was hesitant to support this goal, and the idea eventually died away. ==Rabbi Beirav, the model for the latest attempt== A closer look at the attempt by Rabbi Beirav,Based on Jewish Encyclopedia: BERAB, JACOB, Rabbi Tzvi Eidan's Asot Mishpat, and also Semicha and Sanhedrin Controversies by Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff and the involvement of the Beis Yosef, which was the model for the current attempt: Rabbi Yakov Berav (1474–1546), known as the Mahari Beirav, was born in Spain. Evidence of the great respect is afforded by the following lines of Rabbi Abraham Gavison in Omer ha-Shikchah: \\"Say not that the lamp of the Law no longer burns in Israel! Yakov Beirav has come back! once more he sojourns among us!\\" In 1533 he became Rabbi at Cairo; and several years after he seems to have finally settled in Safed, which then contained the largest and most learned Jewish community in the Land of Israel. After the Spanish expulsion, many Jews remained in Spain, practicing their Judaism in secret, while publicly appearing to be Christians. Thousands of these Marrano Jews eventually escaped to areas where they could practice their religion with relative freedom, yet they were haunted by the sins they had committed in previous years. As chief Rabbi of Safed, Rabbi Yakov Beirav proposed the creation of Jewish courts that would carry out the punishment of malkos, lashes, which releases someone from the punishment of kareis, or excision (Mishnah Makos 23a). But in order to create these Jewish courts, classical ordination had to be reinstituted. ===Renewal of semicha=== For a year, Rabbi Yakov Beirav discussed the issues of re-establishment institution of semicha with the scholars of Safed. After much discussion the scholars at Safed came to the conclusion that Maimonides' view was correct, and that there was a pressing need to re-establish the Sanhedrin. In 1538 twenty-five Rabbis met in an assembly at Safed and ordained Rabbi Yakov Beirav, giving him the right to ordain others who would then form a Sanhedrin. After sending a delegation to Jerusalem, Rabbi Yakov Beirav expounded on Shabbat before all the scholars of Safed the halachic basis of the re-establishment of semicha and its implications, with an intent to dispel any remaining doubts. On hearing of this event, approximately two hundred scholars, most of the scholars in Land of Israel, also expressed their consent. To obtain the good-will of the scholars of Jerusalem, Rabbi Yakov Beirav sent Rabbi Shlomo Chazan to inform them of the reinstitution of semicha and to obtain their approval. He extended semicha to the chief Rabbi at Jerusalem, Levi ben Yakov ibn Chaviv, (Ralbach). ===The dispute=== The Ralbach however rejected the semicha. He considered it an insult to his dignity and to the dignity of Jerusalem that so important a change should be effected without consultation of the scholars of Jerusalem. Rabbi Moshe deCastro of Jerusalem also expressed doubts over the applicability of semicha. Because of this opposition some of the scholars of Safed also began to entertain doubts. Rabbi Yakov Beirav again assembled the scholars of Safed, and reviewed the halachic basis for re-establishment of semicha. Rabbi Yosef Karo and others sent a treatise Maaseh Beis Din to the scholars of Jerusalem explaining the basis for semicha and protesting their opposition to its re-establishment. In the course of time, the Ralbach put his objections to Rabbi Yakov Beirav's semicha in writing, involving additional scholars in the dispute. In response Rabbi Yakov Beirav composed and distributed Iggeret Hasemicha to settle any halachic doubts. The dispute lasted for a year. In general the scholars outside of Land of Israel did not get involved at this stage in the dispute, with the exception of the Radbaz. The Ralbach's objections centered around the following points:Shealos v'teshuvos leRalbach by Rabbi Levi Ibn Chaviv # The re-establishment of semicha will cause the speeding up of redemption, which is not permitted. # Maimonides closing words, \\"This matter requires a final decision\\" shows that he was not fully decided on this ruling. Since Maimonides was uncertain and Nahmanides was certain,Sefer Hamitzvos, Aseh 153 by Rabbi Moshe ben Nahman Gerondi (Ramban) the law follows Nahmanides. #Lastly that the role of Sanhedrin had to be complete, the Calendar had to immediately change which could cause division among the Jewish people #Even if Maimonides was correct, because the scholars of Jerusalem were not present the election was invalid. Rabbi Yakov Beirav countered with the following points:Iggeret Hasemicha by Rabbi Yakov Beirav #First, that the re- establishment semicha is not interfering with the process of redemption, rather it is simply the fulfillment of a positive mitzvah. #The Maimonides' closing words refer to a different legal matter. #There was no problem leaving the Jewish calendar unchanged. #The most learned scholars lived in Safed and that was sufficient; in Jewish law the word \\"all\\" means the \\"main part\\". (The Ralbach did not differ with Rabbi Yakov Beirav on this point, only he objected that \\"all\\" must include the scholars of Jerusalem. He did not claim that every scholar in all of Land of Israel should be present in the assembly). In his treatise Maaseh Beis Din,Maaseh Beis Din by Rabbi Yosef Karo Rabbi Yosef Karo explained Maimonides' principle of \\"all\\". There he writes that Maimonides meant that if one Rabbi is willing to defer to the knowledge and wisdom of another Rabbi - those lesser rabbis are already included to the greater rabbis and need not be included in the count of \\"all\\" (meaning that the scholars of Jerusalem did not need to be included in the election process). To further show that he held that this opinion, he accepted the Semicha of Rabbi Beirav, and passed it on for several generations. ===Conclusion=== It is known that Rabbi Yosef Karo and Rabbi Moses of Trani were two of the four men ordained by Rabbi Yakov Beirav. The others are assumed to be Rabbi Abraham Shalom and Rabbi Israel de Curial and/or Rabbi Yoshiyahu Pinto. After weighing the objections of Ralbach, Rabbi Yosef Karo chose to be part of the Mahari Beirav's attempt to reinstate the Sanhedrin in his time. This is the source for the acronym MaRaN, which stands for the words \\"ordained by two hundred Rabbis\\" (Masa'im Rabanan Nismach). Scholars never criticized Rabbi Yosef Karo for this decision. Though there were arguments over many years about the authority of the Shulchan Aruch until it became universally accepted, yet nowhere does one criticize Rabbi Yosef Karo for the fact that he received semicha from Rabbi Yakov Beirav and transmitted it onward. Rabbi Yosef Karo is known to have used his semicha to ordain Rabbi Moses Alsheich, who in turn, ordained Rabbi Chaim Vital. Thus semicha can be traced for at least four generations. Rabbi Yosef Karo, in his commentary the Beis Yosef (Choshen Mishpat 295), answered the objections of the Ralbach by recording as definitive Jewish law the Maimonides' opinion that semicha can be renewed by consensus. However this view is not shared by all modern rabbis, as Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff writes: Although Rav Yosef Karo had received this semicha and ordained Rav Moshe Alshich, it is not clear he utilized the semicha in any other way. Nowhere does he refer to a renewal of semicha, and furthermore, numerous places in Shulchan Aruch would be written differently if its author assumed that a beis din of semuchim existed today. In all these places, he assumes that no beis din today exists that is authorized to paskin on the laws of penalties and punishments... Although Rav Moshe Alshich ordained Rav Chayim Vital (Birkei Yosef, Choshen Mishpat 1:7), who was renowned as the primary disciple of the Arizal, the semicha trail appears to end at this point. There is no indication of anyone continuing the semicha project after this time... according to Rabbi Kaganoff, \\"we can assume that the psak of the Ralbach and Radvaz was accepted that we should not introduce semicha on our own.\\"Semicha and Sanhedrin Controversies of the 16th and 21st Centuries by Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff ==See also== * Sanhedrin * Semicha * List of national legal systems ==Footnotes * Sanhedrin official website Category:Israeli society Category:Jewish courts and civil law Category:Orthodox Judaism Category:Jewish messianism ","title":"Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin"},{"id":"6195724","text":"The Oregon Student Association (OSA), a non-profit organization, was established in 1975 to represent, serve and protect the collective interests of students in post-secondary education in the U.S. state of Oregon.Vanguard Portland State University \\"OSA lobbies for student issues every other year to the Oregon legislature.

They are similar to dental retainers, but without the front wire. Palatal obturators are typically short- term prosthetics used to close defects of the hard/soft palate that may affect speech production or cause nasal regurgitation during feeding. Following surgery, there may remain a residual orinasal opening on the palate, alveolar ridge, or vestibule of the larynx. A palatal obturator may be used to compensate for hypernasality and to aid in speech therapy targeting correction of compensatory articulation caused by the cleft palate. In simpler terms, a palatal obturator covers any fistulas (or \\"holes\\") in the roof of the mouth that lead to the nasal cavity, providing the wearer with a plastic/acrylic, removable roof of the mouth, which aids in speech, eating, and proper air flow. Palatal obturators are not to be confused with palatal lifts or other prosthetic devices. A palatal obturator may be used in cases of a deficiency in tissue, when a remaining opening in the palate occurs. In some cases it may be downsized gradually so that tissue can strengthen over time and compensate for the decreasing size of the obturator. The palatal lift however, is used when there is not enough palatal movement. It raises the palate and reduces the range of movement necessary to provide adequate closure to separate the nasal cavity from the oral cavity. Speech bulbs and palatal lifts aid in velopharyngeal closure and do not obturate a fistula. A speech bulb, yet another type of prosthetic device often confused with a palatal obturator, contains a pharyngeal section, which goes behind the soft palate. Palatal obturators are needed by individuals with cleft palate, those who have had tumors removed or have had traumatic injuries to their palate. ==Types of palatal obturators== A palatal plate is a prosthetic device, generally consisting of an acrylic plate and retention clasps of orthodontic wire, which covers a fistula of the palate. It may be used to aid in improving articulation and feeding. The blockage of the opening helps improve hypernasality and suckling ability for babies. In the case of a labial-oral- nasal fistula, the plate may include an anterior upward extension to fully occlude the passageway running between the labial surface of the alveolus, alveolus, and nasal cavity. The plate may be constructed to include any congenitally missing teeth to improve articulation and appearance. Individuals who use palatal plates must be monitored periodically by their dental professionals due to possible tissue irritation by the plate. Materials such as food particles, oral mucosa and secretions may cause buildup on the upper surface of the plate; therefore, it is essential to clean a palatal obturator at least twice a day to avoid tissue irritation. There are also more specific terms used for obturators depending on their time and purpose of use: Photo Examples of the Latham Device or the Nasal Alveolar are prime examples for use in Cleft Palate Deformities. * A modification obturator may be used in the short term to block a palatal fistula, for augmentation of the seal and to separate the oral and nasal cavities. * An interim palatal obturator is used post-palatal surgery. This obturator aids in closing the remaining fistula and is used when no further surgical procedures are planned. It must be frequently revised. * A definitive obturator is used when further rehabilitation is not possible for the patient and is intended for long-term use. Palatal adhesives are oral adhesives or skin barrier materials used to occlude a fistula of the hard palate. Obturators of this type must be removed before eating and drinking. Users must cut the new piece of adhesive and hold it over the fistula until it adheres. Adhesives are not to be used for soft palate fistulae if the soft palate has some mobility due to possible unintentional dislodging and digestion of the material. ==The Nance Obturator== This fixed obturator is based on the Nance appliance, which was originally used as a space maintainer in dentistry and orthodontics, but has been redesigned for closing anterior palatal fistulas in patients with cleft lip and palate. The Nance obturator may be used when the surgical closure of the fistula is not feasible and a removable device is not successful. ==Speech== Often a palatal obturator is used because a palatal fistula can affect development and proper articulation. As fistula sizes vary, small fistulae tend to result in little to no speech alterations whereas large fistulae tend to result in audible nasal emissions and weak pressure with and/or without hypernasality. Misarticulations, abnormal nasal resonance and nasal escape or air often results from the problem. Fistulae may decrease intraoral air pressure during production of oral pressure consonants causing distortion of sounds as well as increase in nasal airflow. It is common for an individual with a fistula to compensate for a loss of pressure during speech sound production by attempting to regulate intraoral air pressure with increasing respiration effort and using compensatory articulation. Middorsum palatal stops (atypical place of articulation) often results from palatal fistulae causing sound distortions during speech. Occlusion for the fistula is attempted by speakers with deviant tongue placements during these palatal stops. The palatal obturation may be managed temporarily or may be sustained for longer periods of time. Location- specific palatal obturation has been documented to significantly improve articulation errors, hypernasality (based on listener judgments), and nasal emissions (immediately post-obturation only). Usage of more anterior tongue placements is considered a primary target for speech therapy. The relationship between palatal openings and articulation is important to note prior to surgical plans to ascertain timing of speech therapy and most appropriate therapy goals and approach. Speech therapy may be most beneficial prior to sustained palatal obturation rather than short-term obturation. ==See also== * Cleft Palate * Prostheses * Dentures * Prosthodontics == References == * Borzabadi-Farahani, A., Groper, J.N., Tanner, A.M., Urata, M.M., Panossian, A., & Yen, S.L.

It is the highest inter-county hurling competition for male players between the ages of 17 and 20 in the province of Leinster. The championship was contested as the Leinster Under-21 Championship between 1964 and 2018 before changing to an under-20 age category from 2019. It is sponsored by Bord Gáis Energy. The series of games are played during the summer months with the Leinster final currently being played in July. The prize for the winning team is the Seán Robbins Cup. The championship has always been played on a straight knock-out basis whereby once a team loses they are eliminated from the series. The Leinster Championship is an integral part of the wider All-Ireland Under-20 Hurling Championship. The winners and runners-up of the Leinster final, like their counterparts in the Munster Championship, advance to the semi-final stage of the All-Ireland series of games. Eight teams currently participate in the Munster Championship. Kilkenny is the most successful team with 26 titles, followed by Wexford with 17 titles. The title has been won by six different teams, four of whom have won the title more than once. Kilkenny are the current holders. ==HistoryCreation=== The Leinster Championship began in 1964 in response to a Congress motion put forward by the Kerry County Board for the introduction of a new championship grade. It was the fifth championship to be created after the senior, junior, minor and intermediate grades. ===Beginnings=== The inaugural Leinster Championship featured Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Louth, Offaly, Westmeath and Wexford. Louth and Westmeath contested the very first match on Sunday 29 March 1964. Wexford won the inaugural championship. ===Team dominance=== Since the beginning the championship has been dominated by Kilkenny and Wexford. They won all bar one of the available championship titles between 1964 and 1977 and have won a combined total of 42 championship titles. Kilkenny also have the distinction of being the only team to win four championships in-a-row, achieving this feat on two separate occasions. Dublin were the only team beside Kilkenny and Wexford to win the championship, with their lone title being claimed in 1967. Offaly and Laois added their names to the roll of honour in 1978 and 1983 respectively, however, the rest of the century belonged to Kilkenny and Wexford once again. ===Proposed changes=== In 2008 a motion was brought before a special Congress in an effort to combat player burnout. It was proposed to merge the existing under-21 and minor championships to create a new Leinster Under-19 Hurling Championship based on the provincial system. This motion was defeated by 115 votes to 58. A similar motion was later introduced in an effort to lower the age and create a new Leinster Under-20 Championship based on the provincial system, however, this motion was also defeated. ===Age change=== At the GAA Congress on 24 February 2018, the age limit of the championship was changed to twenty, following a successful motion by the Offaly County Board. In contrast to Gaelic football, under-20 hurlers are eligible to play both under-20 and senior hurling for their county. ==Current formatChampionship=== The Leinster Championship is a knockout tournament with pairings drawn at random. Each match is played as a single leg. If a match is drawn there is a period of extra time, however, if the sides still remain level a replay is required. There are nine teams in the Leinster Championship. The finalists from the previous year receive a bye to separate semi-finals. The four \\"weakest\\" teams contest two play-off rounds with the winner joining the other three teams in the championship proper at the quarter-final stage. ===Qualification for the All-Ireland Championship=== As of the 2018 championship qualification for the All-Ireland Championship has changed due to the introduction of a \\"back door\\" for defeated finalists. Both the champions and runners-up qualify for the All-Ireland semi-finals. ==TeamsNon-Leinster teams=== On 30 September 2017, 72% of delegates at GAA Special Congress voted in favour of allowing Galway into the Leinster Championship along with any Ulster teams – as of agreed by the Ulster and Leinster Councils. ==VenuesHistory=== Leinster Championship matches have always been played on a home and away basis whereby every second meeting between teams is played at the home venue of one of them. All of the current teams have home and away agreements, however, Antrim and Galway are not permitted to use their home grounds because they are outside the province of Leinster. ===Attendances=== Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for the Leinster Council and for the teams involved. ===Final=== The venue for the final also comes under the terms of the individual home and away agreements between the teams involved, however, on some occasions a neutral venue was used. The attendance at the 2017 Leinster final was 6,089. ==Managers== Managers in the Leinster Championship are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection, and sourcing of players from the club championships. Their influence varies from county-to-county and is related to the individual county boards. The manager is assisted by a team of two or three selectors and an extensive backroom team consisting of various coaches. The under-20 team manager also works closely with the senior team manager due to an overlap of players on both teams. Prior to the development of the concept of a manager in the 1970s, teams were usually managed by a team of selectors with one member acting as chairman. {  - + Winning managers (2000–present) - !Manager !Team !Wins !Winning years - border J.

The Seán Robbins Cup is held by the winning team until the following year's final. Traditionally, the presentation is made at a special rostrum in the stand where GAA and political dignitaries and special guests view the match. The cup is decorated with ribbons in the colours of the winning team. During the game the cup actually has both teams' sets of ribbons attached and the runners-up ribbons are removed before the presentation. The winning captain accepts the cup on behalf of his team before giving a short speech. Individual members of the winning team then have an opportunity to come to the rostrum to lift the cup. In accordance with GAA rules, the Leinster Council awards up to twenty-four gold medals to the winners of the Leinster final. ==Sponsorship== Since 2003, the Leinster Championship has been sponsored.

It is a fairly new field of study, developing largely in the 20th Century. It can be considered a branch of expression theoryMilton H. Snoeyenbos and Carole A. Knapp, Dance Theory and Dance Education, Journal of Aesthetic Education, Vol. 13, No. 3 (Jul., 1979), pp. 17-30. and is closely related to music theory and specifically musicality.Nichelle, Musicality In Dance: What Is It? Can It Be Taught? March 29, 2010 While musicality deals with finding a particular matching pair of dance and music that fit each other in various respects, dance theory is a broad term encompassing the origins, styles, genre, footwork, artistic expression of dance. Three broad categories of dance theory, as you may find them described in universities or dance institutes, are philosophy (concerning the aesthetic meanings behind dance, or semiotics), choreology (movement analysis and description), sociology (regarding the role of dance in society and culture).Contemporary-Dance.org Dance Theory Dance theory deals with anatomical movements (such as foot-work, etc.), as well as partner interactions, and their associations to each other and to music as art. It explores the communicative, physical, mental, emotional, and artistic aspects of dance as a medium of human expression and interaction. In doing so the various nuances between the dance genres and styles are analyzed with respect to their social settings and cultures. As dance is a ubiquitous element of culture, dance theory attempts to determine the instinctual nature of dance, and what makes various movements appear natural or forced. It is possible through understanding including the writing and drawing of dances within a sphere to understand that all dance is based on natural body movements that is the moving of joints limbs and legs and fingers, dance theory is based on these founding principles that is the sphere and lines of the body to derive and show and demonstrate how dance is done, which movements to do by which movement at which speed so hypothetically it is possible to draw and work out a dance by using sphere lines and arrows to build up a dance and a routine starting with examples and extenuating etc many dance books state how this is done. ==See also== * Dance research ==References== Theory Category:Dance research ","title":"Dance theory"},{"id":"6195818","text":"The hardyhead silverside (Atherinomorus lacunosus), also known as the broad- banded hardyhead, broad-banded silverside, Capricorn hardyhead, pitted hardyhead, robust hardyhead, robust silverside, slender hardyhead and wide- banded hardyhead silverside, is a silverside of the family Atherinidae. It occurs in the Indo-Pacific near the surface as well as in the Mediterranean, having invaded as a Lessepsian migrant through the Suez Canal. A bank of young Atherinomorus lacunosus. ==Description== The hardyhead silverside is a robust, broad headed, small fish which is distinguished by having a very low and wide lateral process of premaxilla with the upper margin of the anterior bone of the lower jaw which bears the teeth is almost flat distally and has no distinct tubercle at its posterior end. The posterior of the jaw reaches at least as far as the vertical through anterior margin of the pupil. The mouth has small teeth on palate which do not form obvious ridges. The anus is usually behind but close to the posterior tip of the pelvic fin. There are 18-24 lower gill rakers and the midlateral scale count is 40-44. The lower edge of the midlateral band reaches below the ventral end of the third scale row and nearly extends to the center of the fourth scale row where it is level with the origin of the anal fin. The dorsal fin has 5-8 spines and 9-10 soft rays while the anal fin has 1 spine and 12-17 soft rays and it has 43-44 vertebrae. They can grow up to 14 cm but are more usually in the range 10–12 cm. Freshly caught specimens are overall silvery in colour, tending to greenish on the dorsal area but with a bright blue strip along the flank, dusky fins and a translucent appearance when seen live in the water. ==Distribution== The hardyhead silverside has an Indo-Pacific distribution which extends from the eastern coasts of Africa east to Tonga, north as far as southern Japan, and south to northern Australia; it appears to be absent in the Andaman Sea and to be replaced by Atherinomorus insularum in Hawaii. It was the second species of Red Sea creature, following Pampus argenteus, to be recorded in the Mediterranean Sea following the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, being reported by Tillier in 1902 and had spread north westwards as far as Greece. ==Biology== The hardyhead silverside occurs commonly in large schools along sandy shorelines and reef margins. It is reported to be a largely nocturnal fish which forms schools numbering from several hundred individuals to aggregations which may be over 100m long and 20m wide. Feeds on a wide variety of plankton and small benthic invertebrates with foraging taking place mostly during the night following the dispersal of the schools. It can also be found in estuarine waters. In New Caledonia, hardyhead silversides attain sexual maturity just before they reach a year old, spawning from late August through to December. The species has a relatively low fecundity and this combined with the extended spawning season suggests that this species utilises a spawning strategy which involves each individual female spawning a number of times. They have a short lifespan and most normally die after the spawning season although some individuals survived into their second year. However, in the Seychelles there were two spawning seasons, in April–June and in September–December, which corresponded to the periods of warmer water between the monsoons while in the Marshall Islands spawning occurred all year. In South Africa spawning has been observed near estuaries and takes place from October to January. The eggs bear fine filaments which are used to adhere the eggs to the substrate or to other submerged surfaces. The hardyhead silverside is an important forage fish for larger fish species such as sharks, tunas, needlefish and amberjacks which capture them by associating with and attacking the day schools. They are also preyed on by sea birds such as terns, boobies, gulls, egrets and herons. It also plays host to parasites such as the cymothoid isopod Livoneca and the trematodes Overstreetia cribbi and O. sodwanaensis. ==Uses== The hardyhead silversides is sold fresh, or salted and dried in Asia and is referred to a whitebait in some English speaking parts of the world where it occurs. ==Taxonomy and naming== Atherinomorus lacunosus has been lumped with A. forskalli and A. pinguis in the past but is now regarded as separate, although this has caused some confusions as to whether the species which has invaded the Mediterranean is A. lacunosus or A. forskalli. More recent DNA studies have shown that this species, and other species in the genus Atherinomorus, are actually made up of a number of cryptic species and that the populations identified as A. lacunosus in the Red Sea and Mediterranean may represent three such species. The name Atherinomorus lacunosus means the hollow bearing (lacunosis) smelt (Atherinomorus), while the common name refers to its robust head and silvery flanks. ==References== Category:Atherinomorus Category:Fish described in 1801 ","title":"Hardyhead silverside"},{"id":"6195844","text":"Valentin Avrorin (1907, Tambov - 1977) was a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR and an expert in languages.

The band evolved from British-influenced new wave rock to a more personal rock sound influenced by Mediterranean vibes; their songs are mostly sung in Italian. ==HistoryFirst era (1980-1989)=== The band was formed in Florence in 1980, and was named after the telex code for Via dei Bardi, Florence, where the band rehearsed (Località ITalia FIrenze Via dei BArdi). The early line-up consisted of: Federico Renzulli (nicknamed Ghigo) on guitars and lead vocals, Gianni Maroccolo on bass, Sandro Dotta on lead guitar (who left the band after a few weeks) and Francesco Calamai on drums. Antonio Aiazzi on keyboards and Piero Pelù on vocals joined the band shortly after. Punk and new wave were a huge influence on the band's early songs, which often had English lyrics. Their first show took place on 6 December 1980 in Settignano, near Florence. The band’s first recording was a five-track EP titled Guerra (1982), followed one year later by a 7\\" single, \\"Luna/La preda\\", which won the band first place at the 2° Festival Rock Italiano. Meanwhile, Calamai was replaced on drums by Renzo Franchi; with this line-up, the band worked on a soundtrack, Eneide di Krypton. After a while, Franchi then left the band, to be replaced by Luca De Benedectis, known as Ringo De Palma with whom the band recorded Yassassin, a single containing a brand new track, \\"Electrica Danza\\", and a David Bowie cover.  Trilogy of power  The band released their first full-length album, Desaparecido (\\"Disappeared\\" in Spanish) in 1985. Following the EP, Transea (1986) and the second full-length 17 Re (17 Kings in Italian), Litfiba toured for the first time, subsequently releasing 12/5/87 (aprite i vostri occhi), their first live album. Litfiba 3 (1988) was the last recording featuring Maroccolo, de Palma et Aiazzi as permanent members, although the latter would stay as session musician until 1996. The first three albums form the \\"Trilogy of power\\" (in Italian, \\"Trilogia del potere\\"), stating the refusal of every kind of totalitarianism. The release of the Pirata live album, recorded on the 1988-89 tour, marked the end of the \\"Trilogy of power\\" years. ===Second era (1989-1999)=== The second leg of the tour was made into an aptly titled VHS, \\"Pirata Tour\\", and featured Roberto Terzani on bass, Daniele Trambusti on drums and Candelo Cabezas on percussions besides Pelù, Renzulli and Aiazzi. Pelù and Renzulli then went back to the studio to record El Diablo, an album with a much rawer sound, warmly received by fans and critics alike. The following tour, with Federico Poggipollini on rhythm guitar, was also filmed for home video release. Sales of the (1992) released Sogno Ribelle album proved the band’s new fame. The record was a compilation of old songs from previous albums rearranged with a more hard rock sounding, live tracks and an unreleased song, titled \\"Linea d'ombra\\". It was once more followed by a VHS featuring music videos, live performances samples and interviews. The year after, the band released its harder and most rock’n’roll album to date, Terremoto (\\"Earthquake\\"), soon followed by the double live CD Colpo di coda. When changing their label from CGD to EMI (with legal complications due to the release of unauthorized compilations), the band hired a new bass player, Daniele \\"Barny\\" Bagni, and recorded the third volume of its \\"tetralogy of elements\\": El Diablo was celebrating fire, Terremoto soil, the new album Spirito (1994, whose name should have been Serpente d’asfalto) celebrates the air. The record was, as usual, followed by a VHS: Lacio drom which contains extracts from the \\"Spirito tour\\". The 1997 Mondi Sommersi album, with its 500,000 copies sold in a few weeks, brought out the missing element, water, as Aiazzi left the band, replaced on keyboards by Terzani, who also remained the second guitar player (as it appears to be in the last tour). Litfiba's biggest tour was immortalized on a VHS, whose profits went to the victims of earthquakes in Umbria and Marche regions, and on a double live CD both titled Croce e delizia. Infinito (1999) was the very last chapter of the band’s history with frontman Piero Pelù as a vocalist. Though much criticized because of its so- called \\"light\\" sound, the album sold 650,000 copies. On the \\"Infinito tour\\", tensions between Pelù and Renzulli became unbearable. The last show with Pelù took place at the \\"Monza Rock Festival 1999\\". He stopped being officially part of the band on July 11, 1999, subsequently starting a solo career. ===Third era (1999-2009)=== Pelù took away in his farewell to the band three of Litfiba's musicians: Bagni, Terzani and Caforio. Renzulli lost the property of the band’s logo, a horned heart, but kept the name Litfiba, which is copyrighted under his name. The guitarist then decided to follow on immediately with a renewed and rejuvenated band, including the new singer Gianluigi Cabo Cavallo, bass and drums player Gianluca Venier, and Ugo Nativi, coming from the funk-rock band Malfunk. The 2000 album, first with new line- up, Elettromacumba reached 100,000 sales. On the following \\"Elettro tour\\", Litfiba, with Mauro Sabbione, who had already played on the El Diablo album, on keyboards, played in smaller halls than before. After the tour, the band released Live on Line, including 15 tracks recorded during the last tour available only for download under MP3 format through web portal Lycos. The musicians went back to the studio, with Nativi replaced on drums by Gianmarco Colzi, who had played with band Rockgalileo and singer Biagio Antonacci, for the recording of the Insidia album (2001). The record was much different from the previous album, due to darker lyrics with many symbolic references and the significant use of electronics. It was soon followed by the \\"Insidia tour\\", a 73 concerts tour that was the first part of the \\"Never ending tour\\". The band was then requested to release the soundtrack for the Italian version of the Tomb raider 6 - The Angel of Darkness video game, resulting in the issue of \\"Larasong\\", a stand-alone single. Former keyboards player Antonio Aiazzi returned to the band for the 2003 \\"Lara Tour\\" and 2004 \\"04 Tour\\", the second and third part of the \\"Never ending tour\\". The last concert was recorded for the release of Litfiba's official first DVD. The last album to date, Essere o sembrare (2005), appeared to be moderately inspired and had a relative success. The release of the record was followed by a short tour, almost 15 concerts, followed by others during 2006 summer. In late 2006 singer Gianluigi Gianluigi Cabo Cavallo leaves the band, followed by bass player Gianluca Venier and keyboard player Antonio Aiazzi. Filippo Margheri, who previously fronted Miir, replaced Cavallo, while Roberto Terzani, who had previously played with Litfiba, and Pino Fidanza join respectively at bass and drums. ===Fourth era (2009-2013)=== In November 2009, the long-time manager of the band Alberto Pirelli announced Litfiba was going to break up. One month later, on 11 December 2009, a message posted on the official website of the band announced the surprising reunion of the two historical founders: Piero Pelù and Ghigo Renzulli. They played four concerts in spring 2010, under the moniker Litfiba: Milan (13 April), Florence (16 April), Rome (19 April), Acireale (21 April). A longer tour and a new album was expected in the second half of the year. The band publishes the successful live album \\"Stato Libero di Litfiba\\" in which also two unreleased tracks are included: \\"Sole Nero\\" and \\"Barcollo\\". On January the 17th 2012 came out the new album Grande nazione, anticipated by the singles Squalo (25 November 2011) and La mia valigia (13 January 2012). In January 2013 the band reunited with original founders Gianni Maroccolo and Antonio Aiazzi, and start a tour called \\"Trilogia 1983-1989\\", playing only songs from the historical \\"Trilogy Of Power\\" plus some related singles from the same period. New addition on drums is Luca Martelli (from Giorgio Canali's Rossofuoco). The band publishes a live cd (\\"Trilogia '83-'89\\") at the end of the hystorical reunion. Later in 2013, Litfiba enter a hiatus to permit its members to pursue their personal and artistic projects. After a last gig with the \\"Trilogia\\" line-up in Sardinia, the band announces for 2015 a tour which celebrates the following era of the band. The \\"Tetralogia Tour\\" is focused on the 4 albums \\"El Diablo\\", \\"Terremoto\\", \\"Spirito\\" and \\"Mondi Sommersi\\", dedicated to the elements of fire, earth, air and water respectively. Ghigo and Piero hit the stage with a renewed line-up which involves again drummer Luca Martelli, keyboardist Federico Sagona (already on \\"Stato Libero\\" and \\"Grande Nazione\\") and new bass player Franco Li Causi. == Discography Official discography=== * Guerra (1982, EP) * Luna/La preda (1983, 7\\") * Eneide di Krypton (1983, soundtrack) * Yassassin (1984, EP) * Desaparecido (1985) * Transea (1986, EP) * 17 Re (1986, double LP) * Live 12-5-87 (Aprite i vostri occhi) (1987, live) * Litfiba 3 (1988) * Pirata (1989, live) * El Diablo (1990) * Sogno Ribelle (1992, greatest hits + 1 unreleased song) * Terremoto (1993) * Colpo di coda (1994, live album + 2 unreleased songs) * Spirito (1994) * Urlo (1994) * Lacio Drom (1994, a box containing a VHS and a remix/live album) * Mondi Sommersi (1997) * Croce e delizia (1998, live) * Infinito (1999) * Elettromacumba (2000) * Live on Line (2000, live album) * Insidia (2001) * The Platinum Collection (2003, greatest hits) * Essere o sembrare (2005) * Stato libero di Litfiba (2010 live album + 2 unreleased songs) * Grande Nazione (2012) * Trilogia 1983-1989 live 2013 (2013 live album) * Eutòpia (2016) ==Line-upMembers=== * Federico \\"Ghigo\\" Renzulli: guitars (founder member; 1980-present) * Piero Pelù: vocals (1980–1999, 2009-present) * Federico Sagona: keyboards, backing vocals (2009-2012, 2015-present) * Luca Martelli: drums (2012-present) * Franco Li Causi: bass (2015-present) ===Past members=== * Gianni Maroccolo: bass (founder member; 1980–1989, 2013.2014) * Antonio Aiazzi: keyboards (1980–1995, 2003-2006, 2013-2014) * Sandro Dotta: guitars (founder member; 1980) * Francesco Calamai: drums (founder member; 1980–1983) * Francesco Magnelli: keyboards (1983-1989, 2010) * Renzo Franchi: drums (1983–1984) * Adriano Primadei: violin (1984) * Ringo De Palma: drums (1984–1989) * Daniele Trambusti: drums (1987, 1989–1992) * Roberto Terzani: bass (1989-1994), rhythm guitar (1995) and keyboards (1996-1999), bass (2006–2009) * Candelo Cabezas: percussions (1989–1991, 1994-1996) * Mauro Sabbione: keyboards (1990, 2000-2001) * Federico Poggipollini: rhythm guitar (1991–1993) * Franco Caforio: drums (1992-1999) * Daniele Bagni: bass (1994–1999, 2009-2012) * Gianluigi Cavallo: vocals (1999–2006) * Gianluca Venier: bass (1999-2006) * Ugo Nativi: drums (1999–2001) * Gianmarco Colzi: drums (2001-2006) * Filippo Margheri: vocals (2006–2009) * Pino Fidanza: drums (2008-2012) * Cosimo Zannelli: rhythm guitar (2012) ==External links== *Official band website *Official fan-club website *wiki.litfiba (the official biography written by the fans) Category:Italian musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1980 Category:Italian new wave musical groups ","title":"Litfiba"},{"id":"6195926","text":"The Constitution Party, or the Christian Nationalist Party or America First Party in some states, was a loosely organized conservative third party in the United States that was primarily active in Texas, founded in 1952 to support former General Douglas MacArthur for president and attempted to and drafted other prominent politicians for presidential elections. The party gave its support or presidential nominations to other right-wing presidential candidates or military figures until its dissolution sometime in the 1970s. ==History1952 presidential election=== The party held its founding convention in Chicago, Illinois during which Republican representatives Howard Buffett and Ralph W. Gwinn attempted to convince the attendees to rejoin the Republican party, but were unsuccessful. Both the chairman, Percy L. Greaves, and co-chairman, Suzanne Stevenson, resigned after anti-Semitic remarks by Upton Close. The party was anti-communist and Tyrone Lee Wertz, chairman of the Pennsylvania affiliate, criticized the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson II, for not having stances on communist infiltration. During the 1952 presidential election, they nominated Douglas MacArthur for president and Senator Harry F. Byrd for vice president, without permission from either candidate and Byrd later tried unsuccessfully to prevent his name from appearing on the Texas ballot. The party initially planned to only attempt to have electoral college electors vote for MacArthur and Byrd without any plans of seeking ballot access, but later decided to place them onto ballots and the ticket received 17,205 votes in the general election. In 1953, the party's affiliate in Ohio voted at a statewide meeting to ask MacArthur to become its chairman, but he declined the offer. ===1956 presidential election=== By 1956, the party had state affiliates in New York, Colorado, Pennsylvania, California, Texas, and Illinois. On August 28, 1956, the party gave its nomination to former Commissioner of Internal Revenue T. Coleman Andrews and former Representative Thomas H. Werdel who also appeared on ballots as States' Rights and Independent candidates and received 107,929 votes in the general election with 14,589 votes coming from the Constitution ballot line in Texas. On September 8, the Texas affiliate gave its gubernatorial nomination to Senator W. Lee O'Daniel, but he was not allowed onto the ballot as he had participated in the Democratic primary where he came in third place. However, he ran as a write-in candidate and received 110,234 votes in the general election. Later, during the 1958 elections, the Texas-based Constitution Party would run more candidates than the Republican Party of Texas. ===1960 presidential election=== On July 30, 1960, 125 Texas delegates voted at a meeting to ask for equal radio time during the debates between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. The delegates also criticized Senator Barry Goldwater for endorsing Nixon. On August 8, the Texas-based Constitution Party nominated Charles L. Sullivan for president and retired Marine Corps Brigadier General Merritt B. Curtis for vice president while another ticket composed of Merritt B. Curtis and Curtis B. Dall was ran in Washington.Diamond, Sara. Roads to Dominion: Right-Wing Movements and Political Power in the United States, p. 87. Sullivan and Curtis received 18,162 votes from Texas and Curtis and Miller received 1,401 votes in Washington. During the 1962 Texas gubernatorial election Jack Carswell was given the gubernatorial nomination and he participated in a debate against Jack Cox and John Connally. In the lieutenant gubernatorial election the party's nominee, Roy R. Brown, withdrew from the election and endorsed Bill Hayes, the Republican nominee. ===1964 presidential election=== In 1963, the party offered its presidential nomination to Senator Strom Thurmond, but he declined. During the 1964 presidential election members of the party left to support Senator Goldwater in the Republican presidential primary while those who stayed criticized him for being too flexible and not conservative enough. Governor George Wallace was offered the keynote address at the convention and the party's presidential nomination, but declined both offers. Joseph B. Lightburn, who had served as the chairman of the West Virginia affiliate in 1952 and served as mayor of Jane Lew, West Virginia for two terms, and Theodore Billings of Colorado were given the party's presidential and vice presidential nominations and received 5,061 votes. ===1968 presidential election=== In 1967, the Louisiana and Florida affiliates held rallies and petition drives in support of Wallace if he were to run for president. During the 1968 presidential election the party supported the American Independent Party's candidates Governor George Wallace and General Curtis LeMay, but in North Dakota Richard K. Troxell and Merle Thayer were given the presidential and vice presidential nominations and received 34 votes. George Wallace was on the ballot in fifty states receiving 9,901,118 votes for 13.53% of the popular vote and winning five states for 45 electoral votes along with one North Carolina \\"faithless elector\\". ==Platform== The party was staunchly anti-communist and supported Senator Joseph McCarthy's investigations as well Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 to prevent the entry of immigrants that were sympathetic to communism. It was isolationist with its support for the Bricker Amendment to limit American foreign involvement, ending all foreign aid, withdrawing from the United Nations, and its opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War. The party was in favor of racial segregation, supported repealing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and opposed the income tax. They criticized Eisenhower's administration as too left-wing and were opposed to the continuation of New Deal policies. ==References== Category:Political parties established in 1952 Category:Defunct political parties in the United States Category:Defunct conservative parties in the United States Category:1952 establishments in the United States ","title":"Constitution Party (United States, 1952)"},{"id":"6195929","text":"Shillinglee House Shillinglee is an 18th-century house and estate in West Sussex, England near the Surrey border, in between the villages of Chiddingfold and Plaistow.

It was built in the 18th century and was home to the Earl Winterton who hosted cricket matches within the extensive parkland of the estate. ==History== Built in 1735 and revised in the 1770s, Shillinglee was the home of the Earl Winterton and was originally a manor of the Arundel Estate, which belonged to the Norfolk Family. A landscaped park was laid out in the 1770s with fishponds and tree planting in the style of Capability Brown. The garden and parklands laid out by the 1770s have been changed significantly since. There is little documentary evidence for the design but it is known that in 1766 there were 26 gardeners. Records exist of 19th-century cricket matches played in the grounds, against neighbouring villages. Both Edward Turnour, 4th Earl Winterton and Edward Turnour, 5th Earl Winterton were first-class cricketers. Around the start of the 20th century, Shillinglee was the summer residence of the Indian Prince Ranjitsinhji, reckoned to be one of the greatest cricketers of all time.

In his 1719 expedition, French explorer Jean Baptiste Bénard de La Harpe encountered a Tawakoni village in present-day Muskogee County, Oklahoma. The French wrote that the Tawakoni raised maize and tobacco. La Harpe negotiated a peace treaty between the Tawakoni, eight other tribes, and the French government. Hostilities with the Osage pushed the tribe south into Texas.\\"Tawakoni Indian Tribe.\\" Access Genealogy. (retrieved 2 May 2010) In Texas, the Tawakoni were closely allied with the Waco tribe. Until 1770, they were friendly to the French but hostile to the Spanish. Chief Quiscat traveled to San Antonio in 1772 to try to make peace with the Spanish, but this did not have a lasting effect.Quiscat Handbook of Texas European-American settlers fought with the tribes in the 1820s, and disease and warfare had dramatically reduced their numbers. Stephen F. Austin's Republic of Texas drove the tribes out from central Texas. The Tawakoni helped convince the Comanche and the Wichita to sign a peace treaty with the United States government, which became the first treaty signed between Plains Indians and the US. In 1835, they signed a treaty with the United States at Camp Holmes. This was the first time they were included with the Wichita peoples, a practice that continued in subsequent treaties, signed in 1837 and 1846. 220px In 1853 an Indian reservation was established on the upper Brazos River in Texas, but settlers ultimately forced the tribes off the reservation. In August 1859, 258 Tawakoni people were forced to relocate to Indian Territory. With the Wichita, Waco, Caddo, Nadaco, Kichai, and Hainai tribes, the Tawakoni settled on a reservation in 1872 between the Canadian and Washita Rivers. Although these tribes resisted the allotment policy outlines in the Dawes Act, their reservation was broken into individual allotments, and \\"surplus\\" lands were opened to non-Native settlers on August 6, 1901. In 1894, 126 Tawakoni people were recorded.

He tries to determine what caused this sudden decision. The unmarried couple return to New Jersey to sort out their relationship. When Jeremy gets home, he hangs out with Gil and Biscuit, his old friends, who have made a hobby out of breaking into other people's homes and rearranging the objects to freak out the homeowners. Their activities have begun to unnerve one unfortunate homeowner in particular, Mr. Victim (Stuart Pankin). Jeremy, Gil and Biscuit go to their local bar for a few drinks and talk about women and Jeremy's aborted wedding. Meanwhile, Kerri and her best friend Marty go to a lesbian bar, when Marty tells her she is pregnant. The next morning Jeremy's friend from Vegas, Shane, comes to visit as Biscuit and Gil throw him another bachelor party. The bachelor party goes awry when the stripper Biscuit hired arrives, and is revealed to be a transvestite, who tells Jeremy that she saw Kerri at the lesbian bar the night before, and everyone thinks she is in a lesbian relationship with Marty. Gil and Biscuit take Jeremy and Shane to go mess with the house again, but Mr. Victim has become paranoid and shoots wildly at them, grazing Jeremy's ear. Faced with his own mortality, Jeremy, and the others drive to Kerri's so he can talk to her. She tells him that he took her for granted. Jeremy tells her that he would do anything to have her back, just as Gil walks in, telling them that Marty is beating up Biscuit on the front lawn. Biscuit, thinking Marty and Kerri were gay, asked Marty if he could be their manager. During the fight, the men learn that Marty is pregnant, and that Gil is the father. Kerri and Jeremy give Gil and Marty their plane tickets that were for their honeymoon in Florida so the new couple can have some alone time, while Kerri and Jeremy hold hands, hinting toward a possible reconciliation. ==Cast== *Jeremy Sisto as Jeremy *Rashida Jones as Kerri *Jeff Anderson as Gil *Trevor Fehrman as Biscuit * Todd Babcock as Shane * Earl Boen as Grandpa *Heather Paige Kent as Marty * David Bosnak as Security Jimmy * Paget Brewster as Lea * Bijoux Deluxe as K.C. * Anthony John Denison as Gary Richards * Debbe Dunning as Sun Goddess * Louis Herthum as Bar Patron * Brendan Hill as Cliff * Edie McClurg as Pat * Stuart Pankin as Mr. Victim * Jake Richardson as Teddy * Will Rothhaar as Eddy * Liz Sheridan as Grandma ==Recognition== * 2002 San Diego Film Festival - Best Feature Film - Nominated * 2002 IFP Chicago Film Festival - Official Selection * 2002 Greenwich Film Festival - Official Selection * 2002 Big Bear International Festival - Official Selection ==Home media== The film was released on DVD on November 28, 2006.

Both his parents were performers and it did not take long before the young Rastelli decided to join the family business. He received rigorous training in a variety of circus disciplines including acrobatics, balancing and aerial skills. His performance debut was at the age of 13 as part of his parents' aerial act, however his passion and talent lay with juggling. He practiced his juggling skills tirelessly and by the age of 19 was performing a solo juggling routine. His earliest performances involved the manipulation of sticks and balls in a typical Japanese style; he even wore a Kimono as his costume. Many jugglers of Rastelli's day were of the gentleman juggler style. Dressed in formal evening attire, they would juggle everyday objects that you might find at the dinner table, including plates, hat and cane, loaves of bread, bottles and even chairs. Rastelli instead chose to restrict himself to objects more suited to throwing and catching, typically plates, sticks and balls. In doing so, he was able to achieve levels of technical skill far beyond that of his contemporaries. Furthermore, his choice of three simple props is reflected in the props of choice of most modern jugglers, with balls, clubs (replacing sticks) and rings (replacing plates) being used by professional and amateur jugglers alike. In 1917 Rastelli married Harriet, a highwire artist. By the early 1920s he was becoming quite a star, touring Europe and America, amazing audiences and commanding an ever-increasing salary. In this period he chose to perform in a silk costume adding static balance tricks to his energetic performances. During the later part of the 1920s he made the move from the circus ring to the more lucrative vaudeville theatres. His style changed again, performing in full soccer strip he would juggle up to five footballs. With his growing fortune, Rastelli, his wife and their three children purchased a large villa in Bergamo. While touring Europe in 1931 Rastelli's gums suddenly started bleeding and shortly afterwards he contracted pneumonia. He quickly returned home, however his condition worsened and he died in the early hours of the morning, 13 December 1931, as a result of anemia. His funeral took place in Bergamo, attended by thousands. A life- sized statue to Rastelli was erected within his tomb, depicting him in a familiar pose, spinning a ball on his raised finger. Vanity Fair magazine, in its February, 1932 issue, (page 49), ran a full-page photograph of Rastelli with the following caption: Rastelli 1930 in Berlin Rastelli's contribution to juggling is of great significance. His skill in being able to juggle multiple objects, sometimes while balancing objects on his head or body and his world record number juggling remained unparalleled until recently. He was also a master of 'combination' style tricks, being able to juggle 6 plates, while spinning a hoop around one foot and skipping a rope which was spun by an assistant. His influence is still felt today, with most jugglers restricting themselves to the use of clubs, rings and balls. ==See also== *List of jugglers ==Sources== * * * ==External links== *Videos of Rastelli Rastelli, Enrico Rastelli, Enrico Rastelli, Enrico Rastelli Category:Deaths from anemia Category:People from Samara, Russia ","title":"Enrico Rastelli"},{"id":"6195979","text":"Kondapalli toys at a house in Vijayawada Forecourt of the fort Kondapalli is a town near Vijayawada in Krishna district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. == Etymology == In 18th century, Kondapalli was known with the name, Mustafanagar. == Culture == The village is known for Kondapalli Toys (Kondapalli bommalu).

It is a variation of the Oggy Oggy Oggy chant used by both association football and rugby union fans in Great Britain from the 1960s onwards. It is usually performed by a crowd uniting to support a sports team or athlete. The alternate is for an individual to chant the line \\"Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!\\" and the crowd to respond with \\"Oi! Oi! Oi!\\". A variation of this is for an individual to chant, \\"Aussie!\\", with the crowd responding, \\"Oi!\\", along the lines of, \\"Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!\\", \\"Oi, Oi, Oi!\\"' \\"Aussie!\\", \\"Oi!\\", \\"Aussie\\", Oi!\\", \\"Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!\\", \\"Oi, Oi, Oi!\\". ==Definition== The full version of the chant, as heard prior to a free outdoor concert at the time of the Sydney 2000 Olympics and quoted by Luba Vangelova of CNNSI, is as follows: :Individual: \\"Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!\\" ::Crowd: \\"Oi!

The chant came to be commonly heard at international sporting events where an Australian team was competing. ==Origins and explanation== A chant of similar form, \\"Oggy Oggy Oggy\\", has been used for decades by football crowds in Britain. Members of the British Royal Navy claim to have used the Oggy Oggy Oggy chant, or a version of it, since the Second World War.\\"Oggie Song\\" Wednesday, January 18, 2012 Retrieved: July 14, 2014 Englishman Ron Knox claims to have used the \\"Oggy\\" chant while playing for the Box Hill Rugby Club in Melbourne in the late 1960s. Various conflicting stories of how it was introduced from Britain to Australia can be found.Aussie 'Oggie, Oi' chant introduced by Englishman – Ananova According to Stephen Alomes, a professor of Australian studies at Deakin University, the chant represents \\"enthusiasm for the tribe\\" and a \\"celebration of 'us' \\", but at the extreme may act as a symbol of aggressive nationalism and xenophobia. In 2012, after Foxtel offered a $10,000 prize in a competition for coming up with a new phrase to cheer on athletes, Germaine Greer argued: \\"The cry is catchy. Any crowd can pick it up and it cuts through the surrounding white noise like a military tattoo. It is as jingoistic to reject it because it was originally British as it would be to prize it for the same reason ... There will be no silencing Australian fans at the Olympics and they won't be bullied by Foxtel, either.\\" ==Commercial and publicity uses== Members of a Royal Australian Air Force air traffic control detachment in Iraq with the slogan on a celebratory banner in 2004 At the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, the IOC President, Juan Antonio Samaranch reflected the spirit of the whole affair when, during his formal speech, he said, \\"What can I say? Maybe, with my Spanish accent, Aussie! Aussie! Aussie!\\". The response to these words came from all around the stadium, \\"Oi! Oi! Oi!\\". In 2004, a Melbourne couple, inspired by a Dick Smith campaign supporting Australian-made products, and following publicity surrounding the ownership of the trademark for the Australian-developed Ugg boots being owned by a United States company, registered the phrase as an official trademark in an effort to protect it from overseas exploitation. At the conclusion of winning the main event of the 2005 World Series of Poker, Australian supporters of winner Joe Hachem chanted this victoriously during the primetime viewing of the poker event on ESPN. At the conclusion of the Prize giving ceremony for the 2008 Super 14 final at AMI Stadium in Christchurch, New Zealand, the winning team, the Crusaders, chanted \\"Robbie Robbie Robbie Oi Oi Oi\\" to farewell their Coach Robbie Deans, who was leaving to coach the Australian national team, the Wallabies. In a promotional video for the American professional wrestling company WWE, Australian wrestler Emma chanted the song in support of the Australia national soccer team during the 2014 FIFA World Cup. It is also a popular chant during Australian Cricket Team's matches. The chant is also a fixture at men's basketball games at Saint Mary's College of California, a school that has regularly featured Australian players in the 21st century. It is chanted by the Australian band Chase Atlantic on backstage before their concerts. ==See also== * Oggy Oggy Oggy * Aussie * 2000 Summer Olympics * Oi! == References == Category:Chants Category:Football songs and chants Category:Australian nationalism Category:Sport in Australia Category:Sports culture in Australia ","title":"Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi"},{"id":"6195991","text":"Leonard Żłób was a Corporal of the Polish Army and a commander of a Bofors wz. 37 AT gun of the 2nd Mounted Artillery Battalion attached to the Wołyńska Cavalry Brigade.

Ascii's AeroGauge is conceptually similar to Psygnosis' Wipeout or Acclaim's Extreme G. The main difference is that the vehicles in the game fly instead of hovering, so it's possible to maneuver them in the air. ==Overview== Aerogauge takes place in Asia during the year 2065. The game has four tracks and five vehicles from the start, with additional tracks and vehicles that can be unlocked via the Grandprix and Time Attack modes. The game includes vehicle damage, which is shown with a meter on the bottom of the player's HUD. As the player gains damage, their vehicle will begin to spark and smoke. If a player acquires too much damage, their vehicle will stop, slowly land to the ground and the screen will fade black with the text \\"Retire\\". To prevent this, players can repair damage by flying through the tracks' shield regenerating areas at low altitude. Each track features their own twists and turns including upside down or vertical racing with obstacles blocking the players path. ==Game Modes== The game has four different game modes which the player can choose from on the main menu. ===Grandprix=== Grandprix is a single-player game mode. It has a basic championship league, having the player race against computer-controlled vehicles on every map in the game. Before each race, the player is required to take two qualifying laps which in turn determines starting position for the race based on the player's best time and how it compares to the computer's. The actual race is three laps around the course, against seven opponents all of which blast off from the starting line rapidly, usually leaving the player behind to catch up. After a race, the player is rewarded points depending on their finishing position; better placement gives more points. Points from each race in the Grandprix are totaled to determine the winner. ===Singlematch=== Singlematch is also a single player mode. It is one race against computer A.I. on a track chosen by the player. Like the Grandprix, it requires two qualifying laps to determine starting position. ===VS=== VS mode is a two-player game mode, where two human players choose a track and race on it. There are no qualifying laps and no computer opponents. ===Time Attack=== Time Attack mode is another single player game mode. It is a time trial on a track chosen by the player. The player can choose to do either three or an infinite number of laps. If the player selects to do three laps, ghosts can be saved on a memory card and loaded to race. ==AeroMachines== In the game universe, an AeroMachine is a vehicle with the ability to produce a strong field of localized magnetic flux. The AeroMachines are the vehicles used in the Sky Step. There are 10 available AeroMachines, with 5 being available from the start and 5 being unlockable. Each of the AeroMachines is rated based on six categories displayed in a radar chart. The categories are speed (maximum air speed), steering (turning capability), accele (acceleration), aero limit (speed needed to get airborne), shield (endurance), and stability (gripping power). ==Tracks== There are 6 tracks in the game, with 4 available from the start and 2 being unlockable by the player during the game. ==Reception== Next Generation reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"In the end, Aero Gauge may not stand up to the speed, multiplayer action, and track diversity of the upcoming F-Zero X (or for that matter, Extreme-G), but considering that it beats Nintendo's cyber-racer to the punch by more than six months, this should help tide over racing fans nicely.\\" The game received a \\"4.5 Poor\\" rating from GameSpot and an \\"5.2 Mediocre\\" from IGN. The GameSpot reviewer stated that \\"AeroGauge is really nothing spectacular as it displays some of the worst pop-up seen in a racer in a long time.\\" ==References * Category:1997 video games Category:Futuristic racing games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Nintendo 64-only games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games set in the 2060s ","title":"AeroGauge"},{"id":"6196051","text":"Barry John Conlon (born 1 October 1978) is an Irish former professional footballer who played as a striker from 1996 to 2013. Conlon's career started with Queens Park Rangers but he moved to Manchester City before he had played a game. He made his Football League debut with City. He subsequently went on to play for Southend United, York City, Darlington on two separate occasions, Barnsley, Mansfield Town, Bradford City, Grimsby Town, Chesterfield, Stockport County, R.O.C. de Charleroi-Marchienne and Dundalk. He has also had a number of other loan spells with other Football League sides and has represented his country at under-21 level in seven games. ==Early life== Conlon was the youngest of six sons to Noel and Kitty. Born in Drogheda, County Louth, Conlon grew up in Carrickmacross, County Monaghan where he played football with local team Carrickmacross Rovers from the age of eight to 14. He also represented the North Eastern Counties Schoolboys League at the Kennedy Cup in Limerick. During the tournament Conlon impressed scouts from top schoolboy club Stella Maris and signed for the Dublin outfit in time for the prestigious Milk Cup held in Coleraine that summer. He remained in Dublin for one season before returning to the north-east to sign for Dundalk. At the end of his first season at Oriel Park, Conlon re-signed for Carrick Rovers before attracting the interest of English clubs. ==CareerQueens Park Rangers=== He started his professional career with Queens Park Rangers (QPR), signing his first contract on 1 August 1996. This was a couple of months after Rangers had lost their FA Premier League status. Conlon was added to the Loftus Road squad for their first season back in the First Division. However, after his first year at QPR he was released. He failed to make an appearance for the club's first team. ===Manchester City=== Conlon was signed by Manchester City, who had suffered relegation with QPR in 1996. Shortly after signing Conlon played for the Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team in the 1997 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship finals in Iceland. He scored and got sent off against Switzerland.https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/archive/1997/0728/Pg024.html He made his debut for the club on 27 September 1997, replacing Georgi Kinkladze as a late substitute against Swindon Town, but appearances were limited to just one league start and seven substitute appearances. Subsequently, he was loaned out 18 months later to Plymouth Argyle, spending the next six months at the club, scoring two goals in 13 games. He was released by City at the end of his contract. ===Southend United and York City=== His next port of call was to sign for Southend United a month into the 1998–99 season. Conlon made over 30 appearances for the club, scoring seven goalsin all competitions, but Conlon left no more than 10 months after joining the Roots Hall club. York City signed Conlon for a fee of £100,000, and he went on to play a pivotal role in the City side during the 1999–2000 season. In November 2000, he fell out of favour at Bootham Crescent, thus allowing him to join Colchester United on loan, but after playing the 2000–01 season for United, the club decided to not give him a permanent deal. ===Darlington=== York cashed in on Conlon and sold him to rivals Darlington at the start of the 2001–02 season, for a reported five-figure fee. Conlon's first season at the club was not as successful as he hoped, but in his three seasons at Feethams, he was loved by some fans who heralded him as a hero, after playing a huge part in keeping Darlo in the Football League. In his last season at the club, he managed to net 14 goals, leading to interest from high league clubs. ===Barnsley and return to Darlington=== Following the end of his contract at Darlington, Conlon was free to leave, thus allowing him to sign with Barnsley. Conlon struggled to find the net at Barnsley, and eventually lost his place in the side to players such as Rory Fallon and Michael Boulding. He was loaned to Rotherham United towards the end of the 2005–06 season. He left Barnsley at the end of that season, he made just under 40 appearances for the club in the two seasons, scoring seven times. Conlon made a surprise return to Darlington at the start of 2006–07. On his return to Darlington, he scored a hat-trick on his debut, but later lost his place in the team following Dave Penney's appointment as manager. In January 2007 he left the club for a second time. ===Mansfield Town=== Conlon was allowed to sign for Mansfield Town on a free transfer along with Lincoln City striker Martin Gritton. He played 17 games for the club, scoring six times, but was released by the club four months later. ===Bradford City=== Conlon joined newly relegated League Two side Bradford City on a one-year contract, becoming new manager Stuart McCall's first signing, along with fellow striker Peter Thorne. His debut came on the first day of the 2007–08 season against Macclesfield Town when he saw a penalty kick saved and the rebound scored by Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu to secure a 1–1 draw. He scored his first goal for the club in his 10th game, converting a last minute penalty at Milton Keynes Dons on 6 October 2007 in a 2–1 defeat. After missing a number of chances in a game against Brentford later in October, he came in for criticism from the fans and was dropped from the Bradford starting side for more than a month. However, he turned down two loan moves away from Bradford and scored his first goal from open play to seal a late 2–1 victory over Lincoln City on Boxing Day 2007. Conlon scored two more penalties before being relieved of penalty duties after missing a vital kick in a 2–0 defeat to Dagenham & Redbridge on 1 March 2008. Later that month he scored in successive games for the first time for City including one against former side Mansfield. He ended the month with another goal against a former side, this time Darlington, in a 3–1 win at the Darlington Arena. Conlon earned a new six-month contract, which he signed at the end of the season keeping him at Bradford City until January 2009. He was largely used as a substitute at the start of the 2008–09 season, but scored his first goal of the campaign during a start against Leeds United in the Football League Trophy, as Bradford lost 2–1. His first league goal of the season came just minutes after coming on as a substitute against Luton Town, to help Bradford gain a point with ten men. Having scored two more goals, Conlon was rewarded with a rare start against Barnet, when he scored two goals but City could only draw 3–3. Conlon scored his 100th league goal from the penalty spot on 25 November 2008, grabbing the winning goal in a 3–2 win for Bradford City at Valley Parade against Chesterfield. He marked the occasion by removing his shirt, revealing a vest with '100' emblazoned across the front, for which he was shown a yellow card. Conlon extended his stay at Bradford for another six months when he signed another new short-term contract in December 2008. In March 2009, Conlon and defender Matthew Clarke were both dropped for a game with Exeter City and punished following a breach of club discipline. Manager Stuart McCall said: \\"It's an internal matter and has been dealt with in the dressing room.\\" Conlon was recalled to the side but made one only more appearance before he was sent on loan. ===Grimsby Town=== Conlon signed for fellow League Two club Grimsby Town on loan for the rest of the 2008–09 season. He joined the club on the transfer deadline day along with Peter Sweeney and Jonathan Lund. He scored the final goal of a 3–0 win against Gillingham on his debut to help lift Grimsby out of the League Two relegation zone. He scored a penalty in his second game to give Grimsby a 1–0 victory against Aldershot Town and lift them three points clear of the relegation zone. Conlon proved to be an integral part of the Grimsby team that avoided relegation from The Football League. Having partnered forwards Jean-Louis Akpa Akpro and Adam Proudlock up front, Conlon scored five times in eight appearances to help seal Grimsby's league status. Following the conclusion of the 2008–09 campaign, he was released by Bradford, and shortly afterwards he signed for Grimsby permanently on a two-year contract. Conlon's season began on a plus point, scoring on the opening day game with Cheltenham Town, but he soon lost his place in the first team due to two red cards in three games which left him suspended for seven matches, in which his team seemingly struggled too find an adequate replacement who could find the back of the net. Following the dismissal of manager Mike Newell, Conlon found himself out of favour with new manager Neil Woods often using him as a substitute. He was also relegated to the reserves, and spent one night in a police station cell because of driving offences only hours before a reserve fixture with Scunthorpe United. On 13 January 2010, Woods told Conlon, along with Danny Boshell, Matthew Heywood and Jamie Clarke that they are free to leave the club in the January transfer window. On 1 March 2010, over a month since Conlon's Grimsby departure, the club held a fans forum giving a chance for the supporters to voice recent club concerns with chairman John Fenty and manager Neil Woods. Conlon's release to Chesterfield had been slightly criticised by some supporters because of the fact he was the Grimsby's current seasonal top goalscorer, and was seemingly the only proven goal scorer in the ranks at Blundell Park. Fenty was asked by a supporter during the forum why Conlon was allowed to leave. Fenty answered that Conlon had become a disruptive influence, having also failed to turn up for training, and with that had not answered phone calls from the club.http://www.grimsby- townfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10417~1981342,00.html Conlon later admitted that after an enjoyable loan spell with Grimsby his \\"heart wasn't in it\\" when he signed permanently for the club and that his commuting from his Leeds home had left him exhausted. He also claimed that new manager Neil Woods was \\"clueless\\" ===Chesterfield=== By the end of the week, he signed for fellow League Two side Chesterfield initially on loan. Conlon scored on his Chesterfield debut to give them a 1–0 victory against Torquay United and lift his new side into the promotion play-off spots. On 23 January 2010, it was announced that prior to his move to Saltergate, Conlon was offered to Accrington Stanley as part of a six-figure deal to lure striker Michael Symes to Blundell Park. Stanley rejected the bid, meaning Conlon's move to Chesterfield went through. On 1 February 2010, Conlon signed for Chesterfield on a permanent deal after Grimsby agreed to cancel his two-year contract by mutual consent.http://www.chesterfield- fc.co.uk/page/ClubAnnouncements/0,,10435~1952004,00.html Conlon, during his time at Saltergate, chipped in with six goals including a number of penalties. As a result of failing to qualify for the League Two play-offs, Chesterfield manager John Sheridan released Conlon, along with 11 other players, on 12 March 2010. ===Stockport County=== Conlon signed for League Two team Stockport County on 15 July 2010 following a trial. In November 2010, police saw Conlon speeding in his Mercedes. He was stopped and gave a positive drink-drive sample. The following month he was given a three-and-a-half-year driving ban after admitting drink-driving; he was also fined £1,175. Consequently, he was released by the club after having his contract cancelled by mutual consent on 21 December. ===ROC de Charleroi-Marchienne=== On 14 March 2011 Conlon signed for Belgian Third Division B side R.O.C. de Charleroi-Marchienne. He left the club at the end of the 2010–11 season, and briefly joined Monaghan United on trial, but failed to earn a contract. ===Dundalk and Carrick Rovers=== In July 2012 he interested Dundalk, with the club hoping to sign him along with several other players, but soon after the deal was described as \\"dead in the water\\". On 30 August 2012 he was on the verge of signing for the club, and joined on non-contract terms making his debut in a practice friendly match. He signed until the end of the 2012 League of Ireland season in September '.http://www.extratime.ie/newsdesk/articles/8865/conlon-signs-for-dundalk/ He made his League of Ireland debut on 7 September in Oriel Park and scored his only goal against Bray in October. At the end of the 2012 season, Conlon was one of many Dundalk players who weren't retained. In March 2013 Conlon returned to Carrick Rovers, scoring in his debut against Woodview Celtic. ==Career statistics== { class= style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! colspan=2Club Performance ! colspan=2League ! colspan=2FA Cup ! colspan=2League Cup ! colspan=2Total - !

Rovira was born in Posadas and studied chemical engineering at the National University of Misiones, later earning a postgraduate degree in chemical engineering at the University of Buenos Aires. After a period in academic research, he became an environmental consultant, focusing especially on water quality. He joined the provincial government in 1992, heading the transport department until 1995. In 1995, Rovira was elected Mayor of Posadas. In 1999 he was elected for a first term as Governor of Misiones. Ahead of the 2003 elections he formed the Front for Renewal, bringing together Peronists and dissident Radicals to support his bid for re- election. He was re-elected in 2003. The Front for Renewal supports the national Front for Victory faction of President Néstor Kirchner. Rovira attempted to alter the constitution of Misiones to allow his continued re- election ahead of the 2007 elections. The formation of a constitutional assembly was voted on 29 October 2006. The Rovira administration inaugurated an unusual number of public works in the month prior to the election and was alleged to have engaged in coarse proselytism, including the distribution of welfare food baskets with voting ballots inside. The opposition also alleged that thousands of Paraguayan citizens were being paid to cross the border and vote for Rovira, using forged Argentine national IDs.ClarínLa Nación Rovira's party lost the referendum to the United Front for Dignity, a broad opposition coalition led by Bishop Emeritus of Puerto Iguazú, Monsignor Joaquín Piña, by a 13% margin that surprised analysts.Mercopress However, in the subsequent election for governor, Rovira was succeeded by his party's candidate, Maurice Closs. ==References * Official website * Misiones Province Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:People from Posadas, Misiones Category:University of Buenos Aires alumni Category:Argentine engineers Category:Mayors of places in Argentina Category:Governors of Misiones Province Category:Justicialist Party politicians Category:Chemical engineers ","title":"Carlos Rovira"},{"id":"6196078","text":"In probability theory, a Cox process, also known as a doubly stochastic Poisson process is a point process which is a generalization of a Poisson process where the intensity that varies across the underlying mathematical space (often space or time) is itself a stochastic process.

It examines the relation between law and development and analyzes how to use law as an instrument to promote economic and social development. In the 1960s, some American organizations such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Ford Foundation sponsored the law reform in developing countries. Legal scholars from leading American law schools wrote many articles discussing the contribution of law reform to economic development. This was called the law and development movement. However, after only one decade, both key involved scholars and former Ford Foundation officials declared this movement failed.Trubek & Galanter (1974) The presumably failed law and development revived in the 1980s, with the proliferation of law reform projects based on neoliberal ideals. These projects supported liberal reforms such as privatization and trade liberalization, with the emphasis on the rule of law. Substantial investments were made on these projects by international development agencies such as the World Bank, USAID, and other public agencies and private foundations, but these law reform projects were criticized for being ineffective or causing adverse impacts on development in many places in the world. The cause of the failure in the first and second law and development movements is that the law reform projects were developed and implemented without sufficient understanding of the mechanism by which LFIs impact economic and social development, which is affected by various socio-economic factors on the ground. Lee (2015) The Law and Development Institute was set up in 2009 to promote studies in law and development and develop a comprehensive analytical model for law and development, and the Law and Development Review was launched in 2008 as the only peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to law and development. ==NotesReferences== * David Trubek & Mark Galanter, “Scholars in Self-Estrangement: Some Reflections on the Crisis in Law and Development Studies in the United States” (1974) 4 Wisc.

Telekom Srbija was established in 1997 by restructuring of PTT sistema Srbije public enterprise, as a single-member joint-stock company. The company sold 49% of its share capital the same year for 1.568 billion Deutsche marks. The ownership structure at the time consisted of PTT Traffic Serbia (51%), Telecom Italia (29%) and OTE (20%). ===2003–2015=== In 2003, PTT held an 80% share after repurchasing Telecom Italia's stake in the company.

Month later, Kopernikus' former owner used much of that money for the purchase of B92 and Prva Srpska Televizija, two television networks with national coverage. On 6 January 2019, Telekom Srbija acquired domestic cable operators Radijus Vektor and \\"AVcom\\", in a transaction worth 120 million euros.

Retrieved from YNet.com website, October 2010. Rosenfeld, a Jew born in Lemberg, the Austro-Hungarian Empire (today Lviv, Ukraine), was raised in Wöllersdorf near Wiener Neustadt. He graduated in medicine with a specialization in urology from Vienna University. He worked as a urologist with his own private clinic in Vienna and was a member of Social Democratic Party of Austria. The party was banned in the coup of 1933. After the Anschluss, Rosenfeld was deported to Dachau concentration camp and was there for a year. and later to Buchenwald. In 1939, he was released and returned to Vienna. He and his brother immediately requested visas from the Chinese legation and travelled to Shanghai. Once in Shanghai he opened a successful practice in urology, gynecology and obstetrics. From 1941 he served the Chinese Communist force as a field doctor for the New Fourth Army, the Eighth Route Army and the Northeast People's Liberation Army during the outbreak of Second Sino-Japanese war and Chinese civil war. Due to the severe shortage of doctors he founded the Huazhong Medical School, which trained the medical teams for the New Fourth Army. He chose to remain in China after the fall of the Nazi regime and participated in the People's Liberation Army's march on Beijing before returning in November 1949 to Europe to search for relatives, most of whom had perished in the Holocaust. He reunited with his sister in Austria in 1949. In 1950, after unsuccessfully attempting to return to China, he emigrated to Israel and was reunited with his younger brother Joseph. He died two years later after suffering heart failure. China has erected a statue in his honour, a hospital called Rosenfield Hospital in Junan County , Shandong was named after him. Shandong is the area he worked as a field doctor. In Junan County there is also an exhibition hall called the Deeds of International Fighter Rosenfeld.

Today most of the Baronnies is part of the département Drôme (a part of the région Rhône-Alpes). Smaller areas in the East and South belong to the départements of Vaucluse, Hautes-Alpes and Alpes-de-Haute-Provence (part of the région Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur). The area of roughly is sparsely populated; the 1999 census counted only 22,000 inhabitants. Since the 17th century les Baronnies, especially its eastern parts, suffered from land flight due to harsh economic conditions. Starting in the 1980s land flight has stopped and the population is now increasing especially in and around the towns of Nyons, Buis-les-Baronnies, Mirabel-aux-Baronnies, Faucon and Puymeras. There are plans to create the Parc Naturel Régional des Baronnies. The area is paradise for hiking, mountaineering, rock climbing, cycling, mountain biking, horse-riding, hang gliding and paragliding. ==History== Legend has it that Hannibal, the Carthaginian leader crossed les Baronnies with his elephants during the Second Punic War (218 - 201 B.C.). Later the area retired Roman soldiers were given land here. After the Roman Empire collapsed in the 3rd century, hundreds of years of invasions by Franks, Lombards, Saracens and marauding bands followed. During this period local fiefs started to fortify villages and consolidate power. In the 11th century the area was part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the Barons of Mévouillon consolidated their power over a large part of les Baronnies, they ruled for roughly 300 years from capital in Buis-les-Baronnies. As a result of a family feud in 1125, the western part of les Baronnies was ruled by a different line of Mévouillons. They called themselves Barons de Montauban, hence the name \\"les Baronnies\\" (plural). They established their capital in Nyons. Within a short period of time both had to sell their possessions to the Count of Vienne, nicknamed le Dauphin (the dolphin was his coat of arms), who ceded his territory to the King of France in 1349 to pay his debts. Similar to the Luberon, the Baronnies was a stronghold of Protestantism in the Provence. It suffered heavily during the French Wars of Religion (1562-1598). Two of the most notable military leaders came from the Baronnies: Charles Dupuy-Montbrun, the Protestant leader from Montbrun-les-Bains and Faulque Thollon de Sainte Jalle, the Catholic leader from Sainte-Jalle. After a short lived economic revival the pest struck in 1629 and then again in 1652. The population was decimated. The period from the 18th century to modern day was marked by economic decline and land flight. Only in the 1980s were the Baronnies \\"discovered\\". Tourism started to develop and the area between Vaison-la- Romaine and Nyons started to become very popular with tourists and retirees. ==Towns and Villages== The Baronnies has two historic towns, Nyons and Buis- les-Baronnies. There are many rustic ancient villages, most notable are Brantes, Faucon, Mirabel-aux-Baronnies, Mollans-sur-Ouvèze, Montbrun-les- Bains, La Motte-Chalancon, Orpierre, Puymeras, Rémuzat, Rousset-les-Vignes, Sainte-Jalle, Séderon and Venterol. Also notable is the castle of Aulan near Montbrun-les-Bains. Main economic activity is agriculture and tourism. Nyons is the center of the local olive tree cultivation with numerous oil mills, an olive oil cooperative and an olive tree/olive oil museum. The olives grown in Nyons and les Baronnies have an AOC (Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée) quality label. Tourism has expanded, especially in the western parts of the Baronnies. It is important that the plan to create the Parc Naturel Régional des Baronnies is approved soon. It is however strongly opposed by many landowners and the real estate developers behind them. ==References * les Baronnies Official Tourism Site * Village of Mirabel-aux-Baronnies www.mirabelauxbaronnies.fr Category:Geography of France Baronnies Baronnies Baronnies Baronnies ","title":"Baronnies"},{"id":"6196206","text":"Nightfall is a Greek extreme metal band from Athens. Formed by vocalist/bassist Efthimis Karadimas in 1991, the group is currently signed to Metal Blade Records. They are widely considered the forerunners to a \\"mediterranean way to black metal\\" together with Inchiuvatu and Moonspell. ==History== Nightfall was formed in 1991 by frontman and bassist Efthimis Karadimas. Within a few months of existence, Karadimas had produced Nightfall's one-and-only demo tape, Vanity. The 4 track demo was noticed by Holy Records, a new French record label that was looking for an act to use to help introduce itself to the music business worldwide. A deal followed and gave birth to the debut release of Nightfall and Holy Records, Parade into Centuries, in 1992. The release proved a successful pioneering step as time went on for both Nightfall and Holy Records. This paradigm was followed by many in both countries, establishing a tradition for French labels to release Greek metal albums. Nightfall stayed with Holy Records throughout the decade, resulting in 1994's Macabre Sunsets, 1995's Athenian Echoes, 1997's Lesbian Show, and 1999's Diva Futura, backed by European tours. Line-up changes were effected in almost every release, with Karadimas remaining the only constant. The early days saw Chris Adamou on rhythm guitars and Costas Savvidis on drums, while later Jim Agelopoulos and Phil Anton would take the guitar spot; Bob Katsionis would join on keys for their summer of 2001 Wacken appearance, with Mark Cross on drums, and Mike Galiatsos coming in on lead guitars. Katsionis would later handle guitar duties as well, and both himself and Cross would later go on to perform with Greek power metal outfit Firewind (the main band of guitarist Gus G, who became Ozzy Osbourne’s guitarist in 2010). The next few years saw the band changing direction and a new record deal was signed with Greek label Black Lotus Records with whom Nightfall released two albums: 2003’s I Am Jesus and 2005’s Lyssa: Rural Gods and Astonishing Punishments. George Bokos appeared as a guitarist on Lyssa. In 2005 the band ceased its live performances for good and George Bokos joined fellow Greeks Rotting Christ. The same year drummer George Kollias, who had replaced Cross some years prior and appeared on both albums, ended up in the American death metal band Nile. The band had apparently split up (although no official announcement was ever made about it), yet in early 2009 Stathis Kassios (known to Efthimis Karadimas from his on stage keyboard services in the previous years) introduced American guitarist Evan Hensley to Karadimas in an effort to convince him to record some new compositions together. German drummer and producer Jörg Uken was already in touch with Efthimis Karadimas, and words became actions in early 2010 when this new line-up was announced. This new line-up and the new sound it delivered attracted American label Metal Blade Records, who offered a record deal. Their 2010 release, Astron Black and the Thirty Tyrants, was released on Metal Blade Records in August, 2010. The album was almost universally well-received, garnering high praise from numerous international critics, and included artwork by noted American cover artist Travis Smith. In 2011, the band added two new members to further round out their line-up: guitarist Constantine and bassist Stathis Ridis. After the release of their 2013 album, Cassiopeia, Nightfall went on hiatus. In June 2020, the band announced their return to live performances through their official Facebook page. The band's current line up, apart from Efthimis Karadimas on vocals and bass, includes returning members Mike Galiatsos and Kostas Kyriakopoulos on guitars, as well as Fotis Bernardo of Septicflesh fame on drums. In July 2020, Nightfall announced a record deal with french label Season of Mist, as well as that they are working on a new album that will be released in early 2021. In addition, Season of Mist has announced that it has acquired distribution rights for the band's entire release catalog. ==Members== ;Current members * Efthimis Karadimas - vocals (1991–present), bass (1991-1999, 2002-2005, 2020-present), Keyboards (1991-1992, 1999-2005) * Mike Galiatsos -

The monument is located at the Sibelius Park (; ) in the district of Töölö in Helsinki, the capital city of Finland. ==Description== The monument is a sculpture by Finnish artist Eila Hiltunen titled Passio Musicae and was unveiled on September 7, 1967. The sculpture won a competition, organised by the Sibelius Society, following the composer's death in 1957. The competition took two rounds after one early winner was abandoned. Originally it sparked a lively debate about the merits and flaws of abstract art and although the design looked like stylised organ pipes it was known that the composer had created little music for organs. Hiltunen addressed her critics by adding the face of Sibelius which sits beside the main sculpture. It consists of series of more than 600 hollow steel pipes welded together in a wave-like pattern. The monument weighs and measures . Hiltunen's aim was to capture the essence of the music of Sibelius. A smaller version of the monument, \\"Homage to Sibelius\\", is located at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris. A work with a similar concept, also designed by Hiltunen, is located at the grounds of the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City. ==Sibelius Park and Kalevala Monument== In 1939, the Leo and Regina Wainstein Foundation organised a competition for sculptors to design a work that depicted a scene from Finland's national epic, The Kalevala, which would be erected in the park.

In April 1921 it reformed at Helwan, Egypt. Assigned Vickers Vernon bomber- transports, the unit provided troop transportation and ground support and mail services throughout the Middle East, notably in support of anti-rebel operations in Iraq and the Palestine. The unit transitioned to DH9As in 1927,to Fairey IIIs in 1929 and to Fairey Gordons in 1935. At some point the unit adopted the nickname \\"The Flying Camels\\". The Squadron Badge is a winged camel, approved by King Edward VIII in October 1936. The badge and nickname derive from the Sopwith used by the unit in World War I and its long service in the Middle East. ===Second World War=== At the start of World War II, 45 Squadron converted to Bristol Blenheims. From mid-1940 it took part in the North African Campaign and on 11 June, was one of three squadrons that participated in the Allies' first attack on the Regia Aeronautica (Italian air force) base at El Adem: 18 Italian aircraft were destroyed or damaged on the ground, for the loss of three British aircraft.Playfair, Vol. I, page 112. The following day, the squadron participated in an attack on shipping at Tobruk, damaging the Italian cruiser San Giorgio.Playfair, Vol. I, pages 110, 112. During late 1940 the squadron supported Allied ground forces in the East African Campaign, while based at Gura, in Eritrea. During its time at Gura, the squadron suffered losses – on 2 October two Blenheims were shot down by an Italian ace, sergeant-major Luigi \\"Gino\\" Baron; among the aircrew killed was 45 Squadron's CO, Sqn Ldr John Dallamore.Håkan Gustavsson, 2015, \\"Biplane fighter aces, Italy, Sergente Maggiore Luigi 'Gino' Baron\\", Biplane Fighter Aces from the Second World War (4 June 2015). (See also the Italian language Wikipedia article on Gino Baron.) His successor was acting Sqn Ldr Patrick Troughton-Smith. In June 1941 to August 1941 the squadron was based at RAF Aqir in Palestine where it was involved in operations against the Vichy French in Lebanon and during an attack on Beirut on 10th July three were shot down in flames by Vichy French D-520 fighters. The crew of one were ordered to bale out but only the pilot, Sgt Wilton-Jones, survived although badly burned and hospitalized in Tripoli, Lebanon. The mission was a success as a ceasefire was declared at one minute past midnight on 12th July and the allies took over the hospital on 16th July. From mid-1942 the unit was deployed to Burma and India, for service against the Japanese. Three aircraft from the Squadron participated in the first Allied bombing raid against Bangkok.Air fighting, Auckland Star, Volume LXXIII, Issue 8, 10 January 1942, Page 7 ===Malayan Emergency=== Members of 45 Squadron in front of a Bristol Brigand at RAF Tengah, Singapore in 1950 RAF Butterworth, Malaya, in 1956/57 After the Second World War, No. 45 Squadron served in the Malayan Emergency, flying out of RAF Station Tengah on the island of Singapore. There the unit engaged in ground attack operations against Communist Terrorists (CTs) engaged in a Chinese backed insurgency. Dubbed Operation Firedog, these operations lasted for 12 years until the successful conclusion of the war. The unit also engaged in operations to quell unrest on the Sarawak coast in British North Borneo during this time period. While operating in Malaya the unit initially flew Bristol Beaufighters. From 1955 the squadron was based at RAF Butterworth in Malaya flying de Havilland Venoms under the command of Squadron Leader Geoffrey Cooper. ===1960s to 1980s=== Photos of 45 Squadron 1961 45 Sqn RAF Tengah 1961 RAF Tengah, Singapore, in 1963alt=right After re-equipping with English Electric Canberra B.15s in 1962, the squadron became involved in the Brunei Revolution and the subsequent Confrontation with Indonesia until its resolution in 1966. The squadron disbanded on 13 January 1970 after the UK's withdrawal from East of Suez. On 1 August 1972, the squadron was reformed at RAF West Raynham, equipped with Hawker Hunter FGA.9s, as a ground-attack training unit. The squadron disbanded in July 1976 at RAF Wittering after this role was taken over by the Tactical Weapons Unit. Hawker Hunter FGA9 XK137 of No. 45 Squadron in 1976 with the \\"Winged Camel\\" insignia marked on its nose In January 1984, the squadron number, as No. 45 (Reserve) Squadron, was assigned to the Tornado Weapons Conversion Unit (TWCU) at RAF Honington. As a 'Shadow Squadron' or war reserve, the squadron's war role was as a fully operational unit composed mainly of instructors, and assigned strike and other duties by SACEUR in support of land forces on the Continent resisting a Soviet assault on Western Europe, by striking at targets assigned by SACEUR, beyond the forward edge of the battlefield, deep within enemy-held areas, first with conventional weapons and later with tactical nuclear weapons if a conflict escalated to that level. The squadron's twenty-six Tornado aircraft were allocated thirty-nine WE.177 nuclear bombs. On 1 April 1992, the unit was disbanded and TWCU title dropped, with its aircraft and personnel becoming No. 15 (Reserve) Squadron, whilst maintaining the same training role. === 1992 onwards === No. 45 (R) Squadron King Air B200 GT ZK460 parked at La Rochelle Airport in France, 2015 (during Course No. 217's Overseas Training Flight) Embraer Phenom T1s of No. 45 Squadron at RAF Cranwell, April 2018 On 1 July 1992, the No. 45(R) Squadron identity was resurrected and adopted by the Multi-Engined Training Squadron (METS) at No. 6 FTS, RAF Finningley.

At sixteen he took the religious habit at San Domenico in Fiesole, where he studied under the direction of Savonarola and other eminent professors.Elias H.

In acquiring the Oriental languages, then cultivated at Florence, he displayed unwonted quicksightedness, ease and penetration. His genius, industry and erudition won him influential friends, among them the Cardinals de'Medici, subsequently popes Leo X and Clement VII. As a sacred orator his zeal and eloquence kept abreast with his erudition and were as fruitful. Summoned to Rome by Leo X, he taught at the recently-opened free school for Oriental languages until his patron's death (1521). He then spent three years at Avignon and the last seven years of his life at Lyon. Here he was instrumental in establishing a hospital for the plague-stricken, and by his zeal and eloquence, diverted an irruption of Waldensianism and Lutheranism from the city, receiving in acknowledgement the much coveted rights and privileges of citizenship. Here he also was in contact with the polymath and Hebraist Michael Servetus, whom he gave his notes to, and designated him as his heir to the scholarly study of the bible after he would have died.

He was a consulting botanist to the Royal Agricultural Society (1871–1909). James Bain. He was born in Moffat, Dumfriesshire, the son of merchant Samuel Carruthers. Educated at Moffat Academy, he graduated from the University of Edinburgh. As a student he supported himself by working as a tutor. In 1854 he began to study for the Presbyterian Ministry at New College, Edinburgh, but then decided to specialise in natural sciences. He became a lecturer in Botany at the New Veterinary College in Edinburgh, and served as assistant secretary to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. He became assistant in the botany department of the British Museum in 1859, becoming Keeper of Botany in 1871 and retiring in 1895. He oversaw the transfer of the British Museum botany collections from Bloomsbury to South Kensington, and saw off an attempt to have them moved to Kew. He married in 1865 Jeanie, daughter of William Moffat, architect, of Edinburgh. They had three children. Carruthers published scientific work on oaks, diatoms, mosses, fossil ferns, fossil Cycads, Calamites, and Lepidodendron. He was an expert on graptolites and in 1867 he contributed an article on them to the fourth edition of Roderick Murchison's Siluria. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1871. He was President of the Geologist's Association from 1875–1877. He was president of the Linnean Society from 1886 to 1890, and a member of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh. He was awarded a PhD by the University of Uppsala in 1907. === Religious views === William Carruthers was actively involved in the Presbyterian Church throughout his life. He was on its Committee on Publications (1880-1920) and edited the Messenger for Children (1876-1921). He was keenly interested in the history of Puritanism. === Views on evolution === Carruthers was skeptical about Darwin's theory of evolution. In his 1876 presidential address to the Geologist's Association he argued that \\"the facts of palaeontological botany are opposed to evolution\\". He argued that intermediate forms are absent in the plant fossil record, and that the plant fossil record is characterized by \\"sudden and simultaneous\\" appearances of different groups of plants. In 1886, as President of the Biological Section of the British Association, he gave an address that argued for lack of evolution in plants based on comparisons of modern plants with those from Egyptian tombs. ==References * Category:Scottish botanists Category:British taxonomists Category:Presidents of the Linnean Society of London Category:1830 births Category:1922 deaths Category:Employees of the Natural History Museum, London Category:Fellows of the Linnean Society of London Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:People from Moffat Category:19th-century British botanists Category:20th-century British botanists ","title":"William Carruthers (botanist)"},{"id":"6196290","text":"Hicham is a given name that may refer to: * Hicham Aaboubou (born 1978), Moroccan soccer player * Hicham Aboucherouane (born 1981), Moroccan football striker * Hicham Arazi (born 1973), Moroccan tennis player * Hicham Bellani (born 1979), Moroccan runner * Hicham Bouaouiche (born 1974), Moroccan long- distance runner * Hicham Chami (born 1977), Moroccan musician * Hicham El Guerrouj (born 1974), Moroccan middle-distance runner * Hicham El-Mashtoub (born 1972), Lebanese player of gridiron football * Hicham Louissi (born 1976), Moroccan footballer * Hicham Mahdoufi (born 1983), Moroccan footballer * Hicham Mezair (born 1976), Algerian footballer * Hicham Mesbahi (born 1980), Moroccan boxer * Hicham Zerouali (1977–2004), Moroccan footballer who played for Aberdeen == See also == * Hisham (name) * Hesham ","title":"Hicham"},{"id":"6196301","text":"Sodhe also called Sodha, Sonda or Swadi is a village near Sirsi in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka in India. ==Matha== Sodhe is the headquarters of the Sodhe Matha, one of the Ashta mathas established by Sri Madhvacharya, the famous Dvaita philosopher.

Versions were released for the Atari 5200 and Atari 8-bit family in 1983. Megamania is similar to Sega's 1981 arcade title Astro Blaster. Both games have nearly identical patterns of approaching enemies with the player relying on an \\"energy\\" meter. The player's ships are remarkably similar in both games. The game took Cartwright six months to initially develop and another three months to fine-tune. The band The Tubes performed a Megamania theme song in a 1982 television commercial advertising the Atari 2600 version of the game. ==Gameplay== Atari 2600 gameplay screenshot Megamania gameplay resembles that of Astro Blaster, but rather than being aliens or spaceships the enemies are various objects such as hamburgers, bow ties, and steam irons. The object is to shoot them down before the energy bar at the bottom of screen is depleted, all while avoiding the oncoming enemies and their own projectile attacks. Each of the enemies fly in select patterns and as soon as they hit the bottom of the screen, they re-appear at the top until shot by the player. The player's spacecraft depicted in the game is a cross between the U.S.S. Enterprise and Klingon battlecruiser from the Star Trek universe. ===Scoring=== The first cycle scores 20 to 90 points in 10 point increments each round for each object defeated; after the first cycle, every object destroyed scores 90 points. Once a wave is cleared, the player scores bonus points equal to the value of the object times the number of energy units remaining. Every 10,000 points gives the player an extra life; the player can have no more than six extra lives in stock at a time. If a player exceeds a score of 999,999 the game ends. ===Patch=== Anyone who scored above 45,000 points could send Activision a picture of their screen receive an \\"Official Megamaniac\\" emblem. ==Ports== Megamania was ported to the Atari 8-bit family and Atari 5200 by Glyn Anderson. The ports add a title screen and more detailed enemies, plus the names of the enemies listed in the manual have changed. There are \\"ice cream sandwiches\\" instead of \\"cookies,\\" \\"refrigerator magnets\\" instead of \\"bugs,\\" and \\"diamond rings\\" instead of \\"diamonds.\\" ==Reception== The original Atari 2600 version of Megamania received an award for \\"Most Humorous Home Arcade Game\\" at the 4th annual Arkie Awards. Video magazine reviewed the Atari 8-bit version in 1984, describing it \\"hardly different\\" in terms of gameplay from the original Atari 2600 version, but emphasizing its \\"visually enhanced\\" graphics that allow players \\"to clearly distinguish what each wave of attacking objects is supposed to represent\\". ==Legacy== The Atari 2600 version was included in with the Activision Anthology release in 2002.

It diverged from the Southbridge Branch in Lincoln and ran down Banks Peninsula in the Canterbury region of the South Island. It was opened to Little River in 1886 and operated until 1962. == Construction == Little River contained one of only two significant stands of timber in the Canterbury region (the other, near Oxford, was serviced by the Oxford Branch), and accordingly, plans were made to build a line to provide convenient transportation and stimulate economic activity. These were finalised in 1879, and construction was under way by the next year. On 16 May 1882, the first 27.44 km of the line were opened to Birdling's Flat, and almost four years later, the next nine kilometres were opened to Little River. There were proposals to extend the line as far as Akaroa, but these did not eventuate and Little River remained the terminus. == Operation == In the early years of the line, it operated profitably as large quantities of timber were transported by rail to destinations off the branch. This freight was mainly but not solely loaded in Little River. There was also significant agricultural activity in the area; livestock and farming supplies were important commodities at all stations. As time progressed, the timber traffic declined as no effort was made to replant and sustain the industry, and accordingly, the line's traffic became increasingly focused on the agricultural industry that was expanding into the felled areas. Passenger numbers totalled over 10,000 in the line's first year of operation, though no dedicated passenger trains ran. Instead, until 1927, passengers were carried on mixed trains. In 1927, an experiment was conducted on the Little River Branch when the Edison battery-electric railcar was trialled. It provided a twice daily dedicated passenger service each way between Christchurch and Little River, completing the trip in 69 minutes. Affordable and efficient, the railcar proved popular with travellers, but its life was abruptly cut short in 1934 when it was destroyed in a depot fire and not replaced due to the poor economic conditions of the Great Depression, forcing passengers back to the slower mixed trains. Around this time, traffic started to seriously decline. Timber traffic was becoming non-existent because resources were almost exhausted, and road transport was increasingly competitive with rail. A Royal Commission in 1930 had recommended that passenger services be cancelled and freight trains operated only thrice weekly, but provisions were made for passengers until 14 April 1951, and in 1952, goods trains were still operating nine times a week. However, the line was making a financial loss and service cuts could not alleviate it. With the line becoming too uneconomic to continue to operate, it was closed on 30 June 1962, along with the Southbridge Branch beyond Lincoln. == The branch today == Welcome sign leaning against the goods shed of the Little River Railway Station The Little River Branch is one of New Zealand's best preserved former railways. The Little River Rail Trail has been established as a walking and cycling track utilising the former track bed of the branch, in much the same style as the Otago Central Rail Trail. On 28 May 2006, the first section, from Motukarara to Catons Bay Reserve, was opened to the public, and plans exist to convert the entire line into a rail trail, though it may deviate from the railway's original route in places to ensure easy accessibility. Furthermore, the Little River station has been well preserved by the local community, who have converted into a centre that sells local craft and historical items. The platform and goods shed are still in good repair, and some metres of trackage have been installed so that a number of preserved freight wagons can be displayed. == References  Bibliography === * * * Hermann, Bruce J; South Island Branch Lines pp 9,10 (1997, New Zealand Railway & Locomotive Society, Wellington) * ==External links== *Patrick Dunford's Railways of New Zealand - Little River Branch: contains photos of the Little River Rail Trail and restored station.

He is known for allegedly hiding one of the biggest treasures in pirate history, estimated at over £1 billion, and leaving a cryptogram behind with clues to its whereabouts. ==Biography== Born at Calais during the Nine Years' War (1688–1697) to a wealthy bourgeois family, Levasseur became a naval officer after receiving an excellent education. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714), he procured a letter of marque from King Louis XIV and became a privateer for the French crown. When the war ended he was ordered to return home with his ship, but he instead joined the Benjamin Hornigold pirate company in 1716. Though he already had a scar across one eye limiting his sight, Levasseur proved himself a good leader and shipmate. After a year of successful looting, the Hornigold party split, Levasseur partnering briefly with Samuel Bellamy before deciding to try his luck on the Brazilian Coast. His ship was lost in a storm off Cotinga Island in Paranagua, Brazil, on March 9, 1718, but Levasseur reappeared in the Caribbean in June of that year in a smaller vessel that he managed to capture on his way back from Brazil. After William Moody was ejected from command by his disgruntled crew in late 1718, they elected Levasseur as captain in Moody's place. In 1719, he operated together with Howell Davis and Thomas Cocklyn (who had also served under Moody) for a time. In 1720, they attacked the slaver port of Ouidah, Kingdom of Whydah (on the coast of what is now Benin), reducing the local fortress to ruins. Later that year, he was shipwrecked in the Mozambique Channel and stranded on the island of Anjouan in the Comores. His bad eye had become completely blind by now, so he started wearing an eyepatch. From 1720 onwards, Levasseur launched his raids from a base on the island of Sainte-Marie, just off the coast of Madagascar, together with pirates John Taylor, Jasper Seagar, and Edward England. The Great Mughal's heavily armed but also heavily laden pilgrim ships to Mecca sailed these seas. Levasseur's quartermaster at this time was Paulsgrave Williams, who had been Bellamy's quartermaster and fellow captain until Bellamy was killed in a storm off Cape Cod. They first plundered the Laccadives, and sold the loot to Dutch traders for £75,000. Levasseur and Taylor eventually got tired of England's humanity and marooned him on the island of Mauritius. Jolly Roger flag of pirate Olivier Levasseur (La Buse), described as a \\"white ensign with a figure of a dead man spread in it\\"; one of the few mentions of a black-on-white Jolly Roger flag. They then perpetrated one of piracy's greatest exploits: the capture of the Portuguese great galleon Nossa Senhora do Cabo (Our Lady of the Cape) or Virgem Do Cabo (The Virgin of the Cape), which was loaded full of treasures belonging to the Bishop of Goa, also called the Patriarch of the East Indies, and the Viceroy of Portugal, who were both on board returning home to Lisbon. The pirates were able to board the vessel without firing a single broadside because the Cabo had been damaged in a storm; to avoid capsizing the crew had dumped all 72 cannon overboard, then anchored off Réunion island to undergo repairs. (This incident would later be used by Robert Louis Stevenson in his novel Treasure Island, in which the galleon is referred to as The Viceroy of the Indies in the account given by his famed fictional character Long John Silver). The booty consisted of bars of gold and silver, dozens of boxes full of golden Guineas, diamonds, pearls, silk, art, and religious objects from the Se Cathedral in Goa, including the Flaming Cross of Goa, made of pure gold and inlaid with diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. It was so heavy that it required three men to carry it to Levasseur's ship. In fact, the treasure was so huge that the pirates did not bother to rob the persons of the ship's passengers, something they normally would have done. When the loot was divided, each pirate received at least £50,000 worth of golden Guineas, as well as 42 diamonds each. Seagar died when they sailed to Madagascar to divide their take; Levasseur and Taylor split the remaining gold, silver, and other objects, with Levasseur taking the golden cross. In 1724, Levasseur sent a negotiator to the governor on the island of Bourbon (present-day Réunion) to discuss an amnesty that had been offered to all pirates in the Indian Ocean who would give up their practice. However, the French government wanted a large part of the stolen loot back, so Levasseur decided to avoid the amnesty and settled down in secret on the Seychelles archipelago. Eventually he was captured near Fort Dauphin, Madagascar. He was then taken to Saint-Denis, Réunion, and hanged for piracy at 5PM on 7 July 1730. ==The treasure== The Cryptogram of Olivier Levasseur Alphabet of Olivier Levasseur Legend tells that when he stood on the scaffold to be hanged, Levasseur wore a necklace containing a cryptogram of 17 lines, and threw this into the crowd while exclaiming: \\"Find my treasure, the one who may understand it!\\" The necklace has been lost, but treasure hunters have since tried to decode the cryptogram, hoping its solution will lead to a treasure. In 1947, Englishman Reginald Cruise-Wilkins, a neighbour of Mrs. Savy, studied the documents, but the cryptogram was much more difficult to solve than first believed. Cruise-Wilkins' early writing indicates that the code may be based on Masonic symbolism. Cruise-Wilkins claimed to have discovered a connection with the Zodiac, the Clavicles of Solomon, and the Twelve Labours of Hercules. Various tasks, representing the Labours of Hercules, had to be undertaken in strict order. The treasure chamber is somewhere underground and must be approached carefully, to avoid being flooded. It is protected by the tides, which requires damming to hold them back, and is to be approached from the north. Until his death at Réunion, Cruise-Wilkins sought and dug in the island of Mahé. In a cave, except for old guns, some coins, and pirate sarcophagi, he did not find anything. He died on 3 May 1977 before he broke the last piece of code. His son, Seychellois history teacher John, is currently still seeking the treasure, concluding that after using state-of-the-art equipment, he needs \\"to go back to the old method, [getting] into this guy's mind, [claiming he is] ten down, two to go in his Herculean Labours.\\"'One Man's Search for Buried Treasure' by Jean-Marc Mojon (Agence France-Presse) in The Jakarta Globe of 14 December 2009, Features C3 ==Popular culture== *Basil Rathbone plays Levasseur in the 1935 Errol Flynn film Captain Blood. *The story of Levasseur's treasure was featured in the comic book series Spike and Suzy (also known in the UK as Bob & Bobette or the original names Suske en Wiske by the Flemish author Willy Vandersteen), in the album The Amazing Coconut (1990).

Their stronghold was in West Sussex and Surrey where they formed co-operatives in some villages. They were widely known as \\"Cokelers\\", a nickname of uncertain derivation but which was used from an early date. ==History== The former chapel at Warnham, West Sussex. Members of the Society of Dependants were Protestant dissenters whose beliefs largely derived from Wesleyan Arminianism.Wesleyan Arminianism, Steven Harper, Four Views on Eternal Security (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2002)Peter Jerome, John Sirgood's Way: The Story of the Loxwood Dependants, Peter Jerome, Window press, Petworth, Sussex (1998) They believed in the people's ability to exercise free will and thereby achieve salvation rather than the Calvinistic assertion of predestination. They were conscientious objectors to the war and were encouraged but not required to remain unmarried. Beginning in the 1850s meetings were held on commons or in barns and faced great opposition from the landed gentry and the clergy. Both men and women preached, which was unusual at that time, seeking converts among the poor and humble. They first established themselves at Loxwood because it was outside of the control of the large estates whose Anglican owners would have denied them land or premises. As it was the sect was threatened with legal action for unlawful meetings by the parish authorities in Loxwood in 1861 and many letters were written by both sides but no action was taken. The repeal of the Conventicle Act soon after this left the sect free to worship openly. The first chapel was opened there in 1861. Seven more chapels were built in Norwood, Shamley Green, Warnham, Lords Hill, Northchapel, Chichester and Hove. These were simple undecorated buildings, with a room where those who had walked long distances to attend could rest during the day-long Sunday worship. A number of combination stores were opened around 1879 in Norwood, Lord's Hill, Northchapel, Warnham and Loxwood, where members lived communally, investing and working in the business. Some followers disagreed with entering the world of commerce but the shops were successful, selling everything from soap to suspenders, bacon to bootlaces. They also grew their own produce to sell, living communally on tenanted farms. When there was a fashion for cycling in the 1890s they opened bicycle shops at Northchapel, Loxwood and Warnham. The Loxwood site included a steam bakery. At Northchapel in the early 20th century the stores consisted of three departments, employing thirteen saleswomen and assistants, together with delivery drivers. At the same date the Warnham stores employed thirty one people of both sexes. Most of the staff lived over the shops. All profits were put back in the business or used to help the needy. They also made furniture to sell: attractive, sturdy pieces, some of which still survive. The following verse comes from the Dependants' Hymn BookPamela Bruce,Northchapel A Parish History (2000) Published by Northchapel Parish Council. :Christ's Combination Stores for me :Where I can be so well supplied, :Where I can one with brethren be, :Where competition is defied.. The group declined in numbers through the twentieth century, and, by the late 1980s, there were only handful of adherents remaining, worshipping in Loxwood and Northchapel.Mick Ree, \\"The Lord Does Combination Love: Religion and Co- operation Amongst a Peculiar People\\", in Stephen Yeo, [books.google.co.uk/books?id=VHsOAAAAQAAJ New Views of Co-operation] ==Beliefs and customs== The former chapel at Hove. With a system of beliefs similar to the Peculiar People in Essex the Dependants believed that when without sin they would each be possessed of a small part of the divine body of Christ and that a place would be reserved for them at the high table at the marriage feast in Heaven. Members of the sect would not listen to secular music, read books other than the Bible, play games or have flowers in the home. They would not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol. They were pacifists and were conscientious objectors during the world wars, when they were mostly allowed to continue working on the farms. The Lord's Prayer was not used in their worship, as it was regarded by Sirgood as an earthly institution which was incompatible with the higher life the Brethren wished to lead. The sect had no marriage ceremony and discouraged marriage as coming between a person and their God, although it was not forbidden and many dependants were married. Unusually for a Christian sect the elders of the chapels would permit a young couple to live together in a trial marriage for up to two years, after which time they could separate or marry in a church or secular ceremony. The whole sect would be at chapel on Sundays and usually another two evenings per week as well as any public holidays, travelling great distances from outlying farms in many cases. The women would wear small black bonnets of woven straw and velvet, black shawls, black coats and black full-length skirts, with their hair pulled back into a plaited bun. The men would also be dressed in dark clothing and hats and have muttonchop whiskers and a small beard under the chin. Each chapel would have a \\"Leader\\" and a few other elders known as \\"Stalwarts\\". They had no music and no printed prayer book, prayers rather being copied out by hand. The Leader would begin by reading out a series of rhyming couplets which the congregation would chant after him, then would read a chapter of the Bible with added commentary on its moral teachings. Following this members of the congregation might spontaneously sing Cokeler hyms and testify in broad Sussex dialect, but without the silences of a Quaker meeting. There would be a back room at the chapel for members who had come a long distance to eat and rest between morning and evening services. On Bank holidays the congregations might travel to special services at Loxwood. ==Names of the sect== While calling themselves Dependants the sect were known to outsiders as Cokelers. Writers have speculated as to the origin of the term cokeler. It may have originated from John Sirgood's habit of drinking cocoa, a drink little known in the countryside at that time. Henry W Stiles, writing in 1931, claimed to have been told by Peter Pacy, a disciple of Sirgood, that if offered beer when preaching at village inns Sirgood would reply \\"no but I will have some cocoa\\". Another possible explanation is that part of Loxwood was known as Cokkeg, although there are no written references to this name on maps in use during Sirgood's time there. R J Sharpe, writing from Chichester in 1931, said that the sect were also locally known as \\"Ranters\\". It has also been proposed that Cokeler is derived from the Sussex dialect word 'Coke' meaning to pry or peepDictionary of Sussex Dialect, Rev W D Parish, Farnombe & co, 1875 Another possible explanation is that Cokelers is a corruption of \\"cuckolders\\", based on mistrust of the unusual aversion to marriage in the sect and its tolerance of young couples living together for a period before either marrying or separating. The sect disliked the name and would not use it. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * == External links == * Living Home page * Pastfinders * Society of Dependents (Cokelers): Loxwood (National Register of Archives) * Loxwood, Sussex, England * Adherents.com * The Cokelers Society of Dependants Category:History of Christianity in England ","title":"Society of Dependants"},{"id":"6196400","text":"Moeyo Ken, known in Japan as , is a PS2 video game from 2002 about magical girl variants of Shinsengumi, a police force, and of Sakamoto Ryunosuke and his illegal companion, Nekomaru. The game was adapted into an OVA and a television series. Moeyo Ken was created by Hiroi Oji, creator of the Sakura Wars series, with character designs by Rumiko Takahashi, the creator of Ranma 1/2 and Inuyasha. ADV Films licensed it effective September 25, 2006 for $43,335. ==TV Series== Set in an alternate universe Meiji Era, the lead male character of the story, Ryunosuke Sakamoto, is travelling from Shanghai towards Kyoto with his newly licensed yōkai Nekomaru. The law in the story states that to be in legal possession of such a creature that it must be licensed. The Shinsengumi are enforcers of this law. ==CharactersThe Mobile Shinsengumi=== ;Yuko Kondo : : is the daughter of Isami Kondo and field commander of the Mobile Shinsengumi. She has a habit of breaking her sword in battle, and a tendency to rack up debts wherever she goes. Yuko is slightly scatterbrained and has pink hair, and enjoys making fun of Okita's breasts. :Kondo seems to be the fondest of the three girls of Oryou, since she frequently imagines the older woman committing suicide if Ryuunosuke were to return to Shanghai. To prevent this from happening, she comes up with various harebrained ideas to keep the young man in Kyoto by making him fall in love with a local waitress named Sayoko. Most of her plans to make the pair fall in love fail miserably, and soon her plans become less about preventing his departure and more about succeeding. :Kondo somewhat resembles the female version of Ranma Saotome from Ranma ½, with her tomboyish attitude, huge appetite, crazy schemes and constant debts. ;Toshie Hijikata : : is the daughter of Toshizo Hijikata and the Mobile Shinsengumi's crackshot sharpshooter. While she may be an expert on guns, she is not an excellent cook (due to having a bad sense of taste). Not much of her background is known, but apparently she cannot remember her mother's face and the only photo she has of her is missing a face. As a result, Gennai created a \\"mother\\" robot that is an exact double of Toshie, which caused some confusion. :Hijikata seems to be the most intelligent of the three girls, since she is seen relaxing in a hot spring by reading a Jules Verne book. She is also the most logical of them, to the point where Kondo often claims she's like a machine. She also strongly resembles a female version of Sesshomaru from Inuyasha, since she has similar long white hair, Chinese-influenced clothes, an icy attitude and is dismissive of slapstick. ;Kaoru Okita :Voiced by: Haruna Ikezawa (Japanese) ; Jessica Schwartz (OVA), Nancy Novotny (TV series) (English) : is the daughter of Soji Okita. She uses all sorts of weapons including shikigami of the legendary beasts (Genbu, Byakko, Seiryu and Suzaku). Kaoru takes it personally when she's told about her breast size. :It is revealed later in the series that Okita is actually only half human, having a kitsune mother who married Soji Okita and later abandoned her daughter, claiming she couldn't live among humans. She also has a kitsune older brother. Additionally, she develops a major crush on Ryuunosuke. ;Ryunosuke Sakamoto :Voiced by: Chisa Yokoyama (Japanese); Evan Slack (OVA), Blake Shepard (TV series) (English) : is the son of Oryo, president of the Shinsengumi. Ryuunosuke was sent to Shanghai at the age of ten to learn more about the world. He recently returned from Shanghai and brought a monster named Nekomaru to Kyoto for registration. Ryunosuke is a bit odd and has a peculiar sense of humor, but he is nevertheless determined to help out the Mobile Shinsengumi. He seems to also have a crush on Yuko. In the 8th episode of the series he temporarily turns into a girl because Nekomaru killed him with soap and switched his soul with that of a female. ;Nekomaru : : is a bakeneko, a monster cat, who traveled with Ryunosuke from Shanghai to Kyoto. Nekomaru whines and cowers whenever there is trouble, which becomes more understandable as the series goes on because Gennai frequently uses him as a guinea pig. :Nekomaru is 300 years old and seems to have a fair amount of power. His most useful ability is being able to transfer one of his nine lives to someone who has died, resurrecting them in perfect health. He seems particularly fond of Ryunosuke and seems to want the young man to be happy. ;Gennai Hiraga : : is the Mobile Shinsengumi's resident mad doctor who builds new weapons and gadgets to aid the team in stopping unlicensed monsters from destroying Tokyo. Most of his gadgets are useless and/or dangerous, such as the digging machine fueled by monsters' power. However, he is an excellent cook and a few of his gadgets are actually useful. :Gennai does have a ruthless side: he often uses Nekomaru to test his inventions, which frequently has unpleasant results for the monster cat. And if people around him aren't sufficiently helpful, he acquires gleaming eyes and a demonic rumbling voice. Nekomaru claims that Gennai is even more of a monster than he is. :Gennai strongly resembles Dr. Tofu from Rumiko Takahashi's Ranma ½. ;Kiyomi Watase : : : ===The Tsubame Group=== are the villains in the Meji Era representing the new government and try to return monsters to their old selves before monster registration was effective. The compose of mean girl , handsome and fearless and the short and strange . They greatly resemble Team Rocket from the Pokémon franchise. ;Miki Saotome :Voiced by: Rumi Kasahara (Japanese); Shannon Grounds (English) :Miki Saotome is the cruel and ruthless leader of the Tsubame Group, which consists of Ukon Tanaka and Sakon Suzuki. Her intentions are to turn all monsters to her side and destroy Kyoto and the Mobile Shinsengumi, and take over the world. It's hinted that she may have feelings for Ukon, but this is not specifically made clear as she treats him like he were her servant (which he is). It is revealed that she was once a priestess of a shrine before it was destroyed by monsters. Miki does not fight, but she is a practitioner of black magic which is used to summon a destructive demon. ;Ukon Tanaka :Voiced by: Takeshi Kusao (Japanese); Gray Haddock (English) :Ukon Tanaka is a fierce and courageous swordsman who takes pride in how charming he believes he is. He is also the Tsubame group's second-in-command. While he isn't Miki's ideal \\"knight in shining armor\\" He still holds himself to that status and calls Miki a \\"princess\\" (though whether she is a princess or not isn't specified). It is revealed that before he met Miki, he was training to become a master swordsman, but he was defeated in a tournament and was forced to abandon any hopes of becoming one. Ukon fights using a samurai katana (similar to the one Yuko uses). ;Sakon Suzuki :Voiced by: Toshihiko Nakajima (Japanese); Bill Wise (English :Sakon Suzuki is a short, overweight, and possibly mentally crazy member of the Tsubame group. He loves Chinese cabbage and continuously talks about it or refers to it at the most inappropriate times, but occasionally he does talk about other things (like tempura or Chinese candies). He is also hinted to be rather gluttonous with an almost uncontrollable appetite (clarified in one episode where he tried to eat a nikuman that was stuffed with a gas that inflates a human being like a balloon). Despite Sakon's random outbursts and constant references to Chinese cabbage, he is very loyal to Miki and would be lost without her (and Ukon). Sakon fights with a wooden self hand-crafted bazooka. ==NotesReferences== * * * ==External links== *Moeyo Ken at Funimation *Moeyo Ken at A.D.

They are large sexually dimorphic cuckoos that eat fruits and insects and have loud distinctive calls. They are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other species. == Taxonomy == A molecular genetic study by Sorenson and Payne (2005) found that the closest relative of Eudynamys is the dwarf koel (Microdynamis parva), and beyond that the thick-billed cuckoo (Pachycoccyx audeberti). They found that the long-tailed cuckoo (Urodynamis taitensis) of New Zealand and the Pacific, which had earlier been placed in Eudynamys as E. taitensis and sometimes called the long-tailed koel, was more distantly related, along with other members of the tribe Cuculini, including the white-crowned cuckoo (Cacomantis leucolophus), also known as the white- crowned koel. However, not all the evidence for the relationships was very strong and further research was required.Sorenson, Michael D.; Payne, Robert B. (2005). \\"A molecular genetic analysis of cuckoo phylogeny\\". In Payne, Robert B. The Cuckoos. Oxford University Press. pp. 90, 93. . ===Species=== The taxonomy of the common koel complex is difficult and remains a matter of dispute, with some only recognizing a single species (common koel, Eudynamys scolopaceus, with melanorhynchus and orientalis as subspecies), two species (common koel, Eudynamys scolopaceus, with orientalis as a subspecies, and black-billed koel, Eudynamys melanorhynchus) or three species (as done below). ===Sexual Dimorphism=== The female koel's plumage is banded and speckled in shades of brown. The evolutionary function is to camouflage her approach to her host's nest and enable her brood parasitism to go undetected. Noisy miner and wattle birds have been observed feeding their fledglings. The male's sexually dimorphic plumage is black, like a raven. They are of a similar size to ravens and are known to have territories that overlap with ravens. They have also been observed being mobbed by noisy miners and wattle birds in the same way as ravens (egg predators) are. The male koel may be a raven mimic enabling the female to approach the host's nest, either deliberately or opportunistically, while the host flock is engaged in (distracted) mobbing the male. {  - !

Khatoon (خاتون) is a variant of the word Khanoom (خانوم), or Khanom (خانم). Any one of these three words (in particular the latter one) is often added to a woman's name in token of respect; it therefore need not be part of the official name of a woman. The official use of Khatoon is rare, if not obsolete, in the present-day Iran, and of the remaining two, Khanom is formal and Khanoom rather colloquial. The words Khatoon, Khanoom and Khanom, the feminine forms of the word Khan, are of Mongolian origin.Astarabadi (استرآبادی) refers to the people of Astarabad (استرآباد), the modern city of Gorgan and the capital of the Golestan Province of Iran. () (1858/9 – 1921) was a notable Iranian writer, satirist, and one of the pioneering figures in the women's movement of Iran. Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi was born to the family of Mohammad Baqer Khan Astarabadi, one of the notable men of Astarabad (the present-day Gorgan), and Khadijeh Khanom (خديجه خانم), known asBāji means both Female servant, and Sister. In the latter case it is a variant of the word Ābji, Sister. The writer of these lines is not familiar with the etymology of these words, however it is disconcertingly plausible that at some point in history parents and/or brothers may have come to see their daughters and/or sisters respectively as female servants in the household. What is more likely, however, is that Bāji simply means Sister and that its meaning as Female servant may be attributable to the fact that through referring to a female servant as Bāji one has intended, and intends, to be familial and convey the implicit verbal assurance that she would not be subjected to sexual harassment by the male members of the family; it is rather common in Iran that one conveys a similar statement by addressing a member of the opposite sex as brother or sister, as the case may be (when used inappropriately or in excess, such use may be viewed as patronising however). Mollah Bāji (ملاباجی), one of the companions of Shokuh ol-Saltaneh (شکوه السلطنه), wife to Nasser al-Din Shah Qajar. The title Mollah Bāji (see Mollah) is indicative that she must have been educated and in charge of more than the daily household chores of Shah's Court. Indeed, she has been in charge of the education of the children in the court of Nasser al-Din Shah. At the age of 22, Bibi Khatoon married Musa Khan Vaziri who was a prominent official in the Persian Cossack Brigade. They had seven children, of whom the most distinguished are Colonel Ali-Naqi Vaziri (musicologist, composer, a celebrated player of the tar, and the founder of the Academy of Music of Iran as well of Iran's National Orchestra), and Hasan Vaziri (an artistic painter).Bibi Khanom Astarabadi (Gorgani), A short biography of Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi (in Persian), containing some transcripted material from an interview by Deutsche Welle with Dr Mah-Laghā Mallah (دكتر مه لقا ملاح), maternal granddaughter of Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi (Shomaliha.com ). Dr Mah- Laghā Mallah (دكتر مه لقا ملاح), founder and director of Iran's \\"Women's Society against Environmental Pollution\\" (founded in 1992 to educate children and mothers, as well as state's officials, about dangers of environmental pollution) is the maternal granddaughter of Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi.For an interview, made in 2006 by Deutsche Welle, with Dr Mah-Laghā Mallah, see External Links. Bibi Khatoon was one of the influential figures in the Iranian constitutional revolution in the late 19th and the early 20th century. She founded the first school for girls (named The School for Girls – دبستان دوشیزگان) in the modern history of Iran and wrote numerous articles in defence of the right of girls to receive universal education. Her articles appeared in such newspapers as Tamaddon (تمدن - Civilization), Habl al-Matin (حبل المتين - Firm Rope) and Majles (مجلس - Parliament). Bibi Khatoon is also known for her book Ma'ayeb al-Rejal (معايب الرجال - Failings of Men),The extant translation of the title Ma'ayeb al-Rejal (معايب الرجال) as Vices of Men, or even The Vices of Men, is incorrect when the contents of the book are disregarded. The word Ma'ayeb (معايب), or Oyoub (عیوب), is the plural of the Persian (in fact Arabic) word Eyb (عیب), which refers to a shortcoming or a failing, rather than a vice per se. To clarify, according to OED, Failing means \\"A defect of character; a weakness\\", whereby Failings is seen to be an apt choice for Ma'ayeb. In contrast, according to the same dictionary, Vice means \\"Extreme moral corruption; depravity; evil; grossly immoral or degrading habits or conduct\\". The word Fesq (فسق) would be appropriately translated as Vice. Only through taking the contents of the book into account, can one consider Vices as an appropriate translation of Ma'ayeb. The books in section Further reading should be illuminating. which was a critical response to the pamphlet Ta'deeb al-Nesvan (تاديب النسوان - Edification of Women)In general, Ta'deeb (تاديب) also means Disciplinary punishment, reflecting the implicit assumption that the latter would lead to edification. by an anonymous author. Ma'ayeb al-Rejal was published in 1895, eleven years before the inauguration of Iran's system of constitutional monarchy in 1906 by the decree of Mozaffar al-Din Shah Qajar.Bibi Khanom Astarabadi (Gorgani), ibid. This book is considered by some as the first declaration of women's rights in the recent history of Iran. ==The School for Girls (دبستان دوشیزگان)== Founded in 1907 at the residential home of Bibi Khatoon in Tehran, it was attended both by young girls and their mothers as well as grandmothers, for some of the latter it may have been a unique opportunity for obtaining formal education for the first time in their lives. The school was equipped with such facilities as may be taken for granted from the present-day perspective (such as desks), however it should be borne in mind that this school provision was part of Bibi Khatoon's residential home and not part of a purpose-built educational facility.The School for Girls (مدرسه دوشيزگان). A programme celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Constitutional Revolution of Iran with an interview with Dr Mah-Laghā Mallah (دكتر مه لقا ملاح), maternal granddaughter of Bibi Khatoon Astarabadi, 11 August 2006 (Deutsche Welle). The date 1907, indicated above, is somewhat uncertain to the present writer; according to Dr Mah-Laghā Mallah, \\"This school was established before the Constitutional Revolution (انقلاب مشروط)\\", which took place between 1905 and 1911; the First Majlis was elected in 1906, to be made defunct through the coup d'état of Mohammad-Ali Shah Qajar in June 1908. This clearly testifies to Bibi Khatoon's wholehearted dedication to the cause of women's education in Iran. > Advertisement > The School for Girls A new school, named The School for Girls [دبستان > دوشیزگان], has been opened near the old gate of Mahmmadieh, the Hāji > Mohammad-Hossein market.

The subjects taught at this school consisted of, in alphabetic order, Arabic language, Arithmetic, Cookery, Geography, History, Law, Music, Persian literature, and Religion, to name but some. It is relevant to point out that in 1936, almost thirty years after the establishment of The School for Girls, 12 women were for the first time admitted to University of Tehran, who entered all faculties. According to the official data provided by Iran's ministry of higher education, at the turn of the present century some 70% of all students in higher education were women; according to the same data, however, by the same time only 20% of the PhD positions at academic institutions were occupied by women.These statements need to be verified, as the present writer is not in possession of the original reports containing these data and relies solely on secondary sources. The historical site of The School for Girls survived in its original form for some 22 years following the death of Bibi Khatoon in 1921; in 1943 this site was sold (for 25,000 Tumans) by the extant members of Bibi Khatoon's direct family.The School for Girls (مدرسه دوشيزگان), ibid. ==Activities in support of the Constitutional RevolutionOn Ta'deeb al- Nesvan (تاديب النسوان - Edification of Women)== According to Ebrahim Nabavi,The present writer has consulted neither Ta'deeb al-Nesvan nor Ma'ayeb al-Rejal. Some familiarity with this genre of the literature of the time suggests however that Ta'deeb al-Nesvan may not have been more than a prank by a member of Iran's aristocracy of the time. Ta'deeb al-Nesvan, published in 1288 AH (1895), is a small booklet authored by one of the princes of the Qajar Court, \\"who must have feared his wife so greatly that he has not had the courage to put his name on it as its author\\" (in other words, the author of the book is an anonymous Prince). A short summary of the main recommendations in this book, aimed at the \\"edification\\" of women, is as follows:Ebrahim Nabavi, ibid. #Woman is a being who similar to a child must be educated by a man. #Salvation of woman is conditional upon her absolute obedience to her husband. #Woman must never ask a favour from her husband; it is up to husband to deign to confer favours to his wife. #The duty of woman at home is provision of conditions that are conducive to her husband's tranquility. #The aim of matrimony consists of gratification of the husband's sexual desires. #Woman must at all times be abashed, except in bed. #Woman must not speak during meals. #Woman must, like an ailing individual, walk slowly. : Etc. The Vices of Men (Ma'ayib al-Rijal) (1887),a pungent satire, is in fact an answer to an earlier work entitled The Education of Women (Ta'dib al-Niswan (translated into English by E. Powys Mathers in his Eastern Love, vol.iii, London, 1904). The anonymous writer of the latter seems to be a chauvinistic prince, and following the medieval tradition that was not accepted by Shia Muslim clerics. Bibi Khanum's answers to such absurdities are scathingly indignant. She writes that \\"genius of the world and unique writer of our times\\" seems strangely bereft of his senses. \\"He should have first corrected his own vices and then given us advice. One who has no share of existence, how can he inspire life? ...He regards himself as 'Westernized' and 'civilized,' but in fact, he is not even 'half-civilized.'(سیویلیزه و نیم ویلیزه) Does he not know that Europeans treat their women like flowers, and women freely associate with men?\\" The indication that the author was westernised clearly indicates, he must have been from the so-called western influenced intellectuals. Strangely enough at the time women had very few rights in the west in comparison to Iran and only in some parts of the western world had been able to claim their rights to inheritance. These two works were published by Hasan Javadi as \\"Two Qajar Essays on Men and Women: Ta'dib al-Nivan and Ma'ayib al-Rijal\\" in Washington in 1992. رویایی زن و مرد در عصر قاجار در عصر قاجار: دو رساله تادیب النسوان و معایب الرجال ==Response of Bibi Khatoon: Ma'ayeb al-Rejal (معايب الرجال - Failings of Men)== According to Ebrahim Nabavi,Ebrahim Nabavi, ibid. Ma'ayeb al-Rejal consists of two main parts, in one of which Bibi Khatoon responds directly to the contents of Ta'deeb al- Nesvan, and in the other she describes the conditions prevailing in the men's social gatherings of her time. True to her usual style of writing, Bibi Khatoon's tone in this book is derisive.

The colony was established first on principles of primitive socialism, but later championed an individualistic vegetarianism and hosted the Monte Verità Sanatorium, a sun-bathing establishment.Landmann (1979), p. 13-20 It has been cited as an example of \\"light asceticism\\" which arose during the Belle Epoque, inspired by Tolstoyan values. The colonists \\"abhorred private property, practised a rigid code of morality, strict vegetarianism and nudism. They rejected convention in marriage and dress, party politics and dogmas: they were tolerantly intolerant.\\" Anarchist physician Raphael Friedeberg moved to Ascona in 1904, attracting many other anarchists to the area. Artists and other famous people attracted to this hill included Hermann Hesse, Carl Jung, Erich Maria Remarque, Hugo Ball, Else Lasker-Schüler, Stefan George, Isadora Duncan, Carl Eugen Keel, Paul Klee, Carlo Mense, Arnold Ehret, Rudolf Steiner, Mary Wigman, Max Picard, Ernst Toller, Henry van de Velde, Fanny zu Reventlow, Rudolf von Laban, Frieda and Else von Richthofen, Otto Gross, Erich Mühsam, Karl Wilhelm Diefenbach, Walter Segal, Max Weber, Gustav Stresemann,Landmann (1979), p. 59-60 and Gustav Nagel. Modernist hotel by Emil Fahrenkamp From 1913 to 1918, Rudolf Laban operated a \\"School for Art\\" on Monte Verità, and in 1917 Theodor Reuss, Master of the Ordo Templi Orientis organized a conference there covering many themes, including societies without nationalism, women's rights, mystic freemasonry, and dance as art, ritual and religion.Landmann (1979), p. 144-146 From 1923 to 1926, Monte Verità was operated as a hotel by artists Werner Ackermann, Max Bethke and Hugo Wilkens, until it was acquired in 1926 by Baron Eduard von der Heydt. The following year, a new Modernist- style hotel was built by Emil Fahrenkamp. Eduard von der Heydt died in 1964, and the site became the property of the Canton of Ticino. ==Present== Monte Verità is currently home to the ETH Zurich conference facility, Centro Stefano Franscini, as well as a museum comprising three buildings: the Casa Anatta, a flat-roofed wooden building which served as headquarters to the vegetarian colony and now houses an exhibition of the history of the site; the Casa Selma, a small building which was used to house sun-bathers at the Sanatorium; and a building housing the panoramic painting \\"The Clear World of the Blessed\\", by Elisar von Kupffer. The hill is also the site of a tea garden and Japanese teahouse. ==In fiction== A fictionalized version of the colony at Monte Verità is the subject of a short story named \\"Monte Verità\\" by the Cornish author Daphne du Maurier which appeared in The Apple Tree published in 1952, and then republished under the name The Birds and Other Stories. A.S. Byatt's 2009 novel The Children's Book mentions the colony, as does Robert Dessaix's 1996 novel Night Letters.

He played for Wynnum-Manly in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership's grand final in 1982. He was then one of seven Queensland- based players to go on the 1982 Kangaroo tour (with a squad later dubbed \\"The invincibles\\") to Great Britain - the others were Wally Lewis, Rohan Hancock, Mark Murray, Rod Morris, Mal Meninga and Greg Conescu. Miles couldn't break into the Test team and played against club sides and in an international against Wales. He made his Test début the following year.

The following year, he announced his retirement from representative football so he could concentrate on his job as captain of the fledgling Brisbane club, helping the Broncos to the play-offs for the first time in 1990. ==England== After 72 first grade games for the Broncos, 14 Tests for Australia (including two Kangaroo tours) and 19 State of Origin matches for Queensland, Miles accepted a contract offer from Wigan, making his début in October 1991 against Featherstone Rovers. Miles played 29 matches for Wigan as they won a treble of Championship, Challenge Cup and Premiership. His journey to England, struggle with injuries and adaptation to the English game was chronicled as part of the BBC2 documentary series Up & Under, which followed Wigan and local union side Orrell R.U.F.C. during their 1991-92 campaigns. Whilst at Wigan, Miles formed a formidable partnership with winger Martin Offiah. ==Playing style== Initially one of a group of fast and skillful heavyweight Queensland centres along with Mal Meninga and Chris Close, Miles size saw him moved into the towards the end of his Australian career, though he generally played in the centres with Wigan. Miles was particularly skilled in passing, and noted for his ability to use his 6'4\\" (193 cm) height to his advantage and off-load the ball with a one-handed basketball style. ==Post-playing== Miles returned to Australia to pursue a media career with Channel Nine and in 2000, was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in the sport of rugby league. In 2001 Miles was appointed Chairman of Selectors for the Queensland State of Origin. He is also the Executive Director of the non- profit organisation Former Origin Greats (FOGS). During the 2007 season at the Broncos' 20-year anniversary celebration, the club announced a list of the 20 best players to play for them to date which included Miles. In February 2008, Miles was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. In June 2008, he was chosen in the Queensland Rugby League's Team of the Century on interchange bench. As of 2017, Miles is a selector for Queensland's State of Origin team along with Darren Lockyer and head coach Kevin Walters. ==Footnotes *Gene Miles at rl1908.com * *Queensland Team of the Century named - article at nz.leagueunlimited.com *Gene Miles at Foley Shield fan site *About FOGS *Queensland representatives at qrl.com.au Category:1959 births Category:Rugby league players from Queensland Category:Wynnum Manly Seagulls players Category:Queensland Rugby League State of Origin players Category:Brisbane Broncos players Category:Brisbane Broncos captains Category:Wigan Warriors players Category:Australian rugby league commentators Category:Australian rugby league coaches Category:Australia national rugby league team players Category:Recipients of the Australian Sports Medal Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Townsville Category:Brisbane rugby league team players Category:Rugby league second-rows ","title":"Gene Miles"},{"id":"6196538","text":"John Morris (19 February 1810 - 7 January 1886) was an English geologist. ==Life== He was born in 1810 at Homerton, London, and educated at private schools. He was engaged for some years as a pharmaceutical chemist at Kensington, but soon became interested in geology and other branches of science, and ultimately retired from business. His published papers speedily attracted notice, and his Catalogue of British Fossils, published in 1845, a work involving much critical research, added greatly to his reputation. Morris was professor of geology at University College, London from 1854 to 1877. He was elected F.G.S. in 1845. Along with Bowerbank and five others, he was a founding member of the London Clay Club. Morris was president of the Geologists' Association from 1868–1871 and from 1877–1879. He was awarded the Lyell Medal in 1876. Morris's best original work was done on Eocene and Jurassic rocks. His Catalogue of British Fossils was an important pioneering effort in palaeontology. He died on 7 January 1886, and was buried at Kensal Green.

He was an officer in the British India corps Bengal Engineers, and the grandson of William Stanley Clarke, Director (1815–1842) and Chairman (1835–1836) of the East India Company. ==Biography== Born in 1840, his father was Richard Henley Clarke and mother was Charlotte Raikes (Clarke). His siblings were William Henley Stanley Clarke, Caroline Eliza Stanley Clarke and Alice Mary Clarke. His grandfather was William Stanley Clarke, Director (1815–1842) and later chairman (1835–1836) of the East India Company. He started his career with the Royal Engineers, and joined Bengal Engineers, then a part of the British Indian Army's Bengal Army, in 1860. He took part in the Abyssinia campaign of 1867, Nile Expedition of 1884–1885, and was subsequently made Lt. Colonel in 1887. Additional Biographical Details Published in 'The Royal Engineers Journal' Vol III, No3, March 1906 pp, 192,193 MEMOIR Lt.-Col., H. WILBERFORCE CLARKE, R.E. THERE has recently passed away one of the most brilliant and versatile of the many good men turned out from the H.ELC's Military Seminary at Addiscombe. Henry Wilberforce Clarke, the subject of this memoir, was born in 1840, educated at Cheltenham College, and finally at Addiscombe (1858—1860) which he left, second of his \\"batch” (the last batch of the old Indian Engineers), as a lieutenant in the old Bengal Engineers (8 June, 186o). After the usual time under instruction at Chatham, he went out to India in October 1862, and in May, 1863, joined the Indian Public Works Department, wherein he soon made his mark. A fine career in the P.W.D. might now have been expected for him. Unfortunately his health broke down early (in 1865); and this, with subsequent attacks, necessitated prolonged sick leave to Europe (1865–66, 1869–72, 1880–84), and thus broke up his continuous service In India and prevented his ever rising to the higher posts of the Department. Whilst in India he held at times some very good posts, e.g., Assistant to Chief Engineer and Assistant Secretary to Government in P.W.D in 1865, and again in 1868–69; Deputy Consulting Engineer for Railways 1876-80 and 1888–8, and Consulting Engineer, 1890. His sick leaves to Europe led, however, to his seeing a varied service, both in the field and otherwise, in parts of the world not usually open to the old Indian Engineer. Thus he was Assistant Field Engineer with the Abyssinian Expedition (i86-6S), was mentioned in despatches for \\"excellent service” and obtained the medal. After exchanging to home service in 1882 he was selected to project the Suakin-Berber Railway (1884); served as Director of Railways in Egypt in 1884; and was an A.A.G. with the Nile Expedition ( 1884–85 ) with which he advanced as far as Dongola being subsequently mentioned in despatches arid receiving the medal with clasp and star. After this he became C.R.R. at Devonport. (1885–86), and C.R.E. in S. Africa, 1886–88. After a further short period of service in India, as Consulting Engineer for Railways (1890–91), he retired in 1891 as a Lieut.- Colonel. After some years travel abroad he settled down on the small property of Dilkusha, of about 100 acres at Sestri Levante in Liguria, favourable to the growth of the olive, vine, orange, fig etc., :and busied himself thereafter in the improvement of their cultivation. He died there of heart complaint on the 5th October, 1905. He was twice married (first in 1872, again in 1897). By the first wife who died in 1893, he leaves two sons and two daughters. His second wife survives, and contributes most of the materials for this short biography. The two sons are still engaged in the improvement of their father's estate. Two instances of Clarke's versatility may be given. He was selected from those on the Nile Expeditions (1884) to determine the latitude and longitude of certain positions in the Nile valley, a work which would be assigned in India to the staff of the Indian Survey. Again, he had a strong taste for languages, so much so that in spite of prolonged absences from India - he became a competent Persian scholar, and was selected by the Bengal Asiatic Society as translator of part of the ‘Aini-i-Akbari, and was even a candidate for the chair of Persian at Oxford, 1880. He published, among other works, the following:—A \\"Persian Manual (1878), which was adopted by Government for the Indo-European Telegraph Staff. Translations into English prose of four of the great Persian poems:-1., The Bustán of Sadi (1879); 2. The Sikandar Nama-e-Nizámi (1881)800 pp.; 3. The Diwán-i- Háfiz (1891) 2 vols.; 4\\\\. The Sháh-Nama-e-Firdausi, 1000 pp. These volumes have received the warm appreciation of many scholars (including the late Sir H Rawlinson, Sir Monier Williams, and Prof. Max Muller), and form a lasting monument of the author’s talents and industry. It remains to record some personal traits. Clarke was rather short of stature, and of a genial, though somewhat combative disposition; a warm friend, and a good hitter-out (especially in writing) at an adversary. He was familiarly known among his intimates by the “pet” name of “Boxer”, and accordingly sometimes passed as “Mr. Boxer” among those who only knew him by this style; thus he was habitually called \\"Mr Boxer\\" by the old tar (familiarly known as \\"Ben” ) in charge of the RE. Boat Club boats (1860–62), much to the amusement of Clarke's companions. Clarke was very popular among the younger officers when he had himself become a senior. An amusing instance of this occurred after a big dinner at the Chatham Mess. After dinner was over (and the seniors had all left the table) there arose a call among the juniors present that Clarke should take the chair and deliver a speech (he being a good raconteur, and a humorous after-dinner speaker); as he was about to take his seat, the chair disappeared, and the would-be occupant subsided on the floor to find himself smothered in a shower of rose leaves. ALLAN CUNNINGHAM, Lt.-Col., late R.E. (Bengal). ==Personal life== He married Florence Lucy Hurt in 1872 at St James's Church, Westminster, London. After his wife's death he married Anna Elizabeth Pudney (1853–1938) on 7 Jan 1897 at Heybridge, Essex, England. Anna's parents were Quakers and pacifists so conversations with their son-in-law, a retired Lieutenant Colonel of the Bengal Engineers, may have been rigorous. He died in Italy on October 4, 1905 buried in Sestri Levante ==Hafez== Wilberforce Clarke was the author of a critical translation of The Dīvān of Hafez, printed at his expense at the Central Press of the Government of India, Calcutta (1889–1891) The work (1891) was presented as follows: : The Dīvān : written in the fourteenth century : by : Khwāja Shamsu-d-Dīn Muhammad-i-Hāfiz-i-Shīrāzī : otherwise known as : Lisānu-l-Ghaib and Tarjumānu-l-Asrār.

Byrd (T-AKE-4) is a Lewis and Clark-class dry cargo ship in the United States Navy. She is the second United States Navy ship to be named after polar explorer Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd (1888–1957). The contract to build her was awarded to National Steel and Shipbuilding Company (NASSCO) of San Diego, California, on 18 July 2003. She was launched from the building ways into the San Diego Bay on the evening of 15 May 2007; Bolling Byrd Clarke, Admiral Byrd's eldest daughter, broke the ceremonial bottle of champagne on the ship's bow to start the launch amid fireworks and fanfare. Construction continued until the U.S. Navy accepted her on 14 November 2007. Additional construction work continued until she was delivered to Military Sealift Command (MSC) for crewing and placed in service on 8 January 2008. She completed a fitting-out period as well as multiple operational inspections and trials, including a full INSURV inspection on 27 March 2008. A final period of modifications and design alterations was completed during a 70-day availability before full fleet introduction on 25 July 2008. The ship joined the Pacific Fleet and predominantly operates in the Far East and Indian Ocean operation areas. In May 2009, Richard E. Byrd was identified to conduct Pacific Partnership 2009 as a last minute replacement for the USS Dubuque (LPD-8), which was sidelined due to an outbreak of H1N1 virus. Pacific Partnership 2009 visited American Samoa, Tonga, New Caledonia, Kiribati (Tarawa), and the Marshall Islands from June to September. In the few weeks after being selected, the ship was outfitted with a quick-designed Reverse Osmosis Unit to make sufficient clean water while loitering in the remote waters and additional logistical items were brought aboard. Byrd embarked PHIBRON2 and staff, several NGOs, and allied partners during an at-sea transfer from USNS Amelia Earhart (T-AKE-6). This embarkation swelled the crew size to over 300 persons, requiring a USCG waiver. After completing the mission, the ship offloaded the embarked crew and Reverse Osmosis Unit and returned normal duties. One of those duties included providing Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief efforts to Padang, Indonesia, in October 2009. In March 2011 during Operation Tomodachi, Richard E. Byrd embarked SA-330J Puma helicopters airlifted hundreds of pallets of relief supplies to and landing dock ships and . Byrd completed 16 underway replenishment evolutions, delivering 210,000 gallons (800 m³) of fuel to Tomodachi-support ships. In August 2014, the ship rescued nine Yemeni sailors from their stricken dhow in the Sea of Oman. == References * * USS Richard E.

Retrieved on 2008-04-27. ==Career and life== Connors graduated from Pawtucket, Rhode Island West High School in 1958. Upon graduating he entered the United States Air Force which led him to his primary duty station in San Antonio, Texas. There, his career as a radio announcer began as a Program Director for the Armed Forces Radio Network. He also held numerous other billets during his time served. Connors was assigned to President John F. Kennedy's special communications team in the Florida Keys, which directly aided in the Cuban blockade, during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. WJET Erie, Pennsylvania was his first official radio job outside of duties performed in the U.S. Air Force. At WJET, he held the title of Production Director for WJET Radio & WJET-TV channel 24. Initially, he was the midday host for WJET and was rated #1 in the market ahead of the morning drive team. It wasn't long before JC was promoted to the morning drive shift. While in Erie, JC met his first wife and had two children, although his marriage eventually failed. After a long run at WJET, Connors was hired at one of the largest stations in the country, WMEX in Boston, Massachusetts, where he was the Music Director and morning drive host. His daily program was consistently rated #1 in the New England marketplace in the early 1970s. He earned thirteen Gold Records during his tenure for discovering artists and promoting their music. Connors and Harry Chapin became friends, and JC helped launch Chapin's career. Foster Brooks and Connors befriended each other during this time as well. This friendship, and similar style of humor, would be a talking point for the two men for years to come. JC earned the majority of his gold records while working at WMEX. The gold record JC was most proud of: Chuck Berry's \\"My Ding-a-ling.\\" Discovering and pushing this song in the United States was dear to JC because Chuck Berry was a childhood icon of his. After having great success in Boston, and becoming nationally renowned by many record executives for his programming and promotional abilities, JC moved towards Erie, Pennsylvania to be closer to his children from his first marriage. The impact of Chapin's song \\"W*O*L*D\\" hit his ex-wife hard, as the local 'Jocks' in Erie would often take their shots at him and his life on air. Soon he found an opening at WYSL in Buffalo, New York, where he could be closer to his children while working through some family concerns. Connors was the morning Drive host in Buffalo, and his program was nationally rated #5 by Arbitron, which was quite a substantial feat, considering Buffalo was ranked only 26th in the nation at that time. JC had great success in Western New York, and on WYSL he frequently featured many of the well-known performers with whom he had connections. While in Buffalo, JC met his second wife, and the couple would find out they were pregnant with their first of two children shortly before moving to Rochester, New York for a job at WROC. At WROC, he was Operations Manager & morning Drive Host. He also made multiple appearances for WROC-TV weather, as the company worked through the largest media strike in Rochester's history. He left WROC and moved back to New England during this time due to the death of his father. After the passing of his father, JC wanted to be back in New England with the rest of his family. He was offered a position with WCIB in Falmouth, Massachusetts and Cape Cod, Massachusetts where he was appointed Vice President of Operations and morning Drive Host, with multiple levels of on-air production responsibility. After a fairly decent run at WCIB, JC moved on to WBSM in New Bedford, Massachusetts as the Morning Drive Host, with on-air radio production & copy writing. While at WBSM his second marriage fell apart. He moved on to another market and started over again. Shortly after his second divorce, he moved away from Massachusetts for a position with WKRI in West Warwick, Rhode Island as the Morning Drive entertainer. His career in the northeastern United States soon came to an end, as he packed up and headed for another new beginning, on the Gulf Coast of Florida.

The word is from the Latin, complete. Thus, the word appears in a work about the life of Robert Aldrich, Bishop of Carlisle (Baluze, \\"Miscell.\\", I, iii, 29) in reference to what seems to be a book of church rents (Binterim, \\"Denkwurdigkeiten\\", IV, i, 239). The entire office, or series of prayers and psalms said (or chanted) in the Roman Catholic Church — Vespers, Matins, Lauds and Mass — is called plenarium. A complete copy of the four Gospel Books was called an evangeliarium plenarium (as distinct from an Evangeliary or evangeliarium, a kind of Lectionary, which contains only pericopes or selections). Under this heading is classed the Book of Gospels at Lichfield Cathedral and the Book of Gospels given by Athelstan to Christ Church in Canterbury, now in the library of Lambeth Palace (Rock, \\"Church of our Fathers\\", I, 122). Some plenaria included all the writings of the New Testament, others those parts of the scriptures that were commonly read in the Mass and bore the name Lectionarium Plenarium (Becker, \\"Catal. bibl. ant.\\", 1885, 28, no. 237; 68, no. 650, 659). In monasteries, the use of several books for each service created not great problem; but priests who did not make the Benedictine religious profession of \\"stability, conversion of manners and obedience\\" and who travelled from place to place on their missionary duties, found it best to carry a single book with them, and the complete missal or Missale Plenarium came into use among them, especially after the foundation of the mendicant orders. Early vestiges of that missal date to the ninth century, and by the eleventh or twelfth century the Missale Plenarium was widespread. It contained all necessary prayers for the celebration of the Mass, which until then had to be taken from different books — the Sacramentary, Lectionary, Evangelistary, Antiphonary, and Gradual (Zaccaria, \\"Bibl. rit.\\", I [Rome, 1876], 50). In Germany, plenarium denoted a popular book that gave the German translation of the Epistles and Gospels for the Sundays and festivals of the entire liturgical year, together with a short exposition and instruction. Later editions added the Introit, Gradual, and other parts of the Mass. The last book of the kind bearing the title plenarium was printed in 1522 at Basle.Catholic Encyclopedia: Plenarium ==References * Category:Christian terminology Category:Christian genres ","title":"Plenarium"},{"id":"6196660","text":"Wai Ka-Fai is a Hong Kong screenwriter, producer, film director, and former TV screenwriter and producer.

The small blue temple in front of the gate is saint Chokhamela's memorial (samadhi). Chokhamela was a saint in Maharashtra, India in the 14th century. He belonged to the Mahar caste, one of the untouchable caste in India. He was born at Mehuna Raja, a village in Deulgaon Raja Taluka of Buldhana district. He lived at Mangalvedha in Maharashtra. He wrote many Abhangas. He was one of the first low-cast poets in India. Chokhamela lived with his wife Soyarabai and son Karmamela in Mangalvedha.

His family also followed varkari sect. * Soyarabai - Wife * Nirmala - Sister and her husband Banka (who is brother of Soyarabai) * Karmamela - Son He was initiated into bhakti spirituality by the poet-saint Namdev (1270-1350). Once when he visited Pandharpur, he listened to Sant Namdev's kirtan. Already a devotee of Vitthal alias Vithoba, Chokha was moved by Namdev's teachings. Later, he moved to Pandharpur. The traditional story is that the upper castes here did not allow him to enter the temple, nor did they allow him to stand in the door of the temple, so he instead built a hut on the other side of the river Chandrabhaga. While working on construction of a wall in Mangalvedha, near Pandharpur, the wall fell down, crushing some workers. Chokha was one of them. His tomb is in front of the Vitthal temple, Pandharpur, where it can be seen to this day. According to a legend the bones of the dead Chokhamela were still chanting Vitthal , Vitthal, apparently yearning to visit the Vitthal temple. The bones were buried at the footsteps of the Vitthal temple. In early 20th century, the Dalit leader B. R.

It was the first production bus design to have no step up from the passenger entrance throughout the lower deck, although Gilford and Leyland Motors had developed low floor city buses in the 1930s, these did not enter production. ==Design and development== The point of its design and introduction was to end the uncomfortable and inconvenient Lowbridge double-deck bus layout, replacing it by lowering the chassis frame and integrating it with the body, and fitting a drop-centre rear axle, so that there were no steps from the rear entrance platform to the front of the passenger gangway, itself sunk about 10 cm (4 inches) below the seating platforms on the LDX, LD and first five LDLs. A full flat floor was developed on the last LDL, then used on the LDS and the F series Lodekkas. Bristol Commercial Vehicles, Eastern Coach Works and some of their employees obtained a number of patents relating to the design. Bristol manufactured over 5,200 Lodekkas from 1949 to 1968, as a standard double-deck vehicle for the UK state-owned bus sector. With all examples bodied by Eastern Coach Works in Lowestoft, they have a traditional half-cab design and a lower floor level allowing a low overall height. The earlier LD-series and the later FL and FS had a rear platform, but the FSF and FLF had a forward (behind the front axle and driver's position, rather than 'front' ahead of the front axle and alongside the driver) entrance. Most were powered by 5 or 6-cylinder Gardner engines, with fewer having a Bristol or Leyland power unit. An engineering option was designed to reduce the power loss due to engine radiator fan operation and to increase the heat available for heating of the passengers. After experiments by Wing-Commander T.R. Cave-Browne-Cave (CBC), Professor of Engineering at Southampton University, a satisfactory design was produced. The 'CBC' system involved two small engine radiators being placed above the driver's cab roof level at the front outer corners of the double deck to give maximum aerodynamic air flow. The engine coolant water was pumped around these instead of the traditional radiator. In cold weather, all or a portion of the air passing through these radiators, was diverted by flaps, the left into the upper saloon and the right to the lower deck. In hot weather, the flaps could be changed by push-pull levers in the driver's cab roof to divert all the hot air to the outside of the vehicle. The movement of the vehicle was (usually) adequate to cool the engine without the need for a fan or radiator at the traditional position in front of the engine. The traditional 'radiator' grille at the front of the vehicle was not required, but was usually retained (with a few exceptionsphoto of OPN 801 with no conventional grille) and blanked off behind. 'Varivane' wax capsule operated shutters were fitted in front of the upper radiators to keep the coolant at optimum temperature. There were some disadvantages to the scheme and eventually customers stopped specifying it. The first prototype vehicle (chassis no. LDX001) was operated by Bristol Tramways & Carriage Company Ltd Ltd who designed and made the chassis at its 'MCW' (Motor Constructional Works) which at that time was still an integral part of the company. It was allocated fleet no. LC5000 and registered LHY 949. There is a story that the first vehicle originally had two separate propshafts, one to each side rear wheel with the differential at the front of the vehicle. This was soon changed to incorporate the differential into the off-side gear train - a concept still used today by several international bus manufacturers. West Yorkshire Road Car Company had the second prototype Lodekka (chassis no. LDX002), originally fleet number 822 but renumbered DX1 under the April 1954 renumbering scheme, registered JWT 712, which operated in the Harrogate area and lacked the distinctively stylish fairing of the production models. This was displayed at the Festival of Britain (South Bank Exhibition) in 1951. Lodekka users in the UK included: Brighton Hove & District, Bristol, Crosville, Cumberland, Eastern Counties, Eastern National, Hants & Dorset, Lincolnshire Road Car, Red & White Services, Scottish Omnibuses, Southern Vectis, South Wales, Luton & District, Thames Valley & Aldershot, United, United Counties, United Welsh, West Yorkshire Roadcar Co, Western National, Western Welsh, Central SMT and Wilts & Dorset. Whilst no Lodekkas were bought by any London based companies, they often worked into the capital on services operated by Thames Valley and Eastern National. With the arrival of more modern \\"OMO\\" or one person operated buses, such as the Leyland Atlantean and Bristol VRT (the Lodekka's successor), many Lodekkas found themselves relegated to driver training duties. The urgency with which the National Bus Company wanted to convert operations to one man operated double deck vehicles led to the unusual exchange of 91 Lodekkas of the newest FLF type with a similar number of older Bristol VRT (rear engined and front entrance suitable for one man operation) double decks from the Scottish Bus Group which was keen to have the more reliable older design. The exchange took place at the Carlisle (Willowholme) depot of Ribble Motor Services. The Bristol Lodekka was also manufactured by Dennis under licence, and was sold as the Dennis Loline. This arrangement was necessary because the Bristol company was prohibited by law from selling its products at the time to anyone other than similar government owned undertakings. The design, though, was attractive to other operators, so this arrangement allowed them to purchase vehicles to the same design. Sometimes the Bristol Lodekka can be offered as an open-top bus. == Chassis codes == convertible open-top bus. Now in service with Cumbria Classic Coaches. In accordance with Bristol Commercial Vehicles practice, chassis were designated by a two or three letter code, followed by the number of engine cylinders and engine manufacturer. : LDX: Low 'Decker, Experimental (the first two LD vehicles) : LD: Low 'Decker : LDL: Low 'Decker, Long (Essentially pre-production FL models - introduced when the maximum legal length of double deck buses was extended from to .

In the early 1990s, Surrey based \\"Leisurelink\\" used a former Southern Vectis example (MDL 954) on a weekend-only tourist service, linking Gatwick Zoo (now closed), Gatwick Airport and the Bluebell Railway. Some overseas operators acquired second-hand Bristol Lodekkas from the UK for further service. For example, Fok Lei Autocarro S.A of Macau operated a small number of Lodekkas between the 1970s and late 1980s.http://www.ssfoto.net/mob.html Citybus of Hong Kong operated one example in 1980s. The Lodekka Double Decker Dress Shop in Portland, Oregon A Bristol Lodekka serves coffee in Salem, Oregon A charter/limousine company named Double Decker PDX in Portland, OR operates a refurbished Bristol Lodekka. A bakery in Saratoga Springs, NY, named Bettie's Cakes, operates a Lodekka as a Double Decker Cupcake Stand affectionately named DeeDee. A number of Lodekkas were used during the 1970s by the British engineering consortium Atomic Power Construction (APC) for transporting workers to and from work during the building and running of Dungeness A and Dungeness B nuclear power stations. ==Popular culture== In popular culture, Bristol Lodekkas featured extensively in the early-1970s London Weekend Television series On the Buses, with actor Reg Varney driving and Bob Grant his conductor. One of these Lodekkas has been preserved. A Hungry Horse pub named The Lodekka stands near the former site of the Bristol Commercial Vehicles factory. == See also == * List of buses == References == Lodekka Category:Buses of the United Kingdom Category:Double-decker buses Category:Half-cab buses Category:Low-floor buses Category:Open-top buses ","title":"Bristol Lodekka"},{"id":"6196754","text":"Memorain is a speed/groove/thrash metal band from Greece, formed by guitarist/vocalist Ilias Papadakis in 1999. ==History== After a few lineup changes in 2001, the band recorded their first demo CD titled \\"Until You Die\\". Drawing influence mainly from the American Heavy/Thrash scene, the band contributed a song for the \\"Voices Of Death Part 5\\" compilation album and a few months later they paid tribute to one of their favorite bands, Megadeth, recording a cover version of the song \\"Disconnect\\" for the album Droogie - A Megadeth Tribute. In August 2002, the band signed a two-record deal with local label NMC Music, and their first album \\"Digital Crimes\\" was released a couple of months later. In 2003, Memorain released their second album White Line, featuring guitarist James Murphy (Testament, Obituary, Death, etc.). The band also contributed songs to numerous compilation albums. In September 2003, the band composed the music theme for Greece's premier metal TV show, \\"TV War\\", a TV show supported by the Greek Metal Hammer Magazine. In September 2005, Memorain signed an exclusive contract with EMI Greece and two months later the band started recording their new album \\"Reduced To Ashes\\" with Nick Menza (ex- Megadeth) on drums and Jeff Waters (Annihilator), as a special guest. Recorded partially in Los Angeles-California \\"Reduced To Ashes\\" was released by EMI Music Greece on 17 April 2006. After a 5-year gap, the band re-entered the studio in 2011 with a new line-up featuring Ralph Santolla, Chris Valagao, Steve DiGiorgio and Gene Hoglan to record its fourth full-length album called \\"Evolution\\", which was released in 2012. In the following year, Memorain with a new lineup, released an 8-track album that included re-recordings of songs from their first two official albums called \\"Digital line\\" and their sevenths studio release called \\"Seven Sacrifices\\".

In this context, obreption and subreption belong together. The Latin word for subreption is \\"subreptio\\", the German is \\"Erschleichung\\". In German philosophy, the concept was used by Christian Wolff (philosopher) and Immanuel Kant to denounce illegitimate claims to empiricity of representations: I can perceive the formation of my will to lift my arm, and I can perceive the lifting of my arm. To say that I know empirically that my will lifted my arm would be a subreption in Wolff's sense. The Latin phrase for the philosophical concept of subreption is vitium subreptionis (vitium: fault, crime, error; subreptionis: creep, stealth, fraud). The German is a literal translation of this Latin phrase: \\"Fehler der Erschleichung\\". It can also mean in general a creeping or tacit assumption(s) that is not explicitly given but is hidden either purposefully (as in sophistry) or not (as in a visual illusion). ==References== * Obreption and Subreption With links to the Catholic Encyclopedia (1913) * Category:Roman law Category:Age of Enlightenment ","title":"Subreption"},{"id":"6196858","text":"Bruce Hungerford (24 November 192226 January 1977), known for the majority of his career as Leonard Hungerford, was an Australian pianist whose career was cut short by his death in a road accident in New York. ==Biography== Born in Korumburra, Victoria, Bruce Hungerford was originally named Leonard Sinclair Hungerford. In an undated manuscript he recounts \\"When it came to naming me my parents were torn between 'Bruce' and 'Leonard.' I think they really wanted Bruce, but I was such a puny specimen that they hardly felt I fitted the name of the Warrior King of Scotland. Then a day or two before I was to be christened, my grandfather journeyed down to see me. He was a Scotsman to the backbone and after taking one look at me said sadly, \\"This is no 'Bruce', and so the die was cast, at any rate for my first 35 years\\". It was only in 1965 that Leonard Hungerford changed his professional name to Bruce Hungerford. From the age of 12, Hungerford studied piano at the University of Melbourne Conservatorium with Roy Shepherd, a student of Alfred Cortot. At 17, he won a full scholarship to the Conservatorium, and made his debut at age 20 with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.Udini In February 1940 he was broadcast on radio station, 3UL, performing \\"Brahms 'Intermezzo' opus 117 No 2 and Liszt's 'Hungarian Rhapsody No 6'.\\" The Argus reporter caught a joint recital by Hungerford and two associates, in August 1944; the reporter opined that \\"[he] made the deepest impression. He has progressed far since his earlier efforts at students' concerts and the concerto festival. His playing of the Schubert 'Sonata in A' showed evidence of careful study and an appreciation of his composer, as well as an effective technique.\\" In 1944 he studied for a short time with Ignaz Friedman in Sydney. His playing impressed the conductor Eugene Ormandy, who suggested he study with Olga Samaroff in Philadelphia. He also received coaching and advice from Myra Hess, who suggested he study with Carl Friedberg, in whom he finally found a teacher who suited him. On the advice of Samaroff (who had died in 1948), he moved to Germany in 1958 with the intention of establishing himself on the concert scene in Europe. It was at this point that he changed his name to Bruce Hungerford. The 1960 Bayreuth Festival Master Classes, Inc. – LO8P-5179 issue of Richard Wagner's complete piano works was credited to Bruce Hungerford. In 1967, Hungerford was approached by Maynard and Seymour Solomon, the founders and directors of the Vanguard Recording Society, to record the complete piano works of Beethoven. Hungerford moved to the United States, and combined a reduced concert schedule with a teaching appointment in Mannes College of Music. The recording project was to remain incomplete. On 26 January 1977 in New York City at the age of 54, Hungerford was killed in a road accident, a head-on collision caused by a drunk driver. His mother, his niece and her husband were also killed in the accident. He left a legacy of nine all-Beethoven records and one record each of works by Brahms, Chopin, and Schubert on the Vanguard label. He also recorded the works of Wagner for piano, issued by the DDR label, Eterna. In addition to his musical accomplishments, Hungerford was a keen palaeontologist, and studied vertebrate palaeontology at Columbia University and at the Museum of Natural History in New York. He also had a passionate interest in Egyptology. This, and his skill as a photographer, led to his making six research trips to Egypt, the first in 1961 as still photographer on the NBC River Nile Expedition. ==References *, WNCN-FM, 29 January 1982 *, WNCN-FM, 4 February 1977 *, WNCN-FM, 4 February 1977 Category:Australian classical pianists Category:Male classical pianists Category:1922 births Category:1977 deaths Category:Road incident deaths in New York City Category:20th-century classical pianists Category:20th-century classical musicians Category:20th-century Australian musicians Category:People from Korumburra Category:20th-century male musicians ","title":"Bruce Hungerford"},{"id":"6196864","text":"Wikipe-tan, a combination of the Japanese word for Wikipedia and the friendly suffix for children, , is a moe anthropomorph of Wikipedia. is a form of anthropomorphism in anime and manga where moe qualities are given to non-human beings (such as animals, plants, supernatural entities and fantastical creatures), objects, concepts, or phenomena. In addition to moe features, moe anthropomorphs are also characterized by their accessories, which serve to emphasize their original forms before anthropomorphosis. The characters here, usually in a kind of cosplay, are drawn to represent an inanimate object or popular consumer product. Part of the humor of this personification comes from the personality ascribed to the character (often satirical) and the sheer arbitrariness of characterizing a variety of machines, objects, and even physical places as cute. This form of anthropomorphism is very common in otaku subcultures. With the exception of kemonomimi (which are human-like characters that have animal features), many moe anthropomorphizations started as dōjin efforts. An early form of moe anthropomorphism is the Gundam MS Girl created by Mika Akitaka in 1982. Many anthropomorphizations were the results of discussions on Japanese Internet forums such as 2channel or Futaba Channel. The trend spread out of dōjin circles as commercial anime and manga also prominently feature characters who are personifications of inanimate objects. ==Sociological aspects== The media studies scholar Yuji Sone has argued that since moe anthropomorphism is usually personified by beautiful young girls, it is an example of the outgrowth of otaku subcultural habitus into sexual fantasies. The psychologist Tamaki Saitō regards moe anthropomorphism as an example of mitate-e art due to its simultaneous use of both high and low art to provide additional, sometimes humorous, meanings. ==Types== nekomimi, a type of kemonomimi with the ears of a cat. ===Animals=== Kemonomimi, literally meaning \\"animal ears\\", is the concept of depicting human and human- like characters with animal ears, and by extension, other features such as tails. Kemonomimi is often used in moe anthropomorphism, to depict animal characters in human form. Catgirls and catboys are the most prolific in this category, although bunnygirls, foxgirls, doggirls, and wolfgirls are also common. Kemonomimi characters typically appear human except for added animal- like qualities. A notable franchise featuring moe anthropomorphism and kemonomimi is Kemono Friends, which is focused on a myriad of anthropomorphized animals in the form of girls and young women, ranging from real animals to cryptids and legendary creatures. Another notable series is Uma Musume Pretty Derby which focuses on girls as famous Japanese racehorses. ===Mythological and fantasy creatures=== When moe appearances are given to typically frightening and hideous monsters from folklore, mythology, and fantasy, they are usually called monster girls (or sometimes boys). Their bestial traits may be fully retained, de-emphasized into mere personality tics, or removed altogether. An early example of this is with the video game series Touhou Project beginning in 1997 which depicts yōkai and various mythical beings as cute and beautiful girls and women with supernatural powers. It was further popularized by such manga as Monster Musume and A Centaur's Life, and has grown into its own genre. Rarely, the monster girls are relatively unchanged from their original form and personality, such as mermaids and centaurides. The fan-created Bowsette, a gender-swapped and moe anthropomorphized version of the Mario antagonist Bowser that gives him the appearance of Princess Peach via the \\"Super Crown\\" powerup, became one of the most popular Internet memes of 2018. The popularity of the character later led to other Mario enemies being given moe interpretations, the most prominent of which was Boosette (based on the King Boo character). ===Computers=== Although Chobits (2001) and Toy's iMac Girl (1998) came first, the meme of turning computer-related phenomena into moe subjects did not start until , the anthropomorphization of Internet Explorer's Stop button. The idea of Shiitake- chan came in 2001 on 2channel, starting with a poster who claims he saw the Stop button as a shiitake. When Microsoft released Windows 7 in Japan, they included a theme pack centered around a personification of the OS named \\"Nanami Madobe\\" with voice samples from Nana Mizuki. Microsoft used another personification involving two girls named \\"Yū Madobe\\" and \\"Ai Madobe\\" to promote Windows 8 in Japan. As part of the market launch, a Facebook draw of 8 followers took place when follower count reaches 80001; and total Twitter follower count for Yū and Ai reach 8001, where winners receive Madobe Yū and Ai-themed prizes. Since the creation of the OS-tans, other software and websites have been anthropomorphized as well. For example, Wikipedia has its own \\"Wikipe-tan\\", while Mozilla applications have their own set of \\"Moezilla\\". Chinese netizens have created a \\"Green Dam Girl\\" to parody China's content- control software Green Dam Youth Escort. In 2010, Taiwanese illustrator known as \\"shinia\\" on Pixiv created a personification of Microsoft Silverlight named Hikaru Aizawa, who is officially promoted by Microsoft Taiwan. In 2013, Microsoft Singapore introduced Inori Aizawa, a mascot for Internet Explorer. The manga and anime series World War Blue features characters who are personifications of computer games. Video games with characters based on them include Sonic the Hedgehog, Super Mario and Tetris. Sega Hard Girls features personifications of video game hardware by Sega. ===Law and politics=== ISIS- chan is the moe anthropomorphism of ISIL. Elements of the Japanese constitution have been anthropomorphized into moe girls, such as Article 9, which prevents Japan from waging war, \\"is portrayed as a peace-loving girl.\\" In 2010, users from the Breaking News board on 2channel created Hinomoto Oniko as an anthropomorphism of the commonly used Chinese ethnic slur used against Japanese, Riben guizi (日本鬼子), literally meaning \\"Japanese devils\\". The character was made by the 2channel community in response to the growing anti- Japanese sentiment amongst Chinese netizens online, and has since become an Internet meme within Japanese imageboards and forums. In Japanese, the kun'yomi reading of the kanji which make up the racial slur can be interpreted as a female personal name, and so the character is depicted as a young female wearing a traditional Japanese kimono, along with devil horns and a katana. In 2015, Internet users created \\"ISIS-chan\\", a moe anthropomorphized character of the jihadist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). Images of her have been used by Anonymous to dilute the Islamic State's online propaganda. ===Others=== Other things have also been given moe characteristics: ;Cells: The manga Cells at Work! depicts the cells of the human body as both male and female characters. ;Charcoal: Based on binchōtan and other types of charcoal, the anime and manga Binchō-tan uses the dajare in the Japanese word for to create a series of cute girls. ;Countries:As with national personifications, moe versions of various countries are present. For example, Japan is Nihon- chan, Afghanistan is Afuganisu-tan—both have their own webcomics in Japan. Beyond these, however, are the countries of Hidekaz Himaruya's Hetalia: Axis Powers, a manga depicting the countries involved in World War I and World War II using mostly men with only a few women mixed in. ;Diseases:During the 2014 Western African Ebola virus epidemic, a user of the website 4chan created an image depicting a moe version of Ebola. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a moe version of the Coronavirus disease 2019 named Corona-chan was created. A Hong Kong Tram vehicle with the livery of a moe anthropomorphized character of a local soy sauce brand ;Food and beverages: Habanero-tan, the unofficial mascot of Bōkun Habanero; and Bisuke-tan for biscuits that KFC sells in Japan. The light novel series Akikan! has soda cans that magically turn into girls. Jelly flavors have also been anthropomorphized. ;Historic eras: A series of Japanese history books features anthropomorphism of historic events. ;Home appliances: Erotic computer games Like Life and Monogokoro, Monomusume both feature home appliances as girls. These appliances include washing machines, alarm clocks, blackboard erasers, pillows, first aid boxes, mobile phones, and even post boxes, among others. The very nature of such games, however, puts the main characters in unusual situations when the sex scene happens—such as essentially \\"having sex with the washing machine\\". Likewise, the manga 090 Eko to Issho features girls who are mobile phones. ;Military hardware: Mecha Musume are anthropomorphic personifications of military hardware, such as guns, tanks, ships, aircraft or even missiles. Popular subjects of this kind of anthropomorphism include World War II military vehicles; collectible mecha musume figures of these vehicles have been released. Moe anthropomorphisms of historical military ships as girls and young women (\\"ship girls\\") are also notable, as popularized by Kantai Collection and Azur Lane. ;Vehicles: Notable trains who were drawn as girls include the Fastech 360, often drawn with cat ears because of the train's emergency air braking plates. Called \\"Fastech- tan\\", this particular \\"train girl\\" has its own collectible figure, sold with permission from the East Japan Railway Company. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *.

Miyares became the President of the Christian Democratic Party of Cuba in 1990 and wrote the party's manifesto \\"Models for a Peaceful Transition in Cuba\\". ==Biography== Miyares gained a PhD in Political Science at the Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. He then became a Professor of Political Science at Benedictine University in Lisle, Illinois. In 1970, He became founder and President of Market and Advertising Research, Inc. and became a creative director of many advertising campaigns aimed at the Hispanic market in the United States. ===Television=== In 1978, Miyares became the general partner in Hispanic American Television–Chicago, which was one of several applicants for a new TV station on channel 60 in Chicago. Hispanic American Television merged with a competing applicant for the channel, Aurora-Chicago Telecasters, to form HATCO-60, which in turn negotiated a settlement with Metrowest Corporation, headed by Fred Eychaner, to share the channel with its proposed station. In April 1982, the two stations signed on—Eychaner's WPWR-TV and HATCO-60's WBBS-TV. WBBS-TV broadcast Spanish-language programming from 7 p.m. to 2:30 a.m., while WPWR broadcast its English-language independent fare from 2:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Miyares and Eychaner were involved in negotiating a contract for both halves of channel 60 that brought it SportsVision, a subscription service featuring several Chicago professional sports teams. WBBS programming featured an array of novelas, variety shows and locally produced programs. The locally produced programs focused on community events, as well as weekly specialty programs such as, \\"Esta Semana en Baseball\\" hosted by John Morales and the video music show, Imagen, hosted by Chicago radio veteran, Rey Mena. In 1984, WBBS-TV gained notoriety by introducing the teen heart-throb group, Menudo, to Chicago, which included a young Ricky Martin. WBBS-TV's market panorama changed drastically when WSNS affiliated with the Spanish International Network, triggering a realignment of Spanish-language television in Chicago that saw channel 60 lose much of its programming. WBBS ended weekday programming at the end of 1985, with the exception of weekends, when it ran Spanish movies into 1986. In early 1986, Eychaner bought the WBBS license for $11 million, allowing WPWR to go full-time. Marcelino Miyares was also Founder and President of Times Square Studios) which produced such shows as the Montel Williams. Since 1995 he has presided as President of MM Communications, a consultancy of mass media projects in the Americas, with offices in Miami and Panama. ==See also== *Opposition to Fidel Castro *Political parties in Cuba *WPWR-TV ==References *Biography Category:Opposition to Fidel Castro Category:Leaders of political parties in Cuba Category:Northwestern University alumni Category:Benedictine University faculty Category:Living people Category:1937 births ","title":"Marcelino Miyares Sotolongo"},{"id":"6196888","text":"Ratner's was a famous Jewish kosher dairy (milkhik) restaurant on the Lower East Side of New York City. Since it did not serve meat in deference to the kosher prohibition against mixing milk and meat products, it was often regarded as a complement to Katz's Deli. ==Ownership== Ratner's was founded in 1905 by Jacob Harmatz and his brother-in-law Alex Ratner, who supposedly flipped a coin to decide whose name would be on the sign.Kosher History , accessed December 5, 2006 Ratner sold his share in the restaurant to Harmatz in 1918, and it remained in the Harmatz family from then on. Jacob's son, Harold Harmatz, took over the business in the mid-1950s, dying a year after the restaurant ceased operation in 2002.\\"Ratner's Closes, For the Last Time,\\" LowerManhattan.Info. Dated December 16, 2004; retrieved August 25, 2006. ==Menu== A batch of onion rolls made with the recipe in The World-Famous Ratner's Meatless Cookbook. Brunch was the main meal at the dairy restaurant, and up to 1,200 people were served daily at the peak of its popularity. Noted menu items included cheese blintzes, potato pancakes (latkes), hot onion rolls, and split-pea soup. Other key items were gefilte fish, poached salmon- in-aspic, kasha varnishkes, and vegetable borsht. Many recipes survive in print. According to The World-Famous Ratner's Meatless Cookbook, the winner and undisputed champion at Ratner's was its famous onion rolls, which were featured on every table with every meal. More than fifteen hundred onion rolls were baked daily, three thousand on Sundays. ==Locations== The original location was on Pitt Street in Manhattan, but the restaurant moved in 1918 to its better-known location at 138 Delancey Street, where it remained until its closing. There was also a location at 111 Second Avenue, operated by other members of the family. Until 1975, it was open 24 hours a day and therefore part of the late-night city scene popular with Jewish performers, actors, musicians, and gangsters. Entertainers Bill Graham, Al Jolson, Fanny Brice, Marty Allen, Eydie Gormé, Walter Matthau, Elia Kazan, Max Gordon, Groucho Marx, and Alan King were all regular customers, while gangsters Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky frequented the Delancey Street location.\\"Ratner's Closes, For the Last Time,\\" LowerManhattan.Info. Dated December 16, 2004; retrieved August 25, 2006. Before the Delancey Street location closed, a back room opened as a bar called \\"Lansky's Lounge,\\" named after the deceased gangster, who, according to Robert Harmatz, told the owners he was there so often that he deserved to have his own room. The lounge has since closed as well, though another bar continues to exist in the space.The Back Room There was also a Ratner's soup cart that operated on only on weekdays and served a selection of meatless soups.

The Ratner's located at 111 Second Avenue, run by Abraham Harmatz, surpassed the Delancey Street restaurant in popularity for many years, especially during the late 1960s and early 1970s when the part of the Lower East Side that is above Houston Street gradually became known as the East Village—a hip and creative Mecca.

The prefix, Ob- means \\"towards, against, or, in the way of\\"; Sub- means \\"under, or, close to\\") are terms used in ancient Roman law and in the canon law applied by the Catholic church to species of fraud by which an ecclesiastical rescript is obtained. ==Legal requirements== Dispensations or graces are not granted unless there be some motive for requesting them, and the law of the Church requires that the true and just causes that lie behind the motive be stated in every prayer for such dispensation or grace. When the petition contains a statement about facts or circumstances that are supposititious or at least, modified if they really exist, the resulting rescript is said to be vitiated by obreption, which consists in a positive allegation of what is false. If, on the other hand, silence had been observed concerning something that essentially changed the state of the case, the concealment or suppression of statements or facts that according to law or usage should be expressed in an application or petition for a rescript is called subreption. Rescripts obtained by obreption or subreption are null and void when the motive cause of the rescript is affected by them. If it is only the impelling cause, and the substance of the petition is not affected, or if the false statement was made through ignorance, the rescript is not vitiated. As requests for rescripts must come through a person in ecclesiastical authority, it is his duty to inform himself of the truth or falsity of the causes alleged in the petitions, and in case they are granted, to see that the conditions of the rescript are fulfilled. In its effects subreption is equivalent to obreption. Subreption may be intentional and malicious, or attributable solely to ignorance or inadvertence. It may affect the primary, substantial reason or motive of the grant, or constitute merely a secondary or impellent cause of the concession. ==Other uses of \\"obreption\\"== Obreption is a term used in Roman, Canon and Scots Law. The word Obreption has been described in on-line dictionaries with many meanings other than Canon law.

A pair of white marble monuments in the cemetery to the Ryan family The major industry in the town is the limestone open-cut mine. The Galong deposit was first mined in 1885 with significant mining activity in the 1920s producing burnt lime or quicklime, which is used in the production of cement. The mine re-opened in the 1960s and again in 1994. In 2001, the lease was altered to extend the mineable area of land from ; resources of 20 million tonnes of limestone have been defined within the proposed limit of mining. In 2003, the mine was acquired by Boral. It now produces lime for agricultural lime used for farming canola and grains; agricultural lime is used for remediating soil acidity, a major problem threatening the productivity and sustainability of agriculture in many parts of the state. It produces approximately 300,000 tons per year, about one quarter of the requirements for the state of New South Wales. Apart from agricultural purposes, a major consumer of lime from Galong is the Port Kembla steel works. A kiln was built at the mine in 2003/04 to allow the production of quicklime for use in cement. The mine employs about 19 people. ==History== Squatter and former Irish convict 'Ned' Ryan took up land in the area around 1830 and built Galong House.Shamrock in the Bush: History; M.

The event was seen live on pay-per-view in the United States, and later released on home video. ==History== The event featured a four-man Middleweight Tournament, three Heavyweight Superfights, an alternate bout in case of tournament injury, and a Heavyweight \\"exhibition\\" bout. A Middleweight Championship bout between Frank Shamrock and Jeremy Horn was also taped for broadcast on a later pay-per-view. UFC 17 was the last UFC event (aside from UFC 23), to feature the \\"tournament\\" style format. Several hours prior to the event, Olympic Gold medalist and UFC commentator Jeff Blatnick was introduced as the promotion's commissioner in a meeting with the fighters to discuss the fight rules for the event. Blatnick asked at the meeting that the fighters refer to the sport, which at the time had many different names including the misnomer \\"No Holds Barred\\", as Mixed Martial Arts, with the intention of improving the sport's image. He then repeated the request to the media covering the event later that night. This is generally considered the first time the term Mixed Martial Arts was used to refer to the modern sport, and Blatnick is widely credited with coining the term in relation to it. UFC 17 featured the first UFC appearance of both Dan Henderson and Carlos Newton, as well as the first MMA fight for Chuck Liddell. The title Redemption refers to Mark Coleman's return after losing the UFC Heavyweight Title to Maurice Smith at UFC 14. Coleman was originally slated to face then UFC Heavyweight Champion Randy Couture, who had to withdraw due to an injury. Lion's Den fighter Pete Williams would step in as a last-minute replacement to face Coleman. Similar to his fight with Maurice, Coleman looked good early on in the fight, but when the fight went into an overtime round, Coleman appeared to be drained of energy, breathing heavily and keeping his arms low—even turning his back to Williams occasionally while standing. He took several hard shots from Williams, and was eventually knocked out by a devastating head kick Williams delivered to the face. The Coleman/Couture matchup would finally take place 12 years later at UFC 109, with Couture winning by submission. ==ResultsUFC 17 Middleweight Tournament Bracket See also == * Ultimate Fighting

After a year in an orphanage, he went to live with his Aunt Lily Von Schmidt, an artist in her own right, and her second husband, Major Charles Lee Tilden, who had been a forty-niner, and founder of Tilden Park in Alameda County. As a youth, von Schmidt worked as a cowhand and a construction worker. In 1920 and 1924, he was on the United States Olympic Rugby team along with his cousin Charles Lee Tilden Jr. Although the United States team won the gold medal both years, von Schmidt did not play in the only game in 1920, and was sidelined by an injury in the final practice in 1924. ==Career== Von Schmidt began his art studies at the California School of Arts and Crafts while he was still in high school. In 1924, he entered the Grand Central School of Art in New York City. He moved to the suburban community of New Rochelle which was a well-known artist colony and home to many of the top commercial illustrators of the day such as Frank and J. C. Leyendecker and Norman Rockwell. Also in residence were Al Parker, Mead Schaeffer and Dean Cornwell, who, along with Tom Lovell and N. C. Wyeth would become leaders in the field.Illustrators, Volume 33; Society of Illustrators (New York, N.Y.); Hastings House., 1991 He later married and moved to Westport, Connecticut. Harold von Schmidt's work appeared primarily in Collier's Weekly, Cosmopolitan, Liberty, The Saturday Evening Post, and Sunset. Although he preferred magazine work and illustrated few books, he spent two years preparing sixty illustrations for a deluxe edition of Willa Cather's Death Comes for the Archbishop. In 1948, he was recruited by Albert Dorne to be one of the founding faculty for the Famous Artists School. He was awarded the first gold medal by the trustees of the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in 1968. ==Death== Harold died on June 3, 1982 in Westport, Connecticut. ==Family== Harold's son Eric Von Schmidt was a well-known singer-songwriter associated with Bob Dylan. ==ReferencesBibliography=== *Reed, Walt.

His father sang Sundays in the Catholic Mass and his mother played piano. Listening to the classic French singers of the time on radio, such as Edith Piaf and Charles Trenet, inspired him as well. But his musical revelation came when he heard Félix Leclerc for the first time on the radio. From then on, he wanted to make music and, like Leclerc, sing simple, direct songs about everyday life. In 1954 Gauthier moved to Montreal where he worked for three years in the warehouse of the record dealer Édouard Archambault. After that he worked as a wilderness guide. All during this time he wrote songs and he was soon rewarded for his efforts. Encouraged to take part in a contest for singer-songwriters put on by CKVL, in Montreal, in 1959, he won first prize for \\"Le Soleil brillera demain\\" (\\"the sun will shine tomorrow\\"). He left his job and started singing in the coffee houses in Montreal accompanying himself on guitar. His songs from this period include: \\"Ton nom\\", (\\"Your Name\\") and \\"Le Grand six pieds\\" (\\"The Big Six-footer\\"). \\"Le Grand six pieds\\" was a big hit for him. It was based on memories of his early childhood, of the people, their struggle to make ends meet; it was a metaphor for the people of Quebec. ===First album=== He was signed up by the Columbia Record company. Gauthier's first album was called Claude Gauthier chante Claude Gauthier (Col FS-531). It included the song \\"Le Grand six pieds\\", which earned him the 1961 , awarded by the Montreal radio station CKAC. He took part in the 1962 Mariposa Folk Festival and in 1964 he sang at Carnegie Hall, New York, where he was warmly received. He shared the stage with Buffy Sainte-Marie, and Peter, Paul, and Mary. Gauthier and Sainte- Marie (who was born in Saskatchewan) exchanged tunes and co-wrote a song together. Sainte-Marie called her version \\"Until it's time for you to go\\" and Gauthier entitled his, \\"T'es pas une autre\\". Gauthier's success reached into France as well, and in 1966 he performed in Paris at the Olympia with Gilles Vigneault, Pauline Julien, and Clémence DesRochers. The following year he again appeared at the Olympia this time with Monique Leyrac, Les Jérolas, and Les Feux-Follets. ===Acting and recording=== At this time Gauthier started on another career, that of actor. He was the male lead in and wrote music for the film Entre la mer et l'eau douce (1967), which was directed by Michel Brault and starred Geneviève Bujold. The song \\"Genevieve\\" which Gauthier wrote for the film was an independent success. He also acted in CBC TV's Septième Nord in 1967. Gauthier started to record for a new record company, Gamma, a company that was in the process of recording a new generation of performers, such as Louise Forestier, and Robert Charlebois, bringing Gauthier to the awareness of a new generation. Gauthier performed with this outing of new talent at Expo 67. He appeared in the film \\"Où êtes-vous donc? in 1968. This period in Gauthier's career was one that brought him to rock and roll and the politics that was in the air at the time. His album Cerfs-Volants (Gamma GS-158) came out in 1968 and won the Festival du disque award. It contained topical songs about world events, such as those that were happening in Vietnam. During the next few years Gauthier recorded only 45s, but in 1972 his next album came out, Le Plus Beau Voyage (Gamma GS-158). It was recorded in France and it was one of his most successful recordings. A book of the same title containing his lyrics was published in Montreal in 1975. ===Acting in films=== Starting in 1973 Gauthier began to act in films. His first effort at this time was in Michel Brault's film Les Ordres (1974). This film has as a background the events of the October crisis of 1970, when the Canadian Parliament promulgated the War Measures Act. In this film Gauthier plays an unemployed father who is arrested during the crisis. The other films he acted in during this period were: Partis pour la gloire (1975) directed by Clément Perron for which Gauthier also composed the theme song \\"Les Beaux Instants\\", which appears on the LP of that name (1975, Presqu'Île PE 7500). And, he also acted in La Piastre (1976) directed by Alain Chartrand. During the rest of the 1970s Gauthier devoted himself to music, starting with a series of performances at the Outremont Theatre in 1975. He performed at the Festival of French Song in Strasbourg (France) in 1977. His next album, Ça Prend des Racines (1977) -- Presqu'île PE-7506 was successful but his singing career slowed down in the following years. He sang with Félix Leclerc on Leclerc's album My son in 1978, and in 1982 he sang on Fabienne Thibeault's Les chants aimés. He did not put out another album under his own name until 1984's Tendresses.o.s. Although Gauthier did continue to perform as a singer, he performed only occasionally and often with other musicians, such as the 1985 tour Trois fois chantera with Claude Léveillée and Pierre Létourneau. He also appeared at the Festival de St-Malo (1989). But these efforts were all in the background; his primary focus was on acting. He appeared in Gilles Carle's La guêpe (1986), François Labonté's Henri (1986), Louise Carré's Qui a tiré sur nos histoires d'amour (1986), Yves Dion's Les Enfants de la rue (1987), Michel Brault's short drama L'Emprise(1988) (once again with Geneviève Bujold), and Robert Ménard's L'Homme de rêve (1991). He also composed the music for Alain Chartrand's film Un homme de parole (1991). ===First CD=== Although he took part in the Montreal Francofolies in 1990 and put out his first CD, Planète coeur, in 1991 (Transit TRCD-9101), Gauthier turned his career toward television. He appeared in Arthur Leblanc's Arthur (1991) a documentary about the Acadian violinist Arthur Leblanc. And he also appeared in several Canadian TV series, including Chambres en ville (1989) and Bombardier (1992) a TV mini-series. In the following years he put out four CDs: L'Agenda (1993, Transit TRCD-9105), Quebec-Love (a compilation, 1994, Gamma GCD-504), Au Temps Des Boîtes à Chansons (recordings made in 1962, and reissued in 1998), and Jardins (1998 -- GSI Musique GSIC-989). In the same year that Jardins came out, Gauthier joined younger musicians, Daniel Boucher, Sabrina Bisson, and Marie-Michele Desrosiers in a concert commemorating the tenth anniversary of the death of Félix Leclerc; the concert was called Le 08-08-88 à 8h08. In 1999, Gauthier appeared in the critically acclaimed film by Michel Brault, Quand je serai parti... vous vivrez encore (English title: The Long Winter). ===Award=== In November 2000 Gauthier received the Prix Hommage of the SOCAN (Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada) for a lifetime of creativity. His 14th album L'homme qui passait par là appeared in March 2001. Following that album a concert performance by the same name (L'homme qui passait par là) was presented at the Corona Theatre in Montreal and also at the Cabaret du Capitole in Quebec City in March 2002. This performance included a string quartet, and host of projections from film archives as well as exceptional dramatic lighting; it underscored Gauthier's 40-year career. Starting in 2003 a series of retrospective recordings came out, Le plus beau voyage de mes chansons 1959-1972 (GSI Musique GSIC-905) in which Gauthier reinterpreted his previous hits with a new group of musicians. And along with Daniel Boucher, Gauthier appeared in another homage to Félix Leclerc at the Fête nationale du Québec, 2003, at the Parc Maisonneuve, Montreal. Gauthier continues to perform as a singer-songwriter and as an actor. ==Recordings== * Claude Gauthier Chante Claude Gauthier (1961) -- Columbia FL-284/FS-531 (V) * Claude Gauthier (1962) -- Columbia FL-295/FS-541 (V) * Claude Gauthier (1965) -- Gamma GS-101 (V) * Claude Gauthier (1967) -- Gamma GS-110 (V) * Cerfs- volants (1969) -- Gamma GS-119 (V) * Le Plus beau voyage (1972) -- Gamma GS-158 (V) * Album-Souvenir (compilation, 1975) -- Alta LT-807 (V) * Les Grands succès de Claude Gauthier (compilation, 1975) -- Gamma GS-2-1006 (V), GC2-1006 9 (K7) * Les beaux instants (performance at the Théâtre Outremont) (1976) -- Presqu'île PE-7500 (V), Transit TRCD-9104 (CD) * Ça prend des racines (1977) -- Presqu'île PE-7506 (V) * TendresseS.O.S.

Of a noble family, Obregón was an officer in the Spanish army, but he retired from military duty and dedicated himself to the service of the sick in the hospitals of Madrid. He spent 20 years working in various hospitals in the city, and became the director of the General Hospital of the city. During this time, he developed insights into the effective care of the sick, which he went on to pass on to the men who joined him. Others became associated with him in hospital service and in 1567, by consent of the papal nuncio at Madrid, a new congregation was founded. To the three ordinary religious vows was added that of free hospitality. The congregation did not found hospitals but served in those already existing. It spread in Spain and its dependencies, in Belgium and the Indies. The motherhouse was at the Convent of Our Lady of Victory on the Puerta del Sol in Madrid, adjacent to the Church of Our Lady of Good Success. This had been founded as the hospital for the Royal Court in 1529, when the Emperor Emperor Charles V decreed that this facility was no longer to move about the country with the court but was to be established at this site. Both structures were demolished in the 19th century, in the course of renovating the plaza. It was entrusted to the care of the Brothers by King Philip II. Obregón was invited to the Portuguese capital Lisbon in 1592, where he founded an asylum for orphan boys. Returning to Spain he assisted King Philip in his last illness (1598). Pope Paul V, in 1609, allowed the Obregonians to wear a black cross on the left side of the breast over the grey religious habit of the Third Order of St. Francis, to distinguish them from similar congregations. In 1617, an Obregonian Brother, Andrés Fernández, published the first manual of nursing care developed by and intended for nurses, Training Nurses and a Method for applying Remedies to all Forms of Illness (). Since the French occupation of Spain they have entirely disappeared. Streets in Madrid and Barcelona remain named for Obregón. ==References== * * Category:Men's congregations of the Franciscan Third Order Regular Category:Catholic religious orders established in the 16th century Category:Nursing in Spain Category:Catholic nursing orders ","title":"Obregonian Brothers"},{"id":"6197101","text":"The Fiat 518, also called Fiat Ardita, was a model of car produced by Italian car manufacturer Fiat between 1933 and 1938. The name \\"Ardita\\" was also used on the six-cylinder engined and more expensive Fiat Ardita 2500 or 527. In total 8,794 518s were produced by Fiat. Additionally the 518 was produced outside Italy: in France by Simca as Simca-Fiat 11 CV, and in Poland by Polski Fiat as well as by PZInż under licence. ==ModelsArdita and Ardita 2000=== The Ardita with available two chassis, having different wheelbases. Furthermore, there was a choice of two engines, the standard 1.8-litre (Ardita, also known as Ardita 1750) and a 2.0-litre version (Ardita 2000). The short wheelbase chassis was coded 518 C (for corta, short) and the long ( one 518 L (for lunga, long). Suspension and braking were fairly conventional, with solid axles front and rear, hydraulic dampers, hydraulic drum brakes on all four wheels and a band handbrake on the transmission. The 518 L chassis was fitted with wider tyres (5.50×17″ instead of 5.25×17″) and a different final drive ratio from the 518 C. Both the 518 C and 518 L were offered from the factory with 4-door saloon and 4-door torpedo bodies.

It is found in the southeastern Indian Ocean and the southwestern Pacific Ocean off Australia and New Zealand where they are found in shallow water near rocky reefs. ==Description== The silver drummer has an oval to circular when viewed from the side which is not compressed; the dorsal profile of the head is sloping between the area between the eyes and the snout with a characteristic bulging head profile. It has a continual dorsal fin which as a spiny anterior part and a soft-rayed posterior part, the spiny part being normally more than half as long again as the soft-rayed part. There are 10-11 spines and 11-12 soft rays in the dorsal fin while the anal fin has 2-3 spines and 10-12 soft rays. There is a total of 52-66 scales in the lateral line of which 42-56 are pored. It has a short caudal peduncle, a slightly emarginate caudal fin which has slightly rounded lobes. This is a large species which attains a maximum total length of and a maximum weight of . The ground colour can be olive, silvery-grey or bronzy usually darker above and paler below. There is a broad dark margin on the caudal fin and a rddish brown bar which runs from the upper jaw over the operculum, there is also a pale bar beneath its eye and a small black spot on the ventral margin of the base of the pectoral fin. ==Distribution== The silver drummer is found in the south-eastern Indian Ocean and the south western Pacific Ocean off Australia and New Zealand. In Australia its range is in the southern part of the continent where it occurs from Shark Bay in Western Australia, south to the southern coast of the continent, east to Tasmania and north to Fraser Island in Queensland. It is also found in the Tasman Sea around Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. In New Zealand it has been found as far south as Jackson Bay on the west coast of South Island but it is only really common around the North Island. Records from the islands in the Tasman Sea are probably misidentifications for Kyphosus bigibbus. ==Habitat and biology== The silver drummer is occasionally recorded as solitary individuals but normally congregates in large schools, these may be mixed with other species dependent on location. The mixed schools may include with K. gladius and K. bigibbus in Western Australia or just with K. bigibbus in eastern Australia and northern New Zealand. Its diet is mainly composed of phaeophytes, typically Ecklonia radiata, and rhodophytes. K. sydneyanus has a highly vascularised hing gut chamber, which is separated by a sphincter. This is where the majority of microbial fermentation occurs. The microbial fermentation allows the fish to properly digest phaeophytes. ==Fisheries== The silver drummer is regarded as a fish which puts up a good fight when caught by the angler and is therefore popular. However, most people consider its flesh to be inedible. ==Species description== The silver drummer was first formally described as Pimelepterus sydneyanus in 1886 by the Brtitish-German ichthyologist and herpetologist Albert Günther (1830-1914) with the type locality given as Port Jackson, New South Wales. == References == Silver drummer Category:Fish described in 1886 ","title":"Silver drummer"},{"id":"6197142","text":"Eureka Operations Pty Ltd (trading as Coles Express) is an Australian chain of convenience stores at Shell Australia petrol stations. Its operations are managed by Coles. The business venture and corresponding fuel discount offer was launched in July 2003 in response to the similar offer by rival Woolworths Limited some years earlier, proving attractive to shoppers. Wesfarmers purchased the retail business of Shell Australia multi-site franchisees in 2003 for A$94 million. Shell is the exclusive supplier of fuel products, leases the service station property to Coles, and maintains the presence of the \\"pecten\\" and other Shell branding on the price board and other signage. In August 2014, Shell sold its Australian refinery in Geelong and petrol stations for A$2.9 billion (US$2.6 billion) to Vitol, a Geneva based company. Vitol operates these assets as Viva Energy, which maintains Shell branding on its service stations under a brand licence arrangement. Approximately 270 independently franchised Shell service stations remain unassociated with Coles Express where the fuel discount offer is not accepted. Despite revenue for FY16 decreasing, Wesfarmers stated that excluding fuel sales (which have declined), in-store sales increased. ==History== The Coles Express brand originally referred to a small number of medium-sized supermarkets Coles ran in the central business districts of Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. With the launch of Coles' fuel offer, these were rebranded as Coles Central with the service stations taking the Coles Express branding. The current Coles Express chain began at more than 150 service stations in Victoria on 28 July 2003. After this initial trial, it was followed by a national roll-out from 1 December the same year, starting with New South Wales, and completed in mid-2004. The initial success of the discount offer saw fuel shortages in Victoria after the offer began in New South Wales – where Shell's busiest sites are located – as Shell failed to cope with the distribution of a 30 percent increase in demand. There are now over 700 Coles Express service stations and stand alone convenience sites across Australia. All former Shell multi-site franchisee sites became Coles Express stores. This transition included the petrol stations and stand-alone Shell Select convenience stores in Melbourne's CBD (which closed by December 2006). On 20 February 2006, 90 vehicle servicing bays at Coles Express service stations (formerly part of Shell's Autoserv and AutoCare network) became Kmart Tyre & Auto Service outlets. In 2018 Coles Express started trialling standalone convenience sites in Victoria. ==The Coles and Viva Energy alliance== On the 6th of February 2019 Coles Express announced a new alliance partnership with their fuel partner Viva Energy (Shell). Under the agreement Viva Energy is responsible for setting the price of fuel and receives the retail fuel margin. Coles Express receives a commission per litre from Viva Energy based on fuel volumes achieved and has no direct exposure to retail fuel price movements.https://www.afr.com/business/retail/coles-signs-new-fuel-deal-with- viva-says-convenience-earnings-will-fall-62pc-20190206-h1awom In addition to setting fuel pricing Viva Energy is the exclusive supplier of fuel, oil and lubricants. Viva also maintains it 'Pecten' and Shell branding as well as all fuel dispensing equipment. Coles Express is responsible for the maintenance of the retail store (including in-store pricing) and the everyday needs of the business. ==Fuel discount offerCurrent fuel discount offers=== When a customer spends over a qualifying amount in one transaction at Coles Supermarkets, Coles Central, or Coles Online, they are entitled to a fuel discount of 4c per litre or 8 bonus flybuys points per litre at Coles Express. This discount is obtained by providing a discount voucher, printed at the bottom of their receipt, and includes all Shell fuels. Coles Express also offers a 10c per litre discount on all Shell fuels when a customer spends $20 or more on qualify products in store, this can be used in addition to the 4c per litre discount voucher. All discount fuel offers or bonus points offers do not apply to Shell Card, Fleet Card, WEX Motorpass or Motorcharge transactions. ===Previous fuel discount offerings=== An additional \\"bonus\\" discount was introduced in late 2006, with a further 2c per litre fuel discount when customers spend $2 in-store in the one transaction. The offer was made permanent in April 2007 after rival Caltex Woolworths created a similar offer of an additional 4c discount if customers spend $5 in the one transaction at their petrol stations. The 2c per litre finished on 1 February 2013. Coles Express now offers a \\"Spend $20 and Save 10 cents per litre\\" this was launched to an \\"Everyday\\" offer in late 2015 and has continued since, variations of this deal are offered occasionally e.g. Buy product X for X dollars and save X cents per litre. Other variations of the fuel offer have been offered from time to time including: *In the lead-up to Christmas 2006, the 4c offer increased to 10c for customers spending $80 and over in one transaction at Coles Supermarkets; this offer was extended for a further short time in attempt to boost Coles' sales figures. *Liquorland has offered a 20c-per-litre discount offer when customers purchase six bottles of wine in one transaction. *Kmart Tyre & Auto Service has offered a 30c-per-litre discount offer when customers purchased four certain tyres in one transaction. ==Gallery== Image:Coles-express-clontarf-queensland.JPGColes Express on Hornibrook Esplanade, Clontarf, Queensland Image:Shell - Coles Express petrol station.jpgColes Express on Sturt Highway, Wagga Wagga, New South Wales Image:Coles Express Burwood Highway Vermont South.jpgColes Express on Burwood Highway, Vermont South, Melbourne Image:Coles Express Elizabeth Street Hobart.jpgColes Express/Hungry Jack's on Elizabeth Street, Hobart. ==References *Coles Express Category:Automotive fuel retailers in Australia Category:Coles Group Category:Australian grocers ","title":"Coles Express"},{"id":"6197144","text":"The International Committee for Democracy in Cuba (ICDC) was created in September 2003 as \\"a response to the latest brutal crackdown by the Cuban government in the spring of that year against those pushing for democratic reforms, freedom of speech and adherence to international human rights agreements\\".

The ruin is a building that formerly housed the Swift Mansion and later, the Light of Hope Orphanage, and is the subject of local urban legends, whereby the violent deaths of young adults and children are alleged to have occurred. According to the urban legends, supernatural activity has occurred in the building since its closure. Though historians have concluded that Gore Orphanage itself never existed, the legend claims that in 1800s Vermilion, Ohio, a fire was set which killed many children and one African American woman, whose ghosts now haunt the ruins. Historians also have determined that Gore Orphanage is the name of a road, not a building, and many unrelated people, places, and events simply have been combined into a ghost story. ==History of the Gore Orphanage legendLocation aspect=== The actual location of Swift Mansion The location that is claimed to be the actual site of Gore Orphanage is in fact the remains of Swift Mansion, also called Swift's Hollow, which was built and owned in 1840–42 by Joseph Swift. Gore Orphanage Road is the only location in Vermilion, Ohio, whose name contains the words \\"Gore Orphanage.\\" Originally, the road was called simply \\"Gore Road,\\" referring not to blood or tissue (as the ghost story implies) but to a surveyor's error in a gore (a narrow strip of land) along this road. The word \\"orphanage\\" in the road's name actually refers to the Light of Hope Orphanage, which is less than one mile away from the supposed Gore Orphanage site. Adapted from: ===Fire aspect=== There is credible evidence that a fire burned down the Light of Hope Orphanage and that children died there. The printing building of the Light of Hope Orphanage burned down during the morning of November 22, 1910. There were human casualties, and this was the only fire to have occurred at the Light of Hope Orphanage. The Wilber family, who occupied Swift Mansion for a time, engaged in spiritual séances and eventually lost four young children to a local diphtheria epidemic; the séances and child deaths caused the location's reputation for being haunted. However, the Wilber children did not die in Swift Mansion. Place of Death listed as Berlin Heights, OH. The aspect of the legend regarding children trapped inside a burning building was likely inspired by the Collinwood school fire of 1908, which occurred years after the Swift Mansion events and the Light of Hope Orphanage opening At Internet Archive. and resulted in the deaths of 172 children and a few adults. Swift Mansion itself burned down on the night of December 6, 1923, though there were no human casualties. ===Paranormal aspect=== Driveway marker for Swift Mansion The cries of orphans trapped in a fire, central to the legend, are claimed to be heard at the ruins of Gore Orphanage (Swift Mansion). However, investigators attribute the cries to the high-pitched hum of truck traffic on the nearby interstate highway, not visible from the area of the ruins. The Ohio Turnpike (Interstate 80) bridges the Vermilion River approximately miles from the ruins. When a truck crosses the bridge, winds often carry the brief high hum to the ruins as a ghostly wail, unrecognizable as mechanical in origin. A local activity known as \\"legend tripping\\" involves teenagers testing one another's courage with ghost stories of haunted locations to which they travel by automobile. As early as 1905, teenagers were visiting the Swift Mansion before it developed its current Gore Orphanage legend, in search of the supernatural, due to its reputation for being haunted. In later years, the sounds from unseen truck traffic were added to the legend as ghostly cries. ==Popular culture== A feature film by Principalities of Darkness LLC, is inspired by the legend. The film stars Maria Olsen and Bill Townsend. ==See also== * List of reportedly haunted locations in the United States ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Lorain County, Ohio Category:Ohio culture Category:Reportedly haunted locations in Ohio ","title":"Gore Orphanage"},{"id":"6197196","text":"Matsa * Matzo * Typhoon Matsa ","title":"Matsa"},{"id":"6197202","text":"Fiat 519 B Torpedo 1925 Fiat 519 A Sedan 1924 Sedanca-de-Ville 1922 The Fiat 519 was a model of car produced by Italian automotive company, Fiat between 1922 and 1927. 2411 were produced in total.

Walt Disney Imagineering: A Behind the Dreams Look At Making the Magic Real. Disney Editions. . Since Europe is home to the castles that inspired the structures at Disney's first three parks, Imagineers reconsidered what kind of edifice would stand at the hub of its first European theme park. Many different concepts were then created and considered, ranging from slightly modified versions of Disney's existing castles to radically new structures to stand instead in the Castle's place (for example a Discoveryland-like tower). The team eventually settled on Imagineer Tom Morris' approach to the established Disney castle. Inspirations cited by Imagineering include illustrations from the book of hours Les Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry and the Mont Saint- Michel monastery in Normandy. As Charles Perrault had not detailed the castle in his 1697 fairy tale, Imagineering had few restrictions regarding its physical appearance. However, Walt Disney's own 1959 film Sleeping Beauty provided the inspiration for, among other things, the Castle's surrounding square trees. The realisation of the stained glass windows in London, which are visible in Sleeping Beauty's Gallery, was overseen by Peter Chapman, who had previously worked on the restoration of Notre Dame de Paris. Completed in 1992, for the park's 12 April opening, Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant stands tall. ==Castle== The Castle is home to a dragon, which, at from head to tail, was the largest Animatronic figure yet built when the park opened in April 1992. The walkthrough attraction consists of a dimly lit cavern with the large dragon sleeping silently. Occasionally it will 'wake up', puffing smoke and growling. The building also contains La Galerie de la Belle au Bois Dormant, a gallery of displays which illustrate the story of Sleeping Beauty in tapestries, stained glass windows and figures. La Boutique du Château, a shop selling Christmas ornaments year-round, and Merlin l'Enchanteur, a shop specialising in handmade glass figures, are located on ground floor. ==Changes throughout the years== The castle has received several overlays throughout the years. The first occurred during the park's first anniversary celebration in 1993, when the castle was dressed up as a cake complete with strawberries, icing and candles. This overlay was removed after the celebration ended. The cake overlay concept was later copied by Walt Disney World's Cinderella Castle in 1996 for the 25th Anniversary of the resort. During the fifth anniversary of Disneyland Paris in 1997, the castle was decorated in carnival masks, jester hats, frills and bells to promote the animated film The Hunchback of Notre Dame. This overlay lasted until the beginning of 1998. During the tenth anniversary of Disneyland Paris in 2002, the front of the castle was fitted with a golden scroll displaying a large 10. The celebration also saw the opening of Walt Disney Studios next door. The scroll and other anniversary material in the park were removed in 2003. In 2007, the castle received another overlay, celebrating the park's fifteenth anniversary. It featured golden Disney characters displayed on the turrets and spires, each holding a candle, and Tinkerbell on the highest spire. The candles were illuminated each night during a special 'Candlebration' ceremony which took place on a raised temporary stage at Central Plaza, in front of the Castle. A huge illuminated gold plaque featuring a large '15' was hung on the front of the castle. This echoed the overlay from the tenth anniversary in 2002. The fifteenth anniversary and the 'Candlebration' ceremony ended on March 7, 2009. The fifteenth anniversary overlay quickly followed on April 4, 2009 by Mickey's Magical Party, a \\"theme year\\" celebration held at the park. The castle was again overlaid, this time with a Mickey and Friends plaque over the main window, and the spire heads were changed from being characters to being 3 circles \\"of ribbon\\" representing Mickey Mouse. A more permanent Central Plaza stage was built outside the castle to host the \\"It's dance time... with Mickey and Friends\\" show. The castle was repainted in a new colour-scheme, restored and fitted with multicolored LED lighting during 2011. For the Disney Dreams nighttime spectacular show its moat was fitted with water fountains, the upper window was replaced by doors that open to reveal a LED lighted star and Central Plaza stage was removed in order to increase the viewing area. ==Popular culture== In Epic Mickey the castle was adapted into the game's starting and finishing level, Dark Beauty Castle. This version contained elements of the various Disney castles and even had statues resembling Disney characters. ==See also== * Sleeping Beauty Castle * Cinderella Castle * Castle of Magical Dreams * Enchanted Storybook Castle ==References *Photos Magiques - Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant / La Galerie de la Belle au Bois Dormant / La Tanière du Dragon / * DLRP Magic - Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant / La Galerie de la Belle au Bois Dormant / La Tanière du Dragon * EuroSouvenirland - The Castle Throughout the Years * DLRP Synopsis - Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1992 Category:Walt Disney Parks and Resorts attractions Category:Walt Disney Parks and Resorts icons Category:Disneyland Park (Paris) Category:Sleeping Beauty (1959 film) Category:Fantasyland Category:Audio- Animatronic attractions Category:Châteaux in Seine-et-Marne Category:Amusement parks opened in 1992 Category:1992 establishments in France ","title":"Le Château de la Belle au Bois Dormant"},{"id":"6197249","text":"The 26th Infantry Brigade was the name of two British Army formations during the First World War and Second World War. ==First World War== The 26th Brigade was formed in 1915 as part of Kitchener's Army of volunteers.

Pages on the site dealt with murder, rape, farm attacks and armed robbery. The stated aim of the site was \\"to provide foreigners with detailed information and regular updates regarding the issue of safety in South Africa\\". Expired on 21 November 2006. The site was started on 4 July 2006 purportedly by a Neil Watson, later purportedly joined by Shaun Thompson; although newspaper reports later suggested that both of these may have been noms-de-plume of a gay rights activist, Juan Duval Uys. On 21 November 2006 the website was suspended due to the failure of the owners to remove what the hosting service deemed to be abusive content. Watson stated that the offending comments were left by hackers as part of a smear campaign to discredit the site, and that the site would be relaunched with a new host by 30 November 2006. The site was back online at the url crimexposouthafrica.net, but, as of October 2008, is discontinued. == Reaction == The site received much criticism for \\"highlighting negative news and ignoring successes in the fight against crime\\". In particular, criticism came from the tourism sector for \\"skewing the truth\\", as well as the South African Football Association for \\"counteracting job creation by discouraging tourism and investment\\" (South Africa hosted the 2010 FIFA World Cup). The Crime Expo site contended that South African tourism agencies were only interested in the money spent by international tourists, not in their safety, and were thus downplaying publicity on the violent crimes committed in the country. In response to the Crime Expo website, several individuals started opposing sites claiming to provide a more balanced view of crime in the country. The two most prominent ones are Real South Africa (started by Pieter Boshoff), whose stated aim is to \\"make a positive contribution to the development of the country by following a positive approach\\", and True Crime Expo (created by Malan Jacobs), which was started \\"to try and bring some perspective in this debate.\\" Further websites have been developed more recently that enable \\"public interactivity in the debate\\". Crime Out Loud (created by Claudio Caldeira), displays a more interactive, community-based website for a balanced debate. Boshoff's website has been endorsed by prominent businessman Raymond Ackerman, which led to a call from Watson for people to boycott Ackerman's Pick 'n Pay supermarket and to send e-mail and text messages to the chain. == Press coverage == The website, and the intense debate it sparked, received wide press coverage, being syndicated by Reuters both locally and abroad. Major news stations and papers which covered the story include BBC News, Independent Online and The Independent. The impact and content of the site was also debated in several local and international blogs. == Accusations of fraud == On 14 November 2006 The Citizen published an investigative report alleging that Watson and Shaun Thompson may be the same person, and that they may also be the same person as Juan Duval Uys. Uys is a gay rights activist and leader of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance. Watson has denied being Uys, stating that Uys was a volunteer at CESA and was involved in its establishment. The Citizen further reported that although the website had been accepting donations for some time, no Section 21 company (referring to a South African non-profit organisation) had been registered in its name. Simon Grindrod, the Cape Town leader of the Independent Democrats, laid a charge of fraud against Watson, calling on him to \\"explain what he has done with the money\\". == Formation of political party == According to the website, the leaders of the organisation were in the process of filing an application at the Independent Electoral Commission in Pretoria to register as a political party. The party would be registered as Crime Expo South Africa, abbreviated CESA. In early November 2006, the IEC reported that a man claiming to be Mr. Watson had enquired about forming a political party, but had not actually begun the process. In August 2008, the National Party South Africa party was registered with the Independent Electoral Commission as a new incarnation of the defunct New National Party. Juan-Duval Uys was listed as the party's organiser. == References == Category:2006 establishments in South Africa Category:Crime in South Africa Category:Internet properties established in 2006 Category:South African news websites ","title":"Crime Expo South Africa"},{"id":"6197333","text":"Foetorepus is a genus of dragonets.

He was a champion professional wrestler, as were his father Joseph and his grandfather John. His brother, Doug Robinson, is also an actor and stuntman. ==CareerProfessional wrestling=== Robinson initially embarked on a career in wrestling as 'Tiger Joe Robinson' and won the European Heavyweight Championship in 1952. At the same time, he was also interested in acting and studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. After injuring his back wrestling in Paris he decided to concentrate on acting. Joe Robinson's daughter Polly Robinson (Hardy-Stewart) has also continued the family's success in martial arts by winning the junior Judo championships in the 1980s. ===Acting=== Robinson's first role came in the keep-fit documentary Fit as a Fiddle and in the same year, 1952, he followed it up with a part as Harry 'Muscles' Green in the musical Wish You Were Here in the West End of London. He made his film debut in 1955's A Kid for Two Farthings, in which he wrestled Primo Carnera. His film and television career really took off in the 1960s and in 1962 he appeared in British classic The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner alongside appearances in The Saint and The Avengers in 1963. With his younger brother Doug and Honor Blackman, he co-authored Honor Blackman's Book of Self-Defence in 1965 (Joe was also a judo champion and black belt at karate). The year after he appeared in an episode of the sitcom Pardon the Expression which referenced this book. During this time he was also a popular stunt-arranger, working on several James Bond films and in 1960 was invited to Rome where he appeared in five muscle-bound Italian epics, including Taur the Mighty (1963), Thor and the Amazon Women (1963) and Ursus and the Tartar Princess (1961). Other notable big-screen appearances include 1961's Carry On Regardless, of the British institution the Carry Ons. According to the book Tarzan of the Movies by Gabe Essoe, Robinson played the role of Tarzan in obscure Italian-made films (Taur, il re della forza bruta and Le gladiatrici); the use of the Tarzan character, however, was unauthorised and the character's name had to be changed to Thaur before the film was allowed for public release. His final big-screen appearance was in the 1971 James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever in which he plays diamond smuggler Peter Franks. Robinson claimed that he was a contender for the Red Grant role in From Russia with Love. Though he did not get it, Connery recommended him for the role in Diamonds are Forever. Robinson also claimed he turned down the role of the Rank Organisation's Gongman. ===Retirement=== He retired from acting, and lived in Brighton where he opened a martial arts centre. He conducted classes in Wadō-ryū style karate and Judo. In 1998 he hit the headlines after fighting off a gang of eight muggers single-handed. The 70-year-old was alighting from a bus in Cape Town when the gang struck with baseball bats and knives. 6 ft 2 ins Robinson overpowered two with flying kicks, karate-chopped another in the chest and broke the arm of a fourth - the rest fled. Reminiscing about his career in the Daily Mail, Robinson spoke on the subject of Laurence Olivier's alleged homosexuality saying 'my kids used to play with his kids at school and I taught him judo ... I have no idea if he was a homosexual... but he did once tell me I had lovely shoulders'. ==Death== Robinson died at the age of 90 on 3 July 2017, in Brighton, East Sussex. ==Filmography== {  - !

As well as 19 games and 8 test match appearances for New Zealand, Allen played 110 games for Taranaki and was captain of the inaugural Wellington Hurricanes Super 12 team. He was also captain of the first and short-lived Central Vikings team. ==BiographyChildhood=== Mark Allen was born in Stratford, New Zealand, on 31 July 1967, to Steve Allen and Annette Richards. His father Steve ran an auto- electrical store which had been established by Steve's father Colin in 1945. Allen attended Stratford Primary School and received his secondary education at Stratford High School. He stood out in both wrestling and in rugby, representing the First XV in the latter. ===Taranaki years=== Upon leaving school Allen took up an apprenticeship with his father, and quickly stood out for Stratford in age-grade and club rugby as an exceptionally mobile prop forward. He played his first match for Taranaki in the annual Queens Birthday Weekend fixture in 1988 against Wanganui. Later that season he was selected for the Rugby News New Zealand Youth Team which toured Germany and Scotland and was coached by Fred Allen and Sid Going. It was on this tour that Allen picked up the nickname \\"Bull\\", coined by Going's nephew Quentin in reference to a character in the American TV Series Night Court then showing on New Zealand television. It was a nickname that was to stick for the remainder of his career and beyond. In 1989 Allen secured a permanent place in the Taranaki front row, and in 1990 was awarded Taranaki player of the year after impressing with his strong scrummaging and hard running. He toured Canada with the New Zealand Development Team at the end of the year and just missed out on All Black selection when the All Black front row in France was plagued with injury, losing out to Olo Brown because he couldn't play tighthead prop. In 1991 Allen struggled with Asthma and the flu, and the Taranaki side was relegated to second division after finishing at the bottom of the table. In 1992 the team fought hard in a competitive second division and came out on top, returning to the first division the following year. Taranaki's success had a lot to do with the form and leadership of \\"Bull\\", who was appointed captain for the final four games. He scored two tries in his first match as captain, and two in the semi-final win against Manawatu, finishing the season with 10 tries and a reputation as the most mobile and dynamic prop forward in the country. ===Selection for the All Blacks=== 1993 saw Allen selected for the All Blacks for the first time, making his first appearance in the test match against Samoa at Eden Park. He toured England and Scotland with the side at the end of the year, playing seven more games in the black jersey. The following year Richard Loe returned from suspension, and coach Laurie Mains controversially preferred Loe over Allen on the grounds Allen was too flashy and not strong enough as a scrummager. To add injury to insult Allen suffered a unique blow when he ripped his pectorial muscle almost completely in a match against Auckland and missed the rest of the season, which saw Taranaki again relegated to the second division. Allen recovered in time to attend All Black training camps over the summer in preparation for the World Cup, although made the headlines after nearly drowning in a whitewater rafting accident. He trialled for the World Cup team, but was again rejected with 35-year-old Loe chosen ahead of him. Again, though, Allen led the Taranaki side to victory in the second division and a return to division one. His leadership proved crucial in the semi-final against Bay of Plenty when prop Gordon Slater appeared to have been the victim of foul play and was carried off with a broken leg, and that year was awarded the Hilary Commission Fair Play award. The \\"Bull Fan Club\\" was appeased when Allen was selected for the All Black tour of Italy and France where he played four games and scored a try against Cote Basque-Landes. ===Wellington Hurricanes & Central Vikings=== In 1996 Rugby Football became professional in New Zealand with the formation of the Super 12 involving teams from New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. Allen was appointed captain of the Wellington Hurricanes team, and led them in New Zealand's first ever professional rugby football match. He made a test match appearance as a substitute against Scotland that season, and toured South Africa with the first All Black team to win a test match series against South Africa on their turf. The same weekend that the series was sealed, while Allen was in South Africa, Taranaki won the prestigious Ranfurly Shield in a victory over Auckland. However Allen's perceived lack of enthusiasm when put on the spot in an impromptu interview led to some bad feeling among some Taranaki supporters, and upon returning Allen did not resume the captaincy from Andy Slater. The end-of-year 80–34 defeat at the hands of Otago proved to be Allen's final appearance in the amber and black jersey after 110 games for the province. The following year \\"Bull\\" joined the newly created Central Vikings team, which was a merger of the Manawatu and Hawkes Bay unions under Hurricanes coach Frank Oliver, in an attempt to form a more competitive team that could foot it in first division. Allen was named captain, but couldn't add a third second division victory to the two he'd won for Taranaki. He made four test match appearances in the New Zealand season as substitute against Argentina, South Africa and Australia, scoring his only test match try against Argentina. Selected for his second All Black tour of the UK, Allen made an appearance as substitute against Wales, and was selected for the starting line-up for the final match against England. This is commonly considered to have been the peak of Allen's rugby career. In 1998 Allen was devastated by a serious back injury when he was diagnosed with a prolapsed disc in his back. At the same time Allen recognised the priority of family life and decided to retire altogether from the game after playing 19 games and 8 test matches for the All Blacks and scoring two tries. ===TV appearances=== Allen was a well- known face on New Zealand TV with his shaved head, grin and personality. He hosted TV shows such as Ansett New Zealand Time of Your Life, The Footy Show and Game of Two-Halves. ==All Blacks statistics== Tests: 8 (0 as Captain) Games: 19 (0 as Captain) Total Matches: 27 (0 as Captain) Test Points: 5pts (1t, 0c, 0p, 0dg, 0m) Game Points: 5pts (1t, 0c, 0p, 0dg, 0m) Total Points: 10pts (2t, 0c, 0p, 0dg, 0m) ==Bibliography== Harvey, John (1998), The Mark of the Bull.

Nevertheless, the son of actors had already worked with established directors such as Peter Greenaway and Marianne. ==Career== His first role in a feature film was ' (1997) (TV), directed by Andreas Dresen. In the following years, he appeared in critically acclaimed projects such as ' (2003), Off Beat (2004), ' (2007) and '. portrayed Lieutenant-Colonel Franz Herber in Valkyrie, a 2008 film dramatizing the failed 20 July assassination and political coup plot to kill Adolf Hitler. The international release of Valkyrie and the all-star cast (including Tom Cruise, Kenneth Branagh, Terence Stamp and Bill Nighy) not only allowed Schweighöfer to be recognized abroad, it provided an opportunity for him to be cast in other English speaking roles. In 2010 Schweighöfer made his debut as film director with the romantic comedy What a Man, followed in 2013 by his second movie '. In 2009 he founded the fashion label German Garment with TV presenter Joko Winterscheidt. In 2017 he directed, produced and played the lead role in You Are Wanted, Amazon Studios' first non-English-language TV series. ==Personal life== Between 2004 and 2012 Schweighöfer dated Ani Schromm, and they got together again in the summer of 2013. They have a daughter, Greta (born 1 May 2009) and a son, Valentin (born 17 February 2014).

Most chemical reactions are stepwise, that is they take more than one elementary step to complete. An intermediate is the reaction product of each of these steps, except for the last one, which forms the final product. Reactive intermediates are usually short lived and are very seldom isolated. Also, owing to the short lifetime, they do not remain in the product mixture. For example, consider this hypothetical stepwise reaction: :A + B → C + D The reaction includes these elementary steps: :A + B → X* :X* → C + D The chemical species X* is an intermediate. ==Definition== The IUPAC Gold BookIUPAC Goldbook definition of intermediate defines an intermediate as a molecular entity (atom, ion, molecule...) with a lifetime appreciably longer than a molecular vibration that is formed (directly or indirectly) from the reactants and reacts further to give (either directly or indirectly) the products of a chemical reaction. The lifetime condition distinguishes true, chemically distinct intermediates from vibrational states or such transition states which, by definition have lifetimes close to that of molecular vibration, and thus, intermediates correspond to potential energy minima of depth greater than available thermal energy arising from temperature, (RT, where R is gas constant and T is temperature). Many intermediates are short-lived and highly reactive, thus having a low concentration in the reaction mixture. As is always the case when discussing chemical kinetics, definitions like fast/slow short/long-lived are relative, and depend on the relative rates of all the reactions involved. Species that are short-lived in one reaction mechanism, can be considered stable in others and molecular entities that are intermediates in some mechanisms can be stable enough to be detected, identified, isolated or used as reactants in (or be the products of) other reactions. Reaction intermediates are often free radicals or unstable ions. Oxidizing radicals (OOH and OH) found in combustion reactions are so reactive that a high temperature is required to constantly produce them, in order to compensate their disappearance, or the combustion reaction will cease. When the necessary conditions of the reaction no longer prevail, these intermediates react further and no longer remain in the reaction mixture. There are some operations where multiple reactions are run in the same batch. For example, in an esterification of a diol, a monoester product is formed first, and may be isolated, but the same reactants and conditions promote a second reaction of the monoester to a diester. The lifetime of such an \\"intermediate\\" is considerably longer than the lifetime of the intermediates of the esterification reaction itself (the tetrahedral intermediate). ==Chemical processing industry== In the chemical industry, the term intermediate may also refer to the (stable) product of a reaction that is itself valuable only as a precursor chemical for other industries. A common example is cumene which is made from benzene and propylene and used to make acetone and phenol in the cumene process. The cumene itself is of relatively little value in and of itself, and is typically only bought and sold by chemical companies. ==See also== * Activated complex ==References== * * Category:Chemical kinetics Category:Chemical reactions ","title":"Reaction intermediate"},{"id":"6197471","text":"The Higher Population Council-General Secretariat (HPC/GS) is a specialized agency of the Jordanian government, acting as the authority for all reproductive health issues and programs in Jordan.

Their style of music has come to be called Celtic Rock for the fusion of Irish traditional instruments and music with modern rock. They have released nine albums, starting with Rocky Road in 1993 and most recently 9 in 2013. They have toured the United States and Europe since 1994, supporting Jethro Tull, John Hiatt, Chris Isaak, Jonny Lang, Great Big Sea and Collective Soul. AllMusic.com states, \\"Their live shows (have) a jam-like appeal, similar to the vibes of Phish and the Dave Matthews Band.\\" Wilson, MacKenzie. \\"Young Dubliners bio\\", Allmusic, accessed December 26, 2008. Members include lead vocalist and guitarist Keith Roberts, violinist Chas Waltz, drummer David Ingraham, guitarist Justin Pecot, and bassist Ethan Jones. Their repertoire consists mostly of original rock compositions and Irish folk songs with a rock twist. Their influences include Thin Lizzy, The Pogues, The Waterboys and U2. ==Origins== The Young Dubliners were founded in 1988 by Dublin native Keith Roberts and Paul O'Toole. The two had been tweaking some Irish ballads of original music and decided that it was time to put a band together. The band consisted of Roberts, O'Toole and Brendan Holmes (bass), Randy Woolford (electric and acoustic guitar) and Douglas James (drums). Based on early recordings, the Young Dubliners produced their first cassette tape of Irish folk and pop songs recorded live at the Irish Rover entitled \\"the Young Dubliners\\". After this recording, the line-up of the band changed continuously. The only constant band members during this time were bassist Brendan Holmes, guitarist Randy Woolford and drummer Douglas James. Holmes grew up near Roberts in the Dublin suburb of Dún Laoghaire. Songs like \\"Dirty Old Town\\", \\"Fisherman's Blues\\" and \\"Rocky Road to Dublin\\" became essential songs. After having been directly influenced by Celtic musician Christy Moore and Irish band The Fureys, the Young Dubliners released their second original song \\"Home\\", on an eponymously titled second record. Unlike their first cassette, their second one was recorded in a studio and featured additional musicians and overdubs but otherwise had a similar mix of Irish folk and pop songs. After this, they stopped playing at The Irish Rover exclusively and branched out to other venues. ==Rocky Road to Alive, Alive'O== In 1993, Roberts became part owner and operator of Fair City Dublin, an Irish pub and live music venue in Santa Monica. By this time the lineup of the band consisted of Roberts, Holmes, lead guitarist Randy Woolford, violinist Lovely Previn aka Alicia Previn (daughter of celebrated conductor André Previn ), woodwinds player Jeff Dellisanti, and drummer Jon Mattox, who replaced Douglas James. By now the band had played various venues throughout California, and as they became the house band at Fair City their popularity increased dramatically. In 1994, the act was signed to the Scotti Brothers record label, and they were teamed with producer Micheal Blum to record their debut album, the EP Rocky Road. Rocky Road featured mostly original material, save for the band's version of the title track, \\"Rocky Road to Dublin.\\" The single \\"Last House on the Street\\" became a hit nationally on the adult album alternative radio format, and immediately the group began to tour the US in support. The geographic areas the band found the most popularity - primarily Colorado, Utah, the Northeast, and California - remain the biggest selling shows for the Young Dubliners to this day. For well over a decade they held the record for the most consecutive sold-out shows at the House Of Blues, Sunset Strip, with more than 50 shows at capacity. In 1995, the group recorded and released its first full-length album, Breathe. While the line-up remained the same, the personnel had changed; violinist Lovely Previn was replaced by Kansas City-native Chas Waltz, formerly of the group Shooting Star. Like Rocky Road, the album Breathe featured mostly original material, but also included the band's reworkings of traditional Irish songs such as \\"Foggy Dew\\" and \\"Follow Me Up to Carlow,\\" both of which are live concert favorites still. The singles from this album included \\"Mary\\" and \\"Change the World.\\" In the early part of 1995, the band also guest starred in an episode of VR Troopers titled \\"Fiddler on the Loose\\". During the next two years, the Young Dubs continued to tour the US, all the while building a solid following throughout the United States. Although their contract with Scotti Brothers records ended, Roberts, Woolford and O'Toole were working on new songs. Chas Waltz exited the band to form his own band Judy Judy Judy; he was replaced by Mark Epting. In 1997, the group signed with Cargo Music, Inc. and recorded a live album at the Belly Up in Solana Beach, CA. The recording was produced by Steve Albini. Although the live tracks were mixed at Abbey Road Studios in London, the mixes were rejected by Cargo Music; the finished album was mixed in Track Star Studio in San Diego by Josquin Des Pres and Tour Manager/FOH engineer Don Tartaro. Titled Alive Alive O', the album featured seven live songs. Most of the cuts were new original compositions; one was a cover of the Waterboy's \\"Fisherman's Blues\\", and two were live versions of previously recorded songs. The original song \\"Blink” was added as a bonus studio track to finish the running order, and a video for the song was produced in Los Angeles and directed by Aaron A. Goffman. Link to official video: BLINK. In 1997 they also made a brief appearance in HBO’s mini series The Last Don. Alive Alive O' was released on February 10, 1998, and gathered warm reviews. Daily Vault said \\"(the album) shows that they are not a product of the producer's skills, but instead, can thrive in the challenging live environment.\\"Bellach, Allison. \\"Alive Alive'O - The Young Dubliners\\", The Daily Vault.com, April 8, 1998. Just prior to the release of Alive Alive O', backing vocalist and mandolinist Paul O'Toole quit the band. In his place, Keith Roberts began to sing lead on the traditional Irish ballads the band covered live (songs that Paul O' Toole had previously sung). Violinist Epting began to double on mandolin and harmonica, and the Young Dubliners carried on as a six piece group while touring to support the new CD release. ==Red== In 1999, lead guitarist Randy Woolford, announced his retirement from touring and left the band. Woolford had been in the band for 9 years and had co-written most of the band's songs. Woolford had been a big part in creating the Dubs Irish Rock sound/style. He was replaced by Southern California native Bob Boulding, who joined the band during the summer tour of that year. After the conclusion of that national tour, drummer Jon Mattox followed suit and also gave notice that he would leave the band. However, Mattox stayed on as a studio musician for the production of their next album, Red. Red was the Young Dubliner's first release for their new record label, Higher Octave and was produced by Thom Pununzio. At the request of the label, many of the songs on Red were new, studio-recorded versions of the songs from Alive Alive'O. Included was the live barnstormer medley \\"Rising / Change The World\\". Additionally, four new originals were featured, including the instrumental \\"Bodhran\\" (named after the Irish drum which starts out the track), and the title track \\"Red\\", cowritten with Elton John lyricist Bernie Taupin. After the recording of the album, it was time to fill drummer Jon Mattox's shoes; after a brief run with former Lord of the Dance drummer Gary Sullivan, the order was filled when the band enlisted David Ingraham, formerly of Bruce Dickinson's band and Tribe of Gypsys. Soon, the Young Dubliners were touring in support of Red which was released in June, 2000. Starting in June, the group was booked as the support act for Jethro Tull on their summer tour of the United States. Early on it became apparent that the Young Dubs' blend of hard rock and Celtic styles was a perfect compliment to Tull's style of progressive rock, and band gathered many new fans during the tour. Later that summer the group played dates opening for John Hiatt and the Goners. This drove sales of Red to the highest in the band's career. ==Absolutely to Saints And Sinners== During 2001, the Young Dubliners continued to tour seasonally throughout the US. In the spring of that year, violinist Mark Epting announced his retirement from the group to pursue writing screenplays. Chas Waltz returned to the band after a five-year absence. During the summer the band was booked as the support act for Jethro Tull on their tour of Europe, playing 30 shows throughout Germany, Italy, Holland, France, Belgium, and Switzerland. After the fall tour, the group began writing material for their next album. During preproduction, multi-instrumentalist Jeff Dellisanti announced he would leave the band to retire from touring. He did stay on as a studio musician to add tin whistle, woodwinds, and keyboards to the tracks for the new album, which became Absolutely. Absolutely, produced by John Wooler and engineered by Sally Browder, had a generally newer sound for the Young Dubliners. The production was sparser, influenced by the wave of new garage rock bands like the Strokes. Most of the material was cowritten by the entire band, another first for the act. The singles released off the album were \\"Scream\\" and \\"Knickers\\", the latter being used as the soundtrack for a national TV ad campaign for the Killian's Red beer brand. Absolutely was released in June 2002, and again the Young Dubliners toured in the US supporting Jethro Tull. After the conclusion of that tour, the band joined with Canadian band Great Big Sea and American Celtic rock band Seven Nations and played as the Uprooted package tour. As the tour commenced throughout the US, the nightly order of the bands was determined by which group was the biggest draw in the area - thus GBS headlined shows in the Northeast, Seven Nations headlined in the Southeast, and the Young Dubs headlined in the western States. During 2003, the band negotiated to record a third album for Higher Octave. Unlike their previous albums, the group was afforded a lengthy time to write and record the songs during 2004. Titled Real World, the album was produced by Dublin-native Tim Boland in Los Angeles. During the recording of Real World, Keith Roberts underwent surgery to remove nodes from his vocal cords, which resulted in a slight delay in recording and touring during 2004. In the summer of '04, the band opened for Jonny Lang. The album was released on February 15, 2005, and received glowing national reviews. The Washington Post published, \\"'Real World' might finally be the commercial gold at the end of the rainbow for this criminally under-appreciated rock band.\\" Amazon.com stated, \\"(the songs) range from stadium-friendly extravaganzas to more intimate but equally outspoken pub-sized opuses. Lead singer Keith Roberts' powerhouse vocals front a maelstrom of fiddle vamps, howling guitars and frenzied drums. But even so, the hint of rueful melancholy that lies at the heart of traditional Celtic music survives, transformed yet triumphant.\\"(5) The band toured Ireland in November, 2005. In November 2006, they returned to Ireland, and toured Denmark for the first time. 2006 saw the group's contract with Higher Octave come to a close; they subsequently signed with 429 Records. The seventh release the Young Dubliners recorded was titled With All Due Respect - The Irish Sessions; this was an album filled entirely with covers of Irish ballads and shanteys - reworked in the group's trademark style. Released in February 2007, With All Due Respect was the fastest selling CD for the band to date, with much publicity hitting nationally during their March Madness tour which climaxed with the sold-out Shamrocker festival in San Diego. In the summer of 2007, the Young Dubliners toured Denmark, appearing at many large festivals, including Tunoe Island, where a live recording of their entire show was produced. Also, they performed a handful of shows in Norway, and at the G! Festival in the Faroe Islands. On March 15, 2008, the group appeared live on the CBS Early Show. During March and April, 2008, they toured the United States, Ireland, and Denmark. Beginning in early 2008, the band recorded their latest album. Titled Saints and Sinners, the CD was released on February 3, 2009, on 429 Records. The single, \\"Rosie\\", went on to become the top added new song in the AAA radio format during March 2009. On March 17, 2009, the band appeared on ABC-TV's Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and performed Rosie and the new album's title track, Saint And Sinners. Jimmy Kimmel Live! featured the group a second time on March 17, 2011. This performance was actually taped on March 16 because the band was booked to play in San Diego on the night of the 17th. On July 13, 2013, the band released their ninth album, titled 9. ==MembersCurrent=== *Keith Roberts – lead vocals and acoustic guitar *Chas Waltz – violin, keyboard, harmonica, mandolin and vocals *Justin Pecot – guitar and vocals *Dave Ingraham – drums and percussion *Ethan Jones – bass ===Former=== *Jeff Dellisanti *Mark Epting *Jon Mattox *Paul O'Toole *Alicia Previn *Randy Woolford *Bob Boulding *Brendan Holmes ==Discography== * Rocky Road (1993) * Breathe (1995) * Alive Alive'O (1998, live) * Red (2000) * Absolutely (2002) * Real World (2005) * With All Due Respect - The Irish Sessions (2007) * Saints and Sinners (2009) * 9 (2013) * Home Movies (2003, DVD) ==References *Official website * *Young Dubliners Facebook page Category:1988 establishments in California Category:Celtic music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1988 Category:Musical groups from Los Angeles ","title":"Young Dubliners"},{"id":"6197479","text":"Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos Sebestyén Tinódi Lantos (c. 1510 in Tinód – 30 January 1556 in Sárvár) was a 16th-century Hungarian lyricist, epic poet, political historian, and minstrel. == Biography == Tinódi's chronicles about the Siege of Eger (1552) Little is known about Tinódi's childhood. He attended various schools and studied Latin, and excelled at sheet music. He joined the military service in 1535 and in 1539 was wounded in a battle, which rendered him ineligible for further military service. In 1541, when Turks invaded, it made a big impression on him. He became a political poet at this time, his works expressing the need to resist the Turks. Tinódi started a family, and visited parliament and scenes of battles, and wrote poems about these. He then began to put his poems to music and performed them to the accompaniment of a lute, which led to his nickname, \\"Lantos\\" - the lute-player. His songs became recognized as an important chronicalization of the events of the day by Tamás Nádasdy in 1545, who recommended to Parliament that this become a public post for Tinódi. From 1546 to 1551 there was a general period of peace, but in 1552 a new Ottoman military campaign began, and this was again chronicled by Tinódi. In 1553, he was formally recognized by the king as a chronicler who processed the historical events of his age in a poem form, and was conferred the patent of nobility. The collected edition of his works was published in 1554. He traveled to Transylvania for a while and returned in 1555, but died shortly thereafter. ==Works== * Chronica, Kolozsvar, 1554 ==References== * Szakály Ferenc: Lantos és krónikás.

Baron Dunsandle and Clanconal, of Dunsandle in the County of Galway, was a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created on 6 June 1845 for James Daly, who had earlier represented Galway Borough and Galway County in the House of Commons. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer. He had no legitimate male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Baron. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, the fourth Baron. He was the son of the Hon. Robert Daly, youngest son of the first Baron. Lord Dunsandle and Clanconal was Assistant Private Secretary to Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli between 1874 and 1880. He never married and the title became extinct on his death on 25 November 1911. The first Baron was the son of Denis Daly, who was the grandson of James Daly and the great-great-grandson of Denis Daly.

He was Regius Professor of Botany at the University of Glasgow from 1879 to 1885, Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Oxford from 1884 to 1888, and Professor of Botany at the University of Edinburgh from 1888 to 1922. ==Early life== He was the son of John Hutton Balfour, also a botanist, and Marion Spottiswood Bayley, and was born at home, 27 Inverleith Row, Edinburgh.http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf He was the cousin of Sir James Crichton-Browne. ==Biography== Balfour was educated at the Edinburgh Academy from 1864 to 1870. At this early stage his interests and abilities were in the biological sciences, which were taught to him by his father. Due to his father's post as Professor of Botany at Edinburgh, the young Balfour was able to visit the Edinburgh Botanical Gardens, not open to the public at the time. Balfour studied at the University of Edinburgh, from which he graduated with first class honours in 1873, and at the universities in Würzburg and Strasbourg. In 1874 Balfour participated in an astronomical expedition of 1874 to Rodrigues. Though the stated aim of the mission was to observe Venus, Balfour used the opportunity to investigate the local flora, and on his return, the fieldwork he had carried out permitted him to gain his doctorate. In 1879, his father resigned the chair at Edinburgh, Glasgow professor Alexander Dickson (1836–1887) was appointed in his place, and the younger Balfour was promoted to the chair of Regius Professor of Botany, Glasgow in Glasgow from 1879 to 1885. He also went on to lead an expedition to Socotra in 1880. In 1884, he was appointed Sherardian Professor of Botany at the University of Oxford. In the same year he married Agnes Boyd Balloch. It was, however, after his return to Edinburgh to take up his father's old chair as Professor of Botany from 1888 to 1922 that Balfour left his mark, as he was also appointed 9th Regius Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. His father had greatly enlarged the botanical gardens during his tenure, but Balfour completely transformed them. Having put their finances on a safer footing by transferring them to the crown, Balfour engaged himself in a major reform of the gardens, establishing a proper botanical institute, and largely redeveloping the layout of the gardens to have a proper arboretum, building new laboratories and improving scientific facilities. He was awarded KBE in the 1920 civilian war honours list. He died at Court Hill, Haslemere in Surrey. ==Specific interests== Balfour's interest in Sino-Himalayan plants also put him in contact with botanist and plant collector Reginald Farrer. Farrer provided valuable information to Balfour and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh by sending him his plant illustrations together with the field notes, botanical specimens and seeds he had collected. ==Honours, qualifications and appointments== * 1873: Awarded Bachelor of Science degree (BSc) with first class honours, University of Edinburgh * 1873–1878: Appointed Lecturer in Botany, Royal Veterinary College, Edinburgh * 1875: Awarded Doctor of Science degree (DSc), University of Edinburgh * 1877: Awarded Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery degree (MB,ChB), University of Edinburgh * 1877: Elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh * 1879: Appointed Professor of Botany, University of Glasgow * 1880–1882, 1904–1906: President of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh * 1884: Awarded Master of Arts degree (MA), University of Oxford * 1884: Elected Fellow of the Royal Society * 1884: Appointed Professor of Botany, University of Oxford * 1888: Appointed Professor of Botany, University of Edinburgh * 1897: Awarded Victoria Medal of Honour, Royal Horticultural Society * 1901: Awarded Doctor of Laws degree (LLD), University of Glasgow * 1919: Awarded Linnean Medal of the Linnean Society * 1920: Awarded Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) * 1921: Awarded Honorary Doctor of Laws degree (LLD), University of Edinburgh ==Commemoration== The Benmore Estate was gifted to the nation by Harry George Younger of the Younger's family, and in 1928 he had the Bayley Balfour Memorial Hut, dedicated to Sir Isaac, placed in Puck's Glen. It was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer, with wooden panels using every variety of timber grown at Benmore. It also commemorated the contribution of James Duncan, a previous owner of the estate. The woodland was taken over by the Forestry Commission, which dedicated the area around the glen to the memory of Sir Isaac, while the central part of the estate was opened in 1929 as the Younger Botanic Garden, the first outstation of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. In 1968 the Bayley Balfour Memorial Hut was restored, and moved to a new site in the walled garden of Benmore House.

During the Second World War, Felgen was a translator for the German occupiers, and then a reporter with a French- language newspaper. He studied theater and opera in Brussels and Liège; in 1946, he joined Radio Luxembourg as a chorus singer and a French-language reporter. In 1949, the mastering of his baritone completed his theatre and opera studies. In 1951, he had his first international hit record, \\"Bonjour les amies\\" (\\"Hello Friends\\"). The song went on to become the theme song for his national broadcaster. In 1953, he recorded his first German-language record, \\"Onkel Toms altes Boot\\" (\\"Uncle Tom's Old Boat\\"), in Berlin. He represented his home country in the Eurovision Song Contest 1960 with \\"So laang we's du do bast\\", becoming the first Luxembourger and the first male contestant to represent Luxembourg and the first participant to sing in Luxembourgish. He finished last with only one point. Two years later he entered the contest again, this time doing much better by finishing in 3rd place with the song \\"Petit bonhomme\\". He did at times do the commentary in German, too. One of the greatest hits of Felgen was \\"Ich hab Ehrfurcht vor schneeweißen Haaren\\" (\\"I Respect Your Grey Hair\\"), a cover of singer-guitarist and entrepreneur Bobbejaan Schoepen. Another was \\"Sag warum\\", in 1959, based on a melody by Phil Spector. Camillo Felgen also wrote German lyrics for cover versions of international songs, using the pseudonym Jean Nicolas (writing for Connie Francis, Caterina Valente, Greetje Kauffeld and Lill-Babs, among others). It is sometimes incorrectly stated that he also used the name \\"Lee Montague\\" , but that was the pen-name of another person, Lawrence “Larry” M.

As Jean Nicolas, Felgen also translated the only two songs recorded by The Beatles in German, \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"She Loves You\\", in 1964. Felgen, then working as a programme director at Radio Luxembourg, was given just 24 hours to finalize the translated lyrics, fly to Paris, and coach the band on German phonetics. From 1965 until 1973, Felgen was the host and commentator for the German broadcasts of Jeux sans frontières (Spiel Ohne Grenzen)https://www.fernsehserien.de/spiel-ohne-grenzen-1965 ==Death== He died in Esch-sur-Alzette on 16 July 2005, at the age of 84. ==Footnotes== * Category:Luxembourgian pop singers Category:Luxembourgian male singers Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Luxembourg Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1960 Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1962 Category:French-language singers Category:1920 births Category:2005 deaths Category:People from Kayl Category:20th-century singers Category:People from Esch-sur-Alzette Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Camillo Felgen"},{"id":"6197521","text":"John Gervase DightonCollections: \\"John Dighton\\" British Film Institute.

He grew up in Hallstatt and later published about the archaeological plant remains from the Late Bronze- and Iron Age mines that had been uncovered by his father. Stapf studied Botany in Vienna under Julius Wiesner, where he received his PhD with a dissertation on cristals and cristalloids in plants. 1882 he became assistant professor (Assistent) of Anton Kerner. In 1887 he was made Privatdozent (lecturer without a chair) in Vienna. He published the results of an expedition Jakob Eduard Polak, the personal physician of Nasr al-Din, the Shah of Persia, had conducted in 1882, and plants collected by Felix von Luschan in Lycia and Mesopotamia 1881-1883. In 1885, Polak sponsored Stapf to conduct a botanical expedition of his own to South- and Western Persia, which was to last nine month. This led to the discovery of numerous new species, which Stapf started to publish. Including Iris meda. After his return, Stapf was harassed by his boss, Anton Kerner, who voiced his disapproval of his travels. It was rumoured that Kerner wanted Stapf's job for Richard Wettstein, the new husband of his daughter Adele. He publicly accused him of wrong identifications of plants collected during the expedition. In the end, Stapf moved to Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 1890.

The car was used by Williams for the 2003 championship. Three drivers would drive the FW25 in the 2003 season, with Marc Gené replacing regular racer Ralf Schumacher for the Italian Grand Prix after the German suffered a large testing accident testing at Monza's Lesmo 1 corner prior to that race. The other regular driver Juan Pablo Montoya started all of the season's Grand Prix. left The design of the 2003 Williams FW25 was a marked departure over its predecessor, and was a completely new design compared to the Williams FW24, something that Williams had not done between 2001 and 2002. New to the 2003 design team was ex-Ferrari aerodynamicist, Antonia Terzi, who worked with existing designer Gavin Fisher after the departure of ex-chief aerodynamicist, Geoff Willis. Although the car could have easily won its first Grand Prix during the Australian Grand Prix but for a costly spin by Colombian driver Juan Pablo Montoya, the car did not establish itself amongst the frontrunners on the grid until the Austrian Grand Prix where Montoya led before retiring with engine failure. Until that race, both drivers complained about understeer due to flaws in the car's design. Montoya cited the FW25 as a favourite of his, praising the balance and the driveability with the powerful BMW engine which suited his aggressive driving style. A new, wider front tyre introduced by Michelin at the Monaco Grand Prix unlocked the potential of the FW25, which would win that race, score a double-podium at the Canadian Grand Prix, then go on to score dominant 1-2 victories at the European Grand Prix at the Nürburgring, and the next race, the French Grand Prix at Magny-Cours. A change to the front tyre width caused by a protest lodged by Michelin's rivals Bridgestone, through the Ferrari team after the Hungarian Grand Prix caused controversy through the paddock, with Williams tipped to lose their competitive edge after that race due to a slimmer tyre design being raced at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza being seemingly at odds with the wider tyre that Williams brought with great effect to the Monaco Grand Prix. Despite Montoya's second place at Monza, being able to stay with eventual World Champion Michael Schumacher's Ferrari throughout the whole race, the FW25 would not win a race in the final three races of the season, the Italian GP, United States GP and Japanese GP took place after the tyre redesign. In fact, after Montoya's second place at the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, the FW25 would not earn another podium in the 2003 season, although Montoya led the final race at Suzuka before retiring with a hydraulics problem. On 18 June 2018, it was announced by Codemasters that this car would appear as a classic car in F1 2018. ==Complete Formula One results== (key) (results in bold indicate pole position, results in italics indicate fastest lap) {  style=\\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\\" !

mushroom Coriolus versicolor. PSP is currently in the animal- testing phase of research in many countries for use as an anti-tumor drug. It appears to work as a biological response modifier (BRM), enhancing the body's own use of macrophages and T-lymphocytes, rather than directly attacking any tumors. Polysaccharide Krestin (PSK) was first isolated in Japan in the late 1960s while PSP was isolated about 1983 in China. Each compound has shown remarkable anticancer properties with few side effects. By 1987 PSK accounted for more than 25% of total national expenditure for anticancer agents in Japan. ==See also== Polysaccharide-K == References == Category:Organic polymers Category:Polysaccharides Category:Oncology Category:Medicinal fungi ","title":"Polysaccharide peptide"},{"id":"6197573","text":"Edward Michael (Ed) O'Herron Jr. (1915–2006) was a prominent American businessman and politician. He was a former chairman of the Eckerd drug store chain. ==Early life== O'Herron was born in Baltimore, Maryland, but grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina. His father, Edward O'Herron, Sr., built up the Eckerd chain, named for his father-in-law, who opened a drug store in Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1898. The younger O'Herron attended the U.S. Naval Academy but left so he could marry Margaret Aston 'Dosty' Blackman, who he would be married to for over sixty-five years. He later graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In World War II, O'Herron served in the U.S. Marine Corps and saw action at Iwo Jima. He was awarded the Silver Star. ==Retail career== After the war, O'Herron returned to Charlotte and worked with his father in the North Carolina Eckerd chain. In 1977, the North Carolina operation merged with the Florida Eckerd chain, formerly run by Jack Eckerd. The combination was the biggest in drug store history and brought the company's store count to 766, making it the second largest drug chain in the United States. ==Political career== In the 1950s, O'Herron, a Democrat, was elected to three terms in the North Carolina General Assembly. There, he introduced the first legislation to create community colleges in the state. He also supported private education through service on the boards of Converse College and St. Andrews Presbyterian College. In 1976, O'Herron unsuccessfully ran for Governor of North Carolina, losing in the Democratic primary to Jim Hunt, who won 53.4% to O'Herron's 23.3% and 18.0% for George Wood. ==References== Category:Recipients of the Silver Star Category:1915 births Category:2006 deaths Category:United States Marine Corps officers Category:American Marine Corps personnel of World War II Category:20th-century American businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from Maryland ","title":"Edward O'Herron Jr."},{"id":"6197593","text":"Crewe Hall, the seat of the Crewe family. Baron Crewe, of Crewe in the County of Chester, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 25 February 1806 for the politician and landowner John Crewe, of Crewe Hall, Cheshire. This branch of the Crewe (or Crew) family descended from Sir Ranulph Crewe (1558–1646), Speaker of the House of Commons and Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench. He was the brother of Sir Thomas Crewe, also Speaker of the House of Commons and the father of John Crew, 1st Baron Crew (a title which became extinct in 1721; see Baron Crew). Sir Ranulph's grandson John Crewe was the father of Ann Crewe, who married John Offley, of Madeley Manor, Staffordshire. Their son John assumed by Act of Parliament the surname of Crewe in lieu of his patronymic in 1708. He sat as a Knight of the Shire for Cheshire. His son John Crewe also represented Cheshire in Parliament. The latter was the father of the first Baron Crewe. Lord Crewe died in 1829 and was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He was a General in the British Army. The title became extinct on the death of his son, the third Baron, in 1894. The Honourable Annabella, daughter of the second Baron, married Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton. Their son Robert succeeded to the Crewe estates on the death of his maternal uncle in 1894 and assumed the same year the additional surname of Crewe by Royal licence. He became a distinguished Liberal politician and was created Earl of Crewe in 1895 and Marquess of Crewe in 1911. See the latter title for more information.

He worked for many years in India working in the Calcutta Botanical Garden and involved in cinchona cultivation in Darjeeling. ==Life== Born to David Prain, a saddler, and his wife Mary Thomson, in Fettercairn, Scotland, in 1857, Prain attended the Fettercairn Parish School and then Aberdeen Grammar School. He then studied Medicine at the University of Aberdeen, where he gained his M.A. in 1878. After teaching for two years at Ramsgate College, he returned to Aberdeen and thence to the University of Edinburgh, earning an MB ChM in 1883 with highest honours. He was demonstrator of anatomy at the College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in 1882 and 1883, and at the University of Aberdeen in 1883 and 1884. In 1884 Prain was recommended to Sir George King (1840–1909), home on leave from his position as director of the Royal Botanic Garden at Calcutta and looking for a medical student with botanical interests to enter the Indian Medical Service. Prain duly went to India as a physician / botanist in the service, and in 1887 was appointed curator of the Calcutta herbarium. In 1888 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Andrew Douglas Maclagan, Argyll Robertson, Alexander Crum Brown, and Sir William Turner. In 1898 he was promoted to Director of the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta as well as the Botanical Survey of India, and superintendent of Cinchona Cultivation in Bengal, remaining there until 1905. From 1898 to 1905 he also served as Professor of Botany at the Medical College of Calcutta. In 1905 he became Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1906 Birthday Honours by King Edward VII . In 1912 he was knighted by King George V. Perhaps Prain's most difficult time as Director of the Kew gardens was in the years 1904-1908 when he was one of the lead players in an industrial dispute which pitted him against his garden staff and the Kew Garden trade union. Surprisingly his chief adversary was his sub-foreman, William Purdom, representing a band of young gardener trainees. The dispute arose because a cohort of these trainees were not fully informed that their positions were only temporary. In addition to that the gardens industrial conditions were onerous, with a salary for someone such as Purdom well below the usual rates. William Purdom was ferocious as the union representative, bringing the newspapers of the time, the Kew Guild and leading politicians into the fray. Strikes and go-slows became a heated occurrence with Prain perhaps unfortunately blamed for an error made by his predecessor. Prain, who came from a humble background himself, was aware that his workers' grievances were well justified and went out of his way to find alternative positions in private employ for all those affected. Purdom appears to have continued the fight on principal and on a personal basis for another year until Prain finally made it a case that his combative gardener Purdom had to go, or he himself would. The establishment had no option but to back the Kew Director. The bizarre and unexpected twist however came in the final days just before Christmas 1908. Despite being a bane to the Kew Director, the latter clearly recognized the talents of William Purdom and recommended his employee as a plant collector for a joint venture by Harry Veitch and the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University to the northern provinces of China in 1909. No sooner had Purdom's dismissal been finalized, than that same establishment arranged for the British administration, including the Legation in Beijing, to give him all assistance. David Prain was evidently a very fair and honourable man. Watt, Alistair (2019). Purdom and Farrer Plant Hunters on the Eaves of China. ' Published by author in an edition limited to 250 copies. Melbourne 2019. He served as President of the Linnean Society 1916 to 1919.

In 1907 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of philosophy at the Linnaeus' tercentenary in Uppsala, Sweden, and became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1912. He was also knighted in 1912. He served as president of the Linnean Society from 1916 to 1919, president of the Association of Applied Biologists from 1920 to 1921 and president of the Quekett Microscopical Club from 1924 to 1926. He was awarded the Veitch Memorial Medal of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1925 and the Linnean Medal in 1935. ==Private life== In 1887 Prain married Margaret Caird Thomson, daughter of Reverend William Thomson of Belhevie, south of Aberdeen. They had one son, Theodore Prain (1888-1914), who was killed in the first weeks of the First World War whilst serving as a lieutenant in the Leicestershire Regiment. ==Botanical Reference References  External links == * *Correspondence to David Prain as Director of The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew is being made available online through the Directors' Correspondence Project.

Rut Brandt became highly popular in Germany and a noted public figure in her role as First Lady of Berlin and the chancellor's spouse.\\"Rut Brandt – Ehre für eine, die mehr als First Lady war\\", Berliner Kurier, 4 December 2001 ==Life== Born as Rut Hansen in Hamar, Norway, she worked initially in a bakery in Norway and then as a tailor's apprentice. At age 16, she joined a socialist youth group, which conducted political activities against the German occupation during the Second World War. In 1942, she fled to Sweden with one of her sisters. In Sweden, she married her Norwegian friend, Ole Olstadt Bergaust, who died in 1946. In 1944, Hansen met Willy Brandt, the later German Chancellor, who had fled Germany. After Bergaust's death, Brandt and Hansen married in 1948. Rut Brandt (1970) When Willy Brandt became chancellor in 1969, Rut Brandt was at his side as a very successful and popular First Lady. However, when she in 1979 discovered that Brandt had an affair with (later his third wife), Rut Brandt filed for divorce. After the divorce had been granted (in 1980), Rut and Willy Brandt went their separate ways and never met each other again. When Brandt died in 1992, Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt did not allow Rut to attend the funeral – a decision which did not meet with acceptance in the German population. Rut Brandt died on 28 July 2006 in Berlin, aged 86, from undisclosed causes. ==Family== Willy and Rut Brandt had three children: * Peter Brandt (born 1948), historian * Lars Brandt (born 1951), writer, filmmaker, artist * Matthias Brandt (born 1961), actor ==Books by Rut Brandt== * ' (1992) * ' (2001) ==References * Category:1920 births Category:2006 deaths Category:People from Hamar Category:Norwegian resistance members Category:Female resistance members of World War II Category:Norwegian emigrants to Germany Category:German autobiographers Category:Women autobiographers Category:Norwegian writers Category:Royal Norwegian Order of Merit Category:Spouses of the Chancellors of Germany ","title":"Rut Brandt"},{"id":"6197621","text":"Gregory Sylvester Coleman (September 1944 – April 2006) was a member of The Winstons and the drummer of the Amen break, a famous drum solo taken from the recording \\"Amen, Brother\\" made in 1969 by The Winstons.

At the other end of the table, the struggle to avoid automatic relegation went on until the final round, and it was Lierse who eventually prevailed. Having spent the entire season at the bottom of the standings and only just managed to close an eleven-point gap up to 17th, the Lier side won their last game to climb past Beveren and send the latter down to the Second Division.

Peasants were encouraged to bang pots and pans to scare sparrows into continuing flight, eventually killing them from exhaustion. Whilst the harvest of the year after the campaign was larger, there was a massive rise in locust numbers in the late 1950s, as a result of the significantly lower population of sparrows, a major predator of the locust. Along with other programs in the Great Leap Forward, the Great Sparrow Campaign caused widespread famine where, between 1959 and 1962, 45 million people died of starvation or were beaten to death. ==Track listingBonus Tracks= Personnel == * Tim Green – audio engineering, audio mixing and production * Greg Burns – bass guitar, pedal steel * David Clifford – drums * Josh Graham – guitar, keyboard * Bryant Clifford Meyer – guitar, organ, piano * Andy Arahood – guitar ==References== Category:2006 albums Category:Concept albums Category:Post-rock albums by American artists Category:Red Sparowes albums ","title":"Every Red Heart Shines Toward the Red Sun"},{"id":"6197628","text":"The Corrientes River is a river in Ecuador and Peru. ==References== Category:Rivers of Ecuador Category:Rivers of Peru Category:Rivers of Loreto Region Category:International rivers of South America ","title":"Corrientes River"},{"id":"6197633","text":"Road Builder (M) Holdings Bhd. is a holding company based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

It lives among Sargassum seaweed which floats in subtropical oceans. The scientific name comes from the Latin histrio meaning a stage player or actor, and refers to the fish's feeding behaviour.Histrio Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary. Retrieved 2012-01-04. ==Description== Illustration of a sargassum fish Histrio histrio, a strange-looking fish, blends well with its surroundings in its seaweed habitat. It is laterally compressed and its length can reach . The colour of the body and the large oral cavity is very variable, but is usually mottled and spotted yellow, green, and brown on a paler background, and the fins often have several dark streaks or bands. The fish can change colour rapidly, from light to dark and back again.Frogfish (Histrio histrio) Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2012-01-04. The body and the fins are covered with many weed-like protrusions, but other than these, the skin is smooth without dermal spines. The dorsal fin has three spines and 11–13 soft rays. The front spine is modified into a slender growth on the upper lip known as an illicium, which is tipped by a fleshy lump, the esca. The junction between the head and body is indistinct because no gill slits are present; the gills open as pores near the base of the pectoral fins.Biological profiles: Sargassumfish Florida Museum of Natural History. Retrieved 2012-01-04. The anal fin has no spines and seven to 13 soft rays. The pelvic fins are large and the pectoral fins have 9-11 rays and are stalked and able to grip objects. The outer rays of the tail fin are simple, but the central rays are forked.Histrio histrio - (Linnaeus, 1758) FishBase. Retrieved 2012-01-04.Nature's Fast Feeder: The Frogfish Bahamas Wildlife. Retrieved 2012-01-04. ==Distribution and habitat== The sargassum fish has a cosmopolitan distribution in tropical and subtropical seas down to a depth around . It is found in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Indo-Pacific Ocean, where drifting seaweed accumulates. In the western Atlantic, it ranges from the Gulf of Maine south to Uruguay. It has been reported from northern Norway, but that sighting is likely to be as a result of its having been carried along by the North Atlantic Current. ==Biology== The sargassum fish is a voracious ambush predator that is also a cannibal. One individual was dissected and found to have 16 juveniles in its stomach. It stalks its prey among the tangled weeds, relying on its cryptic camouflage for concealment. It can clamber through and cling to the seaweed stalks with its prehensile pectoral fins. It dangles its esca as a fishing lure to attract small fish, shrimp, and other invertebrates. It is able to dart forward to grab its prey by expelling water forcibly through its gill openings. It can expand its mouth to many times its original size in a fraction of a second, drawing prey in via suction, and can swallow prey larger than itself. It is dioecious. At breeding time, the male courts the female by following her around closely. When ready to spawn, the female ascends rapidly to the surface, where she lays a mass of eggs stuck together by gelatinous mucus. This egg raft adheres to the seaweed, where it is fertilised by the male. On hatching, each larva is surrounded by an integumentary envelope and has a large, rounded head, fully formed fins, and eyes with double notches. As the larva develops into a juvenile, this envelope fuses with the skin. This fish is preyed on by larger fish and sea birds. To avoid underwater threats, it can leap above the surface onto mats of weed. It can survive for some time out of water. ==References== Category:Antennariidae Category:Fish of Hawaii Category:Fish described in 1758 Category:Fish of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Monotypic fish genera Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Sargassum fish"},{"id":"6197679","text":"The 29th Infantry Brigade was an infantry brigade unit of the British Army.

The division and brigade transferred to Lemnos in July 1915 in preparation for the Gallipoli landings. The 29th Infantry Brigade landed at Anzac Cove on August 6/7 of the same year, participating in the Battle of Chunuk Bair. The 10th (Irish) Division was withdrawn from Gallipoli to Salonika at the end of September 1915, elements of the division participating in actions at Karajakois, Yenikoi and Kosturino. In early September 1917, the Division was withdrawn to Egypt and took part in the Palestine Campaign where it fought in the third Battle of Gaza. The division moved back to Cairo at the end of the war. ==Second World War== In the Second World War, the Cairo Brigade (a Regular Army force stationed in Egypt) was renamed as the 29th Infantry Brigade on 20 September 1939. In October 1939, it was redesignated as the 22nd Infantry Brigade. On 14 July 1940, a new 29th Independent Infantry Brigade Group, under the command of Brigadier Oliver Leese, was formed in the United Kingdom from Regular Army infantry battalions.

He was an Army officer in the Korea War and was wounded in the Vietnam War. ==Biography== Wahlen receiving the Medal of Honor from President Harry S. Truman Whalen was born in Ogden, Utah on August 8, 1924. Wahlen, at age 17 in 1943, trained as an aircraft mechanic and served at Hill Field in Utah, leading five other mechanics as crew chief for the United States Army Air Corps. He volunteered for the military draft, hoping to work on aircraft. He enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve (U.S. Navy Reserve) in Salt Lake City, on June 11, 1943 as a seaman apprentice.U.S. Marine Corps History Division http://www.mcu.usmc.mil/historydivision/Pages/Who's%20Who/V-X/wahlen_ge.aspx One week later, he went on active duty and completed recruit training at the Naval Training Station in San Diego, California. On July 20, he was advanced to seaman apprentice second class and attended the Naval Hospital Corpsman School in San Diego. After graduating, he was transferred to the Naval Hospital there and advanced to seaman apprentice first class on November 1, 1943. On December 1, he was advanced to pharmacist mate third class and assigned that month to the Field Medical Service School at Camp Elliot, California for fielding training. After completion of his training there in February 1944, he was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 26th Marines, 5th Marine Division at Camp Pendleton, California. In July 1944, the division left for Hawaii for further training. On November 1, he was advanced to pharmacist mate second class and was assigned to Fox Company, 2/26 Marines of the division. He landed with his unit on Iwo Jima on February 19, 1945, and was seriously wounded by an enemy grenade on February 26 in combat.U.S Marine Corps History Division http://www.mcu.usmc.mil/historydivision/Pages/Who's%20Who/V-X/wahlen_ge.aspx Refusing evacuation, he continued going on to help wounded Marines on the battlefield, and on March 2, he was wounded in the back and refused to be evacuated again, and continued on aiding more Marines until he was shot in the leg on March 3 for a third time and unable to walk. However, he crawled his way for 50 yards to attend to one more wounded Marine before he was finally evacuated. He was evacuated to Guam, Hawaii, and California. Wahlen, two other sailors (including Navy corpsman Robert E. Bush for the Battle of Okinawa), and eleven Marines each were presented the Medal of Honor from President Harry S. Truman outside the White House on October 5, 1945. Wahlen spent nine months recovering from his wounds before being honorably discharged on December 19, 1945. In 1948, he re-enlisted in the United States Army as a medical technician, became an officer, and served in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. He retired from the army in 1968, with the rank of major after being wounded and awarded a Purple Heart. As a civilian he worked for over a decade with the Veteran's Administration, where he retired at the age of 59. He is the subject of the book The Quiet Hero: The Untold Medal of Honor Story of George E. Wahlen at the Battle for Iwo Jima by Gary W. Toyn. Wahlen died at age 84, and was buried on June 12, 2009. A large memorial service was held on June 18, 2009, attended by veterans of all ranges. The main entrance to the George E. Wahlen Medical Center was draped in black banners in his memory.

It was co-written by group members Sara Dallin, Siobhan Fahey, and Keren Woodward and the writing-production duo Jolley & Swain who also produced the song. The song was released in May 1984 as the third single from their self-titled second album. The song is one of several composed by Bananarama at the time which lyrically addressed \\"serious\\" topics, in this case societal injustices towards children, poverty, starvation and innocent bystanders who are given \\"no time to smile before they die\\". Although the music was upbeat, the heavy lyrical content did not prove to be as successful as their prior single (\\"Robert De Niro's Waiting...\\"). It peaked at number 23 in the UK singles chart. In Australia, the song failed to chart and it was not released as a single in the United States. \\"Rough Justice\\" was remixed slightly from its album version when released as a single, most notably in the track's introduction. ==Music video== The music video features the girls preparing for an appearance on a show at a TV studio. The video begins with a young boy dressed in a tuxedo entering the girls' dressing room to give them congratulatory flowers only to take pictures of them without asking, which causes Keren Woodward to eject him from the room. As soon as the boy is gone, the girls see a TV news report on poverty situations which is actually being made in the studio next door (the report was presented by BBC newscaster Peter Woods, who made a cameo in the clip). The studio director comes by and leads the girls to the studio where they will be filming their appearance but as he is looking away, the girls head into the other studio.

Glenn Hunter had originated the role of Merton Gill in the Broadway play and reprised his role in this film. Since the play had depended on funny dialogue, the movie (being silent) was opened up and a good deal of slapstick used instead. Thomas Hischak described the result as \\"uneven\\" although \\"Hunter still pleases and there are some droll performances by the supporting cast\\". The film is now considered a lost film.

The twelfth tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed by September 8 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. It moved generally to the north-northwest and strengthened quickly to peak winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) on September 12\\\\. This made it a major hurricane and a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. The hurricane remained at or near that intensity for several days while tracking to the northwest. It weakened approaching the southeastern United States, and on September 16 passed just east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina with winds of about 100 mph (160 km/h). Turning to the northeast, the hurricane became extratropical on September 18 before moving across Atlantic Canada, eventually dissipating four days later. The threat of the hurricane prompted widespread tropical cyclone warnings and watches along the eastern United States and prompted some people to evacuate. Damage was heaviest in southeastern North Carolina near New Bern, where the combination of high tides and swollen rivers flooded much of the town. Across North Carolina, the hurricane caused power outages, washed out roads, and damaged crops. Several houses were damaged, leaving about 1,000 people homeless. Damage was estimated at $4.5 million, and there were 21 deaths in the state, mostly from drowning. Hurricane-force winds extended into southeastern Virginia, where there were two deaths. High tides isolated a lighthouse near Norfolk and covered several roads. Farther north, two people on a small boat were left missing in Maine, and another person was presumed killed when his boat sank in Nova Scotia. ==Meteorological history== Beginning on September 7, there was an area of disturbed weather near and east of the Lesser Antilles, by which time there was a nearly closed circulation. At 0800 UTC the next day, a ship reported winds of about 35 mph (55 km/h); on that basis, it is estimated a tropical depression developed eight hours earlier and into a tropical storm by the time of the report. The storm tracked generally to the north-northwest, passing about northeast of Saint Martin. Based on continuity and subsequent reports, it is estimated the storm intensified into a hurricane on September 10\\\\. Early on September 12, a ship reported a barometric pressure of in the periphery of the storm while reporting winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). This suggested winds of 140 mph (220 km/h), making it the equivalent of a modern Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. For over two days, the hurricane remained near peak intensity while tracking to the northwest, and during that time several ships reported low pressure and strong winds. The hurricane weakened as it turned to the north-northwest toward the eastern United States. At around 1100 UTC on September 16, the eye of the hurricane passed over Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, around which time a pressure of was recorded. The eye also passed over Diamond Shoals, where a pressure of was recorded. Based on the reading, it was estimated the hurricane remained about 15 mi (25 km) east of the Outer Banks, with winds of about 100 mph (160 km/h) occurring along the coast. By that time, the size of the storm had greatly increased, and hurricane-force winds also extended into southeastern Virginia. The hurricane turned to the northeast, ahead of an approaching cold front, producing tropical storm force winds along the eastern United States through New England. After passing southeast of Cape Cod, the storm increasingly lost its tropical characteristics, and was an extratropical cyclone by 1100 UTC on September 18 when it made landfall on eastern Nova Scotia. Continuing to the northeast, the former hurricane crossed the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and subsequently near Newfoundland, eventually dissipating on September 22 between southern Greenland and Iceland. ==Preparations and impact== Precipitation map associated with the hurricane in the eastern United States While the hurricane was approaching the Carolinas, the Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Jacksonville, Florida to Beaufort, North Carolina at 2100 UTC on September 14\\\\. Six hours later, these were extended northward to Virginia Capes. By 1530 UTC on September 15, forecasters predicted that the hurricane would hit North Carolina in 12 hours and ordered hurricane warnings from Wilmington, North Carolina to Cape Hatteras. At the same time, the storm warning was expanded northward to Boston, Massachusetts, and later to Eastport, Maine. The early warnings gave ample time for preparation for the storm in Norfolk, reducing damages considerably. Residents in Virginia evacuated farther inland to escape the storm. The outer rainbands of the hurricane dropped moderate to heavy rainfall, peaking at in Cape Hatteras. Due to the storm remaining offshore, damage was much less than another hurricane less than a month prior. Damage from this hurricane was heaviest near New Bern, North Carolina, where the storm surge reached , which was higher than the record set in 1913. Much of the town was flooded due to the high tide and swollen nearby rivers. Strong winds in the city uprooted several trees and damaged roofs. Morehead City suffered similar but slightly lesser damage, including hundreds of downed trees, and Beaufort experienced one of its worst storms in the memory of its residents. Across the region, the storm downed telephone and telegraph lines. Several roads were washed out, and there was moderate agriculture damage, including hundreds of drowned livestock and flooded cotton crop. There were 21 deaths, mostly related to drownings, and damage was estimated at $4.5 million. About 1,000 people were left homeless. After the storm, relief agencies provided food and medical crews for the storm victims. In southeastern Virginia, winds reached 79 mph (128 km/h). At Sewell's Point in Norfolk, the storm produced high tides, which turned the peninsula containing New Point Comfort Light into an island. Several roads were flooded, which disrupted traffic and forced residents to travel by rowboat. About 2,000 people lost power, and due to well-executed preparations, there were two deaths in the state. Damage was estimated at $250,000. Outside of Virginia, damage was minimal north of Cape Henry. Wind peaks included in Atlantic City, New Jersey and on Block Island. A boat required rescue in the Delaware Bay. Precipitation fell on the western periphery of the hurricane, associated with an approaching cold front. In Provincetown, Massachusetts, the storm dropped of rainfall it passed the region. In New England, high waves damaged waterfront properties. On Block Island, two boats were damaged, and another sank. In Maine, the rainfall flooded cellars and damaged roads. Two people were reported missing in Boothbay Harbor after venturing into the storm in a small boat. Still maintaining strong winds by the time it struck Canada, the former hurricane washed one boat ashore, left three missing, and capsized one. One person was presumed killed when his boat sunk in Lockeport, Nova Scotia. The storm dropped heavy rainfall across the region, including 1.1 in (27 mm) in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and about 3 in (75 mm) in 15 hours in Gagetown, New Brunswick; there, the rains flooded roads and damaged crops. At Harvey Station in the same province, high rainfall washed out a 75 ft (22 m) portion of a rail line. ==See also== * List of North Carolina hurricanes (1900–49) *Hurricane Helene (1958) ==NotesReferences== * Category:Category 4 Atlantic hurricanes Category:Hurricanes in North Carolina Outer Banks Hurricane, 1933 ","title":"1933 Outer Banks hurricane"},{"id":"6197700","text":"The Fort Smith Trolley Museum is a streetcar and railroad museum in Fort Smith, in the U.S. state of Arkansas, which includes an operating heritage streetcar line. The museum opened in 1985, and operation of its streetcar line began in 1991. Four vehicles in its collection, a streetcar and three steam locomotives, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The now approximately streetcar line also passes four NRHP-listed sites, including the Fort Smith National Historic Site, the Fort Smith National Cemetery, the West Garrison Avenue Historic District and the 1907 Atkinson- Williams Warehouse Building, which now houses the Fort Smith Museum of History. ==History== The museum was established by the Fort Smith Streetcar Restoration Association (FSSRA), formed in 1979 to preserve and display transit history relating to Fort Smith. The first museum building was constructed in 1985, on former Missouri Pacific Railroad land, and purchases and donations of property in the 1990s allowed activities and storage to expand onto adjacent parcels. That the organization uses Streetcar in its name but named its museum a Trolley museum is a reflection of the fact that, in American English, the terms streetcar and trolley are used interchangeably. The Fort Smith Trolley Museum (FSTM) opened to the public in 1985, and trolley/streetcar operation began in 1991. FSSRA continues to be the museum's owner and operator. ==Streetcar line== Birney car 224 Streetcar operation at the museum was inaugurated on May 19, 1991, using ex-Fort Smith Light and Traction Company car 224, a Birney-type streetcar built in 1926 by the American Car Company. In the first seven months of operation, though the end of 1991 (in which five months had daily operation), more than 10,000 rides were given. The initial line was about one-quarter mile long, using ex-Frisco freight tracks, along which FSSRA volunteers had installed trolley wire and support poles. It connected the carbarn, at 100 S. 4th Street, with the Fort Smith National Historic Site.

At the other end of the line, a very short extension in May 2005 took the track across Wheeler Avenue to a new terminus at 7th Street, making the line about in length. A much longer extension from there was planned, which would take the line north along 7th Street. The line's first extension since 2005 opened on May 21, 2016, bringing into use newly laid track and trolley wire along 7th Street.\\"Museum News\\" (December 2016). Tramways & Urban Transit, p. 496. UK: LRTA Publishing. The line's new eastern terminus is on 7th Street at Rogers Avenue, and the approximately 750-foot extension made the full line about long. ===Schedule=== Operation of the streetcar/trolley takes place year- round, running seven days a week from May 1 through October 31 and on weekends during all other months. Hours of operation are 10:00–5:00 on Saturdays and (when operating) weekdays, and 1:00–5:00 on Sundays. A wheelchair ramp was constructed at one stop in 1997. ==VehiclesStreetcars=== National Cemetery in 1997 As of 2016, the museum has two fully restored and operational streetcars: Fort Smith car 224, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994 as Birney Safety Streetcar No. 224, and Hot Springs Street Railway Company car 50 (built in 1904 by the St. Louis Car Company), which operated in Hot Springs, Arkansas, until 1939. Car 50 entered service in May 2016, after 16 years of restoration work, but Birney car 224 remains the primary streetcar that the museum uses for normal service (because one-man operation is more practical with it). Several Birney cars such as 224 were in regular service on the original Fort Smith streetcar system for its last several years, through to the abandonment of the system, on November 15, 1933. Although restoration work has been under way on other streetcars at the museum for several years, car 224 was the only operational car for the first 25 years of trolley operation at the museum – until car 50's restoration was completed in 2016. Among the other streetcars in the collection are three more which, as with No. 224, operated in municipal service in Fort Smith: * Fort Smith Traction, Light and Power 10, built in 1902 (body only) * Fort Smith Light and Traction 205, Birney car built in 1919 (body only) * Fort Smith Light and Traction 221, Birney car built in 1926 (body only) In addition, an open streetcar built by the J. G. Brill Company in 1907 was acquired from the Texas Transportation Museum (in San Antonio, Texas) in 1995. It is ex- Veracruz, Mexico, No. 6.\\"Museum News\\". Light Rail and Modern Tramway, March 1996, p. 109. Ian Allan Publishing/Light Rail Transit Association (UK). The Fort Smith and Veracruz cars are all single-truck cars, but in 1992 FSSRA acquired the body of Hot Springs Street Railway Company car 50 (St. Louis Car Company, 1904), a double-truck car which once operated in Hot Springs. The organization subsequently acquired trucks and motors for the car, and began working on restoring it to operating condition, a goal that was reached in 2016. Another Birney car in the collection is ex-Kansas City 1545, built in 1919. Three additional streetcars were acquired in 2009: ex-Little Rock Birney cars 305 and 310, which FSSRA plans to combine into one operating car, and a second ex-Veracruz open car, No. 9. The latter is the same type as FSTM's car 6, a 1907 Brill car, which has yet to be restored to operating condition. The group now plans to restore car 9 to operating condition first, using some parts from car 6. Car 9 was acquired from the Lake Shore Electric museum group. ===Locomotives=== Frisco 4003 in 2008 Of four locomotives owned by the museum and kept on public display, three are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP): * Frisco 4003, a USRA Light Mikado steam locomotive built in 1919 – donated to FSTM in 1998 and listed on the NRHP in 2004. * Maumelle Ordnance Works Locomotive 1, a Vulcan gasoline-mechanical, 35-ton switcher built in 1942 – donated to FSTM in 1988 and listed on the NRHP in 2006. * United States Air Force Locomotive No. 1246, a General Electric diesel-electric, 44-ton switcher built in 1953, which was listed on the NRHP on the same date as Locomotive No. 1 (shown above), September 20, 2006 (ref. no. 06000840). It was acquired by FSTM in 1992. Also in the collection are three cabooses, a passenger car and various items of non-passenger railroad rolling stock. ===Buses=== As of 1997, the museum owned three vintage motor buses: A 1939 ex-Little Rock Twin Coach R-23, a 1954 Fort Smith General Motors TGH-3102 bus, and a 1951 ex-Oklahoma City GM bus. The original Fort Smith bus, No. 285, was used in the 1988 movie Biloxi Blues. ==See also== * Fort Smith Transit * Streetcars in North America ==References * Fort Smith Trolley Museum * Our Collection (Roster of Equipment), Fort Smith Trolley Museum Category:Fort Smith, Arkansas Category:Heritage railroads in Arkansas Category:Heritage streetcar systems Category:Museums in Sebastian County, Arkansas Category:Railroad museums in Arkansas Category:Streetcars in Arkansas Category:Museums established in 1985 Category:Street railway museums in the United States Category:1985 establishments in Arkansas ","title":"Fort Smith Trolley Museum"},{"id":"6197711","text":" The Slingsby T.38 Grasshopper is a British primary training glider built by Slingsby Sailplanes for the Royal Air Force.Hardy 1982, p. 115. ==Development== The design is based on the pre-World War II German SG 38 Schulgleiter, modified to use the wing design of the Slingsby T.7 Kirby Cadet glider.

His taxonomic and drawing skills were soon noticed and resulted in his being appointed to the Herbarium in 1905. He moved from assistant in the Indian section to assistant for Tropical Africa, returning to Indian botany from 1915-1919, and from then on was in charge of the African section until 1936 when he was appointed Keeper of the Museums of Botany at Kew. He retired in 1948 but continued working on the phylogeny of flowering plants and publishing two parts of The Genera of Flowering Plants. John Hutchinson proposed a radical revision of the angiosperm classification systems devised by Joseph Dalton Hooker and that of Adolf Engler and Karl Anton Eugen Prantl which had become widely accepted during the 20th century. At its simplest, his system suggested two main divisions of angiosperms, herbaceous and woody. Hutchinson made two extended collecting trips to South Africa, which were recounted in great detail in A Botanist in Southern Africa. His first visit was from August 1928 to April 1929, and the second from June 1930 to September 1930 on which occasion the expedition travelled north as far as Lake Tanganyika. ==Awards== * He was awarded an honorary degree of LL.D. by University of St Andrews in 1934. * Awarded Veitch Memorial Medal in 1937. * Awarded the Victoria Medal (horticulture) in 1944 for outstanding contributions to horticulture. * Awarded Linnaean Gold Medal in 1968. * He was awarded the Linnean Society of London's Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1958. * He was elected Honorary Fellow of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation (ATBC) in 1965http://www.tropicalbio.org/ * He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1947 * Awarded O.B.E. shortly before his death * Commemorated in the genus Hutchinsonia Robyns. ==Personal life== Hutchinson was married and had two sons and three daughters, one of whom lived in South Africa. He spent his leisure time roaming the English countryside with his wife in a caravan drawing wild flowers. At his funeral a wreath largely made of South African flowers was sent by his colleagues at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew. ==First Southern Africa trip August 1928 – April 1929== Hutchinson arrived in Table Bay and spent the first few weeks collecting in and around Cape Town and Table Mountain, with short trips further afield. His first lengthy trip was to Namaqualand and Bushmanland with fellow botanist and succulent specialist, Neville Stuart Pillans. Back in Cape Town he purchased a small Citroën car and set off on 30 October in the company of Rudolf Marloth, who left them at Barrydale, and Jan Gillett, the son of Arthur Gillett at the University of Oxford (one of the founders of Oxfam). On this occasion their route followed the southern Cape coast as far as Port Elizabeth. Here Gillett's place was taken by Robert Allen Dyer and the route veered inland to Grahamstown and Katberg, then back to the coast, visiting Butterworth, Port St Johns, Kokstad, Pietermaritzburg and Durban. From here Hutchinson travelled on his own and in Pretoria joined up with General Smuts, who was a keen and knowledgeable botanist, to the far northern Transvaal to explore Lake Fundudzi, sacred to the Venda people. *16–22 August 1928 Cape Peninsula *25 August Worcester *31 August Matjesfontein *4 September Malmesbury to Darling *5 September Hopefield to Vredenburg *6 September coast north of Saldanha Bay *10 September Hottentots Holland Mountains *16 September above Tulbagh Waterfall *21 September Sir Lowry's Pass *30 September gorge west of Ceres *5 October lighthouse at Sea Point *9 October Sutherland to Middlepost *10 October near Elandsfontein *11 October near Nieuwoudtville *13 October near Bitterfontein *13 October Garies to Kamieskroon *15 October O'okiep to Steinkopf *16 October poort between Concordia and Pella *16 October Pella to Pofadder *18 October Kenhardt *27 October Bain's Kloof *29 October Paarl *30 October Robertson *31 October Montagu to Barrydale *1 November Waterkloof, Ladismith *1 November Seweweekspoort *2 November Calitzdorp to Cango *3 November southern side of Swartberg Pass *4 November Oudtshoorn to Montagu Pass *5 November Pacaltsdorp *5 November Touws River near George *5 November Phantom Pass near Knysna *7 November Belvedere near Knysna *8 November Plettenberg Bay *8 November Bitou River *9 November Keurbooms River *9 November Grootrivier Pass *10 November Witelsbos *12 November Kareedouw Pass *12 November Kareedouw to Humansdorp *13 November Jeffreys Bay *14 November Gamtoos River Pass *16 November Port Elizabeth to Uitenhage *16 November near Addo *17 November Howieson's Poort near Grahamstown *18 November Bathurst *19 November Fish River Valley *19 November Pluto's Vale *20 November Botha's Hill *26 November Grahamstown to Fort Beaufort *26 November hills above Balfour *27 November top of Katberg *28 November Seymour to Alice *28 November King William's Town to East London *29 November Mooiplaats to Komgha *1 December Libode *1 December mountain forest near Port St Johns *3 December Port St Johns to Lusikisiki *3 December Flagstaff *4 December Flagstaff to Kokstad *5 December Mt Currie *6 December Pietermaritzburg Botanical Garden *6 December Umgeni *10 December Howick, Mooi River *11 December Ladysmith, Natal *14 December Warmbaths *15 December near Potgietersrust *16 December Louis Trichardt to Wylliespoort *18 December Limpopo River near Messina *19 December Dongola *21 December Thomson's Store to Lake Fundudzi *23 December Witvlag *23 December Woodbush near Tzaneen *24 December Moorddrift *28 December koppie at Fountains Valley near Pretoria *31 December Hartebeespoort in the Magaliesberg *2 January 1929 Doornkloof near Irene *5 January Louw's Creek to Maid of the Mist Mountain *7 January Barberton to Louw's Creek *7 January Barberton to Lomati Falls *8 January Impala Siding near Barberton *9 January Komatipoort *9 January western slopes of Lebombo Mountains, Portuguese East Africa *15 January Horn's Nek, Magaliesberg *22 January between Potgietersrust and Swerwerskraal *23 January Magalakwin River Bridge *24 January north of Blaauwberg *29 January Premier Mine near Pretoria *30 January between Arnot and Belfast *2 February Machadodorp *3 February Maskew's farm Suikerboskop near Belfast *6 February Magatosnek near Rustenburg *7 February Rustenburg to Zeerust *8 February hills north of Zeerust *9 February 15 miles west of Mafeking *10 February Vryburg to Schweizer-Reneke *11 February Wolmaransstad and Klerksdorp *15 February near Parys, Orange Free State *18 February Christiana to Warrenton *19 February koppies near Kimberley *20 February Kimberley to Riverton *21 February Baviaanskrantz near Kaap Plateau *22 February hills between Papkuil and Postmasburg *23 February hills east of Asbestos Mountains *24 February near Campbell *28 February Kaffir River to Edenburg, Orange Free State *1 March Fauresmith Reserve *3 March near Colesberg *4 March Kikvorsch Mountains near Noupoort *6 March near Tafelberg, Middelburg, Cape Province *8 March Roode Hoogte Pass *8 March Naude's Pass *9 March Groote River to Aberdeen *10 March Meiringspoort *13 March George *15 March Mossel Bay *24 March Robinson Pass *25 March Riviersonderend *26 March Caledon to Hermanus *5 April Table Mountain *9 April Zeekoevlei ==Second African trip June 1930 – September 1930== Having met Hutchinson on his previous visit to South Africa, General Smuts invited him to join a party consisting of Margaret Clark Gillett with two of her sons, Jan and Anthony, on a trip to Lake Tanganyika. They set off from Irene on 28 June 1930 in a convoy of seven vehicles and were joined at Beit Bridge by Illtyd Buller Pole-Evans. They collected all the way to Lake Tanganyika and then retraced their route to Broken Hill, where Hutchinson boarded a goods train to Elizabethville (Lubumbashi). On his return to Pretoria, and with time in hand, he set off on a trip to the Soutpansberg with Jan Gillett. Then followed a week in the Drakensberg, climbing to the top of Mont-aux-Sources with two fellow botanists, Ms. Verdoorn and Ms. Forbes. A final flurry of collecting at Botha's Hill near Durban, and Port Elizabeth, saw the end of a fruitful visit. { -  valign=\\"top\\"  *29 June 1930 Louis Trichardt *30 June Lundi River, Zimbabwe *1 July Great Zimbabwe *3 July Umvuma, Zimbabwe *3 July Gweru, Zimbabwe *3 July Shangani River, Zimbabwe *3 July Bulawayo, Zimbabwe *4 July Bulawayo to Victoria Falls *4 July Dett *7 July Victoria Falls *10 July Livingstone, Zambia *10 July Choma *12 July Monze *12 July Mazabuka *12 July Kafue River *12 July Lusaka *13 July Broken Hill, Zambia *14 July Bwana Mkuba *14 July Kapiri Mposhi *14 July Chiwefwe *15 July Serenje Corner *16 July Lukulu River  valign=\\"top\\"  *16 July Kaloswe *16 July Mpika *17 July Zambesi River *17 July Kasama *18 July Mbala (Abercorn) *20 July Tom's Village, Lake Tanganyika *20 July Mpulungu *21 July near Lunzua River *22 July 11 miles S of Lake Tanganyika *23 July 6 miles N of Kasama *24 July Koloswe *25 July Chiwefwe *30 July Sakania, Democratic Republic of the Congo *2 August Lubumbashi (Elizabethville) *8 August Matopo *18 August Louis Trichardt *18 August Goede Hoop *19 August Klein Australie, Soutpansberg *20 August Entabeni; Palmary; Pepiti Falls *23 August Crewe Farm, West Soutpansberg *24 August on granite koppie near Matoks *3 September Botha's Hill, KwaZulu-Natal } ==List of selected publications  Books === * Volume 1: Dicotyledonae 1926, Volume 2: Monocotyledonae 1934. * Volume 1: Dicotyledonae at Google Books, Volume 2: Monocotyledonae at Internet Archive Available to borrow: 2 vols * * The Genera of Flowering Plants (Oxford, Vol.1 (1964), Vol.2 (1967), Vol. 3 (posthumously)) at [https://archive.org/details * Common Wild Flowers (1945) * More Common Wild Flowers (1948) * Uncommon Wild Flowers (1950) * British Wild Flowers (1955) * The Story of Plants with R.

Twenty years later Ostend had been transformed from a sleepy fishing village into a fortified, moated and important Flemish port. After the Siege of Ostend (1601-1604) the port was not rebuilt. It became a haven for privateers until the eighteenth century. Charles VI briefly granted it a license to trade with the far east as the Oostendsche Companie. This enriched the port and set it up again. During the American Revolution Ostend became a free port. The docks were redeveloped under Dutch rule (1815 - 1830). Ferry services to Dover began in 1846, with Ostend being the hub for the Regie voor Maritiem Transport until 1997. Again at the end of the 19th century the port was redeveloped to cope with the larger ships of the period. The City Council, unable to raise sufficient funds for the redevelopment handed control and responsibility for the port over to the Belgian government. The port was damaged in both World Wars (see First and Second Ostend Raid) but soon recovered. ==ReferencesNotes=Bibliography=== * * ==External links== * *Official Heritage site about the port of Ostend *Flemish Port Commission Category:Ostend Ostend Category:Ports and harbours of the North Sea Category:Buildings and structures in West Flanders ","title":"Port of Ostend"},{"id":"6197738","text":"General Francis Richard Dannatt, Baron Dannatt, (born 23 December 1950) is a retired senior British Army officer and member of the House of Lords. He was Chief of the General Staff (head of the Army) from 2006 to 2009. Dannatt was commissioned into the Green Howards in 1971, and his first tour of duty was in Belfast as a platoon commander. During his second tour of duty, also in Northern Ireland, Dannatt was awarded the Military Cross. Following a major stroke in 1977, Dannatt considered leaving the Army, but was encouraged by his commanding officer (CO) to stay. After Staff College, he became a company commander and eventually took command of the Green Howards in 1989. He attended and then commanded the Higher Command and Staff Course, after which he was promoted to brigadier. Dannatt was given command of 4th Armoured Brigade in 1994 and commanded the British component of the Implementation Force (IFOR) the following year. Dannatt took command of 3rd Mechanised Division in 1999 and simultaneously commanded British forces in Kosovo. After a brief tour in Bosnia, he was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff (ACGS). Following the attacks of 11 September 2001, he became involved in planning for subsequent operations in the Middle East. As Commander of the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), a role he assumed in 2003, Dannatt led the ARRC headquarters in planning for deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. The ARRC served in Afghanistan in 2005, but by this time Dannatt was Commander-in- Chief, Land Command—the day-to-day commander of the British Army. He was responsible for implementing a controversial reorganisation of the infantry which eventually resulted in his regiment, the Green Howards, being amalgamated into the Yorkshire Regiment. Dannatt was appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS) in August 2006, succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson. Dannatt faced controversy over his outspokenness, in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers and for a drawdown of operations in Iraq in order to better man those in Afghanistan. He also set about trying to increase his public profile, worried that he was not recognisable enough at a time when he had to defend the Army's reputation against alleged prisoner abuse in Iraq. He later assisted with the formation of Help for Heroes to fund a swimming pool at Headley Court and, later in his tenure, brokered an agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan. He was succeeded as CGS by Sir David Richards and retired in 2009, taking up the largely honorary post of Constable of the Tower of London, which he held until July 2016. Between November 2009 and the British general election in May 2010, Dannatt served as a defence adviser to Conservative Party leader David Cameron. Dannatt resigned when Cameron's party formed a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats after the election produced a hung parliament, arguing that the Prime Minister should rely primarily on the advice of the incumbent service chiefs. Dannatt published an autobiography in 2010 and continues to be involved with a number of charities and organisations related to the armed forces. He is married with four children, one of whom served as an officer in the Grenadier Guards. ==Early life== Dannatt, the son of Anthony and Mary (née Chilvers),Dannatt, Gen. Sir (Francis) Richard, Who's Who 2011, A & C Black, 2011; online edn, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 30 May 2011. was born at home in Broomfield—now a suburb of Chelmsford—in Essex. His father and grandfather were architects, working from a practice in Chelmsford, and his mother was a part-time teacher at the London Bible College. He had an elder sister who died from breast cancer in 1988. Dannatt was heavily influenced by his paternal great-grandfather, a Victorian farmer and devout Christian who devised a drainage system.Dannatt, pp. 11–28. Dannatt and his sister were sent to separate boarding schools. He attended Felsted Junior School, where he gained an ambition to become a professional cricketer. For his secondary education, he was sent to St. Lawrence College in Ramsgate, Kent, where he joined the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) and eventually rose to senior under-officer. While at school, he developed a dislike of his first name, Francis, after it was mistaken for a girl's and he was invited to a birthday party at which he was the only boy. He eventually switched to his middle name, Richard, when he was fifteen. By then aspiring to become a barrister, Dannatt applied to study law at Emmanuel College, Cambridge but was turned down after an interview, at which point his ambition switched towards a military career. ==Early military career== Having initially been interested in a tank regiment, Dannatt was interviewed at the Regular Commissions Board (later renamed the Army Officer Selection Board) by an officer from the Green Howards, who persuaded him to consider the infantry and arranged for a visit to a barracks near Colchester. There he met Peter Inge, then a major, and Dannatt became set on joining the Green Howards.Dannatt, pp. 27–29. He entered the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst in September 1969 and was commissioned into the Green Howards as a second lieutenant on 30 July 1971. After a short period of leave, he was sent to Belfast, Northern Ireland, as a platoon commander.Dannatt, p. 36. Upon completion of the tour, Dannatt returned to the British mainland to take a platoon commanders' course, after which he rejoined the Green Howards at their barracks in West Germany. He and his platoon returned to Belfast in late 1972.Dannatt, p. 51. For gallantry on an operation in which his platoon came under fire in East Belfast on 7 February 1972, he was later awarded the Military Cross. His first promotion was to lieutenant on 30 January 1973. Having completed his tour in Northern Ireland, Dannatt applied to take an \\"in-service\\" degree—a degree at a civilian university sponsored by the Army—at Hatfield College, Durham University. He was accepted, and commenced study of economic history later in 1973. During his first year at university, Dannatt attended a debate at Trinity College, Dublin—a rare opportunity for a serving British officer at the height of The Troubles. In 1974 he was involved in fundraising for a specially adapted Mini car to be provided for a disabled fellow student, Sue Foster, which included charity dinners held at various colleges and a sponsored walk to Scotch Corner and back. As part of the arrangement for the \\"in-service\\" degree, Dannatt was required to return to the Green Howards during the summer holidays.Dannatt, p. 60. For both summers, the regiment was serving in Northern Ireland—in Armagh in 1974 and South Armagh in 1975. It was during the 1975 tour that Dannatt was involved in an operation to destroy an improvised explosive device. The device was booby-trapped, and an attempt to disable it resulted in its detonation. Dannatt was uninjured but four soldiers, including Dannatt's company commander—Major Peter Willis—were killed. Shortly after, Dannatt arrested a man in connection with the incident and later gave evidence against him in court.Dannatt, pp. 67–68. Dannatt graduated in 1976 and, rejoining his regiment, was posted to Berlin.Dannatt, p. 71. He was appointed battalion adjutantDannatt, p. 75. and promoted to captain in July 1977. On 11 November 1977, Dannatt, then just 26, suffered a major stroke and spent most of the next two years recovering, but was allowed to return to duty in 1978. He was posted to Northern Ireland, accompanied by his wife,Dannatt, pp. 79–82. who gave birth to the couple's first son in Craigavon Area Hospital a few weeks into the tour.Dannatt, p. 82. Dannatt left Northern Ireland ahead of the rest of the battalion and was posted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Surrey, then under the command of Major (later General Sir) Rupert Smith, and expected this to be his last posting in the light of his stroke. He applied for a variety of jobs outside the Army but, after Smith's encouragement, sat the entrance exams for Staff College, Camberley, also in Surrey. He passed the entrance exams and turned down two civilian job offers to accept his place. Before Camberley, in late 1980, Dannatt was posted to Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, as a company commander.Dannatt, pp. 83–84. In early 1981, his company took over the running of HM Prison Frankland during a month-long strike by prison officers.Dannatt, p. 86. Shortly after the end of the strike, he was posted to Cyprus with the United Nations peacekeeping force before returning to Surrey for the start of the one-year Command and Staff Course at Camberley.Dannatt, pp. 92–93. After completing the course, he was promoted to major on 30 September 1982, and appointed chief of staff to 20th Armoured Brigade, based in West Germany.Dannatt, p. 98. After two years as chief of staff, Dannatt returned to the Green Howards, then also based in West Germany, to command a company for the second time in his career. He was posted to Northern Ireland for six months in 1985, his fifth tour of the province, though it was significantly quieter than his previous tours. He was appointed Military Assistant to the Minister of State for the Armed Forces in 1986, his first position at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in London.Dannatt, pp. 106–108. Promoted to lieutenant colonel on 30 June 1987, Dannatt spent three years at the MoD, in a role he described as \\"bridging the gap\\" between the military and politicians, most of whom did not have first-hand experience in the armed forces. At the end of his tenure, he was involved with Field Marshal Sir Nigel Bagnall's British Military Doctrine in its final stages as it was submitted for ministerial approval.Dannatt, pp. 108–109. The Green Howards celebrated their 300th anniversary in 1988 and Dannatt took command of the regiment in 1989. He was responsible for overseeing its transition into an airmobile role, forming part of 24th Airmobile Brigade. He served his sixth and final tour in Northern Ireland in 1991 when the Green Howards were deployed to South Armagh for a month.Dannatt, pp. 118–119. Returning to Staff College, Camberley, Dannatt took the Higher Command and Staff Course (HCSC), after which he was promoted to colonel on 31 December 1991, backdated to 30 June 1991, and tasked with the running of the HCSC, as well as updating the British Military Doctrine in the light of the end of the Cold War.Dannatt, pp. 120–122. He also drafted the campaign plan for Lieutenant General (later General Sir) Mike Rose's command of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the Balkans.Dannatt, p. 125. Dannatt was promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1993, backdated to 30 June 1993, and took command of 4th Armoured Brigade, based in Germany.Dannatt, p. 130. He spent 1994 commanding the brigade and overseeing training and, in 1995, was posted to Bosnia along with his headquarters staff, leaving the rest of the brigade in Germany and taking command of separate units already deployed in Bosnia.Dannatt, pp. 132–133. He commanded UNPROFOR's Sector South West, composed of troops from multiple nations, while also serving as Commander of British Forces (COMBRITFOR), responsible for overseeing operations of all British troops in Bosnia.Dannatt, pp. 136–137. After the signing of the Dayton Agreement in November 1995, UNPROFOR became the NATO-led Implementation Force and Dannatt's brigade was incorporated into a multi-national division commanded by Mike Jackson.Dannatt, pp. 148–149. Dannatt was later appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his service in the Balkans. Handing over 4th Armoured Brigade to David Richards, Dannatt was appointed Director, Defence Programme Staff at the MoD in 1996 and was responsible for part of the implementation of the Strategic Defence Review, produced by the Labour government that had come to power in 1997.Dannatt, pp. 175–176. ==High command== After three years at the MoD, Dannatt attained general officer status with promotion to major general, and took command of the 3rd Mechanised Division in January 1999. Later in the year, the prospect of NATO intervention in the Kosovo War became likely, and Dannatt and his staff began planning for a potential ground invasion of the territory. In the event, Slobodan Milošević agreed to withdraw Serbian–Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, the practicalities of which were negotiated by Mike Jackson. It was decided, given the large number of British troops serving as part of the multinational Kosovo Force (KFOR), that the 3rd Division's headquarters would deploy to oversee British operations, with Dannatt as COMBRITFOR.Dannatt, pp. 188–189. Not long after Dannatt's arrival, a Russian armoured column moved into Kosovo and took control of Pristina Airport. Wesley Clark, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, subsequently ordered Jackson, commander of KFOR, to block the runways of the airport and prevent Russia flying in reinforcements. The issue eventually became moot but Dannatt, as COMBRITFOR, had been ordered to veto the use of British troops—known in NATO as a \\"red card\\", afforded to each national contingent commander—for any such operation.Dannatt, pp. 191–193. He was later awarded the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service for his conduct in Kosovo. Dannatt (far right) with James Dugdale, 2nd Baron Crathorne, Lord Lieutenant of North Yorkshire; then-Major General Nick Houghton; and Prince Andrew, Duke of York (left) Returning to the 3rd Division, Dannatt planned two exercises at the British Army Training Unit Suffield in Canada. The first was, at the time, the largest exercise the Army had run since the end of the Cold War; the second only took place after Dannatt's tenure as commander had expired.Dannatt, pp. 194–196. Dannatt gave evidence as an expert witness in the trial of Radislav Krstić in relation to the Srebrenica massacre, shortly after which he was posted to Bosnia, where he served as deputy commander of NATO's Stabilisation Force in 2000.Dannatt, pp. 198–199. His tour, originally scheduled to last a full year was cut short when Sir Michael Willcocks took early retirement from the Army in order to become Black Rod. The resulting personnel changes to fill the vacancy meant that Dannatt was appointed Assistant Chief of the General Staff (ACGS) in April 2001.Dannatt, pp. 204–205. In September 2001, he was on a visit to British troops in Cyprus and watched the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks on television.Dannatt, p. 212. As ACGS, he was peripherally involved in planning for the Army's subsequent involvement in Afghanistan and later Iraq, as well as standing in for the Chief of the General Staff (then Michael Walker) when Walker was unavailable. Dannatt was succeeded as ACGS by David Richards, to whom he had handed over command of 4th Armoured Brigade in 1996 and who later succeeded Dannatt as Chief of the General Staff.Dannatt, p. 217. Dannatt was appointed Commander, Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (COMARRC) on 16 January 2003 and promoted to lieutenant general the same day. During his tenure, he was predominantly concerned with planning for possible deployment of the ARRC in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was eventually deployed to Afghanistan, but not until after Dannatt had handed over its command to David Richards.Dannatt, pp. 223–225. Dannatt was knighted with his investiture as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in June 2004. He succeeded Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman as Commander-in-Chief, Land Command (CINCLAND)—responsible for day-to-day running of the Army—on 7 March 2005, and was promoted to full general the same day. The prevailing issue during his tenure as Commander-in-Chief was the reorganisation of the infantry, an emotive issue as it resulted in the loss of many historic regimental names, including Dannatt's regiment, the Green Howards, which became 2nd Battalion, the Yorkshire Regiment (Green Howards).Dannatt, p. 229. However, his term also coincided with an increase in the intensity of simultaneous operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Dannatt formed the view that government spending priorities did not accurately reflect the commitments of the British Armed Forces at the time.Dannatt, p. 233. ===Chief of the General Staff=== Armed Forces Day parade in Southend, Essex Upon the retirement of Sir Mike Jackson, Dannatt was appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS)—the professional head of the British Army—on 29 August 2006. Concerned that the formation of the British Armed Forces Federation meant that soldiers were losing confidence in generals to lobby on their behalf, his first act as CGS was to write a long letter to the Secretary of State for Defence, Des Browne, which he copied to the MoD's senior civil servant, Bill Jeffrey; Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS); and to the First Sea Lord and Chief of the Air Staff—his opposite numbers in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force respectively. In the letter, he asserted his view that the Army was over-stretched by operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and that essential equipment, such as helicopters, was unavailable or ineffective and outdated, like the Snatch Land Rover. He also raised concerns with the standard of accommodation provided for soldiers at home and with soldiers' wages. The following weekend, he travelled to Afghanistan on his first official visit as CGS.Dannatt, pp. 236–239. He met Des Browne in person for the first time two days after becoming CGS and later acknowledged the difficulties faced by defence secretaries in the little time they have to prepare for the role.Dannatt, p. 247. Later in his tenure as CGS, Dannatt became concerned that his public profile was not high enough that he would be listened to outside of the Army, especially given the ongoing controversy surrounding the courts-martial of soldiers alleged to be involved in the death of Baha Mousa. As such, he accepted an invitation to an informal gathering of officers and journalists at the Cavalry and Guards Club in September 2006. During the gathering, he raised issues with journalists about defence spending in general and soldiers' wages in particular. To his surprise, and as a result of media pressure and internal lobbying, a bonus for soldiers who had served six-month tours in Iraq and Afghanistan was announced a month later.Dannatt, pp. 250–251. Dannatt appeared in newspaper headlines in October 2006 when he gave an interview for Sarah Sands of the Daily Mail in which he opined that a drawdown of troops from Iraq was necessary in order to allow the Army to focus on Afghanistan, and that wounded soldiers should recover in a military environment rather than civilian hospitals. His comments were supported by several journalists and retired officers, though others believed Dannatt had acted improperly and called for his resignation, while Simon Jenkins of The Times called Dannatt's comments \\"either daringly brave or totally naive\\". Dannatt went on to chair a conference of welfare providers to military personnel in order to show that the Army understood the issues affecting its soldiers and to organise a series of smaller conferences, hosted by himself and Sir Freddie Viggers—then Adjutant-General to the Forces—to discuss welfare issues with commanding officers across the UK.Dannatt, pp. 226–227. In 2007, Dannatt and his wife, Pippa, visited Headley Court, an MoD rehabilitation centre for wounded personnel, where the commanding officer informed the Dannatts of his desire for a swimming pool, but accepted that it was unlikely to receive government funding. Some time later, the Dannatts were introduced to Bryn and Emma Parry by Sarah-Jane Shirreff—the wife of Sir Richard Shirreff—and the Dannatts assisted the Parrys with the formation of Help for Heroes, set up with the specific aim of funding the swimming pool at Headley Court. Dannatt initially worried that the charity's ₤2 million goal might be unattainable, but it eventually raised enough money to build both the pool and a gymnasium, which were opened in 2010.Dannatt, pp. 272–273. He and Pippa later assisted both Help For Heroes and SSAFA Forces Help in efforts to build houses to accommodate the families of wounded servicemen at Headley Court and the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in Birmingham, inspired by the difficulties faced by the family of George Cross recipient Peter Norton.Dannatt, pp. 274–277. Another of Dannatt's priorities was tackling the perception of the British operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as he was concerned the news media and the British public were unaware of the purpose or the intensity of the missions. Disgruntled by increasingly negative coverage, he interrupted a family holiday in Cornwall to fly to Afghanistan in an effort to change the coverage through a series of interviews. During the visit, he managed to meet with his son, Bertie, who was serving in the country with the Grenadier Guards.Dannatt, p. 279. Later in 2007, Dannatt raised the same issue in a lecture to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.Dannatt, p. 281. Earlier that year, Dannatt had taken the decision not to allow Prince Harry to serve in Iraq. However, after Dannatt had brokered an understanding with the British press, Harry was able to serve in Afghanistan for three months in late 2007 and early 2008 until the story broke and he was ordered home.Dannatt, pp. 286–287. In 2008, in the first speech of its kind by any CGS, Dannatt addressed the Army-sponsored Fourth Joint Conference on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Matters, stating that homosexuals were welcome to serve in the Army. Dannatt was raised from Knight Commander to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 2008–2009 New Year Honours List. His tenure as CGS expired in August 2008 and he was succeeded for the last time by Sir David Richards. The government took the unusual decision to extend the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup as CDS, rather than promote one of the outgoing service chiefs. Thus all three, including Dannatt, retired, amid claims that Dannatt's potential promotion to CDS had been personally vetoed by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. His last act as CGS was to nominate Nick Houghton to become the next Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff.Dannatt, p. 318. ===Honorary titles=== Dannatt was appointed Colonel, The Green Howards on 1 December 1994, succeeding Field Marshal Sir Peter Inge. He was in turn relieved by Brigadier John Powell in May 2003. Dannatt succeeded Sir Christopher Wallace as Deputy Colonel Commandant of the Adjutant General's Corps on 1 April 1999, holding the title until 17 June 2005, when he was relieved by Major General Bill Rollo. He was appointed Colonel Commandant of the King's Division, in succession to Sir Scott Grant, on 1 July 2001. He relinquished the title on 10 December 2005 to fellow Green Howard, Lieutenant General (later General Sir) Nick Houghton. Between appointments in 2002, Dannatt spent six weeks at the School of Army Aviation at Army Air Corps Middle Wallop, where he was trained as a helicopter pilot in order to fulfil his duties as Colonel Commandant of the Army Air Corps (AAC), to which he was appointed on 1 April 2004, succeeding Michael Walker.Dannatt, p. 220. Also in succession to Walker, he was appointed Aide de Camp General (ADC Gen) to Queen Elizabeth II on 5 June 2006. He was succeeded in his position with the AAC by Major General Adrian Bradshaw on 1 July 2009, and relinquished the appointment of ADC Gen on 1 September 2009. ==Retirement== Dannatt in the full ceremonial uniform of the Constable of the Tower in 2010 It was announced in February 2009 that, after his retirement, Dannatt would be installed as the 159th Constable of the Tower of London. The tenure of the previous incumbent, General Sir Roger Wheeler, also a former CGS, expired on 31 July and Dannatt became constable on 1 August 2009. The Constable has been the most senior official at the Tower of London since the eleventh century. Today, the role is largely ceremonial, and conferred on field marshals or retired generals who usually serve a five-year term. After his retirement, Dannatt was appointed to be a Deputy Lieutenant of Greater London on 30 June 2010 and of Norfolk on 19 March 2012. After leaving office as CGS, Dannatt effectively retired from the Army, but technically remained a serving officer until November 2009. Shortly after leaving office, Dannatt was approached by David Cameron, then leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition. Cameron invited Dannatt to become a defence adviser for the Shadow Cabinet once he was officially retired from the Army and no longer bound by Queen's Regulations, which mandate political neutrality in the armed forces. Although uncommon for a former service chief to align himself with one political party, Dannatt accepted the role on an informal basis.Dannatt, pp. 384–385. The timing of the decision, which became public in October 2009—within two months of Dannatt's effective retirement—attracted some controversy, with some former ministers and civil servants suggesting it potentially compromised the neutrality of the armed forces. He advised Cameron and his shadow cabinet until he resigned, shortly after the 2010 general election, stating that Cameron, by then prime minister, should turn to the incumbent chiefs of staff for defence advice and citing no desire to become a special adviser. The Council of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), a politically independent think tank dedicated to defence and security issues, elected Dannatt as the Institute's Chairman in June 2009. He took up the appointment on 1 September 2009, but resigned in October the same year after the announcement that he was to become an adviser to David Cameron, believing that his resignation was necessary for RUSI to maintain its political neutrality. He was eventually succeeded by former Defence Secretary John Hutton, Baron Hutton of Furness. Dannatt has written an autobiography, titled Leading from the Front, published by Bantam Press in 2010. In the book, he was critical of the Labour government that led the UK from 1997 to 2010 and of Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer and later prime minister, in particular, accusing him of \\"malign intervention\\" and, while chancellor, of refusing to fund Tony Blair's defence policy. He also criticised Tony Blair for allowing himself to be effectively overruled by Brown and said of Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, then CDS, that \\"although brilliant at what he did, [he] could not have been expected to understand the sights, sounds and smells of the battlefield\\". The Daily Telegraph called the book \\"a searing indictment of how New Labour, and to some extent the military's high command, failed to properly lead, fund and equip the armed forces for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan\\". In July 2010, Dannatt gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry, focusing predominantly on his role as ACGS in 2002. He described an initial reluctance to commit the Army and stated that planning had been for a minimal land commitment and the provision of naval and air support to the United States. He also repeated his previous assertions that the army had been over-stretched by simultaneous operation in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2006 and re-stated his view that Afghanistan was the more important for British interests. Dannatt's evidence was followed by that of his predecessor as CGS, General Sir Mike Jackson. US Embassy, London in October 2018 Dannatt was nominated for a life peerage by David Cameron while Cameron was Leader of the Opposition. Although nominated for a political peerage on the Conservative Party benches, he opted to sit as a crossbencher and was ennobled as Baron Dannatt in November 2010. In October 2012, The Times conducted an undercover investigation into Dannat's lobbying activities. According to the Guardian, Dannatt offered to lobby Bernard Gray, who was then Chief of Defence Materiel. Dannatt was quoted as saying he had engineered a seat at a formal dinner with the Ministry of Defence's new permanent secretary, Jon Thompson, to help another company, Capita Symonds, which was bidding for a contract to manage MoD estates. According to The Independent, Dannatt acknowledged that he had offered to assist in facilitating conversations, but stated that he had rejected an offer of an £8,000 per month fee to lobby on behalf of the organisation and that he had \\"no inclination\\" to contravene the rules on lobbying, and would regard any such claim as \\"seriously defamatory\\". In July 2016, he formally handed over his Tower of London role to the Deputy Governor and was succeeded by Sir Nick Houghton in October 2016. Also in 2016, his book Boots on the Ground: Britain and her Army since 1945, was published. In the book, he opined that \\"going to Iraq was a strategic error of near biblical proportions\\" and that the defence budget of 2% of GDP is \\"too meagre in the current security climate\\". Commenting on the Victims Rights Campaign in September 2018, he told the news media that retiring soldiers, airmen and sailors should receive a psychological assessment as part of the resettlement package before leaving duty to help them avoid future prison and homelessness. ==Personal life== Dannatt met his wife, Philippa (\\"Pippa\\"; née Gurney) during his first year at Durham University in 1973. The couple became engaged, and married in March 1977, after which Pippa accompanied Dannatt on his return to Berlin.Dannatt, p. 73. They had four children—three boys and one girl. Bertie, their second son, served with the Grenadier Guards—Pippa's father's regiment—in Iraq and Afghanistan, earning a mention in despatches and reaching the rank of captain before leaving the Army in 2008.Dannatt, p. 394. In 1977, then just 26, Dannatt suffered a major stroke, rendering him unable to speak and leaving the right-hand side of his body paralysed. He spent much of the subsequent two years recovering and was eventually allowed to return to duty, though he still tires more quickly on his right-hand side than on his left and has other minor residual effects. During his recovery, Dannatt, a devout Christian, was pointed to two Bible verses, which prompted him to believe that his commitment to his faith had thus far been \\"half-hearted\\" and inspired him to make a greater commitment which, according to his autobiography, \\"helped define who I then became, both as a person and as a soldier\\". Dannatt later attributed surviving his stroke and several other near-death experiences—including the incident for which he was awarded the Military Cross—to a challenge from God to \\"devote his life to Christ\\". Dannatt has been Vice President of the Armed Forces Christian Union since 1998 and President Emeritus of the Soldiers' and Airmen's Scripture Readers Association since 2020 (he was President from 1999 to 2019). He was President of the Army Rifle Association from 2000 to 2008 and of the Royal Norfolk Agricultural Association in 2008, presiding over that year's Royal Norfolk Show, attended by Prince Harry at Dannatt's invitation.Dannatt, p. 289. He has served as a trustee of the Windsor Leadership Trust since 2005 and as patron of Hope and Homes for Children since 2006, and continues his patronage of Help for Heroes, which he assisted in founding while CGS. He lists his leisure interests as cricket, tennis, fishing and shooting. He was appointed president of the Norfolk Churches Trust in November 2011, and Vice President of The Western Front Association in 2013. He is also the President of YMCA Norfolk. He and his wife live on the banks of the River Yare in Keswick just south of Norwich.Hearts and minds – People – EDP Norfolk Magazine Retrieved 2016-11-05. ==References== Bibliography * * Citations ==External links== * - - - - - - - - Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:British Army generals Category:Chiefs of the General Staff (United Kingdom) Category:Green Howards officers Category:British military personnel of the Troubles Category:Crossbench life peers Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath Category:Recipients of the Commendation for Valuable Service Category:Recipients of the Military Cross Category:Constables of the Tower of London Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Greater London Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Norfolk Category:Graduates of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Category:People educated at Felsted School Category:People educated at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate Category:English Anglicans Category:Evangelical Anglicans Category:Alumni of Hatfield College, Durham Category:People from Chelmsford Category:People from South Norfolk (district) Category:Graduates of the Staff College, Camberley Category:Presidents of the Durham Union ","title":"Richard Dannatt"},{"id":"6197790","text":"is a JR Shikoku railway station on the Yosan Line located in Matsuyama, Ehime, Shikoku, Japan.

For example, after thinking about being violent with someone, one would then be overly nice or accommodating to them. It is one of several defense mechanisms proposed by the founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud during his career, many of which were later developed further by his daughter Anna Freud. The German term \\"Ungeschehenmachen\\" was first used to describe this defense mechanism. Transliterated, it means \\"making un-happen\\", which is essentially the core of \\"undoing\\". Undoing refers to the phenomenon whereby a person tries to alter the past in some way to avoid or feign disappearance of an adversity or mishap.Laplanche, J. and Pontalis, J-B. (1973), The language of psycho-analysis (D. Nicholson-Smith, Trans). New York: Norton. ==Freud's development of the concept== Freud first described the practice of undoing in his 1909 \\"Notes upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis\\". Here he recounted how his patient (the \\"Rat Man\\") first removed a stone from the road in case his lady's carriage should overturn upon it, and thereafter 'felt obliged to go back and replace the stone in its original position in the middle of the road'.Sigmund Freud, Case Studies II (London 1991) p. 70 Freud argued that his 'undoing this deed of love by replacing the stone where...her carriage might come to grief against it...was determined by a motive contrary to that which produced the first part'Freud, Studies p. 72 by hate, not love. It was two decades later in 1926 that he formalised the ego defense as' undoing what has been done....it is, as it were, negative magic, and endeavours, by means of motor symbolism, to blow away not merely the consequences of some event (or experience or impression) but the event itself'.Sigmund Freud, On Psychopathology (Middlesex 1987) p. 275 Freud then went on to use '\\"undoing\\" what has been done...[as] good enough grounds for re-introducing the old concept of defence, which can cover all these processes that have the same purpose—namely the protection of the ego against instinctual demands'Freud, Psychopathology p. 324—one of the major technical advances of his later years. ==In psychoanalysis after Freud== The first psychoanalytic half-century saw several writers exploring the concept of undoing in Freud's wake. Anna Freud listed it among the ego mechanisms; Ernest Jones and Ella Freeman Sharpe both wrote articles linking it with 'actions and attitudes aimed at the undoing of imaginative destructions. Strivings for reparation may...be the main motive'.Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 155 Otto Fenichel devoted a substantial section of his \\"mechanism of defense\\" to summarizing past work in his encyclopedic Theory of Neurosis: he was especially interested in how 'the undoing sometimes does not consist in a compulsion to do the opposite of what has been done previously but in a compulsion to repeat the very same act...with the opposite unconscious meaning'.Fenichel, Theory pp. 153–4 The second half of the twentieth century saw little new theoretical or creative work around the concept. Jean Laplanche and J. B. Pontalis laid stress on how 'Undoing in the pathological sense is directed at the act's very reality, and the aim is to suppress it absolutely, as though time were reversed'.Jean Laplanche and J. B. Pontalis, The Language of Psychoanalysis (London 1988) p. 478 The Freud encyclopedia highlighted how 'Acts of expiation can be seen as forms of undoing;Edward Erwin, The Freud encyclopedia (2002) p. 140 George Eman Vaillant placed undoing among the neurotic defenses in his hierarchy of defense mechanisms. Melanie Klein in her early work had written of undoing in terms of a kind of magical reparation: 'a tendency to undo harm and put objects to right magically'.Melanie Klein, Developments in Psycho-Analysis (London 1989) p. 61 Later, however, she would use it in terms of a kind of ego disintegration—'a process of undoing, or what she called \\"a falling into bits\\"'Meira Likierman, Melanie Klein: Her Work in Context (2002) p. 167—and it was in this latter, rather different sense of the term that later Kleinians would tend to use it: 'an invitation to dissolution and undoing...leaving the mental field open for enactment and horror'.Leslie Sohn, in H. S. Klein/J. Symington eds., Imprisoned Pain and its transformation (London 2000) p. 202 ==Automaticity== There is a proposal that speaks specifically about the automaticity of this counter factual thinking. This theory, as stipulated by Medvec, Madey and Gilovich (1995) states that Undoing can occur as an automatic response to a situation. Their findings involved Olympic Silver Medalists who were less happy about their achievement than the bronze medalists, even though it is known that Silver medalists have a higher honor. To the individuals, the Silver Medal represented how close they were to winning which is worse than being awarded bronze, which signified how close they were to not having a placement at all. This suggests that the counterfactual thinking was a sort of implicit way of control and was not actually deliberately employed as a mechanism.Medvec, V.H., Madey, S. F. and Gilouich, T. (1995). When less is more: Counterfactual thinking and satisfaction among Olympic Medalists, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 69, 603–610 ==Further uses== Undoing can be used to 'explain away' habits or behaviors that are not in line with an individual's personality. For example, in the case of a person who is well organised in the workplace, yet always forgets to pay bills on time at home, Freudian psychologists could argue that his tardiness with bills is an undoing of his desire to be orderly, or vice versa. Freud has been criticized regarding examples such as this because his theory is so complicated that most problems can be explained by another part of the theory. For some people undoing can be used to reduce cognitive dissonance, the uncomfortable feeling created when an attitude and an action, or two attitudes are in conflict with one another. In criminal profiling the term refers to a pattern of behavior by which an offender tries to undo their crime symbolically, e.g. by painting the face of a person killed by the perpetrator, covering up and decorating the corpse with flowers, personal belongings and jewelry, or folding the hands, imitating a laying-out. ==Effects of positive emotions== Happiness, joy, love, excitement are all positive emotions and there is no arguing that these emotions contribute in large to how we act, how we think, and what we do. In contrast there are also negative feelings such as sadness that can lead us to act in certain ways that may not necessarily be good. Studies have been performed that have shown that positive emotions can be used to \\"correct\\" or \\"undo\\" the effects of negative emotions. Barbara Fredrickson and Robert Levenson have come up with the undoing hypothesis. In essence what the hypothesis states is that people might hold in the effects of their positive emotions to counterbalance the effects of their negative emotions.Fredrickson, B. L., Mancuso, R. A., Branigan, C. and Tugade, M. M. (2000). The undoing effect of positive emotions. Motivation and Emotion 24, 237–258. Overall positive emotions help lower the potentially health-damaging cardiovascular reactivity that lingers following negative emotions. This effect may be especially important for those most at risk for developing coronary heart disease. ==Effects of negative emotions== Negative emotions, including anger and fear, can be seen as the evolution of human adaptation to survival in life-threatening situations. For example, anger shows the sign of attack, fear shows the sign of escape. These emotional reactions interconnect with our mind and body. These negative emotions are influenced by the physiological support mechanisms, such as the physical energy, that relies on the body to mobilize at an optimal level for individual action to react. In the attack or flee situation, it produces heightened cardiovascular re-activity that redistributes blood flow to relevant skeletal muscles. However, in extreme cases, negative emotions will cause damage to people's health in their cardiovascular re-activity. == Classification == Undoing is tentatively classified at the \\"Mental inhibitions (compromise formation) level\\" in DSM-IV-TR's proposed Defensive Functioning Scale (under Appendix B, \\"Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study.\\") ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Kosslyn, S. and Rosenberg, R.

It is set in the Avondale Forest Park in over 2 km² (500 acres) of land, approximately 1.5 km from the nearby town of Rathdrum. The river Avonmore flows through the park on its way towards the Irish Sea. The House is now a museum. The house is open to visitors, who are introduced to the house by an audio visual presentation. Other facilities include a restaurant, book shop, picnic areas, children's play area, two orienteering courses and large car/coach park. In the surrounding parkland are tree trails and walks ranging in duration from one to five hours. ==History== Avondale House was built in 1777 for Samuel Hayes, a barrister who wrote a book on Irish Forestry and was a pioneer of the re-afforestation of Ireland, planting many thousands of trees on the estate. He bequeathed it to his friend and fellow MP Sir John Parnell in 1795 and the latter's great-grandson Charles Stewart Parnell was born there in 1846.\\"Avondale Forest Park\\", Coillte Outdoors, the Irish Forestry Board After Parnell's death in 1891 the estate was sold to a Dublin butcher who felled most of the trees to recoup his investment. The house is Georgian, probably designed by James Wyatt and built in 1777. It is notable for its fine plasterwork and still contains many original pieces of furniture.\\"Avondale House & Park\\", Wicklow Gardens, January 24, 2014 The American Room is dedicated to Admiral Charles Stewart (1778-1869), Parnell's American grandfather who commanded the USS Constitution (now moored in Boston Harbor) during the War of 1812. The woodlands were renewed in 1904 when the estate was sold to the government. The house was used as a forestry school and the grounds planted with a great variety of trees, the most successful being conifers from the Pacific coast of North America. The grounds now boast specimens of giant redwoods from California and Sitka spruce from British Columbia. The ruins of Parnell's old sawmill and Parnell's well are located on the site. One of the site's attractions is a trackless Forest Train that runs through the park. The outside of the house is featured in a painting in the R. Barry O'Brien 1898 biography of Parnell.O'Brien, R.

He began playing colts football for South Fremantle in the WAFL. He is the cousin of former Gold Coast and Port Adelaide player Nathan Krakouer. ==AFL careerRichmond=== He was drafted with the 41st selection in the 2000 AFL draft by Richmond, who had received the draft pick by trading Ben Harrison to the Western Bulldogs. Before making his AFL debut, Krakouer played for Richmond's affiliate team the Coburg Tigers in the VFL. He made his debut against Essendon at the MCG in round 7, 2001 and kicked two goals and was Richmond's only multiple goal scorer in the 46-point loss to the Bombers. A small crumbing forward with excellent evasive skills, Krakouer finished 2nd in Richmond's goal kicking in 2003, 3rd in 2004 and 4th in 2005 and 2006. Krakouer was also a good tackler and in 2004 he laid 95 tackles which was the highest at Richmond and 9th overall in the AFL for that season. He, along with his brother Tyrone, was charged with assault causing grievous bodily harm on 24 December 2006 after an incident in Fremantle, Western Australia on 22 December 2006. Krakouer was delisted by the Tigers on 22 October 2007. ===Prison and WAFL football=== He returned to Western Australia and played in the WAFL for Swan Districts. He was found guilty in June 2008 of assault with intent to cause bodily harm, an offence that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years' jail. He was sentenced to four years' jail with a minimum non-parole period of 16 months. The sentence was later reduced from 48 to 32 months' jail time. Krakouer played for the Wooroloo Prison team, which participated in the Mercantile Football Association. Krakouer was released from prison on parole in August 2009, and signed on to play the 2010 football season for Swan Districts in the WAFL. He performed very well for the Swans, winning the Swan Medal as the fairest and best player at the club and the 2010 Sandover Medal as the fairest and best player in the WAFL. He won the Simpson Medal as the best on ground in the Swans' one-point win against Claremont in the WAFL Grand Final, after amassing 42 disposals and kicking four goals, including the game-winning goal in the 33rd minute of the final quarter. A special analysis of the game showed that Krakouer would have polled 290 Champion Data ranking points (Supercoach points) in the game, more than any player has polled in an AFL game since the statistical technique was implemented in 2004. ===AFL return=== On 7 October 2010, Collingwood signed Krakouer. The newly established Gold Coast Suns agreed to pre-list him as one of its ten uncontracted players, and then immediately trade him (along with John Ceglar, and a draft pick from each of the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds) to Collingwood in exchange for its first round selection in the 2010 AFL Draft (pick number 25 overall). Krakouer was unable to join his new teammates on the club's pre-season training camp in Arizona, as his prior conviction meant he was denied entry to the United States. Krakouer kicked 35 goals in 23 games in his first season with Collingwood and finished 2nd in the Collingwood goal kicking (behind Travis Cloke), including three goals in the 2011 Grand Final loss to Geelong. He won the 2011 AFL Mark of the Year, receiving the Alex Jesaulenko Medal and a $10,000 cash prize from Hungry Jack's, for his mark in Round 9 against the Adelaide Crows at Etihad Stadium. Krakouer ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in a pre-season practice match in February 2012, however he returned to AFL later in the 2012 season for the final home and away match against Essendon (kicking 1 goal) and the following week he kicked 4 goals in Collingwood's 38-point loss to the Hawthorn Football Club in the Qualifying Final at the MCG. In early 2012, Krakouer changed his guernsey number to the number three after John McCarthy was delisted. His father, Jim wore this number for most of his career. However, during his rehabilitation from his knee injury he decided to revert to the number 7 he wore successfully in 2011. Krakouer was delisted at the end of the 2013 season. In November 2013, Krakouer signed on to play for West Perth for the next 2 years. However, before the beginning of the 2014 season, Krakouer walked away from the contract with West Perth in favour of an employment opportunity in the mining industry, however the job opportunity didn't eventuate and so Krakouer finished his career off at West Perth playing 4 games. Krakouer's final League career game and goal tally was 227 games and 271 goals which included: ===AFL=== * Richmond: 102 games / 102 goals * Collingwood: 35 games / 50 goals ===VFL=== * Coburg Tigers: 39 games / 57 goals * Collingwood: 14 games / 5 goals ===WAFL=== * Swan Districts: 32 games / 48 goals * West Perth: 4 games / 8 goals Krakouer also played in five League Grand Finals in his career and averaged 2.40 goals per game which was an excellent return for a small crumbing forward: * 2002 AFL Preseason Grand Final for Richmond vs Port Adelaide Football Club (1 goal) at Etihad Stadium. * 2007 VFL Grand Final for Coburg Tigers vs Geelong (1 goal) at MC Labour Park * 2010 WAFL Grand Final for Swan Districts vs Claremont Football Club (4 goals) at Subiaco Oval * 2011 AFL Preseason Grand Final for Collingwood vs Essendon (3 goals) at Etihad Stadium. * 2011 AFL Grand Final for Collingwood vs Geelong (3 goals) at the MCG. == References Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Australian criminals Category:Sandover Medal winners Category:Richmond Football Club players Category:Collingwood Football Club players Category:South Fremantle Football Club players Category:Swan Districts Football Club players Category:Indigenous Australian players of Australian rules football Category:Australian rules footballers from Western Australia Category:Coburg Football Club players ","title":"Andrew Krakouer"},{"id":"6197819","text":"My Riot is the third album by Roger Miret and the Disasters.

It is the second installment of The Toxic Avenger franchise. It was directed by Lloyd Kaufman and features The Toxic Avenger in an adventure to Japan to meet his father. The film has received cult status among a new audience almost a generation after it was first released. Devilman and Cutie Honey creator, Go Nagai makes a cameo appearance and the film is also the debut of actor/martial artist Michael Jai White and musician/composer/performance artist Phoebe Legere. ==Plot== Melvin Junko (originally Ferd) has been transformed into the superhero known as the Toxic Avenger. He has made Tromaville a safe place again. However, with no more evil to destroy, Melvin has suffered depression until his blind girlfriend Claire (originally Sara) has gotten him a job at the Tromaville Center for the Blind. When the lunch bell rings, all of the residents enter the building when a mysterious limo pulls up. Inside the limo are the Chairman of Apocalypse Inc. and his number one, Malfaire. Apocalypse Inc. is a New York-based chemical company that finds Tromaville to be the perfect home for its new takeover site. However, they know all about The Toxic Avenger. The Chairman hires a member of his team disguised as a PUS deliveryman to deliver a bomb into the center. Claire escapes in time upon learning of the bomb, but everyone else is killed. However, when the deliveryman and an Apocalypse construction worker arrive to begin their takeover, the Toxic Avenger emerges from the rubble and kills the duo. This leads to an all-out assault by various members of Apocalypse Inc. with the Chairman and Malfaire watching. Toxie easily defeats the group of thugs, either killing them or in the case of one, making him run away. The only survivors of the explosion are Toxie, Claire, and a blind mom and her infant daughter. Apocalypse Inc., reeling from their defeat at the hands of Toxie, hatch a plan to lure him out of Tromaville. They discover Toxie's father had left him and his mother when he was just a baby. Using one of their \\"bad girls\\" as Toxie's psychologist, the plan will involve sending Toxie to Japan to look for his father. The psychiatrist, using her Freudian psychology, convinces him to go to Japan, even though he has reservations about leaving Claire. Claire tells Toxie to go find his father and that she loves him. The next day, Toxie leaves for Japan but since he cannot exactly go on a plane, he heads to Japan using a windsurfboard and a paper asking for his father from the worker at a local Japanese restaurant. However, forgetting his passport, he enters Tokyo Godzilla-style, shocking a group of beachgoers. His appearance shocks everyone he comes across, including a news reporter who occasionally shows up throughout the film. While on his quest, he runs into Masami, who is at first shocked, but smiles at him. As Toxie tries the Japanese snack taiyaki, a local gang begin to assault Masami, causing Toxie's \\"Tromatons\\" to go berserk. He goes after the gang and uses the taiyaki fish- shaper to meld one thug's nose into the shape of a fish. He goes after the ring leader of the group and follows him to a public bath house, where he uses his hot breath power to make the water hot for the gang leader while putting in vegetables and noodles. Finally, he goes after the female member of the trio and follows her inside a local radio station where he ties her up and turns her into a \\"human transmitter\\". Thanking him for saving her, Masami befriends Melvin and offers to help him find his father. Meanwhile, as Melvin is in Japan, Apocalypse Inc. takes full advantage and begin a hostile takeover of Tromaville. This causes people who stand up against them to get beaten up, or in the case of a couple of protestors, get run down and killed. Back in Tokyo, Masami and Melvin finally find Big Mac Junko, a Japanese man decked out in a suit. Melvin is elated and run towards his father until his Tromatons go berserk again. Masami sees a shipment of fish dropped on the floor and discovers cocaine in the fish. Big Mac is a Yakuza leader who delves in drug dealing and when Melvin is forced to confront his father, he goes through a series of battles against Yakuza enforcers, a sickle-chain wielding female member, and Kabuki warriors. Using the environment to his advantage, Melvin is able to defeat the entire gang, only leaving him and his father, who becomes a sumo wrestler. Big Mac reveals to Melvin a bottle of \\"anti-Tromatons\\", the one weakness that can kill Melvin. However, Melvin is able to kick the bottle out of his father's hand and push him to a fish butcher, who, excited by the action, kills Melvin's dad by chopping him up. The bottle breaks and Melvin begins to weaken. However, Masami takes Melvin to a sumo gym, where he is healed and begins training in the art of sumo before saying goodbye to Masami and head back to Tromaville. Upon his return to Tromaville, he learns that Malfaire and the \\"bad girls\\", including his now former psychiatrist, are assaulting Claire. He takes on the bad girls while Claire finally gets the upper hand on Malfaire, incapacitating her. With Melvin back, the people of Tromaville are safe again. That is, until the Chairman hires the Dark Rider to destroy Tromaville. A motorcycle rider with nitroglycerin strapped to his back, the plan is for the Dark Rider to burst into City Hall. Melvin hijacks a taxi with a bickering elderly couple celebrating their anniversary and after a series of turns and misses, ends up crashing the taxi, forcing everyone to get out after an explosion. Then, Melvin hijacks a hovercraft and drives it after the Dark Rider, finally forcing him to bust into a home, causing the Dark Rider's demise. Once again safe from the hands of Apocalypse Inc., the people of Tromaville are elated. A man arrives in Tromaville and is revealed to be Melvin's real father. Melvin learns the Yakuza leader he defeated in Japan was \\"Bic Mac Bunko\\", who is glad to be reunited with both Melvin and his mom and is happy that Bunko, who had used identity theft against him, is no more. Meanwhile, the Chairman and Malfaire attempt to hitch a ride back to New York and fail at doing that. ==Cast== * Ron Fazio as The Toxic Avenger / Apocalypse Inc.

However, according to a 2001 interview with Fazio, Altamura abused his authority by complaining about the make-up and had threatened some staff members, pushing Kaufman to fire Altamura.\\"Toxie Tours Troma: Ron Fazio returns to the Troma building in 12 years.\\" Kaufman then hired Fazio to play the Toxic Avenger when production moved to Tokyo, Japan. However, Kaufman kept the scenes with Altamura in the film, hence in the film's opening fight sequence, it is seen that both Fazio and Altamura face against each other with Fazio playing the tiger-striped member of Apocalypse Inc who gets punched Exorcist-style by Altamura's Toxic Avenger. Fazio's voice would be used as the Toxic Avenger. Michael Jai White made his film debut in the film and not only acted as a member of Apocalypse Inc., but assisted with the film's fight sequences in New York while Hitoshi Genma coordinated the film's action scenes in Japan. Lloyd Kaufman was told that the main Japanese actors, Rikiya Yasuoka and Mayako Katsuragi, spoke English. However, upon his shooting the scenes, he was surprised to learn that Yasuoka and Katsuragi's English was not good enough. During post-production, Lloyd hired his wife Patricia, who also appears in the film as the \\"blind mother\\" and at the time, was the New York City Film Commissioner, to re-dub Katsuragi's voice and co-creator/producer Michael Herz re-dubbed Yasuoka's voice. ==Versions== The 'Unrated Director's cut' version released on DVD by Troma Entertainment is actually missing almost all scenes of gore.

His real interest, however, was in journalism and public life and he came early under the influence of the nationalist upsurge, which was taking place in the country. He became an agent of the well-known revolutionary Hindi and Urdu journals – Karamyogi and Swarajya and also began to contribute to them. He adopted the pen-name 'Vidyarthi' – the seeker of knowledge. He attracted the notice of Pt. Mahabir Prasad Dwiwedi, the doyen of Hindi journalism who offered him the job of a sub-editor in his famous literary monthly, \\"The Saraswati\\", in 1911. Ganesh Shankar, however, was more interested in current affairs and politics and therefore joined the Hindi weekly \\"Abhyudaya\\" a political journal of the time. He thus served his apprenticeship under two of the greatest figures in Hindi literature and journalism of the time. In 1913 Ganesh Shankar came back to Kanpur and launched his career as a crusading journalist and freedom fighter, which was only to end with his death 18 years later. He founded 'Pratap', his famous revolutionary weekly, which identified itself with the cause of the oppressed wherever they might be and Pratap would prove to be widespread as its circulation jumped from five hundred in 1913 to six hundred in 1916. It was through this paper that he waged his famous fights for the oppressed peasants of Rae Bareli, the workers of the Kanpur mills and the downtrodden people of Indian states. During the course of these fights, he had to face numerous prosecutions, pay heavy fines and suffer five prison sentences. On 11 January 1915, he said the following quote: Later on 31 May, he also said: He first met Gandhiji in 1916 in Lucknow and threw himself whole-heartedly in the national movement. He took a leading part in the Home Rule Movement of 1917–18 and led the first strike of textile workers in Kanpur. In 1920 he launched the daily edition of Pratap and it was in this year that he was sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment for championing the cause of peasants of Rae Bareli. He was released in 1922 and almost immediately sent to jail again, for delivering a \\"seditious\\" speech as the President of the Provincial Political Conference at Fatehgarh. In 1924, he met and protested along with Bhagat Singh, who became a close colleague and friend. He would also later associate himself with Chandra Shekhar Azad. Singh was released in 1924, greatly shattered in health, but he knew no respite and founded a short-lived union and also launched himself in the preparation for the Congress Session at Kanpur in 1925. In 1925, when the Congress decided to contest elections of Provincial Legislative Councils and organized the Swaraj Party, Ganesh Shankar won a resounding victory on its behalf, from Kanpur and served as a Member of the U.P. Legislative Council until 1929 when he resigned at the behest of the Congress. In 1925, after Gandhi founded the Beech Wala Chowk temple in Kanpur, Vidyarthi frequently used it to host meetings. In 1926, Vidyarthi, who was considered an important member of Congress, encouraged Shiv Narayan Tandon to also join Congress. In 1928, he also founded the Mazdur Sabha and led it until his death in 1931. In 1929 he was elected the President of the U.P. Congress Committee and was appointed the first 'dictator' to lead the Satyagrah movement in U.P. He was a supporter of the Hindi language and attended the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan conference in 1930 in Gorakhpur and in March 1930 at Shraddhanand Park in New Delhi. That same year, he was arrested and sent to jail again. He was released on 9 March 1931 under the Gandhi-Irwin Pact. While he was about to proceed to Karachi to attend the Congress Session, Kanpur fell into an orgy of communal rioting. Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi threw himself in the midst of furious mobs and saved the lives of thousands of innocent persons belonging to both the Hindu and Muslim communities and it was on this mission of mercy that he was butchered to by a rioting mob of Muslims only to be found a few days later near litter where it took some time to identify him due to multiple wounds by a knife. Mahatma Gandhi paid him the following tribute in the pages of 'Young India'. \\"The death of Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi was one to be envied by us all. His blood is the cement that will ultimately bind the two communities. No pact will bind our hearts. But heroism such as Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi showed is bound in the end to melt the stoniest hearts, melt them into one. The poison has however gone so deep that the blood even of a man so great, so self- sacrificing and so utterly brave as Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi may today not be enough to wash us of it. Let this noble example stimulate us all to a similar effort should the occasion arise again\\". Author Siyaramsharan Gupta also made Vidyarthi the subject of the works Atmotsarg Patheya and Mrinmoyee Atmotsarg. In 2006, there was a controversy involving an unauthorized unveiling of a statue in Mungawali, Madhya Pradesh honoring Vidyarthi by Member of Parliament of INC, Jyotiraditya Madhavrao Scindia. The police and state government claimed it was unauthorized and seized the statue despite local congressman and journalists insisting it be restored. In 2007, journalist Alok Mehta was awarded the Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Award by the Makhanlal Chaturvedi National University of Journalism and Communication. ==Honors== Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi on a 1962 stamp of India *Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Puraskar is given to renowned journalists by honourable President of India every year from 1989. *The Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial (GSVM) Medical College Kanpur is named in his remembrance. *Ganesh Chowk, a square is named after him in the heart of the city of Gorakhpur. *Phool Bagh, earlier Queen's Park in Kanpur is also called as Ganesh Vidyarthi Udyan. *The Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Inter College (GSVIC) GSV Inter College Kanpur is named in his remembrance. * The Ganesh Shanker Vidyarthi Inter College (GSV Inter College Hathgaon-Fatehpur) is named in his remembrance. * Ganesh Shanker Vidyarthi Smarak Inter College (GSVS Inter College Maharajganj, UP) is named after his remembrance. * On 18 July 2017, the Uttar Pradesh government has renamed Kanpur Airport as Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Airport to pay respect to his contribution for the independence of India. ==References== Category:1890 births Category:1931 deaths Category:20th-century Indian journalists Category:Indian independence activists from Uttar Pradesh Category:People from Kanpur Category:Indian Hindus Category:Journalists from Uttar Pradesh Category:Indian National Congress politicians from Uttar Pradesh Category:20th-century Indian politicians ","title":"Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi"},{"id":"6197915","text":"Meesaq is an Urdu monthly magazine which is the organ of Tanzeem-e-Islami.

His father was Daniel Thomas, owner of the lime kilns at Llandough and a contractor (offices in Grangetown, Cardiff)., He was educated at Weston School, near Bath, but he decided not to pursue a university career in order to join his father's business. Early in his business career, Thomas was involved with the construction of the Rhondda Face branch of the Taff Vale Railway. As a result, he became acquainted with the areas which he later represented in Parliament. Thomas had also studied for a short time as a lay student at Regent's Park College under Joseph Angus. His father was a prominent Baptist, and Thomas joined the congregation at Tabernacle Church, Cardiff, where he later became a deacon. ==Early political career== Thomas became member of Cardiff Borough Council for Roath in 1875 and served on the council until 1886, being mayor in 1881–2. During the 1880s, Thomas was instrumental in a number of measures to address the inadequate water supply for Cardiff. In 1884 a committee under his chairmanship secures the Cardiff Corporation Act which provided for the Taff Fawr reservoir. He was also involved with the construction of the Llnanishen reservoir and the later construction of waterworks at Llanishen which Thomas opened on 28 October 1886. As mayor he was central to the decision to locate the University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire in Cardiff, rather than Swansea. He gave £1,000 towards the building fund and the decision to locate the university at Cardiff was announced before the end of his term as Mayor. In later years he was a generous benefactor of the University. Another landmark during his mayoral year was the opening of the Cardiff Free Library and Museum. Following his election to Parliament, Thomas stood down as a member of the council in 1886, but on 13 August 1888 he was created a Freeman of the borough. ==Parliamentary career== As a prominent public figure and through his nonconformist connections, Thomas began to be considered as a possible parliamentary candidate. In 1882 he was mentioned as a possible candidate for Cardiganshire should David Davies choose to retire. More realistic prospects appeared following the redistribution of seats in 1885 which led to the creation of additional constituencies in Glamorgan. In April 1885, Thomas was among six candidates nominated by the local Liberal Association for selection as candidate for the Rhondda constituency. Shortly afterwards, Thomas emerged as a leading contender for the Liberal nomination in East Glamorganshire, and after several months of campaigning he saw off the challenge of his main rival, Bowen Rowlands. At the 1885 general election Thomas was elected Member of Parliament for East Glamorganshire, winning over 70% of the votes and defeating his Conservative opponent Godfrey Clark by 2,800 votes. He continued to represent the constituency until his retirement at the December 1910 general election. In 1891, Thomas, working with T. E. Ellis introduced the National Institutions (Wales) Bill, providing for a Secretary of State for Wales and a University of Wales, as well as a Welsh Parliament, to be located in Aberystwyth. The Bill did not secure a Second Reading. He was also involved with Cymru Fydd, serving as President of the Welsh National Federation, the body formed by the merger of Cymru Fydd and the North Wales Liberal Federation. He was elected Chairman of the Welsh Parliamentary Liberal Party in 1898. He was knighted in the 1902 Coronation Honours, receiving the accolade from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October that year. He was raised to the peerage as Baron Pontypridd, of Cardiff in the County of Glamorgan, in 1912, with the motto \\"Bit Ben Bit Bont\\" (Let Him Be Himself the Bridge), a motto taken from the Mabinogion. ==Other public positions== Apart from his political career Thomas was a Justice of the Peace for Cardiff and Glamorgan, Deputy Lieutenant for Glamorgan from December 1901, first President of the National Museum of Wales, President of Cardiff University and President of the Baptist Union of Wales for 1886. Thomas was a staunch Nonconformist, a member and deacon of Tabernacle Baptist Church, Cardiff. Despite his busy Parliamentary career, he made every effort to attend the mid-week prayer meeting, and combined his Parliamentary duties with the post of superintendent of the Sunday School, which he held for a generation. His election as a deacon of Tabernacle was one of his most prized honours, being conferred on him by those who knew him best. He composed hymn tunes and was committed to the cause of gospel temperance. He was involved in the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival. ==Personal life== Lord Pontypridd never married and the title became extinct on his death in December 1927, aged 87. He left almost all of his estate, including his home, Bronwydd, Penylan, to the City of Cardiff. He is buried with his parents in Cathays Cemetery. Bronwydd no longer exists, having been demolished as part of the construction of Eastern Avenue, but a 'Bronwydd Close' nearby recalls its location. ==ReferencesSourcesBooks and Journals=== * * ==Sources== *Alfred Thomas, Welsh Biography Online. *'Great Welshmen of Modern Days' by Sir Thomas Hughes. *Thomas Family Monument, Cathays Cemetery, Cardiff *Alfred Thomas Papers, Cardiff Central Library Category:1840 births Category:1927 deaths Category:Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom Category:Councillors in Wales Category:Deputy Lieutenants of Glamorgan Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Welsh Christian clergy Thomas, Alfred Category:Politicians from Cardiff Category:People associated with Cardiff University Thomas, Alfred Thomas, Alfred Thomas, Alfred Thomas, Alfred Thomas, Alfred Thomas, Alfred Thomas, Alfred Category:UK MPs who were granted peerages Category:Welsh Baptists Category:Mayors of Cardiff Category:Alumni of Regent's Park College, London Category:Councillors in Cardiff ","title":"Alfred Thomas, 1st Baron Pontypridd"},{"id":"6197960","text":"Heerdt is one of the older parts of the city of Düsseldorf.

She graduated in 1969 and received he A.J. Due Bois award. After holding down a number of different jobs she started her own building services company, Centennial One, in 1976. After she sold that, she engaged in public speaking and published a memoir. == Biography  Early life and education === Lambert grew up in Ballsville, Virginia, fifty miles west of Richmond. She was the daughter of a teacher and a farmerOpening Doors and Giving Back: Lillian Lincoln and AASU's Early Years and was raised on a Powhatan County farm. Growing up, she did chores in the fields, but \\"had a thirst for knowledge\\" and read in her spare time. \\"Intent on making her mark in a big city\\" she went to New York after high school but the only work she found was as a maid. After three years in New York, she moved to Washington, D.C., found work in government typing pools and attended teachers' college part-time. At age 22, she transferred to Howard University and studied business. While at Howard, she met H. Naylor Fitzhugh, one of the first blacks to attend Harvard Business School (MBA in 1933). Lambert worked as Fitzhugh's research assistant at Howard and Fitzhugh became her mentor. He persuaded her to apply to HBS. In the fall of 1967, Lambert registered for Harvard Business School, not realizing until she arrived that she was the only black woman at HBS: of the 800 students in her class, only 6 were black and 18 female. During her first year, Lambert and four black classmates -- A. Leroy Willis, Clifford E. Darden, Theodore Lewis and George Robert Price—talked about the need to increase the number of blacks at the school, and they started the HBS African-American Student Union (AASU). Dean George P. Baker supported the group and approached corporations to raise additional scholarship money.Alumni Achievement Awards Over the course of two years, AASU increased the number of African-American students sevenfold, increased financial aid for African-American students and provided career development opportunities. === Career === Before graduating in 1969, Lambert was not interviewed or recruited by a single company. She decided to return to her previous employer in D.C. - a management consulting company, Sterling. After the company closed its Washington office, she held various jobs, including stockbroker, management trainee, job-training consultant, and business professor at Bowie State. Then, a former colleague recommended her for a job as executive vice president of Unified Services, a building maintenance business. She says of the experience, \\"As his second-in-command I ran this guy's company for several years\\". In 1976, she launched her own building services company, Centennial One, headquartered in Landover, Maryland. Starting with 20 part-time employees, $4,000 in savings, a $12,000 line of credit, and an office in her garage, she built Centennial One into a company that made over $20 million in revenues, 1200 employees and has operations in four states.A Pioneer Woman on the MBA Frontier Looks Back The company offered a range of services from carpet cleaning to landscaping. Her roster of clients included ABC News, Dulles Airport, Hewlett-Packard, NationsBank, Northrop Grumman and Arthur D. Little. In 1995, she was the first woman to serve as president of an international association of building service contractors. Lambert sold Centennial One in 2001 and began a successful speaking career, and wrote a book about her experiences, The Road to Someplace Better: From the Segregated South to Harvard Business School and Beyond (published by Wiley, 2010). === Honors === In 2003, Harvard Business School awarded Lambert the Alumni Achievement Award, the highest award bestowed on its alumni. The award recognizes recipients for \\"the contributions they made to their companies and communities, while upholding the highest standards and values in everything they do.\\" In 2010, Lambert was inducted into Enterprise Women Magazine's Enterprising Women Hall of Fame.

It was edited to about three-and-a-half minutes for its single release. After Bananarama recorded the soundtrack song \\"The Wild Life\\" (from the film of the same name), the edited version of \\"Hot Line to Heaven\\" was pressed onto the Bananarama album in order to make room for the late-addition of \\"The Wild Life\\". This was only a temporary pressing, however, as Bananarama's track listing was restored several months later, with the full version of \\"Hot Line to Heaven\\" intact. The single did not perform well on the charts and got very limited release outside of UK.

(), commonly referred to as Olympiacos and Olympiacos Piraeus, is a Greek professional basketball club based in Piraeus, part of the major multi-sport club, Olympiacos CFP. The team currently competes only in the EuroLeague, after their decision to withdraw from the 2018–19 games against arch-rival Panathinaikos over long-standing refereeing disputes; thus, the club is represented by a reserve team for the domestic competitions, called Olympiacos B.C. B Development Team. The parent club was founded in 1925, with the basketball team created in 1931, and their home ground is the Peace and Friendship Stadium in Piraeus. Olympiacos has been established as one of the most successful clubs in Greek basketball history and one of the most successful clubs in European basketball, having won three EuroLeagues, one FIBA Intercontinental Cup, one Triple Crown, twelve Greek League titles and nine Greek Cups. As a traditional European powerhouse, Olympiacos have also been five times EuroLeague runners-up and, having played a total of eight finals, they are the Greek club with the most EuroLeague Final appearances. They have also participated in ten EuroLeague Final Fours. The first major achievement of Olympiacos in European competitions was their presence in the 1978–79 FIBA European Champions Cup semifinals group stage, but it was in the 1990s that Olympiacos made their biggest mark. They became the first ever Greek club that reached the EuroLeague Final, being runners-up in two consecutive seasons (1994 and 1995), winning their first EuroLeague title in 1997, after a convincing 73–58 win to Barcelona in Rome, which was a record margin win at the time for one-leg final in the competition's history. In the same season, they achieved the first Triple Crown for a Greek team and as European champions they played in the 1997 McDonald's Championship, where they met in the final the Michael Jordan's NBA champions, the Chicago Bulls. During the 1990s, besides their constant achievements in EuroLeague, also adding a third place in 1999, Olympiacos dominated the Greek Basket League with five consecutive titles, at a time when the Greek championship was considered Europe's best national basketball league. Thus, FIBA declared Olympiacos as the \\"Best European Team of the 1990s\\". Olympiacos returned to the very top of European basketball in 2010, when they reached the final against Barcelona in Paris, but mostly in 2012, when they won their second EuroLeague title in Istanbul, by rallying from 19 points down in the championship game, to beat CSKA Moscow 62–61, on the last shot of the game, achieving the greatest comeback in European basketball finals history, and one of the greatest ever seen in European continental basketball. In 2013, Olympiacos won their third EuroLeague title and became the only Greek club and only the third club in European basketball history to be crowned back-to-back European champions in the modern EuroLeague Final Four era, after beating Real Madrid 100–88 in the London final. Later on, Olympiacos won the Intercontinental Cup, celebrating a third international title in 17 months. Some of the greatest players in European basketball have played for Olympiacos over the years including: Charlie Yelverton, Carey Scurry, Žarko Paspalj, Giorgos Sigalas, Dragan Tarlać, Walter Berry, Panagiotis Fasoulas, Roy Tarpley, Eddie Johnson, Alexander Volkov, David Rivers, Chris Welp, Artūras Karnišovas, Arijan Komazec, Dino Rađja, Theo Papaloukas, Alphonso Ford, Tyus Edney, Arvydas Macijauskas, Ioannis Bourousis, Miloš Teodosić, Nikola Vujčić, Josh Childress, Linas Kleiza, Rašho Nesterović, Kostas Papanikolaou, Kostas Sloukas, Kyle Hines, Joey Dorsey, Stratos Perperoglou, Acie Law, Georgios Printezis and Vassilis Spanoulis. Under the ownership of billionaire Greek brothers Panagiotis Angelopoulos and Giorgos Angelopoulos, Olympiacos made a record transfer in 2008, by signing NBA player Josh Childress, whose US$20 million net income contract for three years made him the highest-paid basketball player in the world ever, outside the NBA. ==History1930s–1960s=== Olympiacos team in 1943 The club had its beginnings in the 1930s. Olympiacos was the first Greek team to familiarize itself with American style basketball, as Alekos Spanoudakis learned to imitate the American style jump shot, and his brother, Ioannis Spanoudakis (who was both player and head coach of the team), met basketball legend Bob Cousy, and practiced many of his secrets and techniques on the court. The Spanoudakis brothers led the club to its first Greek League championship in 1949. The second title didn't come until 11 years later, in 1960, and allowed the Reds for the first time to qualify for the European Champions Cup (now called EuroLeague) (1960–61 season), which was their first ever participation at the European-wide level. ===1970s–1980s=== It wasn't until 1976 that coach Faidon Matthaiou managed to create a strong team based on the stars Steve Giatzoglou, Giorgos Kastrinakis, Giorgos Barlas and on strong team players like Paul Melini and Pavlos Diakoulas. Olympiacos would win another Greek title and it did so in unprecedented fashion, running off 22 victories in 22 games. Reds completed the first double in their history, winning the Greek Cup, while they did very well in the Cup Winner's Cup as well, reaching the last 8. The next year, Kostas Mourouzis was appointed as head coach and the team won the Greek cup, after eliminating Panathinaikos with a record-setting 110–68 away win (42 points difference, the highest ever in the games between the two teams). Melini led Olympiacos with 24 points, while Kastrinakis scored 22. In 1978 the team did their second double in 3 years, winning both the Greek championship (losing only 1 game) and their third Greek cup in a row, beating AEK 103–88 in the final. In 1979 the club also had their first significant success in Europe, reaching the final round (Final-6) of the European Championship. The final round of that year was one of the toughest ever in the competition. Olympiacos finished 6th, winning only one game, the 79–77 home victory against Maccabi Elite Tel Aviv. In general, Olympiacos was a tough home team and although they lost all the rest of their home matches, the scores were really close: 84–95 to Joventut Freixenet (77–91 away), 68–72 to Emerson Varese (67–92 away), 97–101 to Real Madrid (72–113 away), 83–88 to Bosna (72–89 away). Olympiacos won another Greek Cup title in 1980 which was the last of the successful Giatzoglou–Kastrinakis era. In 1979, 1980 and 1981 Olympiacos finished at the second place of the Greek championship. Although the 1970s was the most successful decade for the team up to that time, the 1980s marked a low period for the Reds, who didn't manage to play a major domestic role, being outshined by the up-and-coming superpowers from Thessaloniki, Aris and PAOK. The team was led by Greek players such as Dimitris Maniatis and Argiris Kambouris, the hero of EuroBasket 1987, but their strong effort wasn't enough to bring any significant results. Well-known players such as Carey Scurry and Todd Mitchell couldn't lead the club to success. ===1990s: FIBA's Best European Team of the 1990s=== Giannis Ioannidis It was in the 1990s that the Reds made their biggest mark. The middle of that decade belonged to Olympiacos, not only in Greece, but also in Europe. In the 1991–92 season, record holding Greek basketball coach Giannis Ioannidis left Aris to manage Olympiacos, the torpid giant, and created a tough, team-oriented, offensive basketball team. In addition to this, Olympiacos left the old Papastrateio Indoor Hall, to move into Peace and Friendship Stadium (commonly called SEF), an indoor arena at that time of 17,000 seats and the biggest in Greece until the Olympic Indoor Hall was inaugurated in 1995. By that year the club had fully rebounded, climbing all the way back to rule Greece. Five consecutive Greek Championships from 1993 to 1997 and two Greek Cups in 1994 and 1997, made the team the indubitable dominant club in Greece. During this period, Olympiacos was the best supported basketball team, not only in Greece but in Europe as well, as Peace and Friendship Stadium was full in most of their matches, making Olympiacos invincible in it. In addition to their domestic success, Olympiacos became the most successful team in the EuroLeague of that period, leading FIBA to select them as the Best European Team in the decade of the 1990s. 5 Greek championships in a row, twice EuroLeague runners-up Eddie Johnson In the 1992–93 season, in their first year in the FIBA European League, after a hard run which started in Hala Tivoli against Smelt Olimpija (for the second preliminary round) and continued in the top 16 round where Olympiacos ranked third in a tough group and qualified for the quarterfinal play-offs, together with Real Madrid Teka of Arvydas Sabonis, Benetton Treviso of Toni Kukoč and Pau-Orthez of Gheorghe Mureșan. However they didn't manage to qualify for the 1993 FIBA European League Final Four in Piraeus, Athens which was held at their home court, Peace and Friendship Stadium, as they were eliminated by Limoges CSP in the quarter-finals with 2–1 wins, after a breathtaking third game in Palais des Sports de Beaublanc (58–60), which was decided in the last seconds after an off-balance two-points shot by the Slovenian star Jure Zdovc. Domestically, despite finishing 4th in the Greek A1 regular season, Olympiacos eliminated in the quarter-finals with 2–0 wins the FIBA European Cup champions Sato Aris but at the same time lost to Aris (66–71) for the Greek Cup semifinal game in their homeseat and excluded from the 1993 Cup Final (the final was set by E.O.K. to take place in SEF). Finally Olympiacos won their first Greek Championship since 1978, defeating in the semi-finals with 3–1 wins a totally disappointed PAOK by the failure at the Final Four in Athens, and then Panathinaikos in the finals with 3–1 wins as well, even though both of Olympiacos' opponents had the home-court advantage. The following year, Olympiacos had a top-class roster with players like Roy Tarpley, Žarko Paspalj, Dragan Tarlać, Panagiotis Fasoulas, Giorgos Sigalas, Milan Tomić, Franco Nakić and Efthimis Bakatsias, and reached the FIBA European League Final Four in Yad Eliyahu Stadium, Tel Aviv for the first time in their history. After an impressive run in the top 16, achieving significant away wins for the first time in the European history of the club against Real Madrid Teka (58–57 in Palacio de Deportes) or against Benetton Treviso (79–73 in PalaVerde) and a newfound home victory by 18 points difference against FC Barcelona Banca Catalana (82–64), the \\"Reds\\" qualified as group winners (11–3 record) for the quarter-final playoffs where they faced the ranked fourth of the group B, the Italian champions Buckler Beer Bologna of Yugoslav superstar Sasha Danilović and eliminated them hardly with 2–1 wins. In the Tel Aviv Final Four which was looked like an Athenaic-Catalan tournament demonstration, they faced their arch-rivals Panathinaikos in the semi-final (by the way the other semi-final was FC Barcelona Banca Catalana vs 7up Joventut), beating them 77–72 and becoming the first Greek team to ever play in the Euroleague Final. Paspalj scored 22 points and Tarpley recorded a double-double against Panathinaikos, scoring 21 points and grabbing no less than 16 rebounds for Olympiacos. The \\"Reds\\", despite being strong favourites to win the European crown, lost 57–59 to 7up Joventut in the final after a dramatic ending. Domestically, they had a very successful season, as they managed to celebrate the Double, winning an extremely competitive Greek Championship with 3–2 wins against PAOK Bravo of Bane Prelević, Walter Berry and Zoran Savić -who had been crowned FIBA Korać Cup champions two months earlier- and the Greek Cup as well, beating Stiebel Eltron Iraklis 63–51 in the final in SEF. In the 1994–95 season, Olympiacos with the NBA veteran and 3-point specialist Eddie Johnson and the great Ukrainian combo-forward Sasha Volkov as additives in a very attached roster that was experienced from the participation in the next season Final Four of Tel Aviv, started the season as one of the favorites for participation in the Final Four and winning the European championship. In addition to domestic competitions Olympiacos had become regime and the goal was winning the double. The aim of the Greek Cup extinguished from the beginning after the defeat by Panathinaikos with the strangeness 40–42 in the knock-out match that held in the Sporting Indoor Hall because Olympiacos was punished for the events that take place in the fifth final of the last season play-offs against PAOK. In Europe the team launched their obligations with a resounding victory (77–42) at Abdi İpekçi Arena against Efes Pilsen, continued with some extended victories at home (101–69 against risky Cibona, 84–53 against the decadent European champions of 7up Joventut, 89–64 against Buckler Beer Bologna), achieved the classical double win against Bayer 04 Leverkusen of Dirk Bauermann, did the classical double defeat by the Limouzo of Božidar Maljković, crashed (99–78) FC Barcelona Banca Catalana in SEF and eventually qualified as second from the group B with the homecourt advantage in their pocket. Olympiacos eliminated CSKA Moscow with 2–1 wins in the quarter-final playoffs and reached their second FIBA European League Final Four in Pabellón Príncipe Felipe, Zaragoza, facing again their eternal enemies Panathinaikos in the semi-final. They defeated them one more time 58–52, with 27 points and 10 rebounds from club legend Eddie Johnson, including four decisive 3-pointers in the final minutes of the game, thus advancing to the EuroLeague Final for the second consecutive year. There, they played against another Spanish team, Real Madrid Teka, who were playing on their home soil and managed to defeat Olympiacos 61–73. Domestically, the Reds managed to win their third consecutive Greek Championship with 3–2 wins in the best-of-five finals against Panathinaikos, after a thrilling 45–44 home win against their arch- rivals in the decisive fifth and last match. In the next season, 1995–96, although Olympiacos made an excellent course in the FIBA European League top 16 group stage and achieved a 10–4 record, he ranked third in the group because in the triple tie with CSKA Moscow and the FIBA European Cup champions of Benetton Treviso had the disadvantage with 1–3 wins. In the quarter-finals Olympiacos faced Real Madrid Teka with home-court disadvantage and didn't manage to make the Final Four for a third season in a row, losing the play-off series with 1–2 wins (68–49 win in Piraeus, 77–80 and 65–80 losses in Madrid). However, the season ended in an extremely memorable way, because in the last game of the best-of-five series of the Greek League Finals, Olympiacos smashed arch-rivals and European champions Panathinaikos with a thrashing 73–38 victory, an all-time record victory margin (35 points) for the Greek League Finals and the second largest winning margin in an Olympiacos–Panathinaikos game after Olympiacos' 110–68 (42-point margin) record away win against Panathinaikos in the Greek Cup in 1977. Five players scored in double digits (Rivers 16 points, Tarlać 14, Nakić 12, Berry and Sigalas 10 each) and led Olympiacos to their fourth consecutive Greek Championship in front of their ecstatic fans, who celebrated the title and the historic win in a euphoric frenzy at Peace and Friendship Stadium. European Champions and Triple Crown Glory Dušan Ivković In the 1996–97 season, with a new coach, Dušan Ivković at the bench, the Reds and their fans had more hope than ever for the European title. In the regular season of the EuroLeague Olympiacos' performance was not as good as it was in the previous years, but in the play- offs they were impressive, twice breaking their opponents home court advantage. Their first victim was Partizan. In a strange best of three series, Olympiacos won the first match with 81–71 in Belgrade, lost the second at Peace and Friendship Stadium (61–60), which disappointed their fans, and finally won the third game in Belgrade with 74–69, which advanced them to the quarter-finals where the defending champions Panathinaikos were waiting for them with a home court advantage. Panathinaikos was ready to stop their rivals and take the revenge for the last year's smashing 73–38 defeat in the Greek finals. In the first game of the series at Panathinaikos' home, the Athens Olympic Indoor Hall, Olympiacos once again thrashed the Greens, beating them 69–49 in front of their own fans. After the 20-point difference triumph in their rivals' court, they were only one win away from the Final Four. In the second match, at Peace and Friendship Stadium, in front of 17,000 ecstatic Reds fans, Olympiacos beat Panathinaikos once more by a score of 65–57 and advanced to the Final Four in Rome.FIBA Europe.com Game CardInternational Herald Tribune, European Basketball: Passionate Greek Drama by Ian Thomsen, 3 April 1997 Olympiacos were the unquestionable favorites to win the EuroLeague championship and they made it, after two dominating performances in the Final Four. They faced Smelt Olimpija in the semi-final and beat them 74–65, with David Rivers scoring 28 points. In the final, they played against FC Barcelona Banca Catalana, and after an impressive display, they won by a score of 73–58, and became European Champions for the first time in their history. Rivers led Olympiacos, scoring an average of 27 points in the two games, and was eventually voted Final Four MVP. The thousands of Olympiacos fans who filled Palaeur arena, were quick to sing that, \\"in Rome, in the final, we lifted the European title\\" (Greek: Στη Ρώμη και στον τελικό, σηκώσαμε Ευρωπαϊκό). This remains one of the club's most popular chants to this day. Olympiacos went on to complete the coveted Triple Crown in convincing fashion: they won the Greek League title (with 3–1 wins against the season's surprise team AEK) and the Greek Cup (beating Dexim Apollon Patras 80–78 in the final, in Olympic Indoor Hall), to mark the most successful season in the club's long history. Olympiacos became the first Greek team to ever win the Triple Crown, and remained the only to do so one up until 2007. McDonald's Championship finalists against the Chicago Bulls In October of the same year, the club played in the 1997 McDonald's Championship, in Paris. Having defeated Atenas in the semifinal by 89–86, Olympiacos played against the NBA champions Chicago Bulls in the final. The game was played under zone-friendly European rules (the games between NBA and FIBA teams were played under a mixture of NBA and FIBA rules at that time), but, out of respect for the Bulls, Olympiacos never used a zone defense. Olympiacos was defeated 78–104, by the Bulls, and one of the greatest basketball players ever, Michael Jordan. In the 1997–98 season, Olympiacos were once again the favorites in all the competitions they were taking part. They started the season with an impressive record of consecutive wins in Greece and Europe. But in the second half of the season, things went wrong for the team. Olympiacos played in the round of 16 of the EuroLeague, with a home court advantage against Partizan in a three-game series, but they lost both matches in Athens and Belgrade and the European Champions suffered an early and disappointing elimination. In the Greek Cup's Final Four, they faced Panathinaikos for the 3rd place and they won easily. In the Greek League, Olympiacos finished the regular season in second place, behind Panathinaikos. In the semi-finals, Olympiacos faced PAOK, having a home court advantage in a best of three series. In the first match in Athens, Olympiacos took a tight 66–65 win and held the advantage. They lost the second match in Thessaloniki, and the last game was held again in Athens. Olympiacos lost 58–55 in Neo Faliro, marking the first ever defeat for the team in Peace and Friendship Stadium during the Greek playoffs. The Reds didn't have the chance to defend their crown and they ended up in third place, with a 3–1 series win over AEK. The 1998–99 season didn't begin well, because in the season's opening match of the Greek Cup, Olympiacos was eliminated by PAOK. The Reds played once again in the EuroLeague Final Four, and although they were considered the favorites to win the title, they lost 71–87 in the semi-final to the eventual winners Žalgiris. They finished third, defeating Teamsystem Bologna 74–63 in the 3rd place game. In the Greek League they were the favorites to win the championship, but despite having the home advantage in the finals against Panathinaikos, they were defeated in the last game of the series at home and lost the title. That was the first time Olympiacos lost a playoff game to Panathinaikos in SEF after 10 consecutive wins. In the 1999–2000 season, Olympiacos didn't make the EuroLeague playoffs, as they were eliminated in the round of 16 by Union Olimpija. On the contrary, they finished first in the regular season of the Greek League and entered the playoffs having home court advantage. But in the semi-finals they played against fourth-placed PAOK and they were eliminated, losing the first game at home and the second one in Thessaloníki. Olympiacos faced AEK for the third place and won. ===2000s=== 2000–2002 Theo Papaloukas In the 2000–01 season, Olympiacos played in the first EuroLeague competition that was organized by EuroLeague Basketball, but despite having home court advantage in the playoffs they were eliminated by Tau Cerámica. In the Greek League Finals, they finished second. In the 2001–02 season, the club managed to win the Greek Cup, their first trophy since 1997,Olympiacos – Welcome to EuroLeague Basketball, EuroLeague official website, Retrieved 31 December 2010. in a Final Four tournament that was held at Peace and Friendship Stadium. They beat Panathinaikos 83–75 in the semi-final and Maroussi 74–66 in the final. Then they came within one victory of the EuroLeague Final Four. They played in the Top 16 in a group against Panathinaikos, AEK and Union Olimpija, with only the first placed team advancing to the Final Four. After Olympiacos completed an easy 92–75 win over Panathinaikos with Alphonso Ford scoring 21 points in the opening home match, another home win against AEK, and an away win against Olimpija, they played an away game against Panathinaikos and lost 78–88. The score of that game gave the Reds the aggregate advantage in case they finished on the top of the group along with their rivals, a scenario that looked highly probable. However, in the fifth group game, the weakest team of the group, Union Olimpija, stunned Olympiacos in Athens by winning their single game in the group. This put Olympiacos in second place and despite their away win against AEK in the last game of the group, their unexpected loss against Olimpija kept them out of the Final Four in Bologna. In the Greek League the Reds eliminated Peristeri in the quarter-finals and managed to break the home court advantage of Panathinaikos in the first game of the playoffs semi-final with a well-deserved 80–89 win in OAKA and after a thrilling second win at home with 80–76, they eliminated them and made it to the finals. In the finals, they managed to break AEK's home court advantage in the first game of the series (82–74) and after a second comfortable win at SEF in Game 2 (75–70) they were very close to the title. Despite starting the finals with those two comfortable wins, their 2–0 lead didn't prove enough as they lost three games in a row and let the title slip away. Olympiacos was one of the EuroLeague's most dangerous teams in 2002–03 as well. They had a decent regular season, finishing third in a tough group of eight teams and qualified to the next phase at the expense of teams like Real Madrid and Partizan. The club came closer than any team to knocking off the eventual champions FC Barcelona in two heartbreaking games in the EuroLeague Top 16 groups (55–58, 77–80) and proved, despite the fact that they were not at their best during the early 2000s, that they were able to beat any team at any time. 2003–2005 crisis The 2003–04 and 2004–05 seasons were the worst in the modern history of Olympiacos. In both seasons, the team was eliminated in the Greek Cup and finished in the 8th place of the Greek League. Especially in the latter season, Olympiacos had a dismaying performance in the EuroLeague, which filled many of the club's fans with uncertainty. 2006: Rebirth Josh Childress The 2005–06 season saw the return of the Red giants, which overcame the previous down years with a nice combination of young talent and experienced veterans which paid off for the club. Players added to the club like Renaldas Seibutis, Quincy Lewis, Panagiotis Vasilopoulos, Georgios Printezis and, above all, Sofoklis Schortsanitis, were viewed by some to be a possible solid core of players for the team for many years to come. That season seemed to be very promising for the Red giants. However, the promising Reds were eliminated from the Greek Cup in their first knock-out match of the competition. Olympiacos survived a difficult EuroLeague regular season and shined in the Top 16, advancing to the quarterfinal playoffs. The Reds were just a win away from making it to the Final Four for the first time since 1999. Maccabi Elite Tel Aviv won the best-of-three playoff series 2–1, but game 3 went down to the wire. Experience proved to be a decisive factor in the final 2 minutes of the game, when the hosts managed to seal a 77–73 win and advanced to the Final Four in Prague. Tyus Edney earned EuroLeague February MVP honors, as well as ranking third in assists at the end of the regular season and second in the Top 16. Olympiacos also shined in its domestic competition, as the Reds made it to the Greek League finals for the first time in five years by surviving a thrilling five-game series against Maroussi. Despite their losing in the final playoff series, it was clear that the Reds were back where they used to be, becoming a team able to challenge for every title. In the 2006–07 season, with the signings of head coach Pini Gershon and Arvydas Macijauskas, the Reds were one of the favorites to claim the EuroLeague crown, but they didn't manage to qualify to the Athens Final Four. They were eliminated from the Greek Cup as well. In the Greek League playoffs, they made it to the finals after winning 3–2 a best of five semifinal against Aris. Although Olympiacos had to overcome their home court disadvantage, they won the last match in Thessaloniki and made it to the best of five finals, having again a home court disadvantage, this time against Panathinaikos. The club had to beat their arch-rivals in order to win their first Greek Championship since 1997. But they finished second in one of the best final series ever played in the Greek League. At the opening game of the series in Panathinaikos' home, the Reds lost 72–79, but they won the second game in Peace and Friendship Stadium 76–72. In the third match, Olympiacos lost 86–85 in overtime, with the Reds complaining furiously against the referees, who didn't call a clear foul against Scoonie Penn with only 3 seconds left in the game. Olympiacos won the next game easily, 78–68 in Piraeus, but in the last away game, the Reds lost 76–89. 2007–2008 season Miloš Teodosić In the 2007–08 season, Olympiacos was once again considered amongst the favorites to reach the Final Four of the EuroLeague. It was also considered one of the two favorites, along with Panathinaikos, to win the Greek championship. In the Greek League regular season the team had a record of 22 wins and 4 defeats, and had the second most prolific offensive team in the league. In the quarter- finals of the playoffs, Olympiacos swept AEK Athens in a best-of-three series and in the semi-finals they beat Maroussi in a best-of-five series, 3–2. They finally finished second, losing in the finals of the Greek League. They also reached the final of the Greek Cup after 4 years, but they didn't manage to take the title. In the EuroLeague, the team qualified for the third phase of the competition (quarter-finals). They played against the eventual winners CSKA Moscow and despite grabbing a thrilling away win in the first match of the series in CSKA Universal Sports Hall in Moscow (76–74 with Qyntel Woods scoring 20 points and Lynn Greer sinking a spectacular game-winning buzzer beater which ended CSKA's 27-game winning streak at home), they lost the second game in Piraeus and were eventually eliminated by 2–1 wins after the third game in Moscow. 2008–2009 season: Return to Euroleague Final Four The 2008–09 season began with high expectations due to a big budget and a great roster with players like Josh Childress, Theo Papaloukas, Miloš Teodosić, Nikola Vujčić, Ioannis Bourousis, Lynn Greer, Panagiotis Vasilopoulos, Sofoklis Schortsanitis and Georgios Printezis. The club's season was only moderately successful however, as they reached the finals of both the Greek Cup and the Greek Championship. In the Greek Championship regular season, the team set a record with 25 wins against only 1 defeat, but in the finals of the Greek League playoffs, they lost the series 3–1, despite having the home court advantage. In the EuroLeague, they reached the Final Four for the first time in 10 years, eliminating Real Madrid with 3–1 wins. Having secured the home advantage, they won the first two games in Piraeus (88–79 and 79–73) and managed to secure an away win (75–78) in Madrid in Game 4 of the series, thus advancing to the EuroLeague Final Four after 1999. In the Final Four in Berlin, they faced arch-rivals Panathinaikos in a close, heartbreaking thriller: Olympiacos trailed by two points and had the ball for the last possession. The ball went to Bourousis but his close shot bounced out, with Childress being unable to score with a last-second tip as well. Despite the loss in a match that could have easily gone either way, the team's great effort and the club's return to the elite of European basketball were clear signs of their future success. 2009–2010 season: EuroLeague runners-up The 2009–10 season was the best in a long time for Olympiacos. The management wanted to bring another big player to the team, after Josh Childress. And they did, agreeing with the Lithuanian NBA player of the Denver Nuggets, Linas Kleiza. With the help of these two and under the guidance of coach Panagiotis Giannakis the club managed to take the Greek Cup defeating their arch-rivals Panathinaikos 68–64 in the final. In the EuroLeague, the Reds had an impressive run in the regular season and the Top 16, finishing as group winners in both phases. In the quarter-final playoffs, the faced the Polish champions Asseco Prokom and eliminated them with 3–1 wins, reaching for the second consecutive season the EuroLeague Final Four which was held in Paris. In the semi-final the team managed to defeat Partizan 83–80 in overtime in a thrilling match, with Kleiza scoring 19 points. Olympiacos returned to the EuroLeague Final after 1997, facing Regal FC Barcelona, the very team they had beaten in the 1997 Final. History didn't repeat itself, as Olympiacos lost 68–86 to FC Barcelona in the final. In the Greek Championship finals, the club lost 3–1 wins to Panathinaikos after an intense third game that would have put them ahead 1–2, with the Reds having again huge complaints over the referees' performance.Redplanet.gr The fourth game of the series was disrupted several times and the arena was cleared of all fans in order to complete the remaining few minutes. ===2010s=== 2010–2011 season In July 2010, Olympiacos offered a three-year contract worth €13,200,000 euros gross income to the famous Greek guard Vassilis Spanoulis, and came to an agreement with the player. The great Serbian coach Dušan Ivković agreed with the club, and with a roster of players such as Miloš Teodosić, Vassilis Spanoulis, Theo Papaloukas, Loukas Mavrokefalidis, Jamon Gordon, Rasho Nesterović, and Ioannis Bourousis, Olympiacos became a favorite to win the 2010–11 EuroLeague. In the opening game of the Top 16, Olympiacos got a 70–84 defeat in Athens, against Fenerbahçe Ülker, but one month later, Olympiacos defeated the Turkish champions with a 65–80 win in Istanbul, and took the first place of the Top 16 Group H. In the quarter-finals, Olympiacos faced Montepaschi Siena. In the first game of a best-of-five series, the Reds achieved a great performance, defeating Montepaschi with an 89–41 score, at the Peace and Friendship stadium, in Athens, but the Italian club managed to win the second game (65–82), breaking the home advantage of the Reds. Olympiacos didn't manage to win any of the next two away games, and got eliminated from the 2011 EuroLeague Final Four. On 15 May 2011, Olympiacos defeated arch-rivals Panathinaikos, 74–68, in the Greek Cup Final, and won the ninth Greek Cup in the club's history. In the Greek League, Olympiacos took the first place in the regular season, but despite earning home-court advantage for the finals, they lost the first game at home, and suffered a 3–1 defeat in a best-of-five series, as they let a chance at the championship slip away. 2011–2012 season: European and Greek champions Vassilis Spanoulis Georgios Printezis In the summer of 2011, Olympiacos saw many experienced players leave the team, after a reduction of the team's budget by over 50%. The youthful team under coach Dušan Ivković initially heavily depended on team leader Vassilis Spanoulis, losing games regularly when he wasn't playing. The team that the press thought might not even qualify for the Top 16, improved dramatically over the course of the season, and under the great performances of Vassilis Spanoulis, Georgios Printezis, Kostas Papanikolaou, Kyle Hines, Joey Dorsey, Pero Antić, Acie Law, Kostas Sloukas, and Vangelis Mantzaris, Olympiacos managed to reach the 2011–12 EuroLeague Final Four in Istanbul, after breaking the home-advantage of the Italian champions, Montepaschi Siena, winning with a 75–82 score in the first game of a best-of-five series in Italy, in a reversal of the previous season's quarter-finals. Going to Istanbul as an outsider, Olympiacos upset the odds, and beat the two favourites, FC Barcelona Regal in the semifinal, with a score 68–64, and CSKA Moscow in the final, with a 62–61 score, coming back after trailing by 19 points in the most dramatic final in the history of EuroLeague. Printezis scored a game-winner, off an assist from Spanoulis, with a few tenths of a second left, to complete the epic comeback, and give Olympiacos the win, and the second EuroLeague Championship in their history. Vassilis Spanoulis, the man who provided the assist for Printezis' buzzer-beating hook-shot, was voted Final Four MVP. The most successful season of the Reds since 1997, was completed by seizing the Greek Championship as well. They eliminated PAOK in the quarter-finals, and Panionios in the semi- finals, securing their spot in the Greek Finals undefeated. They entered the Greek Finals having the home-court advantage, after their first place in the regular season, and their impressive 23–1 record. There, Olympiacos faced their arch-rivals Panathinaikos, and won the best-of-five series 3–2 (84–78, 84–72, 82–76), celebrating the tenth Greek Championship in their history, and their first since 1997. 2012–2013 season: Back-to-back European champions Georgios Bartzokas Pero Antić holding Olympiacos 2013 back-to- back Euroleague trophy in London Acie Law wearing the golden-badged back-to- back European Champions 2012–2013 Olympiacos jersey After the end of a dreamy season, both domestically and internationally, legendary coach Dušan Ivković decided to leave the club, leaving the club's owners, the Angelopoulos brothers, with a hard decision regarding his replacement. The club's owners decided to hire the highly promising Greek coach Georgios Bartzokas (who had very successful tenures in Marousi and Panionios) as the new head coach of the European Champions. Stratos Perperoglou, Giorgi Shermadini and the two-time NBA Champion Josh Powell joined the team to replace Marko Kešelj, Joey Dorsey, and Lazaros Papadopoulos. In May 2013, Olympiacos, under the guidance of coach Bartzokas, became EuroLeague Champion for the second year in a row, becoming the first and only Greek club, and the only club since Maccabi Tel Aviv in European-wide basketball, to become back-to-back EuroLeague Champions, in the Euroleague Basketball Company era (EuroLeague 2000–01 season to present), and only the third club in history since the establishment of the modern era Final Four format in 1987–88 season, to achieve that honour. After a solid display in both the regular season and the Top 16, they qualified for the quarter- finals, having earned the home advantage. They faced Anadolu Efes, and managed to eliminate the Turkish side, by winning the best-of-five series 3–2, after a thrilling Game 5 in SEF. Olympiacos managed to rally from a 15-point second- quarter deficit to win the game, with an 82–72 scoreline, thus securing the chance to defend their European crown in the Final Four. In the Final Four, Olympiacos managed to put forth two outstanding basketball displays. After rolling past CSKA Moscow with a smashing 69–52 win in the semifinal, they managed to beat Real Madrid 100–88 in the final at London's The O2 Arena, roaring back from a 17-point deficit in the first quarter, and scoring 90 points in the remaining three quarters. EuroLeague MVP Vassilis Spanoulis led the charge with 22 points (all in the second half), and was eventually voted Final Four MVP for the second consecutive season, and third overall in his career. Thus joining Toni Kukoč, as the only two players in history to achieve that distinction on three occasions. Acie Law scored 20 points with 5 assists, and Kyle Hines added 12 points with 3 blocks, one of which was a spectacular chase-down block on a fast break layup attempt by Nikola Mirotić. 2013–2014 season: FIBA Intercontinental champions After winning the EuroLeague championship for the second straight season, Olympiacos qualified to play at the 2013 edition of the FIBA Intercontinental Cup, against the 2013 FIBA Americas League champions, Pinheiros Sky, for the official Club World Cup title. The two-game aggregate score series was hosted in Ginásio José Corrêa Arena, in Barueri, São Paulo, and Olympiacos dominated the series. They won both games quite convincingly (2–0), winning the first game of the series by a score of 81 to 70, and the second game by a score of 86 to 69. Team captain Vassilis Spanoulis was named the 2013 FIBA Intercontinental Cup MVP.FoxSports.com O Herói e o Vilão de Olympiacos 86 x 69 Pinheiros, pelo Mundial de Clubes .Gazetaesportiva.net Olympiacos bate Pinheiros e vence Copa Intercontinental . Olympiacos lifted the trophy in front of their ecstatic fans from the Greek community of Brazil, and celebrated their third international title in less than 2 years. In the EuroLeague, they reached the quarter-finals, where they played against Real Madrid, the very team they had beaten in the previous year's final. Real Madrid entered the series with home- court advantage, and Olympiacos couldn't overturn the situation, losing the series 3–2 to the Spanish champions, after five intense games, and missing the chance to defend their back-to-back European crown. 2014–2015 season: Euroleague runners-up, Greek Champions Kostas Papanikolaou In the 2014–15 season, Olympiacos had another great season, reaching the EuroLeague Final, and seizing the Greek Championship in a convincing way. In EuroLeague, after an impressive run in the regular season and the Top 16, they qualified for the quarter-finals for the tenth consecutive season (2006–2015), which was an all- time record in European basketball history at the time, shared with FC Barcelona, the very club they were drawn to play against for a Final Four spot. FC Barcelona entered the series with the home-court advantage, and won the first game at home. Olympiacos bounced back from the loss, and managed to put on a top-class display in Game 2, beating FC Barcelona 63–76, at Palau Blaugrana. With the home-advantage in their hands, the Reds beat FC Barcelona twice at Peace and Friendship Stadium, winning the playoff series 3–1. Game 4 of the series was nothing less than a dramatic thriller. The game was tied at 68–68, with only 5.2 seconds remaining on game the clock. Olympiacos had possession of the ball, and just a small amount of time for a last play. The ball went to Georgios Printezis (hero of the 2012 EuroLeague Final), who hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer to secure the Final Four spot for his team (71–68), with Olympiacos fans erupting in frenetic celebrations. In the Final Four in Madrid, Olympiacos beat CSKA Moscow, 70–68, in the semifinal, coming back from a 9-point deficit in the last four minutes of the game. Captain Vassilis Spanoulis led Olympiacos to the final, by scoring 11 points in the last minutes of the 4th quarter, by hitting some really tough shots in the game's last crucial minutes. In the EuroLeague Final, Olympiacos didn't manage to win their third EuroLeague title in four years, as they lost to rivals Real Madrid, who played the final at their home court. Despite the title loss, Olympiacos proved yet again their dominating presence in European basketball, as they had become the most successful club in European basketball since 2008, with two EuroLeague Championships (2012, 2013), two other EuroLeague Finals appearances (2010, 2015), and five EuroLeague Final Four appearances in seven years (2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015). In Greece, Olympiacos had a great regular season, ending up with an impressive record of 25 wins and only 1 defeat. In the playoffs, they reached the finals, after eliminating Aris in the semi-finals (3–1 series win). In the finals, they totally dominated the series, and swept their arch-rivals Panathinaikos, with a 3–0 series win (76–70, 69–76, 93–74). Winning the 2015 Greek Championship in convincing fashion. Team head coach Ioannis Sfairopoulos' guidance, as well as the team's solid performance, both defensively and offensively, paved the way for the historic 3–0 series sweep in the Greek League Finals, which was met with big celebrations from Olympiacos fans, at the title ceremony in SEF. ===Withdrawal from games against Panathinaikos and relegation from the first division (2019)=== The 2018–19 season was the most turbulent in Olympiacos and Greek basketball history. It was the season that the ongoing feud between Olympiacos and Panathinaikos peaked, following Olympiacos decisions after their long- lasting protests for the relationship of the Hellenic Basketball Federation with Panathinaikos, the officiating in the games between the two arch-rivals and the exclusion of EuroLeague referees from national competitions. Initially, in the 2018–19 Greek Cup semifinal against Panathinaikos, Olympiacos decided to withdraw and to not return for the second half of the game in protest for the referees decisions, despite the possible sanctions for the team for leaving the game. This led Panathinaikos' owner, Dimitrios Giannakopoulos, to indecent acts, leaving a red woman's underwear on the empty Olympiacos bench, and dismissive statements against Olympiacos' owners Giorgos Angelopoulos and Panagiotis Angelopoulos. In the following day, Olympiacos announced that they would not play again any league or cup game against Panathinaikos, unless it was officiated exclusively by foreign referees, as well as any national competition game against any opponent, if any of the forementioned Cup semifinal's referees (Anastopoulos, Manos and Panagiotou) was set to officiate; furthermore, Giannakopoulos was not anymore allowed to enter the Peace and Friendship Stadium under any capacity he might be using, also asking from the authorities to investigate the extremely low betting odds for Panathinaikos to win the Cup semifinal, after the referees' names were announced. At first, Olympiacos was punished with a deduction of 6 points from the same year's league table. Olympiacos announced that their decisions were fully supported by the parent club's Olympiacos CFP chairman, Michalis Kountouris. As the time for the game of the 2018–19 Greek League's second round was approaching, Olympiacos officially informed the Hellenic Basketball Federation that they insist on their position not to play any game officiated by the three forementioned referees, or any game against Panathinaikos that will not be officiated by foreign referees. Previously, Panathinaikos had expressed their opposition to the demand of the Reds. After the announcement of the Greek referees who were going to officiate the forthcoming derby, Olympiacos announced that they would not participate in the game, and even a last minute meeting under the Greek Deputy Minister for Sports ended with a quarrelling between the people of the two clubs and with Panathinaikos' owner Giannakopoulos cursing Olympiacos' owners and chanting about the forthcoming relegation of his club's eternal enemy. Panathinaikos was awarded the away win for this game by 20–0, and Olympiacos was penalized with a 6-point deduction and a fine, whice were added to the previous deduction for the Cup game that Olympiacos had appealed. Totally, Olympiacos were deducted 12 points from their league total, plus one more point that was not awarded to them because of the forfeit in the league's derby. Later Olympiacos penalty was reduced to a 2-point deduction for the Cup game, which meant that the total deduction from the league table was 8 points. For the last matchday of the league's regular season, the central refereeing committee announced that Anastopoulos, one of the three referees of the much discussed Cup semifinal, was drawn to officiate Olympiacos' home game against Promitheas Patras, after Giannakopoulos pressure for the three referees to be included in the draw for the Reds game. That meant that if Olympiacos insisted on their position not to take part in a game officiated by Anastopoulos, Manos and Panagiotou, then the red giant would be relegated to the second division, a penalty for any team that forfeits two league games. Finally, Anastopoulos was replaced after his request not to officiate the game, which took place regularly, something that led Panathinaikos to protest with their withdrawal from their last regular season game against Kymi, which was awarded the win and escaped relegation, while the Greens were punished with a 6-point deduction. Meanwhile, Anastopoulos house was reportedly attacked by strangers, which were proved to be Olympiacos fans. In the final standings of the regular season, Panathinaikos with −6 points and Olympiacos with −8 points, and one more point not awarded to each one, were ranked in the 3rd and 6th place respectively despite having the two best records, which meant that they were to play against each other in the first playoffs round. However, Olympiacos proceeded to legal action, asking from the high council for the solution of athletic disputes to void the last matchday of the regular season, pointing out that all referees assignments were illegal, thus the playoffs were postponed for one week. The Hellenic Basketball Clubs Association decided to confirm the final standings, with Olympiacos talking about violation of the sporting legislation. Olympiacos announced that they would not compete in the playoffs against Panathinaikos, since not only were foreign referees not appointed, but also two of the Cup semifinal referees (Anastopoulos and Manos) were drawn to officiate the first playoffs derby. In the face of this possibility EuroLeague Basketball president, Jordi Bertomeu, accused the Hellenic Basketball Federation of not intervening to resolve the dispute between Olympiacos and Panathinaikos, describing the situation of the Greek basketball and the forthcoming relegation of Olympiacos as unthinkable. Olympiacos, finally, did not appear in the first playoffs game at Panathinaikos home arena, which meant that the Reds would get relegated to the second division for forfeiting two league games, while shameful incidents occurred once more in Panathinaikos court, where a chicken was laid out on Olympiacos bench. Later, the Hellenic Basketball Clubs Association officially announced the relegation of Olympiacos to the Greek A2 Basket League, due to the non-participation in a league playoffs game; Olympiacos were eliminated for the rest of the playoffs and were also placed at the bottom of the final standings, with all their results voided and non-replaceable. The club's former coach, Ioannis Sfairopoulos, stated that Olympiacos chose the extreme way to change a situation that existed for years, something they tried to do in various ways in the past but nothing worked, and that they have to change the status in Greek basketball. Panathinaikos' coach, Rick Pitino, stated that Greek basketball needs Olympiacos and asked from them to change their mind. Hellenic Basketball Federation's president, George Vassilakopoulos, after his long-lasting silence, stated: \\"It will be a disaster for basketball, for such a great club with a history like Olympiacos to play in the second division and a solution must be reached fast. I’m clear about this\\". Newly appointed Greek Deputy Minister for Sports, Lefteris Avgenakis, and Vassilakopoulos, both agreed that Olympiacos should be part of the Greek Basket League and that a solution should be found, while his predecessor, Giorgos Vasiliadis, also accused of his passive stance, revealed that he had requested FIBA to send foreign referees to the league games. However, no action was taken maybe due to Panathinaikos constant threats that they would witdraw from the league, if Olympiacos remained in the first division. In the meantime, Olympiacos appeals about the league last matchday's legality were rejected, and they decided to take the Hellenic Basketball Clubs Association to the sports court. Finally, Olympiacos announced that they decided to register an entirely separate squad for the 2019–20 Greek second division and 2019–20 Greek Cup, for reasons of legality, and that squad would be a secondary \\"B\\" team, with a different name (Olympiacos B Development Team) and using the Peace and Friendship Stadium's practice court as their home arena, with the senior team playing exclusively in EuroLeague, which \\"has all the elements that characterize a serious, modern and reliable league\\", according to their announcement. After losing the first EuroLeague game of the season against ASVEL, Olympiacos and David Blatt parted ways. His assistant Kęstutis Kemzūra became the head coach of the team until the end of the season. ==Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors== Since 1985, Olympiacos had a specific kit manufacturer and a shirt sponsor.

The arena opened in 1985, and Olympiacos has been using it since 1991. It was originally one of the biggest European indoor arenas, with an original capacity of 17,000 seats, however, its capacity was reduced to 12,171 seats for the 2004 Olympics. Currently, it can seat up to 14,950 with lower additional tiers of seats added to it. 12,000Έτοιμο το ΣΕΦ για τον τελικό Ολυμπιακός-Ραβένα(pics) .Στο ΣΕΦ με τη Ραβένα για την Κούπα! .Capacity (number of seats): 12000.

As European Champions, they played against the back-to-back NBA champions, the Chicago Bulls, in the final of the 1997 McDonald's Championship in Paris. The game was played under zone-friendly European rules (the games between NBA and FIBA teams were played under a mixture of NBA and FIBA rules at that time), but, out of respect for the Bulls, Olympiacos never used a zone defense.

It was released in November 1971 by CBS Records. Instead of boogie rock and catchy tunes, they relied on creating songs with a moody feel such as \\"Langebro\\", \\"Fra dag til dag\\" and \\"Tremastet beton\\". The latter is recited by the poet Mogens Mogensen. Lead singer Kim Larsen later jokingly referred to the song as the first Danish rap. The lyrics and the music have a dark and mysterious ambience. From this album \\"Langebro\\" was released on the single with \\"Lilli-Lilli\\" on the b-side. The album was produced by the band itself in Copenhagen and sound engineer, Freddy Hansson went to Trident Studios in London to mix it with Roy Thomas Baker. He would later become Gasolin's producer. The cover was an illustration made by Hergé (originally from The Seven Crystal Balls), who loved the fact that a rock band would use one of his drawings for an album cover. The album was released on CD in 1987 with Gasolin' 2 (1972) but due to lack of space \\"Tremastet beton\\" was omitted.

Wade was born in Shoreditch, London and joined Arsenal as an amateur in 1944. Wade was serving in the Royal Air Force during World War II; stationed at RAF Credenhill in Herefordshire, he guested a few times for Southern League side Hereford United during this period as well. Wade was a reserve full back and only played in a handful of matches during the 1940s; he made his debut in an FA Cup match against West Ham United on 5 January 1946; a mainly reserve Arsenal side were thrashed 6–0, which remains to this day Arsenal's worst FA Cup defeat in modern times. Wade continued to be a bit-part player; he made his league debut in a 4–2 win over Leeds United on 16 November 1946, but in all he only made sixteen appearances between 1946 and 1952; the likes of Walley Barnes and Laurie Scott keeping him out of the side. Arsenal won the old First Division in 1947-48 but he only made three league appearances all season. Barnes had badly injured his knee in the 1952 FA Cup Final, and Wade duly filled in for him for the whole of the 1952-53 season. Wade was a near ever-present and played 44 times as Arsenal won their seventh league title, pipping Preston North End on goal average; it would turn out to be their last trophy until 1970. However, the following season, 1953-54, Wade himself injured his knee in a floodlit friendly against Queens Park Rangers and after recovering, he struggled to take his place back off Len Wills and a now-recovered Barnes. He continued to flit in and out of the first team but spent all of the 1955-56 season in the reserve side, at the same time carrying out a role as coach of the Arsenal youth team. In spring 1956 he left Arsenal to return to non-league Hereford United as player-manager. He played 91 first- team matches for Arsenal in total, never scoring a goal. At Hereford, he started the club's long-running tradition for knocking League sides out of the FA Cup, including Aldershot in 1956-57 and Queens Park Rangers in 1957-58. Wade won the \\"Double\\" of Southern League Cup and Southern League North-West Division in 1958-59, before leaving in 1962 to concentrate on his sports shop business. Wade briefly returned as Hereford's caretaker manager after John Charles had quit in 1971, but apart from that he did not return to football management. He died in 2005, at the age of 84. ==Honours== *First Division: 1952-53 ==References== * * ==External links== * Category:1921 births Category:2005 deaths Category:English footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:Hereford United F.C. players Category:English football managers Category:Hereford United F.C. managers Category:Arsenal F.C. non-playing staff Category:English Football League players Category:English Football League representative players Category:Footballers from Shoreditch ","title":"Joe Wade (footballer)"},{"id":"6198048","text":"JOM is a technical journal devoted to exploring the many aspects of materials, science and engineering published monthly by The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS) (a member-based professional society).

In their application to daylighting, they are also often called tubular daylighting devices, sun pipes, sun scopes, or daylight pipes. Light pipes may be divided into two broad categories: hollow structures that contain the light with reflective surfaces, and transparent solids that contain the light by total internal reflection. The principles governing the flow of light through these devices are those of nonimaging optics. == Types == The Copper Box, venue for Handball at the 2012 Summer Olympics, makes use of light tubes to reduce energy use. ===IR light pipes/IR light tubes=== Manufacturing custom designed Infrared light pipes, hollow waveguides and homogenizers is non- trivial. This is because these are tubes lined with a highly polished infrared reflective coating of gold, which can be applied thick enough to permit these tubes to be used in highly corrosive atmospheres. Carbon black can be applied to certain parts of light pipes to absorb IR light (see photonics). This is done to limit IR light to only certain areas of the pipe. While most light pipes are produced with a round cross-section, light pipes are not limited to this geometry. Square and hexagonal cross-sections are used in special applications. Hexagonal pipes tend to produce the most homogenized type of IR Light. The pipes do not need to be straight. Bends in the pipe have little effect on efficiency. ===Light tube with reflective material=== subterranean train station at Potsdamer Platz, Berlin, seen from above ... ... and below ground. Also known as a \\"tubular skylight\\" or \\"tubular daylighting device\\", this is the oldest and most widespread type of light tube used for daylighting. The concept was originally developed by the ancient Egyptians. The first commercial reflector systems were patented and marketed in the 1850s by Paul Emile Chappuis in London, utilising various forms of angled mirror designs. Chappuis Ltd's reflectors were in continuous production until the factory was destroyed in 1943.Science & Society Picture Library Advertisement for Chappuis’ patent reflectors, c 1851–1870. The concept was rediscovered and patented in 1986 by Solatube International of Australia.Solatube International, history This system has been marketed for widespread residential and commercial use. Other daylighting products are on the market under various generic names, such as \\"SunScope\\", \\"solar pipe\\", \\"light pipe\\", \\"light tube\\" and \\"tubular skylight\\". A tube lined with highly reflective material leads the light rays through a building, starting from an entrance- point located on its roof or one of its outer walls. A light tube is not intended for imaging (in contrast to a periscope, for example), thus image distortions pose no problem and are in many ways encouraged due to the reduction of \\"directional\\" light. The entrance point usually comprises a dome (cupola), which has the function of collecting and reflecting as much sunlight as possible into the tube. Many units also have directional \\"collectors\\", \\"reflectors\\" or even Fresnel lens devices that assist in collecting additional directional light down the tube. In 1994, the Windows and Daylighting Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) developed a series of horizontal light pipe prototypes to increase daylight illuminance at distances of 4.6-9.1 m, to improve the uniformity of daylight distribution and luminance gradient across the room under variable sun and sky conditions throughout the year. The light pipes were designed to passively transport daylighting through relatively small inlet glazing areas by reflecting sunlight to depths greater than conventional sidelight windows or skylights.LBNL:The Design and Evaluation of Three Advanced Daylighting Systems: Light Shelves, Light Pipes and SkylightsLBNL:Advanced Optical Daylighting Systems: Light Shelves and Light Pipes A set-up in which a laser cut acrylic panel is arranged to redirect sunlight into a horizontally or vertically orientated mirrored pipe, combined with a light spreading system with a triangular arrangement of laser cut panels that spread the light into the room, was developed at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane.Ken Yeang:Light Pipes: An Innovative Design Device for Bringing Natural Daylight and Illumination into Buildings with Deep Floor Plan , Nomination for the Far East Economic Review Asian Innovation Awards 2003 In 2003, Veronica Garcia Hansen, Ken Yeang, and Ian Edmonds were awarded the Far East Economic Review Innovation Award in bronze for this development.Lighting up your workplace — Queensland student pipes light to your office cubicle , May 9, 2005Kenneth Yeang , World Cities Summit 2008, June 23–25, 2008, Singapore Light transmission efficiency is greatest if the tube is short and straight. In longer, angled, or flexible tubes, part of the light intensity is lost. To minimize losses, a high reflectivity of the tube lining is crucial; manufacturers claim reflectivities of their materials, in the visible range, of up to almost 99.5 percent. Tube de Lumière At the end point (the point of use), a diffuser spreads the light into the room. The first full-scale passive horizontal light pipes were built at the Daylight Lab of Texas A&M; University where the annual daylight performance was thoroughly evaluated in a 360 degree rotating 6 m wide by 10 m deep room. The pipe is coated with a 99.3% specular reflective film and the distribution element at the end of the light pipe consists of a 4.6 m long diffusing radial film with an 87% visible transmittance. The light pipe introduces consistently illuminance levels ranging between 300 lx to 2,500 lux throughout the year at distances between 7.6 m to 10 m.LO Beltran:Assessing the Lighting Performance of an Innovative Core Sunlighting System To further optimize the use of solar light, a heliostat can be installed which tracks the movement of the sun, thereby directing sunlight into the light tube at all times of the day as far as the surroundings´ limitations allow, possibly with additional mirrors or other reflective elements that influence the light path. The heliostat can be set to capture moonlight at night. === Optical fiber === Optical fibers can also be used for daylighting. A solar lighting system based on plastic optical fibers was in development at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2004.Article on Hybrid Solar Lighting \\"Let the Sun Shine in\\", Discover Magazine, Vol. 25, No. 07, July 2004 ORNL - Solar Technologies Program The system was installed at the American Museum of Science and Energy, Tennessee, USA, in 2005,HSL Featured in Popular Science's What's New Section June 2005, Page 28 and brought to market the same year by the company Sunlight Direct.Oak Ridge National Laboratory - New Oak Ridge company putting hybrid solar lighting on map Sunlight Direct- Architectural Design Information However, this system was taken off the market in 2009. In view of the usually small diameter of the fibers, an efficient daylighting set-up requires a parabolic collector to track the sun and concentrate its light. Optical fibers intended for light transport need to propagate as much light as possible within the core; in contrast, optical fibers intended for light distribution are designed to let part of the light leak through their cladding.Use Of Diffusive Optical Fibers For Plant Lighting Optical fibers are also used in the Bjork system sold by Parans Solar Lighting AB.Parans Bjork Parans Bjork system review by Inhabitat The optic fibers in this system are made of PMMA (PolyMethylMethAcrylate) and sheathed with Megolon, a halogen-free thermoplastic resin. A system such as this, however, is quite expensive.Typical system starting at $10,000 The Parans system consists of three parts. A collector, fiber optic cables and luminaires spreading the light indoors. One or more collectors is placed on or near the building on a place where they will have good access of direct sunlight. The collector consists of lenses mounted in aluminum profiles with a covering glass as protection. These lenses concentrates the sunlight down in the fiber optic cables. The collectors are modular which means they come with either 4,6,8,12 or 20 cables depending on the need. Every cable can have an individual length. The fibre optic cables transport the natural light 100 meters (30 floors) in and through the property while retaining both a high level of light quality and light intensity. Examples of implementations are Kastrup Airport, University of Arizona and Stockholm University. A similar system, but using optical fibers of glass, had earlier been under study in Japan.Hybrid Solar Lighting: Bringing a little sunshine into our lives , NBC News, March 2005 Corning Inc. makes Fibrance Light-Diffusing Fiber. Fibrance works by shining a laser through a light diffusing fiber optic cable.

In contrast to an optical fiber which has a solid core, a prism light guide leads the light through air and is therefore referred to as hollow light guide. The project ARTHELIO, partially funded by the European Commission, was an investigation in years 1998 to 2000 into a system for adaptive mixing of solar and artificial light, and which includes a sulfur lamp, a heliostat, and hollow light guides for light transport and distribution. Disney has experimented in using 3D printing to print internal light guides for illuminated toys. === Fluorescence based system === In a system developed by Fluorosolar and the University of Technology, Sydney, two fluorescent polymer layers in a flat panel capture short wave sunlight, particularly ultraviolet light, generating red and green light, respectively, which is guided into the interior of a building. There, the red and green light is mixed with artificial blue light to yield white light, without infrared or ultraviolet. This system, which collects light without requiring mobile parts such as a heliostat or a parabolic collector, is intended to transfer light to any place within a building. Fluorosolar FluoroSolar - Bringing the Sunshine Inside , Treehugger, February 5, 2006 (retrieved on January 13, 2007)Video on fluorescence based system By capturing ultraviolet the system can be especially effective on bright but overcast days; this since ultraviolet is diminished less by cloud cover than are the visible components of sunlight. == Properties and applications  Solar and hybrid lighting systems === A simple light tube, showing collection, transmission, and distribution Solar light pipes, compared to conventional skylights and other windows, offer better heat insulation properties and more flexibility for use in inner rooms, but less visual contact with the external environment. In the context of seasonal affective disorder, it may be worth consideration that an additional installation of light tubes increases the amount of natural daily light exposure. It could thus possibly contribute to residents´ or employees´ well-being while avoiding over-illumination effects. Compared to artificial lights, light tubes have the advantage of providing natural light and of saving energy. The transmitted light varies over the day; should this not be desired, light tubes can be combined with artificial light in a hybrid set- up.Night Lite Sunlight Direct- Lighting Design Information Some artificial light sources are marketed which have a spectrum similar to that of sunlight, at least in the human visible spectrum range,True-Lite as well as low flicker. Their spectrum can be made to vary dynamically such as to mimick the changes of natural light over the day. Manufacturers and vendors of such light sources claim that their products can provide the same or similar health effects as natural light. When considered as alternatives to solar light pipes, such products may have lower installation costs but do consume energy during use; therefore they may well be more wasteful in terms of overall energy resources and costs. On a more practical note, light tubes do not require electric installations or insulation, and are thus especially useful for indoor wet areas such as bathrooms and pools. From a more artistic point of view, recent developments, especially those pertaining to transparent light tubes, open new and interesting possibilities for architectural design. ===Settings=== Light tubes have been used in schools, warehouses, retail environments, homes, government buildings, museums, hotels and restaurants. === Security applications === Due to the relatively small size and high light output of sun pipes, they have an ideal application to security oriented situations, such as prisons, police cells and other locations where restricted access is required. Being of a narrow diameter, and not largely affected by internal security grilles, this provides daylight to areas without providing electrical connections or escape access, and without allowing objects to be passed into a secure area. ==In electronic devices== Molded plastic light tubes are commonly used in the electronics industry to direct illumination from LEDs on a circuit board to indicator symbols or buttons. These light tubes typically take on a highly complex shape that uses either gentle curving bends as in an optic fiber or have sharp prismatic folds which reflect off the angled corners. Multiple light tubes are often molded from a single piece of plastic, permitting easy device assembly since the long thin light tubes are all part of a single rigid component that snaps into place. Light tube indicators make electronics cheaper to manufacture since the old way would be to mount a tiny lamp into a small socket directly behind the spot to be illuminated. This often requires extensive hand-labor for installation and wiring. Light tubes permit all lights to be mounted on a single flat circuit board, but the illumination can be directed up and away from the board by several inches, wherever it is required. == See also == * Anidolic lighting * Architectural lighting design * Daylighting ** Active daylighting **Passive daylighting * Deck prism * Green building * Lighting * Liter of Light project * Over illumination * Passive house * Passive solar building design * Remote Skylights * Prism glass * Tubeless skylight * Solar power, esp. the sections on solar lighting and solar design in architecture * Zero-energy building == External links  Overview === * Corning Fibrance Light-Diffusing Fiber * Light Tubes on \\"Potsdamer Platz\\" are made by Heliobus AG Switzerland * Smart Lighting for a Smart House Study ( PowerPoint Presentation ) * Solar lighting and Illumination of Buildings using Light Pipes, Florida Solar Energy Center (at the University of Central Florida) * Daylighting Using Tubular Light Guide Systems (thesis) * an overview over light guidance – PDF, HTML * \\"A Study of Performance of Light Pipes Under Cloudy and Sunny Conditions in the UK\\" * \\"Sunlight in a tube\\", World Science, 2005 BROKEN LINK ! * Wayback Archive of ; \\"Sunlight in a tube\\", World Science, 2005 * A series of technical reference information pages from the UK, referring to installation and mounting information * \\"Use of prismatic films to control light distribution\\", K.

He is known for opposing the rise of Hindenburg as president of the Weimar Republic and for his classic on Jewish self-hatred (Der jüdische Selbsthaß), a book which he wrote in 1930, three years before Adolf Hitler came to power, in which he tried to explain the phenomenon of Jewish intellectuals who incited antisemitism against the Jewish people and who regarded Judaism as the source of evil in the world. Lessing's political ideals, as well as his Zionism made him a very controversial person during the rise of Nazi Germany. He fled to Czechoslovakia where he lived in Marienbad in the villa of a local social democratic politician. On the night of 30 August 1933, he was assassinated by Sudeten German Nazi sympathizers. Lessing was shot through a window of the villa where he lived. His assassins were German Nazis from Sudetenland, Rudolf Max Eckert, Rudolf Zischka and Karl Hönl. They fled to Nazi Germany after the assassination. Lessing's philosophical views were influenced by Nietzsche and Afrikan Spir. According to Theodore Ziolkowski in Lessing's Geschichte als Sinngebung des Sinnlosen (History as Giving Meaning to the Meaningless), \\"writing in the tradition of Nietzsche, argued that history, having no objective validity, amounts to a mythic construct imposed on an unknowable reality, in order to give its some semblance of meaning.\\"Theodore Ziolkowski, Virgil and the Moderns, p. 9. ==LifeEarly life=== Lessing was born into an upper-middle-class assimilated Jewish family. His father was a doctor in Hanover, his mother the daughter of a banker. He remembered his schooldays as unhappy; he was a mediocre student and graduated from Ratsgymnasium Hannover only with great difficulty. In his memoirs he wrote: \\"This humanistic German gymnasium specialising in patriotism, Latin, and Greek... this institute for the furtherance of stupidification, half of it built on white-collar boundering, the other half on mendacious, platitudinous German nationalism, was not just incredibly irresponsible, it was utterly boring... Nothing, nothing could ever make up for what those fifteen years destroyed in me. Even now, almost every night I dream of the tortures of my schooldays.\\" At the time he was friendly with Ludwig Klages, but this friendship came to an end in 1899 (although whether anti-Semitism was a factor is unclear). Each later maintained that his own adult views had been determined by this shared background. After his graduation he began studying medicine in Freiburg im Breisgau, Bonn, and finally Munich, where, in greater conformity with his real interests, he turned to literature, philosophy, and psychology. He concluded his study of philosophy with a dissertation on the work of the Russian logician Afrikan Spir. His plans of habilitation at the University of Dresden were abandoned in the face of continuing public outrage over the influence in academia of Jews, socialists, and feminists. The next few years he spent as a substitute teacher and lecturer. In 1906 he travelled to Göttingen in order to obtain a habilitation under Edmund Husserl. This plan also came to nothing, but resulted briefly in a position as theatre critic for the Göttinger Zeitung; his critical notes were later collected in book form as Nachtkritiken. ===Growing renown=== In 1907 he returned to Hanover, where he lectured on philosophy at the Technische Hochschule, founding the first German anti-noise (noise abatement) society. In January 1910 he created a literary scandal with a vicious attack on the critic Samuel Lublinski and his Bilanz der Moderne (1904), in a piece published in Die Schaubühne filled with \\"Jewish jokes\\" and gibes about Lublinski's appearance; it drew strong condemnation from Thomas Mann, who returned the insults by calling Lessing a \\"disgraceful dwarf who should consider himself lucky that the sun shines on him, too.\\" On the outbreak of World War I Lessing volunteered for medical service. At this time he wrote his famous essay Geschichte als Sinngebung des Sinnlosen (\\"History as Making Sense of the Senseless\\"). Its publication was delayed by the censor until 1919 on account of its uncompromising anti-war position. After the war he returned to lecturing in Hanover and established the Volkshochschule Hannover-Linden with the help of his second wife, Ada Lessing. ===Fame and anti-nationalist polemics=== From 1923 he was highly active in public life, publishing articles and essays in Prager Tagblatt and Dortmunder Generalanzeiger, and quickly became one of the best-known political writers of Weimar Germany. In 1925 he drew attention to the fact that the serial killer Fritz Haarmann had been a spy for the Hanover police, and this resulted in him being excluded from covering the trial. In the same year he wrote an unflattering piece on Paul von Hindenburg, describing him as an intellectually vacuous man who was being used as a front by sinister political forces: :It was Plato's view that the leaders of men should be philosophers. No philosopher ascends the throne in Hindenburg. Only a representative symbol, a question mark, a zero. One might say \\"Better a zero than a Nero.\\" Sadly, history shows that behind every zero lurks a future Nero. This article earned him the enmity of nationalists, and his lectures were soon disrupted by anti- Semitic protestors. Lessing received only limited support from the public, and even his colleagues argued that he had gone too far. A six-month leave of absence failed to calm the situation. On 7 June nearly a thousand students threatened to move their studies to the Technische Universität Braunschweig unless he was removed, and on 18 June 1926 the Prussian minister Carl Heinrich Becker bowed to public pressure by putting Lessing on indefinite leave on a reduced salary. ===Escape from the Nazis and assassination=== Grave of Lessing in Marienbad (Mariánské Lázně) On 30 January 1933 the Nazi Party entered government and in February, after the suppression of the Freie Wort congress, Lessing started packing his bags. On 1 March he and his wife fled to Marienbad in Czechoslovakia, where he continued to write for German-language newspapers abroad. But in June it was reported in Sudeten newspapers that a reward had been announced for his capture. On 30 August 1933 he was working in his study when he was shot through the window by assassins. He died the next day at the hospital in Marienbad. == Literary works / editions == * African Spirs Erkenntnislehre, Gießen, Münchow, 1900.

The episode was written by George Pelecanos from a story by David Simon & Ed Burns and was directed by Clement Virgo. It originally aired on September 1, 2002. ==Plot summary== Stringer collects the pagers belonging to D'Angelo's crew and tells them that all business talk will be conducted face to face. Stringer and Avon meet with Levy, who tells them that they need to walk away from Orlando's club. Levy also suggests that Nakeesha Lyles, a female security guard who had planned to testify against D'Angelo, may be a problem. After Levy departs, Stringer convinces Avon to insulate himself from their crew by passing all communication through him. D'Angelo tells Stringer that Wallace has left \\"the game,\\" and appeals to Avon to leave him alone. Back at the pit, Wallace returns and asks for his old position back. Bodie tells Wallace that he would have to accept a demotion, but D'Angelo overrules him. D'Angelo's mother Brianna arrives with a lunch for him. Daniels visits Greggs and bumps into a drunken McNulty outside of her room. He tells McNulty to either see Greggs or go back to work. McNulty confesses that he is wracked with guilt over his role in starting the detail, saying that the case does not mean anything. Daniels tells him that the case meant something to Greggs and that they must continue their work and find her shooters. McNulty returns to the detail office as Freamon fits Shardene with contact lenses. Freamon tells McNulty that their surveillance is faltering because the Barksdale Organization is changing its operating procedure. He has sent Prez to Annapolis to chase the paper trail in campaign contributions. Freamon suggests that they have Shardene wear a wire in Avon's club. Daniels meets with Burrell and Reed to discuss his investigation. Burrell feels that the case is over now that the wiretaps have gone dead. Daniels argues that they should keep up the surveillance as they still have time remaining on the court order. Burrell orders Daniels to return Santangelo and Sydnor to Homicide, but allows him to keep Freamon and Prez. Burrell still assumes Freamon and Prez are the most useless detectives on his detail, unaware that they have revealed themselves to Daniels as valuable investigators. Pearlman meets with the State's Attorney, who is worried about the political angle in the Barksdale investigation. He gives Pearlman evidence of returned contributions from unknown sources from his own offices to hand over to the detail. Pearlman is distressed that the investigation is worrying her superiors, as this reflects poorly on her, and she denies any knowledge of the detail's actions. Shardene attempts to infiltrate the office at Orlando's while wearing a wire, but has little success in obtaining pertinent information. Later that night, beat officers find Nakeesha's body. Bunk reports the murder to the Barksdale detail and they realize that Wallace may be in danger. Daniels scrambles to organize his men to locate him while Freamon offers to let Shardene stay at his apartment. Daniels is called into a meeting with Burrell and Senator Davis, who is concerned about the detail looking into his campaign finances and his driver. Daniels refuses to apologize for the driver's arrest and tells Davis that if he is clean, he has nothing to worry about. After Daniels leaves the meeting, Davis insists that Burrell needs to control him. Daniels returns to the office and learns that Wallace has left his grandmother's house. Freamon trains Shardene in measuring her steps to map the inside of the club. Using Prez's math skills, the detail installs a camera in Avon's office from an adjacent building. Stringer orders Bodie to kill Wallace, and Poot unsuccessfully tries to dissuade him from doing so. McNulty and Daniels visit Wallace's old squat, but find it abandoned. McNulty finds an address for Wallace's mother, Darcia, and he takes Daniels there to see if she knows his whereabouts. She is little help and is more concerned about her next drink than her son being in danger. After bringing Chinese takeout to the young children whom he looks after, Wallace goes out for a meal with Bodie and Poot. When they return home, the children have all left. Bodie and Poot corner Wallace in his bedroom and Bodie draws his weapon. He steels himself to shoot Wallace as he pleads for his life, but is unable to do so until prompted by Poot. After the first shot, Poot takes the weapon and finishes the task. Bunk investigates Wallace's murder the next day while Avon clears his office at Orlando's, frustrating the detail. Avon asks D'Angelo to drive to New York to receive their next package. With this information, Daniels and McNulty borrow a tracking device from the FBI and install it on D'Angelo's car. D'Angelo is stopped by the New Jersey State Police and brought in by the detail, after which McNulty and Daniels interrogate him without a lawyer. D'Angelo refuses to believe McNulty when he says that Wallace is dead. However, he is enraged when Stringer doesn't answer his questions about Wallace, accepting McNulty's story and refusing to let Levy represent him. Meanwhile, Burrell pressures Daniels to close the case and ignore the political leads, threatening to release the FBI's report on his excess capital. Daniels counters by stating that he is willing to go down for the sake of the Barksdale case, noting that the bad publicity is what Burrell is most afraid of. McNulty and Daniels watch a SWAT team prepare to arrest Avon. McNulty tells Daniels that they should make the arrest themselves, and they go in together. Daniels cuffs Avon but McNulty lets Stringer go, telling him that they will catch him later. At the office, Freamon, Prez, and Sydnor review the board. Freamon adds a newspaper article about a downtown business revitalization project being built in an area where the Barksdales have been amassing property. Sydnor tells them that the case is the best work that he has ever done, but he still feels that it is not finished. At the pit, the dealers' orange sofa stands unused. ==ProductionTitle reference=== The title refers to the cleaning up of loose ends performed by the Barksdale crew, as recommended by their lawyer Maurice Levy as well as that of the police forced to bring in the case in the wake of the effects of \\"The Hunt\\" that interfered with their case due to the resulting changes made by the Barksdale organization. ===Epigraph=== The epigraph is spoken by Wallace as he discusses his return to \\"the pit\\" with D'Angelo, explaining why he can not stay in the countryside, and why he can't move to another part of Baltimore. This is because everything that he is has been molded into his part of the drug dealing institution of \\"the pit\\", meaning that he is stuck in the life the institution forced him into. ===Music=== The song playing during the conversation between Bodie and Stringer Bell is \\"Hip Hop\\", from the album Black on Both Sides by Mos Def. ===Credits=== Starring cast Although credited, John Doman, Andre Royo, and Sonja Sohn do not appear in this episode.

I get the shivers just thinking about it.\\" Alan Sepinwall wrote in The Star-Ledger in 2008 that the episode is considered by many \\"fans to be the series' best -- and most painful -- episode ever.\\" Sepinwall wrote that Wallace's death was the first of the show's \\"many great tragedies...and still the one that probably cuts deepest.\\" ==References *\\"Cleaning Up\\" at HBO.com * * Category:The Wire (season 1) episodes Category:2002 American television episodes ","title":"Cleaning Up (The Wire)"},{"id":"6198062","text":"José Caballero (11 June 1915 - 26 May 1991)Find a Grave entry was a Spanish painter. He was one of the most varied artists (in technique, style and theme). His way of understanding painting during the surrounding the civil war showed little similarities during the period. ==Career== At the end of the 1920s he met poet Adriano del Valle and in 1930, Daniel Vázquez Díaz, when he was painting frescoes in La Rábida monastery. He arrived in Madrid in 1931, but maintained his hometown ties, where that year he held his first individual exhibition in the Mercantile Circle. In 1932, along with Federico García Lorca and others, he produced an exhibition of scandalous drawings in the Popular Ateneo that lasted for only one day. In 1933 Lorca invited him to La Barraca, where he created sets of drawings. He met Alberto Sánchez, Pablo Neruda, Rafael Alberti, Miguel Hernández, Maruja Mallo, Joaquín Torres García and Luis Buñuel. The latter introduced him to surrealism, showing him, for example, the collages of Max Ernst. In 1935 Caballeros created three surrealist posters for his performance together with del Valle in the Ateneo of Sevilla and illustrated poems for Lorca and Neruda. He contributed to magazines such as Cruz y Raya, Noreste, Línea, Caballo Verde para la poesía, (Green Horse for Poetry) etc. Less known was his participation in the first Drawing Fair (1935) of the Iberian Artist Society. In 1937 he spent months at the battlefront producing drawings and maps. After the war he made surrealist illustrations filled with contents related to Catholicism in magazines such as Vértice or Santo y Seña convinced by Dionisio Ridruejo. In 1945 he participated in the III Salón de los Once (Eleven's Hall). Five years later, he was invited to the XXV edition of the Biennale Exhibition of Venice and held his first major individual exhibition in Madrid, in the Clan gallery. However, neither of these tendencies continued, especially in the fifties, when he left the figurative arts and tried to unite geometric abstraction with the matter-like expressivity of informalism. The results varied but always represented his creative interests, who remained influential in the artistic environment of Madrid until his death. He received Spain's National Award for Plastic Arts in 1984.

Sample Jr. (June 15, 1937 – April 26, 2005) was an American football defensive back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Baltimore Colts (1958–1960), Pittsburgh Steelers (1961–1962), and Washington Redskins (1963–1965), and in the American Football League (AFL) for the New York Jets (1966–1968), winning three league championships. Sample had the distinction of beginning and ending his career with championship wins in two of the most famous games in professional football history, and winning an NFL championship, an AFL championship, and a world championship. In his rookie season, he won an NFL championship ring with the Colts in their victory over the New York Giants in the 1958 NFL Championship Game, which became known as \\"The Greatest Game Ever Played\\". In his final season, he helped the Jets win the AFL Championship against the Oakland Raiders, and then to defeat the Colts in the third AFL-NFL World Championship (Super Bowl III) in January 1969, recording an interception in the Jets' 16–7 win. He is the only professional football player to have won all three: an NFL, AFL, and Super Bowl championship. In between, Sample won another championship in the 1959 NFL Championship Game, scoring a touchdown on a 42-yard interception return in the Colts' 31-16 victory over the Giants. ==Early life== Sample grew up in Cape Charles, Virginia, the son of John B. Sample, a barber, and Evlyn Sample, a stenographer. He went to Northampton County High School. He attended Maryland State College, now the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, where he was a four-sport athlete in football, baseball, basketball and gymnastics. In football, he was named a Little All-American and in three seasons led the Hawks to a record of 28-1-1 and two league championships. In three years as a halfback and kicker, he totaled 2,381 rushing yards, 37 touchdowns, 42 conversions, and four field goals. He graduated in 1958 with a degree in physical education. Sample in 1958 was said to be the first player from a historically black university to participate in the College All-Star Game, an annual exhibition held between professional rookies and the reigning NFL champion. ==Professional career== Sample finished his 11 professional football seasons with 41 interceptions, which he returned for 460 yards and four touchdowns. He also recovered 13 fumbles, returning them for 61 yards. On special teams, he returned 68 punts for 559 yards and a touchdown, along with 60 kickoffs for 1,560 yards and a touchdown. His most outstanding year was 1961 for the Steelers, when he intercepted a career-high eight passes for 141 return yards and one touchdown and led the NFL in punt return yards. ==After football== After his playing career ended, in 1970 Sample released a very outspoken autobiography, Confessions of a Dirty Ballplayer. He later became known in tennis -- he was the No. 1-ranked men's player by the United States Tennis Association (USTA) in the age 45 and over category for several years. During the 1980s and 1990s, he became a tennis official, a linesman, and even a chair umpire at bigger and bigger men's and women's events including the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the French Open, and the Australian Open. In 1977, he was inducted into the University of Maryland Eastern Shore Hawk Hall of Fame. He also hosted a talk-radio show in Philadelphia. Sample died April 26, 2005 at Misericordia Hospital in Philadelphia. He was survived by a son and two daughters.

Its products and services are employed by tens of thousands of users from Global 500 companies, universities, supercomputing sites and numerous independent software vendors. As a not-for-profit organization, NAG reinvests its surpluses into the research and development of its products and services, and the fostering of new numerical and scientific talent. NAG serves its customers from offices in Oxford, Manchester, Chicago, and Tokyo, through staff in France and Germany, and via a global network of distributors. ==Origins== NAG was founded by Brian Ford, Joan E. Walsh, and others in 1970 as the Nottingham Algorithms Group, a collaborative venture between the universities of Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham and Oxford, and the Atlas Computer Laboratory (now part of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory). The original aim of the project was the development of a library of numerical and statistical subroutines for the ICL 1906A and 1906S machines which were in use at each of these sites. Code and algorithms for the library were contributed to the project by experts in the project, and elsewhere (for example, some of the linear algebra code was written by Jim Wilkinson, who was an early supporter of the NAG project). The project attracted the attention of universities with other types of computers and the second release of the library was implemented on new platforms. The project moved from Nottingham to Oxford University in 1973, when its name was changed to The Numerical Algorithms Group. NAG Ltd was founded as a not-for-profit company in 1976, with Joan E. Walsh as chair, and celebrated the fortieth anniversary of the NAG project in 2010. ==Software ProductsThe NAG Library=== The NAG Library is the oldest and best-known product of NAG. Originally produced in 1971, the current version contains more than 1,700 routines and is used by developers to add mathematical and statistical functionality to their applications, or to solve complicated mathematical problems. The Library includes routines for: * Local and global optimization of multivariate functions * Solution of dense, banded and sparse linear equations; eigenvalue problems * Curve & surface fitting; interpolation * Solution of ordinary and partial differential equations; mesh generation * Numerical integration; integral equations * Solution of linear and nonlinear least squares problems * Finding the roots of nonlinear equations (including polynomials) * Random number generation * Time series analysis * Correlation and regression methods * Multivariate methods The original version of the NAG Library was written in Fortran and Algol 60; the Fortran implementation NAG Fortran Library is still available today, along with the NAG Library for C NAG C Library, NAG Library for .NET.NAG Library for .NET and the NAG Library for Python. The Library is accessible from several computing environments, including standard languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Visual Basic, Java, F# and C#, as well as packages such as MATLAB, R, LabVIEW and Excel. Two further versions of the NAG Library are aimed at multiprocessor machines: the NAG Library for SMP & multicore, NAG Library for SMP & multicore which takes advantage of the shared memory parallelism of Symmetric Multi-Processors (SMP) and multicore processors, and the NAG Parallel Library,NAG Parallel Library which is designed for distributed memory parallel computers. ===NAG Fortran Compiler=== The NAG Fortran Compiler is available available on Linux, Mac and Microsoft Windows. Based on the world's first Fortran 90 compiler (which was developed by NAG), it supports the full Fortran 2003 language, almost all of Fortran 2008, as well as many Fortran 2018 features. ==Numerical Services and HPC Services & Consulting== NAG provide numerical services in the areas of Mathematical Optimisation and Algorithmic DifferentiationAlgorithmic Differentiation Solutions and are global specialists in high performance computing consulting and services.High Performance Computing Consulting & Services ==Management== The current Chief Executive Officer of NAG is Adrian Tate. ==References *NAG website *NAG blog Category:1970 establishments in England Category:British companies established in 1970 Category:College and university associations and consortia in the United Kingdom Category:Computer companies of the United Kingdom Category:Fortran compilers Category:Companies associated with the University of Oxford Category:History of computing in the United Kingdom Category:Science and technology in Nottinghamshire Category:Software companies of the United Kingdom Category:University of Nottingham ","title":"Numerical Algorithms Group"},{"id":"6198117","text":"Colin Ronald Talbot (born 1952) is a British political scientist.

Here, after some it enters the Atlantic Ocean. It has a river basin of . The Commewijne was important historically for navigation: oceangoing ships navigated the river huge barges with bauxite were transported from Moengo in the east to the confluence with the Surinam river and from there traveled southward via Paramaribo to the Paranam refinery and to Trinidad and the USA. Floats with tropical hardwood were also brought to Paramaribo, the capital of Suriname. Nowadays, the Moengo bauxite is depleted and the hardwood is mostly transported by trucks. The oceangoing ships were trading the river as late as 1986. There remains quite some boat trafficking with local residents and tourists. The Commewijne River was known in the 16th and 17th centuries as \\"Camaiwini\\" and \\"Cammawini\\".

Originally a small beachside community, Ruakākā has seen development due to its proximity to the expansion of the country's only oil refinery at Marsden Point during the 1980s. A recently established timber processing plant at Marsden Point has further stimulated growth. ==GeographyNaming=== The name is a combination of the two words and ; being a Māori word for \\"nest\\" or \\"two\\", and being the name of a native parrot (Nestor meridionalis). Ruakākā was usually spelled as \\"Ruakaka\\" without macrons until the official name was changed in 2019. ===Districts=== The general area is made up of Ruakākā Beach, Ruakākā Township and Marsden Point. Other Bream Bay localities such as One Tree Point, Takahiwai and even Waipu are often included in general conversation regarding the area. Ruakaka Beach, October 2005. Ruakākā Beach lies near the mouth of the Ruakākā River which boasts a rare bird reserve and popular holiday parks. It is primarily a residential area made up of a mixture of permanent homes and beach shacks. The Ruakākā Township was developed off the back of the Marsden Point Oil Refinery expansion in the 1980s where services were required to support the large influx of workers from all over the world involved in the project. A government requirement for a percentage of revenue invested in the project to be spent on the local community allowed for provision of services not common in communities this size (e.g. squash courts, sports grounds). The Marsden Power Station Village was built to support the Marsden Power Stations (A & B) which have since been decommissioned. The area is now promoted as beachside living. ===Beaches=== The bay has beautiful sandy white beaches looking out towards Bream Head, the Hen and Chicken Islands, Mount Manaia and Sail Rock. ==Demographics== The statistical area of Ruakaka, which includes Marsden Village to the north, had a population of 2,586 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 579 people (28.8%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 669 people (34.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 960 households. There were 1,281 males and 1,302 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.98 males per female. Of the total population, 525 people (20.3%) were aged up to 15 years, 420 (16.2%) were 15 to 29, 1,101 (42.6%) were 30 to 64, and 543 (21.0%) were 65 or older. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding. Ethnicities were 77.7% European/Pākehā, 33.9% Māori, 4.8% Pacific peoples, 3.6% Asian, and 0.8% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 15.2, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 54.4% had no religion, 32.1% were Christian, and 5.8% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 267 (13.0%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 498 (24.2%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $26,000. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 870 (42.2%) people were employed full-time, 291 (14.1%) were part-time, and 87 (4.2%) were unemployed. ==Climate== The region's geographical location results in warm humid summers and mild winters. Typical summer temperatures range from 22 °C to 26 °C (72 °F to 79 °F), some of the warmest in the country. Ground frosts are virtually unknown. The hottest months are January and February. Typical annual rainfall for the region is 1500 – 2000 mm. Winds year-round are predominantly from the southwest. Ruakākā has a warm version of the oceanic climate closely bordering on humid subtropical, a typical feature of Northland's climate. ==History== The area of Ruakākā is located in Bream Bay which was named by Captain Cook during his first voyage to New Zealand when he visited the region on 25 November 1769. It was named due to the ease of capture of 90–100 bream fish soon after anchoring. ==Education== Bream Bay College is a secondary (years 7–13) school with a roll of 457. Ruakākā School is a contributing primary (years 1–6) school. It has a roll of 127. Both schools are coeducational and have a decile rating of 4. Ruakākā School opened in 1898 in North Ruakākā. Until 1916 it was a half-time school sharing a teacher with Mata School. The school moved to its present site in 1912. Bream Bay College started in 1972 as a Forms 3–7 (years 9–13) school on the site of Waipu District High School. It moved to Ruakākā in February 1974 and expanded to include Forms 1 and 2 (years 7–8). ==Attractions and landmarks== The following is a list of tourist attractions and landmarks in the Ruakākā Local Area. * Ruakaka Race Course * New Zealand Oil Refinery Visitors Centre == Railway proposal == A branch line railway to Marsden Point from Oakleigh on the North Auckland Line has recently been proposed.

There were many such viae regiae associated with the king in the medieval Holy Roman Empire. == History Origins=== The Via Regia ran west–east through the centre of the Holy Roman Empire, from the Rhine at Mainz-Kastel (Elisabethenstraße) to Frankfurt am Main, trade city and site of the election of the King of the Romans, continuing along Hanau, the Kaiserpfalz at Gelnhausen, the towns of Steinau an der Straße, Neuhof, Fulda and Eisenach to Erfurt, a centre of woad production. It ran further eastwards to Eckartsberga, crossing the Saale river between Bad Kösen and Naumburg and reached Leipzig, another trade city. The eastern part continued through Upper Lusatia (Via Regia Lusatiae Superioris) along Großenhain, Königsbrück, Kamenz, Bautzen and Görlitz to Wrocław in Silesia with further connection to Kraków in Poland. ===Medieval times=== The road was first mentioned as strata regia in a document issued by Margrave Henry III of Meissen in 1252, while its origins date back to the 8th and 9th centuries. After the downfall of the Imperial power in Central Germany in favour of the Saxon House of Wettin following the 1307 Battle of Lucka, the road lost its royal status and from the 14th century this route could no longer really be spoken of as a \\"Via Regia\\". Elisabethenstraße at Mainz-Kastel Nevertheless, the important section of the road between Frankfurt and Leipzig continued to exist under the name Hohe Straße (\\"High Road\\"). It remained under sovereign control of e.g. the Bohemian Crown in Upper Lusatia, the Saxon electors, the Abbey of Fulda, as well as the Archbishopric of Mainz and was chartered through tolling. Also the branch-off from Frankfurt am Main to Cologne via Wetzlar was called Hohe Straße. The road had a large economic significance for interregional trade and bartering. From the west came Flemish blankets, from the east wood, pelts, wax and honey, and the middle section controlled the German indigo (Isatis tinctoria) of the Thuringian Basin as well as the mining products of the Saxon Ore Mountains. The High Road also provided the direct route between the largest German trade fairs of Frankfurt and Leipzig. Pilgrims, who took part in the Aachen Cathedral shrine pilgrimage used the road in large numbers. Thereto they turned off the trunk road at Eisenach along the \\"Long Hesse\\" road to Marburg and Cologne. Testimonies of the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela are known from Großenhain, Leipzig, Erfurt, Gotha, Vacha, Fulda, Frankfurt am Main and Mainz. The road was repeatedly used by armies. Some large battles came to pass in its catchment area (e.g. Breitenfeld 1631, Lützen 1632, Rossbach 1757, Hochkirch 1758, Jena- Auerstedt 1806 as well as the Battles of Bautzen, Lützen (Großgörschen) and Leipzig in 1813). ===19th century to present day=== After the final defeat of Napoleon, the significance of the road declined, since, as a result of the reduction of the Kingdom of Saxony by large parts of its Lusatian territories at the Congress of Vienna, the toll on behalf of Leipzig was no longer continued. Parts of the historic Via Regia route are today marked by major national roads: between Eisenach and Erfurt by the Bundesstraße 7 (B7); between Eckartsberga and Leipzig by the B87; and between Leipzig and Görlitz by the Bundesstraße 6 (B6) and eastwards to Kraków by the Polish national road 94. In Hanau the Birkenhainer Strasse branches off the Via Regia crossing the Spessart mountain range towards Gemünden am Main in Franconia, also as a high road. ==Tourism== The Council of Europe awarded the Via Regia the title of Major Cultural Route of the \\"Council of Europe” in 2005. According to the Council of Europe, it \\"is the name of the oldest and longest road link between the East and the West of Europe. The route has existed for more than 2.000 years and connects 8 European countries through a length of 4.500 km.\\" == Literature == * Ludwig Steinfeld: Chronik einer Straße.

He has held various positions of leadership and has been instrumental in many developments in the community.\\"The Buddhist vision: a path to fulfilment\\" - Google Books \\"The Buddhist handbook\\" - Internet Archive Subhuti was influential in the building of the London Buddhist Centre, which opened in 1978, and he helped to raise funds from the Greater London Council for its completion. He developed training for men preparing to be ordained into the Triratna Buddhist Order at Padmaloka retreat centre, near Norwich in England. He also helped to found Guhyaloka, a retreat centre in Spain, where men make final preparations to become members of the order. As well as being involved in the spread of the Dharma in the West, particularly in Britain, Subhuti spends six months each year working with the community's Indian wing, the Triratna Bauddha Mahāsaṅgha (TBM).TBMSG Website Most of TBM's members are drawn from the poorest people in India, sometimes referred to as Dalits, or so-called 'untouchables'. The late Dalit leader, Dr. Ambedkar, converted to Buddhism, saying it was necessary to escape the caste oppression and discrimination which this group experienced. Hundreds of thousands of Dr Ambedkar's followers subsequently converted to Buddhism. Following the turn of the millennium Subhuti raised concerns over the circumstances of some of Sangharakshita's past sexual relationships, and around the same time his chairmanship of Triratna's Preceptors College was handed on to Dharmachari Dhammarati. In recent years Subhuti and Sangharakshita have been collaborating closely to produce a series of new articles clarifying and reemphasizing Triratna's core approach and principles. ==Published works== Subhuti's books include Sangharakshita: A New Voice in the Buddhist Tradition,\\"Sangharakshita: A New Voice in the Buddhist Tradition\\" - FWBO\\"A reader in new religious movements\\" - Google Books which explores what Sangharakshita has contributed to the practice of Buddhism and the spread of Buddhism in the West.

He goes on to claim that while \\"some, of course, are predisposed to this attraction, others have deliberately chosen to change their sexual preferences in order to use sex as a medium of kalyana mitrata (spiritual friendship).\\" Kennedy also suggests that \\"male-female relationships … are probably not particularly spiritually productive\\" and he speaks \\"of the dangers of male-female relationships\\". Those who cannot follow such ideas he suggests to be blocked by \\"taboo\\" or a \\"reluctance to give up a conditioned predisposition.\\"Alex Kennedy, Shabda Sept. 1986, p. 129, http://www.ex-cult.org/fwbo/SubQuote.htm ==References * Subhuti's own website * \\"The awakening of the west\\" - Google Books * \\"The Middle way, Volumes 61-62\\" - Google Books * \\"Revival of Buddhism is not hostile to Hinduism: Kalon Tripa\\" - Phayul * \\"Buddhism for today : a portrait of a new Buddhist movement\\" - National Library of Australia * \\"An old net for new monsters\\" - National Library of Australia * adhisthana- kula/women-men-and- angels-personal-statement- subhuti * adhisthana- kula/maitreyi- interviews-subhuti-women-men- and-angels Category:English Buddhists Category:Buddhist writers Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Friends of the Western Buddhist Order ","title":"Dharmachari Subhuti"},{"id":"6198177","text":"A solar tube may refer to: *Evacuated tube collector - a type of high efficiency solar thermal collector *Light tube ","title":"Solar tube"},{"id":"6198185","text":"Lodgepole can refer to: ;Towns or cities * Lodgepole, Alberta, a hamlet in Canada * Lodge Pole, Montana, census-designated place in the United States * Lodgepole, Nebraska, a village in the United States * Lodgepole, South Dakota, an unincorporated community in the United States ;Species * Lodgepole chipmunk, a species of rodent * Lodgepole pine a species of tree ;Creeks or lakes * Lodgepole Creek, a creek within Colorado, Nebraska and Wyoming in the United States * Lodgepole Lake, a lake in Idaho, United States ;Other * Lodgepole (sculpture), a sculpture by Lyman Kipp * Lodgepole Community Hall, a National Registered Historic Place ","title":"Lodgepole"},{"id":"6198187","text":"Bruno Granichstaedten signature Bruno Bernhard Granichstaedten (September 1, 1879, Vienna – May 30, 1944, New York City) was an Austrian composer and librettist.

O'Sullivan joined the team during the 2004 National League and immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen. Since then he has won two Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. O'Sullivan has ended up as an All-Ireland runner-up on one occasion. AT club level O'Sullivan is a three-time county championship medalist with Ballygunner. ==Playing careerClub=== O'Sullivan plays his club hurling with the Ballygunner club in Waterford and has enjoyed much success. He made his senior debut as a sixteen-year-old in 2002 as Ballygunner started a remarkable losing streak of being defeated in three successive club championship finals. They broke this unenviable record at the fourth attempt with O'Sullivan winning his first championship medal following a 2-10 to 1-12 defeat of De La Salle. Ballygunner lost two further finals in succession before O'Sullivan won his second championship medal in 2009 following a one- point defeat of Lismore after a draw and a replay. After surrendering their title in 2010, Ballygunner reached the championship decider again in 2011. O'Sullivan was captain as the club recorded a facile 1-19 to 0-6 defeat of Tallow. ===Inter-county=== O'Sullivan began his inter-county career as a member of the Waterford minor and under-21 hurling teams, however, he had little success in these grades. He made his senior competitive debut in the National League in 2004, before making his championship debut later that season in a Munster semi-final against Tipperary. O'Sullivan later won his first Munster medal as Waterford defeated Cork by 3-16 to 1-21 to win one of the greatest games of hurling ever played. After returning from a serious injury that kept him out of the game for six months, O'Sullivan added a National Hurling League medal to his collection in 2007 when Waterford defeated Kilkenny by 0-20 to 0-18 in the final. 2008 began poorly for Waterford as the team lost their opening game to Clare as well as their manager Justin McCarthy. In spite of this poor start O'Sullivan's side reached the All-Ireland final for the first time in forty-five years. Kilkenny provided the opposition and went on to trounce Waterford by 3-30 to 1-13 to claim a third All-Ireland title in-a-row. O'Sullivan lined out in another Munster final in 2010 with Cork providing the opposition. A 2-15 apiece draw was the result on that occasion, however, Waterford went on to win the replay after an extra-time goal by Dan Shanahan. It was a second Munster winners' medal for O'Sullivan. ===Inter-provincial=== O'Sullivan has also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial series of games. ==References== Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Ballygunner hurlers Category:Waterford inter-county hurlers Category:Munster inter-provincial hurlers ","title":"Shane O'Sullivan"},{"id":"6198192","text":"The Govt Senior Model School, Civil Lines Patiala was founded in 1956 along with its sister institution Senior Model School, Pheel Khana, Patiala as part of a 'Model School' program of Government of Punjab.

Shell has operated in Australia since 1901, initially delivering bulk fuel into Australia, then establishing storage and distribution terminals, oil refineries, and a network of service stations. It extended its Australian activities to oil exploration, petrochemicals and coal mining, and became a leading partner in Australia's largest resource development project, the North West Shelf Venture. In August 2014, Shell sold its downstream business in Australia, including its Geelong refinery and 870 retail sites, along with its bulk fuels, bitumen, chemicals and part of its lubricants businesses, to the Dutch firm Vitol, for A$2.9 billion. Aside from its aviation fuel business which was retained, Shell's remaining Australian activities are in upstream businesses, comprising exploration, liquified natural gas (LNG) and onshore coal seam gas. Shell holds large reserves in the North West Shelf, Gorgon, Browse Basin, onshore coal seam gas Surat and Bowen Basins in Queensland. It also maintains a substantial exploration portfolio in Australia with major representation in permits and reserves offshore Western Australia and the Northern Territory. A new head office in King's Square, Perth opened in January 2016.Shell Australia expands floor space in Perth Property Observer 28 May 2014 ==History== Shell's involvement in Australia began in 1901 when bulk fuel handling facilities commissioned by the 'Shell' Transport and Trading Company of London at Gore Bay, Sydney and on leased land in Melbourne, near Williamstown railway station. The arrival of the ship Turbo on 3 June was the first ever delivery of bulk kerosene to Australia. In 1903, the tanker – owned by the Shell/Royal Dutch joint venture Asiatic Petroleum Company – was wrecked outside of Port Phillip Bay, causing Australia's first major oil spill. In 1905 the Shell Transport and Trading Company and the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company established the British Imperial Oil Company in Australia as a joint venture. In 1916, Shell began bulk delivery to garages equipped with pumps. In 1926 it acquired the Neptune Oil Company; a year later the British Imperial Oil Company was renamed the Shell Company of Australia, and in 1928 it purchased the Clyde Refinery in Sydney. In 1954, Shell opened its second oil refinery in Geelong, and in 1959 established a detergent alkylate plant at Geelong and a petrochemical plant at Clyde. Its oil development arm was very active in the 1960s exploring large areas of onshore Australia as well as offshore opportunities. In 1984, domestic sales of LNG from the North West Shelf began, and a year later, Shell and its joint venture partners signed a sales and purchase agreement for North West Shelf LNG with eight Japanese electricity and gas utilities. By this stage Shell had increased its holding in joint venture operator Woodside Petroleum from 21% to 40%. The company is one of six participants and holds a 16.67% equity stake, alongside five other investors: BP, BHP Billiton Petroleum, Chevron, Mitsubishi/Mitsui and Woodside. ==Sale of downstream business== In August 2014, Shell sold its Australian refinery in Geelong and petrol stations for A$2.9 billion (US$2.6 billion) to Vitol, a Geneva based company. Vitol operates these assets as Viva Energy, which maintains Shell branding on its service stations under a brand licence arrangement. ==ProjectsPrelude=== In May 2011, Royal Dutch Shell finalised its investment for the world's first floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility. Shell had explored the concept of a FLNG in Namibia in the 1990s, but was abandoned due to unfavourable economic conditions. The initiative was relaunched in 2007 following the discovery of the offshore Prelude field located off Australia's north-west coast and was estimated to contain about 3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent reserves. The floating vessel to be used for the Prelude field, known as Prelude FLNG, was still being constructed in Geoje, South Korea in mid-June 2014. Promoted as the longest floating structure in the world, the vessel will consist of a processing structure, measuring 93 metres in height from the deck, that will take in the equivalent of 110,000 barrels of oil per day in natural gas and cool it into liquefied natural gas for transport and sale in Asia. The hull of the vessel was completed in December 2013 and the Prelude was scheduled to start producing LNG in 2016—analysts estimated the total cost of construction at more than US$12 billion. In December 2018, production started at the facility. The company has a 67.5 percent hold, alongside investors CPC Corporation, Inpex Corporation, and Korea Gas Corporation. ===Ningaloo=== In July 2011, the Federal Government gave approval for the company to drill an exploration well 50 km to the west of the Ningaloo Marine Park. The drilling operation will occur at depths of around 1,300 metres, the deepest ever in Australian waters. === Surat === In February 2019, Royal Dutch Shell was granted leases for $10 billion (AUS) towards the Surat project, which it will undergo with PetroChina under the joint venture of Arrow Energy. In December 2017, a 27-year deal was agreed in which Arrow would sell output to the company's Queensland Curtis LNG (QCNLG) project. It will use infrastructure from the company's QCLNG project do develop the biggest coal seam gas resource in the country, which is predicted to speed up the process and reduce the environmental impact. ==Sponsorships== Shell was tile sponsor of Dick Johnson Racing from 1987 until 2004. Having remained as a minor sponsor, it again became title sponsor for the rebranded DJR Team Penske in 2017. It also returned as the official fuel supplier for the series, having been so between 1987 and 2001. ==See also== *Gorgon gas project ==References * Category:Oil companies of Australia Category:Royal Dutch Shell subsidiaries Category:Automotive fuel retailers in Australia Category:Australian subsidiaries of foreign companies ","title":"Shell Australia"},{"id":"6198204","text":"Ava Lowery is an American peace activist and documentary filmmaker from Alabama who has created over 100 Flash-based animations denouncing the Iraq War, former United States President George W.

He published his first poem \\"River Water\\" while still in school. Cheon went to Seoul National University for a short period. In 1967 he was implicated in the East Berlin Spy Incident and jailed for six months during which he was brutally tortured. This experience scarred Cheon who became impotent and alcoholic. Found unconscious on the street Cheon was institutionalized and his friends, believing him to be dead, published a posthumous book of his poetry. Cheon, however recovered and began a prolific career. ==Work== Cheon Sang-byeong wrote his poetry with the intention of transcending the immediate world. He avoided artificial technique and excessive and decorative language and instead embraced raw emotion and unforced simplicity, and candidly explored weighty existential problems. His poetry was written in substantial and condensed language with scarcely an unnecessary or frivolous expression to detract the reader's attention from his objective as the writer: to scrutinize and divine the origin of the universe, the existence of life after death, and the reason for human suffering. His most famous poem “Return to Heaven” (Gwicheon), speaks of a man's encounter with the afterlife and his journey from life to death, as a passing from one world to another: “I am returning to heaven, the day on which my sojourn to this beautiful world ends. Go and say it was beautiful.” Chun Sangbyeong remained consistent and faithful to his ideal of writing poetry that aspires to surmount the vortex of this superficial and empirical reality to reach a higher plane of thought and feeling, without the assistance of sentimental frippery or romantic trappings to embellish his work.\\"Cheon Sang-byeong\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: ==Works in Translation\\"Cheon Sang-byeong\\" LTI Korea Datasheet available at LTI Korea Library or online at: == * Rumanian: L ÎNTOARCEREA ÎN CER detail (천상병 시선집) * Serbian: ПОВРАТАК НА НЕЪО detail (천상병 시선집 <귀천>) * Spanish: Regreso al cielo detail (귀천) * Turkish: Gőğe dőnüş detail (귀천) * French: Retour au ciel detail (천상병시선-귀천) ==Works in Korean (Partial)== * Bird (1971) * At the Roadside Inn (1979) * If Even the Journey to Afterlife Costs Money (1987) * I'm Going Back to Heaven (1993) * Collected Works of Cheon Sang-byeong (1996) == References  * \\"Cheon Sang-byeong\\" - at Naver * Cheon Sang-byeong Art Festivalofficial Category:Korean male poets Category:1930 births Category:1993 deaths Category:20th-century Korean poets Category:Yeongyang Cheon clan Category:20th-century male writers ","title":"Cheon Sang-byeong"},{"id":"6198238","text":"Annular eclipse of the Sun by Phobos (Curiosity, August 20, 2013) Eclipse of the Sun by Phobos, the larger of the two moons of Mars, in real time (Curiosity, August 20, 2013) The two moons of Mars, Phobos and Deimos, are much smaller than the Moon, greatly reducing the frequency of solar eclipses on that planet. Neither moon's apparent diameter is large enough to cover the disk of the sun, and therefore they are annular solar eclipses and can also be considered transits. ==Eclipses caused by Phobos== Opportunity, March 2004) Due to the small size of Phobos (about ) and its rapid orbital motion, an observer on the surface of Mars would never experience a solar eclipse for longer than about thirty seconds. Phobos also takes only 7 hours 39 minutes to orbit Mars, while a Martian day is 24 hours 37 minutes long, meaning that Phobos can create two eclipses per Martian day. These are annular eclipses, because Phobos is not quite large enough or close enough to Mars to create a total solar eclipse. ==Transits caused by Deimos== Deimos is too small (about ) and too far from Mars to cause an eclipse. The best an observer on Mars would see is a small spot crossing the Sun's disc. ==View from Earth== Both moons are too small to cast a shadow on Mars that can be seen from Earth.

The play opened in London on 28 October 1953 at the Winter Garden Theatre (although the first performance had been in Nottingham on 28 September). It was produced by Peter Saunders. ==Reception of London production== The Times of 29 October 1953 was enthusiastic in its praise stating, \\"The author has two ends in view, and she attains them both. She takes us now into the Old Bailey during an exciting trial for murder, now into chambers where the human reactions of the lawyers engaged in the case may be studied; and when the trial is over and there seems no more to be said, she swiftly ravels again the skein which the law has confidently unravelled and leaves herself with a denouement which is at once surprising and credible.\\" The reviewer outlined the basics of the plot, commenting that Patricia Jessel's performance in the dock was \\"cold-blooded\\" and that she \\"makes a clear-cut image of hatred releasing itself suddenly from inhibitions which have become intolerable\\" and that Derek Blomfield was \\"equally good\\". The greatest praise was reserved for the climax: \\"Mrs Christie has by this time got the audience in her pocket. A timely intervention of a woman of the streets offering new evidence seems precisely what the trial needs and when it is resumed the evidence brings it triumphantly to a satisfying conclusion. It is only then that the accomplished thriller writer shows her real hand.\\"The Times, 29 October 1953 (p. 7) Ivor Brown of The Observer said in the issue of 1 November 1953 that the play had, \\"all the usual advantages of Counsel in conflict, agonised outbreak in the dock, and back-answers from the witness- box. To these are added a considerable and ingenious appendix; the jury's verdict is only the beginning of a story that has as many twists as a pigtail.\\" He summed up with a comment on the performance of Patricia Jessel, who \\"takes the title-part with cool efficiency. Whether she is snake in the grass or butterfly on the wheel playgoers must find out for themselves. There will be plenty doing that.\\"The Observer, 1 November 1953 (p. 11) Philip Hope- Wallace in The Guardian's issue of 30 October 1953 said of the ending, \\"Justice has been done and has been seen to be done. We nod approvingly, at which moment Mrs Christie says in effect \\"Oh, so you thought that did you?\\" and with an unforeseen twist of the cards lets us see how wrong we were. This is satisfying, but it makes criticism almost impossible; first, one must not give away the clue and second, one must reconsider whether those witnesses who seemed the most plausible were not, in fact, less good players than those who seemed somehow not quite 'in character'\\".

Vasiliki wares are a distinctive type of Minoan pottery produced in Crete during the Minoan period, named for the finds around the town of Vasiliki, Lasithi, although it was produced at other sites too. The vases include a reddish-brown wash applied unevenly to mimic stone vessels.Minoans: Life in Bronze Age Crete, Rodney Castleden The mottling was produced by uneven firing of the slip-covered pot, with the hottest areas turning dark. Considering that the mottling was controlled into a pattern, touching with hot coals was probably used to produce it. There is also a style painted in a creamy white over the reddish-brown wash applied all over the body.

Boni became a major leader and conducted raids against Dutch plantations. Resulting intermittent warfare with Dutch militia, military and mercenaries, between 1768 and 1793, resulted in many Aluku seeking refuge in Papaïchton and other villages on the French side of the Marowijne River. On 25 May 1891, the Aluku people opted for French citizenship. The village of Cottica was resettled in 1902, and is the only settlement in Suriname. The village is not under the authority of the granman of the Aluku. Captain Bayo, who was the chief at the time of the founding, asked permission from the Surinamese government to be officially installed. Op 21 April 1903, there was an official meeting with the Governor. Bayo insisted that his granman was Ochi of the Aluku and not granman Oseyse of the Ndyuka.

It was ported to the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64. Cholo's gameplay is similar to that of Paradroid, but with wireframe graphics. == Gameplay == The story is set out in a novella which was included in the game's packaging. Following a nuclear war, humanity is trapped underground by a robot defence system that rules the irradiated surface. Your character assumes control of a robot drone, transmitting to a terminal below ground, and is given the task of freeing the trapped humans. The robot - \\"Rizzo the rat\\", a diagnostic model - is equipped with a single laser, computer/robot link capabilities and very limited armour. The player's first task is to explore the city and take over stronger robots in order to complete the mission. Gameplay consists of movement around a virtual 3D world, taking over other robots by shooting them until 'paralysed', running into them and entering a password to gain access. Each robot has different properties. \\"Aviata\\" is an aircraft who can fly, and transport other robots; \\"Igor\\" is a hacker who can access computer systems. The player can only control one robot at a time. All robots have four slots for 'rampacks' which are essentially files, either text files or programs which add extra functionality to your robot. The gameplay often involves swapping between robots in order to complete a certain task. A deliberately incomplete map showing the pre-war city shipped with the game in the form of an A3 size poster. The map also contains a partial robot identification chart. === Robot types === There are a number of different robot types in Cholo, nearly all of which can be controlled at some point in the game. Hacker and Flying eye robots *Vidbot - Fixed position camera robot *Leadcoat - Heavy duty radiation proof robot *Ratdroid - Diagnostic robot *Hacker - Hacker robot (unarmed) *Flying Eye - Mobile camera robot *Autodoc - Maintenance robot *Guard - Police robot *Grundon - Police tank robot *Flyboy - Aircraft robot *Ship - Ship robot == Legacy== Ovine by Design published a remake of the game using Tron-like graphics as freeware for Windows, with the approval of the original creators.https://web.archive.org/web/20120212100603/http://cholo.ovine.net/terminal/cholo- remake.php == References  External links == * * *Cholo box and manual at C64Sets.com *Cholo Remake website (Web Archive) *Cholo Remake (Download current version) Category:1986 video games Category:ZX Spectrum games Category:BBC Micro and Acorn Electron games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:First-person shooters Category:Post- apocalyptic video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Adventure games ","title":"Cholo (video game)"},{"id":"6198377","text":"\\"Babyshambles\\" is the first single for Pete Doherty's post-Libertines band of the same name.

Ferric subsulfate solution is also known as basic ferric sulfate solution or Monsel's solution. It has a recognised formula published in United States Pharmacopeia 29. ==Active ingredients== Ferric subsulfate solution is prepared from ferrous sulfate, sulfuric acid and nitric acid. It contains, per 100 mL, basic ferric sulfate equivalent to not less than 20g and not more than 22g of iron. ==Storage== Ferric subsulfate solution should be stored in airtight containers at a temperature above 22 degrees Celsius. Crystallization may occur at temperatures below 22 degrees. Warming the solution may redissolve the crystals. The solution should be protected from light. ==Other uses== Ferric subsulfate (also known as Monsel's solution) is often used by Jewish burial societies (chevra kadisha) to stop post-mortem bleeding. Since Jewish burial does not allow any external skin adhesives such as bandages, tape, glue or resin, ferric subsulfate is an effective way to stop post-mortem bleeding. Most post-mortem bleeding stems from surgery, emergency room situations, autopsies or blood which may result when removing IV lines during Jewish burial preparation. A piece of cotton, or Q-tip, soaked with this solution is pressed against the open wound and held for a few seconds. This is usually enough time for the seal to take effect. For more severe cases, such as arterial lines, if the line is still inside, the solution can be inserted directly into the IV line.Silver Spring Maryland Chevra Kadisha (Jewish Burial Society) ==Brandnames== AstrinGyn by CooperSurgical is a thickened and specially modified gel formulation. ==History== It was invented in the late 1840s by Leon Monsel (March 13, 1816 - April 15, 1878), a French military pharmacist.

Its population at the 2012 census was 13,808.Statoids.com Tapanahoni is a part of Sipaliwini which has no capital, but is directly governed from Paramaribo. Tapanahony is an enormous resort which encompasses a quarter of the country of Suriname. The most important town is Diitabiki (old name: Drietabbetje) which is the residence of the granman of the Ndyuka people since 1950, and the location of the oracle. The disputed area of south-east Suriname between the Marowini (the eastern tributary river) and the Litani rivers belongs to the Tapanahoni resort. ==History== The Ndyuka people are of African descent, and were shipped as slaves to Suriname in the 17-18th century to work on Dutch- owned colonial plantations. The escaped slaves moved into the rainforest, and banded together. There were frequent clashes between the colonists and the Ndyuka, however in 1760, a peace treaty was signed granting the Ndyuka autonomy. From 1761, the Ndyuka gradually moved southwards in order to protected themselves from the colonists, and started to build camps on the Tapanahoni River dispelling the indigenous Tiriyó. Slaves who had recently fled from Armina and Boven Commewijne were stationed near the confluence of the Tapanahoni and Lawa River to guard against attacks by the Aluku. In December 1791, Philip Stoelman founded a military outpost on Stoelmanseiland, thus establishing a militarised border between the Ndyuka held territory and the Colony of Suriname. In 1857, the granman of the Ndyuka was given a yearly allowance of ƒ1,000 (2018: €10,233) by the Government of Suriname. The area was an unknown area for the white settlers, and was not explored until the beginning of the 20th century. Still the explorers first had to request an audience with the granman. Gerard Versteeg, leader of a 1904 expedition, expressed his frustration in his dairy about having to wait four days before being granted permission to continue his journey. In 1983, the Sipaliwini District was created. On 11 September 2019, a new resort was created out of Tapanahony, and is called Pamacca. The Pamacca resort is the northern part of Tapanahony, and mainly inhabited by the Paramaccan people. ==Villages== The resort of Tapanahony consists of about 49 Ndyuka villages and 14 indigenous villages. { class=  !Name !Tribe !Clinic !School !Church - align=left Akani Pata  Wayana  no  no  no - align=left Aloepi 2  Tiriyó  ?  ?  ? - align=left Antonio do Brinco  not applicable  no  no  yes - align=left Apetina  Wayana  yes  yes  no - align=left Benzdorp  Ndyuka  no  no  no - align=left Cottica  Aluku  yes  yes  no - align=left Diitabiki  Ndyuka  yes  yes  Moravian - align=left Godo Holo  Ndyuka  via Diitabiki  yes  two - align=left Kawemhakan  Wayana  yes  no  no - align=left Kumakahpan  Wayana  no  no  no - align=left Moitaki  Ndyuka  no  yes  no - align=left Paloemeu  Wayana  yes  no  yes - align=left Pelelu Tepu  Tiriyó  yes  yes  yes - align=left Poeketi  Ndyuka  no  no  no - align=left Pontoetoe  Ndyuka  ?  ?  ? - align=left Tutu Kampu  Wayana  no  no  no } Source: Planning Office Suriname - Districts 2009-2013 - Table 3.1 ==NotesReferences== Category:Resorts of Suriname Category:Populated places in Sipaliwini District ","title":"Tapanahony"},{"id":"6198460","text":"Fabiola Morales Fabiola María Morales Castillo is a Peruvian politician and a Congresswoman representing Piura for the 2006–2011 term.

Historical Society of New Mexico) Illustrations by Jose Cisneros Origins of New Mexico Families: A Genealogy of the Spanish Colonial Period by Fray Angélico Chávez is an important work on the genealogy of Spanish New Mexican families. The first edition was published in 1954; a revised edition came out in 1992. ==Description== In researching the history of the statue La Conquistadora, Chávez came across a number of old church documents. These documents included baptisms, marriages and other vital records detailing the lives of the early Spanish settlers of New Mexico. Chávez realized the value that these documents had to the descendants of these people and began collecting the information in order to create a genealogy about early Spanish New Mexicans. Origins of New Mexico Families is the culmination of this research. The book itself is divided into two parts: the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Chávez himself admitted in his Introduction that the family histories in the book do not necessarily conform perfectly to these divisions. Chávez discovered two distinct Spanish colonizations of New Mexico. The first colonization occurred in 1598 under the leadership of don Juan de Oñate. In 1680 Pueblo Indians revolted against Spanish rule and the Spaniards were forced out of New Mexico. In 1693 Diego de Vargas led a second group of families into New Mexico to re-colonize the province. Both parts are further divided up into family surnames. Each surname section typically begins with that family's male progenitor and includes information on his wife (or wives), children and grandchildren. Some of the family genealogies from the first part continue on into the second part. There are a number of different surnames in the second part because there were new families that entered New Mexico in the eighteenth century and that certain families did not return to New Mexico after the Pueblo Revolt. The book includes drawings, photocopies and charts. Two drawings by José Cisneros (artist) depict the \\"Oñate Entrada\\" of 1598 and the \\"Vargas Entrada\\" of 1693. The photocopies are of certain documents such as a pages from inquisition records, matrimonial investigations, and marriage registers. Charts within the book demonstrate specific lineages of Españoles-Mexicanos, French and north- south Spanish, and ordained clerics within the Ortiz family. Throughout the book, Chávez linked many of the families to himself. In his introduction he acknowledged that this may look presumptive, but that his intention was actually to create a \\"graphic unifying medium\\" in order to lend direction to the compilation of loose facts. He wanted to demonstrate that all New Mexicans were part of one large family and inter-related. Since early New Mexicans did not include any great nobles or major historical figures, Chávez wanted to show that there was a reason for New Mexicans to delve into their own genealogy. ==Differences between the two editions== As mentioned before, the first edition only included a genealogy of families from the seventeen and eighteenth century. However, Chávez continued doing research on New Mexico families and in 1956 and 1957 he published a couple of articles in the magazine El Palacio. These articles expanded some of the family genealogies into the nineteenth century and included many names that were unique to that century. In 1992 the editor of the revised edition Thomas E. Chávez added these articles to the book. ==Contents of the revised edition== * Foreword to revised edition * Introduction * Oñate Entrada by José Cisneros ===Part One: The Seventeenth Century=== *Families alphabetically: Abendaño to Zamorano **Demonstration Chart (Chávez) **Page from Inquisition Records, 1626 **Demonstration Chart (Robledo-Romero) ===Part Two: The Eighteenth Century=== *Vargas Entrada by José Cisneros *Families Alphabetically: Abeyta to Zamora **Page from Matrimonial Investigation, 1716 **Demonstration Charts I and II (Baca) **Page from Santa Fe Marriage Register, 1734 **Page from Spanish Archives of New Mexico, 1712 **Demonstration Chart (Españoles-Mexicanos) **Demonstration Chart (French and North-South Spanish) ===Appendix=== *Additional Family Couples in Charts and Other Persons **Demonstration Chart (Ortiz Clerical) ===Addenda to original 1954 edition=== *Families alphabetically: Abeyta to Zarate *New names in New Mexico, 1820-1850 *Families alphabetically: Abilucia to Zepeda *Bibliography ==See also== * Baca family of New Mexico * Angelico Chavez ==References== * Chávez, Fray Angélico, Origins of New Mexico Families: A Genealogy of the Spanish Colonial Period, Rev.

It consisted of five regular battalions; numbered 1 to 5 and the 10th (Training) Battalion. During the Second World War a further ten battalions were raised. In 1945, the prenominal \\"12th\\" was dropped when the British Indian Army dispensed with prenominal numbering of its regiments. After the independence in 1947, it was formed into the Frontier Force Regiment, part of the army of Pakistan. ==HistoryEarly history=== The 12th Frontier Force Regiment's origins lie in the four infantry regiments of the Frontier Brigade authorised in 1846 and raised by Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Lawrence, the agent (and brother) of the Governor-General of the Punjab frontier region (John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence), from veterans of disbanded opposition forces after the First Anglo-Sikh War. The 1st Sikhs were raised by Captain J. S. Hodgson at Hoshiarpur, the 2nd Sikhs by Captain J.W.V. Stephen at Kangra, the 3rd Sikhs by Captain F. Winter at Ferozpur and the 4th Sikhs by Captain C. MacKenzie at Ludhiana. Even at the start the Sikhs, although in the majority, were not in the preponderance, the unit names referring to their origins in the disbanded Sikh Army rather than their racial mix.Condon (1962), p. 3 The nuclei of the regiments consisted of a few men from the regular Native Infantry regiments of the line and police officers.History of the 1st Sikh Infantry, 1846 – 1886, Volume 1, (1929) [1887], p. 3 The Governor-General issued a regulation in September 1847 which included the discontinuation of the term \\"Frontier Brigade\\" and renamed the four regiments the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Regiments of Sikh Local Infantry.History of the 1st Sikh Infantry, 1846 – 1886, Volume 1, (1929) [1887], p. 6 At the same time, Lawrence also ordered irregular force of mixed cavalry and infantry: the Corps of Guides to be raised at Mardan by Lieutenant Harry D. Lumsden. In 1851 the four Sikh regiments and the Corps of Guides became part of the Punjab Irregular Force. Men of these regiments (or their successors) are to this day known as Piffers. The four Sikh regiments also went through a number of minor name changes over the next 45 or so years: in 1857 they became \\"Regiment of Sikh Infantry, Punjab Irregular Force\\" and in 1865 \\"Regiment of Sikh Infantry, Punjab Frontier Force\\" (reflecting the change in name of the PIF to Punjab Frontier Force). In 1901, they became \\"Sikh Infantry\\". In 1876, the Corps of Guides became one of the first regiments in the Indian Army to be conferred royal status as Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides. In 1903, the reorganisation of the British Indian Army caused the four Sikh regiments to be re-designated the 51st, 52nd, 53rd and 54th Sikhs (Frontier Force) while the Corps of Guides infantry became Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides (Frontier Force) Infantry, and was renamed again in 1911 as Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides (Frontier Force) Lumsden's Infantry. ===Formation of 12th Frontier Force Regiment=== In the 1922 reorganisation of the British Indian Army, the four Sikh regiments became the first four battalions of the newly constituted 12th Frontier Force Regiment. The two infantry battalions of the Corps of Guides became its 5th and 10th (training) battalions. At the same time the first battalion became the 1st battalion (Prince of Wales' Own Sikhs) whilst the 3rd battalion was made the 3rd Royal Battalion (Sikhs) in 1935. The Corps of Guides, being the senior unit, were entitled to have become the 1st battalion but agreed to allow the four Sikh battalions to retain their historical 1 to 4 numberingCondon (1962), pp. 152–3 although in a later incarnation the precedence was restored in the 1957 reorganisation of the Pakistan Army when the Guides battalion became the 2nd battalion of the new regiment, following the Scinde Rifles battalion from the Frontier Force Rifles regiment. The location of the training battalion, later to grow into the Regimental Centre, was first at Mardan but moved to Sialkot in 1929.Condon (1962), p. 153 ===Second World War=== During the Second World War the regiment's battalions (expanded in number by seven war-formed units) saw service in East Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, Italy, India, Malaya and Burma. The Regiment's casualties in the war totalled 1,444 dead and 3,503 wounded.Condon (1962), p. 586. ===Regular battalions=== * 1/12th (Prince of Wales's Own Sikhs) Frontier Force Regiment In 1939, the 1/12th Frontier Force Rifles were part of the Bannu Brigade based in Bannu India and took part in operations in the Ahmedzai Salient in February and March 1940 while under command of the Jhelum Brigade.Condon (1962), p. 301. In the autumn of 1940 the battalion transferred to the Delhi Cantonment and on 15 May 1941, the battalion was transferred to the 17th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of the 8th Indian Infantry Division which was being raised in Bombay, and with which it remained for the rest of the war. The 1/12th served in Iraq and Syria before it was sent to fight in the Italian Campaign on 24 September 1943. * 2/12th (2nd Sikhs) Frontier Force Regiment The 2/12th FFR, also part of the Bannu Brigade, before being sent to Malaya in April 1941 where it became part of the 22nd Indian Infantry Brigade. This battalion fought a successful, but doomed, defence of the eastern coast of Malaya, during the Battle of Malaya, before it was forced to surrender with the rest of the Allied forces in Singapore on 15 February 1942. The commanding officer of the 2/12th FFR, Lt.Col.Arthur Edward Cumming, received the Victoria Cross during this campaign. * 3/12th (Royal) Frontier Force Regiment The 3/12th FFR was part of the 5th Indian Infantry Division during the East African and Western Desert Campaigns. The 3/12th FFR was all but destroyed at El Adem on 15 June 1942. It was reformed in Egypt before transferring to the 4th Indian Infantry Division. * 4/12th (Sikhs) Frontier Force Regiment The 4/12th FFR served throughout the war in the Burma Campaign. * 5/12th (Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides) Frontier Force Regiment The 5/12th FFR served throughout the Second World War as part of the 6th Indian Infantry Division on garrison duties in Iraq. ==Later history== In 1945, the regiment was renamed the Frontier Force Regiment, dropping the numerical designation \\"12\\", and on the independence in 1947, it was allocated to Pakistan. In 1957, the Frontier Force Rifles and The Pathan Regiment (which had been formed after independence from the 14th battalion Frontier Force Regiment and the 14th and 15th battalions Frontier Force Rifles) were amalgamated with it to form a new Frontier Force Regiment. 255px ==Battle honours== * Mooltan, Goojerat, Punjaub, Pegu, Delhi 1857, * Ali Masjid, Kabul 1879, * Ahmed Khel, Kandahar 1880, * Afghanistan 1878–80, * Chitral, Malakand, Punjab Frontier, Tirah, Pekin 1900, * Somaliland 1901–04, * Suez Canal, Egypt 1915, * Megiddo, Sharon, Nablus, Palestine 1918, * Aden, Tigris 1916, * Kut- al-Amara 1917, * Baghdad, Sharqat, Mesopotamia 1915–18, * NW Frontier, India 1914, 1915, 1916–17, * Afghanistan 1919, * Gallabat, Tehamiyam Wells, Agordat, Barentu, Keren, Amba Alagi, Abyssinia 1940–41, * Gazala, Bir Hacheim, El Adem, North Africa 1940–43, * Landing in Sicily, Sicily 1943, * Landing at Reggio, The Sangro, Mozzagrogna, Romagnoli, The Moro, Impossible Bridge, Cassino II, Pignataro, Advance to Florence, Campriano, Gothic Line, Coriano, Montebello- Scorticata, The Senio, Santerno Crossing, Italy 1943–45, * Athens, Greece 1944–45, * North Malaya, Kota Bharu, Central Malaya, Kuantan, Machang, Singapore Island, Malaya 1941–42, * Moulmein, Sittang 1942, 1945, * Pegu 1942, 1945, * Taukkyan, Shwegyin, North Arakan, Buthidaung, Maungdaw, Ngakyedauk Pass, Imphal, Tamu Road, Shenam Pass, Bishenpur, Kyaukmyaung Bridgehead, Arakan Beaches, Ramree, Taungup, Mandalay, Myinmu, Fort Dufferin, Kyaukse 1945, * Meiktila, Nyaungu Bridgehead, Capture of Meiktila, Defence of Meiktila, The Irrawaddy, Rangoon Road, Pyawbwe, Toungoo, Burma 1942–45 ==See also== * Frontier Force Regiment * 13th Frontier Force Rifles * List of Regiments of the British Indian Army (1903) * List of Regiments of the British Indian Army (1922) ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Condon, Brig WEH.

The property has been owned by the National Trust since 1960 when the Holbech family endowed it to them, and is still managed by Geoffrey Holbech's daughter Caroline Beddall. It is a Grade IBritish Listed Buildings listed building. The Holbech family acquired the Farnborough estate in 1684 and the honey-coloured (Hornton) stone house was built soon after. The family first moved into the house in 1692, and apart from in both World War 1 and World War 2 when the house was used as an auxiliary hospital, the family have lived in the main house and it has been the seat of the Holbech family. William Holbech bought the estate in 1684 and built the house but the major changes to the property occurred between 1745 and 1750 when the entrance front was remodelled and the rococo plasterwork was added to the interior. This work was carried out by William Holbech junior who wanted a suitable setting for the sculpture and art he had brought back from his Grand Tour. His close friend was the painter Canaletto who was commissioned to produce four artworks (albeit in two orders) to hang in the main Dining room. Three paintings by Pannini were also commissioned by William Holbech. The originals of the Canaletto's and Pannini's were sold in the 1920s after the First War but copies still hang today in their place. He used designs by his close friend Sanderson Miller for the landscape, an architect, who lived a few miles away. Sanderson Miller's protege was a little known man at the time who went on to design most of the great landscapes that still exist today, his name was Capability Brown. Long Palladian facades with sash windows, pedimented doorways and a balustraded roofline were also added to the earlier classical west front. Unlike many of its contemporaries, Farnborough Hall and its landscaped gardens have experienced little alteration in the last 200 years and they remain largely as William Holbech left them. The entrance opens straight into the Italianate hall. The walls are adorned with busts of Roman emperors set into oval niches and the panelled ceiling is stuccoed with rococo motifs. The dining room on the south front was especially designed to display works by Canaletto and Giovanni Paolo Panini. The original works are long gone, being replaced by copies. The drawing room has panels of elaborate stuccowork featuring scrolls, shells, fruit and flowers; these serve as a framework for more Italian works of art. A stucco garland of fruit and flowers encircles the skylight above the staircase hall. ==Gardens== In the mid 18th century the gardens were significantly enhanced by architect Sanderson Miller to dramatic effect. The land at the front of the Hall slopes downward to give a view of lake below. To the left of the house a grassy Terrace Walk is flanked by trees and excellent views of the Warwickshire plain can be had from here. The terrace leads past an Ionic temple and an oval pavilion, which has two storeys and elaborate plasterwork, to an obelisk at the end of the walk. The high obelisk was completed in 1751 (rebuilt in 1828 after it collapsed in 1823) and contains the name of Italian prisoners of war that were inscribed on the base during World War Two.Nicholson, Jean et al: The Obelisks of Warwickshire, page 19.

The highway serves the Research Triangle area, between Burlington and Raleigh, connecting the cities and towns of Chapel Hill, Durham, Morrisville and Cary. The highway also links the campuses of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. NC 54 runs from US 70 in Burlington along Chapel Hill Road through the downtown area of Graham. Turning to the southeast the route runs through some of the outskirts of Burlington before moving through a predominantly rural area. Approaching Chapel Hill, the highway follows the NC 54 \\"Bypass\\" around the town and runs concurrently with US 15/US 501 until reaching Raleigh Road. At Raleigh Road, NC 54 continues to the east crossing I-40 and running through the outskirts of Durham. The road continues to follow I-40 as it enters into Research Triangle Park and Morrisville. NC 54 follows Chapel Hill Road until reaching the downtown area of Cary where it uses Maynard Road as a bypass. On the eastern side of Cary, NC 54 turns back onto Chapel Hill Road and follows the road until reaching Hillsborough Street near Raleigh. At Hillsborough Street, NC 54 turns to the east to follow the street through west Raleigh and along the NC State Fairgrounds. The highway ends at I-440/US 1 west of downtown Raleigh. NC 54 first appeared as an original state highway running from NC 75 in Pittsboro to Moncure. However, by 1928 the route was recommissioned as a secondary road which remains today as Moncure Pittsboro Road. The current NC 54 was signed in 1929 from Graham to US 70 south of Durham. In 1930 it was further extended through Rockingham to the Virginia border, however in 1940 much of that routing was renumbered as NC 87\\\\. The route was further extended in 1953 where it ran concurrent along US 70A until reaching US 1 in Cary. The Chapel Hill Bypass was completed in 1956 and NC 54 was rerouted from its downtown Chapel Hill routing to the new bypass. The last major change to the routing occurred in 1963 when NC 54 was extended along Hillsborough Street to the then-new US 1 freeway (present day I-440). ==Route descriptionBurlington to Chapel Hill=== NC 54 east begins in western Burlington at the intersection of US 70/NC 62 (Church Street) and Chapel Hill Street. This intersection is a right-in/right-out intersection with US 70 eastbound; access to and from westbound US 70 is provided through South O'Neal Street. NC 54 is also signed along this sub- segment of O'Neal Street. Westbound NC 54 approaching interchange with I-40/I-85 in Graham NC 54 follows Chapel Hill Road to the intersection of NC 49/NC 100 (Maple Avenue) in downtown Graham. NC 54 joins NC 49 north on Harden Street through downtown. The route roughly parallels I-40 to the south as it enters into the downtown area of Graham. NC 49/NC 54 turns to the northeast before intersecting NC 87 (West Elm Street). After the intersection, the road turns east and follows along a concurrency with NC 49 and NC 87. NC 87 turns off at Main Street in downtown Graham. Three blocks to the east, NC 49 exits at East Elm Street. NC 54 begins its turn southeast and crosses I-40/I-85 at its exit 148. NC 54 remains on Harden Street until it crosses the Haw River and is known from that point solely as NC 54. After crossing the Haw River, NC 54 remains relatively parallel to the river. The route passes east of Swepsonville, where it also passes by a country club along with a large manufacturing plant. Immediately after passing the plant, the road intersects the southern terminus of NC 119 at an intersection with East Main Street. After the intersection the road turns more toward the east and runs through an area which is primarily rural with multiple neighborhoods surrounding the route. After passing through the unincorporated community of Oaks, the road makes a gradual turn from its southeastern direction towards an eastern direction. Several farms lie adjacent to the road as most of the neighborhoods dissipate. NC 54 finishes its eastern turn as it enters another unincorporated community, White Cross. The route briefly turns northeasterly, then turns back to a gradual southeastern direction after passing by a quarry. As the road nears Carrboro, several neighborhoods and businesses are found adjacent to the highway. Before intersecting Old Fayetteville Road, the highway begins to widen from a two- lane road, to a four-lane divided highway. The highway passes by a strip mall immediately after passing Old Fayetteville Road, and intersects Main Street before turning to the south. NC 54 follows a limited access highway known as the NC 54 Bypass, along the south side of Carrboro and Chapel Hill. The highway has diamond interchanges at Jones Ferry Road, South Greensboro Street, and South Columbia Street, where NC 86 has its southern terminus and US 15/US 501 joins NC 54. The road becomes Fordham Boulevard, where the highway begins to turn north to head toward Durham. ===Chapel Hill to Morrisville=== NC 54 exits east on Raleigh Road on the east side of Chapel Hill. Multiple strip malls and neighborhoods are located adjacent to the route as it heads southeast towards Durham. After passing by a developed area east of Chapel Hill, the route turns east and becomes the Nelson-Chapel Hill Highway, a divided highway connecting Fordham Boulevard and I-40. The route crosses I-40 at a partial cloverleaf interchange. After an intersection with Leigh Farm Road, the road narrows to a two-lane road and continues east toward Durham. As NC 54 approaches NC 751 (Hope Valley Road), it widens again to a four-lane road with a turning lane. Once reaching Hope Valley Road, a group of stores are found congregated around the intersection. The road has another immediate intersection with Garrett Road and then begins a slow turn toward the southeast before turning back into a two-lane road and completing its southeasterly turn. After passing Rollingwood Drive, the road again widens up to a four-lane road. Several shopping centers appear as the road nears an intersection with Fayetteville Road. Directly after the intersection, the road narrows back down to a two-lane road and passes under I-40 at a diagonal. The route somewhat parallels the freeway and forms the northern border for the Wellington Forest neighborhood. The route briefly widens at the intersection of Barbee Road before passing by several houses and a park. Just before reaching NC 55 (Apex Highway), NC 54 once again widens to a four-lane road. Passing NC 55, the road crosses a railroad track before entering into Research Triangle Park. Several office buildings are found both adjacent to and along roads that branch off of NC 54. The road intersects TW Alexander Drive before crossing over NC 147 (Triangle Expressway). NC 54 approaches South Miami Boulevard after crossing under another railroad. At the intersection, NC 54 turns right to follow Miami Boulevard to the south towards Cary. Miami Boulevard crosses Page Road and passes by several office buildings and stores. At Surles Court, the road makes a shift to turn more toward the east, directly paralleling the railroad NC 54 previously crossed under. An interchange with NC 540 marks the road's entrance into Morrisville and the road's name change to Chapel Hill Road. ===Morrisville to Raleigh=== Chapel Hill Road begins by running through a primarily residential area of Morrisville. However, after passing McCrimmon Parkway, the area shifts to more industrial-style commerce, including several warehouses. The road intersects Airport Boulevard, which provides access to Raleigh-Durham International Airport. The road runs directly through the middle of Morrisville at intersections with Aviation Parkway/Morrisville Carpenter Road. As Chapel Hill Road bears further to the east, the highway splits from the railroad track that it had been previously running alongside of. Entering into Cary, the road serves as access to the Park West Village Shopping Center and the surrounding apartment complexes. Briefly after intersecting Northwest Cary Parkway, the road narrows back down from a four-lane road to a two-lane road. Continuing further, the road meets back up with the railroad that it had previously broken away from and roughly begins to parallel it again. Chapel Hill Road makes a turn towards the east to meet up with Maynard Road. At the intersection, NC 54 turns left to follow along Maynard Road to the east. The four-lane road passes by West Cary Middle School and Robert Godbold Park before entering into a mixed residential/commercial section north of the center of Cary. Continuing east along Maynard Road, the highway runs along a residential area north of downtown Cary. The road turns toward the southeast and meets up with Reedy Creek Road. Maynard Road meets back up with Chapel Hill Road on the eastern side of downtown Cary. NC 54 turns left onto Chapel Hill Road to continue heading east towards Raleigh. Chapel Hill Road intersects Trinity Road briefly before meeting I-40 at exit 290. Entering into Raleigh, the road name continues as Chapel Hill Road. Chapel Hill Road intersects the southern terminus of Edwards Mill Road, providing access to Carter-Finley Stadium and the PNC Arena. Briefly after the intersection, NC 54 widens to a four-lane divided road and continues that way until reaching Hillsborough Street. At the intersection, NC 54 continues east onto Hillsborough Street and once again closely parallels the same railroad. NC 54 provides multiple accesses to the North Carolina State Fairgrounds before intersecting Blue Ridge Road. Continuing east, NC 54 runs along the south side of NC State's Centennial Biomedical Campus. NC 54 reaches its eastern terminus at I-440/US 1 at exit 3, a folded diamond interchange. Hillsborough Street continues east to access NC State's North Campus and Downtown Raleigh. ==History== The routing for the original NC 54 was included on the 1916 map of the planned state highway system in North Carolina. However, NC 54 was not officially marked on any state highway maps until 1924; it was routed from NC 75 in Pittsboro southeast to NC 50 in Moncure, connecting the town to US 1. By 1929, the first NC 54 was decommissioned and was redesignated as a secondary road. At the same time, NC 54 was signed along a new routing beginning at US 70/NC 10 in Graham and running along its current routing to US 70/NC 10 in Nelson. In 1930, the route was extended north to Virginia. NC 54 was placed onto a concurrency with NC 100 to Burlington, where it then followed a new routing through Ossipee to NC 703 near Thompsonville. The road followed along a brief concurrency with NC 703 to the west into Thompsonville, where it then was extended back onto a new routing north to Reidsville. It then replaced NC 709 north to the Virginia border. By 1940 the routing of NC 54 north of Graham was replaced by NC 87. The route was then extended along a section of NC 93 to connect with US 70 on the western side of Burlington. NC 54 was extended along US 70A between 1952 and 1953, and then placed onto Chapel Hill Road to Cary where it ended at US 1. By 1955, NC 54 was placed from its routing through downtown Chapel Hill along its current bypass around Carrboro and Chapel Hill. The previous routing was signed as NC 54A and, by 1959, became NC 54 Business before being decommissioned in 1985. The route was extended along Hillsborough Street by 1963 to US 1, which later became Interstate 440. Between 2000 and 2002, NC 54 was routed onto the northern loop of Maynard Street around Cary. ==Future== Currently, the town of Morrisville is building an extension to McCrimmon Parkway along the eastern side of NC 54 and the center of town. The road, which is scheduled to be completed between 2018 and 2021, would serve as a bypass NC 54, which is mostly two lanes through the town. However, there has been no official word from the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) if the highway will be routed onto McCrimmon Parkway. In October 2015, the towns of Cary and Morrisville held a joint meeting over the future of NC 54 between the towns. NC 54 currently has 16,000 to 20,000 vehicles using the road each day. By 2040, the towns project that nearly 45,000 vehicles will be using the road daily. NCDOT, the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization, and the Town of Morrisville teamed up on the study of the corridor from NC 540 to Maynard Road. Ideally, the road would become a four- to six-lane superstreet from the Durham County line southeast into Cary. Besides the study, the NCDOT has yet to allocate money to make improvements to NC 54. ==Major intersectionsRelated route== North Carolina Highway 54 Alternate (NC 54A) was a renumbering of NC 54 through Carrboro (via Main Street) and Chapel Hill (via Franklin Street, Columbia Street, South Road and Raleigh Road). The route was commissioned in 1955 after NC 54 was shifted from its downtown Chapel Hill routing to the new Carrboro and Chapel Hill bypass. NC 54A served as a connection into Chapel Hill and to the campus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The route was redesignated NC 54 Business (NC 54 Bus.) in 1959. In 1985, the route was decommissioned and became secondary streets. ==References * NCRoads.com: N.C. 54 054 Category:Transportation in Alamance County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Orange County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Durham County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Wake County, North Carolina Category:U.S. Route 70 ","title":"North Carolina Highway 54"},{"id":"6198505","text":"Rosa María Mercedes Venegas Mello is a Peruvian politician and a Congresswoman representing Piura for the 2006–2011 term.

He raced for a number of years in the Craftsman Truck Series, earning four top-tens in sixteen starts. ==Pre-NASCAR Career== Prior to racing in NASCAR's national touring series, he found success in NASCAR's All-Pro Series, and was the winner of the ASA's Miller 300 at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds in 1995.Bobby Gill's Racing Career - ultimateracinghistory.com ==Career== Most of Gill's starts in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series came in 1996, when he started off with Spears Motorsports. In his debut with the team, he started 15th and finished 23rd at Homestead-Miami. Then, the very next race at Phoenix, Gill earned his first career top-10 with a ninth-place showing. He would later better that with a 7th at Tucson and Bristol and a 6th at Milwaukee. He also earned one top-10 start at Colorado. Curiously, after an 11th-place finish at Louisville, Gill was released from the team for unspecified reasons. He was running 11th in the points at the time, just thirty points out of tenth. Gill recovered by joining Billy Ballew Motorsports for three races in later 1996. After finishing 22nd at Nashville, Gill closed out the year with a pair of 11ths, allowing him to finish 21st in points, despite missing ten races during the year. Gill returned to the series for two starts in 2000. He started 7th in his season debut at Milwaukee before finishing 34th due to a rear end gear failure. He did not fare much better at Memphis, where he crashed to 32nd. Gill has not competed in major NASCAR since. ==Post-NASCAR career== Residing in Dalton, Georgia, Gill has carved out a successful niche in the USAR Hooters Pro Cup developmental series where he won three straight championships from 1999 to 2001. Gill added his fourth USAR championship in 2007.\\"New schedule, same objective for champ Gill\\". Myrtle Beach, SC: The Sun News, March 15, 2008.

Formed in Middlesbrough in 1978 by vocalist David Coverdale, the band originally featured guitarists Micky Moody and Bernie Marsden, bassist Neil Murray, keyboardist Peter Solley and drummer Dave Dowle. The group's debut EP Snakebite was released in June 1978 and reached number 61 on the UK Singles Chart. After replacing Solley with Jon Lord, the band released their debut full-length album Trouble later in the year, which reached number 50 on the UK Albums Chart.UK Albums Chart peak positions for Whitesnake releases: *Live... in the Shadow of the Blues: *All other releases: 1979's Lovehunter reached number 29 on the chart.

Three singles from across the two albums reached the UK Singles Chart top 40. After a brief hiatus and several lineup changes, Whitesnake resurfaced in 1984 with Slide It In, which was their first album to reach the US top 40. It was also the band's first release to be certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), reaching double platinum status. 1987's Whitesnake was even more successful, reaching number 2 on the Billboard 200, number 5 on the Canadian Albums Chart, and the top ten in several other regions.

It went on to sell over 20,000 copies until it was withdrawn from the shelves by WH Smith when the store was made aware of its overtly adult content. The idea of the game was to drive around looking for fliers and energi [sic] tablets. Once the player had accumulated enough energi tablets, they could then proceed to their rave and dance, until they collected all three sections of the WOW Tryptich.

He broke into the first team in 1905–06 thanks to the departure of James Bradley to Liverpool. Whilst was not as good as the talented Bradley Sturgess more than made up for it with his determination and graft. Stoke who had survived several relegation battles in the early 1900s were relegated in 1906–07. It got worse for Stoke as the club's finances imploded in 1907–08 forcing the club out of the Football League. Sturgess was sold to Sheffield United in a bid to raise much needed funds. He was signed by Sheffield United from Stoke in 1908, along with George Gallimore, for the maximum transfer fee at the time of £350. He was a tall wiry defender and was nicknamed hairpin because of his build. He played primarily at wing-half or half-back in his time with Sheffield United, forging a formidable partnership with George Utley and Bill Brelsford. Sturgess was the type of professional footballer that all football clubs yearn for. He played with skill and determination in all positions, and, whether as a forward, half-back, full-back, or emergency goalkeeper, Sturgess never gave less than 100%, and well deserved his reputation as the one man football team. He made his debut for the Blades in a Division One match at Bury on 1 September 1908, replacing Ernest Needham at left-half. He was also part of the victorious Sheffield United FA Cup winning team of 1915, when United beat Chelsea 3–1 at Old Trafford, on 24 April 1915. He went on to make 353 league appearances and five goals for the Blades, between 1908 and 1922. After World War I, he played mainly as full-back but turned out in most positions in the Blades team. He was noted for his fine tacking and anticipation and long accurate kicking, he gave Sheffield United and Stoke excellent service missing very few games in a long career. Twice an ever-present in United colours, he still managed forty league games in the season that he celebrated his fortieth birthday. In 1923, he joined Norwich City where he would spend one season and making 47 appearances for the Canaries helping them to (what was) their best league finish so far, 11th in Division Three South. He retired from football at the age of 43 in 1925, and being a native of Etruria, he opened a china shop in Ecclesall Road, Sheffield.Clarebrough, Denis. Down Memory Lane, Sheffield United Match Day Programme, 14 December 1985. He died in 1957 aged 74. ==International career== While with Sheffield United Sturgess won 2 England caps – versus Northern Ireland at the Baseball Ground on 11 February 1911, and versus Scotland at Hampden Park on 14 April 1914. ==Career statisticsClub=== Source: {  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" - !rowspan=\\"2\\"Club !rowspan=\\"2\\"Season !colspan=\\"3\\"League !colspan=\\"2\\"FA Cup !colspan=\\"2\\"Total - !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=\\"7\\"Stoke 1902–03 First Division 100010 - 1903–04 First Division 300030 - 1904–05 First Division 900090 - 1905–06 First Division 37021391 - 1906–07 First Division 37230402 - 1907–08 Second Division 37160431 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !124!!3!!11!!1!!135!!4 - rowspan=\\"12\\"Sheffield United 1908–09 First Division 29010300 - 1909–10 First Division 38110391 - 1910–11 First Division 32010330 - 1911–12 First Division 32310333 - 1912–13 First Division 29000290 - 1913–14 First Division 28070350 - 1914–15 First Division 36170431 - 1919–20 First Division 42020440 - 1920–21 First Division 31000310 - 1921–22 First Division 36010370 - 1922–23 First Division 20010210 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !353!!5!!22!!0!!375!!5 - rowspan=\\"3\\"Norwich City 1923–24 Third Division South 32030350 - 1924–25 Third Division South 15020170 - !colspan=\\"2\\"Total !47!!0!!5!!0!!52!!0 - !colspan=\\"3\\"Career Total !524!!8!!38!!1!!562!!9 } ===International=== Source: { class= style=\\"text-align: center\\" - !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals - rowspan=2England 191110 - 191410 - !colspan=2Total!!2!!0 } ==Honours== Sheffield United *FA Cup: Winners 1915 ==References== ; Specific ;General *Clarebrough, Denis (1989).

These contain the Faculty of Engineering (see Arenberg Château), the Faculty of Bioscience Engineering and the Faculty of Science. A part of the Biomedical Group, namely the Faculty of Kinesiology and Rehabilitation Sciences also has its main facilities on the campus. The is another higher education facility with some facilities in Heverlee. It lies next to the Heilig Hart-Instituut, which is a school for secondary education. Also, St John Berchmans University College, Heverlee is situated outside the centre. ==Sport== Den Dreef Also situated in Heverlee is the Den Dreef stadium, home of the Belgian 2nd Division football team Oud-Heverlee Leuven. The Cyclocross Leuven is a cyclo- cross race held in January. ==Economy== Heverlee also has industrial parks with all kinds of companies, some of which are affiliated (as spin-offs) with the university and its research. IMEC, Thrombogenics - now Oxurion and Materialise NV are some of the most important ones. The Brabanthal is a large hall, mostly for recreational events. ==Gallery== Image:Heverlee Lambertus A.jpgSt-Lambertus church File:Castle Arenberg, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven adj.jpgCastle Arenberg, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven File:Heverlee War Cemetery-5.JPGHeverlee War Cemetery File:Oud-Heverlee paddenstoel D.jpgOud- Heverlee paddenstoel File:Heverlee Station - panoramio.jpgHeverlee Station ==See also== * Arenberg Research-Park == References  Category:Sub-municipalities of Leuven Category:Populated places in Flemish Brabant ","title":"Heverlee"},{"id":"6198674","text":"North Carolina Highway 55 (NC 55) is a primary state highway in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It serves as a traffic artery connecting Durham with Cary and numerous small cities and towns in The Triangle on its way toward the Pamlico Sound. A portion of NC 55 extends through Research Triangle Park. NC 55 is a major artery in the central part of The Triangle region, and is a four lane, divided highway between Durham and Cary and Apex. NC 55 is also a divided highway between Apex and Fuquay-Varina. ==Route description== Although NC 55 is signed east–west, the route itself is more \\"L\\" shaped. Between Durham and Erwin, the eastbound direction physically heads south and westbound is physically north. After Erwin to its eastern terminus, the route follows a more directly eastward routing. The western terminus is at US 501 Business (North Roxboro Street) just north of I-85. Here the road is locally known as Avondale Dr. Eastbound NC 55 heads south through Durham, leaving Avondale Dr. on a short connector road to join North Alston Ave. NC 55 stays on Alston Avenue, crossing NC 147 (Durham Freeway) and passing North Carolina Central University. After NC Central, the NC 55 leaves Alston Avenue. Locally it is signed south of this point as just \\"NC 55\\" but it carries a secondary designation as Apex Highway. As it passes through the western side of Research Triangle Park, it crosses first I-40, then NC 54, and the toll NC 540 as it leaves Durham County and enters Wake County. Passing near the center of the unincorporated village of Carpenter, eastbound NC 55 goes southbound along the western edges of Morrisville and Cary. In Apex, it crosses US 64 near the large Beaver Creek Shopping center, and goes south of downtown Apex along Williams Street. Leaving Apex southbound, the road crosses US 1 before it splits into a business route (the original highway) and bypass route around the town of Holly Springs (as of October 3, 2019, NC 55 is officially routed along the Bypass route, the NC 55 route through town is now designated as SR 6107).Route Changes, Division 5, Wake County, North Carolina Department of Transportation, Certificate if Rule Making, October 3, 2019, p. 7. Downloaded from: https://connect.ncdot.gov/resources/safety/Ordinance%20Packages/2019/2019_10_03.pdf, Oct. 14, 2019 Extensive reconstruction of the roadway in this area, widened in anticipation of higher traffic volumes from NC 540 and construction in Apex and Cary, was completed in 2007. NC 55 is a major highway in western Wake County and is a direct link connecting the Triangle cities of Durham and Cary via the Research Triangle Park. Next, NC 55 enters the town of Fuquay-Varina, forming the main road through the Varina Commercial Historic District. After Varina, the highway joins NC 42 and US 401 as a three way concurrency crossing the north side of Fuquay, with eastbound NC 55 heading east through this area, before splitting off at the eastern edge of the town at the \\"Five Points\\" junction. Here, eastbound NC 55 goes due south through the unincorporated community of Kennebec leaving Wake County. Entering Harnett County, eastbound NC 55 still continues in a primarily south/southeast direction, forming the main north-south routes through the center of the towns of Angier and Coats. Between Angier and Coats, traffic heading for Buies Creek and Campbell University would leave NC 55 at either Oak Grove Church Road or NC 27\\\\. Southeast of Coats, NC 55 passes through the sparsely populated unincorporated community of Turlington before joining US 421 and entering the town of Erwin. While the roadway that carries NC 55 continues through Erwin as NC 217, NC 55 itself joins US 421\\\\. The two highways cross into the city of Dunn together; shortly after a junction with I-95, NC 55 leaves US 421 and enters Sampson County. From the joining US 421 in Erwin, the eastbound route to its eastern terminus now follows a more directly eastern route. NC 55 roughly follows the northern boundary of Sampson County, crossing several times between Sampson and Johnston County, joining NC 50 as the main east-west route through the town of Newton Grove. NC 55/NC 50 split at the border of Wayne County, with NC 55 heading eastward past the northern edge of the college town of Mount Olive, also known for the Mount Olive Pickle Company. NC 55 passes through the town of Seven Springs before turning to the northeast to enter the city of Kinston in Lenoir County. East of Kinston, NC 55 takes a winding path, roughly following the Neuse River to its mouth at New Bern, crossing at the Neuse and Trent rivers along a bridge concurrent with US 17 and US 70\\\\. East of New Bern, NC 55 forms the main east-west route through Pamlico County, passing through several small towns including the county seat of Bayboro. East of Bayboro, the road curves to the southeast and south before ending at the Pamlico Sound in Oriental. ==History== NC 55 was first routed from NC 50 and US 1 (current US 1A) in Franklinton to Durham. In 1930 maps showed that NC 91 had replaced NC 55 route from Franklinton to Durham and instead NC 55 took the place of NC 13 north of Durham to the Virginia state line. In 1932 NC 55 was extended south through Apex and Holly Springs. The road then turned east to go to US 401 and NC 21 in Cardenas. NC 55 then replaced NC 210 through Angier and Erwin. It then ended at US 301 and NC 22 in Godwin. In 1934 NC 55 was removed from its routing north of Durham and US 501 got the route. At the same time that year NC 55 was routed east along US 421 from Erwin to Dunn then as a new primary route to Newton Grove (near present-day I-40). Then it would replace US 117 through Mount Olive and Kinston and then ended at US 70 in Jasper. The route from Erwin to Godwin became NC 82\\\\. In 1938, NC 55 was rerouted further east through Tuscarora and ended at US 70 in Clark. In 1940, NC 55 was rerouted from Mount Olive to Seven Springs which is its current routing. Also that year NC 55 was routed from Jasper to New Bern then crossed the Neuse River along with US 17\\\\. The same year was extended along NC 302 from Bridgetown to Oriental. NC 302 was dissolved. In 1941 US 70 and NC 55 \\"swapped\\" routes from Kinston to Clarks. In 1948, NC 55 was rerouted along new primary routing to avoid an overlap with US 64\\\\. The old route became NC 751\\\\. Between the years of 1958 and 1962, NC 55 was rerouted along the north side of Mount Olive. ===North Carolina Highway 117=== North Carolina Highway 117 (NC 117) was established in 1931 as a new primary spur from US 70/NC 10, in Jasper, to Dover. In 1932, NC 117 was extended west on new routing through Kinston and Mount Olive, before ending at NC 102, in Newton Grove. In 1934, NC 117 was decommissioned in favor of NC 55 extension. ===North Carolina Highway 302=== North Carolina Highway 302 (NC 302) was an original state highway that traversed from NC 30, in Bridgeton, east to Bayboro. In 1922, it was extended east to Oriental. In 1940, NC 302 was renumbered as NC 55\\\\. ==Major intersectionsSpecial routesFormer Holly Springs Bypass=== North Carolina Highway 55 Bypass (NC 55 By-pass) was established in 2002 as a new primary route that bypass west of Holly Springs. Usually, the old alignment would become a business loop, but instead the NC 55 mainline remained unchanged. The bypass was built as an expressway, that is semi-controlled and superstreet intersections; it also has a full interchange with NC 540. On October 3, 2019 NCDOT officially placed NC 55 on the Bypass, the route through the city was designated as SR 6107. ===Bridgeton alternate spur=== North Carolina Highway 55 Alternate (NC 55A) was established around 1950-1953 as a renumbering of a piece of mainline NC 55 in Bridgeton. It was created thanks to a new bridge carrying US 17/NC 55 over the Neuse River and a spur was needed to be made to connect each highway. Between 1958-1962, this short road was downgraded to a secondary road; today it no longer exists. ==See also== *North Carolina Bicycle Route 3 – concurrent with NC 55 from Old US 70 west of New Bern to SR 1600 east of Bridgeton *North Carolina Bicycle Route 5 – concurrent with NC 55 in Angier *North Carolina Bicycle Route 7 – concurrent with NC 55 from Old US 70 west of New Bern to Reelsboro *Hwy 55 Burgers Shakes & Fries – restaurant chain named for the highway ==ReferencesNCRoads.com: N.C. 55 * NCRoads.com: N.C. 117 055 Category:Transportation in Durham County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Wake County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Harnett County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Sampson County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Johnston County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Wayne County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Lenoir County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Craven County, North Carolina Category:Transportation in Pamlico County, North Carolina ","title":"North Carolina Highway 55"},{"id":"6198677","text":"The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society (TMS) is a professional organization for materials scientists and engineers that encompasses the entire range of materials and engineering, from minerals processing and primary metals production to basic research and the advanced applications of materials.

Medical terminology is used in the field of medicine. Medical terminology has quite regular morphology, the same prefixes and suffixes are used to add meanings to different roots. The root of a term often refers to an organ, tissue, or condition. For example, in the disorder hypertension, the prefix \\"hyper-\\" means \\"high\\" or \\"over\\", and the root word \\"tension\\" refers to pressure, so the word \\"hypertension\\" refers to abnormally high blood pressure. The roots, prefixes and suffixes are often derived from Greek or Latin, and often quite dissimilar from their English-language variants. This regular morphology means that once a reasonable number of morphemes are learnt it becomes easy to understand very precise terms assembled from these morphemes. Much medical language is anatomical terminology, concerning itself with the names of various parts of the body. ==Discussion== In forming or understanding a word root, one needs a basic comprehension of the terms and the source language. The study of the origin of words is called etymology. For example, if a word was to be formed to indicate a condition of kidneys, there are two primary roots - one from Greek (νεφρός nephr(os)) and one from Latin (ren(es)). Renal failure would be a condition of kidneys, and nephritis is also a condition, or inflammation, of the kidneys. The suffix -itis means inflammation, and the entire word conveys the meaning inflammation of the kidney. To continue using these terms, other combinations will be presented for the purpose of examples: The term supra-renal is a combination of the prefix supra- (meaning \\"above\\"), and the word root for kidney, and the entire word means \\"situated above the kidneys\\". The word \\"nephrologist\\" combines the root word for kidney to the suffix -ologist with the resultant meaning of \\"one who studies the kidneys\\". The formation of plurals should usually be done using the rules of forming the proper plural form in the source language. Greek and Latin each have differing rules to be applied when forming the plural form of the word root. Often such details can be found using a medical dictionary. == Morphology == Medical terminology often uses words created using prefixes and suffixes in Latin and Ancient Greek. In medicine, their meanings, and their etymology, are informed by the language of origin. Prefixes and suffixes, primarily in Greek—but also in Latin, have a droppable -o-. Medical roots generally go together according to language: Greek prefixes go with Greek suffixes and Latin prefixes with Latin suffixes. Although it is technically considered acceptable to create hybrid words, it is strongly preferred not to mix different lingual roots. Examples of well-accepted medical words that do mix lingual roots are neonatology and quadriplegia. Prefixes do not normally require further modification to be added to a word root because the prefix normally ends in a vowel or vowel sound, although in some cases they may assimilate slightly and an in- may change to im- or syn- to sym-. Suffixes are attached to the end of a word root to add meaning such as condition, disease process, or procedure. In the process of creating medical terminology, certain rules of language apply. These rules are part of language mechanics called linguistics. The word root is developed to include a vowel sound following the term to add a smoothing action to the sound of the word when applying a suffix. The result is the formation of a new term with a vowel attached (word root + vowel) called a combining form. In English, the most common vowel used in the formation of the combining form is the letter -o-, added to the word root. For example if there is an inflammation of the stomach and intestines, this would be written as gastro- and enter- plus -itis, gastroenteritis. Suffixes are categorized as either (1) needing the combining form, or (2) not needing the combining form since they start with a vowel. ==See also== * Classical compound * Interlingua * International scientific vocabulary * List of deprecated terms for diseases * Medical slang * Register (sociolinguistics) * Unified Medical Language System ==References== Category:Scientific terminology ","title":"Medical terminology"},{"id":"6198700","text":"The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act is a federal statute that was signed into law by U.S. President George W. Bush on July 27, 2006. The Walsh Act organizes sex offenders into three tiers according to the crime committed, and mandates that Tier 3 offenders (the most serious tier) update their whereabouts every three months with lifetime registration requirements. Tier 2 offenders must update their whereabouts every six months with 25 years of registration, and Tier 1 offenders must update their whereabouts every year with 15 years of registration. Failure to register and update information is a felony under the law. States are required to publicly disclose information of Tier 2 and Tier 3 offenders, at minimum. It also contains civil commitment provisions for sexually dangerous people. The Act also creates a national sex offender registry and instructs each state and territory to apply identical criteria for posting offender data on the internet (i.e., offender's name, address, date of birth, place of employment, photograph, etc.). The Act was named after Adam Walsh, an American boy who was abducted from a Florida shopping mall and later found murdered. As of April 2014, the Justice Department reports that 17 states, three territories and 63 tribes had substantially implemented requirements of the Adam Walsh Act. ==History== The Adam Walsh Act emerged from Congress following the passage of separate bills in the House and Senate (H.R. 3132 and S. 1086 respectively). The Act is also known as the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), the majority of the provisions of which were enacted as 42 U.S.C. §16911 et seq. The act's provisions fall into four categories: a revised sex offender registration system, child and sex related amendments to federal criminal and procedure, child protective grant programs, and other initiatives designed to prevent and punish sex offenders and those who victimize children. The sex offender registration provisions replace the Jacob Wetterling Act provisions with a statutory scheme under which states are required to modify their registration systems in accordance with federal requirements at the risk of losing 10% of their Byrne program law enforcement assistance funds.42 U.S.C. 16925 The act seeks to close gaps in the prior system, provide more information on a wider range of offenders, and make the information more readily available to the public and law enforcement officials. In the area of federal criminal law and procedure, the act enlarges the kidnapping statute, increases the number of federal capital offenses, enhances the mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment and other penalties that attend various federal sex offenses, establishes a civil commitment procedure for federal sex offenders, authorizes random searches as a condition for sex offender probation and supervised release, outlaws internet date drug trafficking, permits the victims of state crimes to participate in related federal habeas corpus proceedings, and eliminates the statute of limitations for certain sex offenses and crimes committed against children. The act revives the authorization of appropriations under the Police Athletic Youth Enrichment Act among its other grant provisions and requires the establishment of a national child abuse registry among its other child safety initiatives. The Act also establishes a post-conviction civil commitment scheme. Section 4248 of the Act contains the Commitment Provision, which authorizes the federal government to initiate commitment proceedings with respect to any federal prisoner in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.Barker, The Adam Walsh Act: Un-civil Commitment, available at https://ssrn.com/abstract=1496934 Under this provision, even prisoners who have never been previously charged with or convicted of a sex crime may be civilly committed after completing their entire prison sentence. Prior to Supreme Court Review, the federal Circuit courts were split on the question of whether Congress had the authority to enact this provision. On May 17, 2010, the Supreme Court upheld the law, and ruled in United States v. Comstock that the Civil Commitment Provision was within Congress's authority.United States v. Comstock, 551 F.3d 274 (4th Cir. 2009), cert. granted, 129 S.Ct. 2828 (U.S. June 22, 2009/Decided May 17, 2010) (No. 08-1224). At the time of passage, at least 100,000 of more than a half million sex offenders in the United States and the District of Columbia were said to be 'missing' and unregistered as required by law. The act allocated federal funding was to assist states in maintaining and improving these programs so a comprehensive system for tracking sex offenders and alerting communities would be developed. Adam Walsh, the abducted and murdered child for whom the act was named The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act was signed on the 25th anniversary of the abduction of Adam Walsh from a shopping mall in Florida; Walsh was found murdered 16 days after his abduction in 1981. Adam's father John Walsh, founder of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), was joined by other children's advocates to mount an aggressive campaign to get the bill passed into law. As part of the campaign, Walsh was joined by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, representatives from the NCMEC, and other victims' advocates and parents. These included Patty Wetterling, children's advocate from Minnesota and mother of Jacob Wetterling, who was abducted and murdered in October 1989; Mark Lunsford, whose daughter Jessica was killed in Florida in 2005; Linda Walker, the mother of North Dakota college student Dru Sjodin who was kidnapped and murdered by a released Minnesota sex offender in November 2003; and Erin Runnion, whose five-year-old daughter Samantha Runnion was raped and killed in California in 2002. In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case of United States v. Haymond, in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit had overturned a provision of the Adam Walsh Act that established a five-year mandatory minimum prison sentence, and a possible life without parole sentence, for sex offenders who, in a revocation hearing before a judge, are found by a preponderance of the evidence to have committed new sex offenses while on supervised release. On June 26, 2019, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision in United States v. Haymond that the defendant's Fifth and Sixth amendment rights to a trial by jury were violated. This shifted the burden of proof from preponderance of the evidence to beyond a reasonable doubt. ==Legal applications== *Gives the U.S. Attorney General the authority to apply the law retroactively *Gives a federal Judge the ability to civilly commit individuals who are in the custody of the federal prison system if it is proven that the individual (1) has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation; (2) suffers from a serious mental illness, abnormality, or disorder; and, (3) as a result, would have serious difficulty refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released. A hearing is available to the involuntarily committed individual every six months to reconsider their commitment status if requested by counsel or the person in the federal treatment program. *Establishes a national database which will incorporate the use of DNA evidence collection and DNA registry and tracking of convicted sex offenders with Global Positioning System technology. *The law defines and requires a three-tier classification system for sex offenders, based on offense committed, replacing the older system based on risk of re- offence. *Tier 1 sex offenders are required to register for 10–15 years; tier 2 for 25 years and tier 3 offenders must register for 25 years to life.42 USC 16915 *Increases the mandatory minimum incarceration period of 25 years for kidnapping or maiming a child and 30 years for sex with a child younger than 12 or for sexually assaulting a child between 13 and 17 years old. *Allows courts to expand definition of sex crimes requiring registration through broad residual clause. *Increases the penalties for sex trafficking of children and child prostitution. *Widens federal funding to assist local law enforcement in tracking sexual exploitation of minors on the internet. *Creates a national child abuse/neglect registry to protect children from being placed into the care of or adopted by people convicted of child abuse or child neglect. *Limits the defense access to examine child exploitation material which is the subject of a charge, such that examination may only be conducted in a government building. ==Registration requirements== Registration requirements are defined by the type of offense the person was convicted. Convictions are classified into three tiers. Tier 3 offenders register for life. Tier 2 offenders register for at least 25 years after conviction. Tier 1 offenders register for ten to fifteen years after release. Tier I registrants may be excluded from internet database, with exemption of those convicted of \\"specified offense against a minor.\\" Sex offenders that are 14 years of age or older at the time of the crime are required to register if they fit into the most serious tier (Tier 3), or were tried as adults. ==Effects== In some states the Adam Walsh Act (AWA) effectively expanded the registries as much as 500%. Since its enactment, critics have expressed concerns about the act's scope and breadth. Several sex offenders were prosecuted under its regulations before any state adopted AWA. This has resulted in one life sentence for failure to register, due to the offender being homeless and not being able to maintain a physical address. The Adam Walsh Act requires anyone convicted of a sex crime to register as a sex offender where it will be posted on the internet for all to see. A study conducted in Ohio found that retroactive AWA reclassification increased the number of offenders and altered their placement in management categories. Prior to implementation of AWA in Ohio 76% of adult and 88% of juvenile offenders were designated on the least restrictive category or did not have to register at all, while only 20% of adults and 5% of juveniles were classified as \\"sexual predators\\", the most restrictive category. Following reclassification this basic pattern was reversed, with 13% of adults and 22% of juveniles placed in Tier 1, 31% of adults and 32% of juveniles placed in Tier 2, and 55% of adults and 46% of juveniles placed in the highest and most restrictive Tier 3. 41% of adults and 43% of juveniles previously in lowest category and 59% of adults and 45% of juveniles who were not previously registered at all were assigned to Tier 3. However, the Ohio Supreme Court in 2010 ruled that the Adam Walsh Act as enacted in Ohio does not apply retroactively to individuals who committed their crimes prior to its effective date of January 1, 2008.https://www.criminallegalnews.org/news/2017/nov/28/ohios-adam-walsh-act- registration-provisions-are-not-retroactive/http://www.herald- dispatch.com/news/recent_news/ruling-ohio-sex-offender-law-not- retroactive/article_1eaffe42-729c-5862-8da6-244b9f82fc9c.html ==Influence on visa process== A collateral effect of the new legislation was its implications on the United States Permanent Resident Card process. Until January 2007, U.S. nationals living abroad who married a local and intended to obtain green cards for their spouse and any immediate family members were able to initiate and complete the majority of the application process at the local U.S. Embassy/Consulate. However, because of the newly enhanced background check and criminal history data trail requirements, the new law had initially been interpreted by the Bureau of Consular Affairs and USCIS as leaving Consular officers ill-equipped to fully handle the I-130 adjudication process. Thus, as of January 2007, I-130 petitions, supporting documentation, or fee payments could no longer be completed in the country of the foreign national. However, the government reversed this decision only two months later. Due to a significant number of complaints from applicants about the resulting processing delays and from immigration officials about the large amount of paperwork that came with the centralization of the process, the visa petitioning process for immediate relatives of US citizens was resumed at U.S. embassies on March 21, 2007. However, all embassies were required to add a 6-month residency requirement for the US Citizen to file an application directly. The Act also for the first time limits the rights of citizens or permanent residents to petition to immigrate their spouse or other relatives to the U.S. if the petitioner has a listed child sex abuse conviction. If that is the case, then the petition cannot be approved unless the Department of Homeland Security determines in its unreviewable discretion that there is no risk of harm to the beneficiary or derivative beneficiary.

One common version is the Welsh triple harp (Welsh: telyn deires), used today mainly among players of traditional Welsh folk music. == Italian arpa tripla == The triple harp originated in 16th-century Italy. To enable chromatic playing required by late-Renaissance music, a second row of strings containing the pentatonic scale (the accidentals) was added in parallel to the first row, which contained the diatonic scale. These harps were called arpa doppia or double harp and allowed for fully chromatic playing for the first time in the history of the harp. Later, a second diatonic row of strings was added on the other side of the pentatonic row of strings, creating the arpa tripla or triple harp. Double and triple harps continued to be the norm throughout the Baroque era in Italy, Spain, and France and were employed both as solo and continuo instruments. The most famous surviving example of an Italian triple harp is the Barberini harp. The instrument was built between 1605 and 1620 for the Barberini family and was played by Marco Marazzoli. It features prominently in Giovanni Lanfranco's painting Venus plays the harp. == Welsh telyn deires History=== The triple harp appeared in the British Isles early in the 17th century. In 1629, the French harpist Jean le Flelle was appointed \\"musician for the harp\\" at the court of King Charles I. Flelle played the Italian triple harp with gut strings. The triple harp was quickly adopted by the Welsh harpers living in London during the 17th century. It was so popular that by the beginning of the 18th century the triple harp became generally known as the \\"Welsh harp\\". Charles Evans was the first mentioned Welsh triple harpist. He was appointed harper to the court in 1660, where his official title was ‘His Majesty's harper for the Italian harp’. As late as the 1680s, Talbot was describing the triple harp as the English harp, and the Welsh harp he describes appears to be a large, diatonic gothic-style harp, with bray pins. A description of the Welsh triple harp is given by the harpist John Parry (Bardd Alaw) (1776–1851) in the preface to the second volume of his collection, The Welsh Harper (London 1839): The compass of the triple harp is about five octaves, or thirty-seven strings in the principal row, which is on the side played by the right hand, called the bass row. The middle row, which produces the flats and sharps, consists of thirty-four strings; and the treble, or left hand row, numbers twenty-seven strings. The outside rows are tuned in unison, and always in the diatonic scale, that is, in the regular and natural scale of tones and semitones, as a peal of eight bells is tuned. When it is necessary to change the key, for instance, from C to G, all the F's in the outside rows are made sharp by raising them half a tone. Again, to change from C to F, every B in the outside rows is made flat, by lowering them by a semitone. When an accidental sharp or flat is required, the performer inserts a finger between two of the outer strings, and finds it in the middle row. Many experiments have been made, with a view of obviating the necessity of tuning the instrument every time a change in the key occurred. Brass rings were fixed near the comb, but those rattled and jarred. Every attempt failed until the invention of the pedal harp. Mr. Roberts of Newtown, Powys playing a triple harp, The skill of harp making in Wales had all but been lost for some 60 years until John Weston Thomas (MBE), a talented wood and metal worker, revived the craft, making Celtic, chromatic and triple harps until his death in 1992. A memorial prize, \\"Tlws Coffa John Weston Thomas\\" was subsequently instigated at the National Eisteddfod, to encourage competition in the traditional folk style. He passed on his skills to three apprentices: Allan Shiers, Brian Blackmore and Alun Thomas, his son. Alun still makes triple and Celtic harps in his workshop in Fishguard. Brian Blackmore no longer makes triple harps, but Allan Shiers has continued the tradition in Wales and founded Teifi Harps in Llandysul, Ceredigion. ===Playing techniques=== Among the most important and characteristic playing techniques for the Welsh triple harp is that of unisons or \\"Split doubling\\". The effect of unisons is obtained by playing the same note on both the outside rows using the right and left hands in rapid succession. Thus a progression of e.g., C-D-F-E, is achieved by playing CC-DD-FF-EE. From medieval times Welsh harpists played with the harp placed on the left shoulder, contrary to continental practice. ===Modern players=== After the early 20th century, triple harps were almost completely abandoned in Wales in favour of the modern pedal harp. Preservation of the instrument and the playing style has been attributed to Nansi Richards (1888–1979), who learnt to play from Gypsy harpists in the Bala area at the turn of the century. Subsequently, Nansi Richards was the harp teacher of the brothers Dafydd and Gwyndaf Roberts. The brothers went on to become founder members of Wales' most prominent folk group, Ar Log. While both brothers are proficient triple harpists, it became customary in the Ar Log line-up for Dafydd to play triple harp (and flute), with Gwyndaf playing the knee harp and clarsach (and bass guitar). Today's leading exponent of the triple harp include Robin Huw Bowen, who was influenced by the music of Ar Log to the extent that he switched to the triple harp. Llio Rhydderch, another of Nansi Richard's pupils, has concentrated on teaching a new generation of as many young harpers as possible. A triple harp group called Rhes Ganol (Middle Row) was formed in 2000. Other triple harpists include the experienced performer and teacher Elonwy Wright, Carwyn Tywyn, a long-standing street busker, Sioned Webb and Bethan Nia. The triple harp is also played by a minority of classical harpists in Wales, including Angharad Evans, Elinor Bennett, Meinir Heulyn and Eleri Darkins. Some non-Welsh players perform on the instrument, freeing it from total connection with the Welsh repertoire, which actually consists of 'art music' variations on Welsh tunes. These players notably include Maria Christina Cleary, Cheryl Ann Fulton, Frances Kelly, Mike Parker, Robin Ward and Fiona Katie Roberts, who has worked with the BBC on some special projects including different designs for the harp and the design and manufacture of a quad harp. Modern composers have displayed an interest in the triple harp; e.g. Richard Barrett, who includes the instrument in the diverse ensemble of his massive multipartite work, Construction. ==ReferencesSources== * Bayer, C.W., The Historical Methods of the Celtic Harp: The Ancient British Small Harp, the Diaronic Welsh Bray Harp and the Irish Clairseeach.

The charity was founded in December 1987 from a trust which had operated since 1982, with the initial aim of encouraging and applauding excellence in the production of natural history films and television. The founders included Sir Peter Scott and Christopher Parsons OBE, former Head of the BBC Natural History Unit. ==Wildscreen Film Festival== The Wildscreen Festival is the world's leading international festival about nature films. It is held biennially in October in Bristol, England. The festival began in 1982. In 1994, it merged with a biennial wildlife symposium, previously held in the neighbouring city of Bath. At Wildscreen Festival wildlife filmmakers and broadcasters from different parts of the world met to view the latest productions, discuss issues of mutual interest, exchange ideas and compete for the Panda Awards. Over the years since then the festival has significantly expanded its scale and content and the charity has also enlarged its remit, including by launching Arkive, a centralised collection of films and photographs of endangered species. === Wildscreen Festival 2020 === In preparation for the 2020 edition of the festival, Wildscreen announced the launch of the newly revamped Panda Awards, the highest honour in the global wildlife and environmental film industry. The 2020 festival will also feature an Official Selection screening programme and a new award to recognise best practice in sustainable production. David Allen, multi award-winning filmmaker, was also announced as Final Jury Chair. The 2020 edition of the industry Festival takes place 19-23 October 2020 in Bristol, UK. The Official Selection screening programme will take place between 17-25 October and be open to both industry and public audiences  Panda Awards  For 2020, the Panda Awards will recognise talent in the following categories; Cinematography, Editing, Emerging Talent (in both film and photography), Music, Photo Story, Producer/Director, Production Team, Scripted Narrative, Series and Sound. There will also be a new Sustainable Production award.  Official Selection  To recognise the broad range of talent and creative storytellers, Wildscreen introduced an Official Selection competition for 2020. ==Other initiatives== A physical collection of images, footage and information was started, which went online in 2003. This resource has grown to include over 16,000 species profiles and 100,000 images and videos from over 7,500 of the world's filmmakers, photographers and scientists. Arkive also contains topic pages that focus on various conservation issues, geographical regions and biological subjects. Arkive is used by over a million people around the world each month. In May 2015 Wildscreen launched their newest initiative, Wildscreen Exchange. This conservation initiative provides conservation organisations with access to images, videos and expertise. Wildscreen Exchange contains over 28,000 images and many hours of video that are being used all over the world for campaigns, education resources, community outreach, fundraising and online. ==Management== Wildscreen is a registered charity under English law, governed by a board of 17 independent trustees, chaired by Dick Emery OBE, former CEO of UKTV. The chief executive is Richard Edwards, appointed in March 2011 to succeed Harriet Nimmo, who stepped down in January that year after 13 years with the charity, seven in the CEO role. Despite moving to South Africa, Nimmo retains a connection with the charity, in the advisory role of Wildscreen Strategic Director. For the period April 2009 – March 2010 (which was a non-festival year for the biennial Wildscreen Festival), the charity's income was declared as £1,409,722, with expenditure of £1,417,362.

Friedlander and his family remained in Germany until 1939, spending Kristallnacht hiding in the home of Christian friends in the suburbs.https://www.hmd.org.uk/resource/albert-friedlander/ - Holocaust Memorial Day Trust Official Site The family sailed to Cuba, and were on the last boat allowed to land before the MS St. Louis was sent away. The three Friedlander children: Albert, his twin Charles, and their sister Dorrit, were sent to separate foster homes in Mississippi. Their parents had to remain in Cuba until their visa numbers came up in the quota system. Eventually the family was reunited in Vicksburg. Friedlander graduated from Carr Central High School, Vicksburg in 1944 at the age of 16, and was accepted immediately by the University of Chicago. While studying at college, he was also gaining a reputation as a long-distance runner. He had been a champion in Mississippi, and was able to run the mile in 4 minutes 30 seconds. The U of C coach suggested that he try out for the 1948 Olympic team, but he decided to concentrate on his studies instead, having made up his mind to enter rabbinic school upon gaining his bachelor's degree. At the age of 18 Friedlander graduated from college and entered Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati to begin his path to the rabbinate. He was ordained with the class of 1952. While still at rabbinical school, he was part of the first group of students that took part in the National Federation of Temple Youth camps in Wisconsin, and remained committed to NFTY throughout his career. ==Career== From 1956 to 1961 he served as Rabbi for Temple B'nai B'rith, a Reform synagogue founded in 1845 and located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. During his tenure there he also served as a part-time faculty member for Wilkes College (now university). He then left for a position as advisor to Jewish students at Columbia University in New York City, where he gained a Ph.D. in theology, writing on the work of Rabbi Leo Baeck.\\\\- Amazon link to Leo Baeck book He also became very involved in the fight for civil rights, taking his students down to Memphis to march with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. In 1966, he moved with his family to London, to become the rabbi of Wembley Liberal Synagogue, and teach at the Leo Baeck College. In 1971 he was invited to follow Rabbi Harold Reinhart and serve the Westminster Synagogue in Knightsbridge, London. He remained there until his retirement, upon which he was created Rabbi Emeritus. In 1993 he was awarded the Bundesverdienstkreuz First Class (the Order of Merit) from the German government and in 2001 he became the first overseas-born Rabbi to be awarded an OBE. From 1975–1995 he was the Vice President for the World Union for Progressive Judaism. He was chairman of the British branch of the World Conference of Religions for Peace (1990–94), committed to the Three Faiths Forum, and a president of the Council of Christians and Jews. He was also a lecturer at the Leo Baeck College from 1967–71, before becoming Director of Studies 1971–1982 and then Dean from 1982–2004. Friedlander was involved in many interfaith dialogues, both nationally and internationally. He spent a particular amount of time in the land of his birth, as a guest professor at many German universities, as a speaker and teacher at the Evangelischen Kirchentage and Katholikentage; and appeared regularly in various German media. ==Personal life== In 1961, he married Evelyn Friedlander and had three children: Ariel (who also became a rabbi), Michal, and Noam.

The registered name INFITEC is an acronym of Interference Filter Technology, which was invented and patented by the founder of the company, Helmut Jorke. == Background == The INFITEC or Wavelength Multiplex Technology (WMT) is based on the fact that the visible light spectrum can be divided into different wavelength ranges using steep- edged optical filters. Some of these wavelength ranges are presented to the left eye, the others to the right eye. By an appropriate design of the transmission spectra of the filters it can be ensured that both eyes are reached by wavelengths in the red, green, and blue range of the visible light, so both eyes will see a fully colored image.H. Jorke and M. Fritz, Stereo Projection Using Interference Filters, Proc. of SPIE-IS&T; Electronic Imaging, SPIE Vol. 6055, 60550G (2006) Such multi-bandpass optical filters can currently be made only as so called interference filters. The WMT requires filters for the glasses as well as for the projectors (except laser projectors). == History  Previous history === INFITEC GmbH emerged from a research project at the former DaimlerChrysler research center in Ulm, Germany. In this project it was studied under the name of wavelength multiplex visualization system, whether a new technical approach was suitable for an improved and functionally enhanced imaging in virtual reality systems. For the resulting technology based on interference filters the brand INFITEC was registered. === Foundation === In 2003 Helmut Jorke founded his own start-up enterprise called INFITEC GmbH. The aim was the utilization and further development of the INFITEC method. The head office was located in Ulm at that time. === Cooperation with Barco N.V. === The single-projector solution with INFITEC 3D filter wheel was developed in 2004 by the Belgian company Barco. The relevant patents by Barco were purchased by INFITEC GmbH in 2010. === Cooperation with Dolby Inc. === In 2006 the WMT was licensed to the American company Dolby Laboratories, Inc. for digital cinema, and it was marketed under the name Dolby 3D. As Dolby uses different wavelength ranges than INFITEC, Dolby glasses are not compatible with projectors equipped with INFITEC filters, and vice versa. === New filter generation === In 2011 INFITEC introduced a new generation of filters under the designation Excellence in 3D. By a new design of the transmission bands of the filters a balanced color impression for both eyes is achieved.Simon, Arnold and Jorke, Helmut, 25.1: Interference Filter System for High-Brightness and Natural-Color Stereoscopic Imaging, SID Symposium Digest of Technical Papers, 42, p. 317 - 319, (2011)H. Jorke and A. Simon, New high efficiency interference filter characteristics for stereoscopic imaging, Proc. SPIE 8288, Stereoscopic Displays and Applications XXIII, 82881D (28 February 2012) Before, an elaborate color correction was needed for both stereoscopic channels that partially required special video processors. Now, if necessary at all, the simple color adjustment included in many projectors is sufficient. == Operating establishments == In 2010 the production of 3D glasses as well as the administration was relocated from Ulm to Gerstetten (District of Heidenheim, Baden-Württemberg, Germany). Since 2013 INFITEC GmbH runs a sales office in the United States. In 2014 INFITEC GmbH acquired a 50% share of VisionOptics GmbH in Chemnitz (Saxony, Germany). The headquarters, the sales department, and the research and development department of INFITEC GmbH moved from Ulm to Gerstetten in 2015. Global-offices include Russia, China, and USA. == Business activity == INFITEC GmbH develops, manufactures and markets interference filters for 3D projection technology and glasses fitted with these filters. In some cases the retrofitting of filters to projectors is done as well. INFITEC GmbH is internationally active regarding purchase and sales. The INFITEC GmbH holds all patents and licensing rights (aside from the cinema market held by Dolby Inc.) from simulation in industry and research institutes, planetariums and museums, to large venue events, theme parks, and home cinema solutions. == References  External links == *Infitec homepage *A description of the Infitec system at stereoscopy.com *Dolby 3D Digital Cinema Video Technology Blog Category:Stereoscopy Category:3D cinema Category:Technology companies of Germany Category:Companies based in Baden-Württemberg ","title":"Infitec"},{"id":"6198778","text":"The Journal of Electronic Materials is a monthly peer-reviewed scientific journal that publishes studies, research, developments, and applications of materials that produce electronics.

Once nearly forgotten, many of his songs and tunes remain popular today. He was murdered in Auschwitz III Monowitz concentration camp. == Life == Löhner-Beda was born Bedřich Löwy in Wildenschwert, Bohemia (present-day Ústí nad Orlicí, Czech Republic) in 1883. In 1888, his family moved to Vienna, and in 1896 changed their surname to the less Jewish surname Löhner. Having passed his Matura exams, he began the study of law at the University of Vienna, where he became a member of the Jewish Kadimah student association. After he had obtained his doctorate, he worked as a lawyer from 1908 onwards. A dedicated football player, he was among the founders of the Hakoah Vienna sports club in 1909. In 1910, Löhner-Beda decided upon a career as an author. He wrote numerous light satires, sketches, poems, and lyrics but also contributed to several newspapers, often under the pen name \\"Beda\\", a shortened version of his Czech first name, Bedřich (Frederick). In 1913, he met Franz Lehár, for whom he wrote the libretto of the 1916 operetta Der Sterngucker (The Stargazer). Two years later, in 1918, Löhner-Beda was called up for military service in World War I, which he left as an officer and a convinced antimilitarist. In the 1920s, Löhner-Beda became one of the most sought-after librettists and lyricists in Vienna. Together with Lehár as composer, as co-author, and Richard Tauber as singer, Löhner- Beda produced the operettas Friederike (Frederica, 1928), Das Land des Lächelns (The Land of Smiles, 1929), and, with as co-author, Giuditta (1934). Together with his friend Alfred Grünwald as co-author and Paul Abraham as composer, Löhner-Beda produced Viktoria und ihr Husar (Victoria and Her Hussar, 1930), Die Blume von Hawaii (The Flower of Hawaii, 1931), and Ball im Savoy (Ball at the Savoy, 1932). On April 1, 1938, almost immediately after the Anschluss (the annexation of Austria by Nazi Germany, in mid-March 1938), Fritz Löhner-Beda was arrested and deported to the Dachau concentration camp. On September 23, 1938, he was transferred to the Buchenwald concentration camp. There, together with his fellow prisoner Hermann Leopoldi at the end of 1938, he composed the famous anthem of the concentration camp, Das Buchenwaldlied (\\"The Buchenwald Song\\"): {  :O Buchenwald, ich kann dich nicht vergessen, :weil du mein Schicksal bist. :Wer dich verließ, der kann es erst ermessen, :wie wundervoll die Freiheit ist! :O Buchenwald, wir jammern nicht und klagen, :und was auch unser Schicksal sei, :wir wollen trotzdem Ja zum Leben sagen, :denn einmal kommt der Tag, dann sind wir frei!  :O Buchenwald, I cannot forget you, :because you are my fate. :Only he who leaves you can appreciate :how wonderful freedom is! :O Buchenwald, we don’t cry and complain; :and whatever our destiny may be, :we nevertheless shall say \\"yes\\" to life: :for once the day comes, we shall be free! } The line wir wollen trotzdem Ja zum Leben sagen was adopted by the Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl for the German title of his 1946 book Man's Search for Meaning. Even though Löhner-Beda's name appeared in the Nazi Encyclopedia of Jews in Music in 1940, his songs and the Lehár operettas were still performed (but with no mention of their librettist). The circumstances surrounding Franz Lehár possibly attempting to intercede with the Nazis on Löhner-Beda's behalf are clouded. Supposedly, after World War II, Lehár denied any cognizance of Löhner-Beda's concentration-camp imprisonment, but one source states that Lehár may have tried personally to secure Hitler's guarantee of Löhner-Beda's safety.Peter Herz: \\"Der Fall Franz Lehár. Eine authentische Darlegung von Peter Herz\\". In: Die Gemeinde 24 April 1968. On October 17, 1942, Löhner-Beda was deported to the Monowitz concentration camp, near Auschwitz. The circumstances of his death are described in Raul Hilberg's The Destruction of the European Jews: during an inspection by several directors of the IG Farben syndicate around Otto Ambros, Fritz ter Meer, Carl Krauch, and Heinrich Bütefisch, the already diseased Löhner-Beda was denounced as not working hard enough, for which he was beaten to death on December 4, 1942.Dein ist mein ganzes Herz (Fritz Löhner-Beda) by Günther Schwarberg (2000) A Kapo accused of the murder in the 1968 Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial was acquitted of the charge due to lack of evidence. == Notable songs == Among the most famous songs for which he wrote the lyrics are: * \\"In der Bar zum Krokodil\\" (\\"In the crocodile bar\\"), music by Willy Engel-Berger * \\"Du schwarzer Zigeuner\\" (\\"You black gypsy\\"), tango, an adaptation of \\"Cikánka\\" by Karel Vacek * \\"Drunt' in der Lobau\\" (\\"Down there in the Lobau\\"), music by Heinrich Strecker * \\"Ausgerechnet Bananen\\" (\\"Of all things bananas\\"), an adaptation of \\"Yes!

While it is often desirable to use actual banknotes or coins in the process of testing currency handling equipment, the inherent value of the objects being used means that security procedures must be put in place during the testing period that they are used. If the testing includes destructive testing, where the currency is purposefully damaged or destroyed to see how the machinery will react, further concern will be raised about the subsequent loss in value of the objects. To remove these concerns, test money is often used in place of real currency. Test money may share some or all of the characteristics of a given currency (size, paper type, paper thickness, colouring, printing characteristics, various denominations), but it also has some form of easily identifiable, non-removable, non-mutable characteristics that differentiate it from legal tender, scrip, or counterfeit currency. For certain types of bulk cash handling equipment, the test money units may represent bundled or rolled currency.

During the rule of Hoysala Empire and Vijayanagara Empire, they served as a feudatory chiefdom. Later after the fall of the Vijayanagara empire, they ruled at times as an independent Chiefdom and at other times as a vassal of the Mysore Kingdom, Mughal Empire and Maratha Empire. Finally their territories merged into the province of Mysore under the British. ==Origin== According to historian Barry Lewis, the earliest chieftains of the kingdom were local chiefs (Dandanayakas) under the Hoysala empire, during their rule over what is today Karnataka. They later won the attention and appreciation of the Vijayanagar kings through their acts of bravery and were appointed as governors of the region.According to Barry Lewis, they were Bedar or Boyar (caste) chiefs According to historian Suryanath Kamath, the Chitradurga chiefs under the Vijayanagara empire were originally from the Davangere district in Karnataka.According to Suryanath Kamat, Timmappa Nayaka the founder of the kingdom was from Davangere in Karnataka Some Marathi records call them Kala Pyada in admiration for their fighting qualities. The Chitradurga Fort was their stronghold and the very heart of the province. ==The Nayaka clan== Timmanna Nayaka (?–1588) of Matti: A chieftain from Matti in Davangere taluk during the rule of Saluva Narasimha. He ruled areas covering Davangere district and Chitradurga district. Obanna Nayaka I (1588–1602) is also known as Madakari Nayaka I. Kasturi Rangappa Nayaka I (1602–1652) In 1602, Obanna Nayaka was succeeded by his son Kasturi Rangappa Nayaka. He was a brave soldier who defeated sultan's of Bijapur. His reign was full of conflicts with neighbouring chiefs. Several battles were fought with the Paleyagar (chief) of Basavapattana over territories such as Mayakonda, Santebennur, Holalkere, Anaji, and Jagalur, all of which ultimately became part of the Chitradurga territory. At the time of his death in 1652, the kingdoms possessions yielded a revenue of 65,000 Durgi Pagodas. Madakari Nayaka II (1652–1674) Rangappa Nayaka was succeeded by his son Madakari Nayaka II in 1652 who is credited with a number of military successes, particularly in the regions east of Chitradurga. He killed Shah Adib Allah in 1671 in a battle at Chitradurga. Obanna Nayaka II (1674–1675) His rule saw civil unrest. He was killed by his own men. Shoora Kantha Nayaka (1675–1676) His rule saw civil unrest. He was killed by his own men. Chikkanna Nayaka (1676–1686) Madakari Nayaka III (1686–1688) Donne Rangappa Nayaka (1688–1689) Bharamanna Nayaka of Bilichodu (1689–1721) known as the last of the great Nayakas of Chitradurga, he became a Maratha ally and fought in the battle of Dodderi in 1695 but had to pay tribute later to the Mughals for supporting the Marathas. He fought many pitched battles against the Mughals, and is credited for building many temples including the Ranganatha Swamy at Niratadi, and irrigation tanks. He was also known as \\"Bichchugatti Bahramanna Nayaka\\" Madakari Nayaka IV (1721–1748) was a Maratha feudatory. He was killed during continued hostilities against the Nayakas of Davangere. Kasturi Rangappa Nayaka II (1748–1758), son of Kasturi Rangappa Nayaka II, retook Mayakonda territory. He achieved this with the help of the Maratha Sardar Murari Rao and the Subedar of Advani. Kasturi Rangappa Nayaka is said to have made various expeditions to the north and south, and in the latter direction gained some possessions in the Budihal region. He is also said to have maintained close ties with the Subedar of Sira. He died in 1754 without an heir. Madakeri Nayaka the last, son of one Bharamappa Nayaka of Janakal-Durga, became his successor. Madakari Nayaka (1758–1779) was a brave soldier and a shrewd administrator as well (also called as Madakari Nayaka V). He allied himself with Haider Ali of the Mysore Kingdom at times and at other times with the Marathas. It was during his time that Haider Ali attacked the Chitradurga Fort leading to the heroics of \\"Onake Obavva\\". Later having been betrayed by the Marathas and some local officers, Madakari Nayaka was defeated by Hyder Ali, taken prisoner and killed. The Chitradurga Nayakas form an integral part of Kannada folklore. ==NotesReferences== *History of Nayakas of Chitradurga, Barry Lewis, Dept of Anthropology, University of Illinois *Dr. Suryanath U.

It is mainly used to suppress the racemization of single-enantiomer chiral molecules and to improve the efficiency of peptide synthesis. ==Use in peptide synthesis== 500x500px Automated peptide synthesis involves the condensation of the amino group of protected amino acids with the activated ester. HOBt is used to produce such activated esters. These esters are insoluble (like the N-hydroxysuccinimide esters) and react with amines at ambient temperature to give amides. HOBt is also used for the synthesis of amides from carboxylic acids aside from amino acids. These substrates may not be convertible to the acyl chlorides.Andrew G. Myers, Bryant H.

It was founded in 1941 as a clandestine newspaper of the Resistance. Following the liberation, the main participants in the publication included Albert Ollivier, Jean-Paul de Dadelsen, Jean Bloch-Michel (1912–1987), and Georges Altschuler (fr). Among leading contributors were Jean-Paul Sartre, André Malraux, Emmanuel Mounier, Raymond Aron and Pierre Herbart (fr).Sylvie Courtine-Denamy, Le souci du monde. Dialogue entre Hannah Arendt et quelques-uns de ses contemporains, Vrin, 1999, p. 81 From 1943 to 1947, its editor-in-chief was Albert Camus.J. Levi-Valensi (ed), Camus at Combat Princeton University Press, 2006 Its production was directed by André Bollier until Milice repression led to his death. In August 1944, Combat took the headquarters of L'Intransigeant, 100 Rue Réaumur (fr) in Paris, while Albert Camus became its editor in chief. The newspaper's production run decreased from 185,000 copies in January 1945 to 150,000 in August of the same year: it wasn't able to rival with others established newspapers (the Communist daily L'Humanité was publishing at the time 500,000 copies). During 1946, Combat was opposed to the \\"game of the parties\\" claiming to rebuild France, and thus became closer to Charles de Gaulle without, however, becoming the official voice of his movement. Loyal to its origins, Combat tried to become the place of expression for those who believed in creating a popular non-Communist Left movement in France. In July 1948 (more than a year after the May 1947 crisis and the expulsion of the Communist Party (ministers) from the government), Victor Fay (de), a Marxist activist, took over Combat 's direction, but he failed to stop the newspaper's evolution towards more popular subjects and less political information. In 1950, it hosted a debate about the Notre-Dame Affair stimulated by a vehement letter by André Breton in response to the editor Louis Pauwels.Myriam Boucharenc (2005) L'universel reportage, pp. 94-6 Philippe Tesson (fr) became editor in chief from 1960 to 1974. Henri Smadja (fr) had thought Tesson could be a perfect puppet-editor but Smadja's situation, in part because of the Tunisian regime, got worse. In March 1974, Philippe Tesson created Le Quotidien de Paris (1974–1996), which he had conceived as the successor of Combat. During the May 1968 crisis, Combat supported the student movement although from a Stalinist point of view, through the signatures of the likes of Jacques-Arnaud Penent (fr). On 3 June, it published a falsified version of the Address to All Workers by the Council for Maintaining the Occupations, removing the references to the Situationist International and the attacks against the Stalinists. Henri Smadja committed suicide on 14 July 1974, and Combat definitively ceased to be published the following month. ==See also== *France in the twentieth century *Fourth Republic (1946–1958) ==References External links == * Combat issues (1941–1944 only) online in Gallica, the digital library of the BnF * Albert Camus' editorial on 8 August 1945 concerning the Hiroshima bombing Category:1974 disestablishments in France Category:Publications disestablished in 1974 Category:Defunct newspapers published in France Category:French resistance publications Category:Contemporary French history Category:Underground press in World War II Category:Daily newspapers published in France ","title":"Combat (newspaper)"},{"id":"6198870","text":"Lowden is a name that originates in Scotland, where it is a Scottish variant of the geographic name Lothian.

Its priority was the completion of audio-visual profiles for the c. 17,000 species on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The project was an initiative of Wildscreen, a UK-registered educational charity, based in Bristol. The technical platform was created by Hewlett-Packard, as part of the HP Labs' Digital Media Systems research programme. ARKive had the backing of leading conservation organisations, including BirdLife International, Conservation International, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the United Nations' World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), as well as leading academic and research institutions, such as the Natural History Museum; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; and the Smithsonian Institution. It was a member of the Institutional Council of the Encyclopedia of Life. Two ARKive layers for Google Earth, featuring endangered species and species in the Gulf of Mexico were produced by Google Earth Outreach. The first of these was launched in April 2008 by Wildscreen's Patron, Sir David Attenborough. The website closed on 15 February 2019; its collection of images and videos remains securely stored for future generations. ==History== Sir David Attenborough and the ARKive The project formally was launched on 20 May 2003 by its patron, the UK-based natural history presenter, Sir David Attenborough, a long-standing colleague and friend of its chief instigator, the late Christopher Parsons, a former Head of the BBC Natural History Unit. Parsons never lived to see the fruition of the project, succumbing to cancer in November 2002 at the age of 70. Parsons identified a need to provide a centralised safe haven for wildlife films and photographs after discovering that many such records are held in scattered, non-indexed, collections, often with little or no public access, and sometimes in conditions that could lead to loss or damage. He believed the records could be a powerful force in building environmental awareness by bringing scientific names to life. He also saw their preservation as an important educational resource and conservation tool, not least because extinction rates and habitat destruction could mean that images and sounds might be the only legacy of some species’ existence. His vision of a permanent, accessible, refuge for audio-visual wildlife material won almost immediate support from many of the world's major broadcasters, including the BBC, Granada, international state broadcasting corporations and National Geographic magazine; leading film and photographic libraries, international conservation organisations and academic institutes such as Cornell University. The initial feasibility study for creating ARKive was carried out in the late 1980s by conservationist John Burton, but at the time the costs of the technology needed were too far too high, and so it was over a decade later, after the technology had caught up with Christopher Parson's vision (and the costs dropped), that the project was able to get off the ground. After capital development funds of £2m were secured from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 1997 and New Opportunities Fund in 2000, work on building ARKive began as part of the UK's Millennium celebrations, using advanced computerised storage and retrieval technology devised for the project by Hewlett-Packard, with an initial capacity of up to 74 terabytes of data, using redundant hardware and multiple copies of media stored at multiple sites. Media was digitised to the highest available quality without compression and encoded to open standards. A prototype site was online as early as April 1999. There were several design iterations before the formal launch. By the launch date, the project team had researched, catalogued, copied, described and authenticated image, sound and fact files of 1,000 animals, plants and fungi, many of them critically endangered. More multi- media profiles are added every month, starting with British flora and fauna and with species included on the Red List – that is, species that are believed to be closest to extinction, according to research by the World Conservation Union. By January 2006, the database had grown to 2,000 species, 15,000 still images and more than 50 hours of video. By 2010, over 5,500 donors had contributed 70,000 film clips and photos of more than 12,000 species. In February 2019, Wildscreen announced that they \\"...have had to make the very hard decision to close the Arkive website on 15 February 2019\\", due to funding issues. On that date the website was replaced with a short statement, concluding: == Recognition == The site was Sunday Times website of the year for 2005.

This is just one of the many dialects used by the remnant population of formerly Tamil speaking people of the western Puttalam District and Gampaha District of Sri Lanka. Those who still identify them as ethnic Tamils are known as Negombo Tamils or as Puttalam Tamils. Although most residents of these districts identify them as ethnic Sinhalese some are bilingual in both the languages.Contact-Induced Morphosyntactic Realignment in Negombo Fishermen’s Tamil By Bonta Stevens, South Asian Language Analysis Roundtable XXIII (October 12, 2003) The University of Texas at Austin South Negombo fishermen's Tamil: A case of contact-induced language change from Sri Lanka by Bonta Stevens , Cornell University ==Morphology== The specific dialect known as Negombo Fisherman’s Tamil (NFT) spoken by the Karava or Karaiyar caste fishers of Negombo. NFT has many distinctive traits, some of which may have arisen as a consequence of contact with Sinhala. It is also proposed that it may have undergone considerable morphosyntactic convergence with spoken or colloquial Sinhala (CS), as a consequence of contact with it. For example, NFT has mostly lost Tamil verb agreement morphology for person and number. Colloquial Sinhala (unlike Literary Sinhala) has a single verb form for all persons, singular and plural. Most Tamil dialects, by contrast, retain in both the spoken and the written languages a well-developed system of person and number verb agreement morphology. Thus in NFT we have, with Jaffna Tamil dialect (JT) which a major dialect of the Sri Lankan Tamils ethnic group for comparison: *a. naan kolumbu-kki poo-ra (NFT) I Colombo go (I go to Colombo) *b. naan kolumbu-kku poo-r-een (JT) I Colombo going (I am going to Colombo) *c. mamə koləmbə-Tə yanəwa (CS) I Colombo go (I go to Colombo) NFT has also developed a number of other grammatical traits under the probable influence of Sinhala, including a postposed indefinite article, an indefinitizing postclitic –sari (apparently modeled on Sinhala –hari), and case assignments for defective verbs that follow the Sinhala, rather than Tamil, patterns of agreement. ==Unique dialect== NFT probably originated in India, but has subsequently adopted, and is still adopting, Sri Lankan Tamil traits. The dialect is spoken by perhaps as many as 50,000 people, is thus a very distinctive dialect. With Karnataka based Saraswat Konkani (Nadkarni 1975), Tamil Nadu based Saurashtri (Smith 1978), Sri Lankan Creole Portuguese and the Urdu, Marathi, and Kannada dialects of Kupwar (Gumperz and Wilson 1971), NFT grammar is the outcome of pervasive structural realignment as a result of stable bilingualism. ==References Further reading == Steven Bonta Negombo Fishermen's Tamil (NFT): A Sinhala Influenced Dialect from a Bilingual Sri Lankan Community INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRAVIDIAN LINGUISTICS XXXVII (2) pp133–140.

The network is fully signposted. As well as this, three circular pipe tunnels were constructed near Etton village in order to allow the Green Wheel route to pass underneath the A15. The project also encourages recreational use and has created a sculpture trail, which provides functional, landscape artworks along the Green Wheel route and a ‘Living Landmarks’ project involving the local community in the creation of local landscape features such as mini woodlands, ponds and hedgerows.

We all went out on > the ice and Al Smith took all of the warm-ups. Then I was sitting next to > him in the locker room right before game time and said 'Good luck tonight.' > He looked at me and said 'You don't know you're playing?'\\" \\"That sort of > ended the conversation right there. I was dumbfounded. So they play the > anthem and when it ends Al hops off the bench, skates about five strides and > says 'See you, Seymour' to Sabres owner Seymour Knox in the crowd. Then he > skates off the ice. Also referred to by Sabre fans as \\"Sayonara\\" So it's my > first game in the NHL and I was the only goalie in uniform.\\" In 1978, Edwards was named the top goalie for the Sabres. He played in 72 games and was selected to the NHL Second All-Star Team. Next season, the Sabres cut Edwards' games down because they were afraid of overusing him. Edwards shared his duties with goaltender Bob Sauve and Edwards finished with 26-18-9 record. In 1980, he and Sauve were awarded the Vezina Trophy for their performance. Edwards was also selected to the NHL Second All-Star Team and played in the All-Star Game. On February 24, 1982, Edwards was a part of history as he gave up Wayne Gretzky's 77th goal in a game vs. the Edmonton Oilers at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. With that goal, Wayne Gretzky broke Phil Esposito's record of 76 goals. Edwards played two more seasons with the Sabres before being traded to the Calgary Flames with teammate Richie Dunn in 1983. In three years in Calgary, Edwards did not reach the same level of play as he had during his time in Buffalo. Calgary traded Edwards in 1986 to the Toronto Maple Leafs, his favorite team as a child. Edwards played in 38 games with the Leafs before the remaining 2 years of his contract were bought out, marking the end of his NHL career. He went on to win an Allan Cup with the Brantford Mott's Clammatos before playing his last game with the Nova Scotia Oilers in the AHL in 1988 where he would officially retire. ===International play=== Although Edwards enjoyed several successful seasons in Buffalo, he named the Sabres' 6-1 victory over the Soviet Red Army on January 3, 1980 as his greatest moment in a Buffalo uniform. Edwards was named the game's most valuable player. > \\"I have this belief that hockey is a North American game, and I still > believe that today. The Soviets were great intimidators, and I remember Team > Canada '72. Then I had the chance to personally go through that intimidation > stuff on the ice. Because of it, I had a distinct dislike of the Soviets and > wanted to do everything I could to beat them.\\" In 1981, Edwards was selected to play for Team Canada in the Canada Cup. Edwards played in only one game because he was the back-up goaltender to Mike Liut. He helped Canada finish second in the tournament. ==Post-playing career== An outstanding golfer, Edwards spent parts of his off-seasons participating in tournaments. He also held coaching positions in the National Hockey League, serving as the Los Angeles Kings' assistant coach and the Carolina Hurricanes' goaltending coach. He was the general manager of the Saginaw Spirit of the Ontario Hockey League from 2007 to 2008.NHL.com - News Edwards worked as a broadcaster on TSN and as a real estate agent, prior to the 1991 murders of his parents.

Edwards is the son of Arnold and Donna Edwards. On March 21, 1991, Edwards' parents were murdered in their Hamilton home by George Lovie, who was briefly in a relationship with Edwards' sister, Michele.

Burkemo (October 9, 1918 - October 8, 1986) was an American professional golfer, best known for winning the PGA Championship in 1953. Born in Detroit, Michigan, Burkemo was the youngest of 13 children of Norwegian immigrants who settled there. He began in golf at the age of 8 by caddying at Lochmoor Country Club in Detroit. Burkemo won his first title in 1938 at the Southern Florida Open; however, World War II intervened soon thereafter and he found himself drafted into the U.S. Army. Burkemo served in the infantry as a sergeant in the European Theater. He was seriously wounded twice, earning two Purple Hearts, the second time during the Battle of the Bulge. Burkemo resumed his PGA Tour career after recovering from his injuries. He had little success in the late 1940s; but in 1951, his luck began to change when he won his first of four Michigan Opens. His best years in professional golf were in the early 1950s; he won the PGA Championship in 1953 and was runner-up in 1951 and 1954. Although he was one of the most consistent top-10 finishers on the tour, he would go on to win only one more event, the Mayfair Inn Open in 1957. He was a member of the Ryder Cup team in 1953. The 1953 PGA Championship was played in July at Birmingham Country Club in Birmingham, Michigan, only six miles (10 km) from the Franklin Hills Country Club where Burkemo was club pro. He benefited from a so-called \\"home field advantage\\" because during the match play era, the PGA Championship was a marathon of double rounds for five straight days. The week began with 36 holes of qualifying on Wednesday and Thursday, followed by six matches - two rounds at 18 holes each on Friday and the last four rounds at 36 holes, concluding with the final on Tuesday. He also benefited from the fact that Ben Hogan, the reigning Masters and U.S. Open champion, was in Scotland to practice and qualify for the British Open, which started the day after the PGA Championship final match. In an era without any exemptions, the British Open's mandatory 36-hole qualifier immediately preceded the competition on Monday and Tuesday, during the semifinals and finals of the PGA. (After his automobile accident in 1949, Hogan did not enter the PGA Championship until 1960, then a stroke play event.) Burkemo's toughest match en route to the final against Felice Torza was in the semifinals against 1948 Masters champion Claude Harmon. Burkemo was 3 down after 11 holes but rallied and birdied the 36th hole to win 1 up. After the 1954 season, Burkemo returned to life as a club pro because the grind of the PGA Tour was proving too difficult for him to maintain with a wife and four children. He continued to play the tour part-time for the rest of his career. He and his brother Vic opened Burkemo's driving range in St. Clair Shores. Burkemo was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame and the Michigan Golf Hall of Fame. He died in Fenton a day before his 68th birthday. ==Professional wins (8)PGA Tour wins (2)=== {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" - eee;\\" Legend - e5d1cb;\\"  Major championships (1) -  Other PGA Tour (1) } {  style=\\"font-size:95%;\\" !No.!!Date!!Tournament!!Winning score!!Margin of victory!!Runner(s)-up!!Ref -e5d1cb;\\" align=center1 Jul 7, 1953 PGA Championship align=center colspan=22 & 1  Felice Torza  - align=center2 Dec 15, 1957 Mayfair Inn Open −11 (70-65-66-68=269) 1 stroke  Jay Hebert, Porky Oliver  } ===Other wins (6)=== this list is probably incomplete *1938 Southern Florida Open *1951 Michigan Open *1955 Michigan Open, Michigan PGA Championship *1957 Michigan Open *1970 Michigan Open ==Major championshipsWins (1)=== { !Year!!Championship!!Winning score!!Runner-up - D8BFD8;\\"  1953 PGA Championship  align=center2 & 1  Felice Torza } Note: The PGA Championship was match play until 1958 ===Results timeline=== { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1937 !1938 !1939 - align=leftMasters Tournament eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" - align=leftU.S. Open CUT eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" - align=leftPGA Championship eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" } { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1940 !1941 !1942 !1943 !1944 !1945 !1946 !1947 !1948 !1949 - align=leftMasters Tournament eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\"NT eeeeee;\\"NT eeeeee;\\"NT eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" - align=leftU.S. Open eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\"NT eeeeee;\\"NT eeeeee;\\"NT eeeeee;\\"NT eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" - align=leftPGA Championship eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\"NT eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" } { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1950 !1951 !1952 !1953 !1954 !1955 !1956 !1957 !1958 !1959 - align=leftMasters Tournament eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" T42 eeeeee;\\" T22 T15 T17 CUT CUT T22 - align=leftU.S. Open T36 CUT eeeeee;\\" T40 CUT CUT T29 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T4 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T5 WD - align=leftPGA Championship eeeeee;\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"2 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"R16 style=\\"background:lime;\\"1 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"2 R64 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"R16 style=\\"background:yellow;\\"3 T16 T17 } { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1960 !1961 !1962 !1963 !1964 !1965 !1966 !1967 !1968 !1969 - align=leftMasters Tournament style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T6 T11 CUT T43 CUT eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" - align=leftU.S. Open T49 CUT eeeeee;\\" style=\\"background:yellow;\\"T8 CUT eeeeee;\\" T22 eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" - align=leftPGA Championship T24 14 T39 CUT T17 T41 CUT CUT CUT eeeeee;\\" } { cellpadding=\\"3\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" border=\\"1\\" style=\\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\\" - eeeeee;\\" !align=\\"left\\"Tournament !1970 !1971 - align=leftMasters Tournament eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" - align=leftU.S. Open eeeeee;\\" eeeeee;\\" - align=leftPGA Championship CUT CUT } Note: Burkemo never played in The Open Championship WD = withdrew CUT = missed the half-way cut R64, R32, R16, QF, SF = Round in which player lost in PGA Championship match play \\"T\\" indicates a tie for a place ===Summary=== { class= style=text- align:center !Tournament !!

The objective is usually to keep a directional wellbore within a hydrocarbon pay zone defined in terms of its resistivity, density or even biostratigraphy. In mature areas, geosteering may be used to keep a wellbore in a particular section of a reservoir to minimize gas or water breakthrough and maximize economic production from the well. In the process of drilling a borehole, geosteering is the act of adjusting the borehole position (inclination and azimuth angles) on the fly to reach one or more geological targets. These changes are based on geological information gathered while drilling. Originally only a projected target would be aimed for with crude directional tools. Now the advent of rotary steerable tools and an ever-increasing arsenal of geophysical tools enables well placement with ever- increasing accuracy. Typically a basic tool configuration will have directional and inclination sensors, along with a gamma ray tool. Other options are neutron density, look ahead seismic, downhole pressure readings et al. Due to the vast volume of data generated, especially by imaging tools, the data transmitted to surface is a carefully selected fraction of what is available. Data is collected in memory for a data dump when back on surface with the tool. ==History== Geosteering only practically became possible with the advent of deep reading 2 MHz resistivity LWD tools from the major LWD vendors (BakerHughes Reservoir Navigation Tool, SperrySun and Schlumberger) and other tools in the early 1990s, and the forward modeling software from a number of vendors capable of predicting resistivity tool responses for different relative angles and formation resistivities. Prior to this, Gamma ray gave some bed information, but was rarely used to dynamically adjust the well path in relation to the best oil saturation and porosity. The advent of nuclear tools for porosity and azimuthally sensitive gamma and resistivity tools, improved the ability to infer whether the wellbore should be steered up or down. The development of the Troll Oilfield by Norsk Hydro (Later Statoil and Equinor) would not have been possible without the ability to precisely geosteer within a 4-meter thick horizon to avoid gas above and water below. ==Description== From 2D and 3D models of underground substructures, deviated wells (2D and 3D) are planned in advance to achieve specific goals: exploration, fluids production, fluids injection or technical. A well plan is a continuous succession of straight and curved lines representing the geometrical figure of the expected well path. A well plan is always projected on vertical and horizontal maps. While the borehole is being drilled according to the well plan, new geological information is gathered from mud logging, measurement while drilling (MWD) and logging while drilling (LWD). These usually show some differences from what is expected from the model. As the model is continuously updated with the new geological information (formation evaluation) and the borehole position (well deviation survey), changes start to appear in the geological substructures and can lead to the well plan being updated to reach the corrected geological targets. The following data can be used for the geosteering: MWD, LWD, Image logs, 2D and 3D seismic data, geological models. ==See also== *Oil well *Directional drilling *Well logging *Deviation survey == References == Category:Drilling technology Category:Petroleum production Category:Boreholes ","title":"Geosteering"},{"id":"6198996","text":"In electronics, steady state is an equilibrium condition of a circuit or network that occurs as the effects of transients are no longer important. Steady state is reached (attained) after transient (initial, oscillating or turbulent) state has subsided. During steady state, a system is in relative stability. Steady state determination is an important topic, because many design specifications of electronic systems are given in terms of the steady- state characteristics. Periodic steady-state solution is also a prerequisite for small signal dynamic modeling. Steady-state analysis is therefore an indispensable component of the design process. ==Calculation methods== Steady state calculation methods can be sorted into time-domain algorithms (time domain sensitivities, shooting) and frequency-domain algorithms (harmonic balance) methods, are the best choice for most microwave circuits excited with sinusoidal signals (e.g. mixers, power amplifiers). ===Time domain methods=== Time domain methods can be further divided into one step methods (time domain sensitivities) and iterative methods (shooting methods). One step methods require derivatives to compute the steady state; whenever those are not readily available at hand, iterative methods come into focus. ==See also== * Frequency response * Stiff circuits * Harmonic balance * Time domain sensitivities * Shooting method * Transient response ==Further reading== * Jan Ogrodsky - Circuit Simulation and Algorithms.

There was a station of the same name on the now-defunct Tamsui railway line, however the position was different; the TRA station was further south. ==Station overview== Station platform Exit 2 of Jiantan station The two-level, elevated station structure with one island platform and two side exits. The washrooms are inside the entrance area. Notable landmarks are National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine, Jiantan Park and Ming Chuan University. This station is well known for its architecture, which is based on a dragon boat. The station is also next to the Shilin Night Market and experiences heavy traffic during the evening hours. Due to its unique dragon boat architecture, it was awarded the 19th Annual Taiwan Architecture Award in 1997. ==History== The station was originally opened on 17 August 1915 as . It was for passengers looking to visit Taiwan Grand Shrine on Jiantan Mountain. The shrine no longer exits; its former location is where the Grand Hotel currently stands. After the war, it was renamed Jiantan station and then closed in the 1950s. The station location was where the Jiantan Youth Activity Center currently stands. The Taipei Metro station was originally going to be constructed as two stations: one at the old TRA station location (R18) and another one called Mingchuan Station (R19). However, residents around the proposed Mingchuan Station opposed the plan. Thus, a station was constructed at the midpoint of the two proposed stations (hence the current station number R18A), and was opened on 28 March 1997. ==Station layout== {table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 - style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=50 rowspan=3 valign=top2F style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100Platform 1 style=\\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\\" width=390← Tamsui–Xinyi Line toward Tamsui / Beitou (R16 Shilin) - style=\\"border-top:solid 2px black;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\\" colspan=2Island platform, doors will open on the left - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"Platform 2 style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\"→ Tamsui–Xinyi Line toward Xiangshan / Daan (R14 Yuanshan) → - style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=50Street Level style=\\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=100Concourse style=\\"border- bottom:solid 1px gray;\\" width=440Entrance/Exit, lobby, information desk, automatic ticket dispensing machines, one-way faregates Restrooms } == First and Last Train Timing == The first and last train timing at Jiantan station is as follows: {  ! rowspan=\\"2\\" Destination ! colspan=\\"2\\" First Train !Last Train - !Mon − Fri !Sat − Sun and P.H. !Daily - ! colspan=\\"4\\"  - !R28 Tamsui    - !R02 Xiangshan    } ==References== Category:1997 establishments in Taiwan Category:Tamsui–Xinyi line stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1915 Category:Railway stations opened in 1997 ","title":"Jiantan metro station"},{"id":"6199035","text":"The whaling foreman is in Faroese known as a grindaformaður.

It was produced and directed by Hal Seeger. ==Overview== The series starred Milton the Monster, a Frankenstein-looking monster with a flat-topped, seemingly hollow head which emitted various quantities of white steam or smoke based on his mood or situation. He was created by mad scientist Professor Montgomery Weirdo and his assistant Count Kook, who lived in a haunted house on Horror Hill. Milton is a smiling, good-natured fellow, thanks to the Professor having used too much \\"tincture of tenderness\\" as explained in the opening theme of each individual Milton the Monster segment. Milton was created not of individual body parts, but rather in a mold from such liquids as \\"essence of terror\\" and \\"sinister sauce.\\" Out of fear of his creation destroying him, Professor Weirdo intended to add just a touch of the aforementioned tincture of tenderness to the mold, but Count Kook bumped the Professor's elbow, resulting in too much of the tincture being added to the mix. Milton's voice, which was based on the southern accent used by Jim Nabors in his television role as Gomer Pyle,Hollis, T. (2008). Ain't That a Knee- Slapper: Rural Comedy in the Twentieth Century. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. p. 192. . was provided by Bob McFadden who also provided voices for Professor Weirdo's resident monsters: *Heebie - a skull-faced, top hat- wearing ghoul with a Peter Lorre voice *Jeebie - a slow-witted, cyclopian, hairy green creature with a single sharp tooth that was often used to open soda cans Professor Weirdo's nemesis was Professor Fruitcake, another mad scientist who lived in a castle on an opposite hill. Professor Fruitcake's major creation was Zelda the Zombie. Other characters in the series included Fangenstein, a biker monster apparently inspired by Marlon Brando, his sidekick Abercrombie Zombie, and Professor Weirdo's aunt, the witchy Aunt Hagatha. ==Other features== Other features on the show included: * Fearless Fly, starring an insect super-hero similar to Hanna-Barbera's Atom Ant. One of the most popular segments of the Milton the Monster Show, Fearless Fly was, in reality, Hiram, an ordinary housefly. When danger threatens, he ducks into a nearby matchbox, dons a red sweater and, in a reversal of Clark Kent, changes into the superhero Fearless Fly by putting on a pair of super high-powered glasses. FF, according to the opening, is more powerful than a speeding rocket and faster than a beam of light. No flypaper can hold him and no insecticide can stop him. Fearless Fly's sole weakness is losing his glasses, which happens in most of the episodes. His chief nemesis is the 900-year-old Fu Manchu-inspired Dr. Goo Fee and his sidekick Gung Ho. Occasionally, Milton the Monster's Professor Weirdo makes an appearance to threaten Fearless Fly. Usually, [Bob McFadden] does all the voices, such as the seductive Lady Deflayah. * Flukey Luke, with a cowboy detective and his Irish-accented Native American companion Two Feathers. Flukey Luke was so named because of his dumb luck that allowed him to get the upper hand despite being incredibly inept. * Stuffy Durma, starring a nouveau-riche hobo who resisted the attempts of valet Bradley Brinkley to get some culture and breeding. * Muggy-Doo, featuring a sly boy fox who often gets into trouble with his get-rich-quick schemes. * Penny Penguin, starring a bratty aquatic bird. ==Voice cast== Principal characters and voices: * Bob McFadden: Milton the Monster * Dayton Allen: Professor Weirdo, Fearless Fly, Flukey Luke, Stuffy Durma, Bradley Brinkley, Chester Penguin * Larry Best: Count Kook, Muggy Doo, Two Feathers * Beverly Arnold: Penny Penguin, Flora Fly * Hettie Galen: Beulah Penguin ==Episode list== Episode 1 *Fearless Fly: Trick or Treatment *Flukey Luke: Loot Pursuit *Milton the Monster: Zelda the Zombie Episode 2 *Fearless Fly: Horse Shoo Fly *Muggy Doo: Gogh Van Gogh *Milton the Monster: Boy Meet Ghoul Episode 3 *Fearless Fly: Fatty Karate *Muggy Doo: You Auto Be in Pictures *Milton the Monster: Monsters for Hire Episode 4 *Fearless Fly: Captain Fligh *Muggy Doo: Doo Or Die *Milton the Monster: Who Do Voodoo?

It was produced by Nihon Ad Systems and Production I.G., and directed by Takayuki Hamana. The movie premiere aired after another short film spun off from the series titled . == Plot == The Seishun Academy Middle School tennis regulars are invited on a cruise by Sakurafubuki Hikomaro to play a match with his own tennis team. Aboard the cruise ship, Ryoga Echizen introduces himself to the team as Ryoma's older brother. Ryoma reveals that Ryoga was adopted by Nanjiroh many years ago, when they lived in America, but mysteriously left home prior to Ryoma enrolling in Seigaku. That evening, after a banquet dinner, Takashi Kawamura, being a sushi chef, remarks that the food did not taste as expensive as it looked. In the bathroom, Sadaharu Inui discovers that the marble on the wall is fake when he tears off a piece of wallpaper. It becomes clear that something is not right. The next day, Sakurafubuki reveals to Tezuka and Oishi that they are actually part of an illegal gambling plot. If they purposely lose their matches the next day, Sakurafubuki will rake in a lot of money from people that have betted on Seigaku winning. But, should they choose not listen and win the matches, the team faces the grim possibility of losing their lives. It turns out that everyone on the ship are either gamblers or Sakurafubuki's henchmen, so therefore, Seigaku can only trust themselves. The team tries to form a plan of action while playing the matches as directed, but they are ultimately held hostage by Sakurafubuki's chef when Kikumaru Eiji is caught eavesdropping. Only Tezuka, Fuji, and Echizen are allowed to leave to play their matches. Tezuka and Fuji win their matches easily. Upon seeing Ryoma's performance, Ryoga decides to betray Sakurafubuki in order to play a match against his brother to see who's the better player. Meanwhile, the rest of the team escape from the room where the chef held them hostage (thanks to Inui's clever usage of his Juice), and then are forced to engage in a rather humorous run from the corrupt crew members. In the end, they are recaptured and bound by Sakurafubuki, who holds them at gunpoint. Ryoma realizes that his teammates' lives are going to be at risk if he continues to play against his brother. Ryoga decides that he will not be Sakurafubuki's pawn any longer, and fires a tennis ball straight into his forehead. This allows the rest of the team to escape once again. As Ryoma and Ryoga's match continues, a terrible storm brews, forcing everyone on the ship to evacuate through the lifeboats. Seigaku keeps order throughout the panic and helps the passengers, although Momoshiro and Eiji end up falling overboard. The Echizen brothers, however, keep playing their match, even as an enormous tidal wave descends upon the cruise ship. They seem unfazed as they play their match underwater. In the end, Ryoma comes out as the victor when the ball drops onto Ryoga's side of the net, despite that the net is gone and a large light has crashed across the court. Ryoga accepts his defeat and remarks that Ryoma's tennis certainly has improved. The two escape via Ryoga's jet ski, and Ryoma is reunited with his team, who have all escaped the ship unharmed. Ryoga takes Ryoma's hat and gives him an orange and tells him to find his \\"Grand Dream\\". After that, he rides his jet ski into the sunset. Atobe Keigo then arrives at the scene by helicopter to rescue the Seigaku regulars and witnesses Sakurafubuki being arrested. In an earlier phone conversation he had with Oshitari Yuushi, who also appeared along Gakuto Mukahi, the two conversed about how Seigaku had been invited aboard a free cruise. Atobe remarked how he knew all luxury cruise line owners, but never heard of Sakurafubuki, and thus suspected that Seigaku had been caught up in a scam. == Characters Ryoga Echizen=== is the antagonist turned protagonist in the film. Ryoga is the adopted son of Nanjiro Echizen, a former professional tennis player. He bears a strong resemblance to Ryoma with his hazel eyes and black-green hair. While the Echizen family were in America, Ryoga was taken in by Nanjiro and lived with them for a time. His tennis technique is modeled on that of Nanjiro. When he left the Echizen's home, he was hired by the billionaire Sakurafubuki Hikomaro to play tennis for him in his gambling schemes. In the flashbacks, it showed that he was rather close to Ryoma. At first he said that Ryoma's tennis was awful (which was true when he was about five or so). It was shown that Ryoga's skills were far superior, but as Ryoma continued to improve, Ryoga began spending more time with him. It is unknown why he ran away, possibly that he was just bored with home. In the fourth OVA, Another Story, Ryoga makes another appearance. In the new series The New Prince of Tennis, Ryoga appears, with a rewritten backstory, and was picked up by the First Stringers in the U-17 camp while abroad. Ryoga is voiced by Yuuta Yamazaki. ==References * Official website at Shochiku * Official Tennis no Oujisama website * * Category:2005 anime films Category:Production I.G Category:Tennis films Category:The Prince of Tennis Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese sports films ","title":"Tennis no Ōjisama – Futari no Samurai"},{"id":"6199103","text":"Noam Friedlander is an author, award-winning scriptwriter, playwright, columnist, interviewer and feature writer.

(See also: Arbëreshë people#Early migrations) Over the years, the number of members has grown and today includes 30 female dancers, aged 12 to 30 years, and an orchestra of 7 male musicians. The group's goal is to keep alive the ancient arbëreshë values and the traditions, included songs and costumes. Peculiarities of the 'Eagles' (Shqiponjat) is to perform with a formation composed by only women. From ancient manuscripts and the oral tradition, it appears that, at the time of the Ottoman invasion in Albania, women – in addition to the family hearth - were dancing and singing to honor their husbands return from battle. ==Music repertoire== The show offered by Shqiponjat represents metaphorically the long journey that their ancestors have undertaken from the faraway Albanian coast to reach the Calabria territory in Italy at the end of the 15th century. In addition to the typical dances of the Albanian capital Tirana, there are those of Kosovo, in honor of the Albanian national hero, Skanderbeg and those of the northern and southern Albanian regions. Regarding the arbëreshe tradition, we find those linked to the traditional “Vallja” (), to the cycle of seasons or to the theme of love and nostalgia. The arbëresh repertory includes the ancient traditional rhymed and often improvised songs, called “vjershë” (poem), performed without musical accompaniment, sung only by double or triple voices. ==Exhibitions== The work developed by Shqiponjat is orientated to recover the origins of history as well as the Albanian culture, but more than anything else it wants to be a sort of “spiritual heredity”, or simply, a good reason to re-live a past still inside them, giving strength, at the same time, to the sense of belonging to the same community with their roots in the past and their wings towards the future.Shqiponjat: 1994 - 2009 The originality, serious work of research and the skill of the artists allowed to obtain prizes and awards not only in Italy, but also abroad, where often the group was called to represent the Italian-Albanian minority.

It was released in France under the alternate titles, Laura, disparue, recherchée and Qui se souvient de Laurie Zimmer? ==Synopsis== The film chronicles Szlovak's search to discover what happened to her long-lost friend, Laurie Zimmer, an American former actress who had a short, briefly promising, career during the mid-to-late 1970s. Zimmer, who is best known for her performance as the female lead in John Carpenter's 1976 thriller film, Assault on Precinct 13, played the lead role in Szlovak's 1977 film Slow City, Moving Fast (also known by the French title D'un Jour a L'Autre), which was shot in Los Angeles, California and chronicles a day in the life of an actress who has given up her career and drives around Los Angeles looking for something to do. Shortly after the filming of Slow City, Moving Fast, Zimmer quit acting and Szlovak never heard from her again. For over twenty years, Szlovak had been haunted by Zimmer's disappearance, by her abandonment of a once-promising acting career, and by the way her life seemed to eerily mirror the role she played in Szlovak's film. Szlovak then decides to search for Zimmer. Szlovak travels to Los Angeles and tries to track Zimmer down through various means. She meets and interviews John Carpenter. She also hires a truck to drive around Los Angeles towing a large billboard emblazoned with Zimmer's photo, both of her professional names (Laurie Zimmer and Laura Fanning), and a request to contact Szlovak with any information about Zimmer. Ultimately, Szlovak discovers that Zimmer lives near San Francisco, California, has become a teacher, is married, and has two sons. ==External links== * Category:2003 films Category:French documentary films Category:French films Category:French-language films Category:French independent films Category:French short films Category:2003 short films Category:Documentary films about actors Category:Documentary films about women in film Category:2003 documentary films ","title":"Do You Remember Laurie Zimmer?"},{"id":"6199161","text":"Shelley Preston (born 14 May 1964) is a singer who is most famous for being a member of the pop group Bucks Fizz, when she replaced Jay Aston in June 1985. Her biggest hit as a member of the band was the 1986 track New Beginning, which reached the UK top ten. She left the group in 1990. From 2004–2009, she was a member of the group The Original Bucks Fizz, along with former Bucks Fizz members Cheryl Baker and Mike Nolan. == Career == Preston was born in Hillingdon, England. She started singing in her local Sunday school choir from 4 years of age. While she was still at school, she sang with the Bournemouth Operatic Society. She worked as a singer at a hotel nightclub in Sri Lanka for six months before being selected at a London audition to be the new member of Bucks Fizz. Shelley was introduced as the new member of Bucks Fizz to millions of viewers on the BBC TV prime-time chat show Wogan, hosted by Terry Wogan. By the time Preston had joined the group, Bucks Fizz's last few singles had not charted so well. However, due to the huge amount of publicity and media frenzy surrounding the 'new girl' Bucks Fizz were back in the charts and selling out tours. \\"New Beginning (Mamba Seyra)\\" reached number 8 in the UK Charts in the Summer of 1986. The single preceded the album Writing on the Wall, released later that year. This included an early version of \\"Love in a World Gone Mad\\", which was later re-recorded featuring Preston's solo vocals. Its intended single release in 1987 was cancelled however. This version finally appeared on the re-issued Writing on the Wall album in 2004. After leaving Bucks Fizz in 1991, Preston made a career as a backing vocalist, touring and appearing with Jason Donovan, INXS, Brian May, Michael Bolton, Go West, Beverley Craven, Alexander O'Neal, Luther Vandross, Donny Osmond, Blue, Westlife, Alison Moyet, Tom Jones, David Hasselhoff, Errol Brown and Belinda Carlisle (she still occasionally performs with Carlisle).

They performed to a sell-out audience at the legendary Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in Soho, London, and have played at Pacha in Ibiza. In 2004, Preston reunited with Bucks Fizz bandmates Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Bobby G for the Christmas Here & Now arena tour. Following this, Baker, Nolan and Preston decided to continue as The Original Bucks Fizz. As a three- piece they performed at various festivals, nightclubs, and toured theatres up and down the UK. In June 2008, they performed at the last G-A-Y night alongside McFly and The Feeling. In August 2008, Preston with Baker, Nolan and Aston took part in a makeover show for Living TV, which was aired in March 2009 and performed with Björn Again at the Hammersmith Apollo on 18 December 2008.

The technique was first described in 1938 by Miles, Misra and Irwin who at the time were working at the LSHTM. The Miles and Misra method has been shown to be precise. Materials * A calibrated dropping pipette, or automatic pipette, delivering drops of 20μl. * Petri dishes containing nutrient agar or other appropriate medium. * Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) or other appropriate diluent. * Bacterial suspension or homogenate. Method *The inoculum / suspension is serially diluted by adding 1x of suspension to 9x of diluent. When the quantity of bacteria is unknown, dilutions should be made to at least 10−8. *Three plates are needed for each dilution series, for statistical reasons an average of at least 3 counts are needed. *The surface of the plates need to be sufficiently dry to allow a 20μl drop to be absorbed in 15–20 minutes. *Plates are divided into equal sectors (it is possible to use up to 8 per plate). The sectors are labelled with the dilutions. *In each sector, 1 x 20 μl of the appropriate dilution is dropped onto the surface of the agar and the drop allowed to spread naturally. In the original description of the method a drop from a height of 2.5 cm spread over an area of 1.5-2.0 cm. It is important to avoid touching the surface of the agar with the pipette. *The plates are left upright on the bench to dry before inversion and incubation at 37 °C for 18 – 24 hours (or appropriate incubation conditions considering the organism and agar used). *Each sector is observed for growth, high concentrations will give a confluent growth over the area of the drop, or a large number of small/merged colonies. Colonies are counted in the sector where the highest number of full-size discrete colonies can be seen (usually sectors containing between 2-20 colonies are counted). *The following equation is used to calculate the number of colony forming units (CFU) per ml from the original aliquot / sample: ::CFU per ml = Average number of colonies for a dilution x 50 x dilution factor.

A common syncretic religion is Santería, which combined the Yoruba religion of the African slaves with Catholicism and some Native American strands; it shows similarities to Brazilian Umbanda and has been receiving a degree of official support. The Roman Catholic Church estimates that 60 percent of the population is Catholic, but only 5% of that 60% attends mass regularly,\\"Comunidades de Fe en Cuba: Primera parte de la serie de fondo de WOLA sobre la religión en Cuba\\" Washington Office on Latin America, March 2012 while independent sources estimate that as few 1.5% of the population does so.\\"Cada uno en lo suyo, con coincidencias y discrepancias\\", La Arena (Argentina), March 29, 2012 Membership in Protestant churches is estimated to be 5 percent and includes Baptists, Pentecostals, Seventh-day Adventists, Presbyterians, Anglicans, Methodists, Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and Lutherans.

Non-Christian minority religions in Cuba include Hinduism and Chinese folk religion, which each account for 0.2% of the population, as well as the Baháʼí Faith, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam and Neoreligions, which all have non-negligible numbers of followers accounting for less than 0.1% of Cuba's population. In addition to the above, 18.0% of Cubans declared themselves to be agnostic and 5.1% claimed to be atheists. Entrance to the Catedral de San Cristóbal de la Habana (Cathedral of Saint Christopher of Havana) Cuba is home to a variety of syncretic religions of largely African cultural origin. According to a US State Department report, some sources estimate that as much as 80 percent of the population consults with practitioners of religions with West African roots, such as Santeria, Palo or Cuban Vodú. Santería developed out of the traditions of the Yoruba, one of the African peoples who were imported to Cuba during the 16th through 19th centuries to work on the sugar plantations. Santería blends elements of Christianity and West African beliefs and as such made it possible for the slaves to retain their traditional beliefs while appearing to practice Catholicism. La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (Our Lady Of Charity) is the Catholic patroness of Cuba, and is greatly revered by the Cuban people and seen as a symbol of Cuba. In Santería, she has been syncretized with the goddess Ochún. The important religious festival \\"La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre\\" is celebrated by Cubans annually on 8 September. Other religions practised are Palo Monte and Abakuá, which have large parts of their liturgy in African languages. Although restrictions on religion in Cuba were minimal compared to other communist nations like the Soviet Union or China, the large atheist population was most likely caused by the communist atmosphere of Marxist-Leninist atheism. ==HistoryPresidency of Fidel Castro=== After the communist revolution of 1959, the Cuban government restricted religious practice. Religious people were not allowed to join the Cuban Communist Party due to religion being contradictory to the party's Marxist philosophy. In August 1960, several bishops signed a joint pastoral letter condemning communism and declaring it incompatible with Catholicism, and calling on Catholics to reject it. Castro gave a four-hour speech the next day, condemning priests who serve \\"great wealth\\" and using fears of Falangist influence to attack Spanish born priests, declaring \\"There is no doubt that Franco has a sizeable group of fascist priests in Cuba.\\" The decade following the 1960s was turbulent, and many people lost interest in religion because much of the religious hierarchy opposed the popular revolution. The Archdiocese of Havana in 1971 reported only 7,000 baptisms. In 1989 this figure had increased to 27,609 and in 1991 to 33,569. In 1985 the Council of State in Havana published a best-selling book called Fidel y la Religion, which was the condensed transcription of 23 hours of interviews between Fidel Castro and a Brazilian liberation theology friar named Frei Betto, O.P. He claimed responsibility for excluding non-atheists from Communist Party membership on grounds that: > What we were demanding was complete adherence to Marxism-Leninism...It was > assumed that anybody who joined the party would accept the party's policy > and doctrine in all aspects. In the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the state adopted a more conciliatory position towards religion and lessened its promotion of atheism. In November 1991 the Communist Party began to allow believers into its ranks. In July 1992, the constitution was amended to remove the definition of Cuba as being a state based on Marxism–Leninism, and article 42 was added, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of religious belief. Small worship centers were legally permitted to exist again. In the early 1990s, weekly church-attendance on the island of 11 million was estimated at around 250,000 or about 2% of the population (with an even division between Catholics and Protestants). Cuba had fewer priests per inhabitant than any other Latin American country. Since 1992, restrictions have been eased, and direct challenges by state institutions to the right to believe eased somewhat, though the Roman Catholic church still faces restrictions of written and electronic communication and can only accept donations from state-approved funding sources. The Roman Catholic Church is made up of the Cuban Catholic Bishops' Conference (CCBC), led by Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino, Cardinal Archbishop of Havana. It has eleven dioceses, 56 orders of nuns and 24 orders of priests. The Cuban Bishops' Conference has severely criticized the US embargo against Cuba and has claimed that the entire population has suffered from it. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has been influenced by this and has argued for the exclusion of food and medicine from the embargo. In January 1998, although he was an anti-communist, Pope John Paul II paid a historic visit to the island, invited by the Cuban government and the Catholic Church in Cuba. The pope criticized the US embargo during his visit. Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in 2012 and Pope Francis visited in 2015.New York Times May 11, 2015, A4 In a shift in policy, the Cuban government has issued permits to allow the construction of a new church in Cuba, the first since 1959. On October 20, 2008, the first Russian Orthodox Church in Cuba opened during an official ceremony attended by Raul Castro. ===Presidency of Raul Castro=== The stance of the Cuban Communist Party began to shift. Raúl Castro said in a 2015 televised news conference in which he discussed Pope Francis's September 2015 visit, \\"I am from the Cuban Communist Party that doesn't allow believers, but now we are allowing it. It's an important step.\\"Jim Yardley, \\"Praising Pope, Cuban President says he might return to Church.\\" New York Times May 11, 2015 A4. Castro indicated he might return to being a practicing Catholic and that he would attend the Masses that the pope celebrates in Cuba.New York Times, May 11, 2015, A4 Studies appeared that attempted to link Afro-Cuban religions with mental illness. Hernandez-Ramdwar, Camille. \\"Christine Ayorinde: Afro-Cuban Religiosity, Revolution, and National Identity.\\" Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies 31.62 (2006) The campaign for the eradication of racial discrimination in Cuba was (and still is) used as grounds to forbid the creation of Afro-Cuban institutions, because doing so was labelled as racially divisive. Pastor Clara Rodes Gonzalez claims \\"we suffered discrimination in the schools and at work.\\"Oliva, Enrique Lopez. \\"Religious reawakening: stirrings in Cuba.\\" \\"> == Christianity == Christianity has played an important role in Cuba's history. The indigenous people of Cuba were colonized by Christopher Columbus a few days after he arrived to the New World in 1492. In 1511, colonization systematically began when the Conquistador Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar established the Catholic Church in Cuba with the early priest Fray Bartolomé de las Casas known commonly as \\"the Protector of the Indians\\". Along with Catholicism, Protestantism came during the same time. Catholicism was established early while Protestantism came later. \\"Protestantism did not permanently take hold in Cuba until the nineteenth century, though since the sixteenth century the country had been constantly visited by pirates, corsairs and filibusters, many of whom were Protestants\\". In Cuba, the roots of Protestantism occurred around the same time as Christianity. The denominations of Catholicism and Protestantism have a significant influence in Cuban history. === Catholicism === The Catholic Church in Cuba is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. The Catholic Church body in Cuba is governed by the Cuban Bishops Conference. There are over six million Catholics - around 60.5% of the total population[citation needed]. The country is divided into eleven dioceses including three archdioceses. The Catholic Church in Cuba has taken on a more politically active role than in many other countries. It claims to have engaged in discussion with the government on issues such as political prisoners and free market reforms. Catholics in Cuba have greater religious freedom than those in other Communist countries such as China and Vietnam. ===Jehovah's Witnesses=== As of 2016, there were about 96,000 active Jehovah's Witnesses in Cuba (about 0.85% of the population). From 1938 to 1947, the number of Jehovah's Witnesses in Cuba increased from about 100 to 4,000. After World War II, membership in Cuba increased to 20,000, and by 1989 there were approximately 30,000 members. The movement was banned in Cuba in 1974, and members have been imprisoned for their refusal of military service. During the Mariel boatlift in 1980, about 3,000 Witnesses left Cuba. In 1994, the Cuban government released representatives of the Watch Tower Society, and members were permitted to meet in groups of up to 150 at Kingdom Halls and other places for worship. A branch office of Jehovah's Witnesses, with a print shop, was opened in Havana in the same year. In 1998, Witnesses were permitted to meet at larger conventions in major cities in Cuba. === Protestantism === While Protestants arrived in the island of Cuba early in its colonial days, most of their churches did not flourish until the 20th century with the assistance of American missionaries. In the early 20th century, Cuban Protestant churches were greatly aided by various American missionaries who assisted in the work in the churches and also provided support from their home churches. When Fidel Castro’s regime overtook the country in 1959, Protestant churches were legally allowed to continue. Nevertheless, certain incidents as detailed below and religious persecution kept them from prospering. During the Special Period that began in 1991, Protestant churches began to flourish once again and today have become a primary religious group of Cuba. The Protestant population of Cuba is estimated at 11%. Seventh-Day Adventist As of 2016 the Seventh-Day Adventist Church in Cuba has more than 34,041 members worshiping in 328 churches and congregations, and is reported as one of the largest Protestant churches in Cuba. The relationship with the government has been positive, although the main college, the Antillian Union College which started in Cuba moved to Puerto Rico following the 1959 Cuban Revolution. In 1969 a seminary was started at the headquarters of the church in Cuba, and in 1985 it developed a relationship with the University of Montemorelos in Mexico as an extension school bringing the facility, now called Cuba Adventist Seminary, up to more universally accepted standards. In 1996 the seminary moved to a new campus built by Maranatha Volunteers International, and in 2008 it won full accreditation by the Adventist Accrediting Association (AAA). The pastors and Bible workers in Cuba, hold services and evangelize despite limited resources like computers, books, Sabbath School and children's ministry resources but the church believes that the improvement in U.S. - Cuba relations could mean greater opportunities for the growth of the church. The president of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Cuba, Aldo Perez, attended President Obama's speech in Havana on his visit in 2016. In 2017 a new state of the art church was dedicated in Cardenas, Matanzas, with over 1,200 church leaders, members, government representatives and guests from across the island. ==Santeria== The arrival and endurance of Santeria (also known as Regla de Ocha) in Cuba results from multiple contributing factors. The roots of Santeria stem from Nigeria and were transported to Cuba by way of the Lucumí people. However, the Lucumi people only consisted of about 8% of the overall slave population in Cuba from 1760 until about 1850. With such low numbers to draw upon, the religion was under constant attack in the form of dilution through more dominant numbers in the form of reproductive outsourcing and the cruelty inflicted through the employment of slavery. Between 1800 and 1850 almost the entire population in Cuba consisted of people of African descent. This factor created a sense of uncertainty for plantation owners because of tensions amongst the slave population. The slave rivalries eventually resulted in an ever rising loss in production. The method for combating the losses yielded that an increase in the Lucumi population would serve the plantation best. Lucumi people were known to be hard workers and mild-mannered. As result of increasing import of slaves the population of the Lucumi rose sharply to about 34%. Attributing to the increase of Santeria was that many other slaves and freemen began to practice the religion of Santeria, thereby increasing the span of influence and affiliation in a more diverse manner. The disposition of colonialism brought a significant strain on all religions outside of Catholicism. Over the course of a 90-year span, the Lucumi maintained the practice of the religion of Santeria. The religion of Santeria encompasses sacrificial food, song, dance, costumes, spiritual deities and the use of artifacts. In the beginning the Lucumi and other worshippers of Santeria would have to practice in secret. They would create hasty areas in which they would conduct structuralized practice of Santeria and return to their colonial life after. However, the practice of Santeria on a more regular basis takes place not on the sugar plantations but in the urban areas. The syncretism that modernized Santeria was introduced when high-class mulattoes needed to find ways to alleviate ailments such as stress or sickness. There was no formal medical aid available to the community at the time. In light of this disposition high-class Mulattoes pulled from whatever resources that they could find. They employed the practices of Christian- educated slaves with Afro-Cuban healers and Spanish curanderos. The Afro-Cuban healers and Spanish curanderos served as the only medical practitioners in Cuba and were responsible for treating both the black and white population. The distance between the city and the countryside made it very difficult for slaves to participate in the syncretism of Santeria with Catholicism and Christianity. This was due to geography. Most of the European religious churches were located the urban areas or towns and to attend services would require traveling over long distances, which would interfere with the sugar production. In the urban areas slaves worked alongside freemen and White Cubans in a less restricted atmosphere. They were educated and trusted to perform skilled labor and given a great deal of responsibility. They served in a number of diverse jobs, which acted as a catalyst for the syncretism of Santeria with Catholicism and Christianity. Not every slave in Cuba complied with the employment of slavery. Cimarrones, as the Cuban slave owners labeled them, were a group of slaves who fled captivity and formed communities consisting of thousands of people. They took refuge in the wilderness and the mountains of Cuba where they maintained the practice of Santeria. They were considered a very serious threat to the colonial government's hold on slavery and oppression. The Cimarrones were able to elude capture and to provide aid and shelter to other escaped slaves. Over the course of time they developed the means to communicate with other surrounding secret camps via the plantation slaves and friendly White Cubans. Other slaves and freemen who lived in rural areas formed secret societies and groups in which they exercised their religious beliefs of Santeria out of public view to avoid colonial reform and oppression. After the abolishment of slavery Palenque, the Cimarrones establishment was converted into a town named El Cobre after surviving for fifty years. In the religion of Santeria the emphasis of conscious existence binds the understanding of nature, the higher powers, and the channels of lineage together through ritual practice and clairvoyance. The circle is a symbol that is divided into three sections that begin at the core with people and extend out into two other sections being ancestors and finally divinities. The significance of people at the inner core stand to represent the present day of existence and understanding in the form of perception within the individual as he or she can interpret the information surrounding them. The outer layer of the ancestor represents the heritable understanding that the individual carries with them as a source of how and why to interpret values of perception within a given realm. The outmost layer represents divinity is the value of knowledge, direction and understanding that is acquired from Orishas and personal experience. The existence the circle represents is not a fixed plain of understanding but stands as an interchangeable ever-evolving and rotating sense of awareness and being. Santeria lineage is structured in the connection through Sibs (a group of kin) with each Sib being traced back to a common male ancestor linking the bloodlines to the religion. \\"There were three different routes for the transmission of Orisha worship. A child could inherit an Orisha from either its mother or father and continue their worship of it. In this case a triangular relationship existed between the child, the parent, and the Orisha.\\" ==Others Islam === According to a 2011 Pew Research Center report, there were then 10,000 Muslims in Cuba who constitute 0.1% of the population. As of 2012, most of the 10,000 Cuban Muslims were converts to the religion. At a certain point there were many Muslim students entering the nation of Cuba interested in studying at Cuba's prestigious schools. The number of students was approximately 1500–2000. That group included students of Pakistani origin, among others. It is known that the dominant population that went to study at Cuba was the Pakistani students who were about 936 in strength. In 2001, Sheikh Muhammad bin Nassir Al-Aboudy, the Assistant Secretary-General of the Muslim World League (MWL) travelled to Cuba to obtain permission from the Cuban authorities to establish an Islamic organization that would support Cuba's Muslim community. Among the other aims of the proposed organization would be constructing mosques and the dissemination of Islamic culture among Muslims. As of July 2015 the Turkish Religious Affairs Foundation had opened the first prayer room for Cuban Muslims and the first mosque in Cuba was under construction with Turkish funding. === Judaism === Jews have lived in the island of Cuba for centuries. Some Cubans trace Jewish ancestry to Marranos (converts to Christianity) who came as colonists, though few of these practice Judaism today. More than 24,000 Jews lived in Cuba in 1924, and more immigrated to the country in the 1930s. But during and after the 1959 communist revolution, 94% of the Jews left for the United States and other countries In 2007 an estimated 1,500 known Jewish Cubans remained in the country, overwhelmingly located in Havana., occasionally called Jubans as a portmanteau of the English word \\"Jew\\" and Cuban.

A powerful defender, Boli made his way into the Auxerre first team and soon made his debut for the French national team in 1986 (going on to win 45 caps altogether). His form meant that he soon became a transfer target for the leading clubs in France. Finally in 1990 Boli signed for Olympique de Marseille who, under Bernard Tapie, were fast becoming the leading club in France. Boli starred as the club won Ligue 1 in 1991 and 1992 and was also a regular in the club's 1992–93 UEFA Champions League campaign, topping the season off by scoring the only goal of the final against A.C. Milan that gave the cup to OM. Whilst at the club he even joined teammate Chris Waddle in recording a song entitled 'We've Got a Feeling'. He is remembered by football fans in England for his appearance for France against the England team in Euro 92 where he headbutted Stuart Pearce. Despite his success at Marseille Boli was forced to leave in 1994 following revelations of a match fixing scandal and the relegation of the club. He signed for Rangers F.C. for £2 million in the summer of that year and went on to make 28 league appearances (2 goals) during the 1994–95 season, securing a league winners' medal. Boli left Rangers at the end of that season and wound down his career with a season back in France with AS Monaco FC before ending his career in 1997 after a spell in Japan with Urawa Red Diamonds. ==Personal life== Basile is the uncle of current players Yannick Boli, Charles Boli, and Kévin Boli, and is the younger brother of former striker Roger Boli. ==Career statisticsClub=== :Source: {  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! colspan=3  Club performance ! colspan=2  League ! colspan=2  Cup ! colspan=2  League Cup ! colspan=2  Total - !

A son of the long-time President Mobutu Sese Seko, he served in the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo under President Joseph Kabila from 2007 to 2011, initially as Minister of State for Agriculture and subsequently as Deputy Prime Minister for Basic Social Needs. He was dismissed from the government in March 2011. In 2008, he founded the Union of Mobutist Democrats as the successor to his father's Popular Movement of the Revolution and has led the party since. ==Background== Nzanga Mobutu is the eldest son of Mobutu Sese Seko by his second wife, Bobi Ladawa. Nzanga studied in Belgium, France and Canada before returning to Congo in the mid-1990s.

In the 2006 presidential election, he ran as a candidate and placed fourth, with about 4.8% of the vote.Elections in Congo-Kinshasa, African Elections Database. Following the first round of voting, Mobutu entered into a platform political coalition with incumbent president Joseph Kabila to try to rally votes from the Equateur region where Jean-Pierre Bemba was favored to win.

She later sailed as USS Mongolia (ID-1615) for the U.S. Navy, as SS President Fillmore for the Dollar Line and as SS Panamanian for Cia Transatlantica Centroamericano. ==History== Originally laid down as Minnelora on 7 June 1902 in Shipway J at New York Shipbuilding in Camden, New Jersey for the Atlantic Transport Line, she was purchased by E. H. Harriman's Pacific Mail Steamship Co. for its San Francisco-Far East service, and renamed Mongolia. The 616-foot vessel was contract #5 for the young company, and the first passenger-cargo liner built by the firm. She was launched on 25 July 1903 and christened by Miss Lucy Bell Kennedy of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A sister ship, , was ordered at the same time and delivered three months after Mongolia. Both ships were used on the trans-Pacific service (Hong Kong, Hawaii, San Francisco) from 1904 to 1915. The accommodations of both ships reflected the importance of Chinese emigration to shipping lines of that era: 350 first-class, 68 second-class, and 1,300 steerage. In early August 1915, Pacific Mail announced it could not affordably meet the language clause of the Seamen's Act in the Far East and intended to cease commercial shipping operations there. Later that month, the company sold five of its liners, including Mongolia to Atlantic Transport Line, for whom she plied the New York-London route. In March 1917, following the German declaration of a submarine blockade around Britain, Mongolia was chartered as an Army transport and received a self-defense armament of three deck guns manned by U.S. Navy gun crews. One month later, Mongolia became the first American vessel to test the blockade, using those guns to drive off (and possibly sink) a U-boat seven miles southeast of Beachy Head, in the English Channel. That was the first armed encounter for an American vessel after the US's entry to World War I. For the next year, Mongolia ferried American troops and supplies to Europe. Two American nurses, Clara Ayres and Helen Burnett Wood, were accidentally killed during one of these crossings, and another was wounded. During the afternoon of 20 May 1917, the nurses were on the deck of the Mongolia, observing the firing of the aft 6-inch gun, when they were struck by fragments of the shell's brass casing. On 27 April 1918, the US Navy requisitioned the vessel, reconfigured her for greater troop capacity, and commissioned her on 8 May as USS Mongolia (ID-1615). In all, she completed twelve turnarounds at an average duration of 34 days and transporting over 33,000 passengers, before being decommissioned on 11 September 1919. Returned to civilian service, Mongolia sailed the New York-Hamburg route under charter to the American Line. She was purchased in 1923 by the Panama Pacific Line and placed into service on its New York-San Francisco route (via the Panama Canal). In 1929, Dollar Steamship Lines acquired Mongolia and her sister ship Manchuria for its east-to-west round-the-world service, renaming them President Fillmore and President Johnson, respectively. The former Mongolia sailed for only two years with the Dollar Line. With the onset of the Great Depression, she was laid up in New York, and when the Dollar Line collapsed in 1938 ownership passed to the newly created American President Lines. She never sailed under the APL pennant, however, and was sold in 1940 to Cia Transatlantica Centroamericana of Panama, which renamed her Panamanian. She was scrapped in Shanghai, China, 20 May 1946. One of the deck guns from the Mongolia's World War I service, the Mark 4 6 inch, 40 Caliber Gun No. 155, is preserved in Gosport Park outside the Norfolk Naval Shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia. == References  Further reading == * == External links == * Category:Ocean liners Category:Ships built in Camden, New Jersey Category:World War I auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Transports of the United States Navy Category:1903 ships Category:Cargo liners ","title":"SS Mongolia (1903)"},{"id":"6199314","text":"The Camp du Ban-Saint-Jean is a former military camp near Boulay-Moselle in France. Totally abandoned today, it was used during World War II as a stalag (German POW camp). During the cold war, \\"Boulay\\" and \\"Ban Saint Jean\\" were the place where the NATO (OTAN) had one of the two secret base named \\"Big Ears\\" dedicated to listening radio communications from the East side. Giant sophisticated antennas and the most modern radio communications systems were operated under protection of the 718th company of transmissions of the French army. a couple of hundred trained specialists were scruitining the radio space to detect any military move from the East side, triggering alerts as soon as any alarming message was detected and deciphered. The network was connected through equipments called \\"Dispatchers\\" to a radio-goniometry network of antennas located on the German side of the nearby border (some in Rastatt). The camp of \\"Ban Saint Jean\\" was a perfect hideout, it was lodging the teams of specialists (out of the sight of normal life and out of contact with others...) in comfortable large houses.

Written and directed by Tony Vitale (a former location manager) and produced by Ira Deutchman and Christine Vachon, it stars Nick Scotti, Anthony Barrile, Anthony DeSando and Craig Chester. ==Synopsis== Frankie (Scotti) is a young Italian American man living with his family in The Bronx, New York. He works in a pizza parlor but, inspired by the likes of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, he wants to be an actor. After catching his fiancée (Jennifer Esposito) cheating on him with his brother, Frankie decides the time has come to move out and pursue his dream. He starts by checking the classifieds for roommate ads. He finds an ad from a \\"GWM.\\" In classified-speak this stands for \\"gay white male\\" but Frankie and his friend Joey (Domenick Lombardozzi) interpret it as \\"guy with money.\\" The GWM in question is Warren (Barrile), an actor who's recently broken up with his director boyfriend. Frankie and Warren each have some initial misgivings - Frankie over Warren's being gay, Warren over Frankie's being a \\"Guido\\" or stereotypical Italian American – but Warren lets Frankie move in. Warren's ex, Dakota (Christopher Lawford), returns and offers Warren a part in his new play. Warren initially accepts but after being injured in an attempted gay bashing, has to withdraw. Frankie replaces him, but the part involves a same- sex kiss, which makes him nervous. At the premiere Frankie gives a good performance (although he hesitates on the kiss, leading his scene partner to hiss \\"Kiss me, Guido!\\") for an audience that includes his family, who come to understand and accept his decision to become an actor. ==Cast== * Nick Scotti as Frankie * Anthony Barrile as Warren * Anthony DeSando as Pino * Craig Chester as Terry * Domenick Lombardozzi as Joey Chips * Molly Price as Meryl * Christopher Lawford as Dakota * David Deblinger as Stage Actor * John Tormey as Patsy Zito * Antonia Rey as Josephina Zito * Jennifer Esposito as Debbie * Anthony Vitale as Pizza Guy #1 * Frankie Dellarosa as Pizza Guy #2 * Rebecca Waxman as Wiggy * Tony Ray Rossi as Vinny the Fish ==Soundtrack== * Machine - \\"There But for the Grace of God Go I\\" * Panic Patrol - \\"Out of Control\\" * La Flavour - \\"Mandolay\\" * Miquel Brown - \\"So Many Men, So Little Time\\" * 3rd Party - \\"Can U Feel It\\" * Edwin Starr - \\"Contact\\" * Carol Jiani - \\"Hit & Run Lover\\" * Martha Wash - \\"Magic Charms\\" * The Gap Band - \\"Burn Rubber on Me (Why You Wanna Hurt Me)\\" * Nick Scotti - \\"I'm Gonna Shout\\" * Edwin Starr - \\"H.A.P.P.Y.

The college was founded, owned, and presided over by Louis Clausiel Perry, who came to Terrell from Missouri by 1915 and stayed until his death in 1926, after which his widow, Minnie E. Perry, operated the school until February 1949, when she sold the institution's physical plant and grounds to the Southern Bible Institute. Perry, who served as president of Scarritt-Morrisville College, in Missouri, from 1909 until 1915, was attracted to Terrell as a result of discussions with members of the Terrell Commercial Club. They convinced him that facilities left vacant when Wesley College moved from Terrell to Greenville in 1912 were ideal for the foundation of a new school. These buildings had housed institutions of learning since 1897, when W. B. Toon, son-in-law of Robert A. Terrell, established Toon College on the grounds of the Terrell homestead. The octagonal Terrell house became the administration building. Toon College became Terrell University School in 1901, with Toon as principal. By 1904 it was succeeded by the Methodist-run North Texas University School, headed by Rev. Joseph J. Morgan. In 1909 the name was changed to Wesley College, and the Methodists continued to operate the institution in Terrell until they moved it to Greenville. Perry purchased the existing physical plant in 1914 and, with the assistance of local leaders, improved its condition. Texas Military College opened on September 21, 1915, with Perry as president and professor of philosophy and oratory. He implemented a unique educational and housing system at the school. Under the \\"home group system,\\" students coming from the same general geographical region were housed together under the supervision of a resident professor. It was believed that under this system the school's instructors and administrators could closely monitor each student's educational, moral, and physical progress. The school offered three levels of instruction: a junior school (grades three through seven), a high school, and a junior college. The physical plant that Perry purchased in 1914 consisted of an administration building and two dormitories; the success that the institution found in attracting students is suggested by the fact that by the time of Perry's death in 1926, the administration building had been enlarged, several new buildings had been constructed, and student enrollment reached 150. In 1940 the institution built an armory, and enrollment had risen to 250. The college temporarily ceased operations in 1943; enrollment was low during World War II, in which a number of the faculty took part. The school reopened in 1946, with B. B. Abrams as president, but was unable to maintain itself. In 1947 Mrs. Perry deeded the property to the city of Terrell. The community, however, also proved unable to operate the institution on a paying basis and returned control to Mrs. Perry. In 1949 she sold the school's physical plant and grounds to the Southern Bible Institute, which in 1950 established a junior college for blacks, Southwestern Christian College, at the location.

Grundy grew up in Dallas in the U.S. state of Texas. He now lives in Shinrone, County Offaly, Ireland. He has over two dozen published books and a number of published papers. He is best known for his modern adaptations of legendary sagas and also a non-fiction writer on Germanic mythology, Germanic paganism, and Germanic neopaganism. ==NovelsRhinegold=== Grundy began working on his first complete novel during his first year at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, where he was studying English and German philology. Originally, the novel was intended to be based on the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf, but Grundy was convinced by his professor Dr. Stephen Flowers (author of numerous widely respected works about Germanic history and magic) that the Nibelung legend would be a more appropriate basis for a first novel. Grundy wrote most of the novel in a dormitory at the University of St Andrews, Scotland, where he spent one year as an exchange student. He also spent a year as an exchange student in Bonn, Germany - virtually at the foot of the Drachenberg - spending some of his time on research for his novel (which also led him all across Scandinavia). Rhinegold — a retelling of the entire Sigurð cycleJohn Clute and John Grant, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, New York: St. Martin's, 1999, p. 692. dedicated to, among others, Richard Wagner and J. R. R. Tolkien — came out in 1994, and quickly developed into an international best-seller.Like Wagner, Grundy used the Scandinavian version of the story. The German translation proved more popular than the English original. Winder McConnell, A companion to the Nibelungenlied, Columbia, South Carolina: Camden House, 1998, p. 140. In 1995, Grundy received his PhD from the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, University of Cambridge with a dissertation on Odin: \\"The Cult of Óðinn: God of Death?\\".Stephan Scott Grundy, 'The Cult of Óðinn: God of Death?' (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Cambridge University, 1995); the thesis was accompanied by a self-published book, Stephan Grundy, Miscellaneous Studies Towards the Cult of Odinn (Everett, WA: Vikar, 1994). Terri Windling identified Rhinegold as one of the best fantasy debuts of 1994, describing it as \\"both scholarly and entertaining\\".\\"Summation 1994: Fantasy,\\" The Year's Best Fantasy and Horror: Eighth Annual Collection, p.xviii ===Attila's Treasure=== Two years later, 1996, Grundy completed Attila's Treasure, focused less on Attila the Hun than on Grundy's favorite legendary figure, Hagen. This novel, too, was an international success, but to a lesser degree than the forerunner novel Rhinegold. ===Gilgamesh=== This was followed in 1999 by Gilgamesh, a modern adaptation of the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh that attempts to address directly the homosexual nature of the original text largely ignored by modern scholars. This was less well received than the two earlier novels. ===Falcon Dreams Series=== With Melodi Lammond-Grundy, Grundy has since published the Falcon Dreams series, a trilogy first published in German and available in English in e-book format: Falcon's Flight (2000), Eagle and Falcon (2002), and Falcon's Night (2002). ==Non-fiction works as Kveldulf Gundarsson and influence in Germanic neopaganism== Before publishing his first novel, Grundy published, as Kveldulf Gundarsson, two books on Germanic neopaganism and Germanic magic. He has since edited and co-written both editions of the handbook of The Troth, Our Troth, and written other works on ancient and modern Germanic paganism and Germanic culture. Grundy was previously Lore Warden and Master of the Elder Training Program for the Ring of Troth (now known simply as The Troth) and carried on the organization's tradition of being based in scholarship, started by Edred Thorsson.Kaplan, Jeffrey, \\"Chapter Nine: The Reconstruction of the Ásatrú and Odinist Traditions\\" in Lewis, James R. (1996) Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft SUNY Press, , pp. 224, 233 (note 48).

However, aside from this triumph, Field had a long career before Foster even played for Warwickshire. Indeed, if Foster's career was tragic, Field's was in many ways more so, for a succession of serious accidents hampered him at exactly the time he would otherwise have become a top-class fast bowler and a candidate for representative honours. Field first played for Warwickshire in 1897, but it was only the following year with a tireless 8 for 144 in an innings of 509 against Gloucestershire that he was seen as possibly a major acquisition for the county. Despite occasional setbacks, he advanced rapidly to be Warwickshire's leading bowler in the dry summer of 1899 with 73 wickets for 23 each - a remarkable performance on such true pitches as Edgbaston was then known for. His 12 for 194 against the powerful Surrey batting made many critics believe Field would become England's first-choice fast bowler within a few years. 1900 saw him take 100 wickets for the first time, and he maintained his form through 1901 despite an injury early in the season. However, the sequence of tragedies that was to ruin Field's career began the following year when extremely wet weather and the slow-drying nature of the Edgbaston ground made Field worthless for most of the season. This was repeated the following year, but his value to the team on hard wickets was already unquestioned. However, the following three mainly fine summers - when his bowling would have been wanted regularly rather than occasionally - were almost entirely wiped out by a succession of injuries and strains. In 1906, indeed, he suffered a heel injury in the first match and did not play again. Doubts were expressed over Field's capacity to recover from such an appalling series of setbacks, and though he was expensive even when wanted in the wet 1907 summer, 1908 saw Field, despite having little support, have his best season yet highlighted by an impressive performance against Yorkshire (who came closer to losing a match than at any other time that year). However, a disappointing 1909 suggested that Field was past it. And though 1910 saw Field come closer to his best (notably against Yorkshire at Edgbaston when he bowled them out for 125 on a perfect pitch), there was little belief he could survive a full season of dry wickets. All expectations, though were refuted by his consistently excellent work on the lightning fast wickets of 1911, which saw him take 122 wickets in 19 games for 19.48 each - slightly better even than Foster. However, again a wet summer where his pace was of no value prevented Field from keeping up his form, and an injury in 1913 at the age of thirty-seven put paid to hopes of Field having another season like 1911. He bowled quite well in 1914 and played a few matches with success in 1919, but was clearly unable at forty-three to bowl a full season at full pace, and he retired the following year. Field had no pretensions to be a batsman, but at his best was a bowler of considerable pace and capable of a sharp break-back on a worn pitch, as was shown most clearly in Warwickshire's crucial win against Yorkshire at Harrogate in 1911, when he took 7 for 20 to bowl Yorkshire out for 58. ==External links== * First Class Bowling statistics Category:1874 births Category:1934 deaths Category:Warwickshire cricketers Category:English cricket umpires Category:English cricketers Category:London County cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:Lord Londesborough's XI cricketers Category:Non-international England cricketers ","title":"Frank Field (cricketer, born 1874)"},{"id":"6199433","text":"Ferrari created three different cars to use the Tipo 625 four-cylinder engine: * 1953 625 TF sports racer * 1954 625 F1 Formula One racer * 1956 625 LM sports racer 625 ","title":"Ferrari 625"},{"id":"6199435","text":"Black Sea Harmony is a naval operation initiated by Turkey in March 2004 in accordance with UN Security Council Resolutions 1373, 1540 and 1566 aimed at deterring terrorism and asymmetric threats in the Black Sea.

Godavari has six sons: Arvind, a strict and old fashioned insurance agent; Praveen, a mischievous and stingy saree businessman; Subodh, a playful theater actor; Harshad, a successful doctor; Gopal a.k.a. Gattu, an intellectually disabled child; and Hemal, the adopted son who works at a bank. The family also includes her daughter-in-laws, Leela, Arvind's playful wife; Praveena, Praveen's wife who is naughty, athletic and a saree businesswoman (who is dead); Shilpa, Harshad's wife and a doctor; Meenakshi, the shy wife of Subodh and Gudiya, the Punjabi wife of Hemal. Godavari has two daughters, Charubala and Radhika a.k.a. Baby. Charubala is a sophisticated woman who always shows off. She is married to Tushar and lives in South Mumbai. Radhika is handicapped (affected with polio) and a very stubborn girl who is often seen talking rudely, but loves her family and understands life. Among the children are Dimple and Jigar, grown up children of Arvind and Leela; Mehul, Mitali and Chaitali, children of Praveen and Praveena; Simran and Khushi, daughters of Charubala and Tushhar; Saloni and Saumil, children of Harshad and Shilpa; Manav and Disha, children of Subodh and Meenakshi, and Lucky, the adopted child of Hemal and Gudiya. The house has a cook Rajjaa and a worker, Narsi Kaka. == Plot  Season 1 === The season begins with a detailed introduction of all the members of the household and how they deal with all the issues impacting a joint family structure. They face different problems and misunderstandings, and how they circumvent them. Notable episodic stories of this season are: Radhika's unrequited love for Anish, an NRI, Anish and Dimple's love story, Harshad being turned out of the house by Godavari and his return after 5 years, Praveena's tragic demise, Radhika and Birju's love story, the calamity of Praveen selling their home to a real estate shark without letting family members know, Hemal and Gudiya's wedding, and Jigar's coming of age. The inner turmoils of a matriarch leading a 20+ members family is beautifully represented. === Season 2 === The sons get Krishna villa renovated. The season focuses on the relationship of Baby - Birju and Jigar - Rimjhim. Reluctance from the family of Birju to accept Baby as their daughter- in-law creates initial hiccups, but they get married eventually. Rimjhim is daughter of a wealthy businessman and the Thakkar family helps her to elope from a forced arranged marriage as she and Jigar love each other. While Rimjhim and Jigar try to prove themselves worthy, Rekha enters the household as the unwed mother of a newborn whom she hands over to Gattu for care-giving. Gattu grows attached to the newborn girl. The season ends with the publication of Baa's biography, Baa Bahoo Aur Baby. There is a leap of 3 years where the family members are shown in various situations - Leela and Arvind finally get to visit United States, the children of Pravin are all grown up and pursuing their careers, Harshad and Shilpa open a pediatric hospital in Baa's name, Meenakshi is expecting her third child, and Gudiya has had twin daughters, a breakthrough in polio treatment has helped Baby to recover from her polio, Rimjhim has started a family catering business, and finally, Babuji has stopped drinking.

In November 2008, the shootings and telecast of all the Hindi television series including this series and films were stalled on 8 November 2008 due to dispute by the technician workers of FWICE (Federation of Western India Cine Employees) for increasing the wages, better work conditions and more breaks between shootings. FWICE first took a strike on 1 October 2008 when they addressed their problems with the producers and production was stalled. A contract was signed after four days discussions, and shooting was happening only for two hours per day, after which differences increased between them while channels gave them time until 30 October 2008 to sort it out. Failing to do so led to protests again from 10 November 2008 to 19 November 2008, during which channels blacked out new broadcasts and repeat telecasts were shown from 10 November 2008. On 19 November 2008, the strike was called off after settling the disputes and the production resumed. The new episodes started to telecast from 1 December 2008. ==In other media== Gattu's character, portrayed by Deven Bhojani, was used in the 2012 drama serial Alaxmi Ka Super Parivaar where he came as the nephew of Natwarlal and Mohandas. ==Legacy== The Indian Express stated, \\"The strength of the show is its characters that deliver a power-packed performance. The right concoction of situational humour and proper representation of characters remains the forte of the show. With an ensemble cast of seasoned stage artistes, the show manages to hold attention and evoke laughter. The show is an instant hit among the womenfolk. It's a sweet humorous tale worth a dekko.\\" == References == Category:2000s Indian television series Category:2010s Indian television series Category:2005 Indian television series debuts Category:2010 Indian television series endings Category:Star Plus original programming Category:Indian television soap operas Category:Indian comedy television series Category:Comedy-drama television series Category:Indian drama television series Category:Mental illness in television Category:Hats Off Productions ","title":"Baa Bahoo Aur Baby"},{"id":"6199459","text":"Gérard Kamanda wa Kamanda Gerard Kamanda wa Kamanda (10 December 1940 – 21 January 2016) was a Congolese politician who stood for President in the 2006 election in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The album was released on May 2, 2006 on Sony BMG and Christian music label Reunion Records. The album peaked on the Billboard 200 at number 74, and at number 3 on the Christian Albums chart. Four singles have been released from the album: \\"Welcome Home (You)\\", which charted at number one on the Christian Songs chart, and won Best Video of the Year of Dove Award. The album has sold over 100,000 copies in U.S as of April 2007. ==Recording== For a long time, Littrell had wanted to record Christian music—what he calls \\"pop positive\\" music. His first solo album, Welcome Home, was released on May 2, 2006, which, like the Backstreet Boys projects, is a Sony BMG release. The album peaked at number 74 on the Billboard 200 and number 3 on the Christian charts, and has sold over 100,000 copies. Three singles were released from the album. The first, \\"Welcome Home (You)\\", reached number 2 on the US Christian charts and number one on Reach FM's Top 40 chart and the R&R; Christian Inspirational Chart, staying there for three weeks. The second single was \\"Wish\\" and, in 2007, the third single, \\"Over My Head\\", was released. During this time, he maintained his duties as a member of the Backstreet Boys. In the summer of 2005, his solo single, \\"In Christ Alone\\", went to number one on the Christian charts on July 4. Littrell was a winner of the 2006 GMA Dove Award for Inspirational Recorded Song of the Year for \\"In Christ Alone\\" (along with songwriters Don Koch and Shawn Craig). In the next few years he would win three more Doves for collaboration projects; in 2008, Special Event Album of the Year for Glory Revealed (various artists) and the Inspirational Recorded Song of the Year for \\"By His Wounds\\", from that album; and in 2010, Special Event Album of the Year for Glory Revealed II.http://www.doveawards.com/past- winners/ ==Critical reception== Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said of the album; \\"If Welcome Home is just judged on its sonic merits, it would be hard to distinguish this album from many other slick, sweet contemporary Christian releases, but it stands out from the pack for one simple reason: it's the solo debut album from Brian Littrell, one of the five members of the Backstreet Boys. Breaking away from that mega-successful boy band, Littrell has decided to revamp his image, if not entirely his sound, by dedicating himself to Christian music. Since many modern CCM albums aren't that far removed, at least in production terms, from mainstream pop, it's an easy transition for Littrell, and Welcome Home would be equally at home on either CCM or adult contemporary radio, since its smooth, polished surfaces go down easily. There's a preponderance of ballads here, balanced by the occasional surging anthem like \\"I'm Alive\\" and insistent pop tunes like \\"My Answer Is You,\\" but there's not a great distance between these extremes. All the songs blend together pleasantly, and if no individual song particularly distinguishes itself—the smooth jazz vibe of \\"We Lift You Up\\" comes the closest—they do all fit together to make a comforting, relaxing listen that establishes Littrell as a credible CCM vocalist, even if it doesn't necessarily go a long way to establish a distinctive musical personality of his own.\\" ==Track listingPersonnel== Adapted credits from the liner notes of Welcome Home. ;Vocals *Lead vocals – Brian Littrell *Background vocals – Elicia Brown, Luke Brown, Janice Corder, Lakisha Frierson, Mark Kibble, Brian Littrell, Kimberely Mont, Tony Osborne-Varnell, Chandra Penix, Kevin Stancil, San Stancil, David Thomas, Keisha Williams ;Instruments *Bass – Chuck Butler, Chris Kent, Brent Milligan, Chris Rojas *Drums – J.

Czech is a null-subject language, i.e. the subject (including personal pronouns) can be omitted if known from context. The person is expressed by the verb: :já dělám = dělám = I do :on dělal = dělal = he was doing ==Infinitive== The infinitive is formed by the ending -t, formerly also -ti; on some words -ct (-ci): :být - to be, jít - to go, péct - to bake Somewhat archaically: :býti - to be, jíti - to go, péci - to bake ==Participles== Participles are used for forming the past tense, conditionals and the passive voice in Czech. They are related to the short forms of adjectives. Therefore unlike other verb forms, they also express gender which must correspond with the gender of the subject. ===Past participle=== The past participle (also known as the \\"active participle\\" or \\"l-participle\\") is used for forming the past tense and the conditionals. {class= - colspan=3 align=center Singular colspan=3 align=center Plural Rowspan=2 align=center English - !Masculine !Feminine !Neuter !Masculine animate !Masculine inanimate & feminine !Neuter - byl dělal byla dělala bylo dělalo byli dělali byly dělaly byla dělala was/were did } ===Passive participle=== The passive participle is also called \\"n/t-participle\\" and is used for forming the passive voice. There are two types of endings: {class= - colspan=3 align=center Singular colspan=3 align=center Plural Rowspan=2 align=center English - !Masculine !Feminine !Neuter !Masculine animate !Masculine inanimate & Feminine !Neuter - bit dělán bita dělána bito děláno biti děláni bity dělány bita dělána beaten, battered done } === Agreement between subject and predicate === The predicate must always be in accordance with the subject in the sentence – in number and person (personal pronouns), and with past and passive participles also in gender. This grammatical principle affects the orthography (see also Czech orthography) – it is especially important for the correct choice and writing of plural endings of participles. Examples: {class= - !Gender !Sg. !Pl. !English - !masculine animate pes byl koupen psi byli koupeni a dog was bought/dogs were bought - !masculine inanimate hrad byl koupen hrady byly koupeny a castle was bought/castles were bought - !feminine kočka byla koupena kočky byly koupeny a cat was bought/cats were bought - !neuter město bylo koupeno města byla koupena a town was bought/towns were bought } The example mentioned shows both past (byl, byla ...) and passive (koupen, koupena ...) participles. The accordance in gender takes effect in the past tense and the passive voice, not in the present and future tenses in active voice. If the complex subject is a combination of nouns of different genders, masculine animate gender is prior to others and the masculine inanimate and feminine genders are prior to the neuter gender. Examples: :muži a ženy byli - men and women were :kočky a koťata byly - cats and kittens were :my jsme byli (my = we all/men) vs. my jsme byly (my = we women) - we were Priority of genders: :masculine animate > masculine inanimate & feminine > neuter ==Transgressives== The transgressive (přechodník) expresses an action which happens coincidentally with or foregoing some other action. The transgressive (přechodník) is an archaic form of the verb in the Czech and Slovak languages. Nowadays, it is used only occasionally for artistic purposes or in unchanging expressions. Transgressives were still used quite widely in Czech literature in the beginning of the 20th century (not in the spoken language). For example, Jaroslav Hašek's The Good Soldier Švejk contains a lot of them. The Czech language recognizes present and past transgressives. The present transgressive can express present or future action according to the aspect of the verb it is derived from. The past transgressive is usually derived from perfective verbs. {  - ! ! masculine ! feminine + neuter ! plural - ! present transgressive  –e –a  –íc –ouc  –íce –ouce - ! past transgressive  –v –×  –vši –ši  –vše –še } Examples: * Usednuvši u okna, začala plakat. (Having sat down at a window, she began to cry.) – past transgressive (foregoing action) * Děti, vidouce babičku, vyběhly ven. (The children, seeing grandma, ran out.) – present transgressive (coincident action/process) ==Aspect== Czech verbs are distinguished by aspect, they are either perfective or imperfective. Perfective verbs indicate the finality of the process. Therefore, they cannot express the present tense. Perfective verbs are usually formed adding prefixes to imperfective verbs: :psát (imperf.) - to write, to be writing -> napsat (perf.) - to write down Some perfective verbs are not formally related to imperfective ones: :brát (imperf.) - to take, to be taking -> vzít (perf.) - to take ==Tenses== Czech verbs express three absolute tenses - past, present and future. Relativity can be expressed by the aspect, sentence constructions and participles. The present tense can be expressed in imperfective verbs only. ===Present tense=== The present tense is formed by special endings: {class= - !Person !Singular !Plural - !1.  -u/-i/-m  -eme/-íme/-áme - !2.  -eš/-íš/-áš  -ete/-íte/-áte - !3.  -e/-í/-á  -ejí/-ějí/-í/-ou/-ají } Verbs are divided into 5 classes according to the way of forming the present tense. They are described in more detail below. ===Past tense=== The past tense is formed by the past participle (in a proper gender form) and present forms of the verb být (to be) which are omitted in the 3rd person. The following example is for the male gender (animate in plural): {class= - !Person !Singular !Plural - !1.  dělal jsem  dělali jsme - !2.  dělal jsi  dělali jste - !3.  dělal  dělali } Dělat - to do For the choice of past tense form when the number or gender of the subject may not be clear, see . ===Future tense=== In imperfective verbs, it is formed by the future forms of the verb být (to be) and the infinitive: {class= - !Person !Singular !Plural - !1.  budu dělat  budeme dělat - !2.  budeš dělat  budete dělat - !3.  bude dělat  budou dělat } Dělat – to do Budu, budeš, ... with infinitive has the same meaning as “(I, you, ...) will” in English. If not followed by an infinitive, it means “(I, you, ...) will be” (i.e. I will be = budu, not budu být). In some verbs of motion, the future tense is formed by adding the prefix po-/pů- to the present form: :půjdu – I will go, ponesu – I will carry, povezu – I will transport (in a vehicle) In perfective verbs, the present form expresses the future. Compare: :budu dělat – I will be doing :udělám – I will do, I will have done === Tenses in subordinate clauses === There is no sequence of tenses in Czech. The types of clauses like in the indirect speech use tenses that express the time which is spoken about. The tense of the subordinate clause is not shifted to the past even though there is the past tense in the main clause: :Říká, že nemá dost peněz. (present tense) – He says he doesn′t have enough money. :Říkal, že nemá dost peněz. (present tense) – He said he didn′t have enough money. :Říkal, že Petr přišel v pět hodin. (past tense) – He said Peter had come at five o′clock. :Říkal, že to udělá v pátek. (future tense) – He said he would do it on Friday. ==Imperative== The imperative mood is formed for the 2nd person singular and plural and the 1st person plural. In the 2nd person singular, it takes either null ending or -i/-ej ending, according to the verb class. The 2nd person plural takes the ending -te/-ete/-ejte and the 1st person plural takes -me/-eme/-ejme. Examples: :buď! buďte! (be!) buďme! (let's be!) :spi! spěte! (sleep!) spěme! (let's sleep!) :dělej! dělejte! (do!) dělejme! (let's do!) ==Conditionals== The conditionals are formed by the past participle and special forms of the verb být (to be). Following example of the present conditional is for the male gender (animate in plural): {class= - !Person !Singular !Plural - !1.  dělal bych  dělali bychom - !2.  dělal bys  dělali byste - !3.  dělal by  dělali by } dělal bych - I would do There is also the past conditional in Czech but it is usually replaced by the present conditional. {class= - !Person !Singular !Plural - !1.  byl bych dělal  byli bychom dělali - !2.  byl bys dělal  byli byste dělali - !3.  byl by dělal  byli by dělali } byl bych dělal - I would have done By also becomes a part of conjugations aby (so that) and kdyby (if). Therefore, these conjunctions take the same endings: :Kdybych nepracoval, nedostal bych výplatu. If I didn't work, I would get no wages. ==Passive voice== There are two ways to form the passive voice in Czech: 1\\\\. By the verb být (to be) and the passive participle: :Město bylo založeno ve 14. století. The town was founded in the 14th century. 2\\\\. By adding the reflexive pronoun se: :Ono se to neudělalo. It has not been done. :To se vyrábí v Číně. It is produced in China. However, the use of se is not exclusive to the passive voice. ==Reflexive verbs== Reflexive pronouns se and si are components of reflexive verbs (se/si is not usually translated into English): :posadit se - to sit down :myslet si - to think, to suppose ==Negation== Negation is formed by the prefix ne-. In the future tense and the passive voice it is added to the auxiliary verb být (to be). :nedělat - not to do :nedělám - I do not do :nedělej! do not do! :nedělal jsem - I did not do :nebudu dělat - I will not do :nedělal bych - I would not do :byl bych neudělal or nebyl bych udělal - I would not have done :není děláno - it is not done Unlike English, a negative pronoun must be used with a negative verb (using a positive verb is ungrammatical) (double negative): :Nic nemám. - I have nothing. (literally I do not have nothing.) :Nikdy to nikomu neříkej. - Never say it to anybody.

Additional ingredients and occasional add-ins may be incorporated, such as ground almonds or semolina flour. It is prepared in stages, with the cookie-like shortbread base baked first, followed by the caramel and chocolate. ==History== Some of the first known recipes and references are in Australian journals and cookbooks from the 1970s, most notably in The Australian Women's Weekly, where it is known as \\"caramel slice\\". The alternative name \\"millionaire's shortbread\\" seems to have originated in Scotland. Highlighting just how popular this confection has become outside of Australia and Britain, it was featured in a 2018 episode of America's Test Kitchen. ==Recipe== The original recipe from \\"The Australian Women's Weekly\\" * Base: Cream 125g of butter and 1/4 cup of sugar. Slowly sift in 1 cup of plain flour and knead until combined. Press into 28cm x 18cm (11in x 7in) tin and bake in moderate oven for 20 minutes or until golden brown. * Caramel: Meanwhile, combine 400g of sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 cup of sugar, 3 tbs golden syrup and 125g of butter over low heat until butter melts and sugar is dissolved. Continue to stir and increase to boil and then reduce to simmer stirring constantly for approx five minutes or until golden brown. Pour the caramel over cooled base and refrigerate. * Icing: Melt 90g of chocolate (milk/dark) and 30g of butter and stir until combined. Pour over cold caramel mixture and refrigerate until icing is hard. * Cut: Slice is typically cut into 3 inch squares. Note: Australian baking tablespoons are 20ml (4 5ml tsp), so in total 60ml golden syrup is used. Butter can be replaced with margarine. 1 Australian baking cup is 250ml, or 150g of flour. ==Variations== Some variations include chocolate caramel slice, chocolate coconut caramel slice, caramel macadamia slice, caramel shortbread slice, and sticky salted caramel apple slice. ==See also== * Shortcake * List of shortbread biscuits and cookies ==References== Category:Australian cuisine Category:Australian desserts Category:Biscuits (British style) Category:Shortbread ","title":"Caramel shortbread"},{"id":"6199565","text":"Cross Creek, Florida, 1965 Cross Creek is an unincorporated community in Alachua County, Florida, United States. It is located on Cross Creek, a short stream connecting Orange and Lochloosa lakes. ==Geography== Cross Creek is located at . The community is situated in the extreme southeastern corner of Alachua County and is approximately 20 miles southeast of the county seat, Gainesville, and 24 miles north of Ocala in Marion County. It is bisected by a navigable waterway, Cross Creek, which connects the two large lakes of Orange and Lochloosa, thus the community is on a narrow isthmus between these two water bodies. ==History== Cross Creek is well known as the home of the American author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. She wrote four of her books while actually living there, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Yearling, which was adapted as the 1946 film of the same name, and her memoir, Cross Creek, which was adapted as the 1983 film. Cross Creek was settled in the 19th century. Rawlings house may have been built in the 1880s. Rawlings reported that Cross Creek was home to just seven families, five white and two black, when she moved there in 1928. The roads were unpaved and there was no electrical power or ice available. Electrical power lines reached Cross Creek in 1948. The road through Cross Creek (Alachua County Road 325), was paved about the same time, after World War II. The road to Micanopy, the River Styx Road (Alachua County Road 346), was not paved until 1962. The population of Cross Creek began to grow during the 1950s and 1960s when local man Ben Wheeler dug canals and built a number of houses, many with waterfronts. A number of people moved into \\"The Creek\\" from other areas including the northern United States, thus the 'cracker' character of \\"The Creek\\" was permanently altered. By the late twentieth century the community would have been nearly unrecognizable to Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. The unique geographical environs and the presence of a few older houses (including Mrs. Rawlings' home, now both a Florida State Park and a National Historic Site), have helped Cross Creek to retain some local color. ==Education== The nearest public high school and elementary school are in Hawthorne, fifteen miles distant. There is a charter school in Micanopy, nine miles away. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Alachua County, Florida Category:Gainesville metropolitan area, Florida Category:Unincorporated communities in Florida ","title":"Cross Creek, Florida"},{"id":"6199577","text":"Johannes of Jerusalem (1042–1119), born Jehan de Vezelay, was the abbot of the monastery at Vézelay, France. ==References *http://www.roypanther.de/Propheten/J_v_Jerusalem/j_v_jerusalem.html *https://web.archive.org/web/20070929044318/http://www.weltnetz- verweise.de/informatives/11-09-05-jvj.html Category:Prophets Category:1042 births Category:1119 deaths ","title":"Johannes of Jerusalem"},{"id":"6199582","text":"\\"Do Not Disturb\\" is a song recorded by English girl group Bananarama. It was written and produced by the production duo of Steve Jolley and Tony Swain. Originally released as a stand-alone single in 1985, the track was later added to Bananarama's third album True Confessions which was issued by London Records a year later. \\"Do Not Disturb\\" was released in the UK, Australia, Germany and Japan but only charted in the UK. Bananarama did not like the song. Group member Keren Woodward later said of the True Confessions album, \\"It is all our ideas, it is what we wanted to sound like and sing about. Except 'Do Not Disturb' which Swain and Jolley wrote and which we don't think is very good. Thats why there's eleven songs on the LP instead of ten\\". When released, \\"Do Not Disturb\\" was a mid-charting single, peaking at number thirty-one. The song was also issued as 3 separate shaped picture discs, each featuring a member of the group, which came with a plinth to put them on display. ==Music video== The music video for \\"Do Not Disturb\\" directed by Simon Milne features Bananarama in a brightly lit hotel clad in long white flowing dresses and blouses similar to the single's picture sleeve. The video also cuts frequently to a set with Bananarama dancing, and doing football tricks with superimposed circular footage.

Hydrogen technologies are applicable for many uses. Some hydrogen technologies are carbon neutral and could have a role in preventing climate change and a possible future hydrogen economy. Hydrogen is a chemical widely used in various applications including ammonia production, oil refining and energy. Hydrogen is not a primary energy source, because it is not naturally occurring as a fuel. It is, however, widely regarded as an ideal energy storage medium, due to the ease with which electric power can convert water into its hydrogen and oxygen components through electrolysis and can be converted back to electrical power using a fuel cell. There are a wide number of different types of fuel and electrolysis cells. The potential environmental impact depends primarily on the methods used to generate the hydrogen fuel. ==Fuel cells== *Alkaline fuel cell (AFC) *Direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC) *Direct carbon fuel cell (DCFC) *Direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) *Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) *Electro-galvanic fuel cell (EGFC) *Flow battery (RFC) *Formic acid fuel cell (FAFC) *Metal hydride fuel cell (MHFC) *Microbial fuel cell (MFC) *Molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) *Phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) *Photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) *Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) *Protonic ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) *Regenerative fuel cell (RFC) *Solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) ==Hydrogen infrastructure== *Hydrogen pipeline transport *Hydrogen pressure letdown station *Compressed hydrogen tube trailer *Liquid hydrogen tank truck *Hydrogen piping *Hydrogen station *HCNG *Homefueler *Home Energy Station *Hydrogen highway *Zero Regio *Hydrogen compressor *Electrochemical hydrogen compressor *Guided rotor compressor *Hydride compressor *Ionic liquid piston compressor *Linear compressor *Hydrogen turboexpander-generator *Hydrogen leak testing *Hydrogen sensor *Hydrogen purifier *Hydrogen analyzer *Hydrogen valve ===Hydrogen storage=== *Compressed hydrogen *Cryo-adsorption *Liquid hydrogen *Slush hydrogen *Underground hydrogen storage *Hydrogen tank *Power to gas ==Hydrogen vehiclesHistoric hydrogen filled airships=== *Hindenburg (airship) *Zeppelin ===Hydrogen powered cars=== Hydrogen fueling nozzle Audi: * 2004 – Audi A2H2-hybrid vehicle * 2009 – Audi Q5-FCEVnetinform: Hydrogen and Fuel Cells BMW: * 2002 – BMW 750hl * 2010 – BMW 1 Series Fuel-cell hybrid electricnetinform: Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Chrysler: * 2000 – Jeep Commander II-hybrid vehicle-Commercial * 2001 – Chrysler Natrium-hybrid vehicle * 2003 – Jeep Treo-Fuel cell Daimler: * 1994 – Mercedes-Benz NECAR 1 * 1996 – Mercedes- Benz NECAR 2 * 1997 – Mercedes-Benz NECAR 3 * 1999 – Mercedes-Benz NECAR 4 * 2000 – Mercedes-Benz NECAR 5 * 2002 – Mercedes-Benz F-Cell based on the Mercedes-Benz A-Class * 2005 – Mercedes-Benz F600 Hygenius * 2009 – Mercedes- Benz F-CELL Roadster * 2009 – Mercedes-Benz F-Cell based on the Mercedes-Benz B-Classnetinform: Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Fiat: * 2001 – Fiat Seicento Elettra H2 Fuel Cell-hybrid vehicle * 2003 – Fiat Seicento Hydrogen-hybrid vehicle * 2005 – Fiat Panda Hydrogen-Fuel cell * 2008 – Fiat Phyllis-Fuel cell * 2008 – Fiat Panda-Fiat Panda HyTRANnetinform: Hydrogen and Fuel Cells Ford: * 2000 – Ford Focus FCV-Fuel cell.

It is estimated that at least 147 civilians, who had taken refuge from the fighting inside the church, died as a result of this incident. The victims included men, women and children.1995 Human Rights report – South Asia ==Background== This incident occurred during a phase of the Sri Lankan Civil War when the Sri Lankan military were on the offensive to retake the Jaffna peninsula. This operation was already highlighted by the use of intense artillery shelling and aerial bombardment.UTHR Bulletin # 17 As part of precautions to avoid civilian casualties the military had distributed leaflets requesting minority Sri Lankan Tamil civilians take shelter at places of worship. For their safety hundreds of civilians had taken refuge in the church.1995 HRW report – Sri Lanka ==Incident== The Church of St. Peter and Paul in Navaly (also spelled Navali) on the Jaffna peninsula was bombed by a Sri Lankan military aircraft on the afternoon of 9 July 1995. Several hundred Tamil civilians were taking refuge at the church and surrounding environs at the time. According to Daya Somasundaram, a professor of the University of Adelaide, the church was well away from the fighting. He termed this attack a war crime committed by the Sri Lankan Air Force.War more traumatic than tsunami ==Initial reports== The news of the incident was first broken by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which at the time was the only aid agency working in the Tamil areas. The ICRC helped evacuate many of the wounded by ambulance to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital. Immediate casualties were given as 65 killed and over 150 injured, including men, women and children. Eventually this figure rose to 147 killed, as many succumbed to their injuries, partly because the hospital was unable to cope with so many casualties at one time. ==Aftermath== The Sri Lankan government initially denied any knowledge of the bombing, and then claimed it could have been LTTE mortars that caused the damage. The Commander of the Sri Lankan Air Force stated they exploded LTTE ammunition trucks or underground ammunition storage and that the deaths of the civilians were caused by secondary explosions of underground LTTE ammunition dumps. However, in a later report, the ICRC head in Sri Lanka, Marco Altherr, said that it was indeed bombs that had fallen on the area; he further included eyewitness accounts from civilians in the area, including a priest from another church in the vicinity, that also supported this claim. Eventually the government agreed to investigate the incident.ICRC Document The Red Cross protested in the aftermath of the attack. However, this protest was brought to a close after the members involved in the protest were summoned to the Foreign Office and asked to give it up. ==Government investigation== On 11 July, Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunge released a statement that expressed \\"sorrow at the loss of lives\\" and ordered the investigation of the bombing. On 18 July, the military confirmed that the church was badly damaged but said that they could not confirm the origin of the bombs that destroyed it. ==References== Category:1995 crimes in Sri Lanka Category:Aerial bombing in Sri Lanka Category:Attacks on buildings and structures in Sri Lanka Category:Attacks on churches Category:Attacks on civilians attributed to the Sri Lanka Air Force Category:Civilian massacres in Sri Lanka Category:Mass murder in 1995 Category:Mass murder of Sri Lankan Tamils Category:Sri Lankan government forces attacks in Eelam War II Category:Terrorist incidents in Sri Lanka in 1995 ","title":"Navaly church bombing"},{"id":"6199648","text":"Grodziec Castle with the picturesque background Grodziec Castle (German: Gröditzburg or Gröditzberg) has a history dating back to 1155 and is located in the Silesia region of Poland. ==History== The first confirmed reference of Grodziec comes from Pope Adrian IV's bull of April 23, 1155. In 1175, Prince Bolesław I the Tall drew up a privilege for Cistercians from Lubiąż at the castle. In the time of his heir, Henryk I the Bearded, the wooden terrestrial castle was replaced by the building of a brick one. The foundation of the castle church is attributed to Saint Hedwig. In the 14th and partially in the 15th centuries the castle was the property of the knightly family of Busewoy. In the period of the Hussite Wars, the building was captured and plundered by a Hussite detachment. In 1470, the Prince of Legnica, Friedrich I repurchased it. Master bricklayers brought from Wrocław and Görlitz gave the establishment its present-day spatial structure. After the Prince's death by the order of his son, Friedrich II, work on the castle continued. It then become one of the most beautiful Gothic-Renaissance residences in Silesia. The final work coincided with the wedding of the Prince to Princess Sophie von Hohenzollern. A grand feast was held in the castle and a great knightly tournament outside was arranged. In the time of the Thirty Years' War, the castle was captured and burned by the forces of Prince Albrecht von Wallenstein. Because of the amount of damage due to the war, the fortress was left with some parts of the stronghold missing. In the 17th and 18th centuries efforts were made to rebuild Grodziec, however they were not completed. The Swiss art dealer Martin Usteri acquired 32 glass panes in 1796, which were sold from his legacy in 1829, and thereafter installed in the Gröditzberg castle. From there, six of the former stained glass windows of the Augustinerkloster Zürich were bought by the Gottfried Keller Stiftung in 1894, exhibited in the cloister of the Fraumünster cathedral in Zürich, and then entrusted to the Swiss National Museum on deposit. In the 19th century, when the owner of property became Prince of the Reich Johann Heinrich IV von Hochberg from Książ, more work of preservation and reconstruction was taken up. Reconstruction was stopped during the Napoleonic Wars, but in the mid-1830s the castle became an object of many tourist excursions. At this time, it developed the reputation of being one of the most attractive historical buildings in Europe. Reconstruction was started again in the 20th century, when Dr. Baron Wilibald von Dirksen became the owner of the castle. He ordered an elaboration of the design to the most well-known and respected architect and conservator, Bodo Ebhardt, who also supervised the work. In 1908, Emperor Wilhelm II was a guest during the solemn reopening of the castle after the completion of renovations. The castle was inherited by Dirksen's son, Herbert von Dirksen, who become a prominent German diplomat serving as the ambassador to the Soviet Union, Japan and Great Britain. In 1945, the castle, with some of its possessions, was burnt. The castle was later transferred to Silesian Society of History and Antiquarianism Lovers for use as a museum, restaurant and a shelter-home. As of 2006, the castle is partly in ruins, but also features a hotel, splendid eatery services, as well as many medieval tournaments featuring jousting and sword fighting. ==See also== * List of castles in Poland == References == Category:Castles in Lower Silesian Voivodeship Category:Złotoryja County Category:Tourist attractions in Lower Silesian Voivodeship ","title":"Grodziec Castle"},{"id":"6199675","text":"The Judd A. and Marjorie Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences (WCAS or Weinberg College) is the largest of the twelve schools comprising Northwestern University, located in Evanston, Illinois and downtown Chicago, Illinois.

The band's core consists of brothers David Brewis and Peter Brewis, with Andrew Moore occasionally featured as keyboardist. Their line-up has at times featured members of both Maxïmo Park and The Futureheads. Field Music have been called one of the few bands to outlast the indie guitar band explosion of the mid-2000s. Describing the band as \\"a truly artful proposition in the pseudo-filled landscape of contemporary Brit art-rock\\", music blog The Fantastic Hope puts this down in part to their \\"un-self- conscious anti-fashion stance\\", arguing that Field Music's \\"wayward pop from the fringes of academia is one of the most worthwhile ways in which rock//indie/guitar music/white pop/whatever might evolve\\". Critics have compared their music to acts as diverse as Steely Dan, XTC, Prefab Sprout, Peter Gabriel, Scritti Politti, Talking Heads and Todd Rundgren. They have also been nominated for the Mercury Prize. ==Origins== Prior to Field Music, David Brewis was in the projects The New Tellers and Electronic Eye Machine. Several songs from these bands ended up as early Field Music recordings. His brother Peter Brewis at one time played drums for fellow Sunderland band The Futureheads. ==HistoryFirst phase (2004–2007): Field Music, Write Your Own History, Tones of Town=== Field Music released their self-titled debut album in August 2005. A collection of B-sides and earlier songs (including tracks written for The New Tellers and Electronic Eye Machine), Write Your Own History, was released in May 2006. Their second album, Tones of Town, was released on 22 January 2007. In an interview with BBC 6 Music in April 2007 the band claimed they were intending to split once the promotional engagements for Tones of Town were completed in June 2007. > \\"We basically want to do things that aren't classed as 'Field Music indie > band'. We're not going to be a band for a bit. But Field Music aren't going > to be over because we've already got a bank account under the name, so we'll > just continue as a company. It's time to go and do some real work.\\" ===Hiatus of Field Music brand (2007–2009): The Week That Was, introduction of School of Language=== Field Music later confirmed that the band had not split, addressing the hiatus on their official website. Under the name School of Language, David Brewis released the solo album Sea from Shore in February 2008 through Memphis Industries (in the UK and Ireland) and Thrill Jockey Records (in the US and Europe), while Peter Brewis recorded an album under the name The Week That Was. The self-titled album The Week That Was was released on 18 August 2008, also with Memphis Industries, and featured both David Brewis and Andrew Moore on some tracks. ===Second phase (2009–2013): Field Music (Measure), Plumb=== In an interview with Stereogum in July 2009, the band confirmed that they had reunited (minus Andrew Moore) and were busy recording a third Field Music record. The 20-song double album, titled Field Music (Measure) was released through Memphis Industries in February, 2010 (15 February in the UK, 16 February in the US). The band was chosen by Belle & Sebastian to perform at their second Bowlie Weekender festival presented by All Tomorrow's Parties in the UK in December 2010. Their fourth album, Plumb, was released on 13 February 2012. It was preceded by the song \\"(I Keep Thinking About) A New Thing\\", available as a free download from their website. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize that year. In an interview with Songfacts.com, guitarist and producer Al Kooper said that Field Music is his favourite new band. ===Third phase (2013–present): Music for Drifters, Old Fears, Commontime, Open Here, Making a New World=== Field Music in Kendal 2020 In September 2013, it was revealed that Field Music had composed a soundtrack for the 1929 silent documentary Drifters. The film, which originally premiered alongside Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin, was made by pioneering Scottish director John Grierson and follows the working day of a herring fishing fleet as it sets sail from the Shetland Islands. Field Music premiered the work with a live performance and screening for Berwick Film and Media Arts Festival. This commission saw the original line-up of Peter Brewis, David Brewis and Andrew Moore reunite for the first time since 2007. A subsequent screening and performance took place at London's Islington Assembly Hall in November 2013. David Brewis played as a member of the touring band for former Fiery Furnaces singer Eleanor Friedberger on her UK tour in the summer of 2013. He released a second School of Language album – Old Fears – in April 2014. Both David Brewis and Peter Brewis joined their former bass player Ian Black in the band SLUG, touring as support to Hyde & Beast in the autumn of 2014. Peter Brewis also released an album, Frozen by Sight, in collaboration with Maxïmo Park's Paul Smith on 17 November 2014. This consisted of 'baroque-pop' compositions by Brewis with edited excerpts of Paul Smith's travel writing sung in Recitative. A live performance of the album was staged, with other musicians including a string section, at Gateshead's Sage. In November 2015, Prince posted a link to Field Music's then-newly released single \\"The Noisy Days Are Over\\" on his Twitter feed. In February 2016 the band released their sixth album as Field Music, Commontime. They performed two songs from the album—including \\"Disappointed\\", which featured in the \\"live\\" edition of the programme—in the second episode of the 48th series of the BBC music show Later... with Jools Holland. The performance was cited in a BBC poll as one of the highlights of the series. Early in 2016, the band completed their first UK tour in four years. It was followed up by a US tour, which included dates in Washington, Philadelphia, New York, Boston and Seattle. They also played in California for the first time since the tour to promote 2007's Tones of Town. In 2016, Field Music worked with Newcastle duo Warm Digits on the soundtrack for the film Asunder, directed by Esther Johnson, commissioned as part of the 14-18 NOW series of events to commemorate the centenary of World War 1. Writing for The Guardian, the film's creative producer, Bob Stanley revealed that the compositions, which were scored for the Northern Sinfonia by Peter Brewis, had been inspired by Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Messiaen. A seventh album, Open Here, was released in February 2018. The Guardian described it as a \\"grand masterclass in terrific tune-making\\". An eighth album, Making a New World, was released on 10 January 2020.

This field has roots in two major developments in the intellectual history of law—first, the growing doubt about whether law in isolation is a source of value and meaning, or whether it must be plugged into a large cultural or philosophical or social-science context to give it value and meaning; and, second, the growing focus on the mutability of meaning in all texts, whether literary or legal. Those who work in the field stress one or the other of two complementary perspectives: Law in literature (understanding enduring issues as they are explored in great literary texts) and law as literature (understanding legal texts by reference to methods of literary interpretation, analysis, and critique). This movement has broad and potentially far reaching implications with regards to future teaching methods, scholarship, and interpretations of legal texts. Combining literature's ability to provide unique insight into the human condition through text with the legal framework that regulates those human experiences in reality gives a democratic judiciary a new and dynamic approach to reaching the aims of providing a just and moral society. It is necessary, in practical thought and discussion about the use of legal rhetoric, to understand text's role in defining human experience. == History of the movement == Perhaps first to envision the movement were John Wigmore and Benjamin Cardozo, who acknowledged \\"novelists and poets\\" as the principal teachers of law in the first half of the 20th century. Most scholars, however, credit James Boyd White as the founder of the law and literature movement because of the dedicated research and distinguished publications he has contributed to this rapidly growing field. Among his many literary books and articles, White's most renowned publication, The Legal Imagination, is often credited with initiating the law and literature movement. This book, first published in 1973, is a fusion of anthology and critique, superficially resembling a traditional legal casebook but drawing on a much wider and more diverse range of sources, with headnotes and questions emphasizing the relationship of legal texts to literary analysis and literary texts to the legal issues that they explore. The movement began attracting attention in the 1970s and by the 1980s had gained substantial ground in academia. The proponents of the law-in-literature theory, such as Richard Weisberg and Robert Weisberg, believe that literary works, especially narratives centered on a legal conflict, will offer lawyers and judges insight into the \\"nature of law\\" that would otherwise go missing in the traditionally strict study of legal rhetoric. In its early stages, the law and literature movement focused strictly on the law in literature theory; however, beginning in the late 1970s the law as literature perspective began to gain popularity. This perspective seeks to enhance legal studies by examining and interpreting legal texts using the techniques of literary critics. Scholars such as White and Ronald Dworkin find greater relevance in law as literature because it maintains that the meaning of legal texts, such as written law, like any other genre of literature, can only be discovered through interpretation. Although legal scholars have long considered both literary and legal texts in their study of the legal process, the recent degree to which the two seemingly separate genres interact has sparked great debates among scholars. == Law in literature == The law in literature view is specifically concerned with the way in which legal situations are presented in literature. Generally, they place a high value on the \\"independent\\" view from which literary writers are able to see the law. They believe that such authors have a lesson to teach legal scholars and lawyers alike about the human condition, and the law's effect on it. Such scholars tend to cite authors like Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, Herman Melville, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Charles Dickens. The fictional situations presented in literature, these scholars assert, can tell a great deal about political and social situations, and the individual that often find themselves before the court. For example, Robert Weisberg believes that the law in literature offers fertile possibilities. He suggests that even though some literature cannot instruct its readers about legal situations, they can still educate law students about the human condition. Richard H. Weisberg, professor at Cardozo School of Law is another leading scholar of law and literature. Following the lead of James Boyd White, he sees an intrinsic value in the use of literature as a means of discussing legal topics. Unlike White however, who places value on literature for its ability to stimulate critical thought and theory, Weisberg believes that literature should be valued for its ability to cause one to relate to others, and for the political and social contexts that novels, particularly those dealing with the law, grapple with. For Weisberg, this is reason enough for its justification in the legal arena because such novels cause their students to reach conclusions regarding human understanding. In his study Poethics, Weisberg states that, \\"Poethics in its attention to legal communication and to the plight of those who are 'other', seeks to revitalize the ethical component of the law.\\" Richard Weisberg's interest in the law and literature movement might be seen as slightly different than that of White, who places emphasis on the rhetorical techniques and abilities that literature utilizes. Weisberg rather wishes to use literature as a way of critiquing social institutions and legal norms. For him it is the subject matter of novels and not their rhetorical tools that make them important in instructing law students, as well as furthering understanding of legal matters for the independent law scholar. One example of his attempting to validate his stance of the effect of novels onto legal minds, is one where Weisberg cites a real life French lawyer living in France during the beginning of the deportation of French Jews to concentration camps. The lawyer was attempting to assign the duty of determining Jewry of an individual with only two Jewish grandparents to the state, then controlled by the Nazis and collaborators. In describing the words chosen by the lawyer, Weisberg believes that the \\"masking of a moral crime\\" is a direct descendant of Nietzschean ressentiment, which is widely believed to be a philosophical outlook that permeates through the writings of Albert Camus and Kafka-literary authors whose works law and literature proponents cite often, including Weisberg. His belief that ressentiment makes its way into the writings of lawyers, such as this Frenchman, is seen as enough of a reason for him to view legal novels as compelling arguments of the human condition and thus their validity towards legal debate. == Law as literature == Law as literature scholars see value in the techniques employed by literary scholars. Generally speaking, these scholars may see legal text as a form of literature thus making literary critique and analysis of it possible. Unlike the law in literature scholars, these minds only see possibilities in the tools of literary theory, and not really the subject of the great novel that law students often find themselves reading, although most might agree that literature serves a purpose that allows for ethical development and growth within the student. Benjamin N. Cardozo was a proponent of law as literature. \\"The success of Cardozo's books was also due in part to their distinction as literature. Convinced that style could not be separated from substance, Cardozo brought the Judicial process to life in lucid, eloquent prose sprinkled with humor, anecdotes, and practical allusions.\\" (enotes.com, Benjamin Nathan Cardozo 1870–1938) While James Boyd White acknowledges the relevance of the law-in-literature perspective, he finds law-as-literature more tenable because of the position's ability to combine the two seemingly disparate disciplines and allow for text to fulfill its role of defining culture and creating relationships. According to White, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice Ronald Dworkin also supports the arguments in favor of the use of literature to improve legal understanding. In his article, Law as Interpretation, Dworkin stated, \\"I propose that we can improve our understanding of law by comparing legal interpretation with interpretation in other fields of knowledge, particularly literature.\\" He believes that our interpretations of literary works may help us to an improved understanding of our cultural environment, which in turn helps us to come to a better understanding and interpretation of the law. ==Law and Literature in Europe== The Law and Literature movement in Europe is wide-ranging and fruitful and a number of networks in Europe are significant to the movement. There is for example a European Network for Law and Literature Scholarship run by Jeanne Gaakeer, Professor at the Erasmus University Rotterdam, and Greta Olson, Professor at the Justus-Liebig Universität Giessen. Gaakeer's influence is also reflected in her publications, for example Hope Springs Eternal: An Introduction to the Work of James Boyd White (University of Michigan, 1998), and she is co-editor of Crossing Borders: law, language and Literature, Wolf Legal Publishers The Netherlands, 2008. Greta Olsen has edited a number of books including 9/11 Ten Years On (2011) and Current Trends in Narratology. Berlin and New York: De Gruyter, 2011 and In the Grip of the Law: Trials, Prisons and the Space Between. Frankfurt: Peter Lang, 2004a. There is also a Nordic Network for Law and Literature and two Italian Networks for Law and Literature, AIDEL and ISLL. In Norway: The Bergen School of Law and Literature, directed by Professor Arild Linneberg, Faculty of Humanities, Department of Linguistic, Literary and Aesthetic Studies, University of Bergen. Law and Literature in Europe is energetic but at times less self- promoting than its American counterpart. Greta Olson's article \\"De- Americanising Law and Literature Narratives: Opening Up the Story' in the journal Law and Literature 2010 (published by Cardozo in the USA) provides a reminder of scholarly activity in Europe as well as warning against a \\"tendency to universalise our scholarly narratives\\" where some debates are particular to the American setting. She calls upon European scholars to \\"remember that the peculiarities of our own legal systems and legal histories need to be kept in mind as we contest law with the aesthetic and use law to query the literary\\". Post-conference productions such as the Oxford University Press collection Law and Literature: Current Legal Issues Volume 2: Law and (1999) edited by Michael Freeman and Andrew Lewis are testament to the number of approaches opened up by this interdisciplinary approach. In the United Kingdom, scholars of note include Maria Aristodemou, with her Law and Literature from her to eternity, which looks at a number of texts from ancient Greek to modern day novels from a feminist and postmodern perspective. Adam Gearey's Law and Aesthetics provides a discussion of aesthetics and ethics relevant to contemporary law and literature scholarship, and to the development of postmodern jurisprudence, using a range of reference points from classical literature, from Sophocles to Shelley to Nietzsche. Professor Ian Ward, Law and Literature: Possibilities and Perspectives, which considers a range of texts from Shakespeare, to children's literature, to Ivan Klima and Umberto Eco and, more recently Ward's Law, Text, Terror, looking at the phenomena of terror and the rhetoric of terrorism tracing back through literature, popular culture and politics. Professor Melanie Williams; book Empty Justice: One Hundred Years of Law, Literature and Philosophy explores in particular feminist and existential questions as well as genre movements relating to caselaw combined with works by, for example, Thomas Hardy, J. G. Ballard, John Fowles, J. M. Coetzee, Virginia Woolf and Iris Murdoch, while her Secrets and Laws provides a range of essays on legal and political issues of note, from ethics, terrorism and identity to notions of obscenity, rape, sex and violence, through the prism of poetry, W. H. Auden and R. S. Thomas as well as 19th and 20th century works of fiction. Kieran Dolin's A Critical Introduction to Law and Literature takes in a wide range of historical periods from Renaissance literature to Victorian literature and modern texts, exploring a number of topical approaches to crime, feminism, race and colonialism, while Paul Raffield's Shakespeare's Imaginary Constitution : late Elizabethan politics and the theatre of law (Hart, 2010) is an addition to the critical work available on Shakespeare and the Law. The Italian law and literature scholar Daniela Carpi has also written a book on Shakespeare and the Law as well as an interesting text discussing Plato's relevance to 20th century English Literature. These instances of European outputs in the Law and Literature movement are in no way representative of the large literature to be found in articles written by the above named scholars as well as others in the field. ==Significant contributions to the movement Jack Balkin === Jack Balkin is a professor of constitutional law at Yale Law School. While his work in legal rhetoric draws on literary theory, he contends that law is best analogized to the performing arts such as music and drama, rather than to literature. For this reason, there is little to no work in which Balkin analyzes literature's relevance to the law, but his applications of the argument through other artistic mediums gain him admission to this discussion, as well. In his views on politics and its effect on legal standards, Balkin adheres to what is known as \\"partisan entrenchment\\". This theory states that the party that controls the White House can place in the federal courts judges and justices that share the President's political views. This in turn affects Supreme Court justices and, ultimately, constitutional doctrine. === Daniela Carpi === Daniela Carpi is Professor of English Literature at the Department of Foreign Literatures and Languages of the University of Verona. She started her career at the University of Bologna. Her fields of research are: Renaissance theatre, Postmodern fiction, literature and visual arts, the influence of Plato on twentieth-century English literature, law and literature. She started working on law and literature in the 1990s and introduced the topic in Italy. In 2008 she founded AIDEL Associazione Italiana di Diritto e Letteratura, which she presides and which gathers a large number of members from all over the world. In 2007 she founded the journal Pólemos, a Journal of Law Literature and culture, now published by DeGruyter (Berlin/Boston). Together with professor Klaus Stierstorfer from the University of Muenster she edits the series Law and Literature, also for DeGruyter. She also edits two series with an Italian publisher (Ombre Corte in Verona), \\"Culture\\" and \\"Agon\\". She has directed several international projects on \\"Law and the Image\\", \\"Human Rights\\", \\"Bioethics, biolaw and literature\\", \\"Law and Culture\\", and in particular one on \\"Law and equity\\" which was financed by the Italian Ministry for Culture MIUR. Among her latest publications: Daniela Carpi ed., Bioethics and Biolaw Through Literature, DeGruyter 2011; Daniela Carpi and Jeanne Gaakeer eds., Liminal Discourses. Sublime Tensions in Law and Literature, DeGruyter, 2013; Daniela Carpi ed., The Concept of Equity in Law and Literature: An Interdisciplinary Assessment, Winter, 2007; Practising Equity, Addressing Law: Equity in Law and Literature, Winter, 2008; Why Plato? The Influence of Plato on twentieth-century English Literature, Winter, 2005, and co-editet with Marett Leiboff: Fables of the Law.Fairy Tales in a Legal Context. De Gruyter 2016, === Adam Gearey === Adam Gearey is Reader in Law at Birkbeck School of Law, University of London. He has a BA (Hons-English/History) (University of York), M.A. Socio-Legal Studies (University of Sheffield), CPE/LSF (Manchester Polytechnic), PhD (Birkbeck College, University of London). He was appointed as a lecturer at Kent Law School in 1996, moving to the School of Law at Birkbeck in 1998. In 2001-2002, he was a visiting professor in the Faculty of Law at Makerere University, Uganda; and in 2003 a visiting professor at the University of Pretoria. He is currently a visiting scholar at The Center for Law and Society, University of California, Berkeley and a visiting professor at the University of Peace, Costa Rica. His present project concerns political justice. In The Times Higher Education, Gearey commented on his work on James Joyce's chaotic novel, Finnegans Wake, and ideas of law, stating I tried to trace the ways the account of the giving of the law in the Bible fed into the narratives of Finnegans Wake. Just as the Bible appropriated the Jewish Old Test-ament account of the law, Joyce's novel, in its turn, rewrote the Gospel narratives, to become a messianic announcement of the female messiah and a new law of love. These ideas could not have been thought without the encouragement of the \\"critical legal theory\\" scene. ..But it would be wrong to see this as a \\"movement\\". It is an impossible community of those who disagree as much as they agree. Leaning to broadly continental traditions of thought, to psychoanalysis, post-Marxism and feminism, there is a strong sense of sustained and creative dialogue in \\"critical\\" circles. The revolution in legal thought is still to come. === Eric Heinze === Eric Heinze is Professor of Law & Humanities at the School of Law, Queen Mary, University of London. In The Concept of InjusticeThe Concept of Injustice (Routledge, 2013) he presents a literary approach to reasoning about justice. He calls that standpoint \\"post- classical\\", in contrast to a \\"classical\\" Western tradition, dating back to Plato's Republic, which assumes a static, logical opposition between the concepts of \\"justice\\" and \\"injustice\\". Heinze's \\"post-classical\\" approach recognises the impossibility of theorising justice and injustice as mutually exclusive categories. Central to Heinze's research is the thesis that law is constantly underpinned by necessary, yet conflicting and irreconcilable theories of its own legitimacy.\\"Power Politics and the Rule of Law: Shakespeare's First Historical Tetralogy and Law's 'Foundations'\\", 29 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies (2009), pp. 230–63; \\"Heir, Celebrity, Martyr, Monster: Legal and Political Legitimacy in Shakespeare and Beyond\\", 20(1) Law & Critique (2009), pp. 79–103; \\"'This power isn't power if it's shared': Law and Violence in Jean Racine's La Thébaïde\\", 22(1) Law & Literature (2010), pp. 76–109 Some of his research focuses on the problem of legitimacy with particular reference to concepts of \\"imperialism\\" and \\"nationalism\\", concepts which he presents not as fixed, but as malleable and often overlapping.\\"Imperialism and Nationalism in Early Modernity: The 'Cosmopolitan' and The 'Provincial' in Shakespeare's Cymbeline\\", 18(3) Journal of Social & Legal Studies (2009), pp. 139–68; \\"'He'd turn the world itself into a prison': Empire and Enlightenment in Jean Racine's Alexander the Great\\", 4(1) Law & Humanities (2010), pp. 63–89 His approach further examines language as both the defining yet also infinitely manipulated tool of law as the institution and justification of political power.\\"'Where be his quiddities now?': Law and Language in Hamlet\\", in Law and Language: Current Legal Issues, vol. 15, Michael Freeman & Fiona Smith, eds., Oxford University Press (2013), pp. 201–20 Examining ancient and early modern literature, Heinze traces the demise of what he calls \\"unity\\" theories of justice, and their progressive displacement by \\"measurement\\" theories, which, he argues, become paramount within Western modernity. === Allan Hutchinson === Allan Hutchinson is a professor at York University's Osgoode Hall Law School and served as associate dean from 1994 to 1996. Hutchinson is a legal theorist and has devoted a lot of time to examining the failure of law. He also believes there is no central or primary foundational interpretive method for interpreting the law. The main point of his work is the judging of \\"an engaged game of rhetorical justification\\" which the judge must interpret, such as a statute, a line of precedents, or the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He has a nonfoundationalist perspective which searches for the truth that forms reality. Hutchinson says that method and medium must change, so self-creation becomes the engine and energy of social change. You can grasp life by living and this task cannot be completed by outside language or through language. Hutchinson argues that politically charged and unstable context shapes our understanding of legal rules. Hutchinson's understanding of truth confirms that law is politics. A nonfoundationalist account of law is compatible with a diverse range of political results. A definitive account of Hutchinson's legacy was published in The Journal Jurisprudence, Vol 7, in the summer of 2010. === Ian Ward === Ian Ward is a professor of law and degree programme director at Newcastle University Law School. He is also on the editorial board for Studies in Law and Literature. Ward received a BA from University of Keele in 1986, a Ph. D from University of Cambridge in 1989, an LLM from the University of Toronto in 1990 and a MSc from University of Leicester in 2010. Ward believes that students in both fields, law and literature, can benefit from studying rhetoric alongside law. His research lies in legal theory and public law among others. Ward has published numerous works dealing with law and literature and legal theory. In his publication Law and Literature: Possibilities and Perspectives, Ward discusses the future goals of the law and literature movement while exploring elements of law in famous pieces of literature. In chapter-1 of this publication, Ward describes law in literature as the process of examining \\"the possible relevance of literary text, particularly those which present themselves as telling a legal story, as texts appropriate for study by legal scholars.\\" He then sees law as literature as the process of seeking \\"to apply the techniques of literary criticism to legal texts.\\" He believes that the relationship between the two are complementary. He states discussing the debate about the importance of the Law and Literature Movement shows \\"its enduring strength\\". === Robin West === Another advocate for the integration of legal studies with the serious examination of literary texts, Robin West has frequently turned to Kafka's The Trial to discuss the rule of law. As a critic of Richard Posner's more economic take on the law, she does not dismiss the implications made by authors in legal fictional texts. For example, when discussing Kafka, West asserts that: Comments such as these show West's ideological stand on the power of literature as well as her personal philosophy of law. West's arguments tend to focus on the human condition as read in books as well as the individual submission to authority, and what she believes to be an apparent contradiction. She calls for scholars to interpret, create and critique narrative texts in order to broaden their understanding of the human condition, and the law's effect on it and the community as a whole. West believes in a so-called 'political, communal and ethical re-constitution', a mode of thinking that one might engage in when reading and critiquing texts, both fictional and legal. Because of this duality, West asserts, law and literature become more related and thus more valid in discussion when debating the implications of one or the other. These views have caused her to be seen as in the same camp as James Boyd White, although some argue that she goes even further, by becoming more of a political writer than a legal and literary critic. In her book, Narrative, Authority and the Law, West notably diverges from thinkers like Richard Weisberg and James Boyd White by stating that there should be less focus on the debate within the texts and instead a 'truly radical critique of power'. She expands by stating, \\"By focusing on the distinctively imperative core of adjudication, instead of its interpretive gloss, we free up meaningful criticism of law.\\" Such assertions lead some to believe her goals are more political than scholarly in nature. West may be seen not only as a scholar of law and literature, but also as a member of the critical legal studies movement (CLS). === Melanie Williams === Melanie Williams read Law at the University of Cambridge, graduating with a BA Hons in Law in 1988 (MA 1991). She has a PGCE and an MA in English Literature from the University of Sussex and is a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy. She is Professor of Law at the School of Law, University of Exeter. Formerly, she was Professor and Reader of Law at Swansea University and prior to that Lecturer in Law at the University of Aberystwyth until 2003. Professor Williams' research interests include Interdisciplinary Studies in Philosophy, Law and Literature, Law and Culture; approaches to Law and Ethics, Feminist and Socio-legal studies. She is an editorial board member with Law and Humanities (Hart); International Journal of Law in Context (CUP); Law, Culture and Humanities (Sage); Jurisprudence (Hart); \\"Law and Literature\\" series, DeGruyter, Berlin and New York. A review of Professor Williams book Empty Justice in the Entertainment and Sports Law Journal [2006] reads: \\"Melanie Williams's book is in part what its sub-title declares: a series of case studies dating from the end of the nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth, linking literary and philosophical texts to legal issues. It is also in part what its title declares: a peroration on the jurisprudential idea of 'empty justice', using literary texts as accessible ways into difficult concepts. What neither title nor sub-title declares is that this is first and foremost a work of feminist theory. Williams's goal has been to show (with doubters particularly in mind) 'how pervasive feminist issues are for all persons and all belief systems' (p. xxv). Williams wears her learning lightly, and the wealth of inter-woven illustrative examples, contextual details and outlines of theoretical debates really achieves its object of making feminist issues central, inevitable even. And she writes beautifully.\\" === Carmelo Delgado Cintrón === Carmelo Delgado Cintrón is a law professor at University of Puerto Rico where he teaches Law and Literature. Carmelo Delgado is an Academic founder of the Puerto Rican Academy of Jurisprudence and Legislation, the Academician of the Puerto Rican Academy of History and Academician of the Royal Spanish Academy. He has an extensive list of publications on law and literature and his main thesis is about how literary training should be required of all jurists. == Criticisms of law and literature == Richard Posner has played an important role in the law and economics movement. As the author of Law and Literature: A Misunderstood Relationship (now in its third edition, titled simply Law and Literature), Posner is highly critical of the law and literature movement and the book helps to voice his more hard-lined interpretation of the law. The book can be seen as a reaction against the writings of Robin West, who has written substantially against Posner's economic take on legal interpretation. A powerful critic of the writings of White, Weisberg, and West, Posner sees literature as having no weight in the legal realm although he does hold the authors in high esteem. He writes, \\"Although the writers we value have often put law into their writings, it does not follow that those writings are about law in any interesting way that a lawyer might be able to elucidate.\\" Posner does not believe in the use of literary discourse in jurisprudential debate, and in colloquy has described West's analysis of literature in legal debate as \\"particularly eccentric.\\"Richard A Posner. The Ethical Significance of Free Choice: A Reply to Professor West. 99 Harvard Law Review 1433 (1985–1986). Posner writes that \\"law is subject matter rather than technique\\", and that legal method is the method of choice in legal realms, not a literary one. To expand further, Posner believes literary works have no place in judicial debate because one can never truly contemplate the original meaning of the author, and that novels should only be considered in their contexts. He characterizes the discovery of laws in fiction as \\"ancillary\\" and asserts the main subject matter of a novel is always the human condition, and not the legal setting. From this perspective, the legal background created by Kafka and Albert Camus are simply that, background, and have no further meaning beyond the environment which they create. This isn't to say that Posner doesn't think in literary terms-far from it. For instance he characterizes Albert Camus's The Stranger, as the \\"growth of self-awareness\\" on the part of the hero, Meursault. Posner gives weight to such situations on personal levels and only on personal levels, yet dismisses any sort of legal implications of such situations as lacking in \\"realism\\". Such assertions and arguments have placed him in sharp contrast with Richard Weisberg, who has cited The Stranger numerous times, among other books. Posner sees literature's importance in legal studies only because they may help the lawyer grow as an individual and to develop character, but sees no value in them as social critiques of the era in which they were developed and written, as Law and Literature scholars might ascribe to them. Certainly he sees no value in them as sources of legal philosophy and reform. Highly critical of the notable Law and Literature scholars, Posner believes that such legal minds have taken literature \\"too seriously\\" and assigned them an unsubstantiated amount of weight in the expansion of legal knowledge and jurisprudential debate. Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic were against White and his theory of certain famous legal cases in U.S. history and agree with Posner on several issues. Their theory is that the actual impact of contemporary literature on the substance of judicial opinion-making is limited because judges distinguish legal texts. According to Delgado and Stefancic, judges' moral positions are determined by normative social and political forces rather than by literature. They are firm believers of the critical race theory which is a school of sociological thought that emphasizes the socially constructed nature of race. == References  Bibliography == * Biet, C., \\"Judicial Fiction and Literary Fiction: the example of the factum\\", Law & Literature, vol. 20, no. 3, 2008, pp. 403–422. * Breyer, Stephen, Active Liberty.

The first leg starts in February while the second and third legs are held in March and June respectively. At the conclusion of the series, the one horse that captures all the three legs will be entitled to a RM500,000 special bonus and since its inception in 2003, no other horse has manage to capture the honour. ==Cricket== Within the confines of the racecourse there is a cricket ground. The first recorded game held on the ground came in September 2003 when Singapore played Thailand in the Tuanku Ja'afar Cup.

His father died before his third birthday, and at the age of 8, he left home to work in a nail factory. Thus began a long series of jobs including farming, factory work and the lumber business, in the towns of Colemanville, Gap, and Bird in Hand, through which he became self-sufficient at an early age. He attended school only sporadically, attaining the equivalent of four to five years of formal schooling, but was self-taught, and became an educated man. At age 20, Welsh headed west to find work as an itinerant carpenter in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Fort Smith, Arkansas. ==Mexican War== At the outbreak of the Mexican War, Welsh enlisted as a third sergeant in the 2nd Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry. He served in the Monterey campaign under General Zachary Taylor. He was quickly promoted to first Sergeant then for reasons that have been lost, demoted to private. Welsh was severely wounded at the Battle of Buena Vista on February 23, 1847, when he was hit by a musket ball which shattered the bone just below his right knee. Though the wound would leave him lame for the rest of his life, his regimental surgeon named Dr. Blanton was able to save his leg from amputation (Welsh would later name his first son after Dr. Blanton). He returned to Columbia to recover and was received as a war hero. In January 1848, as soon as his wound had closed, he returned to service, accepting a commission as a second lieutenant in the 11th U.S. Infantry Regiment serving under General Winfield Scott in the Vera Cruz campaign. His leg wound had not fully healed, however, and in May 1848, he was sent home on medical leave. ==Political career and return to civilian life== Returning to Columbia during the election year of 1848, Welsh became active in the local Democratic Party. He supported Democratic presidential nominee Lewis Cass in his race against Welsh's former commanding office Zachary Taylor. He also spoke out against Federal anti-slavery legislation, instead favoring a doctrine of popular sovereignty, which espoused each territory's right to determine its own slavery or anti-slavery laws. Welsh married Annie Young in October 1850. The first of their seven children was born in 1851. He became an enterprising businessman, opening a dry goods store in Columbia's Canal Basin, selling insurance, and operating a small fleet of canal boats which he named after his children. He was appointed weigh master in 1850 and lock superintendent a few years later. He was elected Justice of the Peace and also served as president of the Borough Council. ==Civil War== When the Civil War erupted in April 1861, Welsh raised one of the first companies of volunteers from Lancaster County and was elected as its captain. Within days, the company was mustered into service as part of the 2nd Pennsylvania Infantry, and he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the regiment. This was a three-months regiment, which served briefly in the Shenandoah Valley, then York, Pennsylvania, where it served out its term. In July, when his term of enlistment was over, Welsh was appointed by Governor Andrew Curtin as a colonel and placed in charge of Camp Curtin, the processing center set up to process as many as 500,000 volunteers into war service. Welsh is credited with instituting needed reforms in camp discipline and sanitation. In October 1861, he was appointed to command the 45th Pennsylvania Infantry, a three-year regiment, which he had recruited from Center, Tioga, Lancaster, and Mifflin Counties. The 45th eventually became known as one of the best drilled and best disciplined regiments in the service, for which Welsh is credited. After brief service around Washington, the 45th was sent south to Charleston Harbor, under Gen. H. G. Wright, as part of the blockade of southern shipping. There it participated in the Battle of James Island on June 10, 1862. In July, the 45th was called north to become part of the IX Corps under Gen. Ambrose Burnside, and Welsh directed the successful rear-guard action during the Union evacuation of Acquia Creek, near Fredericksburg. When Confederate General Robert E. Lee launched his invasion of Maryland in September 1862, McClellan's Army of the Potomac (of which IX Corps was part) was sent in chase. At the Battle of South Mountain on September 14, Welsh, now in brigade command, engaged the rebels at Fox's Gap. His brigade came under heavy fire and suffered severe casualties, but succeeded in driving the Confederates off the ridge and securing a Union victory. On September 17, 1862, at the Battle of Antietam, after first being held in reserved (on account of its losses at South Mountain), Welsh's brigade was placed into action in the afternoon after Burnside exhausted his other troops capturing the bridge that now bears his name. Against steady opposition, Welsh's troops advanced a mile, entering the village of Sharpsburg (threatening to cut off the Confederate route of escape across the Potomac) before being called back because they could not be supported. This was the furthest Union advance of the battle. As it was, the battle ended largely in a stalemate. Welsh's performance drew praises from his superiors, and he was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers on November 29, 1862 (confirmed by the Senate on March 13, 1863). He was assigned to command the 1st division of IX Corps, sent west to Kentucky, then south to Mississippi to serve under Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant during the Siege of Vicksburg, where he was assigned to guard the exterior of the Union line from attack by Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston. Upon the surrender of Vicksburg, he marched with Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman to Jackson, Mississippi, and defeated the Confederates at the battle of Jackson. Welsh contracted a malarial fever during this campaign, from which he died in Cincinnati, Ohio, on August 14, 1863. He was buried in Mount Bethel Cemetery in his native Columbia. ==Namesake== After the Civil War, Grand Army of the Republic Post #118 in Columbia was named for Welsh. For many years, this was one of the most active G.A.R. posts in Pennsylvania. The Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War have a General Thomas Welsh Camp in Lancaster. ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Union) ==References== *Warner, Generals in Blue, 1964 *Albert, Allen D., History of the Fourth-Fifth Regiment Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteer Infantry 1861-1865, Williamsport, PA: Grit Publ.

The Club is a part of the Malayan Racing Association. The Perak Turf Club was established in 1884; it was the first exclusive turf club ever built in Perak. The establishment of the Perak Turf Club at Taiping was the idea of Sir Frank Swettenham, who was passionate about horse racing. The new race course was located at Waterfall Road, later changed to Race Course Road, near the Lake Gardens. It held ordinary racing in the Federated Malay States—the major tournaments held at Penang, Selangor or Singapore. In 1906, it had a membership of about 250. The present course is at Waterfall Road, Taiping, which is 7 furlongs in length. There was an old course, situated about three miles away from Taiping, at which the current races were then run. In 1886, Burma ponies provided most of the racing and the meetings were primarily social functions. The turf club was the only club that attracted people of all classes, especially the Chinese, to mingle around, because of the sweepstakes and lotteries, as they preferred to gamble as their favourite pastime. Sir E.W. Birch, a racing enthusiast, would travel to distant Turf Clubs just to join the major tournament, and was crucial to developing racing interest in the area. In 1934, when the importance of Taiping had declined below that of Ipoh, the club was shifted to Ipoh, still bearing the same name.

As of October 2004, the district has one school an enrollment of 116 students: In 1880 the people of Bickleton organized school district No. 210, and built a small box school house. Henry C. Hackley was the first instructor of the twelve pupils- Mrs. Osborne, a widow taught the second term. Mr. Bickle donated an acre of land at the east end of town for another school. The original public hall was converted to the grade school. It served the community until 1897 when it was removed to make room for present, two-story building. The contract was let for $1300. Eight grades were taught, seventy pupils in all, T.C. Anderson was the principal, Miss Jesse Forker was his assistant. In November 10, 1953, the Bickleton community constructed a new $107,645.12 brick school building. The building was built from May 15, 1952, to November 10, 1953. There were seventy-one grade school students attending this beautiful building and there were twenty-four high school students. As of October 2004 Bickleton School District, which changed to school district No. 203 at some point, had an enrollment of 116 students. After recent developments and investments in both wind and landfill gas sustainable energy projects in the Bickleton area the School Superintendent, Rick Palmer, huddled for two years beginning in 2008 with the county assessor crunching numbers from wind energy developers before going to voters with an $8.9 million bond measure to build the new school. The old 1950s era schools not only lacked adequate HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) and septic systems but were also outdated as far as structural aspects and energy efficiency. The School District contracted with Hill International Inc. in Spokane to perform both construction management services and building commissioning services. Mountain States Construction was awarded the contract as the general contractor and ground was broken in 2010 on the new $10.5 million, 42,000-square-foot school building to replace the old Bickleton School District’s two 1950s-era schools. The new school building, which opened in the fall of 2011, boasts many advanced, state of the art energy efficient design features. The updated facilities, infrastructure and athletic grounds provided for the students is also of the latest technology allowing students a great learning environment for many years to come.

Drawing its themes from The Bacchae of Euripides, it is a meditation on possession, madness and female violence. ==Synopsis== The play has an unusual structure; it is a series of seven independent vignettes each focusing on a different character. After every scene, a moment in the tragedy of Pentheus is seen. Dionysos, a dancer, watches the action invisibly, and his kiss causes each episode's central transformation. At the play's end, the characters return to give epilogues narrating how their stories continued. The episodes include: * An unhappy wife slowly succumbs to post-natal psychosis. She experiences command hallucinations telling her to drown her baby in the bathtub and eventually does so. * A man's marriage and career are disrupted when he falls passionately in love with a pig at a slaughterhouse his company owns. * A voodoo practitioner newly arrived in London is haunted by an upper-crust British spirit who tries to drive away her familiar Haitian spirit guide, Baron Sunday. * Herculine Barbin, a nineteenth-century hermaphrodite, narrates the story of his transformation from girl to man. This monologue lies at the center of the play and is performed first by an actress, then repeated in identical language by a male actor. * A woman struggles to overcome alcoholism. * Two jailers must restore order in their prison when a serial killer among the inmates inexplicably changes sex and begins killing other prisoners with magic. * A female office worker is subject to grotesque, bloody fantasies and fits of rage. The actors play ensemble roles in all scenes other than their own. Dance sequences are at the center of the episodes involving the pig and his lover, the schizophrenic and her hallucinated tormentor, and the serial killer. The play's perspective on mental illness and sexuality is strongly influenced by the work of Michel Foucault, who also wrote a monograph on the life of Herculine Barbin, as well as David Lan's own anthropological work on possession and non-Western religions. ==References== * Madness and Signification in A Mouthful of Birds, by Laura Nutten * \\"Paul Dances With the Pig, Tenderly\\": The Politics of Ecstasy and Acts of Possession in A Mouthful of Birds, by Jennifer J.

It is a heavily updated version of Konami's 1989 arcade game Bottom of the Ninth . ==Gameplay== One of the earliest in Konami's franchise, this version features 300 actual MLB players, but does not feature the MLB licensed teams. Players can choose to either play against a friend in Exhibition, Season or Playoffs. The gameplay is geared for more of a simulation style of play with the players stats determining on how well they hit, pitch and field. Along with the standard modes for a baseball game, this one also features the ability to customize teams and choose any player to create a \\"Dream Team\\". It also has a variety of different camera angles, a \\"Streak Bar\\" that shows a batter's hitting ability, and a \\"Pitching Bar\\" that shows whether a pitcher is fatigued. ==Reception== Bottom of the 9th received mixed reviews. Critics commented that the screen is too cluttered with info, the graphics in general are below average, and the controls (particularly the unusual batting system) are difficult to get a handle on. However, critics for Next Generation and GamePro felt the controls and steep challenge of the game ultimately make it more realistic, and that mastering the unusual controls ultimately pays off with a deeper gaming experience, with Air Hendrix of GamePro concluding that \\"Serious baseball fiends will enjoy this ballpark's authentic, challenging gameplay\\". The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly instead argued that the steep learning curve makes Bottom of the 9th less worthwhile than more immediately accessible games. Air Hendrix described the Saturn version as \\"an impressively exact port ... with both the flaws (quirky graphics and tricky controls) and high points (excellent gameplay) of the original.\\" He noted that despite the fact that the 1996 baseball season had started, the Saturn version had not updated the rosters. == Notes References * Category:1996 video games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Major League Baseball video games Category:Konami games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Bottom of the 9th"},{"id":"6199876","text":"The Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance is a Creative Arts Emmy Award given out by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences. It is awarded to a performer for an outstanding \\"continuing or single voice-over performance in a series or a special.\\" Prior to 1992, voice-actors could be nominated for their performance in the live action acting categories. The award was first given in 1992 when six voice actors from The Simpsons shared the award. From 1992 to 2008, it was a juried award, so there were no nominations and there would be multiple or no recipients in one year. In 2009, the rules were changed to a category award, with five nominees. Usually, the winner is a voice actor from an animated show, but some narrators of live action shows have won such as Keith David in 2005 and 2008. No winner was named in 1996 or 2007. Nine voice actors from The Simpsons have won a combined 14 Emmys. Of those, Dan Castellaneta has won four and Hank Azaria has won three. Ja'net Dubois has won two for The PJs, Keith David has won two for his narration of various documentaries and Maurice LaMarche has won two for Futurama. Voice actors from shows on Fox have won 17 of 27 awards. In 2014, the category was separated into two categories – Outstanding Narrator and Outstanding Character Voice-Over Performance. As with longform and reality, this split acknowledges and accommodates a general industry uptrend in the distinctly different achievements that are VO narration and VO character performance. ==Rules== While most of the Primetime Emmy Awards choose winners from a group of nominees, the award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance was juried from 1992 to 2008. Each entrant was screened by a panel of Academy of Television Arts and Sciences members from the Animation branch as well as members of the Acting branch with voiceover credits. Potential nominees had to submit a DVD that contained an edited version of a single episode and a picture of the character(s) that were voiced. Submissions that were less than 30 minutes had to be edited to be shorter than five minutes; entries longer than 30 minutes were edited to be less than ten. Prior to 2007, the maximum edited lengths were ten and fifteen minutes respectively. Each entrant with majority approval went on to a second panel. Emmy winners had to be unanimous choices of this second panel, except that for every 12 persons or fraction thereof on the panel, one \\"no\\" vote was allowed, except from the head of the panel. In 2009, the Academy changed the award from a \\"juried\\" award to a \\"category\\", with six nominees and one winner. ==Winners (1992–2008)== {  - ! Year ! Winner ! Character(s) !

His vision fails, and he travels seeking help with it, becoming suicidal. He learns in a dream that he has a kind of guardian spirit Martia, a female spirit from Mars, who communicates with him and offers him guidance. She inspires him to a successful career as an author.

Queen Shin Sawbu was also known as Binnya Thau () ()or Old Queen in Mon. Queen Shin Sawbu and Queen Jamadevi of Haripunjaya are the two most famous among the small number of queens who ruled in mainland Southeast Asia.Guillon 1999: 169 ==Early life== Shin Sawbu was the only daughter of the Mon King Razadarit who had two sons as well. She was born on 11 February 1394 (Wednesday, 12th waxing of Tabaung of 755 ME) to the junior queen Thuddhamaya (). At birth she was given the name Viharadevi (from Sanskrit and Pali: vihara \\"monastery\\" + devi \\"goddess\\" or \\"queen\\" ), which likely means \\"queen of the monastery\\". At age 20 she was married to Binnya Bwe (Smin Chesao), Razadarit's nephew and had a son, Binnya Waru and two daughters, Netaka Taw and Netaka Thin. Her husband died when she was just 25. ==Residence at Ava== In 1421, Sawbu's father King Razadarit died. The king's eldest son Binnya Dhammaraza ascended the throne but his younger brothers Binnya Ran and Binnya Kyan rebelled. By the invitation of Binnya Kyan, King Thihathu of Ava came down with an army in November 1423 (Natdaw 785 ME).Burmese chronicles do not agree on the invasion date. Maha Yazawin (Kala Vol. 2 2006: 58) says the invasion began in Natdaw 785 ME (4 Nov 1423 to 2 December 1423) but Hmannan Yazawin (RHC Vol. 2 2003: 56) says it began a year earlier in Natdaw 784 ME (19 Oct 1422 to 16 November 1422). However the editors of the 2006 edition of Maha Yazawin side with the November 1423 date. Binnya Dhammaraza pacified his brothers by making Binnya Ran the crown prince as well as giving the governorship of the Irrawaddy delta, and Binnya Kyan the governorship of Martaban. Crown Prince Binnya Ran in a gesture of peace presented his sister Shin Sawbu to Thihathu, who in turn presented a princess of Ava to marry Binnya Ran. It was December 1423.Maha Yazawin (Kala Vol. 2 2006: 56) says Binnya Ran made the offer one month into the invasion. It means Pyatho 785 ME (2 December 1423 to 31 December 1423). When Shin Sawbu went to Ava, she was 29 years old, a widow and a mother with a son and two daughters. During the time she resided at Ava, she did not have any additional children.Harvey 1925: 116 King Thihathu was very fond of her but he died during a military expedition in the north in 1425. Shin Sawbu remained in Ava for four more years. During her residence at Ava, Shin Sawbu became the patron of two Mon monks, Dhammanyana and Pitakahara, who resided at the Ariyadhaza monastery at Sagaing near Ava. In 1429, at the age of 35, the queen escaped with the help of her Mon monk preceptors and returned to Pegu accompanied by them.Kala Vol. 2 2006: 58 ==Reign at Pegu== V&A; Museum, London All members of Pegu's male line to the throne having been exhausted, Shin Sawbu ascended the throne as queen in early 1454. Two of her brothers, Binnya Dhammayaza and Banya Ran I, and one of her sons, Binnya Waru, had already ruled as kings of Pegu.(Harvey, 1925, 368) In 1457, shortly after ascending the throne, the Buddhist world celebrated the two thousandth anniversary of the Buddha's Paranirvana which in Southeast Asia is dated to the year 543 BCE. After ruling Pegu for around seven years, in 1460 she decided to abdicate and move from Pegu to Dagon where she could lead a life of religious devotion next to the Shwedagon pagoda.(Singer, 1992, p. 81) Shin Sawbu chose a monk to succeed her on the throne of Pegu. The monk Pitakahara, who had helped her escape from Ava, left the sangha, was given the titles Punnaraja and Dhammazedi, and became her son-in-law and a suitable heir to the throne by marrying her younger daughter Mipakathin. ==Reign at Dagon== Shin Sawbu lived in Dagon next to the Shwedagon Pagoda until the end of her life in 1471. Even after she moved to Dagon she is said to have still worn a crown.(Halliday, 2000, 101) The actually handing over of power from Shin Sawbu to Dhammazedi, who became king under the title Ramadhipati in the year 1457, is commemorated in an inscription written in the Mon language.(Shorto, Mon Inscriptions, II, p. 61) In Dagon, the queen devoted her time and attention to the Shwedagon pagoda, enlarging the platform around the pagoda, paving it with stones and placing stone posts and lamps around the outside of the pagoda. She extended the glebe lands supporting the pagoda to Danok. Almost everything that Shin Sawbu did, she did in multiples of four: \\"There were four white umbrellas, four golden alms-bowls, four earthenware vessels, and four offerings were made each day. There were twenty-seven men who prepared the lamps each day. There were twenty men as guardians of the pagoda treasury. There were four goldsmith's shops, four orchestras, four drums, four sheds, eight doorkeepers, four sweepers, and twenty lamp lighters. She built round and strengthened the sevenfold wall. Between the walls Her Majesty Banya Thau had them plant palmyra and coconut trees.\\"(Halliday, 2000, p. 102) Shwedagon pagoda in Dagon (now Yangon) She also had her own weight in gold (25 viss) beaten out into gold leaf and covered the Shwedagon pagoda with this gold leaf. The inhabitants of Dagon donated 5,000 viss of bronze to the pagoda.(Halliday, 2000, p. 101) ==Stone inscriptions== Three inscriptions in stone have been found from Shin Sawbu's reign. The first inscription known as Kyaikmaraw I commemorates a land dedication. On 25 September 1455 the queen dedicated land to the Kyaikmaraw pagoda that she had built. The inscription records that jewels, precious objects, and the revenues of a place named \\"Tko' Mbon\\" were given to the Moh Smin [Royal Promontory] pagoda at Myatheindan near Martaban. The second part of the inscription provides benedictions for those coming to pay their respects to the pagoda and makes many references to Buddhist scripture. The third part of the inscription outlines the torments of hell. The inscription is rich in linguistic, religious, and historical information with Burmese linguistic influences and the word \\"caw\\" or \\"chao\\" meaning \\"lord\\" from a Tai language used supposedly because \\"this title had been given to the Wareru dynasty by the Thai king.\\"(Guillon, p. 171-2; most of this information comes from Guillon, pp. 171–172; also see Shorto, 1958; Than Tun, 1985, Royal Orders of Burma, Part Two, p. x, also describes this inscription) ==Mon folk traditions== At the end of the nineteenth century, some Mons are said to have regarded the British Queen Victoria as the reincarnation of Shin Sawbu. The story of how the queen chose a successor runs as follows. After ruling for only seven years, she decided to abdicate. She devised a method to choose which one of the two monks had accompanied her during her residence in Ava should succeed her as ruler: \\"One morning when they came to receive the royal rice, she secreted in one of their bowls a pahso (layman’s dress) [male sarong, skirt-like dress] together with little models of the five regalia; then having prayed that the lot might fall on the worthier, she returned the bowls.(Sayadaw Athwa II. 131) Dhammazedi. To whom the fateful bowl fell, left the sacred order, received her daughter in marriage, and assumed the government. The other monk in his disappointment aroused suspicion and was executed in Paunglin, north of Dagon. The lords also resented the choice at first but became reconciled owing to Dhammazedi’s high character; when some of them continued murmuring that he was not of royal race, Shinsawbu had a beam taken out of the and carved into a Buddha image, and showed it to them saying 'Ye say he is of common blood, he cannot be your King. See here this common wood – yesterday it was trodden in the dust of your feet, but to-day, is it not the Lord and do we not bow before it?'.\\"(Harvey, 117-8) Singer provides an alternative story with the governor of Pathein, Binnya Ein, married to Shin Sawbu's elder daughter Mipakahtau, rebelling because he was not appointed king ahead of Dhammazedi. This rebellion ends when he is poisoned. Baña Thau means \\"Old Queen\\" in the Mon language. Harvey relates the story of how this name originated taken from the \\"Thatonhnwemun Yazawin\\" chronicle: \\"Once while being carried around the city in her gorgeous palanquin, sword in hand and crown on head, she heard an old man exclaim, as her retinue pushed him aside \\"I must get out of the way, must I? I am an old fool, am I? I am not so old that I could not get a child, which is more than your old queen could do!\\" Thunderstruck at such irreverence, she meekly accepted it as a sign from heaven, and thereafter styled herself 'The Old Queen'.\\"(Harvey, p. 117) The Mon history Nidana Ramadhipati Katha provides an alternative story of how Baña Thau ended up living in Ava claiming that she was already ruling at Pegu as queen when she was abducted and brought to Ava and made chief queen.(Shorto, no date, pp. 1–7) ==Dispute over duration of reign== Some hold that Shin Sawbu ruled for seven years, others seventeen years. Shorto first hypothesized that she might have ruled jointly with Dhammazedi.(Shorto, Dictionary of Mon Inscriptions, 317, Ramadhipati) Guillon holds that Sawbu and Dhammazedi ruled jointly with Dhammazedi ruling over Pegu and Shinsawbu ruling over Dagon.(Guillon, 1999, 172) Dagon had long been the traditional appanage of Mon queens.(Guillon, 1999, p. 170) ==Palace and burial locations== Furnival claimed that \\"the ramparts of Shin Sawbu's residence at Dagon\\" were the colonial era \\"bunkers of the golf course near the Prome Road,\\" but others claim these ruins are, in fact, a wall built in 1841.(Harvey, 118 citing Furnivall, Syriam Gazetteer; Fraser \\"Old Rangoon\\" JBRS 1920) The stupa that contained her remains is said to be at a monastery in Sanchaung Township of modern-day Yangon near the Shwedagon Pagoda on the grounds of a monastery once named the Shin Sawbu Tomb Monastery, which is located west of Pyay Road (Prome Road) on Shin Saw Pu Road (Windsor Road).(JBRS 1912 Saya Thein \\"Rangoon in 1852\\"; Harvey, p. 118; also see Singer, 1992 for details) ==Historiography== Various Burmese chronicles do not agree on the key dates of the queen's life. { width=100%  - !

The scientific name has changed several times through history; synonyms include Thymallus microlepis, Salmothymus obtusirostris and Salar obtusirostris. This species spawns in the early spring and is an obligatory freshwater fish. They are an important game fish. ==Distribution and subspecies== Salmo obtusirostris is found naturally in four drainages of the Adriatic Sea, in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro: the Neretva-Vrljika system, the Jadro, the Morača-Zeta system, and possibly the Krka river drainage around Knin although it is presumed extinct for some time now. In addition, sometimes during 1960's, it has been introduced from the Jadro river to the nearby Zrnovnica river, both being small karst, single river drainages, of very short course, in vicinity of Split. Although the Vrljika belongs to the Neretva River drainage it's a sinking river, divided in several on surface and underground segments, hence separated from the Neretva River in significant manner regarding softmouth trout populations. However, the Vrljika softmouth trout is apparently most similar to the Neretva's subspecies, while some autapomorphies exist in the Vrljika population. The Vrljika softmouth trout appears to have originated from a vicariance that split a common ancestral population into large (Neretva) and small (Vrljika) fragmented populations. The different populations are sometimes classified into subspecies: * Salmo obtusirostris oxyrhynchus: Neretva and its tributaries the Buna, the Bregava, the Rama, the Trebižat in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Vrljika within both Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia *Salmo obtusirostris salonitana: the Jadro River and the Žrnovnica River in Croatia *Salmo obtusirostris krkensis: the Krka river in Croatia *Salmo obtusirostris zetensis: the Zeta River and the Morača River in Montenegro. ==Appearance and anatomy== The most obvious characteristic of the Adriatic trout is an elongated snout. It also has a small and fleshy mouth, relatively large scales and high body depth. The color of the body varies between subspecies, it is mostly green with red and black dots. There are no vertical stripes that are common in brown trout of the Adriatic Sea drainages that can be found. ==Conservation== Adriatic trout are threatened by excessive damming, hybridization with introduced species and overfishing. In the river Neretva, natural hybrids (named kosor by locals) between Adriatic and brown trout can be found. Hybridization was also confirmed experimentally (Kosorić & Vuković. 1969). Adriatic trout prefers rivers with more water and wide riverbed. Adriatic and brown trout have different spawning times that overlap only slightly every few years, which is why natural hybridization is not widespread and both species live sympatrically in the same rivers. ==References== obtusirostris Category:Freshwater fish of Europe Category:Endemic fish of the Neretva basin Category:Fauna of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Fish described in 1851 Category:Endemic fauna of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Species endangered by river-damming ","title":"Salmo obtusirostris"},{"id":"6199915","text":"Govindadasa College (established in 1967) is affiliated to Mangalore University in Mangalore, India.

Patrimonio Nacional () is a Spanish agency, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Presidency, that administers the sites owned by the Spanish State and used by the Monarch and the Spanish Royal Family as residences and for State Ceremonies. The Patrimonio Nacional includes palaces, gardens, monasteries and convents, called the Royal sites. When not in official use, the Royal sites are open to the public. It also manages the residences of the president of the government of Spain. The agency was first created in 1865 during the reign of Isabella II under the name of Crown Heritage. During the reign of her grandson, Alfonso XIII, it was known as Patrimonio Real (Royal Heritage). The second republic (1931–1939) kept the agency under the name of Republic's Heritage and in 1940, dictator Francisco Franco renamed it as Patrimonio National, the current name. Patrimonio Nacional organizes temporary exhibitions and concerts in the Royal sites. It also publishes catalogues of the Royal Collections, books on the Royal sites, facsimiles of some of the books held in the library of El Escorial and the Royal Library, visitors guides to the different sites as well as the official photographs of the King of Spain. It also publishes a quarterly magazine, Reales Sitios, about the art collections and cultural history of the Royal sites.

Its frequency is 89.3 MHz FM WHFR programs alternative variety, music heard little elsewhere on Detroit area radio stations. 40% of the music is classical but the station also features alternative/modern rock, big band, opera, Americana/folk, blues, hip hop, jazz, space rock, urban rock, and world music, in addition to a weekly public affairs show. All music shows highlight (as much as possible) new releases, independent labels, and local artists. Through a satellite-delivered service the station provides 60+ hours a week of classical music from Public Radio International. WHFR-FM 89.3, the College's non-commercial, student-staffed, faculty-guided campus radio station hails from the newly renovated Student Center at Henry Ford College. Back in 1962, WHFR began as a student radio club with only a double-closet-sized room for operating a public address system to the dining room, providing a variety of music and campus announcements during weekday hours. However, the club's mission since its start was to start a real broadcast station, serving the unique music and information needs of the community, as well as the students at HFCC. By 1978, the HFCC administration, recognizing the spirit and seeing the dedication, applied for an FM broadcast license from the Federal Communications Commission. The license was granted in 1979, but the preparations necessary to broadcast (construction, equipment, staffing, and budget) took until 1985 to get worked out, when the station went on the air. Beginning with only six hours a day/six days a week, with all shows prerecorded, WHFR grew steadily as it proved itself and attracted more volunteers, first going \\"live\\" in 1987 (for three hours a week). In 1988, with a schedule of 12 hours a day, the WHFR staff was stretched thin and moved all of its equipment and music library out of the Student Center and into the new HFCC Fine Arts Center. Since 1997, the station has achieved a 24/7 broadcasting schedule, with the help of over 60 student and alumni volunteers. Among their achievements and awards by the Michigan Association of Educational Broadcasters and the MAB Michigan Association of Broadcasters, WHFR-FM is also locally recognized as the most diverse station in the state. They've been recognized for this achievement in several newspaper and website polls. WHFR's broadcast guide is available every day on their website and features college alternative including indie rock, punk, blues, metal, jazz, classical, opera, choral music, world music, americana/folk, techno, grrl groups and video game soundtracks. Most shows fit a 2-hour time slot, and the format changes for each show. ==References== *Michiguide.com - WHFR History ==External links== * HFR HFR Category:Radio stations established in 1962 ","title":"WHFR"},{"id":"6199924","text":"The 2006 season of Úrvalsdeild was the 95th season of league football in Iceland.

He is among the best Estonian writers for his historical novels. ==Early life and education in Estonia== Karl Ristikivi was one of the first Estonian writers to create a comprehensive panorama of his country's urbanization. Once in Swedish exile, he also wrote the first Estonian surrealist novel, a work that is strongly influenced by existentialist philosophy. He orchestrated an impressive cycle of seventeen novels plus other books into a polyphonic unity with a time scale that embraces European history over two millennia. His invention and use of a complicated system of myths and symbols could be compared to the approach of the school of semiotic writers. Humanism, Christian religion, and traditional ethics are, however, the chief legacy of his works. Ristikivi was born on 16 October 1912 in Varbla in western Estonia to an unmarried maidservant, Liisu Ristikivi, and was baptized Karp RistikiviNirk (op. cit.), page 10, suggests this name was a mistake on the part of the church registry in the Russian Orthodox congregation to which his mother belonged. He spent his childhood on various farms where his mother found employment. In 1920 he entered a village school and suffered humiliation because of his illegitimacy and his frail physique. He obtained some knowledge of literature and history by reading old German books that he found in the attic of a local manor house; although he did not know the language at first, he enjoyed looking at the pictures and asked grown-ups about the meaning of the texts. In the process he shaped his own imaginary world of medieval knights and Christian ideals. His interest in history and talent for learning languages made Ristikivi an academic success at the village school. In 1927 a rich relative offered him an opportunity to continue his studies, and Ristikivi attended the Tallinn Commercial School and the Tallinn College; he graduated from the latter institution in 1932. The reminiscences of older residents of the city sparked Ristikivi's interest in the first period of urbanization in Estonia at the end of the nineteenth century. Ristikivi began his literary career writing stories for family magazines, and in the 1930s he published a series of children's books with animal characters: The Flying World (\\"Lendav maailm\\", 1935), The Blue Butterfly (\\"Sinine liblikas\\", 1936), Pals (\\"Semud\\", 1936), and Chums (\\"Sellid\\", 1938). The money he received for these works enabled him to enroll in the department of geography in the faculty of mathematics and natural sciences of the University of Tartu in 1936, where he chose sociology as his main subject. While at the university he was active in the left-wing Estonian Students' Society Veljesto. Ristikivi graduated Tartu University cum laude in 1941. ==Later life in Swedish exile== Much of this section is based on the only longer book dealing with Karl Ristikivi's life, i.e. Nirk, op. cit. The Nazi-German occupation of Estonia in 1941 formed a watershed in Karl Ristikivi's life. Ristikivi was mobilised into the German army. As the German occupation weakened, Estonians began to worry what would happen if the Russians returned. For instance, those who had been in the German army - would they get sent to Siberia? Or worse? Ristikivi ended up working in the Estonian Bureau in Helsinki, capital of neighbouring Finland. But at some point during 1944, Ristikivi decided to cross over to neutral Sweden, quite legally as he even obtained a visa. But he would never see Estonia again. He would live for the rest of his life, a further 33 years, in the Stockholm area and Uppsala. Ristikivi began writing articles for the exile Estonian press in Sweden. But in the end, to make ends meet, he started work at a health insurance office. This meant that all his writing from then onwards would have to be done in his spare time. The first two novels he wrote in exile were those of the Unfinished Trilogy. These were still about Estonia, but by the early 1950s, Ristikivi must have undergone some kind of crisis. He did not complete the trilogy but instead started work on what has become his most famous novel The Night of Souls (\\"Hingede öö\\"; 1953; synopsis below). Around the time that Ristikivi was writing his historical novel about Saint Catherine of Siena (The Bridal Veil op. cit.), he was interviewed by Vello Salo for Vatican Radio about his previous work. But he appears not to have been a very public figure, devoting much of his spare time to writing his novels and other works, and mostly mixing with other exile Estonians in his social life. Nevertheless, Ristikivi travelled quite a lot, often to southern Europe to look at some of the settings for his later novels. Apart from writing the other novels described in the synopses section below, Ristikivi continued to write many reviews and critical essays, mostly about Estonian literature, for the exile Estonian press and helped his friend Bernard Kangro, also a poet and novelist to run the publishing house Estonian Writers' Co- operative, housed in a suburb of Lund in southern Sweden, and which published exile Estonian literature. Apart from two translations of his early novels into Finnish, a couple of his short-stories in Swedish, and a few recent Russian translations of his key novels, Karl Ristikívi remains untranslated into any other language. Karl Ristikivi is estimated to have died on 19 July 1977 in his flat on Östervägen, Solna, near Stockholm, Sweden. His body was found a little while later and he is assumed to have died instantly of a brain haemorrhage. He was buried in Stockholm a few days later.Nirk op. cit., page 270 A monument to Karl Ristikivi was unveiled at his birthplace in Estonia to commemorate what would have been his 75th birthday in 1987.As mentioned in the Stockholm Estonian-language daily Eesti Päevaleht, 1 August 2012, page 4 ==The trilogies, novels, and short-stories – synopses and descriptions== A large part of what is written in this section is drawn from Neithal (op. cit.) and occasionally Nirk (op. cit.) There are simply no English-language sources or, for that matter, Swedish-language ones, although Ristikivi spent that last 33 years of his life living in Sweden. The Tallinn Trilogy - Fire and Iron (\\"Tuli ja raud\\"; 1938); The Abode of a Righteous Man / In a Strange House (\\"Õige mehe koda\\" / \\"Võõras majas\\"; 1940); The Herb Garden (\\"Rohtaed\\"; 1942) In 1938 Ristikivi published his first novel, Fire and Iron. It and his next two novels treat the urbanization process as it affected three representative classes of Estonians — workers, merchants, and intellectuals — and comprise what is termed his Tallinn trilogy. Fire and Iron begins in the 1880s with Jüri Säävel giving up farming and moving to Tallinn, thereby becoming a member of the first urban proletariat in Estonia. He witnesses the revolution of 1905, World War I, the Estonian declaration of independence in 1918, and the subsequent War of Independence. Throughout his life he retains his ideals of hard work, honesty, and charity. One of his sons dies in an accident; the other son, continuing the family tradition of moving to places of economic opportunity, seeks his fortune by immigrating to the United States. Säävel sends his orphaned grandson to the newly founded Tallinn Technical University, thereby establishing a pattern of progress: Säävel is a foundry worker, his late son was a train engineer, and the grandson gets a degree in engineering. A reverse pattern is also apparent, however: the grandson divorces his wife, leaving her with a baby son. Säävel dies without forgiving his grandson, but the rest of the family continues living together to bring up the child. Fire and Iron was the literary event of the year and won first prize in the fiction competition of the publishing house Loodus. The award money enabled Ristikivi to continue his studies; even more important to the young novelist was a public letter of praise from Anton Hansen Tammsaare, the \\"living classic\\" of Estonian literature. Tammsaare's words of encouragement suggest that the older writer was aware of Ristikivi's debt to Tammsaare's epic novel cycle Truth and Justice (\\"Tõde ja õigus\\", 1926-1933). Other influences on Ristikivi's Tallinn trilogy were the novels of Charles Dickens, John Galsworthy, and Thomas Mann and — oddly — the 1933 Hollywood movie Cavalcade. In June 1940 the Soviet Union annexed Estonia. One of the consequences of the Communist occupation was that when the next novel in Ristikivi's trilogy was published in December, its title was changed by the authorities from the author's The Abode of a Righteous Man to In a Strange House because the original title was thought to be too biblical. In In a Strange House Jakob Kadarik, an orphan, is brought up in the household of a rich German merchant who owns a department store in a choice location in Tallinn. Jakob is ashamed of his peasant origin and obsessed with getting ahead. To reward his doggedly faithful service, humility, and business acumen, the merchant gives Jacob the hand of one of his daughters, who would otherwise remain an old maid. Another daughter, however, will get a much bigger dowry, so Jakob engages in an intrigue whereby he gets the other sister to marry him. Decades later, life in the Kadarik household is outwardly splendid: Estonia is an independent republic; Estonians have replaced Baltic Germans in business and society; and Jacob now owns the department store. Real happiness eludes Jakob, however. His wife has not forgiven him for the greedy and fraudulent maneuver that led to their union and has never loved him. Then the business fails. After the wife dies, the children find her diary, which reveals the ugly truth about her marriage; as a result, they become estranged from their father. Jakob's store burns down; he is suspected of having set the fire to collect the insurance; and one of his sons commits suicide. The protagonist of the third novel The Herb Garden, Juulius Kilimit, is the son of a village schoolmaster, lives in something of an aestheticist fantasy world of his own. He flees in his mind to an folkloric idyll, taking his urge towards freedom from German and Greek classics. But his god is not to be found in the groves of Arcadia, but in the landscape of Estonia, where he seeks his roots. While the Estonian literature of the time often portrayed the intellectual with some ridicule, Ristikivi picks his ideals from a symbolic herb garden. The younger generation try to undermine such feelings. The author allows romantic and positive values to prevail, as the novel had been planned before the Soviet and Nazi invasions of his homeland. The Unfinished Trilogy - All That Ever Was (\\"Kõik, mis kunagi oli\\"; 1946); Nothing Happened (\\"Ei juhtunud midagi\\"; 1947) Also sketched out while Ristikivi was still living in Estonia were the two novels of the Unfinished Trilogy, which appeared in Swedish exile in 1946 and 1947, respectively. These are the last novels that Ristikivi wrote that are set in and examine Estonia. The first of the two novels, All That Ever Was is, not surprisingly under the circumstances, a nostalgic view of Estonia, full of Sundays and the blossom of fruit trees in spring. It is the swan song of the old clergyman August Tammik as death approaches. But the backdrop to the second novel, Nothing Happened, is the grim reality of the Soviet occupation of Estonia and the establishment there of Soviet military bases, the mass exodus of the Baltic-Germans, the title is ironic, as a lot happened during that time, events that would shape the destiny of Estonia for the next half century. The Night of Souls (\\"Hingede öö\\"; 1953) This novel is regarded as Ristikivi's masterpiece. It is a novel dealing with the very personal alienation and existential crisis experienced by a foreigner in a strange land. Ristikivi himself was now in exile in Sweden with no hope of ever returning to Estonia. The space in which the novel moves is a building in central Stockholm which the protagonist enters on New Year's Eve, hoping to flee the noisy drunken crowds on the streets, but also to attend a concert. But he ends up wandering up and down this labyrinthine house, meeting people, having desultory conversations, and never fully fitting in or getting into close contact with anyone. The epigrams at the beginning of chapters are taken from, for instance, John Bunyan, Walt Whitman, T.S. Eliot, Edgar Allan Poe, Christian Morgenstern, Lewis Carroll, A.E. Housman, Oscar Wilde, and the Finnish poet Uuno Kailas, which is a hint at what Ristikivi was reading at the time. The second half of the novel, entitled The Seven Witnesses begins with a strange waiting room scene where the protagonist appears to be in limbo between two countries, unable to proceed, unable to return. This is followed by a dreamlike court scene which is similar to the one that the old academic, Dr Isak Borg, experiences in the Ingmar Bergman film Wild Strawberries (1957). Each witness represents one of the Seven Deadly Sins. Between these two sections is a letter to a certain Mrs Agnes Rohumaa, which brings the reader down to earth, out of the dreams for a while. The novel ends on a relatively optimistic note. The protagonist is hardly reborn, but a number of matters have become clearer.This novel is being translated into English and has appeared only in Russian translation: Noch dush ili postoronnyi, Meie Raamat (publisher), 2009 Ristikivi has documented some of the impulses that led to this novel. The first germ of an idea occurred when he was walking home alone one New Year's Eve through the almost empty streets of Uppsala, Sweden, in the mid-1940s. He then conceived of a short-story (which was never written) where a young man enters a completely unknown building, and it is not the people in there that are embarrassed at the fact that he is a stranger, but the young man himself. This idea gelled when Ristikivi celebrated the New Year at the Stockholm Concert Hall some years later. There are also musical and literary references in Ristikivi's description of the genesis of this novel such as Beethoven's 7th Symphony, Gide's Counterfeiters, and T.S. Eliot's Cocktail Party. But Ristikivi claims he had, at the time, not yet read Kafka.As told in the essay The Birth of a Novel (\\"Ühe romaani sünnilugu\\"), in The Last Freedom (\\"Viimne vabadus\\") (op. cit.) The Chronicle Trilogy - The Burning Flag (\\"Põlev lipp\\"; 1961); The Last Bastion (\\"Viimne linn\\"; 1962); The Horsemen of Death (\\"Surma ratsanikud\\"; 1963) Ristikivi changed his style completely for this trilogy whose novels are set during the period of the Crusades between 1266 and 1311. Where the previous novel was an intimate account, these three are written in a somewhat impersonal chronicle style. The Burning Flag describes the life of the young German count Konrad von Hohenstaufen and his attempts to regain control of the Kingdom of Sicily which had once been ruled by his forebears, but his forces suffer defeat and he is killed. The Last Bastion describes the attempts by Christians to take Acre (also known as Akka or Akkon),The city of Acre was located on the northern part of what is now Haifa Bay, Israel. It is a holy city for the Baha'i religion. and the dramatic events, full of sacrifice, that took place in the Palestine of 1291. In The Horsemen of Death the Crusades as such have just finished but the Occident still launches raids including the exploits of the notorious Catalan Company, i.e. the Knights of Death, who enjoyed victories in Asia Minor in 1302 and 1311. The Isle of Miracles (\\"Imede saar\\"; 1964) This short novel forms an interlude in Ristikivi's production. It is an allegory, based in part on the works of famous utopian authors such as Thomas More and Tommaso Campanella, and especially the Platonic idea of a good society. The utopia is an archipelago called Allotria, which has features of our modern Western society. Mankind has here become a victim of its own freedom. The book is therefore an anti-utopian work. Allotria is pitted against the Heliodorian realm that is the remains of a former tyranny and is hidden within the crater of a volcano. This is an aggressive nation and Allotria, a welfare state, ignores its threatening behaviour. The book is thus an allegorical examination of how democracies and totalitarian countries interact. How egotistical can democracies be, or should perhaps they be led by idealists who demand a certain degree of national sacrifice? The allegory is written in the form of a voyage in 1348 to Allotria. It is altogether lighter in tone than the previous historical trilogy. The Biographical Trilogy - The Bridal Veil (\\"Mõrsjalinik\\"; 1965); The Song of Joy (\\"Rõõmulaul\\"; 1966); The Apprentice to Sorcery (\\"Nõiduse õpilane\\"; 1967) The Bridal Veil is the story of Catarina Benincasa (1347-1380) better known as Saint Catherine of Siena. Ristikivi steers clear of the central mystical part of her life, instead focusing on her via dolorosa to achieve sainthood in this life. As a woman and an idealist in a rough man's world, she is often treated with suspicion. She hopes to conquer the evils of this world by moral means. The novel describes her personal struggle, but also the political ones in 14th century Italy. Each chapter is divided into two parts. The first part is more like a chronicle, the second is the personal view of someone who knew Catherine. Christian ideals and existential problems are dealt with in this novel. The second novel of this trilogy, The Song of Joy tells the story of the mediaeval Welsh bard and composer David and asks the question whether the evils of this world can be countered by music. The title alludes to Ode to Joy i.e. Schiller and Beethoven. But David's music appears not to improve this world in any way, because as he grows more accomplished, the world around him grows more evil. A key theme is the road of any person through life, and to what extent it is possible for this world to be improved by the acts of individuals. It is also about turning the other cheek. The Apprentice to Sorcery, the third novel, is about the mediaeval thinker and physician Johannes Faber, a scientist in the spirit of Faust. He finds himself caught between the exigencies of science and church dogma. The action of the novel takes place during the last three days of Johannes Faber's life while he tell the Domican priest Anselm everything about his life as he awaits being burnt at the stake. This novel is an elegy, but intellectual joy shines through. The Gates of Sigtuna (\\"Sigtuna väravad\\"; 1968) (short prose) This book consists of ten short-stories with titles such as The Philosopher Who Did Not Learn How to Keep Silent, Creator of One's Own Joy, Don Juan and the Virgin Johanna. Ristikivi is again examining moral paradoxes and dilemmas. The Don Juan story is where he meets Joan of Arc, perhaps in heaven, and they have their dialogue. The Last Trilogy - Noble Hearts or Two Friends in Florence (\\"Õilsad südamed ehk kaks sõpra Firenzes\\"; 1970); Dragon's Teeth (\\"Lohe hambad\\"; 1970); A Double Game (\\"Kahekordne mäng\\"; 1972) As the critic Reet Neithal puts it (op. cit.) Ristikivi both develops and sums up his oeuvre in this, his last, trilogy. The first novel, Noble Hearts or Two Friends in Florence has a rather complex structure and is set in the London of the 1960s in the theatre world where a play set in Cromwellian England in the 1640s is being staged. This play in turn describes the life and death of Savonarola in Florence in 1398. Ristikivi uses this book to examine the politics of his day by way of analogy. history repeats itself. Friendships are hollow, and people are scheming all the time. There are also short scenes from the play that Ristikivi has himself made up. The narrator even makes a little topical joke on page 10 of this novel, when referring to the author of the play, Richard Cliff, that \\"a certain Mr Cliff Richard\\" may have borrowed his pseudonym from him. The second novel, Dragon's Teeth is set in the Spain and Low Countries of the 16th century, as well as describing the life of a Catalan refugee in Paris in 1949, Joaquim Barrera, whose son Pablo is translating and commenting on his father's trilogy. The structure is therefore a novel within a novel. In the trilogy, there are two main characters, the idealist Ruy Pons de Granollers is described in the light of political goals and pointless sacrifice, and a more down to earth Fleming, Jan Bleis. This is to an extent a metanovel about the philosophy of history from a pessimistic point of view. The third novel, A Double Game is once again an examination of history and morality, but in the form of a murder mystery. Some of the detective work has to be done by the reader. A Rome Diary (\\"Rooma päevik\\"; 1976) Ristikivi's last book is set in the 18th century Rome, among the ruins and historical buildings. It was published one year before the author's death. As critic Reet Neithal describes the book as: \\"[Ristikivi's] swan song, a finely textured and poetic travelogue that does not so much describe the travel venues -- the famous monuments of Rome - as the mood of the protagonist and his actions as a result of these. This subtle spiritual diary is one of the author's most personal works\\". The protagonist (i.e. author of the diary) is called Kaspar von Schmerzburg (\\"Schmerz\\" being the German for pain). He walks among the ruins of what was once a huge empire - i.e. the Roman one. He walks in the catacombs and tunnels, and thus sees what is hidden as well as well as easily viewed from the street. Ristikivi shows his more melancholy and pessimistic side. ==BibliographyNovels in chronological order=== * Tuli ja raud (Fire and Iron, 1938)Reprints: 1944, 1978, 1984 * Õige mehe koda (The Abode of a Righteous Man, 1940)Reprints: 1943, 1950, 1984; Finnish translation: Oikeamielisen miehen talo, 1953 * Rohtaed (The Herb Garden, 1942)Reprints: 1948, 1995; Finnish translation: Yrttitarha, 1945 * Kõik mis kunagi oli (All That Ever Was, 1946)Reprint: 2000 * Ei juhtunud midagi (Nothing Happened, 1947)Reprint: * Hingede öö (The Night of Souls, 1953)Reprint: 1991 * Põlev lipp (The Burning Flag, 1961)Reprint 1990 * Viimne linn (The Last Bastion, 1962)Reprint: 1990 * Surma ratsanikud (The Horsemen of Death, 1963)Reprint:1990 * Imede saar (The Isle of Wonders, 1964)Reprint: 1966 * Mõrsjalinik (The Bridal Veil, 1965)Reprint: 1992 * Rõõmulaul (The Song of Joy, 1966)Reprint: 1993; Russian translation 1997 * Nõiduse õpilane (The Apprentice to Sorcery, 1967)Reprint: 1994 * Õilsad südamed (Noble Hearts, 1970) * Lohe hambad (Dragon's Teeth, 1970)Reprint: 1987; Russian translation: 1997 * Kahekordne mäng (A Double Game, 1972) * Rooma päevik (A Rome Diary, 1976)Reprint: 2001 ===Collections of short prose=== * Sigtuna väravad (The Gates of Sigtuna, 1968) * Klaassilmadega Kristus (Christ with Eyes of Glass, 1980) ===Other publications=== * Semud (Pals; children's book about puppies), Tallinn, 1936.Reprint with Sellid, Eesti Raamat (publisher), Tallinn, 1983 * Sellid (Chums; children's book about kittens), Tallinn, 1938.Reprints: Estonian Writers' Co-operative (publisher), Lund, Sweden, 1972, and with Semud, Eesti Raamat (publisher), Tallinn, 1983 * Eesti kirjanduse lugu (History of Estonian Literature; monograph), Tõrvik (publisher), Vadstena, Sweden, 1954, 136 pages. * Bernard Kangro (biography of the author), Estonian Writers' Co-operative (publisher), Lund, Sweden, 1967, 80 pages. * Inimese teekond (A Journey of a Man; collected poems), Estonian Writers' Co-operative (publisher), Lund, Sweden, 1972, reprint Eesti Raamat (publisher), Tallinn, 1990, 76 pages. * Kirjad romaanist (Letters About the Novel; correspondence with Bernard Kangro about the novel), Estonian Writers' Co-operative (publisher), Lund, Sweden, 1985, 80 pages. * Hurmakägu on surma nägu (The Enchanting Cuckoo is the Face of Death; crime novel written in Swedish under the pseudonym of Christian Steen, translated into Estonian by Jaan Kross), Kupar (publisher), Tallinn, 1992, 190 pages. * Viimne vabadus (The Last Freedom, collection of essays), editor Janika Kronberg, Ilmamaa (publisher), Tartu, 1996, 544 pages. * Päevaraamat (1957–1968) (Diary, 1957-1968; diaries), editor Janika Kronberg, Varrak (publisher), Tallinn, 2008, 1,112 pages. ===Biographies and reference works about Karl Ristikivi (in Estonian)=== There are, as yet, no book-length reference works or longer articles about the life and works of Karl Ristikivi in any other language but Estonian.

Locally, the fish is known as охридска пастрмка (ohridska pastrmka) in Macedonian and koran in Albanian. ==Taxonomy== Ohrid trout is part of the brown trout complex, so its taxonomic status is controversial. It has, however, been deemed to be genetically sufficiently distinct to be regarded as a distinct species for conservation arguments.Suśnik S, Snoj A, Wilson I, Mrdak D, Weiss S (2007) Historical demography of brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the Adriatic drainage including the putative S. letnica endemic to Lake Ohrid.

(abstract) ===Subdivision of the Ohrid trout=== Within the Ohrid trout, up to four intralacustrine forms have been separated, which are treated as distinct species in the FishBase and by the IUCN. Morphological or molecular data so far do not support this division, though. These forms are characterized by different breeding areas and different breeding times, by which they are thought to be reproductively isolated from each other. The four forms or species include: * Salmo balcanicus breeds in the outlet of the lake in its northwest end, in October–January; it is possibly extinct. * Salmo lumi breeds in January–February in the tributaries of the lake. * Salmo aphelios breeds in May–July near springs of the eastern shore of the lake. * Salmo letnica breeds in January–February. In addition to the Ohrid trout, Lake Ohrid has another endemic and truly distinct salmonid, Salmo ohridanus. ==Fisheries and gastronomy== Ohrid Trouts in a fish shop in Pogradec, Albania The Ohrid trout is a specialty in Macedonian and Albanian gastronomy; it is used for soups and other dishes.

A fishing ban has been imposed by the government of Macedonia, since 2004 and until 2014.

The Ohrid trout was the dominant species in the lake at the time, but then lost its position during the 1980s, because the breeding program was discontinued, and because of failure of natural spawning due to water level variations related to working schedules of the hydroelectric plant, Vrla. Some fish still spawn successfully in the flooded tributaries of the lake. During the 1990s, bleak (Alburnus alburnus) and roach (Rutilus rutilus) from Lake Ohrid were introduced into Vlasina as food for the Ohrid trout. Also a yearly program of artificial spawning and conservation efforts started.Vlasinsko Jezero solair.eunet.rs ===Introduction to Americas=== As stated in a report by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Ohrid trout was stocked in Parvin Lake, Big Creek Reservoir, and Turquoise Lake in Colorado, in 1969; seven lakes in northern Minnesota, including Strawberry Lake, Chester Lake, and Big Trout Lake; an unspecified locality in Montana; Watauga Lake Reservoir and South Holston Reservoir in Tennessee; and a few reservoirs in Wyoming, including Viva Naughton Reservoir on the Green River, lakes near Casper, and the North Platte River. The USGS report states that the trout was brought into the United States by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and shipped to a federal hatchery in Iowa and a state hatchery in Minnesota. The eggs from Yugoslavia were hatched in the United States; young fish were released into several small lakes in northern Minnesota in 1968 and 1969. The species was first stocked in Colorado in 1969. Introductions into most of these states failed.

It was founded by a group of clockmakers in 1858, and has its current premises at Upton Hall in Nottinghamshire, which includes a museum of clock history. ==History== Upton Hall The BHI was founded in 1858 by a small group of clockmakers, one of whom was Edward Daniel Johnson. Their aim was to unify the British horological industry and trades in the face of large numbers of imports of clocks and watches from abroad. The Institute was an immediate success and within a year it had founded its own museum and library; it also began to offer evening classes in clock- and watch-making. The journal of the Institute is the Horological Journal, which has been published monthly since September 1858. It is claimed to be the oldest continuously-published technical journal in the world. ==Upton Hall== The current premises of the BHI are at Upton Hall in Nottinghamshire, England. Its primary role is that of education, providing a standardised set of examinations for training horologists. It also maintains a list of members whom it considers sufficiently qualified to repair clocks and watches, and who adhere to a strict code of practice. Upton Hall is also home to the charitable Museum of Timekeeping at the British Horological Institute, which includes the original BHI Museum and Library. ==Membership== The Institute offers a number of different kinds of membership. These include: ;Associate Membership :Any individual with an interest in horology may subscribe as a member. ;Accredited: Member of the BHI (MBHI) BHI members can gain accredited Member- level status by passing the BHI examinations at Level 4. Accredited members at this level may use the postnominals MBHI. Accredited: Fellow of the BHI (FBHI) The next level of BHI accreditation is Fellowship. This can be gained by passing the BHI examinations at Level 5 or by making a successful application to the BHI based upon outstanding career achievements. Accredited members at this level may use the postnominals FBHI. Corporate membership and business partnership are also available. ==Museum of Timekeeping== A Post Office speaking clock machine, on display at the museum The Museum of Timekeeping is also housed at the home of the British Horological Institute. The Museum of Timekeeping is an independent charitable Museum (Registered Charity Number 1176495), established in 1994 to hold in trust the collection and library, brought together by BHI members since its founding in 1858. The Museum includes a collection of clocks, watches and timepieces and associated clock and watchmaking tools and ephemera. It can be visited during seasonal opening hours, plus a range of special events, or by booking a private group visit. The Museum of Timekeeping Library is one of very few existing specialised libraries dealing primarily with horology. It is open to researchers by appointment, and its holding includes a number of rare documents, papers, letters and books, particularly dealing with the high points of British horology in the 18th and early 19th century, but its catalogue contains comparatively few titles published in the last several decades. An exception is THROUGH THE GOLDEN AGE – Charles Gretton – Watch and Clockmaking, a 660-page volume about the life, era, and creations of celebrated clockmaker and watchmaker Charles Gretton (1647–1731), published in 2016. ==BHI Gold Medal== The institute's gold medal for an outstanding contribution to horology has been awarded to: *1928 Frank Watson Dyson - Astronomer Royal who introduced Greenwich pips. *1930 Charles Édouard Guillaume - developed Invar and Elinvar *1931 William Hamilton Shortt (1881-1971) - noted horologist who devised the Shortt–Synchronome clock *1946 Frank Hope-Jones (1867–1950) - developed electrical timekeeping, including Synchronome system *1947 Rupert Gould - restored John Harrison's chronometer *1947 Warren Alvin Marrison - developed the quartz crystal clock *1948 Harold Spencer Jones - Astronomer Royal *1957 John Harwood - invented the self-winding wristwatch *1981 George Daniels - developed the co-axial escapement now used by the Omega watch company. ==See also== * Upton Hall - the headquarters of the BHI. ==References * Home page of the BHI * Museum of Timekeeping * BBC interview with Viscount Alan Midleton, curator of the British Horological Institute * BBC pictures of the British Horological Institute Category:Organizations established in 1858 Category:Time in the United Kingdom Category:Horological organizations Category:Organisations based in Nottinghamshire Category:Professional associations based in the United Kingdom Category:Museums in Nottinghamshire Category:Horological museums in the United Kingdom Category:1858 establishments in the United Kingdom ","title":"British Horological Institute"},{"id":"6199975","text":"\\"A Trick of the Night\\" is a mid-tempo ballad recorded by English girl group Bananarama. It was written and produced by Steve Jolley and Tony Swain and released as the final single from Bananarama's album True Confessions. The song was re-recorded for UK single release, with new synthesizer tracks and vocal arrangement by the Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW) production trio, at the request of London Records for the UK release. The cautionary message in the lyrics are directed towards a friend who has gone to seek his fortune in the big city and ended up a rentboy. \\"A Trick of the Night\\" was a top-40 hit in the UK, peaking at number 32. The SAW-remixed version received the most airplay in their home country, while the ballad version stalled at number 76 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The single spent one week in the Australian Kent Music Report top 100 singles chart, where it peaked at number 99. \\"A Trick of the Night\\" peaked at number 24 in Ireland. The song was included on the CD version of Greatest Hits Collection as a bonus track; it was not included on the vinyl version nor their 2001 compilation The Very Best of Bananarama. It was included on the soundtrack to the 1986 American film Jumpin' Jack Flash. Lyrics from the Number One Mix, were sampled on Bananarama's \\"I Heard a Rumour\\" B-side song \\"Clean-Cut Boy\\". ==Music video== Two videos were filmed for the song. The North American version was directed by Andy Morahan featured the girls singing the song in a house at night, with their images projected on movie screens. The release of the single in the UK was delayed until February 1987, so that Bananarama could participate in a BBC television show called In at the Deep End. Each week Chris Serle or Paul Heiney would have to master a new skill - in this case, Paul Heiney had to master the art of directing a pop music video (the episode was similar to MTV's Making the Video programme) for this song.

For example, guild skills shared by the party, skills similar to Final Fantasy XI's combos, and manga-like illustrations. The basic setting's world, named Erindyll continent, is an orthodox fantasy world. In 2008, the new series Arianrhod SagaSpecial site of Arianrhod Saga in Fujimi Shobo began and the new setting of another continent named Aldion is provided for a campaign setting suitable for war chronicle stories.

Every player character gains 5 or 6(human only) fate points at the start. If a player rolls over two dice that show a 6, the role is critical success, the number of dice to determine damage are also increased same as the number of dice that show a 6. ===Classes=== Arianrhod RPG used a dual-class system. Players can choose from 4 base classes (Warrior, Acolyte, Mage, Thief) for the main class, the definer of the core abilities.

A Disney creation in the Silly Symphony series. One objection si that it resembles too keenly a previous release by the same maker called Springtime. In both creations weather breezes are denoted through leaping and contortionist insects, plants, and in a similar manner. Withal, however, it has its snickers.

The term is used most frequently in relationship to the sacraments of Marriage and Holy Orders. Some canonical impediments can be dispensed by the competent authority (usually the local ordinary but some impediments are reserved to the Apostolic See) as defined in Canon Law. ==Impediments to marriage== Roman Catholic sacramental theology teaches that the ministers of the sacrament of holy matrimony are the man and woman, and therefore any marriage contracted voluntarily between two baptized and unmarried adults is valid, though under ordinary circumstances the marriage must be witnessed by clergy to be licit. However, various provisions in current canon law outline extraordinary circumstances that would form impediments to marital validity. ===Validity vs. liceity=== The validity of an action is distinguished from its being licit in that the former pertains to its integrity while the latter its legality. (An analogous illustration might be that of a disbarred lawyer who wins a court case; the verdict is not overturned, but the attorney is still subject to sanctions. Similarly, a priest who has been laicized, suspended, or excommunicated cannot licitly celebrate Mass, but should he nonetheless do so the Mass is still considered valid.Encyclopedia of Catholicism, (Frank K. Flinn, and J. Gordon Melton, eds), Facts on File 2007 , p. 619) Impediments to marriage are classified according to many different criteria. ===Diriment vs. impedient=== In regard to their effect on the sacrament,1917 CIC c. 1036 impediments are either diriment, which invalidate an attempted marriage, or prohibitive (or impedient), which make a marriage illicit but valid. \\"Diriment\\" comes from the Latin word dirimens (\\"separating\\"), that is, an impediment that means the couple cannot be joined.\\"What is it that Prevents a Marriage from Being a Marriage?\\", Church of the Holy Cross, Dover, Delaware The 1983 Code of Canon Law does not list prohibitive impediments as such, and thus the distinction between validity and licitness is less clear than in previous formularies. ===Of divine law vs. of ecclesiastical law=== In regard to their origin, impediments are either from divine law, and so cannot be dispensed, or from ecclesiastical law, and so can be dispensed by the competent Church authority. Under the 1983 Code of Canon Law, ecclesiastical impediments only apply to marriages where one or both of the parties is Catholic. Under the prior 1917 Code, ecclesiastical impediments applied to the marriages of non-Catholic Christians as well, unless specifically exempted. Note that, as clarified by articles 2 and 4 of Dignitas Connubii,cf. CCEO cc. 780 and 781 the Catholic Church now recognizes the diriment impediments of other (i.e., non-Catholic) Churches and ecclesial communities when their members are parties to a marriage. ===Other distinctions=== Impediments are also classified as follows: * public, which can be proved in the external forum, or occult, which cannot be so proved;see CIC c. 1074, CCEO c. 791 * absolute, which apply to one party regardless of the other party, or relative, which apply only in relation to certain other parties; * permanent or temporary, according to the duration of the impediment; and * whether they can be dispensed by the local ordinary under ordinary circumstances, or whether their dispensation is reserved to the PopeCIC c. 1078, CCEO c. 795) ===List of diriment impediments to marriage=== *Age.CIC c. 1083, CCEO c. 800 If the man is under 16 years of age, or the woman is under 14 years of age, then their marriage is invalid. This is an ecclesiastical impediment, and so does not apply to a marriage between two non-Catholics. However, in a marriage between a Catholic and a non-Catholic, the age limitation applies to the non-Catholic party as well.New Commentary, Beal, et al., p. 1284. Each national episcopal conference has the authority to set a higher minimum age as a prohibitive impediment. In general, individual bishops do not have this authority (cf. CIC c. 1075 §2). In Canada, and also in New Zealand, this minimum age has been set to 18 years old for both parties.Canon Law Annotated, Caparros, et al., pp. 1669 and 1717. In England and Wales, this minimum age has been set to be in accordance with civil law (i.e., 16 years old for both parties).Canon Law Annotated, Caparros, et al., p. 1677, and Canon Law Digest, v. 11 (1983–1985), p. 263. In Gambia, Liberia, and Sierre Leone, this minimum age has been set to 18 years old for the man and 16 years old for the woman.Canon Law Annotated, Caparros, et al., p. 1689. In the Philippines, this minimum has been set to 21 years old for the bridegroom, and 18 years old for the bride.Canon Law Annotated, Caparros, et al., p. 1762, and Canon Law Digest, v. 11 (1983–1985), p. 264. In South Africa, and also in Switzerland, this minimum age has been set to be in accordance with civil law.Canon Law Annotated, Caparros, et al., p. 1783 (for South Africa), and Canon Law Digest, v. 11 (1983–1985), p. 265 (for Switzerland). In Nigeria, the episcopal conference has delegated the authority to set a higher prohibitive minimum age to the individual bishops.Canon Law Annotated, Caparros, et al., p. 1741. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has not enacted a higher prohibitive minimum age for marriage.See the USCCB website for the that have been enacted. *Impotence (physical capacity for consummation lacking).CIC c. 1084, CCEO c. 801 Per Canon 1084 §3 \\"Without prejudice to the provisions of Canon 1098, sterility- the absolute or probable inability to have children due to defects or abnormalities in the reproductive organs or other associated organs, or of the germ cells (the ova and sperm), neither forbids nor invalidates a marriage.\\" Both parties, however, must be physically capable of completed vaginal intercourse, wherein the man ejaculates \\"true semen\\", even if the amount is small and/or if there are no viable sperm, into the woman's vagina (even if the cervix or uterus are absent, the ova are absent or non-viable, or the vagina is deformed). (See for details.) To invalidate a marriage, the impotence must be perpetual (i.e., incurable) and antecedent to the marriage. The impotence can either be absolute or relative. This impediment is generally considered to derive from divine natural law, and so cannot be dispensed.New Commentary, Beal, et al., p. 1286. The reason behind this impediment is explained in the Summa Theologica:Summa Theologica, Supplement to the Third Part, question 58, article 1 . \\"In marriage there is a contract whereby one is bound to pay the other the marital debt: wherefore just as in other contracts, the bond is unfitting if a person bind himself to what he cannot give or do, so the marriage contract is unfitting, if it be made by one who cannot pay the marital debt.\\" *Prior bond.CIC c. 1085, CCEO c. 802 Previous marriages, whether conducted in the Catholic Church, in another church, or by the State. All previous attempts at marriage by both parties wishing to marry must be declared null prior to a wedding in the Catholic Church, without regard to the religion of the party previously married. Divine, absolute, temporary. The impediment of prior bond only arises from a valid marriage. An invalid marriage does not give rise to the impediment. *Disparity of cult.CIC c. 1086, CCEO c. 803 A marriage between a Catholic and a non-baptized person is invalid, unless this impediment is dispensed by the local ordinary. Ecclesiastical, relative. *Sacred orders.CIC c. 1087, CCEO c. 804 One of the parties has received sacred orders. Ecclesiastical, absolute, permanent (unless dispensed by the Apostolic See). *Public perpetual vow of chastity.CIC c. 1088, CCEO c. 805 One of the parties has made a public perpetual (not just temporary vows or the novitiate or postulancy) vow of chastity. Ecclesiastical, absolute, permanent (unless dispensed by the Apostolic See). *Abduction.CIC c. 1089, CCEO c. 806 One of the parties has been abducted with the view of contracting marriage. Ecclesiastical, temporary. *Crimen.CIC c. 1090, CCEO c. 807 One or both of the parties has brought about the death of a spouse with the view of entering marriage with each other. Ecclesiastical, relative, permanent (unless dispensed by the Apostolic See). Under the Decretals of Pope Gregory IX, the requirements were that either the adulterous pair should promise marriage after the death of the spouse, or that they should attempt marriage while the spouse was still living. While both partners had to be aware that they are committing adultery, affected ignorance, ignorance from refusal to investigate what they are doing, does not remove it. If the pair who wish to marry co-operated to kill the spouse of one of them, in order that they might be free to marry, the impediment is invoked, even if they had not committed adultery. Likewise, if one of an adulterous pair killed a spouse (of either partner) in order to marry, the impediment is invoked. Only the pope may dispense this impediment; there are no instances in which any pope has done so.Catholic Encyclopedia \\"Impediment of Crime\\" *Consanguinity.CIC c. 1091, CCEO c. 808 The parties are closely related by blood. Ecclesiastical or divine, depending on the degree of relationship. Relative, permanent. *Affinity.CIC c. 1092, CCEO c. 809 The parties are related by marriage in a prohibited degree. Ecclesiastical, relative, permanent. *Public propriety.CIC c. 1093, CCEO c. 810 The parties are \\"related\\" by notorious concubinage. (Example: A man and a woman live together without marrying; this impediment prevents the man marrying the woman's mother or daughter–but not the woman herself–even if the cohabiting relationship has ended or the woman has died.) Ecclesiastical, relative, permanent. *Adoption.CIC c. 1094, CCEO c. 812. See also The parties are related by adoption. Ecclesiastical, relative, permanent. *Spiritual relationship.CCEO c. 811, also see 1917 CIC c. 1079 One of the parties is the godparent of the other. This no longer applies in the Latin Rite, but still applies in the Eastern Catholic Churches. ===Other factors which invalidate marriage=== *Lack of form. When a marriage of a Catholic takes place without following the laws and rites of the Catholic Church. Such a marriage does not even have the appearance of validity, and consequently, does not enjoy the presumption of validity. *Coercion. This impediment exists if one of the parties is pressured by any circumstances to enter into marriage. (In order for the impediment to cease, the situation must change so that the party can marry freely of his or her own will.) *Psychological immaturity or mental incapacity. To enter into sacramental marriage, both parties must understand and have the capacity to accept the minimum of what it entails. *Refusal to have children. One of the goods of marriage is children. A man or woman physically capable of fathering or, respectively, conceiving a child but who intends never to have children may not marry in the Catholic Church. *Exclusion of fidelity. Fidelity of each party to the other is a good of marriage. If this is specifically excluded in the mind of either party, the couple may not marry in the Catholic Church. ==Impediments to ordination to the priesthood== Impediments to the priesthood are divided into \\"irregularities\\", which are permanent unless removed by the competent authority and \\"simple impediments\\" which may pass with time without action of an ecclesiastical authority. Canon Law also lists various impediments to the exercise of a priesthood that has already been conferred. The bishop can remove most irregularities and simple impediments, except for those involving public apostasy, heresy, or schism; abortion or murder, even if in secret; and existing marriages. Irregularities that cannot be removed by the bishop can be removed by the Holy See (i.e. the Pope or the appropriate dicastery of the Roman Curia1983 Code of Canon Law, Can. 361). ===Irregularities=== *Mental illness that prevents fulfillment of the duties of the priesthood.Can. 1041, 1° *Physical incapacity to perform the rites of the Church. A priest must have his hands, or at least working artificial hands, to celebrate the sacraments. He must also be able to ingest the wheat host and the wine. (A complete and permanent gluten intolerance, for example, is an impediment). *Apostasy, heresy or schism. Previous rejection of the faith which was public and notorious is an impediment, until and unless it is recanted and has been absolved.Can. 1041, 2° *Attempted marriage. The attempt to marry despite an existing valid marriage or vow of chastity, or the marriage to a woman who had an existing valid marriage or vow of chastity forms an irregularity even after the death of the spouse.Can. 1041, 3° *Participation in an abortion or murder. Any prior act, statement, financial or moral support which contributed positively to a specific case of successful abortion or murder is an impediment. This could include driving a woman to the abortion clinic or paying for her abortion. Paying taxes to a state that funds abortions would generally not be considered a \\"positive\\" contribution to the abortion.Can. 1041, 4° *Attempted suicide, self-mutilation, or mutilation of others. Any premeditated attempt at suicide disqualifies one as a candidate for ordination. The act of mutilation must be performed graviter et dolose in order for it to be an impediment (cutting off a hand or foot, castration, etc.) Can. 1041, 5° *Attempt to perform an act proper to the priesthood or episcopate. This applies to acts such as hearing confessions, etc. when one has not received the proper ordination to do so.Can. 1041, 6° ===Simple impediments to ordination=== *Previous marriage. This applies to Latin Rite priests and bishops and Eastern Catholic bishops only. All previous marriages must be declared null, or the spouse must have died. In the case of a deceased spouse, most bishops require that the children be raised to adulthood before the man can undertake a vocation to the priesthood.Can. 1042, 1° *Political office or other positions that a priest is not permitted to occupy. This impediment disappears as soon as the candidate is no longer in office.Can. 1042, 2° *Recent baptism. The bishop must determine when a newly baptized person is sufficiently mature in his faith to undertake an ordained ministry in the Church.Can. 1042, 3° ===Irregularities to the exercise of the priesthood=== *Reception of ordination with an irregularity. If the irregularity is not brought to the bishop's attention before ordination, a priest might be ordained who has an irregularity. Such a priest cannot exercise his ministry until the irregularity is removed.Can. 1044 §1, 1° *Apostasy, heresy or schism that occurs after ordination, if this act is publicly known.Can. 1044 §1, 2° *Commission of acts that would have led to an irregularity.Can. 1044 §1, 3° ===Simple impediments to the exercise of the priesthood=== *Reception of ordination with a simple impediment.Can. 1044 §2, 1° *Physical or mental illness that prevents fulfillment of the duties of the priesthood, until the bishop determines that the priest may resume the exercise of his ministry.Can. 1044 §2, 2° ==See also== *Declaration of nullity *Validation of marriage ==ReferencesBibliography=== * 1983 Code of Canon Law for the Latin Rite (CIC) * 1990 Code of Canon Law for the Eastern Rites (CCEO) * Dignitas Connubii (Instruction to be Observed by Diocesan and Interdiocesan Tribunals in Handling Causes of the Nullity of Marriage), Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2005. . * New Commentary on the Code of Canon Law, ed. by John P.

The player controls Robin as he robs from the rich to give to the poor, adventures through Sherwood Forest, defeats the sheriff's henchmen, gathers special objects and saves peasants. Heroic acts increase Robin's popularity among NPCs. Archery plays an important role in gameplay. The isometric interface developed for The Adventures of Robin Hood by Millennium Interactive is similar to the interface used in Populous. Robin Hood's interface was later used for Rome: Pathway to Power. ==Development== The Adventures of Robin Hood began development in July 1990, and was released in September 1991 for Amiga, Atari ST, and DOS. British gaming magazine The One interviewed Steve Grand, Robin Hood's programmer, for information regarding its development in a pre- release interview. According to Grand, Robin Hood was initially conceived as a game about cowboys, however, he expresses that \\"We got part way through it though, and feelings changed about where it was going and what it was going to be. Then someone idly suggested Robin Hood and I thought 'Yeah I'll do it.\\" Grand notes adaptations of Robin Hood in pop culture, stating that \\"Everybody knows the Errol Flynn side of Robin Hood, but not a lot of people realise that a major part of the legend is mythological\\", and expresses that both 'Hollywood' depictions of Robin Hood and the mythological interpretation are incorporated into the game. The icons for spells in Robin Hood are based upon Anglo-Saxon paganism and Norse mythology. A major design aspect of Robin Hood is making the game 'flexible' towards differing playstyles, and Grand states in regards to this that he \\"didn't want it to be the kind of adventure where you've got one single fixed sequence and if you cock up one bit of it you've blown the lot. There are any number ways of winning - and hopefully there'll be any number of ways of losing too.\\" Robin Hood was created using a custom adventure-creation engine created by Grand, titled Gulliver, and formerly titled Microcosm. Grand cites the Gulliver engine's NPC management as an advantage that it has over other engines, stating that \\"All the people [in the game] are behaving consistently all the time, they're all there, they're all doing things off stage. It's not like rooms [which] disappear when you're not in them.\\" Grand furthermore notes how NPCs 'notice' other NPCs and interact with one another, expressing that \\"What's clever about it is that there are 40 people in there who can see or not see, hear or not hear eachother [sic] - that's proper interaction and the system doesn't cheat.\\" Every sprite in Robin Hood is marked with AI routines, and Grand states that \\"The whole system is object oriented, they've all got their own rule bases.\\" At that stage of development, Robin Hood was stated to be coded with 600 rules, with this number projected to 'about 1,500' when the game was finished. Each of the 'around forty' characters and objects in Robin Hood have AI routines for different scenarios, and every sprite has 32 attributes. In the case of characters, these attributes are stated by Grand to \\"make up their soul\\", and determine factors such as \\"how hungry they are, how optimistic they're feeling, who they like, [and] what sort of people they are\\". The values for these attributes change frequently due to every decision being determined by one or more attributes, and these decisions are impacted by what characters are nearby. Grand expresses that his long-term goal for Robin Hood was for it feel like an open world game, stating that \\"Ultimately what I want to do is write a computer game with no plot in it whatsoever. I just want to build the world and put the people in it so that you can do whatever you want to do.\\" Robin Hood has a total of 64 different locations, and Grand expresses that while \\"Isometric [graphics are] a bit dated\\", \\"it's a good way of getting 3D on the cheap. At the moment the system can't do first person 3D fast enough - even now about 90 percent of the processing time is just taken up by plotting screens.\\" Memory restrictions were noted as a difficulty in Robin Hood's development, and an example is given of a swan that 'doubles as' a coffin; if a character dies and the coffin is loaded into memory, the swan disappears. Robin Hood's graphics were first drafted by Steve Grand, and then finalized by graphic artist Robin Chapman. ==Reception== Reviewer Gary Whitta gave the PC version 820 out of a possible 1000 points, praising the graphics, controls and sense of involvement.Whitta, Gary (October 1991). Robin Hood (review of PC version). ACE, p. 64-65. The One gave the Amiga version of Robin Hood an overall score of 80%, calling it \\"atmospheric\\" and stating that the changing of seasons in-game gives \\"a sense of urgency\\", further noting how NPCs \\"lead independent lives\\" outside of the player's involvement. The One praises the game's flavor text and sense of humour, expressing that humour \\"is very difficult to achieve in a computer game\\". The One compares the game's graphics to Populous, but states that the gameplay is dissimilar, as \\"the map is much smaller and the action is directed towards achieving one specific goal.\\" The One also praises the amount of content and Robin Hood's replayability, noting the amount of dialogue with NPCs and the ability to solve puzzles differently. The One criticises the amount of time it takes to get to different locations, saying that \\"it can be annoying waiting for Robin to cross from one side of the map to the other, particularly because he can only walk in four directions.\\" ==References== *Upchurch, David (July 1991).

He enrolled at the National University of the Littoral, in Santa Fe, and graduated with a degree in chemical engineering. He taught there from 1972 to 1976, and became a Peronist Youth activist at the time. This forced him to leave the country following the March 1976 coup, and returning from exile in Peru in 1977 to visit family in Diamante he was detained. Following the return of democracy in 1983, Obeid worked as a chemist in a polyurethane plant. He remained active in Peronist politics, however, and in 1987 was elected to the Santa Fe City Council. He became President of the Council in 1989, and when Mayor Carlos Aurelio Martínez resigned later that year, he succeeded him as mayor. He married Elba Inés Kemer, and they had five children. Obeid was elected mayor in his own right in 1991, and later served as President of Argentine Federation of Cities (1992–93) and as representative for Santa Fe Province in the 1994 Constitutional Convention. He was elected governor of the province for the first time in 1995, winning an election that was fraught with problems, including a breakdown in the computer system counting the ballots that forced a recount to be done by hand. Obeid was declared the winner after 37 days, subsequent to charges of fraud and manipulation. He was backed by outgoing governor Carlos Reutemann and Buenos Aires Province Governor Eduardo Duhalde, narrowly defeating Alliance candidate Horacio Usandizaga and an alternative Peronist candidate backed by President Carlos Menem, Rosario Mayor Héctor Cavallero. He served until 1999, when former Governor Reutemann was returned by voters to a second four-year term. The provincial constitution of Santa Fe does not allow for reelection of a governor, and Obeid was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 1999. He was then returned by voters as governor for a second, non-consecutive term in 2003. Under his administration, and following his initiative, the provincial legislature repealed the controversial electoral law called Ley de Lemas, which had allowed Obeid to twice win the governorship after obtaining fewer votes than his closest opponent. Termed out of office, Obeid headed the Front for Victory Santa Fe party list for seats in the Chamber of Deputies. His term as governor ended in December 2007 and he was succeeded by the Socialist Mayor of Rosario, Hermes Binner. He served one more full term as Congressman from 2007 to 2011, and returned to Congress in 2013. Obeid died the following month, however, of a pulmonary embolism; he was 66. ==References== Category:1947 births Category:2014 deaths Category:People from Entre Ríos Province Category:Argentine people of Lebanese descent Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:National University of the Littoral alumni Category:Argentine engineers Category:Mayors of places in Argentina Category:Governors of Santa Fe Province Category:Justicialist Party politicians Category:Members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies Category:Deaths from pulmonary embolism ","title":"Jorge Obeid"},{"id":"6200062","text":"Candiano-Popescu, ca. 1866 Alexandru Candiano-Popescu (; January 27, 1841 – June 25, 1901) was a Romanian army general, lawyer, journalist, and poet, best known for his role in the Republic of Ploieşti conspiracy. ==Biography== He joined the military school in 1854, becoming an artillery sub-lieutenant in 1859. As a captain, he took part in the coup of February 11, 1866, that toppled Alexandru Ioan Cuza, the ruling Domnitor of the United Principalities. In 1867, he resigned from the Romanian Army and started two newspapers: Perseverenţa and Democraţia, in which he supported democratic ideas. Considered a \\"political agitator\\", he was arrested three times, including once in Austria-Hungary, where he was imprisoned for several weeks in the fortress of Arad. In August 1870, he took part in the republican insurrection against the Hohenzollern Domnitor, Carol I, in Ploieşti. The movement was suppressed and he was charged along with 40 other people, but the Târgovişte court of law acquitted them. In his tongue-in-cheek account of the insurrection (Boborul), Ion Luca Caragiale identified Candiano-Popescu with the \\"Republic's president\\", and claimed that he had appointed several of his collaborators into high office. In 1877, as the War of Independence against the Ottoman Empire began, Candiano, although he was a deputy in the Romanian Parliament, joined the army to take part in the assault over Grivitsa, being the commander of the 2nd Hunters' Battalion, receiving the Order of St. George from Alexander II, the Emperor of Russia. In 1880, he became Carol's Adjutant, a position he held for 12 years. In 1894, he was named General of Cavalry. He wrote a volume of poetry, Când n-aveam ce face (1866), and several war songs. ==References== *I. L. Caragiale, Boborul *Dimitrie R.

They can be used with diesel or electric motive power, allowing push-pull operation without the use of an additional locomotive. They can also be used with a power car or a railcar. In a few cases control cars were used with steam locomotives, especially in Germanysee German Wiki :de:Doppelstock- Stromlinien-Wendezug der LBE and France (see article Voiture État à 2 étages). In the United States and Canada, cab cars are control cars similar to regular passenger cars, but with a full driver's compartment built into one or both ends. They can be very similar to regular rail cars, to the point of including a gangway between cars so that they could be used in the middle of a passenger train like a regular car if necessary. European railways have used such equipment since the 1920s. In the United States they appeared for the first time in the 1960s. In the United Kingdom, driving trailers may have one or two driving cabs. Trains operating with a locomotive at one end and a control car at the other do not require the locomotive to run around to the opposite end of the train when reversing direction at a terminus. Control cars can carry passengers, baggage, mail or a combination thereof, and may, when used together with diesel locomotives, contain an engine-generator set to provide head-end power (HEP). In addition to the driver's cab, which has all the controls and gauges necessary for remotely operating the locomotive, control cars usually have a horn, whistle, bell, or plough (as appropriate), and all of the lights that would normally be on a locomotive. They must also be fitted with all necessary communication and safety systems like GSM-R or European Train Control System (ETCS). ==Control method== The classic control method was a multiple unit cable with jumpers between cars. In North America and Ireland a standard AAR 27-wire cable is used. In other countries cables with up to 61 wires can be found. A more recent method is to control the train through a Time-Division Multiplexed (TDM) connection, which usually works with two protected wires. == North America == Union Station in Toronto Some commuter rail agencies in the United States routinely use cab cars in place of regular passenger coaches on trains. While older bi-level cab cars often made trains less aerodynamic, new ones being built for GO Transit and Metrolink have specially streamlined cabs. The Chicago and North Western Railway had 42 control cabs built by Pullman-Standard in 1960, which eliminated the need for its trains or locomotives to be turned around. It was an outgrowth of multiple-unit operation that was already common on diesel locomotives of the time. The Canadian transit agency Exo uses control cars on all its trains, except its electric multiple units, which run as double-ended semi-permanently coupled three-car rakes. Amtrak also has a number of ex-Budd Metroliner cab cars, which are used primarily for push pull services on the Keystone Service and New Haven–Springfield Shuttle. The Long Island Rail Road uses cab cars on its C3 double deck coaches. During the mid-1990s, as push-pull operations became more common in the United States, cab-cars came under criticismCriticism of 'push' trains is on the wrong track, LA Times for providing less protection to engine crews during level crossing accidents. This has been addressed by providing additional reinforcing in cab cars. This criticism became stronger after the 2005 Glendale train crash, in which a Metrolink train collided with a Jeep Grand Cherokee at a level crossing in California. The train was traveling with its cab car in the front, and the train jackknifed. Eleven people were killed in the accident, and about 180 were injured. In early 2015, another collision occurred in Oxnard, California, involving one of Metrolink's improved \\"Rotem\\" cab cars at the front of the train hitting a truck at a crossing. The truck driver left his vehicle before the impact, but the collision resulted in multiple car derailments and further cars jackknifing causing widespread injury. === Converted locomotives === San Joaquin at Martinez in November 2013 From the 1970s until 1999, the Long Island Rail Road used a number of older locomotives converted to \\"power packs\\". The original prime movers were replaced with engines/generators solely for supplying HEP with the engineer's control stand left intact. Locomotives converted included Alco FA-1s and FA-2s, EMD F7s, and one F9. One FA was further converted into a power car for the C1 bi-level cars in 1991. The railroad has since switched to classic cab cars with a DE30AC/DM30AC locomotive on some trains. Longer trains require two engines, one on each end.http://www.trainsarefun.com/lirr/lirrFA/lirrFA.htm Until the 1980s, Ontario's GO Transit had a similar program for EMD FP7s. They were frequently used with GP40-2Ws and GP40M-2s, which lacked HEP to power trains. They also found use with HEP-equipped GP40TCs and F40PHs, and were sometimes leased to other railroads. They were eventually retired in 1995 upon the arrival of the EMD F59PHs and subsequently scrapped, except for one F7A and one F7B, which were sold to Tri-Rail and the Ontario Northland Railway, respectively.https://transit.toronto.on.ca/regional/2506.shtml MARC had a former F7 unit, #7100, also converted into an APCU, or All-Purpose Control Unit, which occasionally substituted for a cab car. It was rebuilt with a HEP generator, newer cab controls, and fitted with a Nathan Airchime K5LA. It was used up until the late 2000s, and was donated to the B&O; Railroad Museum in 2010. Amtrak Amtrak developed their Non-powered Control Unit (NPCU) by removing the prime mover, main alternator, and traction motors from surplus EMD F40PH locomotives. The control stand was left in place, as were equipment allowing horn, bell, and headlight operation. A floor and roll-up side-doors were then installed to allow for baggage service, leading to the nickname \\"cab-baggage cars\\" or \\"cabbages\\". Six NPCUs rebuilt for Cascades service in the Pacific Northwest do not have the roll-up side doors, because the Talgo sets on which they operate have a baggage car as part of the trainset, though #90230 was recently fitted with these doors. Four NPCUs are used on the Downeaster. These units have Downeaster logos applied to the front and the sides of the units. Three NPCUs are designated for use on Amtrak California services. They are painted in a paint scheme similar to the old with blue-and- teal striped livery used by Caltrain between 1985 and 1997. In 2011, Amtrak F40PH 406 was converted to an NPCU to enable push-pull operation of Amtrak's 40th-anniversary exhibit train; in addition a HEP generator was installed to supply auxiliary electricity. Unlike other NPCUs, the 406 retains its original number (instead of being renumbered to 90406) and resembles an operational F40PH externally. In October 2015, NPCU #90208 was painted into a special Veterans livery similar to P42DC #42 and ACS-64 #642. Later, in August 2016, NPCU #90221 was repainted into the same scheme. Cascades NPCU #90250 was rebuilt with roll up side doors with Amtrak Phase 5 paint and given a Seattle Seahawks wrap, which has since been removed. In 2017, NCDOT started a Cab Control Unit (CCU) program using ex-GO F59PHs.https://www.thedieselshop.us/NCDOT.HTML File:Northstar Line cab car MNRX 604.jpgNorthstar Line cab car (BiLevel Coach) in Elk River, Minnesota File:SDRX105.jpgSounder BiLevel cab car File:Brampton ON GOT-358 Cab-Car 2017-03-22.jpgA newer GO Transit BiLevel cab car with full upper cab, in Brampton, Ontario File:Pacific Surfliner crossing trestle at Arroyo Hondo, May 2018.jpgPacific Surfliner cab car in 2018 File:Metra Train at Naperville.jpgMetra gallery cab car in Naperville File:NJ Transit Comet V 6044.jpgNJ Transit Comet V at Dunellen File:Former Metroliner cab coach at Lancaster.jpgAmtrak 9645 at Lancaster station in August 2017 File:MetroRail 600.jpgLIRR 600 is an FA-2 converted into a \\"power pack\\" Four Commuter Train Shots by Roger Puta (34781833095).jpgGo Transit F7A 901, used as a power car == Europe == In Britain, this type of car is called a driving trailer.

Trains are powered by class 21 class 27 or class 18 electric locomotives and are operated in one direction from a driving carriage. === Czech Republic=== In the Czech Republic, driving trailers were hardly used in the past. The main reason was concerns about the greater tendency of trainsets that do not have a traction unit at the head of the train to derail. Earlier legislation considered such a train to be sunk and for this reason the speed of such a train was limited to 30 km/h. The first attempt to operate driving trailers at ČSD was the production of two three-car units, each consisting of a SM 487.0 driving power, an inserted N 487.0 trailer, and a Ø 487.0 driving trailer. Both prototypes were produced in 1966 by Tatra Studénka Wagon and MEZ Vsetín. However, the units did not have sufficient capacity and were used to convert to five-car units with motor vehicles series SM 488.0 (now series 560) on the fronts.

The control car is manufactured by Bombardier. They are to be upgraded for ERTMS, starting 2019.See section 4.2.5, Statusrapport til forligskredsen media november 2018 === Germany === The first German attempts to use control cars (German: Steuerwagen) and remote control-equipped steam locomotives were before World War II by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRB). The driver's control instructions were transmitted from the control car to the locomotive by a Chadburn-type machine telegraph (similar to engine order telegraphs on ships). The order had to be immediately acknowledged and implemented by the automatic firebox controllers. This indirect control was judged as impractical and unsafe, because, although the driver controlled the brake directly, the danger existed that in an emergency the locomotive would continue supplying \\"push\\" power for some time and possibly derail the train. Attempts to use electric locomotives (beginning with a converted E 04 class model) were more promising, as the engine driver could control the locomotive directly. World War II interrupted the test program, despite good successes. Only after the war would control car operation be slowly accepted, when locomotives and suitably equipped cars became available. The length of train consists in push-pull operations was originally limited to 10 cars for reasons of guidance dynamics. A speed limit of 120 km/h was also imposed, rising to 140 km/h in 1980. This was not an operational hindrance, as push-pull trains were generally initially used in six-car commuter trains. Only since the mid-1990s have long-distance trains, which can have up to 14 cars and travel at speeds of 200 km/h, been operated with control cars. A special circumstance is the ICE 2, which may operate with the control car in the lead at up to 250 km/h on the recently built high-speed lines.

The first type of control cars used by MÁV, that is still used on low traffic branch lines was the BDt (then called BDat) series, with the BDt 100 series being capable of travelling with diesel (and formerly with steam) engines (most notably the M41 series), and the BDt 300 series being capable of travelling with electric V43 series engines. These carriages were built by the MÁV Dunakeszi Main Workshop between 1962 and 1972.http://iho.hu/blogpost/ingavonatok-a-mav-halozatan-i-resz-130215 Most of the BDt 100 series, with lack of function after the Bzmot series overtook the shrinking number of unelectrified branch lines, were converted to BDt 400 series by the Dunakeszi Main Workshop, now led by Bombardier, in 2005 (after a prototype series of 7 built in 1999). They are only compatible with the V43 2xxx series, as only they have digital remote control. With the purchase of the former East German carriage series from the DB, called \\"Halberstadters\\", 27 control cars serialed Bybdtee arrived in Hungary. Although a V43 3xxx series was introduced that has special remote control compatible to these control cars, because of the Halberstadters' rare use as branch line carriages, they are rarely used as effective control cars, and are more frequently seen as a regular carriage because of their bicycle storage space. There are more carriages that are technically separate control cars, like the Bdx series that were part of the (now deleted from rolling stock) MDmot DMU series, or the Bmxt series that is part of the BDVmot and BVhmot EMU series, but they are considered and treated as a part of their DMU and EMU unit respectively.

On this set, train heating was supplied from the locomotive Head End Power System, but this led to reliability issues on the 201 Class locomotives, so Mark 3 Generator vans have replaced one of the De Dietrich standard class coaches in the formation since September 2012. ** Numbered 9001–9004 * CAF (Mark 4) with driving cab containing replica locomotive control stand, luggage compartment and twin engine / generator sets for train heating. No passenger seating is provided. ** Numbered 4001–4008 All Mark 4 Control Cars have full- sized driving cabs with EMD locomotive type power and brake controls. Locomotive control is by means of an AAR system, modified by Iarnród Éireann (IÉ) to include control of train doors and operate with 201 Class locomotives. Iarnród Éireann formerly operated Mark 3 Control Cars from 1989 until 2009: * Mark 3s with driving cab containing replica locomotive control stand, luggage compartment, underslung Cummins engine / generator set for train heating and passenger seating. ** Numbered 6101–6105, converted from Mark 3 InterCity cars for suburban push-pull services. These were withdrawn in September 2009 following the introduction of 22000 Class InterCity Railcars. These units have since been scrapped apart from 6105 which has been preserved by the West Clare Railway. === Italy === In Italy, the first push-pull trains began to run after World War II. At the time there were no systems to actually remote command the rear locomotive, so an engineer had to take place in it and command traction, following instructions (via an apposite intercom) given by the other driver, who remained in the front car, commanding brakes and sighting signals. This lasted until the adoption of the 78-wire cable in the 1970s, which enabled full remote commanding from control cars. Today push-pull trains are very common, and different kinds of control cars are employed: * UIC Z1 control cars. * MDVC type control cars, with aerodynamic or communicating cabin. * Piano ribassato type control cars, with flat, refurbished E464-like or communicating cabin. * Doppio Piano two floors control cars. * UIC-X type control cars. * Vivalto type control car. These types allow full remote control of any Italian locomotive supplied with standard 78-wire cable, except for UIC Z1, which are used on IC services and are only able to command class E.402 locomotives, and MDVC Diesel-specific version, usable only with class D.445 Diesel locomotives. The same driving commands are used for both rheostatic and electronic locomotives, but their meanings change. Vivalto type control cars, at this time, can only remote command Class E.464 and Class E.632 locomotives, because of software issues, though are able to command other locomotive types. Vivalto cars can also use TCN remote control cable. Driving cars can be recognized because of the \\"np\\" in their identification number and usually also have a dedicated compartment for bicycle and luggage transportation. There also are specific EMU/DMU non-motorized units control cars, which (in Trenitalia) are classified as Le / Ln XXX with no significant difference between them and motorized units except the lack of traction motors.

For short-distance trains they use a \\"virtual EMU\\" concept. Train sets are formed of a driving carriage, two or three intermediate carriages and either a class 1700 electric locomotive or an EMU motor vehicle (i.e. NS DD-AR). These train sets are diagrammed as if they were all EMUs resulting in formations with two locomotives, often at intermediate positions in the train. For longer distance workings, including the Benelux services to Brussels the more normal mode of operation is used. ===Poland=== In Poland, the term used is \\"wagon sterowniczy\\", which literally means \\"control carriage\\". Koleje Mazowieckie use driving trailers on their regional services. The first batch of double-decker driving trailers and cars, the Twindexx Bombardier Double-deck Coaches, was delivered in 2008. The second batch, PESA-made Sundecks, was delivered at the end of 2015. ===Slovakia=== ZSSK Class 951 In Slovakia, JNR-based passenger train service operators of the railway business entity Slovakia (ZSSK) was 2011. Skoda Transportation push- pull operation with and made of 381 electric locomotives or 263 AC electric locomotive use two-story manufactured by the same company 951 system train carriages introducing, Bratislava central station and currently operating on suburban trains. === Switzerland === Swiss driving trailers operate in many different configurations. There are several models currently in service on S-Bahn networks as well as regional, InterRegio, and InterCity services. These are operated by the federal railway system (SBB) as well as various private railroads throughout the country (including narrow gauge lines) and into France, Germany, and Italy. Driving trailers are classified after the UIC- lettering system, adding a \\"t,” giving Bt (second class), BDt (second class + baggage), ABt (first + second class), or Dt (baggage). For Intercity trains there are the Bt IC that work together with EW IV and the double-deck version for the IC 2000 trainsets, working with Re 460. The Zürich S-Bahn trainsets with Re 450 work in fix consists of Re 450 - B - AB - Bt but intermediate cars and driving trailers are numbered as coaching stock. \\"NPZ\\" Regional and S-Bahn trains with RBDe 560 usually have a matching Bt driving trailer. Replacement by an older BDt EW I/II is technically possible. Older driving trailers, mostly BDt EW I/II and a few remaining Dt of SBB can be used with Re 420 and RBe 540 and some motive power of private railways. In theory also Re 430 and Re 620 can be controlled but these classes only work freight trains today. The BLS operates four groups of driving trailers: * ABt NPZ to go with RBDe 565 and RBDe 566 II (ex RM) * Bt EW I 950-953, BDt 940-941, car-shuttle BDt 942-945, 946-949 and 939 can work with Re 425, Ae 4/4 and Re 465 * Bt EW III, BDt EW II (both ex SBB), Bt EW I 901-902 (ex Thurbo/MThB) and leased Dt from SBB can work with Re 420.5 ex SBB and BLS Re 465. * Bt EW I 950–953, BDt 940–941, car-shuttle BDt 942–945, 946-949 and 939 can work with Re 425, Ae 4/4 and Re 465 Südostbahn had a fleet of ABt for their BDe 4/4 but they will soon be fully replaced by FLIRTs. NPZ ABt exist for the two types of RBDe 566 SOB owns (566 071-076 ex BT and 566 077-080 ex SOB of the SBB-type). Nine BDt are used for the Voralpen-Express with Re 456, Re 446 or SBB-CFF-FFS Re 420. The narrow gauge Zentralbahn ABt can control HGe 101 (ex SBB), De 110, BDeh 140 (ex LSE) and the new \\"SPATZ\\" ABe 130. The Rhaetian Railway (RhB) has, besides the ABDt that work with Be 4/4 511-516, a group of driving trailers that can be used with their Ge 4/4 I, II and III locomotives. Three of them are specially fitted for Vereina car shuttle trains. The Matterhorn-Gotthard-Bahn (MGB) has numerous driving trailers for almost all types of motive power. They work regional trains and car shuttle trains through the Furka Base Tunnel.

These allowed a train driver to remotely control the regulator and reverser of a suitably equipped locomotive. The fireman remained on the locomotive to operate the boiler and locomotive whistle. Locomotives were commonly sandwiched between a pair of autocoaches, allowing a maximum of four to be used. Driving Brake Standard Open A Driving Brake Standard Open or DBSO is a specially converted Mark 2 passenger car. Initially operated by ScotRail from 1979, they were operated on InterCity and Anglia Railways services on the Great Eastern Main Line from the late-1980s until 2006. Some have been refurbished for use on Network Rail test trains. Others were used by Direct Rail Services on Cumbrian Coast line locomotive hauled passenger trains under contract to Northern Rail until late 2018 when they were replaced by regular Diesel multiple units. File:DBSO 9710 at Norwich.JPGDBSO 9710 in InterCity livery at Norwich File:Rail-dbso-amoswolfe.jpgDBSO in Anglia Railways livery Driving Van Trailer A Driving Van Trailer or DVT is a more modern type of control car, purpose-built to include space for baggage and a guard's office. The DVT was developed in the late-1980s from the DBSO and designed to be used with Mark 3s on West Coast Main Line services and Mark 4s on the East Coast Main Line. As at December 2019, Mark 3 DVTs are in service with Chiltern Railways, Greater Anglia, Network Rail and Transport for Wales, with Mark 4 DVTs in service with London North Eastern Railway with some to be operated by Transport for Wales from 2020. Former operators of the Mark 3 DVTs are Arriva Trains Wales, Virgin Trains West Coast and Wrexham & Shropshire.

Examples of these driving trailers were on some old (now most likely scrapped) red rattler cars along with C and K sets (4 trailers). The driving trailers from the K set were later converted to ordinary trailers. These can be noted by the positioning of the pantograph. On a single set the pantographs are placed on the second and third cars, and on an eight car train (2 sets combined) they're placed on the second, third, sixth and seventh cars. Some third Generation of Sydney Trains, Tangaras or T sets, have driving trailers but are equipped to supply electricity to the train though the use of a pantograph. Waratahs (A sets) have two driving trailers (one at each end) with power trailers in between the driving and non-driving trailers. ===South Australia=== 2100 class railcar are driving trailers, being placed in a 2-car consist with a 2000 class power unit, sometimes with a second trailer to make a 3-car consist-the power car would be placed in between the two trailers. As of 2018, only three of these trailers exist, the rest were scrapped. Two are preserved and one that was donated to South Australian Metropolitan Fire Service (cut-in half). Three 2000 class power units out of the twelve have had the same fate. ===New Zealand=== 1906 72-seat 60ft 'motor train' built by New Zealand Railways with a NZR D class (1874) locomotive Experiments with light railcars were aimed at cutting costs on lightly-used branch lines. Autotrains were built in 1906 and 1907 and by 1925 NZR had 8 88-seat and 5 72-seat motor trains. In 1908 there was a motor train Auckland suburban service to Otahuhu and between Morrinsville and Putaruru in 1913. In Auckland, Transdev Auckland operated 21 DC class locomotives and four DFT class locomotives (owned by KiwiRail) in push-pull mode with 24 sets of 3-5 SA cars and an SD driving car with driving cab and remote controls (ex British Rail Mark 2 carriages rebuilt for suburban service), owned by Auckland Transport.\\"Ticket to Ride\\" e.nz magazine, July/August 2007 Volume 8/4, pages 24-28 The carriages were replaced with EMUs in July 2015. ==AsiaSri Lanka=== A control car of a DMU in Sri Lanka Control cars are available on most Diesel multiple units operated by Sri Lanka Railways. ===Israel=== Control cars are available on most Diesel multiple units operated by Israel Railways. == See also == * Cab (locomotive) == References == Category:Passenger coaches ","title":"Control car"},{"id":"6200082","text":"Kick was a citrus soda product by Royal Crown Company, Inc. introduced to the market in 1995.

It is also spoken in parts of Guinea-Bissau, Sierra Leone, and Senegal. There are a small number of speakers in Mali. Pular is spoken by 2.5 million Guineans, about 28% of the national population. This makes Pular the most widely spoken indigenous language in the country. Substantial numbers of Pular speakers have migrated to other countries in West Africa, notably Senegal. Pular is not to be confused with Pulaar, another Fula language spoken natively in Guinea, Senegal, Mauritania, and western Mali (including the Futa Tooro region). Pular is written in the Ajami script and the Latin script. ==Linguistic features== There are some particularities to this version of Fula, including: *Use of plural form for politeness (such as in German or French, unlike other varieties of Fula) *A number of separate verbal roots for politeness (these may exist only in Pular) *There is no initial consonant mutation from singular to plural verb forms as is the case in other varieties of Fula (there is in nominal forms, however) *In addition to the more standard long-form pronouns of Fula there are alternate forms in Pular (= hi(l) + pronoun). The table below summarizes these (question marks where the info is not complete): {  - ! Person / number ! Standard long-form pronoun (as in Pulaar) !

Pular Latin orthography is basically the same as that used for Fula languages throughout West Africa.

The name was devised by Sallie Grayson, the writer of STUFFED: Adventures of a Restaurant Family when she was the associate creative director at Doyle Dane & Bernbach and was in charge of new brands on the Hershey account. From 1978 to 1987, Whatchamacallit consisted of a bar of peanut-flavored crisp that utilized peanut butter as the flavoring agent, coated in a thin layer of chocolate. From 1987 to 2008, Whatchamacallit has included peanut-flavored crisp that utilizes peanut butter as the flavoring agent, with a layer of caramel and a layer of chocolate coating. Hershey's Whatchamacallit is found in recipes for various food items, including pies, cookies, cheesecakes, and cupcakes. The advertising for the Whatchamacallit peaked in the 1980s, after this period Hershey Company ran noticeably fewer advertisements for this product. However, despite the lack of attention the company gives it compared to its other products, the Whatchamacallit is still in production as of 2020. In Canada, an identical candy bar is marketed by Hershey's as Special Crisp, but does not have the wide distribution in Canada that the Whatchamacallit has in the United States. == Ingredient changes to reduce production costs == The Thingamajig, a rice crisp and peanut butter candy bar that is similar to the Whatchamacallit In 2008, the Hershey Company began to change the ingredients for some of its products, replacing the relatively expensive cocoa butter with cheaper oil substitutes. Such cost-cutting was done to avoid price increases for the affected products. Hershey's changed the description of the product and altered the packaging slightly along with the ingredients. Though the new formula still contains chocolate, according to United States Food and Drug Administration food labeling laws, products that do not contain cocoa butter cannot legally be described as milk chocolate. Instead, such products are often referred to as chocolate candy. == Thingamajig == right In 2009, Hershey's introduced Thingamajig, featuring chocolate, cocoa crisps, and peanut butter inside. It was reintroduced in late 2011 on a supposedly permanent basis. However, as of 2012, according to Hershey's Chocolate World in Pennsylvania, the Thingamajig candy bar is no longer being produced. == References == Category:Products introduced in 1978 Category:Chocolate bars Category:The Hershey Company brands Category:Kosher food ","title":"Whatchamacallit (candy)"},{"id":"6200113","text":"The Johnny Cash Sun Records discography details the music recorded by country music legend Johnny Cash and released on Sun Records.

It has a relatively short history of creative, artistic and professional dance. The range of dance reflects the cultural diversity of Singapore.Dance in Singapore at DanSing There is a consistent struggle between the rejection and acceptance of western dance influences and the re-emphasis of ethnic cultures from time to time. The Singapore identity through dance is a challenging one often on an outward looking perception rather than the acceptance and recognition of indigenous/original creativity. Notable non-profit artistic dance legacy include ECNAD and Arts Fission Company. ==Traditional styles== Singapore is a multinational country. Though its predominant ethnicity is Chinese, there are also other Asian communities, especially Indians, Malays and Indonesians. * Chinese dances are very popular in Singapore. The Lion Dance is performed in the New Year festivities, among other dances performed in other cultural events. * The Malay national dance, Zapin, is popular among Malays. * Indian Bharatnatyam and, to a lesser extent, Kathak are taught in many Indian dance schools in Singapore, given fact that most Indians of Singapore are mostly Tamil in ethnicity, among other South Indians. * Peranakan dance blends Malay and Chinese influences in both choreography and clothing. Peranakan music has Malay and Western influences. ==Post-War history (in search of identity)== After World War II, Singaporeans fought for self- government and in search for a new identity, a united anti-colonial movement multi-cultural activities were initiated. ==1959–1969 (the pre-professional dance years)== The economy was the main emphasis after self-government in 1959, however, a Ministry of CultureMICA Resonance was formed to encourage the preservation and development of Chinese, Malay and Indian dances. Western Modern Dance had not yet been practised in Singapore then. Western influence was then deemed to be undesirable. ==National Theatre built in 1963== The Singapore government built its first National Theatre in 1963 to showcase local ethnic dance and its development. The 1st Southeast Asia Cultural Festival was held there. ==1970s== The growing Singapore economy in the 1970s see the formation of its full-time People's Association Dance Company. National Dance Festival was organised in 1978. ==Singapore Festival of Dance== Singapore organised its first Singapore Festival of Dance (which became the Festival of Asian Performing Arts and now evolved in the present days Singapore Arts Festival). The Festival of Dance's has an objective of creating new local dance forms through the working together of ethnic dance choreographers but this Singaporean identity did not work out very well. ==Traditional dance (1980s)& setup of National Arts Council== A student from the Bukit View Primary School in Singapore performs a cultural dance with classmates for US President George W. Bush and Mrs. Laura Bush during their visit on 16 November 2006, to the city's Asian Civilisations Museum. In May 1980, the National Theatre Dance Company (NTDC) was formed by National Theatre Trust, upon the successful completion of the dance training programme conducted by prominent Hong Kong instructor, Mr. Cheng Shu Jing. The training programme had culminated in a concert, \\"An Evening of Chinese Dances\\" being performed on 24 Nov 1979. NTDC had evolved to become Theatre Arts Troupe in 1992, after National Theatre Trust amalgamated into the National Arts Council. Since then, Arts Council of Singapore has developed into one of the biggest and most ambitious arts council in the world with adequate staff strength covering all aspects of the arts in Singapore. The only problem is that there seems to be less direct funding available for dance projects over the years and company directors for dance that not adequately supported to power their training, outreach and community efforts. All of which are areas that the council has taken charge themselves. So, private initiative seems to be dying off slowly but surely. ==Ballet (government initiated company)== From the early years of rejection of western influences, the government decided to embrace western performing arts in a big way namely in the setting up of a national ballet company Singapore Dance Theatre and the Singapore Symphony Orchestra. Singapore Dance Theatre, a ballet company founded in 1988, took over NTDC as Singapore's national dance company, acquiring works of well known choreographers and housing mainly young foreign dance talents. It is a repertory company showcasing mainly classical ballet and contemporary ballet works. The late Anthony Then (artistic co-founder with Goh Soo Khim) had strong creative influences in creating his own ballet pieces in the past. His choreography was last presented in 2009 for the company's 20th Anniversary. Many of the works of Goh Choo San, a well-known Singaporean choreographer, have been presented by the company. SDT now has an established place on the arts scene and performance calendar in Singapore. There are 36 dancers in the professional company and the repertoire ranges from full-length classical ballets to newly created contemporary work. ==Structured formal dance training (1990s)== In the 1990s Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) started Singapore's first full-time Modern Dance programme. The programme was headed by Angela Liong and offered all-rounded dance theory and technique program including Martha Graham's technique and dance improvisation. Her programme was delivered with strong contemporary arts references and education on top of the regular dance training plus many workshops through an exchange programme whereby many American dance artists have worked with the students then. The existing pioneers of contemporary dance were students from this programme. Over the years, Dance at NAFA has grown from a fledgling start into an established and reputable department with the help of better funding availability from the government. The Department of Dance has survived and thrived largely because of the capable direction as well as vision of several committed individuals. The initiatives of these individuals, who are respected in Singapore's dance community, have eventually contributed to today's distinctive Diploma in Dance program that combines contemporary Asian and Western performance and creative practices. LaSalle is another institution that offer dance diploma programme as well as the newly set up SOTA. However, there is a lot more room for synergy between Government, Institutions and Arts Companies to build a common vision for the local dance scene. Currently, new generation of trained dancers are moving more into commercial and school projects, less are really to contribute in the artistic arena. Currently, most of the local institution trained dancers do not work with artistic companies. They tend to go into child care, teaching in schools and taking ad-hoc commercial projects. The lack of professional artistic dancers is further worsened by this trend. The Singapore Dance Theatre also provides a training programme for dancers and choreographers just like any of the local dance groups too. ==Creative contemporary dance identity in Singapore== In general, the first generation of theatrical dance professionals have contributed mainly as dance teachers whereas the second generation produces more original choreography and performances in developing the scene. ==References== Singapore Street Dance ==External links== Category:Singaporean culture ","title":"Dance in Singapore"},{"id":"6200222","text":"Police 2020 is a one-off television pilot, first broadcast in 1997, that was set to be the first episode of an ongoing British crime drama series.

After landfill allowed Cambridge to expand over the area now known as Cambridgeport, this entire portion of Cambridge was known as the \\"Old Port\\". Cambridge split the city into 13 statistical zones to analyze the 1950 census, whereby the old Cambridgeport neighborhood was split into two zones, Area 4 and Area 5, divided by Massachusetts Avenue. Later those census zones were rolled over into official planning districts by the Cambridge Community Development department.Cambridge Community Development Home Page The \\"Cambridgeport\\" name went to Area 5, where the waterfront is currently located; the inland Area 4 never received an official designation, as the planning districts were never meant to define neighborhood boundaries. For decades, Area 4 was one of only two planning districts to lack an official name, (the other, neighborhood nine, still lacks one.)

The Museum is open to the public during seasonal summer opening hours, for special events and for pre-booked Group tours. ==History== The Hall was built in 1828 by Thomas Wright (1773-1845) a banker of Nottinghamshire. It was designed by the architect W J Donthome. The hall was purchased in 1895 by John Warwick, a brewer of the firm 'Warwick & Richardson' based in Newark. He used it as a family home. He added a Ballroom, a Billiards Room, and a further six bedrooms. In 1936 the property was bought by Sir Albert Ball, though he never took up residence there. In 1952 the hall was declared a listed building. It is now a grade II* listed building, making it one of the most treasured 5% of all buildings in the UK.

It was ported to the Neo Geo CD, as well as for the PlayStation 2 along with its sequel Kizuna Encounter in Japan only (as part of the Fūun Super Combo). This compilation was re-released in the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 4 in December 2016 ==Plot== Savage Reign is set in the first half of the 21st century in the fictional city of South Town (the same city used in the Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting series), which has now been upgraded and renamed as Jipang City. A mysterious legendary fighter known only as King Leo has risen up from the shadows of secrecy and issued a challenge on television for the strongest of fighters to battle against him in a fighting tournament known as the Battle of the Beast God. He promises immense wealth beyond anyone's dreams and legendary fame beyond imagination. Nine fighters have come to the tournament, each with their own sole purpose and reason for battling against King Leo. ==Gameplay== Gameplay screenshot showcasing a match between Carol Stanzack and Sho Hayate. The game, much like Samurai Shodown, is a weapons fighter. However, Savage Reign has a few particular elements that makes it different from its predecessor: *The weapons can not only be used for close combat, but can also be thrown at an opponent from a distance for more ranged attacks. There are also two levels of playing field within the battles (the default lower one and the upper field, which both fighters can jump to with the push of a button). *The button layout was also slightly different at the time, resembling World Heroes somewhat: a button for punching, a button for kicking, a button for the weapon and a button for jumping between planes (holding down the punch or kick buttons results in a stronger attack, tapping them wields a light attack). *Much like Art of Fighting, the camera will zoom in on your character and the character they are fighting against if they are in close proximity to each other and like Fatal Fury, the characters can fight each other using a two line battle system. ==Characters== * Sho Hayate - The main protagonist of the series. A young Japanese man who aims to prove the strength of Fu'un-Ken: a special style of fighting that combines martial arts with the mastery of the boomerang. Hayate is best known for his calm yet brash attitude and that he always initiates a strong battle cry in combat. * Carol Stanzack - A beautiful young French female gymnast who is being forced to marry King Leo by her father Jeanrick (who is also her teacher). She is annoyed by this, and fights to break this commitment. Carol fights with a mixture of a pink Olympic gymnast ball, her own acrobatic skills, and aikido. * Max Eagle - An undefeated pro wrestler who is interested in the challenge. His ulterior motive for entering the tournament is that he seeks on whether or not King Leo is actually his missing older brother. Eagle fights with a mixture of his axe and a couple of wrestling moves. The wrestling organization (SWF) Eagle works for is the same one used in the SNK arcade game 3 Count Bout. * Gordon Bowman - A successful police officer who carries an electric stun tonfa. His young daughter Canbee is deathly ill and that he heads to the tournament for the prize money so that he can help support her medical attention. * Chung Paifu - An old sennin who decides to enter the tournament due to a past conflict between him and King Leo. His cap was given to him by a man known only as the \\"Legendary Wolf.\\" Chung fights with a wooden cane and can instantly go into Ikari (angry) mode if his cap is knocked off his head from within battle. * Gozu - A red-clad ninja who uses fire-based attacks with his Fire Claws. He is a member of a terrorist organization called the Jaguar (or Jäger), and along with his young brother Mezu, he is out for revenge against King Leo due to the fact that King Leo had killed their brother Kazuo from within a past incident. * Mezu - A blue-clad ninja who uses water and ice-based attacks with his Ice Claws. Much like his older brother Gozu, he is also a member of the Jaguar and is determined to avenge the death of their brother Kazuo, who was killed by King Leo from within a past incident. * Joker - A clown-like fighter who happens to be the leader of a violent street gang known as the Looly Po Po. Joker uses his unusual appearance and his strange weaponry (the primary one being a jack-in-the-box) as his fighting tools. His motivations for entering the tournament is to gain glory for himself and his gang. His real name is Marco Bariadrid. * Nicola Zaza - A young Russian super genius who constructed both a Super Shield and a Super Suit. Nicola participates in the tournament to test the very depths of his own creations. Nicola uses a supercharged flying disc in battle. * King Lion (Kage Shishioh) - An unknown and mysterious man who works for King Leo as a fake impersonator. Much like King Leo, King Lion wields \\"The Sword of Leo\\" and utilizes the same fighting style that King Leo has, though as not so powerful as his master. * King Leo (Shin Shishioh) - The final boss and main antagonist of the series. The mysterious legendary fighter who is responsible for creating and sponsoring the Battle of the Beast God tournament, King Leo is a strong and ruthless warrior who wields \\"The Sword of Leo\\" and that he had made the fake impersonator King Lion as a way to test his opponent out before he would come and battle them from within his own accord. == Reception == In Japan, Game Machine listed Savage Reign on their June 1, 1995 issue as being the seventh most-successful arcade game of the year, outperforming titles such as Baku Baku Animal and Cyberbots. Reviewing the Neo Geo home version, Major Mike of GamePro summarized, \\"Savage Reign is one of those impressive fighting games that's likely to disappear soon after it surfaces. It looks great and the sound is dynamite, but in the end it falls short because it lacks an identity to separate it from the multitude of fighting games already out there.\\" He reviewed the Neo Geo CD version with similar remarks, and noted that compared to the Neo Geo version \\"the three- button simultaneous attacks are more difficult to execute because the buttons are stacked on top of each other.\\" Next Generation reviewed the Neo-Geo version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"The only innovative facet in Savage Reign is the upper level perch that shows up in each location in the form of a loft, rooftop, or just a cable to hang by. If you just can't get enough of these games, here's another.\\" Maximum gave the Neo Geo CD version four out of five stars, commenting that \\"Let there be no doubt, everything from the coin-op has been packed into the CD version making it a very attractive break from the more conventional Fatal Fury/King of Fighters activities, but with all the fighting action you'd expect from an SNK title.\\" == Notes  References  External links == * Savage Reign at GameFAQs * Savage Reign at Giant Bomb * Savage Reign at Killer List of Videogames * Savage Reign at MobyGames Category:1995 video games Category:ACA Neo Geo games Category:Arcade games Category:D4 Enterprise games Category:Fighting games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Neo Geo games Category:Neo Geo CD games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Science fiction video games Category:SNK games Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games ","title":"Savage Reign"},{"id":"6200283","text":"\\"Set on You\\" is a song recorded by English girl group Bananarama.

At the University of Southern California she studied merchandising. She married Michael Snider (who was in the Army), and had a son, Jefferson, with him. They eventually divorced, both having part- time custody of their child. During World War II, with a son and a husband, she \\"decided to give singing a try.\\" == Career == In 1950 she returned to singing in a nightclub in Hollywood, Café Gala. She was heard there by Benny Carter, who thought enough of her talent to recommend her to Mitch Miller, Columbia Records' artist and repertory director. She was picked in 1953 by Percy Faith, Columbia's biggest orchestra leader, to sing vocals on a song he was recording, taken from the film Moulin Rouge—a biographical film about Toulouse-Lautrec. \\"The Song from Moulin Rouge\\" was recorded on January 22, 1953, as the B-side of a recording of \\"Swedish Rhapsody\\". It was Sanders' second record, and it was released by Columbia with the credits shown as \\"Percy Faith and his Orchestra featuring Felicia Sanders.\\" She had been paid only union scale and her name appeared below Faith's in small letters, but she had a success. The song scored #1 on all the record charts and was to be her greatest success. Just before the record was released she was hired by New York's famous Blue Angel Supper Club, and she played there for a long time, being the first singer to perform the song \\"In Other Words (Fly Me to the Moon)\\" — although she did not record it until several other singers had done so. When she recorded \\"In Other Words\\" at Decca Recording studio, it was backed with \\"Summer Love\\" (composed by Victor Young) in 1959. During the 1960s she sang frequently at The Bon Soir cabaret on West 8th Street. In 1955, Sanders released her first Columbia album, Felicia Sanders at the Blue Angel. Miller kept finding other songs to have her sing, but only one other scored among the Top 30: \\"Blue Star\\", based on the theme from a well-known television series, Medic. == Personal life == After her marriage to Snider, Sanders married musician Irving Joseph. In the mid-1960s, they formed Special Edition Records, with the first release featuring Sanders' singing. ==Death== Felicia Sanders died in her Manhattan home on February 7, 1975, from cancer at the age of 53. ==References *1953 Time magazine article on Felicia Sanders *1970 Time magazine article on Felicia Sanders Category:Deaths from cancer Category:Year of birth missing Category:Jewish American musicians Category:Musicians from Mount Vernon, New York Category:People from Greater Los Angeles Category:Traditional pop music singers Category:1920s births Category:1975 deaths Category:Place of death missing Category:20th-century American singers Category:20th-century American women singers ","title":"Felicia Sanders"},{"id":"6200386","text":"Eric Alexander and David Hazeltine at the Artists' Quarter in 2013 The Artists' Quarter (a.k.a. the AQ) was a well-known, musician-owned and operated jazz club in the Twin Cities.

Born in Putnam, Connecticut, he attended the University of Connecticut. He was listed as tall and . ==Early career with Yankees== Signed by the New York Yankees at age 23 after one season as a baseball and basketball player at UConn preceded by a semester at Texas A&M; and four years of service in the United States Air Force, Sheldon experienced a meteoric rise at the outset of his professional career. In his first pro campaign, 1960, pitching in the Class D New York–Pennsylvania League, Sheldon won 15 games and lost one (for a winning percentage of .938) with 15 complete games. The following year, he made the 1961 Yankees' varsity roster out of spring training, survived the May cutdown from 28 to 25 men, and took a turn in the Bombers' starting rotation in July and August. On July 5 and 9, he tossed consecutive complete-game shutouts against the Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox, as the Yankees kept pace with the Detroit Tigers in a heated, two-team pennant race—ultimately won convincingly by the Yankees in September. Sheldon would pitch in 35 games, including 21 starts, and win 11 of 16 decisions in a season dominated by the pursuit by Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle of Babe Ruth's single-season home run record. Sheldon, however, did not appear in the 1961 World Series, won by the Yankees in five games over the Cincinnati Reds. The 1962 season never saw Sheldon get untracked. He began the year pitching out of the Yankee bullpen, made 34 total appearances (with 16 starts) and posted a 7–8 record and a poor 5.49 earned run average. The Yankees again won the American League pennant, but again Sheldon was not used in the World Series, a seven-game triumph over the San Francisco Giants. He then spent all of and the first two months of 1964 back in the minors with Triple-A Richmond. ==Later MLB career== Recalled by the Yankees in June 1964, Sheldon contributed to their successful pennant defense during a summer-long struggle against the Chicago White Sox and Baltimore Orioles. He appeared in 19 games, with 12 starts, threw three complete game victories and added a save coming out of the bullpen. He then appeared in Games 1 and 7 of the 1964 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, hurling 2⅔ innings pitched of hitless, scoreless relief. The Yankees, however, lost both games and the series to the Redbirds. He began with three appearances as a relief pitcher out of the Yankee bullpen, but on May 3 he was traded to the cellar-dwelling Kansas City Athletics with Johnny Blanchard for Doc Edwards, a journeyman catcher. Sheldon managed a winning record, 10–8, with a 3.95 earned run average for a Kansas City team that lost 103 games. Then, in 1966, he posted a solid 3.13 ERA in 14 games for the Athletics, even though he lost seven of 11 decisions, through mid-June. Two days before the June 15 trade deadline, he was acquired by the Red Sox, another second-division club, in a six-player trade and plugged into Boston's starting rotation, where he was ineffective. He ended up only 1–6 (4.97) in 23 games for the Red Sox, was traded during the offseason to Cincinnati, and never returned to the majors. He pitched four full seasons of Triple-A ball before retiring after the 1970 campaign. For his career, Sheldon appeared in 160 Major League games and notched 371 strikeouts in 724⅔ innings pitched. He allowed 741 hits and 207 bases on balls. He had 17 complete games, four shutouts and two saves. During his off-seasons, Sheldon completed his coursework for a degree in physical education in 1965 from the University of Connecticut. ==References * Baseball Reference Category:1936 births Category:Living people Category:Auburn Yankees players Category:Baseball players from Connecticut Category:Boston Red Sox players Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:UConn Huskies baseball players Category:UConn Huskies men's basketball players Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Kansas City Athletics players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:New York Yankees players Category:People from Putnam, Connecticut Category:Richmond Virginians (minor league) players Category:Salt Lake City Bees players Category:Seattle Angels players Category:Toledo Mud Hens players Category:Tucson Toros players Category:Vancouver Mounties players Category:American men's basketball players ","title":"Rollie Sheldon"},{"id":"6200442","text":"The Queen Elizabeth Scholarship Trust (affectionately known as QEST) is an art and craft educational trust created to sustain traditional British craftsmanship. It is a British institution committed to helping support craftspeople of all ages and from all backgrounds, at a critical stage in their careers. The trust was established in 1990 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Royal Warrant Holders Association and the 90th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. In 2016, QEST welcomed Her Majesty The Queen Elizabeth II as Patron in her 90th birthday year. QEST offers two forms of grant giving: scholarships and apprenticeships. QEST scholarships are for individuals more established in the field, looking to complete additional training and excel in their craft. Grants given by the trust aim to help those who already have a significant degree of skill in their chosen craft to develop those skills to a very high level. Grants range from £2,000 to £15,000, and are often given to cover tuition fees and living costs during an individual's training. QEST apprenticeships are for individuals wishing to begin their career in a practical art, to enter into on-the-job-learning with a master craftsperson. These collaborative grants are awarded to both parties, to fund the tuition and employment of an apprentice during the duration of their three-year apprenticeship. Grants range from £6,000 to £18,000 and are often given to fund material costs and supplement the individual's wage. The 130 crafts that QEST fund the study of include horology, fine metal work, book binding, woodwork, stone masonry, leather working, silversmithing, cordwaining, textile design & making, sculpting, basket weaving and tapestry. ==External links== * www.qest.org.uk Category:Educational charities based in the United Kingdom Category:Social welfare charities based in the United Kingdom ","title":"Queen Elizabeth Scholarship Trust"},{"id":"6200447","text":"Acid-citrate-dextrose or acid-citrate-dextrose solution, also known as anticoagulant-citrate-dextrose or anticoagulant-citrate-dextrose solution (and often styled without the hyphens between the coordinate terms, thus acid citrate dextrose or ACD) is any solution of citric acid, sodium citrate, and dextrose in water.

Benson founded the Brooklyn Gas Light company in 1823, when Brooklyn had 9,000 people. He began buying farmland that was formerly owned by the Polhemuses family in 1835. Between 1830 and 1850 Benson divided the farmland into lots that were sold in the newly created suburb of Bensonhurst.BROOKLYN'S LARGE ESTATES: What Has Become of the Old Farm Lands of the City of Brooklyn?, accessed July 31, 2006.

In 1879 Benson paid US$151,000 for of government land around Montauk in an auction (with Benson paying 10% down). In the middle of the land was Indian Field which was the home for the Montaukett tribe. The land had been held in trust for the tribe. Benson moved to get clear title to the land with promises of buying it from tribesmen for $10 each; in one case one of the tribesmen houses was burned. The legitimacy of the transaction is still being contested in court by the tribe.

Current means of redundancy include replication and parity checks. Such redundancy can be implemented via a RAID array (whereby multiple physical disks appear to a local computer as a single disk, which may include data replication, and/or disk partitioning). Similarly, a grid file system would consist of some level of redundancy (either at the logical file level, or at the block level, possibly including some sort of parity check) across the various disks present in the \\"grid\\". ==Framework== First and foremost, a file table mechanism is necessary. Additionally, the file table must include a mechanism for locating the (target/destination) file within the grid. Secondly, a mechanism for working with file data must exist. This mechanism is responsible for making file data available to requests. ==Implementation== With BitTorrent technology, a parallel can be drawn to a grid file system, in that a torrent tracker (and search engine) would be the \\"file table\\", and the torrent applications (transmitting the files) would be the \\"file data\\" component. An RSS feed like mechanism could be utilized by file table nodes to indicate when new files are added to the table, to instigate replication and other similar components. A file system may incorporate similar technology (distributed replication, distributed data request/fulfillment). If both such systems (file table, and file data) were capable of being addressed as a single entity (i.e. using virtual nodes in a cluster), then growth into such a system could be easily controlled simply by deciding which uses the grid member would be responsible (file table and file lookups, and/or file data). ==Availability== Assuming there exists some method of managing data replication (assigning quotas, etc.) autonomously within the grid, data could be configured for high availability, regardless of loss or outage. ==Challenges== The largest problem currently revolves around distributing data updates. Torrents support minimal hierarchy (currently implemented either as metadata in the torrent tracker, or strictly as UI and basic categorization). Updating multiple nodes concurrently (assuming atomic transactions are required) presents latency during updates and additions, usually to the point of not being feasible. Additionally, a grid (network based) file system breaks traditional TCP/IP paradigms in that a file system (generally low level, ring 0 type of operations) require complicated TCP/IP implementations, introducing layers of abstraction and complication to the process of creating such a grid file system. ==Examples== Examples of high-available data include: * Network load balancing / CARP – splitting incoming requests to multiple computers, usually configured identically or as one whole. * Shared storage clustering / SANs – a single disk (one or more physical disks acting as a single logical disk) is presented to multiple computers which split incoming requests. This is usually used when more computing power is required than disk access. * Data replication / mirroring – multiple computers may attempt to synchronize data (usually point- in-time or snapshot based). Used more often for either Reporting (based on last snapshot) or backup purposes. * Data partitioning – splitting data among multiple computers. In databases, data is often partitioned based on tables (certain tables exist on certain computers, or a table is split among multiple computers at certain \\"break points\\")... general files tend to be partitioned either by category (category based folders), or location (geographically separated). ==See also== * Distributed computing * List of distributed computing projects * Grid computing ==References== Category:Computer file systems ","title":"Grid file system"},{"id":"6200559","text":"New Style Radio 98.7 FM is a community radio station based in Birmingham, England, and broadcasting to the city's African-Caribbean community.

For Romania he won 32 caps, scoring 11 goals. Petschovschi made his debut in Divizia A at the age of 16, as player of Chinezul Timișoara. Petschovschi played in the Hungarian Football Championship between 1941 and 1944 under the name of József Perényi, winning the Hungarian title with Nagyváradi AC, and played three times for the Hungarian national team. His fame was such that in 1946 a Hungarian footballer tried, and even did so for a short while, to steal Petschovschi's identity, when he recommenced himself as the real Petschovschi in order to sign a contract with RC Strasbourg of France. Petschovski was suspended in October 1947 for a period of three months because before an international game between Romania and Poland he bet on the Polish team. In 1952 he became the first footballer to receive the title of Master of Sport. He was also the first Romanian footballer to be called to play for a World Team alongside the biggest names of football. In 1952 he moved to Steaua București for three years, before returning to Arad to play for UT Arad until 1961 when he retired from professional football.

Fighters' NEXTream (Generation of Arts, Speed and Power) is a fighting video game for the Nintendo 64 released in 1998. The story follows a series of fighters that have each received a mysterious letter to compete in a legendary contest, and about a champion that has disappeared. The American and Canadian versions are known as Deadly Arts. The story and the player profiles don't appear in the instructions for the North American version. Except for the name change it is basically the same as the Japan and Europe versions, with slightly changed voice messages, and different character nameplates. Despite its US title none of the characters actually die, but use of choke holds and other animated violence earned it a Teen 13+ rating. ==Gameplay== The player can choose from one of the eight fighters in a match or \\"Duel\\" after beating the other seven characters and an identical version of themselves. There are two other opponents: Gouriki, a character wearing a cat mask and rope-like fairy wings, and Ohgami Reiji, the final boss that wears a large straw hat covering his eyes, and business suit. Reiji while fighting can change into one of two other characters: Hikari, an all-white humanoid with a third eye in his forehead, and Yami, a grey-skinned man with purple beard and long sideburns. The difficulty of the opponents can be changed from very easy up to expert, while the rounds and how long they last can also be manipulated. There is a Versus mode, for teaming up or one on one, as well as a create your own fighter option. Unlike most 3D fighting games such as Virtua Fighter and Tekken, players also receive points for how well they do, and the combination of moves they use. While creating their own characters, players can choose which type of body, height and such, then practice with the new characters in the training area to gain more moves. The player's game progress, scores, and created player can be saved onto Memory Paks, allowing the player to continue to try to improve their stills or challenge friends when playing on their Nintendo 64 console. There are 12 arenas in all, nine of which are available at the beginning of play and three unlockable ones. The two main boss characters also become playable after unlocking them, with Reiji the two creatures can also be transformed into and used while playing. ==Development== The game was first unveiled at the September 1997 Tokyo Game Show. ==Reception== The game received unfavorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Matt Casamassina of IGN noted the \\"stale, sub-first-generation graphics, terrible control and detestable framerates.\\" Jeff Gerstmann, writing for GameSpot, was similarly critical, concluding that the game was too basic and uninteresting. Next Generation said that the game was \\"not only a crappy fighting game but a sad excuse for a game in general. Bad graphics, bad control, and utterly generic designs all add up to an experience you'll want to miss at all costs.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of 19 out of 40. ==References * Category:1998 video games Category:3D fighting games Category:Fighting games Category:Konami games Category:Multiplayer video games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Nintendo 64-only games Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"G.A.S.P!!

In 1906 the Havoline Oil Company separated from the Havemeyer Oil Company. In May 1909, It was bought by the Indian Refining Company, and registered as an official product of the company but kept the logo. By 1910, the Indian Refining Company already had the Havoline oil manufactured. To boost sales & advertise the product they offered to fuel the first plane to fly coast to Coast. Over 300 auto makers wanted it. In 1915 due to over production they had to halt operations. In 1931 it once again changed hands when the Texas Oil company (now Texaco) bought the Indian Refining Company. In 1946 a breakthrough in technology improved Havoline. In 1962 they changed the logo, replacing the old Indian logo. That same year new products were introduced, Havoline 10W-30, and Havoline Singlegrade. In 1968 Improved Havoline & All Temperature Havoline were introduced, followed by Havoline Super-Premium All Temperature Motor Oil in 1971. In 1979 Texaco ends the decade with a new product called Havoline Supreme 10W-40, which superseded Havoline Super-Premium. In 1984 a major breakthrough came with the SAW 20W-50 to keep up with growing demand. In 1991 they launched the Formula 3, which became popular all over the world. In 2001 a new logo and package design came out for the whole line of products. In 2001, Texaco merged with Chevron but the Havoline brand name has been retained for all Texaco motor oils and other lubricating products along with anti- freezes. The Havoline brand now carries the Chevron logo. ==Sponsorships== In 1972, Havoline sponsored Emerson Fittipaldi, who became a world champion in Formula One. In 1978, they sponsored Janet Guthrie, a CART and NASCAR driver. From 1987 to 2002, Havoline sponsored the Robert Yates Racing #28 car in the NASCAR Cup Series. Also, Havoline sponsored Newman/Haas Racing from 1989 to 2002, which featured notable drivers such as Mario Andretti, Michael Andretti, Nigel Mansell, Christian Fittipaldi, and Cristiano da Matta. Havoline's recent sponsorship was with Juan Pablo Montoya in the #42 Dodge for Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates. At the end of the 2008 NASCAR season, Texaco / Havoline officially ended their sponsorship with NASCAR and Chip Ganassi Racing. This brings to a close a 20+-year relationship with the sport. After ending its sponsorship with NASCAR, Havoline became a sponsor of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Havoline returned as a NASCAR sponsor with a 3 race deal with ThorSport Racing, for Ben Rhodes, driver of the 99 truck. ==Varieties== *Havoline Motor Oils *Havoline High-Mileage Protection Motor Oils *Havoline Synthetic Motor Oils *Havoline Synthetic Blend Motor Oil *Texaco Ursa Super Plus Motor Oils *Texaco Ursa Extra Duty Motor Oils *Havoline Two-Cycle Engine Oil ==References *Havoline Official Site *Texaco Official Site * Notes on the history of Indian Refining Company Category:Texaco Category:Motor oils Category:Products introduced in 1904 ","title":"Havoline"},{"id":"6200727","text":"William Charles Stafford (August 13, 1938 – September 19, 2001) was a professional baseball player who pitched in the Major Leagues from 1960 to 1967.

The car was built for JCB, a British multinational equipment company. As of 2018, the car holds the world diesel-powered land speed record, having been driven to over by Wing Commander Andy Green in 2006. ==Design== The car is powered by two specially- tuned versions of the production JCB444 powerplant, developing up to each (over five times the power output of the production version with 90 psi (6 bar) of boost) and featuring four cylinders and 5 litres of displacement, accompanied by two stage turbochargers, intercooler and aftercooler. One of the dual engines drives the front wheels while the other drives the rear. Each engine is rev-limited to 3800 rpm. As the size of the car prohibited meaningful wind tunnel testing, the streamlined shape of the car was refined entirely through the use of computational fluid dynamics by MIRA Ltd, which has enabled the car to obtain a very low coefficient of drag of only 0.147 and a CdA value (drag coefficient × frontal area) of only 0.129 m². The fuel tank, which holds only 9 litres (2.38 U.S. gallons), is located directly behind the carbon fiber cockpit. The fully laden weight of the vehicle, including fuel, oil, ice, water coolant and the driver, is slightly less than 2,700 kg. The chassis was designed and built by Coventry-based engineering company Visioneering for JCB, with engine development undertaken by Sussex-based Ricardo UK Ltd. The electrical system for the vehicle was supplied by R&D; Vehicle Systems Ltd under contract to Visioneering. Ron Ayers led work on the aerodynamics, having previously worked on the ThrustSSC land speed record car. During the 2006 Bonneville Speed Week and subsequent FIA record runs, the car was driven by Andy Green, a serving RAF Officer who previously broke, and still holds, the absolute land speed record with ThrustSSC. ==Performance== The car began shakedown testing on 20 July 2006 on the runway at RAF Wittering with the lower-power version of the JCB444 engine, the team slowly ramping up the speed to prove the chassis and engines. They eventually achieved a speed of over on 30 July 2006. Two days later, the car was disassembled ready to be flown to Wendover Airport, Utah, former home of the B-29 Enola Gay on 8 August. On 13 August 2006, after several days spent re-assembling and re- testing the car, the Dieselmax made its first official run on the Bonneville Salt Flats as part of Speed Week, eventually attaining an average speed of to take the SCTA-BNI event record for an 'AA/DS' Diesel Streamliner. On 22 August 2006, after being re-fitted with 'LSR' versions of the JCB444 engines, the JCB Dieselmax car broke the official FIA diesel engine land speed record, attaining a speed of 328.767 mph (529 km/h). 24 hours later the JCB Dieselmax car broke its own record, achieving a speed of 350.092 mph (563.418 km/h) over a distance of 1 mile on 23 August 2006. Before attaining these speeds, the Dieselmax was pushed from behind, by a JCB Fastrac, until it hit where it engaged first gear. Before the JCB Dieselmax records, the diesel land speed record was 235.756 mph (380 km/h), set by American Virgil Snyder, in the Thermo King streamliner on 25 August 1973. ==Future== In a live interview from Utah on BBC News, Green said that the car was not running at its full potential, due to problems finding suitable tires and that this speed was achieved while the car was still in fifth gear (the car has six). He also reported that the vehicle traveled 11 miles (18 km) on about a U.S. gallon (3.8 L) of fuel. The fuel tank holds just 9 L while the ice tank, used for cooling, holds 180 L. In 2016 a ten-year anniversary celebration was held, where Lord Bamford expressed regret that the record had not been beaten and indicated that a fresh attempt could be made if the JCB record was broken. Although JCB have not made any official statements on the subject of a return to Bonneville, JCB Group Engineering Director Tim Leverton has hinted that they are currently studying the development of tires that would allow them to overcome the nominal 'safety limit' they had placed upon their current Goodyear units. ==See also== *Andy Green *RAF High Speed Flight *ThrustSSC *List of vehicle speed records ==References External links == *JCB Dieselmax Official Website *BBC News, Dieselmax breaks diesel speed record *The engineering behind Dieselmax, Ingenia Magazine, September 2007 *RDVS - Dieselmax electrical system supplier Category:Wheel-driven land speed record cars Category:JCB (company) Category:Streamliner cars ","title":"JCB Dieselmax"},{"id":"6200765","text":"Five Seasons of Angel is a 2004 academic publication relating to the fictional Buffyverse established by TV series, Buffy and Angel. ==Book description== Characters and themes in Angel are examined in a collection of essays by a variety of writers, including a horror author, a sex expert, a television critic, a science fiction novelist, and Buffy writer Nancy Holder. ==Contents== {  - !

Curtis also ran for vice- president in Michigan with Lars Daly under the Tax Cut banner. ==Early career== Merritt Barton Curtis was born in 1892 at San Bernardino, California, son of Israel Hamilton Curtis and Eliza Allen Mee. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1916. Curtis subsequently entered the Marine Corps on August 10, 1917, and was commissioned second lieutenant on that date. He also married Francis Claire Bracewell on April 23, 1917, at Riverside, California. Curtis was assigned to the Marine Barracks Quantico, Virginia, and served there during the whole duration of World War I.

The book looks at how the show approaches gender. Jowett takes a feminist cultural studies approach, exploring the ways in which the series represents femininity, masculinity, and gendered relations, (this includes sexuality and sexual orientation). Jowett argues that Buffy presents a mixture of \\"subversive\\" and \\"conservative\\" portrayal of gender roles. ==Contents== {  - !

Ford Jr. Boyhood Home is a house located at 649 Union Avenue SE in Grand Rapids, Michigan that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Future President Gerald R. Ford lived in the house from 1921 through 1930, when he was between the age of 8 and 17. Of all his boyhood homes, Ford remembered this one most vividly in his autobiography. ==History== The house at 649 Union SE was build in about 1910. In 1921, Gerald Rudolff Ford suffered financial setback, causing the bank to foreclose on the Fords' home. The family began renting the house on Union Street, and continued renting in until 1925, when they purchased it. While living on Union Street, the younger Gerald Ford attended public schools, first at the Madison School, then attending South High School, where he participated in organized sports, including, most notably, football. Ford was an All-State center, and during his 1930 senior year, after the family had moved from the Union Street house to East Grand Rapids, was captain of the football team. While living in the house, Ford and his friends used the garage as a social club. Ford recalled, \\"we learned to play penny-ante poker... it was a great hideaway because my parents wouldn't climb the ladder to the second floor - or so I thought.\\" In 2013 the house underwent an exterior paint restoration, using seven colors and taking more than 500 man-hours. The work was completed by Third Coast Color Painting Co. of Grand Rapids. ==Description== The Union Street house is a 2-1/2-story, Colonial Revival structure clad with weatherboarded. It is basically rectangular in plan, with a single-story porch running across the front and a single-story extension in the rear. The roof has side gables, with a single wide dormer on the front of the house. The windows are primarily double-hung, one over one units, save for the attic story, which contains tripartite windows with a fixed center sash and casement sash on either side. ==References== Boyhood home Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Grand Rapids, Michigan Category:Presidential homes in the United States Category:Tourist attractions in Grand Rapids, Michigan Category:Houses in Kent County, Michigan Category:National Register of Historic Places in Kent County, Michigan ","title":"President Gerald R.

Michael Adams argues this creates a resonant lexicon reflecting power in both youth culture and television on the changes in American slang. ==Contents== Michael Adams starts the book with a synopsis of the program's history and a defense of ephemeral language. The main body of the work is the detailed glossary of slayer slang, annotated with dialogue. The book concludes with a bibliography and a lengthy index, a guide to sources (novels based on the show, magazine articles about the show, and language culled from the official posting board) and an appendix of slang-making suffixes. {  - !

Yet many moralist critiques misconstrue the full moral message of a show due to a restrictive focus on sex, violence, and profanity.

Such self-sacrifice is typical among many key religious figures.

Frank Barlow thinks that 1012 is more probable as the year of death, Barlow, Edward the Confessor, p. 30. He made his first appearance as a witness to a charter of his father in 993. He probably spent part of his childhood at Æthelingadene, Dean in west Sussex, and his paternal grandmother Ælfthryth may have played an important part in his upbringing. Almost nothing is known of his life, although he seems to have formed a friendship with Sigeforth and Morcar, two of the leading thegns of the Five Boroughs of the East Midlands. In 1013 King Æthelred was forced into temporary exile in Normandy, and while it is not known what became of Æthelstan and his surviving full brothers, Edmund Ironside and Eadwig, during the reign of King Sweyn, they probably remained somewhere in England.

He is best known for his work as a gatherer of Romanian folk tales, recounting them with a remarkable talent. == Career == Petre Ispirescu was born in Bucharest, the son of Gheorghe Ispirescu, a barber, and Elena Ispirescu, a remarkable story teller. He grew up listening to countless folk tales told by his parents and his father's customers and apprentices. His parents wanted him to be a priest and he was entrusted to study with a monk at the Metropolitan Church, after which he studied with a priest at the Domnita Bălaşa Church. He quit in 1844 at age fourteen and became an apprentice at the printing house headed by Zaharia Carcalechi, hoping to further his education by reading the books printed there. Working 14 hours a day, he became a qualified printer in 1848. In 1854, he was hired at the Copainie typography. In 1858, within the context of talks about the unification of Romanian Principates, the printing house accepted to publish the secret correspondence of Prince Nicolae Vogoride without the accord of the censorship. The police arrested all those involved and Petre Ispirescu was jailed for a month, losing his job. By the end of the year, Vasile Boerescu - a supporter of the union of Romanian Principalities and future Foreign Minister - offered him the manager position of a modern typography that owned the first mechanical printing press in Bucharest and published the Nationalul newspaper. His position introduced him to contemporary politicians and writers like Ion Ionescu de la Brad, Nicolae Filimon, Ion Ghica, and Dimitrie Bolintineanu. In 1863, Vasile Boerescu sold the typography and Petre Ispirescu became the manager of the typography publishing the Liberal Party newspaper Romanul. At the time, the Liberal Party was the main opposition party. The newspaper was suppressed in 1864. Ispirescu, together with Walter Scarlat and Frederick Gobl, then founded the United Workers Typography. A year later, Ispirescu publishes the Romanian Typographer pamphlet. The abdication of the first ruler of United Romanian Principalities Alexandru Ioan Cuza in 1866 is recorded with sadness there. After becoming the sole associate of the printing house, he renamed it Romanian Academy Publishing House in 1878. Invited by the Interior Minister Ion Ghica, Petre Ispirescu became the head of the State Printing House in 1866. He resigned two years later. Ispirescu left Bucharest for the first time in his life in 1880 for a short trip to Rosiorii de Vede, a small town 74.5 miles away. In 1883 he has a first stroke and suffered a second stroke while sitting at his desk and died on November 21, 1887. He is buried at Bellu Cemetery in Bucharest along many other famous Romanians. Petre Ispirescu began to publish Romanian folk stories in 1862, at the incentive of N. Filimon. His first collection of six folk tales appears in Taranul Roman and later as a booklet. Subsequently, these tales were added to his renowned collection Romanian Fairy Tales, today a bibliographic rarity. He resumes his publishing work in 1872 with the collection Romanian Folk Tales. Riddles and Proverbs with a preface by B.P. Hasdeu, followed by Folk Anecdotes and Folk Tales in 1874 and The Life and Feats of Mihai Viteazu in 1876. He is praised for the deep and invaluable knowledge of the Romanian folk works. In 1879 he publishes Tales of the Wise Old Man - a retelling in an accessible language for children of universal myths and fragments of Greek mythology - with a preface by Alexandru Odobescu. His major work Romanian Fairy Tales was published in 1882 with a preface by Vasile Alecsandri. ==Works== Ispirescu is especially known for his collections of Romanian folk tales. *Colectie de sase basme in Taranul Roman (1862, a collection of six folk tales published in Taranul Roman) *Legendele si basmele romanilor.

The concept has been responsible for helping many communities see the opportunities that winter offers and helping many residents in the north acknowledge that winter can be an enjoyable time of year and that not everyone need move to warmer climes from November through May. It has often been said that many communities in northern latitudes are living in denial of their northern climate. As evidence, they point to the fact that many northern cities are designed in much the same way that southern/warm-climate cities are designed. == Livable Winter Cities Association == The Livable Winter Cities Association was formed in 1982 by a group of people from across North America and once had chapters in Minneapolis, Ottawa, and Anchorage. Members included cities, planners, architects, engineers, and other interested persons from around the world. From 1982-2005, the Association organized conferences, published books and the quarterly magazine \\"Winter Cities\\". As a non-profit managed by a dedicated but small group of volunteers, the Livable Winter Cities Association, in the end, struggled to maintain its mission. The Association mission is revived now through the efforts of the Winter Cites Institute, whose members include municipalities, community leaders and design professionals from around the world. In their 1986 publication, Livable Winter Cities, The American Institute of Architects and the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada defined winter cities as “places where the average January temperature is 32° F (0° C) or colder, and that are generally located above 45° latitude.\\" Definitions of a what a winter city is have since changed to focus more on the concept of winter city thinking than relying on specific temperatures and geographies of a city. Livable Winter Cities, published in 1986 in Edmonton, provides a solid context and background of the City's relationship with winter. The book emphasizes the lack of literature on the design of winter cities, and attempts to provide a comprehensive resource for winter cities, at a time when it was a relatively newer topic. It outlines the historical roots of Edmonton, claiming “northern cities in the west were built almost entirely in the twentieth century by private and public builders working on their properties, to answer their own needs”. This focus on private and individualistic needs has left our city unconnected, spread out, and ill- equipped to deal with winter. Livable Winter Cities claims that most efforts in Winter Cities have centered on bringing a sense of the outdoors inside, however, there a need to extend some of the comforts of the indoors to the world of outdoor public spaces. For outdoor spaces, they suggest that outdoor spaces consider solar access, include heat islands, and essentially have a winter purpose. Along with this, inviting lighting, use of colour, and ice or snow sculpture should be included as well. ==The Winter Cities Institute== Northern communities or “winter cities” have great opportunities to mitigate negative effects of the winter season while reinforcing the many positive aspects to create a vibrant, sustainable and livable environment for a prosperous future. The sustainability of winter cities requires a creative approach that addresses the problems of snow and cold while enhancing the advantages, opportunities and beauty of the winter season. A positive approach benefits the attitudes of residents, and bolsters the community's ability to attract new business and residents. The mission of the Winter Cities Institute is to provide information, resources and networking opportunities for those who desire to make northern communities more livable and sustainable. Their goal is to be the best source for information, research, reports, plans and news about winter cities from around the northern world, focusing on how to make the best of the winter season. The membership includes architects, planners, landscape architects, engineers, elected and appointed city officials, parks and recreation professionals, economic developers, and community leaders and activists interested in learning new approaches and exchanging success stories. The Winter Cities Institute website offers a vast collection of materials about winter cities. A selection of resource materials is provided at no cost, however, membership provides access to the large library of the Winter Cities Institute. ==Features of a Winter City== Winter is often perceived as a negative force that generates inconvenience and added cost, in part due to cities and buildings planned and constructed as if they were in a southern, warmer location. City and town planning, site design, transportation and infrastructure engineering, and architecture can all benefit through the application of \\"Winter City\\" design principles that work with nature rather than against it, in order to make winter a positive part of a four-season lifestyle. The goal is to create livability, reduce human discomfort, promote energy efficiency and the economic sustainability of northern places. == Winter City Edmonton == In 2013 the city of Edmonton approved the WinterCity Strategy. This strategy has four pillars of focus– Winter Life, Winter Design, Winter Economy, and Our Winter Story. In 2016, the City released the Winter City Design Guidelines, a document that outlines how to best equip our city to thrive and function in the winter months. The guidelines cover many areas of design— streets, architecture, infrastructure, vegetation, public art, way finding, transit, and more. The guidelines offer five main principles of design for a winter city. # Incorporate strategies to block wind, particular prevailing winds and downdrafts # Maximize sun exposure through orientation and design # Use of colour to enliven the winterscape # Create visual interest with light, while being mindful of intensity, spread, contrast, and colour # Design and provide infrastructure that supports desired winter life and improves comfort and access in cold weather Sun and wind exposure is a major area of consideration when thinking about urban design. For urban areas, taller buildings should be located on the north side of streets to avoid shadow casting over sidewalks and outdoor spaces. Along with these building considerations, side to side building heights should be varied by one- to two-storeys to reduce wind speeds. At the base of these buildings, compact, fine-grained developments create a more inviting and walkable area. Fine-grained is defined in these guidelines by “small blocks, narrow frontages, and frequent storefronts”. For outdoor parks and streets, vegetation near roads must be able to withstand salt, sand, and gravel. Plant material along sidewalks or parking lots should be set back to allow for space for snow storage, and raised plant beds can protect damage from both snow clearing and grass cutting equipment. Deciduous trees are a great choice for south facing areas, as they allow sun to reach the ground during the winter months while providing shade in the warmer summer months. The guidelines also outline tips for lightning. Feature lighting is a great way to create an inviting atmosphere in the dim months, providing visual interest, landmarks, and a sense of safety. The city recommends that lighting face downward to reduce light pollution. ==References *Winter Cities Institute * * * Category:City Category:Winter in culture ","title":"Winter City"},{"id":"6200872","text":"Guy Montagu George Finch-Hatton, 14th Earl of Winchilsea and 9th Earl of Nottingham OBE DSC (28 May 1885 – 10 February 1939) was an English peer and banker.

Most of these works depicted scenes drawn from literature (including Edmund Spenser and John Milton), religion, and history. Pickersgill's The Burial of Harold was accepted as a decoration for the Houses of Parliament in 1847 for the sum of £500. He also did some landscapes under the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites. In 1856 Pickersgill was photographed at The Photography Institute by Robert Howlett, as part of a series of portraits of artists. The picture was among a group exhibited at the Art Treasures Exhibition in Manchester in 1857. In addition, Pickersgill seems to have experimented with photography himself. Pickersgill was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1847 and a full Royal Academician in June 1857, but retired in 1888.

He was an immigrant to the United States who settled in La Crosse, Wisconsin in 1864, finding work as a steamfitter and plumber. In 1885, he opened his own plumbing shop. Besides being a steamfitter and a plumber, James Trane was also an inventor. He designed a new type of low-pressure steam heating system, Trane vapor heating. Reuben Trane, James' son, earned a Mechanical Engineering degree (B.S. 1910) at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and joined his father's plumbing firm. In 1913, James and Reuben incorporated The Trane Company. By 1916, the Tranes were no longer in the plumbing business, but rather were focusing their attention on manufacturing heating products. In 1925, Reuben Trane invented a new type of heat transfer device known as the convector radiator. It consisted of a new style of heat exchanger in a sheet metal cabinet—a highly efficient, lightweight replacement for the bulky, slow responding castiron radiator. In 1931, The Trane Company developed its first air conditioning unit, the Trane unit cooler, and in 1938 its first centrifugal refrigeration machine, the Turbovac. == References  *Trane official website Category:1857 births Category:1936 deaths Category:People from Tromsø Category:People from La Crosse, Wisconsin Category:Norwegian emigrants to the United States Category:19th-century American inventors Category:20th-century American inventors Category:American industrialists Category:American company founders Category:American business executives Category:Ingersoll Rand people ","title":"James Trane"},{"id":"6200909","text":"Saï is a large island in the Nile River in Nubia between the second and third cataracts, in the country of Sudan.

The next year, he was joined by his wartime research colleague, Akio Morita, and on May, 7 1946, they founded a company called Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo K.K. (Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation). The company produced Japan's first tape recorder, called the Type-G. The Sony Former Headquarters in Shinagawa, Tokyo In the early 1950s, Ibuka traveled to the United States, looking for a market for the company's tape recorder, and heard about Bell Labs' invention of the transistor. He convinced Bell to license the transistor technology to his Japanese company. Bell Labs agreed to do so while recommending Ibuka to produce hearing aids using the transistor, then a popular application for the technology, suggesting that it would be difficult to apply the technology to radio. While most Japanese companies were researching the transistor for its military applications, Ibuka and Morita looked to apply it to communications. Although the American companies Regency Electronics and Texas Instruments built the first transistor radio as joint venture in 1954, it would be the Ibuka's company that made them commercially successful for the first time.Hongo, Jun, \\"Once one and only, Sony seeks to regain that status\\", Japan Times, 22 May 2012, p. 3 ==As an innovator== In August 1955, Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo released the Sony TR-55, Japan's first commercially produced transistor radio. They followed up in December of the same year by releasing the TR-72, a product that won favor both within Japan and in export markets, including Canada, Australia, the Netherlands and Germany. Featuring six transistors, push-pull output and greatly improved sound quality, the TR-72 continued to be a popular seller into the early sixties. In May 1956, the company released the TR-6, which featured an innovative slim design and sound quality capable of rivaling portable tube radios. The following year, 1957, Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo came out with the TR-63 model, then the smallest (112 × 71 × 32 mm) transistor radio in commercial production. It was a worldwide commercial success. The company marketed the radio as \\"pocketable\\", a Japanese-style English word the company came up with to highlight its portablity and pocket-size. The word soon featured in English dictionary. University of Arizona professor Michael Brian Schiffer, PhD, says, \\"Sony was not first, but its transistor radio was the most successful. The TR-63 of 1957 cracked open the U.S. market and launched the new industry of consumer microelectronics.\\" By the mid-1950s, American teens had begun buying portable transistor radios in huge numbers, helping to propel the fledgling industry from an estimated 100,000 units in 1955 to 5,000,000 units by the end of 1968. As a result of the popularity of transistor radios, which empowered privacy and individualism, the way people listen to radio or music has changed forever. Sony also launched the world's first integrated circuit radio, the ICR-100 in 1967. Following the first success in American consumer market, Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo changed its name to Sony in 1958 as people outside Japan struggled to pronounce the original name. Sony established Sony Corporation of America, the company's first subsidiary in America, in 1960. And in the same year, Sony made another innovation by releasing the world's first non- projection type all-transistor and portable television, Sony TV8-301. In 1961, Sony launched the world's first compact transistor VTR, the PV-100. In 1968, Sony launched the legendary color television set, Trinitron. The Trinitron was the reason that Sony had been the world's largest TV manufacturer in terms of annual revenue until 2006. In 1969, Sony launched Sony TC-50, a compact cassette recorder. NASA equipped every astronaut with the device from Apollo 7 onwards. Astronauts were required to use the recorder to log their missions but they also listened to music by inserting and playing the pre-recorded tapes. Masaru Ibuka also enjoyed listening to classical music using recorders, preluding the birth of Walkman. In October the same year, Sony released a prototype of the world's first commercial videocassette recorder. This led to the official launch of the VP-1100 two years later. Sony received the Emmy in 1973 for developing the Trinitron. This was the first Emmy awarded to an electronics. In 1975, Sony launched the Betamax, which took part and lost in the video format war. Walkman, the first stereo cassette player, was launched in 1979. The year 1981 is considered as a starting point of the digital revolution with Sony launching the world's first Compact Disc player, the Sony CDP-101, with a Compact Disc (CD) itself, a new data storage format Sony and Philips co-developed. In that year, a 3.5-inch floppy disk structure was introduced by Sony and it soon became the defacto standard. Sony is also the company that produced the first color video camera using a CCD, the XC-1. The Sony Mavica, released in 1981, is a prototype of the world's first commercial electronic still camera. Sony played a significant role in the tech industry in the second half of the 20th Century alongside Hewlett-Packard and IBM. Steve Jobs, fascinated by the company's innovative products, culture and work environment, was a big fan of Sony and regarded the company being in a league of their own, apart from the other comparable competitors. In 1991, Sony released the first commercial lithium-ion battery jointly with Asahi Kasei and had been the leader in the rechargeable battery industry until a massive defective battery scandal occurred in 2006. Sony introduced Memory Stick, a flash memory storage format, in 1998, a year earlier than the announcement of SD card. The Sony's format is considered as a yet another failed standard from the company. The list of Sony's unsuccessful attempts to make their proprietary formats universally adopted includes Betamax, MiniDisc or the well-known abbreviated term, the MD, and Universal Media Disc. ==Beyond an electronics powerhouse== Sony played a major role in the development of Japan as a powerful exporter during the late 20th century.Christian, Caryl, and With Hideko Takayama and Kay Itoi in Tokyo, George Wehrfritz in Hong Kong, John Sparks and Michael Hastings in,New York. \\"Sony is Not Japan ; the Appointment of a Foreign CEO is a Sign of how Far the Iconic Company has Fallen in the Japanese Corporate Elite.\\" Newsweek Mar 21 2005: 30-. ProQuest Research Library. Web. 26 May 2012. From the late 80s to early 2000s, it aggressively expanded into a variety of businesses, from film (Sony Pictures Entertainment) and insurance (Sony Life) to banking (Sony Bank) to internet service providing (So-net) and gaming (Sony Interactive Entertainment). It also beefed up the music business it had operated in Japan, CBS/Sony Record, and turned it into Sony Music Entertainment, a multinational music label group. Part of its motivation for expansion was the pursuit of \\"convergence,\\" linking film, music, and digital electronics via the Internet. However this strategy ultimately failed, merely damaging Sony's balance sheet and making the company's business structure highly complex. ==Crisis and challenges== Howard Stringer, the first non-Japanese CEO of Sony, helped to reinvigorate the company's struggling media businesses, encouraging blockbusters such as Spider-Man while cutting 9,000 jobs. Despite modest success, the company faced continued struggles from the mid 2000s and started to lose the leading position in the tech industry. It became known for its stagnancy, with a fading brand name.

Fistric (born June 1, 1986) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey defenceman. He last played with the Anaheim Ducks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted by the Dallas Stars 28th overall in the first round of the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. He played major junior for the Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League (WHL). == Playing career == Fistric began his major junior career in the WHL with the Vancouver Giants in 2001–02 while spending the majority of the season in the Alberta Midget Hockey League (AMHL), winning the Brian Benning Trophy as the league's top defenceman with the Maple Leaf Athletic Club. Fistric's banner in the Pacific Coliseum, as part of the Giants' Ring of Honour After a 12-point campaign with the Giants in 2003–04, he was drafted in the first round, 28th overall, by the Dallas Stars in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. He returned to the Giants but was kept out of the lineup for all but 15 games in the subsequent 2004–05 season. In his fourth and final WHL season, Fistric won the 2006 President's Cup with the Giants and competed in the 2006 Memorial Cup. Five years after graduating from junior, Fistric was inducted into the Giants' Ring of Honour, a series of banners commemorating the team's best alumni. Turning pro in 2006–07, Fistric was assigned to the Iowa Stars, Dallas' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, and scored 24 points in his professional rookie season. He made his debut with Dallas the following season in 2007–08, splitting the campaign between Iowa and the NHL. He managed 2 assists in his 35-game NHL rookie season with the Stars. Fistric continued to split time between the Stars and the AHL in 2008–09, recording 4 assists in 36 games in his second NHL season. In the off-season, the Stars re-signed Fistric to a three-year, $3 million contract on July 8, 2009. Fistric is known for his aggressive physical play. In a game against the Calgary Flames on January 27, 2010, Fistric received a match penalty for intent to injure after hitting opposing forward Eric Nystrom (who later became a Stars teammate) over the head with his own helmet during a fight, when the helmet became caught on his hand. The following day, he was fined $2,500 by the league for the incident. On January 14, 2013, Prior to the lockout shortened 2012–13 season, Fistric was traded by the Stars to the Edmonton Oilers for a Third Round pick in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. On August 20, 2013, the Anaheim Ducks signed Fistric as a free agent to a one-year, $900,000 contract. In the 2013–14 season, Fistric was the Ducks depth defenseman, adding a physical element in 34 games. During the campaign, Fistric was signed to a three-year contract extension with Anaheim on January 29, 2014. In the following 2014–15 season, Fistric effectiveness was hampered by a back injury, limiting him to just 9 regular season games. With the emergence of depth among the organization on the blueline, Fistric was placed on unconditional waivers and bought out from the final two-years of his contract with the Ducks on June 29, 2015. == Career statistics Regular season and playoffs=== { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"text-align:center; width:60em\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Playoffs - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

He created a costume coated in the substance and decided to use it to rob banks. His all-white bodysuit allows him to slide across floors with relative ease, and renders him impervious to Spider-Man's webbing. The suit has pads on the gloves so that Slyde can grip objects without them slipping from his grasp.Amazing Spider-Man #272. Marvel Comics. Slyde was part of the seventh such group called the Masters of Evil when the villainous assemblage tangled with the Thunderbolts, ironic because the Thunderbolts are mostly made up of reformed members of the Masters of Evil.Thunderbolts #24-25. Marvel Comics. Upon the realization that he was turning forty soon, he got a new costume, gave himself a new (and fictional) origin, and made an attempt at robbing a bank with henchmen—but it was all a ploy to lure Spider-Man out in order to fight him. At the end of the story, on the way to jail, he mused that, knowing that he \\"went toe to toe with Spider-Man\\", he is entirely all right with middle age.Spider-Man Unlimited vol. 3 #1.

However, Slyde balked at the proposal. He was shot in the back of the head and apparently killed by Hammerhead's enforcer Underworld, in order to send a message to those who would refuse to join Hammerhead's organization.Civil War: War Crimes one-shot (February 2007).

Spider-Man attempts to stop Slyde from getting his revenge, but is unable to get his webs to affect him. Slyde escapes by causing a fire escape to collapse and forcing Spider-Man to save civilians from getting crushed.

It is the second novel in the first of three trilogies about Bernard Samson, a middle-aged and somewhat jaded intelligence officer working for the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). Mexico Set is part of the Game, Set and Match trilogy, being preceded by Berlin Game and followed by London Match. This trilogy is followed by the Hook, Line and Sinker trilogy and the final Faith, Hope and Charity trilogy. Deighton's novel Winter (1987) is a prequel to the nine novels, covering the years 1900-1945 and providing the backstory to some of the characters. Mexico Set continues the story that began with Berlin Game, where Bernard Samson's wife Fiona was unmasked as a KGB double agent. ==Plot summary== The story begins in Mexico, where Samson is on the trail of his Soviet opposite number: Erich Stinnes, a KGB major working in East Germany whom London Central wishes to coax over to the West. The task of laying the delicate and elaborate groundwork for Stinnes' defection propels Samson from Mexico to London, Paris, Berlin, and the East-West border. What happens along the way—a temporary abduction, an unnecessary murder, an inconvenient suicide—happens so fast that Samson hardly seems able to keep London Central informed of developments. Or is it that Samson wants to keep his colleagues in the dark? Certainly London Central's entire senior staff—from Samson's immediate supervisors, locked in their endless internecine office warfare, to the dotty Director-General himself—would have reason to suspect that Samson might be working for the other side. He was, after all, closer than any of the other to the former traitor-in-their-midst. And Samson himself is losing control—indeed, events seem to be controlling him. As he finds himself in a series of ever more incriminating positions, as one by one the avenues of escape or vindication close before him, the novel winds back toward Mexico.. and toward the astonishing climax - at the scene of the defection Samson has so painstakingly orchestrated—in which the allegiances of all involved are finally and fatefully revealed. ==Adaptations== Years after its publication, Granada TV made a version of the trilogy for ITV, consisting of twelve 60 minute episodes, called Game, Set and Match, starring Ian Holm as Bernard Samson and Mel Martin as Fiona. It was adapted by John Howlett and directed by Ken Grieve and Patrick Lau. ==References== Category:1984 British novels Category:Bernard Samson novels Category:Hutchinson (publisher) books ","title":"Mexico Set"},{"id":"6201008","text":"E Ink Corporation (E Ink) is a subsidiary of E Ink Holdings (EIH), a Taiwanese Holding Company (8069.TWO) manufacturer of electrophoretic displays marketed under the name E Ink, a kind of electronic paper.

He was the acting Mayor of New Orleans during the Union occupation of the city and also captured and occupied the Confederate capitol, Richmond, Virginia. Weitzel also is known for his post-war accomplishments with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in designing and constructing internal improvements, particularly along the Ohio River and the Great Lakes region. ==Early and family life== Gottfreid Weitzel was born in Winzeln, near Pirmasens in the Palatinate, once part of Lorraine but which had returned to German control in 1806, and was then part of the Kingdom of Bavaria.://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=400 His father Ludwig, had served in the German military, and wanted to emigrate to America like his brother Wilhelm, in search of a better life. When his wife, the former Susanna Krummel, became pregnant with what turned out to be a second son, the family immigrated to the United States. They settled in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1837, where Ludwig changed his name to Lewis and his two-year-old son's to Godfrey, perhaps to avoid prejudice against German immigrants, or to Americanize the family. Lewis Weitzel operated a grocery store in the Tenth Ward, which included the \\"Over the Rhine\\" neighborhood with many Germanic immigrants, and also became involved in Democratic party politics. In 1853, Lewis Weitzel became a city commissioner (serving for three years) and also served on the local school board, whose chairman was lawyer and former U.S. Congressman Bellamy Storer. Educated with his younger brother (Lewis Jr.) in the city schools (including the new \\"central\\" high school in the basement of the German Lutheran Church on Walnut below Ninth), Godfrey finished at the top of his class. Storer offered to pay for the boy's college tuition, but then with the help of publisher Heinrich Roedter contacted congressman David Tiernan Disney and managed to secure an appointment to the United States Military Academy, although the process started when Godfrey was just 14 (the minimum entrance age was 16) and the tall youth arrived in West Point, New York months after his 15th birthday.Quatman, A Young General and the Fall of Richmond (Ohio University Press, 2015)pp. xv, 2–5 There, Godfrey was nicknamed \\"Dutch\\" and continued to excel academically, demonstrating proficiency in mathematics and engineering. His roommates included Cyrus Comstock (who became a lifelong friend), and Francis Redding Tillou Nicholls of Donaldsonville, Louisiana. When Weitzel was a sophomore, Captain Henry Brewerton was replaced as superintendent by Colonel Robert E. Lee, who took an interest in the top student, but was reassigned himself in March 1855, shortly before Weitzel's class graduated. Nonetheless, Weitzel graduated 2nd out of 34 cadets in the Class of 1855 (his roommate Comstock was first).Quatman, pp. 15–29. Second Lieutenant Weitzel's first assignment was helping improve the defenses of New Orleans under Major P.G.T. Beauregard, who had also graduated second in his class (as had Robert E. Lee in his). His work on Fort Jackson, Fort St. Philip and the Customs house earned the respect of Major Beauregard and Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, so Weitzel was promoted to First Lieutenant. Knowledge of those defenses would prove crucial later in his career.Quatman, pp. 31–33. In 1859, Weitzel returned to West Point as Assistant Professor of Civil and Military Engineering, working under professor Dennis Mahan. During home leave in 1858, he had become engaged to Louisa C. Moor of Cincinnati, and they married at Cincinnati's German Lutheran Church on November 3, 1859. However, three weeks later her skirts caught fire as she prepared Thanksgiving dinner, and despite Godfrey's efforts to douse them, she suffered severe burns and died within hours. Weitzel accompanied her body to Cincinnati. The grief- stricken widower was granted eight months leave, including permission to travel to Germany.Quatman, pp. 33, 36–38. While remaining close to the Moor family (who had no other children and virtually \\"adopted\\" him as a son), eventually, Weitzel became engaged on another furlough home. On January 6, 1865, he married Louise Bogen, daughter of Peter Bogen, a prominent pork- packer and grower of Catawba grapes for winemaking. They would have three children, only one of whom survived infancy. Their first child was a stillborn son named Godfrey Weitzel, delivered on September 26, 1865. Their second child, Blanche Celeste Weitzel, was born on February 16, 1868, but contracted measles and died on April 5. Their third child, Irene Weitzel, born on April 11, 1876, lived until 1936 and left descendants. ==Career== Weitzel was promoted to first lieutenant of engineers in 1860. In 1861, he was reassigned to Washington, D.C. in the Corps of Engineers. His company served as the bodyguard during the inauguration of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln. ===American Civil War=== When the American Civil War began, Weitzel was assigned to construct defenses, including in Cincinnati and Washington, as well as for George McClellan in the Army of the Potomac in late 1861. He was then attached to the staff of Major General Benjamin F. Butler as chief engineer of the Department of the Gulf. When Union troops captured New Orleans, Weitzel became assistant military commander and acting mayor. He was promoted to brigadier general in August 1862 and two months later routed a large force of the enemy at Labadieville, Louisiana, which earned him a brevet promotion to major in the Regular Army. Weitzel commanded a brigade in the XIX Corps advancing in Major General Nathaniel P. Banks's operations in western Louisiana during April and May 1863, which led to the siege of Port Hudson. Weitzel was later brevetted lieutenant colonel in the Regular Army, \\"for gallant and meritorious services at the siege of Port Hudson,\\" which fell on July 9, 1863, days after Vicksburg, Mississippi, about 120 miles upriver, the last Confederate stronghold on the great Mississippi, had fallen. Together those successful sieges and the continuing blockage of Southern ports completed the Anaconda Plan. Beginning in May through September 1864, Weitzel was assigned as chief engineer of the Army of the James, still under General Benjamin F. Butler, which was targeting the Confederate capitol, as well as its naval defenses under the remnants of the James River Squadron. He was engaged in May at Swift's Creek and the actions near Drury's Bluff and the Bermuda Hundred Campaign (against his former commander, now Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard), and the Deep Bottom in August. By month's end, Weitzel was brevetted major general of volunteers \\"for meritorious and distinguished services during the civil war.\\" General Weitzel assumed command of the XVIII Corps from September 1864 through the end of the year, and was brevetted colonel in the regular army for the capture of Fort Harrison (renamed Fort Burnham for the Union commander dying in the assault) on September 29. On November 7, 1864, Weitzel became a major general of volunteers and on December 3 was assigned command of the XXV Corps, consisting of U.S. Colored Troops under white officers. As the year ended, he participated in the unsuccessful First Battle of Fort Fisher, guarding Wilmington, North Carolina, the last major Confederate port. He and his corps were reassigned to Virginia two weeks later, when General Butler was relieved of duty in favor of General Alfred H. Terry, who captured the port on January 15. During the war's final months, Ulysses S. Grant named Weitzel to command all Union troops north of the Appomattox River during the final operations against Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Speaking to his men on February 20, 1865, Weitzel told them: After the fall of Petersburg, Confederate forces considered their capitol, Richmond, indefensible. They evacuated, and set fire to and its military and tobacco storehouses during their retreat the night of April 2, which blaze spread to surrounding residential and commercial buildings. The city's mayor, Joseph Mayo traveled out along the Osborn Turnpike to Tree Hill Farm to find a Union commander to whom to surrender the city that night, and ask for help quelling the blaze. He found Majors Atherton H. Stevens Jr. and Eugene E. Graves who took his note to Major General Weitzel, who rode in to Richmond's city hall and accepted the formal surrender document at 8:15 that morning.http://www.markerhistory.com/surrender-of-richmond-marker-v-40 Thus Weitzel took possession of Richmond, on April 3, 1865, and his Union forces extinguished the fires. Weitzel soon established his headquarters in the home of Jefferson Davis. His aide, Lieutenant Johnston de Peyster, is credited with raising the first U.S. flag over the city after its capture by the Union. The next day, President Abraham Lincoln visited the Confederacy's capital. Weitzel served as Lincoln's confidential aide and bodyguard during two days of peace negotiations with Confederate representatives. After Lincoln's assassination days later, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton refused to believe the generous terms on which Lincoln would have allowed Virginia to rejoin the Union.Quatman p. xiv In histories of Masons' Hall in Richmond, it has been noted that Weitzel protected Masons' Hall from burning and looting in the time period immediate after the Confederate's retreat from Richmond. Weitzel, who was a Freemason, was requested by old Masons of the city to protect the Hall, and Weitzel granted their request and had sentinels posted so that no harm was done to it. In 1866, after the war's end, Weitzel reflected on the service of African American soldiers in the Union Army, stating: ===Postwar career=== While other generals were feted at the end of the war, the German immigrant and his all-black Army corps were sent to Texas to evict the French who had occupied Mexico, which was considered one of the most difficult assignments. Weitzel remained in command of the District of Rio Grande until 1866, when he was mustered out of the volunteer service on March 1. He reverted to his regular Army rank, but was promoted to major of engineers later that year and to lieutenant colonel in 1882. In August 1866 he began designing an expanded canal around the Falls of the Ohio on the Indiana side. In 1875, he established the temporary lighthouse on a pole in the lake at Alpena, Michigan. In 1877 he built a crib for the second Alpena Light. He also designed it as a timber building in the form of a brown wooden pyramidal tower, complete with a Sixth Order Fresnel lens. In July 1888 it burned with much of the town.National Park Service Maritime Heritage Program, Inventory of Historic Light Stations – Michigan Lighthouses, Alpena Light. In 1881 Weitzel completed the building of a lock at the Soo Canal, at that time the largest canal lock in the world, and the next year the Stannard Rock Lighthouse on Lake Superior. He also helped design and build the Spectacle Reef Light with Colonel Orlando M. Poe. Transferred to Philadelphia, he was in charge of engineering projects in the region, and Chairman of the Commission Advisatory to the Board of Harbor Commissioners. ==Death and legacy== Weitzel caught typhoid fever after being reassigned to Philadelphia. He lived near the University of Pennsylvania, but toured the city, and the fetid water of the Aramingo Canal about five miles away was blamed. Medical treatment was ineffective. He died from complication after about a month, on March 19, 1884.Quatman pp. 291–3 His body was returned to Cincinnati for burial in Spring Grove Cemetery, in his in-laws' plot. Although Weitzel had wanted a private funeral, his hometown wanted to express gratitude for his service, and conducted its largest gathering in many years. Ohio's First National Guard and Jacob D. Cox, as well as members of Cincinnati's Society of Ex-Army and Navy Officers accompanied his remains to the English Lutheran Church (which was packed), and thousands lined the streets to the cemetery. He was survived by his elderly mother, his brother State Senator Lewis Weitzel, and his widow (who died on August 18, 1927) and daughter Irene (1876–1936). The U.S. Army named one of the major streets in Arlington National Cemetery \\"Ord & Weitzel Drive\\" after the unassuming engineer, although the northern gate with that name was later removed upon the cemetery's expansion.Quatman pp. 293–4 ==See also== *List of American Civil War generals (Union) *German Americans in the Civil War *Saginaw River Light *XXV Corps ==NotesReferences== * *Cincinnati CWRT article on Weitzel ==Further reading== * Taylor, Paul (October 2009) Orlando M.

Takayama-Ogawa's heritage since the 15th century of Japanese ceramic art influences her work, that usually explores beauty, decoration, ornamentation and narrative while also introducing a dialogue that rejects the traditional role of women in Japanese culture. Her most recent work addresses issues like climate change. == Early life and education == Takayama-Ogawa began her extensive education at the International Christian University, Tokyo, when she was just 20 years old. While there, she spent a year studying conversational Japanese and with an intent in learning more about her family's connection with Japanese ceramics. Here she was first introduced to Jōmon pottery by faculty member and expert, J. E. Kidder, which was the beginning of her “life long interest in archeology and geology.” She continued on to receive her Bachelor of Fine Arts in East Asian studies and geography from UCLA in 1978. Then her Masters of Arts at the Stanford Graduate School of Education in 1979 and finally her ceramics education at Otis College of Art and Design, LA in 1989. At Otis, Ogawa studied with Ralph Bacerra, chair of Otis's ceramic department. His teaching focused on material proficiency over concept, his emphasis on form, surface and finish directly influenced Ogawa's stylistic choices in her early ceramic work. == Artist career and style == When Ogawa signed up for ceramics classes one summer, around the time when she was working as the Academic Dean at Crossroads School in Santa Monica, she discovered that her newly found creative outlet also connected to her personal history. She was previously aware that her mother's family in Osaka had donated an extensive collection of Japanese ceramics to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in the 1960s. Including works by ceramicists Kenkichi Tomimoto and Kenzan Ogata. But now she discovered that her father's family has a well known history of ceramic production in Tokoname, Japan dating back to the 15th century. Judy Seckler notes in Ceramics Monthly, “Recollecting the Past”, “This talent for claywork lay dormant in her genes until it was given a chance to bubble up to the surface and lay the groundwork for her new life as a clay artist.” Not too long after, she realized her urge to work with clay had “escalated into an obsession,” she left her middle-school teaching career to pursue a future in the ceramic arts. Takayama-Ogawa's early works are often in the form of a teapot and tea bowls, referencing the important tradition of tea ceremonies in Japan. Although in Elaine Levin's Ceramics Monthly article, she mentions, alongside Keiko Fukazawa, that “Both artists admit that they have vigorously resisted the narrow, traditional role of women in Japanese culture, yet the teapot and the tea bowl of the tea ceremony—forms that have an important relation to ceramics tradition, and to women and culture in Japan—have had a significant impact on the work of both.” Currently, Takayama-Ogawa's work focuses on climate change. https://static1.squarespace.com/static/581e2b4946c3c40f061317ba/t/5a76a9d0f9619a31bd324bab/1517726160955/ClimateChange_Harvey.pdf https://www.joantakayamaogawa.com/climate-change/ == Teaching career == After graduating from Stanford, Takayama-Ogawa started her first position in education at the Crossroads School in Santa Monica, CA in 1979, where she worked as faculty, as well as Academic Dean. until she decided to further her education at Otis College of Art and Design in 1985. That same year, she also transitioned to her current position at Otis as a Professor in Ceramics, Product Design, English and Public Speaking. In 2010, she was appointed Ceramics Coordinator, and she was in charge of “bringing clay back to Otis with a focus on 3D printing and clay”. Within that position in 2012, she has organized a corporate sponsored project with Gainey Ceramics, where students designed models to be manufactured and sold through Gainey. She has also organized three faculty development workshops for 2011 Clay in LA Symposium. == Recognition == * 2017 73 Scripps Annual Artist Curator, Scripps College, Claremont, CA * 2016 Pasadena Design Commissioner at AMOCA * 2016 NCECA Speaker * 2014 NCECA Speaker, Milwaukee and Kansas City * 2014 One of the top 50 American Ceramics Artists by The Marks Project * 2010 Otis College of Art and Design, Faculty Development Grant Laguna Clay Company, Lomitas, CA. * 2006 Recipient of the Otis Faculty Development Grant * Recipient of the Otis Faculty Technology Grant * 2005 Artist in Residency, Watershed, Maine * 2004 Teacher of the Year Commencement Speaker at Otis College of Art and Design * 1994 Glading McBean and Co., \\"Feats of Clay,\\" Merit Award,\\" Lincoln, California. * 1993 Renwick Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, \\"Workshop and Lecture Series,\\" Washington D.C. * 1978 UCLA President's Undergraduate Fellowship, researched the history of Little Tokyo. == Permanent collections == * Renwick Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. * deYoung Museum, San Francisco * Los Angeles County Museum of Art * Oakland Museum of California * Long Beach Museum of Art * American Museum of Ceramic Art, Pomona, California * Racine Art Museum * World Ceramic Exposition Foundation, Icheon, South Korea * Princessehof Leeuwarden Nationaal Keramiekmuseum, Leeuwarden, Netherlands * George Ohr Museum, Biloxi, Mississippi * Kamm Teapot Foundation * David and Jackie Charak Foundation * Hallmark Collection * Celestial Seasoning Tea Company * Newark Museum of Art, Newark, NY * Stanford University Art Museum * Flint Institute, Flint, Michigan == Further reading == # American Craft Magazine. “Joan Takayama-Ogawa,” Portfolio, April/May 1996 # Clark, Garth.

It was shown in the Philadelphia television market only. There was only one season of Starstuff with a total of 18 episodes airing on Saturday mornings. While it was first shown in 1980, it was rerun repeatedly throughout the next several years. The opening and closing music consisted of a melange of music from Gustav Holst's The Planets suite, movements four and six, Jupiter and Uranus. ==Format== Starstuff centered around a boy named Chris (Todd Porter) and a girl named Ingrid (Johanna Hickey). Chris lived in the present while Ingrid lived in the future on a space colony. Chris's television set was able to pick up video transmission from Ingrid's spaceship and they were able to communicate, often showing each other clips from Laurel and Hardy's Laughtunes as well as snippets of the educational children's news show, Kidsworld. There was a sub- show within Starstuff titled The Edge Of Space, and was generally the second- to-last segment in the show. Lasting approximately 10 minutes, it was a space- based puppet segment starring Krikles, Zornad, and their robot assistant, Giz, as they explored the universe in their spaceship searching for life. From puppeteer Mark Ritts: I taped the puppet bits separately, perhaps a half dozen at a time, on a day when the main cast was off learning their lines. So I don't remember even meeting them ... Krikles's voice was a simple, light character voice that I have used years, variously adapted, for a string of characters, including Storytime's \\"Kino\\" (PBS). Zornad's voice was a bit of a steal from a favorite comic of mine who used to be a regular on the old Steve Allen Show—Dayton Allen, whose signature line was \\"Whyyyyy not??!\\" In addition, within the hour-long show was a half-hour CBS network children's program inserted. Starstuff would run about 10 to 20 minutes followed by the 30 minute CBS show and then the conclusion of Starstuff.

It is the concluding novel in the first of three trilogies about Bernard Samson, a middle-aged and somewhat jaded intelligence officer working for the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). London Match is part of the Game, Set and Match trilogy, being preceded by Berlin Game and Mexico Set. This trilogy is followed by the Hook, Line and Sinker trilogy and the final Faith, Hope and Charity trilogy. Deighton's novel Winter (1987) is a prequel to the nine novels, covering the years 1900-1945 and providing the backstory to some of the characters. London Match concludes the story that began with Berlin Game, where Bernard Samson's wife Fiona was unmasked as a KGB double agent and was forced into defecting, and that was continued in Mexico Set, where Bernard Samson assisted the defection of Erich Stinnes, his KGB opposite number. ==Plot summary== Samson suspects that there is a traitor within his department of MI6, due to the appearance of a memorandum which was leaked to the KGB. It transpires that it is part of a plot conducted by his wife—now working for East German intelligence—to frame his superior, Bret Rensselaer, as a KGB agent. When Samson's old friend Werner Volkmann is arrested by the East German police Samson organizes an unauthorised exchange of defector Erich Stinnes for him, but the operation ends in a shootout on the Berlin S-Bahn. ==Adaptations== Bernard Samson was played by Ian Holm and Fiona Samson by Mel Martin in a 1988 Granada Television adaptation of the first trilogy, entitled Game, Set and Match, transmitted as twelve 60 minute episodes. Filmed on location in Berlin and Mexico, the project included a large international cast with 3,000 extras and a budget of $8 million.

According to the Canada 2016 Census, the community had a population of 193, down from 220 in 2011, a decrease of 12.3%. There are 186 dwellings of which 84 are occupied by usual residents. Canadian Forces Station Armstrong, located 1.1 miles (1.8 km) east of Armstrong, was closed in 1974. Later that year the base was sold to private owners and turned into a popular gathering area for the town that included a restaurant and bar, hotel, multiple apartments, garages, and a curling rink. The area, known as D&L;, was closed and abandoned in 1993 and remains that way today. The town of Armstrong currently has two restaurants, a Canada Post post office, a clinic, a Mini Mart gas station and motel, and the Armstrong General store (formally J&J; General store 1961-2015). Armstrong Airport is located 4.5 nautical miles (8.3 km; 5.2 mi) east southeast of Armstrong. The VIA Rail Canadian train travels through and stops on request in Armstrong.

Officially, it is a segment of the longer Crystal Springs Regional Trail. Approximately 300,000 people use the trail every year. It provides excellent views of San Francisco Peninsula's Crystal Springs Watershed. The trail is managed by San Mateo County and totally surfaced in asphalt. There is considerable biodiversity along the trail due to the variation in habitat and the presence of serpentine soils. In particular the plant communities of Northern coastal scrub, grassland and California oak woodland are present. ==Path== Crystal Springs Regional Trail map (Nov 2018) Starting from the south, the trail begins in a parking lot located just north of the Crystal Springs Dam. The southern end of the trail is located on the east side of Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir, near the intersection of Crystal Springs Road and State Route 35, and it generally heads north parallel to the long axis (i.e. north-south) of the reservoir. The section of the trail north of reservoir passes by dense groves of trees before heading east on the San Andreas Dam. The last segment of the trail briefly parallels the eastern shore of the San Andreas Lake before the path heads northeast and ascends the Bay Hills. The path finally terminates on Hillcrest Boulevard right next to Interstate 280 in western Millbrae. Typically, more parking is available at the northern trailhead. ==History== Marker for Portola discovery site at Sweeney Ridge On November 4, 1769, Gaspar de Portola and his men camped north of here, after descending from Sweeney Ridge, where they were reputed to be the first white men to view the San Francisco Bay. Portola's camp is now beneath the waters of San Andreas Lake; a sign at the northern trail entrance on Hillcrest Boulevard points to it. In November 1774, Captain Fernando Rivera, a principal officer of Portola's, and the first to lead a group to purposely explore the Peninsula, camped near one of the Shalshone villages. It was probably in the meadow near the large laurel tree now named the Jepson Laurel. His chaplain and diarist, Father Francisco Palou, named the area San Andreas, honoring that saint's feast day. The entire valley was later granted to Domingo Feliz as part of a rancho. ===Leander Sawyer=== Leander Sawyer became active in this area soon after he purchased the land in 1853. He probably lived in a small adobe built near a natural spring in the hill, just southwest of the Jepson Laurel. Sawyer also kept an inn nearby to dispense food to picnickers, and to serve as a lodging place for horsemen traveling through the area. By 1859, Sawyer had built the house, a barn, and a fence; he raised horses and trained them for the circus. During the 1850s and 60s, Sawyer also grazed cattle in the area to keep down the brush and make a better area for incoming wagons; the area gradually became known as Sawyer Camp. No trace of Sawyer Camp remains today; a grove of eucalyptus trees marks the area where it once stood, although a nearby structure, the Sawyer Camp Cottage, was constructed in 1895 and rebuilt in 1932, to house a caretaker for the Crystal Springs Reservoir. Water tower along Sawyer Camp Trail The road along San Andreas Creek was named San Andreas Valley Road. San Andreas Valley Road, or just Valley Road, was once the main highway between San Francisco and Half Moon Bay. Wagons pulled by teams of horses hauled wood over the road. Later, the trail was used by the stagecoach from Millbrae, which connected with the San Mateo Stageline to Half Moon Bay (then known as Spanish Town). Sawyer briefly ran his own competing stagecoach line between San Mateo and Half Moon Bay. The Spring Valley Water Company purchased named the \\"Sawyer Tract\\" by 1876. After the construction of Crystal Springs Dam, which formed the Lower Crystal Springs Reservoir, the inn and much of the old road was flooded by 1888. A narrow, winding gravel access road was built along the present-day route of Sawyer Camp Trail. When the city of San Francisco took over the watershed lands, Sawyer Camp Trail was then a county road. The Water Department fenced it for the protection of San Francisco's drinking water. The mostly gravel road was open for vehicular traffic from dawn to dusk, until 1978. In 1978, the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors designated the road a non-vehicular recreation trail, and paved it for bicycles with funds provided by the State Department of Parks and Recreation. It also served many hikers, joggers, and equestrians, and is one of the most popular facilities operated by the San Mateo County Parks Department. More than 300,000 people visit Sawyer Camp Trail per year. ===The Jepson Laurel=== Jepson Laurel along Sawyer Camp Trail (2013) It is one of the most famous landmarks along Sawyer Camp Trail, and it has been established to be over 600 years old. It is now the largest Laurel in California. On April 15, 1923, this tree was named in honor of Willis Linn Jepson, one of California's most noted botanists. At that time, it measured in circumference and tall; there was only one larger Laurel known in the State. It grew along the Russian River near Cloverdale, but was cut down \\"because it shaded too much hayfield.\\" This vulnerable tree was finally fenced to protect it from soil compacting, which could conceivably weaken its roots. The San Francisco Water Department, on whose property it is located, assumed the tree's preservation and protection. In 1981, San Mateo County Parks, on permit from the Water Department, opened the area near the tree and constructed a picnic area. California Laurel (Umbellularia californica), also known as Bay Tree, Pepperwood, and Oregon Myrtle, has a wood which is heavy, hard, fine grained, and exceptionally strong. ==Recreation== Some of the most popular recreational activities on the trail include walking, jogging, and cycling. Dogs are not allowed. Much of the trail is marked with a center stripe to minimize conflict with those traveling in opposite directions and distances from the ends of the trail are indicated on posts every . Deer at Sawyer Camp Trail ==Nature== Virtually all of the trail runs alongside the scenic Crystal Springs Reservoir. It is common to see ducks, deer, and rabbits. ==References * San Mateo County Parks and Recreation: Sawyer Camp Trail * Crystal Springs Regional Trail park brochure * Bay Area Hiker: Sawyer Camp Trail * East Palo Alto Wiki: Hiking Trails in San Mateo County — with nearby trails. * Sawyer Camp Trail: Topography and Elevation Category:Protected areas of San Mateo County, California Category:Trails in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Santa Cruz Mountains Category:Transportation in San Mateo County, California ","title":"Sawyer Camp Trail"},{"id":"6201122","text":"200px Jean (Jan) Taubenhaus (born 14 December 1850, Warsaw – died 14 September 1919, Paris) was a Polish–born French chess master. ==Biography== Taubenhaus was a foremost Warsaw chess player in late 1870s. In 1880, he settled in Paris. In the 4th international Congress of the German Chess Association (DSB) at Hamburg in July 1885, he took 14th place. His best achievement was the London tournament of 1886, where he tied for 3rd-4th places together with Isidor Gunsberg, after Joseph Henry Blackburne and Amos Burn, in strong London competition. He had significant victories over Blackburne, unchallenged leader of English chess, and Gunsberg, Steinitz's opponent in later match for the world championship. In 1886, he took 6th at Nottingham. In 1887, he took 19th at Frankfurt (5th DSB Congress). In 1888, he took 8th at Bradford. In 1889, he tied for 12th–13th at New York (6th US Congress). In 1890, he took 10th at Manchester (6th BCA Congress). Living in Paris, Taubenhaus gave lessons at the Café de la Régence, where he played every day. In 1890, he took 2nd, behind Alphonse Goetz, at the Cafe. In 1892, he took 9th at the Cafe. In 1893–95, he stayed in America. In October 1893, he took 8th at New York. Then he played in Argentina and Cuba. In 1899, he played in Warsaw competition. In 1901, he took 3rd, behind Stanislaus Sittenfeld and Adolf Albin, at Paris (Quadrangular). In 1902, he took 2nd, behind Dawid Janowski, at Paris (Quadrangular). In 1902, he tied for 1st with Janowski at Paris (Pentagonal). In 1903, he tied for 10–11th at Monte Carlo. In 1905, he took 14th at Ostend. In 1905, he won at Paris. In 1906, he took 7th at Ostend (el. 2nd stage). In 1913/14, he took 14th at St Petersburg. Taubenhaus played several memorable matches. He drew with Sittenfeld (Paris, 1891); lost to Siegbert Tarrasch (Nuremberg 1891, 1892), Jacques Mieses (Glasgow, 1895), Janowski (Paris 1903, 1905), Miguel Angel Gelly (Buenos Aires, 1907), Walter Romain Lovegrove (Paris, 1912); and won against Andrés Clemente Vázquez (Havana 1894/95), Albin (Paris, 1901), Benito Villegas (Buenos Aires, 1907), Richard Teichmann (Paris, 1911). Taubenhaus is the author of Traité du Jeu d’Échecs, published in 1910. ==Mephisto== Taubenhaus was a primary operator of the remote-controlled Mephisto chess player machine. The third automaton Mephisto was made by Charles Godfrey Gumpel, and unlike its predecessors The Turk and Ajeeb, it had no hidden operator and functioned by electro-mechanical means. Gumpel took a few years to build it and it was first shown in 1876 at his Leicester Square home in London. It was the first automaton to win a chess tournament when it was entered in the Counties Chess Association at London in 1878. Mephisto was operated by Isidor Gunsberg in the main. It was shown regularly for 10 years, and at one time had its own club in the UK. When Mephisto went to the Paris Exposition in 1889 it was operated by Taubenhaus. After 1889 it was dismantled and its subsequent whereabouts are unknown. ==Notable chess games== *Johann Nepomuk Berger vs. Jean Taubhausen, Hamburg 1885, 4th DSB Congress, Ruy Lopez, Morphy Defense, Tarrasch Variation, C77, 0–1 The best game prize! *Jean Taubhausen vs. Joseph Henry Blackburne, London 1886, French Defense, Classical Variation, C14, 1–0 *Jean Taubenhaus vs. William Pollock, Nottingham 1886, King's Gambit Accepted Allgaier Gambit, Thorold Attack, C39, 1–0 *Jean Taubenhaus vs. Dawid Janowski, Paris 1903, match, Ruy Lopez, Closed, C87, ½–½ *Geza Maroczy vs Jean Taubenhaus, Monte Carlo 1903, R1 2/10, Ruy Lopez, Closed, Averbakh Variation, C87, 0–1 *Jean Taubenhaus vs. Andrey Smorodsky, Sankt Petersburg 1914, Sicilian Defense, Classical Variation, B58, 1–0 ==External links== * 201 chess games of Jean Taubenhaus * Combinations of Jean Taubenhaus Category:1850 births Category:1919 deaths Category:19th-century chess players Category:20th-century chess players Category:Polish Jews Category:French Jews Category:Polish chess players Category:French chess players Category:Jewish chess players Category:Sportspeople from Warsaw Category:Congress Poland emigrants to France ","title":"Jean Taubenhaus"},{"id":"6201125","text":"Champion is an unincorporated community in the town of Green Bay in Brown County, Wisconsin, United States.Champion, Wisconsin It is part of the Green Bay Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The origin of the song title stems from bassist Dominic Aitchison’s, the only religious member of Mogwai,Phone Interview with Stuart Braithwaite, 1999 fear of the Devil, due to his Catholic upbringing. ==Musical composition== \\"Mogwai Fear Satan\\" begins with a guitar melody riff consisting of three chords by Stuart Braithwaite and John Cummings, which is soon joined by bass played by Dominic Aitchison and a frantic drumbeat played by Martin Bulloch, which gradually fades in. The same guitar riff is repeated throughout the song, at times heavily distorted. During the quiet parts of the song, in the buildup to the explosion of sound and feedback which Mogwai are known for, there is a quiet flute melody played by Shona Brown (who was thirteen at the time of recording) over tribal-sounding drums. The song slowly fades out into feedback and noise. ==Media usage== * In 2002, a short excerpt of \\"Mogwai Fear Satan\\" was featured in \\"Eddie Kidd Rides Again\\", an episode of the documentary television program, RE:Brand, hosted by English comedian and actor, Russell Brand. * It was also featured on soundtrack for WRC 4, The Official Game of the FIA World Rally Championship on PlayStation 2. * Manic Street Preachers used the song as the intro music for their 2005 Past Present Future tour of the UK. * Repeatedly referred to in Christopher Brookmyre's book Pandaemonium where a 28-minute remix has been created by some of the schoolchildren and played at a school dance. * Part of the song was used in the 2007 documentary The 11th Hour. * A remix version of the song is used in the 2003 film All the Real Girls. ==Remixes== Mogwai Fear Satan Remixes There are five official remixes of \\"Mogwai Fear Satan\\".

Only one creation is extant as of 2008. The third Baronet of the second creation was elevated to the peerage as Baron Hanmer in 1872, a title which became extinct in 1881. The family name derived from the manor of Hanmer in the Diocese of St. Asaph. The Hanmer Baronetcy, of Hanmer in the County of Flint, was created in the Baronetage of England on 8 July 1620 for John Hanmer, subsequently Member of Parliament for Flintshire.

This trilogy is preceded by the Game, Set and Match trilogy and followed by the final Faith, Hope and Charity trilogy. Deighton's novel Winter (1987) is a prequel to the nine novels, covering the years 1900-1945 and providing the backstory to some of the characters. ==Plot summary== The novel begins with Bernard Sampson visiting his old friend and ex-SIS colleague in Washington named Jim Prettyman as part of an investigation regarding some missing funds. Soon after, Prettyman is murdered in a mugging. All his allies start losing interest in the investigation, and after digging deeper Bernard is sent to America once again, where it is revealed that Bret has not indeed died (as hinted at the end of the first trilogy, and discussed in this book.) but is in fact in rehabilitation. Bernard returns to Europe, where he confronts a man called \\"Dodo\\" and is saved from an untimely death by Prettyman, who it turns out has gone under \\"deep-cover\\". Bernard then takes his evidence to the Director General, who in a surprise turn of events orders his arrest, which thanks to some quick thinking by Werner Volkmann, Bernard evades for the while.

She was a significant founding settler in the early histories of the colonies of Maryland and Virginia.

With Anne Hutchinson, Brent ranks among the most prominent female figures in early Colonial American history. Hailed as a feminist by some in modern times in advancing rights of women under the laws, her insistent advocacy of her legal prerogatives as an unmarried gentlewoman of property, while notable in its exceptional energy, was consistent on paper with English law.The same law by which a Reigning Queen ruled the throne of England. However, in the rough, male dominated world of the colonies, her stance for her rights and her independence was unusual in actual practice and it would have been fairly uncommon back in England in that period. ==Early life and education== Born in Gloucestershire, England, Margaret Brent and her siblings were all adults when they emigrated from England.

Chilton, The Brent Family, in Genealogies of Virginia Families: From the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography (Baltimore, Genealogical Publishing Co., Inc. 1981) Vol. 1, pp. 272-273. Although Richard Brent served as the local sheriff, and the family was at least nominally part of the Church of England, their religion and political loyalty became suspect when one daughter (Catherine) proclaimed her return to the Catholic church and emigrated to Belgium. Under the religious name Christina, she ultimately became abbess of the English convent of Our Lady of Consolation in Cambrai), and was joined by two more sisters during the drawn out religious conflicts which culminated in the English Civil War.Bruce E. Steiner, \\"The Catholic Brents of Colonial Virginia: An Instance of Practical Toleration,\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 70 (1962), 392-393 and note 21.)Daniel M. French, Brent Family: the Carroll Families of Colonial Maryland (Alexandria, Va 1981) pp. 29-31 states that Brent sold Admington to Fulke, Lord Brooke circa 1625, and after his four children emigrated to Maryland in 1637-38 (and seven more relatives emigrated to Virginia), about 2/3 of the remaining estates were \\"compounded or sequestered by Parliament because of their religion\\" in 1644. In 1688, a mob attacked Richard's heir, Robert, for treasonously abetting \\"Romish Priests and Jesuits\\", and he fled to France, where he died in 1695, although his children later gained possession of some of his property and in 1715 paid fines as Catholics. French at pp. 33-34. French also states that his sisters Elizabeth and Eleanor (who took the name Helen) Brent joined Catherine (who served as abbess from 1641-45 and 1677-81) in the Low Countries by 1633. Elizabeth Brent and other Cambrai nuns established the English Convent of Our Lady of Good Hope in Paris in 1652. The only sister who definitely married and had children, Jane Brent Cassie, died in France about 1680. French disagrees with those who assert the youngest sister Anne Brent married Leonard Calvert, since his children were born ten years previously. French at p. 45. Another relative, daughter of Robert and Mary Wharton Brent, Mother Mary Margaret Brent (1731-1784) became a nun in 1778 and Prioress of the English Carmelite convent at Antwerp. Shortly after her death, four nuns (3 from Charles County Maryland) came from Europe to Port Tobacco, Maryland (part of Margaret Brent's estate in 1640) and established their religious order in America. French at pp. 83-84. ==Immigration to Maryland== Margaret, her sister Mary, and her brothers Giles Brent and Fulke Brent sailed together from England and arrived at St. Mary's, Maryland on November 22, 1638, where they hoped to improve their fortunes. In England the father's estate went to the eldest son, and the remainder of the children had to make their own ways. Margaret Brent was about 37 and unmarried. In the colony, the Brents secured large land grants and corresponding political offices due to their prestigious ancestry and/or political affiliations. Fulke Brent returned to England, but the other three stayed on in Maryland. On October 4, 1639, Margaret Brent became the first Maryland female land owner. She obtained the first recorded land grant in St. Mary's, a patent, with which she and her sister Mary established the \\"Sisters' Freehold\\", and an adjacent titled St. Andrew's. The Brent sisters had land entitlement letters from Maryland's Proprietary Governor, awarding them land portions equal in size to those of arrivals in Maryland in 1634. Their initial entitlement was enlarged to per sister. Later, Giles Brent transferred a 1,000-acre (4 km2) land tract on Kent Island, Maryland to Margaret as payment of a debt he owed his sister, although he may have continued to manage it himself. Margaret Brent also received credit or headrights for the five men and four women servants she had brought with her, and additional headrights for indentured servants she later imported (some of whose indentures she sold to other colonists). The colony's Proprietor issued headrights to encourage the gentry and sea captains to transport workers for labor in the growing colony. However, records concerning her trading or exercise of the headrights are missing, whether because lost or nonexistent, given the colony's instability. Brent became an ally of the governor, Leonard Calvert. Together they became guardians of seven-year-old Mary Kittamaquund, the daughter of a Piscataway chief, whose deathly ill son had recovered under the ministrations of Jesuit Rev. Andrew White. The colonists promised to educate the young girl in English language and culture. In 1644, Giles Brent married Mary Kittamaquund. Upon her father's death, he asserted his rights to tribal lands, contrary to both tribal custom and Governor Calvert's own claims. ==English Civil War comes to the Maryland colony== Meanwhile, by the mid-1640s, the English Civil War spilled over to Maryland. Protestant sea captain Richard Ingle raided the colony and burned down structures in early 1645. Ingle was an ally of Virginia trader William Claiborne who disputed Catholic Giles Brent's establishment of a rival trading post on Kent Island. Ingall took Acting Governor Giles Brent (who had briefly imprisoned him for high treason the previous year), and both Jesuit priests as prisoners back to England.Chilton, pp. 314-315 Governor Leonard Calvert, when he returned, recruited armed men from across the Potomac River in the nearby colony of Virginia for help against the raiders. The raiders were repulsed. However, the colony had been reduced to about 100 residents, and Calvert fell sick and died before paying the mercenaries. The dying man reportedly told his sister-in-law Margaret Brent, whom he named his executrix, \\"Take all, spend all.\\" Brent liquidated his estate to pay the soldiers who had saved the colony, which later caused a controversy with the governor's surviving brother, Lord Baltimore, leading to his ordering Brent and her family to leave the Maryland Colony. Lord Baltimore had always managed his proprietorship from England, where he worked to keep political support for the colony, as well as to prove his loyalty (as a Catholic) to the new government of Protestants. He had appointed his brother as governor and to manage his lands. During the emergency after Calvert's death, the Provincial Court on January 3, 1648 appointed Brent attorney-in- fact for Lord Baltimore, as there was no time to contact him about financial matters, and he had not appointed a successor to Calvert. She collected his rents and paid his debts. Thus, as Lord Baltimore's representative (as well as Calvert's executrix and a landowner in her own right), on January 21, 1648, Brent attended the provincial assembly, where she requested a voice in the council, as well as two votes in its proceedings (one as an independent landowner and the other as Lord Baltimore's attorney.)Archives of Maryland, I, 215 Margaret stated in her request to the Maryland General Assembly, \\"I've come to seek a voice in this assembly. And yet because I am a woman, forsooth I must stand idly by and not even have a voice in the framing of your laws.\\" Governor Thomas Greene refused her request, as the assembly at the time considered such privileges for women to be reserved for queens. Brent left but said that she \\"Protested against all proceedings ... unless she may be present and have vote as aforesaid.\\" That same day, Brent called for corn to be brought from Virginia to feed the hungry troops camped at St. Mary's. Some accounts suggest that she had spent all of Leonard Calvert's personal estate by this time, and proceeded to sell Lord Baltimore's cattle to pay the soldiers' wages, although there is disagreement among historians on this matter. English law would not permit the sale of such possessions without a court order or a special act of the legislature. But Calvert's lands and buildings were added into the inventory of his estate. Brent and then Governor William Stone also disagreed upon the act of a sale of a land tract entitled \\"The Governor's Field\\". Brent appeared at the assembly a final time as Lord Baltimore's attorney, on February 9, 1648 in a case against Thomas Cornwallis. She may have been replaced by Thomas Hatton, the new Provincial secretary. From England, Lord Baltimore wrote to the assembly objecting to the sale of any of his property after the death of his brother. He may have been suspicious of Brent's motives in managing his assets, or not realized that the colony had been in danger of extinction, had the mercenaries not been paid to leave. While the assembly had refused to give Margaret Brent a vote, it defended her stewardship of Lord Baltimore's estate, writing to him on April 21, 1649, that it \\"was better for the Colony's safety at that time in her hands than in any man's ... for the soldiers would never have treated any others with that civility and respect ...\\".James Henretta, \\"Margaret Brent: A Woman of Property\\", Early American Review, 1998, reprinted with permission from James A. Henretta, Elliot Brownlee, David Brody, Susan Ware, and Marilynn Johnson, America's History, Third Edition, Worth Publishers Inc., 1997, accessed 8 October 2011 ==Move to Virginia== Given Lord Baltimore's (and Governor Stone's) hostility to the Brent family, Giles and his young wife Mary moved to Chopawamsic Island in the Potomac River in 1649, then to Virginia's Northern Neck in 1650. The two sisters, Margaret and Mary Brent, also bought Virginia land starting in 1647, and they moved by 1650. They lived on a plantation called \\"Peace\\" in what was then Westmoreland County, Virginia.French p. 43 No records exist of her practice as an attorney in Virginia, but records do exist of her sagacious land investments, including in what during the following century became Old Town Alexandria, Virginia and Fredericksburg, Virginia, as well as George Washington's Mt. Vernon. Margaret Brent also held festive annual court leets for her people. Neither she nor her sister Mary ever married; they were among the very few unmarried English women of the time in the Chesapeake colony, when men outnumbered women there by 6:1 (but most were lower class indentured workers). Historian Lois Greene Carr believes the two sisters had taken vows of celibacy under Mary Ward's Institute in England. In 1658 Mary Brent died, leaving her entire estate of 1000 acres (4 km2) to her sister. In 1663 Margaret Brent wrote her will. In 1670 she assigned one half of her 2,000 acres (8 km2) in Maryland to her nephew, James Clifton. Most of the remainder went to her brother Giles and his children. She died at \\"Peace\\", in the newly created Stafford County, Virginia in 1671. Her will was admitted into probate on May 19, 1671. In 1687, King James II granted 30,000 acres of land in Stafford County to her great-nephew George Brent (the only Catholic ever elected to the House of Burgesses) and three London residents and specifically allowed freedom of religion to the tract's residents. Exact dates of Margaret Brent's birth and death are not known, in part because Brent family estates were burned by British raiders in the American Revolutionary War and War of 1812. Furthermore, Union troops vandalized the Brent family graveyard (on George Brent's property) during the Civil War. The remaining gravestones were documented by a WPA historian, and the property acquired and preserved by a local church.Brent Cemetery talk ==Legacy and honors== *Margaret Brent is today seen as a \\"founding mother\\" of Maryland,Jo-Ann Pilardi, Baltimore Sun, \\"Margaret Brent: a Md. founding mother\\", March 05, 1998. alongside its \\"Founding Fathers\\". *Margaret Brent continues to be cited by some scholars as a historical feminist figure, and alternately (and more commonly now) as instead a notable woman in American history who forwarded women's rights implicitly, rather than explicitly. *Margaret Brent is memorialized at Historic St. Mary's City. The museum at the former site of Maryland's colonial capital features her in exhibits and explains that she did not advocate for all women's rights, only her own right to execute Lord Baltimore's estate as he intended. The St. John's site archaeology museum, located above the exposed foundations of the house where Brent appealed to the Assembly, includes an exhibit devoted to her life. The Historic St. Mary's City grounds also include a garden dedicated in memory of Brent. *The Public Honors College, St. Mary's College of Maryland, also located in modern-day St. Mary's City, has a building named after her. It is called Margaret Brent Hall. A street on the campus is also named Margaret Brent Way. The school also maintains a scholarship and academic program for gifted and talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds called the DeSousa-Brent Scholars Program, partly named in her honor. *In 1978, Virginia erected a historical marker in Jones Point Park commemorating Mistress Margaret Brent's fight for women's rights, as well as her ownership of the land which became Alexandria, Virginia. * In 1991, the Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Award was established by the American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession recognizing and celebrating the accomplishments of women lawyers who have excelled in their field and have paved the way to success for other women lawyers. *In 1998, Virginia erected a historical highway marker commemorating Margaret, Giles and her sister Mary Brent for constructing the first Roman Catholic Settlement in Virginia, along historic Route 1 near the former Brent family graveyard. *In 2010, Virginia erected a historical highway marker (about a mile south of the 1998 religious markers) noting Margaret Brent's role as guardian for Mary Kittamaquund, who was a Native American princess of the Yaocomico (Southern Maryland) branch of the Piscataway Indian Nation. She had moved with the Brents to Virginia when they were forced from the Maryland colony by the second Lord Baltimore. *Several public schools in the state of Maryland are named for her, such as Margaret Brent Middle School. *In 2004, Stafford County, Virginia opened Margaret Brent Elementary School. *Margaret Brent was named a member of the inaugural class of Virginia Women in History in 2000. In 1985 she was one of the first group of women inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame. ==ReferencesFurther reading== *Marie Francis Bernhardt, Mistress Margaret Brent, Richmond: Catholic Women's Club, 1925. *W.

The game was developed by Produce and published by Hudson Soft in Japan, Electro Brain in North America and Gaga Interactive Media in Europe. ==Gameplay== Dual Heroes is a fighting game. In a \\"medal match\\" players can win a medal, either from an A.I. opponent or from another player. ==Story== 120 years ago, in preparation for the coming doom, mankind began an exodus to the manmade satellites in outer space. But the \\"Day of Judgment\\" arrived even before half the population had escaped to space. The shift in the tectonic plate caused the shape of the Pacific Ocean to change and a new continent was created. After 100 years, the only inhabitable areas were limited to the area around the new Pacific Ocean and the new continent. New nations were founded on this continent and mankind began rebuilding their lives. In the midst of rebuilding, \\"Gaiathyst\\" a mineral which releases an energy similar to gravity was discovered as a new source of endless energy. The nations began to war with each other for domination, but conventional weapons were found useless due to the influence of the Gaiathyst. To fight under these conditions, the power suits used to mine Gaiathyst were improved for combat. But the \\"Gaiathyst War\\" came to an abrupt end by the invading forces of the Zodgierra Empire from outer space. After conquering the nations, Emperor ZORR creates the \\"SAP\\", a super gravity producing device. Orbiting over the new continent, the super gravity of the device, prohibits beings not wearing a power suit to exist under it. Protected by the super gravity, ZORR commands his empire from a tower under the SAP. A few brave make a stand to defeat ZORR. They are the true Heroes. ==Development== Dual Heroes was developed by Produce! It was the first fighting game to use analog controls. Hudson Soft programmed multiple AIs for each character, in an effort to imitate different players controlling the character on different occasions, and thereby make the game's single- player mode more closely emulate the multiplayer fighting game experience. The game was shown at E3 1997, being 70% completed. A complete build was later shown at the 1997 Nintendo Space World. ==Reception== Dual Heroes was often mocked and criticized for its gameplay, controls and fighting mechanics, it took out the title of \\"Worst Game Ever\\" when a poll was run by an Australian Nintendo magazine Nintendo Gamer (formerly N64 Gamer). The game's poor quality was attributed in part to the poor AI, which often sent your enemy running with a devil-may-care attitude over the edge of precipices and to their deaths in chase of the player's character. A reviewer for GameSpot declared the game to be one of the worst fighting games for home consoles. One writer for Nintendo Power commented that the game did not add much to the fighting game genre. ==See also== *List of fighting games ==References * Category:1997 video games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Nintendo 64-only games Category:Produce! games Category:3D fighting games Category:Video games developed in Japan ","title":"Dual Heroes"},{"id":"6201256","text":"Certain cases heard by the Supreme Court of Canada can be decided without significant deliberation or justification.

He and his brother Edward the Confessor were sons of Æthelred's second wife Emma of Normandy.David Crouch, The Normans: The History of a Dynasty, (Hambledon Continuum, 2002), 51. King Canute became their stepfather when he married Æthelred's widow. Alfred and his brother were caught up in the power struggles at the start and end of Canute's reign. ==Siege of London== In 1013, during the siege of London by the Danes, Æthelred and his family took refuge in Normandy. Æthelred regained the throne in 1014 and died in 1016. England was conquered by Canute of Denmark later that year, and Alfred and Edward returned to the court of their uncle, Duke Richard II of Normandy. There is some evidence of a plan on the part of Duke Richard to invade England on his nephews' behalf.Stenton, F.M. Anglo-Saxon England, Oxford: Clarendon, 1943, 3rd ed. 1971, p. 409. ==Return to England== In 1035, Canute died, and during the uncertainty that followed, the heirs of the former Anglo-Saxon rulers attempted to restore the House of Wessex to the throne of England. Alfred Ætheling landed on the coast of Sussex with a Norman mercenary body guard and attempted to make his way to London. However he was betrayed, captured by Earl Godwin of Wessex, and blinded; he died soon afterwards.Britain (Narrative 1000-1300), Steven Isaac, The Oxford Encyclopedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology, Vol.1, Ed. Clifford Rogers, (Oxford University Press, 2010), 209. In the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle there is an account of this fateful encounter: When Harthacnut succeeded his half-brother Harold, he prosecuted Earl Godwin and Lyfing, Bishop of Worcester and Crediton, for the crime against his half-brother; the Bishop lost his see for a while and Godwin gave the king a warship carrying eighty fighting men as appeasement and swore that he had not wanted the prince blinded and that whatever he had done was in obedience to King Harold.Stenton, pp. 422-23. Tradition holds that like Harthacnut, Edward the Confessor considered Godwin guilty.Stenton, p. 421. The House of Wessex was restored through the accession of Alfred's brother Edward in 1042. Alfred's death was one of the main reasons for the mistrust and resentment shown by many members of Anglo-Saxon society, and particularly from Edward himself, towards Earl Godwin and his sons. ==Modern era== In 1929 the remains of 223 soldiers, whom excavators identified as Normans based on their stature, prominent skulls and slender leg bones, were found on the prominent hillside immediately west of Guildford's centre. They were bound and had been executed. The grave has been dated to 1040\\\\. Some bore skulls placed between their legs and one skeleton in particular had a neck vertebra sliced by a sword. A coin of Edward the Confessor, Alfred's brother, dating to 1043 – seven years after the mass slaying – was found at the site.\\"Anglo Saxon burial site in Guildford likely to include gruesome skeletons of Prince Alfred's massacred troops\\" 22 October 2015 Surrey Advertiser group of newspapersGuildford: Guildown Anglo-Saxon Cemetery Exploring Surrey's Past.

Micipsa became the King of Numidia in 148 BC. ==Early life== In 151 BC, Masinissa sent Micipsa and his brother Gulussa to Carthage to demand that exiled pro-Numidian politicians be allowed to return, but they were refused entry at the city gates. As the royal party turned to depart, Hamilcar the Samnite and a group of his supporters attacked Micipsa's convoy, killing some of his attendants. This incident led to a retaliatory strike on the Carthaginian town of Oroscopa that heralded the start of the Carthaginian–Numidian War and eventually precipitated the Third Punic War. ==Succession to the throne== In the spring of 148 BC Masinissa died and the tripartite division of the kingdom among the elderly king's three sons, Micipsa, Gulussa, and Mastanabal, took place by Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, to whom Masinissa had given the authority to administer his estate. Micipsa received as part of his inheritance the Numidian capital of Cirta (along with its royal palace and treasury), Gulussa the charge of war and Mastanabal the administration of justice. The sons continued their father's policy and his support of Rome during its war on Carthage. Though Micipsa wavered somewhat in his support for Rome, \\"always promising arms and money ... but always delaying and waiting to see what would happen\\".Appian, Pun., 111. In 146 BC, when Mastanabal's illegitimate son Jugurtha was fourteen years old, Carthage was destroyed by the Romans. Shortly afterwards Galussa died and later still Mastanabal, leaving Micipsa control of the entire kingdom. During Micipsa's reign Numidian cultural and commercial progress was aided when thousands of Carthaginians fled to Numidia following the Roman destruction of Carthage. He was the first to establish Iol (now Cherchell, Algeria) as the capital for the Numidian court.. Micipsa had two natural sons, Hiempsal and Adherbal, and is reported to have added his illegitimate nephew Jugurtha to his palace household. Jugurtha was treated as the king's son and received a sound military training. Micipsa continued to be a loyal ally to Rome, providing military assistance when asked. In 142 BC the Roman commander Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus wrote to Micipsa asking for a division of war elephants to help in Rome's struggle against the Lusitanian rebel Viriathus. In 134 BC Micipsa sent archers, slingers and elephants to aid Scipio Aemilianus besieging Numantia in Spain, sending Jugurtha to command the Numidian units. After the fall of Numantia, Jugurtha returned home with a letter from Scipio addressed to his uncle. In it, the commander praised Jugurtha's exploits and congratulated Micipsa for having \\"a kinsman worthy of yourself, and of his grandfather Masinissa\\".Sallust, Iug., 9. On this recommendation the king formally adopted Jugurtha and made him co-heir with his own children. ==Death== In 118 BC, Micipsa died and, following the king's wish, Numidia was divided into three parts which were ruled by Adherbal, Hiempsal and Jugurtha. ==References== Category:118 BC deaths Category:2nd- century BC rulers in Africa Category:2nd-century BC Berber people Category:Foreign relations of ancient Rome Category:Kings of Numidia Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Micipsa"},{"id":"6201433","text":"Su Lin in 2006 Su Lin () is a female giant panda born at the San Diego Zoo on August 2, 2005.

Also known as Nicolas Clément-Desormes, he was born in Dijon. He was a colleague of Charles Desormes, with whom he conducted the Clément- Desormes experiment. The two chemists are also credited with determining an accurate value of gamma in the gas law (see Equation of state) that relates the heat capacity of air when expanded at constant pressure vs. constant temperature. They also conducted research on iodine and played a role in determining that it was an element. This research eventually led others to invent the process of photography, and Clément-Desormes is recognized as a contributor in the early history of that industry. Among their accomplishments was establishing a value for absolute zero. ==Marriage== Clément married Desormes' daughter and adopted the family surname as Clément-Desormes. ==Career== Professor Clément held one of the first chairs in chemistry at the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers in Paris. He taught a course in industrial chemistry that emphasized the thermodynamics of steam in relation to powering steam engines. In about 1819, he befriended Sadi Carnot, and the two men developed methods for calculating the maximum amount of energy that could be obtained from a kg of coal. Clément and Carnot clearly understood the concept of a Mechanical equivalent of heat, and developed formulae for calculating energy efficiency almost 20 years before Mayer and Joule's work on this subject in the 1840s. Evidence concerning the connection between Clément and Carnot is summarized in a book by the historian, Robert Fox.Fox, R. Reflexions on the Motive Power of Fire, A Critical Edition. Manchester University Press, 1986. and in an article on the history of the calorie. Clément was the first man known to define and utilize the Calorie as a unit of heat. The definition was published in the journal, Le Producteur, in 1824. His calorie was a kg- calorie (modern kcal), and his definition entered French dictionaries as early as 1842. One of his lasting influences was to help the calorie enter the international lexicon. It was defined as heating a kg of water by 1 degree C until about 1929, but was superseded when a committee of the British Academy of Sciences proposed the g-calorie as an alternate unit of energy (with the newly defined joule taking precedence). This marked the beginning of \\"calorie confusion\\" because the kilocalorie had to be introduced as a unit in the m-kg-s system. Thus, the reason that U.S. food labels describe food energy in calories can be traced to Nicolas Clément-Desormes' lectures of 1819-1824. Clément-Desormes was a successful young industrialist who was owner or partner in several chemical companies, including one that made sugar from beets. He was sought after as an industrial consultant. Some speculate that his sudden death was brought on by a business disagreement concerning payments that were owed to him for successful introduction of a profitable process. ==ReferencesSee also== *Gas laws *Iodine *Calorie *:Category:Thermodynamics Category:19th-century physicists Category:French physicists Category:19th-century chemists Category:French chemists Category:1779 births Category:1841 deaths Category:People from Dijon Category:Burials at Père Lachaise Cemetery Category:Fluid dynamicists ","title":"Nicolas Clément"},{"id":"6201613","text":"Clint Miller 1 (born April 29, 1962 in Pomona, CaliforniaKuwahara trading card made by Dunruss in 1985 U.S.) is a former American \\"Old School\\" professional Bicycle Motocross (BMX) racer whose prime competitive years were from 1976–1984.

Bernard Nieuwentijt, Nieuwentijdt, or Nieuwentyt (10 August 1654, West-Graftdijk, North Holland - 30 May 1718, Purmerend) was a Dutch philosopher, mathematician, physician, magistrate, mayor (of Purmerend), and theologian. ==Career== As a philosopher, Nieuwentyt was a follower of Descartes and an opponent of Spinoza. In 1695 he was involved in a controversy over the foundations of infinitesimal calculus with Leibniz. Nieuwentijt advocated 'nilsquare' infinitesimals (which have higher powers of zero), whereas Leibniz was uncertain about explicitly adopting such a rule - they did however come to be used throughout physics from then on. He wrote several books (in Dutch) including his chief work Het regt gebruik der werelt beschouwingen, ter overtuiginge van ongodisten en ongelovigen [The True Use of Contemplating the World] (1715), which argued for the existence of God and attacked Spinoza.Jonathan Israel, Enlightenment Contested, p. 385-6 It went through several editions (1715, 1717, 1720, 1725, 1730, 1740) published by Joannes Pauli, and was translated into English as The religious philosopher, or the right use of contemplating the works of the Creator (1718) and into French as De l'existence de Dieu démontrée par les merveilles de la nature, ou traité téléologique dirigé contre la doctrine de Spinoza par un médecin hollandais. Voltaire owned a copy of this book, and it was an influence on William Paley, to the extent that in 1859 Robert Blakey could make \\"a detailed argument for plagiarism\\" by Paley.

At the same time the novel provides an historical background to several of the characters in Deighton's nine novels about the British intelligence agent Bernard Samson, who grew up in the ruins of Berlin after the Second World War. ==Plot summary== The narrative starts on the eve of the year 1900 with Harald Winter, a German businessman with two sons, Peter and Paul, two very different brothers, whose lives are inextricably linked with Germany in the years leading up to the Second World War. One a scholar and one a romantic, their lives diverge, leading one into the inner mechanisms of the Nazi Party and one into exile in America, the birthplace of their mother. From their sheltered childhood through their violent coming of age in the Great War, from the chaos of 1920s Berlin to the spreading power of Hitler they are wrenched apart by conflicting ideals and ambitions. Their story is further complicated by their father's long standing affair with a Hungarian woman, eventually revealed to be Jewish; their love for him is overshadowed by their loathing of his behaviour. Since the entire story unfolds as a flashback from the time of the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials after the Nazis' defeat, the readers know that both would make a career as lawyers, but in widely divergent directions: one would enter the Nazi Party and think up various \\"legal\\" ways to legitimise their crimes, while the other brother would be a staunch anti- Nazi, go into exile and come back to Germany after the war as a member of the American war crimes prosecution. But the reader cannot be sure, until deep in the book's plot, which is which. ==Context== For readers of Len Deighton's three trilogies about the MI6 operative Bernard Samson (Berlin Game, Mexico Set and London Match; Spy Hook, Spy Line, and Spy Sinker; and Faith, Hope and Charity), this is the story that started it all. The novel provides the historical background to several of the characters in the nine novels. It does this by introducing the reader to a minor character at least in this novel – who is a British intelligence agent, a character which recurs in different guises throughout the novel, including, for a brief period in the 1920s. This character, we learn, is Brian Samson, Bernard's father. It is also made clear that Brian Samson loathed the Nazis; his conflicted relationship with Germany is a recurring theme through the Bernard Samson novels. A further contrast is supplied through the use of Brian's social displacement as a working class man operating in the rarified atmosphere of the world of pre-war and wartime espionage. This is echoed in Bernard, who makes frequent reflections about his lack of University education in comparison to both his peers and his wife. The book contains an atmospheric description of a Zeppelin raid on London. ==Reception== Winter received favourable reviews, with critics describing it as \\"a masterful portrayal of the German Zeitgeist of almost half a century\\" and that it \\"makes comprehensible the awful appeal of Nazism to people of different persuasions\\". ==References== Category:1987 British novels Category:Bernard Samson novels Category:Novels set in Berlin Category:Hutchinson (publisher) books ","title":"Winter (Deighton novel)"},{"id":"6201699","text":"Alsophila imrayana, synonym Cyathea imrayana, is a species of tree fern native to Dominica, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, and Ecuador.

Competition rules limit equipment to a laptop computer and an external pointing device (mouse). Some competitions allow external hardware, usually a single MIDI controller (this set-up is very similar to those used for live PA). There are typically three or four rounds, following a single elimination bracket or similar structure. Each round consists of a number of head-to-head matches between two randomly selected participants. Rules vary, but typically the competitors are allowed two to three minutes on stage to play their individual compositions. Stage presence is often a key element for judging, in addition to technical finesse and an ability to engage the audience. A panel of judges decide which contestant advances to the next round, single elimination style. Usually, there are no restrictions on the type of material performed other than it must be the competitor's original creation. This aids in providing a distinction from DJ battles, wherein competitors play music created by others. Musical genres vary widely, with tendencies towards intelligent dance music, glitch, experimental electronica, mashups, house and technoid. Various local and national laptop battles have garnered the attention of electronic music and sound design production sponsors, such as Ableton, Mackie, and Native Instruments. Sponsor products are often included in competition prizes. Laptop battles are becoming a worldwide phenomenon with battles organized in Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, New Zealand, and Italy. == Formats == All formats vary in length of rounds (usually 2–3 minutes) and competition bracket style (single or double elimination). Some battles also include alternating sets by each performer, such as two 2-minute sets each. Mouse and keyboard rules may vary as well, and sometimes will allow for a USB version of the peripheral if the on-board peripheral is disabled or unused on the laptop. ===Laptop only=== This format was used in the 2006 Atlanta Laptop Battle I, II, and III. This format only allows the following equipment: *One laptop *One external sound card ===Single MIDI controller=== This format was used for the 2006 US National Finals, the 2006 Atlanta Laptop Battle Finals, and the Laptop Battle UK competitions.

It involves two competitors not included in the single- or double-elimination tournament structure, and may include more experienced performers or the judges from the ongoing laptop battle. This format is unique in that the actual sonic material utilized in the battle is limited, and performers have a limited amount of time to create their pieces. This format has the following restrictions: *One laptop computer *One external sound card *One MIDI controller *All equipment must fit in a 2' x 2' square *Preparation is limited to a specific window of time before the match *Source material is limited to supplied samples, which are not available to the performers until the preparation window ==See also== *Laptronica *Computer music *Battle of the Bands == References  * WORLD-FAMOUS LAPTOP BATTLE™ LAPTOPBATTLE.ORG - #1 (since 2003) * http://www.laptopbattle.com/ - #2 (since 2007) * http://www.fourthcity.net/ - Seattle-based artist collective that created the Laptop Battle * https://web.archive.org/web/20080519111616/http://www.nophi.net/laptopbattle/ - Atlanta Laptop Battle Series (2006-2007) * http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A142317 - Write- up of the Atlanta Laptop Battle Finals * https://web.archive.org/web/20090803194232/http://laptopbattlenyc.com/ - NYC Laptop Battle * https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2006/10/02/computer-nerds- find-their-niche-sort-of/ - Rolling Stone Rock and Roll Daily article about the first-ever NYC laptop battle * http://www.laptopbattle.org/videos.php - Laptop Battle Video Archive * http://www.laptopbattle.de/ - Munich/Germany (since 2005) * http://www.laptopbattle-mannheim.de/ - Mannheim/Germany (since 2006) * https://web.archive.org/web/20070821145214/http://www.laptopbattle- stuttgart.de/ - Stuttgart/Germany (since 2007) * http://www.laptopbattle- dresden.de/ - Dresden/Germany (since 2009) * https://web.archive.org/web/20070613182738/http://www.laptopbattle.jp/ - Tokyo (since 2007) * https://web.archive.org/web/20071215214238/http://www.laptopbattleuk.com/ - Bristol/UK (since 2006) * http://www.myspace.com/laptopbattleuk/ - UK (since 2006) Category:Music competitions ","title":"Laptop battle"},{"id":"6201826","text":"Peter James Daltrey (born 25 March 1946 in Bow, East London, England) is an English musician. He has been the lead singer and chief songwriter for the bands Kaleidoscope and Fairfield Parlour. He is also a solo artist. ==Biography== After the demise of the bands, Kaleidoscope and Fairfield Parlour, Daltrey concentrated on his solo recording projects. His first album, Dream On (Voiceprint VP182), was released on the British Voiceprint label in 1995, followed by two albums released in Japan: English Roses (Evangel EV001-1995) and When We Were Indians (Evangel EV003 - 1996). In 1997, Daltrey worked with Universal Records on the compilation album, Dive into Yesterday (Fontana 534003-02), a collection of tracks from Kaleidoscope's two 1960s albums. The band re-emerged from obscurity with reissues of their albums, beginning in 1987; their \\"lost\\" double concept album, White Faced Lady (UFO BFTP 001) was released in 1991. In 1997 Daltrey was invited by the Dutch composer and instrumentalist Arjen Anthony Lucassen (Ayreon) to work with him on his double concept album, Into the Electric Castle. He also contributed two titles on the album (Transmission TM-014 International 1998). In 2004, he appeared shortly on the Ayreon album The Human Equation, reprising his role from Into the Electric Castle, and the following year sang on the re-release of Ayreon's first album, The Final Experiment, providing lead vocals for an acoustic version of \\"Nature's Dance\\". A fan of Clifford T. Ward, Daltrey was guest of honour at an October 1998 convention where he delivered a speech of appreciation. Blueprint Records released a collection of Daltrey's best solo work in 1999 on Candy: The Best of Peter Daltrey (Blueprint BP304CD.) The turn of the century saw the release of Daltrey's album, Tambourine Days (Chelsea Records CDCR 000110) with the title track looking back at his earlier career, and the many friends who had shared that long frustrating road.

This was followed by two more solo albums, Heroine (Chelsea Records CDCR 100110) in 2001 and The Last Detail (Chelsea Records CDCR 209010) in September 2002. The collaboration with Youth continued in November 2002 with the release of their second album, Tattoo (Chelsea Records CDCR 201110). Two months later Daltrey's first solo single was released on Earworm Records, \\"(Love Song) For Annie\\" / \\"Gypsy Gypsy\\" (with Damien Youth) (Earworm Records). In April 2003, after the discovery of some rare Kaleidoscope acetate discs the band authorised their release, Kaleidoscope - The Sidekicks Sessions (CD Alchemy). In September BBC recordings were released, Please Listen to the Pictures (Circle Records CPWL/CPWC 104), its cover art featuring many photographs and clippings from Daltrey's extensive band archive. The following month he released Pittsburg Warhola (Chelsea Records CDCR 300110) under the nom de plume Link Bekka. He and Youth then formed The Morning Set band, and released their first album, The Morning Set, at the end of 2006. In 2007, Link Bekka, released two more albums: The Madness of King Bekka (Chelsea Records CDCR 707010) and Saharaville (Chelsea Records CDCR 709010).

In the early 1990s, in response to charges that the mascot was offensive to Native Americans, the first changes were undertaken. The real-life mascot, who dressed up as a stereotypical 'Indian' (complete with mohawk) for football games, was discontinued and a panel for the improvement of Native American cultural education was set up. Braves logo In 2004, the school's mascot came under fire again, with opponents of the name being organized by an Eastern Michigan University professor. The School Board set up a committee in the fall of 2005 to look into the issue. After a series of open public meetings, the committee returned a report concluding that due to systemic discrimination, the mascot must indeed be changed. However, the committee was the subject of questions itself, with allegations that the group splintered, and none of the public forums gathered much student input. The School Board, while going over the committee's report, scheduled a final public meeting to be held in April 2006. Garnering a large turnout, the event was held in the school's auditorium, with support for the name generally coming from the student body and the community and opponents coming from academia and the Native American community.

Set in London before World War I, it depicts a family defending the honour of its young son at all cost. The screenplay was adapted by Mamet based on Terence Rattigan's 1946 dramatic play The Winslow Boy. It was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival. ==Plot== It is Christmas 1911 and Arthur Winslow, a London banker, is making final preparations for a dinner to seal the engagement between his daughter Catherine, an outspoken supporter of the cause of women's suffrage, and Captain John Watherstone. The family and guests are toasting the upcoming marriage when Arthur discovers that his youngest son Ronnie, a 13-year-old cadet at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, is unexpectedly home. Ronnie has been accused of the theft of a postal order. An internal enquiry, conducted without notice to his family and without benefit of representation, finds him guilty and Mr. Winslow is \\"requested to withdraw\\" his son from the college (the formula of the day for expulsion). Ronnie proclaims his innocence and his father believes him—enough so that he demands an apology from the College. When the college refuses to reinstate Ronnie, Arthur decides to take the matter to court. With the help of his daughter and Desmond Curry, a solicitor and friend of the family, Mr. Winslow decides to hire the most highly sought after barrister in England at the time, Sir Robert Morton, known also to be a shrewd opposition Member of Parliament. The government is unwilling to allow the case to proceed. The Naval College is a representative of the Admiralty and the Crown, and as such British law presumes they are infallible and above question; their judgment can be legally questioned only with the permission of the Attorney General. However, after heated debates in the House of Commons, the government yields, and the case does come to court. Catherine had expected Sir Robert to decline the case, or at best to treat it as a political tool; instead, he is coolly matter-of-fact about having been persuaded of Ronnie's innocence by his responses to questioning (in fact, a form of cross- examination, to see how young Ronnie would hold up in court) in the presence of his family. Catherine is not enthusiastic about Morton, whom she considers cold and heartless. Catherine is also disturbed by Sir Robert's establishment views: he is a conservative opponent of women’s suffrage. \\"He always speaks out against what is right,\\" she observes to her father, though she admires his legal skills. Morton, for his part, obviously is quite taken with Catherine from the moment he meets her in his offices; later he stares at her as she arrives at the House of Commons and as she watches the proceedings from the ladies' gallery. In the meantime, the case creates media hysteria and puts a heavy toll on the Winslow family – their funds are rapidly depleted in order to cover legal expenses. Mr. Winslow's physical health deteriorates under the strain and the happiness of the Winslows' home is destroyed. Arthur's wife, Grace, begins to wonder if the real issue is justice or a father's stubborn and foolish pride. Forced to make economical sacrifices, Grace Winslow is unwilling to take the drastic measure of dismissing Violet, who has been the family’s maid for over twenty years. The eldest son, Dickie Winslow, has to leave Oxford due to the lack of money destroying his chance at a career in the Civil Service. Instead, he is compelled to find employment in his father’s bank. Catherine's marriage settlement is also gone. Her fiancé John Watherstone breaks off the engagement in the face of opposition from his father (an Army Colonel), forcing her to consider a sincere and well- intentioned offer of marriage from Desmond, whom she does not love. Sir Robert has also declined appointment as Lord Chief Justice, rather than drop the case. The least affected is Ronnie, who happily has been transferred to a new school. At trial, Sir Robert, working together with Desmond Curry and his firm, is able to discredit much of the supposed evidence. The Admiralty, certainly embarrassed and presumably no longer confident of Ronnie's guilt, abruptly withdraws all charges against him, proclaiming the boy entirely innocent. When their resounding victory arrives, not a single member of the Winslow family is present at court. It is Violet, the maid, who tells Mr. Winslow and Catherine what has happened at court. Shortly after, Sir Robert appears in the Winslows’ home to share the good news. The film ends with a suggestion that romance might yet blossom between Sir Robert and Catherine, who acknowledges that she had misjudged him all along. ==Cast== * Nigel Hawthorne - Arthur Winslow * Rebecca Pidgeon - Catherine Winslow * Jeremy Northam - Sir Robert Morton * Guy Edwards - Ronnie Winslow * Gemma Jones - Grace Winslow * Matthew Pidgeon - Dickie Winslow * Aden Gillett - John Watherstone * Colin Stinton - Desmond Curry * Sarah Flind - Violet * Neil North - First Lord ==Production== Shot in London, the film was directed by David Mamet who originally had thought of making a theatrical production of Rattigan's dramatic play, which had been previously filmed in 1948. After failing to find backers for the project, Mamet decided to adapt the play for the big screen. It was produced by Sarah Green with Sally French, Michael Barker and Tom Bernard as associate producers. The screenplay was adapted by Mamet based on Rattigan's play. The music score was by Alaric Jans and the cinematography by Benoît Delhomme. Neil North who played the title role in the 1948 version also appears in this version (as the First Lord of the Admiralty). In the audio commentary for the DVD release, Mamet says he had already cast North in the film before he was told that North also appeared in the 1948 version. In the DVD commentary, Jeremy Northam claims that film director Mike Newell originated the role of Ronnie Winslow in the original stage production. However, this is mistaken; Northam has confused another actor who is also named Michael Newell, who is now a real-estate agent. Mike Newell (the director) was born in 1942, and since the play premiered in 1946, it is not possible for a four-year-old to have played that role. Rebecca Pidgeon, who plays Catherine, is the wife of playwright and director David Mamet. Matthew Pidgeon, who plays Dickie Winslow (Catherine's brother), is Rebecca Pidgeon's real-life brother. ==Overview== Set against the strict codes of conduct and manners of the age, The Winslow Boy is based on a father's fight to clear his son's name after the boy is expelled from Osborne Naval College for stealing a postal order. To clear the boy's name was imperative for the family's honour; had they not done so, they would have been shunned by their peers and society. The boy's life would have been wrecked by the stain on his character. The play was inspired by an actual event, which set a legal precedent; the case of George Archer-Shee, a cadet at Osborne in 1908, who was accused of stealing a postal order from a fellow cadet. His elder brother Major Martin Archer-Shee, was convinced of his innocence, and persuaded his father (also called Martin) to engage lawyers. The most respected barrister of the day, Sir Edward Carson was also persuaded of his innocence, and insisted on the case going to court. On the fourth day of the trial, the Solicitor General accepted that Archer-Shee was innocent, and ultimately the family was paid compensation. ==Awards== *Winner Best British Performance (Jeremy Northam) - Edinburgh International Film Festival *Winner British Actor of the Year (Jeremy Northam) -The London Film Critics' Circle == DVD release == The film was released on DVD in the United States in February 2000. The special features include an audio commentary by director/screenwriter David Mamet and cast members, Jeremy Northam, Nigel Hawthorne and Rebecca Pidgeon. The DVD also includes theatrical trailers for The Winslow Boy and The Spanish Prisoner.

Bibliotheca selecta (full title Bibliotheca selecta de ratione studiorum in Historia, In Disciplinis, in salute omnium procuranda) is a bibliographical encyclopedia by the Jesuit Antonio Possevino, printed in two folio volumes at the Typographia Apostolica Vaticana by Domenico Basa in 1593. It represents an authoritative and up-to-date Jesuit compendium of Counter-Reformation knowledge. ==Part I== Part I (Books 1-11) is dedicated to pope Clement VIII with the imprimatur of Jesuit general Claudio Acquaviva. It begins with an introduction that traces the Idea et causae operis (Idea and the cause of work) to the 1560s in France when as a Jesuit superior Possevino started fighting the anti-heretical battle of the books. From Lyons and Avignon he had seen the challenge to the orthodoxy of Rome and the Council of Trent represented by Konrad Gesner's Bibliotheca universalis, the ground- breaking encyclopedia expressing the Erasmian culture of Swiss and German Reformers, a work immediately banned by church censors. To begin, Possevino discourses on the principles of Jesuit humanist pedagogy enunciated in the Ratio studiorum in a preliminary section, Cultura ingeniorum. This part, as several others, went through several separate editions (Cologne, 1610) and an Italian translation by Possevino.Coltura de gl'ingegni, nella quale con molta dottrina, & guiditio si mostrano i doni che ne gl'ingegni dell'huomo ha posto Iddio, La varieta et inclinatione loro e di dove nasce e come si conosca, li modo ed i mezzi d'essercitarli per le discipline, li remedi agl'impedimenti, li coleggi e l'universita, l'uso de' buoni libri e la correttione de' cattivi (Vicenza: Greco, 1598) Among these was an edition dedicated to the Russian False Dmitriy I.(Treviso, 1606) Luigi Balsamo, Bibliography: History of a Tradition Trans. W, Pettas, (Berkeley, 1990)IV: The Bibliographic Canons of the Sixteenth Century: From Bibliotheca Universalis to Bibliotheca selecta p. 40. The theological presentation of the several books outlines a comprehensive bibliography on theology, scholastic, catechetical and controversial, and incorporates works by such contemporary Jesuit missionaries as Alessandro Valignano and Edmund Campion. ==Part II== Part II is dedicated to king Sigismund III Vasa of Poland, one of the contemporary rulers under Possevino's Counter Reformation tutelage. From Books 12 through 18 he summarizes the literature and bibliography for law {12}, philosophy {13} and medicine (14). Possevino is creating an authorized bibliography of the traditional arts and sciences elaborating the humanistic educational precepts of the Jesuit Ratio Studiorum. The liberal arts are dealt with in the final books on architecture and geography {15}, history {16} poetry & painting {17} and rhetoric {18}. The major thrust of Possevino's orthodox compendium is the creation of a bibliography of the humanist culture of the Late Renaissance that is both confidently encyclopedic and outspokenly anti-heretical. The criterion of orthodoxy is underscored in his previous Iudicium de Nuae, Iohannis Bodini, Philippe-Mornaei et Machiavelli scriptis, 1592, which placed the works of leading writers such as Niccolò Machiavelli and Jean Bodin on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum. In addition to two revised folio editions of the Bibliotheca selecta printed in Venice, 1603 and Cologne, 1607, several books were reprinted in separate editions, notably Book 16, as Apparatus ad omnium gentium historiam,(Venice: Ciotti, 1597) and in Italian as Apparato all'historia di tutte le nationi (Venice: Ciotti, 1598) and as De Apparatu ad omnium gentium historiam (Venice: Ciotti, 1602), the revised edition integrated in the Venetian Bibliotheca selecta of 1603, a thorough bibliography of the ancient and contemporary literature of world history reworking, expurgating and updating Bodin's Methodus ad facilem historiarum cognitionem(1566). Book 18 was published separately as a rhetorical treatise, Cicero collatus cum Etnicis et sacris scriptoribus.(Padua: apud Paulum Meietum, 1593) Also, (Cologne: Birkmann, 1593) ==References * Bibliotheca selecta In Historia Category:1593 books Category:Christian bibliographies Category:Christian encyclopedias Category:Reference works in the public domain Category:16th-century Latin books Category:16th-century encyclopedias ","title":"Bibliotheca selecta"},{"id":"6201885","text":"Nikephoros Dokeianos (, ; died 1040) was the catepan of Italy from 1039 until 1040.

It was made by De Grunwald Productions and distributed by the British Lion Film Corporation. It was directed by Anthony Asquith and produced by Anatole de Grunwald with Teddy Baird as associate producer. The adapted screenplay was written by de Grunwald and Rattigan based on Rattigan's play. The music score was by William Alwyn and the cinematography by Freddie Young. The film stars Robert Donat, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Margaret Leighton with Basil Radford, Kathleen Harrison, Francis L. Sullivan, Marie Lohr and Jack Watling (who was also in the original West End theatre production). Also in the cast are Stanley Holloway, Mona Washbourne, Ernest Thesiger, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Lewis Casson, Cyril Ritchard and Dandy Nichols. Neil North, who plays the title role, also appeared in the 1999 film adaptation directed by David Mamet. ==Background== Set against the strict codes of conduct and manners of the age, The Winslow Boy is based on a father's fight to clear his son's name. The boy (Ronnie) is expelled from Osborne Naval College for supposedly stealing a five-shilling postal order, without receiving a fair trial. His father (Arthur) and sister (Catherine) lead a long running legal battle, that takes them as far as the House of Commons. The play focuses on a refusal to back down in the face of injustice – the entire Winslow family, and the barrister who represents them (Sir Robert Morton), make great sacrifices in order that right be done. The play was inspired by an actual event, which set a legal precedent; the case of George Archer-Shee, a cadet at Osborne in 1908, who was accused of stealing a postal order from a fellow cadet. His elder brother, Major Martin Archer-Shee, was convinced of his innocence, and persuaded his father (also called Martin) to engage lawyers. The most respected barrister of the day, Sir Edward Carson, was also persuaded of his innocence, and insisted on the case coming to court. On the fourth day of the trial, the Solicitor General accepted that Archer-Shee was innocent, and ultimately the family was paid compensation. George Archer-Shee died in the First World War and his name is inscribed on the war memorial in the village of Woodchester in Gloucestershire, where his parents lived. There is no real- world counterpart to the character of Catherine, although she is central to the plot of the play and films. ==Plot== Arthur Winslow goes home from his job at the bank after 46 years, retiring because of arthritis. He has a normal domestic life for a middle-class family: his eldest son is at Oxford University is daughter is a non-militant suffragette, and his youngest son is starting as a naval cadet. The next door neighbour, John, asks for his daughter's hand in marriage. Ronnie Winslow (Neil North), a cadet at the Royal Naval College, appears unexpectedly back home, soaking wet. He has a letter for his father from the college which he is too scared to give him. He is accused of the theft of a postal order for five shillings (£0.25). An internal enquiry which grants him no chance of defence, finds him guilty and his father, Arthur Winslow (Sir Cedric Hardwicke), is requested to remove his son from the college. Unwilling to accept the verdict, Winslow and his daughter Catherine institute their own enquiries and engage a friend and family solicitor, Desmond Curry (Basil Radford) to assist them, including the briefing of the best barrister in England at the time, Sir Robert Morton (Robert Donat), should the case come to court. The father takes the matter to his MP, who raises it at the House of Commons under the issue within the Magna Carta that no subject of the country may be condemned without trial. He hires Sir Robert Morton to take the case. When the solicitor's bill reaches £634, well beyond his overdraft limit, the father is advised to cut his losses and abandon the case. He tells the eldest son that he is taking him out of Oxford to cut his expenses and will find him a job at the bank instead. After aggressively interrogating Ronnie over discrepancies in his recollection and his habit of copying his friend's signature (which purportedly could have been used to steal the postal order), Sir Robert is convinced Ronnie is innocent and agrees to take the case. The government is unwilling to allow the case to proceed but yields after heated debates in the House of Commons, and the case does come to court. Morton is able to discredit much of the supposed evidence, and the government finally withdraws the charges against Ronnie. Although the family wins the case, each of them has lost something along the way: Dickie Winslow (Jack Watling) has been forced to leave Oxford out of lack of money, Catherine (Margaret Leighton) loses her marriage settlement and subsequently her fiancé, John Weatherstone (Frank Lawton), and Arthur Winslow loses his health. ==Cast== * Robert Donat as Sir Robert Morton * Cedric Hardwicke as Arthur Winslow * Basil Radford as Desmond Curry * Margaret Leighton as Catherine Winslow * Kathleen Harrison as Violet * Francis L.

The Archer-Shee case took place in 1908, while the film is set in 1912, just prior to World War I. ==ReceptionBox office=== The Winslow Boy was one of the most popular films at the British box office in 1948. According to Kinematograph Weekly the 'biggest winner' at the box office in 1948 Britain was The Best Years of Our Lives with Spring in Park Lane being the best British film and \\"runners up\\" being It Always Rains on Sunday, My Brother Jonathan, Road to Rio, Miranda, An Ideal Husband, Naked City, The Red Shoes, Green Dolphin Street, Forever Amber, Life with Father, The Weaker Sex, Oliver Twist, The Fallen Idol and The Winslow Boy. ===Awards=== The picture was nominated for the BAFTA UN award for 1949. ===Critical=== Writing in The New York Times however, Bosley Crowther compared the film unfavourably to the play, \\"staged with superlative finish on Broadway two seasons ago,\\" but praised the \\"sparkling performance\\" of Robert Donat, and concluded, that despite these reservations, \\"the screen has a striking and an inspiring picture in 'The Winslow Boy'\\";https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E03E5DF123DE03BBC4F53DFB066838B649EDE The Monthly Film Bulletin noted, \\"It is very much a period piece, in which the middle class, with its comforts, its unlovely interiors and hideous clothes, is very much in evidence. It is too long, and would benefit by judicious cutting,\\" although the reviewer concluded, \\"This is quite definitely a film to see and enjoy\\"; while more recently, Dennis Schwartz found the film to be \\"directed with great care for feeling and detail (the period settings are superb) by Anthony Asquith,\\" and that it \\"proves to be excellent middle-class entertainment,\\" and concluded by singling out Donat, \\"superb as the witty and elegant lawyer, who also has grit and compassion.\\" ==References*The Winslow Boy at BFI Screenonline Category:1948 films Category:1948 drama films Category:English-language films Category:British films Category:British drama films Category:British legal films Category:British courtroom films Category:British black-and-white films Category:London Films films Category:Films based on actual events Category:British films based on plays Category:Films based on works by Terence Rattigan Category:Films directed by Anthony Asquith Category:Films set in the 1900s Category:Films with screenplays by Terence Rattigan Category:Films with screenplays by Anatole de Grunwald Category:Films produced by Anatole de Grunwald Category:Films scored by William Alwyn ","title":"The Winslow Boy (1948 film)"},{"id":"6201901","text":"The Epiphone Casino is a thinline hollow body electric guitar manufactured by Epiphone, a branch of Gibson. The guitar debuted in 1961 and has been associated with such guitarists as Howlin' Wolf, George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Keith Richards, Dave Davies, Paul Weller, The Edge, Joshua Homme, Daniel Kessler, Noel Gallagher, Brendon Urie, Gary Clark, Jr., Glenn Frey, John Illsley, Peter Green and Dave Grohl. Casinos have been manufactured in the United States, Japan, Korea and China. == Construction == The Casino, also designated by Epiphone as model E230TD, is a thinline hollow-bodied guitar with two Gibson P-90 pick-ups. Although generally fitted with a trapeze-type tailpiece, often a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece is used in its place (either as a factory direct feature or as an aftermarket upgrade). Unlike semi-hollow body guitars such as the Gibson ES-335, which have a center block to promote sustain and reduce feedback, the Casino and its cousin, the Gibson ES-330 are true hollow-bodied guitars. This makes it lighter, and louder when played without an amplifier, but much more prone to feedback than semi-hollow or solid-body electrics. Early versions of the Casino had a spruce top. Through 1970, the Casino headstock was set at a 17-degree angle and the top was made of five laminated layers of maple, birch, maple, birch, and maple. With the exception of the John Lennon models, subsequent Casinos have been made with 14-degree headstock angle with five layer all maple laminated tops. Current versions have a laminated maple top, sides, and back, and a mahogany neck. == Factory string gauge guide for Casino == Per the Epiphone String Gauge Guide, the Casino comes with string gauges (from high to low): 0.010\\" 0.013\\" 0.017\\" 0.026\\" 0.036\\" 0.046\\". == Use by the Beatles == Paul McCartney playing a Casino at Live 8, 2005. In 1964, Paul McCartney, The Beatles' bass player, was the first Beatle to acquire a Casino (a 1962 model), using it for his studio forays into guitar work, including his guitar solos on \\"Ticket to Ride\\" (1965), \\"Drive My Car\\" (1965) and \\"Taxman\\" (1966). In 1965 John Lennon and George Harrison bought 1965 Casinos, which are clearly seen in photos of Japan concerts (last World Tour, 1966). John Lennon used the Epiphone Casino as his main instrument during the remainder of his time with the Beatles. In 1968 when the Beatles were making the White Album, Lennon had the pick guard removed from his Casino and professionally sanded to bare wood and lightly lacquered with two thin coats of nitro-cellulose. In the early seventies, the original tuners were replaced with a set of gold Grover tuners or machine heads. His stripped guitar (still with the original nickel tuners) is first seen in the \\"Revolution\\" promo film. The guitar was used at The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus in December 1968, the Apple rooftop concert on January 30, 1969, and the concert of Live Peace in Toronto 1969 with the Plastic Ono Band on September 13, 1969. It can also be seen in the Let It Be film, including the rooftop concert, and most other pictures of Lennon playing guitar after that time. Harrison had his fitted with a Bigsby trem, removed the pickguard (it can be seen in this state in the \\"Hello Goodbye\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" videos, and in pictures of the final Beatles show in San Francisco, 1966). He also had it sanded down in 1968. == Current Casinos == Epiphone currently builds several versions of the Casino. These include: * Regular \\"Archtop-Series\\" Casino made in China and uses non-American made parts (Korea until 2007) * Elitist Casino. Made in Japan and set-up in America, and contains American made parts such as the pickups. Body is 5-ply maple, Gibson P-90 pickups, and nickel hardware. * Casino Coupé. A smaller version. The body is the same size as a Gibson ES-339. * Inspired by John Lennon 1965 or Revolution Casino. These Casinos were made in China with American-made \\"Tribute\\" P-90 pickups and a five-ply maple body and are less expensive versions of the now defunct United States Collection John Lennon Revolution Casino which was made in Japan and assembled in America. The 1965 version has a sunburst finish, white pick guard and small button Grover tuners. The Revolution version was based on the modifications Lennon made to his 1965 Casino during the recording of the White Album, which include a \\"stripped\\" (natural) satin finish, gold Grover tuners, no pickguard, a deeper set-in neck, and Lennon's signature on the back of the headstock. * Limited Edition 1961 Casino. This limited version is offered in Royal Tan and Vintage Sunburst, with either a trapeze tailpiece or a tremotone tremolo. It sports a 5-layer maple-birch body, Gibson P-90 pickups, \\"short\\" headstock, bullet trussrod cover, tortoiseshell pickguard, and pre-Gibson era Epiphone badge. == References  External links == * Official Epiphone Casino site Casino Category:Semi-acoustic guitars Category:The Beatles' musical instruments sv:Epiphone Casino VT ","title":"Epiphone Casino"},{"id":"6201912","text":"Grosvenor family, also used by the Duke of Westminster Baron Stalbridge, of Stalbridge in the County of Dorset, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The lyric uses the seasons of the year metaphorically to illustrate the growth and death of a romance. The lyric also uses the ideas of the hours in a day and the flames of a fire to illustrate a relationship growing stronger and subsequently losing strength. The song has been described as a song that makes use of nostalgia, with music written by Gene de Paul, and lyrics by Patricia Johnston and Don Raye. It made its debut in the 1942 Abbott and Costello comedy Ride 'Em Cowboy, being sung by Dick Foran. Since then, dozens upon dozens of artists have covered the song as listed below. One of the most notable live renditions of the song is a radio performance by Judy Garland, on a broadcast of Lux Radio Theatre. 'I'll Remember April' can be found in the Real Book tacit vol 1.

It was established as local private bank by W. R. Grace and Company in 1914 to concentrate on business done in South America. On June 19, 1924, the Grace National Bank became a nationally chartered financial institution. The bank operated from a head office in the Grace National Bank Building at 58-60 Water Street. The founding president was J. Louis Schaefer, a vice-president at W. R. Grace and Company. He died in 1927 and was succeeded by Francis H. McKnight (1927-1933) then Chester R. Dewey. Other former presidents included Frank Comerford Walker. Grace National Bank lost clients and deposits during the Great Depression of the 1930s but survived and began growing again in the post World War II era. In 1950, the bank earned the largest gross and net profit in its thirty-five-year history. In the 1960s, the bank struggled with stiff competition from large operations and on August 10, 1965, the Federal Reserve Bank gave its approval for the merger of Grace National Bank with the Marine Midland Bank (now HSBC Bank USA). == References == Category:Defunct banks of the United States Category:HSBC acquisitions Category:Banks disestablished in 1965 Category:Banks established in 1914 Category:Defunct companies based in New York (state) Category:1914 establishments in New York (state) Category:1965 disestablishments in New York (state) Category:W.

The first executive committee of the Society included the notable physicians John Hughlings Jackson, Sir William Gowers, and David Ferrier. The aim was to establish an agricultural colony where people with epilepsy could live and work. A farm was bought in Chalfont St Peter which at its peak in the 1950s, cared for over 550 people. A NHS treatment unit was established at Chalfont in 1972. Around this time, the Society became known as The National Society for Epilepsy (NSE). In 1995 a 1.5 tesla MRI scanner was installed - the first dedicated to research in epilepsy. This has now been superseded by a 3 tesla instrument in 2004, which produces higher resolution images. The NSE's MRI Unit is at the forefront of medical imaging research applied to epilepsy. In 2011 the charity changed its name to Epilepsy Society. == Epilepsy Tool Kit App == In 2011 the Epilepsy Society, aided by Citrix, launched the Epilepsy tool kit app, first for iPhones and later for Android.

This is heavily designed to reduce some of the actions frequently taken by seizure bystanders which cause additional injuries or unnecessary emergency services action - holding down, inserting items into mouths, early calling of ambulances etc.Public \\"ignorant\\" about epilepsy BBC News *Medication & Reminders - to allow tracking of complex pharmaceutical regimes, both to ensure correct supply of medication and correct timetabling.

The San Francisco Fire Department, along with the San Francisco Police Department and San Francisco Sheriff's Department, serves an estimated population of 1.4 million people, which includes the approximately 850,000 citizens residing in the of San Francisco (including Treasure Island, Yerba Buena Island, San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz Island, the San Francisco International Airport, and the Presidio of San Francisco/Golden Gate National Recreation Area. ==History== Volunteer Department: 1849-1866 The first great fire in San Francisco originated on Christmas Eve, 1849. By the time it burned itself out; fifty buildings were gone at a loss of $1,500,000. The Town Council held a special called meeting that afternoon and passed a resolution to organize a fire department. The resolution states, in part, “Therefore…..to protect the town against another such calamity by organizing fire companies”, and the San Francisco Fire Department was born. Town Council met on January 28th, 1850 and formally elected Kohler as the first Chief Engineer of the San Francisco Fire Department. Paid Department: 1866-Present The legal basis for the origin of the Paid Department stemmed from legislation titled, \\"An Act to Establish a Paid Fire Department for the City and County of San Francisco.\\" (Approval by the State Legislature was granted on March 2, 1866.) The Act provided for a five man Board of Fire Commissioners to manage the affairs of the Department. The Fire Department consisted of a Chief Engineer, two Assistant Chiefs, one Corporation Yard Keeper and six steam fire engine companies. Each engine company was to have one foreman, one engineer, one driver, one fireman, and eight extra or \\"call\\" men. There were two Hook- and-Ladder Companies each consisting of one foreman, one driver, one tillerman and twelve extra men. Additionally, there were three Hose Companies, each consisting of one foreman, one driver, one steward and six extra men. During April of 1866, the Board of Supervisors purchased four steam fire engines and one hose reel from the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company of Manchester, New Hampshire. This purchase was made at a cost of $17,655. In July of the same year the Supervisors also bought twenty-seven horses to provide motive power for the new and heavier equipment. One of the first acts of the new Board of Fire Commissioners was to appoint the Department executive officers. On October 6, 1866 Franklin E. R. Whitney was appointed Chief Engineer; H.W. Burckes, First Assistant Chief; and Charles H. Ackerson, Second Assistant Chief. The Department went into active operation on December 3, 1866, making it the first paid Fire Department West of the Mississippi. Daniel Hayes, was appointed Superintendent of Steamers, Tom Sawyer, Corporation Yard Keeper, and John L. Durkee, Fire Marshal In 1906, the department was considered on a par with those of the larger cities on the East Coast, but found itself reduced to fighting the fire of 1906 in the quake aftermath with axes and shovels, as most of the city's water mains were broken and cisterns drained. Fire Chief Dennis T. Sullivan suffered mortal wounds in his home by a falling chimney early in the disaster and subsequently died in the hospital. In 1955, Earl Gage Jr. was hired as the first Black firefighter. His work as director of community services is credited with diversifying the department. ==OperationsFireboats=== Phoenix docked at Pier . The SFFD has three fireboats that are docked at Pier . Fireboat 1, the Phoenix, was constructed in 1954 and is fitted with three deck monitors, a water town and two under pier monitors. Fireboat 2, the Guardian, was constructed in 1950 and is the oldest fireboat in the fleet. Both boats are and outfitted with two engines giving them top speeds of (Guardian) and (Phoenix). A third new 85-foot fireboat (Fireboat 3) was christened the St. Francis in October 2016. ===Fire Stations and Apparatus=== Fireboat Guardian stands on alert status near the Bay Bridge.

The film cast many actual firefighters from the department and used SFFD fire trucks during the filming. Fire Station 38 was also shown. The exterior shots were done at the Bank of America Building. * Actor Steve McQueen was given a San Francisco Fire Department Honorary Battalion Chief badge #33 with ID in recognition for his accurate portrayal of San Francisco Battalion Fire Chief Mike O'Halloran. * The SFFD was also used in the Dirty Harry film series, particularly Rescue Squad 2 in Dirty Harry. * When a veteran SFFD firefighter is killed and Adrian Monk is blinded in a mysterious attack at a firehouse in the Monk episode \\"Mr. Monk Can't See a Thing\\", Monk must rely on his other senses to solve the bizarre case. In the course of the episode, he finds that the killer came to the firehouse to steal a fireman's coat and even finds that the man who blinded him had just beforehand killed a woman a few blocks away and set fire to her house (that fire was the one the engine company had been responding to when the murder at the firehouse took place). The depicted fire station, Fire Station 53, is a fictitious station. The exterior of the station was represented by Fire Station 1 of the Los Angeles Fire Department. * In the Monk novel series by Lee Goldberg, Joe Cochran, Natalie Teeger's occasional lover, is an SFFD firefighter, making appearances in the novels Mr. Monk Goes to the Firehouse, Mr. Monk and the Two Assistants, and Mr. Monk in Outer Space. * The SFFD was featured in two Emergency! television movies in 1978 and 1979, where L.A. County firefighter/paramedics Gage and DeSoto run calls with the firefighters of Rescue Squad 2. * The NBC Television show Trauma followed the fictional lives of SFFD paramedics, EMTs and flight medics. * The department is featured in the 1985 James Bond film A View to a Kill. After San Francisco City Hall is set ablaze by the villainous Max Zorin in an attempt to kill Bond, the SFFD arrives on scene and assists Roger Moore's character in escaping the burning building and then ultimately \\"borrows\\" a SFFD ladder truck in order to outrun the police officers chasing him on the suspicion that his character set the blaze. * The CBS television series Rescue 911s episode #107 the 4th segment featured the San Francisco Fire Department responding to an apartment fire and in one of the scenes, sparks shoot over a firetruck from a broken wire from a powerline. The station was Station #9, built in 1915. ==References *San Francisco Fire Department official website *San Francisco Fire Museum *History of the San Francisco Fire Department at the SF Museum *SFFD Fire Reserve website Category:Fire departments in California Fire Department Category:Ambulance services in the United States Category:Medical and health organizations based in California ","title":"San Francisco Fire Department"},{"id":"6201994","text":"This is a list of all the reasons written by Michel Bastarache during his tenure as puisne justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. ==1998== {  width=825 - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" ! width=25px  !! width=35%  Case name !!

In the entertainment industry, a stage mother is the term for the mother of a child performer. Often the stage mother is the manager of the child's career and oversees their auditions, costuming and preparation for performances and negotiates financial remuneration on the child's behalf. There is sometimes a negative connotation for the term, sometimes implying a mother who exerts unreasonable demands for the child's treatment, or puts undue pressure on the child, or who may take advantage of the child's income or notoriety for her own selfish purposes. ==Well-known stage mothers== * Carol Connors (mother of Thora Birch) Alt URL * Ruby Dandridge (mother of Dorothy and Vivian Dandridge) * Susan Duff (mother of Hilary and Haylie Duff) * Joan Grande (mother of Ariana and Frankie Grande) * Yolanda Hadid (mother of Gigi Hadid and Bella Hadid) * Ethel Gumm (mother of Judy Garland) * Maria Gurdin (mother of Natalie and Lana Wood) * Lynn Harless (mother of Justin Timberlake) * Diane Haughton (mother of Aaliyah) * Charlotte Hennessey (mother of Mary, Jack and Lottie Pickford) * Wanda Holloway (The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom) * Rose Hovick (mother of Gypsy Rose Lee and June Havoc) * Kris Jenner (mother of Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner) * Tina Knowles (mother of Beyoncé and Solange Knowles) * Diana Levesque (mother of JoJo) * Dina Lohan (mother of Lindsay and Ali Lohan) * Minnie Marx (mother of the Marx Brothers) * Colette Momsen (mother of Taylor Momsen) * Sonja Norwood (mother of Brandy and Ray J) * Patsy Ramsey (mother of JonBenét Ramsey) * Mama June Shannon (Here Comes Honey Boo Boo) * Charlotte Shelby (mother of Mary Miles Minter) * Teri Shields (mother of Brooke Shields) * Lynne Spears (mother of Britney and Jamie Lynn Spears) * Sara Taylor (mother of Elizabeth Taylor) ==References== Category:Lists of mothers Category:Motherhood ","title":"List of stage mothers"},{"id":"6202016","text":"David Lan.

He received the 2018 Marsh ‘Anthropology in the World’ Award given by the Royal Anthropological Institute. The citation read ‘David is a polymath parallel who has built connections between the world of the social sciences, inter-continental understandings and the humanities and performing arts. He has applied these talents while leading theatre companies both artistically and practically with their building projects. David first trained as an actor before beginning to write and direct for the theatre. When he moved to London in the 1970s, he took a degree in Social Anthropology, followed by a PhD which would be published in 1985 as Guns and Rain: Guerrillas and Spirit Mediums in Zimbabwe, an original study of the role of rural, religious practitioners in the struggle to bring an end to the Rhodesian racist regime. The book made an enormous impact at the time and thirty years later has become an undisputed modern classic. Following his PhD, David travelled extensively in Africa writing films and drama documentaries for the BBC and continuing to write plays for major companies and venues. David has connected scholarship, and geographical and cultural differences with complete disregard for conventional boundaries: educating through performance and taking every opportunity to help younger and less well-placed artists at each stage of a career that is currently at its height. He is a fine example of practising the characteristics of an anthropological informed mindset appraising the contemporary world.’ ==References * Biography at the Young Vic * David Lan named as artistic director of World Trade Centre arts hub * 2002 interview with the Guardian * Not In Norwich 1976 Royal Court Activists production info Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:British writers Category:British theatre directors Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Writers from Cape Town Category:Writers from London Category:South African emigrants to the United Kingdom ","title":"David Lan"},{"id":"6202017","text":"Sara Rose Diamond is an American sociologist and attorney, and the author of four books that \\"study and expose the agenda and tactics of the American political right wing.\\"Thomson, Contemporary Authors Online ==Biography== After graduating from the University of California at Irvine, Diamond earned a Ph.D. from U.C.

The railway was officially completed on 19 February 2006. The railway took over 1,500 workers more than five years to build, with 800 contractors working in the harsh conditions of the Karakum Desert. The railway was built using no foreign specialists - only companies and contractors from Turkmenistan were used. The opening ceremony was held at Içoguz (formerly Darvaza), where a white marble railway station with a capacity of 100 people a day was built for the event. The railway takes 12 hours to traverse, halving the previous travel time between the two cities of Ashgabat and Dashoguz by replacing the route from through Mary and Lebap provinces and along the border with Uzbekistan with one shorter. There are 17 stations along the entire route, some serving existing villages, and others serving as a drop-off point for planned villages. Over 130 bridges span the various water features, and a new highway is also being constructed alongside the railway. It is the third large-scale project implemented since Turkmenistan's independence. Earlier, a stretch of the Tejen-Serakhs-Mashhad railway as well as the long Türkmenabat- Kerki railway were built in the country. ==External links== * Construction of Trans-Karakum railway nears completion in Turkmenistan Turkmenistan.ru * Northern and southern stretches of Trans Karakum railway connected in Turkmenistan Turkmenistan.ru ==References== Category:Railway lines in Turkmenistan ","title":"Trans-Karakum Railway"},{"id":"6202028","text":"Charles (Chuck) Howard (1933-November 21, 1996) was an American television executive, and a pioneer in television sports broadcasting. ==BiographyEarly life and career=== Howard was born in 1933. He graduated from Duke University in 1955, where he was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Following his college graduation, Howard entered the management training program at Chase Manhattan Bank.Arledge, Roone: \\"Roone: A Memoir\\", page 35. HarperCollins, 2004 In 1960, he made an abrupt career turn and became a production assistant at Edgar J. Scherick's company, Sports Programs, Inc., the forerunner to ABC Sports. ===ABC Sports=== In 1961, Roone Arledge charged him with scouting sports events throughout the world in an effort to discover sports that had a loyal following but might be unknown to American television viewers. The result was the April 21, 1961 debut of ABC's Wide World of Sports, the groundbreaking television sports anthology program. Arledge, Howard and commentator Jim McKay created the show on a week-by-week basis during its first year of broadcast, establishing a sports television tradition in the process. Howard went on to become a vice president for programming at ABC Sports and covered nine Olympic Games, the Super Bowl, World Series, British Open, Kentucky Derby, Indianapolis 500 and NCAA football—as well as Acapulco cliff diving, Demolition Derby, rodeos, bobsled racing, arm wrestling and Evel Knievel's daredevil antics. Howard is credited with being the first to use a split screen and an isolated camera to highlight a part of a play away from the main action. On April 8, 1967, due to an AFTRA strike, Howard and director Chet Forte filled-in as commentators for Game 4 of the NBA Eastern Conference Finals between the Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers. He oversaw the broadcast of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, notable for the massacre of 11 Israeli team members by Palestinian terrorists. ===Departure from ABC and later career=== In 1986, Howard left ABC and became the executive producer for the Big Ten Conference's football and basketball broadcasts. In 1991, he was named the executive producer at Trans World International, overseeing such events as the New York City Marathon, the America's Cup, and world coverage of the Masters golf tournament, as well as figure skating and tennis events. ===Death=== Howard died of brain cancer on November 21, 1996 in Pound Ridge, New York. ==Honors== Wide World of Sports became the longest-running continuing series on ABC, and it won numerous Peabody Awards and Emmy Awards. Howard himself won 11 Emmy Awards as a producer. In 2009, Chuck Howard was one of the eight inducted into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame in New York, New York ==References== Category:American television executives Category:American television producers Category:1996 deaths Category:1933 births Category:Duke University alumni Category:National Basketball Association broadcasters Category:Deaths from brain tumor Category:Sports Emmy Award winners Category:Wide World of Sports (American TV series) Category:Deaths from cancer in New York (state) ","title":"Chuck Howard"},{"id":"6202048","text":"\\"Megarama '89\\" is a megamix of songs by English girl group Bananarama.

Buchholzer. During the Great Depression, J.J. Buchholzer became owner of a Hower's department store in downtown Akron. The Buchholzers knew Akron would grow to the north, and they felt that a Hower's store should be located on their land. It later became evident that even larger opportunities existed, and the natural choice was a climate-controlled shopping mall. Buchholzer teamed up with Forest City Enterprises to build Akron's first indoor mall. Plans were ready by 1963, but before the mall opened, Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation built Summit Mall on the west side of Akron.

In the 1930s, young Richard Buchholzer found what appeared to be an old Indian council circle on his father's land. Because of this, Buchholzer named the development \\"Chapel Hill\\".

Born at Westminster, Peto was the seventh son of Sir Morton Peto, 1st Baronet. He entered Harrow School, but was withdrawn at the age of seventeen when his father experienced financial difficulties. He became an apprentice joiner with his family's business, Peto Brothers, building contractors, of Pimlico. He became a partner in the company in 1884 and married Mary Matilda Annie Baird in 1892. The couple had three sons. In 1890 Peto attempted to bring in a form of profit-sharing to the company. The proposal was opposed by the trade unions, leading to a strike. The company was dissolved in 1893 and Peto was financially ruined. He took up employment with Morgan Crucible in 1892, eventually becoming managing director by 1904, when he resigned. He travelled widely for the company supervising the mining and purchase of plumbago in the United States, Canada, India and Ceylon. Peto was chosen by the Conservative Party to contest the January 1910 general election, regaining the Devizes constituency in Wiltshire which had been lost to the Liberals in 1906. He retained the seat until the 1918 election. During the First World War he held a temporary commission in the British Army and acted as the Chief Commissioner for Belgian Refugee Affairs. He was made a Commander of the Order of Leopold by Albert I of Belgium. Peto returned to the Commons, twice serving as Member of Parliament for Barnstaple, holding the seat from 1922 to 1923 and again from 1924 to 1935. He was created a Baronet, of Barnstaple in the County of Devon, in January 1927. He found himself at odds with many of the policies of Stanley Baldwin's Conservative government, and lost the party whip to sit as an independent in April 1928. Following a unanimous vote of confidence in him by his local party executive, he was readmitted to the parliamentary party in November. In June 1934 he announced that he would be retiring from parliament at the next general election, which was held in the following year. Peto served as chairman of the National Society for the Prevention of Venereal Disease from 1926 – 1939. Peto died at his home, Iford Gatehouse, near Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire in January 1945 aged 82. He was succeeded by his elder son James Michael Peto (1894–1971). A younger son Christopher (1897–1980) succeeded his elder brother and also served as MP for Barnstaple. ==NotesReferences== * Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

Trained as a lawyer and economist, he studied in the United States. He co-founded the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR) in 1941, alongside Víctor Paz Estenssoro, Hernán Siles, and others. When the MNR came to power following the 1952 Bolivian Revolution, Guevara served as minister of foreign relations in the cabinet of President Paz Estenssoro (1952–56). He was then appointed Minister of Interior by President Siles (1956–60). Often seen as the third-highest leader in the MNR hierarchy (after Paz and Siles), the relatively conservative Guevara clashed repeatedly on ideological grounds with Juan Lechín and others associated with the Left wing of the party. Fully expecting to be the party's official candidate for president in 1960, he left it abruptly to form his own political organization when Paz Estenssoro decided to return to Bolivia and run for re- election. The party Guevara founded was the Partido Revolucionario Auténtico, in whose representation he ran for president in 1960, finishing second to Paz. In 1964, Guevara supported the military coup d'état that toppled the MNR from power, and once more served as Minister of Foreign Relations, this time to President René Barrientos. The long years in exile following the establishment of the 1971-78 dictatorship of General Hugo Banzer brought Guevara closer to the main body of the MNR, by now divested of its more left-leaning elements, including Siles and Lechín. When democratic elections were at long last called again in 1978, Guevara ran as Paz Estenssoro's vice-presidential running mate. Their ticket finished second. When that electoral contest was annulled due to evidence of fraud, a second one was held a year later. Guevara this time did not run on the main formula, but was elected Senator in representation of the MNR alliance. Soon, he was proclaimed President of the Senate by his peers. Since no presidential candidate in the 1979 elections had received the necessary 50% of the vote, it fell to Congress to decide who should be first executive. To the surprise of many, it could not agree on any candidate, no matter how many votes were taken. Positions hardened, and no solution seemed possible, until an alternative was offered in the form of the President of the Senate, Wálter Guevara, who was named temporary Bolivian president in August 1979 pending the calling of new elections in 1980. ==President of Bolivia== Guevara's tenure was short and difficult. Faced with a mounting economic and fiscal crisis, the new president declared that it might be advisable to extend his mandate by an extra year in order to allow him to confidently take the adequate measures. This was seen by many as a naked power grab and his popularity plummeted to the point that he had to resort to a purely technocratic cabinet in the absence of any congressional support. This impasse was taken advantage of by some conspiratorial members of the military, who were displeased with the fast pace, the tone, and the results of the democratic restoration. ===Deposed in a bloody coup=== On November 1, 1979, General Alberto Natusch surprisingly toppled President Guevara in a bloody coup d'état that was resisted by the urban population. Natusch did take possession, but not without considerable bloodshed. Moreover, the citizenry continued to resist, led by a nationwide labor strike called by the powerful Central Obrera Boliviana (COB) of Juan Lechín. In the end, Natusch was able to occupy the Palacio Quemado for only sixteen days, after which he was forced to give up his quixotic struggle. The only face-saving concession he extracted from Congress was the promise that Guevara not be allowed to resume his duties as president. This condition was accepted and a new provisional president was found in the leader of the lower congressional house (the House of Deputies), Mrs. Lidia Gueiler. ==Later career== Guevara, although bitter by the strange circumstances that surrounded his ousting, resumed his senatorial duties and continued to support Paz Estenssoro in subsequent elections (1980, 1985). In 1982 he was appointed Bolivian Ambassador to Venezuela. In 1989 (already quite elderly) he again ran for office, this time as vice-presidential running mate to the MNR's Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada. Although they received a majority of the votes, Sanchez and Guevara did not accede to the Quemado, as Congress selected as president the third-place finisher, Jaime Paz. ===Retirement and death=== Guevara then retired from public life and died in La Paz on June 20, 1996. ==See also== * Government of Wálter Guevara Arze, 1979 ==Sourced== *Mesa José de; Gisbert, Teresa; and Carlos D.

Upon moving to New Haven, Haskins entered in to formal affiliation agreements with both Yale University and the University of Connecticut; it remains fully independent, administratively and financially, of both Yale and UConn. Haskins is a multidisciplinary and international community of researchers which conducts basic research on spoken and written language. A guiding perspective of their research is to view speech and language as emerging from biological processes, including those of adaptation, response to stimuli, and conspecific interaction. The Laboratories has a long history of technological and theoretical innovation, from creating systems of rules for speech synthesis and development of an early working prototype of a reading machine for the blind to developing the landmark concept of phonemic awareness as the critical preparation for learning to read an alphabetic writing system. ==Research tools and facilities== Haskins Laboratories is equipped, in-house, with a comprehensive suite of tools and capabilities to advance its mission of research into language and literacy. As of 2014, these included: * Anechoic chamber * Electroencephalography ** BioSemi 264 electrode, 24 bit Active Two System ** EGI 128 electrode, Geodesic EEG System 300 * Electromagnetic articulography (EMMA) ** Carstens AG501 ** NDI WAVE * Eye Tracking: HL is equipped with 3 SR Research eye-trackers. ** 2 Model Eyelink 1000 systems. ** 1 Model Eyelink 1000plus system. * Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Haskins has access to MRI scanners through agreements with the University of Connecticut and the Yale School of Medicine.

All of them are indebted to the pioneering work and leadership of Caryl Parker Haskins, Franklin S. Cooper, Alvin Liberman, Seymour Hutner and Luigi Provasoli. The history presented here focuses on the research program of the division of Haskins Laboratories that, since the 1940s, has been most well known for its work in the areas of speech, language, and reading.Haskins Laboratories, The Science of the Spoken and Written Word. ===1930s=== Caryl Haskins and Franklin S. Cooper established Haskins Laboratories in 1935. It was originally affiliated with Harvard University, MIT, and Union College in Schenectady, NY. Caryl Haskins conducted research in microbiology, radiation physics, and other fields in Cambridge, MA and Schenectady. In 1939 the Laboratories moved its center to New York City. Seymour Hutner joined the staff to set up a research program in microbiology, genetics, and nutrition. The descendant of the division led by Hutner program eventually became a department of Pace University in New York. The two identically named organizations are no longer formally affiliated. ===1940s=== The U. S. Office of Scientific Research and Development, under Vannevar Bush asked Haskins Laboratories to evaluate and develop technologies for assisting blinded World War II veterans. Experimental psychologist Alvin Liberman joined the Laboratories to assist in developing a \\"sound alphabet\\" to represent the letters in a text for use in a reading machine for the blind. Luigi Provasoli joined the Laboratories to set up a research program in marine biology. The program in marine biology moved to Yale University in 1970 and disbanded with Provasoli's retirement in 1978. ===1950s=== Franklin S. Cooper invented the pattern playback, a machine that converts pictures of the acoustic patterns of speech back into sound. With this device, Alvin Liberman, Cooper, and Pierre Delattre (and later joined by Katherine Safford Harris, Leigh Lisker, Arthur Abramson, and others), discovered the acoustic cues for the perception of phonetic segments (consonants and vowels). Liberman and colleagues proposed a motor theory of speech perception to resolve the acoustic complexity: they hypothesized that we perceive speech by tapping into a biological specialization, a speech module, that contains knowledge of the acoustic consequences of articulation. Liberman, aided by Frances Ingemann and others, organized the results of the work on speech cues into a groundbreaking set of rules for speech synthesis by the Pattern Playback . ===1960s=== Franklin S. Cooper and Katherine Safford Harris, working with Peter MacNeilage, were the first researchers in the U.S. to use electromyographic techniques, pioneered at the University of Tokyo, to study the neuromuscular organization of speech. Leigh Lisker and Arthur Abramson looked for simplification at the level of articulatory action in the voicing of certain contrasting consonants. They showed that many acoustic properties of voicing contrasts arise from variations in voice onset time, the relative phasing of the onset of vocal cord vibration and the end of a consonant. Their work has been widely replicated and elaborated, here and abroad, over the following decades. Donald Shankweiler and Michael Studdert- Kennedy used a dichotic listening technique (presenting different nonsense syllables simultaneously to opposite ears) to demonstrate the dissociation of phonetic (speech) and auditory (nonspeech) perception by finding that phonetic structure devoid of meaning is an integral part of language, typically processed in the left cerebral hemisphere. Liberman, Cooper, Shankweiler, and Studdert-Kennedy summarized and interpreted fifteen years of research in \\"Perception of the Speech Code,\\" still among the most cited papers in the speech literature. It set the agenda for many years of research at Haskins and elsewhere by describing speech as a code in which speakers overlap (or coarticulate) segments to form syllables. Researchers at Haskins connected their first computer to a speech synthesizer designed by the Laboratories' engineers. Ignatius Mattingly, with British collaborators, John N. Holmes and J.N. Shearme , adapted the Pattern playback rules to write the first computer program for synthesizing continuous speech from a phonetically spelled input. A further step toward a reading machine for the blind combined Mattingly's program with an automatic look-up procedure for converting alphabetic text into strings of phonetic symbols. ===1970s=== In 1970, Haskins Laboratories moved to New Haven, Connecticut, and entered into affiliation agreements with Yale University and the University of Connecticut; Haskins remains fully independent of both Yale and UConn, administratively and financially. The Lab's original location in New Haven, at 270 Crown Street (from 1970 to 2005), was leased from Yale University. Isabelle Liberman, Donald Shankweiler, and Alvin Liberman teamed up with Ignatius Mattingly to study the relationship between speech perception and reading, a topic implicit in the Laboratories' research program since its inception. They developed the concept of phonemic awareness, the knowledge that would-be readers must be aware of the phonemic structure of their language in order to be able to read. Leonard Katz related the work to contemporary cognitive theory and provided expertise in experimental design and data analysis. Under the broad rubric of the \\"alphabetic principle,\\" this is the core of the Laboratories' present program of reading pedagogy. Patrick Nye joined the Laboratories to lead a team working on the reading machine for the blind. The project culminated when the addition of an optical character recognizer allowed investigators to assemble the first automatic text-to-speech reading machine. By the end of the decade this technology had advanced to the point where commercial concerns assumed the task of designing and manufacturing reading machines for the blind . In 1973, Franklin S. Cooper was selected to form a panel of six expertsTime Magazine (1973). \\"The Secretary and the Tape Tangle.\\" Time Magazine, Dec. 10, 1973. charged with investigating the famous 18-minute gap in the White House office tapes of President Richard Nixon related to the Watergate scandal Building on earlier work, Philip Rubin developed the sinewave synthesis program, which was then used by Robert Remez, Rubin, and colleagues to show that listeners can perceive continuous speech without traditional speech cues from a pattern of sinewaves that track the changing resonances of the vocal tract. This paved the way for a view of speech as a dynamic pattern of trajectories through articulatory-acoustic space. Philip Rubin and colleagues developed Paul Mermelstein's anatomically simplified vocal tract model , originally worked on at Bell Laboratories, into the first articulatory synthesizer that can be controlled in a physically meaningful way and used for interactive experiments. ===1980s=== Studies of different writing systems supported the controversial hypothesis that all reading necessarily activates the phonological form of a word before, or at the same time, as its meaning. Work included experiments by Georgije Lukatela , Michael Turvey, Leonard Katz, Ram Frost, Laurie Feldman , and Shlomo Bentin, in a variety of languages. Cross-language work on reading, including investigations of the brain process involved, remains a large part of the Laboratories' program today. Various researchers developed compatible theoretical accounts of speech production,Gloria J. Borden and Katherine S. Harris. Speech Science Primer: Physiology, acoustics, and perception of speech. Second Edition. Williams & Williams, Baltimore, MD, 1984 speech perception and phonological knowledge. Carol Fowler proposed a direct realism theory of speech perception: listeners perceive gestures not by means of a specialized decoder, as in the motor theory, but because information in the acoustic signal specifies the gestures that form it. J. A. Scott Kelso and colleagues demonstrated functional synergies in speech gestures experimentally. Elliot Saltzman developed a dynamical systems theory of synergetic action and implemented the theory as a working model of speech production. Linguists Catherine Browman and Louis Goldstein developed the theory of articulatory phonology , in which gestures are the basic units of both phonetic action and phonological knowledge. Articulatory phonology, the task dynamic model, and the articulatory synthesis model are combined into a gestural computational model of speech production . ===1990s=== Katherine Safford Harris,Frederica Bell-Berti. Producing Speech: Contemporary Issues, for Katherine Safford Harris. Springer, 1995. Frederica Bell-Berti and colleagues studied the phasing and cohesion of articulatory speech gestures. Kenneth Pugh was among the first scientists to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to reveal brain activity associated with reading and reading disabilities. Pugh, Donald Shankweiler, Weija Ni , Einar Mencl , and colleagues developed novel applications of neuroimaging to measure brain activity associated with understanding sentences. Philip Rubin, Louis Goldstein and Mark Tiede designed a radical revision of the articulatory synthesis model, known as CASY , the configurable articulatory synthesizer. This 3-dimensional model of the vocal tract permits researchers to replicate MRI images of actual speakers. Douglas Whalen, Goldstein, Rubin and colleagues extended this work to study the relation between speech production and perception. Donald Shankweiler, Susan Brady, Anne Fowler , and others explored whether weak memory and perception in poor readers are tied specifically to phonological deficits. Evidence rejected broader cognitive deficits underlying reading difficulties and raised questions about impaired phonological representations in disabled readers. ===2000s=== In 2000, Anne Fowler and Susan Brady launched the Early Reading Success (ERS) program , part of the Haskins Literacy Initiative which promotes the science of teaching reading. The ERS program was a demonstration project examining the efficacy of professional development in reading instruction for teachers of children in kindergarten through second grade. The Mastering Reading Instruction program , which combines professional development with Haskins-trained mentors, was a continuation of ERS. David Ostry and colleagues explored the neurological underpinning of motor control using a robot arm to influence jaw movement. Douglas Whalen and Khalil Iskarous pioneered the pairing of ultrasound, used here to monitor articulators that cannot be seen, and Optotrak , an opto- electronic position-tracking device, used here to monitor visible articulators. Christine Shadle joined Haskins in 2004 to head up a project investigating the speech production goals for fricatives. Donald Shankweiler and David Braze developed an eye movement laboratory that combines eye tracking data with brain activity measures for investigating reading processes in normal and disabled readers. Laura Koenig and Jorge C. Lucero studied the development of laryngeal and aerodynamic control in children's speech. In March 2005 Haskins Laboratories moved to a new, state-of-the-art facility on the 9th floor of a commercial building at 300 George Street in New Haven. This provides about 11,000 square feet of office and lab space. In 2008, Ken Pugh of Yale University was named President and Director of Research, succeeding Carol Fowler who remains at Haskins as a Senior Advisor. In 2009, Haskins released a new Strategic Plan , featuring new Birth-to-Five and Bilingualism initiatives. ===2010s=== The Haskins Training Institute was established in 2011 to provide direct educational opportunities in Haskins Laboratories' core areas of research (language, speech perception, speech production, literacy). The Training Institute serves to communicate this knowledge to the public through accessible seminars, small conferences, and intern and training positions. In December 2015, Haskins Laboratories convened a Global Literacy Summit. This was a three-day meeting of scientists and representatives from governmental and non-governmental organizations around the globe, who are working with programs in the developing world to support literacy and education in disadvantaged populations. In 2016, Richard N. Aslin joined Haskins, after leaving the University of Rochester. In 2019, David Lewkowicz joined Haskins after leaving Northeastern University. ===2020s=== Nothing to report, yet. == See also (people) == * Arthur S.

The Yoder School was a small, wooden school that was built in 1923 and used until 1963. The building still stands. South Clackamas Community Church has met at the old Yoder School since the mid-1990s and even ran a private Christian School at the location for a few years.

He took command of the 9th Queen's Royal Lancers in October 1938, being one of the few officers in the regiment to have seen action in World War I. He was tasked with carrying on the mechanised training of the regiment in the buildup to the war, to mobilise it when war came and to take it to France in May 1940. The regimental history of the Lancers has this description of him in its foreword: > \\"His was the responsibility of showing all ranks how to behave under fire, > and so much depends upon the leadership the first time men go into battle. > His calm and fearless example was an inspiration to all, and laid the > foundation of the enthusiasm and steadiness which the regiment so > consistently displayed throughout the war. He commanded with conspicuous > ability in the fantastic operations south of the Somme until a severe wound > obliged him to be evacuated. He earned the D.S.O. for his services in France > in 1940, though this was not known until Major-General Victor Fortune, > Commander of the 51st Highland Division, was able to make his > recommendations on his return from captivity in Germany. These he backed up > by a personal visit to the War Office. Those who did not take part can have > little idea of a commanding officer's difficulties during those two years. > Many were caused by failure in higher places to foresee more accurately the > type of equipment which would be required, to provide it in time, and to > settle with less vacillation the organisation of the troops who would use > it. Luckily for the regiment, Chris Peto had, and has, an inexhaustible fund > of humour and an irrepressible spirit. These, he would be the first to > admit, have sometimes got him into trouble, but they were invaluable assets > through those years of exasperating trial. He did not come back after his > recovery, but was promoted to the command of armoured brigade. The Regiment > owes him a debt.\\"Bright, Joan - The Ninth Queens Royal Lancers 1939-1945, > Gale & Polden Ltd, Aldershot. 1951. When the regiment deployed to France it was not well equipped and this was partly the reason for Peto becoming wounded: > \\"Major MacDonell seeing the head and face of a German popping out of the > ground periodically about three hundred yards from the Regimental > Headquarters, suggested an investigation. Lieutenant-Colonel Peto agreed and > led the reconnaissance accompanied by Major MacDonell's tank and two scout > cars. They opened fire on twelve slit trenches full of enemy infantry. After > ten minutes the Germans crawled out and surrendered. The \\"bag\\" was one > officer and forty-three other ranks. We had found it impossible to depress > the guns on our tanks sufficiently to bear, and Lt-Col Peto, firing from his > turret with his pistol, was badly wounded in the right hand. He carried on > until the Germans surrendered, and was then evacuated.\\" Bright, Joan - The > Ninth Queens Royal Lancers 1939-1945, Gale & Polden Ltd, Aldershot. 1951. pp > 15-16 As well as being awarded the DSO in 1940, Peto also received: * 3 Mentioned in Despatches * French Légion d'honneur: Chevalier * French Croix de Guerre with palm * Belgian Order of Leopold: Commander * Belgian Croix de Guerre with palm * Czech Order of the White Lion: 3rd Class * Czech War Cross * Luxembourg Order of Nassau: Commander * Luxembourg Croix de Guerre * Polish Order of Polonia Restituta ==Political career== At the 1945 general election, Peto was elected as the Member of Parliament for Barnstaple. For the 1950 general election, the Barnstaple constituency was abolished, and Peto was returned instead for the newly recreated Devon North constituency, where he served until the 1955 general election. In 1966, he was appointed the High Sheriff of Wiltshire for the year. In 1971, he inherited the baronetcy created for his father, upon the death of his elder brother. He died at Basingstoke, Hampshire, aged 83 in 1980. The title was inherited by Sir Christopher's son, Michael (1938-2008), who became the 4th Baronet. Michael had three sons and the elder of these, Henry, is the 5th and current Baronet of this creation. The other Peto baronetcy, created for Sir Christopher's grandfather, is also still extant in the senior branch of the family. ==References== * * == External links == * *UK Parliamentary Photograph Category:1897 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:High Sheriffs of Wiltshire Category:UK MPs 1945–1950 Category:UK MPs 1950–1951 Category:UK MPs 1951–1955 Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:British Army personnel of World War II Category:9th Queen's Royal Lancers officers Category:Companions of the Distinguished Service Order Category:Recipients of the Croix de Guerre 1939–1945 (France) Category:Recipients of the Legion of Honour Category:Recipients of the Croix de guerre (Belgium) Category:Recipients of the Order of Polonia Restituta Category:Recipients of the Order of the White Lion Category:Commanders of the Order of Adolphe of Nassau Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Barnstaple ","title":"Christopher Peto"},{"id":"6202375","text":"Smile Empty Soul is the debut studio album by American rock band Smile Empty Soul.

Its variants in the United States include Roudabush, Roudebush Roudenbush, and Ruebush. According to genealogists, the earliest person to whom the Raudenbusch lines can be traced is Hans Peter, who had been born prior to 1600 and continued to operate a flour mill throughout the Thirty Years War. For this, the Kurpfalz Government paid homage to him by giving him the towns' mill. Hans Peter Raudenbusch died October 17, 1657 in Reihen, Baden-Württemberg. The mill is still in continuous use today (2008). ==Diffusion in the United States== Among the masses of emigrants from the Palatinate of Germany in the early 18th century was Hans Heinrich Raudenbusch. Born in Steinsfurt (Sinsheim) around 1712, he was the grandson of Hans Peter Raudenbusch. Hans Heinrich Raudenbusch was a founding member of the Upper Conowago Church of the Brethren, also known as Mummert's Church in Abbottstown, Pennsylvania. He sailed for America aboard the ship Dragon in 1732. He was deeded property near Abbottstown by the son of William Penn. ==Name corruption and diffusion== The name Raudenbusch stayed intact until Heinrich's sons were married. The surname Roudebush is prominent in the families that moved west into Ohio and Indiana; the spelling Roudabush is popular in the Virginia areas; and the surname Ruebush has its beginnings alongside of the Virginia Roudabushes to distinguish themselves from their cousins.

This was Yash Chopra's second directorial film with Amitabh Bachchan and Shashi Kapoor in the lead roles after Deewaar (1975) and was particularly noted for its soundtrack compositions by Khayyam, who won Best Music, while Sahir Ludhianvi won Best Lyricist for \\"Kabhi Kabhie Mere Dil Mein\\" at the 24th Filmfare Awards. The song also earned Mukesh the Best Male Playback Singer. Kabhi Kabhie received highly positive reviews from critics upon release and earned an estimated 40 million at the box office. == Story == Amit Malhotra (Amitabh Bachchan) recites one of his Urdu poems at a college/university where he meets fellow student Pooja (Raakhee), and they fall in love. But Pooja's parents arrange for her to marry an architect, Vijay Khanna (Shashi Kapoor). A heartbroken Amit returns home and joins his father's business–a construction company–and later marries Anjali (Waheeda Rehman), who secretly has a daughter named Pinky (Neetu Singh) from a premarital relationship. Amit and Anjali have a daughter, Sweetie. In the meantime, Pinky is adopted by childless couple Dr. and Mrs. R.P. Kapoor. Spanning over to the next generation, Pooja and Vijay have a son, Vikram (Rishi Kapoor), also known as \\"Vicky\\", who falls in love with Pinky while they are at a party, and the two plan to get married. When Pinky learns of her adoption and the identity of her real mother, she tries to get close to Anjali. While Anjali eventually acknowledges her existence and secretly showers her love on her reunited daughter, she does not reveal the relationship to her husband, fearing for her marriage. The situation is further complicated by Vicky's attempts to stay close to Pinky and Sweetie's romantic interest in Vicky. This sets in motion a chain of events that unites old flames as friends. == Cast == * Amitabh Bachchan as Amit Malhotra * Raakhee as Pooja Khanna * Shashi Kapoor as Vijay Khanna * Waheeda Rehman as Anju Malhotra * Rishi Kapoor as Vicky Khanna * Neetu Singh as Pinky Kapoor * Naseem as Sweety Malhotra * Simi Garewal as Shobha Kapoor * Parikshit Sahni as Dr. R.P. Kapoor *Iftekhar as Mr. Malhotra *Deven Verma as Ram Bajaj == Production == The film's concept came to Yash Chopra while he was reading a poem by his longtime friend (and also the film's lyricist) Sahir Ludhianvi. The movie was shot in Kashmir, and Yash Chopra has claimed this to be one of his happiest experiences and he described the production as a \\"honeymoon\\", since the entire cast worked together as a family.http://www.mag4you.com/music/k/kabhi-kabhi.asp The film also led to the reinvention of Amitabh Bachchan as a romantic poet who loses his love, which was a major departure from his earlier \\"angry-young-man\\" roles such as Zanjeer (1973) and Deewaar (1975). The film had been written with Raakhee in mind, and she had agreed to do it during the making of Daag: A Poem of Love (1973) but before production started she married lyricist Gulzar, who wanted her to retire from acting. However, after some persuasion from Yash Chopra, Gulzar let her do the film. === Crew === * Chief Assistant Director: Ramesh Talwar * Art Direction: Desh Mukerji * Costume Design: Jennifer Kapoor, Rajee Singh * Choreography: Suresh Bhatt == Soundtrack == The soundtrack was composed by Khayyam with lyrics by Sahir Ludhianvi, both of whom won Best Music and Best Lyricist at the 24th Filmfare Awards.

It was completed in September 2015. The project aimed to enhance the station to cope with increased passenger numbers as well as expected future growth in traffic, but did not alter the train capacity of the station. In 2008, the station handled passenger numbers far in excess of the capacity of its existing design. The current station and Pallasades Shopping Centre were completed in 1967 and became the subject of criticism for the congestion of the station and shabbiness of the shopping centre and parts of the station. It is part of the Big City Plan. ==ProposalsCircumstances (2010)=== Birmingham New Street station was built to cater for 650 trains and 60,000 passengers per day, which was roughly the same usage it experienced when it was first constructed. It was believed that demand for rail travel would decrease. However, it now caters for 1,350 trains and over 120,000 passengers - twice its design capacity. Passenger usage of New Street has increased by 50% since 2000. It was predicted that passenger usage of the station would increase by 57% by 2020. Between 1995 and 2005, rail passenger journeys in the West Midlands increased by about 44%, and at New Street station, passenger numbers have increased by about 53%. In the next ten years, this is expected to rise by another 28%. With the station serving more train journeys, the approach from the east, underneath the Bullring Shopping Centre, has become a bottleneck which is constrained by the foundations of the shopping centre preventing widening. Here, twelve tracks constrict to become four and this was outlined in the \\"Birmingham and West Midlands Rail Capacity Review\\" as a future capacity problem. ===Planning history=== The proposed design for the project was unveiled in June 2006 and in the following month, the business case had been completed. The business case had taken 18 months to produce and was created by representatives from Network Rail, Birmingham City Council, Advantage West Midlands, and the West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority (WMPTA). During July and August, Warner Estates, the owners of the Pallasades Shopping Centre, were in negotiations with the developers. A planning application for outline planning permission was submitted on 9 August 2006 with designs and renders and the proposals were publicly welcomed by Birmingham City Council in August 2006. It was given an application number of 'C/05066/06/OUT' and the application was summarised on the city council's website as: > \\"Outline planning application, including the approval of access, for the > major refurbishment and associated development of New Street Station and > adjoining land, in connection with alterations and reconfiguration of the > station facilities and comprising changes to the Pallasades Shopping Centre, > the demolition of Stephenson Tower (Use Class C3), construction of two tall > buildings, associated highway works, public spaces and infrastructure works > (including uses A1 (retail), A3 (restaurants and cafes), A4 (drinking > establishments), A5 (hot food take-away), A2 (financial and professional > services) B1 (business uses including offices) C3 (residential), of the Use > Classes Order (England) April 2005\\" Construction was expected to begin in 2009, with Phase 1 being completed in April 2011 and Phase 2 by Spring 2013. A later report stated the entire station would be completed for the 2012 London Olympics. In late October 2006, the developers of New Street station expressed their interest in technology being developed in Japan where the footsteps of the visitors could be used to generate electricity as well as the turnstiles which can be used to generate energy. They also expressed interest in a glass dome to allow heat to enter and heat the station. In early November 2006, the development was faced with delays. It was first noted that the development would be decided upon in summer 2007. This came as Gisela Stuart, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, warned that this development was vital for Birmingham. A campaign was launched for the public to pledge their support for the development by writing their name and addresses on leaflets and posting them in ballot boxes located around the station. These will be sent to the Department for Transport. If successful, the redevelopment of the station will make it into the priority list for development being drawn up by the government and was completed by Christmas 2006. The proposals received outline planning consent from Birmingham City Council's Planning Department. In December 2006, Douglas Alexander revealed that the government were aware of the need for the redevelopment of New Street station however did not reveal what was being done. In February 2007, plans for the acquisition of Stephenson Tower through a Compulsory Purchase Order were discussed by the Cabinet. Martin Chambers, Programme Director for New Street at Network Rail, said in June 2007 that he expects the government to approve the first payment towards the project in mid-July. He expected Network Rail to announce a £122 million package on 18 July. On top of this, a further £136 million has to be paid by the Department for Transport, and £100 million from Advantage West Midlands must be approved by the Department of Trade and Industry. This was further supported by the leader of Birmingham City Council, Mike Whitby, who is also the Chairman of the New Street Gateway Steering Committee. Separate from this, the project received more support, this time from the shadow transport minister, Julian Brazier of the Conservative party. Following the announcement by Ruth Kelly for the £128 million funding package for New Street, it was stated that the station would be completed by 2015, later than the previous dates of 2012 and Spring 2013. In July 2007, the council were told in a letter from the Department for Transport to find a cheaper alternative for the redevelopment project to New Street station. This resulted in speculation over whether the Government were to grant the further two tranches of funding towards the project. Redesign The old 1960s interior design was rationalised and revamped in the Gateway Plus project. On 21 December 2007, Network Rail with RIBA Competitions issued a design contest notice on the Tenders Electronic Daily, supplement to the Official Journal of the European Union. The notice stated that the designs must be received by noon on 28 January 2008 with selected architects being invited to produce an architectural model on 11 February 2008. The design should include a new external façade and atrium. On 18 February 2008, the shortlist of six architectural design practices was released: *Rafael Viñoly *Foreign Office Architects *UNStudio *LAB Architecture *Idom UK *CRAB Studio The successful practice will act as concept architects, redesigning the station's exterior and creating a new atrium at a cost of about £30 million, while working alongside lead consultant Atkins and architect BDP. On 18 September 2008, London-based Foreign Office Architects were chosen as the concept architects for the New Street redesign, and will be working on the project alongside Atkins and BDP. Their design incorporates a large atrium which will allow the new concourse to \\"flood with light\\", given that a major complaint surrounding the current station is its lack of natural light. A reserved matters planning application was submitted for the design to Birmingham City Council on 20 November 2009. A public consultation period commenced immediately and ended on 31 December 2009. The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment gave the project its approval in January 2010, although warned that it could be \\"watered down\\" to cut costs. The application received approval from the Planning Committee on 4 February 2010. ==DesignJohn McAslan design=== {  align=\\"right\\" + Proposed land uses in outline application - ! Land use ! Area (m²) -  Retail  55,173 -  Offices  30,733 -  Residential  30,733 } The initial design for the station was produced by John McAslan + Partners in conjunction with engineers WSP Group, who were appointed in 2005. The design submitted for outline planning approval involved the demolition and replacement of the station's existing concrete façade with a curved glass frontage. All existing entrances were to remain, with a new entrance to be installed at Station Street. The plans were to flank the entrance on Station Street with two mixed-use 130m towers, on the site of Stephenson Tower. The existing glass \\"arrowheads\\" which are located on the Navigation Street elevation at the end of the platforms were to remain. The current station consists of five escalators and two lifts serving the station however, it was proposed to increase the number of escalators to 42 and lifts to 15. The demolition of part of the Pallasades Shopping Centre would allow for the construction of a glass roof to allow natural light to reach the concourse, which will be expanded by 350% to new 10,500 m². ===Foreign Office Architects design=== Foreign Office Architects were appointed following an international architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions. Their design differed massively from that of John McAslan. As proposed in the reserved matters application of November 2009, the internal concourse will be reconfigured and enlarged so that it is long from east to west. The new atrium will have an area of . New ticket barriers will allow passengers into one of three lounge areas. When their train arrives, they will be allowed onto the platforms to board the train. The platforms will be cleared of the existing waiting rooms and modernised. Holes will be cut in the floor of the concourse and filled with glass to allow light to pass from the concourse to platform level. The floor of the concourse will also be repaved. To allow natural light into the concourse, part of the Pallasades Shopping Centre will be demolished and three elongated glass domes will be constructed, reaching in height, with four glass skylights inserted between them. The interior of the concourse will be covered in seamless plaster. The exterior will be covered in a curved, stainless steel façade, said to be inspired by Birmingham's undulating skyline, that will rise to the top of the multi-storey car park. Eye-shaped LED screens will be installed on three of the corners of the building which will provide travel information. The new entrance at Station Street, as proposed by John McAslan + Partners will remain, with the facade at street level providing additional retail units. The existing retail units will also be redeveloped. There will also be extensive landscaping works around the station. The southern entrance at Station Street will form the main drop-off area for cars and taxis, allowing the existing drop-off area to be enclosed within the concourse. There are six voids above the railway tracks, and so as part of the proposals, the void adjacent to Queens Drive, to the east of the station, will be covered to create a new public square. A new walkway will be created from the Queens Drive entrance along the largest eastern void, around the back of the Odeon cinema to the Bull Ring. This will give visitors a direct and signed link to Birmingham Moor Street railway station. Most of the parapet walls to the voids will be redecorated with new cladding or art features, with the exception of those adjacent to the Signal Box which can only be cleaned. The number of escalators will be increased to 31, and lifts to 16, improving connectivity between the platforms and station concourse. ===Towers=== The outline planning application included plans for two tall mixed-use towers, flanking the Station Street entrance. The two glass towers were proposed to both be 30 storeys maximum and would be completely identical except for one tower will have a smaller footprint than the other. One tower will be residential whilst the other will be office. At least 10% of housing created within the proposed new towers would be reserved for affordable housing, below the city centre average of 15%. Earlier in 2006, there were reports of an extra 10 floors being added to the design. When the reserved matters application was submitted in November 2009, the towers were not included and it was noted that these would be subject of a separate planning application. It was reported in August 2009, that the plans for the towers was delayed due to the economic conditions. ===Other proposals=== In 2005, Arup headed a campaign for a new major railway station named Birmingham Grand Central to be built in the Eastside of Birmingham, however this vision did not materialise and politicians dismissed the need for the station. Also in 2005, British architect Will Alsop produced designs for New Street station, incorporating a glass roof. The designs were then commercially validated. Other proposals for alleviating the pressure on New Street station have also been suggested. These include the lengthening of trains, however, this has been criticised by Arup who claim that there are many stations that are unable to take trains any longer than they currently are. They used the Cross-City Line as an example, showing that stations can currently take a maximum of six carriages and that the lengthening proposals would increase train length to 12 carriages. ==Comments== A total of ten letters and one petition were submitted in response to the outline planning application. Three letters were in support of the planning application whilst one letter queried whether work would be carried out at night. ===Criticism=== The Stephenson Tower Residents Associations raised objections to the demolition of the tower block above the station. In February 2007, Arup called for the Birmingham Gateway proposals to be abandoned because it did not address rail capacity issues. Their report said that New Street station would reach its railway capacity by 2025 and further increases would be constrained by the bottleneck to the east of the station, where twelve tracks become four. Instead they proposed building a new \\"Grand Central station\\" to the east. This scheme was not considered by Network Rail or the government. On the Commons Transport Committee, a number of MPs raised similar concerns about railway capacity. This was reported on the BBC News Website on 21 July 2008. Other criticisms were towards the architecture of the station. The proposals have been attacked by councillors and planners who considered the designs to be of poor architectural quality and disputed whether the two towers were iconic enough. The reply from the architects were that the designs presented were only initial ideas. ===Objections=== Objections to the proposed twin towers were raised by the residents of Stephenson Tower, under the name \\"Stephenson Tower Residents Association\\" on the outline planning application. The group submitted a petition regarding the planning application. Stephenson Tower, a 20 storey tower block on New Street station, will be served with a compulsory purchase order and demolished as part of the project as one of the towers will partially cover the footprint of the building. The tower is on a long lease and administered by the City Council, with Network Rail having the freehold. Turley Associates wrote on behalf of Agora (Warner Estates) who are the leasehold owners of the Pallasades and car park which is sub-leased to National Car Parks. They were supportive of the principle of the development, however, feel the proposal should be amended to mitigate the loss of value on the shopping centre, improve pedestrian connectivity; reduce the scale of the void proposed within the shopping centre to provide direct pedestrian connections and provide additional retail floorspace. Therefore, they objected to the proposal at this stage. Donaldsons LLP, who were writing on behalf of the Birmingham Alliance, also responded with a holding objection to the proposals as concern has been raised in respect of the moving of the escalators which lead from the concourse level to the Pallasades Shopping Centre. They were also concerned over the work made to the entrance at Smallbrook Queensway. Savilles, on behalf of BT, lodged a holding objection on the basis that their facility on Hill Street is a sensitive location. It contains a significant amount of equipment which would be sensitive to dust. Much of this equipment is behind louvres, and could therefore be subject to dust, particularly through the construction period. ===Support=== Despite the criticism, the plans have also received considerable support. From the political spectrum, the project has received support from Tony Blair, the Conservative Party and from Gisela Stuart, MP for Birmingham Edgbaston, who said: > \\"The proposed redevelopment would not only be a catalyst for regional growth > and development but offer an excellent return on necessary investment.\\" In response to the planning application, English Heritage welcomed the proposals as it promises greater integration of the station into patterns of pedestrian flow around the city centre, and therefore benefit the appreciation of Birmingham's historic environment. The Conservation and Heritage Panel of Birmingham City Council echoed this as well as stressing the need for high quality design. ==Funding== When completed, it is expected to have cost over £550 million. The financing for the project depends upon a mixture of public and private funding. Private funding will account for £150 million whilst the rest will be publicly funded. The four key funding partners for the project are: *Network Rail *Birmingham City Council *Advantage West Midlands *Centro In May 2006, outline funding applications were submitted to Government agencies including the Department for Transport. Gateway Plus has been subject to uncertainty in funding, a problem Mike Whitby claimed to have been responsible for removing in early October 2006. However, a report later said that the financial part of the project had already been secured before he came to power as the leader of Birmingham City Council. In March 2007, Birmingham City Council was given an additional £40 million by the Government after they described the West Midlands Local Transport Plan being scored as \\"excellent\\". £3 million of this was put towards the Gateway Plus project. A £128 million funding package was announced by British Government for the Gateway Plus project in July 2007. It was announced by Ruth Kelly, the Transport Secretary, when she unveiled a government White Paper Delivering a Sustainable Railway, which also includes the upgrading of 150 further stations. This is the first of three tranches of funding required for the development. The other two tranches of funding total £223 million. In October 2007, it was reported by the Birmingham Mail that the Comprehensive Spending Review by Alastair Darling would confirm the remaining funding for Gateway Plus. This came as concerns were raised that the government would refuse to provide the remaining tranches of funding. However, Alastair Darling failed to mention the project in his Pre-Budget Speech to the House of Commons, instead mentioning the Crossrail project for the South East of England, provoking fury among business leaders who accused Prime Minister Gordon Brown of dithering. Rod Ackrill, President of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce and group chairman of developer Chase Midland, demanded the government to provide the necessary funding for the project and said he expected a decision by Christmas Day, 2007. On 12 February 2008, Secretary of State for Transport Ruth Kelly announced that the Department for Transport will be providing £160 million on top of the £128 million that is to be provided through the railway White Paper. A further £100 million will be provided by the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and will be channelled through Advantage West Midlands, the regional development agency. The announcement brought the total amount of Government spending on the project to £388 million. In total, £100 million will be given by Advantage West Midlands, £288 million from the Department of Transport, £100 million from the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, £128 million from Network Rail and £10 million from Centro. There will be additional funding from the private sector. Network Rail is also investing £350 million in renewing the signalling systems through New Street station and the West Midlands over the next ten years. The Chancellor George Osborne confirmed in his June 2010 budget that central government funding for the redevelopment would still be provided despite the economic downturn. ==Project management== The project has been split into two phases since its approval in 2003. The New Street Gateway Steering Committee, chaired by Mike Whitby, is a committee dedicated to getting the plans to materialise. The council's project manager for Gateway Plus is David Pywell, who was also the Strategic Director of Development for Birmingham City Council before retiring in September 2006. Network Rail announced in 2005 that it will be setting up an entrepreneurial team that will work with developers and investors working on the project. In April 2009, Network Rail announced that Chris Montgomery had been appointed as managing director of the project. Atkins is the lead consultant on the project and Mace Group will be providing construction and logistics management, which will involve monitoring of track possessions, night working and the placement of hoardings for minimum disruption, as well as being the principal contractor. ==Impact== It is claimed that the redevelopment of the station would result in £2.3 billion being invested into the West Midlands region. The redevelopment of New Street is expected to accommodate passenger growth to at least 2046, depending on the accuracy of the growth predictions. Between 2,200 and 3,200 permanent jobs will be created as a result of the redevelopment with further jobs being created during the construction work at the station. The new station will be an improved transport destination for tourists and is a key part of the redevelopment of Birmingham by improving the city image. ==Images of the station's architectural historyImages of the pre-1960s era station=== File:Original-new-street.jpgThe station looking east from Brunel Street File:Newstreetold.jpgThe station in 1885 File:Victorian New Street.jpgThe station in 1885.

They were largely devoted to 19th-century causes. Many touched on religious themes. Initially they were royalist but soon became Bonapartist, Republican and liberal. Hugo's poems on nature revealed a continuing search for the great sublime. Like many young writers of his generation, Hugo was profoundly influenced by François-René de Chateaubriand, the founder of Romanticism and France's pre-eminent literary figure during the early 1800s. In his youth, Hugo resolved to be \\"Chateaubriand or nothing\\", and his life would come to parallel that of his predecessor's in many ways. Like Chateaubriand, Hugo would further the cause of Romanticism, become involved in politics as a champion of Republicanism, and be forced into exile due to his political stances. Between 1829 and 1840 he would publish five more volumes of poetry (Les Orientales, 1829; Les Feuilles d'automne, 1831; Les Chants du crépuscule, 1835; Les Voix intérieures, 1837; and Les Rayons et les ombres, 1840), cementing his reputation as one of the greatest elegiac and lyric poets of his time. The passion and eloquence of Hugo's early work brought success and fame at an early age. His first collection of poetry (Nouvelles Odes et Poésies Diverses) was published in 1824, when Hugo was only twenty two years old, and earned him a royal pension from Louis XVIII. Though the poems were admired for their spontaneous fervor and fluency, it was the collection that followed two years later in 1826 (Odes et Ballades) which revealed Hugo to be a great poet, a natural master of lyric and creative song. ==CollectionsPoems published during Hugo's lifetime=== * Odes et poésies diverses (1822) * Nouvelles Odes (1824) * Odes et Ballades (1828, a collection of poems written between 1822 and 1828) * Les Orientales (1829) * Les Feuilles d'automne (1831) * Les Chants du crépuscule (1835) * Les Voix intérieures (1837) * Les Rayons et les Ombres (1840) * Les Châtiments (1853, a collection of poems attacking Napoleon III) * Les Contemplations (1856, dealt with the death of his daughter and the pain of exile) * La Légende des siècles (Part One 1859, recounting man's struggle throughout history) * Les Chansons des rues et des bois (1865) * L'Année terrible (1872, about the Franco-Prussian War, the death of his son Charles, and the Paris Commune) * L'Art d'être grand-père (1877, about being the guardian of his orphaned grandchildren) * La Légende des siècles (Part Two 1877) * Le Pape (1878, a condemnation of Pius IX) * La Pitié suprême (1879) * Religions et religion (1880) * L'Âne (1880) * Les Quatre Vents de l'esprit (1881) * Final part of La Légende des Siècles (1883) ===Posthumous collections=== * La Fin de Satan (1886) * Dieu (1891) * 1941 (1891) ===Posthumous collections selected from Hugo's manuscripts=== * Toute la Lyre (1888, 1893, 1897, 1935-1937) * Les Années funestes (1898) * Dernière Gerbe (1902, 1941, the title is not Hugo's own) * Océan, Tas de pierres (1942) * Le Verso de la page (1960) * Œuvres d'enfance et de jeunesse, 1814-20 (juvenilia, 1964) ==External links== * Geoffrey Barto's translations * EveryPoet * Victor Hugo Central ","title":"Poems of Victor Hugo"},{"id":"6202487","text":"The Duggan–Schwartz theorem (named after John Duggan and Thomas Schwartz) is a result about voting systems designed to choose a nonempty set of winners from the preferences of certain individuals, where each individual ranks all candidates in order of preference. It states that for three or more candidates, at least one of the following must hold: #The system is not anonymous (some voters are treated differently from others). #The system is imposed (some candidates can never win). #Every voter's top preference is in the set of winners. #The system can be manipulated by either an optimistic voter, one who can cast a ballot that would elect some candidate better than all of those elected by voting honestly; or by a pessimistic voter, one who can cast a ballot that would exclude some candidate worse than all of those elected by voting strategically. The first two conditions are considered forbidden in any fair election, and the third condition requires many candidates to \\"tie\\" for the win. The general conclusion, then, is the same as that usually given to the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem: voting systems can be manipulated. The result essentially holds even if ties are allowed in the ballots; in that case, there exists at least one \\"weak dictator\\" such that at least one of the candidates tied at the top of that voter's ballot is a winner. The Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem is a similar theorem that deals with voting systems that elect a single winner. Likewise, Arrow's impossibility theorem deals with voting systems that yield a complete preference order of the candidates, rather than choosing only winners. ==References== *J. Duggan and T.

As a child, she bought her younger brother, Bobby Fischer, his first chess set and taught him how to play the game. ==Early life== Joan Fischer was born in Moscow, Soviet Union in 1937 to Hans-Gerhardt Fischer, a German-born biophysicist, and his wife, Regina Wender Fischer, a Swiss-born naturalized American citizen of Russian-Jewish and Polish-Jewish ancestry. Regina Fischer left Moscow because of the persecution of Jews in the 1930s, bringing her child with her to the United States. She spoke seven languages fluently and was a teacher, registered nurse and eventually a physician. After living in several cities in various parts of the United States, in 1948 the family moved to Brooklyn, where Regina worked as an elementary school teacher and nurse. One year later, in Brooklyn, Targ taught her younger brother, future chess world champion Bobby Fischer, to play chess. ==Proponent of computer education== Targ founded a number of programs to study the teaching of computer literacy, including programs in the Palo Alto Unified School District,. as well as the Institute of Microcomputing in Education at Stanford University.. Her educational techniques included the creation of peer tutoring systems whereby a student, trained by peers in a basic course in computer programming, would then tutor the next students. In the early 1980s, she created and led a programs sponsored by Stanford University in which elementary school teachers were taught the basics of programming by high school students.. One focus of her work was bringing computer literacy to girls, senior citizens, and other groups that were underrepresented in computing. She coauthored the book Ready, run, fun: IBM PC edition with Jeff Levinsky. ==Personal life== Targ later lived in Palo Alto, California and Portola Valley, receiving a Masters degree in education from the College of Notre Dame, Belmont, California. Her husband, Russell Targ, worked at SRI International as a parapsychologist, and her daughter, Elisabeth, also became a parapsychologist.. This page from the preface quotes Martin Gardner writing in The Skeptical Inquirer in 2001: \\"William Targ's beliefs in the paranormal trickled down to his son Russell, and now they have descended on Russell's attractive and energetic daughter Elisabeth. Her mother, Joan, by the way, is the sister of chess grandmaster Bobby Fischer.\\" Joan Targ was noted for her activism for organic farming, having built an organic farm soon after she married Russell in 1958. In 1976, she, her husband, and another family bought 80 acres of land in Portola Valley they hoped to turn into another such farm; a lawsuit from her neighbors attempting to block this use was settled in her favor shortly before her death. ==Death== Joan Fischer Targ died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Portola Valley at the age of 60 in 1998.. ==ReferencesAdditional sources== * Anything to Win: The Mad Genius of Bobby Fischer, television documentary, produced by Frank Sinton and Anthony Storm * Category:1937 births Category:1998 deaths Category:People from Brooklyn Category:20th-century American educators Category:American people of Russian- Jewish descent Category:American people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:Notre Dame de Namur University alumni Category:Stanford Graduate School of Education faculty Category:People from Palo Alto, California Category:Disease-related deaths in California ","title":"Joan Targ"},{"id":"6202590","text":" The Beechcraft Premier I is a light business jet aircraft manufactured by the Beechcraft division of Hawker Beechcraft.

The aircraft was officially launched at the annual National Business Aviation Association Convention in September 1995 and construction of the first prototype commenced late in 1996. In the mid-1990s, the light jet was to be priced at $5 million. The Premier I prototype was rolled out on 19 August 1998 and its first flight was on 22 December 1998; four prototypes were used in the flight test program. Its FAA Type Certificate was issued on 23 March 2001. After development delays, the aircraft entered service in 2001 but with poor runway performance, erratic lift dump and brakes, a noisy cabin and substandard cockpit. It was upgraded as the Premier IA in 2006 for $7 million with better brakes, avionics and cabin, and 163 were built in five years. It was certified on 22 September 2005.

Company Chairman and CEO Bill Boisture stated: \\"While we remain fully committed to certifying and fielding the class-leading Premier II as designed, we must be prudent in our evaluation of the current and forecasted global economic environment. Based on these conditions, we have made the decision to extend the entry-into-service date to better align with anticipated rebound of the business jet market.\\" In October 2010, Hawker Beechcraft announced that the Premier II had rebranded and upgraded as the Hawker 200.Hawker Beechcraft Launches Hawker 200 In December 2011 the company announced that it was slowing down development of the Hawker 200 jet due to the uncertain state of the economy.

She also co-wrote all the lyrics of the Ayreon album The Theory of Everything, again with Lucassen. In 2010, Linstruth announced on her blog she was taking a \\"guitar sabbatical\\" to focus on other pursuits, such as dog-training, citing a loss of enthusiasm. == Personal life == She currently resides in the Netherlands where she lives with her partner and musical collaborator Arjen Anthony Lucassen; she previously lived in Sweden. In a 2017 interview, Lucassen mentioned that, in addition to her work with him, she was also an English teacher. == Biography Warbride=== Linstruth first came to prominence in the late 1980s when she was featured in Mike Varney's \\"Spotlight\\" column in Guitar Player magazine. She moved from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles and, after a short stint in local band Jaded Lady, formed Warbride along with former Rude Girl drummer Sandy Sledge. Linstruth left Warbride in order to move to Sweden with her then husband and the band continued for a brief period with only one original member, keyboard player Velia Garay.

By late 2007, Lori left Sweden and headed for the Netherlands where she became Lucassen's manager. In February 2009, it was announced that Linstruth would contribute to Lucassen's latest project, Guilt Machine, as a guitarist and lyricist. In 2010 Linstruth announced in her blog that she had lost her passion of playing guitar and instead would concentrate on dog training. ==Musical style== While Linstruth herself promotes Rammstein as one of her main influences, she is also known to be influenced by Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker and Yngwie J.

He was traded to the New York Yankees after being relegated to the Kansas City bullpen during the 1961 season. The move impaired his effectiveness as a pitcher. Frank Lane was responsible for trading Daley to the Athletics and then to the Yankees. ==Right arm== Daley's right arm is one inch shorter than his left, and he is unable to fully straighten it. It is often rumoured that Daley was born naturally right-handed but developed polio as a child, \\"withering\\" his right arm. In fact Daley was born left-handed and his right arm and side are healthy. He did suffer temporary paralysis to his right arm after birth due to forceps pinching a nerve. However, massage and exercise restored the limb to health. Daley's mother, Mrs. E.G. Petzoldt, once said, \\"No one wanted a baby more than I did. But Buddy was so crippled I didn't want him to live.\\" Although he could barely raise it high enough to comb his hair,\\"Looking For A Sleeper\\", Pasadena Star-News, October 4, 1961, Page 25. Daley himself says that he has been living with it all his life without feeling handicapped a bit. In fact, Daley served as a fifth infielder, was competitive as a batter, shot golf in the low 80s, and was a proficient fisherman. ==References== * ==External links== * Baseball Almanac Category:1932 births Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Baseball players from California Category:Sportspeople from Orange, California Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Kansas City Athletics players Category:New York Yankees players Category:San Diego Padres (minor league) players Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Wilson Classical High School alumni ","title":"Bud Daley"},{"id":"6202626","text":"is a Japanese go term also commonly used among Western players. It describes ignoring a local sequence on the board in order to play elsewhere. The maneuver is related to the concepts of sente, or taking the initiative, and gote, deferring to the opponent by responding to the last play. A player will tenuki when they feel that their opponent's last move does not pose an urgent threat, and they judge that playing elsewhere would be to their advantage. Experienced players try to control the flow of the game by making moves that leave them with effective follow-ups, thus forcing the opponent to respond. They look for weaknesses in the opponent's position and wait for a chance to tenuki so they can exploit those weaknesses. Novice players are less consistent, sometimes jumping carelessly away from situations in a risky way, and on other occasions being reluctant to play tenuki, a failing identified as following the opponent around. A player may also tenuki even though the opponent's last move is somewhat damaging, if they feel that their play will be even more damaging to the opponent. They would be willing to accept the loss they anticipate, because they expect a greater gain from the move they make instead of answering. Players also tenuki when they believe that the opponent will be required to answer. If this happens, they can then go back and answer the previous move. ==External links== * Sensei's Library page on tenuki Category:Go (game) ","title":"Tenuki"},{"id":"6202636","text":"Charles Porterfield Krauth (March 17, 1823 – January 2, 1883) was a pastor, theologian and educator in the Lutheran branch of Christianity. He is a leading figure in the revival of the Lutheran Confessions connected to Neo- Lutheranism in the United States. == Education and parish ministry == Born in Martinsburg, Virginia to minister Charles Philip Krauth. Young Krauth graduated from Gettysburg College (then called Pennsylvania College) in 1839 (while his father served as that school's president), and two years later from the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg. From 1841-1852, the younger Rev. Krauth served congregations in Baltimore, Maryland, Martinsburg, and Winchester, Virginia.http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1800s/krauth_chas_p.html During the winter of 1853-54, for three months he served the Dutch Reformed congregation in Saint Thomas in the Virgin Islands, where he was visiting on account of his wife's illness. Krauth later published a sketch of this visit entitled A Winter and Spring in the Danish West Indies. Upon returning, Krauth was called to congregations in Pittsburgh from 1855 to 1859, and Philadelphia from 1859 to 1861. == The Confessional Revival == In 1861, Krauth resigned from parish ministry to serve full-time as editor of The Lutheran, a theological journal. One of The Lutheran’s goals was to restore the confessions of faith found in the Book of Concord to prominence in Lutheran church life. These documents, especially the Augsburg Confession, have always been identified as the cornerstones of a distinctively Lutheran theological identity. But during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Lutherans in the United States had interpreted the confessions very loosely. A key figure in this movement was Samuel Simon Schmucker, one of Krauth’s professors at Gettysburg, whose “American Lutheranism” as outlined in the Definite Synodical platform of 1855, proposed that the Augsburg Confession was mistaken on such questions as Baptismal Regeneration and the Real Presence in the Eucharist. In contrast, Krauth and his collaborators (who eventually included his own father and Beale Melanchthon Schmucker, the son of Samuel Simon) preferred a more literal reading of the Lutheran Confessions. They saw Martin Luther’s theology not as a radical rejection of traditional patristic and medieval theology, but as an essentially conservative return to first principles. In both theology and worship, they sought to create Lutheranism in which the medieval heritage was more readily apparent than the Enlightenment adaptations. For example, one of Krauth’s major books, “The Conservative Reformation and its Theology,” is an extended defense of the Real Presence. Krauth was personally influenced by his reading of the Mercersburg theologians, John Williamson Nevin and Philip Schaff, who had attempted a similar repristination of Calvinist theology within the American branch of the German Reformed Church. Nevin and Schaff had called themselves “evangelical catholics,” a term which has come to be used rarely, if at all, among the Reformed churches, but quite commonly among Lutherans. (Church, 226-229). Similar revival movements like Neo-Lutheranism took place in the early nineteenth century among Roman Catholics and Anglicans, as for example in Guéranger’s re-founding of the abbey at Solesmes, and in the Oxford Movement.Franklin, passim. European Lutheranism had a similar revival, led by theologians and pastors such as Wilhelm Loehe. == The General Council == Conflict between the “American Lutherans” and the leaders of the confessional revival led to a schism. In 1864, Krauth was asked to lead the new seminary in Philadelphia, which was founded by churches of the Pennsylvania Ministerium to rival the seminary in Gettysburg (now known as the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, LTSP). In 1867, Krauth and his schoolmate Rev. William Passavant founded the General Council of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The General Council had seven regional bodies which had withdrawn from the General Synod. During Krauth's lifetime, the LTSP was at Franklin Square. In 1889 it moved to Mount Airy. In 1908 its new library there was dedicated as the Krauth Memorial Library in memory of Krauth. As the first professor of systematic theology at the new seminary, Krauth was at the intellectual center of the reform movement. He wrote its Fundamental Articles of Faith and Church Polity, as well as the constitutions for its congregations. His liturgical scholarship guided the formation of General Council worship materials. From 1868, Krauth also served as professor of mental and moral philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, and from 1873 as vice-provost. One of Krauth’s most controversial acts was to prepare a series of theses on pulpit and altar fellowship. Called the “Akron-Galesburg Rule,” these may be summarized as saying “Lutheran pulpits are for Lutheran ministers only, and Lutheran altars are for Lutheran communicants only.” Although Krauth’s Rule permitted exceptions, it was nonetheless a strong repudiation of the broad ecumenical relationships pursued by the General Synod. == Late travels == In 1880 he went to Europe to visit the scenes of the life and labors of Martin Luther, in order to complete a biography, for which he had made extensive preparations. His death prevented completion of the project. == Literary works == * The Conservative Reformation and its Theology, his most significant work (Philadelphia, 1872) * Tholuck's Commentary on the Gospel of John, translator (1859) * Christian Liberty in Relation to the Usages of the Evangelical Lutheran Church Maintained and Defended (1860) * William Fleming's Vocabulary of Philosophy, editor, contributing an introduction and additions (1860; 2d ed.: (Vocabulary of the Philosophical Sciences), enlarged, New York, 1877) * The Augsburg Confession, translator, contributing a historical introduction, notes, and index (Philadelphia, 1868) * \\"Infant Baptism and Infant Salvation in the Calvinistic System,\\" a review of Hodge's Systematic Theology (1874) * Ulrici's Review of Strauss (1874) * Berkeley's Principles, Prolegomena, Notes of Ueberweg, and Original Annotations (1874) * Chronicle of the Augsburg Confession (1878) Krauth also wrote poems, translated hymns from the Latin and German, and was a frequent contributor to religious periodicals. ==Notes References == * Bowden, Henry Warner.

Both creations are extinct. The Knightley family originated at the Staffordshire manor of Knightley, acquired by them shortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066. In 1415 Sir Richard Knightley purchased the manor of Fawsley in Northamptonshire, where the senior line of the family became seated.Mark Noble, Memoirs of the Protectoral-house of Cromwell, Volume 2, London, 1787, pp.91-8, Knightley, p.91 The Knightley Baronetcy, of Offchurch in the County of Warwick, was created in the Baronetage of England on 30 August 1660 for John Knightley, of a junior branch of the Knightley family seated at Offchurch Bury. The title became extinct on the death of the second Baronet in 1689. The Knightley Baronetcy, of Fawsley in the County of Northampton, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 2 February 1798 for John Knightley, with remainder to the male issue of his deceased younger brother Reverend Charles Knightley. He was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baronet. He sat as Member of Parliament for Northamptonshire South. On his death the title passed to his son, the third Baronet. He also represented Northamptonshire South in the House of Commons. On 23 August 1892 he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Knightley, of Fawsley in the County of Northampton. Lord Knightley was childless and on his death in 1895 the barony became extinct. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his first cousin, the fourth Baronet. He was the son of Reverend Henry Knightley (1786–1813), younger brother of the second Baronet. He never married and was succeeded by his nephew, the fifth Baronet. He was the son of Reverend Henry Charles Knightley (1823–1884), younger brother of the fourth Baronet. Knightley was a member of the Northamptonshire County Council. He was childless and on his death the title passed to his younger brother, the sixth Baronet. He was a clergyman. He was also childless and on his death in 1938 the baronetcy became extinct. Valentine Knightley (1718–1754), father of the first Baronet, was Member of Parliament for Northampton between 1748 and 1754. The ancestral seat of the Knightley family was Fawsley in Northamptonshire.

He commences his pupillage in the chambers of Mr Kendall Grimes, but finds he learns more from Henry, his colleague, and fellow pupils Peter and Charles, to say nothing of Alec, the chambers clerk. Although supposed to 'shadow' Grimes, he finds himself on his feet before a judge within a few days, all at sea on a knotty legal point. Roger lives with his slightly vague widowed mother, and also balances the affections of two girlfriends, Sally and Joy. Joy obtains his first brief for him from her uncle, a solicitor; an undefended divorce case, which Roger manages to lose, to the lady's fury. Roger slowly gains more experience and confidence. He is given a 'dock brief', a case of fraud. Despite the odd behaviour of his client, Roger gets him off. As his period as a pupil comes to its end, Henry leaves to take a position in another set of chambers, and Roger considers joining him. ==AdaptationsTelevision and film=== In 1957 the book was made into a film starring Ian Carmichael and Terry-Thomas directed by Roy Boulting. A curiosity about this film is that Eric Barker won a BAFTA as 'Most Promising Newcomer' for his role as a barrister's clerk, even though he had appeared in a number of other films, and had enjoyed an illustrious radio career. In 1962, Frank Muir and Denis Norden adapted the book as a television series featuring an early performance by Richard Briers in the leading role, though Richard Waring wrote five of the thirteen episodes. The series also spawned a spin-off Mr Justice Duncannon, also written by Cecil. ===Radio=== There were also two radio adaptations, one in 1955 starring Donald Sinden, and in 1970 in which Briers reprised the role. The latter radio series by the BBC ran for thirty nine episodes in three series. They were adaptations by Richard Waring of the TV series. The cast included John Glyn-Jones (Grimes, Roger's pupil master) with Julia Lockwood (Sally) and Bridget Armstrong (Joy) as the women in Roger's life. ==External links== * Comedy Guide * * * Brothers In Law at British TV Comedy * Category:1955 British novels Category:1955 radio programme debuts Category:1970 radio programme debuts Category:BBC Radio comedy programmes Category:British comedy novels Category:British novels adapted into films Category:Law in fiction Category:Radio programmes based on novels Category:Michael Joseph books ","title":"Brothers in Law (novel)"},{"id":"6202720","text":"Trafficability is the ability of a given vehicle to traverse a specified terrain.

Baron Blythswood, of Blythswood in the County of Renfrew, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 24 August 1892 for Sir Archibald Campbell, 1st Baronet, the former Member of Parliament for Renfrew, with remainder failing heirs male of his own to five of his younger brothers and the heirs male of their bodies (one brother, Robert Douglas-Campbell, was excluded from inheriting the title). Sir Archibald had already gained that style by being created a baronet (formally of Blythswood in the County of Renfrew, in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom) on 4 May 1880. ==Ancestry== Born Archibald Douglas, the first holder was the son of Archibald Douglas, 17th feudal Scots baron of Mains and 12th feudal baron of Blythswood, a patrilineal descendant of James Douglas (who had assumed by Royal licence the surname of Douglas in lieu of Campbell), son of John Campbell and Mary, daughter and heiress of John Douglas of Mains. However John himself was also landed as the son of Colin Campbell, 1st feudal Scots Baron of Blythswood and that estate passed to another branch of the family. The British 1st Baron Blythswood's father was born Archibald Douglas but assumed his new patronymic on 1838 on inheriting the Blythswood estate on the death of his cousin, Archibald Campbell. ==Succession== Lord Blythswood was childless and on his death in 1908 the baronetcy became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony according to the special remainder by his younger brother Reverend Sholto Douglas. On becoming the next Lord Blythswood he too assumed by Royal licence the surname of Campbell in lieu of his patronymic. He was also childless and was succeeded by his younger brother Barrington Douglas-Campbell, the third Baron. He was a Major-General in the British Army. He and his son had assumed the additional surname of Campbell by Royal licence in 1908 but on his succession to the barony in 1916 he assumed the surname of Campbell only by Royal licence. On his death the title passed to his eldest son, the fourth Baron. He was a Brigade Major in the British Army. As follows, on succeeding in the barony on the death of his father in 1918 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Campbell only. He had no sons and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Baron. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Baron. He assumed by Royal licence the surname of Douglas-Campbell in 1929 but on succeeding in the barony in 1937 he assumed the surname of Campbell only by Royal licence. The title became extinct on the early death of his son, the seventh Baron, in 1940 due to a car accident. ==Estates== The principal home had been until the early 20th century Blythswood House, named after the vast estates in Glasgow which an ancestor started to feu off in the 1800s including Blythswood Hill and Blythswood Square to William Harley and other developers. The first baron, who served in Westminster's Houses of Parliament in the Commons as an MP and later as with subsequent generations in the Lords acquired the old manor house of Halliford in Shepperton which is where in the year of his death he has a large tablet monument in the church chancel by the Thames. ==Campbell Baronets, of Blythswood (1880)== *Sir Archibald Campbell, 1st Baronet (1835-1908) (extinct on death of 1st Baron) (created Baron Blythswood in 1892) ==Barons Blythswood (1892)== *Archibald Campbell, 1st Baron Blythswood (1835-1908) *Sholto Campbell, 2nd Baron Blythswood (1839-1916), brother of the above *Maj Gen Barrington Bulkeley Campbell, 3rd Baron Blythswood (1845-1918), brother of the above *Major Archibald Douglas, 4th Baron Blythswood (1870-1929) son of the above *Barrington Sholto Douglas Campbell/Campbell, 5th Baron Blythswood (1877-1937) brother of the above *Leopold Colin Henry Douglas Campbell/Campbell, 6th Baron Blythswood (1881-1940) brother of the above *Philip Archibald Douglas Campbell/Campbell, 7th Baron Blythswood (1919-1940) ==Recognition== The merchant convoy ship \\"SS Baron Blythswood\\" under chief officer William Simpson Ure was sunk by U-99 in 1940. ==References== * Category:Extinct baronies in the Peerage of the United Kingdom Category:Noble titles created in 1892 Category:Noble titles created for UK MPs Category:Peerages created with special remainders ","title":"Baron Blythswood"},{"id":"6202726","text":"The Mission River is a river located in Texas, in the United States of America. It is formed by the confluence of Blanco and Medio creeks in central Refugio County (at 28°19' N, 97°19' W) and runs southeast, past Refugio, for to its mouth on Mission Bay, an inlet of Copano Bay (at 28°10' N, 97°10' W). It traverses gently undulating coastal prairies surfaced by clay and loam and spotted by groves of hardwoods and pines. It is home to myriad waterfowl and native slough grasses. ==History== In 1795, Spanish friars relocated Nuestra Señora del Refugio Mission from a site near the junction of the Guadalupe River and San Antonio Rivers to the banks of the Mission River, a move that probably gave the river its name. On March 14, 1836, during the Texas Revolution, a detachment of Texans under Amon B. King took a defensive position in one of the groves along the riverbank and repulsed repeated attacks of Mexican General José de Urrea's troops during the Battle of Refugio. Because the day's fighting nearly exhausted their supplies of gunpowder, King ordered his men to escape that night by swimming across the Mission River; they thus wetted the little powder that remained. The next day a party of Urrea's men overtook and captured King and his troops.

The stated reasons for the golpe were the alleged desire of President Guevara to extend his term beyond that established by Congress in order to enact long-term measures designed to stave off a growing economic crisis. Far more likely, it was a traditional right- wing coup staged by officers who had served in the long dictatorship of General Hugo Banzer (1971–78) and who had much to lose by an ongoing congressional investigation of alleged criminal and economic misdeeds committed during the \\"Banzerato.\\" In any case, the population resisted the Natusch coup rather heroically, led by a nationwide labor strike called by the Central Obrera Boliviana (COB) of Juan Lechín. ===Failure of coup after 16 days=== In the end, Natusch was able to occupy the Palacio Quemado for only sixteen days, after which he was forced to give up his quixotic struggle.

A subscription library (also membership library or independent library) is a library that is financed by private funds either from membership fees or endowments. Unlike a public library, access is often restricted to members, but access rights can also be given to non-members, such as students. ==Origins== The British Museum was established in 1751 and had a library containing over 50,000 books. In the 18th century, there were virtually no public libraries in the sense in which we now understand the term i.e. libraries provided from public funds and freely accessible to all.Kelly, Thomas (1966); p. 185 Only one important library in Britain, Chetham's Library in Manchester, was fully and freely accessible to the public. However, during the century, there came into being a whole network of library provision on a private or institutional basis. The increase in secular literature at this time encouraged the establishment of commercial subscription libraries. Many small, private book clubs evolved into subscription libraries, charging high annual fees or requiring subscribing members to purchase shares. Subscription libraries would in turn use these earnings to expand their collections and later create their own publications. Unlike a public library, access was often restricted to members. Some of the earliest such institutions were founded in late-17th century England, such as Chetham's Library in 1653, Innerpeffray Library in 1680 and Thomas Plume's Library in 1704. In the American colonies, the Library Company of Philadelphia was started in 1731 by Benjamin Franklin in Philadelphia, PA. By paying an initial fee and annual dues, members had access to books, maps, fossils, antique coins, minerals, and scientific instruments. The first subscription library in Canada was formed in the 1800s at Niagara. The materials available to subscribers tended to focus on particular subject areas, such as biography, history, philosophy, theology, and travel, rather than works of fiction, particularly the novel. Subscription libraries were democratic in nature; created by and for communities of local subscribers who aimed to establish permanent collections of books and reading materials, rather than selling their collections annually as the circulating libraries tended to do, in order to raise funds to support their other commercial interests. Even though the subscription libraries were often founded by reading societies, committees, elected by the subscribers, chose books for the collection that were general, rather than aimed at a particular religious, political or professional group. The books selected for the collection were chosen because they would be mutually beneficial to the shareholders. The committee also selected the librarians who would manage the circulation of materials. Subscription libraries were also referred to as 'proprietary' libraries due to the expectation that subscribers not only pay an annual fee, but that they must also invest in shares. These shares could be transferred by sale, gift or bequest. Many could not afford to purchase shares to become a member, even though they may have belonged to reading clubs. ===Circulating libraries=== Circulating library and stationery shop, Gulgong, Australia 1870. The increasing production and demand for fiction promoted by rising literacy rates and the expansion of commercial markets, led to the rise of circulating libraries, which met a need that subscription libraries did not fulfill. William Bathoe opened his commercial venture at two locations in London in 1737, and claimed to have been 'the Original Circulating library'. An early circulating library may even have been established in the mid-17th century; in an edition of \\"Tom Tyler and his Wife\\" in 1661 Francis Kirkman included a catalogue of 690 plays which he claimed to be ready to lend \\"upon reasonable considerations\\" from his premises in Westminster. Circulating libraries charged subscription fees to users and offered serious subject matter as well as the popular novels, thus the difficulty in clearly distinguishing circulating from subscription libraries. Occasionally subscription libraries called themselves 'circulating libraries', and vice versa. > \\"Many ordinary circulating libraries might call themselves 'subscription' > libraries because they charged a subscription, while the earliest private > subscription libraries, such as Leeds, Warrington, or Liverpool, describe > themselves as 'circulating' libraries in their titles. Since many > circulating libraries called themselves after the town where they were > situated, it is often difficult to distinguish the type of a particular > library, especially since many are only known to posterity from a surviving > book label, with nothing but the name as identification\\".Manley, K.A. > \\"Booksellers, peruke-makers, and rabbit-merchants: the growth of circulating > libraries in the eighteenth century.\\" Libraries and the Book Trade: The > formation of collections from the sixteenth to the twentieth century. Ed. > Myers. New Castle, Delaware: Oak Knoll Press, 2000, p. 39. In Britain there were more than 200 commercial circulating libraries open in 1800, more than twice the number of subscription and private proprietary libraries that were operating at the same time. Many proprietors pandered to the most fashionable clientele, making much ado about the sort of shop they offered, the lush interiors, plenty of room and long hours of service. \\"These 'libraries' would be called rental collections today.\\" With the advent of free public libraries in the 19th century, most subscription libraries were replaced or taken over by the governing authorities. ===Learned societies=== In London, numerous scientific dabblers, amateurs, professionals concentrated in the comparatively small geographic area began to form a unique development - the learned society: > \\"These societies are voluntary associations of men and women who have come > together because they are interested in the aims and objects which the > societies serve and they feel that they can pursue those interests better as > members of a society, rather than as individuals. The libraries therefore > have been collected together for the purpose of serving the objects to which > the various societies are dedicated and they do this, for the most part, by > serving their members\\". Learned society libraries were private but were owned by larger groups of people. Materials were often lent or borrowed by qualified individuals or institutions outside the society. Societies were concerned mainly with the sciences, physical and biological, and often cooperated with other groups like the Royal Society. Exclusive subscription libraries, the world's oldest being the Chemical Society in London, was founded in 1841 for the general advancement of chemistry. Its primary objective was to guide and direct original research in chemistry and to disseminate that knowledge through debates, lectures and its own journal. ==Current membership librariesAustralia=== * 1833: Sydney Mechanics' School of Arts * 1839: Melbourne Athenaeum ===Canada=== Atwater Library of the Mechanics Institute of Montreal * 1828: Atwater Library of the Mechanics' Institute of Montreal ===Ireland=== * 1922: Central Catholic Library ===United Kingdom=== * 1653: Chetham's Library * 1680: Innerpeffray Library * 1704: Thomas Plume's Library * 1741: The Leadhills Miners' Library * 1768: Leeds Library * 1788: Linen Hall Library * 1793: The Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne * 1793: Westerkirk Parish Library * 1797: The Athenaeum (Liverpool) * 1799: Tavistock Subscription Library * 1800: Langholm Library * 1806: Portico Library * 1810: Plymouth Proprietary Library * 1812: Plymouth Athenaeum Library * 1813: Devon and Exeter Institution * 1816: Nottingham Subscription Library * 1818: Morrab Library * 1824: Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution * 1824: Ipswich Institute Reading Room and Library * 1832: Bradford Mechanics' Institute Library * 1832: Saffron Walden Town Library Society * 1834: Guildford Institute of the University of Surrey * 1839: Highgate Literary and Scientific Institution * 1841: London Library * 1854: Birmingham and Midland Institute * 1889: Saint Deiniol's Residential Library * 1894: Bishopsgate Institute * 1912: Armitt Library * 1928: Sybil Campbell Library ===United States=== * 1731: Library Company of Philadelphia * 1747: Redwood Library and Athenaeum * 1748: Charleston Library Society * 1753: Providence Athenaeum * 1754: New York Society Library * 1795: Lexington (Kentucky) Library Society * 1804: Social Law Library * 1807: Boston Athenæum * 1810: Salem Athenaeum * 1814: Athenaeum of Philadelphia * 1816: New Orleans Library Society * 1817: Portsmouth Athenaeum * 1820: General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the City of New York * 1820: Maine Charitable Mechanic Association Library of Portland * 1820: New York Mercantile Library * 1826: The Institute Library (New Haven) * 1835: Mercantile Library of Cincinnati * 1846: St. Louis Mercantile Library Association * 1853: Congregational Library & Archives * 1854: San Francisco Mechanics' Institute * 1890: Lanier Library Association (Lanier Library of North Carolina) * 1897: Timrod Library * 1899: Athenaeum Music & Arts Library of La Jolla * 1900: Milford Mystery Library of Milford, Ohio * 1947: Mendocino Community Library * 1999: John Trigg Ester Library * 2015: Folio: The Seattle Athenaeum ==ReferencesFurther reading== * ==External links== * \\"Where Greek Ideals Meet New England Charm\\" - article about subscription libraries in New England, from The New York Times, March 7, 2008 * The Library of Congress preserves a part of the lending stock of an early 20th-century commercial lending library in its Tabard Inn Collection *\\"Libraries of Gracious Reading, for Members Only\\" *\\"The fall and rise of subscription libraries\\" Category:Types of library ","title":"Subscription library"},{"id":"6202812","text":"Lincolnshire is a county that is mainly in the East Midlands of, and partly in the Yorkshire and Humber region, England It may also refer to: *Lincolnshire, Illinois, United States *Lincolnshire, Kentucky, United States *Lincolnshire, West Virginia, United States *Lincolnshire Management, a private equity firm based in New York, United States *The Lincolnshire, a historic mansion in Andover, Massachusetts, United States *\\"The Lincolnshire Poacher\\", a traditional English folk song *Lincolnshire Poacher (numbers station), a shortwave radio station.

It was made in the displacement for Harley-Davidson Big V-twins bikes, replacing the Shovelhead engine until 2000 when the last EVO was placed in a production factory custom FXR4 (FXR2 and FXR3 were the first CVOs). In 1999, it was replaced by the Harley-Davidson Twin Cam 88 in the Touring and Dyna model and in 2000 in the Softail models. Also available in the Sportster model beginning in 1986, it was made in the displacement until 1988 and is still made in the and displacements for the Harley-Davidson Sportster, replacing the ironhead Sportster engine. Most analysts consider the Evolution to be the engine that saved the reorganized Harley-Davidson company from certain bankruptcy. Harley-Davidson's official name for the engine was likely related to the company's attempt to reform its image following the 1981 management buyout from previous owner American Machine and Foundry (AMF).Smithsonian magazine, August 2003, pg. 36 – \\"Wild Thing\\", Robert F. Howe Both the heads and cylinders of the Evolution engine are made from aluminum to reduce weight compared to a cast iron design. Air cooling efficiency is improved as aluminum is a superior thermal conductor to cast iron. The blocky rocker boxes (thus becoming nicknamed \\"block head\\" which never caught on), aluminum heads and cylinders (also referred to as \\"jugs\\") are the only part of the Evolution engine that can be said to be essential; the Big Twin and Sportster incarnations of the Evolution are significantly different. ==Evolution on the Sportster== Above, a color-coded approximate diagram of the Sportster Evolution valve train superimposed over an image of a Sportster Evolution. Crank output is purple; cams are red; pushrod/lifters are yellow; rockers are blue; valves are dark green, with seats shown in light green. The unit construction of the Harley-Davidson Sportster, which has essentially been unchanged since its inception as the side-valve 750cc \\"K\\" Model in 1952, was retained with the Evolution engine upgrade in 1986, resulting in a unique valve train configuration. Unlike almost any other engine in production today, the Sportster Evolution uses one cam per engine overhead valve, resulting in four individual, single-lobe, gear-driven camshafts. The cam lobes are thus all located one behind another, and pushrods are arrayed in pairs (front and rear) parallel to the cylinder axis as a result. This allows each lifter and pushrod to deflect from the cam lobes perpendicular to the lobe plane. This configuration is friendly to radical, high-output cams, making the Sportster Evolution a natural choice for the once Harley-Davidson owned line of Buell Motorcycle Company sportbikes from 1986 up to late 2009 (2010 model year). The Sportster Evolution engine has remained largely unchanged from 1986 to the present day, though changes to the transmission, final drive and motor mounts have necessitated changes to the Sportster Evolution case. Construction is almost entirely the same between 883 cc and 1,200 cc versions; the chief difference between the two is a smaller bore on the 883 cc (inherited from its earlier \\"ironhead\\" parent), along with slightly different heads. Conversions from 883 cc to 1,200 cc are relatively inexpensive and commonplace, and cheaper than the price premium to go from an 883 to 1,200 engine on a new bike. Carburetors were standard on Sportster engines until 2007, when they were replaced by the Delphi Electronic Sequential-Port Fuel Injection (ESPFI) system. A simplified derivative of the engine was used on the Buell Blast entry-level motorcycle from 2000 to 2009. The Sportster engine as used on the Buell Blast was in most ways similar to the one used on Sportsters, albeit with the rear cylinder removed, along with other concessions to reduce overall cost and maintenance. ==Evolution on the big bikes== The Evolution Big Twin saw a fifteen-year run in Harley-Davidson's Dyna, Softail, FXR, and Touring frames, although a limited number of Evolutions were used in the 2000 model year CVO FXR4, and 1999 FXR2 and FXR3 models. While the main case was only slightly modified from the previous Shovelhead engine, the top end was significantly improved. The 1340cc Evolution utilizes a single, four-lobe, gear-driven camshaft located just above the crankshaft axis. While this simplifies camshaft replacement, it complicates the Big Twin valve train with tappet/lifters and pushrods that each deflect from the camshaft at wildly different angles. The Big Twin pushrods have a distinct helical appearance because the vertical plane formed by each cylinder's rockers (front-to-back) is exactly perpendicular to the vertical plane formed by the cam lobes (left- to-right). The need for one lifter and pushrod set to reach all the way out to the most outboard cam lobe gives rise to the Big Twin's tell-tale offset lifter assemblies, where the forward lifter assembly is located slightly farther out and rotated to enable the valve gear to make the reach. The Big Twin has been accompanied by a number of different primary drives and transmissions, both on production Harley-Davidson motorcycles and in custom applications. The aftermarket selection of accessories for these closely related systems is wide, as it is for the engine itself. The Evolution Big Twin motor was, until the introduction of the Twin Cam engine, the last of the line of single cam, overhead valve motors tracing their lineage back to the seminal Knucklehead design penned by founder Bill Harley. It is also the largest aftermarket supported Harley-Davidson design, to date, with clones of the engine being produced by third parties like S&S; Cycle and several others. Harley reverted to a single cam design with the Milwaukee-Eight engine, first introduced for touring models in 2016. ==See also== *Harley-Davidson engine timeline ==References *Detailed Evo Engine Animations Evolution ","title":"Harley-Davidson Evolution engine"},{"id":"6202826","text":"Sunnyside is a neighborhood in the south east section of Portland, between SE Stark Street and SE Hawthorne Blvd. (north to south) and from SE 28th Ave. to SE 49th Ave. (west to east).

By 1835 the complete route to Northampton was finished and operating. The canal, however, was never successful financially. Competition with railroads threatened the canal. The New Haven and Northampton Company was built along the canal's right of way in 1848. Joseph Earl Sheffield was involved with the financing of both the canal and railroad. This railroad merged with the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1887. Portions of the railway were in use up until the 1980s. A two-mile section from the Main/Whiting Street intersection in Plainville to Townline Road sees limited use. ==Aqueduct== Towpath of the Farmington Canal Aqueduct The canal makers reached a problem at the \\"great level\\" (the level stretch of land between locks 8 and 9, which was the longest distance of the canal at the same water level; once the Farmington river was reached, the canal was about 50 feet above river level, and the canal and river could not merge, so the aqueduct was built. The 280-foot aqueduct was spanned with 7 arches, spaced 40 feet apart. The pillars that remained after the canal closed were noted as a state landmark in the 50s, but the 1955 flood damaged the pillars beyond repair, and they were removed in 1956-58. The aqueduct's remnants are now preserved as part of the Farmington Land Trust. ==The Whitings basin== The Whitings basin, or Bristol basin, was located in Plainville, between Whiting Street and West Main Street. Edna Whiting built a general store, and had doors leading directly to the canal for drop offs. Whiting's general store sold a variety of jelly, spices, grains, etc. Other notable items that passed through and were dropped off at Bristol basin were the original Eli Terry clock weights, for the notable pillar and scroll clock.the making of bristol (print) by Beals ==Locks== Locks 1-8 have been demolished. Lock 12 is restored and has movable lock gates to simulate function but does not actually function as a lock because there is not enough water flow to fill the lock, and the lock gates do not seal well enough to allow the lock to fill and raise the water level. The lock keeper's house at gate 12 has also been restored. Lock 13 is in the woods and overgrown. The lock keeper's house for lock 13 is no longer standing; the foundation and well remain behind the lock. Lock 14 is still recognizable; however, walls have collapsed, and the inside of lock 14 is dry. The lock keeper's house is still standing, and plans to convert it for municipal services building are planned.personal encounters with the canal locks, and paper work printed at each station among the canal locks ==Trail== Farmington Canal Lock 12, Cheshire, CT During the 1990s, the railroad right-of-way was converted to a rail trail for recreational use.

Partly spoof and partly homage, it draws heavily on the tropes and themes of American \\"Psycho- biddy\\" films and plays from the 1950s and 1960s that featured strong, sometimes dominating female leads, such as those by Bette Davis (Dead Ringer) and Ethel Merman (Gypsy). It is adapted from a play of the same name by Busch, first performed in 1999. ==Plot== The film opens with Angela Arden kneeling in front of her twin sister Barbara's grave. Angela is a lounge singer who is attempting to resuscitate her floundering career, which became obsolete around the same time Barbara committed suicide. She's unhappily married to her film director husband Sol Sussman, with whom she has two children-Lance, who is gay and emotionally disturbed, and Edith, a \\"daddy's girl\\" who is openly contemptuous of her mother. Also living in the house is the snoopy maid Bootsie, who is infatuated with Sol. Bored and unhappy, Angela begins cheating on her husband with Tony Parker, a tennis-playing \\"lothario\\" and failed actor who is reputed to be well endowed. Sol finds out after hiring a private detective to follow Angela around. He confronts her about it but he refuses to divorce her. Instead, he gives her \\"life in prison\\". Not only does he cancel all of Angela's credit cards, he forbids her from performing at an engagement in New York, destroying the contract before she has a chance to sign it. Feeling trapped and eager to get her hands on her husband's money, Angela poisons an ever-constipated Sol with an arsenic-laced suppository. Despite the fact that Angela receives virtually nothing in Sol's will, her children, along with Bootsie, begin to suspect Angela's involvement. And the suspicious circumstances of Sol's death bring old questions about Angela's sister's death to light. Edith-and later Lance-hatch a plot to get her to confess. Meanwhile, Tony successfully seduces both the children, taking an unusual interest in the details surrounding Aunt Barbara's death. After Bootsie is found dead, the children eventually get Angela to confess her crimes by lacing her evening coffee with LSD. During her bender, Angela not only reveals that she poisoned Sol, but that she is not Angela but really Barbara. In flashback, Barbara reveals how as Angela's career flourished, her own fell apart, culminating in her arrest for jewelry theft. After serving her sentence, Barbara arrived at Angela's mansion, greeted with scorn and ridicule from the immensely egotistical Angela. Watching the physical and emotional abuse Angela doled out to Sol and the children, Barbara devised a plan to poison her sister and take over her life, her family and, most importantly, her career. The children watch with confusion as Barbara announces she killed Angela. As they turn the tape over to Tony, Edith and Lance fight over who will be the one to run away with him, while he respectfully refuses both of them. Meanwhile, a masked assailant pops up and tries to dispatch Barbara; in the scuffle, Barbara pulls off the assailant's mask, revealing Sol underneath. With all the primary players in the room, Sol reveals how he and Bootsie faked his death for him to escape outstanding mob debts he couldn't pay back and how he was forced to kill Bootsie to protect his secret. Tony then reveals he is really an FBI agent who's been heading a case investigating Angela's murder before arresting Sol. The children-finally understanding Barbara's motives and desperation-hug Barbara while Tony says he will destroy the evidence to protect her from an eventual prison stint and trip to the gas chamber. But Barbara tells them, as she walks to her waiting police escort outside, that by finally being herself, she will finally gain her freedom from living under her sister's shadow. ==Cast== * Charles Busch as Angela Arden / Barbara Arden * Jason Priestley as Tony Parker * Frances Conroy as Bootsie Carp * Philip Baker Hall as Sol Sussman * Stark Sands as Lance Sussman * Natasha Lyonne as Edith Sussman * Victor Raider-Wexler as Sam Fishbein * Nora Dunn as Shatzi Van Allen * Stanley DeSantis as Tuchman ==Production== Die, Mommie, Die! is based on a play of the same name by Busch, subtitled The Fall of the House of Sussman. It is a parody of 1960s gothic horror films like Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte, crossed with the Greek tragedy Electra by Sophocles. Busch originally planned to adapt Electra and play Clytemnestra, but finding the costumes \\"so drab, so Greek\\", he set the work in 1967 (\\"a truly groovy year in fashion\\") and added the horror element. Michael Bottari and Ronald Case designed Busch's more than 50 costumes in the film. ==Release== The film debuted on January 20, 2003 at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival, with a wider release in October 2003. The region 1 DVD was released on June 29, 2004. ==Reception== Busch won the Special Jury Prize for Performance for the film at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival. ==Stage version== The original play—spelled and punctuated as Die! Mommy! Die!—was first produced in Los Angeles at the Coast Playhouse from July to September 1999. In addition to Busch as Angela and Barbara, the show starred Greg Mullavey as Sol, Dorie Barton as Edith, Wendy Worthington as Bootsie, Mark Capri as Tony and Carl Andress as Lance. Though initially scheduled to close in August 1999, the play's run was extended through September, with Playbill calling it a \\"smash hit\\". Writing for Variety, Robert Hofler called the play \\"Charles Busch's funniest, most accomplished and, without question, raunchiest work\\". Michael Phillips of the Los Angeles Times praised Busch as \\"peerless performer\\" who \\"is reason enough to see this show\\", but noted that \\"the satiric unevenness can't be disguised\\" and \\"the supporting cast disappoints\\". Michael Bottari and Ronald Case, longtime costume designers for Busch, created his wardrobe and, with designer Dione H. Lebhar, were nominated for an Ovation Award for the production. Barton was also nominated as Featured Actress in a Play. Produced in New York for the first time in 2007, the show opened for previews on October 10 Off-Broadway at the New World Stages, officially opening on October 21, 2007. The cast included Busch recreating his original roles, Ashley Austin Morris as Edith, Kristine Nielsen as Bootsie, Van Hansis as Lance, Bob Ari as Sol and Chris Hoch as Tony. Directed by Andress, who played Lance in the 1999 production, the show closed on January 13, 2008. Mark Blankenship of Variety called Busch \\"radiant\\", praising his performance and writing, as well as the play's \\"ludicrous-yet-stylish tone\\". Busch's costumes by Bottari and Case won them a 2008 Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Costume Design alongside designer Jessica Jahn, and the three were also nominated for a Drama Desk Award, and an Outer Critics Circle Award. ==References* * * Die, Mommie, Die! at CharlesBusch.com * Category:2003 films Category:2003 black comedy films Category:2003 independent films Category:2003 LGBT-related films Category:American black comedy films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:American satirical films Category:Bisexuality-related films Category:Cross-dressing in American films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Dennis McCarthy Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films about singers Category:American films based on plays Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Incest in film Category:Plays by Charles Busch Category:2003 comedy films ","title":"Die, Mommie, Die!"},{"id":"6202864","text":"János \\"Johnny\\" Weissmüller Jr. (September 23, 1940 – July 27, 2006) was an American actor and longshoreman. He also authored a book about his father, the five-time Olympic Games gold medalist Johnny Weissmuller, who achieved additional fame playing the title role in the Tarzan movies of the 1930s and 1940s. == Biography == Weissmuller was born in San Francisco, where his father was performing at the Golden Gate International Exposition in a water ballet show called Billy Rose's Aquacade. His mother was Beryl Scott, the third of his father's five wives. The younger Weissmuller graduated from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where he was on the swim team. He joined the United States Navy, using his swimming acumen to specialize in underwater demolition. In 1958, Weissmuller Jr. got his first screen role in the Mickey Rooney film Andy Hardy Comes Home. In 1961, he appeared in the episode \\"The Four\\" with Jack Elam in the western series, Lawman, starring John Russell. He also worked as a stuntman before moving to San Francisco where he worked as a longshoreman. His subsequent credits include parts in THX 1138 (1971) and the 1973 hit American Graffiti (as Bad Ass #1). He also provided the voice of the Tarzan character in the English language version of the X-rated cartoon Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle (1975).

Multichannel Audio Digital Interface (MADI) or AES10 is an Audio Engineering Society (AES) standard that defines the data format and electrical characteristics of an interface that carries multiple channels of digital audio. The AES first documented the MADI standard in AES10-1991, and updated it in AES10-2003 and AES10-2008. The MADI standard includes a bit-level description and has features in common with the two-channel AES3 interface. MADI supports serial digital transmission over coaxial cable or fibre-optic lines of 28, 56, or 32, 64 channels; and sampling rates to 962 kHz and beyond with an audio bit depth of up to 24 bits per channel. Like AES3 and ADAT Lightpipe, it is a unidirectional interface from one sender to one receiver. == Development and applications == MADI was developed by AMS Neve, Solid State Logic, Sony and Mitsubishi and is widely used in the audio industry, especially in the professional audio sector. It provides advantages over other audio digital interface protocols and standards such as AES3, ADAT Lightpipe, TDIF (Tascam Digital Interface), and S/PDIF (Sony/Philips Digital Interface). These advantages include: * Support for a greater number of channels per line * Use of coaxial and optical fiber media that support transmission of audio signals over 100 meters, up to 3000 meters over multi-mode and 40,000 meters over single-mode optical fiber The original specification (AES10-1991) defined the MADI link as a 56 channel transport for linking large-format mixing consoles to digital multi-track recording devices. Large broadcast studios also adopted it for routing multi-channel audio throughout their facilities. The 2003 revision (AES10-2003) adds a 64 channel capability by removing vari-speed operation and supports 96 kHz sampling frequency with reduced channel capacity. The latest AES10-2008 standard includes minor clarifications and updates to correspond to the current AES3 standard. Audio over Ethernet of various types is the primary alternative to MADI for transport of many channels of professional digital audio. == Transmission format == MADI links use a transmission format similar to Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) networking. Since MADI is most often transmitted on copper links via 75 ohm coaxial cables, it more closely compares to the FDDI specification for copper- based links, called CDDI. AES10-2003 recommends using BNC connectors with coaxial cables and SC connectors with optic fibres. MADI over fibre can support a range of up to 2 km. The basic data rate is 100 Mbit/s of data using 4B5B encoding to produce a 125 MHz physical baud rate. Unlike AES3, this clock is not synchronized to the audio sample rate, and the audio data payload is padded using JK sync symbols. Sync symbols may be inserted at any subframe boundary, and must occur at least once per frame. Though the standard disassociates the transmission clock from the audio sample rate, and thus requires a separate word clock connection to maintain synchronisation, some vendors do give the option of locking to parts of the transmission timing information for purposes of deriving a word clock. The audio data is almost identical to the AES3 payload, though with more channels. Rather than letters, MADI assigns channel numbers from 0–63. Frame synchronization is provided by sync symbols outside the data itself, rather than an embedded preamble sequence, and the first four time slots of each sub-channel are encoded as normal data, used for sub-channel identification: * Bit 0: Set to 1 to mark channel 0, the first channel in each frame * Bit 1: Set to 1 to indicate that this channel is active (contains interesting data) * Bit 2: notA/B channel marker, used to mark left (0) and right (1) channels. Generally, even channels are A and odd channels are B. * Bit 3: Set to 1 to mark the beginning of a 192-sample data block == Sampling frequency == The original AES10-1991 specification allowed 56 channels at sample rates from 32 to 48 kHz with an additional vari-speed range of ±12.5%.AES10-1991 clause 4.1 This leads to a total range of 28 to 54 kHz. At the highest frequency, this produces a total of 56×32×54 = 96768 kbit/s, leaving 3.232% of the channel for synchronization marks and transmit clock error. The 2003 revision specifies different relations between sampling frequency and number of channels.AES10-2003 clause 5.1 * 32 kHz to 48 kHz ±12.5%, 56 channels; * 32 kHz to 48 kHz nominal, 64 channels; * 64 kHz to 96 kHz ±12.5%, 28 channels. With a 48 kHz sampling frequency, 64 channels take 64×32×48k = 98.304M bit/s. Adding the minimum 8×58 kbit/s of framing produces 98688 bit/s, leaving 1.312% free for timing variation and other overhead. Both versions of the standard accommodate higher sampling frequencies (for example, 96 kHz or 192 kHz) by using two or more channels per audio sample on the link. == Notes  References Further reading== * * Category:Computer hardware standards Category:Serial buses Category:Digital media Category:Sound production technology Category:Audio engineering Category:Audio network protocols Category:Sound technology Category:Audio Engineering Society standards ","title":"MADI"},{"id":"6202911","text":"Jarrell Independent School District is a public school district based in Jarrell, Texas (USA). The district has four campuses - Jarrell High (Grades 9–12), Jarrell Middle (Grades 6-8), Igo Elementary (Grades PK-5) and Jarrell Elementary (Grades PK-5). Jarrell ISD vision statement is focused in : empowering future ready citizens , providing opportunities , inspiring excellence and cultivating innovation . Their mission is to provides pathways for individual student success. ==History== After housing all students in the same school from its inception in 1916, 2007 saw the building of a new high school marking the first time in JISD history that more than one campus would be used to educate students. In 2010 a new elementary school was built and in 2014 the middle school received a new building as well. In August of 2019 , Jarrell Independent School District opened a second elementary campus. Igo elementary school honors the Igos family killed in the 1997 Jarrell tornado. This explosive growth in only a 10-year period is mainly due to Jarrell's location off of Interstate Highway 35 in between Austin, Texas and Waco, Texas and also to the Sonterra subdivision of homes that has greatly increased the population. The 1916 building, Jarrell's first schoolhouse is still in existence today though it is not used for any formal purposes in the district. It is housed in between the intermediate school and the new middle school. ==Athletics== Jarrell's mascot is the Cougar. The Jarrell basketball teams have been the most consistently successful sport for the high school. The boys' basketball team advanced to the 2-A state semi Finals and narrowly lost to Shallowater by one point in 2007. The girls' basketball team reached the class 3-A state semi Finals in 2015 and lost to Shallowater. The boys teams have also routinely been among the strongest teams in the state and have reached the state playoffs in recent years. In 2012 the Jarrell Cougars baseball team were crowned State Champions for Class 2-A, which was Jarrell's first team championship in any sport. ==Academics== Jarrell has a rich history of academics and is routinely rated Academically Recognized by the state of Texas though at times, some campuses have been rated as merely Academically Acceptable. == Notable People == Morgan Cooper, baseball pitcher - University of Texas.

The untended areas of Lake Perris may seem rocky and barren at first glance, but harbor a variety of natural wonders. An artificial reef exists on the lake floor made of old tires. The reef was created to provide a habitat for fish. == Flora and fauna == The predominant plant community, coastal sage scrub, is host to a variety of birds and wildlife. Mule deer, roadrunners, bobcats, coyotes, rabbits, quail, gopher snakes and rattlesnakes may sometimes be seen by day, though they tend to shy away from people. More frequently seen are a wide variety of lizards, rodents, water fowl, and birds of prey. Beautiful displays of wildflowers occur during the rainy season, generally November through April. The coastal sage scrub community is predominant on the south-facing slopes of the Russell mountains and Bernasconi hills and is characterized by shrubby plants including desert encelia, brittlebush, sagebrush, black sage, white sage, buckwheat, and cacti. Conditions are somewhat shadier on hillsides that face north or northwest so that chaparral plants such as chamise, penstemon, and poison oak are found. Remnants of the original perennial grasses that once flourished in this region can still be found in the flat interior of the park surrounding the lake, but the majority of plants that now make up the valley grassland community (including Russian thistle) were imported from Europe by early settlers. Riparian areas near springs and seeps, and on east and south lakes include willows, cattails, elderberry and nettles. More than a hundred species of birds have been spotted at Lake Perris. Many are migratory, and stop at the park briefly during their travels, while others make their permanent residence here. Meadowlarks, loggerhead shrikes, roadrunners, California thrashers, quail, wrens, sparrows, hummingbirds, golden eagles, several varieties of hawks, ospreys, and even bald eagles may be seen. Many varieties of waterfowl use the lake including pintails, widgeons, teals, mallards, shovelers, various geese, and sometimes tundra swans and pelicans. black-necked stilts, avocets, killdeer, willets, kingfishers, egrets, and herons are attracted to the water's edge. The lake has become a hotspot for freshwater game fishing. Largemouth bass, spotted bass, bluegill, rainbow trout, channel catfish, black crappie, red ear sunfish and carp are all present in the lake. As the climate is a warm one, the California Department of Fish and Game make regular plants of rainbow trout throughout the winter months. The lake records for each of the species are noted here: * Alabama spotted bass – 9 pounds, 6 ounces * Florida largemouth bass – 17 pounds, 6 ounces * Bluegill – 3 pounds, 15 ounces * Rainbow trout – 7 pounds * Channel catfish – 30 pounds Largemouth bass, bluegill, rainbow trout, channel catfish, black crappie, redear sunfish tend to be the primary focus of anglers. The trout usually only bite in the cooler months after the DFG plants. Day and night, hawks and owls are frequently seen hunting for prey. The bike trail offers an easy and convenient way to see some of the birds and other wildlife of Lake Perris. Early morning or dusk are the best times. Ranger-led hikes are conducted during the spring and early summer months. Most plants and animals at Lake Perris are well adapted to the hot, dry environment. Chamise leaves are tiny and waxy to minimize water loss due to evaporation. Some grasses and wildflowers rush from bloom to seed in just a few short weeks and are able to complete their life cycle within the brief wet season. Kangaroo rats are so well adapted to dry environments that they seldom drink water, and manage to extract the moisture they need directly from their food. The plants and animals of Perris Valley have changed considerably over the last two hundred years due to human activity, but its natural history can be intriguing. == Recreation == The Big Rock Triathlon at Lake Perris, 2009 There are many recreational activities allowed on, in, and around Lake Perris and in the State Recreation Park. Guided hikes are offered on the trail around the lake, and several camping sites are located near the lake side. The lake is open for boating from 6:00 am to 6:30 pm from Thursday to Monday. Other activities include fishing, picnicking, horse-back riding, swimming (in designated areas), and rock climbing. The park also hosts the annual Big Rock Triathlon at sprint and Olympic distances. There is also a museum on the park grounds. == Weather == Lake Perris has hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Rainy weather is limited almost completely to the months between November and April. The area lies at a crossroads of weather influences. Coastal fog (and smog) comes from the west, while \\"Santa Anas\\"—strong, hot dry winds—come from the deserts to the east and northeast. The average water temperature is 70 °F (21 °C) ; during the summer months, it is bathwater-warm and very pleasant to swim in. == Lake Perris water withdrawal == For several months following July 2005, the water in Lake Perris was drawn down by about 20 percent (about 24 feet) due to safety concerns with the dam. An extensive modern study concluded that the dam could be partially breached if a 7.5 magnitude or higher earthquake were to strike in the area. Heightening the engineers' fears was the fact that the San Jacinto Fault, easily capable of creating a 7.5 tremor, passes just a few miles north of the lake. It may take more than two years for the state to plan a course of action to bolster the dam. All recreational activities are still allowed, with some restrictions. Most noticeably, the boating zone has been reduced to the area between the dam and Alessandro Island. The area from the island east is now a 5 mph (wakeless speed) area. Swimming is only allowed at Perris Beach (Lots 1, 2, 3, and 4). Reservations for boats are highly recommended in the summer; weekends sell out fast. Since the drawdown there are fewer first-come, first-served spots available for watercraft. In the summer of 2006 (Memorial Day to Labor Day) most reservations sold out a week or two in advance. ==2028 Summer Olympics== The Los Angeles Olympic Bid for the 2028 Summer Olympic Games made an agreement with the Department of Parks and Recreation for the Lake to be host for competitive Canoe-Sprint and rowing competition when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. The bid committee preferred Lake Perris to Lake Casitas as Lake Perris is near a larger population base and is in close proximity to UCR for athletes’ accommodations. In February 2019 the International Rowing Federation announced that they had been asked to look at the possibility of using Long Beach Marine Stadium (the 1932 Olympic rowing venue) instead of Lake Perris. No decision has been made. == See also == * List of dams and reservoirs in California * List of lakes in California == References  * Lake Perris State Recreation Area * Ya'i Heki' Regional Indian Museum * California State Parks: Lake Concerns – Lake Perris is still 80% full! * Perris Dam Category:Dams in California Category:California Department of Water Resources dams Category:Dams completed in 1973 Perris, Lake Category:Parks in Riverside County, California Category:Museums in Riverside County, California Category:Native American museums in California Category:Perris, California Category:State parks of California Category:California State Water Project Perris, Lake Perris Category:Venues of the 2028 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic canoeing venues Category:Olympic rowing venues Category:Olympic kayaking venues Perris ","title":"Lake Perris"},{"id":"6202918","text":"Jasper Independent School District is a public school district based in Jasper, Texas.

Starkweather was a clinical psychologist and a valued teacher by generations of clinical psychology interns and graduate students at UCSF. He was a pioneer in taking a psychologist's view of the emerging computer field and incorporating concepts as well as numbers to language processing. ==Early years== Starkweather's father was an engineer and his mother was a poet. He was raised in Seattle, Washington and served in the United States Coast Guard during World War II from 1943 to 1945. Starkweather graduated from Yale in 1950 with a B.A. in Art and from Northwestern University in 1955 with a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology. He joined the faculty of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco in 1955, where he spent his entire career. He married his wife, Jean, in 1952 while he was a graduate student at Northwestern. The Starkweathers had three sons, David, Timothy and Stephen. ==Studies in speech== Starkweather took an early interest in speech and language, and especially the expression of emotion in the voice. His dissertation, supervised by professor Carl Porter Duncan at Northwestern, was \\"Judgments of Content-Free Speech as Related to Some Aspects of Personality\\" and was the first to show that judges could distinguish reliably among different emotions from content-free speech, created by filtering out frequencies above 300 cycles. He went on to study spectral measures of voice and to show that such measures could track day-to-day changes in the degree of depression in hospitalized patients. However, he is best known for his contributions to computer science in relation to psychology, teaching, and medicine. ==Contributions to computer science== The 1950s were remarkable for the introduction of the stored-program computer. As Starkweather pursued his voice-quality research, he created a real-time pitch spectrum analyzer that could generate a 20-band pitch spectrum every two seconds from voice recordings. The quantitative analysis demands of such data plunged him into the use of the primitive computer resources available in the early 1960s. Starkweather began to realize that he might contribute to computer software development beyond simply being an informed research user. At that time most of the academic attention to computer software focused on quantitative analysis. For example, UCLA was developing the Biomedical Computer Programs, the first reliable and comprehensive statistical analysis package. Starkweather foresaw that psychology, education, and medicine would also need ways for computers to deal with language content. He first developed a programming language called COMPUTEST to allow students and teachers to access teaching materials and examinations by computer, even though the computer hardware needed to accomplish this at the time filled half of a classroom. As hardware became smaller, he developed the PILOT language (Programmed Inquiry, Learning Or Teaching) that made it easy for non-programmers to write sequences of machine-administered teaching or testing using the time-share terminals in use in 1970, and then microcomputers when they became available a decade later. The National Library of Medicine adopted PILOT as its primary computer language for the dissemination and exchange of computer-based instructional materials in the health sciences, and used it for instructing medical librarians in using MEDLINE. Starkweather chaired a working group for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers from 1987 through 1991 that established standards for PILOT. The language was in active use for many years. However, the introduction of microcomputers also attracted capital to a budding software industry, and this ended the early period when most non- business software was created in universities; Starkweather thereafter turned his energy to administration. In the 1960s, Starkweather was the logical person to develop a computer center for UCSF, which he led for 15 years until its operation was ready for a non-faculty administrator. In 1983, he became Academic Vice Chair of the Department of Psychiatry, and made major contributions to departmental planning and advising junior faculty regarding faculty advancement. Starkweather held this position until his retirement in 1993. ==Contributions to UCSF== UCSF is a health science campus with no undergraduate programs, and when Starkweather joined the faculty in 1955 there were no degree programs in psychology, although the Clinical Psychology Internship at the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute was already well known. Starkweather was one of the founders of the Psychology Ph.D. program established at UCSF in 1961 and he chaired the program in its early years. Under the leadership of George Stone, this program was later transformed into the first health psychology Ph.D. program in the country. Starkweather led the creation in 1971 of the UCSF Ph.D. program in Medical Information Sciences, and chaired that program for nine years. ==Civic contributions== Starkweather was also a civic leader in the Marin County community where he lived since 1956. He served 12 years on his local school board and 20 years on the city of San Rafael planning commission. He and his wife were active environmentalists in the area. The Jean and John Starkweather Shoreline Park was named for the family in 2003. In 2007 the John Starkweather Learning Center was named for him in an affordable housing community center in San Rafael. ==Honors and awards== Starkweather was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science \\"for contributions to medical information systems and the application of computers to instruction, inquiry, and learning,\\" and Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics \\"for contributions to the field of medical information science.\\" During his career, he served in many university-wide and campus-wide leadership roles, including Chair of the UCSF Academic Senate. Several of his students became leaders in their fields, including the psychologists Paul Ekman, Rudolph Moos, the psychiatrists Donald Langsley, Kay Blacker, and the computer scientist Gio Wiederhold. ==Death== Starkweather died March 10, 2001 at the age of 75 from complications of Parkinson's disease. ==ReferencesFurther reading== * Category:1925 births Category:2001 deaths Category:American psychologists Category:Health informaticians Category:University of California, San Francisco faculty Category:Northwestern University alumni Category:People from San Rafael, California Category:20th-century psychologists ","title":"John Amsden Starkweather"},{"id":"6202932","text":"Kevin Novak (born September 1, 1982 in Los Angeles, California) is an American soccer defender, who played two seasons for Real Salt Lake in Major League Soccer and one for the Rochester Raging Rhinos of the USL First Division.

It operates two routes between Downtown Seattle and West Seattle or Vashon Island. ==HistoryEarly ferries of Puget Sound=== West Seattle is the oldest neighborhood\\"West Seattle History\\". HistoryLink.org and the birthplace of the city of Seattle. It is surrounded on three sides by water and has both enjoyed and suffered its isolation from the \\"mainland\\" of downtown Seattle. Between 1850 and 1930, hundreds of small, steam-powered ferries called the Mosquito Fleet\\"Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet\\". HistoryLink.org of steam-powered boats carried travelers to and from numerous islands and peninsulas in the Puget Sound area, including West Seattle and Vashon Island. The first licensed ferry in the Seattle area\\"West Seattle Ferry\\". HistoryLink.org launched on December 24, 1888, traveled from Seacrest Park in West Seattle to downtown Seattle, as well as other water-bound location throughout the Puget Sound. It was a steam- powered sidewheel ship named the City of Seattle and made two trips a day, carrying West Seattle homesteaders east to the city, and weekend vacationers west to the beachfront.Alki Beach History The service was discontinued when the first bridge across the Duwamish River was built. Over on Vashon Island, the passenger-only ferries were discontinued as the Mosquito Fleet faced increasing competition from the diesel-powered auto ferries. Vashon Island residents could now drive their vehicles onto a ferry to the Fauntleroy terminal in West Seattle. Over time, a succession of bridges was installed to connect the West Seattle peninsula to downtown proper, beginning with the old wood-and-rail Spokane Street bridge in 1920. In 1970, calls for a modern solution brought attention to the growing problem of commuting to downtown; in 1978, the freighter ship Chavez crashed into the lower bridge\\"West Seattle Bridge Chavez accident\\". Bridgepros. spurring the city to build the high-level West Seattle Bridge and the low-level Spokane Street Bridge that are still the primary paths into and out of peninsula today. As West Seattle has grown in popularity, travel in and out of the peninsula has become more congested. ===Elliott Bay Water Taxi=== The Sightseer served as the second Elliott Bay Water Taxi. The Elliott Bay Water Taxi started service in 1997 as a pilot project to give commuters an alternative to the congested West Seattle Bridge and Highway 99. The Water Taxi was operated by King County Metro and only ran between April and October. King County leased the M/V Admiral Pete from Kitsap Harbor Tours (via Argosy Cruises) and later the M/V Sightseer from Argosy Cruises to operate the service. The vessel was only capable of traveling 8 knots, but the slow speeds proved popular with both commuters and tourists. The ferry quickly became a popular tourist attraction due to beautiful view as the vessel crosses Elliott Bay, the short walk to Alki Beach and the restaurants in West Seattle. ===Vashon passenger-only ferry=== The passenger- only ferry service between Vashon Island and Downtown Seattle started as a service of the Washington State Ferries in the early 1990s. The ferries proved popular with commuters as they offered a much faster connection to downtown Seattle than the alternative of taking the auto ferry to Fauntleroy and driving or taking transit to downtown. In 2006, the state legislature ordered Washington State Ferries to discontinue all passenger-only ferry services, but simultaneously enabled local authorities to form Ferry Districts with tax- collecting authority. The last run operated by the Washington State Ferries vessels came in September 2009. ===King County Ferry District=== In April 2007 the county formed the special-purpose King County Ferry District to take over operations of both the West Seattle and Vashon Island passenger-only ferries. The district is funded through a property tax levied on all property in the county.\\"OPINION: Passenger Ferries: A mobility solution\\", Seattle Times November 29, 2007 (accessed May 31, 2008) The ferry district took over operation of the West Seattle/Downtown Seattle route from King County Metro on April 27, 2008. King County Water Taxi at Seattle's Pier 50 In April 2009, the West Seattle route was renamed from the Elliott Bay Water Taxi to the King County Water Taxi. Later that year, on September 28, 2009, the Vashon Island/Downtown Seattle route was transferred from Washington State Ferries and became the second King County Water Taxi Route. King County Ferry District leased the catamaran from Four Seasons Marine Services to operate the Vashon Island route. In addition to being more stable, the catamaran was also faster than the ships operated by the Washington State Ferries reducing travel time from 30 to 22 minutes. In April 2010, the West Seattle route began operating year-round service from a newly rebuilt dock at Seacrest Park that allowed for wheelchair access. At the same time the West Seattle route started operating with the catamaran (a sister ship of the Melissa Ann), also leased from Four Seasons Marine Services. The leased Sightseer was returned to Argosy Cruises. In March 2013, the District added a third vessel to its fleet by acquiring the that had been previously used on the failed SoundRunner ferry between Kingston and Downtown Seattle. The Spirit of Kingston is the first vessel to be owned by the ferry district. It was assigned to the West Seattle route where its smaller size, and more efficient engines proved a better fit than the Rachel Marie. The new vessel allowed the Rachel Marie to serve as a backup, saving the district on rental and lease expenses. In 2014, the district received federal grants that allowed it to purchase two ships specifically designed for the needs of the King County Water Taxi. ===King County Department of Transportation=== In late 2014 the King County Council (made up of the same members as the King County Ferry District) voted to assume governance of the King County Ferry District. The consolidation of the district into county government saves money by eliminating redundant functions. As of January 1, 2015, the King County Ferry District ceased to exist, and the King County Water Taxi became a service of the Marine Division of the King County Department of Transportation. December 2014 saw the arrival of the first new vessel for the King County Water Taxi, the . After undergoing tests, the new ferry was placed into service on the Vashon Island/Downtown Seattle route on April 8, 2015. The addition of the Sally Fox to the fleet allowed the leased Rachel Marie to be returned to Four Seasons Marine Services in December 2014. The second new vessel, the was delivered in October 2015 and after modifications were made to the dock at Seacrest Park, the new ship began service on the West Seattle/Downtown Seattle route on January 7, 2016. The arrival of the Doc Maynard allowed the Spirit of Kingston to become the backup ship for King County and allowed the leased Melissa Ann to be returned to Four Seasons Marine Services in November 2015. A new passenger ferry terminal at Colman Dock opened on August 13, 2019, to serve the King County Water Taxi and Kitsap Fast Ferries at Pier 50. For two years, passenger ferries were diverted to a temporary terminal to the north at Pier 52 while the old dock was demolished. ==RoutesWest Seattle–Seattle=== The MV Doc Maynard at the new (as of August 2017) temporary King County Water Taxi terminal at Pier 52, on the north side of the Seattle Ferry Terminal. This boat serves the West Seattle–Seattle route. The West Seattle–Seattle route crosses Elliott Bay between Pier 50 on the downtown Seattle waterfront and Seacrest Park in West Seattle. The ferry's crossing time is approximately ten minutes during weekday commute hours and approximately 15 minutes at all other times.King County Metro information page on Elliott Bay Water Taxi , the primary ferry for the route is the . Year round the ferry operates weekdays during the peak commuting hours, carrying an average of 1,742 passengers during the commute hours in December 2014. During the peak season, from early April to late October the water taxi schedule expands to operate all day, seven days a week with extended hours on Friday, Saturday and when the Mariners, Sounders, or Seahawks play night games. Service operates on holidays during the peak season (April–October) but not during the winter season. King County Metro operates two shuttle bus routes that take passengers to and from the dock at Seacrest Park. Route 773 connects to the West Seattle Junction and route 775 connects to the Admiral District and Alki Beach. ===Vashon Island–Seattle=== The Vashon Island–Seattle route operates commuter service between Pier 50 on the downtown Seattle waterfront and Vashon Island. There are six sailings in either direction every weekday, three for the morning commute and three for the evening commute. Each crossing takes approximately 22 minutes. , the primary ferry for the route is , which carries an average of 400 passengers per day in each direction. At the Vashon Island Ferry Terminal, connecting services include King County Metro bus routes 118 and 119 and Washington State Ferries with routes to both the city of Southworth in Kitsap County and the Fauntleroy terminal in West Seattle. ==Fares== As of May 27, 2019 the one-way fares for the King County Water Taxi are: {  - ! colspan=2  Fare type !!

It is located about north west of Lenzburg. ==Geography== The village lies between the north bank of the Aare river and the south slope of the Mount Gislifluh (elev. ), a southern part of the Jura mountains. The partially very steep slope is mostly forested, but exhibits numerous forest meadows. Auenstein has an area, , of . Of this area, 31% is used for agricultural purposes, while 46.4% is forested.

The castle, which was in the possession of the Lords of Rinach until the early 14th century, was burnt down by the Bernese in 1389 as part of the war between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the Habsburgs. The Swiss Confederacy conquered Aargau in 1415.

The reformation occurred in 1528, after which time the owner of the village changed often. ==Sights== Castle Auenstein is located on a small cliff on the banks of the Aare. The Castle was destroyed in 1389. The ruins were owned by the canton until 1803, but were later bought privately.

He batted and threw right-handed. == Early career == Born in Stewartsville, Ohio, Jones played for several Negro league teams, including the Orlando All-Stars and Oakland Larks in 1946; and the Cleveland Buckeyes, where he played under the management of Quincy Trouppe, in 1947 and 1948; and the Kansas City Royals, a \\"touring Negro League squad handpicked by Satchel Paige.\\" In 1948-49 he played in Panama, and then, with the end of the Negro National League, played semi-pro ball until he was signed by the Indians organization in the fall of 1949, playing Class A ball in the season and winter ball for Panama in 1949–50. == Major League career == Jones began his major league career with the Cleveland Indians in 1951. When he entered a game on May 3, 1952, 39-year-old rookie Quincy Trouppe, a Negro league veteran, was behind the plate. Together they formed the first black battery in American League history. Both Sam Jones and Quincy Trouppe played for the Cleveland Buckeyes in the Negro American League. After the season, the Tribe traded him to the Chicago Cubs for two players to be named later, one of whom was slugger Ralph Kiner. In , the Cubs traded him to the St. Louis Cardinals in a multi-player deal; prior to the season, he was dealt this time to the San Francisco Giants for Bill White and Ray Jablonski. He was picked 25th by the expansion Houston Colt .45s in the expansion draft, then traded to the Detroit Tigers for Bob Bruce and Manny Montejo. He rejoined the Cardinals for the campaign and played 1964 with the Baltimore Orioles. He spent the final three years of his pro career as a relief pitcher with the Columbus Jets of the International League before retiring at the end of the 1967 season. == Legacy == During his career, Jones was known for his sweeping curveball, in addition to a fastball and changeup. Stan Musial once remarked, \\"Sam had the best curveball I ever saw... He was quick and fast and that curve was terrific, so big it was like a change of pace. I've seen guys fall down on curves that became strikes.\\" The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers: An Historical Compendium of Pitching, Pitchers, and Pitches. Bill James and Rob Neyer. 2004. During his career, Jones led the National League in strikeouts, and walks, three times: in , 1956, and . On May 12 of the first of these three seasons, he no-hit the Pittsburgh Pirates 4–0 at Wrigley Field, becoming the first African American in Major League history to pitch a no-hitter. He achieved this no-hitter in the hardest way: after walking Gene Freese, Preston Ward (who was pinch-run for by Román Mejías) and Tom Saffell to begin the ninth inning, he left the bases loaded by striking out Dick Groat, Roberto Clemente and Frank Thomas in succession. His greatest year came with the Giants in 1959, when he led the league in both wins with 21 (tying him with Milwaukee Braves starters Lew Burdette and Warren Spahn) and ERA with 2.83. He was named 1959 National League Pitcher of the Year by The Sporting News, but finished a distant second to Early Wynn of the Chicago White Sox for the Cy Young Award. He was named to the NL All-Star team twice, in 1955 and 1959. == Death == Jones died from a recurrence of neck cancer first diagnosed in 1962, in Morgantown, West Virginia at the age of 45. ==References *Sam Jones at SABR (Baseball BioProject) : Category:1925 births Category:1971 deaths Category:African-American baseball players Category:Atlanta Crackers players Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Baseball players from Ohio Category:Burials at Woodlawn Cemetery (Fairmont, West Virginia) Category:Deaths from cancer in West Virginia Category:Cangrejeros de Santurce (baseball) players Category:Caribbean Series players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Cleveland Buckeyes players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Columbus Jets players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Louisville Buckeyes players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:National League All-Stars Category:National League ERA champions Category:National League strikeout champions Category:National League wins champions Category:Oakland Larks players Category:People from Belmont County, Ohio Category:San Diego Padres (minor league) players Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Toronto Maple Leafs (International League) players Category:Wilkes-Barre Indians players ","title":"Sam Jones (baseball)"},{"id":"6203005","text":"Danbury Independent School District is a public school district based in Danbury, Texas (USA).

Croad who imported the breed into Britain. Major Croad's niece, Miss A. C. Croad, has been credited with establishing the breed in Britain. The Croad Langshan Club was formed in Britain in 1904. The name ‘Croad’ distinguishes the original type of Langshan, imported by Major Croad, which were a utility fowl of great merit, from the tall Modern Langshans which have been developed for the show pen. As with many other breeds, numbers declined after the Second World War and eventually the breed was left without a breed club in the UK. It was rescued by the Rare Poultry Society until in 1979 the club was reformed. Langshans were also imported to North America in 1878 and admitted to the standard in 1883. White Langshans were admitted to the standard ten years later in 1893. There are three varieties of Langshans that have been accepted to the US standard - Black, White, and Blue. The latter was not accepted to the standard until 1987. In 1879 the breed was brought to Germany. The German Langshans were derived from these and soon replaced them. After the Second World War Croad Langshans were reintroduced to Germany from the USA. The original Croad Langshans were black with a brilliant green sheen and that is still the main colour kept today. ==Characteristics== The Croad Langshan is large in body, has a deep and long breast which is carried well forward; the back is rather long and sloping with the tail rising sharply from the back, giving the characteristic 'U' shape. The head is small compared to the body size, the beak is light to dark horn in colour; the comb is medium-sized, single and carried upright in both sexes. The shanks and outer toes are slightly feathered. In the original birds the males topped 10 lb/4.5 kg; today cocks weigh 9.5 lbs/3.75-4.25 kg and hens 7.5 lbs/3-3.5 kg. Hatching eggs should weigh at least 58g. In the early 20th century Croad Langshans became a popular utility breed, doing well in laying trials. The hens lay 140-150 eggs a year and are good winter layers; the eggs are dark brown with a plum-coloured bloom. The hens are excellent sitters and mothers. Croad Langshans are easily tamed and adapt well to both confinement and free range. They do well in sheltered conditions and dry soils but are not well suited to very exposed conditions. Under suitable conditions they thrive well and are very productive. Their flesh is fine in texture and of excellent quality.Batty, Joseph (1999) Barnevelder Fowl - History and Management of This Popular Breed Which Lays Deep Brown Eggs, 112 pp, Paperback, Beech Publishing House. The American Poultry Association recognises three colour varieties: black and white were recognised in 1883, and blue in 1987.albc-usa.org, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy Many other breeds were created using Langshan blood in the foundation matings. These include, for example, Barnevelders, Black Orpingtons, and Marans. Langshans still exist in China today. ==See also== * Australian Langshan * German Langshan * Modern Langshan * List of chicken breeds == References  External links == *Website of the British Croad Langshan Club *German Langshan Breeders Association of 1895 (German language website) *Rare Breeds Survival Trust, Britain *Feathersite photo collection *poultryhub.org Fancy Chicken Breeds - Langshan *Belgian Website of Croad Langshan Category:Conservation Priority Breeds of the Livestock Conservancy Category:Chicken breeds originating in China Category:Chicken breeds Category:Animal breeds on the RBST Watchlist Category:Langshans ","title":"Croad Langshan"},{"id":"6203091","text":"Bostwick is an unincorporated community in Putnam County, Florida, United States, located north of the city of Palatka on U.S. Route 17.

In addition to Donna, the district also serves portions of Alamo as well as the communities of Muniz, Scissors, and South Alamo. In 2010, Donna ISD was rated \\"academically acceptable\\" by the Texas Education Agency. Donna ISD's total student enrollment for 2010 was 14,873 according to the Texas Education Agency's website. Donna ISD's current superintendent is Roberto Loredo since 2007. The Texas Education Agency's college readiness performance data shows that only 2% (13 out of 656 students) of the graduates of the class of 2010 of the Donna school district met TEA's average performance criterion on SAT or ACT college admission tests. ==Recent history== On January 24, 2011, a federal judge in McAllen, Texas sentenced the former president of the board of trustees of Donna ISD, George Hernandez, to five months in prison, five months of house arrest, three years of probation, and a $3,000 fine for paying thousands of dollars in kickbacks to curry favors from the PSJA school board. Mr. Hernandez had previously pleaded guilty to the criminal charges. On November 13, 2009, a federal jury awarded $1.2 million to a former superintendent of Donna ISD who was illegally terminated in 2001. Plaintiff's attorney Kevin O'Hanlon described the jury verdict as a message to school districts across Texas to abide by the law and not play politics. Donna ISD's lawyer Eileen Leeds had described the former superintendent's lawsuit as motivated by greed. The federal jury also awarded damages against Donna ISD's former attorneys – lawyer Gustavo Acevedo and Jaime Munoz each to pay $87,750 to plaintiff Andres Martinez for violating his constitutional rights of due process. Both Acevedo and Munoz filed an appeal with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals (case no. 10-40352) which was dismissed by the appeals court on May 24, 2010. In April 2006, the chief financial officer of Donna ISD filed complaints with FBI-McAllen, Texas Education Agency, and Department of Justice regarding widespread corruption, extortion, bribery, theft, and abuse of taxpayer money at Donna ISD. All agencies found his comments were not substantiated with factual data and his motivation was due to his upcoming termination. The Texas Education Agency investigated the complaints and issued its final investigative report in 2007. TEA found the CFO had incorrectly used federal funds. As a result of TEA's report, Donna ISD supt., Joe D. Gonzalez moved to terminate the CFO and worked with TEA to rectify the situation. There were no findings against any school district employees. TEA praised supt., Joe D. Gonzalez, for his quick action and integrity to the Texas school financial system. ==SchoolsHigh schools (Grades 9-12)=== *Donna High School *Donna North High School ===Middle schools (Grades 6-8)=== *A.P.

It Rhymes with Lust is a \\"picture novel\\" published in 1950. It is an early example of a graphic novel. It was written by Arnold Drake and Leslie Waller (under the pseudonym \\"Drake Waller\\"), with black-and- white art by Matt Baker and inker Ray Osrin. It was published by the comic book and magazine company St. John Publications. Drake would go to write for comics publishers DC and Marvel, for which he created such characters as Doom Patrol, Deadman and the original Guardians of the Galaxy. ==Premise== It Rhymes with Lust is an adult story, influenced by film noir and pulp fiction, that depicts life in a steel town and stars a manipulative woman named Rust. Most pulp fiction was westerns, however. ==Plot== Hal Weber, a handsome, downtrodden newspaperman, arrives at Copper City to take a job offered by a former lover, Rust Masson. Rust is the cunning, beautiful widow of the prominent political leader Buck Masson. She now intends to take over the political fortunes of the city for herself, with the assistance of her cold- blooded, violent henchman, Monk Shirl. Her stepdaughter, Audrey Masson, warns Hal of Rust's machinations, but Hal is smitten and easily ensnared by Rust's deceitful attractions. Meanwhile, a rival political power, Marcus Jeffers, also schemes to gain political control, but he is outwitted by Rust and violently beaten by her henchmen, with Hal forced to participate. Plagued by self-loathing, Hal is finally convinced by Audrey's innocence and probity to stand up to Rust. He writes a lengthy expose of Rust and her activities in his newspaper, which causes the city to rise up against her. In a climactic confrontation at the nearby mining facility, Rust's efforts to quell a popular uprising turn fatal when one of her henchmen begins shooting at the miners. Rust and Monk climb into an elevated mining bucket to address the agitated crowd, with Rust proclaiming that \\"Power belongs to whoever has the guts to take it!\\". At that moment, Marcus Jeffers, recovered from his injuries, rushes to the control panel, intending to dump the mining car carrying Rust and Monk. Though he is shot to death by Monk, Jeffers is able to set the cars in motion, sending Rust and Monk toppling out of the car to their deaths in the mine pit below. Hal and Audrey, observing from the ground, are cheered by the crowd. Later that evening, Hal realizes he loves Audrey alone, and the couple embrace. ==Publication history== According to Drake, he and Waller created the concept of \\"picture novels\\" in 1949 while in college in New York City, conceiving \\"a more developed comic book—a deliberate bridge between comic books and book books. ... What we planned was a series of picture novels that were, essentially, action, mystery, Western and romance movies on paper\\". Armed with a two-page sample of an example story, \\"One Man Too Many!\\", Drake and Waller convinced Archer St. John of St. John Publications to launch a line of mass market paperbacks containing original comics work that would appeal to the general public. ==Later rediscovery== Comics writer-artist Michael T. Gilbert wrote in liner notes for 2006 reprinting in The Comics Journal that it \\"reads like a B-movie potboiler, bubbling over with greed, sex, and political corruption\\". The cover tag line reads: \\"She was greedy, heartless and calculating. She knew what she wanted and was ready to sacrifice anything to get it\\". St. John published a second book in the line, the mystery The Case of the Winking Buddha, by pulp novelist Manning Lee Stokes and illustrator Charles Raab. Neither book sold well, and the line was cancelled. It Rhymes with Lust was reprinted in its entirety in the 30th anniversary issue (#277) of The Comics Journal. In March 2007 Dark Horse Books (Dark Horse Comics' book publishing arm) published a softcover reprint with a new afterword by Drake. ==External links== * It Rhymes with Lust at the Grand Comics Database * * * \\"It Rhymes with Lust\\", The Comics Journal #277 (July 2006), 78-143.

It was the stronghold for the Boyd Family, who were lords of Kilmarnock for over 400 years. The Castle takes its name from ‘The Dean’ or wooded valley, a common place name in Scotland. However, until about 1700 it was called Kilmarnock Castle. Owned originally by the Boyd family, it has strong historical connections with many people and events famous in Scottish history. Robert the Bruce who gave the Boyds these lands; James III of Scotland whose sister married a Boyd; the Covenanters, some of whom were imprisoned here; Bonnie Prince Charlie, whose rebellion was joined by the 4th Earl of Kilmarnock and Robert Burns who was encouraged to publish his poetry by the Earl of Glencairn who owned the Castle at that time. ==History== Dean Castle in 1790 Floorplan of Dean Castle, showing dates of the buildings The Boyd Family came into possession of the grounds of Dean Castle in 1316, when Sir Robert Boyd was rewarded the lands of Kilmarnock and West Kilbride by King Robert I for his services at the Battle of Bannockburn. ===Keep=== The Keep was built around 1350 by Sir Robert Boyd's son Sir Thomas Boyd. It was built mainly for defence, the walls are 2–3 metres thick, it has few windows, and the original entrance is high above ground level. There are no arrowslits in the walls of Dean Castle something which is very rare for a Scottish castle of this time period, all of the shooting was done from the battlements at the top. ===Palace=== The first section of palace was built in the mid 1300's by Sir Robert Boyd (1st Lord Boyd) and his son Sir Thomas Boyd. The lands having been given to Sir Robert Boyd for his loyal service in the Scottish Wars for Independence. In 1735 an accidental fire started in the kitchen of the palace, this fire then spread onto the thatched roof where it then spread onto the roof of the keep. The Castle was a complete ruin after this and had almost two centuries of neglect, although some of the buildings always remained in use. The resident of the castle [William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock] had financial problems and could not afford to repair the castle. ===Rebuilding=== The castle was sold by James Boyd in 1746 and the estate changed hands many times. When the 8th Lord Howard de Walden inherited the castle he began its restoration. He completed the keep in 1908 and completed the restoration of the palace in 1946. The Gatehouse The wooden walkway The present Gatehouse was entirely built in 1935–36. It was never present in the original castle. However, it is carefully copied from real sixteenth-century buildings, including details like the windows with half-wooden shutters and half-leaded glass. The overall design and decorative but usable gun loops are copied from the gatehouse built at Tolquhon Castle, Aberdeenshire built in the 1580s. The wooden walkway around the wall guarding the palace was added in the restoration. The castle and gatehouse were designated as a Category A listed building in 1971. ==InteriorKeep=== The keep has four floors. Ground floor The ground floor housed the cellar which housed the original kitchen for the Great hall above. Also on the ground floor was the bottleneck dungeon. When the keep was originally built both the kitchen and dungeon could only be accessed from the first floor via a ladder, there were no doors leading outside. First floor The first floor is where the Great Hall with its large vaulted ceiling is situated. The Great Hall was mainly used for grand banquets and entertainment for the lord and his guests. Guests staying at the castle would have also slept on the floor of the Great Hall. The Hall also served as a court as the lord would act as a judge passing verdicts and sentences for crimes committed in the surrounding area. The first floor also has a minstrel's gallery where a group of travelling minstrels would play instruments and act for the Lord and Lady sitting below. Off the minstrel's gallery is the minstrels changing room, where the travelling players would change into their bright costumes. This room would also have been used by the minstrels to sleep in; the reason for them having their own private quarters was that it was feared that many of them would have been carrying disease. They slept here to stop them passing any ailments on to other guests. The guard room also sits on the first floor. The guard room has the only access to the dungeon in the castle, a small hole in the floor where prisoners were thrown in. A guard would always be present in this room to both guard the dungeon but also the only entrance to the castle, a small door above ground level, which is next to the guard room. Second floor The second floor houses the Solar a large room, used as the private chambers for the Lord and Lady. The Solar could be split into two using a large curtain, one half for Ladies and the other for men. There are two fireplaces in the Solar one on each side for either sex. The Solar also houses a small private chapel. This was used by the Lord and Lady of the castle and a priest who stayed in the castle would deliver mass to the family. A small ladies bowyer is present on this floor also. Third floor This is on top of the keep where archers could defend the castle if attacked. On the third floor there is also a small set of apartments for soldiers to stay in. The palace ===Palace=== The palace was mainly designed for comfort. On the ground floor of the palace was the kitchen with a large fireplace and oven. The first floor has the banqueting hall, and above on the second hall had bedrooms for the family. The original staircase leading up to the first floor was a wooden one which ran up the outside of the building; however, due to the wet climate a stone staircase was later added inside the palace. Defence was not ignored in the construction of the palace. The tower has projecting battlements and Lord Boyd's private apartments were inside. This tower was known as the Laigh or Low Tower; although high, it is lower than the keep. Also the courtyard was protected by a high wall which was called the Barmkin. This protected the various other buildings housed in the courtyard, such as stables, stores and blacksmiths. ==The castle today== The Dower House next to the castle is Category B listed In 1975 the 9th Lord Howard de Walden gifted the castle, estate, his father's collections of arms and armour, and his grandfather's collection of musical instruments to the people of Kilmarnock. The collections of arms and armour are on display in the Great Hall of the keep and the musical instruments are on display in the Solar of the keep. The banqueting hall displays many items owned by East Ayrshire council including Kilmarnock Edition of Robert Burns poetry and many works of art. The private chamber of the Earls of Kilmarnock has a complete model of the castle. Legend has it that after the 4th Earl of Kilmarnock was beheaded for treason in London on 18 August 1746 his head was carried back to Dean castle and was stored in a large chest which is still present in the Laigh Tower. The memorial plaque The story of the 4th Earl's head being kept in the castle has attracted many ghost hunters who have studied the castle and believe there is a presence in the palace. A large bust of William Wallace is on display on the ground floor of the palace. Dean castle and Country Park is maintained by East Ayrshire Council and is free to access.

It serves Lake Pleasant Regional Park and serves as a northern bypass around the often congested stretches of US 60 through the northwest suburbs of the Phoenix metropolitan area. From end to end, it is long. The Carefree Highway is the inspiration for a 1974 Gordon Lightfoot song of the same name. ==Route description== Stretches of the highway are known as the Morristown-New River Highway, Lake Pleasant Highway, and Carefree Highway, the last of which actually extends past I-17 to Tom Darlington Drive in Carefree. This stretch of Carefree Highway is sometimes numbered as SR 74 on maps, but is not actually part of the state highway system. This route offers good views of undeveloped desert landscapes, especially of large saguaro and other desert plants. It is frequently used as an alternate route to US 60 (Grand Avenue) between Phoenix and Wickenburg for motorists traveling to and from Las Vegas, Nevada, with fewer traffic signals than using US 60 directly. ==History== From 1927 to 1931, SR 74 was assigned from Wickenburg west to Ehrenberg; this stretch of highway was renumbered as part of U.S. Route 60 (US 60). In 1962, SR 74 was assigned to a new planned alignment, to be built from New River southwest to Morristown. The leg east of Lake Pleasant Regional Park was originally planned to angle northeast away from its current alignment towards New River. But by 1974, the highway heading eastbound abruptly ended southeast of Lake Pleasant, at Lake Pleasant Road and the Carefree Highway; that same year, Carefree Highway between SR 74 and I-17 was designated SR 74T (Temporary 74). On October 18, 1989, the \\"Temporary\\" banner was officially removed from the Carefree Highway leg. ==Future== The passage of a sales tax extension by voters in Maricopa County in 2004 provided significant funding for highway improvements throughout the region. The Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) will use a portion of that funding to acquire right-of-way along SR 74 for future improvements, but has no plans to upgrade the highway to a controlled access freeway until sometime after 2025. ADOT is also in the planning stages for a bypass around Wickenburg. This bypass would effectively continue SR 74 beyond its current western terminus with US 60 to connect to the planned alignment of future I-11. Whether this bypass would be marked as SR 74 or not is undetermined. ==Major intersectionsSee also== * * ==References *SR 74 at Arizona Roads 074 Category:Transportation in Maricopa County, Arizona Category:Transportation in Phoenix, Arizona Category:U.S. Route 60 ","title":"Arizona State Route 74"},{"id":"6203260","text":"Odem-Edroy Independent School District is a public school district based in Odem, Texas (USA).

It was founded in 1961, by a group of dedicated entertainers working on an idea proposed by Al Gillyon. The society is modelled on the Grand Order of Water Rats. Its membership is exclusively of men, although the members wives, partners and friends often help out in varying capacities. MICE is an acronym for \\"Men in Charitable Endeavour\\". ==The beginning== In 1960, Al Gillyon proposed the setting up of an organisation in Kingston upon Hull similar to the Grand Order of Water Rats. The idea was talked about in clubs, at shows, even in people's front rooms after a show. But, in the words of Al Gillyon, \\"We cannot hold a first meeting until permission has been obtained from the Variety Artist Association\\" of which all were loyal members. Permission of the association was granted and the first ever meeting To which hirteen entertainers were invited, was held at the Windmill Hotel, Witham, Kingston upon Hull on 13 February 1961. Ten were able to attend. Officers were elected, it was agreed that the aims of the group, Fellowship, Benevolence and Charity should be paramount and the group should be known as \\"The Society of MICE\\". ===The Offices of the Society=== Terry Matsell, one of the founder members, and the first SCRIBE MOUSE The Society has the usual committee structure, with a President and Vice-president elected annually, chosen singly by the outgoing President and announced at the annual dinner, which is held in mid February. There are also positions for chairman, Secretary, Treasurer and the Steward to the Elders. The only difference is the title of these positions, all of which are extremely fitting:- *President = KING MOUSE *Vice-President = PRINCE MOUSE *Chairman = TRAP GUARD *Secretary = SCRIBE MOUSE *Treasurer = KEEPER OF THE CHEESE *Steward to the Elders = PILOT MOUSE There are other positions within the society, including the CONCERT MOUSE, who organises the concerts. ===Founder Members=== The following: *Al Gillyon *Harry Hemingway *Clive Hunter *Terry Matsell *Jimmy Welsh *Jack Wilkinson *Brian Winchester are considered to be the founder members of the society as they were either present at the very first meeting of the society, or offered their apologies for absence. From these members, the first KING MOUSE was Al Gillyon, the first PRINCE MOUSE was Jack Wilkinson, the first SCRIBE MOUSE was Terry Matsell, and the first TRAP GUARD was Jimmy Welsh, who at the time was also the Vice-Chairman of the Variety Artists Association. ==Today== The Society is currently made up of Singers & Entertainers, mainly from the Kingston upon Hull area, along with many other members who perform equally as important roles behind the scenes. Members of the 'Old Flames' (Retired members of Humberside Fire and Rescue Service) have also joined the society\\" and Stars in Their Eyes\\" champion Ian Moor is a member and former holder of the office of Prince Mouse. The Society's aim is to raise funds for local good causes and charities, by means of live concert shows and other fund raising events. The society holds tombola & raffle stalls at various outdoor events throughout the summer and concerts are usually twice monthly in and around the Kingston upon Hull area. Venues vary from clubs to residential homes. It holds meetings every fortnight, to discuss future concerts and other matters regarding fund raising for the community. The meeting venue has changed several times over the years, and is referred to by members as the MOUSE HOLE. The MICE Singers ===The MICE Singers=== In 1996, the society added an extra act to the concerts, in the form of a choir, made up of several of the society's members. Initially called \\"The Bolder Boys\\", named after Harry Bolder, who conducted the choir in its early years and whose idea it was to form the choir, today it is known as \\"The MICE Singers\\". As well as regular appearances at the society's concerts, they perform at many other venues, and are now in great demand throughout the year, with appearances at weddings, residential homes, harvest festivals, schools, and other events. ===Anthem=== The Society has an anthem, with lyrics written by one of the founder members, Clive Hunter, who adapted the words to the tune of Three Blind Mice. The anthem is sung at all concerts, and at the annual dinner by all the members present. ===The King's Special Project=== Each year the elected King Mouse nominates a charity or organisation to be the prime beneficiary of the years fundraising efforts and specific concerts and events are chosen to raise funds solely for this purpose. A cheque for the grand total raised is then presented to a representative from the charity or organisation at the annual \\"Special Presentation Evening\\", which is held at the end of January, shortly before the annual dinner. ==Former King & Prince Mouse== The 2007 King & Prince Mouse (L-R) Tony Lazenby (Prince Mouse) & Trevor Davies (King Mouse) The 2006 King & Prince Mouse (L-R) Trevor Davies (Prince Mouse) & Brian Hill (King Mouse) {  !width=\\"50\\"Year !width=\\"190\\"King Mouse !width=\\"190\\"Prince Mouse !width=\\"400\\"King's Special Project - ! 1961  Al Gillyon  Jack Wilkie - ! 1962  Harry Hemingway  Billy Wilkie - ! 1963  Alf Harriman  Norman Smith - ! 1964  Clive Hunter  Cliff Northage - ! 1965  Pat Cornell  Dave Ford - ! 1966  Terry Matsell  Barry Walden - ! 1967  Ray Blythe  Gary Anders - ! 1968  Brian Winchester  Normal Bell - ! 1969  Dave Ford  Ted Robinson - ! 1970  Tommy Render  David Pinchon - ! 1971  Derek Wilson  Eric Whitworth - ! 1972  Barry Walden  Stan Thompson - ! 1973  Eric Whitworth  Peter Gatens - ! 1974  Roger Nettleton  Doug Batty - ! 1975  Arthur Mortimer  Paul Julian - ! 1976  Stan Chapman  Jack Ferry - ! 1977  Stan Thompson  David Spelman - ! 1978  David Pinchon  Harry Clark - ! 1979  Jack Ferry  Mike Leadham - ! 1980  Peter Gatens  Brian Winchester - ! 1981  Harry Clark  Reg Stone - ! 1982  Colin Tovey  Brian Denman - ! 1983  Terry Loftus  Les Hewitt - ! 1984  David Spelman  Charlie Dunne - ! 1985  Les Hewitt  Garry Gillyett - ! 1986  Paul Julian  Fred Phillips - ! 1987  Brian Denman  Harry Gillyett - ! 1988  Fred Phillips  Richard Winchester - ! 1989  Harry Gillyett  Derek Flowers - ! 1990  David Pinchon  Arthur Mortimer - ! 1991  Bob McArthur  Terry Matsell - ! 1992  Terry Loftus  Roger Nettleton - ! 1993  Terry Matsell  Les Hewitt  Spirometer for Kingston General Hospital, Hull - ! 1994  George Lazenby  Colin Hughes - ! 1995  David Spelman  Colin Tovey - ! 1996  Barry Walden  Craig Leach  Oncology ward at Hull Royal Infirmary - ! 1997  Arthur Mortimer  Albert Ellerington - ! 1998  Derek Wilson  James Booth - ! 1999  Roger Nettleton  Ian Moor  Frederick Holmes & Ganton special schools - ! 2000  Stan Flowers  Peter Gatens - ! 2001  Craig Leach  Dean Mortimer - ! 2002  Dean Mortimer  Dennis Ruston - ! 2003  Peter Gatens  Barry Walden - ! 2004  Steve Jackson  John Maxwell  Strokewatch - ! 2005  Albert Ellerington  Brian Hill  Dove House Hospice - ! 2006  Brian Hill  Trevor Davies  DebRA & HERIB - ! 2007  Trevor Davies  Tony Lazenby  Frederick Holmes special school & Cystic Fibrosis - ! 2008  Barry Walden  Mike Medd - ! 2009  Dean Mortimer  Albert Ellerington - ! 2010  Mike Medd  Peter Briggs - ! 2011  Terry Matsel  Barry Walden - ! 2012  Peter Briggs  Kristian Burke - ! 2013  George Lazenby  Tervor Davies - ! 2014  Phil Webber  Mike Medd - ! 2015  Peter Briggs  Fred Phillips - ! 2016  Lee Kamen  Kenny Church/Fred Phillips - ! 2017  Kristian Burke  Dean Wildbore  Kids hull } ==External links== *The Society's Home Page *Frederick Holmes special school – King's Special Project 2007 *Cystic Fibrosis Trust – King's Special Project 2007 *Cystic Fibrosis Worldwide – King's Special Project 2007 *Cystic Fibrosis on NHS Direct – King's Special Project 2007 *Online Photo Galleries Category:Charity fundraisers Category:Organisations based in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Variety shows Category:1961 establishments in England ","title":"The Society of M.I.C.E."},{"id":"6203277","text":"Kapila may refer to: ==Places== * the river also called Kabini ==People== * Kapila, a Vedic sage * Kapila Athukorala, Sri Lankan politician * Mukesh Kapila, British civil servant and United Nations official * Kapila Vatsyayan (b. 1928), Indian arts scholar and Rajya Sabha M.P. * Kapila Wijegunawardene (b. 1964), a Sri Lankan cricketer ==Kapil== * Kapil Dev, Indian cricketer * Kapil Sharma, Indian comedian * Kapil Sibal, Indian politician ","title":"Kapila (disambiguation)"},{"id":"6203282","text":"Queen City Independent School District is a public school district based in Queen City, Texas (USA).

He played all or part of seven seasons in Major League Baseball, primarily as an infielder. == Professional career  First Cardinals stint === DaVanon attended Hoover High School (San Diego), CA. He was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 1st round of the secondary phase of the 1966 MLB amateur draft. He was then selected with the 24th pick in the 1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft by the San Diego Padres, and was a member of their first Opening Day roster in 1969. === Padres === DaVanon made his major league debut for the Padres on April 11 as a pinch hitter. Then, just six games into the season, the Padres sent their starting shortstop, Rafael Robles, to the minor leagues, and tabbed DaVanon as his replacement. His tenure as Robles' replacement didn't last much longer, as he was benched in mid-May after hitting just .145 in 23 games. After playing just one more game, he was traded back to the Cardinals for Sonny Ruberto and John Sipin. === Second Cardinals stint === Back with the team that drafted him, DaVanon returned to the minor leagues. He spent most of the rest of 1969 as well as most of 1970 with the Tulsa Oilers, playing in 27 major league games during that time. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Moe Drabowsky on November 30, 1970.\\"Center Fielders Are Exchanged,\\" The New York Times, Tuesday, December 1, 1970. Retrieved March 10, 2020 === Orioles === DaVanon spent the entire 1971 season with the major league Orioles, serving as a reserve infielder, mainly backing up second baseman Davey Johnson and shortstop Mark Belanger. In his first full season in the majors, he batted .235 in 38 games. However, he was sent back to the minor leagues to start the 1972 season, and in midseason he was traded to the California Angels for Roger Repoz, a veteran outfielder who was also in the minors at the time. === Angels === The Angels kept DaVanon in the minors for the rest of the season, and he wound up batting a combined .240 in Triple-A. He returned to the majors the following spring, spending most of 1973 at the end of the Angels' bench. Although he played in 41 games, he came to the plate just 52 times, batting .245. He was sent back to the minors at the end of July, then at the tail end of the season he was traded back to the Cardinals once more, this time for fellow infielder Bill Stein. === Third Cardinals stint === 1974 found DaVanon in a familiar pattern, splitting the year between the Cardinals and the minor leagues. He started the year with Triple-A Tulsa, and was called up in July. He played in 30 games with the Cardinals, batting just .150. On January 3, 1975, his contract was sold to the Detroit Tigers, but he was released just 20 days later. He was signed by the Cleveland Indians on February 19, and then just before Opening Day his contract was sold again, this time to the Houston Astros. === Astros === DaVanon began the 1975 season in the minor leagues once more. However, in late July, Astros starting shortstop Roger Metzger was injured. Larry Milbourne filled in briefly, but DaVanon was called up on August 1. In his first shot at a starting job in over six years, DaVanon responded with his best hitting as a major leaguer to date, as he batted .274 in 25 games in August, mostly at shortstop but also at second base. He also hit his first major league home run since 1969 on August 11 off Harry Parker of the Cardinals. He finished the season batting .278. 1976 found DaVanon in the majors for the entire season for the first time since 1971. Although he was still relegated to a reserve role behind Metzger and Rob Andrews, he set career highs in almost every category, batting .290 with 20 RBI, which doubled his previous career high of 10, in 61 games. After the season, however, he was headed back to the Cardinals once again, this time being traded with pitcher Larry Dierker for outfielder Bob Detherage and catcher Joe Ferguson. In the 1976-1977 offseason, he made an appearance on _Hollywood Squares_ as a contestant. At the end of the show, host Peter Marshall said he would appreciate it if he would bobble a ball hit by Pete LaCock, who played for the Chicago Cubs. LaCock is the son of Marshall. === Fourth Cardinals stint === Despite his 1976 season, DaVanon once again found himself buried at the end of the Cardinals bench behind Garry Templeton, Mike Tyson, Don Kessinger and Mike Phillips. In the first month of the season, he was only able to get into nine games, in which he failed to get a hit in eight at bats. He was released on May 11, at which point he retired to return to his home in Houston. == Personal life == DaVanon is the father of former Major League Baseball outfielder Jeff DaVanon.

Bread covered with linen proofing cloth in the background. In cooking, proofing (also called proving) is a step in the preparation of yeast bread and other baked goods where the dough is allowed to rest and rise a final time before baking. During this rest period, yeast ferments the dough and produces gases, thereby leavening the dough. In contrast, proofing or blooming yeast (as opposed to proofing the dough) may refer to the process of first suspending yeast in warm water, a necessary hydration step when baking with active dry yeast.Instant dry yeast may be placed directly into flour without hydrating first. Proofing can also refer to the process of testing the viability of dry yeast by suspending it in warm water with carbohydrates (sugars). If the yeast is still alive, it will feed on the sugar and produce a visible layer of foam on the surface of the water mixture. Fermentation rest periods are not always explicitly named, and can appear in recipes as \\"Allow dough to rise.\\" When they are named, terms include \\"bulk fermentation\\", \\"first rise\\", \\"second rise\\", \\"final proof\\" and \\"shaped proof\\". ==Dough processes== Croissants proofing on plastic tray Dough, resting and rising in bulk fermentation 40 minutes later The process of making yeast- leavened bread involves a series of alternating work and rest periods. Work periods occur when the dough is manipulated by the baker. Some work periods are called mixing, kneading, and folding, as well as division, shaping, and panning. Work periods are typically followed by rest periods, which occur when dough is allowed to sit undisturbed. Particular rest periods include, but are not limited to, autolyse, bulk fermentation and proofing. Proofing, also sometimes called final fermentation, is the specific term for allowing dough to rise after it has been shaped and before it is baked. Some breads begin mixing with an autolyse. This refers to a period of rest after the initial mixing of flour and water, a rest period that occurs sequentially before the addition of yeast, salt and other ingredients. This rest period allows for better absorption of water and helps the gluten and starches to align. The autolyse is credited to Raymond Calvel, who recommended it as a way to reduce kneading time and thereby improve the flavor and color of bread. 'Proofing the yeast' is a hydration process that occurs when dry yeast is mixed with warm water and allowed to rest for a short time. The minimum weight of water required may be calculated: . Yeast viability can be tested by mixing yeast in warm water and sugar, and following a short rest period during which the cells first accommodate to the environment and then begin to grow, a layer of foam is developed by the action of the yeast, a sign of primary fermentation and live yeast. Typically 60 ml ( cup) water at and 2 g ( teaspoon) of sugar are used, or expressed differently, a sugar weight of about 3.5% of the water's weight. While this sugar may be sucrose or table sugar, instead it may be glucose or maltose. Fermentation typically begins when viable baker's yeast or a starter culture is added to flour and water. Enzymes in the flour and yeast create sugars, which are consumed by the yeast, which in turn produce carbon dioxide and alcohol. Specifically, the grain enzyme diastase begins to convert starch in the grain to maltose. The baker's yeast enzyme maltase converts maltose into glucose, invertase converts any added sucrose to glucose and fructose, and zymase converts glucose and fructose to carbon dioxide gas which makes the dough rise, and alcohol which gives the baked bread flavor. Sourdough starters also produce lactic and acetic acids, further contributing to flavor. When the yeast cells die, they release high quantities of a protease which snip protein strands, and in large dieoffs result in soft, sticky dough, less baked volume and a coarse crumb, but in smaller dieoffs, increase dough extensibility and baked volume. Different bread varieties will have different process requirements. These are generally classified as either straight or sponge dough processes. Straight doughs will require only a single mixing period. During bulk fermentation straight-dough recipes may instruct a baker to \\"punch down\\" or \\"deflate\\" the dough, while artisan bakers will use terms like \\"stretching\\", \\"folding\\", and \\"degassing\\", meaning to expel gas from the carbon dioxide bubbles that have formed. Sponge doughs will need multiple mixing periods. Overproofing occurs when a fermenting dough has rested too long. Its bubbles have grown so large that they have popped and tunneled, and dough baked at this point would result in a bread with poor structure. Length of rest periods, including proofing, can be determined by time at specific temperatures or by characteristics. Often the \\"poke method\\" is used to determine if a dough has risen long enough. If the dough, when poked, springs back immediately it is underproofed and needs more time. Some breads are considered fully proofed if the indent left by the poke springs back slowly, while others are considered fully proofed when the indent remains and does not spring back. A bread that is properly proofed will balance gas production with the ability of the bread's gluten structure to contain it, and will exhibit good oven spring when baked. A bread that is under- or overproofed will have less oven spring and be more dense. An overproofed bread may even collapse in the oven as the volume of gas produced by the yeast can no longer be contained by the gluten structure. Retarding may occur at any time during fermentation and is accomplished by placing the dough into a dough retarder, refrigerator, or other cold environment to slow the activity of the yeast. The retarding stage is often used in sourdough bread recipes to allow the bread to develop its characteristic flavor. A cold fermentation stage is sometimes used to develop flavor in other artisan breads, with a part of the dough (\\"pre- ferment\\") before the final mixing, with the entire dough during bulk fermentation, or in the final fermentation stages after shaping. ==Proofing equipment== Bread proofer for home use Commercial dough proofer To ensure consistent results and maintain baking schedules, specialized tools are used to manipulate the speed and qualities of fermentation. A dough proofer is a warming chamber used in baking that encourages fermentation of dough by yeast through warm temperatures and controlled humidity. It is also called a proofing box, proofing oven or proofing cabinet. The warm temperatures increase the activity of the yeast, resulting in increased carbon dioxide production and a higher, faster rise. Dough is typically allowed to rise in the proofer before baking, but can also be used for the first rise, or bulk fermentation. Desired proofer temperatures can range from ; cooler temperatures are achieved in a dough retarder, see below. Commercial bakers typically use large, temperature- and humidity-controlled proofers, whereas home bakers employ a variety of methods to create a warm, humid environment for dough rising. Examples include a home oven with a bowl of water and the pilot light on, a box with a bowl of hot water in it (the water is replaced periodically to maintain warmth), or a counter top proofer (an electric appliance) designed for home use. A dough retarder is a refrigerator used to control the fermentation of yeast when proofing dough. Lowering the temperature of the dough produces a slower, longer rise with more varied fermentation products, resulting in more complex flavors. In sourdough bread- making, cold decreases the activity of wild yeast relative to the Lactobacilli, which produce flavoring products such as lactic acid and acetic acid. Sourdough that is retarded before baking can result in a more sour loaf. To prevent the dough from drying, air flow in the dough retarder is kept to a minimum. Home bakers may use cloth or other cover for dough that is kept for a longer period in the refrigerator. Commercial bakers often retard dough at approximately , while home bakers typically use refrigerators set at about or below. Wicker Banneton (rye straw proofing basket) A banneton is a type of basket used to provide structure for shaped loaves of bread during proofing. Banneton baskets are also known as brotform or proofing baskets. It is normally used for doughs that are too soft or wet to maintain their shape while rising. Proofing baskets are distinct from loaf pans in that the bread is normally removed from these baskets before baking. Conventionally, these baskets are made out of rattan, but some modern proofing baskets are made out of cane,Usage manual for wood pulp and cane bannetons (Company: Ernst Birnbaum, Owner: Dr. Steffen Heinig ) spruce pulp, terracotta,https://www.fantes.com/mason-cash-round- unglazed-terracotta-banneton-875-in or polypropylene.https://www.meilleurduchef.com/cgi/mdc/l/en/shop/product/mfr- banneton-proving-basket-plastic-oval-750-g.html A banneton will sometimes have a cloth liner, generally made of linen, to prevent dough from sticking to the sides of the basket. Bannetons become more non-stick with use as a small amount of flour accumulates in them. These baskets are used both to provide the loaf with shape and to wick moisture from the crust. Bannetons come in round or oblong shapes. Couche in use Alternatively, a couche (pronounced koosh), bakery couche, or proofing cloth, can be used on which to proof dough. They are used for longer loaves, such as baguettes. Couches are typically made of linen. They should not be washed as flour collects in the weave creating a less-sticky surface. The couche is dusted lightly with flour, then shaped doughs are laid on top of it and folds are placed to separate and support them while proofing. Breads such as sandwich loaves and brioche are normally proofed in the bread pan in which they will be baked. ==See also== * Bread * Fermentation * Lame (kitchen tool) * Roller docker ==NotesReferencesFurther reading== * Jeffrey Hamelman (2004).

Opposition parties criticised the performance of state institutions, as well as criticising their politicisation, but suffered from internal divisions and the formation of new parties.

According to the same poll, the three pro-Serb opposition alliances could each win between 10% and 20% of the vote - potentially enough to unseat the Prime Minister if they succeed in uniting against him.

Born in Faringdon, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire), Burrell emigrated to Canada as a young man, where he eventually became a fruit grower on a farm about two miles east of Grand Forks, British Columbia. His farm was the largest apple tree nursery in the province. He was elected mayor of Grand Forks, British Columbia in 1903. He first ran unsuccessfully for the House of Commons of Canada as the Conservative candidate in the 1904 federal election for the constituency of Yale—Cariboo. He was elected in the 1908 federal election and re-elected in 1911. In 1917 he was re-elected as a Unionist. Burrell served as the Minister of Agriculture in the Borden government from 1911 to 1917, and from 1917 to 1919, as Secretary of State of Canada and Minister of Mines. From 1919 to 1920, he was the Minister of Customs and Inland Revenue. He also helped secure the departure of the Komagata Maru, against those mistreating the passengers and prolonging the departure date. A fire damaged the Parliament Buildings in 1917, and Burrell was badly injured in it. From that time he filled the position of librarian for the Library of Parliament. After leaving politics, he remained in Ottawa and kept the position of Parliamentary Librarian until his death in 1938. He is buried in Beechwood Cemetery. Burrell Creek near Grand Forks, British Columbia, is named in his honour. ==External links== * Serving Agriculture: Canada's Ministers of Agriculture * * Burrell Creek Category:1858 births Category:1938 deaths Category:English emigrants to Canada Category:Conservative Party of Canada (1867–1942) MPs Category:Members of the House of Commons of Canada from British Columbia Category:Members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada Category:Unionist Party (Canada) MPs Category:People from Faringdon Category:Boundary Country Category:Parliamentary Librarians of Canada ","title":"Martin Burrell"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:R}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function F(s,a,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[a[1]||(a[1]=e("section",null,[e("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[e("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"🎉Life Quotes🥳")])])],-1)),e("section",null,[e("div",I,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const L=d(P,[["render",F]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/51.md","filePath":"people/51.md"}'),E={name:"people/51.md"},x=Object.assign(E,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(L)]))}});export{H as __pageData,x as default};
