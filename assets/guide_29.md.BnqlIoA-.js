Various attributes of an image such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point may be enhanced whether for motion pictures, videos, or still images. Color grading and color correction are often used synonymously as terms for this process and can include the generation of artistic color effects through creative blending and compositing of different images. Color grading is generally now performed in a digital process either in a controlled environment such as a color suite, or in any location where a computer can be used in dim lighting. The earlier photochemical film process, referred to as color timing, was performed at a film lab during printing by varying the intensity and color of light used to expose the rephotographed image. Since, with this process alone, the user was unable to immediately view the outcome of their changes, the use of a Hazeltine color analyzer was common for viewing these modifications in real time. == Color timing == Color timing is used in reproducing film elements. \\"Color grading\\" was originally a lab term for the process of changing color appearance in film reproduction when going to the answer print or release print in the film reproduction chain. By the late 2010s, this film grading technique had become known as color timing and still involved changing the duration of exposure through different filters during the film development process. Color timing is specified in printer points which represent presets in a lab contact printer where 7-12 printer points represent one stop of light. The number of points per stop varied based upon negative or print stock and different presets at Film Labs. In a film production, the creative team would meet with the ‚ÄúLab Timer‚Äù who would watch a running film and make notes dependent upon the team's directions. After the session, the Timer would return to the Lab, and put the film negative on a device (the Hazeltine) which had preview filters with a controlled backlight, and pick exact settings of each printer point for each scene. These settings were then punched onto a paper tape and fed to the high-speed printer where the negative was exposed through a backlight to a print stock. Filter settings were changed on the fly to match the printer lights that were on the paper tape. For complex work such as visual effects shots, \\"wedges‚Äù running through combinations of filters were sometimes processed to aid the choice of the correct grading. This process is used wherever Film materials are being reproduced. == Telecine == With the advent of television, broadcasters quickly realised the limitations of live television broadcasts and they turned to broadcasting feature films from release prints directly from a telecine. This was before 1956 when Ampex introduced the first Quadruplex videotape recorder (VTR) VRX-1000. Live television shows could also be recorded to film and aired at different times in different time zones by filming a video monitor. The heart of this system was the kinescope, a device for recording a television broadcast to film.Kallenberger, Richard H., Cvjetnicanin, George D. (1994). Film into Video: A Guide to Merging the Technologies. Focal Press. The early telecine hardware was the \\"film chain\\" for broadcasting from film and utilized a film projector connected to a video camera. As explained by Jay Holben in American Cinematographer Magazine, \\"The telecine didn't truly become a viable post- production tool until it was given the ability to perform colour correction on a video signal.\\"Holben, Jay (May 1999). \\"From Film to Tape\\" American Cinematographer Magazine, pp. 108‚Äì122. === How telecine coloring works === In a Cathode-ray tube (CRT) system, an electron beam is projected at a phosphor- coated envelope, producing a spot of light the size of a single pixel. This beam is then scanned across a film frame from left to right, capturing the \\"vertical\\" frame information. Horizontal scanning of the frame is then accomplished as the film moves past the CRT's beam. Once this photon beam passes through the film frame, it encounters a series of dichroic mirrors which separate the image into its primary red, green and blue components. From there, each individual beam is reflected onto a photomultiplier tube (PMT) where the photons are converted into an electronic signal to be recorded to tape. In a charge-coupled device (CCD) telecine, a white light is shone through the exposed film image onto a prism, which separates the image into the three primary colors, red, green and blue. Each beam of colored light is then projected at a different CCD, one for each color. The CCD converts the light into an electronic signal, and the telecine electronics modulate these into a video signal that can then be color graded. Early color correction on Rank Cintel MkIII CRT telecine systems was accomplished by varying the primary gain voltages on each of the three photomultiplier tubes to vary the output of red, green and blue. Further advancements converted much of the color- processing equipment from analog to digital and then, with the next-generation telecine, the Ursa, the coloring process was completely digital in the 4:2:2 color space. The Ursa Gold brought about color grading in the full 4:4:4 color space. Color correction control systems started with the Rank Cintel TOPSY (Telecine Operations Programming SYstem) in 1978. In 1984 Da Vinci Systems introduced their first color corrector, a computer-controlled interface that would manipulate the color voltages on the Rank Cintel MkIII systems. Since then, technology has improved to give extraordinary power to the digital colorist. Today there are many companies making color correction control interfaces including Da Vinci Systems, Pandora International, Pogle and more. Some telecines are still in operation in 2018. == Color correction == Some of the main artistic functions of color correction (digital color grading): *Reproduce accurately what was shot *Compensate for variations in the material (i.e., film errors, white balance, varying lighting conditions) *Compensate for the intended viewing environment (dark, dim, bright surrounds) *Optimize base appearance for inclusion of special visual effects *Establish a desired artistic 'look' *Enhance and/or alter the mood of a scene ‚Äî the visual equivalent to the musical accompaniment of a film; compare also film tinting Note that some of these functions must be prioritized over others; for example, color grading may be done to ensure that the recorded colors match those of the original scene, whereas other times, the goal may instead be to establish a very artificial stylized look. Traditionally, color grading was done towards practical goals. For example, in the film Marianne, grading was used so that night scenes could be filmed more cheaply in daylight. Secondary color correction was originally used to establish color continuity, however the trend today is increasingly moving towards creative goals, such as improving the aesthetics of an image, establishing stylized looks, and setting the mood of a scene through color. Due to this trend, some colorists suggest the phrase \\"color enhancement\\" over \\"color correction\\". === Primary and secondary color grading === Primary color grading affects the whole image by providing control over the color density curves of red, green, blue color channels, across the entire frame. Secondary correction can isolate a range of hue, saturation and brightness values to bring about alterations in hue, saturation and luminance only in that range, allowing the grading of secondary colors, while having a minimal or usually no effect on the remainder of the color spectrum. Using digital grading, objects and color ranges within a scene can be isolated with precision and adjusted. Color tints can be manipulated and visual treatments pushed to extremes not physically possible with laboratory processing. With these advancements, the color correction process has become increasingly similar to well-established digital painting techniques, ushering forth a new era of digital cinematography. === Masks, mattes, power windows === The evolution of digital color grading tools has advanced to the point where the colorist can use geometric shapes (such as mattes or masks in photo software such as Adobe Photoshop) to isolate color adjustments to specific areas of an image. These tools can highlight a wall in the background and color only that wall, leaving the rest of the frame alone, or color everything but that wall. Subsequent color correctors (typically software-based) have the ability to use spline-based shapes for even greater control over isolating color adjustments. Color keying is also used for isolating areas to adjust. Inside and outside of area-based isolations, digital filtration can be applied to soften, sharpen or mimic the effects of traditional glass photographic filters in nearly infinite degrees. === Motion tracking === When trying to isolate a color adjustment on a moving subject, the colorist traditionally would have needed to manually move a mask to follow the subject. In its most simple form, motion tracking software automates this time-consuming process using algorithms to evaluate the motion of a group of pixels. These techniques are generally derived from match moving techniques used in special effects and compositing work. == Digital intermediate == The evolution of the telecine device into film scanning allowed the digital information scanned from a film negative to be of sufficient resolution to transfer back to film. In the early 1990s, Kodak developed the Cineon Film System to capture, manipulate, and record back to film and they called this the ‚ÄúDigital Intermediate‚Äù. This term stuck. The first Digital Intermediate of any form was the Cinesite restoration of ‚ÄúSnow White and The Seven Dwarves‚Äù in 1993. [Previously in 1990 for \\"Rescuers Down Under\\", the Disney CAPS system had been used to scan artwork, color and composite it, and then record it to film, but this was also intermixed with a traditional lab development process over a length of time] In the late 1990s, the films Pleasantville and O Brother, Where Art Thou? advanced the technology to the point that the creation of a digital intermediate was practical, which greatly expanded the capabilities of the digital telecine colorist in a traditionally film-oriented world. After 2010, almost all feature films go through the DI process, while manipulation through photochemical processing is rare or used on archival films. In Hollywood, O Brother, Where Art Thou? was the first film to be wholly digitally graded. The negative was scanned with a Spirit DataCine at 2K resolution, then colors were digitally fine-tuned using a Pandora MegaDef color corrector on a Virtual DataCine. The process took several weeks, and the resulting digital master was output to film again with a Kodak laser recorder to create a master internegative. Modern motion picture processing typically uses both digital cameras and digital projectors and calibrated devices are essential to predict whether the appropriate colors are appearing. === Hardware-based versus software-based systems === Color grading with Scratch In early use, hardware-based systems (da Vinci 2K, Pandora International MegaDEF, etc.) have historically offered better performance but a smaller feature set than software-based systems. Their real time performance was optimised to particular resolution and bit depths, as opposed to software platforms using standard computer industry hardware that often trade speed for resolution independence, e.g. Apple's Color (previously Silicon Color Final Touch), ASSIMILATE SCRATCH, Adobe SpeedGrade and SGO Mistika. While hardware-based systems always offer real-time performance, some software-based systems need to pre-render as the complexity of the color grading increases. On the other hand, software-based systems tend to have more features such as spline-based windows/masks and advanced motion tracking. The line between hardware and software no longer exists as many software-based color correctors (e.g. Pablo , Mistika, SCRATCH, Autodesk Lustre, Nucoda Film Master and FilmLight's Baselight) use multi processor workstations and a GPU (graphics processing unit) as a means of hardware acceleration. As well, some newer software-based systems use a cluster of multiple parallel GPUs on the one computer system to improve performance at the very high resolutions required for feature film grading. e.g. Blackmagic Design's DaVinci Resolve. Some color grading software like Synthetic Aperture's Color Finesse runs solely as software and will even run on low-end computer systems. High-speed RAID arrays are an essential part of the process for all systems. === Hardware === Hardware systems are no longer common because of the price/performance of software systems. The control panels are placed in a color suite for the colorist to operate the telecine remotely. *Many telecines were controlled by a Da Vinci Systems color corrector 2k or 2k Plus. *Other hardware systems are controlled by Pandora Int.'s Pogle, often with either a MegaDEF, Pixi, or Revolution color grading system. *For some real-time systems used in \\"linear\\" editing, color grading systems required an edit controller. The edit controller controls the telecine and a VTR(s) or other recording/playback devices to ensure frame accurate film frame editing. There are a number of systems which can be used for edit control. Some color grading products such as Pandora Int.'s Pogle have a built-in edit controller. Otherwise, a separate device such as Da Vinci Systems' TLC edit controller would be used. *Older systems are: Renaissance, Classic analog, Da Vinci Systems's: The Whiz (1982) and 888; The Corporate Communications's System 60XL (1982‚Äì1989) and Copernicus-Sunburst; Bosch Fernseh's FRP-60 (1983‚Äì1989); Dubner (1978‚Äì1985?), Cintel's TOPSY (1978), Amigo (1983), and ARCAS (1992) systems. All of these older systems work only with standard-definition 525 and 625 video signals, and are considered near obsolete today. === Software === Color grading The controls are both shown on- screen in an application, controlled by a hardware peripheral, or are sometimes accessed as a plugin to a host application. * Baselight from FilmLight is used for HD, 2K, 4K and 3D color grading. Grade operations are controlled via Blackboard. Program supports variety of film and video formats and codecs. FilmLight systems utilises cluster and cloud technology in Linux environment. * Nucoda from Digital Vision provides advance color grading tools working with ACES and HDR at SD to 8K as well as industry leading restoration and image enhancement tools. * Software like Synthetic Aperture's Color Finesse runs as a plugin in host applications like Apple's Final Cut Pro, Adobe's After Effects and Premiere. *DaVinci Resolve from Blackmagic Design operates on macOS, Windows and Linux, utilizing a cluster of multiple parallel GPUs for real time grading of HD, 2K and 4K images in 2D or Stereoscopic 3D. *Lumetri Color inside of Adobe Premiere Pro is released as a part of Adbe Creative Cloud works on Mac and PC. Prior to Lumetri, Adobe used SpeedGrade which was discontinued on August 22, 2017.Rhome, Calen, , Color Grading Software for Professional Videographers, April 22, 2020 * Magic Bullet Colorista II from Red Giant Software offers multi-step color correction with primary, secondary and master stages inside host applications including Apple's Final Cut Pro, Adobe's After Effects and Premiere. * The Grading Sweet is a package of specialized Color Grading plugins for Apple's Final Cut Pro. * Sony Vegas has many built-in filters as well as third-party plugins for color grading. * Apple Final Cut Studio 2 contains Apple Color which is a dedicated software application for color grading. * Bones Dailies by Digital Film Technology * Other programs have their own color grading options (for example Edius or Blender). * Autodesk Lustre is a high-end color grading solution.

Born in Batesville, Arkansaw Territory; Miller was Arkansas's first native born Governor. Serving two terms in the turbulent period after Reconstruction, Miller's four-year administration marked the beginnings of New Departure Democrats in Arkansas. Running on a platform of economic growth via reconciliation between whites and freedmen, Miller often was opposed by members of his own party during the infancy of the Lost Cause ideology. His plans to pay back a large state debt including the Holford Bonds, valued at $14 million ($ million today), were often interrupted by racial violence, and his support for public schools and universities was often combated by those in his own party. Miller desired an unprecedented third gubernatorial term in 1881, but the Democrats instead nominated Thomas Churchill, a Democratic hard- liner and former Major General in the Confederate States Army. Following his defeat, Miller served on boards of several railroads and as a trustee of the University of Arkansas. Miller also served as Arkansas State Auditor for twelve of the thirty years between 1857 and his death in 1887, making him the third-longest tenured Auditor in Arkansas history. ==Early life== Miller was born on November 23, 1823 on a farm near Batesville, Arkansaw Territory, to John and Clara Moore Miller. Miller's father was a farmer and register of the U.S. Land Office active in Democratic politics, including serving as a presidential elector twice.. At the age of thirteen, Miller is said to have publicly challenged notable local and fervent Whig Fent Noland regarding Martin Van Buren's credentials. He also saw the Arkansas Territory achieve statehood on June 15, 1836. Miller was educated in local schools when the workload on the family farm allowed, and he showed an early interest in law. Although discouraged from pursuing the legal profession by his father, Miller moved from the family farm to Batesville to read law after turning twenty-one in 1844. Miller's political career blossomed upon moving to Batesville, which was the fourth-largest city and one of the most politically prominent cities in Arkansas at the time. He was elected Independence County Clerk in 1848, and married Susan Elizabeth Bevens, the daughter of Third District Judge William Bevins, the following year.. Governor Elias Conway of the prominent Conway Family appointed Miller to become State Auditor when C.C. Danley resigned the post in 1854, causing Miller to resign as Independence County Clerk and accept the statewide office.. Conway himself had served as State Auditor from 1835‚Äì1849, and the post raised Miller's political profile significantly. ==Political career== ===Auditor (1854-1860, 1862-1864, 1874-1876)=== Miller was reelected to that position in 1858, 1860, 1862, and again in 1874 after Reconstruction ended. Miller studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1868. ===Governor (1876-1880)=== Miller was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1876, and was reelected in 1878. Miller was the first native born Arkansas governor. The Miller administration focused on public education and the state's financial problems. He signed legislation that funded the State Blind Asylum and the Arkansas Industrial University. After leaving office Miller served as the Deputy Treasurer of Arkansas in 1881 and 1882. ===Auditor (1887)=== In 1886, he was again elected to the position of State Auditor. ==Personal life== Miller was married to Sarah Susan Bevers and they had seven children. ==Death== Miller is buried at the historic Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock, Arkansas. ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture entry * National Governors Association * Old State House Museum Category:1823 births Category:1887 deaths Category:19th-century American lawyers Category:19th- century American politicians Category:Arkansas lawyers Category:American lawyers admitted to the practice of law by reading law Category:American Presbyterians Category:Arkansas Democrats Category:Burials at Mount Holly Cemetery Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:Governors of Arkansas Category:People from Batesville, Arkansas ","title":"William Read Miller"},{"id":"305300","text":"The National Revolutionary Army (NRA; ), sometimes shortened to Revolutionary Army () before 1928, and as National Army () after 1928, was the military arm of the Kuomintang (KMT, or the Chinese Nationalist Party) from 1925 until 1947 in the Republic of China. It also became the regular army of the ROC during the KMT's period of party rule beginning in 1928. It was renamed the Republic of China Armed Forces after the 1947 Constitution, which instituted civilian control of the military. Originally organized with Soviet aid as a means for the KMT to unify China during the Warlord Era, the National Revolutionary Army fought major engagements in the Northern Expedition against the Chinese Beiyang Army warlords, in the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945) against the Imperial Japanese Army and in the Chinese Civil War against the People's Liberation Army. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the armed forces of the Communist Party of China were nominally incorporated into the National Revolutionary Army (while retaining separate commands), but broke away to form the People's Liberation Army shortly after the end of the war. With the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 1947 and the formal end of the KMT party-state, the National Revolutionary Army was renamed the Republic of China Armed Forces, with the bulk of its forces forming the Republic of China Army, which retreated to the island of Taiwan in 1949. ==History== Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army, emerged from the Northern Expedition as the leader of China. The NRA was founded by the KMT in 1925 as the military force destined to unite China in the Northern Expedition. Organized with the help of the Comintern and guided under the doctrine of the Three Principles of the People, the distinction among party, state and army was often blurred. A large number of the Army's officers passed through the Whampoa Military Academy, and the first commandant, Chiang Kai-shek, became commander-in-chief of the Army in 1925 before launching the successful Northern Expedition. Other prominent commanders included Du Yuming and Chen Cheng. The end of the Northern Expedition in 1928 is often taken as the date when China's Warlord era ended, though smaller-scale warlord activity continued for years afterwards. NRA troops against Sun Chuanfang's private army preparing to defend Shanghai. Hankou during the Northern Expedition. In 1927, after the dissolution of the First United Front between the Nationalists and the Communists, the ruling KMT purged its leftist members and largely eliminated Soviet influence from its ranks. Chiang Kai-shek then turned to Germany, historically a great military power, for the reorganization and modernization of the National Revolutionary Army. The Weimar Republic sent advisers to China, but because of the restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles they could not serve in military capacities. Chiang initially requested famous generals such as Ludendorff and von Mackensen as advisers; the Weimar Republic government turned him down, however, fearing that they were too famous, would invite the ire of the Allies and that it would result in the loss of national prestige for such renowned figures to work, essentially, as mercenaries. When Adolf Hitler became Germany's chancellor in 1933 and disavowed the Treaty, the anti- communist Nazi Party and the anti-communist KMT were soon engaged in close cooperation. with Germany training Chinese troops and expanding Chinese infrastructure, while China opened its markets and natural resources to Germany. Max Bauer was the first adviser to China. The NRA during World War II In 1934, Gen. Hans von Seeckt, acting as adviser to Chiang, proposed an \\"80 Division Plan\\" for reforming the entire Chinese army into 80 divisions of highly trained, well-equipped troops organised along German lines. The plan was never fully realised, as the eternally bickering warlords could not agree upon which divisions were to be merged and disbanded. Furthermore, since embezzlement and fraud were commonplace, especially in understrength divisions (the state of most of the divisions), reforming the military structure would threaten divisional commanders' \\"take\\". Therefore, by July 1937 only eight infantry divisions had completed reorganization and training. These were the 3rd, 6th, 9th, 14th, 36th, 87th, 88th, and the Training Division. Another German general, Alexander von Falkenhausen, came to China in 1934 to help reform the army. However, because of Nazi Germany's later cooperation with the Empire of Japan, he was later recalled in 1937. After his goodbye party with Chiang Kai-shek's family, he promised not to reveal his devised battle plans to the Japanese. Chinese propaganda poster depicting the National Revolutionary Army. For a time, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, Communist forces fought as a nominal part of the National Revolutionary Army, forming the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army units, but this co- operation later fell apart. Throughout the Chinese Civil War the National Revolutionary Army experienced major problems with desertion, with many soldiers switching sides to fight for the Communists. Troops in India and Burma during World War II included the Chinese Expeditionary Force (Burma), the Chinese Army in India and Y Force.See for example Charles F. Romanus and Riley Sunderland, United States Army in World War II: China-Burma-India Theater, United States Army, 1952 The US government repeatedly threatened to cut off aid to China during World War 2 unless they handed over total command of all Chinese military forces to the US. After considerable stalling, the arrangement only fell through due to a particularly insulting letter from the Americans to Chiang.Taylor, Jay. 2009. The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the Struggle for Modern China. Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts , pp. 277-292 After the drafting and implementation of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 1947, the National Revolutionary Army was transformed into the ground service branch of the Republic of China Armed Forces ‚Äì the Republic of China Army (ROCA). ==Structure== Elite German-trained divisions of National Revolutionary Army before the Battle of Wuhan A platoon of the National Revolutionary Army marching in British helmets during a parade in Burma in 1943. The NRA throughout its lifespan recruited approximately 4,300,000 regulars, in 370 Standard Divisions (Ê≠£ÂºèÂ∏´), 46 New Divisions (Êñ∞Á∑®Â∏´), 12 Cavalry Divisions (È®éÂÖµÂ∏´), eight New Cavalry Divisions (Êñ∞Á∑®È®éÂÖµÂ∏´), 66 Temporary Divisions (Êö´Á∑®Â∏´), and 13 Reserve Divisions (È†êÂÇôÂ∏´), for a grand total of 515 divisions. However, many divisions were formed from two or more other divisions, and were not active at the same time. At the apex of the NRA was the National Military Council, also translated as Military Affairs Commission. Chaired by Chiang Kai-Shek, it directed the staffs and commands. It included from 1937 the Chief of the General Staff, General He Yingqin, the General Staff, the War Ministry, the military regions, air and naval forces, air defence and garrison commanders, and support services Around 14 Million were conscripted from 1937-1945. Also, New Divisions were created to replace Standard Divisions lost early in the war and were issued the old division's number. Therefore, the number of divisions in active service at any given time is much smaller than this. The average NRA division had 5,000‚Äì6,000 troops; an average army division had 10,000‚Äì15,000 troops, the equivalent of a Japanese division. Not even the German-trained divisions were on par in terms of manpower with a German or Japanese division, having only 10,000 men. The United States Army's campaign brochure on the China Defensive campaign of 1942‚Äì45 said:United States Army, China Defensive 4 July 1942 ‚Äì 4 May 1945, p.5 > The NRA only had small number of armoured vehicles and mechanised troops.

Late in the Burma Campaign the NRA Army there had an armoured battalion equipped with Sherman tanks. Despite the poor reviews given by European observers to the European-trained Divisions, the Muslim Divisions of the National Revolutionary Army, trained in China (not by Westerners) and led by Ma Clique Muslim generals, frightened the European observers with their appearance and fighting skills in battle. Europeans like Sven Hedin and Georg Vasel were in awe of the appearance Chinese Muslim NRA divisions made and their ferocious combat abilities. They were trained in harsh, brutal conditions. The 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army), trained entirely in China without any European help, was composed of Chinese Muslims and fought and severely mauled an invading Soviet Russian army during the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang. The division was lacking in technology and manpower, but badly damaged the superior Russian force. The Muslim divisions of the army controlled by Muslim Gen. Ma Hongkui were reported by Western observers to be tough and disciplined. Despite having diabetes Ma Hongkui personally drilled with his troops and engaged in sword fencing during training. When the leaders of many of the warlord and provincial armies joined with the KMT and were appointed as officers and generals, their troops joined the NRA. These armies were renamed as NRA divisions. The entire Ma Clique armies were absorbed into the NRA. When the Muslim Ma Clique General Ma Qi joined the KMT, the Ninghai Army was renamed the National Revolutionary Army 26th Division. ===Unit organization=== Chinese Nationalist soldier, age 10, member of a Chinese division from the X Force, boarding planes in Burma bound for China, May 1944. The unit organisation of the NRA is as follows: (Note that a unit is not necessarily subordinate to one immediately above it; several army regiments can be found under an army group, for example.) The commander-in- chief of the NRA from 1925 to 1947 was Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Military Affairs Commission *Military Region √ó12 (Êà∞ÂçÄ) **Army Corps √ó4(ÂÖµÂúò) ‚Äì the Army Corps, ÂÖµÂúò, was one of the largest military formations in the NRA during the Second Sino-Japanese War.Hsu Long-hsuen and Chang Ming-kai, History of The Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945) 2nd Ed., 1971. Translated by Wen Ha-hsiung, Chung Wu Publishing; 33, 140th Lane, Tung-hwa Street, Taipei, Taiwan Republic of China. These Army Corps were composed of a number of Group Armies, Army, Corps, Divisions, Brigades and Regiments. In numbers of divisions, they were larger than Western Army groups. Only four were ever formed to command the large forces defending the Chinese capital during the Battle of Wuhan in 1938.

The Chinese Republic had 133 Corps during the Second Sino-Japanese War. After losses in the early part of the war, under the 1938 reforms, the remaining scarce artillery and the other support formations were withdrawn from the Division and was held at Corps, or Army level or higher. The Corps became the basic tactical unit of the NRA having strength nearly equivalent to an allied Division. ******Division (Â∏´) *******Brigade (ÊóÖ) ********Regiment (Âúò) *********Battalion (Ááü) **********Company (ÈÄ£) ***********Platoon (Êéí) ************Squad (Áè≠) ===Suicide squads=== During the Xinhai Revolution and the Warlord Era of the Republic of China (1912‚Äì1949), \\"Dare to Die Corps\\" () or \\"Suicide squads\\"Êï¢Ê≠ªÈòü_ÁôæÁßëËØçÊù°, so.baike.com; accessed July 15, 2015. were frequently used by Chinese armies. China deployed these suicide units against the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. \\"Dare to Die\\" troops were used by warlords in their armies to conduct suicide attacks. \\"Dare to Die\\" corps continued to be used in the Chinese military. The Kuomintang used one to put down an insurrection in Canton. Many women joined them in addition to men to achieve martyrdom against China's opponents. A \\"dare to die corps\\" was effectively used against Japanese units at the Battle of Taierzhuang. They used swords. Chinese suicide bomber putting on an explosive vest made out of Model 24 hand grenades to use in an attack on Japanese tanks at the Battle of Taierzhuang. Suicide bombing was also used against the Japanese. A Chinese soldier detonated a grenade vest and killed 20 Japanese soldiers at Sihang Warehouse. Chinese troops strapped explosives like grenade packs or dynamite to their bodies and threw themselves under Japanese tanks to blow them up. This tactic was used during the Battle of Shanghai, where a Chinese suicide bomber stopped a Japanese tank column by exploding himself beneath the lead tank, and at the Battle of Taierzhuang where dynamite and grenades were strapped on by Chinese troops who rushed at Japanese tanks and blew themselves up. In one incident at Taierzhuang, Chinese suicide bombers obliterated four Japanese tanks with grenade bundles. ===Penal Battalions=== During the Chinese Civil War the National Revolutionary Army (NRA) was known to have used penal battalions from 1945 to 1949. A unit made up of deserters and those accused of cowardice, the penal battalion was giving such tasks as scouting ahead of the main forces to check for ambushes, crossing rivers and torrents to see whether they were fordable, and walking across unmapped minefields. ===Conscription=== The military was formed through bloody and inhumane conscription campaigns. These are described by Rudolph Rummel as: > This was a deadly affair in which men were kidnapped for the army, rounded > up indiscriminately by press-gangs or army units among those on the roads or > in the towns and villages, or otherwise gathered together. Many men, some > the very young and old, were killed resisting or trying to escape.

Then recruit > camp was no better, with hospitals resembling Nazi concentration camps like > Buchenwald. == Personnel == === Officers === { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\\" - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" ! ! colspan=4 General officers ! colspan=3 Senior commissioned officers ! colspan=3 Junior commissioned officers !

German-equipped Chinese troops practicing a march at the Chinese Military Academy at Chengtu in 1944. For regular provincial Chinese divisions the standard rifles were the Hanyang 88 (copy of Gewehr 88). Central army divisions were typically equipped with the Chiang Kai-shek rifle and other Mauser type rifles from Germany, Belgium and Czechoslovakia. The standard light machine gun were imported or domestically produced of the Czech Brno ZB vz. 26 in the standard 7.92 mm. There were machine guns from other sources, such as Belgian, French and from the Soviet Aid Programme. In general, there were 6-9 LMG's in an infantry company, with the monthly ammunition supply being around 5,000 rounds (for 5 days consumption). Heavy machine guns were mainly locally-made Type 24 water- cooled Maxim guns (which were based on the commercial version of the German MG08), and Type Triple-Ten M1917 Browning machine guns chambered for the standard 8mm Mauser round. On average, every Central Army battalion contained a machine gun company with 5-6 heavy machine guns. They were allotted a monthly supply of 20,000 rounds. The most common sidearm for NCOs and officers was the 7.63 mm Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistol. Submachine guns were not part of any TO&E;, but many were inherited from former warlord armies or locally produced. They were generally carried by the guards of divisional or corps commanders or special service platoon/companies. Some elite units, such as the X Force in Burma used Lend-Lease US equipment. US-equipped Chinese Army in India marching. Generally speaking, the regular provincial army divisions did not possess any artillery. However, some Central Army divisions were equipped with 37 mm PaK 35/36 anti-tank guns, and/or mortars from Oerlikon, Madsen, and Solothurn. Each of these infantry divisions ideally had 6 French Brandt 81 mm mortars and 6 Solothurn 20 mm autocannons. Some independent brigades and artillery regiments were equipped with Bofors 72 mm L/14, or Krupp 72 mm L/29 mountain guns and there were 24 Rheinmetall 150 mm L/32 sFH 18 howitzers (bought in 1934) and 24 Krupp 150 mm L/30 sFH 18 howitzers (bought in 1936). At the start of the war, the NRA and the Tax Police Regiment had three tank battalions armed with German Panzer I light tanks and CV-35 tankettes. After defeat in the Battle of Shanghai the remaining tanks, together with several hundred T-26 and BT-5 tanks acquired from the Soviet Union were reorganised into the 200th Division. Infantry uniforms were basically redesigned Zhongshan suits. Puttees were standard for soldiers and officers alike, since the primary mode of movement for NRA troops was by foot. Troops were also issued sewn field caps. The helmets were the most distinguishing characteristic of these divisions. From the moment German M35 Stahlhelms rolled off the production lines in 1935, and until 1936, the NRA imported 315,000 of these helmets, usually seen with the Blue Sky with a White Sun emblem of the ROC on the sides. These helmets were worn by both the German-trained divisions and regular Central Army divisions. Other helmets included the French Adrian helmet, the British Brodie helmet and later the American M1 helmet. Other equipment included straw shoes for soldiers (cloth shoes for Central Army), leather shoes for officers and leather boots for high-ranking officers. Every soldier was issued ammunition for his weapon, along with ammunition pouches or harness, a water flask, combat knives, food bag, and a gas mask. ==See also== *Whampoa Military Academy *List of German- trained divisions of the National Revolutionary Army *Sino-German cooperation until 1941 *Military history of the Republic of China *Douglas MacArthur ==References== ==Further reading== * Dreyer, Edward L.

He served as the head football coach at Texas Lutheran University (1971‚Äì1975), North Dakota State University (1976‚Äì1978), Southwest Texas State University‚Äînow Texas State University (1979‚Äì1982), Texas Christian University (1983‚Äì1991), and the University of Minnesota (1992‚Äì1996), compiling a career college football record of 159‚Äì131‚Äì3. Wacker won two NAIA Division II National Championships with Texas Lutheran in 1974 and 1975, and two NCAA Division II Football Championships with Southwest Texas State, in 1981 and 1982. ==Early life and education== The son of a Lutheran minister, Wacker was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. He graduated from Valparaiso University in 1960 and went on to further studies at Wayne State University. ==Coaching career== In the early phase of his coaching career, Wacker coached at Texas Lutheran University (1971‚Äì1975), North Dakota State University (1976‚Äì1978), and Southwest Texas State University (1979‚Äì1982). He won four national championships, two at Texas Lutheran and two at Southwest Texas State. ===TCU=== Wacker became head football coach of Texas Christian University after the 1982 season. He had early success at TCU. In 1984, his team was ranked as high as #12, the TCU Frogs' highest ranking since 1960, and was invited to the Bluebonnet Bowl after an 8‚Äì3 record in the regular season. The #12-ranked Frogs lost a showdown for the Southwest Conference title with the #10-ranked Texas Longhorns on November 10 in what remains the third best-attended game in the history of Amon G. Carter Stadium. After the season, Wacker was named as National Coach of the Year by ESPN, the UPI, and The Sporting News. He was awarded the 1984 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award. There was much hype surrounding the Frogs going into the 1985 season, and Wacker appeared on the cover of Dave Campbell's Texas Football alongside his All-American running back, Kenneth Davis, a finalist for the Heisman Trophy in 1984 and a leading candidate for the award in 1985. After the first game of the season, Wacker discovered that several players, including Davis, had been benefiting from a payment plan in violation of NCAA rules. Wacker promptly kicked the players off the team and self-reported the infractions to the NCAA, cementing his reputation as a man of integrity. In 1986, the NCAA slapped TCU with three years' probation and a ban on postseason play in the 1986 season. The most severe penalty in the long run, however, was a reduction to only 25 scholarships in 1987 and 1988. To this day, Horned Frog fans remain bitter that the NCAA imposed such a severe penalty given that the violations were voluntarily reported. As heavy-handed as this penalty was, the NCAA seriously considered banning the Horned Frogs from bowl games and live television for three years and no new scholarships in 1987 or 1988. However, it praised Wacker for taking swift corrective action once the violations came to light, including kicking the players off the team when he was well aware that it would cripple the team for the upcoming season.1986 infraction report Wacker brought the team back to success in 1990, when the 5‚Äì1 Frogs returned to the top 25 for the first time since 1984, before slumping after a season-ending injury to their starting quarterback. In 1991, TCU finished 7‚Äì4 for their first winning season since 1984. However, blowout losses to Texas and Texas A&M; kept the Horned Frogs out of a bowl. This was one of only three winning seasons TCU had from 1985 to 1997. ===Minnesota=== Wacker served as head coach at the University of Minnesota from 1992 to 1996. Although he had a disappointing won-lost record (16‚Äì39) at Minnesota, for three years his teams led the conference with academic all-conference honors. ==Later life, death, and honors== Wacker was an announcer on CBS Radio for two years and then returned to Southwest Texas State University in 1998 to serve as athletic director until 2001. He died after a long battle with cancer in San Marcos, Texas on August 26, 2003. In November 2003, Southwest Texas State named its football field at Bobcat Stadium \\"Jim Wacker Field\\" in his honor. ==Head coaching record== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1937 births Category:2003 deaths Category:American football tackles Category:Augustana (South Dakota) Vikings football coaches Category:Concordia Bulldogs football coaches Category:Minnesota Golden Gophers football coaches Category:North Dakota State Bison football coaches Category:TCU Horned Frogs football coaches Category:Texas Lutheran Bulldogs football coaches Category:Texas State Bobcats athletic directors Category:Texas State Bobcats football coaches Category:Valparaiso Crusaders football players Category:High school football coaches in Oregon Category:Wayne State University alumni Category:Sportspeople from Detroit Category:Players of American football from Michigan Category:Deaths from cancer in Texas ","title":"Jim Wacker"},{"id":"305303","text":"In mathematics, a multiset (or bag, or mset) is a modification of the concept of a set that, unlike a set, allows for multiple instances for each of its elements. The positive integer number of instances, given for each element is called the multiplicity of this element in the multiset. As a consequence, an infinite number of multisets exist, which contain only elements and , but vary by the multiplicity of their elements: * The set contains only elements and , each having multiplicity 1 when is seen as a multiset. * In multiset , the element has multiplicity 2, and has multiplicity 1. * In multiset , and both have multiplicity 3. These objects are all different, when viewed as multisets, although they are the same set, since they all consist of the same elements. As with sets, and in contrast to tuples, order does not matter in discriminating multisets, so and denote the same multiset. To distinguish between sets and multisets, a notation that incorporates square brackets is sometimes used: the multiset can be denoted as . The cardinality of a multiset is constructed by summing up the multiplicities of all its elements. For example, in the multiset the multiplicities of the members , , and are respectively 2, 3, and 1, and therefore the cardinality of this multiset is 6. Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn coined the word multiset in the 1970s, according to Donald Knuth. However, the use of the concept of multisets predates the coinage of word multiset by many centuries. Knuth himself attributes the first study of multisets to the Indian mathematician BhƒÅskarƒÅchƒÅrya, who described permutations of multisets around 1150. Knuth also lists other names that were proposed or used for this concept, including list, bunch, bag, heap, sample, weighted set, collection, and suite. ==History== Wayne Blizard traced multisets back to the very origin of numbers, arguing that ‚Äúin ancient times, the number n was often represented by a collection of n strokes, tally marks, or units.‚Äù These and similar collections of objects are multisets, because strokes, tally marks, or units are considered indistinguishable. This shows that people implicitly used multisets even before mathematics emerged. Practical needs for this structure have caused multisets to be rediscovered several times, appearing in literature under different names. For instance, they were important in early AI languages, such as QA4, where they were referred to as bags, a term attributed to Peter Deutsch. A multiset has been also called an aggregate, heap, bunch, sample, weighted set, occurrence set, and fireset (finitely repeated element set). Although multisets were used implicitly from ancient times, their explicit exploration happened much later. The first known study of multisets is attributed to the Indian mathematician BhƒÅskarƒÅchƒÅrya circa 1150, who described permutations of multisets. The work of Marius Nizolius (1498‚Äì1576) contains another early reference to the concept of multisets. Athanasius Kircher found the number of multiset permutations when one element can be repeated. Jean Prestet published a general rule for multiset permutations in 1675. John Wallis explained this rule in more detail in 1685. Multisets appeared explicitly in the work of Richard Dedekind. Other mathematicians formalized multisets and began to study them as precise mathematical structures in the 20th century. For example, Whitney (1933) described generalized sets (\\"sets\\" whose characteristic functions may take any integer value - positive, negative or zero). Monro (1987) investigated the category Mul of multisets and their morphisms, defining a multiset as a set with an equivalence relation between elements \\"of the same sort\\", and a morphism between multisets as a function which respects sorts. He also introduced a multinumber: a function f(x) from a multiset to the natural numbers, giving the multiplicity of element x in the multiset. Monro argued that the concepts of multiset and multinumber are often mixed indiscriminately, though both are useful. ==Examples== One of the simplest and most natural examples is the multiset of prime factors of a number . Here the underlying set of elements is the set of prime divisors of . For example, the number 120 has the prime factorization :120 = 2^3 3^1 5^1 which gives the multiset . A related example is the multiset of solutions of an algebraic equation. A quadratic equation, for example, has two solutions. However, in some cases they are both the same number. Thus the multiset of solutions of the equation could be , or it could be . In the latter case it has a solution of multiplicity 2. More generally, the fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that the complex solutions of a polynomial equation of degree always form a multiset of cardinality . A special case of the above are the eigenvalues of a matrix, whose multiplicity is usually defined as their multiplicity as roots of the characteristic polynomial. However two other multiplicities are naturally defined for eigenvalues, their multiplicities as roots of the minimal polynomial, and the geometric multiplicity, which is defined as the dimension of the kernel of (where is an eigenvalue of the matrix ). These three multiplicities define three multisets of eigenvalues, which may be all different: Let be a matrix in Jordan normal form that has a single eigenvalue. Its multiplicity is , its multiplicity as a root of the minimal polynomial is the size of the largest Jordan block, and its geometric multiplicity is the number of Jordan blocks. ==Definition== A multiset may be formally defined as a 2-tuple where is the underlying set of the multiset, formed from its distinct elements, and m\\\\colon A \\\\to \\\\mathbb{N}_{\\\\geq 1} is a function from to the set of the positive integers, giving the multiplicity, that is, the number of occurrences, of the element in the multiset as the number . Representing the function by its graph, that is the set of ordered pairs \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left(a, m\\\\left(a\\\\right)\\\\right) : a \\\\in A\\\\right\\\\\\\\}, allows for writing the multiset as , and the multiset as . This notation is however not commonly used and more compact notations are employed. If A=\\\\\\\\{a_1, \\\\ldots, a_n\\\\\\\\} is a finite set, the multiset is often represented as :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{a_1^{m(a_1)}, \\\\ldots,a_n^{m(a_n)} \\\\right\\\\\\\\},\\\\quad sometimes simplified to \\\\quad a_1^{m(a_1)} \\\\cdots a_n^{m(a_n)}, where upper indices equal to 1 are omitted. For example, the multiset may be written \\\\\\\\{a^2,b\\\\\\\\} or a^2b. If the elements of the multiset are numbers, a confusion is possible with ordinary arithmetic operations, those normally can be excluded from the context. On the other hand, the latter notation is coherent with the fact that the prime factorization of a positive integer is a uniquely defined multiset, as asserted by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Also, a monomial is a multiset of indeterminates. A multiset corresponds to an ordinary set if the multiplicity of every element is one (as opposed to some larger natural number). An indexed family, , where varies over some index-set I, may define a multiset, sometimes written . In this view the underlying set of the multiset is given by the image of the family, and the multiplicity of any element is the number of index values such that a_i = x. In this article the multiplicities are considered to be finite, i.e. no element occurs infinitely many times in the family: even in an infinite multiset, the multiplicities are finite numbers. It is possible to extend the definition of a multiset by allowing multiplicities of individual elements to be infinite cardinals instead of natural numbers, but not all properties carry over to this generalization. ==Basic properties and operations== Elements of a multiset are generally taken in a fixed set , sometimes called a universe, which is typically the set of natural numbers. An element of that does not belong to a given multiset is said to have a multiplicity 0 in this multiset. This extends the multiplicity function of the multiset to a function from to the set \\\\N of nonnegative integers. This defines a one to one correspondence between these functions and the multisets that have their elements in . This extended multiplicity function is commonly called simply the multiplicity function, and suffices for defining multisets, when the universe containing the elements has been fixed. This multiplicity function is a generalization of the indicator function of a subset, and shares some properties with it. The support of a multiset A in a universe is the underlying set of the multiset. Using the multiplicity function m, it is characterized as :\\\\operatorname{Supp}(A) := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{x \\\\in U \\\\mid m_{A}(x) > 0 \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. A multiset is finite if its support is finite, or, equivalently, if its cardinality :A = \\\\sum_{x\\\\in \\\\operatorname{Supp}(A)}m_A(x)= \\\\sum_{x\\\\in U}m_A(x) is finite. The empty multiset is the unique multiset with an empty support (underlying set), and thus a cardinality 0. The usual operations of sets may be extended to multisets by using the multiplicity function, in a similar way as using the indicator function for subsets. In the following, and are multisets in a given universe , with multiplicity functions m_A and m_B. *Inclusion: is included in , denoted , if ::\\\\forall x\\\\in U, m_A(x) \\\\le m_B(x). *Intersection: the intersection (called, in some contexts, the infimum or greatest common divisor) of and is the multiset with multiplicity function ::m_C(x) = \\\\min(m_A(x),m_B(x))\\\\quad\\\\forall x\\\\in U. *Union: the union (called, in some contexts, the maximum or lowest common multiple) of and is the multiset with multiplicity function ::m_C(x) = \\\\max(m_A(x),m_B(x))\\\\quad\\\\forall x\\\\in U. *Sum: the sum of multisets may be viewed as a generalization of the disjoint union of sets, and is defined by ::m_C(x) = m_A(x) + m_B(x)\\\\quad\\\\forall x\\\\in U. :The sum defines a commutative monoid structure on the finite multisets in a given universe. This monoid is a free commutative monoid, with the universe as a basis. Two multisets are disjoint if their supports are disjoint sets. This is equivalent to saying that their intersection is the empty multiset or that their sum equals their union. There is an Inclusion‚Äìexclusion principle for finite multisets (similar to the one for sets), stating that a finite union of finite multisets is the difference of two sums of multisets: in the first sum we consider all possible intersections of an odd number of the given multisets, while in the second sum we consider all possible intersections of an even number of the given multisets. == Counting multisets == Bijection between 3-subsets of a 7-set (left) and 3-multisets with elements from a 5-set (right) So this illustrates that \\\\textstyle {7 \\\\choose 3} = \\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{5 \\\\choose 3}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right). The number of multisets of cardinality , with elements taken from a finite set of cardinality , is called the multiset coefficient or multiset number. This number is written by some authors as \\\\textstyle\\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n\\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right), a notation that is meant to resemble that of binomial coefficients; it is used for instance in (Stanley, 1997), and could be pronounced \\" multichoose \\" to resemble \\" choose \\" for \\\\tbinom nk. Unlike for binomial coefficients, there is no \\"multiset theorem\\" in which multiset coefficients would occur, and they should not be confused with the unrelated multinomial coefficients that occur in the multinomial theorem. The value of multiset coefficients can be given explicitly as :\\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n\\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) = {n+k-1 \\\\choose k} = \\\\frac{(n+k-1)!}{k!\\\\,(n-1)!} = {n(n+1)(n+2)\\\\cdots(n+k-1)\\\\over k!}, where the second expression is as a binomial coefficient; many authors in fact avoid separate notation and just write binomial coefficients. So, the number of such multisets is the same as the number of subsets of cardinality in a set of cardinality . The analogy with binomial coefficients can be stressed by writing the numerator in the above expression as a rising factorial power :\\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n\\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) = {n^{\\\\overline{k}}\\\\over k!}, to match the expression of binomial coefficients using a falling factorial power: :{n\\\\choose k} = {n^{\\\\underline{k}}\\\\over k!}. There are for example 4 multisets of cardinality 3 with elements taken from the set of cardinality 2 (, ), namely , , , . There are also 4 subsets of cardinality 3 in the set of cardinality 4 (), namely , , , . One simple way to prove the equality of multiset coefficients and binomial coefficients given above, involves representing multisets in the following way. First, consider the notation for multisets that would represent (6 s, 2 s, 3 s, 7 s) in this form: : This is a multiset of cardinality = 18 made of elements of a set of cardinality = 4. The number of characters including both dots and vertical lines used in this notation is 18 + 4 ‚àí 1\\\\. The number of vertical lines is 4 ‚àí 1\\\\. The number of multisets of cardinality 18 is then the number of ways to arrange the 4 ‚àí 1 vertical lines among the 18 + 4 ‚àí 1 characters, and is thus the number of subsets of cardinality 4 ‚àí 1 in a set of cardinality 18 + 4 ‚àí 1\\\\. Equivalently, it is the number of ways to arrange the 18 dots among the 18 + 4 ‚àí 1 characters, which is the number of subsets of cardinality 18 of a set of cardinality 18 + 4 ‚àí 1\\\\. This is :{4+18-1 \\\\choose 4-1}={4+18-1 \\\\choose 18} = 1330, thus is the value of the multiset coefficient and its equivalencies: :\\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{4\\\\choose18}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right)={21\\\\choose18}=\\\\frac{21!}{18!\\\\,3!}={21\\\\choose3}=\\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{19\\\\choose3}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right), : ::=\\\\frac{{\\\\color{red}{\\\\mathfrak{ 4\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot6\\\\cdot7\\\\cdot8\\\\cdot9\\\\cdot10\\\\cdot11\\\\cdot12\\\\cdot13\\\\cdot14\\\\cdot15\\\\cdot16\\\\cdot17\\\\cdot18}}} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{19\\\\cdot20\\\\cdot21}}{\\\\mathbf{1\\\\cdot2\\\\cdot3} \\\\cdot {\\\\color{red}{\\\\mathfrak{ 4\\\\cdot5\\\\cdot6\\\\cdot7\\\\cdot8\\\\cdot9\\\\cdot10\\\\cdot11\\\\cdot12\\\\cdot13\\\\cdot14\\\\cdot15\\\\cdot16\\\\cdot17\\\\cdot18}}}}, : ::=\\\\frac{ 1\\\\cdot2\\\\cdot3\\\\cdot4\\\\cdot5\\\\cdots16\\\\cdot17\\\\cdot18\\\\;\\\\mathbf{\\\\cdot\\\\;19\\\\cdot20\\\\cdot21}} {\\\\,1\\\\cdot2\\\\cdot3\\\\cdot4\\\\cdot5\\\\cdots 16\\\\cdot17\\\\cdot18\\\\,\\\\times\\\\,\\\\mathbf{1\\\\cdot2\\\\cdot3\\\\quad}}, : ::=\\\\frac{19\\\\cdot20\\\\cdot21}{1\\\\cdot2\\\\cdot3}. One may define a generalized binomial coefficient :{n \\\\choose k}={n(n-1)(n-2)\\\\cdots(n-k+1) \\\\over k!} in which is not required to be a nonnegative integer, but may be negative or a non-integer, or a non-real complex number. (If = 0, then the value of this coefficient is 1 because it is the empty product.) Then the number of multisets of cardinality in a set of cardinality is :\\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n\\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right)=(-1)^k{-n \\\\choose k}. === Recurrence relation === A recurrence relation for multiset coefficients may be given as :\\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n\\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n\\\\choose k - 1}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) + \\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n-1\\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) \\\\quad \\\\mbox{for } n,k>0 with :\\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n \\\\choose 0}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) = 1,\\\\quad n\\\\in\\\\N, \\\\quad\\\\mbox{and}\\\\quad \\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{0 \\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) = 0,\\\\quad k>0. The above recurrence may be interpreted as follows. Let := \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\cdots,n\\\\\\\\} be the source set. There is always exactly one (empty) multiset of size 0, and if = 0 there are no larger multisets, which gives the initial conditions. Now, consider the case in which > 0\\\\. A multiset of cardinality with elements from might or might not contain any instance of the final element . If it does appear, then by removing once, one is left with a multiset of cardinality ‚àí 1 of elements from , and every such multiset can arise, which gives a total of :\\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n\\\\choose k - 1}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) possibilities. If does not appear, then our original multiset is equal to a multiset of cardinality with elements from , of which there are :\\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n-1\\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right). Thus, :\\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n\\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n\\\\choose k - 1}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) + \\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n-1\\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right). ===Generating series=== The generating function of the multiset coefficients is very simple, being :\\\\sum_{d=0}^\\\\infty \\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n\\\\choose d}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right)t^d=\\\\frac{1}{(1-t)^n}. As multisets are in one to one correspondence with monomials, \\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n\\\\choose d}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) is also the number of monomials of degree in indeterminates. Thus, above series is also the Hilbert series of the polynomial ring k[x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n]. As \\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{n\\\\choose d}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) is a polynomial in , it is defined for any complex value of . === Generalization and connection to the negative binomial series === The multiplicative formula allows the definition of multiset coefficients to be extended by replacing n by an arbitrary number Œ± (negative, real, complex): :\\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{\\\\alpha\\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha^{\\\\overline k}}{k!} = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha(\\\\alpha+1)(\\\\alpha+2)\\\\cdots(\\\\alpha+k-1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\\\\cdots 1} \\\\quad\\\\text{for } k\\\\in\\\\N \\\\text{ and arbitrary } \\\\alpha. With this definition one has a generalization of the negative binomial formula (with one of the variables set to 1), which justifies calling the \\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{\\\\alpha\\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) negative binomial coefficients: : (1-X)^{-\\\\alpha} = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\left(\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{\\\\alpha\\\\choose k}\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\right) X^k. This Taylor series formula is valid for all complex numbers Œ± and X with < 1\\\\. It can also be interpreted as an identity of formal power series in X, where it actually can serve as definition of arbitrary powers of series with constant coefficient equal to 1; the point is that with this definition all identities hold that one expects for exponentiation, notably :(1-X)^{-\\\\alpha}(1-X)^{-\\\\beta}=(1-X)^{-(\\\\alpha+\\\\beta)} \\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad ((1-X)^{-\\\\alpha})^{-\\\\beta}=(1-X)^{-(-\\\\alpha\\\\beta)}, and formulas such as these can be used to prove identities for the multiset coefficients. If Œ± is a nonpositive integer n, then all terms with k > ‚àín are zero, and the infinite series becomes a finite sum. However, for other values of Œ±, including positive integers and rational numbers, the series is infinite. ==Applications== Multisets have various applications. They are becoming fundamental in combinatorics. Multisets have become an important tool in the theory of relational databases, which often uses the synonym bag. For instance, multisets are often used to implement relations in database systems. In particular, a table (without a primary key) works as a multiset, because it can have multiple identical records. Similarly, SQL operates on multisets and return identical records. For instance, consider \\"SELECT name from Student\\". In the case that there are multiple records with name \\"sara\\" in the student table, all of them are shown. That means the result set of SQL is a multiset. If it was a set, the repetitive records in the result set were eliminated. Another application of multiset is in modeling multigraphs. In multigraphs there can be multiple edges between any two given vertices. As such, the entity that shows edges is a multiset, and not a set. There are also other applications. For instance, Richard Rado used multisets as a device to investigate the properties of families of sets. He wrote, \\"The notion of a set takes no account of multiple occurrence of any one of its members, and yet it is just this kind of information which is frequently of importance. We need only think of the set of roots of a polynomial f(x) or the spectrum of a linear operator.\\" ==Generalizations== Different generalizations of multisets have been introduced, studied and applied to solving problems. * Real-valued multisets (in which multiplicity of an element can be any real number) :This seems straightforward, as many definitions for fuzzy sets and multisets are very similar and can be taken over for real-valued multisets by just replacing the value range of the characteristic function ([0, 1] or ‚Ñï0 = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} respectively) by ‚Ñù0+ = [0, ‚àû[. However, this approach cannot be easily extended for generalized fuzzy sets which use a poset or lattice instead of a simple degree of membership. Several other approaches for fuzzy multisets have been developed that don't have this restriction. * Fuzzy multisets * Rough multisets * Hybrid sets * Multisets whose multiplicity is any real-valued step function * Soft multisets * Soft fuzzy multisets * Named sets (unification of all generalizations of sets) == See also == * Frequency (statistics) as multiplicity analog * Quasi-sets * Set theory * 20px Partitions of multisets ==References== Category:Basic concepts in set theory Category:Factorial and binomial topics ","title":"Multiset"},{"id":"305306","text":"The American Wrestling Association (AWA) was an American professional wrestling promotion based in Minneapolis that ran from 1960 to 1991. It was owned and founded by Verne Gagne and Wally Karbo. The territory was originally part of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), becoming an independent territory in 1960. ==History== ===Early years=== Anton Stecher was a founding member of the NWA in 1948 and had promoted wrestling in Minneapolis since 1933 through his Minneapolis Boxing and Wrestling Club. In 1952, he sold a one third interest in the promotion to his son Dennis and Wally Karbo. Stecher died on October 9, 1954, and control of the promotion passed to Karbo and Dennis. Verne Gagne, an amateur wrestling champion, had become a well known and popular wrestler nationally in the 1950s as a result of his appearances on the DuMont Network. He aspired to become NWA World Champion, but political sentiment within the NWA prevented it. In 1959, Dennis sold his majority stake in the Minneapolis Boxing and Wrestling Club to Karbo and Gagne. They then became co-owners of the promotion. ===Breaking from the NWA=== In 1960, after unsuccessfully lobbying the NWA for a title match between Gagne and the NWA World Champion Pat O'Connor, Gagne and Karbo led certain territories out of the NWA forming the AWA. The AWA unilaterally recognized NWA World Champion Pat O'Connor as AWA World Champion and gave him 90 days to defend the AWA title against Gagne. The NWA ignored the challenge. O'Connor was stripped of the AWA title and it was awarded to Gagne on August 16, 1960. While O'Connor was considered the first AWA Champion, he didn't wrestle in the AWA until later in the 1960s (when he teamed with Wilbur Snyder to win the AWA World Tag Team Championship). Gagne was an amateur wrestling champion who had earned a spot on the U.S. team at the 1948 Summer Olympics; he ran the AWA with a progressive sensibility, firmly believing that sound technical wrestling should be the basis of a pro-wrestling company.Pile-driving, gut-busting, back-breaking theater - Minnesota Daily Starting in the 1970s, Gagne trained his newcomer wrestlers from his farm in Chanhassen, Minnesota.PWTorch - WWE News and Pro Wrestling Coverage Since 1987 ===Expanding the territory=== Under Gagne and Karbo, the AWA became one of the most successful and expansive single territories in North America, promoting shows in such major cities as Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago, Omaha, Winnipeg, Denver, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Phoenix and throughout the Midwest region. Relationships were also developed with existing promotions in Houston, Memphis and San Antonio. Gagne's westward expansion into traditional NWA territories was made possible due to relationships and business partnerships he had forged for decades‚Äîmore the result of other promoters struggling to survive rather than by purchase or hostile takeover by Gagne. ===Nick Bockwinkel vs. Hulk Hogan=== After Gagne's retirement in 1981, he focused the promotion on Nick Bockwinkel, a loyal employee of several years who was a mat-wrestling technician like Gagne had been. Bockwinkel faced numerous challengers for the title during the early 1980s including eventual champions Rick Martel and Otto Wanz, champion Mad Dog Vachon, and perennial contenders Wahoo McDaniel, and Brad Rheingans, but perhaps his most famous opponent would be Hulk Hogan. Starting in 1982 and accelerated by a role in the hit film Rocky III, Hogan rapidly caught on as a babyface with AWA fans, and became the AWA's top draw. But even as his popularity grew to unprecedented levels, Gagne refused to make him the AWA World Heavyweight Champion, as Hogan was a powerhouse wrestler. He recognized Hogan's showmanship and charisma and was well aware of his potential drawing power, but still believed a wrestling company should be built around one of its best technical wrestlers (e.g., himself and Bockwinkel). On the Spectacular Legacy of the AWA DVD, Gagne denied bias against Hogan and defended his actions by reasoning that he believed that Hogan's pursuit of the title was the draw for the audience and that \\"we really didn't need him to be champion\\". On two occasions, Gagne went so far as to tease AWA title wins for Hogan, only to return the title to Bockwinkel via technicalities. The first was on April 18, 1982. Hogan defeated Bockwinkel with the help of a foreign object that Bockwinkel's manager Bobby \\"the Brain\\" Heenan had interjected into the match. After the three count, the belt was awarded to Hogan and he was announced as the new champion. Heenan informed the referee of the object and the ref questioned Hogan about this, but the blood on Hogan's face was evidence that the object had also been used on him. The ref stood by his decision and Hogan left the arena as the new AWA World champion. Six days later on AWA television, AWA President Stanley Blackburn stripped Hogan of the title and returned it to Bockwinkel. The second such occasion was on a \\"Super Sunday\\" card in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1983. Hogan again pinned Bockwinkel, was awarded the belt and announced as the new champion. This time, Blackburn came to the ring moments after the match and tried to have Hogan retroactively disqualified for throwing the champion over the top rope a few minutes before the pinfall occurred. However, this match had been booked as a no disqualification match, which prevented this, so Blackburn simply stripped Hogan of the title and once again handed it back to Bockwinkel. The crowd (which had exploded in cheers when Hogan appeared to have won) almost rioted when learning that Hogan was once again cheated out of the title,Best of the 80's. Kayfabememories.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-05. and Bockwinkel later had to do damage control with the rabid crowd, telling the audience to calm down afterwards as well. Hogan attacked Bockwinkel and his manager Heenan. On the DVD The Spectacular Legacy of the AWA, it was revealed that Gagne planned to have Hogan win the belt that night, but only if he would give Gagne the bulk of the revenues that Hogan was earning from merchandise and his periodic main- event performances in New Japan Pro Wrestling.Wrestling - Shining a Spotlight 12.01.06: The Rise, Fall and Legacy of the AWA. 411mania.com. Retrieved on 2013-09-05. Outraged at being strongarmed, Hogan refused, but nonetheless offered a 50/50 split instead. Gagne refused, and kept the belt from him. However, Hogan did admit in his autobiography My Life Outside the Ring that he still intended to stay with AWA and that Gagne had planned to book him in steel cage matches with Bockwinkel in an effort to expand the AWA to the New York market, but he decided to leave when Vincent K. McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) offered him the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. ===Talent jumps to the WWF=== As McMahon and his Connecticut-based WWF attempted to end pro wrestling's regional era in the mid-1980s (by establishing the WWF as a national promotion), Gagne made several decisions that caused his AWA to lose momentum in the emerging wrestling promotion war, including overemphasizing his son Greg Gagne in AWA storylines (which led to charges of nepotism within the company) and failing to make Hogan the top star of his company when he had the chance. Frustrated by Gagne's business decisions, Hogan accepted an offer from rival promoter McMahon to wrestle for the WWF, in December 1983. One month later, Hogan became the WWF World Heavyweight Champion. He and the WWF soon became a mainstream media phenomenon and virtually synonymous with professional wrestling in much of the national consciousness, vaulting past the AWA and NWA as the premier promotion in wrestling. Hogan wasn't alone in leaving the AWA. Some of the AWA's other top talent, including announcer \\"Mean Gene\\" Okerlund, manager Heenan, and wrestlers Adrian Adonis, Ken Patera, Jim Brunzell, David Schultz, Wendi Richter and Jesse Ventura also jumped to the WWF. As the AWA required talent to place a six-week notice upon leaving the company for booking and syndication-based reasons, most of the talent reportedly told Gagne that McMahon offered them more money to not work out their notices and previously- scheduled appearance dates, which has been disputed by McMahon today. Of the talent to leave AWA for the WWF in this time, only Heenan worked out his notice in good faith to the Gagne family.The Spectacular Legacy of the AWA DVD The sting of the WWF expansion was not shouldered by the AWA alone. The Mid- Atlantic, Georgia, and Florida territories of the NWA also lost top stars such as \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper, Greg \\"The Hammer\\" Valentine, Jack Brisco, Jerry Brisco, Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat, \\"Cowboy\\" Bob Orton, Barry Windham, and Mike Rotunda to the WWF during that same time. ===Pro Wrestling USA (1984‚Äì1986)=== Despite this talent raid, the AWA went on to have another successful year in 1984, mainly because of the arrival of The Road Warriors and an angle uniting longtime heel Jerry Blackwell with Greg and feuding with former manager Sheik Adnan El-Kaissey. Although aging, most of the AWA's longtime core talent still remained. Stars like Bockwinkel, Ray \\"The Crippler\\" Stevens, The Crusher, Dick the Bruiser, Baron von Raschke, Mad Dog Vachon, and Larry Hennig were all still active at this time despite all being in their 40s or 50s. In response to McMahon's expansion, the AWA forged an alliance with several NWA promoters, including Jim Crockett Promotions, Mid-South Wrestling, Pacific Northwest Wrestling, World Class Championship Wrestling, and the Continental Wrestling Association. This new promotion was known as Pro Wrestling USA and came about in an attempt to establish a national presence to compete against the WWF. The AWA was also able to sign top wrestlers like Sgt. Slaughter and Bob Backlund. By 1985, however, the AWA began to lose audiences, as the WWF was gaining wrestling superiority due to the success of WrestleMania I. Later in the year, as this struggle against the WWF progressed, Karbo also sold all his stock to Gagne as well. In September 1985, Pro Wrestling USA would respond to McMahon's rising success by promoting the first SuperClash. Despite this success, the Pro Wrestling USA collaboration did not last, as Gagne accused David Crockett of trying to sign away AWA talent over to the NWA backstage at numerous Pro Wrestling USA shows. The AWA released an AWA Remco Action Figure line with the toy company Remco and a series of 30 minute videos entitled \\"Wrestling Classics\\", primarily featuring wrestlers such as Sgt. Slaughter, the Road Warriors, Jimmy Garvin and Steve Regal, and World Champion Martel. ===Decline (1986‚Äì1990)=== Despite falling behind the WWF and NWA as a major promotion throughout 1986 and 1987, Gagne still managed to find and/or develop legitimate young talent like Scott Hall (later known as Razor Ramon), The Midnight Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty), \\"Bull Power\\" Leon White (later known as Big Van Vader), The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags), and Madusa Miceli during that timeframe. With the retirement of Bockwinkel, Gagne tapped Curt Hennig as his next champion and future of the company. Hennig, a talented and popular second generation wrestler, defeated Bockwinkel at Super Clash 2. The overall card was relatively weak, but the title match was a critical success, although the title change was not without controversy, involving Larry Zbyszko and a roll of dimes. After further review by on-air AWA President Blackburn, and following weeks of speculation by AWA fans, the decision was upheld and Hennig was the new champion. Gagne pushed Hennig and The Midnight Rockers throughout 1987 and into 1988, but the WWF came calling and all three of his top stars would soon be gone. During 1987, in an attempt to remain relevant and survive, Gagne renewed a relationship with Memphis-based promoter Jerry Jarrett and the CWA and even allowed Mid-Southern territory legend Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler to win the AWA World Title from Hennig in May 1988. This was after the AWA flirted for months with the idea of giving Greg the belt, even awarding the belt to Gagne at a couple of house shows, only to return it to Hennig on a technicality. It was widely speculated that the idea of the younger Gagne as heavyweight champion did not play well with AWA fans, who seemed more interested in the involvement of Verne and Larry Hennig in the feud than they did with Greg actually winning the title, so Verne decided to go with Lawler instead. Michaels and Jannetty would drop the titles to Badd Company around that same time. Facing financial trouble of their own, WCCW then allied themselves with the AWA and CWA, and Lawler would challenge WCCW Heavyweight champion Kerry Von Erich to a title unification match at SuperClash III in December. Super Clash III was the AWA's first venture into the Pay-Per-View market and wrestling's first collaborative PPV between several promotions. However, after months of hype, the end results were somewhat contentious and relatively unsuccessful. Following the event, the collaborative effort was over and Lawler was stripped of the title in January 1989. Lawler kept the AWA Title belt and continued promoting himself in Tennessee, Texas, and on the independent circuit as the unified World Heavyweight Champion. Lawler did this in an attempt to leverage PPV revenue from Gagne that was allegedly owed to him, but Gagne never paid him and eventually commissioned a new title belt of similar design. In February 1989, Larry Zbyszko, a one-time employee and Verne's son-in-law, returned to the AWA and won the vacated World Title in an 18-man Battle Royal, eliminating Tom Zenk to end the match. It was also during this time that Joe Blanchard replaced Blackburn as AWA President. Zbyszko's first title reign would last for a little over one year. During this time, he would defend the title against Zenk, Greg, Wahoo McDaniel, Ken Patera, Nikita Koloff, Brad Rheingans, The Trooper Del Wilkes, and Masa Saito. Zbyszko would eventually lose the title to Saito in February 1990 in front of 65,000 fans at the Tokyo Dome at the NJPW/AJPW Supershow. Zbyszko would regain the title in May 1990 at SuperClash IV. During 1989 and 1990, the AWA also pushed Mike Enos and Wayne Bloom as the top tag team. In early 1989, Eric Bischoff, who was performing office work for the AWA at the time, mostly in sales and syndication, was placed in front of the camera to replace Larry Nelson as interviewer and occasional commentator. The AWA was Bischoff's first exposure to the world of pro wrestling. He would later become a dominant force in the industry, leading World Championship Wrestling to prominence in the 1990s. The AWA would become inactive in the fall of 1990 (the last television taping occurred on August 11). As a result, Zbyszko signed with WCW. As his last official act, Gagne stripped the already-departed Zbyszko of the AWA World Title in December 1990. In 1991, Gagne and his inactive promotion officially filed for bankruptcy. Gagne did promote two cards in Minnesota in May 1991, featuring the return of Greg Gagne and Wahoo McDaniel and other stars such as Baron von Raschke, Buck Zumhofe, and The Destruction Crew (Mike Enos & Wayne Bloom), but he was unable to revive the promotion. Despite this, the AWA continued re-running matches in their weekly ESPN time slot, and on their syndicated All-Star Wrestling show. The company also managed to release a commercial tape (Hulk Hogan's Highlights) during 1991. On the Spectacular Legacy of the AWA DVD, Bischoff revealed that one of the main reasons the AWA shut down was that Gagne was leveraging money against a valuable property he owned along Lake Minnetonka. Local officials wanted to turn the property into a park. Gagne fought the decision for several years, but eventually lost the eminent domain case, leading to the creation of Lake Minnetonka Regional Park. As a result, he lost the financial resource he was using to keep the AWA up and running and had no choice but to shut down the promotion. In an interview during the late 1990s with Minneapolis television station KARE, Gagne spoke of the devoted fan base in Minnesota and joked about how he may promote again some day, but nothing ever materialized. ==International working agreements== Abroad, the AWA had working agreements with Japanese promotions International Pro Wrestling (1969 to 1980), then All Japan Pro Wrestling (1980 to 1988, although the relationship was strained in 1986 by the AWA Title debacle surrounding Stan Hansen), and, near the end, New Japan Pro Wrestling. On June 29, 1986, in Denver, Colorado, Hansen refused to lose the AWA World Title to Bockwinkel prior to a tour of Japan and left with the championship belt. Hansen argued that he was booked as AWA Champion in Japan and was therefore fulfilling his commitment. Gagne disagreed and awarded the AWA Championship to Bockwinkel, using one of the tag team title belts on a temporary basis. Gagne threatened legal action if Hansen continued to keep the belt and it was returned to the AWA as a result (although according to Bockwinkel on The Spectacular Legacy of the AWA, Hansen had run over the belt with his truck before returning it). The AWA also had a brief relationship with the European promotion Catch Wrestling Association, through which its promoter, wrestler Otto Wanz, was given a brief AWA World Title reign in 1982. ==Supercards== ===SuperSunday=== ===WrestleRock 86=== ===SuperClash=== ==Tournaments== ===AWA World Tag Championship Tournament (1962)=== The AWA World Tag Team Tournament was a one-night single elimination tag team tournament held in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on January 15, 1962, for the vacant AWA World Tag Team Championship. ===AWA World Tag Championship Tournament (1989)=== The AWA World Tag Team Tournament was a one-night single elimination tag team tournament held in Rochester, Minnesota, on October 1, 1989, for the vacant AWA World Tag Team Championship. ===Team Challenge Series=== The AWA held a \\"Team Challenge Series\\" from October 1, 1989, through August 11, 1990. All of the available wrestlers were divided into three teams: \\"Larry's Legends\\", headed by Larry Zbyszko, \\"Sarge's Snipers\\", originally headed by Sgt. Slaughter, and \\"Baron's Blitzers\\", headed by Baron von Raschke. Slaughter left the AWA to return to the World Wrestling Federation shortly after WrestleMania VI, and Colonel DeBeers took over as the team captain for the Snipers (the team name was changed to \\"DeBeers' Diamondcutters\\" and Slaughter was said on air to have \\"gone AWOL\\" to explain his departure). Babyfaces and heels alike were assigned to teams, forcing bitter rivals to work together, and due to main talent losses many of the participants were jobbers, such as Jake Milliman, Tom Stone, etc. The winners of Team Challenge matches would earn points for their team; at some unspecified point the highest scoring team would share one million dollars, within the story line. Some of the earlier TCS matches took place in a TV studio without an audience; the announcers claimed it was part of an effort to stop wrestlers from interfering, but it was actually due to poor ticket sales for arena shows. The remainder of the matches took place at the Rochester Civic Center, where the AWA taped live matches for its television program from 1989-1990. The final match in the TCS was a Royal Rumble-style battle royal featuring Brad Rheingans, The Destruction Crew, Colonel DeBeers, the Texas Hangmen, the Trooper Del Wilkes, and several others. Jake Milliman again came away with the win by eliminating DeBeers at the end, winning the series and the supposed one-million-dollar check for Larry's Legends. An unsold pilot for a weekly syndicated \\"Team Challenge Series\\" television show was taped in 1989 with hosts Ralph Strangis and Greg Gagne at \\"Satellite Base\\" calling matches recorded in an empty TV studio with no ring announcer. All wrestler entrances were done in front of a green screen with footage of fans at sports bars who were supposedly watching the matches live inserted on the screen using Chroma-Key. The pilot can be viewed in the \\"WWE Hidden Gems\\" section of the \\"Vault\\" menu on WWE Network. ==Television== Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, AWA television production was headquartered at Minneapolis independent station WTCN-TV, then owned by Metromedia. The ring announcer was longtime Minneapolis - Saint Paul sports broadcaster Marty O'Neill, who also conducted the post-match interviews. O'Neill announced the matches for the local WTCN audience. But fans watching the syndicated version of the show heard commentary provided by Rodger Kent. In the mid-1970s, during a prolonged illness, O'Neill was occasionally replaced as ring announcer by program producer Al DeRusha and interviews were conducted by both Kent and Gene Okerlund. By 1979, Okerlund had permanently replaced O'Neill, who died a couple of years later, and production was transferred to Minneapolis station KMSP-TV. During the AWA's existence, it produced or had a hand in production of several TV programs: * AWA All-Star Wrestling, the promotion's syndicated program, which aired from 1960 until 1991. * AWA Championship Wrestling, which aired on cable sports network ESPN from 1985 to 1990 and ScreenSport in Europe via Cable or Satellite TV; it was a continuation of the earlier ESPN program Pro Wrestling USA, the co-operative venture between the AWA and several NWA affiliates (most notably Jim Crockett Promotions). * AWA Major League Wrestling, a Canadian program produced in Winnipeg, Manitoba, for that city's station, CKND, and syndicated across Canada during the 1980s. In 1985, Gagne began airing weekly programming on ESPN, hoping to help the promotion compete with the national exposure already enjoyed by the WWF (on USA Network) and the NWA's Georgia/World Championship Wrestling (although much less successful than the WWF at the time) (on TBS). However, weekly AWA shows were not treated with any priority by the cable network, sometimes being delayed, preempted by live programming, or suffering from occasional changes in time slot, making it difficult for fans to tune in on a regular basis. On February 26, 2008, ESPN Classic began reairing AWA Championship Wrestling episodes, circa 1986-1990. ==Pay-per-view== The AWA ran only one pay-per-view card, SuperClash III, during its 30-year run. However, From 1999 to 2002, a series of AWA-related pay-per-views were produced. Titled AWA Classic Wrestling, they featured compilations of old AWA footage, hosted by Greg Gagne and Todd Okerlund (son of Gene Okerlund), with occasional appearances by Verne Gagne. The pay-per- views ceased following the acquisition of the AWA tape library by World Wrestling Entertainment. ===World Wrestling Entertainment ownership=== All footage of the AWA is owned by WWE. WWE released The Spectacular Legacy of the AWA on November 21, 2006. The DVD includes a documentary on the amateur and professional career of Verne Gagne, the rise and fall of the AWA over its 30-year history, along with numerous interviews and features with Gagne, Hulk Hogan, Jim Brunzell, Michael Hayes, Baron von Raschke, Greg Gagne, Eric Bischoff, Bobby Heenan, Gene Okerlund and Nick Bockwinkel. In 1996, Dale Gagner, a former AWA employee but no relation to Verne despite the similar surname, removed the \\"r\\" from his name and formed an organization in Minnesota known as AWA Superstars of Wrestling, on the AWA name. In April 2007, WWE filed a lawsuit against Gagner, citing trademark infringement, as WWE owned all AWA properties due to their purchase after the AWA's closure. In a move to sidestep WWE, former AWA wrestler Jonnie Stewart trademarked the name \\"American Wrestling Alliance\\" but the United States Patent and Trademark Office later indicated that the request was abandoned in February 2008. In October 2008, the lawsuit against Gagner was settled. The court ruling prohibits Dale Gagner and his associate from certain use of the AWA name or any other derivatives. As a result, the organization was renamed to Wrestling Superstars Live. ==Championships== * NWA World Tag Team Championship (Minneapolis version) (pre-AWA) * AWA World Heavyweight Championship * AWA Midwest Heavyweight Championship * AWA World Light Heavyweight Championship * AWA United States Heavyweight Championship * World Heavyweight Championship (Omaha version) * AWA Southern Heavyweight Championship * AWA World Tag Team Championship * AWA World Women's Championship * AWA Brass Knuckles Championship * AWA America's Championship * AWA British Empire Heavyweight Championship * AWA International Television Championship * AWA/CWA International Heavyweight Championship * AWA/CWA International Tag Team Championship * AWA Midwest Tag Team Championship * AWA Southern Tag Team Championship ==Former personnel== ==See also== *List of independent wrestling promotions in the United States ==References== ==External links== * Wrestling- Titles.com * * Category:American professional wrestling promotions Category:Entertainment companies established in 1960 Category:Entertainment companies disestablished in 1991 Category:National Wrestling Alliance members Category:1960 establishments in Minnesota Category:1991 disestablishments in Minnesota ","title":"American Wrestling Association"},{"id":"305307","text":"Saga of the Greenlanders.

The saga also details the events that led to the banishment of Erik the Red (Eirik Raude) to Greenland and preaching of Christianity by Leif Erikson (Leiv Eiriksson) as well as his discovery of Vinland after his longship was blown off course. ==Synopsis== Chapter 1: The saga starts off by explaining the ancestry of Olaf the White and details events that happened regarding Olaf's wife, Aud the Deep-Minded and Olaf's son, Thorstein the Red. When Olaf dies in battle in Ireland, Thorstein and Aud left for the Hebrides where Thorstein marries and became a great warrior king who ruled more than half of Scotland. Upon Thorstein's death, Aud sails to Iceland where she then occupies much of the land.Thordarson, Sveinbjorn. \\"The Saga of Erik the Red.\\" The Saga of Erik the Red - Icelandic Saga Database.

In retaliation a friend of the farm owner, Eyjolf the Foul, killed the thralls. Because of this, Erik then killed Eyjolf the Foul. Eyjolf's kinsmen then demanded he be banished from that area (Haukadalr). Erik left to Oxney where he asked Thorgest to keep some of his mystical beams: Thorgest would not give them back, so Erik took them by force and ended up killing two of Thorgest's sons. Thorgest and Erik each acquired a following. Then at the Thorsnes Thing (√û√≥rsnes-Thing) in Sn√¶fellsnes, Erik and his people were outlawed from Iceland. Erik then sailed to Greenland where he named many places. Then, he came back to Iceland and reconciled with Thorgest. Then he decided to go back to Greenland and recruited people to come with him. He named the land Greenland because ‚Äúmen will desire much the more to go there if the land has a good name.‚ÄùThordarson, Sveinbjorn. \\"The Saga of Erik the Red.\\" The Saga of Erik the Red - Icelandic Saga Database.

Olaf suggested that Leif preach Christianity in Greenland and Leif agreed. On his way back to Norway, Leif was tossed about a long time at sea and accidentally discovered a land with wild wheat, large trees, vine trees, and maple trees. He then sailed back on course to Greenland where he converted many people to Christianity including his mother. Erik the Red did not convert, and his wife withheld intercourse with him because of this. Leif wanted to go back to this newly discovered land with his father, but Erik thought it was unlucky because he fell off his horse on the way to the ship.Thordarson, Sveinbjorn. \\"The Saga of Erik the Red.\\" The Saga of Erik the Red - Icelandic Saga Database.

He owned half a land which he shared with another man named Thorsteinn, who had a wife named Sigridr. A disease spread throughout the farm. Thorsteinn and Sigridr fell ill and died. But strangely, Thorsteinn came back from the dead and asked to talk to his wife. He announced his wish to be buried at the church and asked Gudrid to give all their goods to the church. Erik then watched after Gudrid, who started to live in his home.Anonyme, Saga d'Eirikr le Rouge, Paris, Gallimard, 1987. Chapter 7: Two ships of 40 Icelandic men went to Greenland and were wonderfully welcomed by Erik the Red. Karlsefni, one of these men, noticed that Erik was not as joyful as usual. Erik was in fact concerned about offering his guest a great J√≥l feast. Karlsefni told him that he could take whatever he wanted from their ships to prepare the feast. After J√≥l, Karlsefni asked for Gudrid's hand. Erik agreed to let Karlsefni marry her.Anonyme, Saga d'Eirikr le Rouge, Paris, Gallimard, 1987. == Comparisons to Greenland Saga == There are numerous parallels to the Saga of the Greenlanders, including recurring characters and recounts of the same expeditions, although with a few notable differences. The Saga of Erik the Red presents a number of the expeditions in the Greenland saga as just one expedition led by Thorfinnr Karlsefni and his wife Gu√∞r√≠√∞r. The expeditions that were combined into Thorfinnr's are those of Thorvaldr Eir√≠ksson and Freyd√≠s Eir√≠kssd√≥ttir.[14] Another notable difference is the location of their settlements. In the Greenland saga, Karlsefni and the others settle in a place that is only referred to as Vinland, while in Saga of Erik the Red, they form two base settlements: Straumfj«´r√∞r where they spend winter and the following spring, and Hop, where they later settle and run into problems with the natives, as depicted in the Greenland saga. Otherwise, the tales are largely similar, both with heavy focuses on the exploits of Thorfinnr Karlsefni and his wife Gu√∞r√≠√∞r. ==Translations into English== There have been numerous translations of the saga, some of the most prominent of which are: * Jones, Gwyn (trans.), 'Eirik the Red's Saga', in The Norse Atlantic Saga: Being the Norse Voyages of Discovery and Settlement to Iceland, Greenland, and North America, new edn (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986), pp. 207‚Äì35.

They are native to South America and look similar to, but are not closely related to rabbits. The viscacha looks much like a rabbit due to convergent evolution. The five extant species of viscacha are: *The plains viscacha (Lagostomus maximus), a resident of the pampas of Argentina, is easily differentiated from other viscachas by black and gray mustache-like facial markings. This species lives colonially in warrens of 10 to over 100. It is very vocal and emits alarm calls. The plains viscacha can strip grassland used to graze livestock; this has caused ranchers to consider the rodent a pest species. *Lagidium ahuacaense is a newly described species of mountain viscacha from the Ecuadorian Andes. *The northern viscacha (Lagidium peruanum) is native to the Peruvian Andes at elevations between the tree line and the snow line. It is dorsally gray or brown in color, with a bushy tail and long, furry ears. This species lives in large colonies separated into individual family units, like an apartment complex. It eats a wide range of plant matter, settling for almost anything it can find growing in the harsh, rocky environment. *The southern viscacha (Lagidium viscacia), also called mountain viscacha, is similar to the northern viscacha, but its pelage is more red in color.

Beyond the drawbridge and the castle wall is a garden with a fountain. The manor is a large tower in which each floor is \\"of a piece\\". On the first floor, one finds the bedroom of Evangelists where the King sleeps. Elsewhere there is a library. On the second floor is another bedroom with an altar for saying Mass. The whole is refined, thus witness some 62 tiles composing a literary totality that have been found during the construction of the railroad and which are now deposited at the Carnavalet Museum in Paris. It is remarkable that nothing is provided here to welcome the Queen, for whom Charles V bought the manor of Pleasure (Plaisance) in 1375. This manor, which gives its name to the commune of Neuilly-Plaisance, was held by his brother the Duke of Burgundy. The Duke of Anjou, another brother of the king, constructed another manor near Beauty, of which no trace remains. In 1378, Charles IV of Luxemburg, Holy Roman Emperor, came to Beauty for a diplomatic visit to his nephew Charles V to discuss the hostilities of the English, and the co-existence of two popes. He was concerned mainly with strengthening the alliance between the two monarchies, already ancient, the house of Luxemburg being of French descent. A manuscript at the National Library of France shows Charles V, king of France, welcoming the emperor Charles IV and his son Wenceslas IV, king of Bohemia. The emperor resided at the manor of Beauty from 12 to 16 January while Charles V remained at Vincennes, visiting Beauty each day: > \\"At Beauty the Emperor remained several days and the King would visit each > day and in secret parley at length\\" writes Christine of Pisan. The two men exchanged rings and luxurious presents, and on 16 January, Charles V reaccompanied his uncle to the manor of Pleasure. Charles V died at Beauty 16 September 1380, and the manor fell into ruin. It is not spoken of again until Charles VII made it a present to his mistress Agn√®s Sorel, Lady of Beauty. > \\"And the beauty which held the title of \\"the most beautiful of the world\\" > should be called \\"Demoiselle of Beauty\\": Thus the king had given her for her > lifetime the house of Beault√© lez Paris.\\" (Enguerrand of Monstrelet > 1390-1453) Agn√®s Sorel (1422-1450), daughter of a Picardy gentleman, Jean Soreau, entered the life of Charles VII in 1443. She was of the household of Isabelle of Lorraine, wife of King Ren√©. When Charles saw her for the first time, he fell madly in love, and had no rest until he brought her to his court to make her his mistress. In 1444, she became the first official favorite of a king of France. Showered with presents from Charles, she was also interested in affairs of state. She soon had a house train of the greatest celebrities of the kingdom, which provoked a real scandal at the court. > She had the most beautiful headboards, best tapestry, best linen and covers, > best dishes, ring goods and jewels, best cooks and best everything. -- > writes Chastelain (1405-1475). A contemporary painting shows her dressed in a richly embroidered dress trimmed with fur, with a low-cut neckline, a decolletage demonstrating that she was extremely beautiful. One can easily imagine, to the breadth of whole this luxury, the castle of Beauty-sur-Marne that the king gave her in 1448, making her thus the Lady of Beauty. It is most beautiful and pretty and better situated of all in the √éle de France. It is in this atmosphere that Charles VII asserted his authority. He called together John Bureau, Jacques Coeur and Etienne Chevalier, all confidants of the beautiful Agn√®s, and all interfering in public affairs, and spoke these words, attributed to Fran√ßois I as a reminder: > \\"Sweet Agn√®s, more honor you deserve / the cause being to recover France / > than what can be rendered inside a cloister of nuns or to a devoted hermit.\\" She died at the manor of Mesnil, in Normandy, while she had left to rejoin the king, in February 1450, three days after her delivery, most likely of complications of childbirth. However, it is also claimed that the dauphin, the future Louis XI, whose advances she repelled, poisoned her. She is buried at Loches, in Tourraine. Her tomb, initially situated in the church of Notre-Dame was desecrated during the revolution and her statue destroyed. Later, it has been transferred in the old home of the castle. A painting of 1610 shows again the tower of the castle, that Richelieu will raze in 1626. Category:Ch√¢teaux in Val-de-Marne ","title":"Beaut√©-sur-Marne"},{"id":"305315","text":"Narsarsuaq (lit. Great Plan;Facts and History of Narsarsuaq, Narsarsuad Tourist Information old spelling: Narssarssuaq) is a settlement in the Kujalleq municipality in southern Greenland. It had 123 inhabitants in 2020. There is a thriving tourism industry in and around Narsarsuaq, whose attractions include a great diversity of wildlife, gemstones, tours to glaciers, and an airfield museum. ==History== Narsarsuaq valley (Flower valley), seen from Mellemlandet Narsarsuaq is located within the Eastern Settlement of the Greenlandic Norse; the Brattahl√≠√∞ farm of Erik the Red established in 985 was located on the opposite bank of Tunulliarfik Fjord, where the modern settlement of Qassiarsuk is situated. In 1941 the United States built an air base at Narsarsuaq code-named Bluie West One (BW1). (Bluie was the Allied military code name for Greenland.) Thousands of planes used BW1 as a stepping stone on their way from the aircraft factories in North America to the battlegrounds of Europe. A 600-bed hospital was built in order to deal with casualties from the Normandy landings. After the end of the war, BW1 continued to be developed, and was a major hospital site during the Korean War, with the military hospital expanded to 1,000 beds. However, it was rendered surplus by the advent of mid-air refueling and the construction of the larger Thule Air Base in northern Greenland. In 1951, it was agreed that Denmark and the United States would jointly oversee the airbase. Although it closed in 1958, it was reopened the following year by the Danish government after the loss of the vessel Hans Hedtoft and all crew south off Cape Farewell. The hospital was destroyed by a fire in 1972, although the ruins remain. == Transport == Narsarsuaq Airport serves as the principal airfield in southwestern Greenland, with seasonal international flights from Iceland operated by Air Iceland, feeding the commuter flights from communities of southern Greenland operated by Air Greenland. Small planes crossing the Atlantic sometimes replicate the North Atlantic Ferry Route, stopping at Narsarsuaq Airport and other World War II airfields, including Goose Bay, Newfoundland in Canada and Reykjav√≠k in Iceland. Narsarsuaq has a sea port where passenger boats and cruise ships can moor.Narsarsuaq phot by S√∏ren M√∏ller It is located south of the terminal building, so bus transfers are arranged. A gravel road is maintained between Qassiarsuk and Narsarsuaq around the fjord.Road distance There is also a regular boat service to Qaqortoq. == Population == The population of the settlement is strictly tied to the traffic dynamics at the local airport. ==Climate== Narsarsuaq experiences boundary subarctic climate (K√∂ppen: Dfc), which with a margin escapes being classified as polar climate, which is typical for the rest of Greenland. Despite its rather chilly temperatures, Narsarsuaq is one of the few places in Greenland with abundant naturally growing trees. This is due to several factors. Its geographical position is extremely sheltered from harsh subpolar winds by multiple layers of tall mountains to the west, and there is a heavy oceanic influence that results in a rather stable and steady amount of precipitation year-round. The oceanic influence can be observed in the occasional Atlantic storms that often pound the region (which results with a fairly wet climate) and a moderate amount of precipitation per year (which could also be considered rather high in Greenlandic standards). Due to the fair climatic conditions, Narsarsuaq is the site of Greenland's only botanical garden, the \\"Greenlandic Arboretum\\". == Greenlandic Arboretum == Arboretum Groenlandicum Trees of Greenland On the lower slopes of the Mellemlandet ridge, close to Narsarsuaq Airport, there is a unique 'botanical garden of the Arctic', called the Greenlandic Arboretum. The goal is to establish a live collection of trees and bushes native to both the arctic and the alpine tree-lines of the entire Northern Hemisphere. Founded in 1988, it encompasses 15 hectares and it shelters 110 plant species, mostly varieties of boreal taiga trees, such as Siberian larch, lodgepole pine, white spruce, or Sitka spruce, and various bushes. Many individual trees are tagged or otherwise marked. The plantation currently has more than 50,000 trees of various provenances. == References == Category:Populated places in Greenland ","title":"Narsarsuaq"},{"id":"305331","text":"In mathematics, a quadratic irrational number (also known as a quadratic irrational, a quadratic irrationality or quadratic surd) is an irrational number that is the solution to some quadratic equation with rational coefficients which is irreducible over the rational numbers.J√∂rn Steuding, Diophantine Analysis, (2005), Chapman & Hall, p.72. Since fractions in the coefficients of a quadratic equation can be cleared by multiplying both sides by their common denominator, a quadratic irrational is an irrational root of some quadratic equation whose coefficients are integers. The quadratic irrational numbers, a subset of the complex numbers, are algebraic numbers of degree 2, and can therefore be expressed as :{a+b\\\\sqrt{c} \\\\over d}, for integers ; with , and non-zero, and with square-free. When is positive, we get real quadratic irrational numbers, while a negative gives complex quadratic irrational numbers which are not real numbers. This defines an injection from the quadratic irrationals to the quadruples of integers, so their cardinality is at most countable; since on the other hand every square root of a prime number is a distinct quadratic irrational, and there are countably many prime numbers, they are at least countable; hence the quadratic irrationals are a countable set. Quadratic irrationals are used in field theory to construct field extensions of the field of rational numbers . Given the square-free integer , the augmentation of by quadratic irrationals using produces a quadratic field ). For example, the inverses of elements of ) are of the same form as the above algebraic numbers: :{d \\\\over a+b\\\\sqrt{c}} = {ad - bd\\\\sqrt{c} \\\\over a^2-b^2c}. Quadratic irrationals have useful properties, especially in relation to continued fractions, where we have the result that all real quadratic irrationals, and only real quadratic irrationals, have periodic continued fraction forms. For example :\\\\sqrt{3}=1.732\\\\ldots=[1;1,2,1,2,1,2,\\\\ldots] The periodic continued fractions can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the rational numbers. The correspondence is explicitly provided by Minkowski's question mark function, and an explicit construction is given in that article. It is entirely analogous to the correspondence between rational numbers and strings of binary digits that have an eventually-repeating tail, which is also provided by the question mark function. Such repeating sequences correspond to periodic orbits of the dyadic transformation (for the binary digits) and the Gauss map h(x)=1/x-\\\\lfloor 1/x \\\\rfloor for continued fractions. ==Real quadratic irrational numbers and indefinite binary quadratic forms== We may rewrite a quadratic irrationality as follows: :\\\\frac{a+b\\\\sqrt{c}} d = \\\\frac{a+\\\\sqrt{b^2c}} d. It follows that every quadratic irrational number can be written in the form :\\\\frac{a+\\\\sqrt{c}} d. This expression is not unique. Fix a non-square, positive integer c congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4, and define a set S_c as : S_c = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\, \\\\frac{a+\\\\sqrt{c}} d \\\\colon a, d \\\\text{ integers, } d \\\\text{ even}, \\\\, \\\\, a^2 \\\\equiv c \\\\pmod{2d} \\\\, \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Every quadratic irrationality is in some set S_c, since the congruence conditions can be met by scaling the numerator and denominator by an appropriate factor. A matrix :\\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\alpha & \\\\beta\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\gamma & \\\\delta\\\\end{pmatrix} with integer entries and \\\\alpha \\\\delta-\\\\beta \\\\gamma=1 can be used to transform a number y in S_c. The transformed number is :z = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha y+\\\\beta}{\\\\gamma y+\\\\delta} If y is in S_c, then z is too. The relation between y and z above is an equivalence relation. (This follows, for instance, because the above transformation gives a group action of the group of integer matrices with determinant 1 on the set S_c.) Thus, S_c partitions into equivalence classes. Each equivalence class comprises a collection of quadratic irrationalities with each pair equivalent through the action of some matrix. Serret's theorem implies that the regular continued fraction expansions of equivalent quadratic irrationalities are eventually the same, that is, their sequences of partial quotients have the same tail. Thus, all numbers in an equivalence class have continued fraction expansions that are eventually periodic with the same tail. There are finitely many equivalence classes of quadratic irrationalities in S_c. The standard proof of this involves considering the map \\\\phi from binary quadratic forms of discriminant c to S_c given by : \\\\phi (tx^2 + uxy + vy^2) = \\\\frac{-u + \\\\sqrt{c}}{2t} A computation shows that \\\\phi is a bijection that respects the matrix action on each set. The equivalence classes of quadratic irrationalities are then in bijection with the equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms, and Lagrange showed that there are finitely many equivalence classes of binary quadratic forms of given discriminant. Through the bijection \\\\phi, expanding a number in S_c in a continued fraction corresponds to reducing the quadratic form. The eventually periodic nature of the continued fraction is then reflected in the eventually periodic nature of the orbit of a quadratic form under reduction, with reduced quadratic irrationalities (those with a purely periodic continued fraction) corresponding to reduced quadratic forms. ==Square root of non-square is irrational== The definition of quadratic irrationals requires them to satisfy two conditions: they must satisfy a quadratic equation and they must be irrational. The solutions to the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are :\\\\frac{-b\\\\pm\\\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}. Thus quadratic irrationals are precisely those real numbers in this form that are not rational. Since b and 2a are both integers, asking when the above quantity is irrational is the same as asking when the square root of an integer is irrational. The answer to this is that the square root of any natural number that is not a square number is irrational. The square root of 2 was the first such number to be proved irrational. Theodorus of Cyrene proved the irrationality of the square roots of non-square natural numbers up to 17, but stopped there, probably because the algebra he used could not be applied to the square root of numbers greater than 17. Euclid's Elements Book 10 is dedicated to classification of irrational magnitudes. The original proof of the irrationality of the non-square natural numbers depends on Euclid's lemma. Many proofs of the irrationality of the square roots of non-square natural numbers implicitly assume the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which was first proven by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. This asserts that every integer has a unique factorization into primes. For any rational non-integer in lowest terms there must be a prime in the denominator which does not divide into the numerator. When the numerator is squared that prime will still not divide into it because of the unique factorization. Therefore, the square of a rational non-integer is always a non-integer; by contrapositive, the square root of an integer is always either another integer, or irrational. Euclid used a restricted version of the fundamental theorem and some careful argument to prove the theorem. His proof is in Euclid's Elements Book X Proposition 9. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic is not actually required to prove the result, however. There are self- contained proofs by Richard Dedekind, among others. The following proof was adapted by Colin Richard Hughes from a proof of the irrationality of the square root of 2 found by Theodor Estermann in 1975. Assume D is a non-square natural number, then there is a number n such that: :n2 < D < (n + 1)2, so in particular :0 < ‚àí n < 1\\\\. Assume the square root of D is a rational number p/q, assume the q here is the smallest for which this is true, hence the smallest number for which q is also an integer. Then: :( ‚àí n)q = qD ‚àí nq is also an integer. But 0 < ( ‚àí n) < 1 so ( ‚àí n)q < q. Hence ( ‚àí n)q is an integer smaller than q. This is a contradiction since q was defined to be the smallest number with this property; hence cannot be rational. ==See also== * Algebraic number field * Apotome (mathematics) * Periodic continued fraction * Restricted partial quotients * Quadratic integer ==ReferencesContinued fraction calculator for quadratic irrationals * Proof that e is not a quadratic irrational Category:Number theory ","title":"Quadratic irrational number"},{"id":"305336","text":"Augustus Hill Garland (June 11, 1832 ‚Äì January 26, 1899) was an American lawyer and Democratic politician from Arkansas, who initially opposed Arkansas' secession from the United States, but later served in both houses of the Congress of the Confederate States and the United States Senate, as well as became the 11th Governor of Arkansas (1874-1877) and the 38th Attorney General of the United States (1885-1889).Appleton's Cyclopedia vol.

In the election of 1860, Garland was a presidential elector in the Arkansas Electoral College for the Constitutional Union Party voting for the party's nominees of John Bell and Edward Everett. ==American Civil War== The election of Republican Abraham Lincoln to the Presidency of the United States led to the secession of the Deep South states from the Union. Garland consistently opposed secession and advocated Arkansas's continued allegiance to the United States. His elder brother Rufus Garland (1830-1886) raised a Confederate infantry company (the \\"Hempstead Hornets\\") and accepted a captain's commission.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/80619613/rufus-k- garland Augustus Garland was selected to represent Pulaski County at the 1861 secession convention in Little Rock, where he voiced his opposition. After Lincoln called for 75,000 troops from Arkansas to help suppress the Confederate States, Garland reluctantly gave his support to secession. ===Confederate States Congress=== Garland was appointed to the Provisional Confederate Congress and was elected to the Confederate House of Representatives in the 1st Confederate States Congress in 1861, where he was a member of the Committees on Public Lands, Commerce and Financial Independence, and the Judiciary. He was reelected in 1863, and in 1864 was appointed to the Confederate States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Charles B. Mitchel. As a Congressman, he made efforts to establish a Supreme Court of the Confederate States and supported President Jefferson Davis, with the exception of Davis' aside suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the duration of the war (as had Lincoln in the North). He returned to Arkansas in February 1865, when it was clear the Confederacy was about to lose so that he could help facilitate the return of his state to the Union. ==Postwar== ===Ex parte Garland=== Not long after the Civil War ended, President Andrew Johnson pardoned Garland on July 15, 1865. He was nonetheless forbidden to resume his legal practice without taking the Ironclad Oath, which the United States Congress had required of all Confederate government or military officials, per a law passed on January 24, 1865. In Ex parte Garland, Garland argued that the law was unconstitutional and ex post facto. On January 14, 1867, by a vote of five to four, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed. The ruling caused considerable uproar in the north, but former Confederates hoped that the judicial system could be used to prevent the implementation of Congressional Reconstruction. Garland then pushed the Supreme Court to hear the case of Mississippi v. Johnson which challenged the constitutionality of those acts; however, the Court refused. ===Political career=== Augustus H. Garland (c. 1870). Arkansas legislators elected him to the United States Senate for a term beginning in 1867 but was not allowed to take the seat because Arkansas had not yet been readmitted to the Union. Garland in 1869 helped found the Southern Historical Society and gathered papers of Arkansas Confederate veterans. As he resumed his legal practice, Garland observed politics from a distance. In 1872, with the Republican Party split into three factions, Arkansas Democrats sought Garland to help elect Democrats into the state legislature and had been considered for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate. During the conflict known as the Brooks-Baxter War, Garland became a primary strategist for Governor Elisha Baxter and briefly served as the secretary of state. He was an advisor and constitutional scholar at the next state constitutional convention and, with strong support from the Democratic Party, was elected Governor of Arkansas. ===Governor of Arkansas=== Garland was faced with a number of problems after taking office as Governor including turmoil in the state over threatening groups like the Ku Klux Klan, an ongoing congressional investigation over the Brooks-Baxter conflict and the state debt of $17,000,000. With help from the finance board, the debt was significantly lowered in two years time. Garland was a strong supporter of better education. He urged the legislature to establish schools for the blind and deaf, successfully advocated in appointing a new president for the Arkansas Industrial University, today the University of Arkansas, and helped found the Branch Normal College, today the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, which made education more accessible for African-Americans. Under his administration, he also oversaw the creation of the Arkansas Bureau of Statistics and the Arkansas Bureau of Agriculture, Mining and Manufacturing. ===United States Senate=== Garland ran successfully for the United States Senate in 1876, thus succeeded Republican Powell Clayton. Voters re-elected him in 1883. In the Senate, he served as a member of the Committees on Public Lands, the Territories and the Judiciary, serving as chairman of the Territories Committee in the 46th Congress. As a Senator, he made efforts to bring about tariff reform, internal improvements, as well as the regulation of interstate commerce and a federal prison system, federal aid to education and civil service reform. ===Attorney General of the United States=== Garland resigned from the Senate in 1885 after accepting the appointment of Attorney General of the United States by newly-elected President Grover Cleveland, becoming the first Arkansan to receive a cabinet post. Not long after taking office, Garland became embroiled in a political scandal. While serving in the Senate, Garland became a shareholder in and attorney for the Pan-Electric Telephone Company which was organized to form regional telephone companies using equipment developed by J. Harris Rogers. The Bell Telephone Company brought suit against Pan-Electric for patent infringement after it was discovered that their equipment was similar to that of Bell's. Garland was ordered to bring a suit in the name of the United States to invalidate the Bell patent, breaking their monopoly of telephone technology, but refused to do so. However, while Garland was on vacation in the summer, Solicitor General John Goode authorized the suit. A year-long congressional investigation and constant public attention affected his work as Attorney General, however, despite having to serve under a cloud of suspicion, he was supported by President Cleveland. Garland was also the first, and to date only, United States cabinet secretary to be censured by Congress when, in 1886, Garland failed to provide documents about the firing of a United States Attorney. ==Later life and death== President Cleveland lost reelection to Benjamin Harrison in the 1888 election and Garland left office at the end of Cleveland's term in 1889. He resumed practicing law in Washington, D.C. and published a number of books, including The Constitution As It Is (1880), Experience in the Supreme Court of the United States, with Some Reflections and Suggestions as to that Tribunal (1883), Third-Term Presidential (1896), Experience in the Supreme Court of the United States (1898) and Treatise on the Constitution and Jurisdiction of the United States Courts (1898). On January 26, 1899, while arguing a case before the Supreme Court, Garland suffered a stroke and died a few hours later in the Capitol. He was interred at Mount Holly Cemetery in Little Rock, Arkansas. ==Legacy== Garland County, Arkansas, was named after him as was Garland, Texas. ==See also== * List of Confederate States Senators * List of Governors of Arkansas * List of people from Tennessee * List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States * List of United States Senators from Arkansas ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Augustus Hill Garland at Encyclopedia of Arkansas * *Augustus Hill Garland at the National Governors Association *Augustus Hill Garland at the Old State House Museum * Category:1832 births Category:1899 deaths Category:19th-century American politicians Category:Arkansas Constitutional Unionists Category:Arkansas Democrats Category:Arkansas Know Nothings Category:Arkansas lawyers Category:Arkansas Whigs Category:Burials at Mount Holly Cemetery Category:Cleveland administration cabinet members Category:Confederate States Senators Category:Democratic Party state governors of the United States Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:Deputies and delegates to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States Category:Garland County, Arkansas Category:Governors of Arkansas Category:Members of the Confederate House of Representatives from Arkansas Category:People from Hempstead County, Arkansas Category:People from Covington, Tennessee Category:People of Arkansas in the American Civil War Category:Politicians from Little Rock, Arkansas Category:Recipients of American presidential pardons Category:United States Attorneys General Category:1860 United States presidential electors Category:United States senators from Arkansas ","title":"Augustus Hill Garland"},{"id":"305339","text":"Ruins of the city of Dai, Zhao's last capital Zhao () was one of the seven major states during the Warring States period of ancient China. It was created from the three-way Partition of Jin, together with Han and Wei, in the 5th century BC. Zhao gained significant strength from the military reforms initiated during King Wuling's reign, but suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Qin at the Battle of Changping. Its territory included areas now in modern Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces. It bordered the Xiongnu, the states of Qin, Wei and Yan. Its capital was Handan, in modern Hebei Province. Zhao was home to administrative philosopher Shen Dao, sophist Gongsun Long and the Confucian Xun Kuang.Huang Kejian 2010 p.185. From Destiny to Dao: A Survey of Pre-Qin Philosophy in China. https://books.google.com/books?id=bATIDgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA185 == Origins and ascendancy == The Zhao clan within Jin had accumulated power for centuries, including annexing the Baidi state of Dai for themselves during the mid-5th centuryBC. At the end of the Spring and Autumn Period, Jin was divided up between three powerful ministers; Xiangzi, the Zhao family patriarch being one of them. In 403 BC, the king of Zhou formally recognized the existence of the State of Zhao along with two other States, Han and Wei, marking the start of the Warring States Period. At the onset of the Warring States period, Zhao was one of the weaker states. Despite its extensive territory, its northern border was frequently subject to harassment by the Xiongnu and by other northern nomadic peoples. At the same time, Zhao was surrounded by strong states and lacked the military strength of Wei or the prosperity of Qi. Zhao became a pawn in the struggle between the states of Wei and Qi, and this struggle came to a climax in 354 BC when Wei invaded Zhao, and Zhao had to seek aid from Qi. The resulting Battle of Guiling was a major victory for Qi, and it consequently lessened the threat to Zhao's southern border. Zhao remained relatively weak until the military reforms of King Wuling of Zhao (325-299 BC). The soldiers of Zhao were ordered to dress like their Xiongnu neighbours and to replace war chariots with cavalry archers. This reform proved to be a brilliant strategy. With the advanced technology of the Chinese states and nomadic tactics, the cavalry of Zhao became a powerful force. The result was that the newly strengthened Zhao was evenly matched against its greatest enemy, the state of Qi. Zhao demonstrated its enhanced military prowess by conquering the State of Zhongshan in 295 BC after a prolonged war, and annexing territory from its neighbouring states of Wei, Yan, and Qin. During this time, the cavalry of Zhao also occasionally intruded into the state of Qi in campaigns against the state of Chu. Several brilliant military commanders of the period appeared concurrently, including Lian Po, Zhao She and Li Mu. Lian Po proved instrumental in defending Zhao against the Qin. Zhao She was most active in the east; leading the invasion of the Yan state. Li Mu defended Zhao from the Xiongnu and later from Qin. ==Fall of Zhao== By the end of the Warring States Period, Zhao was the only state strong enough to oppose the powerful Qin state. An alliance with Wei against Qin commenced in 287 BC but ended in defeat at Huayang in 273 BC. The struggle then culminated in the bloodiest battle of the whole period, the Battle of Changping in 260 BC. The troops of Zhao were completely defeated by Qin. Although the forces of Wei and Chu saved Handan from a follow-up siege by the victorious Qin, Zhao would never recover from the enormous loss of men in the battle. In 229 BC, invasions led by the Qin general Wang Jian were opposed by Li Mu and his subordinate officer Sima Shang () until 228 BC. Li Mu was one of the best generals of the Warring States era, and although he was unable to defeat Wang Jian (also one of the best generals of the period), Wang Jian was unable to make headway either. The invasion developed into a stalemate. Realizing that he had to get rid of Li Mu to conquer Zhao, the emperor of Qin, Qin Shihuang, attempted to sow discord among the Zhao leadership. Zhao King Youmiu fell for the scheme: acting on faulty advice from disloyal court officials and Qin infiltrators, he ordered the execution of Li Mu and relieved Sima Shang from his duties. Li Mu's replacement, Zhao Cong, was promptly defeated by Wang Jian. Qin captured King Youmiu and conquered Zhao in 228 BC. Prince Jia, the half-brother of King Qian, was proclaimed King Jia at Dai and led the last Zhao forces against the Qin. The regime lasted until 222 BC, when the Qin army captured him and defeated his forces at Dai. A rebel named Wu Chen, following Chen Sheng and Wu Guang's suits at Chu, proclaimed himself King of Zhao. Wu was later killed by his subordinate Li Liang (). Zhang Er () and Chen Yu (), former officials of Zhao, created a Zhao royal, Zhao Xie (), as king of Zhao. In 206 BC, the rebel lord of Chu, Xiang Yu, defeated the Qin dynasty and created himself and other seventeen lords as kings, making Zhao Xie the king of Dai. Chen Yu helped Zhao Xie taking back the land of Zhao from Zhang Er, so Zhao Xie created Chen Yu prince of Dai. In 205 BC, Chen Yu's subordinate at Dai, Xia Yue (), was defeated by Liu Bang's generals Han Xin and Zhang Er. Chen Yu was defeated by Han Xin in 204 BC and later, Zhao Xie was killed by Han forces. Liu Bang gifted the state of Zhao to Zhang Er. In 154 BC, an unrelated Zhao (), headed by Liu Sui (), the Prince of Zhao kingdom, participated in the unsuccessful Rebellion of the Seven States () against the newly installed second emperor of the Han dynasty. ==Culture and society== Massive tombs of the Kings of Zhao near Handan Before the state of Qin unified China in 221 BC, each region had their own unique customs and culture, although they were all dominated by an upper class that shared a largely common culture. In the Yu Gong (Tribute of Yu), a section of the Book of Documents which was most likely composed in the 4th century BC, the author describes a China that is divided into nine regions, each with its own distinctive peoples and products. The core theme of this section is that these nine regions are unified into one state by the travels of the eponymous sage, Yu the Great and by sending each region's unique goods to the capital as tribute. Other texts also discussed these regional variations in culture and physical environments. One of these texts was Wuzi (The Book of Master Wu) which was a Warring States military treatise written in response to a query by Marquis Wu of Wei on how to cope with the other states. Wu Qi, the author of the work, declared that the government and nature of the people were linked to the physical environment and territory they live in. Of Zhao, he said: == List of Zhao rulers == === Before the partition of Jin === * Chengzi of Zhao * Xuanzi of Zhao * Zhuangzi of Zhao * Wenzi of Zhao * Jingzi of Zhao () * Jianzi of Zhao () * Xiangzi of Zhao () * Huanzi of Zhao () === After the partition of Jin === * Marquess Xian (), personal name Huan (), ruled 424 BC-409 BC * Marquess Lie (), personal name Ji (), son of previous, ruled 409 BC-387 BC, noted for several reforms * Marquess Jing (), personal name Zhang (), son of previous, ruled 387 BC-375 BC * Marquess Cheng (), personal name Zhong (), son of previous, ruled 375 BC-350 BC * Marquess Su (), personal name Yu (), son of previous, ruled 350 BC-326 BC * King Wuling (), personal name Yong (), son of previous, ruled 326 BC-Spring 299 BC * King Huiwen (), personal name He (), son of previous, ruled Spring 299 BC-266 BC * King Xiaocheng (), personal name Dan (), son of previous, ruled 266 BC-245 BC * King Daoxiang (), personal name Yan (), son of previous, ruled 245 BC-236 BC * King Youmiu (), personal name Qian (), son of previous, ruled 236 BC-228 BC * King Jia of Dai (), personal name Jia (), half-brother of previous, ruled 228 BC-222 BC * Xie, King of Zhao (), ruled 209 BC-205 BC.

William Langland (; ; 1332 ‚Äì c. 1386) is the presumed author of a work of Middle English alliterative verse generally known as Piers Plowman, an allegory with a complex variety of religious themes. The poem translated the language and concepts of the cloister into symbols and images that could be understood by a layman. == Life == Very little is known of Langland himself. It seems that he was born in the West Midlands of England in 1330. The narrator in Piers Plowman receives his first vision while sleeping in the Malvern Hills (between Herefordshire and Worcestershire), which suggests some connection to the area. The dialect of the poem is also consistent with this part of the country. Langland is believed to have been born in Cleobury Mortimer, Shropshire, although Ledbury, Herefordshire, and Great Malvern, Worcestershire also have strong claims to being his birthplace. There is a plaque to that effect in the porch of Cleobury Mortimer's parish church, which also contains a memorial window, placed in 1875, depicting the Piers Plowman vision. Langland is thought to have been a novitiate of Woodhouse Friary located nearby. There are strong indications that Langland died in 1385 or 1386. A note written by \\"Iohan but\\" (John But) in a 14th-century manuscript of the poem (Rawlinson 137) makes direct reference to the death of its author: \\"whan this werke was wrouyt, ere Wille myte aspie/ Deth delt him a dent and drof him to the erthe/ And is closed vnder clom\\" (\\"once this work was made, before Will was aware/ Death struck him a blow and knocked him to the ground/ And now he is buried under the soil\\"). According to Edith Rickert, John But himself seems to have died in 1387, indicating that Langland died shortly before this date. Most of what is believed about Langland has been reconstructed from Piers Plowman. The C text of the poem contains a passage in which the narrator describes himself as a \\"loller\\" or \\"idler\\" living in the Cornhill area of London, and refers to his wife and child. It also suggests that he was well above average height and made a living reciting prayers for the dead. However, the distinction between allegory and reality in Piers Plowman is blurred, and the entire passage, as Wendy Scase observes, is reminiscent of the false confession tradition in medieval literature (also seen in the Confessio Goliae and in Jean de Meun's Roman de la Rose). A similar passage in the final Passus of the B and C texts provides further ambiguous details on the poet's wife and his torments by Elde (Old Age), including baldness, gout, and impotence. This may indicate that the poet had reached middle age by the 1370s, but the accuracy of the passage is called into question by the conventional nature of the description (see, for instance, Walter Kennedy's \\"In Praise of Aige\\" and The Parliament of the Three Ages) and the fact that it occurs near the end of the poem, when Will's personal development is reaching its logical conclusion. The detailed and highly sophisticated religious knowledge displayed in the poem indicates that Langland had some connection to the clergy, but the nature of this relationship is uncertain. The poem shows no obvious bias towards any particular group or order of churchmen, but is even-handed in its anticlericalism. This makes it difficult to align Langland with any specific order. He is probably best regarded, John Bowers writes, as a member of \\"that sizable group of unbeneficed clerks who formed the radical fringe of contemporary society ... the poorly shod Will is portrayed 'y-robed in russet' traveling about the countryside, a crazed dissident showing no respect to his superiors\\". Malcolm Godden has proposed that he lived as an itinerant hermit, attaching himself to a patron temporarily and exchanging writing services for shelter and food. Robert Crowley's 1550 edition of Piers Plowman promoted the idea that Langland was a follower of John Wycliffe. However, this conclusion is challenged by early Lollard appropriation of the Plowman figure (see, for instance, Pierce the Ploughman's Crede and The Plowman's Tale). It is true that Langland and Wycliffe shared many concerns: Both questioned the value of indulgences and pilgrimages, promoted the use of the vernacular in preaching, attacked clerical corruption, and even advocated disendowment. But these topics were widely discussed throughout the late 14th century and were not specifically associated with Wycliffe until after the presumed time of Langland's death. Also, as Pamela Gradon observes, at no point does Langland echo Wycliffe's characteristic teachings on the sacraments. == Attribution == The attribution of Piers Plowman to Langland rests principally on the evidence of a manuscript held at Trinity College, Dublin (MS 212). This manuscript ascribes Piers Plowman to Willielmi de Langland, son of Stacy de Rokayle, \\"who died in Shipton-under-Wychwood, a tenant of the Lord Spenser in the county of Oxfordshire\\". Other manuscripts name the author as Robert or William Langland, or Wilhelms W. (most likely shorthand for William of Wychwood). The poem itself also seems to point to Langland's authorship. At one point, the narrator remarks: \\"I have lived in londe [...] my name is longe wille\\" (B XV.152). This can be taken as a coded reference to the poet's name, in the style of much late-medieval literature (see, for instance, Villon's acrostics in Le Testament). However, it has also been suggested that medieval scribes and readers may have understood this line as referring to a \\"William Longwille\\", the pseudonym used by a Norfolk rebel in 1381. Although there is little other evidence, Langland's authorship has been widely accepted since the 1920s. It is not, however, entirely beyond dispute, as recent work by Stella Pates and C. David Benson has demonstrated.C. David Benson, \\"The Langland Myth,\\" in William Langland's Piers Plowman: A Book of Essays, ed. Kathleen M.

In the \\"first wave\\" of vocalese creation, this sometimes took the form of a tribute to the original instrumentalist. The word \\"vocalese\\" is a play on the musical term \\"vocalise\\"; the suffix \\"-ese\\" is meant to indicate a sort of language. The term is attributed by Jon Hendricks to jazz critic Leonard Feather to describe the first Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross album, Sing a Song of Basie. Most vocalese lyrics are entirely syllabic, as opposed to melismatic. This may lead to the use of many words sung quickly in a given phrase, especially in the case of bebop. ==History== The inventor of vocalese was Eddie Jefferson, whose rendition of Coleman Hawkins's solo on \\"Body and Soul\\" became a hit on its own. Pioneers of vocalese include King Pleasure and Babs Gonzales, Jefferson's former dance partner. Pleasure first gained popularity singing Jefferson's vocalese classic \\"Moody's Mood for Love\\", based on a James Moody saxophone solo to \\"I'm in the Mood for Love\\". However, Kurt Elling makes a point to recognize Bee Palmer, who sang lyrics to a Bix Biederbecke and Frankie Trumbauer solo on \\"Singin' the Blues\\" as early as 1929. ==Notable vocalese performers== Vocalise's best-known practitioners and popularisers are Lambert, Hendricks and Ross, consisting of Jon Hendricks, Dave Lambert and Annie Ross. Other performers known for vocalese include Bob Dorough, Giacomo Gates, Kurt Elling, Al Jarreau, Mark Murphy, Roger Miller, New York Voices, The Royal Bopsters and The Manhattan Transfer, whose Grammy-winning version of Weather Report's \\"Birdland\\" featured lyrics by Jon Hendricks. In 1990, Hendricks released \\"Freddie Freeloader\\", a vocalese rendition of the Miles Davis song, which featured Jarreau, George Benson, and Bobby McFerrin. Joni Mitchell recorded lyrics to Charles Mingus's tunes, with \\"The Dry Cleaner from Des Moines\\" and \\"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat\\" on her album, Mingus, in 1979.[ Mingus] on AllMusic. Retrieved on March 5, 2009 Vocalese singers around the world include Les Double Six, popular in the 1960s, and in Canada, Emilie-Claire Barlow.

It is currently in service in the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), replacing the AIM-9 Sidewinder. ASRAAM is designed to outrange and outrun any other IR missile in service, allowing the pilot to fire and then turn away long before the opposing aircraft can close for a shot. It flies at well over Mach 3 to ranges as great as , considerably over double the range of earlier designs. It retains a 50 g manoeuvrability provided by body lift technology coupled with tail control.. The project started as a British-German collaboration in the 1980s. It was part of a wider agreement in which the US would develop the AIM-120 AMRAAM for medium-range use, while the ASRAAM would replace the Sidewinder with a design that would cover the great range disparity between Sidewinder and AMRAAM. Germany left the programme after examining the latest Soviet designs of the 1980s, though it was suggested that this was a smokescreen for financial and defence industrial share issues. The British proceeded on their own, and the missile was introduced into RAF service in 1998. It has since been selected to replace Sidewinder in the Royal Australian Air Force and is being introduced to the Indian Air Force. Parts of the missile have been used in the Common Anti-aircraft Modular Missile. ==History== ===Prior work=== The first extensive use of IR missiles took place during the Vietnam War, where the results were dismal. The AIM-4 Falcon, the USAF's primary missile, scored hits only 9% of the time it was fired, while the US Navy's AIM-9 Sidewinder fared only slightly better, depending on the model. It became clear that there were two basic issues causing the problem. One was that the pilots were firing as soon as the missile saw the target in the seeker, any time it was in front of the launch aircraft. However, the seekers had a very limited field of view so if the target aircraft was flying at right angles to the launcher, it would fly out of the seeker's view even as it left the launch rail. The other is that the rocket motor often burned out long before the missile reached its target (which is common with missiles, a typical motor burn time being around 4 seconds, the missile maneuvering on its velocity energy after motor burnout). One attempt to improve matters was made starting in the late 1960s by the Hawker Siddeley \\"Taildog\\", initially a private project but later officially supported as SRAAM. SRAAM's basic premise is that if pilots wanted to fire when the target was anywhere in front, then the missile should work in those situations. The result was a very short range but extremely maneuverable weapon that could turn rapidly enough to keep the target in view no matter the launch parameters. However, by 1974 the program had been downgraded to a pure development project, and was later cancelled. The US started a similar project, AIM-95 Agile, to arm the new F-14 and F-15. This was similar to SRAAM in concept, but somewhat larger in order to offer range about the same or better than Sidewinder. Development was cancelled in 1975. Meanwhile, an entire different set of criteria led to the Dornier Viper, whose design maximized range. The main reason these projects were cancelled was that a new version of the Sidewinder was introduced (the AIM-9L) which added all-aspect capabilities and wider seeker angles. A variety of changes gave the L slightly better manoeuvrability, speed and range, but the main change was that the seeker had much higher tracking angles and allowed head-on engagements. Although not nearly as great a step forward as the other designs, the \\"Lima\\" offered a significant improvement in capability over the older models with very little additional cost. British pilots achieved an 80% kill ratio with the L model during the Falklands War, a number matched by the Israeli Air Force a few months later over the Bekaa Valley. US experience with the Sidewinder since then has been mixed, with a percentage kill of just under 60% for the F-15, but almost zero for F-16s and F/A-18s, including a notable miss in 2017 when a 1970s-era Syrian Su-22 \\"Fitter\\" defeated a modern AIM-9X launched by a US Navy F/A-18. ===AMRAAM and ASRAAM=== In a series of tests in the mid-1970s, the USAF found that their existing AIM-7 Sparrow missile had an effective range against fighter targets no better than the ostensibly much shorter-range Sidewinder. This was due to the need for the launching aircraft to keep flying towards the target in order to allow its radar to continue illuminating the target. During the time the missile was flying, the target aircraft was closing the distance, and had the chance to launch their IR missiles before being hit. This resulted in mutual kills, obviously undesirable. The Fighter Mafia examined these results and concluded that they proved what they had been saying all along: a smaller, cheaper aircraft armed with simple but effective weapons is just as good as a more complex and expensive system, but could be purchased in greater numbers. The USAF looked at the same results and concluded the solution was to design a new weapon to replace the Sparrow. The primary aims were to extend the range to keep the IR- guided missile firing fighters out of launching range, the use of an active seeker to allow the launching fighter to turn away, and, if possible, to reduce the weight enough to allow it to be carried on launchers designed only for the Sidewinder. The result was the AIM-120 AMRAAM project, with the initial versions having a range of 50 to 75 km. The AMRAAM also presented a new problem: between the Sidewinder's short range and AMRAAM's long range was a significant gap. Moreover, AMRAAM was not really intended to be a snap-shot weapon like the Sidewinder, which remained desirable, and the completely passive attack of a heatseeker can be an enormous advantage in combat. A new IR guided missile designed to act as a counterpart to AMRAAM would be a very different design than the AIM-9L, which had always been intended solely as a stop-gap measure. In the 1980s, NATO countries signed a Memorandum of Agreement that the United States would develop the AMRAAM, while a primarily British and German team would develop a short-range air-to-air missile to replace the Sidewinder. The complete team included the UK (Hawker Siddeley, by this point known as BAe Dynamics) and Germany (Bodensee Ger√§tetechnik) sharing 42.5% of the effort each, Canada at 10%, and Norway at 5%. The US assigned this missile the name AIM-132 ASRAAM. ===New ASRAAM=== The rapid decline and eventual fall of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s led to considerably less interest in the ASRAAM effort. By February 1988 the US was already agitating for changes. In July 1989 the Germans exited the program effectively ending the agreement. Various reasons are often cited including the ending of the Cold War and full realisation of the capabilities of the Russian R-73 missile, but many commentators think this was a smokescreen for financial and defence industrial share issues. This left Britain in charge of the project and they began redefining it purely to RAF needs, sending out tenders for the new design in August 1989. This led to the selection of a new Hughes focal plane array imaging array seeker instead of the more conventional design previously used, dramatically improving performance and countermeasure resistance. A UK contest in 1990 examined the new ASRAAM, the French MICA and a new design from Bodensee Geratetechnik, their version of the ASRAAM tuned for German needs. In 1992 the Ministry of Defence announced that ASRAAM had won the contest, and production began in March that year. The German design, by now part of Diehl BGT Defence, became the IRIS-T. While ASRAAM was entering production, momentum behind US-led industrial and political lobbying grew significantly and, combined with the strengthening European economy, forced the US government to conclude testing in June 1996 and move away from the ASRAAM programme. UK development and manufacture went ahead and the first ASRAAM was delivered to the RAF in late 1998. It equips the RAF's Typhoon. It was also used by the RAF's Harrier GR7 and Tornado GR4 forces until their retirement. In February 1998 ASRAAM was selected by the Royal Australian Air Force for use on their F/A-18 Hornets following competitive evaluation of the improved ASRAAM, the Rafael Python 4 and the AIM-9X. In March 2009 the Royal Australian Air Force successfully carried out the first in-service \\"Lock on After Launch\\" firing of an ASRAAM at a target located behind the wing-line of the \\"shooter\\" aircraft. ==Description== ===Characteristics=== ASRAAM is a high speed, extremely manoeuvrable, heat-seeking, air-to-air missile. Built by MBDA, it is designed as a \\"fire-and-forget\\" missile. ASRAAM is intended to detect and launch against targets at much longer ranges, as far as early versions of the AMRAAM, in order to shoot down the enemy long before it closes enough to be able to fire its own weapons. In this respect the ASRAAM shares more in common with the AMRAAM than other IR missiles, although it retains high maneuverability. To provide the needed power, the ASRAAM is built on a 16.51 cm (6¬Ω inch) diameter rocket motor compared with Sidewinder's (AIM-9M and X) and IRIS-T's 12.7 cm (5-inch) motors (which trace their history to the 1950s unguided Zuni rocket). This gives the ASRAAM significantly more thrust and therefore increased speed and range up to 50 km. The main improvement is a new 128√ó128 resolution imaging infrared focal plane array (FPA) seeker manufactured by Hughes before they were acquired by Raytheon. This seeker has a long acquisition range, high countermeasures resistance, approximately 90-degree off-boresight lock-on capability, and the possibility to designate specific parts of the targeted aircraft (like cockpit, engines, etc.). The ASRAAM also has a LOAL (Lock-On After Launch) ability which is a distinct advantage when the missile is carried in an internal bay such as in the F-35 Lightning II. The ASRAAM warhead is triggered either by laser proximity fuse or impact. A laser proximity fuse was selected because RF fuses are vulnerable to EW intervention from enemy jammers.. The increased diameter of ASRAAM also provides space for increased computing power, and so improved counter counter- measure capabilities compared with other dogfighting missiles such as AIM-9X. ===ASRAAM P3I=== In 1995, Hughes and British Aerospace collaborated on the \\"P3I ASRAAM\\", a version of ASRAAM as a candidate for the AIM-9X program. The P3I would have been very much like the AIM-132, but with the addition of thrust vectoring to provide increased agility and to carry a larger warhead to meet the requirements expressed by the AIM-9X program. The ultimate winner was the Hughes submission using the same seeker but with the rocket motor, fuze and warhead of the AIM-9M. The latter was a US Air Force stipulation to ease the logistics burden and save money by reusing as much as possible of the existing AIM-9 Sidewinder, of which 20,000 remained in the US inventory. ===Future development=== At the DSEi conference in September 2007 it was announced the UK MoD was funding a study by MBDA to investigate a replacement for the Rapier and Sea Wolf missiles. The Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM) would share components with ASRAAM.. Common components include the very low signature rocket motor from Roxel, the warhead and proximity fuze from Thales. The Common Data Link (CDL) is the small \\"black box\\" that sits on top of the mast, especially clear in pictures of FLAADS(L) although it doesn't necessarily have to use the two-way data link to the launch vehicle, so, it could take mid-course corrections from any number of suitably equipped land or air platforms and then switch to active homing when it gets close enough. The original launch platform could have even moved by the time the missile hits. In 2014, India's defence ministry signed a ¬£250m ($428m) contract with MBDA to equip its Sepecat/Hindustan Aeronautics Jaguar strike aircraft with the company's ASRAAM short range air-to-air missile. MBDA's offering overcame competition from competitors including Rafael's Python-5 missile, emerging as the winner in 2012. This built on an existing 2012 order for 493 MICA missiles to replace Matra S-530D and Magic II missiles as part of an Indian Air Force Mirage 2000 update. In September 2015, the UK's MOD signed a ¬£300 million contract for a new and improved version of the ASRAAM that would leverage new technological developments, including those from the CAMM missile. This variant would replace the current one when it goes out of service in 2022. A further ¬£184 million contract was awarded in August 2016 to provide additional stocks of the new ASRAAM for the UK's F-35B. This new variant will be operationally ready on the Eurofighter Typhoon in 2018 and on the UK's F-35Bs from 2022 onwards. In February 2017, successful firing of ASRAAMs from F-35 Lightning IIs were conducted at Naval Air Station Patuxent River and Edwards Air Force Base in the USA. This represented the first time that a British- designed missile had been fired from an F-35 JSF and the first time any non-US missile had ever been fired from the aircraft. As of 31 January 2019 the Indian Air Force is testing the compatibility of the ASRAAM weapons system with the Sukhoi Su-30MKI, and aims to make ASRAAM its standardised dogfighting missile across multiple aircraft types, including the Tejas. Final testing and operational clearance are to be achieved by the end of 2019. ==Operators== Map with ASRAAM operators in blue ===Current operators=== ;: Royal Air Force, Royal Navy (to be operated from F-35 Lightning II) ;: Royal Australian Air Force operated from F/A-18 Hornet ;: Indian Air Force; on 8 July 2014 India & UK signed a deal to procure 384 ASRAAM from MBDA to replace the ageing Matra Magic R550, to be integrated onto the SEPECAT Jaguar strike aircraft.. ==See also== *MBDA MICA *R550 Magic *IRIS-T *Python-5 *AIM-9 *R-73 (missile) *List of missiles ==References== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * .

Mukherjee's own experiences of dislocation and displacement in her life helps her in recording the immigrant experience of the protagonist in this novel. ==Plot summary== Jasmine, which was based on an earlier short story in The Middleman and Other Stories, tells the story of a seventeen-year-old girl widowed after her husband's murder in a bomb attack. She and her husband originally planned to move to Florida, but as a result of his death Jasmine continues with the trip on her own. In her path she faces many obstacles as she travels from Florida to New York City to Iowa. The novel begins with Jasmine retelling a story from her childhood about an astrologer who predicts her future as a widower living in exile. She fast forwards to life in Baden, Iowa where Jasmine (known as Jane in Iowa) is 24 years old, pregnant and living with 53-year-old banker Bud Ripplemayer, and his adopted son Du. Bud insists on marrying Jane, who refuses for unknown reasons. Bud is also in a wheelchair because he was shot in the back two years ago. Jane and Bud have a neighbor named Darrel Lutz, a recent college grad who inherited his family's farm. He is contemplating whether or not to sell his farm. Bud refuses to loan Darrel money to expand his herd and grow his crops because Bud doesn't trust Darrel's character as a farmer and a manager. Darrel also shows some romantic interest in Jane. Jane walks us through her life with Du and Bud before flashing back to her life in Hasnapur, Jullundhar district, Punjab, India (page 39). Here in India, she is known as Jyoti. She has a teacher named Masterji, who teaches her English. Masterji urges Jyoti to continue with her education instead of getting married. Soon after Jyoti's father passes away, she meets Prakash. They marry and move in together. He begins to call her Jasmine. Prakash works two jobs and studies for his diploma exams while Jasmine runs a Ladies' Group raffle and sells detergent to make money. Prakash receives a letter from Professor Vadhera who encourages Prakash to study in America. He makes plans to move the two of them to Florida, when while out shopping for saris, Prakash is killed by a bomb, set off by a man named Sukhwinder. He yells \\"Prostitutes! Whores!\\" at Jasmine before the bomb goes off. As \\"a matter of duty and honor,\\" Jasmine continues with Prakash's plans to move to Florida, travelling by plane, train, and ship. Half-Face, the captain of the ship drives Jasmine to a motel when they arrive to land. He then sexually assaults her. Jasmine contemplates killing herself but instead kills Half-Face. She burns Prakash's suit that she carried with her and leaves the motel. Jasmine meets Lillian Gordon, who takes her in. Mrs. Gordon is also housing three Kanjobal women. She calls Jasmine \\"Jazzy,\\" and helps Jazzy get to New York to meet with Professor Vadhera. Lillian also has a daughter named Kate Gordon-Feldstein who works as a photographer in the city. Lillian is later sent to jail for \\"exploiting\\" undocumenteds for free cooking, cleaning and yard work. For five months, Jasmine lives with Professor Vadhera, whom she calls Professorji. She becomes depressed because she fears to leave the house without a green card. Professorji agrees to get her a green card, for fifty thousand rupees, or three thousand dollars. Jasmine begins working for Wylie and Taylor Hayes, friends of Kate Gordon-Feldstein. She moves in with them in Manhattan to take care of their adopted daughter, Duff. Taylor calls her \\"Jase.\\" Wylie falls out of love with Taylor and falls for Stuart. Wylie leaves Taylor, but Jase continues to take care of Duff. She falls in love with Taylor, but one day while the three of them are at the park, Jase spots Sukhwinder, the man that killed Prakash. She flees New York for Iowa. She chooses Iowa because Duff's birth mother lives in Iowa. Back in present- day Iowa, Jane recalls the night two years ago when Harlan Kroener shot Bud. They were walking to Harlan's car when he shot Bud. He then proceeded to kill himself. Harlan was angry at Bud because of money issues with the bank. Before Bud met Jane, he was married to Karin. Karin initially hates Jane for taking her husband from her, but they maintain a platonic relationship. Jane receives a letter from Taylor, letting her know he and Duff are on their way to find Jane. Du figures out Jane is in love with another man besides Bud. Jane goes to visit Darrel because he says he feels crazy, but she leaves soon when he starts insulting her and Bud's relationship. She suspects he might shoot himself that night. When she returns home, Du announces that he is going to Los Angeles to live with his sister and he leaves with his friend John. Karin visits, and the two of them drive to see how Darrel is faring. He is fixing up his hog house. Back at the house, Jane tells Bud that Du went to visit his sister but he will be back before school starts. Bud later approves of Darrel's loan application, and the two of them drive over to let him know the news. But when they arrive, they discover him hanging from a rafter. Bud begs for Jane to tell him she loves him, but she doesn't respond. Du has decided to stay in California. While Jane is working in the kitchen, she sees a car pull up the driveway and Taylor and Duff get out of the car. Taylor tries to convince Jase to come with him to California. She is conflicted, thinking of Bud who will lose everything if she leaves. She calls Karin and tells her she's \\"going somewhere,\\" to see Du. Jasmine stops thinking of herself as Jane and follows Taylor and Duff to the car, whispering \\"Watch me re-position the stars,\\" to the astrologer who foretold her widowhood and exile. == Main characters == * Jyoti/Jasmine/Jane/Jase - The protagonist of the novel.

It also includes Gulangyu Island to its southwest. The sheltered Yundang Bay responsible for old Xiamen's prized harbor was converted into a lake in the 20th century by the addition of landfill from construction. ==History== The modern Siming District includes the territory of the old town of Xiamen, which had its harbor in the sheltered Yundang Bay. The town took the name \\"Siming\\" for a brief period in the early Qing when it was occupied by the Southern Ming loyalist Koxinga, who used it from 1650 as a base to launch attacks on the Manchu drive southwards. He abandoned the island in favor of Taiwan when he defeated the Dutch there. The Qing held the city from the early 1660s, restoring its former name. Gulangyu Island, now part of the district, developed as a foreign enclave after Xiamen became a treaty port at the end of the First Opium War in 1842. After the fall of the Qing in 1912, the Republic of China organized the area around Xiamen as Siming County.. It was renamed the Central District in October 1945 after its reconquest from the Japanese. Following its capture by the Communists at the end of the Chinese Civil War, it was renamed Siming District in 1950. In April 1953, its \\"district bureau\\" () administration was upgraded to a \\"people's government\\" (). As part of the Cultural Revolution, it was renamed Xiangyang District from August 1966 to October 1979.

This can include courtroom hearings and trials, depositions, sworn statements, and more. Court reporting agencies primarily serve as production houses, and their clients include private law firms, sometimes local or state and federal government agencies, trade associations, meeting planners, and nonprofits.About court reporting and transcription companies. \\"Court reporters, medical transcriptionists and related occupations.\\" Retrieved May 1, 2012. == In the United States == The court reporter in some states is a notary by virtue of their state licensing, and a notary public is authorized to administer oaths to witnesses and who certifies that his or her transcript of the proceedings is a verbatim account of what was said, unlike a court recorder, who only operates recording machinery and sends the audio files for transcription over the internet. Many states require a court reporter to hold a certification obtained through the National Court Reporters Association or the National Verbatim Reporters Association, although some require their own state-specific licensing or certification. It has been determined the public is best served through a licensed individual accountable to the state in which they work. === Skills and training === It typically takes anywhere from two to four years to learn the basic skills to become a stenographic court reporter. Applicants first learn to use the keyboard, which takes the most amount of time, and heavy academic training is also required. Training to learn the basic skills to become a voice writer reporter typically takes six to nine months at the minimum. To become realtime proficient in voice writing can take years to pass certification. Candidates usually attend specialized certificate courses at private business schools, or sometimes associate's or bachelor's degree programs at accredited colleges or universities. Distance learning and online training courses are also available for both methods. After additional on-the-job training and experience, many court reporters then move on to real-time reporting. ===Licensing=== Most states require that court reporters obtain a license via examination before being allowed to practice in that respective state, which ensures accountability to the state versus a corporation. Examinations include writing speed tests at 180 wpm, 200 wpm and 225 wpm, and a written examination to demonstrate proficiency in English, grammar, medical terminology, legal terminology, courtroom decorum, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 30, court reporting procedure and ethics. Licensed court reporters are required to attend yearly continuing education courses of at least 10 hours in order to maintain active licensure. ===Professional associations and licensing entities=== There are two national stenographic court reporting associations in the United States: The National Court Reporters Association (NCRA), the National Verbatim Reporters Association (NVRA). For court recorders who operate machinery, there is The American Association of Electronic Reporters and Transcribers (AAERT). Both the NCRA and NVRA require a minimum speed of 225 words per minute to qualify for certification. AAERT requires 80 percent accuracy on transcripts, and both reporters and transcribers must pass both a written and practical examination. Most of the country's highly skilled stenographic reporters tend to join either the NCRA or NVRA. Anyone can join the merely fee-based AAERT. The NCRA offers the title Registered Professional Reporter (RPR) to those who pass a four-part examination, including a three- part skills exam and a written exam, and participate in continuing education programs. The NVRA offers the title Certified Verbatim Reporter (CVR) to those who pass a four-part examination, including both a skills and written exam, and participate in continuing education programs. A reporter may obtain additional prestigious certifications that demonstrate an even higher level of competency such as Registered Merit Reporter (RMR), Certified Real-time Reporter (CRR), Certified Realtime Captioner (CRC), or Certificate of Merit (CM), Certified Broadcast Captioner (CBC), and Certified CART Provider (CCP) through the NCRA. However, both NCRA and NVRA associations offer equivalent examinations to test reporters for speed and competency on their method of reporting. Further certifications are granted by both associations to court reporters demonstrating skills as broadcast captioners and CART providers. The Canadian Court Reporter John M. Weir (CVR) could voice-write 350 words per minute during legal hearings. American Stenographic Court Reporter Mark Kislingbury is the fastest court reporter. In 2004, he secured the honor in the Guinness World Record by writing 360 words per minute on his stenographic machine. The AAERT offers electronic recorders and transcribers three certifications: certified electronic recorder (CER), certified electronic transcriber (CET), and certified electronic recorder and transcriber (CERT) for setup and use of basic recording equipment. Transcription, however, is not performed by the court recorder in most cases, as the recordings are often sent overseas at the risk of privacy to the parties and witnesses. The International Alliance of Professional Reporters and Transcribers (IAPRT.org) is a member-based not-for-profit consortium engaged in the ongoing development of digital court recording and transcription, and guiding public and private court recording paraprofessionals worldwide toward the goal of producing as much of a verbatim and verifiable record as possible given the number of limits of even modern-day recording equipment. Required skills of a licensed stenographic court reporter are excellent command of the language being spoken, attention to detail, exceptional hearing, and the ability to focus for long periods at a time. The most highly skilled court reporters can provide real-time transcription and have significant earning potential, with salaries up to six figures possible in some areas.https://www.forbes.com/2007/11/03/jobs-salary-degree-lead-careers- cx_mk_1105sixfigure_slide_6.html === Salary and job outlook === In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to report a positive job outlook for stenographic court reporters. Median annual salary in 2010 was listed at $47,700 per year. The top 10 percent of court reporters earned more than $91,280. In May 2012, Forbes listed \\"stenographic court reporter\\" as one of the best jobs that does not require a four-year degree.\\"Best jobs that don't require a four-year degree\\" Forbes. https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/05/17/the-best-jobs-that- dont-require-a-four-year-degree/ As of 2015, the median annual salary for a court reporter was $50,000. The actual amount can vary depending on whether the court reporter works in an in-court capacity as an \\"official\\" reporter or as a reporter of pre-trial discovery (depositions). Additionally, pay can vary based on whether the original and/or a copy of the transcript is ordered by any of the parties to the action. The growth rate of the profession was projected to be 2% to 3%, which is lower than the average of 7%, but the demand has remained high due to a national rise in litigation overall. As of 2012, Maryland employed the most court reporters, while New York has the highest average salary.\\"California ranked second in the nation, only behind Maryland, for its employment of court reporters. It also ranked second, only behind New York, for its pay of court reporters, with an average yearly salary of $76,840 as of May 2012\\" http://courtreportingedu.org/California/ Some states have experienced budget cuts in recent years that have reduced the number of state-funded court reporters. This has resulted in law firms hiring stenographic court reporters directly, as they are independent contractors, to ensure proceedings are verbatim.‚Äú‚Ä¶Court reporters who provide transcripts of hearings have been eliminated for limited civil cases in many counties, making it more difficult for the losing party to appeal.‚Äù Electronically recorded transcripts then transcribed by transcription companies have not solved the problem due to very poor quality. ‚Äú‚Ä¶recession-driven cutbacks in California‚Äôs huge court system have produced long lines and short tempers at courthouses throughout the state. Civil cases are facing growing delays in getting to trial, and court closures have forced residents in some counties to drive several hours for an appearance.‚Äù COCRA http://cocra.org/category/reporter- layoffs/ In 2019, the California Official Court Reporters Association was dissolved. In England the salary range in 2014 for free court reporters vary, with realtime reporters earning $512.59 a day.\\"Many court reporters work freelance and income varies according to the volume of work they undertake. As a freelance reporter, you can expect to earn an average flat rate fee of ¬£120 ‚Äì ¬£180 per day. Real-time reporters working freelance can earn ¬£300 a day.\\" Redgoldfish. http://www.redgoldfish.co.uk/job-roles/301-court-reporter-job- role.aspx/ === Work === Digital recordings often operated by court clerks or AAERT members does not provide for instant play back or review of portions of the recording with ease. A Certified Realtime Reporter (CRR) and a Certified Broadcast Captioner (CBC) offer the ability to show live transcription of the spoken record by captioning what is said to display it on a screen in real time, and as the latter is a stenographic court reporter, they can provide instant read back of testimony unlike a recording. Many stenographic court reporters work as freelance reporters or independent contractors in depositions and other situations that require an official legal transcript, such as arbitration hearings or other formal proceedings. \\"CART\\" providers, computer-aided real-time transcription, also often provide real-time services for public events, religious services, webcasts, and educational services. Stenographic or stenomask court reporting most often allow for a quality transcript produced on an hourly, daily, expedited or standard turnaround. Stenographic court reporters working as broadcast captioners often contract with or by television producers and stations to provide real-time closed captioning of live programs for the hearing-impaired. == Methods == One difference between voice writing court reporters and stenographic court reporters is the method of making the record. The goal of a stenographer is to write verbatim what attorneys, witnesses, and others are saying in a proceeding when the parties are \\"on the record.\\" The goal of a voice writer is to dictate verbatim what attorneys, witnesses, and others are saying in a proceeding. Though the methods of taking down the record are different, the role and duty requirements of the court reporter are the same. These skills of court reporters are primarily measured through certification exams and licensing, which is what protects litigants and the public. The training on a stenograph machine requires the person to pass writing speed tests of up to 225 words a minute on their machine in the United States, as set forth by the National Court Reporters Association (NCRA) in the United States.\\"Registered Professional Reporter.\\" National Court Reporters Association. Only a small percentage of court reporting students per year are able to reach this lofty goal, but with NCRA's \\"A to Z Steno\\" program and virtual classrooms around the country, the number of stenographic court reporters is on the rise. The training with voice writing equipment or stenomask requires the person to pass dictation speed tests of up to 225 words a minute in the United States, as set forth by the National Verbatim Reporters Association (NVRA). A voice writer dictates the proceedings into a stenomask connected to a computer, and using voice recognition software, voice writers are able to create realtime transcripts, which means that a transcript is being created on the spot by the voice writer. Many voice writers offer their services as CART (Communication Access Realtime Translation) providers to deaf individuals or individuals with hearing deficiencies. In addition, voice writers can work as broadcast captioners though stenographically trained reporters are preferred. Multi- channel, digital audio allows for isolated playback of channels during transcription. This allows transcribers to listen from different vantage points when playing back the audio. This multi-channel feature especially helps during moments of extraneous noise such as laughter, shouting, coughing and sneezing, but it is still deemed inferior to having a stenographic reporter during the proceedings. The American Association of Electronic Recorders and Transcribers (AAERT) certifies recorders and transcribers. AAERT certified recorders are trained to attempt to monitor the recording continuously during a proceeding and create simple notes, or a log, which are individually time-stamped. The time-stamps correspond with the location on the digital recording for playback either upon request during a proceeding or at a later time. The log notes provide any authorized person the opportunity to search and identify any segment of the proceeding they wish to review. Some courts train clerks or other court personnel to operate the digital recording equipment. While court systems benefit from the income from these systems directly, the equipment is maintained by outside vendors and staff cannot repair malfunctioning equipment even if aware of the problem. Courtroom monitors are responsible for listening to the recording through headphones while the proceeding occurs. However there is no way to ensure recording quality. == See also == * Scopist * Voice writer == References == Category:Legal professions Category:Court reporting Category:Transcription (linguistics) Category:Legal communication ","title":"Court reporter"},{"id":"305387","text":"Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder. Symptoms include right upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and occasionally fever. Often gallbladder attacks (biliary colic) precede acute cholecystitis. The pain lasts longer in cholecystitis than in a typical gallbladder attack. Without appropriate treatment, recurrent episodes of cholecystitis are common. Complications of acute cholecystitis include gallstone pancreatitis, common bile duct stones, or inflammation of the common bile duct. More than 90% of the time acute cholecystitis is from blockage of the cystic duct by a gallstone. Risk factors for gallstones include birth control pills, pregnancy, a family history of gallstones, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss. Occasionally, acute cholecystitis occurs as a result of vasculitis or chemotherapy, or during recovery from major trauma or burns. Cholecystitis is suspected based on symptoms and laboratory testing. Abdominal ultrasound is then typically used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is usually with laparoscopic gallbladder removal, within 24 hours if possible. Taking pictures of the bile ducts during the surgery is recommended. The routine use of antibiotics is controversial. They are recommended if surgery cannot occur in a timely manner or if the case is complicated. Stones in the common bile duct can be removed before surgery by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or during surgery. Complications from surgery are rare. In people unable to have surgery, gallbladder drainage may be tried. About 10‚Äì15% of adults in the developed world have gallstones. Women more commonly have stones than men and they occur more commonly after age 40. Certain ethnic groups are more often affected; for example, 48% of American Indians have gallstones. Of all people with stones, 1‚Äì4% have biliary colic each year. If untreated, about 20% of people with biliary colic develop acute cholecystitis. Once the gallbladder is removed outcomes are generally good. Without treatment, chronic cholecystitis may occur. The word is from Greek, cholecyst- meaning \\"gallbladder\\" and -itis meaning \\"inflammation\\". ==Signs and symptoms== Location of the gallbladder Most people with gallstones do not have symptoms. However, when a gallstone temporarily lodges in the cystic duct, they experience biliary colic. Biliary colic is abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant or epigastric region. It is episodic, occurring after eating greasy or fatty foods, and leads to nausea and/or vomiting.Greenberger N.J., Paumgartner G (2012). Chapter 311. Diseases of the Gallbladder and Bile Ducts. In Longo D.L., Fauci A.S., Kasper D.L., Hauser S.L., Jameson J, Loscalzo J (Eds), Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18e People who suffer from cholecystitis most commonly have symptoms of biliary colic before developing cholecystitis. The pain becomes more severe and constant in cholecystitis. Nausea is common and vomiting occurs in 75% of people with cholecystitis.Friedman L.S. (2015). Liver, Biliary Tract, & Pancreas Disorders. In Papadakis M.A., McPhee S.J., Rabow M.W. (Eds), Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment 2015 In addition to abdominal pain, right shoulder pain can be present. On physical examination, fever is common. A gallbladder with cholecystitis is almost always tender to touch. Because of the inflammation, its size can be felt from the outside of the body in 25‚Äì50% of people with cholecystitis. Pain with deep inspiration leading to termination of the breath while pressing on the right upper quadrant of the abdomen usually causes pain (Murphy's sign). Yellowing of the skin (jaundice) may occur but is often mild. Severe jaundice suggests another cause of symptoms such as choledocholithiasis. People who are old, have diabetes, chronic illness, or who are immunocompromised may have vague symptoms that may not include fever or localized tenderness. ===Complications=== A number of complications may occur from cholecystitis if not detected early or properly treated. Signs of complications include high fever, shock and jaundice. Complications include the following: * Gangrene * Gallbladder rupture * Empyema * Fistula formation and gallstone ileus *Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses  Gangrene and gallbladder rupture  Cholecystitis causes the gallbladder to become distended and firm. Distension can lead to decreased blood flow to the gallbladder, causing tissue death and eventually gangrene. Once tissue has died, the gallbladder is at greatly increased risk of rupture (perforation). Rupture can also occur in cases of chronic cholecystitis. Rupture is a rare but serious complication that leads to abscess formation or peritonitis. Massive rupture of the gallbladder has a mortality rate of 30%.  Empyema  Untreated cholecystitis can lead to worsened inflammation and infected bile that can lead to a collection of pus surrounding the gallbladder, also known as empyema. The symptoms of empyema are similar to uncomplicated cholecystitis but greater severity: high fever, severe abdominal pain, more severely elevated white blood count.  Fistula formation and gallstone ileus  The inflammation of cholecystitis can lead to adhesions between the gallbladder and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly the duodenum. These adhesions can lead to the formation of direct connections between the gallbladder and gastrointestinal tract, called fistulas. With these direct connections, gallstones can pass from the gallbladder to the intestines. Gallstones can get trapped in the gastrointestinal tract, most commonly at the connection between the small and large intestines (ileocecal valve). When a gallstone gets trapped, it can lead to an intestinal obstruction, called gallstone ileus, leading to abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation, and abdominal distension. ==Causes== Cholecystitis occurs when the gallbladder becomes inflamed. Gallstones are the most common cause of gallbladder inflammation but it can also occur due to blockage from a tumor or scarring of the bile duct. The greatest risk factor for cholecystitis is gallstones. Risk factors for gallstones include female sex, increasing age, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, obesity, diabetes mellitus, ethnicity (Native North American), rapid weight loss. === Acute calculous cholecystitis === Gallstones blocking the flow of bile account for 90% of cases of cholecystitis (acute calculous cholecystitis). Blockage of bile flow leads to thickening and buildup of bile causing an enlarged, red, and tense gallbladder. The gallbladder is initially sterile but often becomes infected by bacteria, predominantly E. coli, Klebsiella, Streptococcus, and Clostridium species. Inflammation can spread to the outer covering of the gallbladder and surrounding structures such as the diaphragm, causing referred right shoulder pain. === Acalculous cholecystitis === In acalculous cholecystitis, no stone is in the biliary ducts. It accounts for 5‚Äì10% of all cases of cholecystitis and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Acalculous cholecystitis is typically seen in people who are hospitalized and critically ill. Males are more likely to develop acute cholecystitis following surgery in the absence of trauma.Barie PS. Acalculous and postoperative cholecystitis. In: Surgical intensive care, Barie PS, Shires GT. (Eds), Little Brown & Co, Boston 1993. p.837. It is associated with many causes including vasculitis, chemotherapy, major trauma or burns. The presentation of acalculous cholecystitis is similar to calculous cholecystitis. Patients are more likely to have yellowing of the skin (jaundice) than in calculous cholecystitis. Ultrasonography or computed tomography often shows an immobile, enlarged gallbladder. Treatment involves immediate antibiotics and cholecystectomy within 24‚Äì72 hours. === Chronic cholecystitis === Chronic cholecystitis occurs after repeated episodes of acute cholecystitis and is almost always due to gallstones. Chronic cholecystitis may be asymptomatic, may present as a more severe case of acute cholecystitis, or may lead to a number of complications such as gangrene, perforation, or fistula formation. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is a rare form of chronic cholecystitis which mimics gallbladder cancer although it is not cancerous. It was first reported in the medical literature in 1976 by McCoy and colleagues. ==Mechanism== Blockage of the cystic duct by a gallstone causes a buildup of bile in the gallbladder and increased pressure within the gallbladder. Concentrated bile, pressure, and sometimes bacterial infection irritate and damage the gallbladder wall, causing inflammation and swelling of the gallbladder. Inflammation and swelling of the gallbladder can reduce normal blood flow to areas of the gallbladder, which can lead to cell death due to inadequate oxygen. == Diagnosis == The diagnosis of cholecystitis is suggested by the history (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever) and physical examinations in addition to laboratory and ultrasonographic testing. Boas's sign, which is pain in the area below the right scapula, can be a symptom of acute cholecystitis. === Blood tests === In someone suspected of having cholecystitis, blood tests are performed for markers of inflammation (e.g. complete blood count, C-reactive protein), as well as bilirubin levels in order to assess for bile duct blockage. Complete blood count typically shows an increased white blood count (12,000‚Äì15,000/mcL). C-reactive protein is usually elevated although not commonly measured in the United States. Bilirubin levels are often mildly elevated (1‚Äì4 mg/dL). If bilirubin levels are more significantly elevated, alternate or additional diagnoses should be considered such as gallstone blocking the common bile duct (common bile duct stone). Less commonly, blood aminotransferases are elevated. The degree of elevation of these laboratory values may depend on the degree of inflammation of the gallbladder. === Imaging === Right upper quadrant abdominal ultrasound is most commonly used to diagnose cholecystitis. Ultrasound findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis include gallstones, pericholecystic fluid (fluid surrounding the gallbladder), gallbladder wall thickening (wall thickness over 3 mm), dilation of the bile duct, and sonographic Murphy's sign. Given its higher sensitivity, hepatic iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan can be used if ultrasound is not diagnostic. CT scan may also be used if complications such as perforation or gangrene are suspected.

Additionally the symptoms of chronic cholecystitis are commonly vague and can be mistaken for other diseases. These alternative diagnoses include but are not limited to: * Perforated peptic ulcer * Acute pancreatitis * Liver abscess * Pneumonia * Myocardial ischemia * Hiatal hernia * Biliary colic * Choledocholithiasis * Cholangitis * Appendicitis * Colitis * Acute peptic ulcer exacerbation * Amoebic liver abscess * Acute intestinal obstruction * Kidney stone * Biliary ascariasis == Treatment == X-ray during laparoscopic cholecystectomy ===Surgery=== For most people with acute cholecystitis, the treatment of choice is surgical removal of the gallbladder, laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed using several small incisions located at various points across the abdomen. Several studies have demonstrated the superiority of laparoscopic cholecystectomy when compared to open cholecystectomy (using a large incision in the right upper abdomen under the rib cage). People undergoing laparoscopic surgery report less incisional pain postoperatively as well as having fewer long term complications and less disability following the surgery. Additionally, laparoscopic surgery is associated with a lower rate of surgical site infection. During the days prior to laparoscopic surgery, studies showed that outcomes were better following early removal of the gallbladder, preferably within the first week. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 7 days of visiting a doctor with symptoms) as compared to delayed treatment (more than 6 weeks) may result in shorter hospital stays and a decreased risk of requiring an emergency procedure. There is no difference in terms of negative outcomes including bile duct injury or conversion to open cholecystectomy. For early cholecystectomy, the most common reason for conversion to open surgery is inflammation that hides Calot's triangle. For delayed surgery, the most common reason was fibrotic adhesions. ===Other=== Radiography of a percutaneous drainage catheter (yellow arrow). In this control, the instilled radiocontrast is filling out the gallbladder (red arrow), where the filling defects are gallstones. The cystic duct (blue arrow) is tortuous, the common bile duct (green arrow) is mildly dilated but patent, with tapering at ampulla Vateri (white arrow), but without obstruction. Contrast was seen extending into the duodenum (orange arrows), demonstrating open passage through the bile ducts. Supportive measures may be instituted prior to surgery. These measures include fluid resuscitation. Intravenous opioids can be used for pain control. Antibiotics are often not needed. If used they should target enteric organisms (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae), such as E. coli and Bacteroides. This may consist of a broad spectrum antibiotic; such as piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin- sulbactam, ticarcillin-clavulanate (Timentin), a third generation cephalosporin (e.g.ceftriaxone) or a quinolone antibiotic (such as ciprofloxacin) and anaerobic bacteria coverage, such as metronidazole. For penicillin allergic people, aztreonam or a quinolone with metronidazole may be used. In cases of severe inflammation, shock, or if the person has higher risk for general anesthesia (required for cholecystectomy), an interventional radiologist may insert a percutaneous drainage catheter into the gallbladder (percutaneous cholecystostomy tube) and treat the person with antibiotics until the acute inflammation resolves. A cholecystectomy may then be warranted if the person's condition improves. Homeopathic approaches to treating cholecystitis have not been validated by evidence and should not be used in place of surgery. == Epidemiology == Cholecystitis accounts for 3‚Äì10% of cases of abdominal pain worldwide. Cholecystitis caused an estimated 651,829 emergency department visits and 389,180 hospital admissions in the US in 2012. The 2012 US mortality rate was 0.7 per 100,000 people. The frequency of cholecystitis is highest in people age 50‚Äì69 years old. ==References== ==External links== Category:Gallbladder disorders Category:Hepatology Category:Inflammations Category:IgG4-related disease Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Category:RTTEM ","title":"Cholecystitis"},{"id":"305392","text":"Undine is a category of elemental beings associated with water.

Meteor offers a multi-shot capability against long range maneuvering targets, jets, UAVs and cruise missiles in a heavy electronic countermeasures (ECM) environment with a range in excess of . A solid-fueled ramjet motor allows the missile to cruise at a speed of over Mach 4 and provides the missile with thrust and mid-way acceleration to target intercept. A two-way datalink enables the launch aircraft to provide mid- course target updates or retargeting if required, including data from off- board third parties. The datalink is capable of transmitting missile information such as functional and kinematic status, information about multiple targets, and notification of target acquisition by the seeker. Meteor missiles entered service on Swedish Air Force JAS 39 Gripens in April 2016 and officially achieved initial operating capability (IOC) in July 2016. It is also intended to equip the Eurofighter Typhoon of the Royal Air Force (RAF), Royal Saudi Air Force, Luftwaffe, Spanish Air Force, Italian Air Force and Qatar Air Force, British and Italian F-35 Lightning IIs, Dassault Rafale of the French Air Force, Indian Air Force Qatar Air Force, and Egyptian Air Force and the JAS 39 Gripen of the Brazilian Air Force. According to MBDA, Meteor has three to six times the kinetic performance of current air-air missiles of its type. The key to Meteor's performance is a throttleable ducted rocket (ramjet) manufactured by Bayern-Chemie of Germany. ==History== ===Requirement=== Meteor was selected in competition to meet the UK's Staff Requirement (Air) 1239 (SR(A)1239), for a Future Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (FMRAAM) to replace the RAF's BAe Dynamics Skyflash missiles. As the primary air-to-air armament of Eurofighter, the missile would be used against a range of fixed and rotary wing targets including Unmanned aerial vehicles and cruise missiles. Although no detailed performance requirements have been publicly released, they were understood to demand launch success and no-escape zones approaching twice that of the then \\"state-of-the-art\\" medium-range missile, AMRAAM. The missile external geometry would be constrained by the need for compatibility with Eurofighter's semi-recessed underfuselage launchers which had been designed for AMRAAM.\\"No-Escape Zone\\", Flight International, 16‚Äì22 March 1994. Key features of the requirement included \\"stealthy launch, enhanced kinematics, which will provide the missile with sufficient energy to chase and destroy a highly agile manoeuvring target, robust performance in countermeasures and the ability for the launch aircraft to fire and disengage at the earliest opportunity thus enhancing aircraft survivability\\". These requirements were largely shaped by the perceived threat posed by advanced versions of the Russian Sukhoi Su-27 \\"Flanker\\" armed with extended range ramjet powered versions of the R-77 missile. In February 1994 the UK MoD issued an RFI on the possibility of the development of an advanced medium range air-to-air missile. Four concepts were produced in response, all using integrated rocket/ramjet propulsion: *BAe, Alenia Difesa, GEC-Marconi, and Saab Dynamics, proposed the S225XR *Matra proposed a derivative of MICA, although the long-planned merger of BAe Dynamics and Matra's missile division was expected to lead to the removal of this proposal *Daimler-Benz Aerospace and Bayern-Chemie proposed the Advanced Air-to-Air Missile (A3M) *Hughes, supported by the U.S. Government, proposed an AMRAAM derivative based on upgrade work being carried out.\\"Seeing double\\", Flight International, 15 March 1995 The competition commenced formally in June 1995 against a backdrop of government and industrial contacts between the UK, France, and Germany aimed at establishing a common requirement and an industrial consortium.\\"British court Germany and France on FMRAAM project\\", Flight International, 14‚Äì20 June 1995 Even at this early stage the competition was developing into a straight fight between a European and a U.S. solution. The U.S. Government agreed to transfer development of the advanced propulsion system to the UK in support of the Hughes bid, although it was not clear how much of the workshare would be European.\\"USA offers ramjet sweetener\\", Flight International, 4‚Äì10 October 1995 Hughes' initial offering was powered by a variable-flow ducted rocket (VFDR). This had been under development by an Atlantic Research Corporation (ARC)/Alliant Techsystems team for ten years but the USAF had no plans at that time to develop an extended range AMRAAM since this could endanger support for the stealthy F-22 Raptor. The team had also provided information to BAe who were considering the VFDR as a powerplant for the S225XR, along with systems from Bayern Chemie and Volvo. ARC had discussions with Royal Ordnance, the only UK company with the necessary capability following Rolls-Royce's decision to stop work on ramjets. The UK MoD issued an Invitation to Tender (ITT) in December 1995. Responses were due in June 1996 for a UK contract valued at ¬£800m. By February 1996 the U.S. team was in place whereas the European effort remained fragmented. Matra and DASA's missile division (LFK), were on the brink of a joint bid, which BAe and Alenia were also considering.\\"Matra/DASA poised to make joint RAF missile bid\\", Flight International, 21‚Äì27 February 1996 The Matra/LFK proposal was based on Matra's MICA-Rustique project using a Matra/ONERA designed self-regulating solid fuel ramjet. The merger between BAe and Matra's missile businesses had stalled due to the French Government's reluctance to approve the deal without UK assurances that it would adopt a more pro-European approach to procurement. The merger was concluded in 1996 with the formation of Matra BAe Dynamics (MBD). This was not the only merger in prospect as DASA and A√©rospatiale were conducting due diligence, although Matra had also expressed an interest in A√©rospatiale's missile operations. The German government was trying to use the UK and German requirements to forge the consolidation of the European industry into a critical mass capable of engaging the US on more equal terms.. Hughes had assembled a team including A√©rospatiale (propulsion), Shorts (integration and final assembly), Thomson- Thorn Missile Electronics (TTME), Fokker Special Projects (fin actuation), and Diehl BGT Defence (warhead). Incidentally, the adoption of FMRAAM as the name of Hughes' proposal forced the UK MoD to change the title of SR(A)1239 to BVRAAM.. Hughes would provide the seeker, with electronics from its Scottish subsidiary, Hughes Micro Electronics Europa. The upgraded guidance electronics would be compressed compared to the existing AMRAAM. Other changes included: a new electronic, as opposed to the usual mechanical, safe and arm device, based on Diehl BGT Defence's IRIS-T system; a TTME digital target detection device (a two-way conformal microwave proximity fuze unit); and a shortened control and actuation system. The seeker and warhead were basically unchanged from AMRAAM's. The European content of Hughes' bid had been bolstered by the replacement of the ARC/ATK VFDR by an A√©rospatiale-Celerg liquid-fuel ramjet with an ARC integrated nozzleless booster. This was based on studies conducted during the Simple Regulation Ramjet programme, which began in 1994.. The direct-injection design used an inflatable elastomer bladder within the fuel tank to control the fuel flow and was believed to offer a lower cost approach compared to a regulated liquid ramjet requiring a turbopump and associated fuel supply hardware.. Eighty percent of FMRAAM production and development would be carried out in Europe, 72% in the UK.. The European team, consisting of BAe Dynamics, Matra Defense, Alenia Difesa, GEC-Marconi, Saab Dynamics, LFK, and Bayern-Chemie was finally assembled just six weeks ahead of 11 June 1996 deadline for bids.. BAe brokered an agreement whereby it would lead the team.. This tie-up avoided a division in the European attempts to provide a credible alternative to the US bid. Matra and LFK had already teamed and would have bid independently, had BAe's \\"shuttle diplomacy\\" failed. BAe Dynamics' original S225XR proposal was a wingless design. However, during the international discussions the evolving UK and German proposals were found to be near identical in concept apart from the latter's wings. The trade-off between winged and wingless configurations was very closely balanced but the wings offered increased roll damping which was believed to be useful given the asymmetric intake configuration so the German A3M configuration was adopted for the European proposal, called Meteor. When the bids went in it was anticipated that a contract would be awarded at the end of 1997 with first deliveries by 2005. ===Risk reduction=== Following several rounds of bid clarification it was concluded in early 1997 that the risks were too high to proceed directly to development. The UK's Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) and Sweden's Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) therefore launched a Project Definition and Risk Reduction (PDRR) programme. This gave the two teams twelve months in which to refine their designs, and identify and understand the risks and how they would be mitigated. PDRR contracts were placed in August 1997 with a second ITT following in October. The results of the PDRR programme were expected in March 1998 but the procurement became ensnared in the run-up to and aftermath of the UK General Election in May 1997, as the new Labour government conducted its Strategic Defence Review. By 1998 the in-service date (ISD), defined as the first unit equipped with 72 missiles, had slipped to 2007.. The UK MoD hosted a government-to-government level briefing on 14/15 July 1997 with Italy, Germany, and Sweden to discuss the BVRAAM programme and how it might meet their requirements, with the aim of pursuing a collaborative procurement.. There were issues at this time over the funding of the risk reduction contracts and some nations were discussing possible financial contributions to the studies in return for access to the data. The European team hoped that, if chosen by the UK, Meteor would also be adopted by Germany, Italy, Sweden, and France. However, Germany had now formulated an even more demanding requirement.. In response, DASA/LFK proposed a modified A3M, called Euraam, using a DASA Ulm K-band active seeker, with a passive receiver for stealthy engagements, and a redesigned Bayern Chemie propulsion system. The high energy of the high frequency radar (compared to the I-band used on AMRAAM) was claimed to provide an ability to \\"burn-through\\" most ECM and the shorter wavelength would allow the target's position to be determined more precisely allowing the use of directional warheads. At one stage DASA was pushing their government for a two-year demonstration programme which would culminate in four unguided flight tests. This was presented as a fallback position in case the UK chose Raytheon's proposal. More cynical observers regarded this as a tactic to push the UK towards Meteor. Revised BVRAAM bids were submitted on 28 May 1998, with final reports in August. The U.S. Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, wrote to his UK counterpart, George Robertson, with assurances that procurement of the Raytheon missile would not leave the UK vulnerable to US export restrictions, which could potentially handicap Eurofighter exports, a major concern highlighted by Meteor supporters.. The letter assured \\"open and complete technology transfer\\", adding that FMRAAM would be cleared for countries already cleared for AMRAAM and that a joint commission could be set up to consider release to other \\"sensitive countries\\". In July 1998 a formal statement of intent was signed between the governments of the UK, Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Spain which, subject to the UK's selection of Meteor, agreed to work towards joint procurement of the same missile. In September 1998, Raytheon supplied the UK with estimated costs for AIM-120B AMRAAMs to be fielded on Tornado and as an interim weapon on Eurofighter on initial entry into service while BVRAAM was still in development.. The US declined to sell the improved AIM-120C version. This was the first stage in Raytheon's incremental approach to fielding the full capability FMRAAM. The MoD had offered both teams the opportunity to propose alternative acquisition strategies which would have involved reaching the full capability on an incremental basis by initially providing an interim capability which could later be upgraded.. Raytheon's staged approach to meeting the full SR(A)1239 requirement offered an interim weapon with a capability between the AIM-120B AMRAAM and the FMRAAM. The Extended Range Air- to-Air Missile (ERAAM) had the FMRAAM seeker and guidance section mated to a dual-pulse solid propellant rocket motor. Raytheon estimated that ERAAM could be ready by the then Eurofighter ISD of 2004 and provided 80% of the FMRAAM capability but at only half the price. This approach played to perceived MoD budget limitations and a realisation that the main threat on which the SR(A)1239 requirement had been predicated, the advanced R-77 derivatives, did not look like entering development any time soon. An incremental approach would allow any technological advances to be incorporated into future upgrades. These could have included multi-pulse rocket motors, thrust vectoring, hybrid rockets, gel propellants, and ductless external combustion ramjets. The Meteor team had considered an interim design, also powered by a dual-pulse solid rocket motor, but decided to offer a fully compliant solution, believing that the staged approach was not cost-effective due to concerns that upgrading from one version to the next would be more complicated than Raytheon claimed. In February 1999 Raytheon added another interim level to their staged approach. The AIM-120B+ would feature the ERAAM/FMRAAM seeker and guidance section but attached to the AIM-120B solid rocket motor.. This would be ready for Eurofighter's 2004 ISD and could be updated to the ERAAM or FMRAAM configurations in 2005 and 2007 by swapping the propulsion system and updating the software. At the 1999 Paris Air Show the French Defence Minister expressed his country's interest in joining the Meteor project, putting further pressure on the UK to use BVRAAM as a focus for the consolidation of the European guided weapons industry.. The French offered to fund up to 20% of the development if Meteor won the UK contest. Inter-governmental letters of intent were exchanged between the UK and French defence ministers in advance of signing the official MoU prepared by Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the UK.. The French officially joined the programme in September 1999. In July 1999 the Swedish Air Force announced that it would not be funding development of Meteor due to a shortfall in the defence budget.. However, this decision was not expected to affect Sweden's participation in the programme, with funding being found from other sources. The political stakes were high. On 4 August 1999, US President Bill Clinton wrote to the UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair.. Clinton said that \\"I believe transatlantic defence industry cooperation is essential to ensuring the continued interoperability of Allied armed forces\\".. Blair also faced lobbying from the French President and Prime Minister, the German Chancellor, and the Spanish Prime Minister. In response, Clinton later wrote a second time to Blair, on 7 February 2000, timed to arrive before a 21 February meeting to discuss the decision. He put the case for Raytheon's bid, underlining the phrase \\"I feel strongly\\" about the decision. The direct intervention of the U.S. President emphasised the political and diplomatic significance that the BVRAAM procurement had acquired. In autumn 1999 Raytheon offered yet another twist to its staged approach with the ERAAM+.\\"ERAAM+ proposed as joint UK/US AMRAAM replacement\\", Jane's Missiles & Rockets, 1 July 1999 If chosen, the U.S. Government, in an unprecedented move, offered to merge the U.S. AMRAAM and UK BVRAAM programmes, under joint control. ERAAM+ would be adopted by both countries, equipping Eurofighter, JSF, and the F-22, allowing economies of scale from large U.S. procurement. ERAAM+ would retain the ERAAM dual-pulse motor but fitted to a front end incorporating all the features of Phase 3 of the U.S. Department of Defense's (DoD) AMRAAM Pre-Planned Product Improvement (P3I) programme, which was planned out to 2015. These included upgraded seeker hardware and software to provide improved performance against advanced threats and replacement of the longitudinally mounted electronics boards with a circular design which reduced the volume occupied by the electronics allowing space for a longer rocket motor. As equal partners the U.S. and UK would jointly specify and develop the new missile. It was estimated that ERAAM+ could be delivered for less than half the budget allocated for BVRAAM with a 2007 ISD. According to Raytheon, the programme would have initially provided the UK with 62% of development, production, and jobs for the MoD BVRAAM procurement and would give the UK 50% of the significantly larger US air-to-air market. The UK would have participated in the production of every AMRAAM-derivative sold around the world, projected at that time to be about 15000 over the following 15 years.\\"Missile market milestones\\", Jane's International Defense Review, Volume Number 33 July 2000 The ARC dual-pulse motor would not enable full compliance with the SR(A)1239 requirement, however it was believed to be adequate to counter the threats expected until 2012-15 when improvements to the warhead, datalink, and propulsion would be available. The slow pace of Russia's ramjet powered R-77 derivative, a mock-up of which had been displayed at the Paris Air Show but which had not progressed past component ground tests and for which the Russian air force had no requirement due to lack of funding,\\"BVRAAM fight sparks ramjet threat debate\\", Flight International, 4 August 1999 was offered as evidence that the full capability required by SR(A)1239 would not be necessary for some time. At a press conference to launch ERAAM+ Raytheon said that a ramjet powerplant \\"is not needed today\\". Countering Raytheon's proposed transatlantic team, Boeing was added to the European team, to provide expertise on aircraft integration, risk management, lean manufacturing technology and marketing activities in selected markets. Boeing also brought vast experience of dealing with the U.S. DoD, essential in any future attempts to get Meteor on U.S. aircraft. Although initially interested in developing a suppression of enemy air defence variant of Meteor as a successor to HARM,. Boeing has become less and less an active partner as development has progressed. In late 1999 Sweden rejoined the programme.. By early 2000 both teams had submitted best and final offers. The Government was expected to announce a decision in March, following a meeting of the MoD's Equipment Approvals Committee (EAC) on 21 February.. The decision was so politically delicate that some believed that the EAC would leave it to the Prime Minister when he chaired the defence and overseas policy committee.. Last minute intervention by the UK Treasury delayed the decision, after concerns about the cost of Meteor, believed to be the preferred solution, compared to the cheaper incremental approach offered by Raytheon.. ===Decision=== In May 2000 the UK Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, announced that Meteor had been selected to meet SR(A)1239. Fabrice Bregier, then Chief Executive Officer of MBD, said \\"This decision marks a historic milestone in the establishment of a European defence capability. For the first time, Europe will equip its fighter aircraft with a European air-to-air missile, creating interoperability and independence to export\\".\\"UK selects Meteor for Eurofighter\\", Jane's Missiles & Rockets, 24 May 2000 By this stage the In Service Date was 2008. The British House of Commons Defence Select Committee summarised the reasons behind the decision in its Tenth Report: \\"The Meteor missile has some clear advantages over its Raytheon competitor‚Äîit appears to offer the more militarily effective solution; it should help rationalise and consolidate the European missile industry, and provide future competitions with a counterweight to U.S. dominance in this field; and it entails a lower risk of constraints on Eurofighter exports. Although the programme is in its early days, it also offers the prospect of avoiding some of the problems that have plagued other European procurement collaborations, without arbitrary workshare divisions and with a clear project leadership role to be provided by the UK. The MoD needs to take advantage of that leadership role to keep momentum behind the project, including an early contract which will lock-in not just the contractor but also the commitments of our international partners. The cautious definition of the missile's target in-service date may be realistic, particularly in view of the technological challenges that will have to be overcome, but in BVRAAM's case it is a date that must be met if Eurofighter is to fulfil its potential.\\" The selection of Meteor was not a total loss for Raytheon, as the UK ordered a number of AIM-120s to arm Eurofighter on entry into service which was expected before Meteor development was complete. ===Pre-contract=== MBDA was formed in 2001, combining Matra BAe Dynamics, EADS' Aerospatiale Matra Missiles and the missile business of Alenia Marconi Systems as the second largest missile company after Raytheon. Negotiations to conclude a smart procurement contract continued. At the Paris Air Show 2001 defence ministers from France, Sweden, and the UK signed a Memorandum of Understanding committing their nations to the Meteor programme.\\"Three nations sign Meteor go-ahead\\", Jane's Missiles & Rockets, 18 July 2001 The nations of the other industrial partners, Germany, Italy, and Spain, only signalled an intention to sign within a few weeks, claiming procedural delays within their national procurement systems. Following parliamentary approval in August, Italy signed the Memorandum on 26 September 2001, for an anticipated procurement of about 400 missiles.\\"Italian air force signs up to join Meteor development\\", Flight International, 11 September 2001 Spain followed on 11 December 2001. Germany's financial contribution to the programme was considered essential but for more than two years development was hamstrung by the repeated failure of the German defence budget committee to approve funding.\\"Why we are angry with the Germans\\", The Daily Telegraph, 22 July 2002 Without the German propulsion system, MBDA deemed that Meteor could not realistically proceed. During this gap in the programme MBDA was funding Meteor from its own resources and, by June 2002, had spent around ¬£70m - most of which had gone, ironically, to Bayern-Chemie to reduce technical risk in the propulsion system, the performance of which was critical to meeting the requirements. Germany had set two conditions for participation in the project: that the UK should place a contract for the weapon; and that MBDA give a guaranteed level of performance, both of which were achieved by 30 April 2002.\\"Meteor awaits German go-ahead\\", Jane's Missiles & Rockets, 21 June 2002 It was hoped to sign an agreement at that summer's Farnborough Air Show. However Germany would not approve funding for the project until December 2002, at the same time cutting its planned acquisition from 1,488 to 600 missiles.\\"Berlin Deals Blow To Military Plans\\", Aviation Week & Space Technology, December 9, 2002 ==Description== ===Seeker=== Terminal guidance is provided by an active radar homing seeker which is a joint development between MBDA's Seeker Division and Thales Airborne Systems and builds on their co-operation on the AD4A (Active Anti-Air Seeker) family of seekers that equip the MICA and Aster missiles. The active radar seeker is manufactured by MBDA Italy.https://www.portaledifesa.it/index~phppag,3_id,2364.html ===Forebody=== The active radar proximity fuze subsystem (PFS) is provided by Saab Bofors Dynamics (SBD). The PFS detects the target and calculates the optimum time to detonate the warhead in order to achieve the maximum lethal effect.. The PFS has four antennae, arranged symmetrically around the forebody. The Impact Sensor is fitted inside the PFS. Behind the PFS is a section containing thermal batteries, provided by ASB, the AC Power Supply Unit, and the Power and Signal Distribution Unit. In August 2003 SBD received a contract worth SEK 450 million to develop the PFS. ===Warhead=== The blast-fragmentation warhead is produced by TDW. The warhead is a structural component of the missile. A Telemetry and Break-Up System (TBUS) replaces the warhead on trials missiles. ===Propulsion=== The propulsion sub-system (PSS) is a throttleable ducted rocket (TDR) with an integrated nozzleless booster, designed and manufactured by Bayern-Chemie. TDR propulsion provides a long range, a high average speed, a wide operational envelope from sea level to high altitude, a flexible mission envelope via active variable thrust control, relatively simple design, and logistics similar to those of conventional solid-fuel rocket motors. The PSS consists of four main components: a ramcombustor with integrated nozzleless booster; the air intakes; the interstage; and the sustain gas generator. The PSS forms a structural component of the missile, the gas generator and ramcombustor having steel cases. The propulsion control unit electronics are mounted in the port intake fairing, ahead of the fin actuation subsystem. The solid propellant nozzleless booster is integrated within the ramcombustor and accelerates the missile to a velocity where the TDR can take over. The reduced smoke propellant complies with STANAG 6016. The air intakes and the port covers which seal the intake diffusors from the ramcombustor remain closed during the boost phase. The intakes are manufactured from titanium. The interstage is mounted between the gas-generator and the ramcombustor and contains the Motor Safety Ignition Unit (MSIU), the booster igniter, and the gas generator control valve. The gas generator is ignited by the hot gases from the booster combustion which flow through the open control valve. The gas generator contains an oxygen deficient composite solid propellant which produces a hot, fuel-rich gas which auto-ignites in the air which has been decelerated and compressed by the intakes. The high energy boron-loaded propellant provides a roughly threefold increase in specific impulse compared to conventional solid rocket motors. The result yields a no- escape zone more than three times greater than that of the current AIM-120 AMRAAM used by Eurofighter Typhoon-equipped airforces.AirForces Monthly: 20 Year Anniversary Special - Eurofighter Typhoon, Issue Date: May/June 2014 Thrust is controlled by a valve which varies the throat area of the gas generator nozzle. Reducing the throat area increases the pressure in the gas generator which increases the propellant burn rate, increasing the fuel mass flow into the ramcombustor. The mass flow can be varied continuously over a ratio greater than 10:1. ===Control=== The missile trajectory is controlled aerodynamically using four rear-mounted fins. Meteor's control principles are intended to allow high turn rates while maintaining intake and propulsion performance. The fin actuation subsystem (FAS) was originally designed and manufactured by the Claverham Group, a UK, based division of the U.S. company Hamilton Sundstrand. Currently the design has been taken on board by the MBDA UK, at Stevenage. The FAS is mounted at the rear of the intake fairings. The design of the FAS is complicated by the linkages required between the actuator in the fairing and the body-mounted fins. ===Datalink=== Meteor will be 'network-enabled'. A datalink will allow the launch aircraft to provide mid- course target updates or retargeting if required, including data from offboard third parties. The datalink electronics are mounted in the starboard intake fairing, ahead of the FAS. The antenna is mounted in the rear of the fairing. On 19 November 1996 Bayern-Chemie completed the latest in a series of tests designed to assess the attenuation of signals by the boron rich exhaust plume of the TDR, a concern highlighted by opponents of this form of ramjet propulsion. Tests were conducted with signals transmitted through the plume at various angles. The initial results suggested that the attenuation was much less than expected.. The Eurofighter and Gripen, with two-way datalinks, allow the launch platform to provide updates on targets or re-targeting when the missile is in flight. The datalink is capable of transmitting information such as kinematic status. It also notifies target acquisition by the seeker.. ===Support=== The Integrated Logistics Support concept proposed for Meteor does away with line maintenance. The missiles will be stored in dedicated containers when not in use. If the Built-In Test equipment detects a fault the missile will be returned to MBDA for repair. The Meteor is intended to have an airborne carriage life of 1,000 hours before any maintenance is required.. ==Orders== Full-scale development and production of Meteor began in 2003 with the signature of a ¬£1.2 billion contract by the UK on behalf of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK. The percentage share of the programme allocated to each partner nation has changed several times over the years. Germany's decision to reduce its intended acquisition resulted in the UK taking 5% of the programme from Germany, giving the UK 39.6% and Germany 16%. France is funding 12.4%, Italy 12%, and Sweden and Spain 10% each. An Integrated Project Team (IPT) was established at MoD Abbey Wood with representatives from all partner nations seconded to the team. The programme will be managed by the UK MoD through the IPT on behalf of the partner nations. The IJPO report to the UK Chief of Defence Procurement, the Executive Board of the DPA, and to an International Steering Committee comprising a one or two star representative from each partner nation's air force. The prime- contractor, MBDA, will manage and execute the programme through its operating companies in France, Italy, and the UK, working with Bayern-Chemie/Protac in Germany, Inmize Sistemas SL in Spain, and Saab Bofors Dynamics in Sweden. It is estimated that over 250 companies across Europe will be involved. Work will be allocated by MBDA to its risk-sharing partners on an \\"earned value basis\\" under which work is placed according to best commercial value, taking into account technical excellence, but with a view to aligning \\"broadly\\" with the share of development funding provided by each nation. The development programme will make large use of computer simulation and so should require a relatively small number of firings, some of which will cover activities more traditionally associated with aircraft-integration trials. The first firing, from Gripen, was expected in 2005 with an in service date of August 2012. In December 2009 the Spanish government authorized the procurement of 100 Meteor missiles and their corresponding support equipment. In September 2010 the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration, signed a production order contract with the MoD for the Meteor missile; the system is expected to be operational with the Swedish Air Force in 2015.. In May 2015, Qatar ordered 160 Meteor missiles to equip the Dassault Rafales of the Qatar Emiri Air Force. Egypt also bought a large batch of those missiles in the framework of the Rafale. ===Key milestones=== The UK MoD stipulated four \\"tightly defined\\" contractual milestones that had to be met otherwise the programme would be cancelled with MBDA expected to repay the development funding:. # To demonstrate successful transition from boost to sustain propulsion. # To demonstrate control of the asymmetric airframe. There was concern that the intake air flow would be disrupted during manoeuvres resulting in a loss of propulsion performance or even control. The asymmetric configuration also poses unique control problems. Achievement of this milestone was to be demonstrated using computer models validated from the Air Launched Demonstrator (ALD) trials results. # To demonstrate transfer alignment of the missile's inertial measurement system. This process ensures that the missile knows where it is at launch. Good knowledge of initial position is essential to accurate navigation, particularly for long range engagements. # This milestone relates to Meteor's electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) capability. This is highly classified work to be conducted in MBDA's hardware-in-the-loop laboratory at Rome.. Achievement of these milestones will be evaluated by QinetiQ acting as an independent auditor. ===Development=== At the 2003 Paris Air Show MBDA signed a contract with Bayern-Chemie/Protac worth in excess of EUR250m, for development, first lot production, and integrated logistics for the Meteor PSS. Also at the show, MBDA and Thales formalised their agreement of June 2002 by signing a contract for EUR46m covering development and initial production of seekers for the RAF's missiles.. Over the eight months following contract signature, MBDA had determined the definitive external shape of Meteor. By the summer of 2003 manufacture had commenced of a full-scale model for aircraft fit checks as well as sub-scale models for wind tunnel tests scheduled for the autumn.. The mid-mounted wings which had featured in the originally proposed configuration were removed. Following extensive pre-contract wind tunnel testing and MBDA's growing experience with guidance and control technologies for wingless configurations, such as ASRAAM, a wingless design was believed to offer the best solution to meeting the performance requirements. The control fins were also redesigned so that all four fins were now identical. In October 2003 the first trial fit of a geometrically representative model was carried out on Eurofighter.. Checks were successfully carried out on the underfuselage semi-recessed, long-stroke Missile Eject Launchers and the underwing pylon- mounted rail-launchers. In November 2003 Saab Aerosystems received an order worth 435m Swedish Kronor from the FMV for the integration of Meteor onto Gripen. As prime contractor for the integration task Saab Aerosystems will be supported by Ericsson Microwave Systems, Saab Bofors Dynamics, and MBDA (UK). In December 2003 MBDA and Saab Bofors Dynamics signed an enabling contract worth 485m kronor covering programme management, system level participation, participation in the development of seeker, guidance, and autopilot algorithms, development of missile software, development of test equipment, system proving activities, and the TBUS. In April 2004 MBDA carried out fit checks on a Gripen at Saab's Link√∂ping facility.. This demonstrated the mechanical interfaces between the missile, the Multi-Missile Launcher (MML) and the aircraft. Wind tunnel tests had recently been completed at BAE Systems' facility at Warton, UK, and at ONERA in Modane, France. These tests successfully demonstrated the air intake operation and validated the modelled aerodynamic characteristics, confirming the configuration for the first flight trials. In August 2004 Bayern-Chemie delivered the first inert PSS, to be used for structural testing, amongst other things.. By the summer of 2005 two inert missiles had been delivered to Modane to recommission the facility following major modifications intended to prepare it for the free-jet trials. These were planned to begin with a 'part-firing' before the French summer holidays to be followed by two full-scale firings later in the year. These would comprise a full end-to-end demonstration of the complete propulsion system at representative supersonic free flight conditions as a risk reduction exercise for the ALD firings, scheduled for the last quarter of 2005. During these tests a full-scale missile model fitted with a live PSS would be mounted on a moveable strut in the wind tunnel, allowing a series of incidence and sideslip manoeuvres to be conducted over the full duration of the PSS operation. The tests would demonstrate operation of the air intakes, the transition from boost to sustain propulsion, control of the sustain motor thrust, and provide data on the aerodynamic characteristics. On 9 September 2005 the first flight of Meteor on board a French Navy F2 standard Rafale M was successfully carried out from Istres, France. This was in preparation for a week-long series of trials from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle which commenced on 11 December 2005. Tests were carried out with two Ground Handling Training Missiles (GHTM) and an Environmental Data Gathering (EDG) missile fitted alternatively on an underwing rail-launcher or underfuselage eject launchers. The EDG is an instrumented missile representing all the dynamic properties of an operational missile in terms of size, weight, and aerodynamic shape. The trials were designed to measure the shock and vibration levels associated with the severe carrier operational environment. Around twenty catapult launches and full deck arrests were undertaken, along with a number of touch and go landings on the fightdeck to provide a fully comprehensive handling test of the aircraft while fitted with Meteor. The trials went so well that they were concluded a day earlier than planned.Rafale flies Meteor trials from Charles de Gaulle\\", Jane's Missiles & Rockets 2005 On 13 December a separate campaign commenced in Sweden with flights of the Meteor avionics missile (GMA5) carried on the port wing outboard station of Gripen aircraft 39.101, which had been modified with Meteor-unique software. As with the EDG missile GMA5 represents all the dynamic properties of an operational missile but also interfaces electrically with the launch aircraft. These trials successfully verified mechanical, electrical, and functional interfaces between the missile and aircraft. This was the first in-flight trial of two- way communication between the missile and aircraft and was an important step in clearing the aircraft and missile for the ALD firings which had slipped into Spring 2006, due to the lack of winter daylight hours at the Vidsel Test Range in northern Sweden. In a separate air-carry trial a Eurofighter of No. 17 (R) squadron RAF flew with two GHTMs on the forward underfuselage stations to assess how the aircraft handled during a series of manoeuvres. On 21 January 2006 a range work-up was conducted at Vidsel, again with GMA5 mounted on 39.101. This successfully verified system communications and set-up between the aircraft and the test range in advance of the first firing. The first ALD firing took place on 9 May 2006 from a JAS 39 Gripen flying at an altitude of 7,000 m. The missile was launched from the port underwing MML, separating safely from the launch aircraft as the integrated booster accelerated the missile to over Mach 2.0 in around two seconds.\\"Meteor fizzles, then burns\\", Aviation Week & Space Technology, 26 June 06 However, after a successful boost the missile failed to transition to the sustain phase of flight. The missile continued under boost impulse, gradually decelerating until broken up, on command from the ground. Despite this problem telemetry was gathered throughout the full duration of the flight. The missile debris was recovered and the air intakes were found to be still closed. The problem was traced to a timing issue in the gas generator valve control unit software, which was developed by a Bayern-Chemie subcontractor. Following modification a repeat of the first trial took place on 20 May 2006 and was a complete success. During the sustain phase the missile carried out a series of pre-programmed manoeuvres, under autopilot control, representative of the mid-course and endgame phases of an engagement. The flight lasted just under a minute and ended again with the successful operation of the break-up system which destroyed the missile within the range boundary. The first trial of a flight standard functional seeker was carried out on 30 June 2006.. The Seeker Data Gathering (SDG) missile was carried under the wing of Gripen. The SDG missile has no propulsion system or warhead but contains operational missile subsystems and telemetry systems. The flight lasted approximately 1.5 hours, allowing data to be gathered over a variety of different flight conditions. These data will be used in support of the third Key Milestone. This marked the start of a two-year seeker development programme which will conclude with the first guided firing, currently scheduled for 2008 from Gripen.. This programme will gather clutter data and demonstrate capabilities such as transfer alignment and target tracking in clear air and in the presence of ECM. On 5 September 2006 the third and final ALD firing was successfully conducted. The launch conditions were the same as the first two firings but the missile flew a different flight profile. The UK NAO Major Projects Report 2006 reported a 12-month delay in the Meteor programme, pushing the expected in service date back to August 2013.The Chief of Defence Procurement was reported as saying that this was nothing to do with the missile itself, \\"Meteor is actually going very well.\\". and the lack of Eurofighter aircraft for the integration work was the main reason for the slip. The Minister of Defence Procurement, Lord Drayson, said \\"I regard this as a Eurofighter Gmbh problem.\\" It was reported that this delay could lead to the RAF operating AMRAAM to a point where stocks of airworthy missiles become low. On 28 April 2015, French Ministry Of Defense, Dassault Aviation and MBDA proceeded with the first guided launch of a Meteor from the Dassault Rafale against an aerial target. The test, performed by a Rafale flying from the DGA Essais en Vol site of Cazaux, was successfully completed in a zone of the DGA Essais de Missiles site of Biscarrosse. On 21 April 2017, the UK government signed a ¬£41 million contract with MBDA to integrate Meteor on Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons and the F-35B Lightning IIs. On 10 December 2018, RAF Typhoons flew their first active mission with Meteor missiles. ===Future=== MBDA is planning integration of Meteor on the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II F-35 by 2024 for the UK and Italian Air Forces. The Meteor has already been checked for fit in the internal weapons bays of the JSF. It is compatible with the aircraft's internal air-to-ground stations, but requires a different fin shape to be compatible with the air-to-air stations that will be fitted as a 'role change kit'. It is rumoured that the U.S. Navy may require a Meteor-class missile to replace the capability lost with the retirement of the AIM-54 Phoenix in 2004. A possible solution may be a ram-powered AMRAAM (ERAAM) carried by the F-18E/F Super Hornet. India has made a request for information about integrating Meteor on their Sukhoi Su-30MKI fleet. ;Joint New Air-to-Air Missile On 17 July 2014, MBDA UK agreed to jointly research a Meteor-derived missile with Japan. A spokesman from the Ministry of Defense (Japan) confirmed on 14 January 2016 that, Japan and the United Kingdom will develop a Joint New Air- to-Air Missile (JNAAM) by \\"combining the UK's missile-related technologies and Japanese seeker technologies\\". The active electronically scanned array seeker of the Mitsubishi Electric AAM-4B would be mounted on the Meteor, because the AAM-4B is too large to be carried in the Japanese F-35 weapons bay. According to the Japanese Ministry of Defense, the seeker will be made of Gallium Nitride modules to reconcile both miniaturization and performance enhancement and planned to carry out the first launch test with a British fighter jet by 2023.2018 Policy evaluation overview for the Research on Future Medium-Range Air-to-Air Guided Missile(Japanese) Japanese Ministry of Defense.

La Mancha is an arid but fertile plateau (610 m or 2000 ft.) that stretches from the mountains of Toledo to the western spurs of the hills of Cuenca, and bordered to the south by the Sierra Morena and to the north by the Alcarria region. La Mancha includes portions of the modern provinces of Cuenca, Toledo, and Albacete, and most of the Ciudad Real province. La Mancha historical comarca constitutes the southern portion of Castilla-La Mancha autonomous community and makes up most of the present-day administrative region. ==Name== The name \\"La Mancha\\" is probably derived from the Arabic word ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿ¥ÿ£ al-mansha, meaning \\"birthplace\\" or \\"fountainhead\\". The name of the city of Almansa in Albacete also has the same origin.Castilla-La Mancha The word mancha in Spanish literally means spot, stain, or patch, but no apparent link exists between this word and the name of the region. ==Geography== Pastures and sheep in La Mancha The largest plain in Spain, La Mancha is made up of a plateau averaging 500 to 600 metres in altitude (although it reaches 900 metres in Campo de Montiel and other parts), centering on the province of Ciudad Real. The region is watered by the Guadiana, Jabal√≥n, Z√°ncara, Cig√ºela, and J√∫car rivers. Landscape of the fields in La Mancha ==Climate== The climate is cold semi-arid (K√∂ppen BSk), with strong fluctuations. Farming (wheat, barley, oats, sugar beets, wine grapes, olives) and cattle raising are the primary economic activities, but they are severely restricted by the harsh environmental conditions. ==Culture== The 250px Culturally, La Mancha includes the Sierra de Alcaraz, northern Sierra Morena, Montes de Toledo and Serran√≠a de Cuenca, parts of Tajo river valley, and it is administratively divided among the comarcas of Campo de Montiel and Campo de ras de Oca√±a y Manchuela to the north. The inhabitants are called Manchegos. ==Agriculture== La Mancha has always been an important agricultural zone. Viticulture is important in Tomelloso, Alc√°zar de San Juan, Socu√©llamos, Valdepe√±as, La Solana and Manzanares, in Ciudad Real and Villarrobledo in Albacete. Other crops include cereals (hence the famous windmills) and saffron. Sheep are raised and bred, providing the famous Manchego cheese, as are goats, including the La Mancha goat, one of the assumed progenitors of the American La Mancha goat. La Mancha includes two National Parks, Las Tablas de Daimiel and Caba√±eros, and one Natural Park, Las Lagunas de Ruidera. ==People== Famous Spaniards like the cinema directors Pedro Almod√≥var and Jos√© Luis Cuerda, painters Antonio L√≥pez and his uncle Antonio L√≥pez Torres, footballer Andr√©s Iniesta, music band Angelus Apatrida and actress Sara Montiel were born in La Mancha. ==La Mancha and Cervantes== Don Quixote statue at La Mancha Inn, Spain Alcal√° del J√∫car, La Mancha Miguel de Cervantes described La Mancha and its windmills in his two-part 1605/1615 novel Don Quixote de La Mancha. Cervantes was making fun of the region, using a pun; a \\"mancha\\" was also a stain, as on one's honor, and thus an inappropriately-named homeland for a dignified knight-errant.A Noise Within Translator John Ormsby believed that Cervantes chose it because it was the most ordinary, prosaic, anti-romantic, and therefore unlikely place from which a chivalrous, romantic hero could originate, making Quixote seem even more absurd. However, due to the fame of Cervantes' character, the name of La Mancha did become associated worldwide with romantic chivalry. Several film versions of Don Quixote have been filmed largely in La Mancha. However, some, including the 1957 Russian film version, and the screen version of Man of La Mancha, were not. The 1957 film was shot in Crimea, while Man of La Mancha was filmed in Italy. G.W. Pabst's 1933 version of Cervantes's novel was shot in Alpes-de-Haute-Provence. The 2000 made-for-TV Don Quixote, starring John Lithgow as Don Quixote and Bob Hoskins as Sancho Panza, was shot on several locations in Spain, but not in La Mancha. ==See also== *Manchuela (\\"lesser La Mancha\\"), a comarca in La Mancha. *La Mancha (DO), a Spanish Denominaci√≥n de Origen (DO) for wines. *Manche, a coastal department in Normandy, France. *The English Channel, known in Spanish as Canal de la Mancha. ==References== ==External links== * *Folk music from La Mancha Category:Castilla‚ÄìLa Mancha Category:Geography of Castilla‚ÄìLa Mancha Category:Historical regions in Spain Category:Natural regions Category:Comarcas of Castilla‚ÄìLa Mancha ","title":"La Mancha"},{"id":"305404","text":"is a video game character and the chief protagonist of Nintendo's Star Fox series. He is an anthropomorphic fox created and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takaya Imamura. In each game, to varying extents, the player controls Fox in his Arwing. He is the leader of the Star Fox team, and is joined by his wingmates on various missions. ==Concept and design== A fox holding a key in its mouth, at the main gate of the Fushimi Inari shrine In 1992, Nintendo and Argonaut Software collaborated to produce a 3D space shooter for the Super NES, provisionally titled 'SnesGlider'. The development team, led by Shigeru Miyamoto, redesigned what had been a tech demo into a rail shooter, with Nintendo designing the game and Argonaut handling the programming aspects. However, without a story, it lacked any incentive to play beyond flying and shooting. Miyamoto sketched out a universe, but could not decide on a natural hero to convey a sense of an epic space saga. Names under consideration included \\"Star Wolf\\", \\"Star Sheep\\", \\"Star Fox\\", \\"Star Sparrow\\", and \\"Star Hawk\\". Miyamoto finally settled on having a fox as the main character after visiting Fushimi Inari-taisha in Kyoto, the head shrine of Inari, a Japanese kami associated with foxes. Inari is portrayed as being able to fly, and its shrines, particularly the one in Kyoto, are surrounded by red arches (torii), giving Miyamoto the idea of a fox that could fly through arches. Fox's face was modeled after Inari's, and usually wears a \\"red turtleneck\\" or \\"red scarf\\" around his neck, like the statue. Fox McCloud's personality is heavily based on Shigeru Miyamoto's own personality, with the surname 'McCloud' being suggested by Dylan Cuthbert, one of Argonaut's programmers. Cuthbert stated on a Reddit Ask me Anything that the name is a reference to Connor MacLeod of Highlander with a different \\"spacey\\" spelling used. Fox McCloud is an anthropomorphic fox with orange-brown fur, with golden-brown or white highlights. He has a stereotypical bushy white-tipped tail which appears to be very short in Star Fox 64 and Command. His eyes are inconsistently shown to be either green or blue. He will occasionally wear large tanker boots over his legs when fighting on the ground. Fox's outfit has changed in every game he appears in, but generally includes an orange or green jumpsuit under a pale gray flight jacket or combat vest and a headset. In Star Fox 64, if the game is played in expert mode, Fox wears a pair of sunglasses similar to what his father wore. Nintendo has never officially cited Fox's age or height in a game manual, however, Nintendo Power released a card featuring Fox, which stated that during Star Fox 64 he is 18 years old, his height is 1.73 SM and his weight is 70.31 SK. The SNES Star Fox soundtrack booklet stated that Fox's height is and his weight is .Profile page of soundtrack from game-ost, Page with data on Star Fox Crew . Fox would be 26 in Adventures (as Adventures takes place just 8 years after the events of Star Fox 64), 27 in Assault (the game manual stated 1 year had passed since the conclusion of Adventures), and 29 to 30 in Command. Unlike the consistency with other Nintendo characters, such as Mario, several different individuals have voiced Fox. He was first voiced by Daniel Owsen in Star Fox, in both the English and Japanese versions of the game. His most consistent English voice actor has been Mike West, who first portrayed the character in the localized release of Star Fox 64. After a hiatus of fourteen years, West reprised the role for Star Fox 64 3D. He has since then consistently voiced Fox, supplying the character with his voice for Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Star Fox Zero, Starlink: Battle for Atlas, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In both the Japanese release of Star Fox 64 and Super Smash Bros., Fox was voiced by Shinobu Satouchi (speaking in English with a Japanese accent for the English version). For English dialogue of Super Smash Bros. Melee and Star Fox Adventures, Fox's voice was done by Rare's Steve Malpass. In Star Fox: Assault, his voice was done by Jim Walker in the English release, and by Kenji Nojima in the Japanese release. Nojima reprised his role for Super Smash Bros. Brawl, as did Walker for the English version. Nojima reprised his role once again in the Japanese version of Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. In Star Fox 64 3D, Star Fox Zero, Starlink: Battle for Atlas, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, he is voiced by Takashi ≈åhara in Japanese. There is a fan theory stating that Fox McCloud, along with other Star Fox members, had his legs amputated and replaced with metal prostheses; Cuthbert stated that the characters' legs were not amputated,Exchange on Twitter: In response to: @dylancuthbert dunno anyone asked, but do you know if the Starfox crew had robotic legs or were they hi- tech boots? - Cuthbert: High tech boots - it‚Äôd be a bit weird to say the least if they all had no legs :) In response to: Sorcerer Lance: it's been a long-standing fan theory seeing the old puppets & art they had their legs amputated to reduce blood flow to withstand g-forces , Cuthbert: Lol that‚Äôs pretty hard core for Nintendo :) - This is Dylan Cuthbert's official Twitter account.

May 24, 2016: Starts at 2:45 - Cuthbert is being livestreamed playing the game and is directly answering that the legs have not been amputated. and Miyamoto stated that the appearance of metal legs was a design choice rather than an indication that the legs were amputated; (exchange begins at 7:54) - Miyamoto chooses the answer that this is a design choice, and his translator explains this in English. he wanted the character to appear more human, and was unaware of the issues faced by fighter pilots at the time. (exchange begins at 7:08) ==Appearances== ===Star Fox=== The Star Fox franchise has generally treated both the games and certain tie-in media as canonical. However, the Star Fox franchise has been rebooted twice: Star Fox 64 was a reboot of the original Star Fox, and Star Fox Zero is a reboot of Star Fox 64. The first reboot in particular changed Fox's personality and backstory substantially, including the name of his father. Game continuity In the main game continuity roughly from Star Fox 64 to Star Fox Command, Fox is notably self-centered. He is less motivated by any desire to resist tyranny, and more by revenge against Andross and money. In Star Fox Adventures he was constantly grumbling about not being paid enough for what he was being asked to do and made references to only caring about the inevitable pay-off. He frequently rolled his eyes or sighed when he found out that he was being asked to do even more work, or when a conversation with a character simply went on too long. Fox becomes infatuated with Krystal when he first saw her trapped on top of Krazoa Palace in Star Fox Adventures. He is romantically involved with Krystal after the events of Star Fox Adventures, confirming that they love each other when speaking with Lucy about his relationship with Krystal. During Command Krystal soon leaves after Fox asked her to leave because he feared for her safety. Star Fox Command has several different endings in which they either get back together or split apart completely. Fox is known for being professional, cocky, and shy, expressing each trait in different circumstances. His professional side is shown when he is in serious situations especially in his Arwing, this is most notable side to Fox shown in all Star Fox games. Fox's cocky side was more notable than his professional side in Star Fox Adventures, where he acted more like a teenager than compared to an adult, showing low enthusiasm when taking on difficult situations and showing a habit of grasping the back of his neck with his hand when he was put on the spot. Fox's shy side is only expressed when he is around Krystal, who flirts with him frequently. His reactions are shown as him blushing, temperature rising, and constant stuttering. In Star Fox 64, Fox McCloud's friendship with Bill Grey is depicted during the game, and he fights Wolf O'Donnell of the rival Star Wolf team. The Black Hole of the SNES game is absent, instead, James McCloud is presumed to have died at the hands of Andross himself. Once Star Fox reaches Venom, they fight through its defensive lines or Star Wolf to Andross's base, depending on which route the player takes. Despite the protests of his team, Fox faces Andross alone. If the player has chosen the hard route, Fox's father James appears to lead his son to safety when Andross's base explodes, disappearing when Fox escapes. Whether this was living James, a ghost or a figment of Fox's imagination is yet to be seen. Fox then leaves victorious as Andross's base explodes behind him. Back on Corneria, General Pepper offers to integrate them into the Cornerian army. Fox declines, saying that they prefer doing things their own way. An action figure of Fox McCloud armed with a missile launcher was produced to accompany the game, but never got beyond the prototype stage. In Star Fox Adventures, a Nintendo GameCube game set eight years after Star Fox 64, Fox McCloud is hired to stop Dinosaur Planet from breaking apart. Fox rescues Prince Tricky, a young dinosaur of the EarthWalker tribe, from the Sharpclaw tribe. The villain of the game, General Scales, plans to conquer the planet piece by piece. The two find four Spell Stones, magical objects that hold the planet together, returning them to their rightful positions, and free Krystal, an imprisoned vixen, in which Fox and Krystal fall in love with a result in Krystal joining the team at the end of the game. Fox then defeats a resurrected Andross, who was the real villain behind the troubles on Dinosaur Planet. McCloud then returns to the Great Fox, and General Pepper pays him for saving the planet. Falco Lombardi, who had been absent for the majority of the game, is reunited with the team. Star Fox Adventures was originally intended for release on the Nintendo 64 as Dinosaur Planet, an action adventure starring Krystal and a fox character named Sabre. Created by developers Rare, the game was essentially complete, and was ready for release in the fourth quarter of 2000. The game was shown off at the E3 video game trade show in May that year, but cancelled shortly afterwards. Nintendo had noticed the similarity between Fox McCloud and Sabre, and decided to convert the game into Star Fox Adventures. In an interview with IGN at the 2000 E3, Shigeru Miyamoto commented on the similarity between the two characters, jokingly suggesting he should call the development team about it. In Star Fox: Assault, another GameCube game set after Star Fox Adventures, Fox and his team are hired to defeat Andrew Oikonny, Andross's nephew and ex-Star Wolf member, who has started a rebellion against Corneria with the remnants of Andross's forces. The team confronts Oikonny on the planet Fortuna, where the flagship is shot down by a creature known as an Aparoid; strange, bug-like organisms with the ability to assimilate objects, both living and nonliving. On planet Katina, Fox confronts Pigma Dengar, who sent out an S.O.S. signal to lure them and steals the core memory of a defeated Aparoid, which the team needs in order to locate the homeworld of the race and destroy the Aparoid Queen; the Aparoid leader. Star Fox then encounters and gets into a brief skirmish with the Star Wolf team while searching for Pigma. After defeating Pigma, the stolen core memory is obtained. After freeing Dinosaur Planet, now called Sauria, from the Aparoids, Fox then learns that Corneria has been heavily assaulted by the enemy. But, to the amazement of the Star Fox team, Star Wolf arrive on the scene and destroy the Aparoid army. Fox finally reaches Aparoid world, where the Queen is destroyed along with the home planet itself, once again with help from Star Wolf. Once again, the Lylat System falls under peril in Star Fox Command, this time under attack by a new foe known as the Anglars, who originated from Venom's acidic oceans. It is up to Fox McCloud to save the galaxy once more by slowly liberating invaded territory and arriving at Venom to defeat the Anglar Emperor. This time, he begins the battle with only ROB 64 at his side, as the team has been disbanded for various reasons. Along the way, other characters will join Fox and the team becomes whole again. As Command has nine different outcomes, it is uncertain which is the true path Fox and crew take, and even whether or not Command is even canon to the series. Despite this, the developers have suggested that any sequel might ignore the endings and instead pick up the story from the middle. Fox's vehicle is called the Arwing II, which boasts a decent amount of health and boost, and can either receive plasma blasters or twin lasers, depending on the storyline. In this game, Takaya Imamura gave Fox a cartoonish appearance, compared to the more realistic look of Star Fox Adventures and Star Fox: Assault. According to Imamura, realistic fur was unpopular with players. Nintendo Power comic continuity In the 1993 Nintendo Power Star Fox comic based on the SNES game, Fox McCloud is also known as Fox Jr. or Junior and was revealed to be the son of the best pilot on the planet Corneria: Fox McCloud Sr. (later renamed James McCloud). Fox was also becoming an excellent pilot. He met Falco Lombardi, a rowdy but street- savvy bird who wanted to become a pilot. Fox helped Falco clean up his act, and Falco went on to become both a pilot and one of Fox's closest friends. Fox Senior volunteered to test a new gravity bomb Andross had made, and was lost and presumed dead when the bomb detonated with a far greater effect than anyone expected. Andross was exiled from the star system, but returned and built a power base on the planet Venom. Fox protested this turn of events, but the leaders on Corneria, terrified by Andross' power, exiled Fox to the planet Papetoon, which was later taken by Andross. On Papetoon, Fox was shown early on to be a skillful and hotheaded combatant, and to have a strong desire to resist tyranny. He cared little for money, preferring to liquidate anything taken during a raid to support the oppressed peoples he fought for. Eventually, Corneria contacted Fox to pilot their newest space fighter, the Arwing, which could only be effectively used by the best pilots in the system. After rescuing Fara Phoenix from Venomian military forces, Fox develops a romantic relationship with her, and they hold mutual affections for each other throughout the comics. ===Super Smash Bros.=== Fox McCloud has appeared in all five Super Smash Bros. games as a default playable character. In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, he is light, has the third-fastest dashing speed in the game, surpassed only by Captain Falcon and Sonic the Hedgehog, and has fairly weak attacks that allow for a number of combos. His attacks include a blaster, a dash attack, a hexagonal reflector (informally called the \\"shine\\"), the \\"Fire Fox\\" attack, and the Landmaster Tank as a \\"Final Smash\\". Falco Lombardi and Wolf O'Donnell, also from the Star Fox series, have similar movesets. In competitive Super Smash Bros. Melee, Fox is considered to be the character with the most potential and is utilized by numerous top players, such as Adam \\"Armada\\" Lindgren and Joseph \\"Mango\\" Marquez, although his fast movements make him very difficult to control without practice. Fox also re-appears alongside the rest of the Super Smash Bros. cast in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and is based on his Star Fox Zero design. Fox also has a new Final Smash that makes use of the Arwing vehicle. ===Cameos=== Fox has small cameos in other games, notably Stunt Race FX, where a portrait of him can be found in track-side billboards. Additionally, in one of the tracks, an Arwing will occasionally fly overhead. In F-Zero X and GX, a character named James McCloud is a playable racer, bearing the name of Fox's father. He has a similar appearance to Fox, with his hair looking like ears, and wears sunglasses as well. Fox's uniform appears as a clothing option in the Wii U version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 for some characters. He also makes a playable appearance in the Nintendo Switch version of Starlink: Battle for Atlas. ==Reception== Since the release of the original Star Fox, Fox McCloud has gained a cult following. Nintendo Power listed Fox as their 18th favorite hero, stating that while some of his games weren't the best, he has a long list of accomplishments. Early in the Nintendo 64's lifespan, Fox McCloud ranked fifth in IGN's top five best Nintendo 64 character list. He was included in GameSpot's \\"All Time Greatest Video Game Hero\\" contest and reached the \\"Round 2\\" before losing to Link. GameDaily named Fox McCloud as the seventh top Nintendo character of all time. IGN praised Fox's appearance in Super Smash Bros. Melee, saying that he featured some of the best texture work and modeling in the game. In their preview of Star Fox: Assault, IGN editors Juan Castro and Matt Casamassina described Fox's voice as juvenile yet tough. Fox ranked eighth on GameDaily's Top 10 Smash Bros. characters list. In an IGN poll for voting from a list of ten Nintendo characters for favorite Nintendo character of all time, Fox came in fourth, behind Link, Mario, and Samus respectively. Entertainment Weekly elected Fox the twelfth coolest videogame character, adding he is a combination of \\"the heroism of Luke Skywalker, the bravado of Top Gun's Maverick, and the foxiness of, well, a red fox\\". In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 30th best hero in video games. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Animal characters in video games Category:Anthropomorphic characters in video games Category:Anthropomorphic foxes Category:Characters created by Shigeru Miyamoto Category:Extraterrestrial characters in video games Category:Fictional aviators Category:Male characters in video games Category:Fictional mercenaries in video games Category:Fictional military personnel in video games Category:Nintendo protagonists Category:Orphan characters in video games Category:Star Fox characters Category:Super Smash Bros. fighters Category:Video game characters introduced in 1993 Category:Video game characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Video game mascots Category:Fictional foxes ","title":"Fox McCloud"},{"id":"305405","text":" IUGS classification of aphanitic extrusive igneous rocks to their relative alkali (Na2O + K2O) and silica (SiO2) weight contents. Blue area is roughly where alkaline rocks plot; yellow area where subalkaline rocks plot. Original source: * (ed.); 1989: A classification of igneous rocks and glossary of terms, Blackwell Science, Oxford. A volcanic rock from Italy with a relatively large six-sided phenocryst (diameter about 1 mm) surrounded by a fine-grained groundmass, as seen in thin section under a petrographic microscope Extrusive rock refers to the mode of igneous volcanic rock formation in which hot magma from inside the Earth flows out (extrudes) onto the surface as lava or explodes violently into the atmosphere to fall back as pyroclastics or tuff. In contrast, intrusive rock refers to rocks formed by magma which cools below the surface.Jain, Sreepat (2014). Fundamentals of Physical Geology. New Delhi, India: Springer. . The main effect of extrusion is that the magma can cool much more quickly in the open air or under seawater, and there is little time for the growth of crystals. Sometimes, a residual portion of the matrix fails to crystallize at all, instead becoming a natural glass or obsidian. If the magma contains abundant volatile components which are released as free gas, then it may cool with large or small vesicles (bubble-shaped cavities) such as in pumice, scoria, or vesicular basalt. Other examples of extrusive rocks are rhyolite and andesite. == Texture == The texture of extrusive rocks is characterized by fine-grained crystals indistinguishable to the human eye, described as aphantic. Crystals in aphantic rocks are small in size due to their rapid formation during eruption. Any larger crystals visible to the human eye, called phenocrysts, form earlier while slowly cooling in the magma reservoir. When igneous rocks contain two distinct grain sizes, the texture is porphyritic, and the finer crystals are called the groundmass. The extrusive rocks scoria and pumice have a vesicular, bubble-like, texture due to the presence of vapor bubbles trapped in the magma. == Extrusive bodies and rock types == Shield volcanoes are large, slow forming volcanoes that erupt fluid basaltic magma that cools to form the extrusive rock basalt. Basalt is composed of minerals readily available in the planet's crust, including feldspars and pyroxenes. Fissure volcanoes pour out low viscosity basaltic magma from fissure vents to form the extrusive rock basalt. Composite or stratovolcanoes often have andesitic magma and typically form the extrusive rock andesite. Andesitic magma is composed of many gases and melted mantle rocks. Cinder or scoria cones violently expel lava with high gas content, and due to the vapor bubbles in this mafic lava, the extrusive basalt scoria is formed. Lava domes are formed by high viscosity lava that piles up, forming a dome shape. Domes typically solidify to form the rich in silica extrusive rock obsidian and sometimes dacite domes form the extrusive rock dacite, like in the case of Mount St. Helens. Calderas are volcanic depressions formed after an erupted volcano collapses. Resurgent calderas can refill with an eruption of rhyolitic magma to form the extrusive rock rhyolite like the Yellowstone Caldera. Submarine volcanoes erupt on the ocean floor and produce the extrusive rock pumice. Pumice is a light-weight, glass with a vesicular texture that differs from scoria in its silicic composition and therefore floats. ==See also== *Seamount ==References== ==External links== *Igneous and volcanic textures - images *Vesicular and Amygdaloidal Textures Category:Igneous petrology Category:Igneous rocks ","title":"Extrusive rock"},{"id":"305407","text":"Each winner of the 1975 Governor General's Awards for Literary Merit was selected by a panel of judges administered by the Canada Council for the Arts.

It is typically dark-colored and dense, with a weakly foliated or schistose (flaky) structure. The small flakes of black and white in the rock often give it a salt-and-pepper appearance. Amphibolite need not be derived from metamorphosed mafic rocks. Because metamorphism creates minerals entirely based upon the chemistry of the protolith, certain 'dirty marls' and volcanic sediments may actually metamorphose to an amphibolite assemblage. Deposits containing dolomite and siderite also readily yield amphibolite (tremolite-schist, grunerite-schist, and others) especially where there has been a certain amount of contact metamorphism by adjacent granitic masses. Metamorphosed basalt creates ortho-amphibolite and other chemically appropriate lithologies create para-amphibolite. Tremolite, while it is a metamorphic amphibole, is derived most usually from highly metamorphosed ultramafic rocks, and thus tremolite-talc schist is not generally considered as 'amphibolite'. A holocrystalline plutonic igneous rock composed primarily of hornblende amphibole is called a hornblendite, which is usually a crystal cumulate rock. Igneous rocks with >90% amphiboles, which have a feldspar groundmass, may be a lamprophyre. ==Ortho-amphibolite vs. para-amphibolite== Metamorphic rocks composed primarily of amphibole, plagioclase, with subordinate epidote, zoisite, chlorite, quartz, titanite, and accessory leucoxene, ilmenite and magnetite which have a protolith of an igneous rock are known as Orthoamphibolite. Para-amphibolite will generally have the same equilibrium mineral assemblage as orthoamphibolite, with more biotite, and may include more quartz, plagioclase, and depending on the protolith, more calcite/aragonite and wollastonite. Often the easiest way to determine the true nature of an amphibolite is to inspect its field relationships; especially whether it is interfingered with other metasedimentary rocks, especially greywacke and other poorly sorted sedimentary rocks. If the amphibolite appears to transgress apparent protolith bedding surfaces it is an ortho-amphibolite, as this suggests it was a dyke. Picking a sill and thin metamorphosed lava flows may be more troublesome. Thereafter, whole rock geochemistry will suitably identify ortho- from para-amphibolite. The word metabasalt was thus coined, largely to avoid the confusion between ortho- amphibolite and para-amphibolite. While not a true metamorphic rock name, as it infers an origin, it is a useful term. ==Amphibolite facies== Garnet amphibolite, sold as \\"Nordic Sunset Granite\\", reportedly from Murmansk area. Amphibolite as a rock defines a particular set of temperature and pressure conditions known as the amphibolite facies. However, caution must be applied here before embarking on metamorphic mapping based on amphibolite alone. Firstly, for an orthoamphibolite or amphibolite to be classed as a metamorphic amphibolite, it must be certain that the amphibole in the rock is a prograde metamorphic product, and not a retrograde metamorphic product. For instance, actinolite amphibole is a common product of retrograde metamorphism of metabasalt at (upper) greenschist facies conditions. Often, this will take on the crystal form and habit of the original protolith assemblage; actinolite pseudomorphically replacing pyroxene is an indication that the amphibolite may not represent a peak metamorphic grade in the amphibolite facies. Actinolite schist is often the result of hydrothermal alteration or metasomatism, and thus may not, necessarily, be a good indicator of metamorphic conditions when taken in isolation. Secondly, the microstructure and crystal size of the rock must be appropriate. Amphibolite facies conditions are experienced at temperatures in excess of 500 ¬∞C and pressures less than 1.2 GPa, well within the ductile deformation field. Gneissic texture may occur nearby, if not then mylonite zones, foliations and ductile behaviour, including stretching lineations may occur. While it is not impossible to have remnant protolith mineralogy, this is rare. More common is to find phenocrysts of pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase and even magmatic amphibole such as pargasite rhombohedra, pseudomorphed by hornblende amphibole. Original magmatic textures, especially crude magmatic layering in layered intrusions, is often preserved. Amphibolite facies equilibrium mineral assemblages of various protolith rock types consist of: * Basalt ortho-amphibolite; hornblende/actinolite +/- albite +/- biotite +/- quartz +/- accessories; often remnant greenschist facies assemblages including, notably, chlorite * High- magnesia basalt; as ortho-amphibolite, but may contain anthophyllite, a Mg- rich amphibole * Ultramafic rocks; tremolite, asbestiform amphibole, talc, pyroxene, wollastonite, prograde metamorphic olivine (rarely) * Sedimentary para-amphibolite; hornblende/actinolite +/- albite +/- biotite +/- quartz +/- garnet (calcite +/- wollastonite) * Pelite; quartz, orthoclase +/- albite, +/- biotite +/- actinolite +/- garnet +/- staurolite +/- sillimanite Amphibolite facies is usually a product of Barrovian Facies Sequence or advanced Abukuma Facies Sequence metamorphic trajectories. Amphibolite facies is a result of continuing burial and thermal heating after greenschist facies is exceeded. Further burial and metamorphic compression (but little extra heat) will lead to eclogite facies metamorphism; with more advanced heating the majority of rocks begin melting in excess of 650 to 700 ¬∞C in the presence of water. In dry rocks, however, additional heat (and burial) may result in granulite facies conditions. ===Uralite=== Uralite is a particular hydrothermally altered pyroxenite; during autogenic hydrothermal circulation the primary mineralogy of pyroxene and plagioclase, etc. has altered to actinolite and saussurite (albite + epidote). The texture is distinctive, the pyroxene altered to fuzzy, radially arranged actinolite pseudomorphically after pyroxene, and saussuritised plagioclase. ===Epidiorite=== The archaic term epidiorite is sometimes used, especially in Europe, to refer to a metamorphosed ortho-amphibolite with a protolith of diorite, gabbro or other mafic intrusive rock. In epidiorite the original clinopyroxene (most often augite) has been replaced by the fibrous amphibole uralite. ==Uses== Amphibolite was a favourite material for the production of adzes (shoe-last- celts) in the central European early Neolithic (Linearbandkeramic and R√∂ssen cultures). Amphibolite is a common dimension stone used in construction, paving, facing of buildings, especially because of its attractive textures, dark color, hardness and polishability and its ready availability. ==References== * Winter, John D., 2001.

Lee (born Jakey Lou Williams, February 15, 1957) is an American guitarist signed to Frontiers Records. He is best known for playing with Ozzy Osbourne between 1982 and 1987 and later in Badlands with Ray Gillen. He formed the band Red Dragon Cartel in 2013. Their eponymous first album was released in January 2014 and entered at no. 69 on Billboard's Album Charts. He has also recorded solo works under his own name‚Äîexamples being the instrumental album A Fine Pink Mist (1996) and cover album Retraced (2005). == Musical education == Lee was born in Norfolk, Virginia, U.S. His father is of Welsh ancestry; his mother is of Japanese ancestry. His father was a jazz fan, while his mother was a classic music fan, and his older sister a pop music fan. Lee grew up in San Diego and was encouraged by his mother to take classical piano lessons as a child when he was six years old. With a lack of interest in piano, 13-year-old Lee found that he enjoyed playing his older sister's guitar. His older sister influenced his desire to play by introducing him to Jimi Hendrix, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin records. The first song he learned was \\"No Time\\" by The Guess Who. From there, he used what formal training he had from piano, along with a Mel Bay guitar method book and concentrated on becoming a self-taught rock guitarist. Catching on and quickly developing a talent for the guitar, Lee played in several high school bands. And so a teenaged Lee was already turning heads and impressing fellow San Diego musicians with his style of playing. == Musical career == In San Diego, Lee headed a band called Teaser, purportedly named after the debut solo album of Tommy Bolin, of whom Lee was an avowed fan. Teaser was the official house band at San Diego's first \\"teen night club,\\" StraitaHead Sound. In 1980, Lee joined a San Diego hard rock band called Mickey Ratt, which after later relocating to Los Angeles became the popular glam metal band Ratt. They released the single \\"Dr. Rock\\"/\\"Drivin on E,\\" which was given away for free to fans at their live shows. Their song \\"Tell the World\\" was included on the original pressing of the influential first Metal Massacre album (1982), an album which also featured Metallica's first song \\"Hit the Lights.\\" Lee soon left Ratt to join Rough Cutt, who were at that time produced by Ronnie James Dio and managed by his wife, Wendy. After hearing Lee in Rough Cutt in 1982, Dio invited Lee to join his new solo band Dio, which he was forming after departing Black Sabbath. Lee accepted, though his time in Dio's band was short-lived. According to drummer Vinny Appice, there were rehearsals with Lee and Dio and recordings of those rehearsals still exist. Lee claims to have written the main riff to \\"Don't Talk to Strangers\\" (which would later appear on the Holy Diver album) and that Dio wanted him to play \\"simple block chords that wouldn't trample on his vocals.\\" When Ozzy Osbourne sought a permanent replacement for the deceased Randy Rhoads, he came to Los Angeles to audition lead guitarists. Bassist Dana Strum, who had recommended Rhoads to Osbourne in 1979, this time recommended Lee for the job. Osbourne was torn between Lee and Dokken guitarist George Lynch. Though Osbourne is said to have initially chosen Lynch, he soon changed his mind and Lee became his full-time guitarist for the next five years. Lee joined Osbourne's band in late 1982 following the tour supporting the Speak of the Devil live album that featured Brad Gillis on guitar. With Lee, bassist Bob Daisley then began writing lyrics and recording the Bark at the Moon album. The songs \\"So Tired\\" and \\"Bark at the Moon\\" were released as singles, with accompanying videos, and they received regular airplay on MTV and radio. \\"Bark At The Moon\\", like \\"Crazy Train\\", by predecessor Randy Rhoads, is a highly acclaimed guitar riff and virtuoso piece that is highly adaptable to the lyrics. In \\"Crazy Train\\", the train is heard chugging and it's whistle blows. In \\"Bark at the Moon\\", the guitar \\"lightning\\" and rhythm \\"thunder\\" introduce the werewolf's transformation. To date, the album has sold three million copies in the U.S. After Osbourne left the Betty Ford Center where he had been treated for substance abuse, Lee presented him with the music he had written while Osbourne was away. Osbourne was purportedly very satisfied with the quantity and quality of Lee's new music, much of which would be used for the 1986 album The Ultimate Sin. The album was awarded platinum status in May 1986 and was awarded double platinum status in October 1994. Lee and Osbourne once again toured extensively, this time with Phil Soussan on bass, John Sinclair on keyboards and Randy Castillo on drums. In Kansas City, Missouri on April 1, 1986, a concert was filmed which would be released later that year as the home video The Ultimate Ozzy. In 1987, after touring with Ozzy Osbourne in support of The Ultimate Sin album, Lee was fired via telephone by Sharon Osbourne, after the two just had dinner together. http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/jake-e-lee-says-he-found-out-he-was-fired- from-ozzy-osbournes-band-from-his-guitar-tech Lee was completely caught off guard at the time of his firing and was under the impression he had a solid working gig with the Osbourne camp. After being fired from Ozzy's band, Lee formed the blues-based hard rock band Badlands with vocalist Ray Gillen in 1988. Badlands consisted of Lee, Gillen, drummer Eric Singer, and bassist Greg Chaisson. The band released their self-titled debut album in 1989. In 1991, Singer left Badlands to join KISS following the death of longtime drummer Eric Carr. Badlands then released the follow-up album Voodoo Highway. During a tour between that album and the upcoming third album they were ready to begin recording, Gillen left the band and was briefly replaced by John West. Gillen later died of AIDS-related complications in 1993. In 1998, Dusk, the final Badlands album consisting of unreleased live in-studio 24-track demos was released in Japan; a European release followed in 2000. Following the demise of Badlands, Lee opted for a radical musical departure and teamed with World War III vocalist Mandy Lion in a new band called Wicked Alliance. The initial line-up also featured future Korn drummer Ray Luzier and bassist Jimmy Bain who was replaced with Brian Perry, formerly of Dirty Looks and Lizzy Borden, in time for the band's one and only U.S. tour in early 1994. The band also cut a three-song demo with Joe Floyd of Warrior at Silver Cloud Studios in Burbank, CA. The songs recorded were \\"The Rust\\", \\"Kiss This\\", and \\"World Gone Wild\\", the latter of which Lion had previously performed with a late 1980s line-up of World War III. Another song the band worked on was \\"Blood Provider\\", based on Badlands' \\"Sun Red Sun\\", which later surfaced on the posthumous Dusk album in 1998. In 1996, Lee released an instrumental solo album titled A Fine Pink Mist on the Pony Canyon label in Japan with the intention of also releasing the Wicked Alliance album through the same company. However, Lee and Lion never finished the album and no tracks from it have surfaced to date. Throughout most of the 1990s and into the new millennium, Lee kept a relatively low profile. He has most notably appeared on musical tributes to Queen, AC/DC, Rush, Van Halen, Randy Rhoads, and Metallica. Lee also briefly joined Bourgeois Pigs with Shark Island vocalist Richard Black, guitarist Michael Guy, and bassist Tony Franklin. One demo from the Bourgeois Pigs sessions emerged on the Union 4 compilation in 2001 called \\"Calamities of Vanity\\". In 2000, Lee played lead guitar on two tracks from Rob Rock's Rage of Creation album. In 2005, Lee released his first album in eight years entitled Retraced, which consisted of blues covers from the 1960s and 1970s. Lee was briefly in a three-piece band called 3 Day Crush. In 2011, Jake appeared in the video, along with Ron Keel, Blas Elias, Sunset Thomas and Paul Shortino, for the song \\"We Come Undone\\" by the band Beggars & Thieves. The song is from their new CD We Are the Brokenhearted and Jake is featured performing the guitar solo. The following captions appear on the screen during Jake's appearance: \\"Jake E. Lee is alive and well, living in Las Vegas\\" and \\"He would just rather play with Beggars & Thieves than deal with shady promoters and play Bark at the Moon 750 more times\\". In 2012, Lee had a cameo in That Metal Show's \\"That Metal Special\\" in Las Vegas, and was a guest on the fourth episode of the 12th season of the show as well as guest guitarist on the eighth and ninth episodes of the same season. In 2013, Lee formed a new band called Red Dragon Cartel. Their self-titled debut album was released in January 2014. While appearing on That Metal Show on VH1 Classic, Jake E. Lee claimed he wrote \\"Bark at the Moon\\" for which Ozzy Osbourne claimed credit, along with the rest of that album. Lee and Daisley were properly credited for their writing on The Ultimate Sin album. == Equipment == Note: He has used various other pieces of equipment, but due to his low profile, it is difficult to list all of it.

A rope, helmet, and harness can be used to increase the safety of the climber. Other equipment can also be used depending on the experience and skill of the tree climber. Some tree climbers take special hammocks called \\"Treeboats\\" and Portaledges with them into the tree canopies where they can enjoy a picnic or nap, or spend the night. Some tree-climbers employ a mixture of techniques and gear derived from rock climbing and caving. These techniques are also used to climb trees for other purposes: tree care (arborists), animal rescue, research, and activism. ==History== A child climbs a tree. Professional arborists have been climbing trees since the late 19th century in the UK and North America.Memory Lane - A History of ISA Tree climbing as an organized recreational activity using modern climbing equipment emerged in the early 1980s in USA. In 1983, Peter \\"Treeman\\" Jenkins, an active arborist and retired rock climber, founded Tree Climbers International, Inc. TCI eventually developed written safety and training rules for tree climbing which are used to this day. Now there are numerous organizations promoting tree climbing around the world (Japan, USA, France, UK, Canada, Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, China etc.). In 2007, a meeting of experienced tree climbing facilitators and instructors, including Peter Jenkins, and organized by Harv Teitelbaum of Tree Climbing Colorado and Abe Winters of Tree Climbing USA, took place in Colorado, USA to discuss the formation of the first democratic umbrella organization dedicated to serving the recreational, adventure, experiential and educational tree climbing communities. From those initial meetings, GOTC (Global Organization of Tree Climbers) was formed and incorporated as a charitable, nonprofit organization. Today, GOTC provides training curricula and safe climb guidelines in use worldwide and adopted by experiential organizations including the AEE (Association for Experiential Education). Climbing a tree every day for a year, (a 365 project), or for longer, has become a challenge taken up by several artists, Todd Smith from Louisville, KY, USA, climbed a tree every day for 3 years. Henrik G Dahle, invited people to climb with him and interviewed people in the canopy of trees, including former 365 tree climber Leo Murray of Monkeydo, who now facilitates tree top adventures. Other artists include Christopher B Gray from Connecticut, USA, Kamila Wajda from Przybowka, Poland and Cecylia Malik from Krak√≥w, Poland who has published a book on her year climbing trees. ==Techniques== Many different techniques (free climbing, self-belayed climbing with a doubled-rope technique, single-rope technique, and lead climbing) are used to climb trees depending on the climber's individual style, purpose, and preferences. Of course free tree climbing has been practiced throughout the history of the human race, and is much more common than using any kind of technological aid. Technologically-aided tree climbing is performed by lapping a long rope over a limb and ascending the fallen end using a friction knot tied from initial tie's excess \\"tail.\\" The difficulty of any particular climb depends on many factors: the regularity of branching, the brittleness of dead wood in some species, whether the bark is rough or smooth, the width of the trunk and branches, the height of the tree, the location of the tree, and the weather are all factors. The first obstacle is getting into the tree, which may employ techniques of aid climbing such as ascending a fixed rope, ladder or etrier, or else free climbing up limbs or other structures into the tree, but generally the throwline technique which is used. This is done remotely from the ground utilizing a throw weight and line. The throw weight is a small canvas sack filled with shot and adorned with a ring on one end for attaching a lightweight pilot line. The weight is swung from its attached line as a pendulum, with the line either held between two fingers of one hand at hip level, or in a basket configuration achieved by running a bight of the line back through the ring that is held in the other hand, with the weight being swung between the legs in a wide stance. It is then launched toward the targeted branch. Once over the branch, the weight must return to the ground, and may have to be manipulated so as to isolate a single anchor point (doubled rope technique), or for SRT into an optimal redirect. The throw bag is then removed; the climbing line is tied on, and pulled through the canopy and back down again, at which point the climbing system may be installed. ===Doubled- rope technique=== Arborist climbing a Norway Maple in Ontario, Canada The doubled-rope technique (DRT or DdRT) is used to self belay the climber in such a way that the rope can be retrieved without going back up the tree. One end of the rope is fastened to the climber's saddle (harness), from there the rope passes around the tree and back to a friction hitch, which is also attached to the climber. This system allows the climber to easily adjust the rope to provide a belay if free-climbing, or to go up or down if hanging on the rope. As long as the climber is below the anchor and there is minimal slack in the system, any fall will be restrained. This system can be placed into the tree from the ground, or the climber can advance the rope up the tree over the course of the climb. Depiction of a failed attempt at tree climbing, from an anecdote in Frances Fuller Victor's 1887 book Eleven years in the Rocky Mountains and a life on the frontier (Ch. V.) ===Single-rope technique=== The single-rope technique (SRT) is used mainly for getting to the top of large trees that cannot be easily free-climbed. With the adequate hardware, a throw line, an attached weight, and a launching system (e.g., a bow or slingshot), a climbing rope can be anchored to a branch very high in the tree. This is done by launching the weight (with the throw line attached) over the desired limb and tying the climbing rope to the unweighted end. The climbing rope is then hauled over the branch by pulling on the throw line. The line is anchored to the trunk or to the high limb itself by running one end through a closed bight made in the other end. The climber then ascends the rope (using a set of friction hitches or mechanical ascenders) to obtain the desired limb. With practice, this method is typically fastest and requires the least amount of hardware. One drawback is that it does not necessarily involve directly ascending the tree itself, as the vast majority of the time spent climbing is ascending the rope, and not the tree itself. Additionally, it can provide greater safety to a climber over DRT or lead climbing techniques, as the climber can rig the rope over multiple limbs when using a ground-level trunk anchor. In the event that one limb breaks, the lower limbs may stop the fall. ===Lead climbing=== Lead climbing is employed by climber where points of protection are formed by girthing the tree's limbs with slings. Once the lead climber ascends the tree, he or she may create a belay or top rope anchor or else simply rappel down. In the event that an anchor is created, other climbers can subsequently climb the tree on belay without having to lead. Drawbacks to this method include the probability of hitting a lower limb or the main trunk in the event of a fall. == See also == * Climbing * Caving * Tree house * Tree sitting * Aerial Adventure Park ==References== == External links == * Global Organization of Tree Climbers * Tree Climber's Coalition for canopy research, adventure, and education * Artist Henrik G.

They also worked in California and Chile (see Easter Island and Rapanui people as related subjects). \\"Kanaka\\", originally referred only to native Hawaiians, from their own name for themselves, kƒÅnaka  ª≈çiwi or kƒÅnaka maoli, in the Hawai ªian language. In the Americas in particular, native Hawaiians were the majority; but Kanakas in Australia were almost entirely Melanesian. In Australian English \\"kanaka\\" is now avoided outside of its historical context, as it has been used as an offensive term. ==Australia== South Sea Islander labourers on a Queensland sugar plantation, 1890s; photographer unknown According to the Macquarie Dictionary, the word \\"kanaka\\", which was once widely used in Australia, is now regarded in Australian English as an offensive term for a Pacific Islander.Macquarie Dictionary (Fourth Edition), 2005, p. 774 Most \\"Kanakas\\" in Australia were people from Melanesia, rather than Polynesia. The descendants of 19th century immigrants to Australia from the Pacific Islands now generally refer to themselves as \\"South Sea Islanders\\", and this is also the term used in formal and official situations. Most of the original labourers were recruited from the Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides (Vanuatu), and New Caledonia, though others were taken from the Loyalty Islands. Some were kidnapped (\\"blackbirded\\") or otherwise induced into long-term slavery or unfree labour. The first shipload of 65 Melanesian labourers arrived in Boyd Town on 16 April 1847 on board the Velocity, a vessel under the command of Captain Kirsopp and chartered by Benjamin Boyd. Boyd was a Scottish colonist who wanted cheap labourers to work at his expansive pastoral leaseholds in the colony of New South Wales. He financed two more procurements of South Sea Islanders, 70 of which arrived in Sydney in September 1847, and another 57 in October of that same year. Many of these Islanders soon absconded from their workplaces and were observed starving and destitute on the streets of Sydney. After the report of the alleged murder of the Native Chief of the Island of Rotumah in 1848, a closed-door enquiry was held, choosing not to take any action against Boyd or Kirsopp. The experiment of exploiting Melanesian labour was discontinued in Australia until Robert Towns recommenced the practice in the early 1860s. More than 60,000 Islanders had been brought to Australia after 1863, and about 10,000 were living in Queensland and northern New South Wales in 1901. The majority of those were repatriated by the Australian Government between 1906 and 1908, under the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901, legislation that was an essential part of the White Australia policy. Some were exempted on various grounds, including marriage to Australians. Today, their descendants, and those of others who avoided deportation, form Australia's largest Melano-Polynesian ethnic group. Many Australian South Sea Islanders are also of mixed ancestry, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, for whom they are often mistaken. As a consequence, Australian South Sea Islanders have faced forms of discrimination similar to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. After 1994, the Australian South Sea Islander community was recognised as a unique minority group, following a report by the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which found they had become more disadvantaged than indigenous Australians. ==Canada== Hawaiian family who settled in British Columbia, ca. 1890 Canadian Kanakas were all Hawaiian in origin. They had been aboard the first exploration and trading ships to reach the Pacific Northwest Coast. There were cases of Kanakas jumping ship then living amongst various First Nations peoples. The first Kanakas to settle came from Fort Vancouver after clearing the original Fort Langley site and building the palisade (1827). They were often assigned to the fur brigades and Express of the fur companies and were a part of the life of company forts. A great many were contracted to the Hudson's Bay Company while some had arrived in the area as ship's hands. In other instances, they migrated north from California. Many Kanaka men married First Nations women,Koppel, Tom, 1995 Kanaka: The Untold Story of Hawaiian Pioneers in British Columbia and Pacific Northwest p 2 and their descendants can still be found in British Columbia and neighbouring parts of Canada, and the United States (particularly in the states of Washington and Oregon). Kanaka Creek, British Columbia, was a community of mixed Hawaiian-First families established across the Fraser River from Fort Langley in the 1830s, which remains on the map today. Kanakas were active in both the California Gold Rush, and in the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush and other rushes. Kanaka Bar, British Columbia gets its name from claims staked and worked by Kanakas who had previously worked for the fur company (which today is a First Nations community of the Nlaka'pamux people). There were no negative connotations in the use of Kanaka in British Columbian and Californian English of the time, and in its most usual sense today, it denotes someone of Hawaiian ethnic inheritance, without any pejorative meaning. One linguist holds that Canuck, a nickname for Canadians, is derived from the Hawaiian Kanaka.Allen, Irving Lewis, 1990. Unkind Words: Ethnic Labeling from Redskin to WASP, pp 59, 61‚Äì62. New York: Bergin & Garvey. . ==United States== The first native workers from the Hawaiian Islands (called the \\"Sandwich Islands\\" at the time) arrived on the Tonquin in 1811 to clear the site and help build Fort Astoria, as undertaken by the Pacific Fur Company. Nearly 12 Kanakas or a third of the workforce wintered over among \\"Astorians\\". Kanakas built Fort Elizabeth on the island of Kauai in Hawaii for the Russian American Company in 1817, with others to follow. By the 1820s, Kanakas were employed in the kitchen and other skilled trades by the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver, mostly living south and west of the main palisade in an area known as \\"Kanaka Village.\\" Kanakas, employed in agriculture and ranching, were present in the mainland United States as early as 1834, primarily in California under Spanish colonial rule, and later under American company contracts. (Richard Henry Dana refers often to Kanaka workers and sailors on the Californian coast in his book Two Years Before the Mast). The migration of Kanakas peaked between 1900 and 1930, and most of their families soon blended by intermarriage into the Chinese, Filipino, and more numerous Mexican populations with whom they came in contact. At one point, Native Hawaiians harvested sugar beets and picked apples in the states of Washington and Oregon. The Kanakas have left a legacy in Oregon place names, such as Kanaka Flat in Jacksonville, the Owyhee River in southeastern Oregon (Owyhee is an archaic spelling of Hawaii) and the Kanaka Gulch. ==See also== *Kanak: indigenous people of Kanaky (New Caledonia) *Kanake: German racial epithet *Blackbirding *Haole *Indentured servant *Coolies *Slavery ==References== ==Further reading== * Affeldt, Stefanie: Consuming Whiteness.

Von der Ahe arrived in New York City but quickly moved to St. Louis, where he worked as a clerk in a grocery store. Later, he bought out the store owner and expanded business by establishing a saloon in the back of the store. Von der Ahe noticed that a number of his patrons visited the saloon after baseball games, so in 1882, he bought the bankrupt and scandal-ridden St. Louis Brown Stockings baseball franchise for $1,800 and joined the American Association baseball league. He named the team the Browns and hired future Chicago White Sox owner Charles Comiskey to play first base and eventually manage the team. Von der Ahe took a very active role in the team, even though he knew almost nothing about baseball. Other than player/manager/owner Albert Spalding, Von der Ahe was the first baseball owner with a significant public persona, the predecessor of Bill Veeck, Charlie Finley and George Steinbrenner in this regard. With his thick German accent (\\"I am der poss bresident of der Prowns!\\") bushy mustache and showmanship, he was as much of a story as his players. The Browns dominated the American Association, winning four straight league championships starting in 1885, and the baseball, beer, and other investments made von der Ahe wealthy. He made $500,000 off the baseball team alone. He set the ticket price at 25 cents, hoping fans would spend money on beer. As a result, the Browns led the league in attendance and soon had to expand his ballpark. The term fan (from fanatic) is sometimes attributed to von der Ahe.Suehsdorf, A. D. (1978). The Great American Baseball Scrapbook, p. 8. Random House. . In 1885, von der Ahe erected a larger-than-life statue outside of Sportsman's Park, not of any of his star players, but of himself. A sportswriter from Denver mockingly dubbed the statue \\"Von der Ahe discovers Illinois.\\" Although eccentric, von der Ahe made a number of innovations, including operating a farm club called the St. Louis Whites. Also, tradition holds that von der Ahe was the first to sell hot dogs at the ballpark, although some historians dispute this. Von der Ahe billed himself as the \\"Millionaire Sportsman\\". In 1887, after a poor showing in the World Series, the ill-tempered von der Ahe threatened to withhold his players' share of the earnings. In 1891, he was also majority owner of the Cincinnati Kelly's Killers which played for part of one season in the American Association. In 1892 the team joined the National League after the American Association folded. By this time, Comiskey had lost patience with von der Ahe and left for the Cincinnati Reds. Without Comiskey, the Browns quickly became a last-place team. Legal problems plagued von der Ahe's ownership, especially in the later years. In an effort to recoup his losses, in 1892 he moved to a larger ballpark, which he surrounded with an amusement park, complete with beer garden, a horse track in the outfield, a \\"shoot-the-shoots\\" water flume ride, and an artificial lake (used for ice skating in winter). The league, which prohibited gambling on its grounds, disapproved of the race track; so did von der Ahe's outfielders. The press called the facility \\"Coney Island West\\" and nicknamed von der Ahe \\"Von der Ha Ha.\\" With losses still piling up, von der Ahe resorted to selling off his best players, mostly to Brooklyn. In 1898, part of the ballpark burned down during an April game with Chicago; his second wife divorced him; and his bondsman kidnapped him for not paying his debts. In a highly publicized trial connected with the fire, von der Ahe lost his baseball team. The Browns changed hands twice and changed their name twice, first to the Perfectos (1899) and then to the Cardinals (1900). The American League team known as the St. Louis Browns from 1902 to 1953 had no connection to von der Ahe's team aside from the name, which was designed to invoke the memory of the 1885‚Äì1889 era. Von der Ahe soon lost his other wealth as well and was reduced to tending bar in a small saloon. Comiskey frequently sent von der Ahe money to help make ends meet. In April 1908, the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns played each other in a benefit game for him. The club raised $4,300.Crazy ‚Äô08: How a cast of Cranks, Rogues, Boneheads and Magnates created the Greatest Year in Baseball History, p. 164, by Cait Murphy, Smithsonian Books, a Division of Harper Collins, 2007, ==Death== He died of cirrhosis of the liver on June 5, 1913.

Conway & Richard K. Guy, The Book of Numbers, 1996, p.59-62 It is simply a finite sequence of positive integers separated by rightward arrows, e.g. 2\\\\to3\\\\to4\\\\to5\\\\to6. As with most combinatorial notations, the definition is recursive. In this case the notation eventually resolves to being the leftmost number raised to some (usually enormous) integer power. ==Definition and overview== A \\"Conway chain\\" is defined as follows: * Any positive integer is a chain of length 1. * A chain of length n, followed by a right-arrow ‚Üí and a positive integer, together form a chain of length n+1. Any chain represents an integer, according to the five (technically four) rules below. Two chains are said to be equivalent if they represent the same integer. If p, q, and r are positive integers, and X is a subchain, then: # An empty chain (or a chain of length 0) is equal to 1, and the chain p represents the number p. #X \\\\to 1 is equivalent to X. #p \\\\rightarrow q \\\\rightarrow r is equivalent to p [\\\\uparrow ^ r] q. (see Knuth's up arrow notation) # X \\\\to p \\\\to (q + 1) is equivalent to X \\\\to ( X \\\\to ( \\\\cdots (X \\\\to ( X ) \\\\to q)\\\\cdots ) \\\\to q ) \\\\to q (with p copies of X, p-1 copies of q, and p-1 pairs of parentheses; applies for q > 0). #Because p \\\\rightarrow q \\\\rightarrow 1 is equivalent to p \\\\to q, (By rule 2) and also to p \\\\uparrow q = p^q, (By rule 3) we can define p \\\\to q to equal p^q Note that the fourth rule can be replaced by repeatedly applying two rules to avoid the ellipses: :4a. X \\\\to 1 \\\\to (q + 1) is equivalent to X :4b. X \\\\to (p + 1) \\\\to (q + 1) is equivalent to X \\\\to (X \\\\to p \\\\to (q+1)) \\\\to q ==Properties== # A chain evaluates to a perfect power of its first number #Therefore, 1\\\\to Y is equal to 1 #X\\\\to1\\\\to Y is equivalent to X #2\\\\to2\\\\to Y is equal to 4 #X\\\\to2\\\\to2 is equivalent to X\\\\to(X) (not to be confused with X\\\\to X) ==Interpretation== One must be careful to treat an arrow chain as a whole. Arrow chains do not describe the iterated application of a binary operator. Whereas chains of other infixed symbols (e.g. 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) can often be considered in fragments (e.g. (3 + 4) + 5 + (6 + 7)) without a change of meaning (see associativity), or at least can be evaluated step by step in a prescribed order, e.g. 34567 from right to left, that is not so with Conway's arrow chains. For example: * 2\\\\rightarrow3\\\\rightarrow2 = 2\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow3 = 2^{2^2} = 16 * 2\\\\rightarrow\\\\left(3\\\\rightarrow2\\\\right) = 2^{(3^2)} = 2^{3^2} = 512 * \\\\left(2\\\\rightarrow3\\\\right)\\\\rightarrow2 = \\\\left(2^3\\\\right)^2 = 64 The fourth rule is the core: A chain of 4 or more elements ending with 2 or higher becomes a chain of the same length with a (usually vastly) increased penultimate element. But its ultimate element is decremented, eventually permitting the second rule to shorten the chain. After, to paraphrase Knuth, \\"much detail\\", the chain is reduced to three elements and the third rule terminates the recursion. ==Examples== Examples get quite complicated quickly.

If, for any chain X, we let f(p) = X \\\\to p then X \\\\to p \\\\to 2 = f^p(1) (see functional powers). Applying this with X = a \\\\to b, then f(p) = a [p + 2]b and a \\\\to b \\\\to p \\\\to 2 = a [a \\\\to b \\\\to (p - 1) \\\\to 2 + 2] b = f^p(1) Thus, for example, 10 \\\\to 6 \\\\to 3\\\\to 2 = 10 [10 [1000002] 6 + 2] 6 .

When we write g_q(p) = X \\\\to p \\\\to q we have X \\\\to p \\\\to q+1 = g_q^p(1), that is, g_{q+1}(p) = g_q^p(1). In the case above, g_2(p) = a \\\\to b \\\\to p \\\\to 2 = f^p(1) and g_3(p) = g_2^p(1), so a \\\\to b \\\\to 2 \\\\to 3 = g_3(2) = g_2^2(1) = g_2(g_2(1)) = f^{f(1)}(1) = f^{a^b}(1) ==Ackermann function== The Ackermann function may be expressed using Conway chained arrow notation: :A(m,n) = 2 \\\\to (m-2) \\\\to (n+3) -3 for m > 2 (Since A(m,n) = 2 [m] (n+3) -3 in hyperoperation) hence :2 \\\\to m \\\\to n = A(m+2,n-3)+3 for n > 2 :(n = 1 and n = 2 would correspond with A(m,-2)=-1 and A(m,-1)=1, which could logically be added). ==Graham's number== Graham's number G itself cannot be expressed concisely in Conway chained arrow notation, but it is bounded by the following: 3 \\\\rightarrow 3 \\\\rightarrow 64 \\\\rightarrow 2 < G < 3 \\\\rightarrow 3 \\\\rightarrow 65 \\\\rightarrow 2 Proof: We first define the intermediate function f(n) = 3 \\\\rightarrow 3 \\\\rightarrow n = \\\\begin{matrix} 3\\\\underbrace{\\\\uparrow \\\\uparrow \\\\cdots \\\\uparrow}3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\text{n arrows} \\\\end{matrix}, which can be used to define Graham's number as G = f^{64}(4).

This function, as one might expect, grows extraordinarily fast. == Extension by Peter Hurford == Peter Hurford, a web developer and statistician, has defined an extension to this notation: a \\\\rightarrow_b c = \\\\underbrace{a\\\\rightarrow_{b-1} a\\\\rightarrow_{b-1} a\\\\rightarrow_{b-1} \\\\dots \\\\rightarrow_{b-1} a\\\\rightarrow_{b-1} a\\\\rightarrow_{b-1} a}_{c \\\\text{ arrows}} a \\\\rightarrow_1 b = a \\\\rightarrow b All normal rules are unchanged otherwise. a \\\\rightarrow_2 (a-1) is already equal to the aforementioned cg(a), and the function f(n) = n \\\\rightarrow_n n is much faster growing than Conway and Guy's cg(n). Note that expressions like a \\\\rightarrow_b c \\\\rightarrow_d e are illegal if b and d are different numbers; one chain must only have one type of right-arrow. However, if we modify this slightly such that: a \\\\rightarrow_b c \\\\rightarrow_d e = a \\\\rightarrow_b \\\\underbrace{c \\\\rightarrow_{d-1} c \\\\rightarrow_{d-1} c \\\\rightarrow_{d-1} \\\\dots \\\\rightarrow_{d-1} c \\\\rightarrow_{d-1} c \\\\rightarrow_{d-1} c}_{e \\\\text{ arrows}} then not only does a \\\\rightarrow_b c \\\\rightarrow_d e become legal, but the notation as a whole becomes much stronger. ==See also== * Steinhaus‚ÄìMoser notation * Systematically creating ever faster increasing sequences ==References== ==External links== * Factoids > big numbers * Robert Munafo's Large Numbers *The Book of Numbers by J.

Megagon is here the name of a polygon with \\"mega\\" sides (not to be confused with the polygon with one million sides). Alternative notations: *use the functions square(x) and triangle(x) *let be the number represented by the number in nested -sided polygons; then the rules are: **M(n,1,3) = n^n **M(n,1,p+1) = M(n,n,p) **M(n,m+1,p) = M(M(n,1,p),m,p) * and **mega = M(2,1,5) **megiston = M(10,1,5) **moser = M(2,1,M(2,1,5)) ==Mega== A mega, ‚ë°, is already a very large number, since ‚ë° = square(square(2)) = square(triangle(triangle(2))) = square(triangle(22)) = square(triangle(4)) = square(44) = square(256) = triangle(triangle(triangle(...triangle(256)...)))

Using the other notation: mega = M(2,1,5) = M(256,256,3) With the function f(x)=x^x we have mega = f^{256}(256) = f^{258}(2) where the superscript denotes a functional power, not a numerical power. We have (note the convention that powers are evaluated from right to left): *M(256,2,3) = (256^{\\\\,\\\\\\\\!256})^{256^{256}}=256^{256^{257}} *M(256,3,3) = (256^{\\\\,\\\\\\\\!256^{257}})^{256^{256^{257}}}=256^{256^{257}\\\\times 256^{256^{257}}}=256^{256^{257+256^{257}}}‚âà256^{\\\\,\\\\\\\\!256^{256^{257}}} Similarly: *M(256,4,3) ‚âà {\\\\,\\\\\\\\!256^{256^{256^{256^{257}}}}} *M(256,5,3) ‚âà {\\\\,\\\\\\\\!256^{256^{256^{256^{256^{257}}}}}} etc. Thus: *mega = M(256,256,3)\\\\approx(256\\\\uparrow)^{256}257, where (256\\\\uparrow)^{256} denotes a functional power of the function f(n)=256^n. Rounding more crudely (replacing the 257 at the end by 256), we get mega ‚âà 256\\\\uparrow\\\\uparrow 257, using Knuth's up-arrow notation. After the first few steps the value of n^n is each time approximately equal to 256^n. In fact, it is even approximately equal to 10^n (see also approximate arithmetic for very large numbers).

By changing shape, it functions to change the focal length of the eye so that it can focus on objects at various distances, thus allowing a sharp real image of the object of interest to be formed on the retina. This adjustment of the lens is known as accommodation (see also below). Accommodation is similar to the focusing of a photographic camera via movement of its lenses. The lens is more flat on its anterior side than on its posterior side. The lens is also known as the aquula (Latin, a little stream, dim. of aqua, water) or crystalline lens. In humans, the refractive power of the lens in its natural environment is approximately 18 dioptres, roughly one-third of the eye's total power. ==Structure== The lens is part of the anterior segment of the human eye. In front of the lens is the iris, which regulates the amount of light entering into the eye. The lens is suspended in place by the suspensory ligament of the lens, a ring of fibrous tissue that attaches to the lens at its equator and connects it to the ciliary body. Posterior to the lens is the vitreous body, which, along with the aqueous humor on the anterior surface, bathes the lens. The lens has an ellipsoid, biconvex shape. The anterior surface is less curved than the posterior. In the adult, the lens is typically circa 10 mm in diameter and has an axial length of about 4 mm, though it is important to note that the size and shape can change due to accommodation and because the lens continues to grow throughout a person's lifetime.John Forrester, Andrew Dick, Paul McMenamin, William Lee (1996). The Eye: Basic Sciences in Practice. London: W. B. Saunders Company Ltd. p. 28 ===Microanatomy=== The lens has three main parts: the lens capsule, the lens epithelium, and the lens fibers. The lens capsule forms the outermost layer of the lens and the lens fibers form the bulk of the interior of the lens. The cells of the lens epithelium, located between the lens capsule and the outermost layer of lens fibers, are found only on the anterior side of the lens. The lens itself lacks nerves, blood vessels, or connective tissue. Lens capsule The lens capsule is a smooth, transparent basement membrane that completely surrounds the lens. The capsule is elastic and is composed of collagen. It is synthesized by the lens epithelium and its main components are type IV collagen and sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The capsule is very elastic and so allows the lens to assume a more globular shape when not under the tension of the zonular fibers (also called suspensory ligaments), which connect the lens capsule to the ciliary body. The capsule varies from 2 to 28 micrometres in thickness, being thickest near the equator and thinnest near the posterior pole. Lens epithelium The lens epithelium, located in the anterior portion of the lens between the lens capsule and the lens fibers, is a simple cuboidal epithelium. The cells of the lens epithelium regulate most of the homeostatic functions of the lens. As ions, nutrients, and liquid enter the lens from the aqueous humor, Na+/K+-ATPase pumps in the lens epithelial cells pump ions out of the lens to maintain appropriate lens osmotic concentration and volume, with equatorially positioned lens epithelium cells contributing most to this current. The activity of the Na+/K+-ATPases keeps water and current flowing through the lens from the poles and exiting through the equatorial regions. The cells of the lens epithelium also serve as the progenitors for new lens fibers. It constantly lays down fibers in the embryo, fetus, infant, and adult, and continues to lay down fibers for lifelong growth.\\"eye, human\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD 2009 Lens fibers Pattern of lens fibers (anterior and lateral aspect) The lens fibers form the bulk of the lens. They are long, thin, transparent cells, firmly packed, with diameters typically 4‚Äì7 micrometres and lengths of up to 12 mm long. The lens fibers stretch lengthwise from the posterior to the anterior poles and, when cut horizontally, are arranged in concentric layers rather like the layers of an onion. If cut along the equator, it appears as a honeycomb. The middle of each fiber lies on the equator. These tightly packed layers of lens fibers are referred to as laminae. The lens fibers are linked together via gap junctions and interdigitations of the cells that resemble \\"ball and socket\\" forms. The lens is split into regions depending on the age of the lens fibers of a particular layer. Moving outwards from the central, oldest layer, the lens is split into an embryonic nucleus, the fetal nucleus, the adult nucleus, and the outer cortex. New lens fibers, generated from the lens epithelium, are added to the outer cortex. Mature lens fibers have no organelles or nuclei. === Development === Development of the human lens begins at the 4 mm embryonic stage. Unlike the rest of the eye, which is derived mostly from the neural ectoderm, the lens is derived from the surface ectoderm. The first stage of lens differentiation takes place when the optic vesicle, which is formed from outpocketings in the neural ectoderm, comes in proximity to the surface ectoderm. The optic vesicle induces nearby surface ectoderm to form the lens placode. At the 4 mm stage, the lens placode is a single monolayer of columnar cells. As development progresses, the lens placode begins to deepen and invaginate. As the placode continues to deepen, the opening to the surface ectoderm constricts and the lens cells forms a structure known as the lens vesicle. By the 10 mm stage, the lens vesicle has completely separated from the surface ectoderm. After the 10 mm stage, signals from the developing neural retina induces the cells closest to the posterior end of the lens vesicle begin to elongate toward the anterior end of the vesicle.The Eye: Basic Sciences in Practice, p. 102, These signals also induce the synthesis of crystallins. These elongating cells eventually fill in the lumen of the vesicle to form the primary fibers, which become the embryonic nucleus in the mature lens. The cells of the anterior portion of the lens vesicle give rise to the lens epithelium. Additional secondary fibers are derived from lens epithelial cells located toward the equatorial region of the lens. These cells lengthen anteriorly and posteriorly to encircle the primary fibers. The new fibers grow longer than those of the primary layer, but as the lens gets larger, the ends of the newer fibers cannot reach the posterior or anterior poles of the lens. The lens fibers that do not reach the poles form tight, interdigitating seams with neighboring fibers. These seams are readily visible and are termed sutures. The suture patterns become more complex as more layers of lens fibers are added to the outer portion of the lens. The lens continues to grow after birth, with the new secondary fibers being added as outer layers. New lens fibers are generated from the equatorial cells of the lens epithelium, in a region referred to as the germinative zone. The lens epithelial cells elongate, lose contact with the capsule and epithelium, synthesize crystallin, and then finally lose their nuclei (enucleate) as they become mature lens fibers. From development through early adulthood, the addition of secondary lens fibers results in the lens growing more ellipsoid in shape; after about age 20, however, the lens grows rounder with time and the iris is very important for this development. Several proteins control the embryonic development of the lens: among these, primarily, PAX6, considered the master regulator gene of this organ. Other effectors of proper lens development include the Wnt signaling components BCL9 and Pygo2. ===Variation=== In many aquatic vertebrates, the lens is considerably thicker, almost spherical, to increase the refraction. This difference compensates for the smaller angle of refraction between the eye's cornea and the watery medium, as they have similar refractive indices.Kardong, K. (2008). Vertebrates: Comparative anatomy, function, evolution (5th ed.). (pp. 676‚Äì677). Boston: McGraw-Hill Even among terrestrial animals, however, the lens of primates such as humans is unusually flat. In reptiles and birds, the ciliary body touches the lens with a number of pads on its inner surface, in addition to the zonular fibres. These pads compress and release the lens to modify its shape while focusing on objects at different distances; the zonular fibres perform this function in mammals. In fish and amphibians, the lens is fixed in shape, and focusing is instead achieved by moving the lens forwards or backwards within the eye. In cartilaginous fish, the zonular fibres are replaced by a membrane, including a small muscle at the underside of the lens. This muscle pulls the lens forward from its relaxed position when focusing on nearby objects. In teleosts, by contrast, a muscle projects from a vascular structure in the floor of the eye, called the falciform process, and serves to pull the lens backwards from the relaxed position to focus on distant objects. While amphibians move the lens forward, as do cartilaginous fish, the muscles involved are not homologous with those of either type of fish. In frogs, there are two muscles, one above and one below the lens, while other amphibians have only the lower muscle. In the most primitive vertebrates, the lampreys and hagfish, the lens is not attached to the outer surface of the eyeball at all. There is no aqueous humor in these fish, and the vitreous body simply presses the lens against the surface of the cornea. To focus its eyes, a lamprey flattens the cornea using muscles outside of the eye and pushes the lens backwards. ==Function== ===Accommodation=== An image that is partially in focus, but mostly out of focus in varying degrees. The lens is flexible and its curvature is controlled by ciliary muscles through the zonules. By changing the curvature of the lens, one can focus the eye on objects at different distances from it. This process is called accommodation. At short focal distance the ciliary muscle contracts, zonule fibers loosen, and the lens thickens, resulting in a rounder shape and thus high refractive power. Changing focus to an object at a greater distance requires the relaxation of the lens and thus increasing the focal distance. The refractive index of human lens varies from approximately 1.406 in the central layers down to 1.386 in less dense layers of the lens.Hecht, Eugene. Optics, 2nd ed. (1987), Addison Wesley, . p. 178. This index gradient enhances the optical power of the lens. Aquatic animals must rely entirely on their lens for both focusing and to provide almost the entire refractive power of the eye as the water-cornea interface does not have a large enough difference in indices of refraction to provide significant refractive power. As such, lenses in aquatic eyes tend to be much rounder and harder. === Crystallins and transparency === optical density (OD) of the human crystalline lens for newborn, 30-year-old, and 65-year-old from wavelengths 300-1400 nm. Crystallins are water-soluble proteins that compose over 90% of the protein within the lens. The three main crystallin types found in the human eye are Œ±-, Œ≤-, and Œ≥-crystallins. Crystallins tend to form soluble, high-molecular weight aggregates that pack tightly in lens fibers, thus increasing the index of refraction of the lens while maintaining its transparency. Œ≤ and Œ≥ crystallins are found primarily in the lens, while subunits of Œ± -crystallin have been isolated from other parts of the eye and the body. Œ±-crystallin proteins belong to a larger superfamily of molecular chaperone proteins, and so it is believed that the crystallin proteins were evolutionarily recruited from chaperone proteins for optical purposes. The chaperone functions of Œ±-crystallin may also help maintain the lens proteins, which must last a human for his/her entire lifetime. Another important factor in maintaining the transparency of the lens is the absence of light-scattering organelles such as the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria within the mature lens fibers. Lens fibers also have a very extensive cytoskeleton that maintains the precise shape and packing of the lens fibers; disruptions/mutations in certain cytoskeletal elements can lead to the loss of transparency. The lens blocks most ultraviolet light in the wavelength range of 300‚Äì400 nm; shorter wavelengths are blocked by the cornea. The pigment responsible for blocking the light is 3-hydroxykynurenine glucoside, a product of tryptophan catabolism in the lens epithelium. High intensity ultraviolet light can harm the retina, and artificial intraocular lenses are therefore manufactured to also block ultraviolet light. People lacking a lens (a condition known as aphakia) perceive ultraviolet light as whitish blue or whitish-violet. === Nourishment === The lens is metabolically active and requires nourishment in order to maintain its growth and transparency. Compared to other tissues in the eye, however, the lens has considerably lower energy demands.Whikehart, David R. (2003). Biochemistry of the Eye, 2nd ed. 2003. Philadelphia: Butterworth Heinemann, p. 107‚Äì8 By nine weeks into human development, the lens is surrounded and nourished by a net of vessels, the tunica vasculosa lentis, which is derived from the hyaloid artery. Beginning in the fourth month of development, the hyaloid artery and its related vasculature begin to atrophy and completely disappear by birth.The Eye: Basic Sciences in Practice, p. 104, In the postnatal eye, Cloquet's canal marks the former location of the hyaloid artery. After regression of the hyaloid artery, the lens receives all its nourishment from the aqueous humor. Nutrients diffuse in and waste diffuses out through a constant flow of fluid from the anterior/posterior poles of the lens and out of the equatorial regions, a dynamic that is maintained by the Na+/K+-ATPase pumps located in the equatorially positioned cells of the lens epithelium. Glucose is the primary energy source for the lens. As mature lens fibers do not have mitochondria, approximately 80% of the glucose is metabolized via anaerobic metabolism.Biochemistry of the Eye, 2nd ed, p. 107‚Äì8, The remaining fraction of glucose is shunted primarily down the pentose phosphate pathway. The lack of aerobic respiration means that the lens consumes very little oxygen as well. ==Clinical significance== *Cataracts are opacities of the lens. While some are small and do not require any treatment, others may be large enough to block light and obstruct vision. Cataracts usually develop as the aging lens becomes more and more opaque, but cataracts can also form congenitally or after injury to the lens. Nuclear sclerosis is a type of age-related cataract. Diabetes is another risk factor for cataract. Cataract surgery involves the removal of the lens and insertion of an artificial intraocular lens. *Presbyopia is the age-related loss of accommodation, which is marked by the inability of the eye to focus on nearby objects. The exact mechanism is still unknown, but age-related changes in the hardness, shape, and size of the lens have all been linked to the condition. *Ectopia lentis is the displacement of the lens from its normal position. *Aphakia is the absence of the lens from the eye. Aphakia can be the result of surgery or injury, or it can be congenital. ==Additional images== Image:MRI of human eye.jpgMRI scan of human eye showing lens.

He is well regarded as one of the greatest and most influential basketball players of all time. He played 14 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) at both the shooting guard and point guard positions. Iverson was an 11-time NBA All-Star, won the All-Star game MVP award in 2001 and 2005, and was the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2001. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016. Iverson attended Bethel High School in Hampton, Virginia, and was a dual-sport athlete. He earned the Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both football and basketball, and won the Division 5 AAA Virginia state championship in both sports. After high school, Iverson played college basketball with the Georgetown Hoyas for two years, where he set the school record for career scoring average (22.9 points per game) and won Big East Defensive Player of the Year awards both years. Following two successful years at Georgetown, Iverson declared eligibility for the 1996 NBA draft, and was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the first overall pick. He was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in the 1996‚Äì97 season. A four time scoring champion, winning the NBA scoring title during the 1998‚Äì99, 2000‚Äì01, 2001‚Äì02, and 2004‚Äì05 seasons, Iverson was one of the most prolific scorers in NBA history, despite his relatively small stature (listed at 6 feet, 0 inches, or 183 centimeters). His regular season career scoring average of 26.7 points per game ranks seventh all-time, and his playoff career scoring average of 29.7 points per game is second only to Michael Jordan. Iverson was also the NBA Most Valuable Player of the 2000‚Äì01 season, and led his team to the 2001 NBA Finals the same season. Iverson represented the United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal. Later in his career, Iverson played for the Denver Nuggets, Detroit Pistons, and the Memphis Grizzlies, before ending his NBA career with the 76ers during the 2009‚Äì10 season. He was rated the fifth greatest NBA shooting guard of all time by ESPN in 2008. He finished his career in Turkey with Be≈üikta≈ü in 2011. He returned as a player-coach for 3's Company in the inaugural season of the BIG3. ==Early life== Iverson was born in Hampton, Virginia, to a single 15-year-old mother, Ann Iverson, and was given his mother's maiden name after his father Allen Broughton left her. During his early childhood years in Hampton, Iverson was given the nickname \\"Bubba Chuck\\". A childhood friend, Jaime Rogers, said that Iverson would always look out for the younger kids and that \\"He could teach anybody.\\" When Iverson was 13, father figure Michael Freeman was arrested in front of the teen for dealing drugs. Iverson then failed the eighth grade because of absences and moved to get out of the projects. He attended Bethel High School, where he started as quarterback for the school football team while also playing running back, kick returner, and defensive back. He also started at point guard for the school basketball team. During his junior year, Iverson was able to lead both teams to Virginia state championships, as well as earn The Associated Press High School Player of the Year award in both sports. Iverson played for the Boo Williams AAU basketball team and won the 1992 17-and-under AAU national championship. ===Jail=== On February 14, 1993, Iverson and several of his friends were involved in an altercation with several other patrons at a bowling alley in Hampton, Virginia. Allegedly, Iverson's crowd was raucous and had to be asked to quiet down several times, and eventually, a shouting duel began with another group of youths. Shortly after that, a fight erupted, pitting the white crowd against the black crowd. During the fight, Iverson allegedly struck a woman in the head with a chair. He, and three of his friends, who were also black, were the only people arrested. Iverson, who was 17 at the time, was convicted as an adult of the felony charge of maiming by mob, a rarely used Virginia statute that was designed to combat lynching. Many people around the Virginian area believed the incident to be a product of racial prejudice. The brawl was with a group of white Poquoson High School students. Also, a videotape surfaced of the incident that shows Iverson leaving shortly after the fighting began. Iverson said of the incident: They waited eight months to try Iverson as an adult, and the lead detective lied on the stand about telling Iverson \\"to take pictures\\" when he went down to the courthouse. The court initially said that Iverson maimed three people which is usually a 60-year sentence. Iverson drew a 15-year prison sentence, with 10 years suspended. After Iverson spent four months at Newport News City Farm, a correctional facility in Newport News, he was granted clemency by Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder, and the Virginia Court of Appeals eventually overturned the conviction in 1995 for insufficient evidence. This incident and its impact on the community is explored in the documentary film No Crossover: The Trial of Allen Iverson. \\"They wanted to make an example out of Iverson,\\" said Iverson's high school basketball coach. \\"Only defendants not given bond are capital murderers\\" said James Elleson, Iverson's lawyer. Tom Brokaw and the public played a huge role in the release of Iverson. There were rallies and marches for all four black men that were incarcerated, and Brokaw did a special interview with Iverson from the jail. In this special, Iverson was very apologetic and somber. Brokaw even said, \\"I thought the sentence was surprisingly harsh.\\" Iverson said of his time in prison: The prison sentence forced him to complete his senior year of high school at Richard Milburn High School, a school for at-risk students, instead of competing in sports at Bethel. However, the three years Iverson spent at Bethel were enough to convince Georgetown University head coach John Thompson to come out and meet Iverson, and offer him a full scholarship to join the Georgetown Hoyas basketball team. ==College basketball== In his first season at Georgetown in 1994‚Äì95, Iverson won the Big East Rookie of the Year award and was named to the All Rookie Tournament First Team. That season, Iverson led the Hoyas to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to the North Carolina Tar Heels. In his second and final season at Georgetown in 1995‚Äì96, Iverson led the team to a Big East championship and all the way to the Elite 8 round of the NCAA tournament, where they lost to the Massachusetts Minutemen. He ended his college career as the Hoyas' all-time leader in career scoring average, at 22.9 points per game. Iverson was named as a First Team All American. Iverson was also named the Big East Defensive Player of the Year in his two seasons at Georgetown. Following the conclusion of his sophomore year, Iverson declared for the 1996 NBA draft. He was the first player under Coach Thompson to leave Georgetown early for the NBA. ==Professional career (1996‚Äì2011)== ===Philadelphia 76ers (1996‚Äì2006)=== Early years (1996-2000) Iverson was selected first overall in 1996 After two seasons at Georgetown, Iverson was selected with the 1st overall pick in the 1996 NBA draft to the Philadelphia 76ers. Listed at tall, he became the shortest first overall pick ever, in a league normally dominated by taller players. Iverson came to a Philadelphia team that had just finished the previous season with a dismal 18-64 record. In his NBA debut, Iverson recorded 30 points and 6 assists on a 103-111 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. He tied Willie Anderson for the third highest scoring output by a rookie guard in his debut. On November 12, 1996, Iverson recorded a then career-high of 35 points to go along with 7 rebounds, 6 assists and 2 steals on a 101-97 road win over the Knicks. In a game against the 55-8 Chicago Bulls, Iverson scored 37 points and memorably crossed over Michael Jordan. He broke Wilt Chamberlain's rookie record of three straight games with at least 40 points, doing so in five straight games, including a 50-point effort in Cleveland against the Cavaliers. Averaging 23.5 points per game, 7.5 assists per game and 2.1 steals per game for the season, Iverson was named the NBA Rookie of the Year. Iverson was only able to help the Sixers to a 22‚Äì60 record in 1996‚Äì97. Aided by the arrivals of Theo Ratliff, Eric Snow, Aaron McKie, and new coach Larry Brown, Iverson continued to help the 76ers move forward the following season, as they improved nine games to finish 31-51. The lockout-shortened 1998‚Äì1999 season would mark great improvement for the 76ers. Iverson averaged 26.8 points (which led the league, earning his first scoring title) and was named to his first All NBA first team. The Sixers finished the season at 28-22, earning Iverson his first trip to the playoffs. He started all ten playoff games and averaged 28.5 points per game despite being hampered by a number of nagging injuries. Iverson led the Sixers to an upset over the number three seeded Orlando Magic in four games, before losing to the Indiana Pacers in the second round in six games. Prior to the next season, Iverson signed a six-year, $70 million contract extension. That year, the Sixers would continue to improve under Iverson's leadership, as they finished 49-33, once again qualifying for the playoffs (this time earning the fifth seed, one spot higher than the previous year's sixth seed). In the playoffs, Iverson averaged 26.2 points, 4.8 assists, 4 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. Philadelphia would advance past the Charlotte Hornets in the opening round, but was eliminated by Indiana in the second round in six games for the second straight year. That season, Iverson was selected to the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the first time of what would be 11 straight selections. He was the only player other than Shaquille O'Neal to receive an MVP vote that year. In the 2000 off-season, the 76ers actively tried to trade Iverson after his numerous disagreements with then-coach Larry Brown, and had agreed to terms with the Detroit Pistons before Matt Geiger, who was included in the deal, refused to forfeit his $5 million trade kicker. MVP season and trip to the NBA Finals (2000-01) Iverson attempting a free throw against the Lakers During the 2000‚Äì01 season, Iverson led his team to a franchise record 10-0 start to the season, and was named a starter at the 2001 NBA All-Star Game, where he won the game MVP. The Sixers posted a 56‚Äì26 record on the year, the best in the Eastern Conference that season, earning the top seed. He also averaged a then-career-high 31.1 points, winning his second NBA scoring title in the process. Iverson won the NBA steals title at 2.5 a game. Iverson was named NBA Most Valuable Player; at 6 feet and 165 pounds, he became the shortest and lightest player to win the MVP award. He had 93 first- place votes out of a possible 124.CBS Sports. \\"Six-foot Iverson smallest player to win MVP award \\". CBS Sports. May 15, 2001. Retrieved on December 31, 2008. He was also named to the All NBA First team for his accomplishments. In the playoffs, Iverson and the Sixers defeated the Indiana Pacers in the first round, before meeting Vince Carter-led Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Semifinals. The series went the full seven games. In the next round, the Sixers defeated the Milwaukee Bucks, also in seven games, to advance to the 2001 NBA Finals against the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, featuring the duo of Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal. Iverson led the Sixers to their first finals since their 1983 championship. In game one of the 2001 NBA Finals, Iverson scored a playoff-high 48 points and beat the heavily favored Lakers 107‚Äì101; it was the Lakers' only playoff loss that year. In the game, he notably stepped over Tyronn Lue after hitting a crucial shot. Iverson would go on to score 23, 35, 35, and 37 in games 2‚Äì5, all losing efforts though the Sixers were not swept like many predicted. Iverson enjoyed his most successful season as an individual and as a member of the Sixers during the 2000‚Äì01 NBA season. Iverson began using a basketball sleeve during this season during his recovery from bursitis in his right elbow.Chris Broussard. \\"Now a Leader, Iverson Turns Image Around\\". The New York Times. June 6, 2001. Retrieved on December 31, 2008. Other players, including Carmelo Anthony and Kobe Bryant,Steven Kotler. \\"Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant and Basketball's Placebo effect \\".

Harper Collins, 2003. 9. Iverson continued wearing his sleeve long after his elbow had healed. Some believed that the sleeve improved Iverson's shooting ability. Steven Kotler of Psychology Today suggested that such sleeves may act as a placebo to prevent future injuries. Early playoff exits and Larry Brown's departure (2001-2003) Iverson in 2003 Fresh off their trip to the NBA Finals, Iverson and the Sixers entered the 2001‚Äì2002 season with high expectations, but were plagued by injuries, and only able to muster a 43-39 record to barely get into the playoffs. Despite playing in only 60 games that season and being hampered by injuries, Iverson averaged 31.4 points per game to earn his second consecutive scoring title. The 76ers lost to the Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs 3-2 in the five game series. After the defeat, Brown criticized Iverson for missing team practices. Iverson responded by saying, \\"We're sitting here, I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're in here talking about practice,\\" and went on a rant that included the word \\"practice\\" 14 times. The 2002‚Äì2003 season started off poorly for the Sixers, who had just traded defensive-standout Dikembe Mutombo to New Jersey, and saw a decrease in both offensive and defensive production from Aaron McKie and Eric Snow, all three of whom were key components to their Finals appearance two years prior. Iverson would once again put up stellar scoring numbers (27.6 points per game) however, and the Sixers regrouped following the All-Star break to make the playoffs with a 48-34 record. They were able to defeat Baron Davis and the New Orleans Hornets in the opening round of the playoffs. Iverson later described Davis as the most difficult opposing point guard to defend in his career. In the six-game second round series, the 76ers were eliminated by the Detroit Pistons. Head Coach Larry Brown left the 76ers in 2003, following the playoff loss. After his departure from the 76ers, both he and Iverson indicated that the two were on good terms and genuinely fond of one another. Iverson later reunited with Brown when Iverson became the co- captain of the 2004 United States Olympic men's basketball team. In 2005, Iverson said that Brown was without a doubt \\"the best coach in the world\\". Disappointment and frustration (2003-2006) Randy Ayers became the next coach of the 76ers, but failed to develop any chemistry with his players, and was fired following a 21‚Äì31 start to the season. During the latter part of the 2003‚Äì04 NBA season, Iverson bristled under the disciplinarian approach of the Sixers' interim head coach Chris Ford. This led to a number of contentious incidents, including Iverson being suspended for missing practice, fined for failing to notify Ford that he would not attend a game because he was sick, and refusing to play in a game because he felt \\"insulted\\" that Ford wanted Iverson to come off the bench as he worked his way back from an injury. Iverson missed a then-career-high 34 games in a disastrous season that saw the Sixers miss the postseason for the first time since the 1997 season. The 2004‚Äì2005 season saw Iverson and the Sixers bounce back under the tutelage of new head coach Jim O'Brien, and additions of their first round draft pick Andre Iguodala, and All-Star forward Chris Webber, who was acquired in a mid- season trade. On February 12, 2005, Iverson scored a career-high 60 points on 24-for-27 shooting from the free throw line to go along with 6 assists and 5 steals in a 112-99 win over the Orlando Magic. On April 8, 2005, Iverson recorded 23 points, 7 rebounds and a career-high 16 assists in a 103-98 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers. A rejuvenated Iverson won his fourth NBA scoring title with 31 points and averaged 8 assists for the year, and helped the 76ers climb back into the postseason with a 43-39 record. They would go on to lose to the eventual Eastern Conference champion Detroit Pistons, who were led by Larry Brown, in the first round. In the series, Iverson had three double- doubles, including a 37-point, 15-assist performance in Philadelphia's lone win of the series. Despite O'Brien helping the team back into the postseason, disagreements with players and management led to his firing after just one season. He was replaced by Sixers' legend Maurice Cheeks, in a personnel move Iverson praised, as Cheeks had been an assistant coach with the team when they reached the NBA Finals in 2001. During the 2005‚Äì2006 season, Iverson averaged a career-high 33.0 points per game. The Sixers, however, missed the playoffs for the second time in three years. On April 18, 2006, Iverson and Chris Webber arrived late to the Sixers' fan appreciation night and home game finale. Players were expected to report 90 minutes before game time, but both Iverson and Webber arrived around tipoff. Coach Maurice Cheeks notified the media that neither would be playing, and general manager Billy King announced that Iverson and Webber would be fined. During the 2006 off-season, trade rumors had Iverson going to Denver, Atlanta, or Boston. None of the deals were completed. Iverson had made it clear that he would like to stay a Sixer. Iverson and the Sixers began the 2006‚Äì07 NBA season at 3-0 before stumbling out to a 5-10 record through 15 games. Following the disappointing start, Iverson reportedly demanded a trade from the Sixers (which he denied). As a result, Iverson was told he would not play in any more games. During the following game against the Washington Wizards, which was televised nationally on ESPN, Sixers Chairman Ed Snider confirmed the trade rumors by stating \\"We're going to trade him. At a certain point, you have to come to grips with the fact that it's not working. He wants out and we're ready to accommodate him.\\" Iverson ended his 10-year Philadelphia tenure with the highest scoring average in team history (28.1), and is second all-time on the points list (19,583), and the Sixers did not win another playoff series after his departure until 2012. ===Denver Nuggets (2006-2008)=== Allen Iverson during his tenure with the Denver Nuggets On December 19, 2006, the Philadelphia 76ers sent Iverson and forward Ivan McFarlin to the Denver Nuggets for Andre Miller, Joe Smith, and two first-round picks in the 2007 NBA draft. At the time of the trade, Iverson was the NBA's number two leading scorer, with new teammate Carmelo Anthony being number one. On December 23, 2006, Iverson played his first game for the Nuggets. He had 22 points and 10 assists in a losing effort to the Sacramento Kings. In his first year as a Nugget they made the playoffs. They won the first game and lost the next four to the San Antonio Spurs. Iverson was fined $25,000 by the NBA for criticizing referee Steve Javie following a game between the Nuggets and Iverson's former team, the Philadelphia 76ers, played January 2, 2007. During the game, he committed two technical fouls and was ejected from the game. After the game, Iverson said, \\"I thought I got fouled on that play, and I said I thought that he was calling the game personal I should have known that I couldn't say anything anyway. It's been something personal with me and him since I got in the league. This was just the perfect game for him to try and make me look bad.\\" Former referee Tim Donaghy supported the claim that Javie had a longstanding hatred for Iverson in his book, Personal Foul: A First-Person Account of the Scandal that Rocked the NBA, which a Florida business group published through a self-publishing arm of Amazon.com after it was dropped by a division of Random House, who cited liability issues after reviewing the manuscript. In a December 2009 interview with 60 Minutes, Donaghy said he and fellow referees thought the punishment was too light. Before Iverson's Nuggets played the Utah Jazz on January 6, 2007, Donaghy said he and the two other officials working the game agreed not to give Iverson favorable calls as a way to \\"teach him a lesson.\\" Iverson attempted 12 free throws, more than any other player on either team. On 12 drives to the basket, he drew five fouls, three of which Donaghy whistled himself, and did not receive a call on one play in which Utah's Mehmet Okur clearly fouled him. Iverson returned to Philadelphia on March 19, 2008 to a sell-out crowd and received a standing ovation in a 115‚Äì113 loss. ===Detroit Pistons and Memphis Grizzlies (2008-2009)=== Iverson, as a member of the Pistons On November 3, 2008, Iverson was dealt from the Denver Nuggets to the Detroit Pistons for guard Chauncey Billups, forward Antonio McDyess and center Cheikh Samb. Iverson, who had worn a #3 jersey his entire NBA career, switched to number 1 for the Pistons, which Billups previously wore for the team. Iverson scored at least 24 in four of his first five games with Detroit (they won 3 of the 5), and would score 20 or more with 6 or more assists on a consistent basis, but as the season wore on, he would lose playing time to Rodney Stuckey. Some speculated that Pistons President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars did not envision a long-term role for Iverson on the team, but traded for him to make Stuckey the point guard of the future and free cap space with Iverson's expiring contract. On April 3, 2009, it was announced that Iverson would not play the remainder of the 2008‚Äì09 season. Dumars cited Iverson's ongoing back injury as the reason for his deactivation, although two days prior Iverson stated publicly that he'd rather retire than be moved to the bench as Pistons coach Michael Curry had decided. On September 10, 2009, Iverson signed a one-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies. He stated that \\"God chose Memphis as the place that I will continue my career,\\" and that \\"I feel that they are committed to developing a winner.\\" However, Iverson again expressed his displeasure at being a bench player, and left the team on November 7, 2009 for \\"personal reasons.\\" On November 16, the Grizzlies announced the team terminated his contract by \\"mutual agreement.\\" He played three games for the Grizzlies, averaging 12.3 ppg, 1.3 rpg, and 3.7 apg in 22.3 mpg. ===Return to the 76ers (2009-2010)=== 100px On November 25, 2009, analyst Stephen A. Smith published on his blog a statement attributed to Iverson announcing plans for retirement, which also said, \\"I feel strongly that I can still compete at the highest level.\\" Less than a week later on November 30, Iverson and his representatives met with a Philadelphia 76ers delegation about returning to his former team, and accepted a contract offer two days later. General manager Ed Stefanski declined to go into the terms of the agreement, but an unnamed source told the Associated Press that Iverson agreed to a one-year non-guaranteed contract at the league minimum salary. Iverson would receive a prorated portion of the $1.3 million minimum salary for players with at least 10 years of experience, and the contract would become guaranteed for the remainder of the 2009‚Äì10 season if he remained on the roster on January 8, 2010. Stefanski said the team made the decision to pursue Iverson after starting guard Lou Williams suffered a broken jaw and was expected to miss at least 30 games. On December 7, 2009, Iverson made his return to Philadelphia, garnering a thunderous ovation from the sold-out crowd, in a loss against his former team, the Denver Nuggets. He finished the game with 11 points, 6 assists, 5 rebounds, a steal, and no turnovers. Iverson's first win in his return to Philadelphia came one week later, in a 20-point effort against the Golden State Warriors, ending the Sixers' 12-game losing streak (which stood at 9 games before Iverson returned). He shot 70 percent from the field in the game. On January 3, 2010, he returned to Denver to face the Nuggets; Iverson scored 17 points and had seven assists in the 108-105 win. He was voted as a starter for the All-Star Game for the 11th straight season. He scored a season-high 23 points (on 56% shooting from the field) in a 99-91 loss to Kobe Bryant and the defending champion Lakers. On February 22, 2010, Iverson left the 76ers indefinitely, citing the need to attend to his 4-year-old daughter Messiah's health issues, which he revealed years later as Kawasaki Disease. On March 2, Stefanski announced Iverson would not return to the 76ers for the rest of the season to deal with the personal matter. His final NBA game was a loss against Derrick Rose and the Chicago Bulls on February 20, 2010. ===Be≈üikta≈ü (2010‚Äì2011)=== On October 26, 2010, Yahoo! Sports reported that Iverson agreed in principle to a two-year, $4 million net income contract with Be≈üikta≈ü, a Turkish Super League team competing in the second-tier level of pan-European professional basketball, the EuroCup (the competition below the EuroLeague level). The club announced the signing at a press conference in New York City, on October 29, 2010. Wearing jersey #4, Iverson made his debut for Be≈üikta≈ü on November 16, 2010, in a EuroCup 91-94 loss to Serbian side Hemofarm. Iverson scored 15 points in 23 minutes. Iverson returned to the United States in January 2011 for calf surgery. He only played ten games for Be≈üikta≈ü that season, and did not play professional basketball after that. ===Official retirement=== In January 2013, Iverson received an offer to play for the Texas Legends of the NBA D-League, but he declined. On October 30, 2013, Iverson announced his retirement from basketball, citing he lost his desire to play. At the 76ers 2013‚Äì14 season home opener that night, he received a standing ovation at the beginning of the second quarter. The news conference at which he announced his retirement was attended by former Georgetown coach John Thompson and Sixers great Julius Erving. Iverson said he would always be a Sixer \\"until I die,\\" and that while he always thought the day he retired would be a \\"tough\\" day, he instead stated it was rather a \\"happy\\" day. In November 2013, the 76ers announced that they would officially retire Iverson's number 3 in a special halftime ceremony on March 1, 2014, when the Sixers hosted the Washington Wizards. The ceremony took place in front of 20,000 spectators and 76ers greats such as Julius Erving, Moses Malone, and former team president Pat Croce. He headlined the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Class of 2016 along with Shaquille O'Neal and Yao Ming. Iverson highlighted John Thompson and Larry Brown when speaking to the media on who he credited for a Hall of Fame career. ===BIG3=== In 2017, the creation of the 3-on-3 professional basketball league BIG3 was announced, with Iverson set to be a player and coach on 3's Company. In March, it was announced that Iverson's co-captain would be DerMarr Johnson. 3's Company drafted Andre Owens, Mike Sweetney, and Ruben Patterson during the 2017 BIG3 Draft. On June 25, 3's Company played its first game of the inaugural BIG3 season against the Ball Hogs. In the game, Iverson scored 2 points on 1-for-6 shooting in 9 minutes of play. On only playing 9 minutes, Iverson stated, \\"I signed up to be a coach, player and captain. Coach part is going to go on throughout the game. Playing part is not going to be what you expect. You're not going to see the Allen Iverson of old out there.\\" ==National team career== Iverson during a 2006 game with Barcelona ===1995 World University Games=== Iverson was a member of the USA World University Games Team in Japan in 1995, that included future NBA stars Ray Allen and Tim Duncan, among others. Iverson led all USA players in scoring, assists, and steals, averaging 16.7 points, 6.1 assists, and 2.9 steals per game. He helped lead the team to an undefeated record en route to a 141-81 victory over the host country, Japan, for the gold medal. ===2003 FIBA Americas championship=== Iverson was selected to be part of Team USA for the 2003 FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Puerto Rico in August of that year. USA had a perfect 10‚Äì0 record, and won the gold medal as well as qualifying for a berth in the 2004 Olympics. Iverson started all eight games that he played in, and was second on the team with 14.3 points per game, while also posting 3.8 assists per game, 2.5 rebounds per game, 1.6 steals per game, and shooting 56.2 percent (41‚Äì73 FGs) from the field, 53.6 percent (15‚Äì28 3pt FGs) from 3-point and 81.0 percent (17‚Äì21 FTs) from the foul line. In the USA's 111‚Äì71 victory over Canada on August 25, he accounted for a USA Olympic Qualifying single- game record 28 points and made a single-game record seven 3-pointers. Playing just 23 minutes, he shot 10-for-13 overall, 7-for-8 from the 3-point line, 1-for-1 from the foul line and added three assists, three steals, and one rebound. All seven of his 3-point field goals were made during the final 7:41 of the third quarter. He finished the tournament ranked overall tied for 10th in scoring, tied for fourth in steals, fifth in 3-point percentage, tied for seventh in assists, and ninth in field goal percentage (.562). Iverson also missed the USA's final two games because of a sprained right thumb which was suffered in the first half of the August 28 Puerto Rico game. In a game against Puerto Rico, he recorded 9 points on 4-for-6 shooting from the field overall, and added five assists and three rebounds in 26 minutes of action in the USA's 101‚Äì74 exhibition game victory on August 17 in New York. He was also named to the 2003 USA Senior National Team on April 29, 2003. ==Career statistics== ===NBA=== Regular season -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  76  74  40.1  .418  .341  .702  4.1  7.5  2.1  .3  23.5 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  80  80  39.4  .461  .298  .729  3.7  6.2  2.2  .3  22.0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  48  48  cfecec;\\" 41.5*  .412  .291  .751  4.9  4.6  2.3  .1  cfecec;\\" 26.8* -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  70  70  40.8  .421  .341  .713  3.8  4.7  2.1  .1  28.4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  71  71  42.0  .420  .320  .814  3.8  4.6 cfecec;\\" 2.5*  .3  cfecec;\\" 31.1* -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  60  59  cfecec;\\" 43.7*  .398  .291  .812  4.5  5.5 cfecec;\\" 2.8*  .2  cfecec;\\" 31.4* -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  cfecec;\\"  82*  cfecec;\\" 82* cfecec;\\" 42.5*  .414  .277  .774  4.2  5.5 cfecec;\\" 2.7*  .2  27.6 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  48  47 cfecec;\\" 42.5*  .387  .286  .745  3.7  6.8  2.4  .1  26.4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  75  75  42.3  .424  .308  .835  4.0  7.9  2.4  .1  cfecec;\\" 30.7* -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  72  72 cfecec;\\" 43.1*  .447  .323  .814  3.2  7.4  1.9  .1  33.0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  15  15 cfecec;\\" 42.7*  .413  .226  .885  2.7  7.3  2.2  .1  31.2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Denver  50  49 cfecec;\\" 42.4*  .454  .347  .759  3.0  7.2  1.8  .2  24.8 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Denver  cfecec;\\"  82*  cfecec;\\" 82* cfecec;\\" 41.8*  .458  .345  .809  3.0  7.1  2.0  .1  26.4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Denver  3  3  41.0  .450  .250  .720  2.7  6.7  1.0  .3  18.7 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Detroit  54  50  36.5  .416  .286  .786  3.1  4.9  1.6  .1  17.4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Memphis  3  0  22.3  .577  1.000  .500  1.3  3.7  .3  .0  12.3 -  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  25  24  31.9  .417  .333  .824  3.0  4.1  .7  .1  13.9 -class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=2 Career  914  901  41.1  .425  .313  .780  3.7  6.2  2.2  .2  26.7 -class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=2 All-Star  9  9  26.6  .414  .667  .769  2.6  6.2  2.3  .1  14.4 Playoffs -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 1999  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  8  8  44.8  .411  .283  .712  4.1  4.9  2.5  .3  28.5 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2000  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  10  10  44.4  .384  .308  .739  4.0  4.5  1.2  .1  26.2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2001  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  22  22  46.2  .389  .338  .774  4.7  6.1  2.4  .3  32.9 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2002  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  5  5  41.8  .381  .333  .810  3.6  4.2  2.6  .0  30.0 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2003  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  12  12  46.4  .416  .345  .737  4.3  7.4  2.4  .1  31.7 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2005  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Philadelphia  5  5  47.6  .468  .414  .897  2.2  10.0  2.0  .4 31.2 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2007  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Denver  5  5  44.6  .368  .294  .806  .6  5.8  1.4  .0  22.8 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" 2008  style=\\"text-align:left;\\" Denver  4  4  39.5  .434  .214  .697  3.0  4.5  1.0  .3  24.5 -class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=2 Career  71  71  45.1  .401  .327  .764  3.8  6.0  2.1  .2  29.7 ===College=== -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"1994‚Äì95  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Georgetown  30  29  32.2  .390  .232  .688  3.3  4.5  3.0  .2  20.4 -  style=\\"text-align:left;\\"1995‚Äì96  style=\\"text- align:left;\\"Georgetown  37  37  32.8  .480  .366  .678  3.8  4.7  3.4  .4  25.0 -class=\\"sortbottom\\"  style=\\"text-align:center;\\" colspan=\\"2\\"Career  67  66  32.5  .440  .299  .638  3.6  4.6  3.2  .3  23.0 ==Personal life== Iverson and rap star Nelly at a Reebok photoshoot. During the 2000 offseason, Iverson recorded a rap single called \\"40 Bars\\". However, after being criticized for its controversial lyrics, he eventually was unable to release it. Going under his moniker, Jewelz, the album was alleged to have made derogatory remarks about homosexuals. After criticism from activist groups and NBA Commissioner David Stern, he agreed to change the lyrics, but ultimately never released the album. Iverson had an on- again, off-again relationship with rapper Da Brat. Da Brat claimed she ended the relationship due to Iverson's infidelity. On May 14, 2015, Iverson appeared on CBS This Morning in support of a Showtime Network documentary on his life, Iverson, during which he addressed long-discussed rumors of financial struggles, denying any notion that he was struggling. \\"That's a myth. That's a rumor... The fact that I'm struggling in any part of my life\\", he said. ===Legal troubles=== During the 1997 offseason, Iverson and his friends were stopped by a police officer for speeding late at night. He was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon and for possession of marijuana. He pleaded no contest and was sentenced to community service. In 2002, Iverson was alleged to have thrown wife Tawanna out of their home after a domestic dispute and later threatening two men with a gun while looking for her. All charges against him were later dropped after the judge cited lack of evidence with contradictory statements from witnesses. On February 24, 2004, Iverson urinated in a trash can at Bally's Atlantic City casino and was told by casino management not to return. On December 9, 2005, after the Sixers defeated the Charlotte Bobcats, Iverson paid a late-night visit to the Trump Taj Mahal. After winning a hand at a three-card-stud poker table, Iverson was overpaid $10,000 in chips by a dealer. When the dealer quickly realized the mistake and requested the chips back, Iverson refused, and a heated head-turning argument between him and the casino staff began. Atlantic City casino regulations reportedly state that when a casino makes a payout mistake in favor of the gambler, the gambler must return the money that they did not legitimately win. Also in 2005, Iverson's bodyguard Jason Kane was accused of assaulting a man at a Washington, D. C. nightclub after the man, Marlin Godfrey, refused to leave the club's VIP section so Iverson's entourage could enter. Godfrey suffered a concussion, a ruptured eardrum, a burst blood vessel in his eye, a torn rotator cuff, cuts and bruises, and emotional distress. Although Iverson did not touch Godfrey himself, Godfrey sued Iverson for the injuries caused by his bodyguard. In 2007 a jury awarded Godfrey $260,000. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the verdict in 2009.Iverson's Appeal of Lawsuit Rejected by Federal Appeals Court ESPN.com, March 24, 2009 In August 2011, an Ohio man sued Iverson for $2.5 million in damages, claiming Iverson's security guard assaulted him in a 2009 bar fight in Detroit. The federal judge dismissed the case, finding no evidence that Iverson or his bodyguard struck the plaintiff, Guy Walker. In 2013, Iverson was accused of kidnapping his children and refusing to return them to their mother. He denied the claim and his ex-wife later recanted. ===Marriage and family=== Iverson started dating his high school sweetheart Tawanna Turner when they were 16, and married her at The Mansion on Main Street in Voorhees, New Jersey. They have five children: Tiaura, Allen II, Isaiah, Messiah, and Dream. On March 2, 2010, Tawanna Iverson filed for divorce, seeking custody of their children, as well as child support and alimony payments. According to Iverson, the couple were back together less than a month after the divorce was finalized in 2013. Iverson's cousin, Kuran Iverson, played Division I basketball for the University of Rhode Island and in the NBA G-League, and now plays in New Zealand for the Manawatu Jets. ==Awards and honors== *Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame **Class of 2016 - Individual *NBA Most Valuable Player (2001) *4√ó NBA scoring champion *11√ó NBA All-Star *2√ó NBA All- Star Game MVP *7√ó All-NBA *3√ó NBA steals leader * NBA Rookie of the Year (1997) * No. 3 retired by the Philadelphia 76ers ==Filmography== *Like Mike (2002) ‚Äì as himself *Imagine That (2009) ‚Äì as himself *My Other Home (2017) ==See also== *List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders *List of National Basketball Association career free throw scoring leaders *List of National Basketball Association career assists leaders *List of National Basketball Association career steals leaders *List of National Basketball Association career turnovers leaders *List of National Basketball Association players with most points in a game *List of National Basketball Association players with most steals in a game *List of National Basketball Association single-game playoff scoring leaders *List of National Basketball Association annual scoring leaders *List of National Basketball Association annual minutes leaders ==References== ==External links== * *Eurocup Basketball Profile *Turkish Basketball League Profile *A reflection on Allen Iverson's career *U.S. Olympic Team bio * * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:African-American basketball players Category:African-American male rappers Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:American expatriate basketball people in Turkey Category:American men's basketball players Category:Basketball players at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Basketball players from Virginia Category:Be≈üikta≈ü men's basketball players Category:Big3 coaches Category:Big3 players Category:Denver Nuggets players Category:Detroit Pistons players Category:Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball players Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Memphis Grizzlies players Category:National Basketball Association All-Stars Category:National Basketball Association players with retired numbers Category:Olympic bronze medalists for the United States in basketball Category:Parade High School All-Americans (boys' basketball) Category:Philadelphia 76ers draft picks Category:Philadelphia 76ers players Category:Point guards Category:Shooting guards Category:Sportspeople from Hampton, Virginia Category:United States men's national basketball team players Category:Universiade gold medalists for the United States Category:Universiade medalists in basketball Category:21st-century American rappers Category:Medalists at the 1995 Summer Universiade ","title":"Allen Iverson"},{"id":"305479","text":"Alberto Olmedo (August 24, 1933 ‚Äì March 5, 1988) was an Argentine comedian and actor, popularly regarded as one of the most important comedians in the history of his country, for his outstanding work in television, cinema and theater.http://www.universalmedios.com.ar/efemerides/alberto-olmedo-el-negro- capitan-piluso-2/ Olmedo was born in the city of Rosario. In his teens, he was a gifted gymnast, and an aspiring actor who tried his luck with several amateur theater companies, and enjoyed some local success. Olmedo moved to Buenos Aires in 1954. One year later, while working as a technician in Canal 7, Argentina's first television station, his improvisation skills caught the attention of the management, who gave him acting jobs in several TV shows. While Olmedo had a string of successful children's programs during the 1960s, he gained the most notoriety when given the opportunity to mix slapstick, nonsense, and adult-oriented entertainment. == Film career == Starting with Gringalet in 1959, Olmedo starred in 49 movies, including: Los Doctores las Prefieren Desnudas (Doctors Prefer Them Naked), in 1973, Maridos en Vacaciones, (Husbands on Vacation, 1975), Fot√≥grafo de Se√±oras (Ladies' Photographer, 1978), Las Mujeres Son Cosas de Guapos (Women Are For The Brave, 1981), Los Fierecillos Indomables (The Indomitable Little Beasts, 1982), S√°lvese Quien Pueda (Every Man for Himself, 1984), and Rambito y Ramb√≥n, Primera Misi√≥n (Little Rambo and Big Rambo, First Mission, 1986). His last movie was Atracci√≥n Peculiar, released shortly after his death. Los Fierecillos Indomables had a sequel in 1983. Many of Olmedo's movies in the 1980s were adult-oriented comedies featuring Jorge Porcel and vedettes Moria Cas√°n and Susana Gim√©nez. Conservative Argentine authorities rated these movies as PM-18 (age 18 and above), save for a few tamer films aimed at family audiences. The \\"Olmedo and Porcel\\" movies are considered to be the pinnacle of Argentina's sexploitation movie genre. Most of these movies were directed by Gerardo Sofovich or his brother Hugo, who also directed Olmedo's TV shows El Chupete (The Pacifier) and No Toca Bot√≥n! (Don't Touch That Button!). == TV career == Olmedo's Capit√°n Piluso show was a hit with children in the 1960s, but he preferred working for adult audiences. After acting in the successful Operaci√≥n Ja Ja weekly show, Olmedo landed his first leading role in El Chupete. In 1976, shortly after the beginning of the military dictatorship known as the National Reorganization Process, Olmedo had his own death announced on the show. Once the truth was revealed, the actor was punished for his prank and banished from the airwaves for two years. In the 1980s, No Toca Bot√≥n! was the highest-rated show in Argentina. In fits of improvisation, Olmedo would stray from script, tear down props, dash past the cameras, and verbally abuse his fellow actors. He created popular characters such as General Gonz√°lez, Rucucu the Ukrainian magician, the dictator of Costa Pobre (a parody of a banana republic ruler; its name is a pun on Costa Rica, since the country's name means \\"rich coast\\" and Costa Pobre means \\"poor coast\\"), and above all el Manosanta (\\"the miracle healer\\"), a multi-level parody on charlatans of all stripes and Argentines' reckless pursuit of sex and money. Those years saw the blooming of a partnership with character actor Javier Portales, who provided a counterweight to Olmedo's wild improvising. Olmedo, who was nicknamed el Negro, would evoke his Rosario background by using Rosario slang and narrating implausible stories about his childhood exploits. == Death == Olmedo died in the resort city of Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires Province, on March 5, 1988. According to police reports, he slipped off his eleventh-floor apartment's balcony. It is believed that he tried, possibly under the influence of alcohol or cocaine, to perform a high-wire stunt on the balcony and lost his balance. The only witness to his last moments was girlfriend Nancy Herrera, who was pregnant with his posthumous son Alberto. Olmedo married and divorced twice, and had six children (including Alberto Jr.). He is buried in La Chacarita Cemetery, Buenos Aires. == See also == * Jorge Porcel * Argentine humour ==References== == External links == * * \\"Official\\" home page (in Spanish) * Olmedo Bio (in Spanish) * * An exposition of Olmedo-related art Category:1933 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Argentine comedians Category:Argentine male film actors Category:Argentine male television actors Category:Male actors from Rosario, Santa Fe Category:Accidental deaths from falls Category:Accidental deaths in Argentina Category:Burials at La Chacarita Cemetery Category:20th-century Argentine male actors Category:20th-century comedians ","title":"Alberto Olmedo"},{"id":"305480","text":"__NOTOC__ The following lists events that happened during 1911 in Afghanistan. ==Incumbents== * Monarch ‚Äì Habibullah Khan ==1911-1918== An Afghan nationalist, Mahmud Beg Tarzi, publishes the periodical Seraj ol-Akbar (\\"Torch of the News\\").

Genevieve, St. Louis, Warren, and Washington. It is the metropolitan see to the suffragan sees of the Diocese of Springfield-Cape Girardeau, the Diocese of Jefferson City, and the Diocese of Kansas City-Saint Joseph. It was led from 2009-2020 by Robert James Carlson, the former Bishop of Saginaw, who was named the Archbishop- elect on April 21, 2009, by Pope Benedict XVI, and was installed on June 10, 2009.Tim Townsend, \\"Carlson installed as new leader of St. Louis Roman Catholics.\\" St. Louis Post Dispatch, Jun. 11, 2009. Archbishop Carlson was assisted by Auxiliary Bishop Robert Joseph Hermann, who retired in 2010. Then, Auxiliary Bishop Edward Matthew Rice served from 2010 to 2016, and was in turn replaced by Mark Steven Rivituso, who was appointed in 2017. Carlson's predecessor as Archbishop was Raymond Leo Burke, who transferred to the position of Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura on June 27, 2008. Carlson retired on June 10, 2020, and on that day, Mitchell Thomas Rozanski, the Bishop of Springfield in Massachusetts, was appointed his successor. The archdiocesan cathedral is the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis. The original cathedral and mother church is the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France. ==History== === Early history === The first parish of Saint Louis was established in 1770 and it was incorporated into the Diocese of Louisiana and the Two Floridas when it was erected on April 25, 1793, which originally encompassed the entire Louisiana Purchase as well as the Florida peninsula and the Gulf Coast. This parish is St. Genevieve parish in St. Genevieve Missouri The city of Saint Louis was sold to the United States in 1803. The area's first bishop was Louis William Valentine Dubourg, who on September 24, 1815, was appointed Bishop of Louisiana and the [East and West] Two Floridas by Pope Pius VII. He was the Bishop of the Louisiana Territory from 1815-1826.[Dolan, Timothy Michael. Archdiocese of St. Louis: Three Centuries of Catholicism, 1700-2000. Strasbourg, France: Editions Du Signe, 2001. Print.] Unlike his predecessor, who set up his see in New Orleans, DuBourg chose to set up his episcopal see in St. Louis. === Diocese === After his resignation and transfer to lead the diocese of Montauban, France, the diocese of Louisiana was split, giving New Orleans a bishop again, and the Diocese of St. Louis was erected on July 18, 1826, by Pope Leo XII. When founded, it included the state of Missouri, the western half of Illinois, and all American territory west of the Mississippi River and north of the state of Louisiana. It was the largest American diocese, equaling in extent all of the other nine dioceses. Its first bishop, Joseph Rosati, led the Roman Catholic Church's expansion of its presence in these areas, and built its first cathedral, now known as the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France. He was the Bishop of St. Louis from 1826-1843. On July 28, 1837, territory in Iowa, Minnesota, and the Dakotas was taken from the Diocese to form the Diocese of Dubuque, Iowa. Until 1840, the \\"Old Cathedral\\" was the only church in the city. By 1850, there were 10: Cathedral of St. Louis, St. Mary of Victories, St. Francis Xavier, St. Patrick, St. Joseph, St. Vincent de Paul, St. John the Apostle, Sts. Peter and Paul, Holy Trinity, and St. Michael. === Archdiocese === The St. Louis Diocese was elevated to an Archdiocese on July 20, 1847, by Pope Pius IX. Because of its strong Catholic identity and having been the mother diocese of many dioceses in the midwest, the archdiocese was often referred to as \\"the Rome of the west\\". It is dedicated to Saint Louis IX and has as its copatrons Saints Vincent de Paul and Rose Philippine Duchesne. St. Louis IX, the patron of the archdiocese, represents the ideal Christian knight- a fervent layman, a man of honor and a leader unafraid of exhibiting his ardent spirituality. In 1833 a French laymen answered what the Second Vatican Council calls the universal call to holiness of all Christians. Blessed Frederic Ozanam founded the St. Vincent de Paul Society to serve the poor. The first chapter of the Society in the United States was started in St. Louis in 1845, led by Judge Bryan Mullanphy, who later became mayor of the city of St. Louis. Mother Rose Philippine Duchesne and the Religious of the Sacred Heart opened the first school for girls west of the Mississippi, in St. Charles in 1818. The Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis contains the largest collection of mosaics in the world and is one of St. Louis' most impressive architectural treasures. The Cathedral of St. Louis was dedicated in 1926 on the 100th anniversary of the establishment of St. Louis as a diocese. An imposing structure ‚Äì solid, permanent, huge ‚Äì the building's richly colored interior mosaics are a visual prayer. Built under the direction of Archbishop John Glennon ‚Äì the last Irish- born Bishop of St. Louis ‚Äì and completed under the leadership of Archbishop John May, every impressive inch of the Cathedral is used to tell the story of salvation and the history of the Catholic faith lived in St. Louis. Work on the Cathedral mosaics would not be completed for 60 years. The Cathedral of St. Louis was designated a \\"Basilica\\" in 1997 on the 150th anniversary of the archdiocese. St. Louis Preparatory Seminary in the countryside which is now the St. Louis suburb of Shrewsbury was completed in 1931. Later it became Cardinal Glennon College and in 2015 it is home to 125+ from St. Louis and other dioceses all over the world. Today it is called Kenrick-Glennon Seminary. In January 1999, the archdiocese was host to a two-day visit from Pope John Paul II, the first time a pope had visited the city. It was not John Paul's first visit, since 30 years earlier, he had paid a visit when he was Cardinal Wojty≈Ça, Archbishop of Krak√≥w. ===Sex Abuse=== In July 2019, the Archdiocese of St. Louis released the names of 64 clergy who were \\"credibly accused\\" of committing acts of sex abuse while at the Archdiocese.https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/st-louis-archdiocese- names-priests-credibly-accused-of-sexually- abusing/article_448215a2-c284-5395-b695-a5bbb64e5bef.html On August 16, 2019, \\"sexually violent priest\\" Frederick Lenczycki, who had previously served prison time in Illinois between 2004 and 2009 for acts of sex abuse,https://www.dailyherald.com/news/20190422/judge-denies-lower-bond-for- former-hinsdale-priest- was sentenced to 10 years in prison two-and-a-half months after pleading guilty to sexually abusing a boy in St. Louis County. ==Bishops== The following is a list of the bishops and archbishops of St. Louis, and coadjutors and auxiliary bishops of St. Louis; and their years of service. ===Ordinaries=== ;Bishop of Louisiana and the Floridas # Louis- Guillaume-Valentin Dubourg (1812-1826), appointed Bishop of Montauban and later Archbishop of Besan√ßon ;Bishops of St. Louis # Joseph Rosati, C.M.

In 2011, it was ranked 10th in QSR Magazine rankings of the top 50 quick-service and fast-casual restaurant brands in the nation (moving to 13th for 2015 and 2016). Known for its use of carhops on roller skates, the company annually hosts a competition (in most locations) to determine the top skating carhop in its system. ==Company profile== Although Sonic has operated since the early 1950s, Sonic Corp. incorporated in Delaware in 1990. It has its corporate headquarters in Oklahoma City; the headquarters building features a dine-in Sonic restaurant in an adjacent building. Prior to its acquisition by Inspire Brands, its stock traded on NASDAQ with the symbol SONC. Most restaurants are owned and operated by franchisees. Total 2016 revenues were around $100 million with net income of $18 million. == Products == The Jr. Deluxe Burger, a value menu item Sonic's menu consists of hamburgers and French fries, as well as onion rings, corn dogs, chili dogs, and breakfast toaster sandwiches. Drink options include soft drinks, slushes, and milkshakes. Customers can combine various drinks and flavors to create thousands of possible drink combinations. Ice cream desserts include sundaes and floats. A Sonic Drive-in at night in 2007 At a standard Sonic Drive-In, a customer drives into a covered drive-in stall, orders through an intercom speaker system, and has the food delivered by a carhop. Most drive-ins also have patio seating, and many have drive-through lanes. ==History== Following World War II, Sonic founder Troy N. Smith Sr. returned to his hometown of Seminole, Oklahoma, where he became employed as a milkman. He decided to work delivering bread because bread is lighter than milk. Soon afterwards, Smith purchased the Cottage Cafe, a little diner in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Before long, he sold it and opened a fast food restaurant, Troy's Pan Full of Chicken, on the edge of town. In 1953, Smith joined with a business partner to purchase a five-acre parcel of land that had a log house and a walk-up root beer stand named the Top Hat. The two continued operating the root beer stand and converted the log house into a steak restaurant. After realizing that the stand was averaging $700 a week in the sale of root beer, hamburgers, and hot dogs, Smith decided to focus on the more-profitable root beer stand. He bought out his business partner. Originally, Top Hat customers parked their automobiles anywhere on the gravel parking lot and walk up to place orders. In Louisiana, Smith saw a drive-in that used speakers for ordering. He suspected that he could increase his sales by controlling the parking and having the customers order from speakers at their cars, with carhops delivering the food to the cars. Smith borrowed several automobiles from a friend who owned a used-car lot to establish a layout for controlled parking. He also had some so-called \\"jukebox boys\\" wire an intercom system in the parking lot. Sales immediately tripled. Charles Woodrow Pappe, an entrepreneur, saw the Shawnee drive-in and was impressed. He and Smith negotiated the first franchise location in Woodward, Oklahoma, in 1956, based on a handshake. By 1958, two more drive-ins were built, in Enid and Stillwater. Sonic Drive-In neon sign at the Oklahoma History Center Upon learning that the Top Hat name was already trademarked, Smith and Pappe changed the name to Sonic in 1959. The new name worked with their existing slogan, \\"Service with the Speed of Sound\\". After the name change, the first Sonic sign was installed at the Stillwater Top-Hat Drive-In. This was the first of three Sonics in Stillwater. The original Sonic with the first sign was demolished and renovated in May 2015. Although Smith and Pappe were being asked to help open new franchise locations, no real royalty plan was in place. The pair decided to have their paper company charge an extra penny for each Sonic-label hamburger bag it sold. The proceeds would then be split between Smith and Pappe. The first franchise contracts under this plan were drawn up, but still no joint marketing plan, standardized menu, or detailed operating requirements were in place. ===1960s and 1970s=== A Sonic Drive-In stand at the Lamar County Historical Museum Sonic's founders formed Sonic Supply as a supply and distribution division in the 1960s. Under Smith, longtime franchise holders Marvin Jirous and Matt Kinslow were hired to run the division. In 1973, Sonic Supply was restructured as a franchise company that was briefly named Sonic Systems of America. It provided franchisees with equipment, building plans and basic operational instructions. As the company grew into a regionally-known operation during the 1960s and 1971s, the drive-ins were mainly in small towns in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, New Mexico, Missouri, and Arkansas. In 1967, the year Pappe died, the brand had 41 drive-ins. By 1972, this number had risen to 165, and by 1978, . In 1968, Sonic introduced the Pickle-O's, fried pickle slices. In 1977, the company established the Sonic School for manager training. Franchisees operated most of the drive-ins and often made the store manager a business partner, even to this day. ===1980s and 1990s=== In 1983, the company's board of directors hired C. Stephen Lynn as president. In 1984, Lynn hired attorney J. Clifford Hudson to head the legal department. Under Lynn, Sonic and its major franchisees began to encourage the development of local-advertising cooperatives, under the leadership of Keith Sutterfield as advertising manager and later as VP of marketing in which Sutterfield developed a field structure to work with the franchisees. New franchises began to expand the company into new areas and redevelop markets that had been unsuccessful in the past. These developments, combined with a major advertising campaign featuring singer and actor Frankie Avalon, led to significant growth and a new image that made Sonic a nationally recognized name. In 1986, Lynn, with a group of investors, completed a $10-million leveraged buyout and took the company private. The next year, Sonic moved its offices to leased space in downtown Oklahoma City and began to assume a higher profile in the community. In 1991, Sonic became a publicly traded company again. By 1994, the corporation had renegotiated the franchise agreements with its franchisees. In 1995, Hudson became president and chief executive officer, and Sonic Industries became Sonic Corp.Executive Team Member Profile: J. Clifford Hudson. Official Sonic Web Site, America's Drive- in Brand Properties LLC. During the mid-1990s, Sonic opened 100‚Äì150 new restaurants a year. Beginning in 1998, Sonic began a retrofit program, called \\"Sonic 2000\\", to redesign and update all stores in its chain to what was called a \\"retro-future\\" look. ===2000s=== Hudson was named chairman of Sonic Corp. in January 2000. Celebrating its 50th birthday in 2003, Sonic briefly added the Birthday Cake Shake to the menu. As a part of the anniversary celebration, Pickle-O's made another appearance as a recurring item. Development milestones celebrated in the 2000s include the opening of the th Sonic Drive-In in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and the th Sonic Drive-In in the Chicago market (Algonquin, Illinois). In October 2004, President Pattye Moore stepped down to spend more time with her family. On June 28, 2005, helped by new menu items and increased advertising exposure, Sonic Corp. reported double-digit increases in net income and revenue in the third quarter that year. On January 5, 2005, the company started to install card readers in the drive-in stalls at its 544 company-owned restaurants by the end of January that year. In 2007, the company opened its first restaurants in the Northeastern United States, in Waretown, New Jersey. In 2009, Sonic partnered with DonorsChoose.org on a collaborative effort, Limeades for Learning, the chain's first systemwide cause marketing initiative. Public school teachers request needed supplies and materials and Sonic customers vote on how to allocate over $500,000 each autumn. In the first seven years of the program, Sonic and its franchisees donated more than $6 million and impacted learning for more than 349,000 students nationwide. In September 2009, Omar Janjua joined the company as president of its restaurant operating subsidiary, Sonic Restaurants, Inc. and left in 2015. Despite growth into new markets outside their traditional footprint, the company was hit hard by the recession of 2008‚Äì2009. In 2009, the brand had multiple quarters of declines in same-store sales. Plans to bring Sonic to Alaska had not yet come to fruition.Staff writer (September 18, 2009). \\"Sonic Declares Preliminary Earnings\\" . Zacks Equity Research via Yahoo! Finance. Accessed 2009-10-16. On October 26, 2015, Sonic opened its first Rhode Island location in Smithfield, reporting to have received 500 orders on its opening day. In the mid-2010s, the company began a refranchising effort and began to add to its numbers of stores again. ===2010s=== In January 2010, Sonic announced that they would begin switching to cage-free eggs, gestation crate-free pork, and chickens killed using controlled-atmosphere stunning methods instead of traditional shackling and water-stunning. Sonic reformulated its soft-serve ice cream to meet the FDA guidelines that define what constitutes real ice cream and introduced Real Ice Cream on May 17, 2010. Several new hot dog items were also introduced in June 2010 and February 2011. Craig Miller was hired as chief information officer in January 2012. In June 2010, Danielle Vona was hired as chief marketing officer. In late 2010, Sonic announced the end of its 17-year relationship with advertising agency Barkley. A group of specialized agencies was selected to represent the company, and in early 2011, the San Francisco-based Goodby Silverstein and Partners was named as the new creative agency for the company. In 2017, Sonic announced it would be adding seven new stores in Hawaii in the near future. On September 25, 2018, Atlanta-based Inspire Brands, owner of Arby's and Buffalo Wild Wings, announced that it was buying Sonic Drive-In for $2.3 billion. The acquisition was completed on December 7, 2018. In September 2017, Sonic opened its first location in Alaska in Wasilla, and a year later it opened its second Alaska location in Fairbanks. ==Employee relations== In February 2019, employees of three Ohio locations resigned en masse due to management changes and a 50% reduction of the employee hourly pay rate. Sonic later released a statement that no employee wages were changing. As of 2019, Sonic carhops are still not able to receive tips from customers paying by credit or debit card. Tips can only be paid in cash, though carhops make less than minimum wage. A petition on Change.org started in 2017 garnered over 33,000 signatures, but no change was made to Sonic's policy. ==Sonic Beach== Sonic Beach logo In June 2011, the first location under the name Sonic Beach was opened in Homestead, Florida. A second location, opened in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in November 2011, lacked drive-in stalls due to its beach-side location. Both locations included outdoor seating and flatscreen televisions, but have since closed. A third location was opened in Miami Gardens. The fourth location was opened January 2014 in Lauderhill. Along with the traditional menu items, Sonic Beach offered several new items, including popcorn shrimp, Philly cheesesteaks, and pulled pork sandwiches. Sonic Beach serves beer and wine. Remaining locations have been rebranded under the traditional Sonic name, although retaining the Sonic Beach logo. ==Advertising== Sonic ran its first television advertisement in 1977. During the early 1980s, actor Tom Bosley was featured in the company's commercials. One of the company's most memorable advertising campaigns, which ran from 1987 to 1993, featured Frankie Avalon. In May 1999, the company began a new campaign featuring the character Katie the Carhop. Sonic was also involved with NASCAR. The company contracted with Richard Childress Racing in late 2000 to be an associate sponsor for Dale Earnhardt, Sr. during the 2001 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season. After Earnhardt was killed on the last lap of the Daytona 500, the company continued its sponsorship with his replacement driver Kevin Harvick, through the end of the 2003 season. Sonic returned to NASCAR several years later to sponsor Sam Hornish, Jr and Richard Petty Motorsports in 2015. In 2004, the company became more widely known nationally by advertising in television markets hundreds of miles from its nearest franchise. Improvisational actors T. J. Jagodowski and Peter Grosz became known to American television viewers from their \\"Two Guys\\" series of commercials. Similar series of ads for the company have featured other duos of improvisational performers, including Molly Erdman and Brian Huskey, Katie Rich and Sayjal Joshi, and Emily Wilson and Tim Baltz. In 2010, national auditions were held and a new series of commercials began airing, some of which featured carhops from Wisconsin and Austin, Texas. In 2012 the \\"Two Guys\\" returned to the company's television ads. In 2018 Sonic supplemented their \\"Two Guys\\" commercials with complementary \\"Two Gals\\" commercials. The \\"Two Gals\\" are played by Ellie Kemper and Jane Krakowski. In 2020, Sonic shifted their \\"Two Guys\\" campaign to a new campaign known as \\"Everyday People\\" with the same formula but with families instead of guys. Slogans used by Sonic over the years include: * \\"Service With the Speed of Sound\\" (1958) * \\"Happy Eating\\" (1980s: on signs at many of the company's drive-ins) * \\"America's Drive-In\\" (1987) * \\"Faster and Better than Ever\\" (1988‚Äì1990) * \\"No Place Hops like Sonic\\" (1990‚Äì1993) * \\"Summer's Funner\\" (1993) * \\"Drive-In for a Change\\" (1995‚Äì1997) * \\"All Summer Long\\" (1997) * \\"It's Sonic Good\\" (2003-2005) * \\"Sonic's Got It, Others Don't\\" (2007) * \\"Even Sweeter After Dark\\" (2009) * \\"This is How You Sonic\\" (2011‚Äì2020) * \\"Sonic Everywhere\\" (2016) * \\"You Guys Wanna Hang Out Sometime\\" (2016) * ‚ÄúThis Is How We Sonic‚Äù (2020) ==See also== * List of hamburger restaurants ==References== ==External links== * Category:Companies based in Oklahoma City Category:Restaurants established in 1953 Category:Drive-in restaurants Category:Fast-food chains of the United States Category:Fast-food franchises Category:Fast-food hamburger restaurants Category:Hot dog restaurants Category:Restaurants in Oklahoma Category:Companies formerly listed on NASDAQ Category:Restaurant chains in the United States Category:1953 establishments in Oklahoma Category:1991 initial public offerings Category:2018 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"Sonic Drive-In"},{"id":"305495","text":":For Wikipedia guidelines for capitalization, see Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters.

Prior to this he served as an officer of the Confederate States Army who commanded an Arkansas mounted rifle regiment in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. == Early life and education == Harris Flanagin was born in Roadstown, New Jersey, to James, an undertaker and furniture dealer, and Mary (n√©e Harris) Flanagin. He received a fairly good education in a Quaker school of New Jersey and then went to teach at Clermont Seminary, near Frankford (present-day Philadelphia), Pennsylvania. Soon after this he moved to Illinois where he again tried teaching and while at this work studied law. In 1837 he moved to Arkansas and operated a law office in Greenville, the county seat of Clark County, but later moved to Arkadelphia, the new county seat. He served in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1842 to 1844. He was married on July 3, 1851, to Martha Eliza Nash.Newberry, Farrar. \\"Harris Flanagin.\\" Arkansas Historical Quarterly 17 (Spring 1955): 3‚Äì20. == American Civil War == During the American Civil War, Flanagin served in the Confederate States Army as a captain and rose to the rank of colonel before the conflict was over. He served with the 2d Arkansas Mounted Rifles. In 1862, he was elected Governor of Arkansas and was recalled from active duty to take office. His administration dealt primarily with war related measures and maintaining order and continuing government while undergoing an invasion. His administration was faced with shortages of critical items, rising prices, care of fallen soldier's families, and related problems. During the war the government was forced to suspend the collection of taxes and financed the war with paper \\"war bonds\\".

He broke the existing record by a margin of 55 cm and his world record stood for almost 23 years until it was broken in 1991 by Mike Powell. , the jump is still the Olympic record and the second longest wind legal jump in history. ==Early life== Robert Beamon was born in South Jamaica, Queens, New York, and grew up in the New York Housing Authority's Jamaica Houses. When he was attending Jamaica High School he was discovered by Larry Ellis, a renowned track coach. Beamon later became part of the All-American track and field team. Beamon began his college career at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, to be close to his ill grandmother. After her death, he transferred to the University of Texas at El Paso, where he received a track and field scholarship.Williams, Lena. \\"TRACK AND FIELD; Soothing an Old Ache\\", The New York Times, January 1, 2000. Accessed November 7, 2007. In 1965 Beamon set a national high school triple jump record and was second in the nation in the long jump. In 1967 he won the AAU indoor title and earned a silver medal at the Pan American Games, both in the long jump.Bob Beamon . sports-reference.com Beamon was suspended from the University of Texas at El Paso for participating in a boycott of competition with Brigham Young University because of the Book of Mormon's teachings on race.Lena Williams, \\"Track and Field; Soothing an Old Ache\\", The New York Times, January 1, 2000.Jack Olsen, The black athlete: a shameful story, pp 65-76.

Fellow Olympian Ralph Boston became his unofficial coach.Bob Beamon Biography at thehistorymakers.comCraig Collisson, The BSU takes on BYU and the UW Athletics Program, 1970 ==1968 Summer Olympics== alt=Beamon leaping Beamon entered the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City as the favorite to win the gold medal, having won 22 of the 23 meets he had competed in that year, including a career best of 8.33 m (equivalent to 27 feet 4 inches) and a world's best of 8.39 m that was ineligible for the record books due to excessive wind assistance. That year he won the AAU and NCAA indoor long jump and triple jump titles, as well as the AAU outdoor long jump title. He came close to missing the Olympic final, overstepping on his first two attempts in qualifying. With only one chance left, Beamon re-measured his approach run from a spot in front of the board and made a fair jump that advanced him to the final. There he faced the two previous gold-medal winners, American Ralph Boston (1960) and Lynn Davies of Great Britain (1964), and twice bronze medallist Igor Ter-Ovanesyan of the Soviet Union. alt=Beamon smiling On October 18, Beamon set a world record for the long jump with a first jump of 8.90 m , bettering the existing record by 55 cm . When the announcer called out the distance for the jump, Beamon‚Äîunfamiliar with metric measurements‚Äîstill did not realize what he had done. When his teammate and coach Ralph Boston told him that he had broken the world record by nearly two feet, his legs gave way and an astonished and overwhelmed Beamon suffered a brief cataplexy attack brought on by the emotional shock, and collapsed to his knees, his body unable to support itself, placing his hands over his face. The defending Olympic champion Lynn Davies told Beamon, \\"You have destroyed this event\\", and in sports jargon, a new adjective ‚Äì Beamonesque ‚Äì came into use to describe spectacular feats.IOC Athlete Profile, ‚Äì \\"His achievement inspired a new word in the English language: Beamonesque, meaning an athletic feat so dramatically superior to previous feats that it overwhelms the imagination.\\" Prior to Beamon's jump, the world record had been broken thirteen times since 1901, with an average increase of 6 cm and the largest increase being 15 cm (6 in.). In the years following the jump, the mark was considered unbeatable. It took 12 years for another human being to jump 28 feet, much less 29.https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1980/07/29/mennea-nips-wells- in-olympic-drama/e50ae96a-45ef-4eed-b21b-8e3eef581d25/ His world record stood for 23 years until it was finally broken in 1991 when Mike Powell jumped 8.95 m at the World Championships in Tokyo, but Beamon's jump is still the Olympic record and years later remains the second-longest wind-legal jump in history. One journalist called Beamon \\"the man who saw lightning\\". Sports journalist Dick Schaap wrote a book about the leap, The Perfect Jump. Beamon landed his jump near the far end of the sand pit, but the optical device which had been installed to measure jump distances was not designed to measure a jump of such length. This forced the officials to measure the jump manually which added to the jump's aura. Beamon's world-record jump was named by Sports Illustrated magazine as one of the five greatest sports moments of the 20th century. ==Later life== Shortly after the Mexico City Olympics, Beamon was drafted by the Phoenix Suns in the 15th round of the 1969 NBA draft but never played in an NBA game. In 1972 he graduated from Adelphi University with a degree in sociology. Beamon has worked in a variety of roles to promote youth athleticism, including collaborations with former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Beamon's work at the athletic programs of several universities. He is a graphic artist with work exhibited by the Art of the Olympians (AOTO), and was the former chief executive of the Art of the Olympians Museum in Fort Myers, Florida. ==Honors== Beamon is in the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, and when the United States Olympic Hall of Fame started to induct athletes in 1983, Beamon was one of the first inductees.

Avalon had 31 charting U.S. Billboard singles from 1958 to late 1962, including the number one hits \\"Venus\\" and \\"Why\\" in 1959. == Life and career == === Early life and music === Avalon was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Mary and Nicholas Avallone. In December 1952, Avalon made his American network television debut playing the trumpet in the Honeymooners \\"Christmas Party\\" sketch on The Jackie Gleason Show. Two singles showcasing Avalon's trumpet playing were issued on RCA Victor's \\"X\\" sublabel in 1954. His trumpet playing was also featured on some of his LP songs as well. As a teenager he played with Bobby Rydell in Rocco and the Saints. In 1959, \\"Venus\\" (5 weeks #1) and \\"Why\\" went to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Why\\" was the last #1 of the 1950s. Avalon had 31 charted U.S. Billboard singles from 1958 to late 1962, including \\"Just Ask Your Heart\\" (U.S. #7), \\"I'll Wait for You\\" (U.S. #15), \\"Bobby Sox to Stockings\\" (U.S. #8), and \\"A Boy Without a Girl\\" (U.S. #10). He was less popular in the U.K., but did still manage four chart hits with \\"Why\\", \\"Ginger Bread\\", \\"Venus\\" and \\"Don't Throw Away All Those Teardrops\\". Most of his hits were written and/or produced by Bob Marcucci, head of Chancellor Records. === Film and TV career === Avalon and Annette Funicello during the \\"Beach Party\\" era Avalon's first film was a short appearance in Jamboree (1957), playing a trumpet and singing \\"Teacher's Pet\\". In the late 1950s, teen idols were often given roles in films, supporting older male stars in order to attract a younger audience, such as Ricky Nelson in Rio Bravo (1959). Alan Ladd's daughter was a Frankie Avalon fan, who recommended that he co-star with her father in the Western Guns of the Timberland (1960). Avalon sings two songs, \\"The Faithful Kind\\" and \\"Gee Whiz Whillikins Golly Gee\\"; both were released as singles. Ladd announced he would reteam Avalon and his daughter in Six Steps to Freedom but the film was never made. Rushes for Timberland were seen by John Wayne, who was looking for a young actor to play the (fictitious) role of \\"Smitty\\" in his passion project, The Alamo (1960). Avalon was cast in his second dramatic part. After making the film Wayne told the press \\"We're not cutting one bit of any scene in which Frankie appears. I believe he is the finest young talent I've seen in a long time.\\" \\"Mr Wayne said I was natural as far as acting goes,\\" said Avalon. He added, \\"My ambition when I was ten years old was to have my own band like Harry James. I never expected anything like this... I'd like to be identified as a singer, dancer and actor. I don't want to be just one thing.\\" \\"I like to appeal to teenagers and adults,\\" he said in 1960. \\"Everybody\\". Avalon was now in demand as an actor. He provided the singing voice for the lead character in the English-language version of a Japanese musical anime, Alakazam the Great (1960), which was done at the behest of the US distributor, American International Pictures ‚Äì the first in what would be a long association with that company. For Irwin Allen, Avalon had a small role and sang the title song in the science fiction adventure film, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961), a solid hit. He had a support role in a comedy, Sail a Crooked Ship (1961). ===AIP association=== Avalon was teamed with Ray Milland in the science fiction film, Panic in Year Zero! (1962), written by Lou Rusoff. Samuel Z. Arkoff of American International Pictures (AIP) said Avalon and Milland were teamed together because \\"they both have particular types of followers and the combination adds up to an attraction.\\" For AIP, Avalon made a war movie with Tab Hunter, Operation Bikini (1963), singing a few songs in flashback. At MGM he played the lead in an adventure film set in Africa, Drums of Africa (1963). Of more significance for Avalon's career was a project originally written by Rusoff, Beach Party (1963). This cheerful musical comedy starred Annette Funicello and was directed by William Asher; Arkoff said AIP originally wanted Fabian Forte to co-star with Funicello, but when he proved unavailable they went with Avalon. It was a big hit and led to several sequels. Avalon received an offer to appear in a swashbuckler set in 10th century Spain about Fern√°n Gonz√°lez of Castile, The Castilian (1963), then was in the first Beach Party sequel, Muscle Beach Party (1963). It was popular; even more so was Bikini Beach (1964), where Avalon had a dual role. In August 1964 Avalon announced he signed to make ten films in five years for AIP. Pajama Party (1964) was unofficially the fourth in the series; it was a science fiction spoof in which Avalon ceded leading man duties to Tommy Kirk, but had a cameo. He was back as leading man in Beach Blanket Bingo (1965). Avalon later recalled, \\"'That's the picture of mine that I think people remember best, and it was just a lot of kids having a lot of fun -- a picture about young romance and about the opposition of adults and old people... It was also fun because we got to learn how to fake skydive out of an airplane.\\" Avalon appeared in nearly two dozen TV episodes, including ABC's The Bing Crosby Show and The Patty Duke Show, appearing often as himself. Later, he became a national television spokesperson for Sonic Drive-In. In 1965 he appeared in the Combat! episode \\"Brother, Brother\\" as a childhood friend of Pfc. Kirby, played by Jack Hogan. Avalon and Tuesday Weld supported Bob Hope in a comedy, I'll Take Sweden (1965) for Edward Small. For AIP he teamed with Dwayne Hickman in a rip off of Some Like It Hot (1959), Ski Party (1965). That studio gave him the lead in a service comedy, Sergeant Deadhead (1965), playing another dual role. All this activity meant he was reluctant to appear in another \\"beach party\\" movie, so he let Hickman play the lead in How to Stuff a Wild Bikini (1965), although Avalon had a cameo. The box office performance of these last few films were disappointing ‚Äì especially Sergeant Deadhead, for which sequels had been planned. More popular was Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine (1965), a comedy with Vincent Price and Hickman, for AIP. This was liked enough to justify a sequel, although Avalon did not appear, Fabian Forte taking over. In January 1966, Avalon said he no longer wanted to make beach films. \\"Even a seagull leaves the beach from time to time and I'm getting a little sick of sand,\\" he said. AIP tried to find a new formula for Avalon, and cast him as a stock car driver in Fireball 500 (1966), alongside Fabian and Funicello, for director William Asher. It was a medium success, and led to other AIP stock car movies, though none with Avalon. For Harry Alan Towers he played the lead in The Million Eyes of Sumuru (1967), and had a good part in Skidoo (1968), a comedy from Otto Preminger. In England he was in The Haunted House of Horror (1968) for AIP. ===1970s and 1980s=== In 1976, Avalon updated his song \\"Venus\\" with a new disco treatment. Materializing as a character called Teen Angel, his performance of \\"Beauty School Dropout\\" in the hit 1978 film of the musical Grease introduced Avalon to a new generation of viewers. The 1980 film The Idolmaker, written by Ed Di Lorenzo and directed by Taylor Hackford, was a thinly-disguised biography of Avalon (\\"Tommy Dee\\" in the film) as well as 1950s teenage star Fabian Forte (called \\"Caesare\\" in the film), along with songwriter/producer Bob Marcucci (called \\"Vinnie Vacarri\\"). In the film, Dee clashes with the record producer and younger singer Caesare, who he feels threatens his career. Eventually, Dee and Caesare quit the label, but their record careers collapse just as the British Invasion begins. The real Fabian threatened a lawsuit, despite the filmmakers' insistence that the film presented only fictional characters (though Marcucci was a paid consultant). Avalon denied most of the film's events. In 1980 Avalon appeared in the film Blood Song as Paul Foley, a serial killer. The movie was shot in October - November 1980 in North Bend / Coos Bay, Oregon. It was released in October 1982. He also appeared in the \\"Happy Days\\" episode \\"Poobah Doo Dah\\" playing himself where he sings his hits \\"Venus\\" and \\"Why\\". Avalon had the idea of returning to beach party films with Funicello. He hired several screenwriters and shopped the screenplay around town, eventually managing to set up the project at Paramount Pictures. Back to the Beach (1987) was a moderate success. In 1989, Avalon and Funicello appeared as themselves in cameo roles, out jogging the streets in Troop Beverly Hills. Not long afterward Funicello retired, having been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. ===Later career=== Avalon then turned to marketing and created Frankie Avalon Products, a line of health and cosmetic aids. He promoted his products on the Home Shopping Network with host Bob Circosta. Avalon made a cameo appearance as himself with Robert De Niro in the 1995 film, Casino. In recent years, Avalon has starred in stage productions of Grease in the role of Teen Angel and in Tony n' Tina's Wedding as a caricature of himself. Additionally, in 2007, he performed \\"Beauty School Dropout\\" with the four remaining female contenders (Kathleen Monteleone, Allie Schulz, Ashley Spencer, and winner Laura Osnes) for the role of Sandy on the NBC television reality show Grease: You're the One that I Want! On April 8, 2009, Avalon performed on American Idol. As part of a long- running concert tour, Avalon has toured with fellow Philadelphian early 60s teen idols Fabian and Bobby Rydell under the banner \\"Dick Fox's Golden Boys\\". A cookbook with over 80 recipes from St. Martin's Press, Frankie Avalon's Italian Family Cookbook, was published in 2015. == Personal life == Avalon married Kathryn \\"Kay\\" Diebel on January 19, 1963. She was a former beauty pageant winner, and Avalon met her while playing cards at a friend's house. He told his friend that Kay was the girl he was going to marry. His agent warned Avalon that marriage would spoil his teen idol mystique. They have eight children ‚Äì Frankie Jr., Tony, Dina, Laura, Joseph, Nicolas, Kathryn and Carla ‚Äì and 10 grandchildren. Frankie Avalon Jr. is a former actor who appeared in the original The Karate Kid and is now a musician, and Tony, the second-eldest son, plays guitar and taught at the Rock Nation School. Both sons play on tour with their father. In 1963, Avalon had to fight a paternity suit. == Legacy == Avalon performing in 1960 Avalon was mentioned in the System of a Down song \\"Old School Hollywood\\". The song supposedly is about Daron Malakian's experience in a celebrity baseball game, where he and Avalon were both ignored. Avalon is also mentioned in \\"It Takes Two\\", a song from the hit musical Hairspray, sung by the character Link Larkin, and in a song by the Wu- Tang Clan called \\"The City\\" which refers to his experiences of being a big part of the beach party film genre (\\"Ride the wave like Frankie Avalon\\"). One of numerous obscure cultural references present in Midway's video game Mortal Kombat 3 was a lo-res image of Frankie Avalon's face that would dart up in the lower right-hand corner of the screen when Goro killed his opponent by knocking him into the spike pit on the Bridge level. His song \\"Venus\\" was featured in Cranium Command (1989‚Äì2005), an attraction at Epcot's Wonders of Life Pavilion (now closed) at Walt Disney World. In the attraction, a 12-year- old boy named Bobby (Scott Curtis), tries to survive the pressures of life and falls in love with a beautiful girl named Annie (Natalie Gregory) at school. Avalon in 1976 Avalon and his song \\"Venus\\" are mentioned in Wendy Wasserstein's 2005 play Third. The main character, English professor Laurie Jameson, watches a PBS reunion show featuring Avalon singing the song, and sings a line of it to her daughter. In stage productions of the show, part of the song is played and a portion of the supposed PBS special is screened as part of the scenery. Avalon is also referenced in the 1994 film, The St√∂ned Age, in which he makes an ending scene cameo appearance. His song \\"Venus\\" additionally appeared in season 4 of the TV series Dexter in which John Lithgow's character, Arthur Mitchell, plays it to remember his deceased sister. Also, \\"Venus\\" is sampled in Nick Bertke's, single, \\"J'Adore Juin\\", a mashup of sounds from the movie The Apartment. \\"Venus\\" also appeared in the 2016 film 10 Cloverfield Lane starring John Goodman. Avalon is also mentioned in The Vaccines' song \\"Teenage Icon\\". == Discography == == Acting roles == * Jamboree (1957) ‚Äì Himself * Guns of the Timberland (1960) ‚Äì Bert Harvey * Alakazam the Great (1960) ‚Äì Alakazam (English version, singing voice) * The Alamo (1960) ‚Äì Smitty * Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961) ‚Äì Lt (j.g.)

It originally appeared anonymously as a monthly serial in Cornhill Magazine, where it gained a wide readership. The novel is the first to be set in Thomas Hardy's Wessex in rural southwest England. It deals in themes of love, honour and betrayal, against a backdrop of the seemingly idyllic, but often harsh, realities of a farming community in Victorian England. It describes the life and relationships of Bathsheba Everdene with her lonely neighbour William Boldwood, the faithful shepherd Gabriel Oak, and the thriftless soldier Sergeant Troy. On publication, critical notices were plentiful and mostly positive. Hardy revised the text extensively for the 1895 edition and made further changes for the 1901 edition. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 48 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\\"BBC ‚Äì The Big Read\\". BBC. April 2003, Retrieved 31 October 2012 In 2007, the book finished 10th on the Guardian's list of greatest love stories of all time. The novel has been dramatised several times, notably in the Oscar-nominated 1967 film directed by John Schlesinger. ==Synopsis== ===Meeting, parting and reuniting=== Gabriel Oak is a young shepherd. With the savings of a frugal life, and a loan, he has leased and stocked a farm. He falls in love with a newcomer eight years his junior, Bathsheba Everdene, a proud beauty who arrives to live with her aunt. Over time, Bathsheba and Gabriel grow to like each other well enough, and Bathsheba even saves his life once. However, when he makes her an unadorned offer of marriage, she refuses; she values her independence too much and him too little. After a few days, she moves to Weatherbury, a village some miles off. When next they meet, their circumstances have changed drastically. An inexperienced new sheepdog drives Gabriel's flock over a cliff, ruining him. After selling off everything of value, he manages to settle all his debts but emerges penniless. He seeks employment at a hiring fair in the town of Casterbridge. When he finds none, he heads to another such fair in Shottsford, a town about ten miles from Weatherbury. On the way, he happens upon a dangerous fire on a farm and leads the bystanders in putting it out. When the veiled owner comes to thank him, he asks if she needs a shepherd. She uncovers her face and reveals herself to be none other than Bathsheba. She has recently inherited her uncle's estate and is now wealthy. Though somewhat uncomfortable, she employs him. ===Bathsheba's valentine to Boldwood=== Meanwhile, Bathsheba gains a new admirer. William Boldwood is a prosperous farmer of about 40, whose ardour Bathsheba unwittingly awakens when she playfully sends him a valentine sealed with red wax on which she has embossed the words \\"Marry me\\". Boldwood, not realising the valentine was a jest, becomes obsessed with her and soon proposes marriage. Although she does not love him, she toys with the idea of accepting his offer; he is the most eligible bachelor in the district. However, she avoids giving him a definite answer. When Gabriel rebukes her for her thoughtlessness regarding Boldwood, she dismisses him. When Bathsheba's sheep begin dying from bloat, she discovers to her chagrin that Gabriel is the only man who knows how to cure them. Her pride delays the inevitable, but finally she is forced to beg him for help. Afterward, she offers him back his job, and their friendship is restored. ===Sergeant Troy=== \\"She took up her position as directed.\\" Troy courts Bathsheba; Cornhill illustration by Helen Paterson Allingham At this point, the dashing Sergeant Francis \\"Frank\\" Troy returns to his native Weatherbury and by chance encounters Bathsheba one night. Her initial dislike turns to infatuation after he excites her with a private display of swordsmanship. Gabriel observes Bathsheba's interest in the young soldier and tries to discourage it, telling her she would be better off marrying Boldwood. Boldwood becomes aggressive towards Troy, and Bathsheba goes to Bath to prevent Troy returning to Weatherbury, as she fears what might happen if Troy encountered Boldwood. On their return, Boldwood offers his rival a large bribe to give up Bathsheba. Troy pretends to consider the offer, then scornfully announces they are already married. Boldwood withdraws, humiliated, and vows revenge. Bathsheba soon discovers that her new husband is an improvident gambler with little interest in farming. Worse, she begins to suspect he does not love her. In fact, Troy's heart belongs to her former servant, Fanny Robin. Before meeting Bathsheba, Troy had promised to marry Fanny; on the wedding day, however, the luckless girl went to the wrong church. She explained her mistake, but Troy, humiliated at being left at the altar, angrily called off the wedding. When they parted, unbeknownst to Troy, Fanny was pregnant with his child. ===Fanny Robin=== Fanny Robin on her way to the Casterbridge workhouse. Cornhill illustration by Helen Paterson Allingham Some months later, Troy and Bathsheba encounter Fanny on the road, destitute, as she painfully makes her way toward the Casterbridge workhouse. Troy sends his wife onward, then gives Fanny all the money in his pocket, telling her he will give her more in a few days. Fanny uses up the last of her strength to reach her destination. A few hours later, she dies in childbirth, along with the baby. Mother and child are then placed in a coffin and sent home to Weatherbury for interment. Gabriel, who knows of Troy's relationship with Fanny, tries to conceal the child's existence ‚Äì but Bathsheba agrees that the coffin can be left in her house overnight, from her sense of duty towards a former servant. Her servant and confidante, Liddy, repeats the rumour that Fanny had a child; when all the servants are in bed, Bathsheba unscrews the lid and sees the two bodies inside. Troy then comes home from Casterbridge, where he had gone to keep his appointment with Fanny. Seeing the reason for her failure to meet him, he gently kisses the corpse and tells the anguished Bathsheba, \\"This woman is more to me, dead as she is, than ever you were, or are, or can be\\". The next day he spends all his money on a marble tombstone with the inscription: \\"Erected by Francis Troy in beloved memory of Fanny Robin ...\\" Then, loathing himself and unable to bear Bathsheba's company, he leaves. After a long walk, he bathes in the sea, leaving his clothes on the beach. A strong current carries him away, but he is rescued by a rowing boat. He does not return home, however. ===Troy returns=== A year later, with Troy presumed drowned, Boldwood renews his suit. Burdened with guilt over the pain she has caused him, Bathsheba reluctantly consents to marry him in six years, long enough to have Troy declared dead. Troy tires of his hand-to-mouth existence as a travelling actor and considers reclaiming his position and wife. He returns to Weatherbury on Christmas Eve and goes to Boldwood's house, where a party is under way. He orders Bathsheba to come with him; when she shrinks back in shock and dismay, he seizes her arm, and she screams. At this, Boldwood shoots Troy dead and tries unsuccessfully to turn the double- barrelled gun on himself. Although Boldwood is convicted of murder and sentenced to be hanged, his friends petition the Home Secretary for mercy, claiming insanity. This is granted, and Boldwood's sentence is commuted to \\"confinement during Her Majesty's pleasure\\". Bathsheba buries her husband in the same grave as Fanny Robin and their child. ===Gabriel triumphant=== Throughout her tribulations, Bathsheba comes to rely increasingly on her oldest and, as she admits to herself, only real friend, Gabriel. When he gives notice that he is leaving her employ, she realises how important he has become to her well-being. That night, she goes alone to visit him in his cottage, to find out why he is deserting her. Pressed, he reluctantly reveals that it is because people have been gossiping that he wants to marry her. She exclaims that it is \\"... too absurd ‚Äì too soon ‚Äì to think of, by far!\\" He bitterly agrees that it is absurd, but when she corrects him, saying that it is only \\"too soon\\", he is emboldened to ask once again for her hand in marriage. She accepts, and the two are quietly married. ==Title== Hardy took the title from Thomas Gray's poem \\"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\\" (1751): \\"Madding\\" here means \\"frenzied\\"., or, actually, \\"maddening\\". Lucasta Miller points out that the title is an ironic literary joke, as Gray is idealising noiseless and sequestered calm, whereas Hardy \\"disrupts the idyll, and not just by introducing the sound and fury of an extreme plot ... he is out to subvert his readers' complacency\\". ==Hardy's Wessex== Weatherbury Church (Puddletown) Thomas Hardy's Wessex was first mentioned in Far from the Madding Crowd; describing the \\"partly real, partly dream-country\\" that unifies his novels of southwest England. Far from the Madding Crowd offers in ample measure the details of English rural life that Hardy so relished. He found the word in the pages of early English history as a designation for an extinct, pre-Norman conquest kingdom, the Wessex from which Alfred the Great established England.Hardy, Thomas. Far From the Madding Crowd: Preface, 1895‚Äì1902. In the first edition, the word \\"Wessex\\" is used only once, in chapter 50; Hardy extended the reference for the 1895 edition.Oxford Reader's Companion to Hardy, ibid., p. 131. Hardy himself wrote: ‚ÄúI am reminded that it was in the chapters of Far from the Madding Crowd‚Ä¶ that I first ventured to adopt the word ‚ÄòWessex‚Äô from the pages of early English history‚Ä¶ ‚Äì a modern Wessex of railways, the penny post, mowing and reaping machines, union workhouses, lucifer matches, labourers who could read and write, and National school children.‚Äù Puddletown's parish church has significant architectural interest, particularly its furnishings and monuments. It has a 12th-century font and well-preserved woodwork, including 17th-century box pews. Hardy took an interest in the church, and the village provided the inspiration for the fictional settlement of WeatherburyAnonymous. Far from the Madding Crowd (caption to frontispiece). New York and London: Harper and Brothers Publications, 1912. In The Mayor of Casterbridge, Hardy briefly mentions two characters from Far from the Madding Crowd ‚Äì Farmer Everdene and Farmer Boldwood, both in happier days. ==Adaptations== ===Novels=== The novel was retold by author F.J. Campbell in The Islanders, set in a 1980s/90s boarding school in the UK countryside (published January 2019).https://www.fjcampbell.net/the-islanders ===Radio=== The novel was adapted by Graham White in 2012 into a three-part series on BBC Radio 4's Classic Serial. The production was directed by Jessica Dromgoole and featured Alex Tregear as Bathsheba, Shaun Dooley as Gabriel, Toby Jones as Boldwood and Patrick Kennedy as Troy. ===Comics=== The novel was adapted by Posy Simmonds into Tamara Drewe, weekly comic strip that ran from September 2005 to October 2006 in The Guardians Review section. The strip, a modern reworking of the novel, was itself adapted into a film, Tamara Drewe (2010), directed by Stephen Frears. ===Film=== *Far from the Madding Crowd (1915) directed by Laurence Trimble, starring Florence Turner and Henry Edwards. *Far from the Madding Crowd (1967) directed by John Schlesinger, starring Julie Christie as Bathsheba Everdene, Terence Stamp as Sergeant Troy, Peter Finch as Mr Boldwood, and Alan Bates as Farmer Oak. *Far from the Madding Crowd (1998) directed by Nicholas Renton, starring Paloma Baeza, Nathaniel Parker, Jonathan Firth and Nigel Terry. *Far from the Madding Crowd (2015) directed by Thomas Vinterberg, screenplay by David Nicholls, with Carey Mulligan as Bathsheba Everdene, Matthias Schoenaerts as Farmer Oak, Michael Sheen as Mr Boldwood, Tom Sturridge as Sergeant Troy and Juno Temple as Fanny Robin. ===Stage productions=== Dance * Far from the Madding Crowd (1996) is a ballet by David Bintley for the Birmingham Royal Ballet. Musical *Far from the Madding Crowd (2000), a musical with music by Gary Schocker, based on the novel. Opera *Far from the Madding Crowd (2006) is an opera by Andrew Downes. Plays * In 1879, Hardy adapted the novel under the title ‚ÄúThe Mistress of the Farm: A Pastoral Drama‚Äù. When J. Comyns Carr suggested something similar, Hardy gave him his version, which he said Carr ‚Äúmodified‚Ä¶ in places, to suit modern carpentry &c;‚Äù. Hardy‚Äôs experience of adapting a novel for the theatre was soured by controversy ‚Äì the managers of the St James‚Äôs Theatre, London, John Hare and William Hunter Kendal, on reading the Comyns Carr/Hardy adaptation, first accepted it and then rejected it; instead staging Arthur Wing Pinero‚Äôs play The Squire, which appeared to be heavily plagiarised from the earlier script. This enraged Comyns Carr and, to a lesser extent, Hardy. Prompted by Comyns Carr, Hardy wrote indignant letters to The Times and the Daily News. The reviews for Comyns Carr/Hardy‚Äôs version, staged in 1882 and starring Marion Terry, were mixed, one critic calling their adaptation ‚Äúa miniature melodrama‚Ä¶ well placed in the provinces‚Äù, while praising The Squire‚Äôs appeal to ‚Äúspectators of somewhat refined taste‚Äù. Inspired by the performances across the Pond, a further, clumsy cut-and-paste version of the novel was performed in America shortly afterwards, at the Union Square Theatre, New York in April 1882. The play was panned: according to the theatre reviewer for the American journal Spirit of the Times, it was unfair ‚Äúto Thomas Hardy, to the public, and to Miss Morris, although she got even by spoiling the play after Mr Cazauran had spoiled the novel‚Äù. This experience made Hardy wary of theatrical adaptations and the potential risk to his reputation both from authorised adaptations and from unauthorised ones. * In 1909, Harold Evans adapted the novel, with Hardy‚Äôs input, for The Hardy Players, Hardy‚Äôs own amateur theatrical society, formed in 1908 to perform a production of The Trumpet-Major. As Harold Evans‚Äô daughter Evelyn wrote: ‚ÄúThis pastoral romance presented more difficult problems of staging; sheep had to be sheared on stage in the great barn; the big shearing supper was essential; Boldwood‚Äôs Christmas party had to be staged, too, with its tragic climax, the shooting of Troy by the half-crazed Boldwood. Mr T. H. Tilley, a builder by trade, and a most gifted comedian, conquered all these staging difficulties. He constructed a model theatre (now in the possession of Mr Edward Grassby) with designs for each set, so that the Weatherbury (Puddletown) landscape could be faithfully portrayed. A painting of Waterston House formed one backcloth; meadows, fir plantations, house interiors, the others. Mr Tilley‚Äôs rich humour in the part of Joseph Poorgrass delighted Hardy and the audience. My father often chuckled over how Joseph, in his cups, declared, ‚ÄòI feel too good for England. I ought to have lived in Genesis by right.‚Äô‚Äù In the 1909 production, one important scene had to be omitted. Much to Hardy‚Äôs regret, the opening of Fanny Robin‚Äôs coffin by Bathsheba and her reaction to it could not be staged. At that time, having a coffin on the stage was seen as too shocking. ‚ÄúYears later,‚Äù wrote Evelyn Evans, ‚Äúwhen Hardy attended a performance of Synge‚Äôs Riders to the Sea by the Arts League of Service, and watched drowned bodies carried on to the stage, he remarked wryly that his one coffin containing Fanny Robin and her child could hardly have shocked the same audience.‚Äù There was also some unexpected comedy gold in the 1909 production. Evelyn Evans describes it thus: ‚ÄúTo make this pastoral play true to life, my father engaged a professional sheep-shearer to shear sheep on stage during the important shearing scene. Everything was to be done as Hardy described it: ‚ÄòThe lopping off the tresses about the ewe‚Äôs head, opening up the neck and collar, the running of the shears line after line round her dewlap, thence about her flank and back, and finishing over her tail ‚Äì the clean, sleek creature arising from its fleece: startled and shy at the loss of its garment, which lay on the floor in one soft cloud.‚Äô The shearer, complaining of thirst, was given unlimited free beer at his task, with the result that above the actors‚Äô voices could be heard a maudlin song, as the shearer sang to the sheep he was fondly kissing and clipping with expertise, becoming, unfortunately, drunker and drunker to father‚Äôs great consternation.‚ÄùEvans, Evelyn L; My Father Produced Hardy's Plays. 1964 VG *In autumn 2008, English Touring Theatre (ETT) toured Britain with a new stage adaptation of Far from the Madding Crowd directed by Kate Saxon *In March 2013 Myriad Theatre & Film toured southeast England with their original stage adaptation of Far from the Madding Crowd for five actors. The show also incorporated some of Hardy's poetry. *In 2019, the New Hardy Players (re-formed at the request of Norrie Woodhall in 2005) performed a new adaptation of the novel. ===Other=== * In October 2016, the first episode of a web series transmedia modernisation of the novel, Away from It All, was released. Based around the antics and video blogs of a group of twenty-somethings working at a village pub, the series was created by Hazel Jeffs. ==References in popular culture== ===Anime=== *Episode 20 of the anime Kill la Kill, is titled \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\". ===Music=== * British musician Nick Bracegirdle, better known as Chicane, released Far from the Maddening Crowds, a studio album, in 1997. *In 2000, the New York rock band Nine Days titled their debut The Madding Crowd to express their allegiance to modernity in opposition to Hardy. *The Danish metal band Wuthering Heights released a studio album, Far From the Madding Crowd in 2004. * Nanci Griffith included the lyric \\"You're a Saturday night, Far from the madding crowd\\" in the song On Grafton Street on her 1994 release Flyer. ===Literature=== * The city of Far Madding in Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series of fantasy novels is named after Hardy's book. ==References== ==External links== * *Helen Paterson Allingham's illustrations for the serial edition, with extensive commentary, from Victorian Web. *Far From the Madding Crowd Map *Far from the Madding Crowd on The Literature Network Category:1874 British novels Category:Novels by Thomas Hardy Category:Works originally published in The Cornhill Magazine Category:Works published anonymously Category:British novels adapted into films Category:English novels Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:Victorian novels Category:Novels set in Dorset Category:British novels adapted into plays Category:Novels adapted into television shows Category:Novels adapted into operas Category:Novels adapted into radio programs ","title":"Far from the Madding Crowd"},{"id":"305515","text":"Benton County is the name of nine counties in the United States: * Benton County, Arkansas * Benton County, Indiana * Benton County, Iowa * Benton County, Minnesota * Benton County, Mississippi * Benton County, Missouri * Benton County, Oregon * Benton County, Tennessee * Benton County, Washington * Calhoun County, Alabama was established as Benton County in 1832, and renamed in 1858. * Hernando County, Florida was named Benton County from 1844 through 1850.

Although the original group only released one official studio album, their singles and various other tracks have been packaged into numerous collections, and they remain one of the more well-known bands of the early Batcave scene and have reformed for new albums and touring at various times since the early 1990s. ==History== The original lineup was Andi Sex Gang (vocals, guitar), Dave Roberts (bass), Terry McLeay (guitar) and Rob Stroud (drums).Strong, Martin C. (2003) \\"Sex Gang Children\\", in The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, They were a dramatic band, relying on heavy bass, tribal drumming, sudden mood shifts, dramatic vocals and a cabaret sound (influencing the rise of the later dark cabaret scene). The band's first release was a cassette-only live album, Naked, in 1982. The Beasts EP, their first vinyl release, followed the same year after they signed to the Illuminated label. The band's only studio album from their original period together, Song and Legend, was released in 1983, reaching the top of the UK Indie Chart and spawning the single \\"Sebastiane\\". Stroud departed to form Aemoti Crii, to be replaced by former Theatre of Hate drummer Nigel Preston, who played on the band's next single, \\"Mauritia Mayer\\", before himself being replaced by former Death Cult drummer Ray Mondo. Roberts left in late 1983 to form Carcrash International, and the line-up settled to Andi, McLeay, Cam Campbell (bass) and Kevin Matthews (drums), a change forced by Ray Mondo's deportation to his native Sierra Leone. Following McLeay's departure in 1984, the band was renamed Andi Sex Gang & the Quick Gas Gang for the 1985 Blind! album and tour (McLeay did not leave until after that album's recording, however; guitarist Lester Jones from Crisis performed the live shows). The band split afterwards. Renewed interest in the band in the United States led to a reformation in 1991, including Roberts, and a new album, Medea, in 1993. As a solo artist, Andi went on to make a number of well- received albums for various labels. ==Name== Sex Gang Children were originally called The Panic Buttons. The name \\"Sex Gang Children\\" was taken by Malcolm McLaren from a William Burroughs novel as a possible name for the band that became Bow Wow Wow (and is referenced in their song \\"Mile High Club\\") and was one of the names that Boy George went through before choosing \\"Culture Club\\".Bright, Spencer (1995) Take It Like A Man: The Autobiography of Boy George with Spencer Bright, PAN, p. 182, SGC vocalist Andi tried to persuade George to use the name, but when Culture Club drummer Jon Moss passed on the idea, Andi decided that the name should not go to waste. == Discography == Chart placings shown are from the UK Indie Chart.Lazell, Barry (1997) Indie Hits 1980-1989, Cherry Red Books, ===Studio albums=== *Song and Legend (1983, Illuminated Records) No. 1 *Blind (1992 reissue, Cleopatra Records) *Medea (1993, Cleopatra Records) *The Wrath of God (2000, Dressed to Kill) *Bastard Art (2002, Burning Airlines) * Viva Vigilante!

It is the headquarters of the superhero Batman, whose secret identity is Bruce Wayne, consisting of caves beneath his personal residence, Wayne Manor. ==Publication history== Originally, there was only a secret tunnel that ran underground between Wayne Manor and a dusty old barn where the Batmobile was kept. Later, in Batman #12 (August‚ÄìSeptember 1942), Bill Finger mentioned \\"secret underground hangars\\". In 1943, the writers of the first Batman movie serial, titled Batman, gave Batman a complete underground crime lab and introduced it in the second chapter entitled \\"The Bat's Cave\\". The entrance was via a secret passage through a grandfather clock and included bats flying around. Bob Kane, who was on the movie set, mentioned this to Bill Finger who was going to be the initial scripter on the Batman daily newspaper strip. Finger included with his script a clipping from Popular Mechanics that featured a detailed cross section of underground hangars. Kane used this clipping as a guide, adding a study, crime lab, workshop, hangar and garage. This illustration appeared in the Batman \\"dailies\\" on October 29, 1943 in a strip entitled \\"The Bat Cave!\\" In this early version the cave itself was described as Batman's underground study and, like the other rooms, was just a small alcove with a desk and filing cabinets. Like in the movie serial, the Batman's symbol was carved into the rock behind the desk and had a candle in the middle of it. The entrance was via a bookcase which led to a secret elevator. The Batcave made its comic book debut in Detective Comics #83 in January 1944.Batman: The Dailies 1943‚Äì1944 by Bob Kane, Kitchen Sink Press, 1990. Over the decades, the cave has expanded along with its owner's popularity to include a vast trophy room, supercomputer, and forensics lab. There has been little consistency as to the floor plan of the Batcave or its contents. The design has varied from artist to artist and it is not unusual for the same artist to draw the cave layout differently in various issues. ==Fictional history== The Batcave in Justice #5 (June 2006). Art by Alex Ross. The cave was discovered and used long before by Bruce Wayne's ancestors as a storehouse as well as a means of transporting escaped slaves during the Civil War era. The 18th century frontier hero Tomahawk once discovered a gargantuan bat (owned by Morgaine le Fey of Arthurian legend) inside what can be assumed would become the Batcave. Wayne himself rediscovered the caves as a boy when he fell through a dilapidated well on his estate, but he did not consider the cave as a potential base of operations until he rediscovered it yet again when he returned to Gotham to become Batman. In addition to a base, the Batcave serves as a place of privacy and tranquility, much like Superman's Fortress of Solitude. In earlier versions of the story, Bruce Wayne discovered the cave as an adult. In \\"The Origin of the Batcave\\" in Detective Comics #205 (March 1954), Batman tells Robin he had no idea the cave existed when he purchased the house they live in. He discovered the cave by accident when testing the floor of an old barn on the rear of the property, and the floor gave way. This story also established that a frontiersman named Jeremy Coe used the cave as a headquarters 300 years earlier. Bruce Wayne discovering the cave as an adult remained the case at least through Who's Who #2 in 1985. Upon his initial foray into crime-fighting, Wayne used the caves as a sanctum and to store his then-minimal equipment. As time went on, Wayne found the place ideal to create a stronghold for his war against crime, and has incorporated a plethora of equipment as well as expanding the cave for specific uses. ===Access=== Bruce Wayne accesses the Batcave through a clock. Art by David Finch. The cave is accessible in several ways. It can be reached through a secret door in Wayne Manor itself, which is almost always depicted as in the main study, often behind a grandfather clock which unlocks the secret door when the hands are set to the time that Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered, 10:48 pm.Batman vol. 3, #69 (March 2019) In the 1960s Batman TV show, the cave entrance is behind a bookcase which was opened when Bruce Wayne activated a control switch hidden in a bust of William Shakespeare; when the secret switch is turned, the bookcase slides to one side, revealing the \\"Bat-Poles\\", which allow Bruce Wayne and his ward Dick Grayson to change into their Batman and Robin costumes en route as they slide down to the cave. An entrance under Bruce Wayne's chair in his office in Wayne Enterprises, as shown in Batman Forever, connects to a miles-long tunnel which Bruce travels through in a high-speed personal transportation capsule. In Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises, the cave is accessible through a secret door disguised as part of a large display case and is unlocked by pressing a sequence of keys on the nearby grand piano. Another secret entrance, covered by a waterfall, pond, hologram, or a camouflaged door, allows access to a service road for the Batmobile. Another alternate entrance is the dry well where Bruce originally discovered the Batcave, highlighted especially during the Knightfall comic book storyline. At one point, Tim Drake and Dick Grayson use the dry well to get into the cave, which they had been locked out of by Jean Paul Valley during his time as Batman, and Bruce Wayne used it to infiltrate the cave and confront the insane Valley in the final battle between the two men for the title of the Batman. Lured into the narrow tunnel, Valley was forced to remove the massive Bat- armor he had developed, thus allowing Wayne to force Valley to remit his claim to the title. The location of the cave is known not only to Batman, but to several of his allies. In addition to the so-called \\"Batman Family\\", members of the Justice League and the original Outsiders are aware of the cave's location. Essentially, anyone who is aware of Batman's secret identity also knows the location of the Batcave, much like how people who have knowledge of Robin's identity have knowledge of Batman's; these, unfortunately, include such villains as Ra's al Ghul, who makes occasional visits to the Batcave to confront his long-time nemesis, and David Cain, who infiltrated the cave during the Bruce Wayne: Fugitive comic book storyline when he framed Bruce Wayne for murder. During Batman: Dark Victory, Two-Face, the Joker, Mr Freeze and Poison Ivy discovered the Batcave while fleeing through the sewers to escape the attacks of the surviving mobsters, but they had lost their way and were never able to find the cave again after being defeated by Batman and Dick Grayson (In his \\"official\\" debut as Robin), Batman reflecting that he would seal that entrance to prevent such a thing happening again. When the powerful Bedlam took over the world and transferred all adults to a duplicate Earth, Robin attempted to assess the situation from the Batcave with Superboy and Impulse, but it would appear that he avoided revealing the cave's exact location to them, suggesting that he accessed it via an external passage or a teleporter. Although Wayne Manor was repossessed and converted into the new Arkham Asylum following the events of Batman Eternal, Batman maintains the original cave after sealing off the entrance to Wayne Manor, musing that it is a good opportunity to keep his foes contained. After the manor was gifted back to Bruce by Geri Powers. Alfred kept the location of the Batcave a secret from Bruce who had lost his memory of being Batman in his last battle with The Joker. While the manor was being renovated and all the Arkham inmates were removed Bruce and Alfred until then remained in a Brownstone in Gotham itself. Even after Bruce loses all memory of his life as Batman, the cave was still used by other members of the Bat-Family; Alfred took the de-powered Clark Kent to the cave to explain what had happened to Bruce, and Dick Grayson and the various Robins used it as a base of operations while opposing the schemes of the ruthless \\"Mother\\" in Batman and Robin Eternal. When new villain Mr Bloom launches a massive attack on Gotham, Alfred is forced to allow Bruce into the Batcave to access an apparently-disregarded program designed to upload Bruce's memories to a series of Batman clones to maintain his legacy, Bruce overcoming the original project's limitation of being unable to upload the memories to a fresh body by having Alfred take him to the point of brain death and then download the data onto his blank brain. ===Design=== The Batcave serves as Batman's secret headquarters and command center, where he monitors all crisis points in Gotham City, as well as the rest of the world. The cave's centerpiece is a supercomputer whose specs are on par with any of those used by leading national security agencies; it permits global surveillance and also connects to a massive information network as well as storing vast amounts of information, both on Batman's foes and his allies. A series of satellite link- ups allows easy access to Batman's information network anywhere around the globe. The systems are protected against unauthorized access, and any attempt to breach their security immediately sends an alert to Batman or Oracle. Despite the power of Batman's computers, the Justice League Watchtower is known to have more powerful computers (composed of Kryptonian, Thanagarian and Martian technology), and Batman does occasionally use them if he feels his computers are not up to the task; on occasion he also consults Oracle for assistance. The partially destroyed Batcave. Cover to Batman: Shadow of the Bat #79 (1998). Art by Glen Orbik. Additionally, the cave features state-of- the-art facilities such as a crime lab, various specialized laboratories, mechanized workshops, personal gymnasium, parking, docking and hangar space (as appropriate) for his vehicles as well as separate exits for each type, memorabilia of past campaigns, a vast library, a large bat colony, and a Justice League teleporter. It also has medical facilities as well as various areas used in training exercises for Batman and his allies. The cave houses Batman's vast array of specialized vehicles, foremost being the Batmobile in all its incarnations (mostly for nostalgia, but also for contingencies, as all are serviceable and in excellent working condition). Other vehicles within the complex include various motorcycles, air- and watercraft such as The Bat-Wing, a single-occupant supersonic jet, and the Subway Rocket (which debuted in Detective Comics #667). The cave is sometimes depicted as being powered by a nuclear reactor, but most often by a hydroelectric generator made possible by an underground river. During the Cataclysm storyline, the cave was seriously damaged in an earthquake- Bruce Wayne naturally unable to fortify Wayne Manor against such an event despite his precautions with the rest of his property to preserve Batman's secrets- with the Bat-family relocating most of the trophies and equipment in the cave to offsite storage to conceal Batman's identity. During the later reconstruction, the new Wayne Manor incorporates additional safeguards against future quakes and even a potential nuclear catastrophe, outfitting the cave as a virtual bomb shelter or an enhanced panic room. The city's earthquake redesigned the caverns of the Batcave, with eight new levels now making up Batman's secret refuge of high-tech laboratory, library, training areas, storage areas, and vehicle accesses. It also includes an \\"island\\" computer platform (built on the spot where the Batmobiles' hydraulic turntable once was) with seven linked Cray T932 mainframes and a state-of-the- art hologram projector. There's also a selection of retractable glass maps within the computer platform. Kevlar shieldings are prepared to protect the cave's computer systems from seismic activity. With the cave's various facilities spread amid limestone stalactites and stalagmites, Batman built retractable multi-walkway bridges, stairs, elevators, and poles to access its facilities. There is a containment vault solely for Lex Luthor's Kryptonite ring.Action Comics #654 (June 1990) However, it was later revealed that Batman built another containment facility within the cave for a collection of variety of forms of Kryptonite.Superman/Batman 44 to #49 What is allegedly the world's last Lazarus Pit was constructed inside the cave, although this has been contradicted by events in the pages of Batgirl and the Black Adam miniseries. ===Security measures=== The Batcave is rigged with the most sophisticated security system in the world in order to prevent all measure of infiltration. The security measures include motion sensors, silent alarms, steel and lead mechanical doors which could lock a person in or out, and a security mode which is specifically designed to stop if not eliminate all Justice League members in the event that any of them go rogue. After Bruce Wayne's 'death' during the Final Crisis, Two-Face managed to infiltrate the cave with the aid of a psychic analyzing a batarang to 'sense' where it was forged and then hiring Warp to teleport him into it, something that Two-Face had never been able to do before as Batman used various spells and equipment to shield the cave which his allies either never knew about or had discontinued as they no longer used the cave themselves following Bruce's death. Despite Two-Face successfully breaking into the cave, Dick Grayson, acting as the new Batman, is able to convince Dent that he is the same man and has just adopted new methods, preserving Batman's secrets as Dent is rendered unconscious before he can find the location of the cave.Batman (vol. 1) #691 ===Memorabilia=== The Batcave in Forever Evil #4 (Feb. 2014). The animatronic Tyrannosaurus Rex, giant Lincoln penny, and oversized Joker playing card are seen on the right. Art by David Finch. The cave stores unique memorabilia items collected from the various cases Batman has worked on over the years. Originally, these were stored in a room designed just for them; it was explained that Batman and Robin took one memento from each case. Later, the trophies were shown to be in the large main area of the cave, residing among the rest of the Batcave's furnishings. The most regularly featured trophies are a full-size animatronic Tyrannosaurus Rex, a giant replica of a Lincoln penny, and an oversized Joker playing card. The T. Rex comes from an adventure on \\"Dinosaur Island\\" (Batman #35, 1946); the penny was originally a trophy from Batman's encounter with a penny-obsessed villain named the Penny Plunderer (World's Finest Comics #30, 1947), but was later retconned into being from an encounter with Two-Face. Other \\"keepsakes\\" in the cave come from \\"The Thousand and One Trophies of Batman!\\" (Detective Comics #158, 1950). These three stories were reprinted in Batman #256. Modern retellings of the items' origins can be found in Batman Chronicles stories in issue #8 (\\"Secrets of the Batcave: Dinosaur Island\\") and issue #19 (\\"The Penny Plunderers\\"). A story in Batman #81 featured Two-Face tying Batman and Robin to a giant replica of his silver dollar coin. This story was the basis for an episode of Batman: The Animated Series wherein Batman gains the giant coin from that encounter; this has caused widespread confusion as to the actual origin of the coin trophy. Other pieces often shown in the Batcave are Two-Face's original coin, Deathstroke's sword (the owner of which Batman has fought at least twice), the shroud of the vampiric Monk, and oversized ten-pins. There is also a glass case display of Jason Todd's Robin costume as a memorial to him, with the epitaph \\"A Good Soldier\\", which remains even after Todd's resurrection. Barbara Gordon's Batgirl costume also remains on display. In the Dark Horse two-part crossover, Grendel/Batman II, the skull of Hunter Rose is also put on display in the memorabilia room. After the Flashpoint comic book storyline, a letter written by a Thomas Wayne from an alternate timeline addressed to Bruce Wayne has lain in a display case, as a reminder of Thomas Wayne's love for his son and encouraging him to move on from his tragic past.Justice League (vol. 2) #9 (May 2012) However, this letter was destroyed by the reborn Eobard Thawne as a way to hurt Bruce for Thomas's attempt to kill him before Flashpoint ended. ===\\"Batcave\\" safehouses=== The \\"bat bunker\\" in Batman and Robin #1 (August 2009). Art by Frank Quitely. The Outsiders were, for a time, based out of a Batcave in Los Angeles. When Jean Paul Valley takeover the role of Batman, Tim Drake establishes his own safe house using an abandoned barn nearby Wayne Manor and his own house. After Bane's attack during the Knightfall story arc, Bruce Wayne swore that he'd never be caught unprepared to defend Gotham City ever again. When Dick Grayson assumed the Batman role during the Prodigal storyline, Bruce established satellite Batcaves (most of which were not caves in the literal sense that the original one was) throughout the city on areas either owned by him, his company, or unknown or abandoned by the city, in the event that he needed a place to hide and/or resupply, which were pivotal during the No Man's Land storyline. One such Batcave was given to Batgirl, below a house owned by Bruce Wayne himself, during a point where her identity was compromised after she saved a man from rogue government agents, meaning that she could not walk around without a mask. *Bat Bunker: Under the Wayne Foundation building, there is a secret bunker. As of Batman #687, Dick Grayson has taken to using this as his \\"Batcave\\", stating that he wishes to embody the role of Batman in a way that is specific to him as well as getting closer to the action in the city. The bunker is as well-equipped as the original Batcave, including the Subway Rocket vehicle (which is Grayson's favorite means of transport during the Prodigal storyline) stationed beneath the bunker despite of him using a flying Batmobile. The other satellite Batcaves introduced during No Man's Land were: Four Satellite Batcaves used during No Man's Land. Clockwise from top left: Central Batcave (Robinson Park Reservoir), Batcave South (A boiler room beneath Paris Island), Northwest Batcave (a subbasement of Arkham Asylum), and Batcave East (Wayne Enterprises- owned oil refinery). Art by Stan Boch. *Batcave Central: Located fifty feet below the bottom of Robinson Park Reservoir, it is accessible through a secret entrance at the foot of one of the Twelve Caesars statues at the north of the park. This safehouse was put out of commission by Poison Ivy, her \\"Feraks\\", and Clayface.Batman: No Man's Land Secret Files #1 *Batcave South: A boiler room of a derelict shipping yard on the docks across from Paris Island. This safehouse is accessible through a number of false manholes planted throughout Old Gotham streets. *Batcave South-Central: Located in the Old Gotham prototype subway station, a four-block stretch of track sealed in 1896 and forgotten. *Batcave Northwest: This safehouse is located in the subbasement of Arkham Asylum. Batman secretly stocked it with emergency rations, all-terrain vehicles, and battery-powered communication equipment. *Batcave East: An abandoned oil refinery owned by Wayne Enterprises. It fell out of use during a gasoline crisis when the company moved all of its holdings offshore decades ago. *Batcave Submarine: Introduced in 2002's Fugitive story arc, this time in the form of an abandoned submarine docked on the city's harbors, which Batman used as a full-time residence when he chose to abandon his life as Bruce Wayne when framed for the murder of Vesper Fairchild. ===Alternative versions of the Batcave=== In Batman & Dracula: Red Rain, Batman destroys the Batcave in order to eliminate Dracula's followers; having lured them into the cave after a prolonged pursuit through the sewers, he sets off explosive charges to destroy the Batcave's walls at the moment the sun rises, destroying the vampires trapped within it, before setting off additional charges to collapse Wayne Manor in order to preserve his secrets. The first sequel, Bloodstorm, shows that a cellar beneath a brownstone owned by Alfred Pennyworth serves as a lair/laboratory for Batman after he has become a vampire himself, the Dark Knight 'sleeping' there in his coffin during the day. Although Wayne Manor collapses into the remains of the cave, part of the tunnel system is still intact, with Batman establishing his lair there in the story's second sequel, Crimson Mist, after he surrenders to his new vampire instincts. Despite the collapse of the manor, the cave interior appears mostly intact, with the giant penny, the T-Rex and the Batmobile shown to be undamaged, although there is also a deep chasm within walking distance of the areas where Batman kept the aforementioned items when he was human. At the story's conclusion, Commissioner Gordon sets off explosive charges to destroy the cave's roof, letting the sun into the cave once again in order to destroy the monster that Batman has become once and for all. In Batman: Brotherhood of the Bat, some years after Bruce Wayne's death and humanity's decimation by a virus unleashed by Ra's al Ghul, Ra's takes control of the Batcave and uses some of Bruce's sketches of possible costumes to create an army of Bat-men based on Bruce's rejected costume designs. Eventually, this 'Brotherhood' is infiltrated by Tallant, the son of Bruce Wayne and Talia al Ghul, who is able to destroy the Brotherhood from within using his father's own costume, culminating in him defeating his grandfather in a duel in the cave. In the alternate reality of Flashpoint, the Batcave- here used by Thomas Wayne rather than Bruce- is far smaller and more run-down than the traditional version, containing merely a couple of tables for Thomas to work on his equipment and a medical area, with a conventional computer in the upper manor, reflecting Thomas's more brutal and solitary M.O. as Batman as opposed to the more sophisticated training undertaken by his son.Flashpoint #2 In the 31st century, the Batcave has been long abandoned, although Cosmic Boy, Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad briefly infiltrate the cave while looking for evidence that Krypton existed to counter the xenophobic claims of the Justice League of Earth that Superman was a human given powers to fight against aliens.Action Comics (vol. 1) #859 In a possible future, Bruce Wayne has used a machine to download his memories and training- up to the point where he witnesses the bat and makes his vow to become Batman- into a series of clones of himself, each one aged to a point where they can act as Batman for around twenty-five years before they need to activate the new clone. By the time that the tenth generation clone is created, the Batcave has become a vast workshop, including a flying Batmobile, a robotic shark as a trophy, and costumes in glass cases, but the older Batman informs the new one that the contents of the cave will be burned upon his death so that the new Batman can make room for his own things while using the recorded memories to keep track of anything important from the past.Detective Comics (vol.2) #27 In the comic book continuation of the television series Smallville, Batman has a safe house in the form of a cargo ship, known as \\"Leviathan\\", docked at a hub in Metropolis. It is registered to a shell corporation in the Caribbean, thus protecting Bruce Wayne's secret. However, it is compromised by the Intergang, Prankster, and Mister Freeze. Lex Luthor is also aware of Leviathan's location due to his tracking of Superman's radiation signature with his satellites.Smallville Season 11 vol. 1 #5‚Äì8 (September ‚Äì December 2012) Wayne is later shown in the Batcave itself with Alfred when the Martian Manhunter infiltrates it to talk with Batman. ===Batman Beyond=== In the comic book series Batman Beyond 2.0, Terry no longer uses the Batcave following an argument with Bruce. He now uses Dick Grayson's apartment as his base of operations. When Terry is seriously injured in a battle with Rewire, he wakes up in the Batcave where Bruce has treated his injuries and left information regarding Rewire himself. He arrived there due to a built in subroutine in the suit that if the user is seriously injured or falls unconscious, the suit becomes automated and returns the user to the Batcave. After arriving in the universe controlled by the Justice Lords Terry encounters a version of himself who is a member of the Jokerz known as \\" T \\". Both McGinnis's arrive at Wayne Manor to find that it had been destroyed by the Justice Lords. A gang of Jokerz then proceed to attack them with T giving Terry enough time to make his way to the badly damaged Batcave. After exploring the cave he finds a number of damaged display cases which contain an unknown Batgirl suit, Justice Lord Batman suit and a Red Robin suit. He then discovers an armored and more powerful version of his own Batsuit which is powered by synthetic Kryptonite. After defeating the Jokerz gang he is confronted by Justice Lord Superman. Following the defeat of Lord Superman, T and Dick Grayson (of the Justice Lords universe) begin repairs to the Batcave and to the suit Terry found with the intention of T taking over as the new Batman and Dick becoming his mentor. They later help send Terry back to his own universe. ==In other media== ===Film=== Serials The Batcave first became part of the Batman mythos in the 1943 15-chapter movie serial Batman starring Lewis Wilson. In this version, as later in the comics, it was a small cave with a desk and rock walls lit up by candles. Behind the desk is a large black bat symbol. The cave is connected to a crime lab. Bats were depicted as flying around the cave, although only their shadows were visible. Batman uses these bats as a scare tactic to make an apprehended enemy reveal information. To prevent the enemy from escaping, an iron door covers the exit. The Batcave was also featured and expanded on in the 1949 serial Batman and Robin starring Robert Lowery. In this serial, there are filing cabinets and the cave now has a crime lab built in. The cave also contains the first incarnation of a batphone. In both serials, the cave is accessed by walking through a grandfather clock. Batman (TV series) The 1960s live-action Batman TV series featured the Batcave extensively, and portrayed it as a large but well-lit cavern containing an atomic power generator, a chemistry lab, punch-card computers, and other electronic crime-fighting devices, almost always prominently labeled with their function. In this incarnation, it primarily served as a crime lab and garage for the Batmobile. In this version, the Batcave is accessed from Wayne Manor via two Bat-Poles (one marked BRUCE and the other marked DICK), which are hidden behind a bookcase that can be opened by turning a switch hidden inside a bust of Shakespeare. When Bruce and Dick slide down these Bat- Poles, they are instantly outfitted in their costumes before reaching the landing pads at the bottom. The Bat-Poles can also be used to lift Bruce and Dick up from the Batcave to Wayne Manor by use of the steamjet-propelled landing pads. The Batcave is also accessible via a service elevator which is used by Alfred. The actual cave that the Batmobile is shown emerging from (and sometimes entering) in the TV show is located in the man-made filming location known as the \\"Bronson Caves,\\" in Griffith Park, below the Hollywood Sign. Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher films Batman (1989) The cave is present in Tim Burton's 1989 Batman feature film. The cave is shown to house the Batmobile, which is parked on a turntable-like platform at the edge of a large chasm filled with pipes. The Batmoblie enters the cave from a rock cliff/door. A huge switch turns on the lights in the cave. There are also bats roaming the cave. The cave also features the Batcomputer, which is on a metal platform. There is also an office-like workstation, some unspecified machinery and a large vault for Batman's costume. Batman Returns (1992) The cave is once again seen in Batman Returns, and Bruce gains access to it via a tube/elevator like passage from Wayne Manor, the entrance to which is hidden in an iron maiden, and is activated by flipping a small switch hidden on a small replica of Wayne Manor in the bottom of a fish tank. Alfred also confirms, in a throwaway remark, that there is a staircase to the cave. The cave was huge and well lit and featured a forensics lab, a computer, unspecified machines, a closet for the costumes, the Batmobile, and its repair tools. Batman Forever (1995) In this film, the Batcave is accessed through a rotating shelf which led to a staircase in Wayne Manor's silver closet, the only room in the mansion that is kept locked. The cave can also be reached via a secret tunnel system from Bruce Wayne's office at Wayne Enterprises, through which he rides down in a capsule. The capsule has a communication device Bruce used to communicate with Alfred. The cave features the main computer, as well as a crime lab (most of the machinery is unspecified) as well as a canal, which provides access to the sea for the Batboat. The cave also includes a lengthy tunnel used to launch the Batwing, which emerges from the cliffs underneath Wayne Manor. The cave features a rotating turntable that rises out of the floor, holding the Batmobile, and a large dome-like structure where Bruce's Batsuits and gadgets are stored. During an invasion of Wayne Manor by Riddler and Two Face, Riddler destroys the Batcomputer, the crime lab, every Batsuit except for a prototype with a new sonar system, and the Batmobile, although there is a lower section containing the Batboat and the Batplane that Batman and the new Robin use to confront the villains. In the deleted scenes, the Batcave has a secret section that Bruce fell as a child during the funeral of their parents. After Riddler's attack, Bruce and Alfred come to that place where Bruce fell back to where finding the diary of his father and confronting his biggest fear; the giant bat. Batman & Robin (1997) This incarnation of the cave features a multitude of flashing lights, mostly in neon. On the whole, this Batcave is similar to that in Batman Forever, only more garish in its decoration. A capsule containing Robin's Redbird motorcycle rises out of the floor, and a long tunnel lined with neon lights leads out of the cave. The turntable holding the batmobile returns, but in a more elaborate fashion. The cave features the area used to store Batman's costume and a place to store Robin's. The Dark Knight Trilogy Batman Begins In Batman Begins, the cave is still unfurnished, and the only things inside are a small workshop and a storage space for the Batsuit and its accessories, a medical area, and the Batmobile. The entrance and exit for the Batmobile are on a cliff, behind a waterfall. Alfred reveals to Bruce that during the Civil War, the Waynes used the vast cavern system as part of the Underground Railroad: after initially abseiling down a well (which Bruce fell down in his childhood) to get into the cave, they discover a hidden Civil War-era mechanical elevator which is still functional and leads to a hidden entrance in the mansion, which they then use as the primary means of entrance to the cave. The elevator is accessed by tapping three keys on a piano. Near the end of the film, when Bruce talks to Alfred about rebuilding the burnt-down main section of Wayne Manor, Alfred suggests they \\"improve the foundation\\", which may mean improving and furnishing the cave as they rebuild the mansion. The Dark Knight As Wayne Manor is still under construction in The Dark Knight, Batman's base of operations has been relocated to a large bunker beneath a shipping yard. One access point shown is through a shipping container which houses a secret hydraulic lift. The \\"Bat-bunker\\" also contains a wire mesh cage for the Batsuit, along with the associated weapons and tools, toolbox, and spare equipment for the Batmobile. In contrast to the Batcave, the large rectangular shaped room is brightly lit by banks of overhead fluorescent lights. Storage areas for the equipment are located both under the ground and within the walls giving the room a very empty appearance with the exception of a large bank of monitors to go with a well-developed computer system. In addition, the room is equipped with furnaces which Alfred uses to burn documents after Bruce decides to turn himself in. The Dark Knight Rises The Batcave reappears in The Dark Knight Rises in full working condition. To access the cave, a similar way to Batman Begins, tapping three keys on the piano will reveal a now modernly built elevator which takes the passenger straight to the cave. The newest addition to the cave is \\"The Bat\\", a flying tank aircraft built by Wayne Enterprises' Applied Science Division and a Batcomputer as well numerous landing pads and a locking case which contains the Batsuit. Added features included that the bridges used to gain access to different sections can be submerged as well as the platforms as a form of security measures in case anyone gains unauthorized access to the cave. While submerged the only visible object is a Batcomputer terminal which can only be accessed by either Bruce or Alfred's fingerprints and an access code. The cave from The Dark Knight appears as well, which contains weapons, supplies, and a back-up Batsuit. After Bruce Wayne is declared legally dead, his will is amended so that John Blake inherits GPS coordinates that lead him to the Batcave. DC Extended Universe Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice In this version, the Batcave is not located directly underneath Wayne Manor, but was originally in the woods on the manor's outskirts, with Bruce discovering the cave when he fell into them after running away during his parents' funeral. After Wayne Manor was destroyed in some unspecified fire, Bruce and Alfred relocated to a glass house built above the Batcave, which consists primarily of a long access passage that leads to a nearby lake and can be used for the Batmobile or (presumably) the Batplane to gain access. The elevator leading to the house also includes a chamber with an old Robin costume, apparently a memorial, while an upper level includes the Batcomputer and a workshop where Bruce and Alfred can work on Batman's various weapons, including the synthesiser used to distort his voice in the regular suit and the armour he uses to fight Superman. Justice League Following Superman's death, Bruce continues to operate out of the Batcave, which it is revealed also includes a large hangar where he has been working on a secret troop transport for the team he has been planning to create following Superman's death. As he works on the transport, he is visited by Diana, and notes that the cave's security cost him millions of dollars. Once the team of himself, Diana, Barry Allen, Victor Stone and Arthur Curry have come together for the first time to confront the powerful Steppenwolf, Bruce takes them to the Batcave to plan their next move, with an excited Barry Allen running all around the cave in seconds upon arrival. The Lego Batman Movie The Batcave is featured in The Lego Batman Movie. This version of the Batcave is more larger as it contains many versions of the Batmobile, Bat-themed vehicles and Batsuits. It is controlled by Batman's sentient, HAL-9000-like, Batcomputer (voiced by Siri), nicknamed 'Puter', who, as Batman enters the Batcave through a secret road on Wayne Island, asks him the password, which is \\"Iron Man sucks\\". ===Television=== Early appearances The Bat-Cave was first seen in animation in episodes of The Batman/Superman Hour, Super Friends, and The New Adventures of Batman. In these cartoons, the Batcomputer is present as usual. The voice of the Batcomputer was portrayed by Lou Scheimer in The New Adventures of Batman. DC Animated Universe Batman: The Animated Series In the Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"Beware the Gray Ghost\\", the Batcave is revealed to be an exact replica of the lair used by the Gray Ghost, a fiction- within-fiction character and idol to Bruce Wayne. There's also an exhibit of a collection of the Gray Ghost merchandise Bruce Wayne has collected since childhood. The Batcave gets introduced in this series as a large cavern. Bats are seen flying freely in the cave, with large naturally elevated platforms on which his sidekick Robin practices his balance. Batman often utilises the Batcomputer, impressive technology during the time the series was produced (early to mid-1990s), to research information on villains, from an anti-venom to Poison Ivy's plant poison to newspaper articles on the origin of Killer Croc. Batman's numerous crime-fighting vehicles are seen parked in an adjacent compartment to the Batcave, with an adjoining not-so-secret subterranean garage which stores Bruce Wayne's mammoth collection of vintage and luxury cars. In the episode \\"Almost Got 'Im\\", Two-Face uses a giant penny in an attempt to either crush Batman or kill him from the impact, depending on whichever side the giant coin landed on. Batman managed to free himself from the coin by slicing open the ropes. While telling the story of this to other Batman villains, Two-Face commented that Batman got to keep the giant coin. It is seen later in the series (and its spin-offs), in the Batcave. Several entrances to the cave are seen throughout the series. In early episodes, Batman is seen using an elevator that is accessed through a secret door hidden behind a bookcase. In later episodes, he is seen using the classic grandfather clock entrance from the comics. In certain episodes, the clock-entrance is opened by setting the hands of the clock the time Bruce's parents were killed (similar to certain comic book stories), while in The New Batman Adventures, Batman Beyond, and Justice League, the pendulum is pulled from behind the face of the clock to unlock the entrance. The New Batman Adventures In the 1998 episode \\"Mean Seasons\\" from The New Batman Adventures, Batman and Batgirl are forced to fight a giant mechanical T-Rex. The comic book tie-in to the Justice League Batman ‚Äì Batman Adventures #12 ‚Äì features a short called \\"The Hidden Display\\" which tells how a young Dick Grayson persuades Batman into keeping a robot T-Rex early on his career, which eventually leads to the Trophy Room of the Cave. Either one of these tales could be how the animated Batman obtained the dinosaur. An extensive training area allows Barbara Gordon to take on robots as part of her training. Batman Beyond This future Batcave of Batman Beyond replicas of Batman's enemies (both as wax dummies and robot combat trainers), and a display case with the many permutations of costumes of Robin, Batgirl, Nightwing, and Batman himself. Other items which have been shown to be in the Cave include the Freeze Gun and helmet of Mr. Freeze, the puppet Scarface, a 'shrine' to Bruce Wayne's childhood TV hero, the Gray Ghost, and the costumes of Harley Quinn, Penguin, Riddler, Mad Hatter, Firefly, and Catwoman. The cave itself throughout the series also projected a shade of purple on person or persons while in the cave, making it appear as if Bruce's black suit was purple and Terry's bat symbol composed of purple and red. During the series, Bruce typically remained in the Batcave to coordinate Terry's efforts over the suit's video-link, giving him information and/or offering advice, although he would enter the field if the situation desperately called for it. It also contains the original Batmobile and Batcomputer in the two part pilot, however by the subsequent episodes they had been removed and replaced with a new Batmobile which Terry uses throughout the series and feature film. How Bruce was able to refit and upgrade the Batcomputer and all other systems so quickly is never explained. During her debut, Inque managed to infiltrate the Batcave by latching onto the Batmobile and 'riding' it back to the cave, but Bruce was certain that she would never be able to find the cave again as it was a dark night and Terry drives too fast for Inque to have any hope of retracting her steps. Communications tycoon Robert Vance once managed to essentially infiltrate the cave by transferring his mind into the Batsuit, but he promptly departed to pursue his own agenda and was purged from the suit in the subsequent fight. Gossip reporter Ian Peek was also able to access the cave using stolen technology that allowed him to phase through solid matter, but his discovery proved irrelevant when over-use of the technology caused him to become permanently intangible and fall into Earth's core before he could share that information with anyone else. In Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, the reborn Joker- revealed over the course of the film to be essentially a 'clone' of the deceased villain, his DNA and personality encoded on a microchip in the back of Tim Drake's neck that can take over his body- breaks into the cave and nearly poisons Bruce with the Joker's lethal laughing gas, but his attack provides a clue that helps Terry later determine the true nature of the returned clown, and all evidence suggests that he did not share his knowledge of Batman's true identity even with his new gang owing to his desire to torment his foes privately. Justice League In the Justice League animated series, the members of the League seek refuge in the Batcave during the Thanagarian invasion. Later, they also confront Hawkgirl in the cave, and use the Batcomputer to track her movements. When the Batcave comes under siege from the Thanagarians, one attempts to use Mr. Freeze's Freeze Gun on Superman; Superman repels the attack with a gust of wind, freezing the soldier. Flash also tips the infamous giant penny onto some of the attacking Thangarians (\\"Tails! I win!\\"). In a humorous scene, he also points to the T-Rex, stating \\"That's a giant dinosaur!\\", at which point Alfred states \\"And I thought Batman was the detective\\". It is assumed the League used the cave as a headquarters until the new Watchtower is built, as they decide Hawkgirl's fate in Wayne Manor in the wake of the invasion. The Batman The Batman, the animated series that debuted in 2004, features a much more high-tech Batcave, with large computer displays and flashing blue lights. Among these displays are the \\"Bat-Wave\\" warning signals, an alternate way of calling upon the Caped Crusader before the Bat-Signal went into service. Bruce Wayne is seen mostly without his Batsuit or with his cowl removed while in the cave, unlike in the earlier animated series. As a throwback to the old Adam West TV show, the cave has assorted 'Bat-poles' for Batman and Robin which allowed them from level to level in a faster manner. Unlike the old series, it does not allow for instant costume changes. The elevator system is featured quite a bit as well. A similar trophy room, this time storing memorabilia seen in earlier episodes such as The Riddler's giant hourglass and The Joker's giant playing card trap, appears in the series. The series also shows that it was Alfred Pennyworth who started the museum, hoping it would be useful if the city of Gotham ever fully accepted Batman, somewhat like the Flash Museum. The cave was also the location of Season 3's climatic finale, \\"Gotham's Ultimate Criminal Mastermind\\", in which the villainous robot D.A.V.E. attempts to kill Alfred using an array of trophies garnered by the Batman, putting the Dark Knight in a position where he had to choose between revealing his secret identity to all of Gotham City, or allowing Alfred to be killed by the trap. However, even the Batcave isn't impervious to damage. In one episode, a loose raccoon causes a short circuit and subsequent blackout of electricity in the cave. In the direct-to-video film The Batman vs. Dracula, it said that Batman's cave is in fact part of a series of Catacombs under Gotham City, which Batman uses to lure Dracula to the cave and subsequently kill him with the new solar generator. On the episode \\"Joker's Express,\\" it is revealed that the Batcave is also connected to some old mines beneath the city when Gotham was a thriving coal-mining town in the late 19th century. In the Season 4 episode \\"Artifacts\\", archaeologists from the future unearth the Batcave. Its titanium supports are printed with binary code, as the computer information would not survive that long. The archaeologists theorize that Thomas Wayne was Batman and that Bruce Wayne was Robin. In another segment of the episode, set in 2027, Barbara Gordon (as the Oracle) is shown at the Batcomputer in the Batcave. Her wheelchair is also uncovered in the cave by the archaeologists, who believe that it was Alfred who used it. Unlike in many previous incarnations of the Batcave which show only one exit/entrance, the Batmobile and other vehicles exit the cave through a variety of concealed dead-ends and disguised construction sites scattered around Gotham City. Batman also established a series of satellite Batcaves across Gotham on the show. Batcave South-Central debuted on the episode \\"Strange New World\\". In \\"The Joining, Part One\\", it is revealed that Lucius Fox helped the Batman in constructing the Batcave, and all of the Dark Knight's other secret safehouses throughout Gotham. Another satellite Batcave debuted on the episode \\"The Batman/Superman Story, Part One\\", under Wayne Industries which served as his new tech lab. In the episode, \\"The End of The Batman \\", the villainous anti-Batman and Robin team, known as The Wrath and his sidekick, Scorn, break into the Batcave, and attempt to kill Batman and Robin, causing large amounts of damage in the process. By the time of the two part finale involving all members of the Justice League the cave has been fully repaired. Batman: The Brave and the Bold In Batman: The Brave and the Bold, the Batcave makes its first appearance in the episode \\"Deep Cover for Batman,\\" when Owlman attacks Batman inside it. In the following episode, \\"Game Over for Owlman,\\" Batman brings the Joker, who is at the time partnered with him, to the cave (The Joker accidentally sprayed himself with knockout gas before and after they were in the Batcave, so he couldn't possibly know where the cave's location is). A number of trophies displayed include a giant clam and oversized-slot-machine- themed electric chair, death traps formerly used by the Joker, in reference to the 1960s TV show. The entrance to this Batcave can be seen briefly in The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Color of Revenge.\\" It appears to be very similar to the Batman TV series Batcave. In The Siege of Starro Part 1, Faceless Hunter attacks Batman in the Batcave. In the episode \\"Darkseid Descending\\", a reserve Batcave (very similar to the \\"Bat-Bunker\\" in The Dark Knight) is located inside the Lincoln Memorial. In \\"Menace of the Conquer Caveman\\" Booster Gold mentions that the Batcave will be converted into a historical attraction with its own built-in roller coaster in the 25th century. In \\"The Last Bat on Earth\\", Batman goes to the Batcave to use technology from his era to defeat Gorilla Grodd and his army of intelligent apes in Kamandi's time. A group of humanoid \\"Man-Bats\\" made the cave their home after the Great Disaster and are driven out by Batman and Kamandi.  Teen Titans  In the episode \\"Haunted\\", the Batcave makes an appearance when Raven enters Robin's mind.  Young Justice  In the episode \\"Downtime\\", Alfred and Bruce Wayne are both seen in the Batcave observing Robin's behavior.  Beware the Batman  In this version the entrance to the Bat Cave is hidden behind a large fireplace in Wayne's trophy room. Batman brings unconscious guests in, such as Man-Bat and Manhunter, for questioning. The latter was drugged and blindfolded before being brought in for security measures. In the season finale, Deathstroke infiltrates the Batcave, takes Alfred hostage, and sets up explosives in order to detonate them and destroy the Batcave and everyone in it. Batman has a climatic final showdown against Deathstroke, while Katana, Oracle, Metamorpho, and Man-Bat spread out to take down and dispose of the explosives. Gotham A cave appears in the interior of Wayne Manor in the five seasons of the FOX TV series Gotham. The cave was never built or showed when in the series, not even the finale when Bruce Wayne becomes Batman. Batwoman In the TV series Batwoman, Bruce has a Batcave in Wayne Towers which is use by his cousin Kate and Luke Fox. ===Video games=== Also in the 2008 video game Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, the Batcave is one of the fighting arenas. Injustice In the video game Injustice: Gods Among Us, the Batcave is a level in the game, where the fighters can use Batman's various weapons and vehicles to damage their opponent; Green Arrow faces a villainous Wonder Woman and Black Adam in the Batcave when attempting to acquire a Kryptonite weapon to defeat the corrupted Superman of an alternate reality, and the 'true' Batman faces the alternate Batman in a fight in the Batcave to convince him to go along with the plan of summoning the Superman of their world to defeat the villainous Superman of the alternate world. A new version of the Batcave appears as a level in Injustice 2. This version was originally the Gotham Underground Subway built by Bruce's great- grandfather. It's also where Bruce keeps his communications and surveillance hub, Brother Eye. It is currently unknown if Batman reclaimed the original Batcave and Wayne Manor after the fall of Superman and The Regime. Lego Batman The Batcave is also featured in the 2012 video game Lego Batman 2: DC Superheroes which features three parking 'areas' for land, sea and air based vehicles and their appropriate exits from the cave, the Batcomputer, used to replay past levels and 'warp' to various landmarks in Gotham and other elements shown in Batman media such as a waterfall, a Lincoln Penny and an animatronic T-Rex. Batman: Arkham In the 2009 video game Batman: Arkham Asylum, Batman can access a secret auxiliary Batcave hidden within the cave system beneath Arkham Island after the Joker takes control of the asylum. This Batcave is small and fairly spartan (in comparison with Batman's primary Batcave), containing only two small platforms, a Batcomputer, and one of Batman's Batwing planes. Near the end of the game this cave was partially destroyed by Poison Ivy. Although not featured in the main story, the Batcave does appear as a downloadable challenge map in the 2011 video game sequel Batman: Arkham City. During the main story, Batman is able to access the Batcomputer's database via his batsuit and can upload data to Alfred who can analyze it using the Batcomputer back at the Batcave. The Batcave is accessible in the main campaign of Batman: Arkham Origins. From the cave the player can use the Batwing fast travel system, switch to alternate skins and enter the challenge map rooms as opposed to selecting from the main menu as in previous Arkham games. Alfred is also present in the cave, supplying Batman with gadget upgrades. The Batcave is heavily damaged by Bane during the game's climax. It is still damaged during the DLC Cold, Cold Heart, set on New Year's Eve, just after the events of the main game. Although the Batcave is not accessible in Batman: Arkham Knight, Alfred co-ordinates all activity during the mission from the cave. He also activates the Knightfall Protocol from within the cave using Bruce's voice authorization password \\"Martha\\". When Wayne Manor was destroyed after Bruce activates the protocol, it is unknown if the Batcave survived the explosion. Throughout the game, both Batman and Robin utilize a Bat-Bunker of sorts underneath Panessa Studios, where Robin works to find a cure for those infected by Joker's blood in the previous game. The bunker contains holding cells for each infected patient, as well as medical equipment and a Bat-computer. ==References== ==External links== *Movie Poop Shoot Article on Batman, including a Batcave section *The Origin of the Bat Cave A blog post by Bill Jourdain about the earliest comics appearances of the Batcave *Top 10 Batcave Trophies Article on ComicsBulletin about the Batcave Hall of Trophies Category:Gotham City Category:1943 in comics Category:Fictional museums Category:Fictional secret bases Category:Fictional caves Category:Fictional elements introduced in the 1940s ","title":"Batcave"},{"id":"305535","text":"UNR can mean: * National University of Rwanda () * University of Nevada, Reno * National University of Rosario (), Argentina * Ukrainian People's Republic (), a Ukrainian nation-state established in 1917 and conquered by Bolsheviks in 1919 * Union for the New Republic (), a defunct Gaullist French political party * Ubuntu Netbook Remix, an official Ubuntu distribution for netbooks, which was renamed to Ubuntu Netbook Edition in April 2010 ","title":"UNR"},{"id":"305538","text":"GY Andromedae (GY And) is an Œ±2 Canum Venaticorum type variable star in the northern constellation Andromeda. Its brightness fluctuates in visual magnitude between 6.27m and 6.41m, making it a challenge to view with the naked eye even in good seeing conditions. The magnetic activity on this star shows an unusually long period of variability, cycling about once every 23 years. Based upon parallax measurements, this star is located at a distance of about from the Earth. This is classified as an Ap/Bp star, with a peculiar spectrum showing lines of chromium and europium that change in intensity over a period matching the variability cycle, although opposite in phase. Its most striking characteristic is the presence of the unstable element promethium in its emission spectrum. All isotopes of this element are radioactive with half lives of 17.7 years or less. The promethium in the outer envelope may be generated by the spontaneous fission of higher mass transuranic elements. ==System== Based on radial velocity measurements taken at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory between 1927 and 1935 Canadian astronomer William Edmund Harper strongly suspected that this star is a spectroscopic binary. In 1958, American astronomer Horace W. Babcock confirmed the binary nature of the star. It has an orbital period of 273 days with a large eccentricity of 0.47. The two components are separated by an estimated distance of at least , or 0.25 Astronomical Units. ==References== ==External links== * Astronomie: Die Sterne - Special Stars: GY Andromedae Category:Andromeda (constellation) Category:Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum variables Category:B-type main-sequence stars Category:Spectroscopic binaries 0465 007651 009996 Andromedae, GY Category:Durchmusterung objects ","title":"GY Andromedae"},{"id":"305544","text":"Henry Massie Rector (May 1, 1816 ‚Äì August 12, 1899) was an American farmer and lawyer who served as the sixth governor of Arkansas from 1860 to 1862. == Early life and education == Henry Massie Rector was born in Louisville, Kentucky. His Rector family descended from the German-speaking families of Germanna in the Colony of Virginia, though both parents were also of English descent.Biographical and pictorial history of Arkansas, Volume 1 By John Hallum page 405 He was educated by his mother and attended two years of school in Louisville.

These roses are often given as gifts on special occasions like Mother's Day, Valentine‚Äôs Day, wedding anniversaries, birthdays, and other celebrations and events. The idea behind gold-dipped roses is to preserve the elegance and beauty of a rose forever in a metal that is just as exquisite and valuable as the rose itself, and to make a permanent and lasting expression of the emotions expressed by the giving of roses. ==History== The concept of gold- dipped roses has been around for quite a long time. However, the techniques of making a rose have improved, paying special attention to intricate details, so that all the features of a rose are enhanced, protected, and beautified. If the process of gold-dipping, the rose and the gold used are of good quality, the gold-dipped rose can be made to last a lifetime. ==Varieties== Other varieties of dipped roses include silver, platinum, and even tin roses. Petals, leaves, and rose orchids are also dipped in precious metals for preservation and decoration. ==Procedure== Different companies have different techniques and procedures for making gold-dipped roses, and most of the steps involved are patented by each company and are trade secrets. Dipping or plating a rose is a time-consuming and painstaking process that involves multiple steps and weeks to prepare the finished product. ===Method=== Some companies claim that it requires 60 steps and 3 months of delicate processing to make a gold-dipped rose, while others profess that it requires 30 days to make the end product. However, the basic procedure, especially for small-scale processing, is the same; a rose, grown especially for the purpose of dipping or plating, is cut and layered with lacquer or an electrophoresing chemical and then dipped in molten gold (or another metal) to make a hard shell of metal. At the commercial level, several companies use the process of electroplating the rose with gold for a more durable and professional look. Simplified steps of the process are as below: # Select a healthy and purpose- grown rose which is not yet fully bloomed. # Hand paint or spray the rose with lacquer or an electrophoresing chemical so that the metal will stick to it. Let the chemical dry. This may take a day. # Melt the gold, and dip the rose in it bud-first, holding by the stem, for between 60 and 90 seconds, depending upon the desired thickness of the metal. If a light coating is required, dip it for less than 60 seconds, or for a heavier coating, let it dip for more than 90 seconds. # An alternative method which is especially used for commercial processing, is complete electroplating of the rose first with metals such as copper, and then a final coating of gold. # Let it dry till a hard shell is formed, which may take a couple of days, depending on factors like wind and humidity. The idea is to preserve the delicacy, features, and pattern of the rose so that it is evident even through the gold plating. ==Cost== Gold-dipped roses are available for anywhere between $69 to $299, depending on the technique and vendors, the karat of the gold that is used for dipping, and the thickness of the coating. Some cheaper roses are coated with tin and then lightly sprayed with gold of a lesser quality, like 10 karat. Good quality roses are dipped in 24K gold, and hence are expensive. ==References== Category:Roses ","title":"Gold-dipped roses"},{"id":"305550","text":"Elias Nelson Conway (May 17, 1812 ‚Äì February 28, 1892) was an American politician who served as the 5th Governor of Arkansas from 1852 to 1860. ==Early life== Conway was born in Greeneville, Tennessee. Born into a political family, Elias Nelson Conway was the younger brother of Henry Wharton Conway, who served as territorial delegate to several Congresses, and James Sevier Conway, who became the first governor of Arkansas when it was admitted as a state in 1836. When he was a boy, his family moved from Tennessee to Missouri. Conway attended Bonne Femme Academy in Boone County, Missouri. His older brother Henry died in 1827 as a result of a duel with a former friend, Robert Crittenden. In 1833, Conway moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, where his older brothers had settled. He studied surveying. In 1835, he was appointed as the state auditor, and served until 1849. Natural Steps by David Dale Owen ==Political career== In 1844, Elias Conway was offered, and declined, the Democratic nomination for governor. When offered the nomination again in 1852, he accepted. With a successful campaign, he was elected as Governor of Arkansas. He was reelected to a second term in 1856. His administration focused on physical improvements to the state: roads and other infrastructure to encourage development. He formed the Chancery Courts and eased the state's financial problems. When Conway left office in 1860, the state treasury held a surplus. Conway formed the Geological Survey of Arkansas, commissioning Principal Geologist David Dale Owen, to survey the territory west of Little Rock and provide a report on the area. The 'Natural Steps' were first written about and drawn by Owen, in his Second Report of a Geological Reconnaissance of the Middle and Southern Counties of Arkansas (1859). ==Personal life== Conway was first cousin to Senator Ambrose Hundley Sevier and Governor Henry M.

The first major musical figure from District of Columbia was John Philip Sousa, a military brass band composer. Later figures include jazz musicians, such as Duke Ellington, Charlie Rouse, Buck Hill, Ron Holloway, Davey Yarborough, Michael A. Thomas, Butch Warren, and DeAndrey Howard; soul musicians, including Billy Stewart, The Unifics, The Moments, Ray, Goodman & Brown, Van McCoy, The Presidents, The Choice Four, Vernon Burch, guitarist Charles Pitts(OST\\"Shaft\\",1971), and Sir Joe Quarterman & Free Soul. The District is home to the Washington Symphony Orchestra, the Washington National Opera, the National Symphony Orchestra (founded in 1931 by Hans Kindler), the DC Legendary Musicians Inc. a nonprofit founded by Rev. Dr. Sandra Butler Truesdale (founded in 2002) www.dclmusicians.org and the DC Youth Orchestra Program (founded in 1960). The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is a nationally important venue for a variety of musical performances, many of which are presented by Washington Performing Arts Society, an independent, non-profit organization founded by impresario Patrick Hayes. Washingtonian magazine maintains a Washington Music Hall of Fame. The United States Marine Band, and United States Navy Band are both based in Washington, D.C. The Marine Band is the oldest musical group in the United States (formed in 1798, before the District's founding). The U.S. Marine Band's most famous conductor is John Philip Sousa, who composed many of the most famous American marches, as well as several musical comedies. The U.S. Navy Band's director throughout the 1960s was LCDR Anthony A. Mitchell who composed the march \\"Our Nation's Capital\\", the official march of Washington, D.C., as well as the \\"John F. Kennedy Cultural Center March\\", and the \\"National Capitol Parks March\\". ==Music history== John Philip Sousa (1900) The U.S. Marine Band was founded in 1798. Some fifty years later, in 1851, the District's first choral society, the Washington Saengerbund, was formed. Other 19th century musicians included the minstrel singer and songwriter James Bland (\\"Carry Me Back to Old Virginny\\"). In 1872, the Coloured American Opera Society formed. Washington native John Philip Sousa was conductor of the U.S. Marine Band from 1880 to 1892. He wrote 132 marches, including \\"The Washington Post\\" and \\"The Stars and Stripes Forever\\". Sousa formed his own band after leaving the Marine Corps that performed 15,623 concerts worldwide. Duke Ellington receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969 Later groundbreaking musicians included James Reese Europe, ragtime musician Claude Hopkins, Lithuanian immigrant and vaudeville performer Al Jolson and Lillian Evanti, who became the first African-American opera singer to perform in a foreign country. The most widely renowned musician from 20th century District of Columbia is undoubtedly Duke Ellington, a jazz pioneer. Later District of Columbia jazz musicians included Charlie Rouse (saxophonist, with Thelonious Monk), Billy Hart (drummer), Ira Sullivan (tenor saxophonist) and Leo Parker (bop baritone saxophonist). Ahmet Ertegun, a Turkish-born jazz fan, came to District of Columbia at age twelve and later went on to found Atlantic Records. Todd Duncan was a District of Columbia-born singer who made history by being the first to play the lead of the opera Porgy and Bess; he later became the first black man to play Tonio in Pagliacci. District of Columbia was also a home (and recording stop) for Jelly Roll Morton, Jimmie Rodgers and Bo Diddley. Local stars of the early part of the century include the singer Pearl Bailey. In 1957, Elizabeth Cotten recorded for the family that employed her, which included a number of composers and musicologists. One song, \\"Freight Train\\", became a folk music standard. Charlie Byrd, a District of Columbia-based jazz musician, recorded an innovative album in 1962 called Jazz Samba with Stan Getz, helping to launch the bossa nova craze. By the middle of the 1960s, District of Columbia had begun to produce some major stars, like soul singer Marvin Gaye, who had 3 No. 1 Hot 100 hits including \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" in 1968. Other musicians included John Fahey, one of the first \\"folk\\" musicians to gain national appeal, Peter Tork (of The Monkees), Tim Buckley, guitarist Link Wray, pop singer and songwriter Billy Stewart, country singer Patsy Cline, guitarists Gregory Gaskins played with Jersey Cities Manhattan's and later Elvis Presley Danny Gatton, Skip Pitts played the famous riffs on Isaac Hayes's John Shaft doo-wop bands The Orioles (based out of District of Columbia, though from Baltimore), The Clovers, The Rainbows Scott McKenzie (known for \\"If You're Going to San Francisco\\"), Sinbad, R&B; singer Ruth Brown, and country star Roy Clark. During this period, Washington began to develop its own music scene, with a number of styles evolving by the end of the century. Some popular singers from later decades include Roberta Flack (#1 hit \\"Killing Me Softly with His Song\\"), Root Boy Slim & the Sex Change Band (\\"You Broke My Mood Ring\\"), singer-songwriter Tori Amos, Herb Fame (of Peaches & Herb) who had the No. 1 Hot 100 hit \\"Reunited\\", Van McCoy (disco producer, No. 1 hit \\"The Hustle\\"), Toni Braxton, Ginuwine, M√Ωa, Dave Grohl (of Nirvana and the Foo Fighters), Vertical Horizon (#1 Hot 100 hit \\"Everything You Want\\" in 2000; Matt Scannell attended Georgetown University), Starland Vocal Band (#1 Hot 100 hit \\"Afternoon Delight\\"), Joan Jett (rock singer with No. 1 hit \\"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\\") and Nils Lofgren (guitarist for Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr, and Neil Young). Washington is also home to the Duke Ellington School of the Arts, founded in 1974 and part of the DC public school system. Some other notable music education organizations which are located in Washington include the DC Youth Orchestra Program, founded in 1960; the Blues Alley Jazz Society, founded in 1985;, Levine School of Music, founded in 1976 and the DC Legendary Musicians Inc, founded by Rev. Dr. Sandra Butler-Truesdale in 2006. ==Musical genres== === Choral === The Washington metropolitan area is considered by many to be the choral capital of the nation.Midgette, Anne, \\"New groups like National Master Chorale signal key change in the District of Columbia choral scene\\", Staff Writer, Washington Post, December 19, 2009. Retrieved: September 2, 2011. Some choral groups active in the District today can trace their origins as far back as 1851, with a Choral Society being established to produce concerts and oratorios at least as early as the 1880s. In the modern era, the District features several independently-established symphonic choruses, along with a very wide variety of mid-size choirs, chamber ensembles, and specialty groups. The District has been described as \\"the only locality in America where there is a chorus for every type of niche.\\" ===Opera=== The first established opera company in the District of Columbia was the semi-professional Washington National Opera active from 1919 through 1936; it performed in venues ranging from local school auditoriums to DAR Constitution Hall.McPherson, Jim, \\"Mr. Meek Goes to Washington: The Story of the Small-Potatoes Canadian Baritone Who Founded America's 'National' Opera,\\" The Opera Quarterly, volume 20, no. 2, Spring 2004. The present, entirely unrelated company of the same name, resident at the Kennedy Center, was known simply as the Washington Opera until 2000; a thoroughly professional organization under the direction of Pl√°cido Domingo, it has, among other achievements, been a rare advocate for zarzuela in the United States.Holland, Bernard, \\"NATIONAL OPERA REVIEW; Domingo Applies His Personal Touch to an Operetta's Familiar Tale,\\" The Washington Post, November 9, 2004. Among other, smaller-scale companies in the District of Columbia metropolitan area are the Washington Concert Opera, which specializes in unstaged presentations; Opera Lafayette, which specializes in French baroque opera; and Aurora Opera Theatre, formerly known as Opera Theatre of Northern Virginia. ===Blues=== Early in the 20th century, the District of Columbia was home to many bluesmen, such as Jelly Roll Morton and later rock and roll and rhythm and blues musicians such as Bo Diddley and Roy Buchanan. In the 1960s, a number of white youths formed local blues bands, including the Northside Blues Band and the Nighthawks. Starting in the early 1960s, Takoma Park native John Fahey became a nationally noted blues and folk guitarist who established the Takoma Records label, which attracted a number of other blues, folk, acoustic and fingerstyle guitarists to the District of Columbia area. Another local blues rock performer is Tom Principato. ===Bluegrass=== In the 1950s, Buzz Busby and the Bayou Boys became a noted bluegrass band that helped District of Columbia become known as the \\"Bluegrass Capital of America\\" in the 1950s and early 1960s. Later bluegrass bands from the District included the Country Gentlemen. Seldom Scene eventually became the District's most prominent and longest-lasting bluegrass band. The Washington bluegrass community extends into outlying areas such as Western Maryland and the panhandle of West Virginia which are home to bluegrass musicians who commute to perform in the area. There has been substantial overlap between Washington, D.C.'s folk and bluegrass scene in the past several decades, in part due to the patronage of disc jockeys at public radio station WAMU, including Mary Cliff, longtime host of the music show Traditions. ===Folk=== Folk clubs began springing up in the District of Columbia in the late 1950s. One of the earliest folk venues was at the Hamilton Arms Coffee House, which was founded in 1939 in Georgetown at 1232 31st Street NW. By the mid-1950s, Hamilton Arms was hosting \\"poetry readings, live music performances, art shows, movies, green tea (marijuana), and sometimes even coffee.\\" After closing in 1957, other venues began to appear, including Coffee N' Confusion located briefly at 912 New Hampshire Avenue NW before moving to a basement location at 945 K Street NW. It has been noted that rock musician Jim Morrison, who lived in Northern Virginia up until 1961, performed his first poems at Coffee N' Confusion. In January 1961, the Unicorn Cafe Expresso was opened at 1710 17th Street NW, featuring abstract art, coffee, poetry readings, and music. Founded by Yuri Kapralof and Roger Kaufman, the Unicorn became an important venue for up and coming folk musicians, especially after Kaufman and Kapralof sold the Unicorn to Elliott Ryan. With Hootenannys on Wednesday evening and more live performances, the Unicorn established its reputation as a music venue, where the likes of touring musicians Joan Baez, Erik Darling, and Pete LaFarge often performed along with local guitarists like John Fahey, Robbie Basho, Pat Sullivan and Max Ochs. Another important folk venue in Georgetown in 1961 was The Shadows. A band called \\"the Mugwumps\\" formed, eventually splitting up. Two of the members, John Sebastian and Zal Yanovsky, became The Lovin' Spoonful, and the other two, Denny Doherty and Cass Elliott, formed The Mamas & the Papas. Later, in Georgetown, then-folk singer John Denver, Taffy Nivert and Bill Danoff wrote a song called \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\", which launched Denver's career as one of the most popular singers in the country. Other popular folk singers include Mary Chapin Carpenter; the duo Cathy Fink & Marcy Marxer have been nominated for several Grammy Awards, for both folk and children's music. ===Jazz=== The District of Columbia has been home to many jazz pioneers, including the legendary Duke Ellington, as well as singer and pianist Shirley Horn, pianist Billy Taylor, and saxophonist Frank Wess. Ellington, Taylor, and Wess each attended Dunbar High School with its prominent music program. Ellington's first group, The Washingtonians, featured drummer Sonny Greer. They left for Harlem in 1923. Jazz great Jelly Roll Morton came from New Orleans, but took up residency in Washington as a regular performer at a club called the Jungle Inn in 1935. During the first half of the 20th century, in a segregated District, the U Street Corridor became the economic, cultural, entertainment and jazz hub of the District of Columbia, earning it the nickname \\"Black Broadway\\". The National Trust for Historic Preservation defines walking tours that include the jazz venues where the greats such as Ella Fitzgerald performed, Duke Ellington's childhood homes, and other music-related places in the neighborhood.National Trust for Historic Preservation, \\"Explore Washington, D.C.'s Historic Black Broadway on U Street\\" Historic jazz club Bohemian Caverns launched many music careers, including that of R&B; singer Ruth Brown. Pianist Ramsey Lewis recorded his The in Crowd album there in 1965. During the second half of the 20th century until the mid-1990s, a period that saw decline on U Street, jazz became associated with longtime venues in the Georgetown area such as Blues Alley and One Step Down; closer to the heart of the District was dc space. Subsequently, jazz saw a resurgence on U Street, with venues such as Bohemian Caverns and Republic Gardens re-opening. Local singer Eva Cassidy, a native of Bowie, Maryland, died of cancer at the age of 33 but received posthumous international fame when several of her songs received BBC Radio airplay, though she was already well known in the Washington area, after a farewell concert at The Bayou. A singer in multiple genres, Cassidy also notably performed a crossover album with District of Columbia go-go artist Chuck Brown (see below). Multi- instrumentalist Andrew White has been performing and releasing records in DC since his debut record in 1961, The JFK Quintet, who released two monumental LPs on Riverside Records for Cannonball Adderley. Since then he has continued releasing albums, books, transcripts, and other publications for his self- produced label, Andrew's Music. Tenor saxophonist Ron Holloway is a Washington, D.C. native. Ron began playing saxophone at an early age one of his first music experiences was with The El Corols, where he met another great DC saxophonist, Carter Jefferson. His journeyman years sitting in with local groups from every genre of contemporary music. In the mid-1970s, Holloway expanded his practice of sitting in and more and more he was heard sharing the stage with the likes of Freddie Hubbard, Sonny Rollins and Dizzy Gillespie. In February 1982 Holloway joined Gil Scott-Heron's group. In June 1989, he left Scott-Heron to join Dizzy Gillespie's Quintet. Known for his versatility he has toured and recorded with a wide array of musical artists including Gillespie, Scott-Heron, Root Boy Slim, Little Feat, the Allman Brothers Band, Gov't Mule, Derek Trucks and Susan Tedeschi. He has released five CD's under his own name. ===Progressive Rock/Psych=== In the late 1960 and early 70s, a variety of DC groups pushed the rock envelope, forming bands and securing record deals. The Fallen Angels were one of the first national psychedelic bands from DC, releasing two records on Roulette in the late 1960s. Lead singer, writer, and musician Jack Bryant headed up a band that played up and down the east coast, as well as an occasional west coast show. ===Soul and funk=== The District of Columbia's Soul/Funk movement took shape during the mid-60s; about the same time Doo-Wop change to soul chorus group(The TemptationsÔΩû), and \\"James Brown\\" became a big name. Parliament's 1975 song \\"Chocolate City,\\" with vocals spoken by George Clinton, references and celebrates the District of Columbia as a majority black District. Artists such as Marvin Gaye, Black Heathttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/black-heat- mn0000092301, Experience Unlimited(E.U.), The Moments, The Unifics, Peaches & Herb, Terry Huff & Special Deliveryhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/terry-huff- mn0000028733, Act 1, The Dynamic Superiours, Sir Joe Quarterman & Free Soul, Chuck Brown & the Soul Searchers , Van McCoy, The Presidents, Anacostia, Vernon Burch, Ray, Goodman & Brown, True Reflection, The Unifics, Peaches & Herb, Act 1, The Dynamic Superiors, Skip Mahoaney & the Caduals, Dyson's Face, Bobby Thurston, Charles Pitts(OST\\"Shaft\\",1971), The Choice Four, and The Fuzz, Billy Stewart were form Washington, D.C.. 80s funk bands such as Osiris, Wax, Waldo, Tyrone Brunson influenced go-go bands. Minor group Aggression released 2 singles(roots of go-go) from SRI Records. Producer Maxx Kidd founded T.T.E.D. Records. ===R&B;=== The soul and funk scene set the stage for District of Columbia's considerable influence in modern R&B.; Besides Toni Braxton, District of Columbia is the hometown of mid-1990s crooners Ginuwine, M√Ωa, and Tank (raised in Clinton, MD), as well as the more current J. Holiday, Raheem DeVaughn and Reesa Renee (who are both from the neighboring Prince George's County, Maryland). Central Heat, an East Coast touring R&B; band based out of Northern Virginia originated in the late 1970s and features founding members Doug and Dennis Flynn, Mike Cavaliere and Bob Costlow. Central Heat remains active in the DC club scene today. Johnny Gill, II D Extreme, and Stacy Lattisaw are also from the District of Columbia. Independent artist Dane Riley, is the cousin to late legendary Washington, DC singer Billy Stewart. ===Go-go=== The go-go sound developed during the mid-1970s and began to take its current shape by the late '70s, and has become known as District of Columbia's answer to hip-hop. Its characteristic formula combined simple funk grooves with instrumental percussion and often rapping. It is a blend of funk, R&B;, and early hip-hop, with a focus on lo-fi percussion instruments and melodic jamming in place of dance tracks, although some sampling is used. As such, it is primarily a dance music with an emphasis on live audience call and response. Go-go rhythms are also incorporated into street percussion. Many District of Columbia soul & funk artists contributed to the characteristic go-go sound, but the main pioneers were The Young Senators, also known as \\"The Emperors of Go-go\\", known for their hit tune \\"Jungle\\", and Chuck Brown & the Soul Searchers, known for \\"Bustin' Loose\\", which became a surprise national hit. Later go-go bands include Rare Essence, Trouble Funk, Experience Unlimited, Rare Essence, Hot Cold Sweat, AM/FM, The Junkyard Band, Slug-Go and the Southeast go-go band Aggressive Funk. Bands such as Backyard, TCB, and UCB have gained recognition by being featured in music by rapper, Wale. ===Hardcore=== The District of Columbia is primarily known in the rock community for its seminal influence on the evolution of hardcore punk, known locally as harDCore, particularly through bands such as Bad Brains, Minor Threat, and The Faith, and labels like Dischord Records, but it had a vibrant musical community prior to hardcore's arrival with bands like the Razz, Slickee Boys, Insect Surfers, Tru Fax and the Insaniacs, and The Penetrators, putting out records on local independent labels like Limp, Wasp, and Dacoit. Ian MacKaye, the frontman for Minor Threat, became an inspiration in part for the international Straight Edge movement after the song \\"Straight Edge\\" was released. MacKaye went on to co-found Fugazi, which attained international recognition under the Dischord record label, alongside Rites of Spring guitarist Guy Picciotto. Henry Rollins, a native of the District of Columbia hardcore scene, moved to Los Angeles in 1981 to join Black Flag. ===Emo=== In the mid-1980s, veterans of the D.C. hardcore scene created a new punk subgenre called \\"emo\\", meaning \\"emotive hardcore.\\" This term has since evolved to become associated with a much broader group of musical styles. The most renowned District of Columbia area bands associated with the \\"first wave\\" of emo were Rites of Spring and Embrace. ===Punk=== In the 1980s, the District of Columbia, was rich with punk and new wave music. Bands like The Slickee Boys, Urban Verbs, Tiny Desk Unit, Mother May I, Insect Surfers, Tru Fax & the Insaniacs, and Black Market Baby were popular at places like the 9:30 Club, The Psychedeli, dc space, Madam's Organ, The Bayou (in Georgetown). See also: Bad Brains, Minor Threat, Henry Rollins. In the 1970s and 1980s, Georgetown had a diverse live music scene, and became known as a center for the early punk community. In the 1990s, U Street NW in the Shaw neighborhood became known as a new haven for post-hardcore punk, alternative rock, acid jazz and electronica, following the establishment of a variety of bars and clubs in the area, most notably The Black Cat (which was co-founded by Dave Grohl, another native of the DC punk scene). The 9:30 club subsequently moved to the area as well. ===Post-hardcore=== In the 1990s, bands taking heavy influence from the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene and the local go-go phenomenon contributed to the post-hardcore scene. Important players in this scene were The Dismemberment Plan, Fugazi, Nation of Ulysses, Trans Am, and Q and Not U. Currently, important post-punk/indie/dance-rock bands like Supersystem (formerly El Guapo), Medications, Metrorail, Maritime, Edie Sedgwick, Mass Movement of the Moth, The Fordists, and Beauty Pill hail from DC. Ian MacKaye continues his involvement in the DC music scene with his two-piece rock group The Evens. Record labels like Dischord, DeSoto Records, Exotic Fever, and Amor Y Lucha have been and remain to be a crucial means of distribution for DC bands. ===Hip hop=== The DC hip-hop scene has always taken a back seat to the other more prevalent genres in the area. Even so, influential groups have planted seeds in the District for future generations to follow. Groups like The Amphibians & Freestyle Union laid the foundation for artists like Asheru, Wale and Low Budget to help put DC's hip-hop scene on the map. Wale was the first District of Columbia artist to really break out on the national scene. He was a member of XXL's 2009 Freshman Class and released his debut album, Attention Deficit on Interscope Records. Representing the street-oriented side of hip-hop,District of Columbia-bred rapper Garvey \\"The Chosen One\\" released his debut album Hard Hat Area Volume#1, on independent record label Triple Team Entertainment and distributed by DTLR. When it came time to the video's shoot location for his single \\"Lock It Down,\\" released 2010, he chose local high school Calvin Coolidge High School, alma mater of the video's director, Robert \\"Bob Smoke\\" Headen, did more than just provide the setting‚Äîmembers of the school's band, cheerleading team, step team and dance squad are all featured in the released video as noted by the Washington Post. Recently, DMV emcee Marky has been gaining national recognition for his song \\"Rasta Monsta,\\" sampling Aloe Blacc's \\"I Need A Dollar.\\".

The District of Columbia's hip-hop scene was notably featured in the 1998 film Slam, about a would-be slam poet's ordeal in the District of Columbia Jail. Pharaoh Jonez, an Emcee from Southeast DC is one of the most successful rapper/producers from the DMV's underground scene. In 2010 he managed to get his music into the hands of an A&R; over at Slip-n-Slide Records which did nothing for his career until 2012 when he landed a spread in Kapital Magazine alongside Kendrick Lamar, Drumma Boy, and fellow DC rapper Wale, who of which Jonez has never met before. In 2013 Pharaoh Jonez signed a management contract with Lawrence Mooney, CEO of Chocolate Mint and longtime friend of \\"Freeway\\" Rick Ross. ===Electronic Dance Music + House=== The District of Columbia, has been home to a booming House music scene. Driven by internationally recognized acts and underground talents at venues like Echo Stage, Flash, U Street Music Hall and Eighteenth Street Lounge. House music parties regularly take place at clubs and warehouses across the District. Past venues include Nation (nightclub) (formerly the Capital Ballroom), Red (nightclub), Club Five and even the DC Armory. Another electronic-dance music subgenre that was born in the District of Columbia is Moombahton. The style of music was created by local D.J. Dave Nada, who accidentally created a new and unique EDM sound at a party in Fall 2009, by slowing down the tempo of an Electro House song and placing a reggaeton beat on top of the house track. Little did he know that his invention would spark a whole underground EDM movement not only in the District of Columbia but also worldwide, all through the early 2010s. Well known Moombahton producers include Munchi, Dillon Francis, and Bro Safari. The District of Columbia is also the home to the group Thievery Corporation, who are well known in the electronic music community for their fusion of downtempo and trip hop with lounge music and Brazilian music such as bossa nova.

Eschewing the more esoteric stylings of their art-school peers, bands like Soul Lip, the Hall Monitors, the breakUps, the Have Mercys, the Points, Shark Week, The Fed, and Fellowcraft mine a more primitive vein of rock 'n' roll, finding inspiration in fuzzed-out chords and grooves. ==The Wammies== The Washington Area Music Awards, also known as the Wammies, was founded in 1985 by Michael Jaworek and Mike Schreibman and has been committed to raising the profile of the Washington area's diverse music community.

They have stated this about the current name and spelling: \\"We changed a letter so that we wouldn't find a band with the same name again like it was the case with Darkness\\". Nokturnal Mortum gained recognition in the underground Black Metal genre with the release of their debut album Goat Horns, which had two keyboardists play on the album (often on the same song) and for mixing traditional Ukrainian folk influences with BM. They focused heavily on atmospheric BM with themes common in classic nature- romanticism, often inspired by regional or local ancient folklore, mythology or journeys set in pagan landscapes. Early album art usually always depicted vast forests, swamps, sunsets, desolate mountains in wintery nights, and so on. The band's first albums were released through The End Records and (as licence pressings) by Nuclear Blast,Aaron McKay: The Genesis of the End. CoC interviews Andreas Katsambas of The End Records. Chronicleofchaos.com but the label and the band separated at the time of the album releases of NeChrist and Lunar Poetry, both releases suddenly containing political support to neo-Nazi and White supremacist causes. The band began to change from being in the more popular extreme metal scenes to becoming one of the leading groups in the National Socialist black metal scene in Eastern Europe. Varggoth himself said about the conflict with the label: \\"We had a contract with The End Records but it was broken. We have different points of view. They didn't like our policy, we didn't like the way they do business. They owe us some money. That was enough for a conflict.\\" Underground artist Igor Naumchuk (Lucifugum) had close ties with Nokturnal Mortum‚Äîwho dedicated the album To the Gates of Blasphemous Fire to him‚Äîuntil all relations ceased due to ideological disagreements. Despite this, both bands are still likened to one another. In autumn of 2014, band frontman Knjaz Varggoth published a statement declaring that he and Nokturnal Mortum had begun to distance themselves from politics in order to avoid rumors concerning his personal views and band ideology; however, the band played live at the far right festival Asgardsrei in December 2016, and have played at several other right wing festivals since. ==Controversies and Nazi ideology== Initially, the band described their music as \\"lunar black metal\\". On the demo Lunar Poetry‚Äîlater released as an album‚Äîthe band advocated for the killing of Christians, the destruction of churches, and Slavic paganism, along with describing Jesus as a \\"crucified hippie\\". Later, when releasing their EP Marble Moon and also the Nechrist and Lunar Poetry albums, they included anti-Semitic lyrics with neo-Nazi and White supremacy messages and imagery.The Music Sound. Author: Nicolae SfetcuReichsrock: The International Web of White-Power and Neo-Nazi Hate Music. Author: Kirsten DyckNokturnal Mortum, album: NeChrist. 2000 As the more popular non-political black metal scene (including many shops and concert events) began distancing themselves from their ideology, the band instead became prominent in the early Eastern European NSBM scene, and is today often considered as one of the groups that shaped the Slavic subcultural NSBM movement. They also began using swastikas in their logo, on albums, during shows, and praising the Third Reich and the Holocaust openly in various side-projects.Aryan Terrorism, album: WAR Knjaz Varggoth, in one of several side projects, also voiced support for the so-called \\"racial holy war\\" idea.Album cover: Mistigo Varggoth Darkestra Nokturnal Mortum's NeChrist featured the song \\"The Call of Aryan Spirit\\", which included anti-semitic lyrics and glorified pogroms. The album included a swastika design consisting of four AK-47's. In interviews, appearances, merchandise and on their website, the band showcased neo-Nazi opinions but their music style itself was described as \\"pagan black metal\\". Statements and texts show neo-neo-v√∂lkisch as well as neo-paganist ideas, and a tendency to ariosophy. In 2008, the band's vocalist and guitarist, Knjaz Varggoth, claimed that he had no interest in political tendencies and that he had, \\"never viewed Nokturnal Mortum as a political band\\"‚Äîdespite the group at the time continued to support the right-wing Azov Battalion.Asgardsrei festival 5, line-up In 2014 the group again stated that the band had severed ties with NSBM ideologies and political themes, but at the same time and in the following years, they remained active in white supremacist circles and has played live at neo-Nazi and far right shows, in collaboration with the NSBM label \\"Militant Zone\\". In July, 2018 the band resumed releasing leftover anti- Semitic merchandise, however an enclosed message accompanied every order that the intent of selling these products was for their fans to burn and destroy the items. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * 1997 ‚Äì Goat Horns * 1998 ‚Äì To the Gates of Blasphemous Fire * 1999 ‚Äì –ù–µ—Ö—Ä–∏—Å—Ç—å (NeChrist) * 2004 ‚Äì –ú–∏—Ä–æ–≤–æ–∑–∑—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ (Myrovozzrieniye, Worldview) * 2005 ‚Äì Weltanschauung (Worldview) * 2009 ‚Äì –ì–æ–ª–æ—Å —Å—Ç–∞–ª—ñ (Holos stali, The Voice of Steel) * 2017 ‚Äì –Ü—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞ (Istyna, Verity) ===Live albums=== * 2009 ‚Äì Live in Katowice * 2011 ‚Äì –ö–æ–ª–æ–≤–æ—Ä–æ—Ç ===EPs=== * 1997 ‚Äì Return of the Vampire Lord * 1997 ‚Äì Marble Moon * 2003 ‚Äì The Taste of Victory * 2017 ‚Äì Orathania / Kolyada ===Demos=== * 1995 ‚Äì Twilightfall * 1995 ‚Äì Black Clouds Over Slavonic Lands * 1996 ‚Äì Lunar Poetry ===Splits=== * 1996 ‚Äì Veche (split Lucifugum) * 1997 ‚Äì Path of the Wolf / Return of the Vampire Lord (split Lucifugum) * 2007 ‚Äì Eastern Hammer (split Graveland, North, –¢–µ–º–Ω–æ–∑–æ—Ä—å) * 2016 ‚Äì The Spirit Never Dies (split Graveland) ===Compilations=== * 2001 ‚Äì Return of the Vampire Lord / Marble Moon * 2004 ‚Äì Eleven Years Among the Sheep * 2016 ‚Äì 22 Years Among the Sheep ==References== Category:Ukrainian black metal musical groups Category:Symphonic black metal musical groups Category:National Socialist black metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:Musical quintets Category:Nuclear Blast artists ","title":"Nokturnal Mortum"},{"id":"305555","text":"Yungaburra is a rural town and locality in the Tablelands Region, Queensland, Australia. In the , Yungaburra had a population of 1,239 people. ==Geography== Yungaburra is on the Atherton Tableland in Far North Queensland. The landscape around Yungaburra has been shaped by millennia of volcanic activity. The most recent eruptions were approximately 10,000 years ago. Notable geological features nearby include: *Seven Sisters and Mount Quincan are volcanic cones. *Lake Eacham (Yidyam) and Lake Barrine are lakes inside volcanic craters. *Mount Hypipamee Crater is a diatreme (crater). *Tinaroo Dam submerged the old town of Kulara is visible, on whose cricket-pitch, when drought conditions drastically lower the water-level, locals play cricket matches. ==History== Prior to European settlement the area around Yungaburra was inhabited by about sixteen different indigenous groups, among them the Ngatjan, with the custodians being Yidinji people and neighbouring Ngajanji people. The Queensland police and native troops carried out extensive massacres in the area to rid it of blacks. In one incident in 1884, at Skull Pocket just north of the town, a group of Yidinji were surrounded at night, and at dawn mowed down after they fled on hearing the first shot. The children were brained or stabbed to death by native troopers. In the early 1880s the area around Allumbah Pocket was used as an overnight stop for miners travelling west from the coast. In 1886 the land was surveyed, and in 1891 settlers moved in. Allumbah State School opened on 7 June 1909. In 1911 it was renamed Yungaburra State School. In 1910 the railway arrived and the railway station was named Yungaburra by the Queensland Railways Department. The town was then renamed Yungaburra, to avoid confusion with another town called Allumbah. The name Yungaburra comes from the local Yidiny word janggaburru, denoting the Queensland silver ash (Flindersia bourjotiana). By 1911 indigenous numbers had fallen to 20% of the pre-settlement population due to disease, conflict with settlers and loss of habitat. In January 1911, Kulara residents began lobbying for a school, claiming there were 42 children in the district. Kulara State School opened on 17 June 1912. It closed on 1 September 1958. In 2006, the Atherton Tableland region was damaged by Cyclone Larry, rated as Category 4 cyclone on the Australian scale. Of the 19 heritage listed sites in Yungaburra, only the roofs of the community hall, police station and one of the bush cottages were badly damaged, as were the front of the Yungaburra Butchery and Gem Gallery sign. The town was restored very quickly; little evidence of the cyclone is visible. At the , Yungaburra had a population of 932. At the , Yungaburra had a population of 1,116 people. ==Heritage listings== Yungaburra has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 27 Atherton Road: Bank of New South Wales * 6-10 Cedar Street: Yungaburra Court House * 7-9 Cedar Street: 7-9 Cedar Street, Yungaburra * 12 Cedar Street: Residence * 15-17 Cedar Street: Yungaburra Post Office * 16-20 Cedar Street: Williams' House * 19 Cedar Street: Yungaburra Community Centre * 32 Cedar: Billy Madrid's House * 34 Cedar Street: Barber's Shop, Yungaburra * Curtain Fig Tree Road: Curtain Fig Tree * 7 Eacham Road: St Marks Anglican Church * 25-33 Eacham Road: Cairns Plywood Pty Ltd Sawmill Complex * 20 Gillies Highway: Eden House Restaurant * 2 Kehoe Place: Butchers Shop * 6-8 Kehoe Place: Lake Eacham Hotel * 7 Mulgrave Road: Allumbah * 4 Oak Street: Residence * 1 Penda Street: St Patricks Catholic Church *on the shores of Lake Tinaroo, the Afghanistan Avenue of Honour File:CurtainFig.jpgCurtain Fig Tree File:StateLibQld 1 117728 Williams' Lake Eacham Hotel, 1912.jpgLake Eacham Hotel == Amenities == Yungaburra's economy today revolves around tourism, and the town contains a primary school, post office, library/telecentre and a range of businesses and services for the use of residents and visitors. Other facilities include a tennis court and a bowling club. The town has 18 Heritage Listed buildings, and is the largest National Trust village in Queensland. The Yungaburra Markets, held on the fourth Saturday of each month, are one of the largest in Far North Queensland, and each year around the end of October, Yungaburra holds the two-day Yungaburra Folk Festival, featuring concerts from Australian (and sometimes international) folk musicians. Yungaburra is also the site of the war memorial to soldiers lost, opened 22 June 2013. There is a network of walking tracks around the town including Peterson's Creek. Yungaburra has a library at Maud Kehoe Park operated by the Tablelands Regional Council. The Yungaburra branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association meets at the QCWA Hall on the corner of Cedar Street and the Gillies Highway. == Education == Yungaburra State School is a government primary (Prep-6) school for boys and girls at 4 Maple Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 213 students with 18 teachers (12 full-time equivalent) and 14 non-teaching staff (9 full-time equivalent). The nearest public secondary school is Atherton State High School. ==Tourism== Allumbah Pocket is a picnic area on Peterson's Creek which runs past Yungaburra. It is the centre for a series of walking tracks along the creek. Tracks lead to Frawley's Pool, a popular swimming hole and picnic area, then further to Yungaburra's historical train bridge. In the opposite direction there is a track to the platypus viewing deck. Aside from this all of the tracks are relatively easy and short enough for anyone to do. The site is dedicated to Geoff Tracy, a local renowned environmentalist who died in 2004. Yungaburra has access to the southern arm of Lake Tinaroo which is popular for fishing, canoeing, sailing, swimming, water-skiing and camping. The other main places to get to Tinaroo are Kairi and the township of Tinaroo. The Curtain Fig Tree, which is just out of Yungaburra, is a giant rainforest fig tree with roots hanging down, giving it the appearance of curtains. There is a short boardwalk around the tree. Lake Barrine and Lake Eacham are crater lakes, formed from volcanoes. Lake Eacham is popular for swimming and Lake Barrine has a teahouse and gift shop as well as cruises around the lake however is unsuitable for swimming due to the cruise boats. Both lakes have walking tracks around them.

In 2015, at age 88, Watson was awarded the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation for his long and prolific translation career. ==Life and career== Burton Watson was born on June 13, 1925, in New Rochelle, New York, where his father was a hotel manager. In 1943, at age 17, Watson dropped out of high school to join the U.S. Navy, and was stationed on repair vessels in the South Pacific during the final years of the Pacific Theatre of World War II. His ship was in the Marshall Islands when the war ended in August 1945, and on September 20, 1945 it sailed to Japan to anchor at the Yokosuka Naval Base, where Watson had his first direct experiences with Japan and East Asia. As he recounts in Rainbow World, on his first shore leave, he and his shipmates encountered a stone in Tokyo with musical notation on it; they sang the melody, as best they could. Some months later, Watson realized that he had been in Hibiya Park and that the song was \\"Kimigayo\\". Watson left Japan in February 1946, was discharged from the Navy, and was accepted into Columbia University on the G.I. Bill, where he majored in Chinese. His main Chinese teachers were the American Sinologist L. Carrington Goodrich and the Chinese scholar Wang Chi-chen. At that time, most of the Chinese curriculum focused on learning to read Chinese characters and Chinese literature, as it was assumed that any \\"serious students\\" could later learn to actually speak Chinese by going to China.Balcom (2005). He also took one year of Japanese. Watson spent five years studying at Columbia, earning a B.A. in 1949 and an M.A. in 1951. After receiving his master's degree, Watson hoped to move to China for further study, but the Communist Party of Chinawho had taken control of China in 1949 with their victory in the Chinese Civil Warhad closed the country to Americans. He was unable to find any positions in Taiwan or Hong Kong, and so moved to Japan using the last of his GI savings. Once there, he secured two positions in Kyoto: as an English teacher at Doshisha University, and as graduate student and a research assistant to Professor Yoshikawa K≈çjir≈ç of the Chinese Language and Literature at Kyoto University. His combined salary, including tutoring English several evenings per week, was about $50 per month, and so he lived much like other Japanese graduate students. In 1952, he was able to resign his position at Doshisha, thanks to Columbia University stipend for Sources in Chinese Tradition, and later in the year, a position as a Ford Foundation Overseas Fellow. Although he had long been interested in translating poetry, his first significant translations were of kanshi (poems in Chinese written by Japanese), made in 1954 for Donald Keene, who was compiling an anthology of Japanese literature. A few years later, he sent some translations of early Chinese poems from the Yutai Xinyong to Ezra Pound for comment; Pound replied but did not critique the translations. In subsequent years, Watson became friends with Gary Snyder, who lived in Kyoto in the 1950s, and through him Cid Corman and Allen Ginsberg. In 1956 he earned a Ph.D. from Columbia with a doctoral dissertation on 1st century BC historian Sima Qian entitled \\"Ssu-ma Ch'ien: The Historian and His Work\\". He then worked as a member of Ruth Fuller Sasaki's team translating Buddhist texts into English, under the auspices of the Columbia University Committee on Oriental Studies., returning to Columbia in August 1961. He subsequently taught at Columbia and Stanford as a professor of Chinese. He and colleague Professor Donald Keene frequently participated in the seminars of William Theodore de Bary given to students at Columbia University. Watson moved to Japan in 1973, where he remained for the rest of his life, and devoted much of his time to translation, both of literary works, and of more routine texts such as advertisements, instruction manuals, and so forth. He never married, but was in a long-term relationship with his partner Norio Hayashi. He stated, in an interview with John Balcom, that his translations of Chinese poetry were greatly influenced by the translations of Pound and Arthur Waley, particularly Waley. While in Japan, he took up Zen meditation and k≈çan study. Although he worked as a translator for the Soka Gakkai, a Japanese Buddhist organization, he was not a follower of the Nichiren school of Buddhism or a member of the Soka Gakkai. Despite his extensive activity in translating ancient Chinese texts, his first time in China was a three-week trip in the summer of 1983, with expenses paid by the Soka Gakkai. Watson died on April 1, 2017, aged 91, at the Hatsutomi Hospital in Kamagaya, Japan. ==Translations== Translations from Chinese include: * The Lotus Sutra and Its Opening and Closing Sutras, Soka Gakkai, 2009 * Late Poems of Lu You, Ahadada Books, 2007 * Analects of Confucius, 2007 * The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, 2004 * The Selected Poems of Du Fu, 2002 * Vimalakirti Sutra, New York: Columbia University Press 1996Ziporyn, Brook (1998).

There has been much confusion over whether McKay was born in 1889 or 1890. His birth certificate lists 1889.

He wrote five novels: Home to Harlem (1928), a best-seller that won the Harmon Gold Award for Literature, Banjo (1929), Banana Bottom (1933), Romance in Marseille (published in 2020), and in 1941 a manuscript called Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem which remained unpublished until 2017.Felicia R. Lee, \\"New Novel of Harlem Renaissance Is Found\\", The New York Times, September 14, 2012. McKay also authored collections of poetry, a collection of short stories, Gingertown (1932), two autobiographical books, A Long Way from Home (1937) and My Green Hills of Jamaica (published posthumously in 1979), and a non-fiction, socio-historical treatise entitled Harlem: Negro Metropolis (1940). His 1922 poetry collection, Harlem Shadows, was among the first books published during the Harlem Renaissance. His Selected Poems was published posthumously, in 1953. McKay was attracted to communism in his early life, but he always asserted that he never became an official member of the Communist Party USA. However, some scholars dispute that claim, noting his close ties to active members, his attendance at communist-led events, and his months-long stay in the Soviet Union in 1922-23, which he wrote about very favorably.Tyrone Tillery, Claude McKay: A Black Poet's Struggle for Identity. University of Massachusetts Press, 1992, pp. 64‚Äì65, 68‚Äì70. He gradually became disillusioned with communism, however, and by the mid-1930s had begun to write negatively about it.Wayne F.

Last updated September 11, 2018. Retrieved October 9, 2018. ==Early life in Jamaica == Festus Claudius McKay, known as Claude McKay, was born September 15, 1889 or 1890 in Nairne Castle near James Hill in upper Clarendon Parish, Jamaica. He referred to his home village as Sunny Ville, a name given to the area by locals. He was the youngest child of Thomas Francis McKay and Hannah Ann Elizabeth Edwards, well-to-do farmers who had enough property to qualify to vote. He had seven siblings. McKay's parents were active and well-respected members of the Baptist faith. Thomas was a strict, religious man who struggled to develop close relationships with his children due to his serious nature. In contrast, Hannah had a warmth that allowed her to give love freely to all of her children. Thomas was of Ashanti descent, while Hannah traced her ancestry to Madagascar. Claude recounted that his father would often share stories of Ashanti customs with the family.Tillery, Tyrone. Claude Mckay : A Black Poet's Struggle for Identity. University of Massachusetts Press, 1992. At the age of four, McKay went to school at Mt. Zion Church. Around the age of nine, he was sent to live with his oldest brother, Uriah Theodore, also known as U'Theo, a teacher, to be given a proper education. His brother also enjoyed being a journalist, even though he did not professionally do this for a living. Due to his brother's influence, McKay became an avid reader of classical and British literature, as well as philosophy, science and theology. With the time he had on his hands, he would read poems during that time and other material; a lot of material he read was William Shakespeare's work. When McKay was in elementary school, he became very intrigued and passionate about poetry, which he started to write at the age of 10. As a teenager in 1906, he became apprenticed to a carriage and cabinet maker known as Old Brenga, maintaining his apprenticeship for about two years. During that time, in 1907, McKay met a man named Walter Jekyll, who became a mentor and an inspiration for him, who also encouraged him to concentrate on his writing. Jekyll convinced McKay to write in his native dialect, and then set some of McKay's verses to music. Jekyll helped McKay publish his first book of poems, Songs of Jamaica, in 1912. These were the first poems published in Jamaican Patois (dialect of mainly English words and African structure). McKay's next volume, Constab Ballads (1912), was based on his experiences of joining the constabulary for a brief period in 1911.Freda Scott Giles, \\"Claude McKay's Life\\", Modern American Poetry. McKay's poem \\"The Tropics in New York\\" highlights his memory of the Caribbean. The poem takes place in New York, where he worked as a labor worker. The fruits in New York causes the speaker of the poem to feel nostalgic. The poem describes the many Caribbean fruits integrated into the New York \\"cityscape,\\" such as,\\"alligator pears, mangoes, and tangerines\\". The color of the fruits remind him of the colors and the diversity in Jamaica. He incorporates figurative language in order to; explain his longing for old ways. For example, the speaker describes how he is \\"hungry for old familiar ways/ a wave of longing through my body wept\\". He reminiscences on his life back home in Jamaica, which explains why he identifies with the many fruits sold on the New York city streets. ==First stay in the U. S. A.== McKay left for the U.S. in 1912 to attend Tuskegee Institute. He was shocked by the intense racism he encountered when he arrived in Charleston, South Carolina, where many public facilities were segregated; this inspired him to write more poetry. At Tuskegee, he disliked the \\"semi-military, machine-like existence there\\" and quickly left to study at Kansas State University. At Kansas State, he read W. E. B. Du Bois' Souls of Black Folk, which had a major impact on him and stirred his political involvement. But despite superior academic performance, in 1914 he decided he did not want to be an agronomist and moved to New York City, where he married his childhood sweetheart Eulalie Lewars. McKay published two poems in 1917 in The Seven Arts under the pseudonym Eli Edwards while working as a waiter on the railways. In 1919, he met Crystal and Max Eastman, who produced The Liberator (where McKay would serve as co- executive editor until 1922).The Chicago Defender (National edition) (1921‚Äì1967); April 2, 1921; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: Chicago Defender (1910-1975), p. 1. It was here, as the co-editor of The Liberator, that he published one of his most famous poems, \\"If We Must Die\\", during the \\"Red Summer\\", a period of intense racial violence against black people in Anglo- American societies. The poem was reportedly later quoted by Winston Churchill during World War II.According to David Freeman (\\"Churchill quoted radical poet Claude McKay\\"; originally published in Finest Hour 125, Winter 2004-025) , while Churchill may have been familiar with McKay's words there is no documented evidence of him citing the poem in any speech. The Churchill Centre and Museum at the Churchill War Rooms, London. In this period McKay joined the Industrial Workers of the World. He also became involved with a group of black radicals who were unhappy both with Marcus Garvey's nationalism and the middle-class reformist NAACP. These included other Caribbean writers such as Cyril Briggs, Richard B. Moore, and Wilfred Domingo. They fought for black self-determination within the context of socialist revolution. Together they founded the semi-secret revolutionary organization, the African Blood Brotherhood. Hubert Harrison had asked McKay to write for Garvey's Negro World, but only a few copies of the paper have survived from this period, none of which contain any articles by McKay. McKay soon left for London, England, writing later that it was to take advantage of an all-expense paid trip, but growing pressure from the Justice Department might also have played a part in his sudden decision to leave the country. ==Sojourn in the United Kingdom== In 1919, McKay arrived in London, where he would frequent two clubs, a soldiers' club in Drury Lane, and the International Socialist Club in Shoreditch. A militant atheist, he also joined the Rationalist Press Association. It was during this period that his commitment to socialism deepened and he read Marx assiduously. At the International Socialist Club, McKay met Shapurji Saklatvala, A. J. Cook, Guy Aldred, Jack Tanner, Arthur McManus, William Gallacher, Sylvia Pankhurst and George Lansbury. McKay was soon invited to write for Workers' Dreadnought. In April 1920, the Daily Herald, a socialist paper published by George Lansbury, included a racist article written by E. D. Morel. Entitled \\"Black Scourge in Europe: Sexual Horror Let Loose by France on the Rhine\\", it insinuated gross hypersexuality on black people in general. Lansbury refused to print McKay's response. This response then appeared in Workers' Dreadnought. In response to the \\"Black Horror on the Rhine\\" stories that the Daily Herald was running, McKay wrote: > Why this obscene maniacal outburst about the sex vitality of black men in a > proletarian paper?\\" Rape is rape; the colour of the skin doesn't make it > different. Negroes are no more over-sexed than Caucasians; mulatto children > in the West Indies and America were not the result of parthenogenesis.

Morel and the 'Black Horror on the Rhine'\\", International > Review of Social History, Volume 13, 1968 (pp. 1‚Äì28), p. 17. Since January 1920, McKay had been involved with the Workers' Dreadnought and the Workers' Socialist Federation, a Council Communist group active in the East End and which had a majority of women involved in it at all levels of the organization. He became a paid journalist for the paper; some people claim he was the first black journalist in Britain. He attended the Communist Unity Conference that established the Communist Party of Great Britain. At this time he also had some of his poetry published in the Cambridge Magazine, edited by C. K. Ogden. When Sylvia Pankhurst was arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act for publishing articles \\"calculated and likely to cause sedition among His Majesty's forces, in the Navy, and among the civilian population,\\" McKay had his rooms searched. He is likely to have been the author of \\"The Yellow Peril and the Dockers\\" attributed to \\"Leon Lopez\\", which was one of the articles cited by the government in its case against Workers' Dreadnought. ==Trip to Russia== McKay with Grigory Zinoviev and Nikolai Bukharin in 1923 When Russia was under the rule of Communist Party led by Lenin he was invited to Russia during the reconstruction of the country. In November 1922, in what he referred to as his \\"Magic Pilgrimage,\\" he traveled to Russia with Max Eastman to take part in the Fourth Congress of the Communist International in Petrograd and Moscow. McKay financed his trip to Russia by repackaging and selling Harlem Shadows, \\"complete with a signed photograph and an inflated price tag\\" to members of an NAACP donor list. He was greeted in Russia with an \\"ecstatic welcome\\" and \\"rock-star treatment.\\" A couple years later, McKay visited Russia again and when he arrived there was greeted with enthusiasm and friendliness. He was so well known in Russia that the brother of Nicholas the Second let him stay at his palace. People from all walks of life in Russia knew or heard of him and all had a desire or interest to learn what life was like for a Negro person in the United States. For example, soldiers in the Soviet army wanted to know what life was like for a Negro soldier in the United States military system and the Russian women were also interested of how well a Negro woman and white woman worked together. However, McKay also noticed life in Russia was very similar to the life of a Negro man in the United States. He noticed that people who were of a certain faith or religion were not given the same rights or opportunities as other people were able to receive. For example, people who practiced Judaism, were not allowed to apply for higher positions or jobs in the Soviet army. McKay also noticed that Russians had little understanding of why Negroes were treated so horribly in the United States and tried to enlighten them. ==Visit to Morocco== McKay wrote about his travels in Morocco in his 1937 autobiography A Long Way from Home. Before this journey he went to Paris, where he contracted a severe respiratory infection and required hospitalization. After recovering he continued traveling, and for 11 years ventured around Europe and parts of Northern Africa. During this stint he published three novels, and the most notable title from this period was Home to Harlem. This novel was published in 1928 where it was viewed various different ways. In The Negro Novel in America Robert Bone thought that it represented \\"different ways of rebelling against Western civilization\\", adding that McKay was not entirely successful in articulating his protagonists. However, other people thought that the novel provided a detailed portrayal of the underside of black urban life with its prostitutes and gamblers. Banana Bottom was another work he created during this 11-year span. Here McKay presented a clear depiction of his principal theme, that black individuals quest for cultural identity in a white society. Critics of the book all agreed that Banana Bottom is McKay's most skillful delineation of black individuals' predicament in white society. His final year abroad brought the creation of Gingertown, a collection of 12 short stories. Half of these tales depict his life in Harlem and the others revolve around his time in Jamaica. == Literary movements and traditions == Portrait of McKay in 1920 === Participation in Harlem Renaissance === McKay flourished as a poet during the Harlem Renaissance, a major literary movement in the 1920s. During this time, his poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations of life as a black man in both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism and felt that racist people were stupid and could not look past their shortsightedness and hatred. In tales such as Home to Harlem (1928), he depicts a culture in Harlem that is full of drug use, prostitution, and a variety of sexual encounters. His depiction was criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as W. E. B. DuBois, but was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance. McKay's poetry brought awareness to the racist treatment that many black individuals faced. One of his works that challenges racial discrimination in the Harlem Renaissance is his poem If We Must Die (1919). It looks to defend black rights and threatens for prejudice and abuse. He wanted his people to fight with determination and courage to those who would murder them. It calls to any race or anyone being discriminated against to fight for their freedom and what is right. What influenced him to write this poem was the clash between white and African Americans. McKay was afraid of the dangers that were happening all over the United States. The hangings, the shootings, the murders. Working as a porter on the railways, he would go from town to town not knowing what to expect. Some nights he would stay indoors because of the fear of danger going on outside. The creation of this poem had pushed him to become one of the most influential spokesman that promoted radicalism in America. McKay divested himself from many aspects and growing prescriptions of modernism. By the beginning of the 20th century, the sonnet form had become an antiquated poetic style, but McKay found it an ideal a medium to convey his ideas. Many modernists, however, rejected and criticized his use of the sonnet. Despite their reaction, he persevered and created a significant number of modern sonnets. Having spent time among the artists of Paris in the 1920s, he was intimately acquainted with the dynamics between painters and models and the manner in which modernist painters presented African subjects and African culture. In her article \\"Caribbean Models for Modernism in the Work of Claude McKay and Jean Rhys\\" Leah Rosenberg writes: \\"The fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and avant-garde primitivism\\". The inclination to stereotype and caricature the African physical form created, however inadvertently, a form of hegemony reminiscent to McKay of the colonialism he grew up with in Jamaica. \\"Sexuality and black culture,\\" Rosenberg explains, \\"held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from Picasso to Gertrude Stein\\". In need of money, McKay posed nude for the Cubist painter Andr√© Lhote. Through his experience, McKay saw first-hand how the larger social hegemony between European white supremacy and people of Afro-Caribbean descent could play itself out between the artist and its subject. McKay critically recalled the experience in various ways in many of his most notable works. In doing so, he shone a critical light on a cornerstone of modernism and once again pushed back against a system in which he found himself. == Political views and social activism == McKay joined the Industrial Workers of the World in autumn 1919, while working in a factory following his time as a dining-car waiter on the railways. According to his autobiographies A Long Way From Home and My Green Hills of Jamaica, he claimed he was drawn to the Communist party because it offered independence. McKay believed that the Communists in the US had other things on their agenda, and the African Americans were not part of that at all. Furthermore, he thought that they were using the Negro race to fight their battles. Because of his views on communism in America, he sought out help from Russia. McKay had seen and heard of the Russians' acceptance toward other communists and individuals, for their goal was to unite non-Europeans and normalize homosexual relationships, and felt a kinship to the movement. He addressed the Communists in Russia with his speech \\"Report on the Negro Question\\" and argued that America was not fully accepting of the Negro Communists. After his speech, he was asked by the Communist Party in Russia to explore this idea more in the form of a book. He wrote Negry v Amerike in 1923. He wrote this in Russian, and it was not translated into English until 1979. Later in life, he came to the conclusion that the Communist Party suppressed the idea of individuality and independent thought. Before coming back to America, he denounced the Communist thoughts, as documented in his autobiography A Long Way From Home. and looked for other areas to meet his needs. Past McKay's Communist ideologies, he engaged in activism through his literature that reached many countries and territories globally, with the city of Harlem, within the US, being especially effected by it. As a specific example, McKay urged the acceptance of strong African-American individuals as well as romantic relationships between homosexual couples within his novel Home to Harlem, which is the first in a series that follows the lives and experiences of black men with stable incomes and the courage to stand up for themselves and their beliefs. Through the eyes of one of the main characters those who read Home to Harlem can feel how much animosity McKay feels toward Harlem as the epicenter for African Americans. It is obvious that McKay sees Harlem as too complacent and submissive to the hetero-normative lifestyle and he wished for it to be a place all African American people, no matter the orientation, could live comfortably and happily. When broken down though, McKay worked toward equality and the welcoming of diversity within a population. With the concept of the new negro taking hold within America and beyond in the twenties, McKay wrote poems and prose to strengthen the movement and urge others to regard their race and sexuality as valid. == Sexuality == It is widely assumed that McKay was bisexual, as he pursued relationships with both men and women throughout his life. He particularly enjoyed the simultaneous secrecy of New York City; he never officially \\"came out\\" nor explicitly stated his sexual preference, but he was able to enter the \\"clandestine\\" homosexual communities of New York and find acceptance within them. Despite never having confirmed his sexuality, homosexual sentiments are clear in several of his poems. In others, the gender of the speaker is not identified, which leaves to interpretation the nature of the relationships presented in said works. Some key evidence that could support the idea of Mckay being bisexual could be his relationship with Walter Jekyll. Some say that it may have been a homosexual relationship between a younger man seduced by an older man. According to Josephine Herbst, she claims that he was bisexual. During his life, McKay was attracted to several men, including Max Eastman from The Liberator, Frank Harris, who was an editor for Pearson's Magazine, and Bishop Henry Sheil who worked for the Catholic Church. Walter Jekyll's influence on Mckay resulted in a combination of social implications. In the 1910s and 1920s he maintained an on-off relationship with the English labor advocate, poet, and translator Charles Ashleigh. ==Works== In 1928, McKay published his most famous novel, Home to Harlem, which won the Harmon Gold Award for Literature. The novel, which depicted street life in Harlem, would have a major impact on black intellectuals in the Caribbean, West Africa, and Europe. Home to Harlem gained a substantial readership, especially among people who wanted to know more about the intense, and sometimes shocking, details of Harlem nightlife. His novel was an attempt to capture the energetic and intense spirit of the \\"uprooted black vagabonds.\\" In Home to Harlem McKay looked among the common people for a distinctive black identity. Despite this, the book drew fire from one of McKay's contemporaries, W. E. B. Du Bois. To Du Bois, the novel's frank depictions of sexuality and the nightlife in Harlem only appealed to the \\"prurient demand[s]\\" of white readers and publishers looking for portrayals of black \\"licentiousness.\\" As Du Bois said, \\"Home to Harlem ... for the most part nauseates me, and after the dirtier parts of its filth I feel distinctly like taking a bath.\\" Modern critics now dismiss this criticism from Du Bois, who was more concerned with using art as propaganda in the struggle for African-American political liberation than in the value of art to showcase the truth about the lives of black people. McKay's other novels were Banjo (1929) and Banana Bottom (1933). Banjo was noted in part for its portrayal of how the French treated people from its sub-Saharan African colonies, as the novel centers on black seamen in Marseilles. Aim√© C√©saire stated that in Banjo, blacks were described truthfully and without \\"inhibition or prejudice\\". Banana Bottom, McKay's third novel, is said to follow a principal theme of a black individual in search of establishing a cultural identity in a white society. The book discusses underlying racial and cultural tensions. McKay also authored a collection of short stories, Gingertown (1932), two autobiographical books, A Long Way from Home (1937) and My Green Hills of Jamaica (published posthumously in 1979), and a non-fiction, socio-historical treatise entitled Harlem: Negro Metropolis (1940). His collection Selected Poems (1953) was published posthumously and included an introduction by John Dewey. McKay became an American citizen in 1940. In 1943, one year before his conversion into Catholicism, McKay started \\"Cycle Manuscript\\", a collection of 44 poems, mostly sonnets. In addition, he wrote a letter to Max Eastman, editor of the socialist journal The Liberator, Harlem Renaissance leader, and McKay's close friend, asking Eastman \\"to look through\\" all the poems and to make any needed \\"revisions\\". Despite Eastman's revisions, McKay's collection would never be published. The \\"Cycle Manuscript\\" remains to be a typescript at the Beinecke Library at Yale University, as the \\"Cycle Manuscript\\" is an important document that illustrates the reflections of an emotional poet who was seeking self-actualization at his point of his life. Becoming disillusioned with communism, McKay embraced the social teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, to which he converted in 1944.James, Winston (2001). A Fierce Hatred of Injustice: Claude McKay's Jamaica and His Poetry of Rebellion (London: Verso), p. 46.

Kindle Edition. == Religion == Toward the end of his life, McKay embraced Catholicism, retreating from Communism entirely. His sudden conversion to Catholicism puzzled many for over half a century. When he converted to Catholicism in his final years, he was perceived to be suffering from poverty, health problems, and political and social exclusion by his own beloved Harlem. Before his actual conversion, he wrote to long-time friend and mentor, Max Eastman, about \\"doing a lot of reading and research, especially on Catholic work among Negroes----Because if and when I take the step I want to be intellectually honest and sincere about it\\". (McKay to Eastman, June 1, 1944). Five months later, when McKay was baptized into the Holy Roman Catholic Church, he wrote to Eastman to assure him that \\"I am not less the fighter\\" for doing so (McKay to Eastman, October 16, 1944, Rpt. in Passion 305). ==Legacy== In 1977, the government of Jamaica named Claude McKay the national poet and posthumously awarded him the Order of Jamaica for his contribution to literature. In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Claude McKay on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.Asante, Molefi Kete (2002). 100 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia. Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books. . McKay is regarded as the \\"foremost left-wing black intellectual of his age\\" and his work heavily influenced a generation of black authors including James Baldwin and Richard Wright.\\"Mckay, Claude (1890-1948)\\", from St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture. 2005‚Äì2006 Thomson Gale.

The novel centers on the ideas and events that animated Harlem on the cusp of World War II (such as Benito Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia). Working in collaboration, Professor Cloutier (now at the University of Pennsylvania) and his advisor Professor Brent Hayes Edwards successfully authenticated the manuscript, and have received permission from the McKay estate to publish the novel, a satire set in 1936, with an introduction about how it was found and its provenance verified. ==References== ==Further reading== * Cooper, Wayne F.

Species in the genus Phelsuma are commonly referred to as day geckos. Some day geckos are seriously endangered and some are common, but all Phelsuma species are CITES Appendix II listed. Little is known about trade in day geckos, but the IUCN considers it a threat to some species. Some species are captive-bred.Breeding Endangered Geckos, editor's interview with Matt Schaefer, July 23, 2013 ==Description== In contrast to most other gecko species, day geckos of the genus Phelsuma are active mainly during the day. Other diurnal geckos include species of the genera Lygodactylus and Gonatodes. Like most other geckos, day geckos lack eyelids, instead having rounded pupils and a clear, fixed plate covering their eyes which they clean with their tongues. Many species have bright green, red, and blue colors which make them popular terrarium or vivarium pets. These brilliant colors play a role in intraspecies recognition and also serve as camouflage. The total length (including tail) of the different Phelsuma species varies between about , but the extinct Rodrigues giant day gecko was even larger. Day geckos have toe pads consisting of tiny lamellae which allow them to walk on plain vertical and inverted surfaces like bamboo or glass. The inner toe on each foot is vestigial. Males have well- developed femoral pores on the undersurface of their rear limbs. These pores are less developed or absent in females. Females often have well-developed endolymphatic chalk sacs on the sides of their necks. These sacs store calcium, which is needed for egg production. Those eggs can often be seen through the ventral surface of the female's body shortly before they are laid. The hatchlings reach sexual maturity between six and 12 months old. Smaller species may live up to 10 years, whereas the larger species have been reported to live more than 20 years in captivity. ==Distribution and habitat== Day geckos inhabit the islands of the south-west part of the Indian Ocean. The exceptions are Phelsuma andamanense, which is endemic to the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, and Phelsuma dubia, which is also found on the East Coast of mainland Africa, although it possibly was introduced there. Most Phelsumas species are found in Mauritius and Madagascar. Some species are found on neighbouring island groups, including the Mascarenes, Seychelles, and Comoros. Due to human introduction, they are also often found on some of the Hawaiian Islands, including the Big Island and Kauai, and the state of Florida, where they were introduced as a form of pest control. The different Phelsuma species can be found from sea level up to 2,300 meters. Most day geckos are arboreal. They inhabit, amongst others, coconut palms and banana trees, but can also be found near human settlements, in gardens, on fences, houses, and huts. An exception, Phelsuma barbouri, is a terrestrial species. ==Diet== Gold dust day gecko Day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates in the wild. They also eat nectar, pollen, and occasionally soft, ripe and sweet fruits such as bananas. In captivity, such a diet is simulated. Insects which may be used include: (wingless) fruit flies, various flies, wax moths, crickets, small super worms, small butter worms and mealworms. Fruit, which is required a few times a week, may be small pieces of papaya, banana, or other sweet fruit and also commercial gecko nectars. In 2008 a BBC film crew took footage of a day gecko successfully begging a planthopper for honeydew. ==Classification== The genus Phelsuma was first described in 1825 by the British zoologist John Edward Gray, who named it after the Dutch physician Murk van Phelsum.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Phelsuma, p. 206). The genus consists of about 70 known species and subspecies. Two Phelsuma species (Phelsuma gigas and Phelsuma edwardnewtoni) are now considered to be extinct, probably due to the destruction of their environments by human settlers and their domestic animals. Many day gecko species are endangered today because an increasing percentage of their natural habitat, especially tropical forest, is being destroyed by human activity.

His standard title was ≈örama·πáa Zhiyi (Ê≤ôÈñÄÊô∫È°ó), linking him to the broad tradition of Indian asceticism. Zhiyi is famous for being the first in the history of Chinese Buddhism to elaborate a complete, critical and systematic classification of the Buddhist teachings. He is also regarded as the first major figure to make a significant break from the Indian tradition, to form an indigenous Chinese system. ==Biography== Born with the surname Chen () in Huarong District, Jing Prefecture (now Hubei), Zhiyi left home to become a monk at eighteen, after the loss of his parents and his hometown Jiangling that fell to the Western Wei army when Zhiyi was seventeen. At 23, he received his most important influences from his first teacher, Nanyue Huisi (515-577 CE), a meditation master who would later be listed as Zhiyi's predecessor in the Tiantai lineage. After a period of study with Huisi (560-567), he spent some time working in the southern capital of Jiankang. Then in 575 he went to Tiantai mountain for intensive study and practice with a group of disciples. Here he worked on adapting the Indian meditation principles of ≈õamatha and vipa≈õyanƒÅ (translated as \\"zhi\\" and \\"guan\\") into a complex system of self-cultivation practice that also incorporated devotional rituals and confession/repentance rites. Then in 585 he returned to Jinling, where he completed his monumental commentarial works on the Lotus Sutra, the Fahua wenzhu (587 CE), and the Fahua xuanyi (593 CE). Chappell holds that Zhiyi: \\"...provided a religious framework which seemed suited to adapt to other cultures, to evolve new practices, and to universalize Buddhism.\\"Chappell, David W. (1987).

Of the works attributed to him (although many may have been written by his disciples), about thirty are extant. == View on ≈õamatha- vipa≈õyanƒÅ == Zhiyi's Hsiao chih-kuan () offers an exposition of the practice of ≈õamatha (calming or cessation) and vipa≈õyanƒÅ (wise seeing or contemplation). Zhiyi's Hsiao chih-kuan states:Swanson, Paul L.

Zhiyi also notes that its necessary to have a balance between ≈õamatha and vipa≈õyanƒÅ: > It should be known that these two aspects are like the two wheels of a cart, > or the two wings of a bird; if one side is cultivated disproportionately, > then one falls prey to mistaken excess. ==Four Samadhis== Zhiyi developed a curriculum of practice which was distilled into the 'Four Samadhis' (Chinese: ÂõõÁ®Æ‰∏âÊòß;Swanson, Paul L.

These were also known as goji hakky≈ç in Japanese and osi palgyo (Ïò§ÏãúÌåîÍµê) in Korean. According to Zhiyi, the five periods of the Buddha's teachings were as follows:The five periods were based on quotations from various sutras. cf # The Flower Garland period ‚Äì taught immediately after the Buddha attained Enlightenment, lasting 3 weeks. The teachings at this time were incomprehensible to all but advanced bodhisattvas, and thus Shakyamuni Buddha started over with more basic (the Agama) teachings. # The Agama Period ‚Äì taught at Deer Park, and lasting 12 years. These consisted of the most elementary teachings of the Buddha including karma, rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, etc. # The Correct and Equal Period ‚Äì lasting 8 years. This marks the Buddha's teachings that begin to transition from so-called \\"Hinayana\\" teachings to Mahayana ones. # The Wisdom Period ‚Äì lasting 22 years. The teachings here consist of the Perfection of Wisdom teachings among others. Here, the teachings were intended to demonstrate that the classifications of Hinayana and Mahayana were expedient only, and that were ultimately empty. # The Lotus and Nirvana Period ‚Äì lasting 8 years. The teachings of this final period mark the most \\"perfect\\" teachings, namely the Lotus Sutra and the Mahayana Nirvana Sutra, which encompass the Buddha's original intention. These were compared in order to the five stages of milk: fresh milk, cream, curds, butter and ghee (clarified butter). Further. the teachings of the Buddha were organized into four types based on the capacity of listener: * Sudden teachings * Gradual teachings * Indeterminate teachings * Secret or \\"esoteric\\" teachings. and four types of sources: * Hinayana * Mahayana * Teachings found in both * Teachings that transcend both (e.g. Lotus Sutra) Together these were the Eight Teachings of the Buddha attributed to Zhiyi. ==Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life== Zhiyi taught the principle of Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought Moment () in his 'Great Concentration and Insight', based on the Lotus Sutra. The number 'Three Thousand' is derived from the Ten Worlds, multiplied by ten [because of the Mutual Possession of the Ten Worlds], which gives 100, multiplied by ten [the Ten Factors listed in Ch. 2 of the Lotus Sutra which gives 1,000. 1,000 multiplied by 3 [the Three Realms of Existence: Self, Other, and Environment] which gives 3,000.Soka Gakkai Dictionary of Buddhism, Soka Gakkai, \\"Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life\\" Volume 5 of Great Concentration and Insight states: ==See also== *Guoqing Temple *Zhou Jichang ==Notes== ==Works== * Dharmamitra (trans.): The Essentials of Buddhist Meditation by Shramana Zhiyi, Kalavinka Press 2008, * Donner, Neal & Daniel B.

He has more recently been recognized for his writing on his website Fourmilab. == Early projects == In 1974/1975, Walker wrote the ANIMAL software, which self-replicated on UNIVAC 1100 machines. It is considered one of the first computer viruses. Walker also founded the hardware integration manufacturing company Marinchip. Among other things, Marinchip pioneered the translation of numerous computer language compilers to Intel platforms. == Autodesk == In 1982, John Walker and 12 other programmers pooled US$59,000 to start Autodesk (AutoCAD), and began working on several computer applications. The first completed was AutoCAD, a software application for computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting. AutoCAD had begun life as InteractCAD, written by programmer Michael Riddle in a proprietary language. Walker and Riddle rewrote the program, and established a profit- sharing agreement for any product derived from InteractCAD. Walker subsequently paid Riddle US$10 million for all the rights. By mid-1986, the company had grown to 255 employees with annual sales of over $40 million. That year, Walker resigned as chairman and president of the company, continuing to work as a programmer. In 1989, Walker's book, The Autodesk File, was published. It describes his experiences at Autodesk, based around internal documents (particularly email) of the company. Walker moved to Switzerland in 1991. By 1994, when he resigned from the company, it was the sixth-largest personal computer software company in the world, primarily from the sales of AutoCAD. Walker owned about $45 million of stock in Autodesk at the time. == Fourmilab == He publishes on his personal domain, fourmilab.ch, designed to be a play on Fermilab.https://www.fourmilab.ch/nav/topics/faq.html On his Web site, Walker publishes about his personal projects, including a hardware random number generator called HotBits, along with software that he writes and freely distributes, such as his Earth and Moon viewer. Another notable article was called The Hacker's Diet. One particularly noteworthy article was titled The Digital Imprimatur: How big brother and big media can put the Internet genie back in the bottle, an article about Internet censorship written in 2003 . It was published in the magazine Knowledge, Technology & Policy.John Walker (2003), \\"The Digital Imprimatur: How big brother and big media can put the Internet genie back in the bottle\\", Knowledge, Technology & Policy, Volume 16, Issue 3 (Fall 2003), Springer, pages 24-77, (print), (online), . Retrieved 11 August 2014. In the article, Walker argues that there is increasing pressure limiting the ability for Internet users to voice their ideas, as well as predicting further Internet censorship. Walker claims that the most likely candidate to usher what he calls \\"the digital imprimatur\\" is digital rights management, or DRM.\\"Digital Imprimatur in a Nutshell\\", Donna Wentworth and Fred von Lohmann, Electronic Frontier Foundation.

The music of Massachusetts has developed actively since it was first colonized by Britain. The city of Boston is an especially large part of the state's present music scene, which includes several genres of rock, as well as classical, folk, and hip hop music. == Indigenous music == == Concert music == New England Conservatory of Music in Boston Perhaps the most influential early composer of the United States was Lowell Mason. A native of Boston, Mason campaigned against the use of shape- note notation, and for the education in standard notation. He worked with local institutions to release collections of hymns and maintain his stature. Opposed to the shape-note tradition, Mason pushed American music towards a European model. The Bay Psalme Book (The Whole Booke of Psalmes Faithfully Translated into English Metre) was published in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1640; it was the first book of any kind printed in the English colonies of North America. It became the standard used by New England churches for many years, though it contained no music itself, merely providing psalms and pointing readers to other prominent publications. The Bay Psalm Book was faithful to its source, but did not produce beautiful singing. In 1651, then, a third edition was created, and became known as the New England Psalm Book; this became the standard for many years. By this point, the evolution from the Ainsworth Psalter to the New England Psalm Book had steadily dwindled the number of tunes in use. Massachusetts was later home to a number of the most prominent members of the First New England School of itinerant singing masters, including Daniel Read (later of New Haven, Connecticut) and Supply Belcher (later of Farmington, Maine). Massachusetts is home to several formal ensembles: Boston Symphony Orchestra, Boston Pops Orchestra, Boston Lyric Opera, and Tanglewood Festival Chorus. Formal institutions for the perpetuation of formal music exist in the state as well: Boston Conservatory, Longy School of Music, New England Conservatory, and Berklee College of Music. Choral music has been a major part of concert life with two of the oldest choral organizations in the United States based in Massachusetts: Stoughton Musical Society, founded in 1786, and Handel and Haydn Society, founded in 1815. == Sea shanties == As Massachusetts has long maintained a great maritime tradition from the early colonial fishermen to its importance in the whaling industry in the nineteenth century, songs of the sea have been prominent in the state's musical heritage. Traditional English sea shanties were brought to New England and preserved by colonial American seamen. A New England version of the sea shanty \\"Spanish Ladies\\" changes 'England' to 'New England' or, in some versions, 'Boston' or 'New Bedford', and 'British sailors' to 'Yankee Whalermen'. == Folk music == Folklorists who have collected traditional music of Massachusetts include Eloise Hubbard Linscott, whose field recordings from 1938 and 1941 are in the Library of Congress American Folklife Center. A number of musicians with ties to the American folk music revival have Massachusetts connections. While a teenager living in Belmont, Joan Baez gave her first concert at the Club 47 in Cambridge. James Taylor was born in Boston, but later moved to North Carolina before once again relocating to Martha's Vineyard. He now lives in the town of Lenox. Paul Clayton from New Bedford, best known for his song \\"Gotta Travel On\\", was a minor figure in the folk revival. Both Bill Staines, who grew up in Lexington, and Bonnie Raitt, who attended college in Cambridge, were influenced by the folk revival through the concerts at Club 47. The diverse contemporary Massachusetts folk music scene includes musicians such as David Coffin, who specializes in early music and sea music; Lui Collins, a folk singer-songwriter; Vance Gilbert, a folk singer with a background in jazz; and Aoife Clancy, formerly of Cherish the Ladies, who sings traditional Irish and contemporary folk songs. It also includes Ellis Paul, a singer-songwriter who came onto the Boston music scene in the late 1980s after arriving at Boston College on a track scholarship. Since then he has been the recipient of 14 Boston Music Awards. According to the New England Folk Network Web site, Massachusetts hosts more than a dozen annual folk music festivals. Of these, the Lowell Folk Festival claims to be the biggest free folk festival in the United States, while the New England Folk Festival, which began in 1944, may be the longest-running festival in the state. Festivals may include folk music from a wide diversity of cultures. For example, the 2007 New England Folk Festival included Bulgarian, Japanese, and Swedish music, and the 2007 Working Waterfront Festival included Portuguese fado music and Mexican norte√±o. == Jazz == Jazz musicians born in Massachusetts include pianist and composer Irene Higginbotham, multi- instrumentalist Jaki Byard, multi-instrumentalist Bill Dixon, saxophonist and clarinetist Harry Carney, bassist Teddy Kotick, pianist Barbara Carroll, pianist Ralph Burns, keyboardist Chick Corea, trumpeter Max Kaminsky, tenor saxophonist Paul Gonsalves, alto saxophonists Johnny Hodges and Phil Woods, singer Nnenna Freelon, multi-instrumentalist Teddy Charles, drummer and vibraphonist Johnny Rae, pianist Ran Blake, soprano saxophonist and composer Jane Ira Bloom, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, and saxophonist Carol Sudhalter. Pat Metheny, though originally from the midwest, has spent most of his career based in Massachusetts. == R&B; == Doo-wop group The G-Clefs were from Roxbury. The Tune Weavers formed in Woburn. Jonzun Crew was an electro and early funk‚Äìhip hop group that was active in the 1980s in Boston. The R&B; group New Edition is from the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. Masspike Miles is also from Roxbury. == Hip-hop == Massachusetts has produced a number of notable hip-hop artists since the birth of hip-hop, including: *Bell Biv DeVoe *Cousin Stizz *Ed O.G. *Gang Starr *Joyner Lucas *New Edition *Statik Selektah == Rock == The Remains and The Rockin' Ramrods formed in Boston. The Barbarians formed in Cape Cod and The Shames formed in Ipswich. Jonathan Richman The Modern Lovers, featuring Jonathan Richman, David Robinson (later of The Cars), and (for a short time) Jerry Harrison of Talking Heads, came out of Boston, as did more mainstream acts like Aerosmith, The Cars, and Boston. The J. Geils Band formed at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, before adding Peter Wolf and Stephen Jo Bladd from Boston band The Hallucinations to the lineup. Paul Pena was born in Hyannis and attended Clark University in Worcester. He played gigs at the Holden experiment with Bonnie Raitt and other Worcester folkies. He went on to play with T. Bone Walker and wrote the 1970s Steve Miller Band hit \\"Jet Airliner\\". The Real Kids formed in 1972. From the North Shore were the Nervous Eaters who formed in 1977. They were managed by The Rathskeller in Kenmore Square and released two 45s on the club's RAT label. === Alternative rock === Pixies The earliest alternative rock bands in Massachusetts hailed from Boston and included Salem 66, The Neighborhoods, The Neats, Uzi, Volcano Suns, Human Sexual Response, La Peste, and Mission of Burma. Later bands from eastern Massachusetts included Pixies, Morphine, Galaxie 500, Swirlies, and the Pernice Brothers. Farther west, in Amherst, the dissolution of the legendary hardcore punk band Deep Wound spurred the foundation of future legends Sebadoh and Dinosaur Jr. from its ashes. Amherst and neighboring Northampton also spawned the Scud Mountain Boys, Buffalo Tom, Lo Fine, and Cordelia's Dad, the latter uniquely fusing Appalachian folk music with hardcore punk rock.

Two expansion packs were released, The Core Contingency on April 28, 1998 \\"April 28, 1998: \\"Readers have reported sighting Cavedog's expansion pack to their real-time strategy game Total Annihilation titled The Core Contingency in stores today.\\" and Battle Tactics on June 30, 1998. After the closure of the Cavedog Entertainment in 1999, the intellectual property fell to Infogrames (now Atari). Total Annihilation is no longer officially supported, due to the closure of Cavedog. Former lead designer Chris Taylor went on with Gas Powered Games to create Supreme Commander in 2007, considered the \\"spiritual successor\\" of Total Annihilation.Supreme Commander Q&A; at gamespot.com (2005) The creators of XTA, a mod for Total Annihilation, independently developed the open-source 3D graphics Spring game engine. The Total Annihilation 3D project was begun in 2006. Other ex-members of Cavedog, including Total Annihilations game engine developer Jon Mavor, later went on to develop Planetary Annihilation in 2014, another game in the same vein as Total Annihilation. In July 2013, Wargaming bought the Total Annihilation franchise from the Atari bankruptcy proceedings. ==Gameplay== Total Annihilation is set in the far future in the midst of a galactic war, with battles taking place on the surface of planets and moons. The efforts of the player are centered on constructing a defensive base and an offensive force, and conquering opponents. The player is also concerned with gathering resources, reconnaissance and stealth, and evaluation of units and terrain. Battles take place against AI in a story-driven campaign, with the option of playing against other players in a skirmish mode. When starting a new game, the player normally begins with a lone Commander. The Commander is a powerful and irreplaceable unit that has a number of unique abilities such as a destructor weapon that vaporizes anything it hits, the ability to use cloaking and become invisible, and the ability to travel through bodies of water. Construction is governed by the possession of the game's two unlimited resources, Metal and Energy, and can be undertaken by factories or mobile construction units. Every unit belongs to a level of technology (tech level); the higher the level, the more advanced the unit and the more resources and thus time required to construct it. A feature of the game is the ability to easily \\"queue\\" the many commands for a unit or group of units, with types of commands including patrolling a route, constructing a defensive group of structures and attacking enemy units. Once given its commands, the unit will go about them automatically thus minimizing the need for the player's attention to small, repetitive tasks. The victory conditions of a multiplayer game generally involve the elimination of all enemy units, but the aim of single player campaign missions can be more specialized.An in-game screenshot of a Core base. Near the bottom-right corner the Commander (with the yellow backpack) is visible assisting a factory in construction. ===Resources=== Resources in Total Annihilation are handled in a manner different from other real-time strategy games of the day: they are \\"streaming\\", meaning that they are accumulated at a constant rate rather than in small batches; and they are limitless. In addition, all units and structures have a fixed cost, but they build at varying rates depending on the unit constructing them. A Commander, for example, will build a structure three times faster than a construction vehicle, but at a higher cost in energy. If the rate at which resources are used exceeds the rate at which resources are acquired, then the player's reserves will begin to be depleted. If a player's reserves are entirely depleted, the player's production across the board will slow to a rate proportional to the amount by which outflow exceeds income, this is known as \\"nanostalling\\". In addition, if the player runs out of energy, power-dependent structures such as radar towers, metal extractors, and laser towers will cease to function. This adds an element of economic complexity unparalleled in most RTS games of the time period. When a unit or structure is destroyed, it leaves behind wreckage that may be reclaimed for a lump sum of metal. Many terrain structures may also be reclaimed for their metal. Some maps also have plants or other organic structures that can be reclaimed for energy. ===Combat=== The player can command a variety of units including infantry bots, vehicles, ships, hovercraft, aircraft, powerful stationary long range weapons, and even a giant mecha known as the Core Krogoth. Units vary in size, speed and the ability to give and take damage, depending on their tech level. The strongest units take longer to build as well as cost more resources. Each unit has strengths and weaknesses, optimal styles of use, and corresponding units against which it is vulnerable or well-suited. Effective play is usually characterized by consideration of these attributes, as well as efficient resource management, strong defenses, and knowledge of the opponent's strategies. The game's interface consists of construction and command buttons (depending on the unit selected), unit status information, resource information on the production of Energy and Metal, and a minimap which gives an overview of the game's battlespace the visibility of which may be hindered by fog of war, necessitating the use of radar or scout units. There are a few highly advanced units which are invaluable combat-wise, such as nuclear missile launchers which have enormous range and very high damage, as well as long-range artillery that have enough range to attack any point on smaller maps. There are two story-related factions, Arm and Core, which have comparable sets of units (one side a little bit faster, other one a little bit tougher etc.), but are aesthetically different. Generally, the Arm have faster, sleeker units while the Core units are built to take slightly more punishment. This is shown exceptionally well by the Arm being able to build an extremely fast Kbot known as the Zipper, while the Core can build an armored Kbot known simply as The Can. When playing amongst experienced players, subtle differences between the two factions put Core players at a disadvantage. The most noticeable differences are as follows: The level 1 Arm fighter aircraft is 1.7√ó more maneuverable than its Core counterpart, the Arm commander walks 1.12√ó faster than the Core commander, amphibious Arm Kbots float above water, making them faster and more useful than their submerging Core counterparts, Arm players can build Farks, fast assistant repair Kbots which can be crowded around labs and structures to dramatically reduce build times, and level 1 Arm tanks are equipped with superior weapons. Core has some distinct advantage as well, such as superior naval units, level 1 bombers that drop more bombs, and less conspicuous nuclear facilities. These advantages, however, are overshadowed by the Arm advantages in most situations. Total Annihilation was one of the first RTS games to feature radar that showed enemy units within its radius on the minimap. This added an additional element of electronic warfare to the game: players could construct radar jammers that prevented units in a small radius around them from appearing on radar. Mobile radar jammers could be used to create surprise attacks, necessitating the deployment of scout units on a regular basis to reveal said units visually. In addition, radar jammers could disguise the presence of visually cloaked units, such as the commander or land mines. Radar fields rendered cloaked units detectable; a radar jammer could make said units undetectable until the radar jammer was destroyed. Total Annihilation was also one of the first RTS games to point the way towards battlefields with hundreds and thousands of units. Previous games could field a hundred units or so. However, Total Annihilation initially permitted 250 units per side which was later patched to 500. A third party patch allowed up to 5,000 units per side. ===Physics=== The game features a physics engine which governs projectiles, explosions and wreckage. The terrain is displayed as a 2D raster image but contains height values that allow it to act as a 3D surface. Hills obstruct artillery fire, and, depending on the \\"line-of-sight\\" setting, height enhances units' visual and firing ranges. If terrain is steep and jagged, units tilt and turn to meet the face of the ground, slowing down or speeding up in accordance with gravity. Structures can be built on steep terrain to protect them from artillery fire and to create choke points. The wind, tides, and gravity on different maps also vary; some maps have strong wind gusts and are more suited for gathering energy via windmills. Plant life is often flammable and can be set on fire by shooting it. ===Maps=== The game features a number of terrain and tile sets. These represent several different planets that the war between the Arm and Core is being waged on, and contain various unique characteristics. The Core's home world, Core Prime, consists of inorganic metal structures and inky black seas. Since everything is made of metal, the player has unlimited access to this resource and can afford to build armies and bases more rapidly than on most other worlds. Other maps include the Arm's home planet, a grassy green area of forests, hills, and blue water, a barren desert world with rocks and mesas, a Martian landscape, a sandy planet with beaches and blue oceans, a volcanic world with lava instead of water, an ice planet, and more. Many maps contain lakes or oceans; these are impassable by most land units and will require ships or aircraft to reach different landmasses. Certain land units can travel underwater, but in doing so may be attacked by enemy ships and not be able to fight back. Other maps contain lava or acid which is completely impassable except by aircraft. ==Plot== The game's start-up credits give a summary of the game's narrative: > What began as a conflict over the transfer of consciousness from flesh to > machines escalated into a war which has decimated a million worlds. The Core > and the Arm have all but exhausted the resources of a galaxy in their > struggle for domination. Both sides now crippled beyond repair, the remnants > of their armies continue to battle on ravaged planets, their hatred fueled > by over four thousand years of total war. This is a fight to the death. For > each side, the only acceptable outcome is the complete elimination of the > other. Screenshot of an Arm campaign mission. The interface is visible along the top and left sides, displaying resource, minimap, construction and movement information. In the far future the galaxy is ruled by a benevolent central body of humans and artificial intelligences called the Core (a contraction of \\"Consciousness Repository\\"). The Core's technological and economic triumphs have allowed humanity to colonize most of the Milky Way and enjoy peace and prosperity. However, the balance is broken by a technological breakthrough which allows the consciousness of a human being to be reliably transferred into a machine, thereby granting theoretically indefinite life in a process called \\"patterning\\". Following a mandate imposed on humanity by the Core requiring everyone to undergo patterning as a public health measure, a rebel band is formed out of colonies from the edges of the galaxy (hence named the Arm), whose members refused to leave their natural bodies to join the Core's machines. A war lasting four thousand years followed, with the Arm mass- producing clones as pilots for its vehicles and the Core duplicating consciousness-embedded microchips to pilot its own machines. An alternative explanation for the two warring sides stems from an inside joke conceived by the developers. The Core relates to the CPU of the computer - computer core (AI), while the Arm relates to the arm of the player or human intelligence. The game's two campaigns focus on their respective sides' military leaders, the Commanders. The story of either the Core or the Arm starts with an effort to defend the protagonist's homeworld and initiate a turning point in the overall war. The player then fights a series of battles on a number of planets and moons, as transported to through Galactic Gates, a fictional form of faster-than-light travel. As the player progresses, more units become available for construction, either through the course of background story or upon completion of a mission centered on the unit in question. Mission objectives include protecting a vital structure or area, eliminating all enemy units, or capturing a pivotal enemy unit. The worlds upon which the player wages warfare force the player to adapt to different strategies; for example, deployment on a world whose surface is entirely composed of archipelagos necessitates the construction of an effective navy. Some have occasional weather conditions, such as meteor storms. Both campaigns include 25 missions, the final mission ending the war with a final strike on the enemy's homeworld either the Arm's bucolic Empyrrean or the Core's artificial Jupiter Brain world of Core Prime. ==Expansions== ===Downloadable content=== Starting in 1997 Cavedog began offering additional free downloadable content for Total Annihilation, adding new units, maps, and scenarios over time.TA downloadable units on cavedog.com (archived in the Internet Archive on March 30, 2001) ===The Core Contingency=== Cavedog released The Core Contingency a year after the release of Total Annihilation. It features 25 new missions as well as 75 new units. It continues the story after the ending of the Arm campaign. The expansion also comes with the Total Annihilation editor, which allows users to create maps and missions. ===Battle Tactics=== A month after The Core Contigency, Battle Tactics was released, which includes four new units, 100 additional missions as well an experimental approach to Total Annihilation gameplay, with less emphasis on base construction. ===Engine remakes=== Spring Engine is an open source General Public License (GPLv2) engine made for real time strategy games and features games based on Total Annihilation. The engine is multi-platform and features lua scripting to make almost every aspect of the engine customizable. It features online, lan and offline playing. Fully 3D combat with a physics engine. Total Annihilation 3D is a fan-made 3D real-time strategy (RTS) game engine created with the purpose of directly moving Total Annihilation over to a three dimensional plane. The engine has a Microsoft Windows and Linux version, and is programmed in OpenGL and C++. While the engines focus is to recreate the engine and gameplay of Total Annihilation, the engine supports a range of mods. TA3D uses Total Annihilation's Original 3D game assets. TA3D is created under the General Public License (GPL). Robot War Engine (RWE) is an open-source real-time strategy (RTS) game engine that is \\"highly compatible with TA data files\\". It is intended to replicate what Total Annihilation (TA) does with TA data, but without some of the limits that TA has. Given that development of TA3D has ceased (there has been no development for nearly 9 years), after looking at the TA3D source, the creator of RWE determined it would be best to start from scratch, adhering to 4 strict design principles: # Be compatible with TA data # When given TA data, behave like TA does # If there's an alternative that's both easier to implement and at least as good as what TA does, do that instead # Don't do anything else Thus far, RWE has progressed through several stages with descriptive names such as \\"Menu Simulator 5000\\", \\"Map Viewer Extreme\\", and \\"Commander Laser Battle Arena\\". It is currently still in an unfinished pre-alpha development stage, although you can already download a working version with limited features. ==Soundtrack== The game has an original orchestral soundtrack composed by Jeremy Soule and performed by the 95-piece Northwest Sinfonia orchestra. The music changes according to events: during a battle, louder and more frantic music plays. During post-war damage repair or idle construction, a more ambient and mysterious track is played. The soundtrack is in CD-audio format and can be listened to with ordinary CD players. An ordinary music CD can be inserted once the game is under way and can replace the original game music with its own tracks. It is even possible to program such custom CD tracks to the various battlefield situations (conflict, construction, defeat, etc.) like the default set. ==Reception== ===Sales=== Total Annihilation received a global marketing effort at launch, and was concurrently released in 14 countries with English, French and German localizations. In the United States, it debuted at #19 on PC Data's computer game sales chart for September 1997. It rose to 15th place the following month, at an average retail price of $48, but was absent from PC Data's top 20 by November. Shipments to retailers worldwide had reached 250,000 units by the end of October, and an analyst for Merrill Lynch noted that the game was performing well by the start of December, which she felt was a positive sign for GT Interactive's financial recovery at the time. Total Annihilation ultimately sold-through 83,900 copies in the United States by the end of 1997, according to PC Data. PC Gamer US reported that this performance set it behind rival Age of Empires over the same period, but ahead of Activision's Dark Reign: The Future of War. Geoff Keighley later wrote, \\"Cavedog will not release specific sales figures for the game [... but] best estimates from insiders place the sales at well in excess of half a million copies\\".https://web.archive.org/web/20010507104857/http://www.gamespot.com/features/totalstory/page11.html It sold over 1.5 million copies by 2002.http://www.gamershell.com/news_2378.html ===Critical reviews=== The game was highly praised by critics, and won numerous awards, including GameSpot's Game of the Year Award for 1997.Total Annihilation Reviews at metacritic.com It won GameSpy's Top Ten Real-Time Strategy Games of All TimeTop Ten Real-Time Strategy Games of All Time at gamespy.com in 2004, leaving StarCraft in second place. It was also named in GameSpot's 50-game The Greatest Games of All Time list in 2010. The editors stated \\"It's not as famous as Warcraft or Command & Conquer, but Total Annihilation is arguably better than any other real-time strategy game to date.\\" See Awards. Overall, Total Annihilation received aggregated scores of 86 out of 100 from Metacritic and 89% from GameRankings. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Total Annihilation will certainly reign as king of the realtime strategies, at least for now. It's expendable, and if the marketing hype proves true, new abilities for the units should get added in by both expansion packs and downloadable patches. So if you're looking for something that doesn't mimic C&C; to a fault but gives you a lot of realtime challenge and variation, this is the place to go.\\" GamePro said it \\"stands out by providing a deep challenge and excellent replay value.\\" Like Next Generation, they expressed excitement over the promised updates, also praising the line-of-sight features and soundtrack, though they found the unit A.I. demands close supervision from the player. Total Annihilation was a finalist for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' 1997 \\"Strategy Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to StarCraft and Age of Empires (tie). Total Annihilation was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1997 \\"Strategy Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to Myth: The Fallen Lords. In 1999, Next Generation listed Total Annihilation as number 49 on their \\"Top 50 Games of All Time\\", commenting that, \\"Unique innovations such as the field commander, unit waypoints, and true line of sight based on elevation enabled a new level of depth in an overcrowded genre, and made Total Annihilation a standout in the great glut of realtime strategies.\\" ===Awards=== Total Annihilation has won several awards, including: * The number one Real-Time Strategy Game of all time, GameSpy 2004 * 1997 Game of the Year, GameSpot * Best Strategy Game of 1997, GameSpot * Best Multiplayer Game 1997, GameSpot * Best Music 1997, GameSpot * Included in \\"The Greatest Games of All Time\\", GameSpot == See also == * Dark Reign: The Future of War, released around the same time ==References== ==External links== * Official website (archived) * TA-ncient History, Total Annihilations development history from developer Clayton Kauzlaric Category:1997 video games Category:Mac OS games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Video games with expansion packs Category:Windows games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games about cloning Category:Video games about artificial intelligence Category:Faster- than-light travel in fiction Category:GT Interactive Software games Category:Video games scored by Jeremy Soule Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Total Annihilation"},{"id":"305600","text":"Trinity Anglican School (TAS) is an Independent Anglican School in Tropical North Queensland, Australia which opened on 25 May 1983.

It was first introduced in 1967, with the last major revision coming into effect in 2019. It is currently developed and managed by the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA). ==Patterns of study== The majority of students undertake HSC-related courses over the final two years of high school, though it is possible to undertake different study patterns over different time periods or through different teaching organisations. There are a great number of possible courses students can study, totalling over 100 (including languages), in a wide range of subject areas. However, most schools offer students a smaller selection from which they must choose. The only compulsory subject area is English, with one of English Advanced, English Standard, English as an Additional Language or Dialect (EAL/D), or English Studies required for the award of the HSC. (English Extension 1 is also available for English Advanced students, with Extension 2 being offered in Year 12). Individual schools may require their students to undertake certain courses, as is the case with Studies of Religion in many religious schools or Agriculture in agricultural schools. However, these are internal school requirements separate from HSC requirements. Most courses offered comprise a preliminary (Year 11) component and an HSC (Year 12) component. As a general rule the preliminary component must be completed prior to the HSC component. Furthermore, each subject is designated as either one or two \\"units\\". Each unit involves approximately two hours of formal tuition per week, and contributes a maximum mark of 50. The majority of courses are two unit courses, and thus students receive marks out of 100 in these courses. 10 units is the minimum number of units required, however students can attempt more should they choose. If they do, their final ATAR mark is calculated using their best 2 units of English and 8 best other units. Extension courses, each with a value of one unit, may be included in the study program, meaning that a certain subject area may have up to four units, e.g. English (Advanced) (two units) plus English Extension 1 and English Extension 2 (each worth one unit). To be eligible for the award of the HSC a student must have satisfied the requirements in at least twelve preliminary level units, and at least ten HSC level units, with the additional requirements that: * at least two must be English units; * at least six units must be Board-developed courses; * at least three courses are of two unit or greater value. * at least four subjects have been completed. * no more than seven units of science are studied. This was changed from six units in 2019 with the addition of the Science Extension subject. Further restrictions may apply in certain subject areas. Note that these requirements are for the award of the HSC. Further requirements regarding study patterns apply if the student wishes to apply for a separate Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) based on their HSC performance. ==Available courses== There are two main types of courses available in the HSC: Board Developed Courses and Board Endorsed Courses. Board Developed Courses have a syllabus and final exam set by NESA, and generally may be included in the calculation of the ATAR. Board Endorsed Courses are developed by the school, and may vary from school to school in regards to content and assessment. ===English=== Being the only mandatory course for HSC, for English, students must choose between one of the English courses available to study. *English (Standard) *English (Advanced) *English Extension 1 (only available to students studying English (Advanced)) *English Extension 2 (only available to students studying English (Advanced) and English (Extension 1)) *English as an Additional Language or Dialect (EAL/D) (only available to eligible students) *English Studies ===Elective Courses=== The following is a list of elective Board Developed Courses currently available to students.

Due to the large number of language courses, they have been listed separately. The letters B (beginners), C (continuers), E (extension), BS (background speakers), H (heritage) indicate which courses are available for study. Continuers refers to languages that were studied in Years 9 and 10 and will be continued in .

The \\"new\\" syllabus involved the addition of \\"Science Extension\\" and \\"Investigating Science\\" as new courses. These courses were made available to students that commenced teaching in October 2018 for the cohort of 2019. The course \\"Senior Science\\" was discontinued as of October 2018. The reformed syllabus involved changes that are a move towards compulsory English, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Investigating Science and Extension Science in the future. === English === Changes introduced to compulsory English discontinued the field of study \\"Discovery\\" as NESA discovered students would simply hire and pay off third party tutoring companies and/or private tutors in order to completely memorise and regurgitate essay information, in turn causing an imbalance in advantage towards the state of NSW. For the new syllabus, English questions have now become more specific, prompting on-the-spot answers in turn rigorously testing students natural english writing ability and ability to analyse and interpret unseen questions, texts and information. ==Assessment== A student's final mark in each subject is determined by a combination of in- school assessments conducted throughout the HSC component of a course, and externally administered final exam(s) typically held in October or November of that year. In addition to comprising half of a student's final assessment result in a subject, external exam results are also used to statistically moderate in-school assessment results between different schools. These exams are administered by NESA, which is responsible for the overall oversight of the HSC. ==Award== Upon successful completion of a satisfactory pattern of study students are awarded the Higher School Certificate by way of a testamur. Whenever a student has completed a course they also receive feedback regarding their results in that course, which typically includes exam results, school assessment results and the performance band in which their performance lies. Students who achieve excellent results of over 90 in 10 units of study in the HSC are awarded the Premier's Award by the New South Wales government. The most outstanding of these students may also be awarded the Australian Student Prize by the Commonwealth government. The T G Room award of the Mathematical Association of New South Wales is given to the student with the best score in the highest-level HSC mathematics examination.The T G Room Award , Mathematical Association of New South Wales, retrieved 2010-06-01. HSC results may also be used to calculate the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR). Similar ranking processes used previously were called the UAI (Universities Admission Index) and the TER (Tertiary Entrance Rank). The ATAR is a separate ranking calculated by another body, the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC), and is used for determining university entrance. Since 1998 the university entrance rank has been issued separately from the HSC results in order to distinguish the two. ==Vocational equivalent== The vocational equivalent to Year 12 will change from certificate II in 2015 to certificate III in 2020 by the Council of Australian Governments, mainly because Year 12 qualification has minimal hours greater than those of a level II qualification, where they correspond more closely to the hours of level III qualification.Executive summary - The vocational equivalent to Year 12 50x50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Attribution- ShareAlike 3.0 Australia license. Although the completion of high school would lead to better labour market results, it is also established that an scholarly pathway is not always suited for all and that some are unaccustomed to the institutionalised nature of schools. This has led to an understanding that there should be alternatives to Year 12 completion. As such, the idea of a vocational equivalent to Year 12 is a response to this.Assessing the value of additional years of schooling for the non academically inclined by Alfred Dockery, Curtin University of Technology The construct of a vocational equivalent to completing a senior school certificate (denoted by the completion of Year 12) has been an attribute of government policy since the late 1990s, with a declaration stating: > \\"All students have access to the high quality education necessary to enable > the completion of school education to Year 12 or its vocational equivalent > and that provides clear and recognised pathways to employment and further > education and training.\\"Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, > Training and Youth Affairs 1999, Goal 3.6 == Impact on Adolescents == A NSW Health report found that 1 in 11 adolescents who committed suicide had experienced significant levels of HSC-related stress. ==See also== * Education in Australia * University admission * Victorian Certificate of Education * South Australian Certificate of Education * Tasmanian Certificate of Education * Western Australian Certificate of Education * ACT Scaling Test * Queensland Certificate of Education * Overall Position (Queensland) * Bored of Studies ==References== ==External links== * NESA * NSW HSC Online Category:Education in New South Wales Category:School qualifications Category:School examinations Category:Australian Certificate of Education Category:1967 establishments in Australia ","title":"Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)"},{"id":"305629","text":"HSC may stand for: ==Business== * Hughes Systique Corporation * Halifax Shopping Centre * Harmonized System Code * Harsco Corporation ==Computing== * Hitachi Data Systems Corporation Storage Cluster * HSC50 (Hierarchical Storage Controller Model 50), a mass storage controller from Digital Equipment Corporation implementing their Mass Storage Control Protocol * Hughes Systique Corporation ==Medicine== * Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland * Hematopoietic stem cell * Hepatic stellate cell * Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada * Hydraulic Sinus Condensing, a technique used in dentistry to lift the sinus * Hysteroscopy, a method for looking into the uterus via the cervix ==Organizations== * Health Service Commissioner for England * Health Sponsorship Council * Heraldry Society of Canada * Huntington Society of Canada * Health and Safety Commission * United States Homeland Security Council * Harare Sports Club, sports venue in Zimbabwe ==Schooling== === Certificates=== * Higher School Certificate (New South Wales) (New South Wales, Australia) * Higher School Certificate (Victoria), the former high school leaving certificate in Victoria, Australia which was superseded by the Victorian Certificate of Education * Higher School Certificate (UK), a British qualification which preceded the A Level * Higher Secondary (School) Certificate (Bangladesh, India and Pakistan) ===Schools=== * Hampden‚ÄìSydney College * Hillfield Strathallan College, private school in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada * Hsin Sheng College of Medical Care and Management, private junior college in Taoyuan City, Taiwan ===Related=== * High School Cadets * Hindu Students Council ==Other== * High-speed craft * Home Shopping Club, former name of the Home Shopping Network * Hot Sauce Committee Part Two, an album by the Beastie Boys * Houston Ship Channel * Hyper Suprime-Cam, an ultra-wide- field camera for Subaru Telescope * The Mauser HSc pistol * Shaoguan Guitou Airport, IATA code ","title":"HSC"},{"id":"305634","text":"Zhao Gao (died 207 BC) was a Chinese politician. He was an official of the Qin dynasty of China. Allegedly a eunuch, he served as a close aide to all three emperors of the Qin dynasty ‚Äì Qin Shi Huang, Qin Er Shi and Ziying ‚Äì and was regarded as having played an instrumental role in the downfall of the dynasty. Zhao Gao started his career under Qin Shi Huang as Prefect of the Office for Imperial Carriages (‰∏≠ËªäÂ∫ú‰ª§), an official in charge of managing the palace horse- drawn carriages. During this period of time, he also served as an attendant to Huhai, Qin Shi Huang's youngest son, and tutored him in the laws of the Qin Empire. In 210 BC, after Qin Shi Huang died in Shaqiu (Ê≤ô‰∏ò; south of present- day Dapingtai Village, Guangzong County, Hebei), Zhao Gao and Li Si, the Chancellor, secretly changed the emperor's final edict, which named Fusu, the crown prince, the heir to the throne. In the falsified edict, Fusu was ordered to commit suicide while Huhai was named the new emperor. After Huhai was enthroned as Qin Er Shi, he promoted Zhao Gao to Prefect of the Gentlemen of the Palace (ÈÉé‰∏≠‰ª§), an official post whose duties included managing the daily activities in the imperial palace. Zhao Gao, who was highly trusted by Qin Er Shi, instigated the emperor to exterminate his own siblings to consolidate power, and used the opportunity to eliminate his political opponents such as Meng Tian and Meng Yi. He also framed Li Si for treason and had Li Si and his entire family executed, after which he replaced Li Si as Chancellor and monopolised state power. In 207 BC, when rebellions broke out in the lands east of Hangu Pass, Zhao Gao became worried that Qin Er Shi would blame him, so he launched a coup in Wangyi Palace (ÊúõÂ§∑ÂÆÆ; in Xianyang, near present-day Xi'an, Shaanxi) and assassinated the emperor. Following Qin Er Shi's death, Zhao Gao installed Ziying, Fusu's son (allegedly; there is no firm consensus on what Ziying's relationship to the Qin royal family really is), on the throne. Ziying sent Han Tan (ÈüìË´á), a eunuch, to assassinate Zhao Gao. == Early life == Zhao Gao was distantly related to the royal family of the Zhao state of the Warring States period. According to the Records of the Grand Historian, Zhao Gao's parents committed crimes and were punished. His brothers were castrated; it is unclear whether Zhao Gao himself was a eunuch or not. However, Qin Shi Huang valued Zhao Gao since he was learned in criminal law. This was very useful to Qin Shi Huang since he himself was always looking for ways to control the people by laws and punishments. Zhao Gao enjoyed a steady rise in position. When Zhao was a minor official, he committed a crime punishable by death. Meng Yi was the official in charge of sentencing and he sentenced Zhao to death and removed him from the officials list as instructed by Qin Shi Huang. Zhao was later pardoned by Qin Shi Huang and returned to his official status. == Coup following Qin Shi Huang's death == At the end of the reign of Qin Shi Huang, Zhao Gao was involved in the death of Meng Tian and his younger brother, Meng Yi. Meng Tian, a reputable general and a supporter of Qin Shi Huang's eldest son, Fusu, was stationed at the northern border, commanding more than 200,000 troops for the inconclusive campaign against the Xiongnu. Following the sudden death of Qin Shi Huang at Shaqiu, Zhao Gao and Li Si, the Chancellor, persuaded the emperor's youngest son, Huhai, to falsify the emperor's will. The fake decree forced Fusu to commit suicide and stripped Meng Tian of his command. Harbouring hatred for the entire Meng family due to his prior sentencing by Meng Yi, Zhao Gao destroyed the Meng brothers by convincing Huhai to issue a decree that forced Meng Tian to commit suicide and execute Meng Yi. Qin Er Shi, who viewed Zhao Gao as his tutor, became the next Qin emperor. Two years later, Zhao Gao also killed Li Si, executing him via the \\"Five Pains\\" method, Li's own invention. The method consisted of having the victim's nose cut off, cutting off a hand and a foot, then the victim was castrated and finally cut in half in line with the waist. He also had Li Si's entire family exterminated. In 207 BC, rebellions broke out in the lands east of Hangu Pass. Zhao Gao was afraid that Qin Er Shi might make him responsible for the uprisings. To preempt this, he launched a coup and assassinated Qin Er Shi, and then installed Ziying, Fusu's son, as the new emperor. Ziying, however, knew that Zhao Gao intended to kill him afterwards to appease the rebels, so he feigned illness on the day of the coronation, which forced Zhao to arrive at his residence to persuade him to attend. The moment Zhao Gao arrived, Ziying ordered a eunuch, Han Tan, to kill Zhao. Zhao Gao's entire clan was exterminated on Ziying's order. ==Calling a deer a horse== One chengyu (Chinese idiomatic expression) that is derived from an incident involving Zhao Gao is \\"point to a deer and call it a horse\\" () or \\"calling a deer a horse\\", meaning \\"deliberate misrepresentation for ulterior purposes\\". The Records of the Grand Historian records that Zhao Gao, in an attempt to control the Qin government, devised a loyalty test for court officials using a deer and horse: > Zhao Gao was contemplating treason but was afraid the other officials would > not heed his commands, so he decided to test them first. He brought a deer > and presented it to the Second Emperor but called it a horse. The Second > Emperor laughed and said, \\"Is the chancellor perhaps mistaken, calling a > deer a horse?\\" Then the emperor questioned those around him. Some remained > silent, while some, hoping to ingratiate themselves with Zhao Gao, said it > was a horse, and others said it was a deer. Zhao Gao secretly arranged for > all those who said it was a deer to be brought before the law and had them > executed instantly. Thereafter the officials were all terrified of Zhao Gao. > Zhao Gao gained military power as a result of that. (tr. Watson 1993:70) == Alternative viewpoints == There is a theory that Zhao Gao was a descendant of the royal family of the Zhao state, which was destroyed by the Qin state, and Zhao Gao was seeking revenge on Qin. With Zhao Gao in charge of the Qin government, it was natural that the Qin Empire collapsed in such a short time. In fact, Zhao Gao killed all the sons and daughters of Qin Shi Huang, including the Second Emperor, Huhai. In revenge, Ziying killed Zhao Gao and all of his family members. Thus, Zhao Gao or his brothers have no known descendants. Commentators who hold this view praise him for his part in the destruction of the Qin empire. The historian Li Kaiyuan (ÊùéÈñãÂÖÉ) believes Zhao Gao was not a eunuch at all. He bases this in part on the fact eunuchs were not allowed to serve as chancellors, which Zhao did. == References == *Records of the Grand Historian, volumes 87 and 88 Category:207 BC deaths Category:3rd- century BC births Category:Chinese chancellors Category:Chinese eunuchs Category:Chinese folklore Category:Chinese regicides Category:People executed by the Qin dynasty Category:Qin dynasty politicians Category:Qin Shi Huang Category:Place of birth unknown Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Heads of government who were later imprisoned Category:Victims of familial execution ","title":"Zhao Gao"},{"id":"305638","text":"A reel-to-reel tape recorder (Sony TC-630), typical of those which were once common audiophile objects. Note the distinctive Scotch tape spool at left. Reel-to-reel audio tape recording, also called open-reel recording, is the form of magnetic tape audio recording in which the recording medium is held on a reel that is not permanently mounted in an enclosed cassette. In use, the supply reel (feed reel) containing the tape is placed on a spindle or hub; the end of the tape is manually pulled out of the reel, threaded through mechanical guides and a tape head assembly, and attached by friction to the hub of the second, initially empty takeup reel. Reel-to-reel systems use tape that is wide, which normally moves at . All standard tape speeds are derived as a binary submultiple of 30 inches per second. The tape in a compact cassette is wide and normally moves at . By writing the same audio signal across more tape, reel-to-reel systems give much greater fidelity, at the cost of much larger tapes. In spite of the larger tapes, less convenience, and generally more expensive media, reel-to-reel systems, which first started in the early 1940s, remained popular in audiophile settings into the 1980s, and have reestablished a specialist niche in the 21st century. Reel-to-reel tape was used in early tape drives for data storage on mainframe computers and in video tape recorders (VTRs). Magnetic tape was also used to record data signals for instrumentation purposes, beginning with the hydrogen bomb tests of the early 1950s. Studer, Stellavox, Tascam, and Denon still produced reel to reel tape recorders in the 1990s, but , only Mechlabor continues to manufacture analog reel-to-reel recorders. Currently (2020), there are two companies that manufacture magnetic recording tape: ATR Services of York, Pennsylvania, and Recording the Masters in Avranches, France. ==History== Magnetophon from a German radio station in World War II. The reel-to-reel format was used in the earliest tape recorders, including the pioneering German-British Blattnerphone (1928) machines of the late 1920s which used steel tape,\\"Blattnerphone\\", Orbem.co.uk, retrieved 02 February 2014 and the German Magnetophon machines of the 1930s. Originally, this format had no name, since all forms of magnetic tape recorders used it. The name arose only with the need to distinguish it from the several kinds of tape cartridges or cassettes such as the endless loop cartridge developed for radio station commercials and spot announcements in 1954, the full size cassette, developed by RCA in 1958 for home use, as well as the compact cassette developed by Philips in 1962, originally for dictation. The earliest machines produced distortion during the recording process which German engineers significantly reduced during the Nazi Germany era by applying a \\"bias\\" signal to the tape. In 1939, one machine was found to make consistently better recordings than other ostensibly identical models, and when it was taken apart a minor flaw was noticed. Instead of DC, it was introducing an AC bias signal to the tape , and this was quickly adapted to new models using a high-frequency AC bias that has remained a part of audio tape recording to this day. The quality was so greatly improved that recordings surpassed the quality of most radio transmitters, and such recordings were used by Adolf Hitler to make broadcasts that appeared to be live while he was safely away in another city. American audio engineer Jack Mullin was a member of the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II. His unit was assigned to investigate German radio and electronics activities, and in the course of his duties, a British Army counterpart mentioned the Magnetophons being used by the allied radio station in Bad Nauheim near Frankfurt. He acquired two Magnetophon recorders and 50 reels of I.G. Farben recording tape and shipped them home. Over the next two years, he worked to develop the machines for commercial use, hoping to interest the Hollywood film studios in using magnetic tape for movie soundtrack recording. Unitra ZK-147, a vintage Polish-made reel-to-reel tape recorder Mullin gave a demonstration of his recorders at MGM Studios in Hollywood in 1947, which led to a meeting with Bing Crosby, who immediately saw the potential of Mullin's recorders to pre-record his radio shows. Crosby invested $50,000 in a local electronics company, Ampex, to enable Mullin to develop a commercial production model of the tape recorder. Using Mullin's tape recorders, and with Mullin as his chief engineer, Crosby became the first American performer to master commercial recordings on tape and the first to regularly pre-record his radio programs on the medium. Ampex and Mullin subsequently developed commercial stereo and multitrack audio recorders, based on the system originally invented by Ross Snyder of Ampex Corporation for their high-speed scientific instrument data recorders. Les Paul had been given one of the first Ampex Model 200 tape decks by Crosby in 1948, and ten years later ordered one of the first Ampex eight track \\"Sel Sync\\" machines for multitracking, (although when it arrived, it was still set up as an instrument recorder running at 60 inches-per-second and had yet to be converted for audio use). Ampex engineers, who included Ray Dolby on their staff at the time, went on to develop the first practical videotape recorders in the early 1950s to pre-record Crosby's TV shows. PET film backings. Inexpensive reel-to-reel tape recorders were widely used for voice recording in the home and in schools, along with dedicated models expressly made for business dictation, before the Philips compact cassette, introduced in 1963, gradually took over. Cassettes eventually displaced reel-to-reel recorders for consumer use. However, the narrow tracks and slow recording speeds used in cassettes compromised fidelity. Ampex produced pre-recorded reel-to-reel tapes for consumers of popular and classical music from the mid-1950s to the mid-'70s, as did Columbia House from 1960 to 1984. Following the example set by Bing Crosby, large reel-to-reel tape recorders rapidly became the main recording format used by audiophiles and professional recording studios until the late 1980s when digital audio recording techniques began to allow the use of other types of media (such as Digital Audio Tape (DAT) cassettes and hard disks). Even today, some artists of all genres prefer analog tape, claiming it is more \\"musical\\" or \\"natural\\" sounding than digital processes, despite its fidelity inaccuracies. Due to harmonic distortion, bass can thicken up, creating a fuller-sounding mix. In addition, high end frequencies can be slightly compressed, which some claim is more natural to the human ear, though this claim is difficult to quantify due to the very personal aesthetics as to what is 'natural' sound. In this century, it is not uncommon for some artists to record directly onto digital equipment and then re-record the tracks to analog reel tape (or vice versa) for this effect, which can sound pleasing or \\"warmer\\" due to the increase of even harmonics that can often enhance musicality, much in the way vacuum tube amplifiers are preferred over solid- state devices for the same reasons. In addition to all of these attributes, tape \\"saturation\\" is a unique form of distortion that many rock, blues and funk artists find very satisfying, though with modern technology, these forms of distortion can be simulated digitally. The great practical advantage of tape for studios was twofold ‚Äì it allowed a performance to be recorded without the 30-minute time limitation of a phonograph disc, and it permitted a recorded performance to be edited or erased and re-recorded again and again on the same piece of media without any waste. For the first time, audio could be manipulated as a physical entity, and the recording process was greatly economized by eliminating the requirement for a highly trained disc-cutting engineer to be present at every recording session. Once a tape machine was installed and calibrated, there was no need for any attendant engineering, other than to spool or replace the tape being used on it. Daily maintenance only consisted of cleaning and occasionally demagnetizing the heads and guides. Tape editing is performed simply by cutting the tape at the required point, and rejoining it to another section of tape using adhesive tape, or sometimes glue. This is called a splice. The splicing tape has to be very thin to avoid impeding the tape's motion, and the adhesive is carefully formulated to avoid leaving a sticky residue on the tape or deck. \\"Butt\\" splices (cut at exactly 90 degrees to the tape travel) were used for fast edits from one sound to another, though preferably, the splice is made at a much lower angle across the tape so that any \\"click\\" or other noise introduced by the cut is spread across a few milliseconds of the recording. The low-angle splice would also help to glide the tape more smoothly through the machine and push any loose dirt or debris to the side of the tape path, instead of accumulating in the splice joint. The use of reels to supply and collect the tape made it very easy for editors to manually move the tape back and forth across the heads to find the exact point they wished to edit. Tape to be spliced was clamped in a special splicing block attached to the deck near the heads to hold the tape accurately while the edit was made. A skilled editor could make these edits very rapidly and accurately. A side-effect of cutting the tape at an angle is that on stereo tapes the edit occurs on one channel a split-second before the other. Long, angled splices can also be used to create a perceptible dissolve from one sound to the next; periodic segments can induce rhythmic or pulsing effects.Thom Holmes, Electronic and experimental music, 2nd ed., p. 79 Professional-style tape reel designed to fit large NARTB hub. The performance of tape recording is greatly affected by the width of the tracks used to record a signal, and the speed of the tape. The wider and faster the better, but of course this uses more tape. These factors lead directly to improved frequency response, signal-to-noise ratio, and high-frequency distortion figures. Tape can accommodate multiple parallel tracks, allowing not just stereo recordings, but multi-track recordings too. This gives the producer of the final edit much greater flexibility, allowing a performance to be remixed long after the performance was originally recorded. This innovation was a great driving force behind the explosion of popular music in the late 1950s and 1960s. The first multi-tracking recorders had two, three, or four tracks, then eight, sixteen, and twenty-four, and so on. It was discovered early on that new special effects were possible, such as phasing and flanging, delays and echo by re-directing the signal through one or more additional tape machines, while recording the composite result to another. These innovations appeared on pop recordings shortly after multi-tracking recorders were introduced, although, Les Paul had been using tape echo and speed-manipulation effects on his single-track recordings from the 1940s and '50s. A typical home reel-to-reel tape recorder, this one made by Sonora. It could play stereo quarter-track tapes, but record only in one quarter-track mono. Home equipment with missing features were fairly common in the 1950s and 1960s. For home use, simpler reel-to-reel recorders were available, and a number of track formats and tape speeds were standardised to permit interoperability and prerecorded music. Reel-to-reel tape editing also gained cult-status when many used this technique on hit-singles in the 1980s. There has recently been a revival of reel-to-reel, with quite a few companies restoring vintage units and some manufacturing new tape. In 2018, the first new reel-to-reel tape player in over 20 years was released. ==Pre-recorded reel tapes== Universum in Ciudad Universitaria in Mexico City The first prerecorded reel-to-reel tapes were introduced in the United States in 1949; the catalog contained fewer than ten titles with no popular artists. In 1952, EMI started selling pre-recorded tapes in Great Britain. The tapes were twin-sided and mono (2 tracks) and were duplicated in real time on modified EMI BTR2 recorders. RCA Victor joined the reel-to-reel business in 1954. In 1955, EMI released 2-track \\"stereosonic\\" tapes, although the catalog took longer to be published. Since these EMI tapes were much more expensive than a vinyl LP record, sales were poor; still, EMI released over 300 \\"stereosonic\\" titles. Then they introduced their Twin Packs, which contained the equivalent of two LP albums but playing at 3.75ips. The heyday of prerecorded reel tapes was the mid-1960s, but after the introduction of less complicated cassette tapes and 8-track tapes, the number of albums released on prerecorded reel tape dropped dramatically despite their superior sound quality. By the latter 1960s, their retail prices were considerably higher than competing formats, and musical genres were limited to those most likely to appeal to well-heeled audiophiles willing to contend with the cumbersome threading of open-reel tape. The introduction of the Dolby noise- reduction system narrowed the performance gap between cassettes and open-reel, and by 1976 prerecorded open-reel offerings had almost completely disappeared, even from record stores and audio equipment shops. Columbia House advertisements in 1978 showed that only one-third of new titles were available on reel-to-reel; they continued to offer a select number of new releases in the format until 1984. Heavenly by Johnny Mathis. Produced by Columbia Records (CQ 333). Circa 1959. Recorded for playback at 7.5 inches per second. Sales were very low and specialized during the 1980s. Audiophile reel tapes were made under license by Barclay-Crocker between 1977 and 1986. Licensors included Philips, Deutsche Grammophon, Argo, Vanguard, Musical Heritage Society and L'Oiseau Lyre. Barclay-Crocker tapes were all Dolby encoded and some titles were also available in the dbx format. The majority of the catalog contained classical recordings, with a few jazz and movie soundtrack albums. Barclay-Crocker tapes were duplicated on modified Ampex 440 machines at four times the playing speed, unlike popular reel tapes which were duplicated at 16 times the playback speed. All of the known pre-recorded reel-to-reels on the market are all documented at the Reel To Reel Index website which focuses on the last reels made during the 1980s and includes photographs of all of them. David Winter also released the complete list of 1950s EMI and Barclay-Crocker tapes. Pre-recorded reel-to-reel tapes are also available once again, albeit somewhat expensively as a very high-quality audiophile product, through \\"The Tape Project\\", as well as several other independent studios and record labels. Since 2007, The Tape Project has released their own albums, as well as previously-released albums under license from other labels, on open-reel tape. The German label Analogue Audio Association (\\"AAA\\") has also re-released albums on open-reel tape to the high-end audiophile market. ==Tape speeds== In general, the faster the speed, the better the reproduction quality. Higher tape speeds spread the signal longitudinally over more tape area, reducing the effects of dropouts that can be audible from the medium, and noticeably improve high frequency response. Slower tape speeds conserve tape and are useful in applications where sound quality is not critical. * : used for very long-duration recordings (e.g. recording a radio station's entire output in case of complaints, aka \\"logging\\"). * : usually the slowest domestic speed, best for long duration speech recordings. Compact Tape Cassettes typically operate at this speed. * : common domestic speed, used on most single-speed domestic machines, reasonable quality for speech and off-air radio recordings. * : highest domestic speed, also slowest professional; used by most radio stations for \\"dubs\\", copies of commercial announcements. Through the early to mid 1990s, many stations could not handle 15 IPS. * : professional music recording and radio programming. * : used where the best possible treble response and lowest noise-floor are demanded, though bass response might suffer. Speed units of inches per second or in/s are also abbreviated IPS. in/s and in/s are the speeds that were used for (the vast majority of) consumer market releases of commercial recordings on reel-to-reel tape. in/s is also the speed used in 8-track cartridges. in/s is also the speed used in Compact cassettes. In some early prototype linear video tape recording systems developed in the early 1950s from companies such as Bing Crosby Enterprises, RCA, and the BBC's VERA, the tape speed was extremely high, over , to adequately capture the large amount of image information. The need for a high linear tape speed was made unnecessary with the introduction of the now- obsolete professional Quadruplex system in 1956 by Ampex, which segmented the fields of a television image by recording (and reproducing) several tracks at a high-speed across the width of the tape per field of video by way of a vertically spinning headwheel with 4 separate video heads mounted on its edge (a technique called transverse scanning), allowing for the linear tape speed to be much slower. Eventually, transverse scanning was accompanied by the later (and less-expensive) technology of helical scanning, which could record one whole field of video per helically-recorded track, recorded at a much lower angle across the width of the tape by the head spinning in the near- horizontal plane, instead of vertically. ===Quality aspects=== Even though a recording on tape may have been made at studio quality, tape speed was the limiting factor, much like bit rate is today. Decreasing the speed of analog audio tape causes a uniform decrease in the linearity of the frequency response, increased background noise (hiss), more noticeable dropouts where there are flaws in the magnetic tape, and shifting of the (Gaussian) background noise spectrum toward lower frequencies (where it sounds more \\"granular\\") regardless of the audio content. An MP3 of a noisy rock band at a low bit rate will have many more artifacts than a simple flute solo at the same bit rate, whereas either on low-speed tape will have the same uniform background noise profile and high frequency saturation (weakened high end response). A recording on magnetic audio tape is linear; unlike today's digital audio, not only was jumping from spot to spot to edit time-consuming, editing was destructive‚Äîunless the recording was duplicated before edit, normally taking the same amount of time to copy, in order to preserve 75-90 percent of the quality of the original. Editing was done either with a razor blade‚Äîby physically cutting and splicing the tape on a metal splicing block, in a manner similar to motion picture film editing‚Äîor electronically by dubbing segments onto an edit tape. The former method preserved the full quality of the recording but not the intact original; the latter incurred the same quality loss involved in dubbing a complete copy of the source tape, but preserved the original. Tape speed is not the only factor affecting the quality of the recording. Other factors affecting quality include track width, oxide formulation, and backing material and thickness. The design and quality of the recorder are also important factors, in many ways that are not applicable to digital recording systems. The machine's speed stability (wow- and-flutter), head gap size, head quality, and general head design and technology, and the machine's alignment (mostly a maintenance issue, but also a matter of design‚Äîhow well and precisely it can be aligned) electro- mechanically affect the quality of the recording. The regulation of tape tension affects contact between the tape and the heads and has a very significant impact on the recording and reproduction of high frequencies. The track width of the machine, which is a question of format rather than individual machine design, is one of two major machine factors controlling signal-to-noise ratio (assuming the electronics have high enough S/N ratio not to be a factor), the other being tape speed. S/N ratio varies directly with track width, due to the Gaussian nature of tape noise; doubling the track width doubles the S/N ratio (hence, with good electronics and comparable heads, 8-track cartridges should have half the signal-to-noise ratio of quarter-track \\" tape at the same speed, IPS.) Tape formulation affects the retention of the magnetic signal, especially high frequencies, the frequency linearity of the tape, the S/N ratio, print-through, optimum AC bias level (which must be set by a technician aligning the machine to match the tape type used, or more crudely set with a switch to approximate the optimum setting.) Tape formulation varies between different tape types (ferric oxide [Fe2O3], chromium dioxide [CrO2], etc.) and also in the precise composition of a specific brand and batch of tape. (Studios therefore generally align their machines for one brand and model number of tape and use only that brand and model.) Backing material type and thickness affect the tensile strength and elasticity of the tape, which affect wow-and-flutter and tape stretch; stretched tape will have a pitch error, possibly fluctuating. Backing thickness also affects print-through, the phenomenon of adjacent layers of tape wound on a reel picking up weak copies of the magnetic signal from each other. Print-through on analog tape causes unintended pre- and post-echoes on playback, and is generally not fully reversible once it has occurred. In professional half-track use, post-echo is considered less problematic than pre-echo (as the echo is largely masked by the signal itself) and therefore tapes stored for long periods are kept \\"tails-out\\", where the tape must be first wound \\"backwards\\" onto the take-up spool before playback. Another quality aspect, not related to audio quality, is the backing material. Typically acetate was used for cheaper tape, and Mylar for more expensive tape. Acetate would tend to break under conditions that Mylar would survive, though possibly stretch. The quality of the oxide's binder was also important, for it was common with old tape for the backing to wind on the reel, while the oxide falls off. In the 1980s, several manufacturers produced certain tape formulations blending polyurethane and polyester as backing material which tended to absorb humidity over many years in storage and partially deteriorate. This problem would only be discovered after an archived tape was opened and required to be played again, after possibly a decade or less on the shelf. The deterioration resulted in a softening of the backing material, making it gooey and sticky which quickly clogged-up tape guides and heads of the reproducer. This phenomenon is known as \\"Sticky-Shed Syndrome\\" and can be temporarily reversed by baking the tape at a low temperature for several hours to dry it out and restore firmness. The restored tape may then be played normally for several days or weeks, but will eventually return to a deteriorated state again. ===Noise reduction=== Electronic noise reduction techniques were also developed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range of analog sound recordings. Dolby noise reduction includes a suite of standards (designated A, B, C, S and SR) for both professional and consumer recording. The Dolby systems use frequency dependent compression/expansion (companding) during the recording/playback, respectively. Initially, Dolby was offered via a stand-alone box that would go between a recorder and amplifier. Later audio devices often included Dolby. DBX is another noise reduction system that uses a more aggressive companding technique to improve both dynamic range and noise level. However, DBX recordings do not sound acceptable when played on non-DBX equipment. In the late 1970s there was also the German Telefunken-made High Com NR system, a broadband compander, which was technically very advanced. That was a gain in dynamics of roughly 25 dB that outperformed the well-known Dolby B by far. High Com was included in more sophisticated cassette recorders, mostly alongside the various Dolby systems. Even though this applied to the consumer market, there was no tape hiss at all that an ear could realize. Another advantage was that recorded tapes could be exchanged amongst High Com recorders without any loss of quality in sound. The \\"pumping effect\\" mostly reported from critical sound material (e.g. drums or any percussive instrument) with advanced dbx NR did not show in properly calibrated High Com recordings. It did not penetrate the market, possibly due to the less aggressive marketing strategies typical for German companies at that time compared to the widely known Dolby systems. Dolby B eventually became the most popular system for Compact Cassette noise reduction. Today Dolby SR is in widespread use for professional analog tape recording. ==Multi-track recorders== As studio audio production progressed and became more and more advanced, it became desirable to record the individual instruments and human voices separately and mix them down to one, two, or more speaker channels later, rather than in real time in the studio before recording. In addition to allowing recording engineers and producers to experiment with different mixing arrangements, effects, etc. on the same performance and to produce multiple versions of a recording (without having multiple duplicates of all the studio control room equipment used for mixing), multi-tracking enables the use of non-real-time effects or effects that cannot be produced in the same studio where the musicians perform. Another huge benefit of multi-track production is that recording of individual tracks or certain instruments could be done at different locations at any later date, if required. This allowed a producer to record basic tracks at a given studio, then take that tape to any other studio in the world that used the same format, and record additional tracks as needed for the same piece of music. Reel-to-reel recorders with eight, sixteen, twenty-four, and even thirty-two tracks were eventually built, with as many heads recording synchronized parallel linear tracks. Some of these machines were larger than a laundry washing machine and used tape as wide as . A single new reel of 1\\" or wider tape, could easily cost $200 to $400. Still, in professional studios, most tapes were recorded only once, and all recording was on new tape, to ensure the maximum quality, as studio time and the time of skilled musicians was much higher than the cost of tape, making it not worth the risk of a recording being lost or degraded due to using media that had been previously recorded upon. If more than 24 tracks of recording were required, it was possible in the mid-1970s and onwards with advanced servo- controlled machines to synchronize two (or more) 24-track recorders to behave as a single 48-track recorder (46 usable tracks due to the time code stripped on the first channel of each tape). Such precise synchronization was achieved by recording a time code on one of the tracks on each reel of tape: a computer system would keep the two time codes perfectly synchronized, and transparently as seen by the machine operator. ==Digital reel-to-reel== As professional audio evolved from analog magnetic tape to digital media, engineers adapted magnetic tape technology to digital recording, producing digital reel-to-reel magnetic tape machines. Before large hard disks became economical enough to make hard disk recorders viable, studio digital recording meant recording on digital tape. Mitsubishi's ProDigi and Sony's Digital Audio Stationary Head (DASH) were the primary digital reel-to-reel formats in use in recording studios from the early 1980s through the mid-1990s. Nagra introduced digital reel-to-reel tape recorders for use in film sound recording. Digital reel-to- reel tape eliminated all the traditional quality limitations of analog tape, including background noise (hiss), high frequency roll-off, wow and flutter, pitch error, nonlinearity, print-through, and degeneration with copying, but the tape media was even more expensive than professional analog open reel tape, and the linear nature of tape still placed restrictions on access, and winding time to find a particular spot was still a significant drawback. Also, while the quality of digital tape did not progressively degrade with use of the tape, the physical sliding of the tape over the heads and guides meant that the tape still did wear, and eventually that wear would lead to digital errors and permanent loss of quality if the tape was not copied before reaching that point. Still, digital reel-to-reel tape represented a significant advance in audio recording technology, and most who could afford to record using digital tape generally did. 3M's 32-track recorder was priced at $115,000 in 1978 (). Best known for its lines of tape media and professional analog recorders, with its M series of multitrack and 2-track machines, the Mincom division of 3M spent several years developing a digital recording system, including two years of joint research with the BBC. The result was the 3M Digital Audio Mastering System, which consisted of a 32-track deck (16-bit, 50 kHz audio) running 1-inch tape and a 4-track, 1/2-inch mastering recorder. The extremely short wavelengths recorded by a digital tape recorded meant that tape and tape transport cleanliness was an important issue. Specks of dust or dirt were large enough in relation to the signal wavelengths that contamination by such dirt could render a recording unplayable. Advanced digital error correction systems, without which the system would have been unworkable, still failed to cope with poorly maintained tape or recorders, and for this reason a number of tapes made in the early years of digital reel-to-reel recorders are now useless. Because digital audio recording technology advanced over the years, with development of cassette- based tape recording formats (such as DAT) and tapeless recording, digital reel-to-reel audio recording is now obsolete, also because no new metal particle reel tapes for digital audio recording are manufactured today - only ferric oxide tapes for analog recording. ==As a musical instrument== Early reel-to-reel users realized that segments of tape could be spliced together and otherwise manipulated by adjusting playback speed or direction of a given recording. In the same way as modern keyboards allow sampling and playback at different speeds, a reel-to-reel could accomplish similar feats in the hands of a talented user. * In the late 1940s, Les Paul began experimenting in his sound studio with the idea of creating a virtual dance band or jazz ensemble by multiplying only himself playing guitar and his wife, vocalist Mary Ford, using a technique of \\"bouncing\\" or overdubbing from one tape machine to another as many times as needed, layering new vocal or instrument parts on top of the previously recorded tracks simultaneously each time. While this had been accomplished in the past using phonograph discs, that process was cumbersome and resulted in poor audio quality after only one or two overdubs. Additionally, a cut disc had to be discarded if there was any mistake, unlike tape which could simply be re-wound and started again. Magnetic tape recording also allowed Paul to create instruments that sounded in higher or lower octaves by manipulating the speed of the tape while recording his guitar. Additionally, tape echo was almost always used by him to either enhance ambience or create a special effect. He and Mary Ford produced many popular recordings over the next two decades using these techniques, one of their most famous being \\"How High the Moon\\". * In 1958, Ross Bagdasarian, aka David Seville, recorded his voice at one-half normal speed, raising its pitch a full octave when played back at normal speed, to create the early rock and roll novelty song Witch Doctor. He later used the same technique, plus overdubbing his voice three times, to create Alvin and the Chipmunks. Numerous other creators of novelty, comedy, and children's records, such as Sheb Wooley, Sascha Burland, and Ray Stevens have since used this process. * The mellotron is an electro-mechanical, polyphonic tape replay keyboard that used a bank of parallel linear magnetic audio tape strips. Playback heads underneath each key enable the playing of pre-recorded sounds. Each of the tape strips has a playing time of approximately eight seconds, after which the tape comes to a dead stop and rewinds to the start position. * The title track of Jimi Hendrix's album Are You Experienced, on which the guitar solo and much of the drum track was recorded, then played backwards on a reel-to-reel. * The Beatles recorded many songs using reel to reel tape as a part of the creative process. Examples include \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" which used a technique where stock recordings were cut up and then randomly reassembled and overdubbed on to the songs (recordings of calliope organs on \\"Mr. Kite\\", and recordings of marching bands on \\"Yellow Submarine\\").Emrick, Geoff. Here, There and Everywhere, p.168 On \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" multiple tape machines were used all interconnected patching tape loops that had been prepared by the band. The loops were played in a variety of ways such as backwards, sped up and slowed down. To record the song, the machines, which were located in separate studio rooms, were all manned by individual technicians and played at once to record on the fly.Emrick, p.113. \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" combined two different taped versions of the song. The versions were independently altered in speed to end up together miraculously both on pitch and tempo.Emrick, p.139. \\"I Am the Walrus\\" used a radio tuner patched into the sound console to layer random live broadcast over an existing taped track.Emrick, p.215. \\"Revolution 9\\" also had many effects produced using a reel-to-reel and tape editing techniques. * The BBC Radiophonic Workshop, notably Delia Derbyshire who \\"performed\\" (a more accurate term would be \\"realised\\") the original theme tune to the BBC series Doctor Who, by recording various sounds including oscillators and then manually cutting together each individual note on a group of reel-to-reels. * The British rock band 10 CC created a 'human harmonium' of sorts on a 16-track tape recorder by overdubbing their own voices many dozens of times, singing only a single note each time. The cumulative result was a total of 630 voices spread evenly over an octave-and-a-half of proper musical scale notes, with each of the distinct notes assigned to an individual track of the tape. When played back, any track (or note) could then be faded in and out manually on a mixing console arranged like a piano keyboard, to simulate an immense virtual choir. This effect provided the atmospheric backing instrumentation for their song \\"I'm not in Love\\". * Blues guitarist Claudio Gabis, faced with the need to amplify his electric guitar, used a homemade monochrome Geloso recorder as a distorter for his debut album Manal of 1970. This was achieved by injecting a signal and letting it \\"record under vacuum\\" (without tape, recording infinitely), an amplified signal could be obtained and, considerably increasing the volume, could be distorted.Las biograf√≠as m√°s salvajes del rock Rolling Stone (Argentina), (in Spanish). Consultado el 9 de abril de 2014. Also in the first single of the group \\"Qu√© pena me das\\", has abrupt endings with tapes passed upside down.Informe especial Manal Dos Potencias (in Spanish). * Aaron Dilloway, founding member of Wolf Eyes, often utilizes a reel to reel tape machine in his solo performances. * Yamantaka Eye of the band Boredoms uses a reel-to-reel tape as an instrument in live performances and in post-production (a good example would be in the track \\"Super You\\" from the album Super √¶). * Mission of Burma, whose fourth member Martin Swope \\"played\\" a reel-to-reel tape recorder live, either playing previously recorded samples at certain times or recording part of the band's performance and playing it back either in reverse or at different speeds. When the band re- formed in 2002, audio engineer Bob Weston took over Swope's role at the tape deck. * Musique concr√®te in general. * Pink Floyd's cash register introduction to their track \\"Money\\" was made using a loop of \\"splices\\" which was looped around a mic stand and through a tape player. * Steve Tibbetts is a recording artist who includes tape editing as a significant portion of the creative process. * Frank Zappa's Lumpy Gravy , We're Only In It For the Money and Uncle Meat, each featured edits too numerous to mention, in addition to multiple instances of speed alteration and intricately layered samples upon samples. * The improviser Jerome Noetinger uses a ReVox A77 reel-to-reel to create and manipulate tape loops in live performance. In addition, multiple reel-to-reel machines used in tandem can also be used to create echo and delay effects. The Frippertronics configuration used by Brian Eno and Robert Fripp on numerous of their 1970s and '80s recordings illustrates these possibilities.In particular, the back cover of Eno's 1975 album Discreet Music provides a technical diagram of the dual reel-to-reel setup and other components used in recording the selections on that album. ==See also== * Audio format * Audio storage * Audio tape length and thickness * Multitrack recording * Sound recording and reproduction * Magnetophon ==References== ==External links== * Website dedicated to the indexing of all known pre- recorded Reel to Reels during their last decade of production up to 1984 including scans of all items * A true history of magnetic recording (dates and facts)in German language will be found here * A history of magnetic recording, BBC/H2G2 * Collectible Reel to Reel Music Tapes * David Winter's 1950s EMI tape list * David Winter's Barclay Crocker tape list * Documentary sound recordist discusses his work using a Nagra reel to reel tape recorder on documentary production Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1928 Category:Audio storage Category:German inventions Category:Tape recording fr:Magn√©tophone ","title":"Reel-to-reel audio tape recording"},{"id":"305650","text":"The ' command is a standard Unix command utility used to create a hard link or a symbolic link (symlink) to an existing file or directory. The use of a hard link allows multiple filenames to be associated with the same file since a hard link points to the inode of a given file, the data of which is stored on disk. On the other hand, symbolic links are special files that refer to other files by name. The command by default creates hard links, and when called with the command line parameter creates symbolic links. Most operating systems prevent hard links to directories from being created since such a capability could disrupt the structure of a file system and interfere with the operation of other utilities. The command can however be used to create symbolic links to non-existent files. ==History== ln appeared in Issue 2 of the X/Open Portability Guidelines. The version of bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Mike Parker and David MacKenzie. The command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system. ==Links== Links allow more than one filename to refer to the same file as in the case of a hard link or act as pointers to a filename as in the case of a soft link. Both hard links and soft links can be created by the command. Specifically, #Hard links, also known simply as links, are objects that associate the filename with the inode, and therefore the file contents itself. A given file on disk could have multiple links scattered through the directory hierarchy, with all of the links being equivalent since they all associate with the same inode. Creating a link therefore does not copy the contents of the file but merely causes another name to be associated with the same contents. Each time a hard link is created, a link counter that is a part of the inode structure gets incremented; a file is not deleted until its reference count reaches zero. However, hard links can only be created on the same file system; this can prove to be a disadvantage. #Symbolic links are special files which, when encountered during pathname resolution, modify the pathname resolution to be taken to the location which the symbolic link contains. The content of the symbolic link is therefore the destination path string, which can also be examined using the command line utility. The symbolic link may contain an arbitrary string which does not refer to the location of an existing file. Such a symbolic link will fail until a file is created at the location which is contained by the symbolic link. By contrast, a symbolic link to an existing file will fail if the existing file is moved to a different location (or renamed). ==Specification == The utility on systems compliant with the Single Unix Specification is specified in the Shell and Utilities (XCU) document, which forms a part of the Single Unix Specification. A mostly identical document is part of POSIX. The specification describes two ways of invoking the utility. Specifically, ::In the \\"single file\\" invocation the utility creates a new hard link (directory entry) for the source file specified by the ' operand at the destination path specified by the ' operand. However, if the option is specified, a symbolic link is created. :: ln [-fs] [-L-P] source_file target_file ::In the \\"multiple file\\" invocation the utility creates a new hard link (directory entry), or if the option is specified, a symbolic link, for each file specified by the ' operand, at a destination path in an existing directory named by operand '. :: ln [-fs] [-L-P] source_file_1 source_file_2 ... target_dir The specification also specifies the command line options that must be supported: :: Force existing destination pathnames to be removed to allow the link. :: For each ' operand that names a file that is a symbolic link, create a hard link to the file referenced by the symbolic link. :: For each ' operand that names a file that is a symbolic link, create a (hard) link to the symbolic link itself. :: Create symbolic links instead of hard links. If the -s option is specified, the -L and -P options are silently ignored. ::If more than one of the mutually-exclusive options and is specified the last option specified determines the behavior of the utility. ::If the option is not specified and neither a nor a option is specified, the implementation defines which of the and options will be used as the default.

TVR1 has a total national coverage of 99.8% and TVR2 has 91% coverage--all of the other channels and networks cover only densely populated areas.

Starting November 2019, the two main channels, TVR 1 and TVR 2 broadcast fully in HD. ==History== ===Beginnings=== TVR was established in 1956, in Bucharest and had its first broadcast on 31 December from a little building (a deserted cinema studio) on Moli√®re Street no. 2. ===During the Ceau»ôescu era=== TVR moved in 1969 to a new building, the specially built television center on Doroban»õilor Avenue. It was designed by well-known architect Tiberiu Ricci. A second channel, TVR2, was created in 1968 (at that time it was simply called \\"Programul 2\\", the second channel and the old TVR became the first channel, \\"Programul 1\\"). TVR2 was suspended from 1985, due to the \\"energy saving programme\\" initiated by Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and TVR1 became TVR again, becoming the sole television station in Romania until the fall of communism in 1989. From 1966 to 1980, TVR had an open program policy. Many films, serials, cartoons and other programs from the US and Western Europe were broadcast on the two main channels. In 1983, TVR introduced color television. Although the rest of the Eastern Bloc countries adopted the Soviet-backed SECAM system, TVR chose to implement the PAL system. Plans to introduce color television broadcasting date as far back as 1968, when the TVR trialed color technology. It was, however, deemed too costly at the time to impose color broadcasting, and plans were shelved up to 1983. Even so, by 1990, only some broadcasts were in color and only few people owned a color TV set. Propaganda TV program from 1986, titled Nicolae Ceau»ôescu Era. Due to the same \\"energy saving programme\\" between 1985 and 1989, the TVR schedule was severely limited to only about two hours per day, between 20:00 and 22:00, most of which were dedicated to the cult of personalities of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu and his wife Elena; with an exception on Saturdays, from 13:00 to 15:00 and 19:00 to 22:30 and Sundays (the same program as Saturdays, but with children's programs between 11:30 and 12:30). The two hours of programming were half propaganda and half general entertainment: *19:53 The Socialist Republic of Romania National Anthem (\\"Trei culori\\") *19:57 The Frontul Democra»õiei »ôi UnitƒÉ»õii Socialiste (\\"Democracy and Socialist Unity Front\\", FDUS) Anthem (\\"E scris pe tricolor Unire\\") *19:59:30 Opening (clock) *20:00 News (\\"Telejurnal\\") *20:20 Special programs dedicated to Ceau»ôescu (documentary or musical shows) *21:00 An episode of theatre play, opera or a movie *21:50 News (\\"Telejurnal\\") *TVR headquarter Bucharest21:58 Closing (\\"Hora Unirii\\") In 1988 the programs increased to three hours per day during weekdays (from 19:00 to 22:00). The US TV series Dallas, introduced in the mid 1980s, became the only Western television program to be aired on the channel in color. Main building of the TVR in Bucharest at night (Nov 2006). ===After December 1989=== During the Revolution of December 1989, TVR was an important focal point of the events. Rebels occupied the TVR building, in the afternoon of 22 December and announced that the Ceau»ôescus had fled. TVR changed its name to \\"Televiziunea Rom√¢nƒÉ LiberƒÉ\\" (TVRL), \\"Free Romanian Television\\". On 17 February 1990, TVR2 resumed broadcasting and TVRL became TVR1. But TVR would remain a propaganda instrument in the hands of the newly created National Salvation Front (FSN), made up mostly of former second-rank Communists. FSN used TVRL, by far the most widely penetrating information source at that time in Romania, to discredit protesters who were demanding a Communist-free government, denigrating them as \\"fascists\\". This culminated with the June 1990 riots in central Bucharest, crushed by the miners called in by president Ion Iliescu. After the riots ended, Iliescu was shown on TV congratulating the miners for \\"restoring law and order\\". A little while later, following protests from civil society, TVRL abandoned the \\"L\\", the designation \\"Free\\" and reverted to its previous name of TVR. After 1990, lacking any strategy, TVR fell into a deep crisis of identity. TVR changed its identity several times without any particular reason. The crisis intensified after 1996. On 1 January 1993, TVR, as a part of Radioteleviziunea Rom√¢na (RTVR), was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union, simultaneously with the merger of OIRT and EBU. In 1995, TVRi was launched on 1 December, Great Union Day, the national holiday. In 1998, TVR International was renamed \\"TV Romania International\\", with a completely different identity. In 2001, TVR2 changed its identity, logo and presentation for the fourth time. The same year, after three \\"rebrandings\\", TVR1 became \\"TV Romania 1\\". The new \\"Romania 1\\" changed its identity, including the channel logo, three times in only two years. In 2002, TVR Cultural was launched. thumb In 2003, the management started a controversial rebranding (a new identity was created by the British agency, English & Pockett). On 11 June 2004, all channels were renamed \\"TVR\\" and received the same identity. On 2 December 2006, Romania hosted the international Junior Eurovision Song Contest. The Romanian broadcaster was chosen by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) to become the organizer of the 4th edition of the contest. In October 2007, during its prime-time newscast, TVR aired a video showing Agriculture Minister Decebal Traian Reme≈ü allegedly taking a bribe. In the aftermath, Prime Minister CƒÉlin Popescu-TƒÉriceanu criticised TVR for carrying out the minister's \\"public execution\\", and a heated debate that showed TVR's weakness in defending its independence ensued. The station's own director called the airing incorrect and illegal because it violated the presumption of innocence, while media organisations and the broadcast regulator defended the legitimacy of the airing, which they said served the public interest. Politicians issued intense attacks against TVR, which reorganised its news department into two divisions. One of its most critical journalists, Rodica Culcer, was placed in charge of supervising both divisions, which actually reduced her decision-making; reassignment has been a typical way through which Romanian governments reduce the power of non-loyal individuals, as more overt measures may have attracted charges of censorship. Other independent journalists were moved to afternoon or night newscasts.Pippa Norris, Public Sentinel: News Media & Governance Reform, p.269-70. World Bank Publications, 2010. . In August 2008, TVR acquired the broadcasting rights for the UEFA Champions League in Romania, for the following three seasons (between the 2009‚Äì10 and the 2011‚Äì12 season). From the 2012‚Äì13 season, it has the second option for the broadcasting rights. On 1 June 2008, TVR HD started broadcasting in HD. The Euro 2008 and the 2008 Summer Olympics were transmitted in HD. On 10 October 2008, TVR 3 was launched. This is a channel dedicated to local programming, airing shows and news produced in the various regions of Romania. On 31 December 2008, TVR Info, a \\"must-carry\\" channel for all cable operators, was launched. The channel broadcasts traffic information, live feeds from cameras in various cities of Romania, and news. On 19 April 2016, it was reported that Romania's participation in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 was in danger owing to TVR's repeated non-payment to the EBU of debts totaling CHF 16 million (‚Ç¨14.56 million, US$16.4 million) and dating back to January 2007. The EBU had issued a deadline to the Romanian government requiring it to make satisfactory arrangements to repay the debt by 20 April, or else face exclusion from the contest. Two days later it announced that, following the government's failure to meet the deadline, the EBU had withdrawn all member services from TVR: these included ‚Äì in addition to TVR's participation in the Song Contest ‚Äì access to the Eurovision News and Sports News Exchanges, the right to broadcast specific sporting events, and entitlement to benefit from the EBU's legal, technical, research, expertise, and lobbying services. ==Structure== TVR has four national TV channels: TVR1, TVR2, TVR3 & TVRi. TVRi is designed for the Romanians living abroad, the \\"i\\" coming from International (Interna»õional in Romanian). Due to the financial crisis in which TVR is immersed, TVR Cultural and TVR Info closed in the summer of 2012, however the latter was replaced by TVR News three months later. Nevertheless, on 21 July 2015 the TVR board decided to shut down also the TVR News channel, which stopped broadcasting on 1 August 2015. It also has six regional TV channels or \\"studios\\" (\\"studiouri teritoriale\\"): TVR Bucure»ôti, TVR Cluj, TVR Craiova, TVR Ia»ôi, TVR T√¢rgu Mure»ô and TVR Timi»ôoara. TVR HD was available form 2008 to 2019 when it was closed due to TVR 1 & TVR 2 having HD broadcasts. TVR Moldova broadcasts in Moldova from the local Chi»ôinƒÉu studio. ==Funding and accusations== Until 2017 TVR was funded by a television licence tax mandatory for all holders of TV sets and also from advertising. This has been deemed unfair competition by the commercial TV stations, which must rely exclusively on revenue from advertisement and cable operators. After removing the 6,5 lei tax, TVR is mainly funded directly by the government. TVR's board is appointed by the Government and the Parliament. In its post-Communist history, TVR has been almost constantly suspected of submitting to government control and censorship. ==References== ==External links== * TVR official website * Six TVR journalists accuse censorship (Ziua, 8 December 2004) Category:European Broadcasting Union members Category:Television channels and stations established in 1956 Category:1956 establishments in Romania Category:Mass media companies established in 1956 Category:Mass media in Romania Category:Television networks in Romania Category:Publicly funded broadcasters Category:Government-owned companies of Romania ","title":"Romanian Television"},{"id":"305656","text":"Romanian television may refer to: * Communications media in Romania * Televiziunea Rom√¢nƒÉ, TVR, the national television network * List of Romanian- language television channels ","title":"Romanian television"},{"id":"305658","text":"Mineral is an American emo band originally from Houston, Texas.

The Frisian settlers on the coast of South Jutland (today's Northern Friesland) also spoke Old Frisian but no medieval texts of this area are known. The language of the earlier inhabitants of the region between the Zuiderzee and Ems River (the Frisians mentioned by Tacitus) is attested in only a few personal names and place-names. Old Frisian evolved into Middle Frisian, spoken from the 16th to the 19th century. In the early Middle Ages, Frisia stretched from the area around Bruges, in what is now Belgium, to the Weser River in northern Germany . At the time, the Frisian language was spoken along the entire southern North Sea coast. This region is referred to as Greater Frisia or Frisia Magna, and many of the areas within it still treasure their Frisian heritage. However, by 1300, their territory had been pushed back to the Zuiderzee (now the IJsselmeer), and the Frisian language survives along the coast only as a substrate. A close relationship exists between Old Frisian and Old English; this is due to a shared history, language and culture of the people from Northern Germany and Denmark who came to settle in England from around 400AD onwards. ==Phonology== ===Early sound developments=== The Codex Roorda is a medieval document with Latin and Old Frisian law texts. Generally, Old Frisian phonologically resembles Old English. In particular, it shares the palatalisation of velar consonants also found in Old English. For example, whereas the closely related Old Saxon and Old Dutch retain the velar in dag, Old Frisian has dei and Old English has d√¶ƒ° . When followed by front vowels the Germanic changed to a sound. The Old Frisian for church was tzirke or tzerke, in Old English it was ƒãiriƒãe , while Old Saxon and Old Dutch have the unpalatalised kirika. Another feature shared between the two is Anglo-Frisian brightening, which fronted a to ' under some circumstances. In unstressed syllables, o merges into a, and i into e as in Old English. The old Germanic diphthongs *ai and *au become ƒì/ƒÅ and ƒÅ, respectively, in Old Frisian, as in ƒìn/ƒÅn (\\"one\\") from Proto-Germanic *ainaz, and brƒÅd from *braudƒÖ (\\"bread\\"). In comparison, these diphthongs become ƒÅ and ƒìa (ƒÅn and brƒìad) in Old English, and ƒì and ≈ç (ƒìn and br≈çd) in Old Saxon. The diphthong *eu generally becomes ia, and Germanic *iu is retained. These diphthongs initially began with a syllabic (stressed) i, but the stress later shifts to the second component, giving to iƒÅ and i≈´. For example, thiƒÅd (\\"people\\") and li≈´de from Proto- Germanic *√æeud≈ç and *liudƒ´z. Between vowels, h generally disappears (sian from *sehwanƒÖ), as in Old English and Old Dutch. Word-initial h- on the other hand is retained. Old Frisian retains th in all positions for longer than Old Dutch and Old Saxon do, showing the gradual spread of the shift from th to d from south to north, beginning in southern Germany in the 9th century as part of the High German consonant shift, but not reaching Frisian until the 13th or 14th century. ==Grammar== Old Frisian (c. 1150-c. 1550) retained grammatical cases. Some of the texts that are preserved from this period are from the 12th or 13th centuries, but most are from the 14th and 15th centuries. Generally, all these texts are restricted to legal writings. Although the earliest written examples of Frisian‚Äîstray words in a Latin context‚Äîare from approximately the 9th century, there are a few examples of runic inscriptions from the region which are older and in a very early form of the Frisian language. These runic writings however usually consist of no more than inscriptions of a single or few words. ==Corpus== There are some early Frisian names preserved in Latin texts, and some runic (Futhorc) inscriptions, but the oldest surviving texts in Old Frisian date from the 13th century, in particular official and legal documents. They show a considerable degree of linguistic uniformity. * Westeremden yew-stick (c. 750-900) * Fon Alra Fresena Fridome (at TITUS: TITUS) * Ten Commandements (TITUS) * 17 petitiones (TITUS) * Londriucht (TITUS) * Thet Freske Riim (TITUS, ed.

The Act required \\"local bodies to provide living and dwelling conditions which will foster social cohesion and enable conditions of segregation to be avoided.\\" The Cresson Government also placed considerable emphasis during its time in office on facilitating the international competitiveness of firms with under 500 employees. A law was passed in July 1991 which included several measures aimed at improving access of people with disabilities to housing, work places, and public buildings.

On 31 December 1997, Berthelot requested the termination of his contract on medical grounds, and his application was accepted. A complaint was made by a member of parliament, and a criminal investigation concerning Berthelot was opened in Belgium in 1999. In June 2004, the Chambre du conseil of the Tribunal de premi√®re instance de Bruxelles (Court of First Instance, Brussels) decided that no further action should be taken in the case. === European Commission vs. √âdith Cresson === On 11 July 2006, in a judgment by the European Court of Justice on Case C-432/04 (Commission of the European Communities versus √âdith Cresson), the Court declared that √âdith Cresson acted in breach of her obligations as a European Commissioner. While the breach of the obligations arising from the office of Member of the Commission calls, in principle, for the imposition of a penalty, the Court held that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, the finding of breach constituted, of itself, an appropriate penalty and, accordingly, decided not to impose on Cresson a penalty in the form of a deprivation of her right to a pension or other benefits.See European Commission, Judgment of the Court of Justice in Case C-432/04 11 July 2006\\"Edith Cresson charged with fraud\\" The Guardian 25 March 2003\\"Court rules against ex-French PM Edith Cresson: Willing to extend benefits to personal friends The EU's top court has ruled that Edith Cresson, the former European commissioner and French prime minister, violated her official duties\\" BBC News 11 July 2006, Cresson claimed that where the conduct complained of in criminal and disciplinary proceedings was the same, the findings of the criminal court were binding on the disciplinary authorities. However, the Court held that it was not bound by the legal characterisation of facts made in the context of the criminal proceedings and that it was for the Court, exercising its discretion to the full, to investigate whether the conduct complained of in proceedings brought under Article 213(2) EC constituted a breach of the obligations arising from the office of Commissioner. Accordingly, the decision of the Chambre du conseil of the Tribunal de premi√®re instance de Bruxelles that there was no evidence of criminal conduct on Cresson's part could not bind the Court. ==Political career== European Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science, 1995‚Äì1999.

The percentages of body water contained in various fluid compartments add up to total body water (TBW). This water makes up a significant fraction of the human body, both by weight and by volume. Ensuring the right amount of body water is part of fluid balance, an aspect of homeostasis. ==Location== By weight, the average human adult male is approximately 60-63% water, and the average adult female is approximately 52-55% water. There can be considerable variation in body water percentage based on a number of factors like age, health, water intake, weight, and sex. In a large study of adults of all ages and both sexes, the adult human body averaged ~65% water. However, this varied substantially by age, sex, and adiposity (amount of fat in body composition). The figure for water fraction by weight in this sample found to be 58 ¬±8% water for males and 48 ¬±6% for females. The body water constitutes as much as 75% of the body weight of a newborn infant, whereas some obese people are as little as 45% water by weight. This is due to how fat tissue does not retain water as well as lean tissue. These statistical averages will vary with factors such as type of population, age of people sampled, number of people sampled, and methodology. So there is not, and cannot be, a figure that is exactly the same for all people, for this or any other physiological measure. Most of animal body water is contained in various body fluids. These include intracellular fluid; extracellular fluid; plasma; interstitial fluid; and transcellular fluid. Water is also contained inside organs, in gastrointestinal, cerebrospinal, peritoneal, and ocular fluids. Adipose tissue contains about 10% of water, while muscle tissue contains about 75%. In Netter's Atlas of Human Physiology, body water is broken down into the following compartments: * Intracellular fluid (2/3 of body water) is fluid contained within cells. In a 72-kg body containing 40 litres of fluid, about 25 litres is intracellular, which amounts to 62.5%. Jackson's texts states 70% of body fluid is intracellular. * Extracellular fluid (1/3 of body water) is fluid contained in areas outside of cells. For a 40-litre body, about 15 litres is extracellular, which amounts to 37.5%. ** Plasma (1/5 of extracellular fluid). Of this 15 litres of extracellular fluid, plasma volume averages 3 litres, or 20%. ** Interstitial fluid (4/5 of extracellular fluid) ** Transcellular fluid (a.k.a. \\"third space,\\" normally ignored in calculations) contained inside organs, such as the gastrointestinal, cerebrospinal, peritoneal, and ocular fluids. ==Measurement== ===Dilution and equilibration=== Total body water can be determined using Flowing afterglow mass spectrometry measurement of deuterium abundance in breath samples from individuals. A known dose of deuterated water (Heavy water, D2O) is ingested and allowed to equilibrate within the body water. The FA-MS instrument then measures the deuterium-to-hydrogen (D:H) ratio in the exhaled breath water vapour. The total body water is then accurately measured from the increase in breath deuterium content in relation to the volume of D2O ingested. Different substances can be used to measure different fluid compartments: * total body water: tritiated water or heavy water. * extracellular fluid: inulin * blood plasma: Evans blue Intracellular fluid may then be estimated by subtracting extracellular fluid from total body water. ===Bioelectrical impedance analysis=== Another method of determining total body water percentage (TBW%) is via Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). In the traditional BIA method, a person lies on a cot and spot electrodes are placed on the hands and bare feet. Electrolyte gel is applied first, and then a weak current of frequency 50kHz is introduced. This AC waveform allows the creation of a current inside the body via the very capacitive skin without causing a DC flow or burns, and limited in the ~20mA range current for safety. BIA has emerged as a promising technique because of its simplicity, low cost, high reproducibility and noninvasiveness. BIA prediction equations can be either generalized or population-specific, allowing this method to be potentially very accurate. Selecting the appropriate equation is important to determining the quality of the results. For clinical purposes, scientists are developing a multi- frequency BIA method that may further improve the method's ability to predict a person's hydration level. New segmental BIA equipment that uses more electrodes may lead to more precise measurements of specific parts of the body. == Calculation == In humans, total body water can be estimated based on the premorbid (or ideal) body weight and correction factor. TBW = weight * C C is a coefficient for the expected percentage of weight made up of free water. For adult, non-elderly males, C = 0.6. For adult elderly males, malnourished males, or females, C = 0.5. For adult elderly or malnourished females C = 0.45. A total body water deficit (TBWD) can then be approximated by the following formula: TBWD=TBW*(1-\\\\frac{[Na]t}{[Na]m}) Where [Na]t = target sodium concentration (usually 140 mEq/L), and [Na]m = measured sodium concentration. The resultant value is the approximate volume of free water required to correct a hypernatremic state. In practice, the value rarely approximates the actual amount of free water required to correct a deficit due to insensible losses, urinary output, and differences in water distribution among patients. == Functions == Water in the animal body performs a number of functions: as a solvent for transportation of nutrients; as a medium for excretion; a means for heat control; as a lubricant for joints; and for shock absorption. ==Changes== The usual way of adding water to a body is by drinking. Water also enters the body with foods, especially those rich in water, such as plants, raw meat, and fish. The amount of this water that is retained in animals is affected by several factors. Water amounts vary with the age of the animal. The older the vertebrate animal, the higher its relative bone mass and the lower its body water content. In diseased states, where body water is affected, the fluid compartment or compartments that have changed can give clues to the nature of the problem, or problems. Body water is regulated by hormones, including anti-diuretic hormone, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide. === Loss of water === Volume contraction is a decrease in body fluid volume, with or without a concomitant loss of osmolytes. The loss of the body water component of body fluid is specifically termed dehydration.MedicineNet > Definition of Dehydration Retrieved on July 2, 2009 Sodium loss approximately correlates with fluid loss from extracellular fluid, since sodium has a much higher concentration in extracelluliar fluid (ECF) than intracellular fluid (ICF). In contrast, K+ has a much higher concentration in ICF than ECF, and therefore its loss rather correlates with fluid loss from ICF, since K+ loss from ECF causes the K+ in ICF to diffuse out of the cells, dragging water with it by osmosis. ==References== ==Further reading== *Fluid, Electrolyte, and Acid-Base Disorders in Small Animal Practice *Essentials of Animal Physiology *The Encyclopedia of Farm Animal Nutrition *Animal Osmoregulation *Animal Nutrition Science ==External links== * * Category:Human body de:K√∂rperwasser ","title":"Body water"},{"id":"305684","text":"Cryptopsy is a Canadian technical death metal band from Montreal, formed in 1988. ==History== ===Necrosis (1988‚Äì1992)=== Necrosis was formed in April 1988 by drummer Mike Atkin, guitarist Steve Thibault and vocalist Dan Greening, initially under the name Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. John Todds later joined on bass. The band released several demos, including Mastication and Heterodontism (1989), Realms Of Pathogenia (1991) and Necrosis (1992). Atkin left the band to continue more into the Speed metal/Thrash direction, and was replaced by Flo Mounier, at which time the band changed their name to \\"Cryptopsy\\". Todds left shortly thereafter, retiring from music to focus on his family; he was replaced by Kevin Weagle; Dave Galea also joined the band. ===Blasphemy Made Flesh (1993‚Äì1995)=== In 1993, Cryptopsy released their debut demo, Ungentle Exhumation. This demo caught the attention of local label Gore Records, which re-released the demo and, for a brief period, managed the band. The demo garnered attention in the Canadian Death metal underground, as well as from the German label Invasion Records. By 1994, bassist Kevin Weagle had been replaced by Martin Fergusson, and Dave Galea was replaced by lead guitarist Jon Levasseur. This line-up recorded their debut album, Blasphemy Made Flesh, which at first was independently released and later licensed to Invasion Records. The album gained them a wide following in the Canadian underground. Due to financial problems of Invasion Records, Cryptopsy was left without a label to support their tour, but the album would be picked up by Dutch label Displeased Records. After successfully touring in support of Blasphemy Made Flesh, Steve Thibault left the band. Bassist Martin Fergusson was replaced by Eric Langlois. The addition of Langlois incorporated funk- style bass slaps into the Cryptopsy sound. ===None So Vile (1996‚Äì1997)=== In 1996, the line-up of Lord Worm, Flo Mounier, Jon Levasseur, and Eric Langlois released the album None So Vile on the Swedish label Wrong Again Records. This album took the extreme and technical elements further and is now considered a benchmark of brutal death metal. By this time, Levasseur was a very prominent songwriter in the band. His guitar leads consisted of very fast yet complex shreds, which were usually played in short bursts. Although Levasseur handled all the guitar parts on the album, the band would add Miguel Roy as a second touring guitarist. In 1997, after the tour in support of None So Vile, Lord Worm left the band, citing health issues. The band hired the Boston native Mike DiSalvo, vocalist of death metal band Infestation, (with the personal approval of Lord Worm). In July 1997, Cryptopsy's appearance at the Milwaukee Metalfest XI gained the attention of many American metalheads, as well as that of the label Century Media. ===Whisper Supremacy (1998‚Äì1999)=== Cryptopsy's next album, Whisper Supremacy, was released on Century Media in 1998, and featured Miguel Roy on second guitar. It took Cryptopsy's style further, incorporating some jazz and fusion elements. Some fans criticized Mike DiSalvo's vocal style, saying it was too similar to that of hardcore vocalists and preferring the more extreme death metal style of Lord Worm; others welcomed DiSalvo's intelligible lyrics and vocal presence. The tour in support of Whisper Supremacy took the band on their first tour through the United States, increasing their fan-base significantly. ===‚Ä¶And Then You'll Beg (2001‚Äì2002)=== Cryptopsy released their fourth studio effort, ‚Ä¶And Then You'll Beg, in 2001. The album featured a new guitarist, Alex Auburn, who replaced Miguel Roy. And Then You'll Beg was viewed as being less extreme than Cryptopsy's previous albums. The album also incorporated even more progressive elements and was considered to be very technical and experimental. After the first portion of the supporting tour, Mike DiSalvo departed the band. Martin LaCroix took over the position as singer for the European and Japanese tours. His style was viewed as being in between the styles of Lord Worm and Mike DiSalvo. ===None So Live (2002‚Äì2004)=== In June 2001, Cryptopsy played their first concert in their hometown of Montreal in four years and attracted an audience of more than 2,000. The concert was recorded and, in 2003, released as a live album, None So Live. This release was LaCroix's only contribution to Cryptopsy's discography; he was not fluent enough in English to write lyrics on the same level as his predecessors. Lord Worm rejoined the band and through summer 2004, Cryptopsy played shows in the Montreal area, and began a full Canadian tour in September, with former guitarist Miguel Roy filling in for the unavailable Jon Levasseur. In October, Martyr and former Gorguts guitarist Dan Mongrain took over second guitar duties for the live dates. The setlist for this tour began with the entire None So Vile album, followed by songs from Blasphemy Made Flesh and Whisper Supremacy. The Canada 2004 tour ended at Cryptopsy's performance on November 6 at the Trois-Rivieres Metalfest IV, which was filmed for a live DVD. The DVD Live at Trois-Rivieres Metalfest IV was released in 2005. ===Once Was Not (2005‚Äì2006)=== On January 31, 2005, Jon Levasseur announced that he had lost interest in extreme music and amicably departed Cryptopsy. Dan Mongrain remained on guitar duties for the Back to the Worms tour through the United States from February to May. After the tour's completion Mongrain also departed in order to continue his work with Martyr. It was then announced that Cryptopsy's next album, Once Was Not, would be released on October 18, 2005. The album features original vocalist Lord Worm, Flo Mounier, Eric Langlois, and Alex Auburn handling all guitar duties except the intro track \\"Luminum\\". On September 28 it was announced that the new touring guitarist would be Christian Donaldson of Mythosis. The band toured North America with Suffocation, Despised Icon, and Aborted. After a break, and the release of Flo Mounier's instructional drumming DVD Extreme Metal Drumming 101, the band toured Europe with Grave, Aborted, Dew-Scented, and others, then toured America and Australia. Following their second tour of Europe, UK, and Scandinavia, guitarist Christian Donaldson became a permanent member of the band. ===The Unspoken King (2007‚Äì2011)=== The new album was originally to be called The Book of Suffering, and was to be a double album, but on April 23, 2007, Cryptopsy announced that Lord Worm had been fired from the band and that they were looking for a new vocalist. After the announcement, Lord Worm stated that he left the group earlier than planned for health reasons, which contradicted the band's statement that he was kicked out. Lord Worm also stated that there were creative differences with the other band members over the direction the band would eventually take on their subsequent studio outing. On December 4, 2007, Cryptopsy revealed the addition of vocalist Matt McGachy, of fellow Montreal heavy metal band 3 Mile Scream; and a new keyboard player, Maggy Durand. The band released a new studio album, The Unspoken King, on June 24, 2008. This album saw the inclusion of previously-unheard elements such as breakdowns and melodic riffs. The album has been widely regarded as being a deathcore release instead of the band's usual technical death metal style, and as such was met with a mixed-to-negative reaction from both fans and critics. In early February 2009, guitarist Alex Auburn announced his departure from the band, saying that there were numerous reasons for his leaving, and that he and the rest of the band agreed with the departure. ===Cryptopsy, The Book of Suffering - Tome I and II (2011‚Äìpresent)=== On May 25, 2011, the band announced on their Facebook page that former lead guitarist and major contributor Jon Levasseur had returned to the band. Additionally, bassist Eric Langlois decided to take a break from Cryptopsy, and Youri Raymond took his place on bass. On December 9, 2011, Raymond announced his departure from the band. On January 15, 2012, Cryptopsy announced that Olivier Pinard, from Neuraxis and Vengeful, would be the new bassist. On September 14, 2012, Cryptopsy released Cryptopsy, which turned away from the experimentation witnessed on The Unspoken King, in favour of a more technical death metal sound. On May 8, 2015, it was announced that Cryptopsy would release The Book of Suffering - Tome I in mid-2015, the first in a series of EPs. An Indiegogo campaign was launched the same day. Regarding the recording process, it was stated that Jason Suecof would handle mixing duties, while Alan Douches would handle the mastering process. On August 31, 2018, the band announced the second part of The Book of Suffering on their Facebook page. Pre-sales of the EP began on the 7th of September along with a music video of their new song \\"Sire of Sin\\", which was to appear on Tome II. The EP was released on October 26. ==Members== === Current === * Flo Mounier ‚Äì drums, backing vocals (1992‚Äìpresent) * Christian Donaldson ‚Äì guitars (2005‚Äìpresent) * Matt McGachy ‚Äì lead vocals (2007‚Äìpresent) * Olivier Pinard ‚Äì bass (2012‚Äìpresent) ===Former members=== Vocals * Lord Worm ‚Äì lead vocals (1992‚Äì1997, 2003‚Äì2007) (ex-Rage Nucl√©aire, ex-Necrosis) * Mike DiSalvo ‚Äì lead vocals (1997‚Äì2001) (Coma Cluster Void, Akurion, Conflux, ex-Infestation, ex-Mabbus) * Martin Lacroix ‚Äì lead vocals (2001‚Äì2003) (ex-Serocs, ex-Spasme) Lead guitar * Dave Galea ‚Äì lead guitar (1992‚Äì1993) * Jon Levasseur ‚Äì lead guitar (1993‚Äì2005, 2011‚Äì2012) Jon Levasseur live in Austin Texas * Miguel Roy ‚Äì lead guitar (2004 touring) * Daniel Mongrain ‚Äì lead guitar (2004-2005 touring) Rhythm guitar * Steve Thibault ‚Äì rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1992‚Äì1995) * Miguel Roy ‚Äì rhythm guitar (1995‚Äì1998) * Alex Auburn ‚Äì rhythm guitar, co-lead vocals (1999‚Äì2009) * Youri Raymond ‚Äì rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2009‚Äì2011) Bass * Kevin Weagle ‚Äì bass (1992‚Äì1994) * Martin Fergusson ‚Äì bass (1994) * Eric Langlois ‚Äì bass (1995‚Äì2011) * Youri Raymond ‚Äì bass, backing vocals (2011) * Dominic Grimard ‚Äì bass (2018-2019) Keyboards * Maggy Durand ‚Äì keyboards (2007‚Äì2008) ===Timeline=== == Discography == ===Studio albums=== *Blasphemy Made Flesh (1994) *None So Vile (1996) *Whisper Supremacy (1998) *...And Then You'll Beg (2001) *Once Was Not (2005) *The Unspoken King (2008) *Cryptopsy (2012) ===EPs=== *The Book of Suffering ‚Äì Tome I (2015) *The Book of Suffering ‚Äì Tome II (2018) ===Live albums=== *None So Live (2003) ;Demos *Ungentle Exhumation (1993) ;Compilations *The Best of Us Bleed (2012) ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Official Facebook page * Official Cryptopsy Merch on IFmerch.com * [ Cryptopsy biography] at AllMusic * * * MTV News article about the band's new record * Interview with Flo Mounier on Chronicles of Chaos * Interview with Flo Mounier on Morgzine (ukraine) * Gear talk with Jon Levasseur ‚Äì Former lead guitarist Category:Canadian death metal musical groups Category:Canadian technical death metal musical groups Category:Deathcore musical groups Category:Musical groups from Montreal Category:Musical groups established in 1988 Category:Musical quintets Category:Century Media Records artists Category:1988 establishments in Quebec ","title":"Cryptopsy"},{"id":"305692","text":"Captain Arthur Wakefield (19 November 1799 ‚Äì 17 June 1843) served with the Royal Navy, before joining his brother, Edward Gibbon Wakefield, in founding the new settlement at Nelson, New Zealand. ==Early Life== Arthur Wakefield was born in Essex, a son of Edward Wakefield (1774‚Äì1854), a distinguished surveyor and land agent, and Susanna Crash (1767‚Äì1816). His grandmother, Priscilla Wakefield (1751‚Äì1832), was a popular author for the young, and one of the introducers of savings banks. He was the brother of Catherine Gurney Wakefield (1793-1873), Edward Gibbon Wakefield (1796‚Äì1862), Daniel Bell Wakefield (1798‚Äì1858), William Hayward Wakefield (1801‚Äì1848), John Howard Wakefield (1803‚Äì1862), Felix Wakefield (1807‚Äì1875), Priscilla Susannah Wakefield (1809‚Äì1887), Percy Wakefield (1810‚Äì1832), and an unnamed child born in 1813. ==Royal Navy== He joined the Royal Navy at age eleven. He saw action in the Dutch East Indies, and was part of the force that captured and burnt Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812. He took part in the bombardment of Algiers. In the post-Napoleonic period he was stationed off South America, involved in diplomatic duties during the various wars of independence. He then spent several years off the coast of West Africa as part of the flotilla engaged in the suppression of the slave trade. He also saw duty in the North Atlantic, the West Indies and the Mediterranean Sea. He was eventually given command of his own ship, the steam frigate . However, in 1837 he was passed over for promotion, so, recognising that his career was going nowhere, he resigned from the Navy in 1841. ==New Zealand Company== Immediately after Arthur Wakefield left the Navy in 1841, his brother, Edward Gibbon Wakefield recruited him to join the New Zealand Company, tasking him to select settlers for a new settlement to be named Nelson, escort the party to New Zealand, and supervise the growth of the new town. Arthur Wakefield sailed from London on the Whitby in April 1841 and reached Wellington in September 1841. The first immigrant ships arrived in Nelson in February 1842. The settlement of Nelson got off to a good start. In the first two years, 18 ships transported more than 3,000 colonists. Captain Wakefield actively worked to promote the orderly development of the colony. Although he seems to have been rather paternal in his attitude to the settlers, he also seems to have been respected and admired. However, the new colony encountered serious difficulties in subsequent months. The biggest problem was the lack of arable land. The New Zealand Company, and particularly Wakefield's brother, had made extravagant promises to the settlers about the availability of land. Each settler family had been offered 1 acre (4,000 m¬≤) of urban land, 50 acres (200,000 m¬≤) of suburban land, and 150 acres (600,000 m¬≤) of rural land. However, the company had nothing like that amount of land available and the existing owners ‚Äì the native MƒÅori ‚Äì proved very reluctant to sell their land and not inclined to trust the New Zealand Company's promises. Furthermore, the newly established British government of William Hobson in Auckland was not at all sympathetic to their problems. One of the basic tenets of the Treaty of Waitangi (1840), between the British Crown and various MƒÅori chiefs, was the understanding that the Crown would protect the MƒÅori from attempts to defraud them of their land. On the other hand, some members of the New Zealand Company and many of the settlers saw the MƒÅori as ignorant savages who had no right to stand in the way of honest British colonists. This was a period when the growing British Empire was very aware of what it saw as its manifest destiny, to rule the native peoples of the world. The British colonists believed they were owed the land, and resented the fact that their survival was dependent on the goodwill of the MƒÅori, who held all the power. In summary, Arthur Wakefield found he had far more settlers than he had land for and they were not happy. For once, Edward Gibbon Wakefield urged caution, but he was in London and his brother Arthur was the man on the spot. ==Death== The Chief Magistrate in Nelson, Henry Thompson, was a very hot-tempered, arrogant man who was not prepared to accept that the Nelson settlement did not own and control the Wairau Plains. Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata visited Nelson and made it very clear that they would not allow the settlers to occupy the Wairau Plain. Despite that, Wakefield and Thompson sent out surveyors. The MƒÅori very firmly, but without violence, escorted them off their land and burnt down their hut. Thompson immediately issued a warrant for the arrest of the two chiefs on a charge of arson. He and Wakefield then recruited a group of special constables and led them off to carry out the arrest. The result was the Wairau Affray, in which Arthur Wakefield and 21 other of the party were killed by the MƒÅori. It is difficult to apportion the blame for this disaster. Henry Thompson appears to have been the driving force behind the attempt to arrest Te Rauparaha and he already had a reputation for headstrong, irrational impulses. But Wakefield was supposed to be in command of the settlement. His brother had told him that the claim to the land was invalid. It seems that he yielded to the pressures and expectations of the people around him and particularly to Thompson. It is still unknown as to what initiated the incident at Wairau yet Wakefield, Thompson and seven other settlers surrendered during the clash and were summarily executed on the orders of Chief Te Rangihaeata who was enraged and demanded utu (revenge) for the death of his wife Rongo, Te Rauparaha's daughter, who had been shot in the affray. It is claimed that his head was laid on a loaf of bread as a final insult, echoing his arrogant quote that he could buy the Maori with \\"sugar and bread\\". The subsequent government inquiry found the whole expedition had been illegal and exonerated the MƒÅori. This did not sit well with the colonists, who immediately began a political campaign against Governor Robert FitzRoy that contributed to his early recall. ==Commemoration== Mount Arthur Nelson is now a thriving city. The community of Wakefield south of Nelson is not believed to be named after him, but it was renamed shortly before his death. The Wairau Affray is believed to have assisted in the new name becoming established. The Arthur Range in what is now Kahurangi National Park was explored by Arthur Dudley Dobson, and the range and Mount Arthur were named by Dobson after Arthur Wakefield. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1799 births Category:1843 deaths Category:People of the New Zealand Wars Category:Royal Navy personnel of the War of 1812 Arthur ","title":"Arthur Wakefield"},{"id":"305693","text":"Flicker may refer to: * Flickers, woodpeckers of the subgenus Colaptes * Flicker (screen), a change in brightness between frames that occurs on a cathode-ray screen at low refresh rates * Flicker (light), is a directly visible change in brightness of a light source * Power-line flicker, a fluctuation in the voltage of AC power lines, whose compliance is regulated by IEC61000-3-3 * Flicker noise, electrical noise with a 1/f spectrum. * Flicker, a guitar tremolo made by ESP Guitars in the late 1970s and early 1980s People * Tal Flicker (born 1992), Israeli judoka * Theodore Flicker (1930‚Äì2014), American playwright * Yuval Flicker, (born 1955), American mathematician Popular culture * Flicker, the sophomore album by Ayria * Flicker, the original bass guitarist for the band Manic Street Preachers * Flicker, a character in the cartoon and video game Blazing Dragons * Flicker (novel), a book by Theodore Roszak * Flicker, a candle maker transformed into a candle man appearing in The Ice King of Oz and subsequent books by Eric Shanower. * Flicker, a 1973 pinball table made by Bally * Flicker Film Festival, an ongoing film series featuring Super 8 and 16mm short films * Flicker Records, a record label belonging to Sony * Flicker (album), the debut studio album by Niall Horan, or its title track * The Flicker, an experimental film created in 1965 by Tony Conrad * Flicker (film), a 2008 Canadian film * \\"Flicker\\" (song), a song by Porter Robinson from the album Worlds Slang * A remote control device (especially for televisions) * A flyswatter ==See also== * Flecker, a surname * Flicka, a 2006 film based on the book My Friend Flicka * Flick (disambiguation) * Flickr, a digital photo sharing website and service ","title":"Flicker"},{"id":"305695","text":"Kissinger Associates, Inc. is a New York City-based international geopolitical consulting firm, founded and run by Henry Kissinger since 1982.

However, over time details from proxy statements and the tendency of senior businessmen to talk about their relationship with Kissinger have leaked out and a number of major corporate clients have been identified.Isaacson, Kissinger: A Biography, pp.730-751. The secrecy of their corporate client list has caused problems where Kissinger or a member of his staff were called to public service. In 1989, George H. W. Bush nominated Lawrence Eagleburger as his Deputy Secretary of State. Congress required that Eagleburger disclose the names of 16 clients, some of which were his through his Kissinger Associates affiliation. Later, Kissinger himself was appointed chairman of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States by George W. Bush. Congressional Democrats insisted that Kissinger disclose the names of clients.

These three families of small mammals have traditionally been considered to be a part of the order Insectivora, and were later included in Lipotyphla after Insectivora was abandoned as a wastebasket taxon, before Lipotyphla was also found to be polyphyletic. ==Naming== Some biologists use Tenrecomorpha as the name for the tenrec-golden mole clade, but Gary Bronner and Paulina Jenkins argue that Afrosoricida is more appropriate, despite their misgivings about the similarity between the name \\"Afrosoricida\\" and the unrelated shrew subgenus Afrosorex. However, Afrosorex Hutterer, 1986 is a synonym of Crocidura Wagler, 1832, eliminating any confusion. ==Biology== As a rule, tenrecs and otter shrews tend to be small animals varying from 4 cm to 39 cm in length. There is no pronounced body type since they have evolved to take over the insect-eating niche in Madagascar. However, based on the niche occupied, they look like shrews, hedgehogs or otters. Their coat can vary from smooth to spiny and the coloration of the fur is generally dirt brown. Most species are also nocturnal and have poor eyesight. However, their whiskers are rather sensitive and they can detect very minute vibrations in the ground to locate their prey. ==Phylogeny== Traditionally, these two families were grouped with the hedgehogs, shrews and moles in the Lipotyphla. However, there have always been minority opinions suggesting that Tenrecomorpha, or at least the golden moles, are not true lipotyphlans. These opinions are now supported by many genetic studies indicating an association between Tenrecomorpha and various other African mammals in the superorder Afrotheria.

(2004). The ROM Field Guide to Wildflowers of Ontario. Toronto:Royal Ontario Museum, p.270. blue-pod lupine, or, primarily in cultivation, garden lupin) is a species of lupine (lupin) native to western North America from southern Alaska and British Columbia east to Quebec, and western Wyoming, and south to Utah and California. It commonly grows along streams and creeks, preferring moist habitats. It is a perennial herbaceous plant with stout stems growing to tall. The leaves are palmately compound with (5-) 9-17 leaflets long. The flowers are produced on a tall spike, each flower long, most commonly blue to purple in wild plants. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees. The polyphyllus variety in particular make up a great number of the hybrids which are generally grown as garden lupines, they can vary dramatically in colours. The majority of lupines do not thrive in rich heavy soils, and often only live for a matter of years if grown in such places, because crown contact with manure or rich organic matter encourages rotting. This lupine may represent a significant threat to the survival of the endangered Karner blue butterfly, due to its ease of hybridization with the Karner's food plant, Lupinus perennis, the sundial lupine. Some sources argue that much commercial sundial lupine seed is already questionable for the Karner due to hybridization. Additionally, incompatible lupines continue to be introduced by humans into places where the Karner lives or once lived. There are five varieties: *Lupinus polyphyllus var. burkei ‚Äì Interior northwestern United States *Lupinus polyphyllus var. humicola ‚Äì Interior western North America *Lupinus polyphyllus var. pallidipes ‚Äì Western Oregon and Washington (Willamette Valley) *Lupinus polyphyllus var. polyphyllus ‚Äì Coastal western North America *Lupinus polyphyllus var. prunophilus ‚Äì Interior western North America The species epithet polyphyllus means \\"many-leaved\\", from Ancient Greek () \\"many\\" and () \\"leaf\\". Close-up of a Russell hybrid lupine in a typical garden setting in England ==Russell hybrids== Macro shot of a Lupinus polyphyllus The herbaceous lupine, Lupinus polyphyllus, arrived in Britain from North America in the 1820s, brought over by David Douglas. Almost a century later, George Russell, a horticulturist from York, UK, started to breed the (later famous) Russell hybrids (Lupinus X russellii hort). Lupinus polphyllus originally were of basic colours and had large gaps in the flowering spike. Without the use of modern-day plant breeding techniques, Russell took to ruthlessly pulling out any plants which he deemed to be unacceptable in growth or display. He spent two decades single-handedly trying to breed the perfect lupine, crossing L. polyphyllus with L. arboreus, L. sulphureus and one or more annual species (maybe L. nootkatensis). Over the decades, the plants he selected developed flower spikes that were denser, larger, and more colourful than the original Lupinus polyphyllus. His work may have gone unrecognised if he had not been encouraged by nurseryman James Baker to show the plants to the public. It is understood the pair worked together for several years to perfect the Russell Hybrid, before they were displayed at the Royal Horticultural Society's June show in 1937, where their brightly coloured, tightly packed spires won awards. Russell was later awarded an MBE, and the Royal Horticultural Society awarded him the Veitch Memorial Medal for a lifetime's achievement in horticulture. Baker later secured Russell's entire stock; in their heyday, Bakers Nurseries Ltd. of Codsall, Wolverhamton attracted 80,000 visitors in June to see of lupines in flower. Wild Lupine on St. George Island, Alaska Russell disliked the blue colours, as they reflected too closely the original plants imported from America almost a 100 years previously. The blue colouring is a recessive allele, and so although Russell might have worked hard to suppress it, lupines left unchecked over several generations will eventually revert to the old blues. Almost all garden lupines today are hybrids of the true Russell hybrids due to their ease of cross pollinating with one another, and with no special interest in lupine cultivating until recent years it has meant the plants have created a large pool of genetic diversity and variation from the original Russells. There is strong concern that Russell lupine DNA significantly contaminates large percentages of commercially-available Sundial Lupine, Lupinus perennis, seed, making it potentially unsuitable for the larvae of the endangered Karner Blue, Plebejus melissa samuelis, butterfly. The Karner cannot feed upon Russell lupines, nor can it feed upon the base Lupinus polyphyllus species. Those who wish to protect the Karner should prevent the introduction of Lupinus polyphyllus and Russell lupines into the remaining areas where the butterfly continues to exist, to prevent the toxic lupine hybridization. The templates created by Russell are still used by other specialist lupine horticulturalists today, e.g., Maurice and Brian Woodfield, nurserymen from Stratford-upon-Avon, who received the RHS Veitch Memorial Medal for their work on lupines in 2000. The Woodfields created more complex plants with more varied and vivid bi-coloured spikes, the red and yellow, and red and purple flowers are particular highlights of the \\"Woodfield\\" lupine variety. In 2009, Sarah Conibear who runs the Westcountry Nurseries, displayed several new varieties including the ‚ÄòBeefeater', about which the RHS writer Graham Rice commented \\"[the beefeater] has what looks to be the best red lupine we've seen so far.\\" ==Cultivation and uses== Garden cultivars of Lupinus polyphyllus It is commonly used in gardens for its attractiveness to bees, ability to improve poor sandy soils with their nitrogen fixing ability and flowers; numerous cultivars have been selected for differing flower colour, including red, pink, white, blue, and multicoloured with different colours on different petals. Often hybrids between L. polyphyllus and L. arboreus are used, and sold under hybrid names such as Rainbow Lupins, Lupin Tutti Fruitti, and Band of Nobles (mixed), Chandelier (yellow), My Castle (red), Noble Maiden (white) The Chatelaine (pink), and The Governor (blue). They are very hardy plants, surviving extreme temperatures withstanding frost to at least and the wild varieties can easily become invasive and hard to dispose of unless kept in check on a regular basis. They need a reasonable level of sun to survive, and do best in light soils, suffering in heavy and clay types, once fully established they are extremely resilient and may be divided. Seeds taken from the mother plant will never be a true replica of the original even if they produce similar colourings. Low alkaloidal or sweet cultivars of this lupine suitable for fodder crops have been bred. To avoid restoration of alkaloid synthesis in cross-pollinated species of lupine, a new approach has been developed on the basis of specific crossing. Only compatible forms are involved in hybridization, with their low alkaloid content controlled by one and the same genetic system. These approaches have allowed transforming this bitter weed into a valuable fodder crop. In the conditions of Northwest Russia positive results from the use of the sweet commercial cultivar \\"Pervenec\\" (first sweet variety), which is included in the State Catalogue of selection achievements of Russia. Breeding of sweet lupine is carried out also in Finland. The newer garden hybrids of today are highly poisonous because they are full of toxic alkaloids and should never be eaten. The species is also toxic to livestock. ==Invasive species== Russell lupines alongside a road in Canterbury, New Zealand. Lupinus polyphyllus alongside a road in High Tatras, Slovakia. In New Zealand, where it is known as the Russell lupin, Lupinus polyphyllus is classed as an invasive species and covers large areas next to roadsides, pastures and riverbeds, especially in the Canterbury region. It is documented as being first naturalised in 1958 and it has been suggested that tour bus drivers deliberately spread seeds of the plant to promote colourful roadside vegetation in areas which some tourists may consider to be rather drab. The plant threatens indigenous species especially when it invades the braided river beds in the South Island. It is also classed as an invasive species in Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Argentina, the Czech Republic, Finland, Lithuania, and Ukraine. ==References== ==External links== * *Plants of British Columbia: Lupinus polyphyllus * Jepson Flora Project: Lupinus polyphyllus *Lupins - geography, classification, genetic resources *Perennial forms of Washington lupin (L. polyphyllus Lindl.) for effective use in Finland polyphyllus Category:Garden plants Category:Flora of North America ","title":"Lupinus polyphyllus"},{"id":"305715","text":"Lupinus, commonly known as lupin or lupine, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family Fabaceae.

The European white lupin (L. albus) beans are commonly sold in a salty solution in jars (like olives and pickles) and can be eaten with or without the skin. Lupini dishes are most commonly found in Europe, especially in Portugal, Spain, Greece, and Italy. They are also common in Brazil and Egypt. In Egypt, the lupin is known in Arabic as , and is a popular street snack after being treated with several soakings of water, and then brined. In Portugal, Spain, and Spanish Harlem, they are consumed with beer. In Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Palestine, and Israel, salty and chilled lupini beans are called termos and in Hebrew turmus (◊™◊ï◊®◊û◊ï◊°) and are served as part of an ap√©ritif or a snack. Other species, such as L. albus (white lupin), L. angustifolius (narrow-leafed lupin),Murcia, J. and I. Hoyos. (1998).

With early detection, these can be removed through processing, although lupins containing these elements are not usually selected for food-grade products. A risk of lupine allergy exists in patients allergic to peanuts.The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology 104(4 Pt. 1), 883-88. Indeed, most lupin reactions reported have been in people with peanut allergy.Opinion of the scientific panel on dietetic products, nutrition and allergies on a request from the Commission related to the evaluation of lupin for labelling purposes. The European Food Safety Authority Journal 302 1-11. 2005. Because of the cross-allergenicity of peanut and lupin, the European Commission, as of 2006, has required that food labels indicate the presence of \\"lupin and products thereof\\" in food.Commission Directive 2006/142/EC of 22 December 2006 amending Annex IIIa of Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council listing the ingredients which must under all circumstances appear on the labeling of foodstuffs. == Agriculture == Many annual species of lupins are used in agriculture and most of them have Mediterranean origin.Langer, R.H.M. & Hill, G.D. 1991. Agricultural Plants, second edition. p 261. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. While originally cultivated as a green manure or forage, lupins are increasingly grown for their seeds, which can be used as an alternative to soybeans. Sweet (low alkaloid) lupins are highly regarded as a stock feed, particularly for ruminants, but also for pigs and poultry and more recently as an ingredient in aqua-feeds. The market for lupin seeds for human food is currently small, but researchers believe it has great potential. Lupin seeds are considered \\"superior\\" to soybeans in certain applications and evidence is increasing for their potential health benefits. They contain similar protein to soybean, but less fat. As a food source, they are gluten- free and high in dietary fiber, amino acids, and antioxidants, and they are considered to be prebiotic. About 85% of the world's lupin seeds are grown in Western Australia.Ross, K. Soy substitute edges its way into European meals. New York Times 16 November 2011. Three Mediterranean species of lupin, blue (narrow-leafed) lupin, white lupin, and yellow lupin, are widely cultivated for livestock and poultry feed. Like other legumes, they can fix nitrogen from the atmosphere into ammonia via a rhizobium‚Äìroot nodule symbiosis, fertilizing the soil for other plants. This adaptation allows lupins to be tolerant of infertile soils and capable of pioneering change in barren and poor-quality soils. The genus Lupinus is nodulated by Bradyrhizobium soil bacteria. == Horticulture == Lupinus polyphyllus, the garden lupin, and Lupinus arboreus, the tree lupin, are popular ornamental plants in gardens, and are the source of numerous hybrids and cultivars in a wide range of colours, including bicolors. As legumes, lupins are good companion plants in gardens, increasing the soil nitrogen for vegetables and other plants.

In New Zealand, L. polyphyllus has escaped into the wild and grows in large numbers along main roads and streams on the South Island. A similar spread of the species has occurred in Finland after the non- native species was first deliberately planted in the landscaping along the main roads. Lupins have been planted in some parts of Australia with a considerably cooler climate, particularly in rural Victoria and New South Wales. Lupins are important larval food plants for many lepidopterans (butterflies and moths).

In the late 18th century, lupins were introduced into northern Europe as a means of improving soil quality, and by the 1860s, the garden yellow lupin was seen across the sandy soils of the Baltic coastal plain. The first steps to truly transform the lupin into a contemporary, domesticated crop were taken in the early 20th century. German scientists attempted to cultivate a ‚Äòsweet‚Äô variety of lupin that did not have the bitter taste (due to a mixture of alkaloids in the seed), making it more suitable for both human and animal consumption. The successful development of lupin varieties with the necessary \\"sweet gene\\" paved the way for the greater adoption of lupins across Europe and later Australia. Further work carried out by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food during the 1950s and '60s led to more sweet lupin crops produced in Western Australia now than anywhere else in the world. == Taxonomy == The genus Lupinus L. and, in particular, its North American species were divided by Sereno Watson (1873) into three sections: Lupinus, Platycarpos, and Lupinnelus. Differences in habitat and in the number of ovules were the basis for this classification. A majority of the perennial and annual species from the American continent described by Watson were referred to Lupinus. Some annual species with two ovules in the ovary and two seeds in the pod (L. densiflorus, L. microcarpus, etc.) were attributed to the Platycarpos section. Section Lupinnelus consisted of one species (L. uncialis), with axillary and solitary flowers, scarcely reflexed banner, and also with two ovules in the ovary. While Watson's work was predominantly based on study of North American species, the later research of Ascherson and Graebner (1907) extended his principle of classification to cover all lupins from the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, also using number of ovules (seedbuds) in the ovary (and thus of seeds in the pod) as the criterion for this division. They described two subgenera, Eulupinus and Platycarpos. Most of the described species were referred to subgen. A. Eulupinus. Subgen. B. Platycarpos included several annual species from the Eastern Hemisphere with two seedbuds and seeds in the bean (the same species, as the one specified by S. Watson). A current schema retains this distinction, but uses the nomenclature for the subgenera of Platycarpos and Lupinus. In this schema, subgenus Platycarpos (S.Wats.) Kurl. contains perennial and annual species from the Western Hemisphere, with a minimum two or more ovules or seedbuds. Subgenus Lupinus consists of 12 species from Africa and the Mediterranean, with a minimum of four ovules or seedbuds.Kurlovich, B. S. and A. K. Stankevich. (eds.) Classification of Lupins. In: Lupins: Geography, Classification, Genetic Resources and Breeding. St. Petersburg: Intan. 2002. pg 42-43. Accessed 2 August 2013. The taxonomy of Lupinus has always been confusing. How many distinct species exist or how they might be organized within the genus is not clear. The plants are variable and the taxa are not always distinct from one another. Some American taxa have been described as complexes rather than separate species.Naganowska, B., et al. (2005). 2C DNA variation and relationships among New World species of the genus Lupinus (Fabaceae). Plant Systematics and Evolution 256(1-4), 147-57. Estimates of the number of lupine species generally fall between 200 and 500. One authority places the estimate at approximately 267 species worldwide. Currently, two subgenera are recognized. ===Subgenus Platycarpos=== The ovary contains two and more ovules or seedbuds. The seed are predominantly small- sized, with an underdeveloped embryo and small amount of endosperm. Cotyledons are small-sized, with long caulicles. The first pair of true leaves is alternate. The stem is predominantly naked with waxen coating. Dominating is the monopodial type of branching. Leaflets are smooth, with waxen coating or slight pubescence, predominantly narrow. Pods are flat or orbicular, with two or more seeds. Represented by frutcuilose, fruticose and herbaceous perennial forms, or less often annual ones. Plants are cross-pollinated. Chromosome number 2n = 36, 48, or 96. This subgenus is distributed throughout North, Central and South America, predominantly in the mining systems of the Andes and Cordillera. Some species are cultivated (L. mutabilis, L. polyphyllus). This subgenus includes several hundred species, requiring further analysis of their authenticity.

It should not be confused with Rosa multiflora, which is also known as \\"Japanese rose\\". The Latin word \\"rugosa\\" means \\"wrinkled\\", referring to the wrinkled leaves.Jo Ann Gardner Sara Williams ==Description== Rosa rugosa is a suckering shrub which develops new plants from the roots and forms dense thickets 1‚Äì1.50 m tall with stems densely covered in numerous short, straight prickles 3‚Äì10 mm long. The leaves are 8‚Äì15 cm long, pinnate with 5‚Äì9 leaflets, most often 7, each leaflet 3‚Äì4 cm long, with a distinctly corrugated (rugose, hence the species' name) surface. The leaf is a elliptical in shape with a rounded base or broadly cuneate with a leather feel, dark green top. The back of the leaf is composed of a green-grey colour with hair along the veins. The leaf margin is composed of teeth along the edges and is crenate-serrate. The flower has five petals that are usually 6-9 cm in width. The flower is composed of 200-250 stamens per flow and vary in style. The flowers are pleasantly scented, dark pink to white (on R. rugosa f. alba (Ware) Rehder), 6‚Äì9 cm across, with somewhat wrinkled petals; flowering occurs in spring. The edible hips, which resemble cherry tomatoes, are large, 2‚Äì3 cm diameter, and often shorter than their diameter, not elongated; in late summer and early autumn the plants often bear fruit and flowers at the same time. The leaves typically turn bright yellow before falling in autumn. ==History== This rose species was introduced to America from Japan in the mid-19th century; it was valued because it can tolerate salt water spray. ==Cultivation and uses== Rosa rugosa is widely used as an ornamental plant. It has been introduced to numerous areas of Europe and North America. It has many common names, several of which refer to the fruit's resemblance to a tomato, including beach tomato or sea tomato; others include saltspray rose, beach rose, potato rose and Turkestan rose. In parts of the US the fruits are also occasionally called beach plums, causing confusion with the plant properly bearing that name, Prunus maritima. The sweetly scented flowers are traditionally used to make flower jam and dessert in China. They are also used to make pot-pourri in Japan and China. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat irregular menstruation and gastritis. This species hybridises readily with many other roses, and is valued by rose breeders for its considerable resistance to the diseases rose rust and rose black spot. It is also extremely tolerant of seaside salt spray and storms, commonly being the first shrub in from the coast. It is widely used in landscaping, being relatively tough and trouble- free. Needing little maintenance due to it being very disease resistant, it is suitable for planting in large numbers; its salt-tolerance makes it useful for planting beside roads which need deicing with salt regularly. Numerous cultivars have been selected for garden use, with flower colour varying from white to dark red-purple, and with semi-double to double flowers where some or all of the stamens are replaced by extra petals. Popular examples include 'Rubra Plena' (semi-double variant, with strong clove scented dark pink petals and dark green wrinkled leaves and large round orange-red hips), 'Hansa' (very fragrant, red-purple double), 'Fru Dagmar Hastrup' (pink, single), 'Pink Grootendorst' (pink, semi-double), 'Blanc Double de Coubert' (white, double) and the more common 'Roseraie de L'Ha√ø' (pink, double), which is often used for its very successful rootstock and its ornamental rose hips. == Economic effects == Varieties of this species are sold in nurseries. In cultivation it has been cross-bred with other roses. It is valued for its attractive flowers, and it is often used to create hedges and windbreakers. It can control erosion and is planted along highways in Germany and Denmark. ==Invasive species== Rosa rugosa is naturalized in many parts of Europe, and it is considered an invasive species in some habitats, particularly in seashores of Northern Europe. To further understand the invasive process, it was first introduced into England from Japan in 1796, and then in Germany in 1845. This was the first presence of the flower within the European continent. In 1875, Rosa rugosa was found in Denmark and then in Sweden in 1918. By 2001, the flower species had become well established within 61 European countries. Although, it is native within China, it has been labeled as an endangered species due to a noticeable high decline in population rates of the flower. The species was able to spread due to birds and animals that eat the berries from the bush and people buying the rose and taking it with them overseas. It can outcompete native flora, thereby threatening biological diversity. On Sylt, an island in the north of Germany, it is sufficiently abundant to have become known as the \\"Sylt rose\\". It is considered noxious in some states of the USA. R. rugosa was first introduced into North America in 1845. The first report of it being naturalized far from the location in which it was planted occurred on Nantucket in 1899 and was spreading rapidly by 1911. By 1920, the rose had been well established in Nantucket and in Connecticut. Ten years later it was said to be \\"straying rapidly\\" and today it is naturalized on the entire coast of New England and in scattered locations around the Northeast and Pacific Northwest. ==Potential allergen == Pollen or fragrance of rose may cause an allergic reaction. ==Vernacular names== In Japanese, it is called \\"beach aubergine\\", \\"beach pear\\" or simply \\"rose\\". The Chinese call it m√©iguƒ´ huƒÅ . In Korean, the species is called haedanghwa (, ), literally \\"flowers near the seashore\\". ==References== ==External links== * hort.net profile Rosa rugosa * * rugosa Category:Flora of China Category:Flora of Japan Category:Flora of Korea Category:Flora of Russia Category:Flora of Asia Category:Garden plants Category:Taxa named by Carl Peter Thunberg ","title":"Rosa rugosa"},{"id":"305721","text":"TimothyClause 5.3.2.2.3 BS 7370-5 (Phleum pratense) is an abundant perennial grass native to most of Europe except for the Mediterranean region. It is also known as timothy'-grass, meadow cat's-tail or common cat's tail.The Observer's book of grasses, sedge and rushes by Francis Rose, page 112, 1976, , published by Frederick Warne and Co Ltd It is a member of the genus Phleum, consisting of about 15 species of annual and perennial grasses. It is probably named after Timothy Hanson, an American farmer and agriculturalist said to have introduced it from New England to the southern states in the early 18th century. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 11th ed., p. 1310.Oxford English Dictionary, s.v. timothy grass.

The leaves are hairless, rolled rather than folded, and the lower sheaths turn dark brown. It has no stolons or rhizomes, and no auricles. The flowerhead is long and broad, with densely packed spikelets. It flowers from June until September. The stamen are pink. The ligule is short and blunt. It grows well in heavy soil, and is noted for its resistance to cold and drought, and thus ability to grow in dry upland or poor sandy soils. In pasture it tends to be overwhelmed by more competitive grasses. After cutting it grows slowly. Showing bulbous base and brown leaf sheaths ==Subspecies== There are two subspecies: *Phleum pratense subsp. pratense. Larger, to tall. Widespread. *Phleum pratense subsp. bertolonii. Smaller, to tall. Calcareous grassland. Inflorescence == Cultivation and uses == Timothy was unintentionally introduced to North America by early settlers, and was first described in 1711 by John Hurd from plants growing in New Hampshire. Hurd named the grass \\"hurd grass\\" but a farmer named Timothy Hanson began to promote cultivation of it as a hay about 1720, and the grass has been known by its present name since then. Timothy has now become naturalized throughout most of the US and Canada. It is commonly grown for cattle feed and, in particular, as hay for horses. It is relatively high in fibre, especially when cut late. It is considered a harsh, coarse grass little relished by livestock if cut earlier. It is considered part of the standard mix for grass hay and provides quality nutrition for horses. Timothy hay is a staple food for domestic pet rabbits, guinea pigs, chinchillas, and degus, often making up the bulk of their diet. Timothy hay is rich in long fibre and its abrasive texture helps to grind down the teeth, keeping both the teeth and jaw in good order. Some caterpillars use it as a food plant, e.g. the Essex skipper (Thymelicus lineola) and the marbled white (Melanargia galathea). It also grows in roadsides and abandoned fields but generally requires nutrient- rich soils. Its pollen is a common allergen; it has recently been used in small amounts as part of a new hay fever vaccine Grazax, which is designed to recondition the body's immune system so it no longer responds to pollen. Plants persist through the winter. Dead, straw-colored flowering stems may persist, but only for a short time, and are recognized by the distinctive spike-like inflorescence. ==Confusion with other species== Close-up of flower head showing hornlike spikelets It is often confused with meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis).

It can reach a total length of about . The body color is light green or bluish green. The skin between the scales often has a light color. A rust-coloured stripe extends from the nostril to behind the eye. On the back there are brownish or red-brick coloured dots which may form a thin line along the mid back. These geckos do not have eyelids, and they have flattened toe pads. == Habitat == P. m. magascariensis is often found on trees along the edges of forests. They also inhabit local huts and banana trees in the east coast of Madagascar because it has a humid and warm climate. == Diet == These day geckos feed on many arthropods (insects and arachnids) as well as some fruit matter(mashed). They also like to lick hard, tart fruit, pollen and nectar. == Behavior == Like most Phelsuma spec., the males can be quite quarrelsome and do not accept other males in their neighbourhood. In captivity, where the females cannot escape, the males can also sometimes seriously wound a female. In this case the male and female must be separated. == Reproduction == The mating season is between November and the first weeks of April. During this period, the females lay up to 6 pairs of eggs. At a temperature of 28 ¬∞C, the young will hatch after approximately 55 days. The juveniles measure 55-60 mm. == Care and maintenance in captivity == These animals should be housed alone, because they are highly territorial. Male and female pairs can get along but it is common that males harass females too much. They need a large, well planted terrarium. The temperature should be between 25 and 28 ¬∞C. On warm spot temperature should be 35-40 ¬∞C. The humidity at night should be maintained between 75 and 90%, on daytime between 60 and 80% In captivity, these animals can be fed with crickets, wax moth larvae, fruit flies, mealworms and houseflies. Fresh tropical fruits, honey and fruity baby foods are good to maintain their inner moisture. == Gallery == Image:Madagascar_day_gecko_(Phelsuma_madagascariensis_madagascariensis)_1.jpg Image:Madagascar_day_gecko_(Phelsuma_madagascariensis_madagascariensis)_2.jpg Image:Madagascar_day_gecko_(Phelsuma_madagascariensis_madagascariensis).jpg == References == *Henkel, F.-W. and W.

With a consistent lineup of guitarists Kaoru and Die, vocalist Kyo, drummer Shinya and bassist Toshiya, they have released ten full-length records. Numerous stylistic changes have made the genre of their music difficult to determine, though it is generally considered to be a form of metal. Originally a visual kei band, the members later opted for more subtle attire, but have continued to maintain a dramatic image on stage. ==History== ===1997‚Äì1999: Early career=== Dir En Grey was preceded by the independent rock band La:Sadie's, which included four of Dir En Grey's members before disbanding. They disbanded due to leader and bassist Kisaki not wanting to debut as he felt that it was too soon, but guitarist Kaoru believed that they were ready for it. After parting ways with Kisaki, members Kaoru, Kyo, Die and Shinya recruited bassist Toshiya and regrouped as a new band. After playing one show as a Kuroyume cover-band called DEATHMASK at the live house Nagano J on January 24, they officially formed \\"Dir en grey\\" on February 2, 1997. The band name is a combination of German \\"dir\\", French \\"en\\" and English \\"grey\\" and was thought to mean ,Apres Guerre #19 (March 1997) the Japanese translation was used as the name of their fanclub's magazine. They wanted to convey a musical image that was neither black nor white, so they picked grey. In an early interview, vocalist Kyo explained that he knew the name before the band was formed. Durig the WOWOW Special in 2020, Kaoru elaborates that they took the name from another band that was famous around that time. This band was most likely Lareine, who had released a song called \\"Dir en gray\\" in 1995. The song starts with the line ', with the Latin part being a correct translation of the Japanese part. Why the band thought that \\"dir\\" means \\"silver coin\\" is unknown, but they would become aware of this mistake later on: In a later interview, Kaoru explained that \\"at the time we chose the band name, it had some meaning but right now it doesn't express the band anymore, so it has come to not mean anything specific. We chose the band name because it sounded right, and it also reflects an image that probably doesn't exist elsewhere.\\" They released their first EP, Missa, a few months later and attracted mainstream attention in 1998, by entering the top ten on the Oricon music charts with the still independently produced songs \\"Jealous\\" and \\"-I'll-\\". Five subsequent singles, arranged and produced by X Japan co- founder Yoshiki Hayashi, were published during the first half of 1999. The band's first full-length record, Gauze, followed. One of the shows in support for the album (filmed at the Osaka-jo Hall) would later become the first of several live concerts to be released on VHS and DVD. ===2000‚Äì2004: From Macabre to Vulgar=== In 2000, vocalist Kyo was hospitalized with hearing trouble and several dates of the tour in support of Dir En Grey's then- upcoming album, Macabre, had to be postponed. Tour 00 >> 01 Macabre eventually took off later the same year and was concluded at Nippon Budokan shortly after the release of the single \\"Ain't Afraid to Die\\" in April 2001. In the following year, along with the release of a third full-length album, Kisou, Dir En Grey gave their first performances abroad, touring China, Taiwan, and South Korea. Back in Japan, the last dates of the lengthy Rettou Gekishin Angya tour were already in support for the band's second EP, Six Ugly. In the same year, they released the single \\"Child Prey\\", which was featured as the second opening theme of the Baki the Grappler anime series, and also the beginning of their fourth album called Vulgar. In summer 2003, Dir En Grey performed at Akasaka Blitz for five evenings in a single week, with each show (except the first) themed after a certain album, the last featuring songs from the then yet to be released Vulgar. A DVD set, titled Blitz 5 Days, was later released exclusively for members of the band's official fan club, titled \\"A Knot\\". Vulgar was released in September 2003 and tours in support for the record would last well into 2004. ===2005‚Äì2006: Early non-Asian touring=== In 2005, Dir En Grey performed in Europe for the first time. Their concerts in Berlin and Paris (as part of the It Withers and Withers tour) sold out without promotion save for newsletters by import record stores and internet-based word of mouth. Kyo performing live at Rock im Park in 2006 The band also performed at two major festivals, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park. Becoming more involved with the international music scene, French band Eths opened for them at the Paris concert and Dir en Grey invited American musician Wednesday 13 and his band to play at a show in Japan. Dir En Grey also appeared at the Japanese leg of that year's Taste of Chaos tour. 2005 saw the group's first official European releases as well, beginning with Withering to Death. The band's music had previously been available through means of import and Internet file- sharing only for European fans. The album achieved Dir En Grey's first non- Asian chart position, reaching No. 31 in the Finnish album charts. The subsequent single, \\"Clever Sleazoid\\", later climbed to No. 15 on the singles charts in the same country. Several Dir En Grey songs were also featured in the soundtrack of the 2005 film Death Trance. In early 2006 touring expanded to the United States. The band performed in Austin, Texas at the South by Southwest festival, New York City at the Avalon Club and Los Angeles, California at the Wiltern Theatre, followed by the North American release of Withering to Death. Again, all shows sold out within days. After more concerts and festival appearances in Germany during the summer, singer Kyo was again hospitalized due to inflamed vocal cords. While two concert dates in Japan had to be postponed, Dir En Grey was still able to join Korn's Family Values Tour 2006. In October, the band was back in Japan to perform at the Loudpark Festival, along with bands such as Megadeth, Slayer and Children of Bodom. Their 22nd single \\"Agitated Screams of Maggots\\" was released on 15 November during the Japanese leg of the Inward Scream tour. On 30 December, the music video for -Saku- was voted the No. 1 video of the year on the MTV2 show Headbanger's Ball. ===2007‚Äì2009: The Marrow of a Bone and Uroboros=== In February, Dir En Grey went on its first North American headlining tour, visiting sixteen cities\\"Dir En Grey' cross the USA\\". (January 2007) Newtype USA. Vol. 6 No. 1 p. 19. as its sixth full-length album The Marrow of a Bone was released on February 7 in Japan and in the United States and Europe in the following months. From May to July, the group opened for the Deftones on their United States tour and afterwards did another European tour, which included their debut shows in Denmark, Finland, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, as well as several festival performances across the continent, including Ankkarock, M'era Luna Festival and Wacken Open Air. The group went on another international tour in September named after their most recent single \\"Dozing Green\\", beginning in Japan and continuing in Europe, including their first performance in the Netherlands and Switzerland. In late November, Dir En Grey opened two shows for Linkin Park at Saitama Super Arena and in December performed another Japan tour with 10 Years as a supporting act. Commemorating Dir En Grey's tenth anniversary as a band, two greatest hits compilations, titled Decade 1998‚Äì2002 and Decade 2003‚Äì2007 respectively, were released on December 19. At the beginning of 2008, Dir En Grey announced plans to begin recording a new studio album. Their first touring of the year in May was another Japan tour with a conclusion of three shows at Shinkiba Studio Coast, titled Death over Blindness. Between touring, Dir En Grey performed at one night of the two-night hide memorial summit on May 4, alongside X Japan, Luna Sea, and others. A second Japanese tour, titled Tour 08 The Rose Trims Again began on September 10, the same day as the release of their single \\"Glass Skin\\". On August 1, Dir En Grey announced the release of their seventh studio album, Uroboros, which was released on November 11, 2008 in the United States. The band also toured the United States and Canada in support of the album, with dates scheduled for November and December (overlapping the release of Uroboros) with opening act The Human Abstract. Touring that fall included a series of four shows titled Bajra, two being fan-club exclusive, and a single show on December 29 under the moniker Uroboros -Breathing- at the famous Osaka-jo Hall where Dir En Grey had not performed since December 18, 1999 (as seen on 1999.12.18 Osakajo Hall). Beginning in 2009, Dir En Grey made their first thorough tour of the United Kingdom and Ireland with Kerrang!'s \\"Relentless Tour '09\\" alongside Mindless Self Indulgence, Bring Me the Horizon, Black Tide and In Case of Fire. In February, the band announced the public release of the live DVD, Tour 08 The Rose Trims Again, as well as switching European record labels to the newly founded Okami Records, a sister label of their former European representation, Gan-Shin. During spring of 2009, the band began to fully promote Uroboros with a series of nationwide tours under the title Tour 09 Feast of V Senses. The tour was interrupted briefly while in Sapporo and Sendai, with an announcement on the band's official website, explaining that Kyo had been diagnosed with edema of the larynx, and would require the postponement of three shows, which were rescheduled for early May. Dir En Grey in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany, in 2009 Dir En Grey continued their Feast of V Senses tour in Europe, with a mixture of festival performances, headlining shows, and one co-headlining show with Killswitch Engage. The festival performances included their third appearances at Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, as well as their initial concerts at Download Festival, Nova Rock, and Metaltown. Among the headlining shows, Dir En Grey were also making debut concerts in Italy and the Czech Republic. After several shows of their late-summer tour, All Visible Things, Dir En Grey announced their next single for December, \\"Hageshisa to, Kono Mune no Naka de Karamitsuita Shakunetsu no Yami\\", as well as a North American and South American tour also under the title All Visible Things. Their new single was released on December 2, 2009 and reached number 2 on the Oricon Weekly Chart: the highest position to date for the band. Their 2009 tour season ended with a three-live tour titled Dorje. They finally ended their long Uroboros centered tour by doing two back to back performances at the Nippon Budokan, titled Uroboros: with the proof in the name of living‚Ä¶, where tickets sold out in 15 minutes. ===2010‚Äì2013: Dum Spiro Spero and The Unraveling=== It was announced on April 7, 2010, that the band would be returning to the United Kingdom in August on the lineup for the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth, playing on a bill headlined by Iron Maiden and Rammstein. According to the festival website, this was to be their only UK festival performance during the year. Regarding the announcement, Kaoru (on the Sonisphere UK website) is quoted as saying: \\"I'd never have thought that we would play a festival of this caliber! It is like a dream come true to be playing with such great bands at Sonisphere. Although we‚Äôre not back in the UK for a tour, we wanted to play this festival to give something back to the fans who were disappointed last year from our cancelled finale in London.‚Äù It was announced on April 28, 2010 that Dir En Grey would be playing an exclusive club date at London's Koko venue on August 3 as part of The Unwavering Fact of Tomorrow Tour 2010.

They followed this tour with a North American tour in December 2019 and another European tour in January and February 2020. Their 30th single, \\"The World of Mercy\\", released on September 18, 2019. They provided a cover of \\"National Media Boys\\" for the January 29, 2020 Buck-Tick tribute album Parade III ~Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick~ A new single, \\"Ochita Koto no Aru Sora\\" was released digitally on August 3rd 2020. ==Musical style and influences== Dir En Grey has been categorized in many genres such as extreme metal, alternative, experimental, avant-garde and various others. Dir En Grey's format has been subject to change throughout their career, initially being a rather experimental form of alternative rock. Some tracks of their debut album Gauze also demonstrated a distinct pop appeal, which was largely dropped in favor of a more progressive sound on the following albums, Macabre and Kisou. While up to that point some songs had already been more fast-paced, raw and aggressive than others, the band's music took a decisive turn with the release of the EP Six Ugly, from then on sporting more metal influences in general. Dir En Grey's style gravitated towards riffs and song structures more along the lines of contemporary North American fusion genres, such as nu metal and metalcore, until 2007's The Marrow of a Bone. In a review of their sixth full-length album, The Marrow of a Bone, AllMusic's Thom Jurek comments on their evolution and diversity, saying: Since the release of their album Uroboros in 2008, Dir En Grey have been repeatedly described as progressive metal. Uroboros and their 2011 album Dum Spiro Spero represent a particular musical departure from previous albums, with critics noting that their sound on these albums bears almost nothing in common to their earliest work. With Uroboros, and particularly on Dum Spiro Spero, the band have moved away from their alternative rock roots towards a heavier metal sound. These albums feature complex song structures and guitarwork, longer track lengths, and a broader variety of particularly western influences, such as death metal, deathcore and groove metal. Kyo's singing is considered a pivotal aspect of the band, and he has gained recognition for his distinctive vocal work and for his large range and versatility, being able to \\"howl, croon, emote cleanly, scream, shriek, growl, bellow, and make nearly inhuman sounds.\\" Jurek has compared him favorably to experimental and avant-garde vocalists Mike Patton and Diamanda Galas. Loudwire wrote \\"Sporting incredibly low death metal gutturals, Kyo can also turn a complete 180 as one of metal's highest shriekers.\\" Dane Prokofiev of PopMatters said that his \\"natural ease at and inclination towards striking such a stark contrast between the two opposite ends of the human vocal spectrum can be obtained as only a kind of pre-birth winning lottery ticket‚Äîyou know, that much coveted prize we call ‚Äútalent‚Äù.\\" Commentators have noted how Dir en Grey have gained a significant international fanbase with vocals in Japanese. Kaoru said \\"when I was growing up, I listened to American bands. They were all singing in English and I had no idea what they were saying. But I still remember the excitement that I experienced. I know as a listener that our fans can connect to our music in the same way ‚Äî even with the language barrier.\\" When asked why they almost always use Japanese instead of English, which would give them more broad international appeal, he said that \\"We consider our music [to be] a piece of art. [...] The language is part of that artwork.\\" The guitarist explained that Kyo, who writes all of the lyrics, prefers \\"the sensitivities that Japanese language offers. There are expressions and nuances that can only be conveyed in Japanese; he values that.\\" However, he noted that likewise there are some expressions that are only able to be shown in English, so they also plan to use English when they feel the need. The lyrics deal with subjects such as society and mass media, as well as sexual obsessions and love, usually with negative implications. The vocabulary varies from subtle to explicit (though the use of profanity has greatly decreased as the band matured, last featuring on Uroboros), and several songs rely heavily on double entendres and other wordplay, often involving the multiple meanings of a kanji character. Although they got their start as a visual kei band, the members of Dir en Grey seem to be irked being associated with the term in some later interviews. Speaking of the change in their appearance, Kaoru said \\"Eventually, we felt that dressing like we used to onstage put up a wall between us and the audience, so we stopped wearing the kind of makeup we did before.\\" However, he said they still occasionally wear makeup, just not as much. Toshiya explained \\"To be honest, when we first started and we were wearing a lot of makeup on stage and stuff, there were a lot of bands doing that at the time in Japan, and people thought it was cool. But not anymore, ha ha.\\" Die said \\"They saw us as idols but we aren't idols. We are a band, we play music and want to be known for it. So we decided to change our style slowly.\\" Kyo stated that for Dir en Grey it was always about the music and when wearing lots of makeup became popular, \\"we didn't want to be associated with a lot of the poor quality bands in that scene.\\" Dir en Grey have created some controversy in Japan as some of their music videos have been banned from television for \\"abrasive visuals including baby-eating, murder,[and] gore.\\" Similarly, stations refused to play the video for 2008's \\"Vinushka\\" which included stock footage of World War II and newspaper headlines following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Kyo cited Bauhaus's Press the Eject and Give Me the Tape and David Sylvian's Secrets of the Beehive as his favorite albums. Kaoru listed X's Blue Blood, Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power, Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral, The Beatles' 1962‚Äì1966 and 1967‚Äì1970 in his favorite albums list. Die's inspirations included D'erlanger's La Vie En Rose and Ziggy's Kool Kizz. Toshiya hailed Alice in Chains' Dirt and Radiohead's OK Computer. Shinya cited Aion's Absolute and Gargoyle's Furebumi as his influences. ==Members== ;Kaoru ; band leader, lead guitar, backing vocals. He has been with Dir En Grey since its inception in 1997 and was previously a member of CHARM and La:Sadie's. He composed most of the group's songs up to the Vulgar album, at which point individual credits for composition were dropped. He performs many solos for the band. Kaoru cites X Japan guitarist Hide as his biggest influence and the reason he plays guitar, saying \\"If I had never known him, I wouldn‚Äôt be who I am today.\\" Since 2014, Kaoru has suffered from nerve paralysis, and has sometimes resorted to taping his guitar plectrum to his hand. Since 2015, he hosts a radio program turned YouTube channel, \\"The Freedom of Expression\\". ;Kyo ; vocalist and lyricist since the band formed. ;Die Die (born December 20, 1974, in Mie); rhythm guitar, backing vocals. Has been with the group since its inception in 1997. In the mid-1990s, he was a member of the bands KaÔΩ•zaÔΩ•ri and La:Sadie's. In 2015, Die began a side project, Decays, for which he is the vocalist and guitarist. Die composed several songs for Dir En Grey, such as \\"304 Goushitsu, Hakushi no Sakura\\", \\"Wake\\", and \\"Mr.Newsman\\". Die became interested in rock music after hearing Buck-Tick's album Aku no Hana in junior high school. He developed his love of guitar from D'erlanger's debut album La Vie En Rose and called their guitarist Cipher his \\"guitar hero.\\" ;Shinya Shinya (born February 24, 1978 in Hirakata, Osaka); drums. In 1995 he helped form La:Sadie's, which disbanded in 1997, after which Dir En Grey was formed. Shinya has composed a handful of songs for Dir En Grey, his compositions alternating between melodic (\\"Hotarubi\\", \\"Fukai\\") and upbeat tunes (\\"Raison Detre\\", \\"Umbrella\\"). ;Toshiya Toshiya (born March 31, 1977, in Nagano); bass, backing vocals. He has been with the band since its inception, although he was not in La:Sadie's. Toshiya composed \\"Erode\\" and \\"Bottom of the Death Valley\\". His compositions tend to have a distinct, bass-driven sound. ===Members gallery=== ==Discography== ; Studio albums * Gauze (1999) * Macabre (2000) * Kisou (2002) * Vulgar (2003) * Withering to Death (2005) * The Marrow of a Bone (2007) * Uroboros (2008) * Dum Spiro Spero (2011) * Arche (2014) * The Insulated World (2018) ==ReferencesAbout Heavy Metal Interview Category:Gan-Shin artists Category:Sony Music Entertainment Japan artists Category:Visual kei musical groups Category:Japanese avant-garde metal musical groups Category:Japanese alternative metal musical groups Category:Japanese death metal musical groups Category:Japanese progressive metal musical groups Category:Japanese gothic metal musical groups Category:Japanese nu metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1997 Category:Musical groups from Osaka Category:Musical quintets Category:1997 establishments in Japan ","title":"Dir En Grey"},{"id":"305759","text":"The Aldabra Island day gecko, or Aldabra day gecko (Phelsuma abbotti abbotti), has been found on the Aldabra Atoll (Seychelles).

It is a suburban situation comedy of manners, and a satire on the aspirations and tastes of the new middle class that emerged in Britain in the 1970s. The play developed in lengthy improvisations during which Mike Leigh explored the characters with the actors, but did not always reveal the incidents that would occur during the play. The production opened in April 1977 at the Hampstead Theatre, and returned after its initial run in the summer of 1977, for 104 performances in all. A recording was arranged at the BBC as a Play for Today, produced by Margaret Matheson for BBC Scotland and transmitted in November 1977. ==Performances== The stage play was first performed at the Hampstead Theatre on 18 April 1977, enjoying great success, leading to a revival over the summer of that year, which was another sellout. The television version was abridged from over two hours to 104 minutes; the record played by Beverly in the original stage production was \\"Light My Fire\\" by Jos√© Feliciano and in the TV production it was the 1976 hit \\"Forever and Ever\\" by Demis Roussos ‚Äì Leigh had to replace nearly all the music with artists recorded on British labels, for copyright reasons, in case the BBC sold the play to the United States. As Jos√© Feliciano became Demis Roussos, so Elvis Presley gave way to Tom Jones. Other music used in the BBC production included \\"Love to Love You Baby\\" by Donna Summer (sung here by Clare Torry\\"Play for Today (TV Series)  Abigail's Party (1977)  Trivia\\", IMDb) and a piece of library music by Robert Farnon entitled \\"Blue Theme\\". The BBC version was a film of a play, rather than a film in its own right, about which Leigh commented: ==Original cast== The original production starred Alison Steadman as Beverly, and Tim Stern as her husband Laurence. They are holding a drinks party for their new neighbours, Angela (Janine Duvitski) and her husband Tony (John Salthouse). They also invite Susan (Thelma Whiteley), another neighbour. Abigail herself is never seen‚Äîshe is Susan's 15-year-old daughter, who is holding her first teenager party next door. For the television version, the original cast reprised their roles with the exception of Thelma Whiteley, who was replaced by Harriet Reynolds. Each of the original cast largely devised the back story to their character. John Salthouse brought his early career as a footballer with Crystal Palace to that of Tony. According to Leigh, discussions at the improvised sessions included whether Beverly's name should have a third \\"e\\" or not. The most complex relationship was worked out between Angela and Tony. Little of this is disclosed during the narrative, although something of it becomes apparent when Angela steps in to care first for Sue, then the stricken Laurence, and the centre of power between the couple starts to shift noticeably. ==Characters== ;Beverly Moss: An ex-department store cosmetics demonstrator, \\"a quondam beautician\\", she has failed her driving test three times. During the play, she flirts with Tony and is always trying to impress her guests. She considers her taste in music (Jose Feliciano/Demis Roussos, Tom Jones) and art (kitsch erotica) to be every bit as good as that of her husband. Immensely proud of her home, she nonetheless admits that she cannot use the gadgets in her kitchen. Throughout the night, Beverly offers her guests drinks and cigarettes (despite the fact that Tony and Angela have recently given up), which they usually refuse but end up taking due to her being unable to take no for an answer. Beverly effectively forces her guests to agree with her on most topics, for instance on the music they should listen to, or whether olives should be served, in each instance using their apparent consensus to score points with her husband. Despite her \\"sophisticated\\" tastes and carefully groomed appearance, she was described by Alan Bennett as having \\"shoulders like a lifeguard, and a walk to match.\\" According to the critic Michael Coveney; \\"Beverly is undoubtedly a monster. But she is also a deeply sad and vulnerable monster‚Ä¶ The whole point about Beverly is that she is childless, and there is a sense in which that grotesque exterior carapace is a mask of inner desolation.\\"Coveney, p.119-120 :Interviewed in 2012, Steadman said of the play, \\"Overnight, that piece was incredibly powerful. ... They were very strong, identifiable characters. We laugh at them because we say, 'Oh my God, I know that person, thank goodness I'm not like that', and you cringe, but you know they're true. We can safely sit in the comfort of our living rooms or theatre seats and laugh our heads off. But we've perhaps all got a bit of Beverly in us.\\" In a 2017 piece written for The Guardian, Leigh described Beverly as \\"an aspirational working class girl who is totally preoccupied with appearances and received notions of behaviour and taste. A bundle of contradictions, she espouses the idea of people freely enjoying themselves, yet endlessly bullies everybody into doing what she wrongly thinks they'll enjoy, or what is good for them. But, while she may be perceived as monstrous, she is in fact vulnerable, insecure and sad\\". ;Laurence Moss: Estate agent with \\"Wibley Webb\\". Laurence is Beverly's husband, and the pair frequently argue. He aspires to the finer things in life: leather-bound Shakespeare (which he thinks \\"can't be read\\"), prints of Van Gogh and Lowry paintings, and Beethoven, which he forces on his guests at unfortunate moments. He seems powerless to compete with Beverly's more flamboyant persona, and compensates by working too much, as his wife points out on several occasions. He considers a brisk handshake to be correct etiquette after a dance. While Laurence starts off behaving normally during the party, as he becomes increasingly hen-pecked by his wife, he begins to act in a more neurotic manner, to the point where he too becomes an annoyance to his guests. While Susan welcomes the increasing \\"cosmopolitanism\\" of the area, Laurence does not. ;Tony Cooper: Tony works in computing‚Äîmerely as a computer operator, his wife twice points out‚Äîand used to play professional football for Crystal Palace but it \\"didn't work out\\". Tony is quiet throughout most of the play, usually appearing uneasy and giving one-word answers, but towards the end he becomes somewhat irate and quick-tempered, particularly with his wife. Beverly flirts with him in the second half of the play, much to Laurence's annoyance. At one point, Beverly asks Angela if he is violent. \\"No, he's not violent. Just a bit nasty. Like, the other day, he said to me, he'd like to sellotape my mouth. And that's not very nice, is it?\\" \\"It certainly isn't, Ange!\\" replies Beverly. Leigh later attributed Tony's aggression to an underlying shyness and self-consciousness. The surname Cooper was not mentioned in the original script or teleplay, and is taken from a picture on the Mike Leigh at the BBC DVD box set. ;Angela Cooper: Tony's wife. A nurse, Angela appears very meek and somewhat childlike, unintelligent and tactless (much like Steadman's character in a previous Leigh play, Nuts in May). She cannot drive; Tony does not wish her to do so. Interested in the mundane and commonplace, much to her husband's annoyance, she comes into her own when Sue feels queasy and after Laurence suffers a heart attack. Leigh noted that \\"underneath Angela's apparent silliness is the tough, practical reliability of an experienced working nurse\\". ;Susan Lawson: Sue was getting divorced at the same time the other characters were getting married, as pointed out by Angela. A quiet character who does not really have the courage to say no, she is the only woman visibly not \\"dressed-up\\" for the gathering; clearly, she would rather be elsewhere. Throughout the play, Laurence attempts to find common ground with her. As originally cast, she towers over the diminutive Laurence, and Beverly's exhortations for her to dance with him only compound her awkwardness. Sue's 15-year old daughter Abigail is holding the party from which the play's title is derived. Her 11-year old son Jeremy has gone to stay elsewhere. Sue appears to be anxious about the party, and at one point is sick in the bathroom. ==Plot== The terrain is \\"the London side of Essex\\", \\"theoretical Romford\\" according to Leigh.Coveney, p.116 Beverly Moss invites her new neighbours, Angela and Tony, who moved into the road just two weeks ago, over for drinks. She has also invited her neighbour Susan (Sue), divorced for three years, whose fifteen-year-old daughter Abigail is holding a party at home. Beverly's husband Laurence comes home late from work, just before the guests arrive. The gathering starts off in a stiff, insensitive, British middle-class way as the virtual strangers tentatively gather, until Beverly and Laurence start sniping at each other. As Beverly serves more drinks and the alcohol takes effect, Beverly flirts more and more overtly with Tony, as Laurence sits impotently by. After a tirade when Beverly insists on showing off her kitsch print Wings of Love, Laurence suffers a fatal heart attack. ==Class== Beverly, Tony and, to a lesser extent Angela, all speak with an accent centred on Essex or Estuary English. Laurence's accent, more non- descript and less regional, makes him sound slightly more educated, while Sue's is much nearer to Received Pronunciation. Sue represents the middle class, being the ex-wife of an architect and living in one of the older houses on the street. She also brings a bottle of wine, and has not yet eaten, indicating that she is expecting dinner, as opposed to an extended evening of drinks. The others present have already had their \\"tea\\". Beverly and Laurence represent the aspirational lower middle class, and Tony and Angela‚Äîthe \\"new arrivals\\"‚Äîare also lower middle class, but Tony is less successful than Laurence. Despite their similar background, Laurence seeks to differentiate between himself and Tony by highlighting the differences in their general level of culture, and makes a couple of condescending comments directed at him, and/or for Sue's benefit. For example, Laurence shows off a leather-bound collected works of Shakespeare to Sue (which we know are unread), after pointedly asking Tony if he reads, insinuating that he does not. ==Critical response== In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, Abigail's Party was placed 11th. It also appeared in a Radio Times poll to find the top 40 greatest TV shows on British television, published in August 2003. Some critics, such as Tom Paulin, have responded more negatively, saying that Abigail's Party appears to represent a middle-class schadenfreude, with the only true middle-class character, Sue, looking on at the antics of the couples with disdain. Likewise, Dennis Potter wrote a critical review of the play in The Sunday Times, claiming that it was \\"based on nothing more edifying than rancid disdain, for it is a prolonged jeer, twitching with genuine hatred, about the dreadful suburban tastes of the dreadful lower middle classes\\". Leigh has rejected this, describing it as a tragi-comedy which is \\"sympathetic to all the characters, whatever their foibles, not least Beverly... The play is a lamentation, not a sneer\\". He has also argued that the characters (Beverly and Laurence in particular) reflected the real-life behaviour of aspiring couples in mid-1970s suburbia. Writing in The Independent in 2002, David Thomson noted that Beverley's naive storing of the beaujolais in the refrigerator had become standard practice: \\"The gaffe has turned suave.\\" ==Revival== The TV version was released on VHS in 1984 and DVD in 2003. The play was staged in London's West End in 2003 with Elizabeth Berrington as Beverly. It was revived in Wolverhampton at the Grand Theatre (2005), and at the Northcott Theatre in Exeter (2006). Interviewed in 2009, writer Leigh said: \\"Of course I recognise the enduring popularity of Abigail's Party. It still hits a nerve about the way we live. It's real even though it's apparently a heightened and comic play. It's a reflection of the realities of how we live on several different levels. It's about aspirationalism and materialism, love and relationships. Like much of my work, it's about the disease I call 'the done thing' ‚Äì basically, keeping up with the Joneses. It's actually quite a complex play. People may not analyse its complexity but it's so popular precisely for that reason.\\" In March 2012, a new revival of the play directed by Lindsay Posner opened at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London. Starring Jill Halfpenny as Beverly, Joe Absolom as Tony, Natalie Casey as Angela, Susannah Harker as Sue and Andy Nyman as Laurence, it subsequently transferred to Wyndham's Theatre in the West End. Commenting on the character, Halfpenny said, \\"To her mind Beverley isn't a monster and even warrants sympathy. \\"When you learn about her upbringing ‚Äì her mother and father haven't spoken to her for 20 years ‚Äì you see why a woman who's been brought up like that and carries so many insecurities could take them out on others.\\" In May 2013, Abigail's Party played at San Francisco Playhouse and received outstanding reviews. In March 2017, a new revival of Abigail's Party opened at the Theatre Royal Bath as a 40th anniversary production, starring Amanda Abbington as Beverly, Ciar√°n Owens as Tony, Charlotte Mills as Angela, Rose Keegan as Sue, and Ben Caplan as Laurence. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== *British Film Institute Screen Online * Category:1977 television plays Category:BBC television dramas Category:British television films Category:British films Category:Plays by Mike Leigh Category:Play for Today ","title":"Abigail's Party"},{"id":"305763","text":"Aris Christofellis (; born 5 February 1960) is a Greek sopranist (male soprano) and musicologist. ==Life and career== Aris Christofellis was born in Athens. After studying piano in Athens and Paris with several teachers including the famous pianist France Clidat, he decided to concentrate on developing his unique singing voice of male soprano, studying with Fofi Sarandopoulo. He made his debut in Bordeaux in 1984. In 1985 he sang Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Exsultate, jubilate at Cannes Midem Classique inauguration concert, where he was received enthusiastically by both the public and the critics. His repertoire extends from Renaissance to contemporary music, but he focuses on the Italian baroque opera of the 18th and early 19th century. Aris Christofellis' vocal technique and taste for historically informed ornaments have been highly acclaimed across the world and as a musicologist, he has brought to light many works of this period and has dealt in particular with the ornamentation of the vocal music of the 18th and 19th centuries. In addition to lieder and folk songs, he concentrates mainly on Baroque opera and is known for singing roles written for castrati. He maintains an extensive discography and his numerous recordings made for EMI Classics between the mid 1990s and early 2000 are of enormous importance for the rediscovery of the vocal music from the late Baroque and early Classic period. Since the end of the 1990s, Aris Christofellis reduced significantly his concert and opera performances and has started a successful career as a singing teacher in Greece and in several other countries, including Italy. ==References== == External links == * The World of the Castrati and Male Soprano * Ottone in villa * Aris Christofellis * Aris Christofellis sings H√§ndel Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Singers from Athens Category:Sopranists Category:Greek male singers Category:Greek opera singers Category:Greek musicologists Category:Voice teachers Category:20th-century Greek singers Category:20th-century opera singers Category:20th-century male singers ","title":"Aris Christofellis"},{"id":"305768","text":"The following is a list of notable poets of Slovak literature. == Renaissance (1500‚Äì1650) == * Martin Rakovsk√Ω (1535‚Äì1579) * Vavrinec Benedikt z Nedo≈æier (Laurentio Benedictino Nudozierino) (1555‚Äì1615) == Baroque (1650‚Äì1780) == * Juraj Tranovsk√Ω or Tranoscius (1592‚Äì1637) * Daniel Sinapius-Horƒçiƒçka (1640‚Äì1688) * Hugol√≠n Gavloviƒç (1712‚Äì1787) == Classicism (1780‚Äì1840) == * Pavel Jozef ≈†af√°rik (1795‚Äì1861) * J√°n Koll√°r (1793‚Äì1852) * J√°n Holl√Ω (1785‚Äì1849) == Romantism (1840‚Äì1850) == * ƒΩudov√≠t ≈†t√∫r (1815‚Äì1856) * Samo Chalupka (1812‚Äì1883) * Andrej Sl√°dkoviƒç (1820‚Äì1872) * Janko Kr√°ƒæ (1822‚Äì1876) * J√°n Botto (1829‚Äì1881) * Janko Mat√∫≈°ka (1821‚Äì1877) * Michal Miloslav Hod≈æa (1811‚Äì1870) == Realism (1875‚Äì1905) == * Pavol Orsz√°gh-Hviezdoslav (1849‚Äì1921) * Martin Kukuƒç√≠n (1860‚Äì1928) * Janko Jesensk√Ω (1874‚Äì1945) * ƒΩudmila Podjavorinsk√° (1872‚Äì1951) == Modernism (1905‚Äì1918) == * Ivan Krasko (1876‚Äì1958) * Janko Jesensk√Ω (1874‚Äì1945) == Between the World Wars (1918‚Äì1948) == * ≈†tefan Krƒçm√©ry (1892‚Äì1955) * Martin R√°zus (1888‚Äì1937) === Surrealism === * ≈†tefan ≈Ω√°ry (1918‚Äì2007) * J√°n Brezina (1917‚Äì1997) == Post-war period (1948‚Äì1960s) == == Contemporary (since the 1960s) == * Miroslav V√°lek (1927‚Äì1991) * Milan R√∫fus (1928‚Äì2009) * ƒΩubom√≠r Feldek (born 1936) * Milan Richter (born 1948) * Jana Kantorov√°-B√°likov√° (born 1950) * Juraj Kuniak (born 1955) * Dana Podrack√° (born 1954) * Viera Proke≈°ov√° (1957‚Äì2008) * Pavol Hud√°k (1959‚Äì2011) == Contemporary poetry (since 1995)== * Radovan Brenkus (born 1974) ==See also== *List of national poetries *Slovak prose == References == Slovak Poets sl:Slova≈°ka knji≈æevnost ","title":"List of Slovak poets"},{"id":"305778","text":"M.A.S.K.

It was animated in Japan by studios; KK DiC Asia (later known as KK C&D; Asia), Studio Juno, Studio World, and Ashi Productions. ==Overview== M.A.S.K. is a special task force led by Matt Trakker, who operate transforming armored vehicles in their ongoing battle against the criminal organization V.E.N.O.M. (an acronym for Vicious Evil Network of Mayhem) with an emphasis on superpowered helmets (called \\"masks\\") worn by the characters of both factions.

The first season consisted of 65 episodes, but the second season, whose theme centered around auto racing instead of crimefighting, lasted only ten episodes. ==Production== One of many cartoons produced during the 1980s as a vehicle for toy merchandising, M.A.S.K., was a hybrid of popular era cartoons G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero and The Transformers. When originally broadcast, M.A.S.K. was the first closed-captioned series to air in first-run syndication. ==Home video== Several episodes of the series were released under Karl-Lorimar's \\"Kideo Video\\" branding on VHS in the 1980s, with two episodes per tape. The \\"racing\\" second season was distributed by Tempest Video. In the United Kingdom, two releases titled M.A.S.K The Movie, and M.A.S.K The Movie II were released by Tempo Video, featuring episodes edited into a feature- length format. M.A.S.K. episodes have been released on DVD in three different regions. * USA: Shout! Factory acquired the Region 1 DVD rights and released a \\"Complete Series\\" set on August 9, 2011 containing only the episodes from the first season of the original series (65 episodes), as well as a separate 2-disc collection of the first 11 episodes, called \\"Volume 1\\" and released the same day. The second season, which consists of 10 episodes, are owned by Cookie Jar Entertainment and are not part of the acquisition. * UK: A single DVD set containing the first 5 episodes was released by Maximum Entertainment (under license from Jetix Europe) in August 2004. In November 2007, Maximum released Collection 1, containing the same number of episodes as the Australian set. Collection 1 was re-released on 31 August 2009, and Collection 2 was finally released on 28 September 2009. Both sets (the re-issue Collection 1 and Collection 2) are distributed through Lace DVD, replacing Maximum Entertainment, and both sets are in Region 2 PAL format. All 75 episodes were released across both sets. * Australia and New Zealand: Madman Entertainment released the complete series over two DVD collections for the first time in Australia and New Zealand. Collection 1 was released in November 2006 and contains episodes 1‚Äì38, Collection 2 was released in March 2007 and contains episodes 39‚Äì75 which includes the season 2 episodes. ==Reception== IGN voted M.A.S.K. the 99th-best animated series in 2009, calling it one of the most popular cartoon/toy marketing franchises of the 1980s, stating that it took many of the strengths of G.I. Joe and Transformers while taking few of their flaws. On the other hand, David Perlmutter in the 2018 The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows says, \\"Given that it was tied into a toy line produced by co-producer Kenner-Parker, the intent was clearly to showcase the weaponry and vehicles at the expense of anything deeper in terms of plotting and characterization. That being said, the series did manage to do the little it was asked to provide in advertising the toys.\\" ==In other media== On December 15, 2015, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Hasbro and Paramount were creating a movie universe combining Micronauts with G.I. Joe, Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light, M.A.S.K. and Rom. The Hollywood Reporter reported on April 21, 2016 that Michael Chabon, Brian K. Vaughan, Nicole Perlman, Lindsey Beer, Cheo Coker, John Francis Daley, Jonathan Goldstein, Joe Robert Cole, Jeff Pinkner, Nicole Riegel and Geneva Robertson- Dworet had joined the writers room. On April 18, 2018, it was announced that F. Gary Gray will direct the live-action movie. On February 28, 2020, Chris Bremner has been announced to pen the script. ==References* Albert Penello's MASK Page ‚Äì M.A.S.K. toy information and database * Matt-Trakker.com ‚Äì M.A.S.K. info website * Boulder-Hill.net ‚Äì M.A.S.K. toy and merchandise information Category:1985 Canadian television series debuts Category:1986 Canadian television series endings Category:1980s Canadian animated television series Category:1980s Canadian science fiction television series Category:American children's animated action television series Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated science fiction television series Category:French children's animated action television series Category:French children's animated adventure television series Category:French children's animated science fiction television series Category:Television series by DIC Entertainment Category:Animated television series about robots Category:Fictional military organizations Category:Flying cars in fiction Category:Masks in fiction Category:Action figures Category:Television shows adapted into comics Category:Comics based on toys Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States Category:English-language television shows ","title":"M.A.S.K.

The extant genus inhabits the river basins of South America, but the family formerly had a wider presence across the Atlantic Ocean. Iniidae are highly morphologically different from marine dolphins by way of adaptations suited to their freshwater riverine habitat. They also display a high amount of sexual dimorphism in the form of color and size.Martin, A. R., & Silva, V. M. (2006). Sexual Dimorphism And Body Scarring In The Boto (Amazon River Dolphin) Inia Geoffrensis. Marine Mammal Science,22(1), 25‚Äì33. Seasonal movement between flooded plains and rivers is common, due to the variation of seasonal rain.Rice, Dale W. \\"Marine mammals of the world, systematics and distribution.\\" Society for Marine Mammalogy Special Publication 4 (1998): 1-231. There has been little research done on the family, in particular the species aside from the Amazon river dolphin. ==Evolution== The South American river basins were flooded by marine waters, creating a new brackish habitat that allowed marine mammals to move into them. During the Miocene era, the sea level began to recede, trapping the mammals within the continent.Hamilton, Healy, et al. \\"Evolution of river dolphins.\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences 268.1466 (2001): 549-556. == Morphology == The Iniidae have adapted morphology common to freshwater riverine habitats. These adaptions include cervical vertebra that are not fused, allowing for a flexible neck. Also, their dorsal fins are highly reduced or absent so they do not become entangled in vegetation from the flooded terrestrial plains. Large, wide, paddle-like pectoral fins allow for maneuverability in small vegetated areas.Gomez-Salazar, C. (2011). Photo- Identification: A Reliable and Noninvasive Tool for Studying Pink River Dolphins (Inia geoffrensis). Aquatic Mammals,37(4), 472‚Äì485.

Iniidae have many characteristics common to their marine odontocete relatives. Their stomachs include a fore-stomach, singled chambered main stomach and a pyloric stomach with connecting channels. Also, Iniidae have lost their fur and lack true vocal cords.Kaiya, Zhou. \\"Classification and phylogeny of the Superfamily Platanistoidea, with notes on evidence of the monophyly of the Cetacea.\\" Sci.

They share the similar structure of the tympanic bulla and lung shape, the position of their diaphragm and the position of the blowhole to the back of the head with their marine ancestors. The dentition of Iniidae dolphins is heterodont, having conical, small teeth. The teeth extend lingually in the back and in the front they have a small depression on the side of each. These mammals are carnivorous, finding prey by using echolocation. ==Speciation== There is a debate on the number of species within the genus Inia. The main debate is whether there are two or three species and whether they can be considered sub-species. Inia geoffrensis, Inia humboldtiana and Inia boliviensis, according to certain scientists, are considered three separate species, while many consider I.geoffrensis and I. boliviensis to be the only two.Gravena, Waleska, et al. \\"Looking to the past and the future: were the Madeira River rapids a geographical barrier to the boto (Cetacea: Iniidae)?.\\" Conservation Genetics 15.3 (2014): 619‚Äì629.Ruiz- Garc√≠a, M., Banguera, E., & Cardenas, H.

In December 2014 its work was transferred to the programme called Future Earth, which was sponsored by the Science and Technology Alliance for Global Sustainability, comprising the International Council for Science (ICSU), the International Social Science Council (ISSC), the Belmont Forum of funding agencies, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations University (UNU) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). ==Diversitas mission == Biodiversity underpins the life-support system of our planet. Both natural and managed ecosystems deliver important ecological services such as the production of food and fibre, carbon storage, climate regulation and recreation opportunities. The program was established to address the complex scientific questions posed by the loss in biodiversity and ecosystem services and to offer science-based solutions to this crisis. The program is an international programme of biodiversity science with a dual mission: * Promoting, facilitating and conducting integrative biodiversity science, that links biological, ecological and social disciplines; and * Providing the sound scientific basis for decision making to secure the planet‚Äôs variety of life, while contributing to human well-being and poverty eradication. The program achieves its mission by: * Fostering an integrated network of the world‚Äôs leading biodiversity scientists to address critical biodiversity issues; * Producing new knowledge by catalysing exchanges between scientists across nations and disciplines; * Synthesising new biodiversity knowledge to address the global science priorities; * Ensuring an effective engagement of the biodiversity science community globally with policy and decision makers, especially with relevant international conventions; * Developing biodiversity science capacity by nurturing younger scientists around the world. The international Secretariat is based in Paris, France (hosted by the French National Museum of Natural History - Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN)), while the different core projects are based all around the world. ==Diversitas history == === Phase 1 (1991-2001): Biodiversity gains attention on the global scale === The program was established in 1991 by three international organizations: the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE) and the International Union of Biological Science (IUBS), at the time the need to address the complex scientific questions posed by the loss of and change in global biodiversity was identified. The goal of the initiative was to develop an international, non-governmental umbrella programme for research projects. In 1996, the program welcomed two new sponsors, the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the International Union of Microbiological Societies (IUMS). The key findings during its first decade were synthesised in a series of books and laid the groundwork for experimental and theoretical research carried out by the program and the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP). These findings also contributed to the Global Biodiversity Assessment, an initiative of the World Resources Institute (WRI), and to the work of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), established in 1992, and with which Diversitas has a Memorandum of Understanding. === Phase 2 (2002-2011): An international framework for biodiversity science === In 2001, the program organised an international consultation of its stakeholders on the need to launch a second phase of the programme. The conclusions of this consultation were in favour of launching a second phase, which would be more integrative and inter- disciplinary, and more policy relevant. The new science Plan was published in 2002. To implement this science plan, nine projects were established embracing a cycle of discovery, observation, analysis, and information sharing, on overarching scientific questions on biodiversity and related ecosystem services: * Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP) ‚Äì a project aiming at preventing and managing invasive species * Global Mountain Biodiversity Assessment (GMBA) ‚Äì a project aiming at exploring and understanding mountain biodiversity * ‚Äì a project aiming at providing an evolutionary framework for biodiversity science * ‚Äì a project aiming at assessing, monitoring, and predicting biodiversity change * ‚Äì a project aiming at exploring the links between biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and services * ‚Äì a project aiming at building adaptive governance and management of ecosystem services * ‚Äì a project aiming at developing a new science agenda for biodiversity in support of sustainable agro-ecosystems * ‚Äì a project aiming at exploring links between biodiversity and emerging infectious diseases * ‚Äì a project aiming at developing a new science agenda for biodiversity in support of sustainable freshwater ecosystems In addition to these scientific projects, the program has been strongly engaged in the Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP), a partnership for the integrated study of the Earth System, the ways that it is changing, and the implications for global and regional sustainability. During this second phase, the program continued its engagement in serving policy fora, and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), in particular. The program organized its first Open Science Conference in Oaxaca, Mexico, in October 2005, where the scientific community reiterated its support for the establishment of a scientific panel on biodiversity that included an intergovernmental component (cf. International Mechanism of Scientific Expertise on Biodiversity (IMoSEB )) and its second Open Science Conference in Cape Town, South Africa, in October 2009; the Cape Town conference attracted an international audience of 700 scientists and policy makers from about 70 countries representing many facets of biodiversity science and policy. === Phase 3 (2012-2020): Biodiversity and ecosystem services science for a sustainable planet === Since mid-2009, and in the light of the changes in the biodiversity science-policy landscape, the program has been engaged in a phase of reviewing its activities and revising its 2002 Science Plan. The new science Plan was published in 2012. During this on-going phase, the program has been or is being strongly involved in: * the establishment of a global observing system for biodiversity, called GEO BON - Group on Earth Observations - Biodiversity Observation Network. GEO BON represents the biodiversity component of the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) under the auspices of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), * the consultation on an Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) which was launched in April 2012, * the launch of the new scientific initiative Future Earth: research towards sustainability, which was launched at Rio+20, * the Planet Under Pressure conference in 2012, and * the Rio+20 conference in 2012. ==References== ==External links== * Diversitas official website Category:Biology organizations Category:Biodiversity Category:1991 establishments in France Category:Organizations based in Paris ","title":"Diversitas"},{"id":"305819","text":"Olivenza () or Oliven√ßa () is a town situated on a disputed section of the Portugal‚ÄìSpain border.

The town of Oliven√ßa was under Portuguese sovereignty between 1297 (Treaty of Alca√±ices) and 1801, when it was invaded by the Spanish during the War of the Oranges and ceded to Spain that year under the Treaty of Badajoz. Spain has since administered the territory (now split into two municipalities, Olivenza and also T√°liga), whilst Portugal invokes the self-revocation of the Treaty of Badajoz, plus the Treaty of Vienna of 1815, to claim the return of the territory.

The territory is triangular, with a smaller side resting on the Guadiana and the opposite vertex entering south-east and surrounded by Spanish territory. By an agreement between Spain and Portugal, the left bank of the river was recognized as being Portuguese territory (to a non-defined width, though), which sets the de facto border in that area. Besides the town, the municipality of Olivenza includes six villages: (), (), (), (), (), and (). Another village, , was detached to become the seat of a separate municipality in 1850.

Some monuments include the church of Saint Mary of the Castle (, ), Holy Ghost Chapel (, ), Saint Mary Magdalene Church (, , considered a masterwork of Portuguese Manueline architecture), Saint John of God Monastery (, ), the keep (, ), and the ruins of the Our Lady of Help Bridge (, , destroyed in 1709 and never rebuilt). There are still traces of Portuguese culture and language in the people, although the younger generations speak Spanish only. At the beginning of the 1940s the city was reportedly mainly Portuguese-speaking, but after the 1940s a language shift towards Spanish took place. ==Chronology== Manueline door of Olivenza town hall Ruins of 16th-century Ponte da Ajuda over the Guadiana, in the ancient road between Elvas and Olivenza Part of an 18th-century Spanish map, showing Olivenza as part of Portugal Portuguese late Gothic-style interior of Santa Maria Madalena church *1170 ‚Äì Olivenza region falls for the first time into Portuguese hands during the conquests of Afonso Henriques, the first king of Portugal. *1189 ‚Äì Muslims retake the region. *1230 ‚Äì The Olivenza area (as part of the Badajoz surroundings) is taken from the Muslims by King Alfonso IX of Le√≥n. *1259 ‚Äì The Knights Templar already established in the nearby town of Alconchel, create the first settlement that can be identified as the origin of the town of Olivenza.

During the War of the Oranges, French and Spanish troops, under the command of Manuel de Godoy, took the town on May 20, 1801. In the aftermath of that conflict, the Treaty of Badajoz was signed, with the Olivenza territory remaining a part of Spain. Spain claims ‚Äòde jure‚Äô sovereignty over Olivenza on the grounds that the Treaty of Badajoz still stands and has never been revoked, thus making the case that the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be demarcated as said by the treaty. Portugal claims de jure sovereignty over Olivenza on the grounds of the cancellation of the Treaty of Badajoz, since it was revoked by its own terms. The breach of any of its articles would lead to its cancellation, and that happened when Spain invaded Portugal in the Peninsular War of 1807. Portugal further bases its case on Article 105 of the Treaty of Vienna of 1815 (which Spain signed in 1817) that states that the winning countries are \\"committed to employ the mightiest conciliatory effort to return Olivenza to Portuguese authority\\" and that the winning countries \\"recognize that the return of Olivenza and its territories must be done\\". Thus, the border between the two countries in the region of Olivenza should be demarcated by the Treaty of Alcanizes of 1297. Spain interprets Article 105 as not being mandatory on demanding Spain to return Olivenza to Portugal, thus not revoking the Treaty of Badajoz. Portugal has never made a formal claim to the territory after the Treaty of Vienna, but neither has it directly acknowledged Spanish sovereignty over Olivenza. Portuguese military maps do not show the border at that area, implying it to be undefined. Also, the latest road connection between Olivenza and Portugal (entirely paid by the Portuguese state, although it involved the building of a bridge over the Guadiana, an international river) has no indication of the Portuguese border, again implying an undefined status. There is no research on the opinion of the inhabitants of Olivenza about their status. Spanish public opinion is not generally aware of the Portuguese claim on Olivenza. On the other hand, awareness in Portugal has been increasing under the efforts of pressure groups to have the question raised and debated in public. == Famous people born in Olivenza == * Guillermo Fern√°ndez Vara (1958) ‚Äì Spanish politician, president of Extremadura. * Pedro da Fonseca (?‚Äì1422) ‚Äì Portuguese cardinal. * Paulo da Gama (1465-1499), Vasco da Gama's elder brother, commander of S√£o Rafael in the discovery of the route to India. * Vicente Lusitano (c. 1461 ‚Äì c. 1561) ‚Äì Portuguese composer and music theoretician. * Tom√°s Romero de Castilla (1833‚Äì1910) ‚Äì Spanish theologian, founder of the Museo Arqueol√≥gico Provincial de Badajoz. ==References== ==External links== *CIA World Factbook reference to Olivenza in the \\"Disputes ‚Äì international\\" section on the Spain page * Official Map of Portugal with Olivenza IGEOE *Official Portuguese statements GAO *CIA World Factbook reference to Oliven√ßa in the \\"Disputes ‚Äì international\\" section on the Portugal page * Olivenza in the official website of the Province of Badajoz * Olivenza in the official website for Tourism in the Region of Extremadura * Website for Portuguese pressure group \\"Group of Friends of Olivenza\\" * Portuguese, Spanish Website for Oliventino cultural group Alemguadiana Category:Municipalities in the Province of Badajoz Category:Portugal‚ÄìSpain border Category:Territorial disputes of Portugal Category:Territorial disputes of Spain Category:Municipalities of √âvora District ","title":"Olivenza"},{"id":"305842","text":"Juris Hartmanis (born July 5, 1928) is a prominent computer scientist and computational theorist who, with Richard E.

The Megali Idea () was an irredentist concept that expressed the goal of reviving the Byzantine Empire,Roumen Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov, Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies; BRILL, 2013; , p. 200. by establishing a Greek state, which would include the large Greek populations that were still under Ottoman rule after the end of the Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì1828) and all the regions that traditionally belonged to Greeks since ancient times (parts of the Southern Balkans, Asia Minor and Cyprus).\\"Introduction: Greece\\" The term appeared for the first time during the debates of Prime Minister Ioannis Kolettis with King Otto that preceded the promulgation of the 1844 constitution.History of Greece Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online It came to dominate foreign relations and played a significant role in domestic politics for much of the first century of Greek independence. The expression was new in 1844 but the concept had roots in the Greek popular psyche, which long had hopes of liberation from Ottoman rule and restoration of the Byzantine Empire. > Œ†Œ¨ŒªŒπ ŒºŒµ œáœÅœåŒΩŒπŒ± ŒºŒµ Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅŒøœçœÇ, :œÄŒ¨ŒªŒπ Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ¨ ŒºŒ±œÇ Œ∏Œ± 'ŒΩŒ±Œπ! (Once more, as years and > time go by, once more they shall be ours).D. Bolukbasi and D. B√∂l√ºkba≈üƒ±, > Turkey And Greece: The Aegean Disputes, Routledge Cavendish 2004 The Megali Idea implied the goal of reviving the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, by establishing a Greek state, which would be, as ancient geographer Strabo wrote, a Greek world encompassing mostly the former Byzantine lands from the Ionian Sea to the west, to Asia Minor and the Black Sea to the east and from Thrace, Macedonia and Epirus to the north, to Crete and Cyprus to the south. This new state would have Constantinople as its capital: it would be the \\"Greece of Two Continents and Five Seas\\" (Europe and Asia, the Ionian, Aegean, Marmara, Black and Libyan Seas, respectively). The Megali Idea dominated foreign policy and domestic politics of Greece from the War of Independence in the 1820s through the Balkan wars in the beginning of the 20th century. It started to fade after the defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922) and the Great Fire of Smyrna in 1922, followed by the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. Despite the end of the Megali Idea project in 1922, the Greek state expanded five times in its history, either through military conquest or diplomacy (often with British support). After the creation of Greece in 1830, it later annexed the Ionian Islands (Treaty of London, 1864), Thessaly (Convention of Constantinople (1881)), Macedonia, Crete, (southern) Epirus and the Eastern Aegean Islands (Treaty of Bucharest (1913)), Western Thrace (Treaty of Neuilly, 1920) and the Dodecanese (Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947), making them Greek territory. A related concept that continues to the present day is Enosis. ==History== ===Fall of Constantinople=== Mehmed II's entry into Constantinople. The Byzantine Empire was Roman in origin and was called the \\"Roman Empire\\" by its inhabitants and the entire world, until some 120 years after its fall, when Hieronymus Wolf coined the usage of \\"Byzantium\\". It became Hellenistic with time to the point where Greek replaced Latin as the official language in AD 610, owing to several factors: Its religion, being Christian, with the New Testament written in Greek; its location in the Greek-speaking realm and sphere of influence; and the fact that, following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it became the eastern continuation of the Roman Empire. Byzantium held out against the invasions of the centuries with a vitality that the Western Roman Empire lost, repelling the Visigoths, the Huns, the Saracens, the Mongols and finally the Turks (during the first siege). Constantinople, the capital of Byzantium, fell to the Fourth Crusaders in the early years of the 13th century. The city was eventually liberated by the Empire of Nicaea, a Byzantine successor, and the Empire was restored. However, the city fell to a different foe in 1453‚Äîthe Ottoman Turks‚Äîand this fall of Constantinople marked the nadir of Byzantine civilization; the city was comprehensively sacked and looted, and the Hagia Sophia was turned into a mosque. Following the conquest of Constantinople, the capture of the remainder of the Byzantine territories was easily accomplished by the Ottomans. === Greeks under Ottoman rule=== Ethnic map of Asia Minor in 1910 The Millet system which was in force during the Ottoman Empire, the population was classified according to religion rather than language or ethnicity. Orthodox Greeks were seen as part of the millet-i R√ªm (literally \\"Roman community\\") which included all Orthodox Christians, including beside Greeks also Bulgarians, Serbs, Vlachs, Slavs, Georgians, Romanians and Albanians, despite their differences in ethnicity and language and despite the fact that the religious hierarchy was Greek dominated. It is not clear to what extent one can speak of a Greek identity during those times as opposed to a Christian or Orthodox identity. In the late 1780s, Catherine II of Russia and Joseph II of Austria intended to reclaim the Byzantine heritage and restore the Greek statehood as part of their joint Greek Plan. It is notable that during the Middle Ages and the Ottoman period, Greek-speaking Christians identified as Romans and thought of themselves as the descendants of the Roman Empire (including the medieval Eastern Roman Empire). Indeed, the term Roman was often interpreted as synonymous with Christian throughout Europe and the Mediterranean during this time. The terms Greek or Hellene were largely seen by Ottoman Christians as referring to the ancient pagan peoples of the region. This, however, changed during the late stages of the Ottoman Empire and the emergence of the Greek independence movement. ===Greek War of Independence and later=== After the Greek War of Independence ended in 1829, a new southern Greek state was established, with assistance from the United Kingdom, France and Imperial Russia. However, this new Greek state under John Capodistria after the Greek War of Independence was, with Serbia, one of the only two countries of the era whose population was smaller than the population of the same ethnicity outside its borders; most of ethnic Greeks still resided within the borders of Ottoman Empire. This version of Greece was designed by the Great Powers, who had no desire to see a larger Greek state supplant the Ottoman Empire. The Great Idea embodied a desire to bring all ethnic Greeks into the Greek state, and subsequently revive the Byzantine Empire; specifically those Greeks in Epirus, Thessaly, Macedonia, Thrace, the Aegean Islands, Crete, Cyprus, parts of Anatolia, and the city of Constantinople, which would replace Athens as capital. When the young Danish prince Wilhelm Georg was elected king in 1863, the title offered to him by the Greek National Assembly was not \\"King of Greece\\", the title of his deposed predecessor, King Otto; but rather \\"King of the Hellenes\\". Implicit in the wording was that George I was to be king of all Greeks, regardless of whether they then lived within the borders of his new kingdom. The first areas to be incorporated into the Kingdom were the Ionian islands in 1864, and later Thessaly with the Treaty of Berlin (1878). ===Revolts, Cretan crisis and Greco-Turkish War (1897)=== Constantine I of Greece was called Constantine XII by his supporters, the legitimate successor to the Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos Eleftherios Venizelos tried to realize the Megali Idea In January 1897, violence and disorder were escalating in Crete, polarizing the population. Massacres of the Christian population took place in Chania and Rethimno. The Greek government, pressured by public opinion, intransigent political elements, extreme nationalist groups (e.g. Ethniki Etairia) and with the Great Powers reluctant to intervene, decided to send warships and personnel to assist the Cretans. The Great Powers had no option then but to proceed with the occupation of the island, but they were too late. A Greek force of 1,500 men had landed at Kolymbari on 1 February 1897, and its commanding officer, Colonel Timoleon Vassos, declared that he was taking over the island \\"in the name of the King of the Hellenes\\" and that he was announcing the union of Crete with Greece. This led to an uprising that spread immediately throughout the island. The Great Powers finally decided to land their troops and stopped the Greek army force from approaching Chania. At the same time their fleets blockaded Crete, preventing both Greeks and Turks from bringing any more troops to the island. The Ottoman Empire, in reaction to the rebellion of Crete and the assistance sent by Greece, relocated a significant part of its army in the Balkans to the north of Thessaly, close to the borders with Greece. Greece in reply reinforced its borders in Thessaly. However, irregular Greek forces and followers of the Megali Idea acted without orders and raided Turkish outposts, leading the Ottoman Empire to declare war on Greece; the war is known as the Greco-Turkish War of 1897. The Turkish army, far outnumbering the Greek, was also better prepared, due to the recent reforms carried out by a German mission under Baron von der Goltz. The Greek army fell back in retreat. The other Great Powers then intervened and an armistice was signed in May 1897. The war, however, only ended in December of that year. The military defeat of Greece in the Greco-Turkish war cost it small territorial losses along the border line in northern Thessaly, and a large sum of financial reparations that wrecked Greece's economy for years, while giving no lasting solution to the Cretan Question. The Great Powers (Britain, France, Russia, and Italy) in order to prevent future clashes and trying to avoid the creation of a revanchist climate in Greece, imposed what they thought of as the final solution on the Cretan Question: Crete was proclaimed an autonomous Cretan State. The four Great Powers assumed the administration of Crete; and, in a decisive diplomatic victory for Greece, Prince George of Greece (second son of King George I) became High Commissioner. ===Early 20th century=== Balkan Wars Greek claims in Epirus and Macedonia after the first Balkan war Poster celebrating the \\"New Hellas\\" after the Balkan Wars. A major proponent of the Megali Idea was Eleftherios Venizelos, under whose leadership Greek territory doubled in the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì13 ‚Äî southern Epirus, Crete, Lesbos, Chios, Ikaria, Samos, Samothrace, Lemnos and the majority of Macedonia were attached to Greece. Born and raised in Crete, in 1909 Venizelos was already a prominent Cretan and had influence in mainland Greece. As such, he was invited after the Goudi coup in 1909 by the Military League to become Prime Minister of Greece. A proponent of the Megali Idea, Venizelos pressed forward a series of reforms in society, as well as the military and administration, which helped Greece succeed in its goals during the Balkan Wars. World War I Map of Megali Hellas after the Treaty of S√®vres and featuring a picture of Eleftherios Venizelos. Following the Greek gains in the Balkan Wars, the Ottomans began to persecute ethnic Greeks living in the Empire, which led to ethnic cleansing in the Greek genocide. This persecution continued into World War I when the Ottomans declared for the Central Powers on late 1914. Greece remained neutral until 1917 when they joined the Allies. Refugees reports of Turkish atrocities as well as the Allied victory in World War I seemed to promise an even greater realization of the Megali Idea. Greece gained territory in Asia Minor the administration of Smyrna and its hinterland as a protectorate for five years, after with a referendum could decide whether it would remain in the Ottoman Empire or join Greece. Greece also gained the islands of Imbros and Tenedos, Western and Eastern Thrace, the border then drawn a few miles from the walls of Constantinople. Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922) and the end of the Megali Idea Greek soldiers in Smyrna, May 1919. Greece's efforts to take control of Smyrna in accordance with the Treaty of S√®vres were thwarted by Turkish revolutionaries, who were resisting the Allies. The Turks defeated and expelled the Greeks from Anatolia during the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) (part of the Turkish War of Independence). The war was concluded by the Treaty of Lausanne which saw Greece lose Eastern Thrace, Imbros and Tenedos, Smyrna and the possibility of staying in Anatolia. To avoid any further territorial claims, both Greece and Turkey engaged in an \\"exchange of populations\\": During the conflict, 151,892 Greeks had already fled Asia Minor. The Treaty of Lausanne moved 1,104,216 Greeks from Turkey,Andr√© Billy, La Gr√®ce, Arthaud, 1937, p. 188. while 380,000 Turks left the Greek territory for Turkey. This followed other so-called population exchanges after World War I, including 40,027 Greeks from Bulgaria, 58,522 from Russia (because of the defeat of Wrangel) and 10,080 from other lands (for example Dodecanese or Albania), while 70,000 Bulgarians from Thrace and Macedonia had moved to Bulgaria.The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine led to an exchange of 50,000 Greeks for 70,000 Bulgarians between the two countries. For more see: Rutsel Silvestre, J. Martha; The Financial Obligation in International Law, Oxford University Press, 2015; , p. 70. From the Bulgarian refugees ca. 66,000 were from Greek Macedonia.\\"The second wave of Bulgarian refugees took place in the 1920s, following the signing of the Neilly Treaty (1919) concerning the so-called \\"voluntary\\" exchange of population between Greece and Bulgaria. Of them 66,126 people from Greek Macedonia.\\" For more see: Victor Roudometof, Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian Question; Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002 , p. 97. The immediate reception of refugees to Greece cost 45 million francs, so the League of Nations arranged for a loan of 150 million francs to aid settlement of refugees. In 1930, Venizelos even went on an official visit to Turkey, where he proposed that Mustafa Kemal be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The Greek novelist Yiorgos Theotokas described the psychological impact of the defeat of 1922: > \\"For a short time, while the Treaty of Serves ran its joyful but uncertain > course, it seemed to them that the...long-buried hopes of their ancestors > were to be fulfilled.

Thus, after his coup d'√©tat of 4 August 1936, Ioannis Metaxas proclaimed the advent of the \\"Third Hellenic Civilization\\", similar to Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.R. Clogg, p. 118. The attack by Italy from Albania and the Greek victories enabled Greece to conquer, during the winter of 1940‚Äì1941, parts of southern Albania (Northern Epirus, as it is identified by Greeks) which were administered as a province of Greece for a short time until the German offensive of April 1941. The occupation, resistance and the civil war initially put the Great Idea in the background. Nevertheless, another very good diplomatic performance by the Greek side at the Paris Peace Conference, 1946 secured a further enlargement of Greek territory, in the form of the Dodecanese Islands, despite the very strong opposition of Vyacheslav Molotov and the Soviet delegates.K. Svolopoulos, Greek Foreign Policy 1945‚Äì1981, p. 134. The Greek civil war, such as the Soviet opposition was also the main reason for the non incorporation of the Northern Epirus, since Albania was, after WWII, communist controlled. The British colony of Cyprus became the \\"apple of discord\\" between the two countries, puting an end to the great greco-turkish relations since the Kemal- Venizelos agreement (1930s). In 1955, a Greek army colonel of Greek Cypriot origin, George Grivas, began a campaign of civil disobedience whose purpose was primarily to drive the British from the island, then move for Enosis with Greece. The Greek Prime Minister, Alexandros Papagos, was not unfavourable to this idea. There was increasing polarisation of opinion between the dominant Greek population and the minority Turks. The problems in Cyprus affected the continent itself. In September 1955, in response to the demand for √ânosis, an anti-Greek riot took place in Istanbul. During the Istanbul Pogrom 4,000 stores, 100 hotels and restaurants and 70 churches were destroyed or damaged.R. Clogg, p. 153. This led to the last great wave of migration from Turkey to Greece. Turkish-occupied north and government controlled south. The Z√ºrich Agreement of 1959 culminated in independence of the island with Greece, Turkey and UK as guarantee powers. The inter-ethnic clashes from 1960 led to the dispatch of a peacekeeping force of the United Nations in 1964. The Cyprus issue was revived by the dictatorship of the colonels, who presented their April 21, 1967, coup d'√©tat as the only way to defend the traditional values of what they called the \\"Hellenic-Christian Civilization\\". Brigadier General Ioannidis arranged, in July 1974, to overthrow Cypriot President Archbishop Makarios, and proceed to Enosis with Greece. This led to an immediate reaction from Turkey to stop the ethnic cleansing against the Turkish minority. Turkey invaded the north part of the island. Greece and Turkey moved to a general mobilization and there was a well-founded fear of an imminent war between the two countries. ==Today== Today, there is no significant population of Greeks in Turkey, due to the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the Istanbul pogrom and the deportation of the Greeks from Istanbul in 1964. There are several extant Greek‚ÄìTurkish border disputes, most notably taking place at Imia. Relations between Greece and Turkey improved after the Greek aid sent after the 1999 ƒ∞zmit earthquake and the Turkish aid sent after the 1999 Athens earthquake. This period of mutual reconciliation is known as the earthquake diplomacy, and Greco-Turkish relations have been more cordial since then. The nationalist Golden Dawn party, which has had a recent surge in electoral support, supports the Megali Idea. == See also == * Greek diaspora * Northern Epirus * Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus * Greece during World War I * Occupation of Constantinople * Irredentism * Zone of Smyrna * Republic of Pontus * Greek genocide * Georgios Grivas * Foreign relations of Greece * Greek Plan * Enosis * Succession of the Roman Empire ==References== Category:National unifications Category:Foreign relations of Greece Category:Greece‚ÄìTurkey relations Category:History of modern Greece Category:19th century in the Ottoman Empire Category:Irredentism Category:Greek nationalism Category:Nationalist movements in Europe Category:Pan-nationalism Category:Political history of Greece Category:Political movements of the Ottoman Empire Category:Anti-Turkism ","title":"Megali Idea"},{"id":"305850","text":"Alexey Yakovlevich Chervonenkis (; 7 September 1938 ‚Äì 22 September 2014) was a Soviet and Russian mathematician, and, with Vladimir Vapnik, was one of the main developers of the Vapnik‚ÄìChervonenkis theory, also known as the \\"fundamental theory of learning\\" an important part of computational learning theory.

Its cognomen comes from Deiotarus, a Celtic king of Galatia. Its emblem is unknown. == Legion history == === Origin of the legion === The legion was levied by Deiotarus, king of the Celtic tribe of the Tolistobogii, who lived in Galatia, modern Turkey. Deiotarus became an ally of the Roman Republic's general Pompey in 63 BC, who named him king of all the Celtic tribes of Asia minor, which were collectively known as Galatians (hence the name Galatia for the region). Deiotarus levied an army and trained it with Roman help; the army, in 48 BC, was composed of 12,000 infantrymen and 2,000 horsemen. Cicero writes that the army was divided into thirty cohortes, which were roughly equivalent to three Roman legions of the time. This army supported the Romans in their wars against king Mithridates VI of Pontus, and contributed to Roman victory in the Third Mithridatic War. After a heavy defeat against king Pharnaces II of Pontus near Nicopolis, the surviving soldiers of Deiotarius army formed a single legion, which marched besides Julius Caesar during his victorious campaign against Pontus, and fought with him in the battle of Zela (47 BC). === Early history (BC) === When the Roman Empire integrated the Galatian kingdom, this legion, which had been trained by the Romans and had fought under Roman commanders, became part of the Roman army; since Caesar Augustus had already 21 legions, the legion received the number XXII. Augustus sent the Twenty-second to camp in Nicopolis (next Alexandria, in Aegyptus) together with III Cyrenaica. These two legions had the role of garrisoning the Egyptian province from threats both within and without, given the multi-ethnic nature of Alexandria. In 26 BC, Aelius Gallus, praefectus Aegypti (prefectus of Egypt), led a campaign against the Nubian kingdoms and another to find Arabia Felix (Yemen). The campaign came quickly to a halt (25 BC) because of the heavy losses in the troops (Romans, Hebrews and Nabateans), due to hunger and epidemics. The losses were not recovered, so in 23 BC the Nubians, led by queen Candace Amanirenas, took the initiative and attacked the Romans moving towards Elephantine. The new prefectus of Egypt, Gaius Petronius, obtained reinforcements, and after blocking the Nubians, marched up the Nile to the Nubian capital of Napata, which was sacked in 22 BC. It is highly probable that XXII fought in these wars. After this actions, the Nubian front remained calm for a long time, so the legions could be employed otherwise. The legionaries were used not only as soldiers, but also as workers, as some of them were sent to the granite mines of Mons Claudianus. Other legionaries were sent in the deepest south of the Egyptian province and scratched their names on the stones of the Colossi of Memnon. === Later history === Under Nero, the Romans fought a campaign (55-63) against the Parthian Empire, which had invaded the kingdom of Armenia, allied to the Romans. After gaining Armenia in 60 and losing it in 62, the Romans sent XV Apollinaris from Pannonia to Cn. Domitius Corbulo, legatus of Syria. Corbulo, with the legions XV Apollinaris, III Gallica, V Macedonica, X Fretensis and XXII, forced Vologases I of Parthia to a compromise peace in 63, whereby his brother Tiridates would become king of Armenia as a Roman client. In 66, Zealot Jews killed the Roman garrison in Jerusalem. After the ignominious defeat of the legatus of Syria in 66, T. Flavius Vespasianus entered in Iudaea in 67 with the legions V Macedonica, X Fretensis, XV Apollinaris, one vexillatio of 1,000 legionaries of the XXII, and 15,000 soldiers from the Eastern allies, and started the siege of Jerusalem in 69, which would be completed by his son T. Flavius Vespasianus (better known as Titus) in 70. In fact in 69, the \\"year of the four emperors\\", Flavius Vespasianus senior returned to Italy to conquer the imperial throne after Galba's rebellion and Nero's death. The Twenty-second sided with Flavius Vespasianus, who eventually became emperor. Under Trajan, XXII is officially known as Deiotariana, even if this was its unofficial name since Claudian times. Demise of Legio XXII Deiotariana is an historical issue. The last record of XXII Deiotariana is from 119. In 145, when a list of all existing legions was made, XXII Deiotariana was not listed. It is possible XXII Deiotariana suffered serious losses during the Jewish rebellion of Simon bar Kokhba.L. J. F.

Until 2020 it was also active in general retail business through Real division, which was sold to an investor consortium. Unlike American warehouse clubs such as Costco or Sam's Club, it is not possible for private customers to acquire a membership for most Metro locations. As of 2020 it operates around 670 stores in 24 countries in Europe and Asia. The company was established in 1964 by Ernst Schmidt and Wilhelm Schmidt-Ruthenbeck. In 2010, it was the fourth- largest retailer in the world measured by revenues, after Wal-Mart, Carrefour and Tesco. Its current incarnation was launched in 2017 as a spun-off of old Metro AG, which continued to be a consumer electronics retailer and renamed itself Ceconomy. ==History== The history of the Metro began on November 8, 1963 in Essen with the opening of the first wholesale center under the name Metro by the brothers Ernst Schmidt and Wilhelm Schmidt-Ruthenbeck. Planning and opening of the first hypermarket under the name Metro in Essen was the responsibility of Walter Vieth, who was managing director there from 1963 to 1970. In 1964, a year after the opening of the first Metro store, the St√∂cker & Reinshagen company (the Schell family) planned a cash and carry store in M√ºlheim an der Ruhr. During the construction phase, the businessmens Schmidt- Ruthenbeck, Schmidt and Schell met and decided to merge their cash and carry activities. So they founded Metro-SB-Gro√ümarkt GmbH & Co. KG with headquarters in M√ºlheim, later in D√ºsseldorf. In 1966, the third Metro was opened in West Berlin. In 1967, through a partnership with the Dutch company SHV Holdings (Steenkolen Handels-Vereeniging), a wholesale center opened in Utrecht, the Netherlands under the name makro. In 1980, Metro took over 24.9 percent of Kaufhof. In March 1996, Metro AG was formed by the merger of Metro Cash & Carry with Kaufhof Holding AG, Deutsche SB-Kauf AG (of the insolvent company co op AG), and Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus AG (emerged from Allgemeine Saar Konsum, in which a Metro investment company had previously held shares). The group also included the Huma shopping centers, the sports retail stores Primus Sportwelt, MHB Handel AG and the office supplies and stationery manufacturer Pelikan, as well as Media-Saturn, the consumer electronics business of Media Markt and Saturn. The share of Metro AG was founded retrospectively on January 1 and listed on July 22, 1996 on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and was part of the DAX until 2012. In 1998, the computer retailers Vobis and Maxdata, the Adler fashion stores and Reno's shoe retailers, the discounter TiP, M√∂bel Roller and unprofitable Kaufhof branches were brought into the subsidiary Divaco, which was founded together with Deutsche Bank and the Gerling Group, in order to attract new buyers. In December 2003, Metro separated from its stake in Divaco KG and sold its shares to the sole shareholder and CEO, Siegfried Kaske, for 1 euro. In 2004, Metro bought Adler fashion stores back from Divaco. Also in 1998, the 94 Allkauf -S department stores were bought, as was Allkauf Touristik Vertriebs GmbH with 160 travel agencies, which were sold again by Metro. In 2005, Metro split off the Praktiker home improvement division, which went public as an independent company. In July 2006 Metro bought the 85 German stores of Wal-Mart, which gave up its loss-making Germany business. The Wal-Mart stores were largely integrated into the Real sales brand. In July 2008, the Extra supermarket chain with around 250 locations and sales of around 1.6 billion euro, was sold to the Rewe Group. Metro sold the Adler fashion stores to the associated company BluO in February 2009. In November 2012, Metro sold its 91 Real hypermarkets in Poland, Romania, Russia and Ukraine to Auchan for 1.1 billion euro. In 2014 Metro sold the 12 hypermarkets in Turkey. In 2017 Metro sold the last remaining four hypermarkets in Romania. On June 15, 2015, Metro AG agreed to sell Galeria Kaufhof to Canadian retail conglomerate Hudson's Bay Company for $3.2 billion. On March 30, 2016, Metro Group announced that it will be splitting into two independent companies: A spin-off of the wholesale and food sector of Metro AG will be responsible for the group divisions into two independent and publicly listed companies. Both will have their own management, supervisory board and independent company profiles. Metro AG was renamed Ceconomy, comprising Media Markt and Saturn electronics stores, while a new company with the name Metro AG was formed, comprising Metro Cash & Carry and Real. In September 2018, Metro announced that it wanted to sell the Real hypermarket subsidiary in Germany to focus entirely on wholesale business. In February 2020, Real was sold to the German-Russian consortium of X-Bricks and SCP Group. The deal was completed in June 2020.https://www.delimarketnews.com/buyside-news/metro- completes-sale-real-moves-toward-becoming-purely-wholesale-company-Olaf- Koch/kayla-webb/tue-06302020-0851/9967 ==Wholesale Operations== Metro Cash and Carry logo Metro store in Moscow, Russia The company operates wholesale stores, primarily under the Metro brand, in Europe, India, Japan, Kazahstan, Myanmar and Pakistan. In Belgium, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Czech Republic, it operates stores under the Makro brand, which were acquired entirely from SHV Holdings in 1998. Belgium is the only country where non- business membership stores are operated, with 6 branches under the Makro brand. There are also 10 Metro stores for business members. ===Former Wholesale Operations=== In 2010, Metro sold the Makro subsidiary in Morocco. Metro sold in 2012 its 30 Makro stores in the United Kingdom to Booker Group. Metro opened the first store in 1971 in the Copenhagen suburb of Glostrup. Denmark was one of the first countries to begin operating delivery services out of the stores and had its own truck fleet that covered all of Denmark. Metro sold the 5 stores in Denmark in December 2014. In 2014, Metro sold the 9 Makro stores in Greece to Sklavenitis. In Egypt a store was opened in June 2010 followed by a second in October 2010. Both stores were closed some time within 2013-2015, as the company started withdrawing from loss-making markets. Metro sold the network of 19 stores in Vietnam to TCC Holding in 2016 for $550 million. The first store in China was opened in 1996 in Shanghai in a joint- venture with the Jinjiang Group. On 23 April 2020, Metro completed the sale of the majority stake in Metro China, who operates 97 wholesale centers, to Wumei Technology Group for more than ‚Ç¨1.5 billion. Metro‚Äôs 20% stake in the joint venture allows it to explore various strategic partnership opportunities with Wumei and its technology partner Dmall. ==Metro name== Metro had the naming rights for brand name Metro protected at an early stage, including an agreement with the Hollywood giant Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which was possible at the time without remuneration. Metro tried to secure its usage rights for the term \\"Metro\\" in various proceedings. The Lower Saxony railway company MetroRail had to change its name to Metronom Eisenbahngesellschaft mbH, but can still call its trains Metro. Also the Metro Rapid Successors Metro Express was renamed after being threatened with legal action. In Nabburg (Upper Palatinate), the Metro discotheque was sued and had to change its name. Lawsuits against public transport companies Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), Hamburger Hochbahn (HHA), Hamburger Verkehrsverbund (HVV) and Munich Transport Company (MVG) because of the name Metro-Bus for some main bus routes were rejected in the first instance. The second instance confirmed the judgments, but significantly restricted the use of the public transport companies of the name Metro. In the Ruhr area, the bike rental system Metrorad ruhr had to be renamed Metropolradruhr. In 2012, in the face of an impending brand conflict, Microsoft renamed its Metro user interface of the Microsoft Windows 8 computer operating system. ==See also== * European Retail Round Table * Metro Cash and Carry ==References== ==External links== * Category:Retail companies established in 1964 Category:Retail companies of Germany Category:Companies based in D√ºsseldorf Category:Multinational companies headquartered in Germany Category:Supermarkets of Germany Category:Wholesalers of Germany Category:German companies established in 1964 ","title":"Metro AG"},{"id":"305890","text":"The Monthly Review, established in 1949, is an independent socialist magazine published monthly in New York City. The publication is the longest continuously published socialist magazine in the United States. ==History== ===Establishment=== Following the failure of the independent 1948 Presidential campaign of Henry A. Wallace, two former supporters of the Wallace effort met at the farm in New Hampshire where one of them was living. The two men were literary scholar and Christian socialist F.O. \\"Matty\\" Matthiessen and Marxist economist Paul Sweezy, who were former colleagues at Harvard University. Matthiessen came into an inheritance after his father died in an automobile accident in California and had no pressing need for the money. Matthiessen made the offer to Sweezy to underwrite \\"that magazine [Sweezy] and Leo Huberman were always talking about,\\" committing the sum of $5,000 per year for three years. Matthiessen's funds made the launch of Monthly Review possible, although the amount of the seed money was reduced to $4,000 per year in the second and third years by the executors of Matthiessen's estate following his suicide in 1950. Although Matthiessen was the financial angel of the new publication, from the outset the editorial task was handled by Sweezy and his co-thinker, the left wing popular writer Leo Huberman. The author of an array of books and pamphlets during the 1930s and early 1940s, the New York University-educated Huberman worked full-time on Monthly Review from its establishment until his death of a heart attack in 1968. p. 3-4 Sweezy and Huberman were complementary figures guiding the publication, with Sweezy's theoretical bent and writing ability put to use for a majority of the editorial content, while Huberman took charge of the business and administrative aspects of the enterprise. Sweezy remained at home in New Hampshire, traveling down to the New York City once a month to read manuscripts, where Huberman conducted the day-to-day operations of the magazine along with his wife, Gerty Huberman, and family friend Sybil Huntington May. p. 32-33 Briefly joining Sweezy and Huberman as a third founding editor of Monthly Review ‚Äî although not listed as such on the publication's masthead ‚Äî was German √©migr√© Otto Nathan (1893-1987). Although his time of editorial association with MR was short, Nathan was instrumental in obtaining what would become a seminal essay for the magazine, a lead piece for the debut May 1949 issue by physicist Albert Einstein entitled \\"Why Socialism?\\" HTML version available at the Monthly Review website: \\"About Monthly Review\\". Another key contributor during the first 15 years of MR was economist Paul Baran, frequently considered as the third member of an editorial troika including Sweezy and Huberman. A tenured professor at Stanford University, Baran was one of a very few self-identified Marxists to teach economics at American universities during the Cold War period. Baran worked closely with Sweezy on a book regarded as a landmark in Marxist theory entitled Monopoly Capital, although he died of a heart attack prior to the work's first publication in 1966. p. 4-5. Monthly Review launched in 1949 with a circulation of just 450 copies, most of whom were personal acquaintances of either Huberman or Sweezy. p. 43-44 The magazine's ideology and readership closely paralleled that of the independent Marxist weekly newspaper The National Guardian, established in 1948. Despite a conservative political climate in the United States, the magazine quickly reached a critical mass of subscribers, with its paid circulation rising to 2,500 in 1950 and to 6,000 in 1954. p. 7-9. ===McCarthy period=== During the era of McCarthyism in the early 1950s, editors Paul Sweezy and Leo Huberman were targeted for \\"subversive activities\\". Sweezy's case, tried by New Hampshire Attorney General, reached the Supreme Court and became a seminal case on freedom of speech when the Court ruled in his favor. In 1953, the magazine added veteran radical Scott Nearing to the magazine's ranks. From that date and for nearly 20 years Nearing authored a column descriptively entitled \\"World Events\\". During the Truman and Eisenhower years, a number of left wing intellectuals found a space for their work in MR, including a number that would gain in stature in the ensuing liberalized decade, such as pacifist activist Staughton Lynd (1952), historian William Appleman Williams (1952), and sociologist C. Wright Mills (1958). p. 18-19. ===New Left era and after=== From the middle years of the 1960s, radical political theory saw a resurgence in association with the emergence of a New Left in Europe and North America. Monthly Review grew in stature in tandem with this resurgence.John Bellamy Foster, \\"Monthly Review,\\" in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, and Dan Georgakas (eds.) Encyclopedia of the American Left New York: Garland Publishing Co., 1990; p. 485. While remaining an intellectual journal not oriented towards acquiring a mass readership, circulation of the publication nonetheless grew throughout this era, approaching 9,100 in 1970 before peaking at 11,500 in 1977. p. 20-21. While MR remained essentially a publication with roots in the so-called \\"Old Left\\", it was not unfriendly to the young radical movement which grew in conjunction with the Civil Rights Movement and the opposition to conscription and the Vietnam War. Among those associated with the 1960s New Left published by the Monthly Review were C. Wright Mills, Herbert Marcuse, Todd Gitlin, Carl Oglesby, David Horowitz, and Noam Chomsky. The Monthly Review editorial staff was joined in May 1969 by radical economist Harry Magdoff, replacing Leo Huberman, who had died in 1968. Magdoff, a reader of the publication from its first issue in 1949, bolstered the already well-developed \\"Third-Worldist\\" orientation of the publication, based upon revolutionary events in Cuba, China, and Vietnam. Certain Maoist influence made itself felt in the content of the publication in this period. p. 54, pp. 61-64 Monthly Review became steadily more critical of the Soviet Union in the 1960s and 1970s, with editor Paul Sweezy objecting to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the suppression of the Polish trade union \\"Solidarity\\" through martial law in 1981. p. 24-25. In the latter case, Sweezy declared the incident had proved beyond doubt that > ...the Communist regimes of the Soviet bloc have become the expression and > the guardians of a new rigidified hierarchical structure which has nothing > in common with the kind of socialist society Marxists have always regarded > as the goal of modern working class movements.\\" p. 30 Despite an apparent decline of the American Left in the 1980s, MR's circulation hovered in the 8,000 range throughout the decade.John Bellamy Foster, \\"Monthly Review,\\" in Mari Jo Buhle, Paul Buhle, and Dan Georgakas (eds.)Encyclopedia of the American Left. New York: Garland Publishing Co., 1990; p. 484. Between 1997 and 2000, Monthly Review was co-edited by Ellen Meiksins Wood, Magdoff and Sweezy. ===Publication today=== Since 2006 John Bellamy Foster has been the sole editor. Brett Clark is the associate editor, and the magazine also has one assistant editor and an editorial committee.Monthly Review Archives, \\"Editorial Team.\\" ==Political orientation== From its first issue, Monthly Review attacked the premise that capitalism was capable of infinite growth through Keynesian macroeconomic fine-tuning. Instead, the magazine's editors and leading writers have remained true to the traditional Marxist perspective that capitalist economies contain internal contradictions which will ultimately lead to their collapse and reconstitution on a new socialist basis. Topics of editorial concern have included poverty, unequal distribution of incomes and wealth. Although not averse to discussion of esoteric matters of socialist theory, MR was generally characterized by an aversion to doctrinaire citations of Marxist canon in favor of the analysis of real-world economic and historical trends. Readability was emphasized and the use of academic jargon discouraged. Editors Huberman and Sweezy argued as early as 1952 that massive and expanding military spending was an integral part of the process of capitalist stabilization, driving corporate profits, bolstering levels of employment, and absorbing surplus production. They argued the illusion of an external military threat was required to sustain this system of priorities in government spending; consequently, effort was made by the editors to challenge the dominant Cold War paradigm of \\"Democracy versus Communism\\" in the material published in the magazine.Peter Clecak, \\"Monthly Review (1949‚Äî),\\" in Joseph R. Conlin (ed.), The American Radical Press, 1880-1960: Volume 2. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1974; pg. 667. In its editorial line Monthly Review offered critical support of the Soviet Union during its early years although over time the magazine became increasingly critical of Soviet dedication to Socialism in One Country and peaceful coexistence, seeing that country as playing a more or less conservative role in a world marked by national revolutionary movements. After the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s, Sweezy and Huberman soon came to see the People's Republic of China as the actual center of the world revolutionary movement.Clecak, \\"Monthly Review (1949‚Äî),\\" p. 671. Monthly Review remained true to an independent orientation throughout its history and never aligned with any specific revolutionary movement or political organization. Many of its articles have been written by academics, journalists, and freelance public intellectuals, including Albert Einstein, Tariq Ali, Isabel Allende, Samir Amin, Julian Bond, Marilyn Buck, G. D. H. Cole, Bernardine Dohrn, W. E. B. Du Bois, Barbara Ehrenreich, Andre Gunder Frank, Eduardo Galeano, Che Guevara, Lorraine Hansberry, Edward S.

They are published in Greece; Turkey; Spain; South Korea; as well as separate English, Hindi, and Bengali editions in India. ==Monthly Review Press== Monthly Review Press, an allied endeavor, was launched in 1951 in response to the inability of the maverick left-wing journalist I. F. Stone to otherwise find a publisher for his book The Hidden History of the Korean War. Stone's work, which argued that the still ongoing Korean War was not a case of simple Communist military aggression but was rather the product of political isolation, South Korean military buildup, and border provocations, became the first title offered by the MR Press in 1952. p. 15-16. Titles published by the press in its formative years include: The Empire of Oil by Harvey O'Connor (1955), The Political Economy of Growth by Paul Baran (1957), The United States, Cuba, and Castro by historian William Appleman Williams (1963), Fanshen: A Documentary of Revolution in a Chinese Village by William Hinton (1966), Monopoly Capital by Paul A. Baran and Paul M. Sweezy (1966), the English translation of Open Veins of Latin America by Eduardo Galeano (1973), and Unequal Development (1976) and Eurocentrism (1989) by Samir Amin. Harry Braverman (author of Labor and Monopoly Capital) became director of Monthly Review Press in 1967. The present director of the Press is Michael D. Yates (author of Naming the System). In later years Monthly Review Press has published such titles as: Marx's Ecology by John Bellamy Foster; Discourse on Colonialism by Aim√© C√©saire; The Great Financial Crisis by Fred Magdoff and John Bellamy Foster; and Biology under the Influence by Richard Lewontin and Richard Levins. MR Press is also the U.S. publisher of The Socialist Register, Also see the full listing Socialist Register books. an annual British publication since 1964, which contains topical essays written by radical academics and activists. ==MRzine== From 2005 to 2016, Monthly Review published an associated website, MRzine.

In it, the Pope decries what he considers significant errors afflicting the modern age. These were listed in a controversial Syllabus of Errors, which condemned secularism and religious indifferentism, and was attached to the encyclical. ==Historical Context== In August 1863, Count Charles Montalembert, a proponent of Liberal Catholicism gave a series of speeches in Mechelen, Belgium in which he held forth on his views concerning the future of modern society and the Church. His first speech aimed to show the necessity of Christianizing the democracy by accepting modern liberties. His second speech dealt with liberty of conscience, and the conclusion he drew was that the Church could be in perfect harmony with religious liberty and with the modern state which is founded on that liberty, and that everyone is free to hold that the modern state is to be preferred to the one which preceded it. While supported by Engelbert Sterckx, Archbishop of Mechelen and F√©lix Dupanloup, Bishop of Orl√©ans; Louis-√âdouard-Fran√ßois-Desir√© Pie, Bishop of Poitiers; the papal nuncio at Brussels, Bishop Mieczys≈Çaw Halka-Led√≥chowski; and the Jesuits who edited the \\"Civilt√† Cattolica\\" were alarmed at these declarations. At the end of March, 1864, he received a letter from Cardinal Antonelli, Papal Secretary of State, finding fault with the Mechelen speeches.Goyau, Georges. \\"Comte de Montalembert.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 9 January 2019 Quanta cura was prompted by the September Convention of 1864 agreement between the then newly emerging Kingdom of Italy and the Second French Empire of Napoleon III. France had previously occupied Rome with French troops in order to prevent the Kingdom of Italy from defeating the Papal States with the Capture of Rome, thereby blocking an Italian military action that would complete the unification of the Kingdom of Italy on the Italian Peninsula. While viewed a necessary component of Italian Unification by Italians supporting the Risorgimento, France agreed to the complete withdraw its military garrison from Rome primarily as defensive movement of her troops back into France in anticipation of a military conflict on French soil that would later become known as the Franco-Prussian War of 1870.http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=mov \\"HISTORY OF ROME: From republic to royal capital: 1848-1871\\". Pius IX closed the Quanta cura encyclical with a plenary indulgence by declaring a Jubilee year for 1865.\\"Quanta cura\\", Berkley Center Religion, Peace, and World Affairs, Georgetown University ==Opposition to unrestrained freedom of conscience== Pius reaffirms his predecessor's condemnation of liberty of conscience. In the 1832 encyclical Mirari Vos, Pope Gregory XVI deplored religious indifferentism which > \\"... gives rise to that absurd and erroneous proposition which claims that > liberty of conscience must be maintained for everyone. It spreads ruin in > sacred and civil affairs, ‚Ä¶When all restraints are removed by which men are > kept on the narrow path of truth, their nature, which is already inclined to > evil, propels them to ruin....

Mirari Vos, ¬ß14, August 15, 1832 Pius IX's 1864 encyclical specifically marks for condemnation that: ==Propositions condemned== Quanta cura also condemns several other propositions, notably: * That \\"‚Äúthe people‚Äôs will, manifested by what is called public opinion or in some other way, constitutes a supreme law, free from all divine and human control; * That \\"in the political order accomplished facts, from the very circumstance that they are accomplished, have the force of right.\\" * That \\"that permission should be refused to citizens and to the Church, ‚Äúwhereby they may openly give alms for the sake of Christian charity‚Äù; * That the law should be abrogated ‚Äúwhereby on certain fixed days servile works are prohibited because of God‚Äôs worship;‚Äù‚Äù; * That \\"on civil law alone depend all rights of parents over their children, and especially that of providing for education.‚Äù * That ‚Äúthe Church‚Äôs laws do not bind in conscience unless when they are promulgated by the civil power;‚Äù; * That Religious orders have no legitimate reason for being permitted to exist;‚Äù These propositions were aimed at anticlerical governments in various European countries, which had been recently and would in the next few years be secularizing education (sometimes by taking over Catholic schools rather than starting their own competing public schools) and suppressing religious orders, and confiscating their property. (Hales 1958)Hales, E.E.Y. The Catholic Church in the Modern World, (Doubleday, 1958) ==Subsequent commentary== ===John Henry Newman=== John Henry Newman comments on this passage in part 5 of his Letter to the Duke of Norfolk (1874), entitled \\"Conscience\\", which proceeds part 6, \\"The Encyclical of 1864\\": \\"And now I shall turn aside for a moment to show {251} how it is that the Popes of our century have been misunderstood by the English people, as if they really were speaking against conscience in the true sense of the word, when in fact they were speaking against it in the various false senses, philosophical or popular, which in this day are put upon the word. The present Pope, in his Encyclical of 1864, Quant√¢ cur√¢, speaks (as will come before us in the next section) against 'liberty of conscience,' and he refers to his predecessor, Gregory XVI., who, in his Mirari vos, calls it a 'deliramentum.' It is a rule in formal ecclesiastical proceedings, as I shall have occasion to notice lower down, when books or authors are condemned, to use the very words of the book or author, and to condemn the words in that particular sense which they have in their context and their drift, not in the literal, not in the religious sense, such as the Pope might recognize, were they in another book or author. To take a familiar parallel, among many which occur daily. Protestants speak of the \\"Blessed Reformation;\\" Catholics too talk of \\"the Reformation,\\" though they do not call it blessed. Yet every 'reformation' ought, from the very meaning of the word, to be good, not bad; so that Catholics seem to be implying a eulogy on an event which, at the same time, they consider a surpassing evil. Here then they are taking the word and using it in the popular sense of it, not in the Catholic. They would say, if they expressed their full meaning, 'the so-called reformation.' In like manner, if the Pope condemned 'the Reformation,' it would be utterly sophistical to say in consequence that he had declared himself against all reforms; yet this is how Mr. Gladstone {252} treats him, when he speaks of (so-called) liberty of conscience. To make this distinction clear, viz., between the Catholic sense of the word 'conscience,' and that sense in which the Pope condemns it, we find in the Recueil des Allocutions, &c.;, the words accompanied with quotation-marks, both in Pope Gregory's and Pope Pius's Encyclicals, thus:‚ÄîGregory's, \\"Ex hoc putidissimo 'indifferentismi' fonte,\\" (mind, 'indifferentismi' is under quotation-marks, because the Pope will not make himself answerable for so unclassical a word) \\"absurda illa fluit ac erronea sententia, seu potius deliramentum, asserendam esse ac vindicandam cuilibet 'libertatem conscienti√¶.'\\" And that of Pius, \\"Haud timent erroneam illam fovere opinionem a Gregorio XVI. deliramentum appellatam, nimirum 'libertatem conscienti√¶' esse proprium cujuscunque hominis jus.\\" Both Popes certainly scoff at the so-called 'liberty of conscience,' but there is no scoffing of any Pope, in formal documents addressed to the faithful at large, at that most serious doctrine, the right and the duty of following that Divine Authority, the voice of conscience, on which in truth the Church herself is built. So indeed it is; did the Pope speak against Conscience in the true sense of the word, he would commit a suicidal act. He would be cutting the ground from under his feet. His very mission is to proclaim the moral law, and to protect and strengthen that 'Light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world.' On the law of conscience and its sacredness are founded both his authority in theory and his power in fact. Whether this or that particular Pope in this bad world always kept {253} this great truth in view in all he did, it is for history to tell. I am considering here the Papacy in its office and its duties, and in reference to those who acknowledge its claims. They are not bound by the Pope's personal character or private acts, but by his formal teaching. Thus viewing his position, we shall find that it is by the universal sense of right and wrong, the consciousness of transgression, the pangs of guilt, and the dread of retribution, as first principles deeply lodged in the hearts of men, it is thus and only thus, that he has gained his footing in the world and achieved his success. It is his claim to come from the Divine Lawgiver, in order to elicit, protect, and enforce those truths which the Lawgiver has sown in our very nature, it is this and this only that is the explanation of his length of life more than antediluvian. The championship of the Moral Law and of conscience is his raison d'√™tre. The fact of his mission is the answer to the complaints of those who feel the insufficiency of the natural light; and the insufficiency of that light is the justification of his mission. All sciences, except the science of Religion, have their certainty in themselves; as far as they are sciences, they consist of necessary conclusions from undeniable premises, or of phenomena manipulated into general truths by an irresistible induction. But the sense of right and wrong, which is the first element in religion, is so delicate, so fitful, so easily puzzled, obscured, perverted, so subtle in its argumentative methods, so impressible by education, so biassed by pride and passion, so unsteady in its course, that, in the struggle for existence amid the various exercises and triumphs of the human intellect, {254} this sense is at once the highest of all teachers, yet the least luminous; and the Church, the Pope, the Hierarchy are, in the Divine purpose, the supply of an urgent demand. Natural Religion, certain as are its grounds and its doctrines as addressed to thoughtful, serious minds, needs, in order that it may speak to mankind with effect and subdue the world, to be sustained and completed by Revelation. In saying all this, of course I must not be supposed to be limiting the Revelation of which the Church is the keeper to a mere republication of the Natural Law; but still it is true, that, though Revelation is so distinct from the teaching of nature and beyond it, yet it is not independent of it, nor without relations towards it, but is its complement, reassertion, issue, embodiment, and interpretation. The Pope, who comes of Revelation, has no jurisdiction over Nature. If, under the plea of his revealed prerogatives, he neglected his mission of preaching truth, justice, mercy, and peace, much more if he trampled on the consciences of his subjects,‚Äîif he had done so all along, as Protestants say, then he could not have lasted all these many centuries till now, so as to supply a mark for their reprobation. [...] I wish to answer this important objection distinctly. 1\\\\. First, I am using the word \\"conscience\\" in the high sense in which I have already explained it,‚Äînot as a fancy or an opinion, but as a dutiful obedience to what claims to be a divine voice, speaking within us; and that this is the view properly to be taken of it, I shall not attempt to prove here, but shall assume it as a first principle. {256} 2\\\\. Secondly, I observe that conscience is not a judgment upon any speculative truth, any abstract doctrine, but bears immediately on conduct, on something to be done or not done. \\"Conscience,\\" says St. Thomas, \\"is the practical judgment or dictate of reason, by which we judge what hic et nunc is to be done as being good, or to be avoided as evil.\\" Hence conscience cannot come into direct collision with the Church's or the Pope's infallibility; which is engaged in general propositions, and in the condemnation of particular and given errors.\\" And on the condemnation of absolute freedom of speech, he wrote, after discussing the restrictions on freedom of speech and worship in English law (ibid, section 6): \\"But now let us see, on the other hand, what the proposition really is, the condemnation of which leads him /William Ewart Gladstone/ to say, that the Pope has unrestrictedly 'condemned those who maintain the liberty of the Press, the liberty of conscience and of worship, and the liberty of speech,' p. 16,‚Äîhas \\"condemned free speech, free writing, and a free press,\\" p. 42\\\\. The condemned proposition speaks as follows:‚Äî 'Liberty of conscience and worship, is the inherent right of all men. 2. It ought to be proclaimed in every rightly constituted society. 3. It is a right to all sorts of liberty (omnimodam libertatem) such, that it ought not to be restrained by any authority, ecclesiastical or civil, as far as public speaking, printing, or any other public manifestation of opinions is concerned.' Now, is there any government on earth that could stand the strain of such a doctrine as this? It starts by taking for granted that there are certain Rights of man; Mr. Gladstone so considers, I believe; but other deep thinkers of the day are quite of another opinion; {274} however, if the doctrine of the proposition is true, then the right of conscience, of which it speaks, being inherent in man, is of universal force‚Äîthat is, all over the world‚Äîalso, says the proposition, it is a right which must be recognised by all rightly constituted governments. Lastly, what is the right of conscience thus inherent in our nature, thus necessary for all states? The proposition tells us. It is the liberty of every one to give public utterance, in every possible shape, by every possible channel, without any let or hindrance from God or man, to all his notions whatsoever [Note 2]. Which of the two in this matter is peremptory and sweeping in his utterance, the author of this thesis himself, or the Pope who has condemned what the other has uttered? Which of the two is it who would force upon the world a universal? All that the Pope has done is to deny a universal, and what a universal! a universal liberty to all men to say out whatever doctrines they may hold by preaching, or by the press, uncurbed by church or civil power. Does not this bear out what I said in the foregoing section of the sense in which Pope Gregory denied a \\"liberty of conscience\\"? It is a liberty of self-will. What if a man's conscience embraces the duty of regicide? or infanticide? or free love? You may say that in England the good sense of the nation would stifle and extinguish such atrocities. True, but the proposition says that it is the very right of every one, by nature, in {275} every well constituted society. If so, why have we gagged the Press in Ireland on the ground of its being seditious? Why is not India brought within the British constitution? It seems a light epithet for the Pope to use, when he calls such a doctrine of conscience deliramentum: of all conceivable absurdities it is the wildest and most stupid. Has Mr. Gladstone really no better complaint to make against the Pope's condemnations than this?\\"http://www.newmanreader.org/works/anglicans/volume2/gladstone/section6.html ===William George McCloskey=== Regarding the issues of civil control of education, and the separation of church and state, William George McCloskey first rector of the American College at Rome (and later Bishop of Louisville, Kentucky) observed wryly, > It is consoling to think that Our Holy Father has in all his official acts a > light of guidance from on High, for according to all the rules of mere human > prudence and wisdom [Quanta cura] ‚Ä¶ would be considered ill-timed.

Some information is recorded in the 18th century biography by Diogo Barbosa Machado: he came from Oliven√ßa, became a priest, and was employed as a teacher both at Padua and Viterbo. Very little of what Machado wrote about him has been verified by any other source, except the date of publication (1561) of a music theory treatise at Venice. ==Music== As a composer he wrote a number of choral works, including motets and a madrigal, but he is better known by far for his work as a theorist. In a 1551 debate in Rome, he espoused traditional views on the role of the three genera in music (diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic) over more radical ones put forward by Nicola Vicentino (Lusitano was deemed to have won the debate). His Introdutione facilissima et novissima de canto fermo (Rome, 1553, and again at Venice, 1561), contains an introduction to music, a section on improvised counterpoint, and his views on the three genera. ==References== * Bonnie Blackburn: \\"Vicente Lusitano\\", Grove Music Online, ed.

IX. Quanta cura. Romae, 1864. link. It condemns a total of 80 errors or heresies, articulating Catholic Church teaching on a number of philosophical and political questions, and referring to previous documents. Reaction from Catholics was mixed, while that from Protestants was uniformly negative. The document remains controversial, and has been cited on numerous occasions by both Catholic traditionalists seeking to uphold traditional Catholic values and anti-Catholics seeking to criticize the church's positions. The purpose of the Syllabus was not to explain each error in depth, but only to provide a list briefly paraphrasing each and referring to the corresponding papal documents which define and explicate the errors in detail. These detailed documents are essential for understanding the Pope‚Äôs arguments. ==History== On December 8, 1864, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, the Holy See under Pope Pius IX issued the Syllabus of Errors, a compilation of what the Catholic Church believed to be heresies in the philosophical and political realm. It listed them, and referred to older Church documents previously issued on these matters. == Summary == The Syllabus is made up of phrases and paraphrases from earlier papal documents, along with index references to them, presenting a list of \\"condemned propositions\\", and implicitly supporting their opposites. For instance, in condemning proposition 14, \\"Philosophy is to be treated without taking any account of supernatural revelation\\", the Syllabus asserts the contrary proposition‚Äîthat philosophy must take account of supernatural revelation. The Syllabus does not explain why each particular proposition is wrong, but cites earlier documents considering each subject. Except for some propositions drawn from Pius' encyclical Qui pluribus of November 9, 1846, most were based on documents issued after the Revolutions of 1848 shocked the Pope and the papacy (see Italian unification). The Syllabus is divided into ten sections of 80 propositions which condemn various errors about the following topics: #pantheism, naturalism, and absolute rationalism, #1‚Äì7 #moderate rationalism, #8‚Äì14 #indifferentism and latitudinarianism, #15‚Äì18 #socialism, communism, secret societies, Bible societies, and liberal clerical societies, a general condemnation, unnumbered #the Catholic Church and her rights, #19‚Äì38 (defending temporal power in the Papal States, overthrown six years later) #civil society and its relationship to the church, #39‚Äì55 #natural and Christian ethics, #56‚Äì64 #Christian marriage, #65‚Äì74 #the civil power of the sovereign Pontiff in the Papal States, #75‚Äì76 #liberalism in every political form, #77‚Äì80. ===Selected propositions=== Statements the encyclical condemns as false include: *\\"Human reason, without any reference whatsoever to God, is the sole arbiter of truth and falsehood, and of good and evil.\\" (No. 3, rationalism) *\\"All the truths of religion proceed from the innate strength of human reason; hence reason is the ultimate standard by which man can and ought to arrive at the knowledge of all truths of every kind.\\" (No. 4, rationalism) *\\"Protestantism is nothing more than another form of the same true Christian religion, in which form it is given to please God equally as in the Catholic Church.\\" (No. 18). *\\"The Church ought to be separated from the State, and the State from the Church.\\" (No. 55, separation of church and state) *\\"In the present day it is no longer expedient that the Catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the State, to the exclusion of all other forms of worship.\\" (No. 77) *\\"Every man is free to embrace and profess that religion which, guided by the light of reason, he shall consider true.\\" (No. 15) and that \\"It has been wisely decided by law, in some Catholic countries, that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship.\\" (No. 78, freedom of religion) *\\"The Roman Pontiff can, and ought to, reconcile himself, and come to terms with, progress, liberalism and modern civilization.\\" (No. 80, cf. Jamdudum cernimus) ==Reactions== ===Non- Catholics=== Within the Protestant world, reactions were uniformly negative. In 1874, the British Leader of the Opposition William Gladstone published a tract entitled The Vatican Decrees in their bearing on Civil Allegiance: A Political Expostulation, in which he said that after the Syllabus: :. . . no one can now become (Rome's) convert without renouncing his moral and mental freedom, and placing his civil loyalty and duty at the mercy of another. The government of France briefly tried to suppress the circulation of the encyclical and the Syllabus within its borders; it forbade priests to explain the Syllabus from the pulpit, though newspapers were allowed to discuss it from a secular point of view. ===Catholics=== The document met with a mixed reception among Catholics; many accepted it wholeheartedly, others wanted a clarification of some points, and still others were as shocked as their Protestant neighbors by the apparent broad scope of the condemnations. Catholic apologists such as F√©lix Dupanloup and John Henry Newman said that the Syllabus was widely misinterpreted by readers who did not have access to, or did not bother to check, the original documents of which it was a summary. The propositions listed had been condemned as erroneous opinions in the sense and context in which they originally occurred; without the original context, the document appeared to condemn a larger range of ideas than it actually did. Thus, it was asserted that no critical response to the Syllabus could be valid, if it did not take into account the cited documents and their context. Newman writes: > The Syllabus then has no dogmatic force; it addresses us, not in its > separate portions, but as a whole, and is to be received from the Pope by an > act of obedience, not of faith, that obedience being shown by having > recourse to the original and authoritative documents, (Allocutions and the > like,) to which the Syllabus pointedly refers. Moreover, when we turn to > those documents, which are authoritative, we find the Syllabus cannot even > be called an echo of the Apostolic Voice; for, in matters in which wording > is so important, it is not an exact transcript of the words of the Pope, in > its account of the errors condemned, just as would be natural in what is an > index for reference.Francis A. Sullivan, Creative Fidelity, , p. 143. As the English Catholic historian E. E. Y. Hales explained, concerning item #77: > \\"[T]he Pope is not concerned with a universal principle, but with the > position in a particular state at a particular date. He is expressing his > 'wonder and distress' (no more) that in a Catholic country (Spain) it should > be proposed to disestablish the Church and to place any and every religion > upon a precisely equal footing.... Disestablishment and toleration were far > from the normal practice of the day, whether in Protestant or in Catholic > states.\\" Newman points out that this item refers to the July 26, 1855 allocution Nemo vestrum. At this time, Spain had been in violation of its Concordat of 1851 with the Holy See (implemented 1855).Kelly, Leo, and Benedetto Ojetti. \\"Concordat.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 10 January 2019]Shaw, Russell. \\"Syllabus of Errors still relevant 150 years later\\", OSV Weekly, November 25, 2014 In the wake of the controversy following the document's release, Pius IX referred to it as \\"raw meat needing to be cooked\\". However, others within the church who supported the Syllabus disagreed that there was any misinterpretation of the condemnations. The Syllabus was an attack on liberalism, modernism, moral relativism, secularization, and the political emancipation of Europe from the tradition of Catholic monarchies. ==Sources cited== The Syllabus cites a number of previous documents that had been written during Pius's papacy. These include: Qui pluribus, Maxima quidem, Singulari quadam, Tuas libenter, Multiplices inter, Quanto conficiamur, Noscitis, Nostis et nobiscum, Meminit unusquisque, Ad Apostolicae, Nunquam fore, Incredibili, Acerbissimum, Singularis nobisque, Multis gravibusque, Quibus quantisque, Quibus luctuosissimis, In consistoriali, Cum non sine, Cum saepe, Quanto conficiamur, Jamdudum cernimus, Novos et ante, Quibusque vestrum and Cum catholica. ==Subsequent history== In the 21 November 1873 encyclical, Etsi multa (\\"On the Church in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland\\"), which is often appended to the Syllabus, Pius expresses further thoughts in the same vein, condemning contemporary liberalizing anti-clerical legislation in South America as \\"a ferocious war on the Church\\". In 1907, Lamentabili sane exitu was promulgated, a \\"Syllabus condemning the errors of the Modernists\\", being a list of errors made by scholars of biblical criticism.Lamentabili Sane text 1907 == Footnotes == == Further reading == * Pio Nono: A Study in European Politics and Religion in the Nineteenth Century, by E.E.Y.

Galeano's best-known works are Las venas abiertas de Am√©rica Latina (Open Veins of Latin America, 1971) and Memoria del fuego (Memory of Fire Trilogy, 19826). \\"I'm a writer,\\" the author once said of himself, \\"obsessed with remembering, with remembering the past of America and above all that of Latin America, intimate land condemned to amnesia.\\" Author Isabel Allende, who said her copy of Galeano's book was one of the few items with which she fled Chile in 1973 after the military coup of Augusto Pinochet, called Open Veins of Latin America, \\"a mixture of meticulous detail, political conviction, poetic flair, and good storytelling.\\" ==Life== Eduardo Germ√°n Mar√≠a Hughes Galeano was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, on Sept. 3, 1940. His two family names were inherited from Welsh and Italian (from Genoa) great- grandfathers; the other two were from Germany and Spain.. Galeano wrote under his maternal family name; as young man, he briefly wrote for a Uruguayan socialist publication, El Sol, signing articles as \\"Gius,\\" \\"a pseudonym approximating the pronunciation in Spanish of his paternal surname Hughes.\\"Simon Romero, \\"Eduardo Galenao, Uruguayan Voice of Anti-Capitalism, Is Dead at 74,\\" New York Times, 14 April 2015, A17. Galeano's family belonged to the fallen Uruguayan aristocracy; Galeano himself went to work at fourteen, having completed just two years of secondary school. He started his career as a journalist in the early 1960s as editor of Marcha, an influential weekly journal which had such contributors as Mario Vargas Llosa, Mario Benedetti, Manuel Maldonado Denis and Roberto Fern√°ndez Retamar. For two years he edited the daily √âpoca and worked as editor-in-chief of the University Press. In 1959 he married his first wife, Silvia Brando, and in 1962, having divorced, he remarried to Graciela Berro.. In 1973, a military coup took power in Uruguay; Galeano was imprisoned and later was forced to flee, going into exile in Argentina where he founded the magazine Crisis.Romero, \\"Eduardo Galeano,\\" His book Open Veins of Latin America was banned by the right-wing military government, not only in Uruguay, but also in Chile and Argentina.Fresh Off Worldwide Attention for Joining Obama‚Äôs Book Collection, Uruguayan Author Eduardo Galeano Returns with \\"Mirrors: Stories of Almost Everyone\\". In 1976 he married for the third time to Helena Villagra; however, in the same year, the Videla regime took power in Argentina in a bloody military coup and his name was added to the list of those condemned by the death squads. He fled again, this time to Spain, where he wrote his famous trilogy, Memoria del fuego (Memory of Fire), described as \\"the most powerful literary indictment of colonialism in the Americas.\\". Galeano in 1984 At the beginning of 1985 Galeano returned to Montevideo when democratization occurred. Following the victory of Tabar√© V√°zquez and the Broad Front alliance in the 2004 Uruguayan elections marking the first left-wing government in Uruguayan history Galeano wrote a piece for The Progressive titled \\"Where the People Voted Against Fear\\" in which Galeano showed support for the new government and concluded that the Uruguayan populace used \\"common sense\\" and were \\"tired of being cheated\\" by the traditional Colorado and Blanco parties.Eduardo Galeano, \\"Where the People Voted Against Fear\\" January 2005 The Progressive Following the creation of TeleSUR, a Latin American television station based in Caracas, Venezuela, in 2005 Galeano along with other left-wing intellectuals such as Tariq Ali and Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel joined the network's 36 member advisory committee.Alfonso Daniels, \\"'Chavez TV' beams into South America\\",The Guardian, 26 July 2005.

And they feel as if they are able to teach democracy\\". He also talked about how and why he has changed his writing style, and his recent rise in popularity.Audio and transcript of interview, May 2009 In April 2014 Galeano gave an interview at the II Bienal Brasil do Livro e da Leitura in which he regretted some aspects of the writing style in Las Venas Abiertas de Am√©rica Latina, saying > \\"Time has passed, I've begun to try other things, to bring myself closer to > human reality in general and to political economy specifically.

Charles Welles Rosen (May 5, 1927December 9, 2012) was an American pianist and writer on music.\\"Charles Rosen, Scholar-Musician Who Untangled Classical Works, Dies at 85\\" by Margalit Fox, The New York Times, December 10, 2012 He is remembered for his career as a concert pianist, for his recordings, and for his many writings, notable among them the book The Classical Style. == Life and career == === Youth and education === Charles Rosen was born in New York City on May 5, 1927, to a Russian-Jewish immigrant couple, Irwin Rosen, an architect, and Anita Rosen ( Gerber), a semiprofessional actress and amateur pianist. Charles began his musical studies at age 4 and at age 6 enrolled in the Juilliard School. At age 11 he left Juilliard to study piano with Moriz Rosenthal, and with Rosenthal's wife, Hedwig Kanner.\\"Charles Rosen\\", biography, discography, Performing Arts Encyclopedia, Library of Congress Rosenthal, born in 1862, had been a student of Franz Liszt. Rosenthal's memories of the 19th century in classical music were communicated to his pupil and appear frequently in Rosen's later writings. (For instance, in Critical Entertainments, Rosen offers a memory from Rosenthal concerning how Brahms performed on the piano; specifically that he \\"rolled\\" chords upward, starting with the bass note.) Every year from the ages of three to twelve, Rosen heard Josef Hofmann play, and he later suggested that Hofmann had a greater influence on him than Rosenthal. Rosen's family background was not a wealthy one. The Guardian editor Nicholas Wroe interviewed Rosen in his old age, and reported: > His father had lost his job during the depression and \\"things were pretty > tough for a while\\". The family moved from Washington Heights to a ho[me] in > the then less fashionable Upper West Side, where Rosen still lives. Because > money was so short Rosen's parents arranged a contract with the Rosenthals > not to pay them for Charles's tuition, but instead to give them 15% of his > earnings as a pianist until the age of 21. \\"As I didn't make my debut in New > York until I was 23, it was not a very satisfactory deal. But when I made my > first recording I took some money to Hedwig [Kanner] Rosenthal, who was very > surprised because she had been teaching me for 13 or 14 years at that > stage.\\" At age 17, Rosen enrolled in Princeton University, where he studied French, and also took courses in mathematics and philosophy. When he graduated in 1947, he was offered a fellowship of $2,000 to continue at Princeton in the French graduate program. While in graduate school he roomed with his fellow student Michael Steinberg, who also went on to become a classical-music critic and renowned scholar in his own right. Rosen attained his status as a musical scholar with very little classroom training. Although the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians refers to him as a student of the musicologist Oliver Strunk,Kenneth Levy. \\"Strunk, Oliver.\\" In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/26999 (accessed July 27, 2008). Rosen never formally studied musicology with Strunk or anyone else.Rosen, Charles, \\"Œ§Œ± ŒºœåŒΩŒ± œÄœÅŒøŒ≤ŒªŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒºŒøœÖœÉŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒµŒØŒΩŒ±Œπ ...œåŒªŒ± œÑŒ± œÖœÄœåŒªŒøŒπœÄŒ±.\\" (The only problems of music are... all the rest) Interview by Paris Konstantinidis. Highlights, 35, Athens, July‚ÄìAugust 2008, 152‚Äì154. Rosen's extensive knowledge of music appears to have arisen partly from a culturally rich family background, and partly from reading. As Wroe reported: > Through the Rosenthals, Rosen was connected to the New York musical scene. > ... [He] says that by the time he went to Princeton, he knew all the music > department socially. \\"So that made me too proud to take a degree in music, > which I thought would be too easy. I sound like a snotty bastard, which I > might have been, but I really did know more music as an undergraduate than > the postgraduate students.\\" Ivan Hewett suggests that a major temptation of Rosen's 1947 fellowship offer was that it offered him time to practice and to read extensively in the Princeton library. === Launching his musical career === The year 1951 was a busy one for Rosen: he completed his French Literature Ph.D., gave his first piano recital, and made his first recordings, of works by Martinu and Haydn. His career as a pianist made progress only slowly at first, and he traveled to Paris on a Fulbright scholarship to study the relationship between poetry and music in 16th-century France. In 1953 he moved to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to teach French. He described this period to Nicholas Wroe: > I suppose I could have stayed on as an academic, but I never intended to do > anything but play the piano. The only time I taught was when my playing > would only support me for half a year, but I could only get a full-time job. > So I taught French at MIT Monday to Wednesday, but Thursday through Sunday I > was a pianist. In 1955, after two years there, I got an offer from Columbia > Artists Management and so I resigned. The Columbia offer initiated his successful career as a concert pianist: Rosen appeared in numerous recitals and orchestral engagements around the world. Musicologist Stanley Sadie reviewed his pianism as follows: > As a pianist, Rosen is intense, severe and intellectual. His playing of > Brahms and Schumann has been criticized for lack of expressive warmth; in > music earlier and later he has won consistent praise. His performance of > Bach's Goldberg Variations is remarkable for its clarity, its vitality and > its structural grasp; he has also recorded The Art of Fugue in performances > of exceptional lucidity of texture.

Rosen made a large number of recordings, including recording various 20th century works at the invitation of their composers: * Igor Stravinsky: Movements for Piano and Orchestra * Elliott Carter: Double Concerto for Harpsichord and Piano with Two Chamber Orchestras * Pierre Boulez: complete works for piano In 1955, he recorded six Scarlatti's sonatas and Mozart's sonata K. 333 on the historical Siena Piano. His recordings include earlier literature such as Debussy's √âtudes (1958), Schumann's works for solo piano, Beethoven's late sonatas and Diabelli Variations, and Bach's Art of Fugue and Goldberg Variations. === Career as a writer and teacher === Rosen's career as an author and scholar began only when he had passed the age of 40. Nicholas Wroe narrates how he started writing: > Rosen released his first Chopin recording in 1960. It included one of the > late nocturnes, opus 62 no 1 ... Rosen says he wasn't entirely happy with > the recording, but he was even more disappointed with the sleeve note, which > described the nocturne as \\"staggering drunken with the odour of flowers\\". \\"I > had many thoughts about the piece,\\" he says. \\"That was not one of them. So I > started writing the sleeve notes myself. People liked them and after a while > a publisher took me to lunch. Before he even offered me a drink he said he > would publish whatever I'd like to write. Eventually it led to many books > and articles. But to begin with I wrote just to keep nonsense off my record > sleeves.\\" In 1970 Rosen wrote his first column for The New York Review of Books‚Äîa scathing review of the then-current edition of the Harvard Dictionary of Music. His association with the magazine continued for the rest of his life. A number of his books collect essays and reviews he wrote for the Review. In 1971, Rosen published his first and most famous book, The Classical Style. This work was highly successful, winning a National Book Award; and initiated a long series of books. At various points in his career Rosen took positions as a university professor. His early stint teaching French at MIT is mentioned above. His later teaching was in music, in part-time or visiting positions offered to Rosen after he had achieved fame in his scholarly work. At Harvard University he held the Charles Eliot Norton Chair of Poetics in 1980/1981; the public lectures he gave there served as the basis of The Romantic Generation. He taught one academic quarter per year at the University of Chicago from 1985 to 1996. He taught at Stony Brook University starting 1971, the University of Oxford (1988) and the Royal Northern College of Music. Even after the scholarly phase of his career had set in, Rosen continued to perform as a pianist for the rest of his life. He gave his last lecture on April 18, 2012 in the series Music in 21st-Century Society, at the Barry S. Brook Center for Music Research and Documentation of the CUNY Graduate Center. Rosen died of cancer on December 9, 2012, in New York City, aged 85.Arts Journal His collection of scores and manuscripts was donated to the Music Department of the Graduate Center, City University of New York. == Books and other writings == Rosen was the author of many acclaimed books about music, among them: * The Classical Style (1971), his most famous work, which analyzes the nature and evolution of the style of the Classical period as it was developed by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Rosen revised the work in 1997, leaving most of the text intact but adding a second chapter on Beethoven and a preface addressing comments on the first edition. * Sonata Forms (1980), which is in some ways a follow-up to The Classical Style, is an intensive analysis of the primary musical form used in the classical era. Rosen wrote the work when his intended contribution to the New Grove on sonata form was rejected by the editors; he enlarged the article he had written into book form. * The Romantic Generation (1995), which is centered on the early generation of Romantic composers, including Chopin, Liszt, Schumann, Mendelssohn, and Berlioz. * Beethoven's Piano Sonatas: A Short Companion (2001), which gives general background on these famous works as well as sonata-by-sonata advice for performers. * Critical Entertainments: Music Old and New (2001), a compilation of essays originally published in magazines and scholarly journals, mostly The New York Review of Books. It covers a variety of topics, including Oliver Strunk; the work of various composers; the status of contemporary music, and the \\"New Musicology\\". * Piano Notes: The World of the Pianist (2002), an account of the concert pianist's world, addressed to the general reader. It covers piano technique, the instrument itself, the culture of piano performance, and the repertoire for the instrument. * \\"Schubert's inflections of Classical form\\", a chapter of the Cambridge Companion to Schubert. Rosen also published in other areas of the humanities: Romanticism and Realism: The Mythology of Nineteenth- Century Art, and Romantic Poets, Critics, and Other Madmen. === Aspects of Rosen's writing === In the introduction to Critical Entertainments, Rosen stated that his main goal in writing about music was \\"to increase the listener's engagement with the music\\". Alluding to the unhappy program note mentioned above, he wrote: > A Chopin recording I made ... had some notes that quoted James Huneker on > one of the late nocturnes, which claimed that it \\"staggered drunken with the > odor of flowers.\\" This was not my view of the work ... Huneker's style is an > invitation to the listener to dream, to dissipate attention into reverie. > The writing about music that I prefer ‚Äì and the performances of it, as well > ‚Äì fix and intensify the listener's attention. When I hear music, I prefer to > lose myself in it, not drift outside in my own personal world with the music > as a decorative and distant background.Critical Entertainments pp. 1‚Äì2. In pursuing this goal, Rosen often appealed to technical aspects of musical description, including the theories of harmony and musical form. In a New Yorker blog post, Jeremy Denk rhapsodically describes this aspect of Rosen's work: > My favorite, life-changing parts of The Classical Style are the blow-by-blow > accounts of great passages of music in the wonkiest of terms. He delves into > the exposition of Mozart's piano concerto in E-flat, K. 271, showing how > each new idea fulfills various needs raised by the last, while leaving > others still open: a continuous game of symmetry and asymmetry, expectation > and fulfillment, hiding beneath the innocent surface. ... Charles insists on > addressing the notes; but he shows us how behind the notes are felt needs, > requirements, laws of how things ought to be‚Äîa whole system of judgment, of > taste, of meaning. ... The book ... occasionally feels like a page-turner, a > thriller: these three geniuses‚ÄîHaydn, Mozart, Beethoven‚Äîbuilding on each > other's discoveries, like scientists almost, creating unprecedented > inventions, invoking a golden era of form meeting content.\\"Postscript: > Charles Rosen\\" by Jeremy Denk, The New Yorker, 18 December 2012 Another goal of the work is to set each composer's work in its historical and cultural background, describing the forms of composition that served as a musical background for a composer in his formative years and then illuminating his contributions. Thus, for example, Rosen largely sees Beethoven in the context of the Classical-period tradition from which he emerged, rather than anachronistically as a forerunner of the later Romantic movement. Indeed, Rosen makes a strong case that the Romantic movement in music emerged from a rejection of the principles on which Beethoven composed; and that the veneration the Romantics held for Beethoven was in some ways an impediment to their best work. Rosen was unafraid to make strong generalizations about the music he studied; i.e. he frequently pointed out aspects of the music claimed to be invariably or almost invariably present. Here are examples. > The first section of a sonata exposition always has an increasingly animated > texture. (Sonata Forms, p. 238) The opening of a work by Mozart is always > solidly based [i.e., in the tonic key], no matter how ambiguous and > disturbing its expressive significance, while the most unassuming first > measures of a quartet by Haydn are far more unstable, more immediately > charged with a dynamic movement away from the tonic. (The Classical Style, > 186) In this respect Chopin is one of the least pianistic of composers: a > change of harmony [= a passage repeated later in a piece in a different key] > that makes the original figuration exceedingly awkward does not lead him to > change the figuration, and he always refuses to adapt his musical thought to > the convenience of the hand. (The Romantic Generation, p. 364) From time to time Rosen wielded his pen as a rapier, skewering other authors. He generally expressed his criticisms with a dose of wit, mixing damnation with faint praise, as in the following discussion of a contribution by Richard Taruskin to a volume on historically informed performance: > Taruskin writes brilliantly and at the top of his voice, and his most > crushing arguments are often reserved for opinions that no one really holds. > He asserts: \\"To presume that the use of historical instruments guarantees a > historical result is simply preposterous.\\" No doubt. Still, Taruskin beats > his dead horses with infectious enthusiasm, and some of them have occasional > twitches of life.Critical Entertainments, p. 204 Such passages were balanced by a fair amount of praise and appreciation (if not systematic citation) of others' work. Rosen's prodigious memory for facts occasionally failed him, letting elementary factual errors creep into his work. Sometimes he would apologize for the errors in reprinted editions, retaining them in the text as a sort of self-reprimand. Thus chapter 7 of Critical Entertainments, a reprinted essay, begins with an appended comment: > At the opening of the following essay, the mistake of calling Joseph II the > emperor Franz Joseph is so egregious that I have let it stand in the text in > the hope that the public humiliation will make me more careful in the > future. Several readers wrote to signal other mistakes‚Ä¶ === Critical assessment === The musicologist Mark DeVoto has written of Rosen: > Charles Rosen was a comprehensive musician, an outstanding pianist and one > of the best writers on music ever.

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to analyze and solve problems that involve fluid flows. Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the free-stream flow of the fluid, and the interaction of the fluid (liquids and gases) with surfaces defined by boundary conditions. With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved, and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows. Initial validation of such software is typically performed using experimental apparatus such as wind tunnels. In addition, previously performed analytical or empirical analysis of a particular problem can be used for comparison. A final validation is often performed using full-scale testing, such as flight tests. CFD is applied to a wide range of research and engineering problems in many fields of study and industries, including aerodynamics and aerospace analysis, weather simulation, natural science and environmental engineering, industrial system design and analysis, biological engineering, fluid flows and heat transfer, and engine and combustion analysis. ==Background and history== A computer simulation of high velocity air flow around the Space Shuttle during re-entry. A simulation of the Hyper-X scramjet vehicle in operation at Mach-7 The fundamental basis of almost all CFD problems is the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations, which define many single-phase (gas or liquid, but not both) fluid flows. These equations can be simplified by removing terms describing viscous actions to yield the Euler equations. Further simplification, by removing terms describing vorticity yields the full potential equations. Finally, for small perturbations in subsonic and supersonic flows (not transonic or hypersonic) these equations can be linearized to yield the linearized potential equations. Historically, methods were first developed to solve the linearized potential equations. Two-dimensional (2D) methods, using conformal transformations of the flow about a cylinder to the flow about an airfoil were developed in the 1930s. One of the earliest type of calculations resembling modern CFD are those by Lewis Fry Richardson, in the sense that these calculations used finite differences and divided the physical space in cells. Although they failed dramatically, these calculations, together with Richardson's book \\"Weather prediction by numerical process\\", set the basis for modern CFD and numerical meteorology. In fact, early CFD calculations during the 1940s using ENIAC used methods close to those in Richardson's 1922 book. The computer power available paced development of three-dimensional methods. Probably the first work using computers to model fluid flow, as governed by the Navier-Stokes equations, was performed at Los Alamos National Lab, in the T3 group. This group was led by Francis H. Harlow, who is widely considered as one of the pioneers of CFD. From 1957 to late 1960s, this group developed a variety of numerical methods to simulate transient two-dimensional fluid flows, such as Particle-in-cell method (Harlow, 1957), Fluid-in-cell method (Gentry, Martin and Daly, 1966), Vorticity stream function method (Jake Fromm, 1963), and Marker-and-cell method (Harlow and Welch, 1965). Fromm's vorticity- stream-function method for 2D, transient, incompressible flow was the first treatment of strongly contorting incompressible flows in the world. The first paper with three-dimensional model was published by John Hess and A.M.O. Smith of Douglas Aircraft in 1967. This method discretized the surface of the geometry with panels, giving rise to this class of programs being called Panel Methods. Their method itself was simplified, in that it did not include lifting flows and hence was mainly applied to ship hulls and aircraft fuselages. The first lifting Panel Code (A230) was described in a paper written by Paul Rubbert and Gary Saaris of Boeing Aircraft in 1968. In time, more advanced three-dimensional Panel Codes were developed at Boeing (PANAIR, A502), Lockheed (Quadpan), Douglas (HESS), McDonnell Aircraft (MACAERO),Bristow, D.R., \\"Development of Panel Methods for Subsonic Analysis and Design,\\" NASA CR-3234, 1980.

Some (PANAIR, HESS and MACAERO) were higher order codes, using higher order distributions of surface singularities, while others (Quadpan, PMARC, USAERO and VSAERO) used single singularities on each surface panel. The advantage of the lower order codes was that they ran much faster on the computers of the time. Today, VSAERO has grown to be a multi-order code and is the most widely used program of this class. It has been used in the development of many submarines, surface ships, automobiles, helicopters, aircraft, and more recently wind turbines. Its sister code, USAERO is an unsteady panel method that has also been used for modeling such things as high speed trains and racing yachts. The NASA PMARC code from an early version of VSAERO and a derivative of PMARC, named CMARC,Pinella, David and Garrison, Peter, ‚ÄúDigital Wind Tunnel CMARC; Three-Dimensional Low-Order Panel Codes,‚Äù Aerologic, 2009. is also commercially available. In the two- dimensional realm, a number of Panel Codes have been developed for airfoil analysis and design. The codes typically have a boundary layer analysis included, so that viscous effects can be modeled. Professor Richard Eppler of the University of Stuttgart developed the PROFILE code, partly with NASA funding, which became available in the early 1980s.Eppler, R.; Somers, D. M., \\"A Computer Program for the Design and Analysis of Low-Speed Airfoils,\\" NASA TM-80210, 1980. This was soon followed by MIT Professor Mark Drela's XFOIL code.Drela, Mark, \\"XFOIL: An Analysis and Design System for Low Reynolds Number Airfoils,\\" in Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Engineering, No. 54, 1989. Both PROFILE and XFOIL incorporate two-dimensional panel codes, with coupled boundary layer codes for airfoil analysis work. PROFILE uses a conformal transformation method for inverse airfoil design, while XFOIL has both a conformal transformation and an inverse panel method for airfoil design. An intermediate step between Panel Codes and Full Potential codes were codes that used the Transonic Small Disturbance equations. In particular, the three-dimensional WIBCO code, developed by Charlie Boppe of Grumman Aircraft in the early 1980s has seen heavy use. Developers turned to Full Potential codes, as panel methods could not calculate the non-linear flow present at transonic speeds. The first description of a means of using the Full Potential equations was published by Earll Murman and Julian Cole of Boeing in 1970.Murman, Earll and Cole, Julian, \\"Calculation of Plane Steady Transonic Flow,\\" AIAA paper 70-188, presented at the AIAA 8th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, New York New York, January 1970. Frances Bauer, Paul Garabedian and David Korn of the Courant Institute at New York University (NYU) wrote a series of two-dimensional Full Potential airfoil codes that were widely used, the most important being named Program H.Bauer, F., Garabedian, P., and Korn, D. G., \\"A Theory of Supercritical Wing Sections, with Computer Programs and Examples,\\" Lecture Notes in Economics and Mathematical Systems 66, Springer- Verlag, May 1972. A further growth of Program H was developed by Bob Melnik and his group at Grumman Aerospace as Grumfoil.Mead, H. R.; Melnik, R. E., \\"GRUMFOIL: A computer code for the viscous transonic flow over airfoils,\\" NASA CR-3806, 1985. Antony Jameson, originally at Grumman Aircraft and the Courant Institute of NYU, worked with David Caughey to develop the important three- dimensional Full Potential code FLO22Jameson A. and Caughey D., \\"A Finite Volume Method for Transonic Potential Flow Calculations,\\" AIAA paper 77-635, presented at the Third AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Conference, Albuquerque New Mexico, June 1977. in 1975. Many Full Potential codes emerged after this, culminating in Boeing's Tranair (A633) code, which still sees heavy use. The next step was the Euler equations, which promised to provide more accurate solutions of transonic flows. The methodology used by Jameson in his three-dimensional FLO57 codeJameson, A., Schmidt, W. and Turkel, E., \\"Numerical Solution of the Euler Equations by Finite Volume Methods Using Runge-Kutta Time-Stepping Schemes,\\" AIAA paper 81-1259, presented at the AIAA 14th Fluid and Plasma Dynamics Conference, Palo Alto California, 1981. (1981) was used by others to produce such programs as Lockheed's TEAM program and IAI/Analytical Methods' MGAERO program. MGAERO is unique in being a structured cartesian mesh code, while most other such codes use structured body-fitted grids (with the exception of NASA's highly successful CART3D code, Lockheed's SPLITFLOW code and Georgia Tech's NASCART-GT).Marshall, D., and Ruffin, S.M., \\" An Embedded Boundary Cartesian Grid Scheme for Viscous Flows using a New Viscous Wall Boundary Condition Treatment,‚Äù AIAA Paper 2004-0581, presented at the AIAA 42nd Aerospace Sciences Meeting, January 2004. Antony Jameson also developed the three-dimensional AIRPLANE code which made use of unstructured tetrahedral grids. In the two-dimensional realm, Mark Drela and Michael Giles, then graduate students at MIT, developed the ISES Euler program (actually a suite of programs) for airfoil design and analysis. This code first became available in 1986 and has been further developed to design, analyze and optimize single or multi-element airfoils, as the MSES program. MSES sees wide use throughout the world. A derivative of MSES, for the design and analysis of airfoils in a cascade, is MISES,Drela, M. and Youngren H., \\"A User's Guide to MISES 2.53\\", MIT Computational Sciences Laboratory, December 1998. developed by Harold \\"Guppy\\" Youngren while he was a graduate student at MIT. The Navier‚ÄìStokes equations were the ultimate target of development. Two- dimensional codes, such as NASA Ames' ARC2D code first emerged. A number of three-dimensional codes were developed (ARC3D, OVERFLOW, CFL3D are three successful NASA contributions), leading to numerous commercial packages. ==Hierarchy of fluid flow equations== CFD can be seen as a group of computational methodologies (discussed below) used to solve equations governing fluid flow. In the application of CFD, a critical step is to decide which set of physical assumptions and related equations need to be used for the problem at hand. To illustrate this step, the following summarizes the physical assumptions/simplifications taken in equations of a flow that is single-phase (see multiphase flow and two-phase flow), single-species (i.e., it consists of one chemical species), non-reacting, and (unless said otherwise) compressible. Thermal radiation is neglected, and body forces due to gravity are considered (unless said otherwise). In addition, for this type of flow, the next discussion highlights the hierarchy of flow equations solved with CFD. Note that some of the following equations could be derived in more than one way. * Conservation laws (CL): These are the most fundamental equations considered with CFD in the sense that, for example, all the following equations can be derived from them. For a single-phase, single- specie, compressible flow one considers the conservation of mass, conservation of linear momentum, and conservation of energy. * Continuum conservation laws (CCL): Start with the CL. Assume that mass, momentum and energy are locally conserved: These quantities are conserved and cannot \\"teleport\\" from one place to another but can only move by a continuous flow (see continuity equation). Another interpretation is that one starts with the CL and assumes a continuum medium (see continuum mechanics). The resulting system of equations is unclosed since to solve it one needs further relationships/equations: (a) constitutive relationships for the viscous stress tensor; (b) constitutive relationships for the diffusive heat flux; (c) an equation of state (EOS), such as the ideal gas law; and, (d) a caloric equation of state relating temperature with quantities such as enthalpy or internal energy. * Compressible Navier-Stokes equations (C-NS): Start with the CCL. Assume a Newtonian viscous stress tensor (see Newtonian fluid) and a Fourier heat flux (see heat flux). The C-NS need to be augmented with a EOS and a caloric EOS to have a closed system of equations. * Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (I-NS): Start with the C-NS. Assume that density is always and everywhere constant. Another way to obtain the I-NS is to assume that the Mach number is very small and that temperature differences in the fluid are very small as well. As a result, the mass-conservation and momentum-conservation equations are decoupled from the energy-conservation equation, so one only needs to solve for the first two equations. * Compressible Euler equations (EE): Start with the C-NS. Assume a frictionless flow with no diffusive heat flux. * Weakly compressible Navier-Stokes equations (WC-NS): Start with the C-NS. Assume that density variations depend only on temperature and not on pressure. For example, for an ideal gas, use \\\\rho = p_0 / (R T) , where p_0 is a conveniently-defined reference pressure that is always and everywhere constant, \\\\rho is density, R is the specific gas constant, and T is temperature. As a result, the WK-NS do not capture acoustic waves. It is also common in the WK-NS to neglect the pressure-work and viscous-heating terms in the energy-conservation equation. The WK-NS are also called the C-NS with the low-Mach-number approximation. * Boussinesq equations: Start with the C-NS. Assume that density variations are always and everywhere negligible except in the gravity term of the momentum-conservation equation (where density multiplies the gravitational acceleration). Also assume that various fluid properties such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, and heat capacity are always and everywhere constant. The Boussinesq equations are widely used in microscale meteorology. * Compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier‚ÄìStokes equations and compressible Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (C-RANS and C-FANS): Start with the C-NS. Assume that any flow variable f , such as density, velocity and pressure, can be represented as f = F + f , where F is the ensemble-average of any flow variable, and f is a perturbation or fluctuation from this average. f is not necessarily small. If F is a classic ensemble-average (see Reynolds decomposition) one obtains the Reynolds-averaged Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. And if F is a density-weighted ensemble-average one obtains the Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, and depending on the Reynolds number, the range of scales of motion is greatly reduced, something which leads to much faster solutions in comparison to solving the C-NS. However, information is lost, and the resulting system of equations requires the closure of various unclosed terms, notably the Reynolds stress. * Ideal flow or potential flow equations: Start with the EE. Assume zero fluid-particle rotation (zero vorticity) and zero flow expansion (zero divergence). The resulting flowfield is entirely determined by the geometrical boundaries. Ideal flows can be useful in modern CFD to initialize simulations. * Linearized compressible Euler equations (LEE): Start with the EE. Assume that any flow variable f , such as density, velocity and pressure, can be represented as f = f_0 + f' , where f_0 is the value of the flow variable at some reference or base state, and f' is a perturbation or fluctuation from this state. Furthermore, assume that this perturbation f' is very small in comparison with some reference value. Finally, assume that f_0 satisfies \\"its own\\" equation, such as the EE. The LEE and its many variations are widely used in computational aeroacoustics. * Sound wave or acoustic wave equation: Start with the LEE. Neglect all gradients of f_0 and f' , and assume that the Mach number at the reference or base state is very small. The resulting equations for density, momentum and energy can be manipulated into a pressure equation, giving the well-known sound wave equation. * Shallow water equations (SW): Consider a flow near a wall where the wall-parallel length-scale of interest is much larger than the wall-normal length-scale of interest. Start with the EE. Assume that density is always and everywhere constant, neglect the velocity component perpendicular to the wall, and consider the velocity parallel to the wall to be spatially-constant. * Boundary layer equations (BL): Start with the C-NS (I-NS) for compressible (incompressible) boundary layers. Assume that there are thin regions next to walls where spatial gradients perpendicular to the wall are much larger than those parallel to the wall. * Bernoulli equation: Start with the EE. Assume that density variations depend only on pressure variations. See Bernoulli's Principle. * Steady Bernoulli equation: Start with the Bernoulli Equation and assume a steady flow. Or start with the EE and assume that the flow is steady and integrate the resulting equation along a streamline. * Stokes Flow or creeping flow equations: Start with the C-NS or I-NS. Neglect the inertia of the flow. Such an assumption can be justified when the Reynolds number is very low. As a result, the resulting set of equations is linear, something which simplifies greatly their solution. * Two-dimensional channel flow equation: Consider the flow between two infinite parallel plates. Start with the C-NS. Assume that the flow is steady, two-dimensional, and fully developed (i.e., the velocity profile does not change along the streamwise direction). Note that this widely-used fully-developed assumption can be inadequate in some instances, such as some compressible, microchannel flows, in which case it can be supplanted by a locally fully-developed assumption. * One-dimensional Euler equations or one-dimensional gas-dynamic equations (1D-EE): Start with the EE. Assume that all flow quantities depend only on one spatial dimension. * Fanno flow equation: Consider the flow inside a duct with constant area and adiabatic walls. Start with the 1D-EE. Assume a steady flow, no gravity effects, and introduce in the momentum-conservation equation an empirical term to recover the effect of wall friction (neglected in the EE). To close the Fanno flow equation, a model for this friction term is needed. Such a closure involves problem-dependent assumptions. * Rayleigh flow equation. Consider the flow inside a duct with constant area and either non-adiabatic walls without volumetric heat sources or adiabatic walls with volumetric heat sources. Start with the 1D-EE. Assume a steady flow, no gravity effects, and introduce in the energy-conservation equation an empirical term to recover the effect of wall heat transfer or the effect of the heat sources (neglected in the EE). ==Methodology== In all of these approaches the same basic procedure is followed. * During preprocessing ** The geometry and physical bounds of the problem can be defined using computer aided design (CAD). From there, data can be suitably processed (cleaned-up) and the fluid volume (or fluid domain) is extracted. ** The volume occupied by the fluid is divided into discrete cells (the mesh). The mesh may be uniform or non-uniform, structured or unstructured, consisting of a combination of hexahedral, tetrahedral, prismatic, pyramidal or polyhedral elements. ** The physical modeling is defined ‚Äì for example, the equations of fluid motion + enthalpy + radiation + species conservation ** Boundary conditions are defined. This involves specifying the fluid behaviour and properties at all bounding surfaces of the fluid domain. For transient problems, the initial conditions are also defined. * The simulation is started and the equations are solved iteratively as a steady-state or transient. * Finally a postprocessor is used for the analysis and visualization of the resulting solution. ===Discretization methods=== The stability of the selected discretisation is generally established numerically rather than analytically as with simple linear problems. Special care must also be taken to ensure that the discretisation handles discontinuous solutions gracefully. The Euler equations and Navier‚ÄìStokes equations both admit shocks, and contact surfaces. Some of the discretization methods being used are:  Finite volume method  The finite volume method (FVM) is a common approach used in CFD codes, as it has an advantage in memory usage and solution speed, especially for large problems, high Reynolds number turbulent flows, and source term dominated flows (like combustion). In the finite volume method, the governing partial differential equations (typically the Navier- Stokes equations, the mass and energy conservation equations, and the turbulence equations) are recast in a conservative form, and then solved over discrete control volumes. This discretization guarantees the conservation of fluxes through a particular control volume. The finite volume equation yields governing equations in the form, :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\iiint Q\\\\, dV + \\\\iint F\\\\, d\\\\mathbf{A} = 0, where Q is the vector of conserved variables, F is the vector of fluxes (see Euler equations or Navier‚ÄìStokes equations), V is the volume of the control volume element, and \\\\mathbf{A} is the surface area of the control volume element.  Finite element method  The finite element method (FEM) is used in structural analysis of solids, but is also applicable to fluids. However, the FEM formulation requires special care to ensure a conservative solution. The FEM formulation has been adapted for use with fluid dynamics governing equations. Although FEM must be carefully formulated to be conservative, it is much more stable than the finite volume approach. However, FEM can require more memory and has slower solution times than the FVM. In this method, a weighted residual equation is formed: :R_i = \\\\iiint W_i Q \\\\, dV^e where R_i is the equation residual at an element vertex i, Q is the conservation equation expressed on an element basis, W_i is the weight factor, and V^{e} is the volume of the element.  Finite difference method  The finite difference method (FDM) has historical importance and is simple to program. It is currently only used in few specialized codes, which handle complex geometry with high accuracy and efficiency by using embedded boundaries or overlapping grids (with the solution interpolated across each grid). : \\\\frac{\\\\partial Q}{\\\\partial t}+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x}+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial y}+ \\\\frac{\\\\partial H}{\\\\partial z}=0 where Q is the vector of conserved variables, and F, G, and H are the fluxes in the x, y, and z directions respectively.  Spectral element method  Spectral element method is a finite element type method. It requires the mathematical problem (the partial differential equation) to be cast in a weak formulation. This is typically done by multiplying the differential equation by an arbitrary test function and integrating over the whole domain. Purely mathematically, the test functions are completely arbitrary - they belong to an infinite-dimensional function space. Clearly an infinite-dimensional function space cannot be represented on a discrete spectral element mesh; this is where the spectral element discretization begins. The most crucial thing is the choice of interpolating and testing functions. In a standard, low order FEM in 2D, for quadrilateral elements the most typical choice is the bilinear test or interpolating function of the form v(x,y) = ax+by+cxy+d. In a spectral element method however, the interpolating and test functions are chosen to be polynomials of a very high order (typically e.g. of the 10th order in CFD applications). This guarantees the rapid convergence of the method. Furthermore, very efficient integration procedures must be used, since the number of integrations to be performed in numerical codes is big. Thus, high order Gauss integration quadratures are employed, since they achieve the highest accuracy with the smallest number of computations to be carried out. At the time there are some academic CFD codes based on the spectral element method and some more are currently under development, since the new time- stepping schemes arise in the scientific world.  Lattice Boltzmann method  The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) with its simplified kinetic picture on a lattice provides a computationally efficient description of hydrodynamics. Unlike the traditional CFD methods, which solve the conservation equations of macroscopic properties (i.e., mass, momentum, and energy) numerically, LBM models the fluid consisting of fictive particles, and such particles perform consecutive propagation and collision processes over a discrete lattice mesh. In this method, one works with the discrete in space and time version of the kinetic evolution equation in the Boltzmann Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) form.  Boundary element method  In the boundary element method, the boundary occupied by the fluid is divided into a surface mesh.  High-resolution discretization schemes  High-resolution schemes are used where shocks or discontinuities are present. Capturing sharp changes in the solution requires the use of second or higher-order numerical schemes that do not introduce spurious oscillations. This usually necessitates the application of flux limiters to ensure that the solution is total variation diminishing. ===Turbulence models=== In computational modeling of turbulent flows, one common objective is to obtain a model that can predict quantities of interest, such as fluid velocity, for use in engineering designs of the system being modeled. For turbulent flows, the range of length scales and complexity of phenomena involved in turbulence make most modeling approaches prohibitively expensive; the resolution required to resolve all scales involved in turbulence is beyond what is computationally possible. The primary approach in such cases is to create numerical models to approximate unresolved phenomena. This section lists some commonly used computational models for turbulent flows. Turbulence models can be classified based on computational expense, which corresponds to the range of scales that are modeled versus resolved (the more turbulent scales that are resolved, the finer the resolution of the simulation, and therefore the higher the computational cost). If a majority or all of the turbulent scales are not modeled, the computational cost is very low, but the tradeoff comes in the form of decreased accuracy. In addition to the wide range of length and time scales and the associated computational cost, the governing equations of fluid dynamics contain a non-linear convection term and a non-linear and non-local pressure gradient term. These nonlinear equations must be solved numerically with the appropriate boundary and initial conditions.  Reynolds-averaged Navier‚ÄìStokes  Reynolds- averaged Navier‚ÄìStokes (RANS) equations are the oldest approach to turbulence modeling. An ensemble version of the governing equations is solved, which introduces new apparent stresses known as Reynolds stresses. This adds a second order tensor of unknowns for which various models can provide different levels of closure. It is a common misconception that the RANS equations do not apply to flows with a time-varying mean flow because these equations are 'time-averaged'. In fact, statistically unsteady (or non-stationary) flows can equally be treated. This is sometimes referred to as URANS. There is nothing inherent in Reynolds averaging to preclude this, but the turbulence models used to close the equations are valid only as long as the time over which these changes in the mean occur is large compared to the time scales of the turbulent motion containing most of the energy. RANS models can be divided into two broad approaches: ; Boussinesq hypothesis: This method involves using an algebraic equation for the Reynolds stresses which include determining the turbulent viscosity, and depending on the level of sophistication of the model, solving transport equations for determining the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation. Models include k-Œµ (Launder and Spalding), Mixing Length Model (Prandtl), and Zero Equation Model (Cebeci and Smith). The models available in this approach are often referred to by the number of transport equations associated with the method. For example, the Mixing Length model is a \\"Zero Equation\\" model because no transport equations are solved; the k-\\\\epsilon is a \\"Two Equation\\" model because two transport equations (one for k and one for \\\\epsilon) are solved. ; Reynolds stress model (RSM): This approach attempts to actually solve transport equations for the Reynolds stresses. This means introduction of several transport equations for all the Reynolds stresses and hence this approach is much more costly in CPU effort. Large eddy simulation Volume rendering of a non-premixed swirl flame as simulated by LES. Large eddy simulation (LES) is a technique in which the smallest scales of the flow are removed through a filtering operation, and their effect modeled using subgrid scale models. This allows the largest and most important scales of the turbulence to be resolved, while greatly reducing the computational cost incurred by the smallest scales. This method requires greater computational resources than RANS methods, but is far cheaper than DNS. Detached eddy simulation Detached eddy simulations (DES) is a modification of a RANS model in which the model switches to a subgrid scale formulation in regions fine enough for LES calculations. Regions near solid boundaries and where the turbulent length scale is less than the maximum grid dimension are assigned the RANS mode of solution. As the turbulent length scale exceeds the grid dimension, the regions are solved using the LES mode. Therefore, the grid resolution for DES is not as demanding as pure LES, thereby considerably cutting down the cost of the computation. Though DES was initially formulated for the Spalart-Allmaras model (Spalart et al., 1997), it can be implemented with other RANS models (Strelets, 2001), by appropriately modifying the length scale which is explicitly or implicitly involved in the RANS model. So while Spalart‚ÄìAllmaras model based DES acts as LES with a wall model, DES based on other models (like two equation models) behave as a hybrid RANS-LES model. Grid generation is more complicated than for a simple RANS or LES case due to the RANS-LES switch. DES is a non-zonal approach and provides a single smooth velocity field across the RANS and the LES regions of the solutions. Direct numerical simulation Direct numerical simulation (DNS) resolves the entire range of turbulent length scales. This marginalizes the effect of models, but is extremely expensive. The computational cost is proportional to Re^{3}. DNS is intractable for flows with complex geometries or flow configurations. Coherent vortex simulation The coherent vortex simulation approach decomposes the turbulent flow field into a coherent part, consisting of organized vortical motion, and the incoherent part, which is the random background flow. This decomposition is done using wavelet filtering. The approach has much in common with LES, since it uses decomposition and resolves only the filtered portion, but different in that it does not use a linear, low-pass filter. Instead, the filtering operation is based on wavelets, and the filter can be adapted as the flow field evolves. Farge and Schneider tested the CVS method with two flow configurations and showed that the coherent portion of the flow exhibited the -\\\\frac{40}{39} energy spectrum exhibited by the total flow, and corresponded to coherent structures (vortex tubes), while the incoherent parts of the flow composed homogeneous background noise, which exhibited no organized structures. Goldstein and Vasilyev applied the FDV model to large eddy simulation, but did not assume that the wavelet filter completely eliminated all coherent motions from the subfilter scales. By employing both LES and CVS filtering, they showed that the SFS dissipation was dominated by the SFS flow field's coherent portion. PDF methods Probability density function (PDF) methods for turbulence, first introduced by Lundgren, are based on tracking the one-point PDF of the velocity, f_{V}(\\\\boldsymbol{v};\\\\boldsymbol{x},t) d\\\\boldsymbol{v}, which gives the probability of the velocity at point \\\\boldsymbol{x} being between \\\\boldsymbol{v} and \\\\boldsymbol{v}+d\\\\boldsymbol{v}. This approach is analogous to the kinetic theory of gases, in which the macroscopic properties of a gas are described by a large number of particles. PDF methods are unique in that they can be applied in the framework of a number of different turbulence models; the main differences occur in the form of the PDF transport equation. For example, in the context of large eddy simulation, the PDF becomes the filtered PDF. PDF methods can also be used to describe chemical reactions, and are particularly useful for simulating chemically reacting flows because the chemical source term is closed and does not require a model. The PDF is commonly tracked by using Lagrangian particle methods; when combined with large eddy simulation, this leads to a Langevin equation for subfilter particle evolution. Vortex method The vortex method is a grid-free technique for the simulation of turbulent flows. It uses vortices as the computational elements, mimicking the physical structures in turbulence. Vortex methods were developed as a grid-free methodology that would not be limited by the fundamental smoothing effects associated with grid-based methods. To be practical, however, vortex methods require means for rapidly computing velocities from the vortex elements ‚Äì in other words they require the solution to a particular form of the N-body problem (in which the motion of N objects is tied to their mutual influences). A breakthrough came in the late 1980s with the development of the fast multipole method (FMM), an algorithm by V. Rokhlin (Yale) and L. Greengard (Courant Institute). This breakthrough paved the way to practical computation of the velocities from the vortex elements and is the basis of successful algorithms. Software based on the vortex method offer a new means for solving tough fluid dynamics problems with minimal user intervention. All that is required is specification of problem geometry and setting of boundary and initial conditions. Among the significant advantages of this modern technology; * It is practically grid- free, thus eliminating numerous iterations associated with RANS and LES. * All problems are treated identically. No modeling or calibration inputs are required. * Time-series simulations, which are crucial for correct analysis of acoustics, are possible. * The small scale and large scale are accurately simulated at the same time. Vorticity confinement method The vorticity confinement (VC) method is an Eulerian technique used in the simulation of turbulent wakes. It uses a solitary-wave like approach to produce a stable solution with no numerical spreading. VC can capture the small-scale features to within as few as 2 grid cells. Within these features, a nonlinear difference equation is solved as opposed to the finite difference equation. VC is similar to shock capturing methods, where conservation laws are satisfied, so that the essential integral quantities are accurately computed. Linear eddy model The Linear eddy model is a technique used to simulate the convective mixing that takes place in turbulent flow. Specifically, it provides a mathematical way to describe the interactions of a scalar variable within the vector flow field. It is primarily used in one-dimensional representations of turbulent flow, since it can be applied across a wide range of length scales and Reynolds numbers. This model is generally used as a building block for more complicated flow representations, as it provides high resolution predictions that hold across a large range of flow conditions. ===Two-phase flow=== Simulation of bubble horde using volume of fluid method The modeling of two-phase flow is still under development. Different methods have been proposed, including the Volume of fluid method, the level-set method and front tracking. These methods often involve a tradeoff between maintaining a sharp interface or conserving mass . This is crucial since the evaluation of the density, viscosity and surface tension is based on the values averaged over the interface. Lagrangian multiphase models, which are used for dispersed media, are based on solving the Lagrangian equation of motion for the dispersed phase. ===Solution algorithms=== Discretization in the space produces a system of ordinary differential equations for unsteady problems and algebraic equations for steady problems. Implicit or semi-implicit methods are generally used to integrate the ordinary differential equations, producing a system of (usually) nonlinear algebraic equations. Applying a Newton or Picard iteration produces a system of linear equations which is nonsymmetric in the presence of advection and indefinite in the presence of incompressibility. Such systems, particularly in 3D, are frequently too large for direct solvers, so iterative methods are used, either stationary methods such as successive overrelaxation or Krylov subspace methods. Krylov methods such as GMRES, typically used with preconditioning, operate by minimizing the residual over successive subspaces generated by the preconditioned operator. Multigrid has the advantage of asymptotically optimal performance on many problems. Traditional solvers and preconditioners are effective at reducing high- frequency components of the residual, but low-frequency components typically require many iterations to reduce. By operating on multiple scales, multigrid reduces all components of the residual by similar factors, leading to a mesh- independent number of iterations. For indefinite systems, preconditioners such as incomplete LU factorization, additive Schwarz, and multigrid perform poorly or fail entirely, so the problem structure must be used for effective preconditioning. Methods commonly used in CFD are the SIMPLE and Uzawa algorithms which exhibit mesh-dependent convergence rates, but recent advances based on block LU factorization combined with multigrid for the resulting definite systems have led to preconditioners that deliver mesh-independent convergence rates. ===Unsteady aerodynamics=== CFD made a major break through in late 70s with the introduction of LTRAN2, a 2-D code to model oscillating airfoils based on transonic small perturbation theory by Ballhaus and associates. It uses a Murman-Cole switch algorithm for modeling the moving shock-waves.Murman, E.M. and Cole, J.D., \\"Calculation of Plane Steady Transonic Flows\\", AIAA Journal , Vol 9, No 1, pp. 114‚Äì121, Jan 1971. Reprinted in AIAA Journal, Vol 41, No 7A, pp. 301‚Äì308, July 2003 Later it was extended to 3-D with use of a rotated difference scheme by AFWAL/Boeing that resulted in LTRAN3.Borland, C.J., ‚ÄúXTRAN3S - Transonic Steady and Unsteady Aerodynamics for Aeroelastic Applications,‚ÄùAFWAL-TR-85-3214, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH, January, 1986 ===Biomedical engineering=== Simulation of blood flow in a human aorta CFD investigations are used to clarify the characteristics of aortic flow in details that are beyond the capabilities of experimental measurements. To analyze these conditions, CAD models of the human vascular system are extracted employing modern imaging techniques such as MRI or Computed Tomography. A 3D model is reconstructed from this data and the fluid flow can be computed. Blood properties such as density and viscosity, and realistic boundary conditions (e.g. systemic pressure) have to be taken into consideration. Therefore, making it possible to analyze and optimize the flow in the cardiovascular system for different applications.Kaufmann, T.A.S., Graefe, R., Hormes, M., Schmitz-Rode, T. and Steinseiferand, U., \\"Computational Fluid Dynamics in Biomedical Engineering\\", Computational Fluid Dynamics: Theory, Analysis and Applications , pp. 109‚Äì136 === CPU versus GPU === Traditionally, CFD simulations are performed on CPUs. In a more recent trend, simulations are also performed on GPUs. These typically contain slower but more processors. For CFD algorithms that feature good parallelism performance (i.e. good speed- up by adding more cores) this can greatly reduce simulation times. Lattice- Boltzmann methods are a typical example of codes that scale well on GPUs. == See also == * Blade element theory * Boundary conditions in fluid dynamics * Cavitation modelling * Central differencing scheme * Computational magnetohydrodynamics * Discrete element method * Finite element method * Finite volume method for unsteady flow * Fluid animation * Immersed boundary method * Lattice Boltzmann methods * List of finite element software packages * Meshfree methods * Moving particle semi-implicit method * Multi-particle collision dynamics * Multidisciplinary design optimization * Numerical methods in fluid mechanics * Shape optimization * Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics * Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian method * Turbulence modeling * Visualization (graphics) * Wind tunnel ==References== ==Notes== * * ==External links== * Course: Introduction to CFD ‚Äì Dmitri Kuzmin (Dortmund University of Technology) * Course: Computational Fluid Dynamics ‚Äì Suman Chakraborty (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur) * Course: Numerical PDE Techniques for Scientists and Engineers, Open access Lectures and Codes for Numerical PDEs, including a modern view of Compressible CFD * Joukowsky Transform Interactive WebApp Category:Computational fields of study ","title":"Computational fluid dynamics"},{"id":"305927","text":"A vitrification experiment, using molten glass. Vitrification (from Latin vitreum, \\"glass\\" via French vitrifier) is the transformation of a substance into a glass, that is to say, a non-crystalline amorphous solid. In the production of ceramics, vitrification is responsible for its impermeability to water. Vitrification is usually achieved by heating materials until they liquidize, then cooling the liquid, often rapidly, so that it passes through the glass transition to form a glassy solid. Certain chemical reactions also result in glasses. In terms of chemistry, vitrification is characteristic for amorphous materials or disordered systems and occurs when bonding between elementary particles (atoms, molecules, forming blocks) becomes higher than a certain threshold value. Thermal fluctuations break the bonds; therefore, the lower the temperature, the higher the degree of connectivity. Because of that, amorphous materials have a characteristic threshold temperature termed glass transition temperature (Tg): below Tg amorphous materials are glassy whereas above Tg they are molten. The most common applications are in the making of pottery, glass, and some types of food, but there are many others, such as the vitrification of an antifreeze-like liquid in cryopreservation. In a different sense of the word, the embedding of material inside a glassy matrix is also called vitrification. An important application is the vitrification of radioactive waste to obtain a substance that is hopefully safer and more stable for disposal. During the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 C.E. a victim's brain was vitrified by the extreme heat of the volcanic ash. ==Ceramics== Vitrification is the progressive partial fusion of a clay, or of a body, as a result of a firing process. As vitrification proceeds, the proportion of glassy bond increases and the apparent porosity of the fired product becomes progressively lower.'Role Of Accessory Minerals On The Vitrification Of Whiteware Compositions.' N.M.Ghoneim; E.H.Sallam; D.M. Ebrahim. Ceram.Int. 16. No.1. 1990. Vitreous bodies have open porosity, and may be either opaque or translucent. In this context, \\"zero porosity\\" may be defined as less than 1% water absorption. However, various standard procedures define the conditions of water absorption.Whitewares: Production, Testing and Quality Control. William Ryan & Charles Radford. Institute of Materials, 1997'Methods Of Extending The Narrow Vitrification Range Of Clays.' E.V. Glass & Ceramics 36, (8), 450, 1979.'Control Of Optimum Vitrification In Vitreous And Porcelain Bodies.' E.Signorini. Ceram.Inf. 26. No.301. 1991 An example is by ASTM, who state \\"The term vitreous generally signifies less than 0.5% absorption, except for floor and wall tile and low-voltage electrical insulators, which are considered vitreous up to 3% water absorption.\\"ASTM C242-01. 'Standard Terminology Of Ceramic Whitewares and Related Products'. Pottery can be made impermeable to water by glazing or by vitrification. Porcelain, bone china and sanitaryware are examples of vitrified pottery, and are impermeable even without glaze. Stoneware may be vitrified or semi- vitrified; the latter type would not be impermeable without glaze.'Body Builders.' J.Ahmed. Asian Ceramics. June 2014 'An Introduction To The Technology Of Pottery.' Paul Rado, Institute of Ceramics. 1988. ==Applications== When sucrose is cooled slowly it results in crystal sugar (or rock candy), but when cooled rapidly it can form syrupy cotton candy (candyfloss). Vitrification can also occur in a liquid such as water, usually through very rapid cooling or the introduction of agents that suppress the formation of ice crystals. This is in contrast to ordinary freezing which results in ice crystal formation. Vitrification is used in cryo-electron microscopy to cool samples so quickly that they can be imaged with an electron microscope without damage. In 2017, the Nobel prize for chemistry was awarded for the development of this technology, which can be used to image objects such as proteins or virus particles. Ordinary soda-lime glass, used in windows and drinking containers, is created by the addition of sodium carbonate and lime (calcium oxide) to silicon dioxide. Without these additives, silicon dioxide will require very high temperature to obtain a melt, and subsequently (with slow cooling) a glass. Vitrification is used in disposal and long-term storage of nuclear waste or other hazardous wastes in a method called geomelting. Waste is mixed with glass-forming chemicals in a furnace to form molten glass that then solidifies in canisters, thereby immobilizing the waste. The final waste form resembles obsidian and is a non-leaching, durable material that effectively traps the waste inside. It is widely assumed that such waste can be stored for relatively long periods in this form without concern for air or groundwater contamination. Bulk vitrification uses electrodes to melt soil and wastes where they lie buried. The hardened waste may then be disinterred with less danger of widespread contamination. According to the Pacific Northwest National Labs, \\"Vitrification locks dangerous materials into a stable glass form that will last for thousands of years.\\" === Vitrification in cryopreservation === Vitrification in cryopreservation is used to preserve, for example, human egg cells (oocytes) (in oocyte cryopreservation) and embryos (in embryo cryopreservation). Currently, vitrification techniques have only been applied to brains (neurovitrification) by Alcor and to the upper body by the Cryonics Institute, but research is in progress by both organizations to apply vitrification to the whole body. Many woody plants living in polar regions naturally vitrify their cells to survive the cold. Some can survive immersion in liquid nitrogen and liquid helium. Additives used in cryobiology or produced naturally by organisms living in polar regions are called cryoprotectants. ==See also== * Cryogenics * Crystallization * Supercooling * Vitrified fort == Literature == * *Stefan Lovgren, \\"Corpses Frozen for Future Rebirth by Arizona Company\\", March 2005, National Geographic ==References== Category:Glass Category:Cryobiology it:Criopreservazione ","title":"Vitrification"},{"id":"305935","text":"Phelsuma astriata astriata is a subspecies of Seychelles small day gecko.

Some versions had the imprisoned person being an unknown or remote relative of the mark. Supposedly the prisoner cannot reveal his identity without serious repercussions, and is relying on a friend (the confidence trickster) to raise money to secure his release. In this classic pigeon drop game archetype, the confidence trickster offers to let the mark put up some of the funds, with a promise of a greater monetary reward upon release of the prisoner plus a non-pecuniary incentive, gaining the hand of a beautiful woman represented to be the prisoner's daughter.

He won every year from 1905 to 1911, and again in 1924 and 1925. A schoolmaster, Atkins treated chess as a hobby, devoting relatively little time to it and playing in only a handful of international tournaments. He was an extremely gifted player who would likely have become one of the world's leading players had he pursued the game more single-mindedly. FIDE, the World Chess Federation, awarded him the International Master title in 1950 in recognition of his past achievements. ==Non-chess life== Born in Leicester, Atkins was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys. In 1890, he went to Peterhouse, Cambridge, as a mathematical scholar.Coles 1952, p. 2.

He was then appointed principal of what later became Huddersfield New College in 1909, serving in that position until 1936.Coles 1952, p. 4. Atkins died on 31 January 1955 in Huddersfield, England.Jeremy Gaige, Chess Personalia: A Biobibliography, McFarland & Company, 1987, p. 16. . ==Chess career== Atkins is considered by many to be Britain's most talented player ever.Raymond Keene in Harry Golombek (editor), Golombek's Encyclopedia of Chess, Crown Publishers, 1977, p. 17. . A schoolmaster who played chess only in his spare time, he nonetheless became one of the strongest amateur players.Coles 1952, p. 1. He made a deep study of the games of Wilhelm Steinitz, and modeled his play so closely on Steinitz's that he became known on the European continent as \\"der kleine Steinitz\\" (\\"the little Steinitz\\").Fred Reinfeld, A Treasury of British Chess Masterpieces, Bell Publishing Co. (Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania), 1950, p. 70. Atkins learned chess from one of his brothers, and joined the Wyggeston School Chess Club at age 10.Philip W. Sergeant, A Century of British Chess, David McKay, 1934, p. 16. One of his sisters gave him a copy of Howard Staunton's treatise The Chess-Player's Handbook, which he closely studied. At 15, he joined the Leicester Chess Club and within two years was playing on first board. While in college, he also played on first board for Cambridge University.Anne Sunnucks, The Encyclopaedia of Chess, St. Martin's Press, 1970, p. 13. In four years playing for Cambridge he only lost one match game. Between 1895 and 1901, Atkins played in seven minor tournaments, winning four and finishing second or equal second in the others, and losing just 3 out of 70 games.David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld, The Oxford Companion to Chess (2nd ed. 1992), p. 21. These included the minor tournament at the great Hastings 1895 tournament, where he finished equal second, behind G√©za Mar√≥czy, and was awarded the Newnes Cup for the best result by a British amateur.Keene in Golombek's Encyclopedia of Chess, p. 18.Gino Di Felice, Chess Results, 1747-1900, McFarland & Company, 2004, p. 159. .Sergeant, p. 225. At Bristol 1896, he yielded just one draw in nine games.Di Felice, p. 166.Sergeant, p. 228. At Southampton 1897, the Eighth British Amateur Championship, he scored an undefeated 8.5 points out of 10 possible, retaining his British amateur title.Di Felice, p. 173.Sergeant, pp. 230-31. At Craigside 1899, he scored 7.5/10, behind Amos Burn (9/10). At Amsterdam 1899, an amateur tournament that was Atkins' first international appearance, he achieved a rare perfect score, winning all 15 games and finishing 4 points ahead of the second-place finisher.Di Felice, p. 191.Sergeant, p. 235.Coles 1952, pp. 3-4. He scored 4/6, again finishing behind Burn (5/6), at Birmingham 1899.Di Felice, p. 192. At Bath 1900, he scored 12.5/14, yielding just 3 draws in 14 games.Di Felice, p. 200. At Llandudno 1901, a four-man double-round robin, Atkins was again bested by Burn, who scored 4.5/6 to Atkins' 3.5 points.Sergeant, p. 239. Between 1896 and 1911, Atkins participated in the annual 10-board cable match between Britain and the United States every year except 1909.Sergeant 1934, pp. 359-63. Atkins' best-ever result came at his first major international tournament, Hanover 1902.Jeff Sonas, Chessmetrics Player Profile: Henry Atkins. ChessMetrics.com. Retrieved on 2009-01-17. He finished third with 11.5/17 (8 wins, 7 draws and just 2 losses), behind David Janowski (13.5 points) and Harry Nelson Pillsbury (12 points), but ahead of Mikhail Chigorin and Frank Marshall, among others.Sergeant, p. 240. Chessmetrics ranks Pillsbury number 2 in the world at the time;Jeff Sonas, Chessmetrics Player Profile: Harry Pillsbury. Retrieved on 2009-01-15. Chigorin had played matches for the World Chess Championship in 1889 and 1892, and Marshall and Janowski would go on to do so in 1907 and 1910, respectively.B. M. Ka≈æiƒá, International Championship Chess: A Complete Record of FIDE Events, Pitman, 1974, pp. 209, 211, 214, 217. . Although Atkins could at this point have considered making chess his career, he did not, and indeed played in no international tournaments for the next 20 years because \\"he 'never found it possible again to play'\\". His record in the British Chess Championship is without parallel.Coles 1952, p. 5. Atkins played eleven times, winning in all but his first and last attempts. He first played at Hastings 1904, the first Championship organized by the newly formed British Chess Federation.Coles 1952, pp. 4-5. He tied for first with William Ewart Napier, each scoring 8.5/11. However, Atkins lost the playoff (3 draws, 1 loss) and was thus relegated to second place.Sergeant, pp. 244, 325. Remarkably, this was to be Atkins' worst result in the Championship for a third of a century. He proceeded to win the next seven Championships: Southport 1905 and Shrewsbury 1906, again scoring 8.5/11 each time; Crystal Palace 1907 (7.5/11); Tunbridge Wells 1908 (8/11); Scarborough 1909, where he tied for first with Joseph Henry Blake, each scoring 8.5/11, but won the playoff with 2.5/3; Oxford 1910 (8.5/11); and Glasgow 1911, tying for first with Frederick Yates at 8.5/11, and winning all three games in the playoff.Sergeant, pp. 245-46, 248, 250, 252, 254, 325-27. Coles writes, \\"His success in these years was all the more striking because of his lack of other first-class practice, which not infrequently caused him to get away to a bad start; yet such was his natural ability and determination that he invariably overhauled the field before the end as confidence and skill returned.\\" Atkins wrote the introduction to the first edition of Modern Chess Openings (1911).The introduction is reproduced in R. C. Griffith and J. H. White, Modern Chess Openings (2nd ed. 1913), Longmans, Green and Co. (London), pp. x-xii. After the 1911 Championship, Atkins retired completely from tournament chess for the next 11 years.Coles 1952, p. 5. He later remarked, \\"I really can't say why I didn't play after 1911 for so many years.\\" He had agreed to play in the 1919 Hastings Victory Congress, but withdrew at the last moment \\"by doctor's orders\\".Sergeant, pp. 265-66. In 1922, a major international tournament was organized in London, the first in almost a quarter of a century; many of the world's leading players agreed to compete, such as newly crowned World Champion Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca, Alexander Alekhine, and Akiba Rubinstein. Despite his long layoff from the game, Atkins was also invited, and agreed to play. After such a long hiatus, he unsurprisingly had a disappointing tournament, scoring only 6/15 and finishing 10th out of 16 players. He finished just outside the prize list, for the first and only time in his career.Coles 1952, pp. 5-6. However, did have the consolation of claiming among his victims Rubinstein and Savielly Tartakower. His appetite for competition having been stirred, he returned to the British Championship, playing at Southport 1924.Coles 1952, p. 6. This time he showed his old form, winning his eighth championship with his usual score of 8.5/11. The following year, he exceeded himself, winning at Stratford-on-Avon with his best-ever score of 9.5/11 (8 wins, 3 draws).Sergeant, pp. 274-75, 330. His final Championship appearance was in 1937, when he tied for third at the age of 65.Coles 1952, p. 7. Atkins also represented England at the Chess Olympiads of 1927 and 1935. Playing first board for England in the London 1927 Olympiad, he scored 3 wins, 8 draws, and 1 loss (58.4%), leading the English team to what author √Årp√°d F√∂lde√°k calls an \\"unexpected but well deserved\\" third-place finish.√Årp√°d F√∂lde√°k, Chess Olympiads 1927-1968, Dover Publications, 1979, pp. 14-15. .Sergeant, p. 77. England did not place this high again until Haifa 1976.Coles remarked in 1952 that England had not since attained so high a position. Coles 1952, p. 6.Between 1952 and 1972 England's best result was eighth place at Moscow 1956. Ka≈æiƒá 1974, p. 123.England finished tenth at Nice 1974.

Diggle recollected of Atkins:Edward Winter, Chess Note 5950 (quoting G. H.

He played it successfully against Marshall in a 1902 cable match between England and the United States, the game beginning 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.Nf3 Nbd7 6.e3 Ne4. (See \\"Notable games\\" section below.) Today, the ...Ne4 maneuver is generally referred to as the \\"Lasker Variation\\", after Emanuel Lasker, who later adopted it, but is also sometimes referred to as the \\"Atkins Variation\\". Today, Black usually employs a different move order, such as 1.d4 d5 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bg5 Be7 5.e3 0-0 6.Nf3 and now either 6...h6 7.Bh4 Ne4, or immediately 6...Ne4.D. Maroviƒá, Play the Queen's Gambit, Maxwell Macmillan, 1991, p. 87. . ==Playing strength== In 1950, FIDE, in its first award of international titles, awarded Atkins the International Master title in recognition of his past achievements. By Arpad Elo's calculation, Atkins' strength during his five-year peak was equivalent to an Elo rating of 2540.Arpad E. Elo, The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present, Arco Publishing, 1978, p. 175. . World Champion Emanuel Lasker believed that if Atkins had devoted more time to chess, he would have become one of the world's leading players. Sir George Thomas, one of Britain's leading players in the first half of the 20th century, observed, \\"H. E. Atkins ranks, indisputably, as the greatest figure in English chess since Amos Burn, and only lack of opportunity prevented him, in my opinion, from definitely establishing his position in the world championship class.\\" Anne Sunnucks writes that, \\"His devotion to teaching and his insistence on treating chess as merely a game was all that prevented him from becoming one of the leading players of the world.\\" == Notable games == Atkins (Black) won the following game at London 1922 against Savielly Tartakower (White), then one of the world's leading players.Tartakower-Atkins, London 1922. Retrieved on 2009-01-15. Tartakower thought highly enough of the game to include it in his book 500 Master Games of Chess.Dr. S.

The concept can be applied to entire systems, electrical interfaces, telecommunication signals, data communication protocols, file formats, and programming languages. A standard supports forward compatibility if a product that complies with earlier versions can \\"gracefully\\" process input designed for later versions of the standard, ignoring new parts which it does not understand. The objective for forward compatible technology is for old devices to recognise when data has been generated for new devices. Forward compatibility for the older system usually means backward compatibility for the new system, i.e. the ability to process data from the old system; the new system usually has full compatibility with the older one, by being able to both process and generate data in the format of the older system. Forward compatibility is not the same as extensibility. A forward compatible design can process at least some of the data from a future version of itself. An extensible design makes upgrading easy. An example of both design ideas can be found in web browsers. At any point in time, a current browser is forward compatible if it gracefully accepts a newer version of HTML. Whereas how easily the browser code can be upgraded to process the newer HTML determines how extensible it is. ==Examples== ===Telecommunication standards=== The introduction of FM stereo transmission, or color television, allowed forward compatibility, since monophonic FM radio receivers and black-and-white TV sets still could receive a signal from a new transmitter. It also allowed backward compatibility since new receivers could receive monophonic or black-and-white signals generated by old transmitters. ===Video gaming=== * The Game Boy is able to play certain games released for the Game Boy Color. These games utilize the same cartridge design as games for the original Game Boy, though the plastic used is typically black rather than gray and feature the GBC's logo on the label and packaging; Nintendo officially refers to such titles as being \\"Dual Mode\\".Game Boy - Compatibility Chart.

Meyer. This makes most new features degrade gracefully in older browsers. One case where this did not work as intended was script and style blocks, whose content is meant to be interpreted by the browser instead of being part of the page. Such cases were dealt with by enclosing the content within comment blocks.HTML Tag at w3schools.com: 'You can also use the comment tag to \\"hide\\" scripts from browsers without support for scripts [...]'. Because there is no mandatory upgrade of computers or web browsers, many web developers use a graceful degradation or progressive enhancement approach (often using unobtrusive JavaScript), attempting to make newly- created websites that are usable by people who have turned off Javascript or who have old computers or old web browsers or on a slow connection, yet still taking advantage of faster hardware and better JavaScript support in more modern web browsers, when available. \\"Graceful degradation versus progressive enhancement\\". ===Optical media=== Each of the three most common 12cm optical media formats (CD, DVD, and Blu-ray) was first released in read-only form years before writable forms were available. Within each format, there is both forward and backward compatibility, in that most older read-only drives and players can read (but not write) writable media in the same format, while read/write drives can read (but not write) old read-only media. There is no forward compatibility between formats; a CD player, for instance, can't read a DVD (a newer format), not even the audio tracks. There may be backward compatibility for better marketability (such as a DVD player playing an audio CD), but it is not intrinsic to the standards. ==NUC (not upwardly compatible)== Some products are not designed to be forward compatible, which has been referred to as NUC (not upwardly compatible). In some cases this might be intentional by the designers as a form of vendor lock-in or software regression. For example, a cubicle producer considers changing their cubicle design. One designer promotes changing the footprint from 4 foot square to 1.2 meter square. Immediately, the sales manager calls \\"NUC\\" and the problem is understood: if the footprint changes and existing customers are considering buying more from the producer, they will have to fit a different sized unit in an office designed for the 4 foot square cubicle. Planned obsolescence is a type of upward compatibility, but rather than adopting a policy of backwards compatibility, companies adopt a commercial policy of backwards incompatibility so that newer apps require newer devices. ==See also== * Backward compatibility * Bug compatibility, backward compatibility that maintains the known flaws * Computer compatibility * Downcycling * Future proofing * Repurposing ==References== ; Attribution ==External links== * Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think, in The Art of Unix Programming Category:Backward compatibility Category:Interoperability ","title":"Forward compatibility"},{"id":"305975","text":"The National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI Worldwide) is a non- profit 501 (c) (6) association of scuba instructors. It is a recreational dive certification and membership organization established to provide international diver standards and education programs. The agency was founded in 1960 by Albert Tillman and Neal Hess. NAUI is headquartered in Tampa, Florida, US) with dive and member instructors, resorts, stores, service and training centers, located in Japan, South Africa, the Middle East, Europe, Brazil and the Pacific Rim. It was officially CE and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certified in May 2007 in all three diver levels and both instructor levels and re-certified for its Scuba Diving Programs as meeting ISO and European Underwater Federation standards on November 24, 2015. The US Internal Revenue Service determined that NAUI be a tax-exempt, non-profit educational organization in 1971. Agency standards, policies, and ethics are governed by the Association's Board of Directors, who are members themselves and who are each elected through a democratic election process by the overall instructor membership. ==History== After Jacques-Yves Cousteau introduced the Aqua-Lung to the market, there followed a growing interest in scuba diving by the public and a subsequent need to codify the training. In 1951, Jim Auxie Jr and Chuck Blakeslee started a magazine called The Skin Diver (later renamed Skin Diver Magazine). Two-year dive teacher Neal Earl Hess contributed to its \\"The Instructors Corner\\" column to inform readers about scuba. He soon established a column called \\"The National Diving Patrol\\" as a section to name new skin and scuba diving \\"instructors.\\" Still, no official training and certifying agency existed, except for the training and resources provided by the military (Underwater Demolition Teams) and dive clubs. In 1952, Al Tillman, the director of sports for the L.A. County Parks and Recreation, said in a letter to Parks and Recreation director Paul Gruendyke, ‚ÄúA new sport‚Äîskin diving‚Äîis becoming popular in the area. Recently while diving in Palos Verdes, I ran into several divers in the water with me who didn‚Äôt know what they were doing. One had one of the new underwater breathing units that allows divers to stay under for long periods of time... I propose that my department get involved in this sport and provide training classes. I believe that diving will grow in the future and we have an obligation to make the sport as safe as possible.\\" In 1955, Tillman and L.A. County lifeguard Bev Morgan created the L.A. County Parks and Recreational Underwater Instructor Certification Course (1UICC) in an effort to respond to the growing number of diver requests. It was the world's first civilian training program to certify recreational divers and soon began granting Provisional Certification to instructors across the country. In the 1960 May issue of Skin Diver Magazine, The National Diving Patrol was announced as an official, national organization. Its purpose and function was \\"to insure competent underwater instruction and to reduce diving accidents through education.‚Äù In 1959, its name changed to the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI). Hess, Blakeslee, Auxier, and Tillman (NAUI #1) met in August 1960 to discuss and organize NAUI's first Instructor Certification Course (ICC). It was held at the Shamrock Hotel in Houston, Texas on August 22‚Äì26. During the six-day course, 72 candidates attended from the U.S. and Canada, but only 53 graduated. The 53 graduates and their staff instructors became the first instructor members of the National Association of Underwater Instructors. The NAUI ICC became the first course to make diver certification available worldwide and internationally. A year later, the second NAUI ICC was held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, under the direction of Ben Davis, NAUI #101. In October 1961, NAUI was incorporated in the State of California as a non-profit educational organization, with Al Tillman as the President and Neal Hess as the Executive Secretary. NAUI's first elected Board of Directors included Al Tillman (NAUI #1), John C. Jones, Jr. (NAUI #2), Neal Hess (NAUI #3), Garry Howland (NAUI #13), Jim Auxier, (NAUI #A4), and James Cahill, (NAUI #85). A Board of Advisers was appointed and included Captain Albert Behnke, Jr., Commander George Bond, Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau, and Dr. Andy Rechnitzer. The number of NAUI ICCs grew throughout the 1960s in central locations throughout North America. The association's conduct of business relied on volunteers and the board regional leaders, all administered out of Al Tillman's home. Skin Diver Magazine published the ‚ÄúNAUI Page‚Äù as a regular feature to help the organization grow, to accumulate a salary and, later, to provide office space.The first International Conference on Underwater Education (ICUE, IQ) was held in 1969 at Santa Ana College, where it served as a venue for NAUI members from all over could meet and exchange ideas. It was also used as a forum to present information on diving skills and safety, teaching, diving physiology, physics, and other diving and marine sciences. Soon, NAUI membership began to expand internationally‚Äîan ICC was held in Japan in 1970 and NAUI Canada was organized as a separate corporation in 1972. NAUI instructors certified more than 40,000 entry-level scuba divers in 1970 alone; 1979 was a year with over 5,000 newly certified NAUI scuba instructors. By the time 1989 came around, over 12,000 NAUI instructors were certified. NAUI Worldwide had established a network of 20 service centers in 1998. From 1981 to 1997, NAUI headquarters facilities remained in Montclair, California. It was during these years (in 1987) that the NAUI Board of Directors elected its first woman president: Nancy Guarascio (NAUI #5008). In 1997, NAUI Worldwide headquarters was moved to Tampa, Florida and included Board of Directors members from Europe and Asia for the first time. NAUI hired Jim Bram as its President in June 1995. Bram renamed NAUI to do business as NAUI Worldwide, with the intent to provide business support to members everywhere via licensed service centers. On January 9, 2015, Jim Bram (President and CEO) for NAUI Services Group announced his retirement. His leadership dedicated years of service to NAUI and NAUI Services Group. NSG services was designed to increase the net income of NAUI members through economic, social, marketing, communication, and educational opportunities. The duties of NSG were to represent the interest of the NAUI members, who represent the only shareholder's, and protect the assets and credibility of the Association. On January 20, 2015, the Ohio Board of Pharmacy amended Code 4729-21-06: Sales of medical oxygen to scuba divers. The code authorized individuals who completed courses from NAUI to purchase and possess medical oxygen for the purpose of emergency care or treatment at the scene of a diving emergency. In November 2015, NAUI released a series of announcements during the 2015 DEMA Show in Orlando, Florida. Its first podcast series, the \\"Dive Team Report\\", released once per week. The podcast was designed to inform the general public and divers on trends and issues affecting the sport of diving. The first full episode aired on November 12, 2015. A series of other announcements included its new marketing campaign ‚ÄúThe Definition of Diving,‚Äù its demo version of its new website interface (version 1.0), and its alliance with the Divers Alert Network (DAN) and Performance Freediving International (PFI]). For the first time, NAUI and DAN came together to offer DAN's first- aid programs to NAUI divers and members. NAUI established and incorporated the co-branded DAN-NAUI first-aid courses into their curricula. === NAUI Green Diver Initiative === In 2010, NAUI Worldwide formed the NAUI Green Diver Initiative (GDI). GDI was implemented to \\"empower individuals to preserve and conserve the ocean planet with the common goal of taking action to protect the environment.\\" With stagnant progress, it was not until July 2015 that NAUI renewed its commitment to the Initiative, unveiling its first manager, Sam Richardson, who entered the full-time position with over 10 years of non- profit experience. GDI remained a U.S. registered 501 (c) (3) non-profit that relied on the support of donors to fulfill its mission. == Honorary NAUI members recognitions == In the United States, US Navy SEALs, Coast Guard rescue divers and other special military forces are trained to NAUI standards as part of their overall training with open and closed circuit rebreathers; the National Park Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) divers receive NAUI training and certifications. Aqualung inventor Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau was on the original Board of Advisers of NAUI, as was Albert R. Behnke, a pioneer of diving medicine. Actor Lloyd Bridges was the first honorary NAUI instructor member. He played frogman \\"Mike Nelson\\" in the American television series Sea Hunt, which popularized scuba diving as a recreational sport. Zale Parry (NAUI A12) played the female role, and she formally instructed Lloyd Bridges on how to dive for the part. She was a research diver starring in the television's first underwater documentary series, Kingdom of the Sea, in 1954. She made a record-setting 209-foot dive that same year, distinguishing women as skilled divers. Olympic swimmer and movie star, Buster Crabbe was a NAUI instructor; along with 1996 Decathlon Olympian winner Dan O'Brien. Other celebrities who are certified NAUI divers include Kevin Costner, Lou Gossett Jr., and Cameron Diaz; Tiger Woods is a NAUI Divemaster member. === Corporate alliances === NAUI has numerous corporate alliances with organizations, such as Florida‚Äôs Walt Disney World Resort, The Florida Aquarium, NASA‚Äôs Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory, and the Fire Department of New York (FDNY). NAUI divers include Olympic and professional athletes, leaders in the scientific, academic, technical and military communities, and the Hollywood film industry. Many of the first generation of diving safety officers of the top universities, colleges and institutes of technology in the United States were NAUI members and made significant contributions to NAUI's programs, including: Lee Somers University of Michigan, James Stewart Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Richard Bell University of California, Davis, Henry Viex United States Military Academy, Lloyd Austin University of California, Berkeley, Mark Flahan California State University, San Diego, Phillip Sharkey University of Rhode Island, Ronnie D'Amico California State University, Long Beach, Walt Hendricks, Sr. University of Puerto Rico, Glen Egstrom University of California, Los Angeles, and John Heine Moss Landing Marine Laboratories. These institutions, and others, belong to the American Academy of Underwater Sciences, and while their training programs greatly exceed minimum NAUI requirements, certifications in their scientific diving training programs are often arranged through NAUI. Many governmental agencies in the United States do the same, including the US Navy, SEALs, Army Special Forces, and NASA. ==Courses== NAUI Advanced Diver certification card from 1985 NAUI produced a Scuba Diver Education System in 2000, and it began including its education systems to all mainline certification courses, listed below. === Recreational courses === *Junior Skindiver *Junior Scuba Diver *Junior Advanced Scuba Diver *Skin Diver *Scuba Diver *Experienced Scuba Diver *Advanced Scuba Diver *Master Scuba Diver === Specialty courses === *Deep Diver *Dry Suit Diver *Enriched Air Nitrox (EAN) Diver *Scuba Rescue Diver *Search and Recovery Diver *Training Assistant *Underwater Archaeologist *Underwater Ecologist *Underwater Environment *Underwater Photographer *Underwater Hunter and Collector *Wreck Diver (External Survey) === Leadership courses === *Assistant Instructor *Skin Diving Instructor *Divemaster *Instructor Preparation Course *Instructor *Instructor Trainer *Course Director === Technical courses === *Cave Diver (Levels I, II, and III) *Cavern Diver *CCR Mixed Gas Diver *Closed Circuit Rebreather Diver *Decompression Technique *Heliair Diver *Helitrox Diver *Ice Diver *Introduction to Technical Diving *Mixed Gas Blender and O2 Service Technician *Semi-closed Rebreather Diver *Technical Nitrox Diver *Technical Support Leader *Technical Wreck Penetration Diver *Tri-Mix Diver (Levels I & II) *Wreck Penetration Diver === NAUI programs ===  Insurance programs  NAUI is allied with Divers Alert Network, a non-profit organization for diver's assistance and medical research on recreational scuba diving safety, developed by Executive Director Dan Orr (NAUI #81) in 1980. DAN and NAUI allied in 2007 to work together for diver safety. DAN is the official dive accident insurance provider for NAUI. In November 2015, DAN and NAUI renewed their alliance to extend their reach of dive safety programs. NAUI initiated a worldwide coverage instructor liability insurance policy in 1974. This worldwide policy allowed members of the Bahamas, British Virgin Islands and other islands of the Caribbean, and military personnel stationed in various areas around the world to receive worldwide coverage.  First aid programs  NAUI's rescue certification course was first proposed and made available to members in 1981 to provide an alternative to the Red Cross training, which was previously required for leadership candidates in NAUI courses. It was created by the NAUI Board of Directors to avoid making NAUI programs dependent upon other agency certifications. == NAUI technical diving professional certifications == NAUI sanctioned nitrox training in 1992 and published standards for teaching technical diving in 1997. NAUI was the first training agency to certify all levels of scuba diving ranging from traditional recreational training through all levels of technical training. Technical diving includes methods that exceed the limits imposed on depth or immersion time for traditional recreational diving. It often involves the use of special gas mixtures (rather than compressed air) for breathing. NAUI standards for technical diving were developed by Tim O‚ÄôLeary (NAUI #10144) and published by NAUI Worldwide in 1997. NAUI's technical diving program requires special training, equipment, and qualified support teams. In 1997, the NAUI Technical Diving Division was created. NAUI formed a Technical Training Advisory Board and Rebreather Advisory Board, with Tim O'Leary as the Chairman for each, to assist in the development of technical diving standards and training. === Rebreathers approved for NAUI training === * MK 15 * MK 16 MOD 0: Air Diluent 150fsw / HeO2 200fsw MILITARY * MK 16 MOD 1: Air Diluent 190fsw / HeO2 300fsw MILITARY * PRISM TOPAZ * OXILUNG (MILITARY) * LAR V (MILITARY) * VOYAGER CCR AND SCR * The Evolution * The Inspiration * Poseidon Mk VI Discovery * InnerSpace Systems Megalodon * Hollis Prism 2 * JJ CCR * Hollis Explorer * Aqua lung FROG ===NAUI decompression algorithms and tables=== The reduced gradient bubble model (RGBM) is an iterative approach to staging diver ascents. It employs a dual phase approach with separated phase volumes as limit points, along with critical tensions across tissue compartments. It was developed by Dr. Bruce Wienke (NAUI #5343L) in 1988 at Los Alamos National Laboratories. He published the model in 1992. The algorithm is now incorporated into many dive computers and advanced dive planning software. Today it enhances the safety of serious deep and technical divers. NAUI's RGBM decompression tables were developed in 1997 exclusively for NAUI by Dr. Bruce Wienke (NAUI #5343L) and Tim O‚ÄôLeary (NAUI #10144L). NAUI began publishing the only decompression manual with a full set of RGBM tables in 2000 for air, nitrox and trimix for both open and closed-circuit diving. Recreational RGBM no-calculation tables were published in 2001 exclusively for NAUI for sea level through 10,000 feet, no-stop diving. == Accreditation and affiliations == The Chinese Underwater Association (CUA), in conjunction with the China Water Sports Administration (CWSA), officially legitimized NAUI to provide translated diver training materials and diver training in the People's Republic of China. The Malaysian Sport Diving Association (MSDA)] officially adopted NAUI standards for use in their diver training in Malaysia. NAUI is the diver training organization of choice of NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas (USA). NAUI's alliance with the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory provides training materials, certification cards and collateral materials for their scuba program. NAUI is the official dive training and certification organization of the Florida Aquarium, and official sponsor of their Guest Dive Experience programs, \\"Dive with the Sharks\\" and \\"Swim with the Fishes\\". NAUI is a member of the Universal Referral Program (URP), a worldwide customer service program that allows instructors to refer their students for certification dives with either NAUI or other diver training agencies. The URP was developed in 1998 through the cooperative efforts of IDEA, NASDS, NAUI, PDIC, SSI, and YMCA. PADI Instructors and facilities can also receive students and be registered as referral instructors and locations under the URP. == See also == * * * == References == == External links == *NAUI Worldwide website *NAUI Europe website *NAUI Pacific Rim website *For quality assurances purposes, NAUI lists names of individuals whose membership has been suspended, revoked or reinstated by NAUI Worldwide, those who have voluntarily resigned their membership and those individuals or dive businesses who have not ever been affiliated with NAUI.

He is the son of Robert Lebel art critic and close friend of Marcel Duchamp. ==Life and work== Lebel had his first exhibition in 1955 at Galleria Numero in Florence, Italy. After a brief period of time with Surrealists, Lebel exhibited in Milan and Paris, and then went on to exhibit at various museums and galleries around the world. He has regularly collaborated with artist and writer Arnaud Labelle- Rojoux. Beginning in 1955, Lebel published a poetry journal called Front Unique and organized various nomadic poetry festivals, such as La Libre Expression (Free Expression) in 1964 and Polyphonix in 1979. In the 1960s, Lebel translated into French and published various work by William S. Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Michael McClure, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Gregory Corso. In 1960, Lebel oversaw and partook in the first European Happening L'enterrement de la Chose in Venice. For his performance there - called Happening Funeral Ceremony of the Anti-Process - Lebel invited the audience to attend a ceremony in formal dress. In a decorated room within a grand residence, a draped \\"cadaver\\" rested on a plinth which was then ritually stabbed by an \\"executioner\\" while a \\"service\\" was read consisting of extracts from the French d√©cadent writer Joris-Karl Huysmans and le Marquis de Sade. Then pall-bearers carried the coffin out into a gondola and the \\"body\\" - which was in fact a mechanical sculpture by Jean Tinguely - was ceremonially slid into the canal.Joseph Nechvatal, Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing, 2009. p. 323 During the 1960s, Lebel closely followed the work of the avant-garde American theatre group The Living Theatre. He extensively interviewed the group's members and accompanied them during rehearsal, which would lead to the 1969 book Entretiens avec le Living Theatre. Lebel published the first critical essay in French on the Happening movements throughout the world, citing the 1920 Dada-Messe (First International Dada Fair) as the key precedent of the modern happening in Europe. After this, he produced over 70 Happenings, performances and actions on numerous continents, including Pour conjurer l'esprit de catastrophe (1962), D√©chirex (1965) and 120 minutes d√©di√©es au divin marquis (1966). In 1967 he staged in Gassin at the Festival de la Libre Expression Pablo Picasso's 1941 surrealist theatrical farce in six acts Le D√©sir attrap√© par la queue (Desire Caught by the Tail). For it, Lebel invited Soft Machine to perform and later that year Lebel was arrested for promoting nudity in Knokke, Belgium for a happening he did with Yoko Ono.Karen Moller,Technicolor Dreams, Olympia Press, pp. 94-95 In 1968, Lebel took part in the activities of Mouvement du 22-mars, followed by Noir et Rouge, an anarchist group, and the Socialist splinter group Informations et Correspondences Ouvri√®res. Lebel also followed the philosophical teachings of Gilles Deleuze at Faculty de Vincennes at Paris 8 University. 1980 Lebel organized a Performance Festival at the ARC - Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, amongst others with Harry de Kroon, Julien Blaine, Joel Hubaut and Barbara Heinisch. With Fran√ßois Pain he produced the 90 minute long Monument √† F√©lix Guattari, le film and in 1994 he installed a large assemblage entitled Monument √† F√©lix Guattari in the Forum of the Centre Pompidou. Since 2001 he has frequently exhibited his Manifestation Itin√©rante and his digital art morphing animation Reliquaire pour un culte de V√©nus that is based on the concept of v√©nust√© as put forward by Pierre Klossowski. In 2001, he was the guest curator at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts of the erotic work of Pablo Picasso called Picasso Erotique and appeared on the Charlie Rose show. The exhibition traveled to the Museu Picasso in Barcelona and Galerie nationale du jeu de paume in Paris. A book entitled Picasso Erotique was produced by Prestel Publishing in 2001 as a result of the show. This book contains texts by Lebel, Pablo Picasso, Annie Le Brun, Pascal Quignard, Patrick Roegiers and Malen Gual. In 2009, La Maison Rouge in Paris presented all facets of Lebel's work (artist, exhibition curator, writer, performer, and art festival organizer) in an exhibition entitled Jean-Jacques Lebel, Soulvements. The exhibition was divided into the following themes: Happenings, Insubordination, Poetry, Hallucination, Eros, Dada, War and the Rhizome - and was illustrated with works of primitive art, works by anonymous artists and others such as Johann Heinrich F√ºssli, Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Louise Michel, Charles Fourier, Ravachol, Guillaume Apollinaire, Marcel Duchamp, Pablo Picasso, Otto Dix, George Grosz, Andr√© Breton, Francis Picabia, Antonin Artaud, Victor Brauner, Bernard Heidsieck, Err√≥, Antonio Saura, and Peter Saul. Some three hundred works in all. The show curator was Jean de Loisy. La Maison Rouge In 2013, Laure Adler produced an extensive radio interview with Lebel called L'iconoclaste Jean-Jacques Lebel (in 5 parts) that was broadcast on France Culture.L'iconoclaste Jean-Jacques Lebel on France Culture In 2018 he co-organized at the Palais de Tokyo an exhibition on the theme of evil and repair called L‚ÄôUn et l‚ÄôAutre (One and the Other) Review of L‚ÄôUn et l‚ÄôAutre at Hyperallergic and also that year was honored by a solo exhibition of his early work at the Centre Pompidou entitled l'outrepasseur.

The group operates a wide variety of banking brands offering personal and business banking, private banking, insurance and corporate finance through its offices located in Europe, North America and Asia. In the United Kingdom, its main subsidiary companies are NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland,The Scottish Gaelic name () is used by its retail banking branches in parts of Scotland, especially in signage and customer stationery. Ulster Bank, NatWest Markets, and Coutts. The group issues banknotes in Scotland and Northern Ireland; , the Royal Bank of Scotland was the only bank in the UK to still print ¬£1 notes. Before the 2008 collapse and the general financial crisis, the Group was very briefly the largest bank in the world, and for a period was the second-largest bank in the UK and Europe and the fifth-largest in the world by market capitalisation. Subsequently, with a slumping share price and major loss of confidence, the bank fell sharply in the rankings, although in 2009 it was briefly the world's largest company by both assets (¬£1.9 trillion) and liabilities (¬£1.8 trillion).RBS et mon droit: HM deficits (FT Alphaville, accessed 20 January 2009) It had to be bailed out by the UK government through the 2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package. The government, as of June 2018, holds and manages a 62.4% stake through UK Government Investments. In addition to its primary share listing on the London Stock Exchange, the company is also listed on the New York Stock Exchange. ==History== ===The Royal Bank of Scotland Group=== By the late 1960s, economic conditions were becoming more difficult for the banking sector. In response, the National Commercial Bank of Scotland merged with the Royal Bank of Scotland. The merger resulted in a new holding company, the National and Commercial Banking Group being founded in 1968 with the merger formalised in 1969. The holding company was renamed The Royal Bank of Scotland Group on 4 July 1979. The late 1990s saw a new wave of consolidation in the financial services sector. In 1999, the Bank of Scotland launched a hostile takeover bid for English rival National Westminster Bank. The Bank of Scotland intended to fund the deal by selling off many of NatWest's subsidiary companies, including Ulster Bank and Coutts. However, the Royal Bank of Scotland subsequently tabled a counter-offer, sparking off the largest hostile takeover battle in UK corporate history. A key differentiation from the Bank of Scotland's bid was the Royal Bank of Scotland's plan to retain all of NatWest's subsidiaries. Although NatWest, one of the \\"Big Four\\" English clearing banks, was significantly larger than either Scottish bank, it had a recent history of poor financial performance and plans to merge with insurance company Legal & General were not well received, prompting a 26% fall in share price. On 11 February 2000, The Royal Bank of Scotland was declared the winner in the takeover battle, becoming the second largest banking group in the UK after HSBC Holdings. NatWest as a distinct banking brand was retained, although many back-office functions of the bank were merged with the Royal Bank's, leading to over 18,000 job losses throughout the UK.NatWest merger's mixed fortunes BBC News, 2000 ===Further expansion=== The new headquarters nearing completion in 2005 In August 2005, the bank expanded into China, acquiring a 10% stake in the Bank of China for ¬£1.7 billion. In 2005, the bank built a new international headquarters at Gogarburn on the outskirts of Edinburgh, and was opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The group was part of a consortium with Belgian bank Fortis and Spanish bank Banco Santander that acquired Dutch bank ABN AMRO in October 2007. Rivals speculated that RBS had overpaid for the Dutch bank although the bank pointed out that of the ¬£49bn paid for ABN AMRO, RBS's share was only ¬£10bn (equivalent to ¬£167 per citizen of the UK). Much later, the bank announced it was to scale back its international presence. \\"Let me spell it out very clearly: the days when RBS sought to be the biggest bank in the world, those days are well and truly over\\", Chief Executive Ross McEwan, who had been in charge of the bank for four months, said in unveiling plans to reduce costs by ¬£5bn over four years. \\"Our ambition is to be a bank for UK customers\\", he added. === 2008‚Äì2009 financial crisis === On 22 April 2008 RBS announced a rights issue which aimed to raise ¬£12bn in new capital to offset a writedown of ¬£5.9bn resulting from credit market positions and to shore up its reserves following the purchase of ABN AMRO. This was, at the time, the largest rights issue in British corporate history. The bank also announced that it would review the possibility of divesting some of its subsidiaries to raise further funds, notably its insurance divisions Direct Line and Churchill. Additionally, the bank's stake in Tesco Bank was bought by Tesco for ¬£950 million in 2008. On 13 October 2008, in a move aimed at recapitalising the bank, it was announced that the British Government would take a stake of up to 58% in the Group. The aim was to \\"make available new tier 1 capital to UK banks and building societies to strengthen their resources permitting them to restructure their finances, while maintaining their support for the real economy, through the recapitalisation scheme which has been made available to eligible institutions\\". HM Treasury injected ¬£37 billion ($64 billion, ‚Ç¨47 billion, equivalent to ¬£617 per citizen of the UK) of new capital into Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, Lloyds TSB and HBOS plc, to avert financial sector collapse. The government stressed, however, that it was not \\"standard public ownership\\" and that the banks would return to private investors \\"at the right time\\". Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, stated that the UK government would benefit from its rescue plan, for it would have some control over RBS in exchange for ¬£5 billion in preference shares and underwriting the issuance of a further ¬£15 billion in ordinary shares. If shareholder take-up of the share issue was 0%, then total government ownership in RBS would be 58%; and, if shareholder take-up was 100%, then total government ownership in RBS would be 0%. Less than 56 million new shares were taken up by investors, or 0.24pc of the total offered by RBS in October 2008.RBS now 58% owned by UK Government Telegraph, 28 November 2008 As a consequence of this rescue, the Chief Executive of the group, Fred Goodwin, offered his resignation and it was duly accepted. Sir Tom McKillop confirmed that he would stand down from his role as chairman when his contract expired in March 2009. Goodwin was replaced by Stephen Hester, previously the Chief Executive of British Land, who commenced work at the Royal Bank of Scotland in November 2008. On 19 January 2009, the British Government announced a further injection of funds into the UK banking system in an attempt to restart personal and business lending. This would involve the creation of a state-backed insurance scheme which would allow banks to insure against existing loans going into default, in an attempt to restore the banks' confidence.UK banking plan faces criticism BBC News, 19 January 2009 At the same time the government announced its intention to convert the preference shares in RBS that it had acquired in October 2008 to ordinary shares. This would remove the 12% coupon payment (¬£600m p.a.) on the shares but would increase the state's holding in the bank from 58% to 70%.RBS shares plunge on loss BBC News, 19 January 2009 On the same day RBS released a trading statement in which it expected to post full-year trading losses (before writedowns) of between ¬£7bn and ¬£8bn. The group also announced writedowns on goodwills (primarily related to the takeover of Dutch bank ABN- AMRO) of around ¬£20bn. The combined total of ¬£28bn would be the biggest ever annual loss in UK corporate history (the actual figure was ¬£24.1bn). As a result, during the Blue Monday Crash, the group's share price fell over 66% in one day to 10.9p per share, from a 52-week high of 354p per share, itself a drop of 97%. ===Mid-2008 onwards=== RBS' contractual commitment to retain the 4.26% Bank of China (BoC) stake ended on 31 December 2008, and the shares were sold on 14 January 2009. Exchange rate fluctuations meant that RBS made no profit on the deal. The Scottish press suggested two reasons for the move: the need for a bank mainly owned by HM Treasury to focus scarce capital on British markets, and the growth possibility of RBS's own China operations. Also in March 2009, RBS revealed that its traders had been involved in the purchase and sale of sub-prime securities under the supervision of Fred Goodwin. In September 2009, RBS and NatWest announced dramatic cuts in their overdraft fees including the unpaid item fee (from ¬£38 to ¬£5), the card misuse fee (from ¬£35 to ¬£15) and the monthly maintenance charge for going overdrawn without consent (from ¬£28 to ¬£20).Jones, Rupert. \\"Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest cut overdraft charges\\". The Guardian. 7 September 2009 The cuts came at a time when the row over the legality of unauthorised borrowing reached the House of Lords. The fees were estimated to earn current account providers about ¬£2.6bn a year.Osborne, Hilary. \\"Bank charges appeal reaches House of Lords\\". The Guardian 23 June 2009 The Consumers' Association chief executive, Peter Vicary-Smith, said: \\"This is a step in the right direction and a victory for consumer pressure.\\" In November 2009, RBS announced plans to cut 3,700 jobs in addition to 16,000 already planned, while the government increased its stake in the company from 70% to 84%. In December 2009, the RBS board revolted against the main shareholder, the British government. They threatened to resign unless they were permitted to pay bonuses of ¬£1.5bn to staff in its investment arm. More than 100 senior bank executives at the Royal Bank of Scotland were paid more than ¬£1 million in late 2010 and total bonus payouts reached nearly ¬£1 billion ‚Äì even though the bailed-out bank reported losses of ¬£1.1 billion for 2010. The 2010 figure was an improvement on the loss of ¬£3.6 billion in 2009 and the record-breaking ¬£24bn loss in 2008. The bonuses for staff in 2010 topped ¬£950 million. The CEO Stephen Hester got ¬£8 million in payments for the year. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite the Union, said: \\"Taxpayers will be baffled as to how it is possible that while we own 84% of this bank it continues to so handsomely reward its investment bankers.\\" In October 2011, Moody's downgraded the credit rating of 12 UK financial firms, including RBS, blaming financial weakness.UK financial firms downgraded by Moody's rating agency, BBC News (7 October 2011) In January 2012, there was press controversy about Hester's bonus‚ÄîHester was offered share options with a total value of ¬£963,000 that would be held in long-term plans, and only paid out if he met strict and tough targets. If he failed to do this, it would be clawed-back. The Treasury permitted the payment because they feared the resignation of Hester and much of the board if the payment was vetoed by the government as the majority shareholder.Treasury feared Hester and board would quit BBC 26 January 2012 After a large amount of criticismStephen Hester bonus puts David Cameron under pressure Guardian, 27 January 2012Sir Philip Hampton waives ¬£1.4m share award The Telegraph, 28 January 2012RBS chairman waives share-based bonus Reuters, 28 January 2012Ed Miliband must block Hester's Bonus Metro, 22 January 2012 in the press, news emerged of Chairman Sir Philip Hampton turning down his own bonus of ¬£1.4 million several weeks before the controversy. Hester, who had been on holiday in Switzerland at the time, turned down his own bonus shortly after.RBS boss Stephen Hester waives bonus: reaction The Guardian, 30 January 2012 In June 2012, a failure of an upgrade to payment processing software meant that a substantial proportion of customers could not transfer money to or from their accounts. This meant that RBS had to open a number of branches on a Sunday ‚Äì the first time that they had had to do this. RBS released a statement on 12 June 2013 that announced a transition in which CEO Stephen Hester would stand down in December 2013 for the financial institution \\"to return to private ownership by the end of 2014\\". For his part in the procession of the transition, Hester would receive 12 months' pay and benefits worth ¬£1.6 million, as well as the potential for ¬£4 million in shares. The RBS stated that, as of the announcement, the search for Hester's successor would commence. Ross McEwan, the head of retail banking at RBS, was selected to replace Hester in July 2013. On 4 August 2015 the UK government began the process of selling shares back to the private sector, reducing its ownership of ordinary shares from 61.3% to 51.5% and its total economic ownership (including B shares) from 78.3% to 72.9%. On 5 June 2018 the government reduced its ownership through UK Government Investments to 62.4%RBS, Equity Ownership Statistics, accessed 9 June 2018 at a loss of ¬£2 billion. ===Restructuring=== In June 2008 RBS sold its subsidiary Angel Trains for ¬£3.6bn as part of an assets sale to raise cash. In March 2009, RBS announced the closure of its tax avoidance department, which had helped it avoid ¬£500m of tax by channelling billions of pounds through securitised assets in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands. The closure was partly due to a lack of funds to continue the measures, and partly due to the 84% government stake in the bank.RBS avoided ¬£500m of tax in global deals The Guardian, 13 March 2009 On 29 March 2010, GE Capital acquired Royal Bank of Scotland's factoring business in Germany. GE Capital signed an agreement with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS) to acquire 100% of RBS Factoring GmbH, RBS's factoring and invoice financing business in Germany, for an undisclosed amount. The transaction is subject to a number of conditions, including regulatory approval. In January 2012, due to pressure from the UK government to shut down risky operations and prepare for tougher international regulations, the bank announced it would cut 4,450 jobs and close its loss-making cash equities, corporate broking, equity capital markets, and mergers and acquisitions businesses. This move brought the total number of jobs cut since the bank was bailed out in 2008 to 34,000. During 2012, RBS separated its insurance business from the main group to form the Direct Line Group, made up of several well-known brands including Direct Line and Churchill. RBS sold a 30% holding in the group through an initial public offering in October 2012. Further shares sales in 2013 reduced RBS' holding to 28.5% by September 2013, and RBS sold its remaining shares in February 2014. In October 2015, RBS sold its remaining stake in Citizens Financial Group, having progressively reduced its stake through an initial public offering (IPO) started in 2014. ===Williams & Glyn divestment=== As a condition of the British Government purchasing an 81% shareholding in the group, the European Commission ruled that the group sell a portion of its business, as the purchase was categorised as state aid. In August 2010, the group reached an agreement to sell 318 branches to Santander UK, made up of the RBS branches in England and Wales and the NatWest branches in Scotland. Santander withdrew from the sale on 12 October 2012. In September 2013, the group confirmed it had reached an agreement to sell 314 branches to the Corsair consortium, made up of private equity firms and a number of institutional investors, including the Church Commissioners, which controls the property and investment assets of the Church of England. The branches, incorporating 250,000 small business customers, 1,200 medium business customers and 1.8 million personal banking customers, were due to be separated from the group in 2016 as a standalone business. The planned company would have traded as an ethical bank, using the dormant Williams & Glyn's brand. In August 2016, RBS cancelled its plan to spin off Williams & Glyn as a separate business, stating that the new bank could not survive independently. It revealed it would instead seek to sell the operation to another bank. In February 2017, HM Treasury suggested that the bank should abandon the plan to sell the operation, and instead focus on initiatives to boost competition within business banking in the United Kingdom. This plan was formally approved by the European Commission in September 2017. ===2020 group rebranding=== On 14 February 2020, it was announced that RBS Group was to be renamed NatWest Group, taking the brand under which the majority of its business is delivered.Makortoff, Kalyeena RBS will change name to NatWest as Alison Rose begins overhaul The Guardian, 14 February 2020RBS Group to change its name to NatWest BBC News, 14 February 2020 On 16 July 2020 the company announced that the rebrand would take place on 22 July 2020. The change took effect on 23 July 2020. The NatWest Group is likely to remain state-owned until March 2025, a deadline which the UK Treasury has announced for selling all government shares in the business. ==Corporate structure== NatWest Group is split into four main customer-facing franchises, each with several subsidiary businesses, and it also has a number of support functions. ===Retail Banking=== Child & Co's headquarters in Fleet Street. The brand focuses on private banking. The segment comprises retail banking. In the United Kingdom, the group trades under the NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland and Ulster Bank names. The CEO of this franchise is David Lindberg appointed in September 2020. Key subsidiaries include: * NatWest * Royal Bank of Scotland * Ulster Bank ===Commercial Banking=== This franchise serves UK corporate and commercial customers, from SMEs to UK-based multinationals, and is the largest provider of banking, finance and risk management services to UK corporate and commercial customers. It also contains Lombard entity providing asset finance to corporate and commercial customers as well as some of the clients within the Private Banking franchise. The CEO of this franchise is Paul Thwaite appointed in November 2019. ===Private Banking=== This franchise serves high net worth customers, the CEO of this franchise is Peter Flavel appointed in March 2016. The key private banking subsidiaries and brands of NatWest Group that are included in this franchise are: * Coutts * Adam & Company * Drummonds Bank * Child & Co * NatWest and RBS Premier Banking ===NatWest Markets=== NatWest Group offices in Brindleyplace, Birmingham This segment, commonly referred to as the investment banking arm of NatWest Group, provides investment banking services and integrated financial solutions to major corporations and financial institutions around the world. NWMs areas of strength are debt financing, risk management, and investment and advisory services. NatWest Markets Securities is a key subsidiary, operating in the United States. The CEO of this franchise is Robert Begbie appointed in June 2020. ===Support functions=== The group is supported by a number of functions and services departments ‚Äì procurement, technology, payments, anti-money laundering, property, etc. ‚Äì and support and control functions: the areas which provide core services across the bank ‚Äì human resources, corporate governance, internal audit, legal, risk, etc. ==Controversies== ===Media commentary and criticism=== During Goodwin's tenure as CEO he attracted some criticism for lavish spending, including on the construction of a ¬£350m headquarters in Edinburgh opened by the Queen in 2005The Scotsman, 14 September 2005, Queen opens ¬£350m bank HQ and a $500m headquarters in the US begun in 2006,Slate, 1 December 2008 Who's the World's Worst Banker? and the use of a Dassault Falcon 900 jet owned by leasing subsidiary Lombard for occasional corporate travel.The Times, 6 April 2004, Banking star brought down to earth over jet-set perk In February 2009 RBS reported that while Fred Goodwin was at the helm it had posted a loss of ¬£24.1bn, the biggest loss in UK corporate history.The Guardian, 26 February 2009, RBS record losses raise prospect of 95% state ownership His responsibility for the expansion of RBS, which led to the losses, has drawn widespread criticism. His image was not enhanced by the news that emerged in questioning by the Treasury Select Committee of the House of Commons on 10 February 2009, that Goodwin has no technical bank training, and has no formal banking qualifications. In January 2009 The Guardian's City editor Julia Finch identified him as one of twenty-five people who were at the heart of the financial meltdown. Nick Cohen described Goodwin in The Guardian as \\"the characteristic villain of our day\\", who made ¬£20m from RBS and left the government \\"with an unlimited liability for the cost of cleaning up the mess\\". An online column by Daniel Gross labelled Goodwin \\"The World's Worst Banker\\", a phrase echoed elsewhere in the media.The Times, 20 January 2009, Hubris to nemesis: how Sir Fred Goodwin became the 'world's worst banker'The Journal, 26 January 2009, RBS's Fred Goodwin: the world's worst banker? Gordon Prentice MP argued that his knighthood should be revoked as it is \\"wholly inappropriate and anomalous for someone to retain such a reward in these circumstances.\\" Other members have also frequently been criticised as \\"fat cats\\" over their salary, expenses, bonuses and pensions.The Times, 13 October 2008, Brown targets fat cat pay after nationalising banks in ¬£37 billion bailoutThe Mirror, 7 May 2009, RBS fat cat Gordon Pell given ¬£10M pension potThe Guardian, 13 January 2010, Stephen Hester's fat-cat flapThe Independent, 19 April 2004, RBS braced for shareholder showdown over fat cat bonusesEvening Standard, 5 February 2009, Bailed-out bankers facing curbs on fat cat bonuses The Scotsman, 1 February 2010, Billy Bragg takes his fight to limit RBS bonuses to Speakers' CornerThe Telegraph, 27 March 2009, A game in which people are encouraged to get their revenge on the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief Sir Fred Goodwin has gone viral. ===Fossil fuel financing=== RBS was challenged over its financing of oil and coal mining by charities such as Platform London and Friends of the Earth. In 2007, RBS was promoting itself as \\"The Oil & Gas Bank\\", although the website www.oilandgasbank.com was later taken down. A Platform London report criticised the bank's lending to oil and gas companies, estimating that the carbon emissions embedded within RBS' project finance reached 36.9 million tonnes in 2005, comparable to Scotland's carbon emissions. RBS provides the financial means for companies to build coal-fired power stations and dig new coal mines at sites throughout the world. RBS helped to provide an estimated ¬£8 billion from 2006 to 2008 to energy corporation E.ON and other coal-utilising companies. In 2012, 2.8% of RBS' total lending was provided to the power, oil and gas sectors combined. According to RBS' own figures, half of its deals to the energy sector were to wind power projects; although, this only included project finance and not general commercial loans. ===Huntingdon Life Sciences=== In 2000 and 2001, staff of the bank were threatened over its provision of banking facilities for the animal testing company Huntingdon Life Sciences. The intimidation resulted in RBS withdrawing the company's overdraft facility, requiring the company to obtain alternative funding within a tight deadline. ===Canadian oil sands=== Climate Camp activists criticise RBS for funding firms which extract oil from Canadian oil sands. The Cree aboriginal group describe RBS as being complicit in \\"the biggest environmental crime on the planet\\". In 2012, 7.2% of RBS' total oil and gas lending was to companies who derived more than 10% of their income from oil sands operations. ==See also== * List of banks in the United Kingdom * List of systemically important banks * Systemically important financial institution * Too big to fail * European Financial Services Roundtable * High-yield debt * Inter-Alpha Group of Banks ==References== ==External links== * Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Banks of the United Kingdom Category:Banks of Scotland Category:Companies of Scotland Category:Companies based in Edinburgh Category:Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Organisations based in Edinburgh with royal patronage Category:Investment banks Category:Banks established in 1969 Category:Government-owned companies of the United Kingdom Category:1969 establishments in Scotland ","title":"NatWest Group"},{"id":"305982","text":"Nadia Younes (; June 13, 1946 ‚Äì August 19, 2003) was an Egyptian national who spent her entire career, for over 33 years, in the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization, rising to high-level posts in a variety of areas. She was born in Cairo, Egypt, and earned a Master of Arts degree in political science and international relations from New York University, and a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature from Cairo University.

There are also considerable risks involved in transporting the historic regalia by sea and land over such a great distance. For these reasons, a new crown was made specially for George V and Queen Mary's trip to India in 1911, where they were proclaimed as Emperor and Empress of India before the princes and rulers of India. The Crown Jewellers at the time, Garrard & Co, made the crown at a cost of ¬£60,000, which was borne by the India Office. ==Description== The Imperial Crown of India weighs and is set with 6,170 diamonds, 9 emeralds, 4 rubies, and 4 sapphires. At the front is a very fine emerald weighing . The king wrote in his diary that it was heavy and uncomfortable to wear: \\"Rather tired after wearing my crown for hours; it hurt my head, as it is pretty heavy.\\" Similar to other British crowns, it consists of a circlet with four crosses patt√©e and four fleurs-de- lis. However, the eight half-arches on top, which join at a typical monde and cross patt√©e, point upwards in the form of a Gothic ogee arch. The crown is the only crown of a British sovereign to have eight half-arches, in the style of continental European crowns, departing from the tradition of British crowns having two arches or four half-arches. ==Usage== George V wears the crown during the Delhi Durbar 1911 George and Mary were not crowned as emperor and empress at the ceremony; the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, did not think it appropriate for a Christian service to take place in a country where the people were mostly Hindu or Muslim. Instead, the king simply wore the crown as he entered the durbar, and the durbar was styled as an affirmation of the king's coronation, which had already taken place in the United Kingdom six months earlier. It has not been used since George V returned from India. On 15 August 1947, the Indian Empire was dissolved and the Dominions of India and Pakistan came into being. George VI and his British Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, agreed that \\"as long as the two new Dominions remained in the Commonwealth, the crown should be retained among the Crown Jewels, but if at later date one or both were to secede it might be contended that, in view of the fact that it had been purchased out of Indian funds, the crown should be vested in some Indian authority\\".Twining, p. 167. Whilst neither Dominion still exists, their Indian and Pakistani successor states are both still in the Commonwealth.

Original chants and melodies come from the general area inhabited by Quechuas (originally from Peru), Aymaras (originally from Bolivia), and other peoples who lived roughly in the area of the Inca Empire prior to European contact. This early music then was fused with Spanish music elements. It includes folklore music of parts of Peru, Boliva, and Ecuador. Andean music is popular to different degrees across Latin America, having its core public in rural areas and among indigenous populations. The Nueva Canci√≥n movement of the 1970s revived the genre across Latin America and brought it to places where it was unknown or forgotten. ==Instruments== panflute is among the most emblematic instruments of Andean music. The panpipes group include the sik√∫ (or zampo√±a) and antara. These are ancient indigenous instruments that vary in size, tuning, and style. Instruments in this group are constructed from aquatic reeds found in many lakes in the Andean region of South America. The sik√∫ has two rows of canes and are tuned in either pentatonic or diatonic scales. Some modern single-row panpipes modeled after the native antara are capable of playing full scales, while traditional sik√∫s are played using two rows of canes wrapped together. It is still commonplace for two performers to share a melody while playing the larger style of sik√∫ called the toyo. This style of voicing with notes interspersed between two musicians is called playing in hocket and is still in use today in many of the huaynos traditional songs and contemporary Andean music. Quenas (notched-end flutes) remain popular and are traditionally made out of the same aquatic canes as the sik√∫s, although PVC pipe is sometimes used due to its resistance to heat, cold and humidity. Generally, quenas are played only during the dry season, while vertical flutes, either pinkillos or tarkas, are played during the wet season. Tarkas are constructed from local Andean hardwood sources. Marching bands dominated by drums and panpipes are commonplace today and are used to celebrate weddings, carnivals and other holidays. ==Modern history== The twentieth century saw drastic changes in Andean society and culture. Bolivia, for example, saw a nationalistic revolution in 1952, leading to increased rights and social awareness for natives. The new government established a folklore department in the Bolivian Ministry of Education and radio stations began broadcasting in Aymara and Quechua. By 1965, an influential group called Los Jairas formed in La Paz, Bolivia; the quartet fused native sounds into forms suitable for urban Europeans and the middle class. One member of Los Jairas, Gilbert Favre (a Swiss-French flautist) had previously been an acquaintance of the Parras (√Ångel, Isabel, and their mother Violeta) in Paris. The Parras eventually began promoting indigenous music in Santiago, Chile. The late 1960s released native groups such as Ruphay, Grupo Aymara, and the emblematic quechua singer, Luzmila Carpio. Later Chilean groups such as Inti- Illimani and Los Curacas took the fusion work of Los Jairas and the Parras to invent nueva canci√≥n, which returned to Bolivia in the 1980s in the form of canto nuevo artists such as Emma Junaro and Matilde Casazola. The 1970s was a decade in which Andean music saw its biggest growth. Different groups sprang out of the different villages throughout the Andes Region. Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, and Argentina. Many musicians made their way to the big cities forming different bands and groups. One of the most legendary was Los Kjarkas, from Bolivia. Singing and composing songs that became huge hits in Bolivia and would later become Andean standards. They would later take Andean music to the rest of the world. ==Genres and relationships to other musical styles== *Carnavalito *Diablada *Tinku - Originated from the ritual of violent sacrifice to the mother earth to ensure the best look, good fortune and the prosperity of the next seasons crops. *K'antu - An ancient style of music and circle dance which is widespread since incaic or even preincaic epoch on the Peruvian and Bolivian highlands. *San Juanito - Originated in Ecuador, Northern Peru and Southern Colombia, formerly related to solar cult. *Huayno (way√±u) - Originated in colonial Peru as a combination of traditional rural folk music and popular urban dance music. High-pitched vocals are accompanied by a variety of instruments, including quena (flute), harp, siku (panpipe), accordion, saxophone, charango, lute, violin, guitar, and mandolin. Some elements of huay√±o originate in the music of the pre-Columbian Andes, especially on the territory of former Inca Empire. Huayno utilizes a distinctive rhythm in which the first beat is stressed and followed by two short beats. Huayno has some subgenres: Sikuri, Carnaval Ayacuchano, Hiyawa. *Harawi - Ancient traditional musical genre and also indigenous lyric poetry. Harawi was widespread in the Inca Empire and now is especially common in countries that were part of it: Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, partially Chile. Typically, harawi is a moody, soulful slow and melodic song or tune played on the quena. *Afro-Bolivian Saya *Chicha - Originated in Peru the late 1980s as a fusion of cumbia and huayno music. ===Cumbia=== Originally from the Caribbean coast of Colombia, cumbia became a hit in Peru and through much of Latin America. It was then adapted to a \\"Peruvian\\" version called \\"Chicha\\" that has become a popular style in the Andean region, especially among the lower socioeconomic strata of the society including Quechua and Aymara populations. Several Andean music genres have also borrowed elements originally introduced by the Peruvian \\"cumbia\\" such as electric bass guitars, electronic percussion and little from the original cumbia rhythm. ===Nueva canci√≥n=== Andean music has served as a major source of inspiration for the neo-folkloric Nueva canci√≥n movement that began in the 1960s, Nueva canci√≥n musicians both interpreted old songs and created new pieces that are now considered Andean music. Some Nueva canci√≥n musicians such as Los Jaivas would fuse Andean music with psychedelic and progressive rock. ===Rock en Espa√±ol=== While the rock en Espa√±ol wave of the 1980s and 1990s largely rejected Nueva canci√≥n and folklore in favor of hard rock, pop rock, punk, alternative rock and new wave sounds some elements of Andean music has been featured in rock en Espa√±ol songs such as Cuando pase el temblor by Soda Stereo and Lamento boliviano by Los Enanitos Verdes. ==Other notable groups and artists== *Bolivia Manta *Damaris *F√©mina *G√©ne-sis *Grupo Aymara *Los Jairas *Illapu *Inkuyo *Inti-Illimani *Los Incas *Victor Jara *Los Kjarkas *Violeta Parra *Quilapay√∫n *Rumillajta *Savia Andina *Sukay *Magaly Solier *Los Curacas *Jaime Guardia *Manuelcha Prado *Daniel Tinte ==References== *Brill, Mark.

It was mainly caused by disagreement on whether men should be conscripted to fight in the war, but also brought out many issues regarding relations between French Canadians and English Canadians. Almost all French Canadians opposed conscription; they felt that they had no particular loyalty to either Britain or France. Led by Henri Bourassa, they felt their only loyalty was to Canada. English Canadians supported the war effort as they felt stronger ties to the British Empire. On January 1, 1918, the Unionist government began to enforce the Military Service Act. The act caused 404,385 men to be liable for military service, from which 385,510 sought exemption. The most violent opposition occurred in Quebec, where anti-war attitudes drawn from French-Canadian nationalism sparked a weekend of rioting between March 28 and April 1, 1918. The disturbances began on a Thursday when Dominion Police detained a French-Canadian man who had failed to present his draft exemption papers. Despite the man's release, an angry mob of nearly 200 soon descended upon the St. Roch District Police Station where the man had been held. Rioters then ransacked the conscription registration office as well as two pro- conscription newspapers within Quebec City. The final and bloodiest conflict happened Easter Monday when crowds once again organized against the military presence in the city, which by then had grown to 1,200 soldiers. The soldiers were ordered to fire on the crowds, immediately causing them to disperse. Though the actual number of civilian casualties is debated, official reports from that day name five men killed by gunfire. Dozens more were injured. Among the soldiers are 32 recorded injuries that day, with no deaths. Monday, April 1, marked the end of the Easter Riots, which totalled over 150 casualties and $300,000 in damage. ==Background== Canada entered World War I on 4 August 1914.The Peoples of Canada, \\"A Post-Confederation History\\", J.M. Bumstead Colonel Sam Hughes was the Canadian Minister of Militia, and on 10 August he was permitted to create a militia of 25,000 men. Before the end of August 1914, Hughes had already created a training camp at Valcartier, Quebec, which was capable of housing 32,000 men. The first contingent of 31,200 Canadians, dubbed \\"Canada's Answer\\", arrived in Britain on October 14 for continued training. Hughes moved with incredible speed to create Canadian battalions which allowed Canadian troops to be kept together as units for the first time. Relatively few French Canadians volunteered. The experience of the first contingent suggested that they could expect nothing but ill-treatment as French-speaking Catholics in English-speaking battalions filled with what they perceived as mostly Protestant men and officers who were unable to communicate with them. Young French Canadians seeking to serve, chose, instead, the few traditional \\"French\\" regiments of the Canadian militia, such as Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, where barracks life was in French, and only the command language was in English. They had to be turned away because the Minister of Militia and his subordinates were obstinate in their refusal to mobilize these traditionally French regiments or to create new ones. However, the government continued to raise its expectations for volunteers, aiming for 150,000 men by 1915. English Canadians did not believe that French Canada was providing a fair share to the war effort. Sam Hughes, on June 1917, informed the House of Commons that of the 432,000 Canadian volunteers fewer than 5% came from French Canada, which made up 28% of the Canadian population at that time. There have been many reasons proposed for the lack of Qu√©b√©cois volunteers; however, many prominent Canadian historians suggest that the Ontario government's move to disallow French language instruction in Regulation 17 as the main reason. Political pressure in Quebec, along with some public rallies, demanded the creation of French-speaking units to fight a war that was viewed as being right and necessary by many Quebecers, despite Regulation 17 in Ontario and the resistance in Quebec of those such as Henri Bourassa. Indeed, Montreal's La Presse editorialized that Quebec should create a contingent to fight as part of the French Army. When the government relented, the first new unit was the 22nd (French Canadian) Battalion, CEF. While a few other French-speaking groups were also allowed to be created, mostly by Reserve officers, they were all disbanded to provide replacements for the 22nd, which suffered close to 4,000 wounded and killed in the course of the war. As the war dragged on, soldiers and politicians soon realized there would be no quick end. Eventually, people learned of the trench conditions and some casualties in Europe, and men stopped volunteering. There were over 300,000 recruits by 1916, but Prime Minister Robert Borden had promised 500,000 by the end of that year, even though Canada's population was only 8 million at the time. ==Conscription Crisis 1917== After the Battle of the Somme, Canada was in desperate need to replenish its supply of soldiers; however, there were very few volunteers to replace them. The recruiting effort in Quebec had failed, and Canadian government turned to its only remaining option: conscription. Almost all French Canadians opposed conscription; they felt that they had no particular loyalty to either Britain or France. Led by Henri Bourassa, they felt their only loyalty was to Canada. English Canadians supported the war effort as they felt stronger ties to the British Empire. The Conscription Crisis of 1917 caused a considerable rift along ethnic lines between Anglophones and Francophones. After visiting Britain for a meeting of First Ministers on May 1917, Borden announced that he would introduce the Military Service Act on August 29, 1917. The Act was passed: allowing the government to conscript men aged 20 to 45 across the country if the Prime Minister felt that it was necessary. ==The election of 1917== To solidify support for conscription in the 1917 election, Borden extended the vote through the Military Voters Act to overseas soldiers, who were in favour of conscription to replace their depleted forces (women serving as nurses were also given the right to vote). For Borden, these votes had another advantage, as they could be distributed in any riding, regardless of the soldier's regular place of residence. With the Wartime Elections Act, women who were the wives, sisters, daughters and mothers of men serving overseas were also granted the right to vote in this election, as they appeared to be more patriotic and more worthy of a public voice. On the other hand, conscientious objectors and recent immigrants from \\"enemy countries\\" were denied the right to vote. In the election, Borden was opposed not only by Bourassa but also by Liberal Party leader Wilfrid Laurier, though he had been abandoned by much of his party. Laurier had opposed conscription from the beginning of the war, arguing that an intense campaign for volunteers would produce enough troops. He privately felt that if he joined the coalition government, Quebec would fall under what he perceived as a dangerous nationalism of Bourassa, which might ultimately lead to Quebec leaving the Canadian confederation. Borden's Unionist Party won the election with 153 seats; Laurier's Liberals secured 82 seats, 62 from Quebec. ==Conscription in practice== After the Military Service Act was passed in 1917 tensions ran high throughout Canada. Not all Canadians were as enthusiastic about joining the war effort as the first Canadian volunteers had been. In fact, many people objected to the idea of war completely. The conscientious objectors or unwilling soldiers sought exemption from combat. Instead, many joined the Non-Combatant Corps, where they took on other roles. Their duties consisted of cleaning and other labour. They did not carry weapons but were expected to dress in uniform, and they practised regular army discipline. Often the conscientious objector was abused, deemed a coward, and stripped of basic rights. In the British House of Commons a resolution for the disenfranchisement of conscientious objectors was defeated by 141 to 71. Lord Hugh Cecil, who was a well-known churchman and statesman, said that he was \\"entirely out of sympathy for conscientious objectors, but he could not force them to do what they thought was wrong or punish them for refusing to do something they thought was wrong\\". However, the government was making an effort to be sympathetic toward those who refused to take part in military service. Many communities set up local tribunals. If a man refused to serve he was put in front of a panel of two judges: one appointed by a board of selection named by Parliament, and the other by the senior county judge. The man was to plead his case, and if the panel was not convinced, the man asking for exemption was allowed to appeal. If the judges found that it was best if the person stayed at home, then he was not sent overseas. Many Canadians were unhappy with the conscientious objectors' choice to refuse combat. Many people believed that if people were not willing to give service against the enemy, then the only choice for them was between civil or military prisons. Conscription posed a difficult question for the government. Conscription was unprecedented, and the problem proved to be that the government did not know who was best suited to become a soldier, a toolmaker or a farmer. The issue of manpower and ensuring that the proper men were being relocated to the most appropriate roles overseas was an issue that lasted the duration of the war. ==Imperialism and nationalism== Even though 35,000 French Canadians served overseas throughout the war, the conscription question resulted in French Canadians feeling more isolated than ever from the rest of Canada. They never fully supported the war effort, which resulted in the Federal government expressing deep concern over French Canada's nationalist and anti-war stance. For the first time in Canada's brief fifty-year history, there were substantial arguments being made in favour of revoking the Constitutional Act of 1867. The nation was divided between English-speaking imperialists who supported the overseas war effort and French-speaking nationalists who believed that conscription was a second attempt to impose the Conquest, therefore it needed to be resisted at all costs. The Federal Conservatives had stated on numerous occasions that conscription would not be imposed. However, upon his return from London on May 1917, Borden met with his cabinet and announced that he would be imposing conscription. While in London, Borden had received a lot of pressure to send more troops to fully support the allied forces. He was convinced that Canada's war effort was weak and only conscription could make it respectable. All of his English-speaking ministers supported the idea. However, his two French-Canadian ministers were hesitant. They fully understood the negative reactions that French-Canadians would have. The French-Canadian nationalists who opposed conscription viewed it as neither necessary nor successful. They argued that it caused an avoidable rift between English and French-Canada.A. M. Williams, Conscription 1917 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1969), 1 The debate surrounding conscription would be one that would have a significant impact on both Federal and provincial politics for many years following World War I. ==Quebec Easter riots and the end of the war== On January 1, 1918, the Unionist government began to enforce the Military Service Act. The act caused 404,385 men to be liable for military service, from which 385,510 sought an exemption, The Military Service Act was vague and offered many exemptions, and almost all of these men were able to avoid service, even if they had supported conscription. The most violent opposition occurred in Quebec, where anti-war attitudes drawn from French-Canadian nationalism sparked a weekend of rioting between March 28 and April 1, 1918. The disturbances began on a Thursday when Dominion Police detained a French-Canadian man who had failed to present his draft exemption papers. Despite the man's release, an angry mob of nearly 200 soon descended upon the St. Roch District Police Station where the man had been held. By the following Good Friday evening, an estimated 15,000 rioters had ransacked the conscription registration office as well as two pro-conscription newspapers within Quebec City. Monument in Quebec City to commemorate the four people who died in the riots of late March 1918 This escalation of violence along with rumours of an alleged province-wide uprising prompted Quebec City Mayor Henri- Edgar Lavigueur to contact Ottawa and request reinforcements. Alarmed by the two days of rioting, the Borden Government invoked the War Measures Act of 1914, which gave the federal government the power to directly oversee the maintenance of law and order in Quebec City. By the following morning, 780 federal soldiers had been deployed in the city, with an additional 1,000 en route from Ontario and 3,000 from western provinces. Despite their imminent arrival, protracted violence continued into the night of March 30, leading into a precarious Sunday. The final and bloodiest conflict happened Easter Monday when crowds once again organized against the military presence in the city, which by then had grown to 1,200 soldiers ‚Äì all of whom came from Ontario. Once armed rioters began to fire on troops from concealed positions, the soldiers were ordered to fire on the crowds, immediately causing them to disperse. Though the actual number of civilian casualties is debated, official reports from that day name five men killed by gunfire. Dozens more were injured. Among the soldiers are 32 recorded injuries that day, with no deaths. Monday, April 1, marked the end of the Easter Riots, which totalled over 150 casualties and $300,000 in damage. The Easter Riots represent one of the most violent disturbances in Canadian history. This stemmed from a clash between English Canada's linkage to the British Empire and opposing currents in French-Canadian nationalism, which became exacerbated during wartime and ultimately erupted over conscription. Curiously, the event itself is rarely studied as anything other than a footnote to the larger political debate around conscription at the time. However, the severity and swiftness of Ottawa's response serves to demonstrate their determination to impose conscription and prevent a national crisis. Moreover, the military crackdown which lasted in Quebec until the end of the war resulted in an increase in state power in the wake of growing French-Canadian nationalism. By the spring of 1918, the government had amended the act so that there were no exemptions, which left many English Canadians opposed as well. Even without exemptions, only about 125,000 men were ever conscripted, and only 24,132 of these were sent to the front. The war ended within a few months, but the issue left Canadians divided and distrustful of their government. In 1920, Borden retired, and his successor, Arthur Meighen, was defeated in the 1921 election. Conservatives were virtually shut out of Quebec for the next 50 years. ==See also== *Conscription Crisis of 1944 *Franc≈ìur Motion *Conscription referenda in Australia *Conscription Crisis of 1918 in Ireland ==References== ==External links== * Sharpe, Christopher: Recruitment and Conscription (Canada), in: 1914-1918-online.

Ecuadorian music ranges from indigenous styles such as pasillo to Afro-Ecuadorian styles like bomba to modern indie rock. The Andes mountains house several indigenous styles of music, such as that of the Otavalo. Afro-Ecuadorian music is also a prominent part of the country's scene, with styles such as marimba and bomba stemming from the days of slavery. Pasillo, pasacalle, and yarabi are popular styles of folksong, with the former being similar to a flute and usually downtempo as it is descended from the waltz. Pasacalle is a form of dance music, while the sentimental yarabi is probably the most popular form in Ecuador. In recent years, cities such as Guayaquil and Quito have developed an indie rock scene that has allowed bands such as Da Pawn and La M√°quina Camale√∂n to achieve international popularity. ==Andean music (La Sierra)== Andean musician on stage. The mountainous, Andean region of Ecuador, the Sierra, is home to a style of music called . The music of the Otavalo people is well-known worldwide. A small panpipe called the rondador is the most distinctive instrument, but ensembles are typically groups of wind instruments, guitar trios (often including a bandolin), or brass bands. Folk rhythms include cachullapi, yumbo, and danzante. Musicians like Huayanay have helped to popularize Andean-Ecuadoran music. == Afro-Ecuadorian music == Afro- Ecuadorian music is mainly of two types. Marimba music comes from Esmeraldas, and gets its name from the prominent use of marimbas, along with drums and other instruments specific to this region such as the bombo, the cununo and the wasa. Marimba music also plays a part in Roman Catholic worship in and around Esmeraldas, as well as in celebrations and at parties. It features call and response chanting along with the music. Some of the rhythms associated with it are currulao, bambuco and andarele. In the Chota Valley, bomba music is the predominant style. The bomba style originates from its namesake instrument, a bomba drum. The drum is played in both single and compound duple meter and is typically accompanied by an ensemble of three guitars, a shaker, and vocals. The origins of bomba are disputed due to lack of written documentation, though it is known to have been created mostly by Afro- Ecuadorian slaves. Bomba was originally a style used only during celebrations and holidays, but following its rise to popularity and commercialization, it has been found in other contexts as well. Religious practice among afro- Ecuadorians is usually Roman Catholic. There is no significant African religion, although Catholic worship is distinctive in Esmeraldas, and sometimes is done with marimba music. == Pasillo == Pasillo is highly popular in Ecuador, where it is the \\"national genre of music.\\" In contrast to other styles of pasillo, however, Ecuadorian pasillo is slow and melancholic, often resting on themes of heartbreak and regret. Pasillo was named the \\"national style of Ecuador\\" and is the style of many city anthems, such as that of Guayaquil. Today, it has incorporated more European features of classical dance, such as waltz. As it spread during the Gran Chaco period, pasillo also absorbed the individual characteristics of isolated villages. This gives it an eclectic feel; however, the style, tone, and tempo of the music differ in each village. In its waltz, pasillo alters the classically European dance form to accompany guitar, mandolin, and other string instruments. == Ecuadorian Rock == Rock music came to Ecuador in the midst of military dictatorship in the 1960s. Within the context of political culture deeply shaped by Catholicism, rock music was considered to be a dangerous movement that seduced the youth. To left-leaning factions, rock was regarded as an expression of cultural imperialism that corrupts national popular culture. Consequently, groups such as the Catholic Church, the police, and government institutions denounced Ecuadorian rock music following its arrival. Several mestizo-bands in Ecuador made use of indigenous musical elements in rock music since the 1990s. Rocola Bacalao integrated Andean rhythms and made in their song-texts references to emblematic rural towns, such as Pujil√≠ in Cotopaxi. Sal y Mileto and Caser√≠a de Lagartos coined the genre of new Ecuadorian Rock. Nevertheless, in the 1980s and the early 1990s the rhythm of the social as expressed in Ecuadorian rock was characterized by hopelessness and resistance or even resignation against repression. With the emergence of a powerful indigenous movement, the rhythm changed. The most emblematic references towards the political impact of the indigenous movement are made by the metalband Aztra and the hardcore band CURARE at the beginning of the 2000s, during the a time of indigenous social protest against neoliberalism and for democratization.Olaf Kaltmeier 2019. \\"Rockin\`for Pachamama: political struggle and the narration of history in Ecuadorian rock music.‚Äù In: Sonic Politics.

Within the area of the city are the urban districts of B√ºtzfleth, Hagen, Haddorf and Wiepenkathen, each of which have a council () of their own with some autonomous decision-making rights. Stade is located in the lower regions of the river Elbe. It is also on the German Timber-Frame Road. ==History== The first human settlers came to the Stade area in 30,000 BC. Since 1180 Stade belonged to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. In early 1208 King Valdemar II of Denmark and his troops conquered Stade. In August Valdemar II's cousin being in enmity with the king, the then Prince-Archbishop Valdemar reconquered the city only to lose it soon after again to Valdemar II.Adolf Hofmeister, \\"Der Kampf um das Erbe des Stader Grafen zwischen den Welfen und der Bremer Kirche (1144‚Äì1236)\\", In: Geschichte des Landes zwischen Elbe und Weser: 3 vols., Hans-Eckhard Dannenberg and Heinz-Joachim Schulze (eds.) on behalf of the Landschaftsverband der ehemaligen Herzogt√ºmer Bremen und Verden, Stade: Landschaftsverband der ehem.

In 1209 Emperor Otto IV persuaded his ally Valdemar II to withdraw into the north of the Elbe, and the deposed Prince-Archbishop Valdemar took Stade. On 2 May 1209 Otto IV granted important town privileges () to Stade. Otto IV confirmed the burghers to be personally free and recognised them constituting a political entity of their own law, the burgenses and optimi cives of Stade.J√ºrgen Bohmbach, \\"Der werdende Territorialstaat der Erzbisch√∂fe von Bremen (1236‚Äì1511): III.

Property within the municipal boundaries could not be subjected to feudal overlordship and was to be freely inherited without feudal claims to reversion. Fair juridical procedures were constituted and maximal fines fixed. Otto IV obliged himself to prevent burghers from being taken as hostages and to liberate captured burghers. After Otto IV had changed his mind and reinvested Prince-Archbishop Valdemar with the See in 1211, Valdemar II recaptured Stade. In 1213 Otto's elder brother Count Palatine Henry V of the Rhine, reconquered Stade for the Prince-Archbishop. In 1215 Henry repelled another Danish attack on Stade. In the winter of 1216 Valdemar II and his Danish troops, unable to take the city of Stade, ravaged the County of Stade. From then on Stade remained a part of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. St. Cosmae et Damiani Church and St. Wilhadi, respectively. Stade in 1640 (drawing by Matth√§us Merian) New harbor during the 1894 flooding In medieval times (from the 13th century to the late 17th century), Stade was a prominent member of the Hanseatic League, but was later eclipsed by Hamburg. In 1611 the city signed a contract with Sephardic Jews, allowing the foundation of a community. In 1613, Johan Friedrich, Administrator of the Prince- Archbishopric, followed by settling Ashkenazic Jews in the city, but during the turmoil of Catholic conquest and Lutheran reconquest the last archival traces of Jews date from 1630. In 1648, by the Treaty of Westphalia, the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen underwent a constitutional transformation from a prince-bishopric into a monarchy, the Duchy of Bremen. The duchy and the neighboured Principality of Verden, colloquially referred to as Bremen-Verden, were granted by the Treaty of Westphalia as an appanage to the Swedish crown. Stade, already under Swedish occupation since 1645, was a part of the Swedish province of Bremen-Verden-Wildeshausen from 1645 to 1712, and some of the buildings built by the Swedes are still in use today. === Swedish fortress === Stade's heyday lasted until the Thirty Years' War. In 1628 Tilly conquered the town; shortly thereafter, Sweden took possession of it until 1636. After a period of Danish occupation, Sweden finally recaptured it in 1643 and was also officially granted possession of it, together with the Archbishopric of Bremen, in the Peace of Westphalia. Two-thirds of the town were razed in the great town fire on 26 May 1659. The town was rebuilt again to the same plan. From 1675 to 1676, in the Swedish-Brandenburg War, Swedish Stade was conquered during a campaign by Denmark and several states of the Holy Roman Empire and remained in allied hands until the end of that war in 1679. Stade, as the headquarters of the Swedish Stadhalter, was besieged from early April 1676 to 13 Aug 1676. In the wake of the Treaty of Saint Germain in 1679, Stade was once again awarded to Sweden. The Elbe customs station near Stade, in Brunshausen at the mouth of the Schwinge, played special role in trading on the River Elbe from the period of the archbishopric. In 1663, the Swedes stationed an Elbe customs frigate () as a permanent patrol ship. This arrangement continued to exist under various rulers until 1850 and the customs station on the Schwinge fieldworks itself existed until 1865.Richard Graewe: Die zweihundertj√§hrige Geschichte der Elb-Zoll-Fregatte zu Brunshausen und ihrer Kommandanten 1650‚Äì1850. Selbstverlag des Stader Geschichts- und Heimatvereins, Stade 1963 Swedish sovereignty ended in 1712. Danish troops besieged the town in the Great Northern War and shelled it from 29 August to 7 September 1712 that destroyed 152 houses, a quarter of the built-up area. During the Swedish times Stade was the capital of the province. === Danish rule === In 1712 Denmark conquered Stade and the whole of Bremen-Verden. Stade remained Bremen-Verden's capital also after the Danes ceded it to the Electorate of Hanover in 1715. When in 1823 Bremen-Verden was replaced by new administrative forms, Stade continued to be the capital of the Stade region. In 1355 and in 1712, Stade suffered from the plague epidemic, which killed at least 30‚Äì40% of the city's population. On 26 May 1659 a huge fire destroyed 60% of the city. === Early modern and modern period === In 1757 following the French Invasion of Hanover, the Army of Observation under Prince William, Duke of Cumberland, and the Privy Council of Hanover (government) took shelter in Stade. Cumberland prepared to defend the town before agreeing the Convention of Klosterzeven which brought about a temporary armistice. By the end of the 17th century Ashkenazi Jews reappeared in Stade. In 1842 the Kingdom of Hanover granted equal rights to Jews and promoted to build up Jewish congregations and a regional superstructure (rabbinate) within a nationwide scope. The Jews in Stade regarded this a progress and a burden alike, because prior they hadn't employed any rabbi and religion teacher due to the implied financial burden. In 1845 ‚Äì according to the new law ‚Äì a land-rabbinate, under Land-Rabbi Joseph Heilbut, was established in the city, serving 16 Jewish congregations, which were founded over the years in the whole Stade Region, with altogether 1,250 Jews in 1864 (highest number ever reached). The local authorities now requested, that the Jewish congregations establish synagogues and Jewish education for the pupils. Former synagogue of Stade, 2016 In 1849 Stade's synagogue opened, but had to close due to financial restrictions in 1908. And a teacher for Jewish religion and Hebrew was employed (after 1890 Stade's community couldn't afford a teacher any more). From 1903 on the Jewish community of Stade was granted public subsidies to continue functioning. The Stade Region stayed a Jewish diaspora, and from 1860 on Stade's land-rabbinate was never staffed again, but served alternately by one of the other three Hanoverian land-rabbinates. Labour migration and emigrationAbout a third of the Jews emigrated in the 19th century to the USA. Cf. J√ºrgen Bohmbach, Sie lebten mit uns: Juden im Landkreis Stade vom 18. bis zum 20.

During World War II, Stade remained completely untouched by allied bombings. Stade nuclear power plant (offline) in 2006 In past decades, Stade has economically benefited significantly from the presence of chemical and aerospace industry at the Elbe river, most notably Dow Chemical and Airbus. Also by the Elbe at Stade is the decommissioned Stade Nuclear Power Plant, which was connected to the power grid from 1972 to 2003. By the time the plant was brought offline, it was Germany's second oldest reactor. Following Germany's 2002 decision to phase out nuclear power generation, Stade was the first German plant to be affected; it was closed down permanently on 14 November 2003. Close to the former nuclear plant there is an inactive oil- fired power station, the Schilling Power Station. ==Notable places== The old town centre (, ) of Stade is home to a variety of notable historic buildings; among the most notable are the St. Cosmae et Damiani Lutheran Church, the Wilhadi Lutheran Church, the town hall (), the and the .

Still in operation today, La Borde has been a model in the field of institutional psychotherapy where citizens actively participate in running the facility. ==History== The clinic was founded by Jean Oury, a psychiatrist who previously worked in experimental therapy at Saint-Alban Psychiatric Hospital. The psychiatric practice borrowed the idea of Hermann Simon that it is necessary to look after the establishment and to look after each citizen, while returning initiative and responsibility to them by developing situations in which they can work and express their creativity. According to its constitution written by Oury, La Borde was founded on three principles: democratic centralism, a rotating basis for the division of labor, and anti-bureaucracy. From the mid-50s F√©lix Guattari worked at La Borde, developing its practice and organization and producing alongside Oury a body of theoretical work on the practice and theory of schizoanalysis, set in practice at La Borde, and included in his 1972 collaboration with the philosopher Gilles Deleuze, Anti-≈ídipus.See Guattari (1984) and Deleuze and Guattari (1972). Among the many aspects of La Borde is the annual summer tradition in which the \\"boarders\\" and staff work together to perform a play. Nicolas Philibert, the documentary film-maker, made a documentary set at La Borde entitled Every Little Thing (French La Moindre des choses).

The practice acquires many different definitions during the course of its development in their collaborative work and individually in the work of Guattari, and is distinct from the practice of psychoanalysis. Schizoanalysis \\"is at once a transcendental and a materialist analysis\\"Deleuze and Guattari, Anti-Oedipus (2004, 109). dealing with the real and yet nonfigurative aspects of the unconscious. In his work Chaosmosis, Guattari explains that \\"rather than moving in the direction of reductionist modifications which simplify the complex\\", schizoanalysis \\"will work towards its complexification, its processual enrichment, towards the consistency of its virtual lines of bifurcation and differentiation, in short towards its ontological heterogeneity\\".Guattari (1992, 61). ==Evolution of the idea== Schizoanalysis was developed over a long period of time as a response to the perceived shortcomings in the basic premises of psychoanalytic practice and as the culmination of Guattari's work with institutional psychotherapy at the La Borde clinic. Guattari was directly confronted with such problems in the work of Sigmund Freud‚Äînamely, the use of the Oedipus complex as a starting point for the analysis, and the authoritarian role of the psychoanalyst in relationship to the patient. Guattari was interested in a practice that could derive from given systems of enunciation and preexisting subjective structures new \\"assemblages [agencements] of enunciation\\" capable of forging new coordinates of analysis and to bring into existence unforeseen propositions and representations. By the time of \\"Five Propositions on Psychoanalysis\\" (1973),Gilles Deleuze, Desert Islands and Other Texts, 1953‚Äì1974, MIT Press, 2004 (pp. 274--280), originally published in \\"Relazione di Gilles Deleuze\\" and discussions in Armando Verdiglione, ed., Psicanalisi e Politica; Atti del Convegno di studi tenuto a Milano l'8‚Äî9 Maggio 1973. Milan: Feltrinelli, 1973, pp. 7-11, 17-21, 37-40, 44-45, 169-172. Abridged and edited Deleuze said \\"we no longer want to talk about schizoanalysis, because that would amount to protecting a particular type of escape, schizophrenic escape\\". ==Concepts== Deleuze and Guattari write in the fourth chapter of Anti-Oedipus, \\"Introduction to Schizoanalysis\\", that in effect, schizoanalysis asks \\"What are your desiring-machines, what do you put into these machines, what is the output, how does it work, what are your nonhuman sexes?\\".Deleuze and Guattari, Anti-Oedipus (2004, 322). ===Body without organs=== The body without organs is a central concept in schizoanalysis; Deleuze and Guattari write in A Thousand Plateaus that it is \\"the only practical object of schizoanalysis\\".Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus (1980, 203). It is \\"the unproductive, the sterile, the unengendered, the unconsumable\\",Deleuze and Guattari, Anti- Oedipus (2004, 8). a disorganized body of loose and erratic desires that they strongly identify with schizophrenia, as well as masochism and repressed forms of love, and that they compare in Anti-Oedipus to a desert of sorts. Bodies without organs are produced by the unconscious when desiring-production achieves its third nonproductive stage; a body without organs is \\"produced as a whole, but in its own particular place within the process of production, alongside the parts that it neither unifies nor totalizes.\\"Deleuze and Guattari, Anti-Oedipus (2004, 43). Deleuze writes in The Logic of Sense (1969) that \\"a body without organs, with neither mouth nor anus, having given up all introjection or projection, and being complete, at this price\\"Deleuze, The Logic of Sense (1990, 188)., is \\"closed on a full depth without limits and without exteriority.\\"Deleuze, The Logic of Sense (1990, 198). ===Four functors=== The four functors are concepts within a clinical model of the unconscious, laid out in the following schema: # Territories: finite existential subjectifications # Universes of value: virtual incorporeal alterifications # Fluxes: material, energetic and semiotic transformations # Phylums: concrete and abstract evolution of machines The territory is the object of deterritorialization and reterritorialization, while the flux and phylum are the components of abstract machines. With these functors, there are four circular components that bud and form rhizomes:Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus (1980, 160-2). # The generative component: the study of concrete mixed semiotics; their mixtures and variations, making a tracing of the mixed semiotics # The transformational component: the study of pure semiotics; their transformations-translations and the creation of new semiotics, making the transformational map of the regimes, with their possibilities for translation and creation, for budding along the lines of the tracings # The diagrammatic component: the study of abstract machines, from the standpoint of semiotically unformed matters in relation to physically unformed matters, making the diagram of the abstract machines that are in play in each case, either as potentialities or as effective emergences # The machinic component: the study of the assemblages that effectuate abstract machines, simultaneously semiotizing matters of expression and physicalizing matters of content, outlining the program of the assemblages that distribute everything and bring a circulation of movement with alternatives, jumps, and mutations ==Legacy== ===Nick Land=== British philosopher and theorist Nick Land, whose critical work and experimental texts in the 1990s frequently cited from Deleuze and Guattari, has written that \\"schizoanalysis shares in the delicious irresponsibility of everything anarchic, inundating and harshly impersonal.\\"Nick Land, Fanged Noumena: Collected Writings 1987-2007 (2011, 265). In his 1992 essay \\"Circuitries\\", Land describes the practice of schizoanalysis as a prescient method of analysis, and writes that it \\"was only possible because we are hurtling into the first globally integrated insanity: politics is obsolete. Capitalism and Schizophrenia hacked into a future that programs it down to its punctuation, connecting with the imminent inevitability of viral revolution, soft fusion.\\"Nick Land, Fanged Noumena (2011, 317). Land's later work in the 1990s, associated with the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit, also further reinterpreted and developed schizoanalysis in terms of cybernetics, cyberpunk aesthetics and occultism, most prominently in his 1995 essay \\"Meltdown\\": > Machinic Synthesis. Deleuzoguattarian schizoanalysis comes from the future. > It is already engaging with nonlinear nano-engineering runaway in 1972; > differentiating molecular or neotropic machineries from molar or entropic > aggregates of nonassembled particles; functional connectivity from > antiproductive static.

John Stuart Mill gives the example of a person about to walk across a damaged bridge. We can't tell the person the bridge is damaged as he doesn't speak our language. According to soft paternalism, we would be justified in forcing him to not cross the bridge so we could find out whether he knows about the damage. If he knows and wants to jump off the bridge and commit suicide then we should allow him to. Hard paternalists say that at least sometimes we are entitled to prevent him from crossing the bridge and committing suicide. ===Pure and impure=== Pure paternalism is paternalism where the person(s) having their liberty or autonomy taken away are those being protected. Impure paternalism occurs when the class of people whose liberty or autonomy is violated by some measure is wider than the group of persons thereby protected. ===Moral and welfare=== Moral paternalism is where paternalism is justified to promote the moral well being of a person(s) even if their welfare wouldn't improve. For example, it could be argued that someone should be prevented from prostitution even if they make a decent living off it and their health is protected. A moral paternalist would argue that it is ethical considering they believe prostitution to be morally corrupting. == Criteria for effective paternalism == Thomas Pogge argues that there are a number of criteria for paternalism. *The concept should work within human flourishing. Generally accepted items such as nutrition, clothing, shelter, certain basic freedoms may be acceptable by a range of religious and social backgrounds. *The criteria should be minimally intrusive. *The requirements of the criteria should not be understood as exhaustive; leaving societies the ability to modify the criteria based on their own needs. *The supplementary considerations introduced by such more ambitious criteria of justice must not be allowed to outweigh the modest considerations. ==Opponents== In his Two Treatises of Government, John Locke argues (against Robert Filmer) that political and paternal power are not the same. John Stuart Mill opposes state paternalism on the grounds that individuals know their own good better than the state does, that the moral equality of persons demands respect for others' liberty, and that paternalism disrupts the development of an independent character. In On Liberty, he writes: > [T]he only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any > member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to > others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. > He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better > for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinion > of others, to do so would be wise, or even right. Contemporary opponents of paternalism often appeal to the ideal of personal autonomy. ==In society== * In the Southern United States before the Civil War, paternalism was a concept used to justify the legitimacy of slavery. Women would present themselves as mothers for the slaves, or protectors that provided benefits the slaves would not get on their own. Plantation mistresses would attempt to civilize their workers by providing food, shelter, and affection. These women would justify that the conditions for freed blacks were poorer than those who were under the mistresses' protection. Paternalism was used as an argument against the emancipation of slavery due to these mistresses providing better living conditions than the enslaved's counterpart in the factory-based north.Erin R. Mulligan, \\"Paternalism and the Southern Hierarchy: How Slaves Defined Antebellum Southern Women\\", Armstrong Undergraduate Journal of History 2, no. 2, August 2012. As a result of this conclusion, the whites would often manage basic rights of the enslaved such as child rearing and property. * Paternalism was also used against women's suffrage, with opponents of women's suffrage saying that granting women the right to vote would make their lives harder and separate them from their families. ==See also== * Adultism * Authoritarianism * Company town#Paternalism * Fascism * Nanny state * Noble lie * Obscurantism * Rule according to higher law * Social conservatism ==References== ==External links== * Mill and Paternalism, by Gregory Claeys.

In 1659, while he was living in the town of B√©thune, it was captured by the army of Louis XIV of France. Henri Joulet, who accompanied Hennepin and wrote his own journal of their travels, called Hennepin a Fleming (a native of Flanders), although Ath was and still is a Romance-speaking area found in present-day Wallonia. Joulet's use of the term \\"Fleming\\" here denotes a lack of understanding or generalization of this demonym, which was common at that time.Profile, archive.org; accessed 20 November 2015. Painting by Douglas Volk, of Father Louis Hennepin seeing Saint Anthony Falls. Hennepin joined the Franciscans, and preached in Halles (Belgium) and in Artois. He was then put in charge of a hospital in Maestricht. He was also briefly an army chaplain.Corrigan, Michael. \\"Register of the Clergy Laboring in the Archdiocese of New York\\", Historical Records and Studies, Vol. 1, United States Catholic Historical Society, 1899 p. 34 At the request of Louis XIV, the R√©collets sent four missionaries to New France in May 1675, including Hennepin, accompanied by Ren√© Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle. In 1676 Hennepin went to the Indian mission at Fort Frontenac, and from there to the Mohawks. In 1678, Hennepin was ordered by his provincial superior to accompany La Salle on an expedition to explore the western part of New France. Hennepin departed in 1679 with La Salle from Quebec City to construct the 45-ton barque Le Griffon, sail through the Great Lakes, and explore the unknown West. Hennepin was with La Salle at the construction of Fort Crevecoeur (near present-day Peoria, Illinois) in January 1680. In February, La Salle sent Hennepin and two others as an advance party to search for the Mississippi River. The party followed the Illinois River to its junction with the Mississippi. Shortly thereafter, Hennepin was captured by a Sioux war party and carried off for a time into what is now the state of Minnesota.Shea, John Gilmary.

In September 1680, thanks to Daniel Greysolon, Sieur Du Lhut, Hennepin and the others were given canoes and allowed to leave, eventually returning to Quebec. Hennepin returned to France and was never allowed by his order to return to North America.Profile, Dictionary of Canadian Biography (online)]; accessed 20 November 2015.

Two great waterfalls were brought to the world's attention by Hennepin: Niagara Falls, with the most voluminous flow of any in North America, and the Saint Anthony Falls in what is now Minneapolis, the only natural waterfall on the Mississippi River. In 1683, he published a book about Niagara Falls called A New Discovery. The Regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton created a mural, \\"Father Hennepin at Niagara Falls\\" for the New York Power Authority at Lewiston, New York. ==Books by Hennepin== Illustration from the 1688 Dutch edition of Description de la Louisiane Hennepin authored: * Description de la Louisiane (Paris, 1683), * Nouvelle d√©couverte d'un tr√®s grand pays situ√© dans l'Am√©rique entre le Nouveau-Mexique et la mer glaciale (Utrecht, 1697), and * Nouveau voyage d'un pays plus grand que l'Europe (Utrecht, 1698). * A New Discovery of a Vast Country in America (2 volumes); reprinted from the second London issue of 1698 with facsimiles of original title-pages, maps, and illustrations, and the addition of Introduction, Notes, and Index By Reuben Gold Thwaites.

After taking holy orders, he exercised only legal functions for most of his career. However, from 1617 till his death he was Bishop of Lisieux. His reputation is that of a lawyer, a statesman and a man of letters. In 1584, he became counsellor of the parlement of Paris, and as deputy for Paris to the Estates of the League he pronounced his most famous politico-legal discourse, an argument nominally for the Salic law, but in reality directed against the alienation of the crown of France to the Spanish infanta, which was advocated by the extreme Leaguers. King Henry IV of France acknowledged his services by entrusting him with a special commission as magistrate at Marseille, and made him master of requests. In 1595, Vair published his treatise De l'√©loquence fran√ßaise et des raisons pour quoi elle est demeur√©e si basse, in which he criticizes the orators of his day, adding examples from the speeches of ancient orators, in translations which reproduce the spirit of the originals. He was sent to England in 1596 with the marshal de Bouillon to negotiate a league against Spain; in 1599 he became first president of the parlement of Provence (Aix-en-Provence); and in 1603 was appointed to the see of Marseille, which he soon resigned in order to resume the presidency. In 1616 he received the highest promotion open to a French lawyer and became keeper of the seals. He died at Tonneins (Lot-et-Garonne). Both as speaker and writer he was highly regarded. Like other political lawyers of the time, Du Vair studied philosophy. The most famous of his treatises are La Philosophie morale des Stoiques, translated into English (1664) by Charles Cotton; De la constance et consolation √®s calamit√©s publiques, which was composed during the siege of Paris in 1589, and applied the Stoic doctrine to present misfortunes; and La Sainte Philosophie, in which religion and philosophy are intimately connected. Pierre Charron drew freely on these and other works of Du Vair. Ferdinand Bruneti√®re points out the analogy of Du Vair's position with that afterwards developed by Blaise Pascal, and sees in him the ancestor of Jansenism. Du Vair had a great indirect influence on the development of style in French, for in the south of France he made the acquaintance of Fran√ßois de Malherbe, who conceived a great admiration for Du Vair's writings. The reformer of French poetry learned much from the treatise De l'√©loquence fran√ßaise, to which the counsels of his friend were no doubt added. Du Vair died at Tonneins, and his works were published in folio at Paris in 1641. ==References== * ==External links== * * Category:1556 births Category:1621 deaths Category:People from Paris Category:Christian writers Category:17th-century French writers Category:17th- century male writers Category:French Roman Catholics Category:Bishops of Lisieux Category:French lawyers Category:French philosophers Category:French religious writers Category:Neo-Stoics Category:French male writers ","title":"Guillaume du Vair"},{"id":"306064","text":"Ecosophy or ecophilosophy (a portmanteau of ecological philosophy) is a philosophy of ecological harmony or equilibrium. The term was coined by the French post-structuralist philosopher and psychoanalyst F√©lix Guattari and the Norwegian father of deep ecology, Arne N√¶ss. ==F√©lix Guattari== Ecosophy also refers to a field of practice introduced by psychoanalyst, poststructuralist philosopher, and political activist F√©lix Guattari. In part Guattari's use of the term demarcates a necessity for the proponents of social liberation, whose struggles in the 20th century were dominated by the paradigm of social revolution, to embed their arguments within an ecological framework which understands the interconnections of social and environmental spheres. Guattari holds that traditional environmentalist perspectives obscure the complexity of the relationship between humans and their natural environment through their maintenance of the dualistic separation of human (cultural) and nonhuman (natural) systems; he envisions ecosophy as a new field with a monistic and pluralistic approach to such study. Ecology in the Guattarian sense, then, is a study of complex phenomena, including human subjectivity, the environment, and social relations, all of which are intimately interconnected. Despite this emphasis on interconnection, throughout his individual writings and more famous collaborations with Gilles Deleuze, Guattari has resisted calls for holism, preferring to emphasize heterogeneity and difference, synthesizing assemblages and multiplicities in order to trace rhizomatic structures rather than creating unified and holistic structures. Guattari's concept of the three interacting and interdependent ecologies of mind, society, and environment stems from the outline of the three ecologies presented in Steps to an Ecology of Mind, a collection of writings by cyberneticist Gregory Bateson. == N√¶ss's definition == N√¶ss defined ecosophy in the following way: While a professor at University of Oslo in 1972, Arne N√¶ss, introduced the terms \\"deep ecology movement\\" and \\"ecosophy\\" into environmental literature. N√¶ss based his article on a talk he gave in Bucharest in 1972 at the Third World Future Research Conference. As Drengson notes in Ecophilosophy, Ecosophy and the Deep Ecology Movement: An Overview, \\"In his talk N√¶ss discussed the longer-range background of the ecology movement and its connection with respect for Nature and the inherent worth of other beings.\\" N√¶ss's view of humans as an integral part of a \\"total-field imageN√¶ss, Arne. (1972): Shallow and the Deep. Oslo: Inquiry.\\" of Nature contrasts with the alternative construction of ecosophy outlined by Guattari. The term ecological wisdom, synonymous with ecosophy, was introduced by N√¶ss in 1973. The concept has become one of the foundations of the deep ecology movement. All expressions of values by Green Parties list ecological wisdom as a key value--it was one of the original Four Pillars of the Green Party and is often considered the most basic value of these parties. It is also often associated with indigenous religion and cultural practices. In its political context, it is necessarily not as easily defined as ecological health or scientific ecology concepts. ==See also== * Ecology * Global Greens Charter * Green syndicalism * Simple living * Spiritual ecology * Sustainable living * Yin and yang * Environmental philosophy ==Notes== ==References== *Drengson, A. and Y.

After school at Marseille, he studied in Paris at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand.\\"Brunetiere, Ferdinand\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, New York, the Encyclopedia Press, 1917, p. 21 Desiring a teaching career, he entered for examination at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, but failed, and the outbreak of war in 1870 prevented him trying again. He turned to private tuition and literary criticism. After the publication of successful articles in the Revue Bleue, he became connected with the Revue des Deux Mondes, first as contributor, then as secretary and sub-editor, and finally, in 1893, as principal editor. ===Career=== In 1886 Bruneti√®re was appointed professor of French language and literature at the √âcole Normale, a singular honour for one who had not passed through the academic mill; and later he presided with distinction over various conferences at the Sorbonne and elsewhere. He was decorated with the Legion of Honour in 1887, and became a member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1893. The published works of Bruneti√®re consist largely of reprinted papers and lectures. They include six series of Etudes critiques (1880-1898) on French history and literature; Le Roman naturaliste (1883); Histoire et Litt√©rature, three series (1884-1886); Questions de critique (1888; second series, 1890). The first volume of L'Evolution de genres dans l'histoire de la litt√©rature, lectures in which a formal classification, founded on Darwinism, is applied to the phenomena of literature, appeared in 1890; and his later works include a series of studies (2 vols, 1894) on the evolution of French lyrical poetry during the 10th century, a history of French classic literature begun in 1904, a monograph on Honor√© de Balzac (1906), and various pamphlets of a polemical nature dealing with questions of education, science and religion. Among these may be mentioned Discours acad√©miques (1901), Discours de combat (1900, 1903), L'Action sociale du Christianisme (1904), Sur les chemins de la croyance (1905). ===Political activity=== Bruneti√®re was a leading member of the anti- Dreyfusards.Blake Smith, The Religion of Liberal Democracy, Tablet Magazine, November 15, 2019 https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts- letters/articles/the-religion-of-liberal-democracy ===Religious views=== Before 1895 Bruneti√®re was widely known as a rationalist, freethinking scholar. That year, however, he published an article, \\"Apr√®s une visite au Vatican,\\" in which he argued that science was incapable of providing a convincing social morality and that faith alone could achieve that result.Jennifer Michael Hecht. The End of the Soul: Scientific Modernity, Atheism and Anthropology in France, New York: Columbia University Press, 2003, pp. 172-176\\\\. Shortly afterwards, he converted to Roman Catholicism. As a Catholic, Bruneti√®re was orthodox and his political sympathies were conservative.

The AUC was responsible for retaliations against the FARC and ELN rebel groups as well as numerous attacks against civilians beginning in 1997 with the Mapirip√°n Massacre. The militia had its roots in the 1980s when militias were established by drug lords to combat rebel kidnappings and extortion by communist guerrillas. BBC, Quick Guide, The Colombian conflict . In April 1997 the AUC was formed through a merger, orchestrated by the ACCU, of local right-wing militias, each intending to protect different local economic, social and political interests by fighting left-wing insurgents in their areas. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, Terrorist Organization Profile:United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data_collections/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=126 The organization was led by Carlos Casta√±o until his murder in 2004 and the organization was believed to have links to some local military commanders in the Colombian Armed Forces. According to Human Rights Watch, the paramilitary groups and the armed forces of Colombia share a very close connection and due to which paramilitary groups are also perceived as an extension, more commonly called sixth-division, of the Colombia's armed forces which has five official divisions. The AUC had about 20,000 members and was heavily financed through the drug trade and through support from local landowners, cattle ranchers, mining or petroleum companies and politicians. The Colombian military has been accused of delegating to AUC paramilitaries the task of murdering peasants and labor union leaders, amongst others suspected of supporting the rebel movements and the AUC publicly and explicitly singled out 'political and trade union operatives of the extreme left' as legitimate targets. The AUC was designated as a terrorist organization by many countries and organizations, including the United States, Canada and the European Union. The bulk of the AUC's blocs demobilized by early 2006 and its former top leadership was extradited to the U.S. in 2008. However, local successors such as the Black Eagles continue to exist and death threats have been made using its name. On May 8, 2008, employees of a community radio station (Sarare FM Stereo) received a message stating: \\"For the wellbeing of you and your loved ones, do not meddle in subjects that do not concern the radio station. AUC, Arauca\\". A few days later the letters AUC were daubed on the front of their office. This threat was made due to their participation in a public meeting attended by members of a Congressional Human Rights Commission on the 27 September 2007. Here, members of the public denounced human rights abuses committed in Arauca Department by different parties to the armed conflict, including the AUC. ==Activities== The AUC's main enemies were the leftist insurgency groups Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (Ej√©rcito de Liberaci√≥n Nacional, ELN). The AUC was designated as a terrorist organization by many countries and organizations, including the United States, Canada and the European Union. The U.S. State Department added the AUC to the list in 2001, condemning it for massacres, torture, and other human rights abuses against civilians. According to the Colombian National Police, in the first ten months of 2000 the AUC conducted 804 assassinations, 203 kidnappings, and 75 massacres with 507 victims. The AUC claims the victims were mostly guerrillas or sympathizers. Combat tactics consist of conventional and guerrilla operations against main force insurgent units. AUC clashes with military and police units gradually increased, although the group has traditionally been friendly with government security forces. A February 2005 report by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights reported that, during 2004, \\"the AUC was responsible for 342 cases of violations of the cessation of hostilities. These include the presumed reincorporation of demobilized persons into its ranks, massacres, forced displacements, selective and systematic homicides, kidnappings, rape, disappearances, threats, intimidation and lootings. These actions took place in 11 departments and targeted the civilian population, in many cases indigenous communities.\\"Report on the situation of human rights in Colombia UNHCR 28 February 2005 (English and Spanish) Human Rights Watch reports allege that numerous elements within the Colombian military and police have collaborated with or continue to tolerate local AUC paramilitary groups.

These payments were often made through a group belonging to the Convivir network, a government-sponsored program of rural security cooperatives. DOCUMENTS IMPLICATE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT IN CHIQUITA TERROR SCANDAL , National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 217 The payments were arranged during a 1997 meeting between Carlos Casta√±o with officials from Banadex, a subsidiary of Chiquita. Michael Evans, 'Para-politics' Goes Bananas , The Nation, 4 April 2007 Chiquita subsequently made a plea bargain with the United States Department of Justice, and agreed to pay a $25 million fine. Chiquita Brands International Pleads Guilty to Making Payments to a Designated Terrorist Organization And Agrees to Pay $25 Million Fine , United States Department of Justice, 19 March 2007 Colombia's attorney general, Mario Iguar√°n, also opened a case on Chiquita. He stated that he will request the extradition of eight Chiquita officials connected to the case. He has also charged Chiquita of using one of their ships to smuggle weapons (some 3,400 AK-47 rifles and 4 million rounds of ammunition) for the AUC. These charges were first brought ahead in a 2003 report from the Organization of American States (OAS). Later, Attorney General Iguar√°n contradicted himself by claiming the extraditions could not be completed since the implicated persons had not been \\"identified and charged.\\" Specifically, Iguar√°n asserted \\"there are indeed some Chiquita Brands directors, but we are not able to ask for them in extradition, rather we have to have some information contained in the agreement reached with the U.S. court that includes a confidentiality agreement.\\" Nonetheless, specific information on the identities of the Chiquita directors, executives, and senior employees ‚Äì namely Cyrus Freid Heim jr., Roderick M.

Chiquita Board Members: Total Identification , Jose Alvear Restrepo Lawyers' Collective, July 23, 2008 ==2003‚Äì2004: Initial negotiation efforts== After a ceasefire was declared (which in practice has been publicly admitted by the AUC and the government to be partial, resulting in a reduction but not the cessation of killings), the government of President √Ålvaro Uribe began talks with the group with the aim to eventually dismantle the organization and reintegrate its members to society. The stated deadline for completing the demobilization process was originally December 2005, but was later extended into February 2006. Between 2003 and February 2, 2006, about 17,000 of the AUC's 20,000 fighters surrendered their weapons. This is more than double the figure originally estimated by the government before negotiations began. A draft law was presented to the public which offered to pardon the members of any illegal armed group (which would legally include both guerrillas and paramilitaries, (i.e. members of both left- and right-wing groups) that declared a ceasefire and entered talks with the government, in return for, mainly, their verified demobilization, concentration within a specific geographic area and the symbolic reparation of the offenses committed against the victims of their actions. After much discussion and controversy over it, a further revised draft was distributed to the media and political circles. This new project was not officially submitted for approval by Congress and further public discussion on the matter continued. The bill, among other details, called for the creation of a three to five member Truth Tribunal which would study each case brought before it (at the request of the president), after the groups/individuals sign an agreement to respect international humanitarian laws and accept the authority of the Tribunal, in exchange for a minimum sentence of five to ten years (part of it could possibly be served outside jail) for those guilty of the most serious crimes, the confession of the crimes which were committed in connection with the activities of the illegal armed group, and the completion of concrete acts of reparation towards the victims. If the Tribunal were to deny the benefits to anyone, there would be no possibility of reconsideration. However, the president would be able to veto individuals who did receive a favorable sentence. This new draft version of the law would have been in effect only until 31 December 2006. Human Rights Watch spokesman Jos√© Miguel Vivanco publicly stated, during one of the final audiences which were created to discuss aspects of the original bill (of which he remained highly critical), that the new proposition seemed to be considerably more in line with international standards, at first glance, but that more needed to be done in order to fully resolve the issue. Salvatore Mancuso, one of the AUC's main commanders, publicly expressed that he was against both any potential extradition of either himself or his \\"comrades in arms\\" to the USA and refused \\"spending any day in jail\\". Also, there have been internal conflicts within the illegal organization, as other AUC leaders have mutually accused each other of being tainted with narcotrafficking and their troops have even met in combat. These different, regionalistic and sometimes warring factions within the AUC, make successfully concluding any peace initiative a considerably difficult task. In mid-May 2004, the talks appeared to move forward as the government agreed to grant the AUC leaders and 400 of their bodyguards a 142 square mile (368 km¬≤) safe haven in Santa Fe de Ralito, C√≥rdoba, where, under OAS verification, further discussions will be held, for a (renewable) trial period of 6 months. As long the AUC leaders remain in this area, they will not be subject to arrest warrants. That condition and most of remaining legal framework invoked was previously implemented for the much larger San Vicente del Cagu√°n area that former president Andr√©s Pastrana granted the FARC guerrillas as safe haven during the 1998‚Äì2002 peace process, but there are differences: * the local, state and police authorities will not leave the zone, so Colombian laws will still be fully applicable within its limits * the paramilitary leaders will require special permission to leave and re-enter the zone, and government prosecutors will be allowed to operate inside it in order to investigate criminal offenses. ==Disappearance and death of Carlos Casta√±o== Paramilitary leader Carlos Mauricio Garc√≠a alias \\"Doble Cero\\" (\\"Double Zero\\") or \\"Rodrigo\\", who since the 1980s had been a close associate of Casta√±o within the AUC, was found dead on 30 May 2004. He had strongly objected to what he considered an improperly close relationship between the AUC and drug traffickers, and was also opposed to the group's talks with the government. \\"Double Zero\\" had fallen into disgrace in recent years, leading to the formation of his own independent \\"Bloque Metro\\" (\\"Metro Bloc\\"), which operated in the Antioquia area until it was exterminated by rival paramilitary commanders from the AUC mainstream. Separately, in events which remain clouded and confusing, former AUC supreme leader Carlos Casta√±o, who had become relatively isolated from the organization, apparently suffered an attempt on his life on 16 April 2004, presumably at the hands of either his own bodyguards, those of rival paramilitary troops, or perhaps even other entities altogether. Acting AUC commanders claim to believe that there was an accidental exchange of gunfire between his bodyguards and a separate group of paramilitary fighters, but that he may still be alive and possibly in hiding. Other independent sources within the group and among its dissident factions claim that he and his men were captured and tortured before being executed and then buried by order of other AUC top leaders (perhaps his own brother Vicente Casta√±o and/or Diego Fernando Murillo), who have become increasingly close to narcotraffickers and their trade. Investigators found a makeshift grave and an unidentified body (yet apparently not Casta√±o's) near the supposed area of the events. Those same sources allege that the bodies of Casta√±o and his other companions were dug up and taken to other locations before the investigators could arrive. It has been speculated in the Colombian and international press that this could be a potential blow to the peace process, as Casta√±o seemed to become relatively critical of the increasing association with narcotraffickers in recent years and more willing to compromise with the Colombian state, and thus the remaining AUC commanders (such as Mancuso and \\"Don Berna\\") would potentially maintain a much less open negotiating position in the ongoing talks with the Uribe government. The death of AUC co-founder Carlos Casta√±o remained unexplained for two years, and was subject of wild and rampant speculation. One of the more exotic rumours (dating to 1 June 2004), stated that unidentified diplomatic sources told the AFP agency that Casta√±o had been spirited away to Israel, via Panama, with U.S. assistance. No specific reasoning or details regarding this claim were produced. The governments of the United States, Colombia, and Israel denied these allegations. Details about Casta√±o's possible fate began to emerge in 2006. The Cali-based Nuevo Diario Occidente reported that an assassin hired by Vicente Casta√±o confessed to the police that he had killed Casta√±o in 2004. This assassin's confessions allowed Colombian authorities to locate Casta√±o's body in August 2006, and DNA tests confirmed its identity in September that year. ==Possible paramilitary activities in Venezuela== In early May 2004, Venezuelan authorities arrested at least 100 individuals that they accused of being Colombian paramilitaries and of scheming, together with part of the Venezuelan opposition, to begin a series of scheduled attacks against heavily fortified military targets within Caracas, aiming at the overthrow of President Hugo Ch√°vez. The AUC officially denied that they had anything to do with them. President Uribe congratulated the Venezuelan president for the capture and pledged to cooperate with the investigation, while President Ch√°vez himself declared that, as far as he was concerned, he did not believe that Uribe had anything to with the operation, for which he blamed \\"elements\\" within \\"the oligarchies of Miami and Bogot√°\\", also implicating individual high-ranking U.S. and Colombian military officers, who have denied such involvement. Vice-president Francisco Santos Calder√≥n added that he hoped that the Venezuelan government would pursue with equal zeal those FARC and ELN guerrillas who would also be present in Venezuela. The Venezuelan opposition dismissed the whole event as a \\"setup\\", claiming that Ch√°vez intended to interfere with the potential approval of a referendum which sought to remove him from power. ==Late 2004: Demobilizations== Salvatore Mancuso In November 2004, the Supreme Court approved the extradition to the United States of top paramilitary leaders Salvatore Mancuso and Carlos Casta√±o, together with that of the guerrilla commander Sim√≥n Trinidad, the only one of the men to be in state custody (Casta√±o's extradition was approved because the court considered that the matter of his death was not yet clear). The court ruled that the three US extradition requests, all for charges of drug trafficking and money laundering, respected current Colombian legal procedures and therefore they could now proceed, once the president gave his approval. BBC Court clears Colombia extradition Thursday, 25 November 2004 It has been speculated in the Colombian press that the government would possibly approve the extradition of Salvatore Mancuso, but would delay it for the duration of the peace talks that he and his organization are conducting with the state. Mancuso himself has declared that he will continue to participate in the process despite the Supreme Court's ruling. In early December and late November, there have been new events in the peace negotiations with the AUC. First, several hundred men of the Bloque Bananero (loosely translated, the Banana Producers' Bloc) turned in their weapons and demobilized in order to be reintegrated into civilian life. This group operated in the Uraba region of northern Antioquia, where the AUC had dislodged the FARC and gained total control in the mid- to late nineties. However, the AUC remain in the area with the presence of other divisions. A few weeks later, the Catatumbo Bloc also demobilized. This was a milestone in Colombian history, for, with its 1425 mercenaries, the Catatumbo Bloc was one of the most important AUC groups. With them Salvatore Mancuso, the AUC's military leader, turned himself in. A few days later, the government announced that it would not make Mancuso's extradition effective as long as he avoided criminal activities and fulfilled his commitments to the peace process. Both of these massive demobilizations of AUC groups are an apparent improvement over the first one in 2003 in Medell√≠n because on this occasion important leaders turned themselves in and the weapons presented were assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and rockets, rather than the homemade shotguns and old, malfunctioning revolvers that were turned in the first demobilization. The AUC was supposed to have demobilized completely by 2006 but successor organizations continued to operate such as the neo-paramilitary alliance BACRIM ('bandas criminales emergentes'). . ==2005: Legal framework and controversy== Many Colombian and international observers are skeptical about the demobilization's prospects and see multiple causes for criticism. A concern shared by a high number of critics, both inside and outside the country, is that the demobilization process, if it does not provide a legal framework that contemplates the proper doses of truth, reparation and justice, could allow those who have committed human rights violations to possibly enjoy an undue degree of impunity for their crimes. A different kind of concern is held by a few of the supporters of the demobilization process, some of which believe that, without a certain degree of acceptance from the paramilitaries themselves, any unilateral attempts at reducing impunity could stay in writing and not be practically effective. A smaller number of the critics have also expressed their fear that the current administration could integrate the AUC into its civilian defence militias or other military structures. Military and government spokesmen have stated multiple times that there is no intention to integrate the AUC into the state's legal security apparatus. While no reports of that occurring have been put forward yet, there have been signs of some individual paramilitaries expressing an interest in wanting to join (or form) private security companies in areas that formerly were under their influence and control, in order to prevent possible guerrilla inroads. The debate on the subject of potential impunity has had a high profile in both the international and Colombian media, with critical views being expressed in Chicago Tribune and New York Times editorials, in addition to many Colombian outlets. The main argument of several editorials has been that the international community should not help fund the demobilization process until the necessary legal framework to minimize impunity is in place. This position was also echoed by representatives of the international community in a February 2005 donors' conference in Cartagena. Colombia opens peace conference BBC 3 February 2005 (English) After many public and private discussions through mid-to-late 2004, in early 2005, a number of congressmen, including Senator Rafael Pardo and Gina Parody (traditionally holding pro-government positions) and Wilson Borja (a former leftwing labor leader who survived a paramilitary assassination attempt back in 2000) among others, independently presented a multiparty draft bill that, according to several observers such as Colombian and international NGOs (including Human Rights Watch), indicates a substantial improvement (compared to the government's previous initiatives) in meeting the necessary conditions of adequately dismantling paramilitarism and reducing impunity. Among these sectors, there is a semblance of a broad consensus in support of this bill. www.ciponline.org ‚Äì Plan Colombia and Beyond December 07, 2004 (English) Colombia: Demobilization Scheme Ensures Injustice hrw.org January 18, 2005 (English) Congressional discussion on the subject was set to begin on February 15, 2005, but suffered several delays. The Colombian government's own official draft had apparently gradually incorporated several of the provisions in the Pardo, Parody and Borja proposal, but a number of disagreements remained, which would be the source for further debate on the subject. Other congressmen, including supporters of the government, also begun to present their own draft projects. On February 23, the top AUC leaders published an online document on their webpage which stated that they will not submit to a legal framework that, in their own words, would force them to suffer through an undue humiliation that their leftwing guerrilla foes would not contemplate for themselves. They also declared that they are in favor of laws that will allow their fighters to return to civilian and productive lives in a fair, peaceful and equitable manner. In the absence of such conditions, they claimed that the consequence would be the end of the negotiations and their preferring to face the prospect of continuing \\"war and death\\". A government communique answered that the AUC should not put pressure on Congress, the media or the Executive on the matter of the legal framework, and that they would have five days to leave the Ralito zone if they chose to quit the talks. The AUC later reduced the tone of its earlier remarks.Caracol Radio February 23, 2005 (Spanish) On April 11, an AUC spokesman repeated their claims that the current proposal for amnesty was too harsh primarily because it still allowed extradition for drug charges. Colombia fighters reject amnesty BBC April 11, 2005 ==Mass extradition to the U.S.== In the early morning of May 13, 2008, thirteen high-profile paramilitary leaders were taken from their jail cells in a surprise action by the government. According to Interior Minister Carlos Holgu√≠n they have been refusing to comply to the country's Peace and Justice Law and were therefore extradited to the United States. Amongst them are Salvatore Mancuso, Don Berna, Jorge 40, Cuco Vanoy and Diego Ruiz Arroyave (cousin of assassinated paramilitary leader Miguel Arroyave). President Uribe said immediately afterwards the United States has agreed to compensate the victims of extradited paramilitary warlords with any international assets they might surrender. The US State Department said the US' courts can also help the victims by sharing information on atrocities with Colombian authorities. The National Movement of State Crimes, a coalition of several victim organizations that have suffered from state or paramilitary violence, has asked \\"to return the paramilitary chiefs to the Colombian authorities so they may be processed by the ordinary justice system and not under the framework of the Law of Justice and Peace, since this framework benefits the victimizers and not the victims, since they have not told all of the truth, have not made comprehensive reparations to the victims, and have not dismantled their criminal structures.\\" Extradition Cut Short ‚Äò‚ÄôCCAJAR‚Äô‚Äô May 27, 2008 The Office in Colombia of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that \\"[...] according to Colombian law, the reasons claimed by the President of the Republic to proceed with the previously- suspended extraditions are also grounds for their removal from the application of the ‚ÄòLaw of Justice and Peace‚Äô and for the loss of the benefits established therein\\". The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights stated that this \\"affects the Colombian State‚Äôs obligation to guarantee victims‚Äô rights to truth, justice, and reparations for the crimes committed by the paramilitary groups. The extradition impedes the investigation and prosecution of such grave crimes through the avenues established by the Justice and Peace Law in Colombia and through the Colombian justice system‚Äôs regular criminal procedures. It also closes the door to the possibility that victims can participate directly in the search for truth about crimes committed during the conflict, and limits access to reparations for damages that were caused. This action also interferes with efforts to determine links between agents of the State and these paramilitary leaders.\\" After his extradition to the United States, paramilitary leader Salvatore Mancuso has continued to testify via satellite as part of the Justice and Peace process. On November 18, 2008, Revista Semana reported on Mancuso's declarations about the 1997 El Aro massacre, in which he stated that the AUC had received logistical help from the national military and police. ==Parapolitics scandal== ==Films== * Little Voices (Peque√±as Voces) ‚Äì An animated movie about the vision of children in the war in Colombia. * IMPUNITY ‚Äì THE FILM ‚Äì Film about the AUC * La Sierra.

He is remembered for his controversial form of skepticism and his separation of ethics from religion as an independent philosophical discipline. ==Biography== Pierre Charron's obituary Pierre Charron was born in Paris, one of the twenty-five children of a bookseller. After studying law at Orl√©ans and Bourges he practiced as an advocate, for a few years.Schaff-Herzog article He then entered the church and soon became a popular priest, rising to become a canon. He moved to the southwest of France, invited by Arnaud de Pontac, Bishop of Bazas.https://archive.org/stream/annalesdumidi3132univuoft#page/102/mode/2up He was appointed priest in ordinary to Marguerite de Valois, wife of Henry IV of Navarre. In about 1588, Charron decided to become a monk, but being rejected by both the Carthusians and the Celestines, he returned to his old profession. He delivered a course of sermons at Angers, and in the next year moved to Bordeaux, where he formed a famous friendship with Michel de Montaigne. On Montaigne's death, in 1592, Charron was requested in the will to bear the Montaigne arms. From 1594, he used his own name; he spent from 1594 to 1600 under the protection of Antoine H√©rbrard de Saint-Sulpice, Bishop of Cahors, who appointed him grand vicar and theological canon. His first book led to his being chosen deputy to the general assembly of the clergy, for which he became chief secretary. Charron retired to Condom in 1600; he died suddenly of a stroke; his works were then receiving attention.Gale Dictionary of Philosophy ==Works== Charron first published his works anonymously. Later he wrote under the name of \\"Benoit Vaillant, Advocate of the Holy Faith.\\" While Charron's reading of Montaigne is now considered dogmatic and indeed something of a distortion, it was important in its time and during the 17th century as a whole.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/montaigne/ ===Les Trois V√©rit√©s=== In 1594, he published a long work, Les Trois V√©rit√©s, in which Charron sought to prove that there is a God and a true religion, that the true religion is Christianity, and that the true church is Roman Catholicism. It was a response to the Protestant work Le Trait√© de l'Eglise, by Philippe de Mornay. In the second edition (1595), there is an elaborate reply to criticisms of the third V√©rit√© by a Protestant writer. Les Trois V√©rit√©s ran through several editions. ===Discours chretiens=== Then followed, in 1600, Discours chretiens, a book of sermons with a similar tone, half of which is about the Eucharist . ===De la sagesse=== De la sagesse : trois livres / par Pierre Charron. ‚Äì 3me ed. rev. et augm.‚Äì Paris : David Deuceur Libraire Iur√©, 1607. In 1601, Charron published in Bordeaux his third work, De la sagesse, a system of moral philosophy that develops ideas of Montaigne. Charron also connected Montaigne's scepticism with the anti-rational strand in Christianity.Richard Popkin, The History of Scepticism from Erasmus to Spinoza (1979), p. 56-7. It received the support of Henry IV and of magistrate Pierre Jeannin. A second revised edition appeared in 1603, supported by Claude Dormy, the second Bishop of Boulogne. De la sagesse also was attacked, in particular by the Jesuit Fran√ßois Garasse (1585‚Äì1631), who described Charron as an atheist. Pierre Charron; \\"Of Wisdom\\" London: Printed for Nathaniel Ranew and Jonathan Robinson, 1670 A summary and defence of the book, written shortly before his death, appeared in 1606. In 1604, Charron's friend Michel de la Roche prefixed a \\"Life\\" to an edition of De la sagesse, which depicts Charron as an amiable man of good character. His complete works, with this contribution by de la Roche, were published in 1635. An abridgment of the Sagesse is given in Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann's Philosophie, vol. ix. An edition with notes by A. Duval appeared in 1820. It was translated into English as Of Wisdome (1612) by Samson Lennard;Dictionary of National Biography, Lennard, Samson (d 1633), genealogist and translator, by Thompson Cooper. Published 1892. and again by George Stanhope (1697). ==Views== ;Influences Apart from the major influence of Montaigne, Charron took from Raymond of Sabunde (Sibiuda).Emmanuel Faye, Philosophie et perfection de l'homme: de la Renaissance √† Descartes Another influence was neostoicism, as handled by Justus Lipsius.http://www.iep.utm.edu/neostoic/ ;Psychology According to Charron, the soul, located in the ventricles of the brain, is affected by the temperament of the individual; the dry temperament produces acute intelligence; the moist, memory; the hot, imagination. Dividing the intelligent soul into these three faculties, he writes the branches of science corresponding with each. On the nature of the soul, he quotes opinions. The belief in its immortality, he says, is the most universal of beliefs, but the most feebly supported by reason. As to a human's power of attaining truth, he declares that none of our faculties enable us to distinguish truth from error. In comparing humans with animals, Charron insists that there are no breaks in nature. Though inferior in some respects, in others, animals are superior. Namely, humanity's essential qualities are vanity, weakness, inconstancy, and presumption. ;Theology Charron writes that all religions teach that God is to be appeased by prayers, presents, vows, but especially, and, most irrationally, by human suffering . Each religion is said by its devotees to have commenced by divine inspiration. A human is a Christian, Jew, or Muslim, before he or she knows that they are persons. Furthermore, he writes that one religion is built upon another. While Charron declares religion to be \\"strange to common sense,\\" the practical result at which he arrives is that one is not to sit in judgment on his or her faith, but to be \\"simple and obedient,\\" and to submit to public authority. He writes that this is one rule of wisdom with regard to religion. Another equally important is to avoid superstition, which he defines as the belief that God is like a hard judge who, eager to find fault, narrowly examines our slightest act, that he is vengeful and hard to appease, and that, therefore, he must be flattered and won over by pain and sacrifice. Charron states that true piety, which is the first of duties, is the knowledge of God and of one's self; the latter knowledge being necessary to the former. The belief that what God sends is all good, and that all the bad is from ourselves is the abasing of humanity and the exalting of God. It leads to spiritual worship, for external ceremony is merely for our advantage, not for his glory. ;Politics Charron is a founder of modern secularism. He declares the sovereign to be the source of law, and asserts that popular freedom is dangerous. ==Bibliography== ===Works=== * De la Sagesse Livres Trois; par M.

His great work is an eleven-volume history of philosophy (Geschichte der Philosophie), which he began at Jena and finished at the University of Marburg, where he was professor of philosophy from 1804 till his death. He was one of the numerous German philosophers who accepted the Kantian theory as a revelation. In 1812 he published a shorter history of philosophy (Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie f√ºr den akademischen Unterricht), which was translated into English in 1852 under the title A manual of the history of philosophy. He died at Marburg. ==See also== * Allegorical interpretations of Plato ==References== ;Attribution * Category:1761 births Category:1819 deaths Category:German philosophers Category:German historians of philosophy Category:People from Erfurt Category:University of Jena faculty Category:University of Marburg faculty Category:German male non-fiction writers ","title":"Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann"},{"id":"306078","text":"Fernand Oury (18 January 1920 - 19 February 1997) was a pedagogue and creator of institutional pedagogy. He recommended and practiced a \\"school of the people\\" methodology, in which children were no longer passive receivers, but actively participated in the management of their learning, methods, forms of relations and the everyday life of the class: all of which he called institutions (in the sociological sense). Some of the notable elements of this methodology were pupils' council, school funds and individualized curricula. ==Background== As a teacher in 1950, Oury reacted to what he saw as the deplorable state of the French educational system: \\"overloaded classes\\", \\"colossal school sizes\\", and \\"absurd regulations\\". Along with fellow educator C√©lestin Freinet, he worked with school leadership to reform organizational practice within urban schools. By 1958, following on the initiatives of institutional psychotherapy led by his brother Jean Oury, Fran√ßois Tosquelles, and Lucien Bonnafe, Fernand Oury founded the discipline of institutional pedagogy, the object of which would be the progressive analysis of liberating means of education. Perhaps the most well-known name in the field of institutional pedagogy, Oury maintained an open relationship with respect to defining the scope and practice of teaching. By 1966, Oury and psychoanalyst A√Øda Vasquez, along with the Groupe Techniques √âducatives (GET) begin to work out the practical and theoretical instruments institutional pedagogy would develop as a practice. This was accomplished primarily through the elaboration of monographs. The practice of publishing articles of analysis, case-studies and critiques also began to be encouraged. In 1978, Oury and others established CEPI, the Collective of Teams of Institutional Pedagogy (French Le Collectif des √âquipes de P√©dagogie Institutionnelle), and the MPI, Association for the Support of Institutional Pedogagy (Association Maintenant la P√©dagogie Institutionnelle), both still in existence. Their primary tasks are the publication and dissemination of institutional pedagogic literature, reports, analyses and case-studies, the promotion and activism in favour of progressive pedagogic practices, and the education of teachers, social workers and others in Institutional Pedagogic practices. ===Pillars of institutional pedagogy=== Oury's framework of analysis initially consisted of three pillars of consideration (1964): #Materialist: the equipment, the techniques of organisation and initiating activities, consideration of concrete situations, and concrete relations. #Sociological: consideration of the class, groups and grouping of groups and classes and effects; intercommunications and phenomena within groups that overdetermine behaviour and evolutions of the students. #Psychoanalytic: to quote Oury \\"acknowledged or disclaimed, the unconscious is in the class and it speak... It is better to understand that to be subjected it.\\" ==Publications== *Chronique de l'√©cole-caserne, with Jacques Pain, Maspero, 1972. *De la classe coop√©rative... √† la P√©dagogie Institutionnelle, with A√Øda Vasquez, first edition Maspero, 1971. *Vers une P√©dagogie Institutionnelle ?, with A√Øda Vasquez, √âd.

Biochemists study DNA, proteins and cell parts. The word \\"biochemist\\" is a portmanteau of \\"biological chemist.\\" Biochemists also research how certain chemical reactions happen in cells and tissues and observe and record the effects of products in food additives and medicines. Biochemist researchers focus on planning and conducting research experiments, mainly for developing new products, updating existing products and analyzing said products. It is also the responsibility of a biochemist to present their research findings and create grant proposals to obtain funds for future research. Biochemists study aspects of the immune system, the expressions of genes, isolating, analyzing, and synthesizing different products, mutations that lead to cancers, and manage laboratory teams and monitor laboratory work. Biochemists also have to have the capabilities of designing and building laboratory equipment and devise new methods of producing correct results for products. The most common industry role is the development of biochemical products and processes. Identifying substances' chemical and physical properties in biological systems is of great importance, and can be carried out by doing various types of analysis. Biochemists must also prepare technical reports after collecting, analyzing and summarizing the information and trends found. In biochemistry, researchers often break down complicated biological systems into their component parts. They study the effects of foods, drugs, allergens and other substances on living tissues; they research molecular biology, the study of life at the molecular level and the study of genes and gene expression; and they study chemical reactions in metabolism, growth, reproduction, and heredity, and apply techniques drawn from biotechnology and genetic engineering to help them in their research. About 75% work in either basic or applied research; those in applied research take basic research and employ it for the benefit of medicine, agriculture, veterinary science, environmental science, and manufacturing. Each of these fields allows specialization; for example, clinical biochemists can work in hospital laboratories to understand and treat diseases, and industrial biochemists can be involved in analytical research work, such as checking the purity of food and beverages. Biochemists in the field of agriculture research the interactions between herbicides with plants. They examine the relationships of compounds, determining their ability to inhibit growth, and evaluate the toxicological effects surrounding life. Biochemists also prepare pharmaceutical compounds for commercial distribution. Modern biochemistry is considered a sub-discipline of the biological sciences, due to its increased reliance on, and training, in accord with modern molecular biology. Historically, even before the term biochemist was formally recognized, initial studies were performed by those trained in basic chemistry, but also by those trained as physicians. ==Training== Some of the job skills and abilities that one needs to attain to be successful in this field of work include science, mathematics, reading comprehension, writing, and critical thinking. These skills are critical because of the nature of the experimental techniques that are used as well as the need to convey orally and written the trends found in research. A degree in biochemistry or a related science such as chemistry is the minimum requirement for any work in this field. This is sufficient for a position as a technical assistant in industry or in academic settings. A Ph.D. (or equivalent) is generally required to pursue or direct independent research. To advance further in commercial environments, one may need to acquire skills in management. Biochemists must pass a qualifying exam or a preliminary exam to continue their studies when receiving a Ph.D. in biochemistry. Biochemistry requires an understanding of organic and inorganic chemistry. All types of chemistry are required, with emphasis on biochemistry, organic chemistry and physical chemistry. Basic classes in biology, including microbiology, molecular biology, molecular genetics, cell biology, and genomics, are focused on. Some instruction in experimental techniques and quantification is also part of most curricula. In the private industries for businesses, it is imperative to possess strong business management skills as well as communication skills. Biochemists must also be familiar with regulatory rules and management techniques. Biochemistry Blog publishes high quality research articles, papers, posts and jobs related to biochemistry. Biochemistry 2019, biochemistry papers latest. Due to the reliance on most principles of the basic science of Biochemistry, early contemporary physicians were informally qualified to perform research on their own in mainly this (today also related biomedical sciences) field. ==Employment== Biochemists are typically employed in the life sciences, where they work in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industry in a research role. They are also employed in academic institutes, where in addition to pursuing their research they may also be involved with teaching undergraduates, training graduate students, and collaborating with post-doctoral fellows. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that jobs in the biochemist, combined with the statistics of biophysicists, field would increase by 31% between 2004 and 2014 because of the demand in medical research and development of new drugs and products, and the preservation of the environment. Because of a biochemists' background in both biology and chemistry, they may also be employed in the medical, industrial, governmental, and environmental fields. Slightly more than half of the biological scientists are employed by the Federal State and local governments. The field of medicine includes nutrition, genetics, biophysics, and pharmacology; industry includes beverage and food technology, toxicology, and vaccine production; while the governmental and environmental fields includes forensic science, wildlife management, marine biology, and viticulture. The average income of a biochemist was $82,150 in 2017. The range of the salaries begin around 44,640 to 153,810, reported in 2017. The Federal Government in 2005 reported the average salaries in different fields associated with biochemistry and being a biochemist. General biological scientists in nonsupervisory, supervisory, and managerial positions earned an average salary of $69,908; microbiologists, $80,798; ecologists, $72,021; physiologists, $93,208; geneticists, $85,170; zoologists, $101,601; and botanists, $62,207.\\"Biochemistry\\" American Chemical Society - The World's Largest Scientific Society.

It contains three auditoriums, including a large-screen theatre, planetarium, and exhibition halls with a variety of hands-on permanent exhibits focused on natural sciences, industry, and technology. Transient exhibits span a wider range of disciplines. ==History== Beginning in 1903, odd artifacts were displayed in hallways and alcoves in Portland City Hall arranged by Colonel L. L. Hawkins. When the collection was evicted in 1936, about 12,000 artifacts were stored throughout the city. OMSI at its 1958‚Äì1992 location, with planetarium building in front On November 5, 1944, the Oregon Museum Foundation was founded with the mission of establishing an Oregon Museum of History, Science, and Industry. It displayed its first collection of natural history objects at the Portland Hotel. Subsequent small exhibits occurred around town to generate interest and donations. In 1949, a house at 908 NE Hassalo was donated to establish the museum. Within a year, the Pacific Northwest's first public planetarium opened in a dome on the front lawn. By 1955, OMSI's annual attendance had grown to 25,000. The need for expansion led to volunteers building a new site at Washington Park, completing the original goal of a hands-on museum. (That building is now occupied by the Portland Children's Museum.) This opened to the public on August 3, 1958,\\"Opening of Science and Industry Museum Draws 4,000\\". The Sunday Oregonian, August 4, 1958, p. 10. following a formal dedication by the governor on June 7.\\"Years‚Äô Dream Comes True: Holmes Dedicates Science Museum\\". The Sunday Oregonian, June 8, 1958, p. 16. A planetarium was again included. The new building at the southwest corner of what was then Hoyt Park (now part of Washington Park) was located adjacent to the then-new site of the Portland Zoo (now the Oregon Zoo), which began a one- year phased move in the same month as the new OMSI was dedicated.\\"Many See Zoo, Train\\". The Oregonian, June 9, 1958, p. 15. The two attractions remained neighbors, sharing a parking lot, until 1992.

The Oregonian, June 13, 1958, p. 35. facility housed in a temporary dome, but in 1967 it was replaced by a larger, 142-seat facility in a distinctive dodecahedron (12-sided) building equipped with a new projector.\\"New OMSI Planetarium Offers Story Of Stars\\". The Oregonian, December 15, 1967, p. 41. ===1992 move=== OMSI viewed from the Willamette River By the mid-1980s, 600,000 people per year were visiting the building, which was designed for only 100,000. Expansion at the Washington Park site was deemed infeasible, and in 1986 it was announced that the museum would move to a new location on the east bank of the Willamette River, where a much larger building would be constructed. Property that included the historic Station L power plant was donated by Portland General Electric, and building construction was paid for by a fundraising campaign. In 1992, OMSI opened at the new site, which continues to be the current location. The construction integrated the existing PGE turbine building and included the creation of a 330-seat OMNIMAX theater. The facility also includes a 200-seat planetarium with Digistar 3 technology. Turbine being assembled ===21st century=== In 2004 the Turbine Hall was closed from September through November for renovations in which the Discovery Space and Technology Lab changed places and a new Inventors Ballroom was added. Also added were a small stage area for public exhibit demonstrations and a bridge connecting a new metal staircase with the mezzanine exhibits. The museum started planning for an expansion of the facility in 2006. In 2008, OMSI began finalizing the plans for the expansion, which was estimated to cost about $500 million and would double the size of the museum. They began working to secure the funds for the expansion the next year, but decided to hold off on the plans in 2010 after the poor economy had made it difficult to try and raise funds for the project. The OMNIMAX dome theater closed in September 2013 for conversion into a conventional flat-screen movie theater that is not IMAX but still has an extra-large screen, about four stories tall. Renamed the Empirical Theater, it reopened in December 2013. As part of the COVID-19 pandemic, the museum received between $2 million and $5 million in federally backed small business loans from Heritage Bank as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. ==Exhibits and attractions== OMSI has five different specialized exhibit halls, a planetarium, and a submarine exhibit. ===USS Blueback=== The submarine at rest on the Willamette River in front of OMSI. The Marquam and Hawthorne bridges are in the background. The was purchased by OMSI in February 1994. This submarine appeared in the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October before being towed to its present location, a pier adjacent to the museum.USS Blueback Submarine It was opened to the public on May 15, 1994, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in September 2008. The propeller is a National Submarine Memorial located outside of the main museum area, beside the Eastbank Esplanade. The submarine is available for daily guided tours and sleep overs. ===Featured Exhibit Hall=== The Featured Exhibit Hall is used for temporary exhibits created by OMSI or brought in from museums around the world. Past exhibits have included \\"Grossology\\" (Winter‚ÄìSpring 2001), \\"Giants of the Gobi\\" (1997), \\"A T-rex named Sue\\" (September 2001 ‚Äì January 2002), and \\"CSI, The Experience\\" (May‚ÄìSeptember, 2009). Gunther von Hagens' Body Worlds 3, opened on June 7, 2007, and closed on October 7, 2007. By late September 2007, 300,000 people had seen Body Worlds 3, setting the record as OMSI's most visited traveling exhibit. In September 2015, OMSI hosted The National Guitar Museum's exhibition, \\"GUITAR: The Instrument That Rocked The World.\\" ===Turbine Hall=== Turbine Hall The Turbine Hall is named for the large retired steam turbine from its days as a PGE power plant. It features exhibits about engineering, physics, chemistry, and space travel. The Turbine Hall has two floors. On the main floor are the large exhibits and enrichment areas. On the mezzanine there are smaller exhibits. The Innovation Station includes hands-on exhibits related to technology and invention. Laboratories for physics, chemistry, technology, and laser holography are connected to the Turbine Hall. The Chemistry Lab is the first hands-on wet chemistry laboratory in the nation. There are six stations that allow visitors to learn about chemical interactions by participating in experiments that share a common theme. Themes rotate weekly and include the chemistry of toys, the nature of matter, biochemistry, environmental chemistry, industrial chemistry, chemical reactions, everyday chemistry, and crime scene chemistry. Chemical reaction demonstrations are given daily and are often related to the weekly theme. Physics Lab exhibits include a Van de Graaff generator (a static electricity generator), motion detectors, electrical circuits, Morse code, magnets, computers that simulate basic properties of physics, and musical instruments. The Laser/Holography Lab, which is open for approximately one hour every day, presents 30-minute demonstrations constructing a hologram. The Vernier Technology Lab investigates the impact of technology on society. Rotating interactive exhibits allow visitors to investigate technologies such as robots and computers, security technology, biomedical technology, communications technology, and household technology. Visitors can also use a wide variety of educational software on internet-connected computers. ===Life Sciences Hall=== The Life Sciences Hall, on the second floor of the museum, offers exhibits about biology. These include a collection of preserved fetuses at nearly every stage of development, from a few weeks after conception to full-term, and the exhibit Amazing Feats of Aging, which is concerned with the biology of aging. One of the features of this exhibit is the Age Machine, a computer program that allows visitors to capture, and then \\"age\\" a picture of themselves. The Life Sciences Hall also contains the Life Science Laboratory and the Earth Science Hall. The Life Sciences Laboratory houses a wide variety of live animals, such as rats, walking sticks, chameleons, Madagascar Hissing Cockroaches, other mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and insects. Volunteers and staff members demonstrate and lead a variety of a group activities such as owl pellet dissections and exploration of the differences between male and female skulls and pelvises. ===Earth Science Hall=== The Earth Science Hall, located on the second floor, features geology-oriented exhibits and two specialized laboratories. The Watershed Laboratory gives visitors an experience in constructing an erosion cycle out of a river physical model. Visitors can learn about the life cycle of salmon and investigate microscopic organisms from local waterways through a videomicroscope. Visitors to the Paleontology Laboratory watch staff members and volunteers excavating fossils, such as dinosaur bones. ===Science Playground=== The Science Playground on the second level The Science Playground, the early childhood education area on the second floor of the museum, is designed for families with newborn to six-year-old children. The area is fully enclosed and designed to keep children visible and secure, while giving them freedom to explore at will. Its purpose is to give children the opportunity to develop interactive scientific learning through play. It contains a variety of experimental stations intended to encourage natural curiosity including a stimulating infant area, a giant sandbox, a water area, a reading area, and physical science exhibits. The area is staffed by trained specialists in early childhood education. There is also a Parent Resource Corner with reference materials on topics ranging from the developing brain to behavior intervention techniques. The Animal Secrets exhibit encourages children and parents to explore the hidden habitats and lives of forest animals. Visitors can crawl through the roots of a discovery tree, look for animals in a cave and a chipmunk den, play in a woodland stream, and be a naturalist for a day. Animal Secrets features English and Spanish text panels. The Discovery Laboratory offers rotating experiments and activities such as exploring Flubber or ice cube painting. Themed Discovery Drawers encourage parents to teach their own children about the contents. OMSI is a member of Nanoscale Informal Science Education Network, and participates in NanoDays. ===Planetarium=== Computer-aided astronomy and laser light shows are performed daily in the Harry C. Kendall Planetarium (previously the M. J. Murdock Sky Theater). ===Theory Eatery=== View of the right Theory Eatery, or simply Theory, is an American cuisine restaurant opened on January 30, 2013, as an addition to OMSI. Located alongside the Willamette River in the Central Eastside Industrial District, the restaurant has 9,100 square-feet of dining space. Mark Patel, former developer director of OMSI, was behind the creation of the restaurant, which is operated by Bon App√©tit Management Company. The restaurant is part of the museum, and also offers exhibits, science demonstrations and private and public events. The head chef is Ryan Morgan. Theory is located off of the Willamette River, with views of the Tilikum Crossing, Marquam Bridge, and the downtown Portland skyline. In November 2013, the restaurant was redesigned, and included a new 10-by-50-foot mural of photographed ingredients arranged with formulas on the background, designed by OMSI graphic artist Melissa Hicks. ==Auditoriums== Exterior of the former OMNIMAX theater, which closed in 2013 for conversion to a flat-screen theater OMSI contains both an ultra-large-screen theater (which replaced an OMNIMAX theater in 2013) and a large auditorium with a stage where annual events such as science fairs occur. Science fairs that take place in the main auditorium include OHSU's Brain Awareness, Safety Safari, and the Reptile and Amphibian Show. The auditorium is also used for private events. ==Educational outreach== OMSI operates the largest science museum outreach program in the country. The museum offers presentations in schools, summer science camp programs for individuals, and outdoor school programs for school groups on the Oregon Coast at Camp Gray and in the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument at Hancock Field Station. OMSI is a frequent site for field trips, primarily for grades K-12, from all over the region. ==Funding and volunteer support== OMSI is a non-profit organization and is funded by admissions, member contributions, public, and private donations, community agencies, federal grants, and fundraising events. The largest OMSI fundraising event each year is the OMSI Gala: a black tie party in May where visitors gather to show support for science education.OMSI Gala Although it is staffed with full and part-time employees, much of the museum is dependent on volunteers who perform many of the same duties as staff members such as greeting visitors, customer service, and performing exhibit demonstrations. The volunteers include high school and college students as well as other community members. Volunteers serve in a wide range of areas within the museum both on-stage and off. After 50 hours of service, all volunteers receive a free, one-year museum membership. The Teen Science Alliance, OMSI's youth volunteer program, takes place both during the summer and during the school year. As a part of the program, participants attend weekly classes focusing on developing communication and customer service skills and practice these skills by performing demonstrations on the museum floor. Participants also develop an original science demonstration for presentation to the public at the end of each session. ==See also== * California Museum of Science and Industry, Los Angeles * Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago) * Museum of Science & Industry (Tampa), Florida * Portland Winter Light Festival ==References== ==External links== *Official site Category:1944 establishments in Oregon Category:Association of Science- Technology Centers member institutions Category:Hosford-Abernethy, Portland, Oregon Category:Museums in Portland, Oregon Category:Planetaria in the United States Category:Science museums in Oregon Category:Willamette River Category:Culture of Portland, Oregon ","title":"Oregon Museum of Science and Industry"},{"id":"306085","text":"Cars racing in Speed Dreams The racing video game genre is the genre of video games, either in the first-person or third-person perspective, in which the player partakes in a racing competition with any type of land, water, air or space vehicles. They may be based on anything from real-world racing leagues to entirely fantastical settings. In general, they can be distributed along a spectrum anywhere between hardcore simulations, and simpler arcade racing games. Racing games may also fall under the category of sports games. ==History== ===1970s=== In 1973, Atari released Space Race, an arcade video game where players control spaceships that race against opposing ships, while avoiding comets and meteors. It is a competitive two-player game controlled using a two-way joystick, and features black and white graphics. The following year, Atari released the first car driving video game in the arcades, Gran Trak 10, which presents an overhead single-screen view of the track in low resolution white-on-black graphics. Later that same year, Taito released Speed Race designed by Tomohiro Nishikado (of Space Invaders fame), in which the player drives down a straight track dodging other cars.Chris Kohler (2005), Power-up: how Japanese video games gave the world an extra life, p. 16, BradyGames, The game was re-branded as Wheels by Midway Games for release in the United States and was influential on later racing games.Bill Loguidice & Matt Barton (2009), Vintage games: an insider look at the history of Grand Theft Auto, Super Mario, and the most influential games of all time, p. 197, Focal Press, Fonz (1976) In 1976, Sega released Moto-Cross, re-branded as Fonz in the US, as a tie-in for the popular sitcom Happy Days. The game featured a three-dimensional perspective view, as well as haptic feedback, which caused the motorcycle handlebars to vibrate during a collision with another vehicle.Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), The video game explosion: a history from PONG to Playstation and beyond, p. 39, ABC-CLIO, In October 1976, Atari's Night Driver presented a first-person view. Considered the first \\"scandalous\\" arcade game, Exidy's Death Race (1976) was widely criticized in the media for its violent content, which only served to substantially increase its popularity. In 1977, Atari released Super Bug, a racing game historically significant as \\"the first game to feature a scrolling playfield\\" in multiple directions. Sega released Twin Course T.T., a two-player motorbike racing game. Another notable video game from the 1970s was The Driver, a racing- action game released by Kasco (Kansai Seiki Seisakusho Co.) that used 16 mm film to project full motion video on screen, though its gameplay had limited interaction, requiring the player to match their steering wheel, gas pedal and brakes with movements shown on screen, much like the sequences in later laserdisc video games. 1979 also saw the release of Vectorbeam's Speed Freak, a 3D vector racing game, which Killer List of Videogames calls \\"very impressive and ahead of their time\\". ===1980s=== In 1980, Namco's overhead- view driving game Rally-X was the first game to feature background music, and allowed scrolling in multiple directions, both vertical and horizontal, and it was possible to pull the screen quickly in either direction. It also featured a radar, to show the rally car's location on the map. Alpine Ski, released by Taito in 1981, was a winter sports game, a vertical-scrolling racing game that involved maneuvering a skier through a downhill ski course, a slalom racing course, and a ski jumping competition. Turbo, released by Sega in 1981, was the first racing game to use sprite scaling with full-color graphics. One of the most influential racing games was released in 1982: Pole Position, developed by Namco and published by Atari in North America. It was the first game to be based on a real racing circuit, and the first to feature a qualifying lap, where the player needs to complete a time trial before they can compete in Grand Prix races. While not the first third-person racing game (it was predated by Sega's Turbo), Pole Position established the conventions of the genre and its success inspired numerous imitators. According to Electronic Games, for the first time in the amusement parlors, a first-person racing game gives a higher reward for passing cars and finishing among the leaders rather than just for keeping all four wheels on the road\\". According to IGN, it was \\"the first racing game based on a real-world racing circuit (Fuji Speedway in Japan)\\" and \\"introduced checkpoints,\\" and that its success, as \\"the highest-grossing arcade game in North America in 1983, cemented the genre in place for decades to come and inspired a horde of other racing games\\". In 1983, Kaneko produced Roller Aces, a roller skating racer. In 1984, several racing laserdisc video games were released, including Sega's GP World and Taito's Laser Grand Prix which featured live-action footage, Universal's Top Gear featuring 3D animated race car driving, and Taito's Cosmos Circuit, featuring animated futuristic racing. Taito also released Kick Start, Buggy Challenge, a dirt track racing game featuring a buggy. Irem's The Battle-Road, a vehicle combat racing game that featured branching paths and up to 32 possible routes. Racing games in general tend to drift toward the arcade side of reality, mainly due to hardware limitations, especially in the 1980s and 1990s. It is, however, untrue to say that there were no games considered simulations in their time. In 1984, Geoff Crammond, who later developed the Grandprix series (Known collectively as GPX to its fanbase), produced what is considered the first attempt at a racing simulator on a home system, REVS, released for the BBC Microcomputer. The game offered an unofficial (and hence with no official team or driver names associated with the series) recreation of British Formula 3. The hardware capabilities limited the depth of the simulation and restricted it (initially) to one track, but it offered a semi- realistic driving experience with more detail than most other racing games at the time. In 1985, Sega released Hang-On, a Grand Prix style motorbike racer. It used force feedback technology and was also one of the first arcade games to use 16-bit graphics and Sega's \\"Super Scaler\\" technology that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates. In 1986, Durell released Turbo Esprit, which had an official Lotus license, and featured working car indicator lights. Also in 1986, Sega produced Out Run, one of the most graphically impressive games of its time. It used two Motorola 68000 CPUs for its 2D sprite-based driving engine, and it became an instant classic that spawned many sequels. It was notable for giving the player the non-linear choice of which route to take through the game and the choice of soundtrack to listen to while driving, represented as radio stations. The game also featured up to five multiple endings depending on the route taken, and each one was an ending sequence rather than a simple \\"Congratulations\\" as was common in game endings at the time. In 1987, Square released Rad Racer, one of the first stereoscopic 3D games. In the same year, Atari produced RoadBlasters, a driving game that also involved a bit of shooting. CBS Sony released Paris- Dakar Rally Special, an imaginative racing game with platformer and action- adventure elements, featuring Dakar Rally cars that could fire bullets, the driver able to exit the car and go exploring to lower a bridge or bypass other obstacles, underwater driving sections, and at times having avoid a fleet of tanks and fighter jets. That same year, Namco released Winning Run. In 1989, Atari released Hard Drivin', another arcade driving game that used 3D polygonal graphics. It also featured force feedback, where the wheel fights the player during aggressive turns, and a crash replay camera view. That same year, the now defunct Papyrus Design Group produced their first attempt at a racing simulator, the critically acclaimed Indianapolis 500: The Simulation, designed by David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari. The game is generally regarded as the first true auto racing simulation on a personal computer. Accurately replicating the 1989 Indianapolis 500 grid, it offered advanced 3D graphics for its time, setup options, car failures and handling. Unlike most other racing games at the time, Indianapolis 500 attempted to simulate realistic physics and telemetry, such as its portrayal of the relationship between the four contact patches and the pavement, as well as the loss of grip when making a high-speed turn, forcing the player to adopt a proper racing line and believable throttle-to-brake interaction. It also featured a garage facility to allow players to enact modifications to their vehicle, including adjustments to the tires, shocks and wings. The damage modelling, while not accurate by today's standards, was capable of producing some spectacular and entertaining pile-ups. ===1990s=== Crammond's Formula One Grand Prix in 1992 became the new champion of sim racing, until the release of Papyrus' IndyCar Racing the following year. Formula One Grand Prix boasted detail that was unparalleled for a computer game at the time as well as a full recreation of the drivers, cars and circuits of the 1991 Formula One World Championship. However, the U.S. version (known as World Circuit) was not granted an official license by the FIA, so teams and drivers were renamed (though all could be changed back to their real names using the Driver/Team selection menu): Ayrton Senna became \\"Carlos Sanchez\\", for example. On the other end of the spectrum, Sega produced Virtua Racing in 1992. While not the first arcade racing game with 3D graphics (it was predated by Winning Run, Hard Drivin' and Stunts), it was able to combine the best features of games at the time, along with multiplayer machine linking and clean 3D graphics to produce a game that was above and beyond the arcade market standard of its time, laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games. In the same year, Nintendo released Super Mario Kart, but it was known that it was pseudo-3D racing. Here it has items to affect players from racing and the referee, Lakitu will help you out to know the rules and rescue racers from falling down. In 1993, Namco released Ridge Racer, and thus began the polygonal war of driving games. Sega later released Daytona USA, one of the first video games to feature filtered, texture-mapped polygons, giving it the most detailed graphics yet seen in a video game up until that time. The following year, Electronic Arts produced The Need for Speed, which would later spawn the world's most successful racing game series and one of the top ten most successful video game series overall. In the same year, Midway introduced Crusin' USA. In 1995, Sega Rally Championship introduced rally racing and featured cooperative gameplay alongside the usual competitive multiplayer. Sega Rally was also the first to feature driving on different surfaces (including asphalt, gravel, and mud) with different friction properties and the car's handling changing accordingly, making it an important milestone in the genre. In 1996, Nintendo created a 3D game called Mario Kart 64, a sequel to Super Mario Kart and has an action so that Lakitu need to either reverse, or rev your engines to Rocket Start. Lakitu can also rescue players. Unlike Sega Rally Championship, Mario Kart 64 focus only some racing and the items used. Atari didn't join the 3D craze until 1997, when it introduced San Francisco Rush. In 1997, Gran Turismo was released for the PlayStation, after being in production for five years since 1992. It was considered the most realistic racing simulation game in its time, combined with playability, enabling players of all skill levels to play. It offered a wealth of meticulous tuning options and introduced an open-ended career mode where players had to undertake driving tests to acquire driving licenses, earn their way into races and choose their own career path. The Gran Turismo series has since become the second-most successful racing game franchise of all time, selling over 80 million units worldwide as of April 2018. By 1997, the typical PC was capable of matching an arcade machine in terms of graphical quality, mainly due to the introduction of first generation 3D accelerators such as 3DFX Voodoo. The faster CPUs were capable of simulating increasingly realistic physics, car control, and graphics. Colin McRae Rally was introduced in 1998 to the PC world, and was a successful semi- simulation of the world of rally driving, previously only available in the less serious Sega Rally Championship. Motorhead, a PC game, was later adapted back to arcade. In the same year, Sega releases Daytona USA 2 (Battle On The Edge and Power Edition), which is one of the first racing games to feature realistic crashes and graphics. 1999 introduced Crash Team Racing, a kart racing game featuring the characters from Crash Bandicoot. It was praised for its controls and courses. Crash Bandicoor and its racing series has continued, with the most recent game being Crash Team Racing: Nitro Fueled. (June 2019) 1999 also marked a change of games into more \\"free form\\" worlds. Midtown Madness for the PC allows the player to explore a simplified version of the city of Chicago using a variety of vehicles and any path that they desire. In the arcade world, Sega introduced Crazy Taxi, a sandbox racing game where you are a taxi driver that needed to get the client to the destination in the shortest amount of time. A similar game also from Sega is Emergency Call Ambulance, with almost the same gameplay (pick up patient, drop off at hospital, as fast as possible). Games are becoming more and more realistic visually. Some arcade games are now featuring 3 screens to provide a surround view. ===2000s=== In 2000, Angel Studios (now Rockstar San Diego) introduced the first free-roaming, or the former \\"free form\\", racing game on video game consoles and handheld game consoles with Midnight Club: Street Racing which released on the PlayStation 2 and Game Boy Advance. The game allowed the player to drive anywhere around virtual recreations of London and New York. Instead of using enclosed tracks for races, the game uses various checkpoints on the free roam map as the pathway of the race, giving the player the option to take various shortcuts or any other route to the checkpoints of the race. In 2001 Namco released Wangan Midnight to the arcade and later released an upgrade called Wangan Midnight R. Wangan Midnight R was also ported to the PlayStation 2 by Genki as just Wangan Midnight. In 2003, Rockstar San Diego's Midnight Club II was the first racing game to feature both playable cars and playable motorcycles. Namco released a sort of sequel to Wangan Midnight R called Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune. There is a wide gamut of driving games ranging from simple action-arcade racers like Mario Kart: Double Dash (for GameCube) and Nicktoon Racers to ultra-realistic simulators like Grand Prix Legends, iRacing, Virtual Grand Prix 3, Live for Speed, NetKar Pro, GT Legends, GTR2, rFactor, X Motor Racing and iPad 3D racer Exhilarace ‚Äî and everything in between. ref> ==Subgenres== ===Arcade-style racing=== Arcade- style racing games put fun and a fast-paced experience above all else, as cars usually compete in unique ways. A key feature of arcade-style racers that specifically distinguishes them from simulation racers is their far more liberal physics. Whereas in real racing (and subsequently, the simulation equivalents) the driver must reduce their speed significantly to take most turns, arcade-style racing games generally encourage the player to \\"powerslide\\" the car to allow the player to keep up their speed by drifting through a turn. Collisions with other racers, track obstacles, or traffic vehicles is usually much more exaggerated than simulation racers as well. For the most part, arcade-style racers simply remove the precision and rigor required from the simulation experience and focus strictly on the racing element itself. They often license real cars and leagues, but are equally open to more exotic settings and vehicles. Races take place on highways, windy roads, or in cities; they can be multiple-lap circuits or point-to-point sprints, with one or multiple paths sometimes with checkpoints, or other types of competition, like demolition derby, jumping, or testing driving skills. Popular arcade-style racers include the Need for Speed series, the Ridge Racer series, the Daytona USA series, the Sega Rally series, the Rush series, the Cruis'n series, the Midnight Club series, the Burnout series, the Out Run and MotorStorm series. During the mid-late 2000s there was a trend of new street racing; imitating the import scene, one can tune sport compacts and sports cars and race them on the streets. The most widely known ones are the Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition and the Midnight Club series, certain entries in the Need for Speed series, Initial D series, and the Juiced series. Some arcade-style racing games increase the competition between racers by adding weapons that can be used against opponents to slow them down or otherwise impede their progress so they can be passed. This is a staple feature in kart racing games such as the Mario Kart series, but this kind of game mechanic also appears in standard, car-based racing games as well. Weapons can range from projectile attacks to traps as well as non-combative items like speed boosts. Weapon- based racing games include games such as Full Auto, Rumble Racing, and Blur. ===Simulation racing=== Simulation style racing games strive to convincingly replicate the handling of an automobile. They often license real cars or racing leagues, but will sometimes use fantasy cars built to resemble real ones if unable to acquire an official license for them. Vehicular behavior physics are a key factor in the experience. The rigors of being a professional race driver are usually also included (such as having to deal with a car's tire condition and fuel level). Proper cornering technique and precision racing maneuvers (such as trail braking) are given priority in the simulation racing games. Although these racing simulators are specifically built for people with a high grade of driving skill, it is not uncommon to find aids that can be enabled from the game menu. The most common aids are traction control (TC), anti-lock brakes (ABS), steering assistance, damage resistance, clutch assistance and automatic gear changes. Some of these racing simulators are customizable, as game fans have decoded the tracks, cars and executable files. Internet communities have grown around the simulators regarded as the most realistic and many websites host internet championships. Some of these racing simulators consist in Forza Motorsport, Gran Turismo, Assetto Corsa, Project Cars and many more. ===Kart racing=== SuperTuxKart, an example of a kart racing video game Kart racing games have simplified driving mechanics while adding obstacles, unusual track designs and various action elements. Kart racers are also known to cast characters known from various platform games or cartoon television series as the drivers of \\"wacky\\" vehicles. Kart racing games are a more arcade-like experience than other racing games and usually offer modes in which player characters can shoot projectiles at one another or collect power-ups. Typically, in such games, vehicles move more alike go-karts, lacking anything along the lines of a gear stick and clutch pedal. Crashing Race (1976) was the first game to include car combat. The game was also slower than other racing games of the time due to hardware limitations, prompting the developers to use a go-kart theme for the game. Since then, over 50 kart racing games have been released, featuring characters from Nicktoons to Mario. ==See also== * Vehicle simulation game * List of racing video games * List of vehicular combat games ==References== Racing Video Game Category:Video game genres Category:Video game terminology ","title":"Racing video game"},{"id":"306094","text":"Playmobil () is a line of toys produced by the Brandst√§tter Group (Geobra Brandst√§tter GmbH & Co KG), headquartered in Zirndorf, Germany. The signature Playmobil toy is a tall (1:24 scale) human figure with a particular smiling face. A wide range of accessories, buildings and vehicles, as well as many sorts of animals, are also part of the Playmobil line. Playmobil toys are produced in themed series of sets as well as individual special figures and playsets. New products and product lines developed by a 50-strong development team are introduced frequently, and older sets are discontinued. Promotional and one-off products are sometimes produced in very limited quantities. These practices have helped give rise to a sizeable community of collectors. Collector activities extend beyond collecting and free-form play and include customization, miniature wargaming, and the creation of photo stories and stop motion films, or simply as decoration. Playmobil figure of a woman ==History== Playmobil was invented by German inventor Hans Beck (1929‚Äì2009), considered the \\"Father of Playmobil\\". Beck received training as a cabinetmaker and was also an avid hobbyist of model airplanes, a product he pitched to the company Geobra Brandst√§tter. Horst Brandst√§tter, the owner of the company, asked Beck to develop toy figures for children instead. (The company had originally been a producer of casket ornaments and handles.) Beck spent three years from 1971 to 1974 developing what became Playmobil. Beck conducted research that allowed him to develop a toy that would not be too complex but would nevertheless be flexible. He felt that too much flexibility would get in the way of children's imaginations, and too much rigidity would cause frustration. The toy he conceived would fit in a child's hand and its facial design was based on children's drawings: a large head, a big smile, and no nose. \\"I would put the little figures in their hands without saying anything about what they were,\\" Beck remarked. \\"They accepted them right away ... They invented little scenarios for them. They never grew tired of playing with them.\\". The 1973 oil crisis made it possible for Playmobil to be considered a viable product. The rising oil prices imposed on geobra Brandst√§tter, for whom Beck worked as head of development, demanded that the company turn to products that required less solid plastic material than the hula hoops and other large plastic items the company had been producing as toys. In 1974, the company put the first sets of knights, Native Americans, and construction workers on show in its display rooms. Initially, visitors were reluctant to accept the toy. Nevertheless, the toy was shown at the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg, which took place that same year. A Dutch firm agreed to buy a whole year's production. By the end of the year, geobra Brandst√§tter had achieved sales of 3 million Deutschmarks with Playmobil ‚Äî one-sixth of the company's total sales. Playmobil began to be sold worldwide in 1975, and by 2009, approximately 2.2 billion Playmobil figures had been sold. Playmobil‚Äôs revenue in 2008 was $589 million. Playmobil has been a major competitor to Lego toys. Examples of directly competing toys in both their product lines are not hard to find. Within the limitations of the Playmobil toy world, the Playmobil toys are usually realistic, and present accurate representations of arms, armor, costumes, and tools from a recognizable time period. Especially notable for their fine attention to detail are the modern construction and city life toys (automobiles, cranes, fire engines, trains, boats, etc.). ==Products and licensing== Playmobil toys are specifically aimed at children from the ages of four to twelve. The company believe that older children tend not to play with these types of toys and so they have resisted creating toys from less well- known historical time periods. Many adults own or collect Playmobil and make movies with the toys. The first Playmobil sets were themed around Native Americans, construction workers and knights. Playmobil hands were designed to be capable of gripping and holding objects. Earlier figures had arms of one piece. Since 1982 all figures have hands that also rotate at the wrist. Almost all Playmobil figures are unnamed, thus allowing children to invent their own characters. Exceptions to this include the many characters from the three Playmobil-inspired computer video games produced by Ubi Soft Montreal between 1998 and 1999, such as Alex, Hype and Laura, the protagonists from their respective games. The first figures used a chiseled out hairpiece with a button shape for adding headgear, until a later redesign gave the hairpiece a more natural rounded shape, also prompting a redesign of the headgear. The first female figures were distinguished by hairstyle and a wider chestpiece suggesting a skirt, until a redesign replaced the chestpiece with more displayed breasts and slightly thinner arms. Most Playmobil sets require some assembly by the owner. Buildings especially come with detailed instructions for putting them together. Playmobil building parts were originally designed to fit together using a system of tabs and slots known as \\"Steck-System\\". In recent years a new construction system has been introduced that dispenses with the tabs and instead uses small connector pieces and a special tool. This is known as \\"System-X\\" and is now the standard Playmobil construction system, Steck-System having been retired except for special reissues. Connector pieces and special tool used in System-X. A number of different companies were licensed throughout Europe and Latin America to produce and distribute Playmobil figures: In Spain, figures were produced by the leading dollmaker Famosa, and marketed as \\"los clicks de Famobil\\". Spanish packages listed the quantity of male dolls (clicks) and females (clacks). Females were distinguished by hairstyle, a wider chestpiece suggesting a skirt, and some had arms that look bent but are not. Greek figures were produced during the 1970s by a company called Lyra. In Argentina Playmobil is licensed by Antex, for distribution in all South American markets. Previously Playmobil was licensed through a number of different companies, including Brazil's Trol, Estrela and Industria de Brinquedos do Amazonas, and Peru's BASA. From 1976 to 1980, Playmobil was licensed by Louis Marx and Company in the United Kingdom and sold under the brand name Playpeople. Playmobil was introduced to the United States by Mattel and Schaper.http://www.collectobil.com/guide/schaper.html In 1982, Schaper arranged a promotion to distribute Playmobil toys nationwide as in McDonald's Happy Meals. The five Playmobil toys that were to be included in the promotion were a Sheriff, an Indian, a Sheriff's Horse, an Umbrella Girl and a Farmer. Approximately 10 million of the Sheriff and Indian Playmobil toys were distributed from October 22 through November 1, 1982. Before the other toys could be distributed McDonald's ceased distribution and promotion of Playmobil at its restaurants after tests showed that the toy failed to comply with Consumer Product Safety Commission standards designed to prevent children under three from choking on dangerous items. (The Playmobil toys were not involved in any reported choking incidents.) McDonald's customers with children under three who received these toys were advised to discontinue their use and return the toys to a McDonald's in exchange for a dessert, a cone, or a refund. Over the years, some proposed sets have included Chinese Railroad Workers and a Grave Digger for the Western theme, as well as a Medieval Torture Room. Prototypes were made. However, these sets were considered insensitive and inappropriate for young children, and were never released. There are however sets including ghosts and a mummy containing a skeleton. In 2004, BMW licensed the familiar Playmobil look and feel to release an exclusive BMW Z4 done in Playmobil scale. It also came with two Playmobil passengers. Originally, the only way to get one of these Z4s (available in deep red or blue) was to take a test drive at a BMW dealership in Germany. Shortly thereafter, versions in a pale yellow or eggshell blue were available in European toy stores. Though not manufactured by Playmobil, they were officially licensed. Playmobil pop-up books, in which buildings and settings corresponded to the height of actual Playmobil figures, were sold for a time, as well as a series of comic books, coloring books, and puzzles. ===Bootlegs and unauthorized figures=== In 1978, , a German-Hungarian firm, began reproducing bootleg Playmobil figures. They had not received any authorization or license from geobra Brandst√§tter. Schenk produced exact copies of the original toy, though some sets were modified to create new types of sets, usually military, from Hungarian history. Thus, Schenk produced the Hussar (Husz√°r), from the period of the Hungarian War of Independence as well as the Hungarian hussar series (Magyar husz√°r sorozat). Other sets included the Austrian soldier (Osztr√°k), Turkish soldier (T√∂r√∂k), William Tell (Tell Vilmos), and the Hunyadi series (Hunyadi sorozat). Schenk figures, like the early Playmobil figures, do not have moveable hands, and unlike the Playmobil horses, the Schenk horses do not have moveable heads. Schenk figures also bear different colors from their Playmobil counterparts. They were also made with inferior plastic. Following the collapse of communism, a 1995 court ruling forbade the manufacture and distribution of the Schenk figures. The owner of Schenk, K√°roly Schenk, was allowed to sell off his remaining toy figures only in Hungary until March 1996. However, Schenk bootlegs may still be available in toy shops in Hungary. Bootleg sets also have been manufactured in China. These sets are not marketed as Playmobil, though they are identical in terms of appearance (but not in regards to quality). Sets include a \\"Noshery\\" (fast food eatery), \\"Pirate Island\\", and medieval figures. ===Product labeling and criticism=== Playmobil has received criticisms for the lack of presence of the Catalan Language in the labeling of its products in Catalonia despite being bound by current legislation. Catalan consumers mobilized in various actions to request not to be discriminated against and to demand the company to comply with the regulations passed by the Parliament of Catalonia in the same way as it did with the rest of the European legislation on labeling. ===European factories=== Playmobil Park, Malta. There are currently three main factories in Europe: Germany, Malta, and Spain. Each location specializes in a particular area of manufacturing and parts that are needed to assemble a set are delivered to the destination where the items will be placed together and put in their final packaging before sale. Malta specializes in making the characters and a few accessories, Spain specializes in accessories, and Germany makes the bigger items such as ships and castles. ==Distribution== New Playmobil sets are released over a two-year period, with the non-export markets getting new sets first, then the export markets receiving them a year later. This is done so that Playmobil will only have to make one very expensive mold for each new piece, and still be able to manufacture the initial stock of the new set. This first stock is what initially stocks store shelves; afterwards Playmobil makes smaller quantities to refill shelves in accordance with demand. In order to produce enough sets to release them to the entire world at the same time, Playmobil would need to buy two of each mold. Eventually, as production for the piece slowed down, the second mold would be useless.

Shelton helped to launch the career of a then-unknown 20-year-old Bob Dylan. In 1961, Dylan was performing at Gerdes Folk City in the West Village, one of the best-known folk venues in New York, opening for the bluegrass act the Greenbriar Boys. Shelton's positive review in The New York Times brought crucial publicity to Dylan and led to a Columbia recording contract. Track 2. Shelton had previously noted Dylan in a review for the New York Times of WRVR's live twelve-hour Hootenanny, July 29, 1961. \\"Among the newer promising talents deserving mention are a 20-year-old latter-day Guthrie disciple named Bob Dylan, with a curiously arresting mumbling, country-steeped manner.\\" This was Dylan's first live radio performance. ==Biography== Shelton was born in Chicago in 1926 under the name Robert Shapiro, the son of Joseph and Hannah Shapiro, Russian Jewish immigrants. His father, a research chemist, was born in Minsk and came to the US in 1905. Shelton was raised in Chicago, served in the US Army in France during 1944-45, and attended the School of Journalism at Northwestern University. He moved to New York in the 1950s, and soon joined the staff of The New York Times. In 1955, Shelton was one of 30 New York Times staffers subpoenaed by the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, who were informed by Times counsel Louis M. Loeb that they would be fired if they took the Fifth Amendment. Shelton refused to answer questions from the committee about any affiliation with the Communist Party or about fellow Times staffer Matilda Landsman, and was indicted by a grand jury for contempt. Because he did not plead the Fifth he was allowed to continue working at the Times but was transferred away from the news department onto the less sensitive entertainment desk, where he became a music critic. Convicted and sentenced to six months in prison, he appealed his conviction and had it reversed on a technicality, only to be indicted, retried, convicted, and have the conviction overturned on a technicality again. After several years of appeals in which he was represented by noted civil liberties lawyer Joseph L. Rauh, Jr. the case was finally dropped in the mid-1960s. For a decade (1958‚Äì1968), Shelton reviewed music, in particular folk music, but also pop and country music, becoming a friend of many of the artists and extending his influence beyond the pages of the Times. He reviewed the inaugural Newport Folk Festival (NFF) for The New York Times and The Nation and edited the program for the influential 1963 NFF under the pen name 'Stacey Williams'. He wrote album notes for several artists, including Bob Dylan's first album (credited to 'Stacey Williams'). During the early 1960s, Shelton co-edited a magazine, Hootenanny, at the same time as his friend Linda Solomon edited a different magazine titled ABC-TV Hootenanny. Shelton spent 20 years writing and rewriting his Dylan biography, No Direction Home, The Life and Music of Bob Dylan which was finally published in 1986, after years of arguments with publishers about the style and length of the work. Shelton's intention from the outset was to write a serious cultural study, not a showbiz biography; as a result, he later said his life's work had been \\"abridged over troubled waters\\". The title is taken from the lyric of Dylan's hit single, \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\". The same title, No Direction Home, was used by Martin Scorsese for his 2005 documentary film about Dylan's career from the beginning to his motorcycle crash in 1966.

Nakamichi is a subsidiary of Chinese holding company Nimble Holdings. Nakamichi manufactured electronic devices from its founding in 1948, but only sold them under its own name from 1972. It is credited with offering the world's first three-head cassette deck. Since 1999, its product range has included design-oriented home cinema audio systems, sound bars, speakers, headphones, mini hi-fi systems, automotive stereo products and video DVD products. ==Background== Nakamichi was founded by Etsuro Nakamichi in 1948 as Nakamichi Research Corporation Ltd (‰∏≠ÈÅìÁ†îÁ©∂ÊâÄÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ Nakamichi Kenkyujo Kabushiki Kaisha) in Tokyo, Japan. It specialised in manufacturing portable radios, tone arms, speakers, and communications equipment. It was later headed by the founder's younger brother Niro Nakamichi. The company was originally established as a research and development firm in electronics and optics but later became known as a manufacturer of quality audio products. While its cassette decks were particularly well known, the company is also credited with audio innovations, such as self-centering record players, high-end DAT recorders, and ultra-compact slot-loading CD changers. In the 1950s, Nakamichi developed one of the first open reel tape recorders in Japan under the Magic Tone brand. In 1957, it developed and made its own magnetic tape heads, as well as launching the Fidela 3-head Open Reel Stereo Tape Deck. Because of its experience in manufacturing magnetic tape heads and equipment, in 1967 the company started making tape decks for a number of foreign manufacturers including Harman Kardon, KLH, Advent, Fisher, ELAC, Sylvania, Concord, Ampex and Motorola. From 1973, Nakamichi started to sell high-quality stereo cassette decks that benefited from the mass market's move away from reel-to- reel tape recorders to the cassette format. The Nakamichi 1000 and 700, made in the mid-1970s, had three heads, a dual capstan drive that reduced wow and flutter, and Dolby-B noise reduction to improve the signal to noise ratio. The dual capstan drive ensured superior head-to-tape contact, essentially eliminating reliance on the problematic spring pressure pads built into cassette housings. (Later models were fitted with pressure pad lifters that further improved tape travel stability and reduced head wear.) High-end features of these models included adjustable record head azimuth and Dolby calibration. The relatively high retail price of the 1000 and 700 prompted Nakamichi to offer lower-priced two-head models, such as the Nakamichi 500 and the wedge-shaped 600. A Nakamichi 550. Portable, though the size and weight of an early VCR. The Nakamichi 550 was a portable cassette recorder that had three microphone inputs: one for left channel, one for right channel, and one for a center blend channel. This recorder could run from batteries or AC and was used to make high quality recordings in the field. In the late 1970s, Nakamichi updated and broadened its model range, with revised products including the Nakamichi 1000-II, the 700-II, and the lower-end 600-II. Nakamichi branched out into other audio components such as pre-amplifiers, power-amplifiers, tuners, receivers and later speakers. In the early 1980s, Nakamichi's top-of-the-line cassette deck was the 1000ZXL, retailing at US$3,800, its price only exceeded by the 1000ZXL Limited at US$6,000. The updated 700ZXL sold for US$3,000, but Nakamichi also offered lower-end cassette decks under US$300. This time marked a peak in the market for cassette recorders, before it lost ground to digital recording media such as CD. ==The meaning of the brand name and logo== The Nakamichi logo consists, in part, of the stylized representation of the letter \\"N\\"; it is also intended to represent in a fanciful way the earth, half of which is illuminated by the sun. A translation of \\"Nakamichi\\", the family name of the company founder, is \\"in the middle of a road\\" or \\"midway\\". ==Notable Nakamichi products and advances== ===Three-head cassette decks=== Nakamichi was the first to use a three-head recording technique in a cassette deck. Separate tape heads were used for playback, recording, and erase. Previously the playback and recording functions were combined in a single tape head. The three-head mechanism allowed higher quality reproduction as well as the ability to hear a recording in progress - as the tape traveled past the recording head onto the playback head. The first Nakamichi three-head decks were the 1000 and 700 introduced around 1973. The 1000 and 700 series decks had tape bias settings for normal bias (IEC TYPE I) and high bias (IEC TYPE II). Competitor cassette decks offered Ferri Chrome (IEC TYPE III) whereas Nakamichi chose not to do so. The settings for the normal and high bias were labeled as EX and SX respectively. Nakamichi also sold its own brand of blank cassette tapes. Around 1978, when metal bias (IEC TYPE IV) cassettes came into the market, Nakamichi produced some early metal tape capable decks such as the 580M. The tape settings on these decks were EX (normal bias), SX (high bias), and ZX (metal bias). Around 1980, Nakamichi introduced the third generation of 1000 and 700 three-head decks. The 1000ZXL and 700ZXL had full metal capability as well as normal and high bias abilities and had built-in computers for calibrating the decks to a specific tape. These built-in computers were known as A.B.L.E. for Azimuth, Bias, Level, and Equalization. The user would use this function (activated by an \\"Auto Cal\\" button) to optimize the deck to a specific brand of tape to get best recording results from every cassette. Hence the 1000ZXL and 700ZXL were known as computing cassette decks. Also offered was a third less costly deck the 700ZXE auto tuning cassette deck. A more expensive 1000ZXL Limited was also offered, with the same specifications as the 1000ZXL but with a gold plated face. Other Nakamichi cassette decks are the Cassette Deck 1 and the Cassette Deck 1 Limited. Like the 1000ZXL Limited, the Cassette Deck 1 Limited is more expensive than the Cassette Deck 1. ===Flip-Auto Reverse=== Nakamichi RX-505 audio cassette deck with UDAR. Top view of UDAR mechanism. Called \\"UDAR\\" for UniDirectional Auto Reverse. Used on the Nakamichi RX series of decks. With the advent of auto-reverse (playing the tape in both directions), Nakamichi had long recognized that the angle of the tape passing over the playback head was not the same if the tape head was rotated in the opposite direction and its first approach was to track the azimuth on the tape itself by moving the head slightly‚Äîa very complex affair which led to the design of the Dragon with its NAAC. Nakamichi subsequently abandoned this approach and set its engineers in search of a more elegant solution. Nakamichi soon developed its UDAR mechanism, which mimicked the way people had manually turned over their tapes in the past: a mechanical system that would eject the tape, spin it around and reload it into the deck. It was available on all Nakamichi RX series of tape decks, i.e., the RX-202, RX-303 and RX-505. The 'top of the range' RX-505 was made after the Dragon. Its operation was elegantly simple, easy to set up, easy to calibrate, and easy to use, with only one rewind and forward operation in a unique unidirectional auto-reverse deck. It also had an updated and simpler drive system that was more direct loading, had updated and quieter electronics, and its revised capstan is essentially what Nakamichi used for its 1988 Nakamichi 1000 DAT recorder. ===Tape pressure pad lifter=== A cassette tape contains a \\"pressure pad\\" of some type, usually made of felt (reference image). This pad is within the cassette tape shell (located just behind the tape opening) and opposes the magnetic head of the cassette deck, providing pressure against the head(s) when the tape is being played. Nakamichi found that this pad provided uneven and fairly inaccurate pressure and was therefore inadequate for reliable tape/head contact. Furthermore, Nakamichi found that the pressure pad was a source of audible noise, particularly scrape flutter (the tape bouncing across the head, a result of uneven pressure), and also contributed to premature head wear. Nakamichi's dual-capstan tape decks provide such accurate and precise tape tension that, unlike other decks, the cassette's pressure pad is not needed at all. To remedy this problem, the vast majority of Nakamichi dual- capstan decks contain a \\"cage\\" around the record/playback heads that lifts the pressure pad out of the way so that the deck itself‚Äîspecifically, the dual capstan mechanism‚Äîis able to maintain much more consistent tape tension and tape/head contact during playback. ===The Dragon and special products=== Nakamichi Dragon In the CD era (post 1983), the top line Nakamichi products were termed the \\"Dragon.\\" The Dragon-CT turntable (\\"Computing Turntable\\") automatically adjusted for off-center holes in records by moving the platter in two dimensions. The Dragon CD playing system has special mechanical damping to prevent vibrations of the CD, and holds multiple CDs. The Dragon cassette deck used a special microprocessor controlled azimuth adjustment called Nakamichi Automatic Azimuth Correction (NAAC) to find the best sound for each recorded cassette tape, however because it was both expensive to manufacture and more complex as well as difficult to both service and maintain, Nakamichi sought to produce a new deck with the same excellent accuracy of azimuth but without the associated costs and difficulties of servicing. The solution (thought by some to be a gimmick) was to automate the manual turnover of tape; in other words eject the tape and flip it around to maintain proper tape head alignment. Nakamichi did this with its RX series. The RX-505 is not a compromise as many assumed but the very best method of maintaining azimuth without using the costly, complex and 'somewhat' fragile NAAC system even though the Akai GXC-65D was the first cassette deck to \\"actually\\" use this method where the cassette would flip over instead of the head being rotated but was done in a top-loading fashion as this were cassette decks from the early-mid 1970s. Other products from Nakamichi did not acquire the \\"Dragon\\" name but were still notable. These include the Nakamichi 1000 series products with the 1000ZXL cassette deck being more advanced and expensive than the Dragon cassette deck. The Nakamichi 1000 digital audio tape transport and Nakamichi 1000p digital to audio converter system were Nakamichi's reference digital audio tape components. These components were intended to establish Nakamichi's dominance in the field of digital audio tape (DAT), but DAT was not widely adopted by audiophiles, as the format itself did not gain acceptance as an industry standard. ===Stasis Series amplifiers=== Nakamichi licensed \\"Stasis\\" technology from powerhouse amplifier manufacturer Threshold (a class-A amplifier circuit by Nelson Pass, then a designer at Threshold, now at Pass Labs). This circuit was used in a line of expensive Nakamichi PA series of power-amplifiers, such as the PA-5 and PA-7, as well as its SR and TA series of receivers. ===Car stereo products=== In the early 1980s, Nakamichi introduced a line of car stereo products. The flagship product was the TD-1200 cassette receiver which incorporated a drawer-mounted, top-loading cassette mechanism with NAAC (like the Dragon), Dolby B and Dolby C. Other early products included the TD-700 cassette receiver with manual azimuth adjustment (like the Cassette Deck 1, Cassette Deck 1 Limited, DR-1 and the CR-7), a power amplifier and speakers. In the early 1990s, Nakamichi was one of the first companies to produce automotive CD changers that loaded multiple discs via a single slot rather than a CD cartridge. Toyota would choose Nakamichi along with Pioneer to manufacture the audio systems for its range of Lexus automobiles. The Nakamichi unit was the flagship audio system offered to Lexus buyers, and this partnership lasted from 1989 to 2001. Another follow-on flagship head unit was the TP-1200, which consisted of a headunit and a separate 'black box' pre-amp section. The casing for both units was made from machined aluminium, and the internal circuitry for both units was suspended using a mechanical suspension system. The headunit contained a diversity tuner and display unit only. The pre-amp section performed input switching, volume and tone adjustment. The tone controls (bass-mid-treble) were motor driven analog controls while the volume, balance and fader were digital. Other products of note were the 100pa amplifier and the limited edition version the 1000pa. Both were identical in specifications (4x50wrms) and internal layout, the only difference being the case color. The 100pa was silver and the 1000pa black. The mobile TD-560 was a versatile pull-out-of-dash and remote controlled cassette and FM tuner head unit, that performed at the level of excellence matched only by very best Nakamichi mobile decks of the late 1980s era. Revolutionary was Nakamichi's mobile PA-350 four channel power amplifier, with extraordinary discrete amplifiers and exemplary performance specifications. In 1989 Nakamichi, along with Pioneer, teamed with Toyota Corp. to produce a premium sound system in its Lexus line of automobiles. In 1990, Nakamichi introduced the music bank in its CD players which was based on a single loading tray concept with a total capacity of 7 CDs. This differed from the rest of the industry which typically offered a self-loading magazine or a carousel. Nakamichi further enhanced the music bank system in its 1992 offering (MB line) touting the quickest changer in the market. However, the quick changer concept experienced frequent jamming in its machines and as a result, required the company to redesign the mechanism in 1994 with a slight delay during the loading process. While this was corrected, Nakamichi's footing in the digital age was not concrete. In fact, its presence in the rapidly growing audio/video arena was modest at best with its Sansui sourced employed at Nakamichi in 1990-1991 AV-1 and AV-2 receivers (introduced in 1991). Further impacting its audio reputation was the ending of the licensing agreement with Nelson Pass for the use of the Stasis technology. Without it, its line of preamplifiers and power amplifiers were compromised; its technological advantage, more important in the high end audio market, was lost. Nakamichi attempted to counter the loss with its receivers touting Harmonic Time Alignment (HTA). ===Nakamichi Harmonic Time Alignment technology=== The time alignment of an amplified music signal and its distortion components has a profound effect on perceived sound quality. Nakamichi researchers discovered that the human ear is much more tolerant of harmonic distortion if the distortion components are time-aligned with respect to the primary signal. Nakamichi Harmonic Time Alignment (HTA) amplifiers adopt a wideband, low open-loop gain design. A minimal amount of negative feedback is used, but, more important, it is kept constant over the entire audio spectrum. This assures the proper timing between the primary signal and any amplifier distortion components. The sonic benefits of this design include powerful, high-resolution bass, a natural, richly detailed midrange, and smooth, clear highs. In layman's term, HTA masked distortion through the primary signal. While effective, total harmonic distortion for this technology was higher than Nakamichi's receivers utilizing Stasis technology. Whether sound quality improved or dissipated with this technology is left to the listener's ears. ==Decline of Nakamichi== Nakamichi's reputation for being the pioneer of audio cassettes no longer carried weight in the era of CDs. The lack of innovative digital technology meant Nakamichi was unable to successfully brand itself in the digital age. Further adding to its demise was a shrinking distribution channel as high-end audio boutiques were forced to close as they could not compete in a rapidly changing environment where shoppers gravitated towards electronic superstores. Ultimately, electronic consumers, who once were able to apply a significant portion of their outlay on audio-only components, needed to allocate more of their budget towards acquiring new video gear such as laser disc players, flat panel displays, DVD players, etc. In addition, a recession in the early 1990s caused many consumers to settle for mainstream electronics brands. Toyota also stopped using Nakamichi systems in Lexus vehicles at this time, instead choosing Mark Levinson when Toyota made a deal with Harman International to provide premium audio systems in its vehicles in 2000. Bob Carter, General Manager for Lexus, also cited a lack of \\"resonance\\" with intended consumers as reasons for the switch. By the end of 1990s, Nakamichi failed to transition properly. In 1998, it was acquired by Grande Holdings, a Chinese company based in Hong Kong. Grande Holdings included electronics companies Akai and Sansui. Niro Nakamichi left in 1998 to set up Mechanical Research Corporation. == Nakamichi under Grande Holdings== The company went into bankruptcy protection on February 19, 2002. In Nakamichi's defense, many high end audio manufacturers were also forced to merge or sell to larger holding companies during this time period partially influenced by the collapse of the Japanese \\"bubble economy\\"; such well known companies include McIntosh and Mark Levinson. The company emerged from bankruptcy and repositioned itself as a manufacturer of high-end \\"lifestyle systems\\" in the same manner as Bang & Olufsen. They also manufacture CD changers for hi-fi, computer, and car audio units. In June 2006, Nakamichi released its first portable DVD player with built-in LCD screen, the Lumos. Nakamichi Kimono 3D LED TV with slim full brushed aluminium bodyFrom 2011, Nakamichi offered a complete line of mass market audio products, including earbuds, headphones, speakers, wireless speakers and sound bars. Also to target a younger demographic, they manufactured iPod docking systems and 3D LED TVs. In 2014, Nakamichi moved back to its high-end roots and presented a 7.1 Pre-/main Amplifier combination AV1/AVP1.whathifi.com 15 May 2014, Nakamichi AV1/AVP1 review retrieved 13 2020-04-13. In 2016, its focus shifted to soundbars by introducing its Shockwafe soundbar series. The first model, the Shockwafe Pro 7.1 soundbar, was the first soundbar to have 7 discrete surround channels. In 2018, Nakamichi added 4 more models into its Shockwafe lineup, incorporating dual subwoofers, quad modular surround speaker technology and DTS:X compatibility. The flagship Shockwafe Ultra 9.2 DTS:X, Shockwafe Elite 7.2 DTS:X and Shockwafe Plus 5.2 were the industry's first soundbars designed with two subwoofers, while the Shockwafe Pro 7.1 DTS:X featured a single down-firing subwoofer. The Shockwafe Ultra 9.2 DTS:X pioneered Nakamichi's quad modular surround speaker technology, of which its four surround speakers could be attached as pairs to become two sets of dipole surround speakers, enabling the sound to reverberate off walls to create the same true surround sound environment as when the four surround speakers were placed individually. During the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas, a series of blind listening battles were conducted for the public, including 2 exclusive sessions for members of the San Francisco Audiophile Society and private sessions to the media. Out of 204 people who participated, 81% voted Nakamichi Shockwafe Ultra 9.2 DTS:X Soundbar for best overall performance and 99% voted it for best overall value. In 2019, Nakamichi released 3 new Shockwafe soundbar models, the Shockwafe Ultra 9.2.4 SSE, Shockwafe Elite 7.2.4 SSE and Shockwafe Pro 7.1.4 SSE. Besides retaining the features of the 2018 models, all of the 2019 versions are integrated with Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and proprietary Spatial Surround Elevation (SSE) processing technology. SSE consists of 3 processing engines - Spatial, Surround and Elevation engines - that combine to enhance the overall surround sound performance. The Spatial engine amplifies high frequencies from the input audio signal and engages the high-frequency tweeters on the soundbar and rear/surround speakers to enlarge the spaciousness of the sound. The Surround engine utilizes upmixing, volume and phase improvements to the input audio signal to optimize the clarity and balance of the surround sound. The Elevation engine stables the processing of 3D object-based content including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X and interlaces a height effects sound layer into each of the 12-16 speaker drivers (12 for 7.1.4/7.2.4 SSE and 16 for 9.2.4 SSE) located around the user. Nakamichi's Shockwafe Ultra 9.2 SSE Soundbar System was named a CES 2019 Innovation Awards Honoree. In addition, it won a blind listening contest against the market's flagship Dolby Atmos soundbars that was voted by the public and hosted by Brian Tong, an ex-CNET tech editor. ==Niro Nakamichi== In 2001, Niro Nakamichi, designer of many of the historic tape decks, started a new company, Mechanical Research Corporation, which introduced ultra high end audio amplifiers, preamplifiers, and an integrated amplifier, called \\"engines.\\" The products featured innovative designs and addressed issues of mechanical isolation, as well as presenting a unique appearance.

Matsushita worked in the shop. () K≈çnosuke Matsushita was born on 27 November 1894 in Wakayama Prefecture. His father was an affluent landlord in the farming village of Wasa (part of present-day Wakayama city) and was one of the wealthiest men of his community. ==Teenage years== Shortly after Matsushita left school, he was sent away to Osaka to become an apprentice for a hibachi store. Less than a year into his apprenticeship however, the business failed and Matsushita was left looking for other employment. He then applied for a job with the Osaka Electric Light Company, an electrical utility company. Over the next couple of years, he was promoted several times and his position rose with the company. During this time, Matsushita was introduced to one of his sister's friends, Mumeno Iue, and after a short courtship married her. Matsushita, now head of a new family, was well aware of his new responsibilities. At the age of 22, he was promoted to the position of electrical inspector. It was during this time that Matsushita attempted to introduce his boss to the invention of a new and improved light socket that he had perfected in his spare time. His boss, however, was not enthusiastic. ==Matsushita Electric Industrial Company== Members of Matsushita Electric Housewares Manufacturing Works. Back row from left, K≈çnosuke Matsushita, Toshio Iue, Mumeno Matsushita () In 1917, Matsushita left Osaka Electric Light Company to set up his own company. Without capital, a formal education, or experience in manufacturing, it would appear the company would fail before it even began. He set up his shop in the basement of his tenement. With his wife, his brother-in-law, and several assistants, he began creating several samples of his product. He attempted to peddle the samples to wholesalers but was unsuccessful because he did not offer more than one product. Matsushita's assistants left his company and he was left with only his wife and brother-in-law, Toshio Iue, who proved to be a capable salesman and manager. Matsushita would have eventually become bankrupt but he was \\"saved by an unexpected order for a thousand insulator plates for electric fans.\\" From there, Matsushita was able to continue producing his light sockets. They became popular as wholesalers realized the product was better in quality and less expensive than comparable products in the market. The early years of the company were difficult: He once had to pawn his wife's kimono when he found himself short on money. Matsushita's products were originally marketed under the name brand of \\"National\\" and later moved on to the more recognizable names of Panasonic, Quasar and Technics. One of Matsushita's best products was his invention of a more efficient battery-powered bicycle lamp. During the 1920s, bicycle lamps were candles or oil-burning lamps. They were highly inefficient as they usually only lasted for three hours. He created an oval lamp that used a battery for power and a lightbulb for illumination. He had to personally market his products to retail bicycle shops. ==Expansion== Matsushita learned a very important lesson in terms of growing a company while he was trying to introduce his bicycle lamp to wholesalers. He realized that even if he had a product that was superior to anything out in the market it would not matter if he could not sell the product. As a result, Matsushita began devising ways to create sales channels for his products by concentrating less on manufacturing and more on building a sales force, which led to a retail store network and finally placed Matsushita's company on the map in Japan's electrical manufacturing and retail industry. In 1929, he began setting up a new structure for his company. The company was structured as a parent company and branches of divisions that specialized in a particular product were created. There were three specific products that were being created in Matsushita's company at this time: the bicycle lamp and battery division, the electrical socket division, and the radio division. For each of these products, a national sales department was formed with regional offices established in strategic locations. These regional offices were responsible for the coordination of sales and manufacturing. Products were manufactured based upon the demand for the products. As a result, manufacturing was dependent on sales. ==Post-war period== During the US occupation of Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur decided to break up the zaibatsu business conglomerates of Japan. Matsushita was in danger of being removed as president but was saved by a favorable petition signed by 15,000 employees. In 1947, K≈çnosuke lent his brother-in-law Toshio an under-utilized manufacturing plant to manufacture bicycle lamps, a business that eventually became Sanyo Electric. From 1950 to 1973, Matsushita's company became one of the world's largest manufacturers of electrical goods, sold under well-known trademarks including Panasonic and Technics. Matsushita stepped down as President of Panasonic in 1961 and was succeeded as president by his son-in-law, Masaharu Matsushita. Konosuke Matsushita's two grandsons are Masayuki Matsushita, who is the current Vice-Chairman of Panasonic, and Hiro Matsushita, who is a former driver in the Champ Car series and owns Swift Engineering, an aerospace firm and race car constructing company which he bought in 1991. Hiro Matsushita is also the chairman of Swift Xi, which located in Kobe, Japan. Konosuke Matsushita remained active in Panasonic's operations until his complete retirement in 1973. Since 1954, Matsushita also gained a significant shareholding in manufacturer JVC by forming an alliance. It still retains a 50% share today. In retirement, Matsushita focused on developing and explaining his social and commercial philosophies and wrote 44 published books. One of his books, entitled ‚ÄúDeveloping A Road To Peace And Happiness Through Prosperity‚Äù, sold over four million copies. In 1979, at the age of 84, he founded the Matsushita School of Government and Management to train the future politicians and businessmen of Japan. In 1987, he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers.Matsushita Memorial Library. ==Death== Chronic lung problems led to his death from pneumonia on 27 April 1989, at the age of 94. He died with personal assets worth US$3 billion, and left a company with US$42 billion in revenue business. ==Awards and honours== Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty presenting a certificate proclaiming July 15th as Matsushita Day to K≈çnosuke and Mumeno at Los Angeles City Hall.

It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper; previous inventions in Europe had used rotating drums to make such transmissions. The telautograph's invention is attributed to Elisha Gray, who patented it on July 31, 1888. Gray's patent stated that the telautograph would allow \\"one to transmit his own handwriting to a distant point over a two-wire circuit.\\" It was the first facsimile machine in which the stylus was controlled by horizontal and vertical bars. The telautograph was first publicly exhibited at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago. Telautograph patent schema While the patent schema's geometry implies vertical and horizontal coordinates, systems used in the 20th Century (and presumably before) had a different coordinate scheme, based on transmitting two angles. In an 1888 interview in The Manufacturer & Builder (Vol. 24: No. 4: pages 85‚Äì86) Gray made this statement: > By my invention you can sit down in your office in Chicago, take a pencil in > your hand, write a message to me, and as your pencil moves, a pencil here in > my laboratory moves simultaneously, and forms the same letters and words in > the same way. What you write in Chicago is instantly reproduced here in fac- > simile. You may write in any language, use a code or cipher, no matter, a > fac-simile is produced here. If you want to draw a picture it is the same, > the picture is reproduced here. The artist of your newspaper can, by this > device, telegraph his pictures of a railway wreck or other occurrences just > as a reporter telegraphs his description in words. The inventor Elisha GrayBy the end of the 19th century, the telautograph was modified by Foster Ritchie. Calling it the telewriter, Ritchie's version of the telautograph could be operated using a telephone line for simultaneous copying and speaking. The telautograph became very popular for the transmission of signatures over a distance, and in banks and large hospitals to ensure that doctors' orders and patient information were transmitted quickly and accurately. Teleautograph systems were installed in a number of major railroad stations to relay hand-written reports of train movements from the interlocking tower to various parts of the station.Chicago, Illinois.

The messages originate in the interlocking tower and are carried to teleautographs in various parts of the station; the trainmaster's office, the passenger agent's office, information desk, etc., photograph by Jack Delano, Feb. 1943 Feb., Farm Security Administration - Office of War Information Photograph Collection (Library of Congress).Walter J. Armstrong, Mechanical and Electrical Equipment of the Toronto Union Station, Journal of the Engineering Institute of Canada, Vol. 4 (1921); pages 87-97, see particularly page 95. The teleautograph network in Grand Central Terminal included a public display in the main concourse into the 1960s; a similar setup in Chicago Union Station remained in operation into the 1970s. Sample work of telautograph A Telautograph was used in 1911 to warn workers on the 10th floor about the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire that had broken out two floors below. An example of a Telautograph machine writing script can be seen in the 1956 movie Earth vs the Flying Saucers as the output device for the mechanical translator. The 1936 movie, Sinner Take All, shows it being used in an office setting to secretly message instructions to a secretary. Telautograph Corporation changed its name several times. In 1971, it was acquired by Arden/Mayfair. In 1993, Danka Industries purchased the company and renamed it Danka/Omnifax. In 1999, Xerox corporation purchased the company and called it the Omnifax division, which has since been absorbed by the corporation. Machines like the Telautograph are still in use today. The Allpoint Pen is currently in use and has been used to register tens of thousands of voters in the United States, and the Long Pen, an invention conceived of by writer Margaret Atwood, is used by authors to sign their books at a distance. == References == ==External links== *Archive of Xerox Omnifax Division website, the successor to Telautograph Corporation. *Telautograph historical description * ===Patents=== Patent images in TIFF format * Art of Telegraphy, issued July 1888 (first telautograph patent) * Telautograph, issued July 1888 *Telautograph, issued October 1891 * Art of and Apparatus for Telautographic Communication, issued October 1891 (improved speed and accuracy) * Telautograph, issued February 1893 * Telautograph, issued April 1893 Category:American inventions Category:Xerox Category:Telecommunications equipment Category:Office equipment Category:Telegraphy Category:19th-century inventions ","title":"Telautograph"},{"id":"306127","text":"Aiwa Exos-9 1980s AIWA HS-P05 Mk II audio cassette player Aiwa F810 cassette deck is a consumer electronics brand owned and used by various companies in different regions of the world. American and other regions are owned by Chicago-based Aiwa Corporation. Towada Audio based in Tokyo owns rights in Japan and elsewhere and has been manufacturing Aiwa-branded products since 2017. In Mexico and other countries in Latin America, rights are owned by Audio Mobile Americas, S.A. Aiwa was founded in 1951 and was once a globally well-regarded brand known for making quality audio products such as speakers, boomboxes and stereo systems. It was the market leader in several product categories. Aiwa created the first Japanese cassette tape recorder in 1964. The company was listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from October 1961 until September 2003. The company became unprofitable in the late 1990s, and was fully bought by Sony in 2003. Aiwa was then rebranded as a new youth-focused division of Sony, but it was unsuccessful and the brand was discontinued by 2006. In 2015, an American audio company known as Hale Devices, Inc. was granted the rights to the brand name, with the company renaming itself Aiwa Corporation and starting to produce audio equipment.http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150423/ISSUE01/150429976/can- the-guy-who-hit-it-with-an-android-alarm-dock-do-it-again-with-stereo-speakers ==History== AIWA logo, 1959‚Äì1991 The company was founded on June 20, 1951, as AIKO Denki Sangyo Co., Ltd., manufacturing microphones, and changed its name to , on March 10, 1959. Mitsuo Ikejiri served as president until 1969. The company was a leading manufacturer of audio products, including headphone stereos, minicomponent stereo systems, portable stereo systems, minidisc players, CD and cassette players, and car stereo systems throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Nearly 86 percent of company revenues were derived from such audio products. 12 percent came from products such as televisions and VCRs, and the remaining two percent from computer peripherals and other life products. Aiwa marketed Japan's first boombox, the TPR-101, in 1968, as well as the first cassette deck, TP-1009. In 1980, Aiwa created the world's first personal stereo recorder, TP-S30. Despite Sony being the major shareholder, healthy competition between the two brands was believed to be profitable. In 1990, Aiwa created the HP-J7 earbuds, designed to be vertically inserted into the ear. In 1993, the first CD+G-compatible portable CD player, the XP-80G, was made. Apart from audio products, Aiwa also has been present in other industries. The company also made and sold video products such as VCRs, color televisions, DVD players, and digital satellite television tuners. Aiwa was also involved in the production of computer peripheral devices, such as modems, terminal adapters, and speakers, and what the company termed \\"life amenity products,\\" such as air cleaners and humidifiers. In 1995, it released a PHS mobile phone, called the PT-H50, which was made for the DDI Pocket network in Japan. That same year, an electric toothbrush, the HA-C10, was released. Aiwa manufactured more than 89 percent of its output outside Japan, with a heavy emphasis on the lower-cost southeast Asian nations of Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The company was also heavily dependent on overseas sales, with more than 80 percent of total revenues being generated outside Japan, with 43 percent in North and South America, 25 percent in Europe, and 13 percent in areas of Asia outside Japan and in other regions. Although not then officially an affiliated company of consumer electronics giant Sony Corporation, by 1982, Sony had a 54.6% stake in the company, effectively giving it a majority control. With growing competition throughout the late 1990s, the company slid towards bankruptcy. In March 2001, the company's president, Masayoshi Morimoto, announced the halving of its workforce, following a second consecutive loss‚Äìmaking year. ===Acquisition by Sony=== The company's logo as part of Sony (2004‚Äì2006) The troubled company was then fully purchased by Sony Corporation. As of December 31, 2003, Aiwa ceased to be a separate company and became a wholly owned division of Sony. In January 2004, Sony announced the rebranding and relaunch of Aiwa as a \\"youth focused, PC- centric\\" electronics brand. A new logo was presented to the world's media along with a statement of Sony's intention to invest in and \\"revitalize\\" the Aiwa brand. The direction proposed was to capitalize on the growing trend among personal-computer-literate teenagers and young adults to use their PCs for all forms of entertainment (television, films, music, chat). It was also used to expand in markets where Sony is not as strong. However the new direction of Aiwa under Sony did not meet consumer and sales expectations. On January 21, 2005, new product development ended, and by 2006, Aiwa products were discontinued and no longer sold in the market. Sony announced the termination of the brand entirely on May 14, 2008. As of January 2014, the Aiwa website still existed to provide customer-support telephone numbers for some territories and regions, but it also contained many broken links and blank pages. In other regions, such as Europe, it redirected to a page on the Sony website stating that the Aiwa website had closed. === Aiwa USA (2015‚Äì) === In 2015, Dormitus Brands, a Chicago-based brand acquisition company run by Mark Thomann, acquired the trademark right in the U.S. Thomann looked to pair the brand with a company that was innovating in the audio industry, eventually leading to a deal with Hale Devices, Inc., headed by Joe Born. Hale Devices renamed itself into Aiwa. The Aiwa brand was formally relaunched in March 2015, releasing its first product, the Exos-9, a wireless Bluetooth speaker. === Aiwa Co., Ltd. (2017‚Äì) === On April 11, 2017, Japanese audio equipment manufacturer Towada Audio announced that Towada acquired Aiwa brand rights from Sony and would produce Aiwa-branded audio and record player products. == Products == Products of Aiwa include music centres, Hi-Fi, compact disc players, boombox radios and portable CD players. === Stereo Cassette Players === * HS-P06 Produced in 1984. Shipped with TU-01 FM/AM Stereo Tuner Pack === Portable CD players === The portable CD players of Aiwa are equipped with a so-called E.A.S.S. G.P. (Electronic Anti-Shock System) feature with the aim of allowing smooth, skip-free Audio CD playback despite of damaged media and external shaking. ==Logos== The first logo of the company contained AIWA in capital letters, in use until 1991. The second logo changed the font to a lowercase one, as aiwa. In 2004, after the acquisition by Sony, the logo was rebranded as part of Sony's efforts to 'revitalize' the brand, and was in use until the brand's retirement in 2006. Since the brand's resurrection in 2015, the second (1991‚Äì2003) logo is back in use. All logos were colored red. ==Gallery== AIWA CA-W30 Dual Cassette With Equalizer Boombox.jpgAIWA CA-W30 dual cassette boombox Aiwa MINIDISC PLAYER AM-HX55.JPGAiwa AM-XH55 MiniDisc player Radio AIWA.jpgAIWA AR-888 AM receiver AIWA CSD-ES100 Compact Disc Stereo Radio Cassette Recorder.jpgAiwa CSD-ES100 compact CD/radio/cassette recorder AIWA AD WX 333.jpgAIWA AD WX 333 cassette deck AIWA CDÔºèMD MICRO COMPONENT XR-H330MD YEAR1999.JPGAiwa XR-H330 MD micro system (1999) Aiwa TV-A2017S and PlayStation 20090102.jpgAiwa TV-A2017S 21\\" television Aiwa S7000-130311-0004EC.jpgAiwa S7000 cassette recorder Micro Aiwa CM-S32.jpgAiwa CM-S32 microphone AIWA TPR-950 - 4 Band Radio Cassette Recorder.jpgAIWA TPR-950 boombox Aiwa XR-FD55.jpgAiwa XR-FD55 micro system Vintage Aiwa 8 Transistor Radio, Model AR-852, Made in Japan (12352345425).jpgAIWA AR-852 8-transistor radio Vintage Aiwa 10-Transistor Two-Band (AM-FM) Radio, Model AR-127.

It was founded on 22 March 1967 as Daewoo Industrial and was declared bankrupt on 1 November 1999, with debts of about US$50 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ). Prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Daewoo was the second largest conglomerate in South Korea after the Hyundai Group. There were about 20 divisions under the Daewoo Group, some of which survived as independent companies. ==Corporations== The That-El-Emad towers built by Daewoo Corporations Construction Div. in Tripoli, Libya There were about 20 divisions in the Daewoo Group. Daewoo Group had under its umbrella several major corporations: * Daewoo Electronics, a strong force both internationally and in South Korea (sub-branch Daewoo Electronic Components Co.

Seven were built in South Korea, China, Vietnam, and Africa. They were personally designed and furnished by Kim Woo-jung's socialite wife Heeja, who was chairwoman of the company. The most lavish is the 5-star Hanoi Daewoo Hotel, which cost US$163 million to build in 1996 and was decorated by Heeja with fine art, porcelain, sculptures, and marble. She invited 3,000 guests to the opening, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. Kim is believed to have spent time there while \\"on the run\\". ===Daewoo Motor Co., Ltd.=== Daewoo Motors' 1997 Leganza DSME in 1985 Daewoo Motor Co., Ltd. was founded when the Daewoo Group purchased Saehan Motor in 1978, but the Daewoo Motor name did not appear until 1983. The Daewoo Motor brand appeared in the UK in 1995. At the time, it was the only manufacturer not using traditional dealerships ‚Äì it owned and operated its own retail network. It was once considered to be among the top 10 motor companies in terms of production. Due to financial trouble, Daewoo's automotive arm, Daewoo Motor, was sold to General Motors (Korean) in 2001. The Daewoo nameplate continued in South Korea and Vietnam until 2011. The former Daewoo facilities are now producing General Motors vehicles for Asian markets. Daewoo Commercial Vehicles Division was sold to Tata Motors. ==History== The Daewoo Group was founded by Kim Woo-jung in March 1967. He was the son of the Provincial Governor of Daegu. He graduated from the Kyonggi High School, then finished with an Economics Degree at Yonsei University in Seoul. During the 1960s, after the end of the Syngman Rhee government, the new government of Park Chung Hee intervened to promote growth and development in the country. It increased access to resources, promoted exports, financed industrialization, and provided protection from competition to the chaebol in exchange for a company's political support. In the beginning, the Korean government instigated a series of five-year plans under which the chaebol were required to achieve a number of basic objectives. Daewoo did not become a major player until the second five-year plan. Daewoo benefited from government-sponsored cheap loans based on potential export profits. The company initially concentrated on labor-intensive clothing and textile industries that provided high profit margins because of South Korea's large and relatively inexpensive workforce. The third and fourth of the five-year plans occurred from 1973 to 1981. During this period, the country's labor force was in high demand. Competition from other countries began eroding South Korea's competitive edge. The government responded to this change by concentrating its efforts on mechanical and electrical engineering, shipbuilding, petrochemicals, construction, and military initiatives. At the end of this period, the government forced Daewoo into shipbuilding. Kim was reluctant to enter this industry, but Daewoo soon earned a reputation for producing competitively priced ships and oil rigs. During the next decade, the Korean government became more liberal in its economic policies. Small private companies were encouraged, protectionist import restrictions were loosened, and the government reduced positive discrimination (affirmative action), to encourage free market trade and to force the chaebol to be more aggressive abroad. Daewoo responded by establishing a number of joint ventures with U.S. and European companies. It expanded exports of machine tools, defense products (under the S&T; Daewoo company), aerospace interests, and semiconductor design and manufacturing. Eventually, it began to build civilian helicopters and airplanes, priced considerably cheaper than those produced by its U.S. counterparts. It also expanded efforts in the automotive industry and was ranked as the seventh largest car exporter and the sixth largest car manufacturer in the world. Throughout this period, Daewoo experienced great success at turning around faltering companies in South Korea. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Daewoo Group also produced consumer electronics, computers, telecommunication products, construction equipment, buildings, and musical instruments. ==Crisis and collapse== Daewoo Group ran into deep financial trouble in 1998 due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis, increasingly thin relationships with the Korean government under President Kim Dae Jung, and its own poor financial management. With the Korean government in deficit, access to cheap and nearly unlimited credit was severely restricted. In 1998, when the economic crisis forced most of the chaebol to cut back, Daewoo added 14 new firms to its existing 275 subsidiaries, in a year where the group lost a total of 550 billion won (US$458 million) on sales of 62 trillion won (US$51 billion). At the end of 1997, South Korea‚Äôs four biggest chaebol had a debt of nearly five times their equity. While Samsung and LG cut back in the midst of the economic crisis, Daewoo took on 40% more debt. By 1999, Daewoo, the second largest conglomerate in South Korea with interests in about 100 countries, went bankrupt, with debts of about US$50 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ). Soon after the demise, Chairman Kim Woo-Jung fled to Vietnam, and former Daewoo factory workers put up \\"Wanted\\" posters with his picture. Kim returned to Korea in June 2005 and was promptly arrested. He was charged with masterminding accounting fraud of 41 trillion won (US$43.4 billion), illegally borrowing 9.8 trillion won (US$10.3 billion), and smuggling US$3.2 billion out of the country, according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency. On 30 May 2006, Kim was sentenced to 10 years in prison after being convicted of fraud and embezzlement. On the last day of the trial, Kim tearfully addressed the court, \\"I cannot dodge my responsibility of wrongly buttoning up the final button of fate.\\" ===Analysis=== According to an article in The Economist, dated 19 August 1999 (not long after Daewoo's bankruptcy), \\"Its failure was a long time coming.\\" The downfall of Daewoo was and still remains highly controversial because of the sheer importance of chaebols in the national economy. The collapse caused billions of dollars in losses for both South Korean banks and the government, who were forced to stage-manage Daewoo's dissolution to soften the blow. The bankruptcy was not only a financial crisis, but also a political one, and it came as a shock to much of the nation. Michael Schuman of Time stated that while Daewoo's demise had significant consequences, it would have nonetheless been better than propping it up with fresh funds. There was a persistence of the belief that Daewoo and other Korean conglomerates were \\"too big to fail\\". Such belief led many bankers and investors to continually waste money on bailouts, despite the sign that Daewoo was unable to engineer a turnaround and repay these bad loans. Once the too-big-to-fail perception was dispelled, with large conglomerates no longer considered the safest investments, bankers and investors began financing new opportunities in areas which had been starved of capital, such as small firms, entrepreneurs and consumers. Korea's GDP actually rose after Daewoo's unwinding. Schuman also noted a similar analogy with Japan during its lost decade of the 1990s, where banks kept injecting new funds into unprofitable \\"zombie firms\\", on the belief that the firms were too big to fail. However, most of these companies were too debt-ridden to do much more than survive on further bailouts, which led to an economist describing Japan as a \\"loser's paradise.\\" Schuman states that Japan's economy did not begin to recover until this practice had ended. ==Breakup and present status== The group was reorganized into three separate parts: Daewoo Corporation, Daewoo Engineering & Construction and Daewoo International Corporation. They are active in many markets, most significantly in steel processing, ship building and financial services. The corporate entity known as \\"Daewoo Corporation\\" is now known as \\"Daewoo Electronics\\" and is focused solely on manufacturing electronics. Daewoo Electronics survives to this day, despite bankruptcy, with a new brand logo \\"DE\\", but many of the other subsidiaries and divisions have become independent or simply perished under the \\"reorganization\\" by the Korean government under Kim Dae Jung. In North America, Target stores market Daewoo Electronics products under their \\"Trutech\\" brand on an ODM basis. In 2004, General Motors pulled the Daewoo brand of vehicles out of Australia and New Zealand, citing irreparable brand damage. Later that same year, GM announced that Daewoo Motors in Europe would change its name to Chevrolet on 1 January 2005. In 2005, it was announced that Daewoo cars would have a Holden badge in Australia and New Zealand. In South Africa, Thailand, and the Middle East, Daewoo models were already branded Chevrolet. In South Korea, Daewoo was renamed GM Korea. As part of the company reorganization, the content and the structure of its brand portfolio (its brand architecture) was reorganized. In 2011, GM discontinued the Daewoo brand name in South Korea and replaced it with the Chevrolet brand. In 2015 , Daewoo brand was relaunched as Ravon / GM Uzbekistan . The Daewoo commercial vehicle manufacturer was taken over by Tata Motors. ===Involvement in Myanmar=== Daewoo also moved into the oil and gas industry. While Western oil and gas companies were unwilling to conduct business in Myanmar on account of the abysmal human rights record of the ruling military junta, Daewoo is one of three oil companies, along with the French company Total and the American company Unocal, operating in the country. During explorations in 2008, Daewoo found one of the largest gas fields in southeast Asia, the Shwe offshore field, in the Bay of Bengal, about 100 km off Sittwe. The field went into production in 2013. ===The Daewoo brand today=== Today seven companies with the Daewoo brand name remain: * Daewoo Electronics (DE) - Specializing in electronics * Daewoo Engineering & Construction - Specializing in construction * Daewoo International - Specializing in trading and investment * Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) - Specializing in shipbuilding * Tata Daewoo - Specializing in commercial vehicles, wholly owned by Tata Motors of India * Zyle Daewoo Commercial Vehicle - Specializing in buses * Daewoo Express - Inter-city common carrier of passengers by bus serving over 60 destinations in Pakistan. ==See also== *Chaebol *Economy of South Korea *Flanders Loyalty *List of South Korean companies ==References== ==External links== * (archived, 2 Feb 1999) Category:Chaebol Category:Defunct companies of South Korea Category:Conglomerate companies established in 1967 Category:Conglomerate companies disestablished in 1999 Category:1999 disestablishments in South Korea Category:Companies formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Consumer electronics brands Category:South Korean brands Category:Car brands Category:South Korean companies established in 1967 Category:Electronics companies established in 1967 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1967 ","title":"Daewoo"},{"id":"306141","text":"Dei√† Cove Dei√† is a municipality and small coastal village in the Serra de Tramuntana, which forms the northern ridge of the Spanish island of Mallorca. It is located about north of Valldemossa, and it is known for its literary and musical residents. Its idyllic landscape, orange and olive groves on steep cliffs overlooking the Mediterranean, served as a draw for German, English, and American expatriates after the First World War. The English poet, novelist, and scholar Robert Graves was one of the first foreigners to settle in the village, where he collaborated with Laura Riding in setting up the Seizin Press. Graves returned after the war and remained in Dei√† until his death. He used the town as the setting for many of his stories, including the historical novel Hercules my Shipmate. His house is now a museum. Ana√Øs Nin visited the village in the 1920s, and she wrote a short story set on the village's beach. The Spanish writer, Carme Riera, recently wrote a short story about Nin's. The town is also the unnamed setting of the Uruguayan novelist Cristina Peri Rossi's The Ship of Fools (La nave de los locos). The Nicaraguan poet and novelist, Claribel Alegr√≠a, lived in Dei√†. Anja Rubik married fellow model Sasha Knezevic in this village in July 2011. In recent decades, the stars of literature have been eclipsed by the stars of rock and roll. The Virgin Records mogul Richard Branson has a luxury residence in the town, and his label's stars have often visited the village and sometimes jammed at the local bar, Sa Fonda. Dei√† was home to several Canterbury-scene musicians over the years, including Kevin Ayers, Robert Wyatt, and Daevid Allen.

It was similar to the Conscription Crisis of 1917, but was not as politically damaging. ==Background== Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King had been haunted by the way the Conscription Crisis of 1917 had fractured the Liberal Party between its English-Canadian and French-Canadian members. King, who experienced the split first-hand, was determined to avoid another such split.Henderson, Stephen \\"Angus L. Macdonald and the Conscription Crisis of 1944\\" pages 85-104 from Acadiensis, Volume 27, No. 1, Autumn 1997 page 86. In 1922, during the Chanak Crisis, when Britain almost went to war with Turkey, King had first asserted that Canada would not automatically go to war as part of the British empire if Britain did, saying he would consult the Canadian parliament first and presumably declare neutrality if the House of Commons were unwilling to go to war with Turkey.Levine, Allen William Lyon Mackenzie King : a Life Guided by the Hand of Destiny Toronto: Douglas & McIntyre, 2011 pages 131-132. Though there were several reasons for King's reluctance to go to war with Turkey, but at least one of which was the memory of how the First World War had badly strained Canadian domestic unity. During the 1930s, Mackenzie King had displayed what the Canadian historian Colonel John A. English called \\"an abiding aversion to conscription\\" and \\"an apparently unshakable conviction in the efficacy of appeasement\\" as he regarded another world war as \\"the ultimate catastrophe\\" for which no price was too high to avoid.English, John Failure in High Command, Ottawa: Golden Dog, 1991 page 29. In 1935, King had been opposed to sanctions on Italy for invading Ethiopia, in 1936 he had stated that Canada would not take part if Britain decided to take military action in response to the German remilitarization of the Rhineland and in 1938 he had warmly supported the Munich Agreement as the necessary price for peace.English, John Failure in High Command, Ottawa: Golden Dog, 1991 pages 29-30. King had laid down defence spending priorities in April 1939 that declared the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) was to be the main service, the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) the secondary service and the Militia the last on the list as he wanted to avoid fighting a war on land again, which was likely to cause heavy losses. Canada declared war on Germany on September 10, 1939, and sent one division to Europe, which did not have an opportunity to engage in combat before France was defeated by Germany. King's heart was not in the war as he wrote in his diary that if Hitler did not win the war, then Stalin certainly would as he believed that another world war would lead to revolutionary upheaval all around the world, and it would have been much better if the war had been avoided.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 179 A sign of King's true feeling about the war came in April 1943, when the mass grave of the Polish officers massacred by the NKVD in Katyn Wood was discovered, which led King to write in his diary that it was the Poles who caused the outbreak of the war in 1939 by refusing to give in to Hitler's demand that the Free City of Danzig be allowed to rejoin Germany, and as such it was the Poles' own fault for the Katyn Wood massacre and everything else they had suffered since 1939.Rothwell, Victor The Origins of the Second World War, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2001 page 108. The British historian Victor Rothwell wrote that King's \\"spiteful\\" remarks about the Poles causing the war reflected his own resentment at having to declare war on Germany because of public pressure despite his own inclinations towards neutrality. As a war leader, King sought to avoid repeating what he regarded as the mistakes of his Conservative predecessor, Sir Robert Borden, in the First World War, which meant avoiding a situation where conscription might be necessary, and initially attempted to limit Canada's participation in the war solely to the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP).Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 180. King had described the BCATP in a statement as \\"Canada's most effective contribution to the war effort\\", and privately complained that the British should not had asked for a division for Europe before approaching him with the BCATP as he would never have sent the 1st Canadian Division to Britain if he could have settled only for the BCATP. As King saw it, \\"a big RCAF could never lead to conscription\\". Fearing the civil and political unrest that had occurred during World War I, as well as hoping to defeat the nationalist Premier Maurice Duplessis in Quebec who called a snap election in September 1939 to seek a mandate to oppose the war, King pledged in September 1939 to not introduce overseas conscription for the duration of the war. Duplessis's decision to dissolve the assembly on 25 September 1939 to seek a mandate to oppose the war created panic in Ottawa with King calling Duplessis in his diary \\"diabolic\\" and a \\"little Hitler\\", believing Duplessis's aim was to provoke such a crisis between French-Canada and English-Canada that Quebec would leave the Confederation.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 178 During the 1939 Quebec election campaign, the Dominion government made an unprecedented intervention in a provincial election in order to defeat the Union Nationale government and ensure the victory of the pro-war Quebec Liberals under Ad√©lard Godbout with all the resources of the Dominion government being thrown behind the provincial Liberals.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 179 All of the Dominion cabinet ministers representing ridings in Quebec threatened to resign if Duplessis was re-elected, with the threat that there would be nobody to stand up for Quebec in the cabinet if conscription become an issue again. Duplessis was a charismatic, colourful demagogue who preached a mixture of Catholic conservatism and Quebec nationalism who was one of Quebec's ablest politicians, a man King feared so much that in the 1939 election the Prime Minister used the powers of censorship under the War Measures Act to keep Duplessis from speaking on the radio.Paulin, Marguerite Maurice Duplessis, Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2005 page 116. It soon became evident that Duplessis's alcoholism was out of control, and he ran an inept campaign, being clearly drunk at numerous campaign rallies as he delivered rambling speeches denouncing the war, which were most notable for his slurred words and lack of lucidity.Paulin, Marguerite Maurice Duplessis, Toronto: Dundurn Press, 2005 page 117. By electing Godbout as Premier on 25 October 1939, there was an understanding in Quebec that the reward for voting out Duplessis would be no overseas conscription. Many Canadians supported Mackenzie King's pledge, even as it became obvious the war would not end quickly. As in the First World War, young French Canadians joined the few traditional French-speaking regiments of the Canadian army, such as the Regular-Army Royal 22e R√©giment, and several Militia regiments that were mobilized. In the infantry, barracks life and most training was in French and only the command and radio language was in English. In the rest of the military, however, similar French-speaking units were not created. Among the justifications for this policy were the predominance of the radio, and the fact that the technical instruction was only available in English. The 12th Armoured Regiment (Three Rivers Regiment), originally mobilized by the francophone militia unit the Three Rivers Regiment (Tank), was reorganized and fought as an English-speaking unit. Many French-speaking soldiers were sidetracked in this process. One of the most famous was Jean- Victor Allard, who demanded a transfer from the Three Rivers Regiment to the Infantry; he went on to become a brigade commander in Northwest Europe and then in Korea, command a British division in NATO and subsequently become Chief of the Defence Staff of the Canadian Armed Forces, where he took pleasure in creating the first French-speaking brigade.See \\"M√©moires du G√©n√©ral Jean V. Allard\\" 1985 While units such as the Royal 22e R√©giment, Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal, the R√©giment de la Chaudi√®re and the R√©giment de Maisonneuve all had outstanding records during World War II, some feel that if they had been concentrated into the same brigade (as French Canadians requested and as currently exists in the Canadian Armed Forces), it could have become a focus of pride for French Canada, encouraging the war effort and political support in Quebec. These units were, however, distributed among the various English-speaking divisions of the Canadian Army overseas. Jack Granatstein in his book The Generals, suggests that a shortage of French- speaking staff trained officers meant that any attempt to create an entire Francophone brigade would have likely ended in failure. Acceptance of French- speaking units was greater in Canada from the start of the Second World War in comparison to the first. While the creation of the 22nd Infantry Battalion (French-Canadian) required large rallies of French Canadians in 1914 accompanied by political pressure to overcome Minister Sam Hughes' abhorrence of the idea, this greater acceptance of French-Canadian units as well as informal use of their language diminished the ferocity of Quebec's resistance to the war effort. Opposition to conscription was not limited to Quebec. In British Columbia, where the fear of the \\"Yellow Peril\\" was a major issue, many were opposed to conscription as conscripting Chinese-Canadians and Japanese- Canadians would lead to the demand for Asian-Canadians to be given the right to vote, which the white population of British Columbia were adamantly opposed to.Douglas, W.A.B. & Greenhous, Ben \\"Canada and the Second World War: The State of Clio's Art\\" pages 24-28 from Military Affairs, Volume 42, No. 1, February 1978 page 25. From another perspective, many on the political left in Canada had profound doubts about the justice of the war, and the approach of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) to the war has been described as \\"ambivalent\\".Douglas, W.A.B. & Greenhous, Ben \\"Canada and the Second World War: The State of Clio's Art\\" pages 24-28 from Military Affairs, Volume 42, No. 1, February 1978 page 24. ==The Zombies == In June 1940, the government adopted conscription for home service in The National Resources Mobilization Act, 1940 (NRMA), which allowed the government to register men and women and move them into jobs considered necessary for wartime production. The act also allowed for conscription for the defence of Canada, but did not allow conscripts to be deployed for overseas service.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 pages 186‚Äì187 The French-Canadian nationalist mayor of Montreal Camillien Houde in a speech urged all French-Canadian men not to register under the NRMA, which led the Dominion government to use the suspension of habeas corpus under the War Measures Act to send the RCMP in to arrest Houde, who was held without charge until 1944.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 187 From 1940 onward, the Defence Minister James Ralston and the Navy minister Angus MacDonald were seen as the advocates of the armed forces in the cabinet, favouring winning the war even at the price of domestic disunity vs. King who argued that domestic unity could not be fractured as the price for victory.Granatstein, Jack \\"King and Country\\" pages 374-377 from 'International Journal, Volume 24, No. 2, Spring 1969 page 376. The NRMA men who refused to \\"go active\\" were derisively called \\"zombies\\" both in Canada and overseas. The \\"Zombies\\" were so-called because they were soldiers who could not fight in the war, making them like the reanimated corpses from Haitian mythology who were neither alive nor dead, but rather somewhere in-between. The \\"Zombies\\" were widely hated by the men who had volunteered for overseas service and were referred to as cowards. The Canadian military was divided into classes: the \\"A\\" men who volunteered to go overseas and the \\"R\\" men who were the Zombies.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 pages 203‚Äì204 At training camps, officers and NCOs constantly belittled, insulted and humiliated the Zombies to pressure them to \\"go active\\", making for a tense relationship at the best of times. The fact that King kept the Army out of action for as long as possible to avoid another conscription crisis like that of 1917 caused much dismay among the more hawkish Canadians anxious to see Canada get into action.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 204 The Royal Canadian Legion issued its manifesto \\"A Call for Total War\\" that was endorsed by some 500 other civic groups across English Canada.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 188. Mitchell Hepburn, the Premier of Ontario and John B. McNair, the Premier of New Brunswick both demanded overseas conscription in speeches attacking King. A Gallup poll in November 1941 showed 61% of Canadians satisfied with the war effort, but 60% also wanted conscription for overseas service. On 13 November 1941, King's old nemesis from the 1920s, the former Prime Minister, Arthur Meighen became leader of the Conservative Party. Unlike his predecessor, \\"Fighting Bob\\" Manion who had supported King's conscription policies, Meighen made a call for \\"total war\\" including sending the Zombies overseas the central-piece of his criticism of King. Meighen and King had one of the most famous political rivalries in Canadian history as both men passionately hated one another, and Meighen travelled across the country, accusing King of not doing everything within his power to win the war. After the disaster of the Battle of Hong Kong in December 1941 where two Canadian battalions were lost, a storm broke out in Canada with George A. Drew, the leader of the Ontario Conservative Party urging the Canadian people to \\"face the shameful truth\\" that two battalions of badly trained men had been sent to Hong Kong, which was a sign of the failure of King's policies, and of the need for conscription for overseas service.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 203 By the end of 1941, the armies of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union and other allies were all fighting in various theatres of war while the Canadian Army did nothing, guarding Britain against the not very likely threat of a German invasion. By the end of December 1941, the Royal Canadian Air Force which first went into action in the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940 had lost 1,199 men while the Royal Canadian Navy had lost 439 men.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 200 At Hong Kong, the Canadian Army had lost 290 men, with 487 men wounded and the rest taken prisoner to be held under horrific conditions by the Japanese, with most not surviving their captivity.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 202 ==The Plebiscite of 1942== William Mackenzie King voting in the plebiscite on the introduction of conscription for overseas military service By 1941 there were enough volunteers for five overseas divisions. Meanwhile, the Conservatives were pressuring King to advise that the Governor General introduce overseas conscription. The loss of two battalions at Hong Kong had shocked Canadian public opinion and there was a demand for Canada to do more to win the war. Meighen's attacks on King started to resonate, and in January 1942 Meighen resigned his seat in the Senate to enter the House of Commons via a by- election in the Toronto riding of York South, backed by the anti-King Liberal Premier of Ontario Mitchell Hepburn and a \\"Committee of 200\\" representing 200 of Toronto's most influential citizens.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 pages 189‚Äì190. The Liberals did not run a candidate due to a convention that the Leader of the Opposition be permitted entry to the House, however, tacit support was given to CCF candidate Joseph W. Noseworthy with the historian Frank Underhill, who normally worked for the Liberals, writing the speeches for Noseworthy. As the acerbic, sharp-tongued Meighen tended to get the better of King in debates, the Prime Minister feared the return of his archenemy to the Commons, and to rob Meighen of his signature issue, announced that he was calling a referendum to release him from his promise made in September 1939 that there would be no overseas conscription.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 190. Arthur Meighen was defeated in the February 9, 1942 by-election to the CCF's Noseworthy. In an \\"off-the-record\\" interview with two journalists from The Winnipeg Free Press in February 1942, King stated that the purpose of the Canadian expeditionary force then training in the United Kingdom was only to defend Britain in the event of a German invasion, and he would not be sending the five divisions of the expeditionary force to the Middle East as the British were requesting. King told Grant Dexter of The Winnipeg Free Press on 28 February 1942 stated the purpose of the Canadian Army in Britain was \\"to defend the heart of the Empire\\", and criticized Ralston for saying in the House of Commons that he wanted \\"to build up a strong striking force in Britain because we would ultimately use Britain as the springboard for our thrust on the continent\\". King told Dexter \\"the trouble was with Ralston and the general staff. Ralston stood up for the generals, fought the cabinet on their behalf\\". King expressed the view that Ralson was too much under the influence of the generals and that \\"Generals are almost invariably wrong\\". In the same interview, King stated his belief that Japanese would invade British Columbia \\"just as soon as the Japs could muster the men and material\\". The successes of the Japanese in the Asia-Pacific theatre led to widespread fears in early 1942 that soon the Japanese would be landing in British Columbia. The Japanese planned to annex British Columbia once the war was won, but in the spring of 1942 the Japanese were largely preoccupied with plans for the invasion of Australia and Hawaii, and the continuing war with China.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 329 Responding to a racist hysteria that Japanese-Canadians were a \\"fifth column\\" loyal to Japan who would soon be waging a campaign of terrorism against whites, the King government interned all Japanese-Canadians; the RCMP had in fact reported to the government that most Japanese-Canadians were loyal to Canada, and there was no need for internment. The same fears of a Japanese invasion led King to create two divisions, the 6th and the 8th, largely composed of Zombies, that were stationed to guard the Pacific coast while another Zombie division, the 7th, was created to guard the Atlantic coast against a German invasion, just to show that the government was not indifferent to the Maritime provinces, through the military had advised the government there was little danger of a Japanese invasion and even less of a German invasion.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 pages 188‚Äì189. On 27 April 1942 a plebiscite was held on the question, \\"Are you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligations arising out of any past commitments restricting the methods of raising men for military service?\\" In Quebec, the Ligue pour la D√©fense du Canada was founded to campaign for the \\"No\\" side under the slogan , a reference to King's Quebec lieutenant, Ernest Lapointe who had died of cancer in November 1941 and who was fiercely opposed to sending the Zombies overseas.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 205 The Ligue pour la D√©fense du Canada united all spectrum of political opinion in Quebec, with some of its most effective speakers being Andr√© Laurendeau, Henri Bourassa, Jean Drapeau and a young Pierre Trudeau. La Ligue pour la D√©fense du Canada professed to speak for all of Canada in opposing conscription, but its French- Canadian nationalist message had little appeal outside of French-Canada. Reflecting the quasi-fascist mood of the nationalist intelligentsia of Quebec, the speakers for the League often expressed approval of Vichy France, citing the R√©volution nationale as a model for Quebec, and expressed a \\"disturbing anti-Semitic tendency\\". One rally for the League in Montreal ended with the speakers blaming the Jewish community of Canada for dragging Canada into a war with Nazi Germany that did not concern French-Canadians, which almost degenerated into a pogrom with attendees beating up Jews on the streets of Montreal and smashing windows of Jewish shops; only the prompt intervention of the Montreal police put an end to the violence. The plebiscite was supported by most English Canadians as well as the banned Communist Party of Canada which established Tim Buck \\"Yes\\" Committees to campaign for a yes vote. Across Canada, 64.5% of voters were in favour of conscription, with English Canadians voting 83% in favour. The proposal received hardly any support from French Canadians, especially in Quebec, where anti-conscription groups (including one led by Henri Bourassa, the most vocal opponent of conscription in 1917) convinced 72.9% of voters to oppose the plebiscite.Topic 3: The Conscription Crisis Besides Quebec, six largely French-Canadian ridings in New Brunswick and Ontario also voted \\"No\\", as did several German-speaking and Ukrainian- speaking ridings like Vegreville, Alberta, and Rosthern, Saskatchewan. King, who had expected all nine provinces to vote yes, was shocked by Quebec's \\"No\\" vote, and explained that henceforward his policy was now: \\"Not necessarily conscription, but conscription if necessary\\". The government then passed Bill 80, repealing the sections of the NRMA that did not allow for overseas conscription. Bill 80 passed the House of Commons by 158 votes to 58. However, many Canadians still did not support immediate conscription; there were a few riots in Montreal, although these were not on the same scale as the 1917 and 1918 riots. Following the plebiscite, Public Works minister Pierre Joseph Arthur Cardin quit the King cabinet to protest the possibility that the \\"Zombies\\" might go overseas. A number of other Quebec Liberal MPs also left the party in 1942 over the conscription issue, many of whom joined the Bloc populaire canadien when it was formed in the fall of 1942 to campaign against the government. The Defence Minister, Colonel James Ralston resigned in protest over King's unwillingness to send the Zombies overseas, but King refused to accept his resignation.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 pages 205‚Äì206 ==The Aleutians and Italian campaigns== In his Christmas broadcast in 1942, the former Conservative prime minister R.B. Bennett sarcastically noted that this was the fourth Christmas in a row that the Canadian Army was sitting in Britain doing nothing, and that the only battles on land that Canada had fought to date were Hong Kong and Dieppe, both of which were defeats.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 209. In March 1943, during the Operation Spartan war game, General Andrew McNaughton, commanding the First Canadian Army, had been badly defeated, and was judged unfit to command an army in the field with the war game's umpires criticizing McNaughton for leaving his HQ to supervise the building of a bridge while his supply lines were caught up in a huge traffic jam.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 212. After Operation Spartan, the British had been strongly pressuring the Canadians to remove McNaughton before he led the First Canadian Army into a real defeat in a battle.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 211. King had tried to keep the Canadian Army out of action to avoid casualties that might require a difficult decision on overseas conscription, but in the spring of 1943 with the Allies clearly winning the war, he was seized with the fear that the war might end with Canada winning no battles on land, something that was certain to hurt the Liberals in post-war elections.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 pages 20‚Äì-210. Accordingly, King demanded that the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, which had been sent to Britain in 1939, be included in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 210 General McNaughton was not keen on having a division being taken from his command but was promised that 1st Division would return to Britain after Sicily was taken.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 210. A brigade from one of the three \\"home defence\\" divisions in Canada was sent to the Aleutian Islands Campaign in 1943 (the islands were technically North American soil and thus deployment there was not considered \\"overseas\\").Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 189. By this time, there were 34,000 soldiers, mostly Zombies, guarding the coast of British Columbia against a possible Japanese invasion, and to dispel criticism that such a huge force could be more profitably deployed to Europe, King wanted the Zombies to see action. These divisions in British Columbia were made up largely of conscripts, other than officers and NCOs, and desertions before embarkation were noted. Canadian conscripts deployed in the Aleutian Islands Campaign were pointedly issued American helmets. When the 13th Brigade landed on Kiska on 15 August 1943, they discovered that the Japanese had already left, and the island was empty. The major battle that the men of the 13th Brigade had to fight during their six-month stay on Kiska was with the taxmen over the question of whether they were overseas or not, as the former meant exemption from paying taxes on the grounds that they were west of the International Date Line, which they used to argue that they were in fact in Asia, making them overseas. The Revenue department won. Believing in Winston Churchill's repeated statements that Italy was the \\"soft underbelly of Europe\\" and the Italian campaign would be easy, King in the fall of 1943 decided to keep the 1st Division, which was operating as part of the British Eighth Army, in the Italian campaign and to send the division to the mainland of Italy. Furthermore, King decided to send the 5th Canadian Armoured Division and the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade to Italy, which now formed the I Canadian Corps of the Eighth Army. Contrary to Churchill's promises and King's hopes, the Italian campaign proved to be anything but the \\"soft underbelly of Europe\\" as the mountains favoured the defensive, and the Germans made expert use of the mountains of Italy to fight a bitter defensive campaign that took a heavy toll on the Allies. McNaughton for his part had protested strongly against losing the I Canadian Corps to the Eighth Army, as he much preferred to keep both I and II Canadian corps together in the First Canadian Army, making increasingly furious remarks on the issue. The Defence Minister, Colonel Ralston, had McNaughton removed on the spurious grounds of ill-health in December 1943, though Desmond Morton noted that McNaughton appeared very healthy when he returned to Canada later that month.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 pages 210‚Äì212. ==Introduction of conscription== There was an ethnic dimension to the question of volunteering for the war. The Canadian historian Jack Granatstein noted that in both world wars that the Canadians most likely to volunteer to fight overseas were those who identified most strongly with the British Empire, noting that in the First World War that British immigrants were disproportionately over-represented in the ranks of the Canadian Expeditionary Force with two-thirds of those who volunteered in 1914 were British-born and that an \\"extraordinary\\" 228,170 of the 470,000 young male British immigrants in Canada volunteered for the war. It was not until 1918 after conscription was introduced in 1917 that the majority of the CEF finally become Canadian-born. The same pattern repeated itself in the Second World War, with the only difference being this time the majority of the Anglo-Canadians volunteering to fight overseas were Canadian-born rather than being British-born. By contrast, in both world wars, it was the Canadians who least identified with the British Empire who were the ones most likely not to volunteer to fight overseas. Granatstein noted about enlistment in World War II: \\"If French-speaking Canadians enlisted well below their share of the population, as they did, and if ten percent of the total Canadian population joined one of the armed services, then Anglo-Canadians must have enlisted in higher numbers than all or almost all ethnic or religious communities. In other words, Canadians of British origin made up the lion's share of enlistments, exactly as in the Great War, though now most were Canadian-born.\\" Brigadier W.H.S. Macklin, an officer whose task it was to \\"convert\\" the Zombies into \\"going active\\" wrote in May 1944 that he experienced almost total failure with persuading French Canadians to \\"go active\\", adding: \\"The great majority [of NRMA soldiers in other units] are of non-British origin‚ÄîGerman, Italian, and Slavic nationalities predominating. Moreover, most of them come from farms. They are of deplorably low education, know almost nothing of Canadian or British history and in fact are typical European peasants....\\" Granatstein wrote the research has supported Macklin's conclusions, if not his prejudices. However, the need in the Army for men to \\"go active\\" by volunteering for overseas duty led to the ending of the whites-only policy for officers. About 500 Chinese-Canadians enlisted in the military, and unlike in the First World War, some were able to obtain officers' commissions, though this was not easy. After the campaigns in Italy in 1943 and the Normandy invasion in 1944, combined with a lack of volunteers, Canada faced a shortage of troops. The offensive against the Gothic Line in Italy and the Normandy campaign, especially the battles of Caen and the Falaise Gap had decimated the Canadian infantry.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 pages 217‚Äì218. However, General Kenneth Stuart, the chief of Canadian Military Headquarters in London had all through the summer of 1944 been downplaying the Canadian losses in France and Italy, and only in late August 1944 did he first start to hint at the truth.Creighton, Donald The Forked Road, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1976 page 92. By the late summer of 1944, the numbers of new recruits were insufficient to replace war casualties in Europe, particularly among the infantry. It was on 22 November 1944, that the Liberal government decided to send to Europe a single contingent of 16,000 home defence draftees trained as infantry men. Further contributing to King's difficulties was the return of Duplessis to power in the Quebec election of 8 August 1944. Duplessis won the election by appealing to anti-Semitic prejudices in Quebec. He claimed, in a violently anti-Semitic speech, that the Dominion government and the government of Premier Godbout had made a secret deal with the \\"International Zionist Brotherhood\\" to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees left homeless by the Holocaust in Quebec after the war in exchange for campaign contributions to both the federal and provincial Liberal parties.Knowles, Valerie Strangers at Our Gates: Canadian Immigration and Immigration Policy, 1540‚Äì2006, Toronto: Dundun Press, 2007 page 149. By contrast, Duplessis claimed that he was not taking any money from the Jews, and if he were elected premier, he would stop this alleged plan to bring Jewish refugees to Quebec. Though Duplessis's story about the alleged plan to settle 100,000 Jewish refugees in Quebec was entirely untrue, his story was widely believed in Quebec, and ensured he won the election. Duplessis was a French-Canadian nationalist opposed to both the war and to sending the \\"Zombies\\" overseas, and with his return to power made King more reluctant to have the \\"Zombies\\" fight at the exact moment when the Canadian Army in Europe was suffering from major manpower shortages. Montreal Daily Star announces the surrender of Germany, May 7, 1945 The crisis began on 19 September 1944 when Major Conn Smythe, the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, who had been invalided out of the Army following the wounds he had taken in France, issued a statement that was published on the front page in The Globe and Mail newspaper charging that infantry replacements in the First Canadian Army were \\"green, inexperienced and poorly trained\\" as the Army hastily sent up cooks and clerks to replace men who had been killed and wounded who were usually swiftly killed or wounded in their turn owing to their inexperience.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 218. Smythe stated the solution was to send the Zombies overseas as they had been training for the last four years or so. Smythe's status as the owner of the Maple Leafs (who with the Montreal Canadiens were the only Canadian NHL teams at the time) meant he was a celebrity in Canada and his letter attracted much media attention. George Drew, the Conservative Premier of Ontario who was already was looking forward to becoming Prime Minister, endorsed Smythe's claims.Henderson, Stephen \\"Angus L. Macdonald and the Conscription Crisis of 1944\\" pages 85-104 from Acadiensis, Volume 27, No. 1, Autumn 1997 page 88. In response, the Defence Minister Colonel James Ralston decided to personally investigate reports of major shortages of infantry by visiting Northwest Europe and Italy.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 308 Upon his return to Ottawa, Ralston informed the Cabinet the situation was far worse than he had been led to believe with front-line infantry regiments so seriously short of manpower that wounded men were being pulled out of the hospitals to go back to the front lines without sufficient time to recover.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 pages 308‚Äì309 The shortages of infantry were especially serious in the French-speaking regiments owing to a lack of volunteers. On 13 October 1944, Ralston telegraphed King from Europe: \\"I regret to say that conditions and prospects of which I have learned will I fear necessitate reassessment in light of the future particularly regarding infantry involving, I fear, grave responsibilities\\". King wrote in his diary that Ralston's cable was \\"an intimation that he was coming back with the intention of making proposals which may involve the whole question of conscription\\".Creighton, Donald The Forked Road, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1976 page 93. King added that sending any conscripts overseas would be a \\"criminal thing\\" that would cause a civil war in Canada, and lead to the United States stepping in to annex Canada. On 19 October Ralston formally informed King of the need for more men in Europe and on 24 October, the matter was first discussed at the Cabinet where the defence minister stated: \\"I feel that there is no alternative but for me to recommend the extension of service of N.R.M.A. personnel overseas\\".Creighton, Donald The Forked Road, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1976 page 94. Ralston informed the Cabinet that in order to continue combat operations, the overseas Canadian Army needed 15,000 new infantrymen immediately, and the only way to find these replacements were from the 60,000 Zombies who at present were guarding the Pacific coast against the unlikely threat of a Japanese invasion and the Atlantic coast from the equally unlikely threat of a German invasion.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 309. Ralston argued that the only alternative to sending the Zombies overseas was to pull the Canadian Army out of the front as otherwise the Army was bleeding to death, which would have been highly humiliating for the Canadian peopleMorton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 219. King objected to Ralston's assessment, stating the Allies would soon win the war so there was no need to send the Zombies overseas, and he could not care less about the problems of shortages of manpower in the overseas Canadian Army.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 309 The cabinet was badly divided on the issue with some ministers supporting Ralston and others King. An additional concern for King was Ralston was from Nova Scotia as were Angus MacDonald, the junior defence minister in charge of the navy and the Finance Minister J.L Ilsley .Henderson, Stephen \\"Angus L. Macdonald and the Conscription Crisis of 1944\\" pages 85-104 from Acadiensis, Volume 27, No. 1, Autumn 1997 page 89. The three politicians from Nova Scotia were all close friends with C.D. Howe commenting that \\"the three Nova Scotians were a sub-cabinet in themselves\\". King was worried that if the three leading ministers from Nova Scotia were to resign together in protest against his conscription policies that it might topple his government, and much of King's time in October 1944 was spent charming MacDonald and Ilsley in an attempt to break up the Nova Scotia triumvirate. Through King felt that MacDonald disliked him for vetoing his plan to send the Royal Canadian Navy ships to the Indian Ocean because it would mean having Canadian ships under British command, he discovered that MacDonald was more conciliatory than he expected with MacDonald concerned about alienating French-Canada from English- Canada. King wrote in his diary: \\"Angus said he saw the difficulties. Was much concerned about everything himself, but Ralston was hard to deal with\\". MacDonald tended to favor bringing conscription if that was necessary to win the war, but if the former Premier of Nova Scotia was widely viewed as a possible future Prime Minister, and MacDonald wanted to avoid another 1917 style split in the Liberal Party, making him ambivalent about where he stood.Henderson, Stephen \\"Angus L. Macdonald and the Conscription Crisis of 1944\\" pages 85-104 from Acadiensis, Volume 27, No. 1, Autumn 1997 pages 86-90. King's first effort at a solution was to ask the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill for a statement that Canada had done more than enough to win the war, and sending the Zombies overseas was unnecessary, a request that Churchill refused. King's next effort at a solution was to fire General Stuart for underreporting Canadian losses in Europe, which did not really resolve the problem, but provided King with a scapegoat.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 pages 217‚Äì219. King himself noted that Ralston and the other ministers supporting sending the Zombies overseas were all from the right-wing of the Liberal Party who also had all opposed his plans for a post-war welfare state, which King decided was evidence of a \\"reactionary conspiracy\\" to bring him down. King was convinced that there was a plot to \\"get me out\\" and that Ralston had provoked the crisis to make himself Prime Minister.Creighton, Donald The Forked Road, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1976 page 95. Further contributing to the crisis with the heavy losses taken by the First Canadian Army in the Battle of the Scheldt, in what was easily the most difficult and bloody battle fought by the Canadians in north-west Europe with, for example, the Black Watch regiment and the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry regiment both suffering 50% causality rates while fighting by the banks of the river Scheldt in October 1944.Copp, Terry & McAndrew, Bill Battle Exhaustion: Soldiers and Psychiatrists in the Canadian Army, 1939‚Äì1945, Montreal: McGill-Queen's Press, 1990 page 142 As more and more Canadians were killed or wounded during the Battle of the Scheldt without anyone to replace them, the survivors were required to do more with less, which imposed major psychological strains on the front-line infantry.Copp, Terry & McAndrew, Bill Battle Exhaustion: Soldiers and Psychiatrists in the Canadian Army, 1939‚Äì1945, Montreal: McGill-Queen's Press, 1990 pages 142-144 Many soldiers were psychologically broken by the stress of the bloody fighting by the Scheldt, falling victim to battle exhaustion as they curled up in a fetal position and refused to move, which made the manpower shortages even worse. Such were the shortages of manpower that the Army refused to provide proper treatment for men suffering from battle exhaustion, giving them the shortest possible period of rest and treatment before sending them back to the front, a policy criticized by the Army's psychiatrists as inhumane.Copp, Terry & McAndrew, Bill Battle Exhaustion: Soldiers and Psychiatrists in the Canadian Army, 1939‚Äì1945, Montreal: McGill-Queen's Press, 1990 page 144 One soldier, Major Ben Dunkelman of the Queen's Own Rifles regiment wrote at the time: \\"We knew why leaves were so scarce. Thanks to Prime Minister Mackenzie King's handling of the Conscription issue at home\\". Another soldier serving in Italy, Brigadier Bill Murphy wrote to his wife: \\"I personally will never cast another Liberal vote as long as King as anything to do with the party. Of the armies in Italy, only that of Canada has no provisions for home leave\\", the reason for which was \\"that there are no men to replace them-except the Zombie Army. And to preserve the Zombies' precious skins the volunteers just have to take it\\". King's paranoia about a plot to force him out was sparked by the fact that the Canadian military had 1.1 million people out of a total population of 11 million serving in their ranks, of whom half had \\"gone active\\", which for him made the inability for the Army to find 15,000 men simply inconceivable. The Canadian historian Desmond Morton wrote that King's question was legitimate, but the answers were far more complex than King's conspiracy theory of certain Liberal cabinet ministers working to oust him in conjunction with the military. The reasons for the shortages of infantry were: *The Royal Canadian Air Force, the most glamorous and relatively luxurious of the three services had attracted far more volunteers than what it needed, which the RCAF had used for its gargantuan air training program, taking away men who could have been used for the Army. *In 1943, over the objections of McNaughton and the rest of the generals, King had sent the I Canadian Corps to Italy while keeping the II Canadian Corps in Britain, thereby as McNaughton had warned requiring two different administrative organizations, which tied up much manpower. *In the summer of 1944, the I Canadian Corps was thrown into an offensive against the Gothic Line without any troops to provide a diversionary attack, and had taken very heavy losses, which occurred just after the bloody Battle of the Liri valley in May 1944. *In spite of having five years to prepare for combat, the II Canadian Corps when it went into action in France was not as well trained as it could have been and thereby suffered heavy casualties owing to this lack of preparations for the test of war. *Likewise despite expectations, Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery commanding the 21st Army Group had failed to win the war in 1944 as he had promised, and by launching Operation Market Garden had allowed the Germans to move the 15th Army into the upper banks of the river Scheldt to make the port of Antwerp unusable. As long as Antwerp was closed, the Allies lacked the necessary deepwater port close to Germany to support an offensive into the Reich. By not securing the Scheldt in September 1944 as Montgomery could have, and instead launching the ill-started Battle of Arnhem, Antwerp, the third-largest port in Europe remained closed, which caused such logistical problems as to shut down the entire Allied advance, ensuring that none of the Allied armies on a line extending from the North Sea to Switzerland could advance deep into Germany in the fall of 1944, ensuring the war would go into 1945. Morton noted that if Montgomery had decided to forego Operation Market Garden and instead cleared the Scheldt, Antwerp would have been opened earlier, making possible offensives by the Allied armies into Germany, which might have ended the war earlier. Furthermore, to open Antwerp required that the II Canadian Corps fight the very bloody and difficult Battle of the Scheldt, where Montgomery had for a time placed the First Canadian Army at the bottom of supply allocations, forcing the Canadians to ration ammunition in the Scheldt. *The Army's system of replacement was based upon the British system developed in North Africa where the Luftwaffe often struck rear troops, leading to more or less equal number of replacements for the infantry, armour, artillery, service corps, engineers, etc. By contrast, in north-west Europe, the Luftwaffe was not a factor, and the Canadian infantry took almost all of the casualties. *Knowing what King had wanted to hear, General Kenneth Stuart had suppressed the news of mounting losses in Europe, which allowed for a mood of complacency to emerge in Ottawa, with King being informed that there were enough volunteers to replace all of the losses in Europe. The French-Canadian ministers in Cabinet, and Quebec in general, did not trust Defence Minister James Ralston, and King felt it was politically sensible to replace him as Minister of National Defence with the anti-conscription General Andrew McNaughton in November 1944.Campbell, John Robinson (1984). James Layton Ralston and manpower for the Canadian army (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University On the morning of 1 November 1944 when the Cabinet met, King who only informed his Quebec lieutenant Louis St. Laurent in advance, suddenly announced that he now accepted Ralston's resignation, which had been submitted back in April 1942.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 220. Given the length of time between Ralston's resignation and King's acceptance meant Ralston had been effectively fired as Defence minister.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 220 King had taken a gamble in firing Ralston as there was always the possibility that the other right-wing Liberal cabinet ministers like C. D. Howe and James Lorimer Ilsley who were also pro- conscription might resign in protest and thereby split the Liberal Party just as the Grits had been split in 1917; much to King's relief, Ralston walked out of the cabinet room alone with no-one following him. Ralston's ally, the navy minister Angus Lewis Macdonald ripped pieces of paper in frustration, but remained seated with the rest of the cabinet.Henderson, T. Stephen Angus L. Macdonald: A Provincial Liberal, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2007 page 135. General McNaughton was a popular and well-respected war hero, though he had been asked to resign as commander of the First Canadian Army in 1943 after his disastrous performance in Operation Spartan war game, though the official story was McNaughton had retired for health reasons. McNaughton was opposed to sending the Zombies overseas and from King's viewpoint had the additional benefit that he and Ralson hated one other. McNaughton believed that he could persuade by the force of his personality enough of the Zombies to go overseas, a policy that failed.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 310 One Zombie was quoted in the press as saying: \\"If Mackenzie King wants me to go overseas, he'll have to send me. I'm damned if I'll volunteer to help out this government\\". McNaughton was unable to produce large numbers of volunteers for the army, although there were numerous volunteers for the navy and air force. The Canadian historians Jack Granatstein and Desmond Morton noted: \\"The news of Ralston's sacking put the conscription crisis on the front pages in screaming headlines. To King's horror and to McNaughton's distress, the publicity created a firestorm of reaction against the once-popular general. Audiences booed and jeered when he tried to rally the country behind the no- conscription policy\\". In Vancouver, General George Pearkes, commanding officer of the Pacific command called a press conference to explain why the Army was asking the Zombies to \\"go active\\", which led to King, who distrusted all of his generals, to write in his diary: \\"These men in uniform have no right to speak in ways that will turn people against civil power\\". Some members of King's cabinet threatened to resign and bring down the government if the Zombies were not sent overseas. Of King's cabinet, James Lorimer Ilsley, C. D. Howe, Angus Lewis Macdonald, Colin W. G. Gibson, Thomas Crerar, and William Pate Mulock were all threatening resignation if King persisted with his current policies.Creighton, Donald The Forked Road, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1976 page 96. On the morning of 22 November 1944, General John Carl Murchie told McNaughton that his policies had failed and hardly any Zombies were volunteering to \\"go active\\", which McNaughton recalled \\"was like a blow to the stomach\\". Later on 22 November 1944, McNaughton telephoned King to say, as he wrote in his diary, \\"The Headquarters staff here had all advised him that the voluntary system would not get the men...It was the most serious advice that could be tended\\". King added that at once \\"there came to mind the statement that I had made to Parliament in June [1942] about the action the government would necessarily take if we were agreed that the time had come when conscription was necessary\\". King chose to misrepresent McNaughton's statement as some sort of military coup d'√©tat, what in his own words was variously a \\"general's revolt\\", a \\"palace revolution\\" and \\"the surrender of civil government to the military\\". Morton wrote Murchie's statement about the failure of McNaughton's recruiting drive was \\"irrefutable\\", writing \\"It was no act of mutiny to tell the truth. Yet to King, the notion of a \\"general's revolt\\" was too useful to ignore. It fitted his view of the military. It superseded the mutiny that really mattered-the imminent resignation of the pro-conscription ministers. It would frighten the anti-conscriptists\\". King's Quebec lieutenant Louis St. Laurent chose to accept \\"this fiction\\" that King was being forced by the military against his will to send the Zombies overseas, but the Air minister Charles \\"Chubby\\" Power would not, resigning in protest at this violation of the government's promises to the people of Quebec. King finally agreed to a one-time levy of 17,000 NRMA conscripts for overseas service in November 1944. Many of the Zombies deserted rather than fight in the war.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 311 As General McNaughton was never elected to the House of Commons, on 23 November 1944, McNaughton had to go to the bar of the House of Commonshttp://parl.canadiana.ca/view/oop.debates_HOC1905_06/1084?r=0&s;=1 to announce 16,000 Zombies were to go overseas if the House gave its approval. When word of the decision reached soldiers stationed in Terrace, British Columbia, it resulted in the short-lived Terrace Mutiny.Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 311. A brigade of Zombies in Terrace mounted guns on the railroad linking Terrace to Prince Rupert and announced that they were now on \\"strike\\" as they had no desire to fight in the war. General George Pearkes headed north to Terrace, and soon restored order by telling the mutineers that the penalty for mutiny was death, but promised if the men laid down their arms, no one would be tried for the mutiny.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 221. The following debates in the House of Commons were very bitter, but on 8 December 1944, a motion of no-confidence in the government was defeated 143 to 70, though 34 Quebec Liberal MPs voted for the motion. The no-confidence vote marked the end of the crisis. Public opinion in Quebec was outraged by sending the NRMA men overseas, but as King had done everything possible to put this off, the political damage was limited.Granatstein, Jack \\"King and Country\\" pages 374-377 from 'International Journal, Volume 24, No. 2, Spring 1969 page 377 Furthermore, of the national parties in Canada, the CCF was too left-wing for Catholic and conservative Quebec while the pro-conscription views of the Conservatives limited their appeal in la belle province, which as King noted at the time meant the Liberals were the only party capable of forming a government that Quebec could vote for. During the Battle of the Scheldt in October‚ÄìNovember 1944, the First Canadian Army had taken such heavy losses and the battle had been so psychologically exhausting for the rest of the men that the First Canadian Army needed a three-month period of rest to recover from the Schedlt, which prevented further losses. Furthermore, the transfer of the I Canadian Corps from Italy to join the II Canadian Corps provided further manpower for First Canadian Army, which now had the task as part of the 21st Army Group starting in February 1945 of advancing into the Netherlands and north-west Germany to secure the left flank of the 2nd British Army as it advanced deep into the Reich. No further combat employment was made until February 1945, when 12,908 men were sent overseas, most of whom were from the home service conscripts drafted under the NRMA, rather than from the general population. Few conscripts saw combat in Europe: only 2463 men reached units on the front lines.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 221 Out of these, 69 lost their lives. Politically, this was a successful gamble for King, as he avoided a drawn-out political crisis and remained in power until his retirement in 1948. However, King's refusal to commit the Zombies to action led to much bitterness among the men who volunteered to \\"go active\\". Farley Mowat recalls in his volumes of war memoirs savagely disliking those who wore the uniform but refused to make the same sacrifices he and his brothers in arms were called on to make in Italy and North-West Europe.Chartrand, Ren√© Canadian Forces In World War II, London: Osprey, 2001 page 15 The \\"Zombies\\" wore a black tie and collared shirts as part of their uniforms while volunteers for overseas duties did not. In April 1945 when the men of the First Canadian Army were informed that henceforth they would now wear the Zombie black tie and collared shirt, Mowat serving with the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment wrote: \\"the black tie itself was known as the Zombie tie, and the resentment of the volunteers, who were now ordered to wear this symbol of shame was most outspoken.\\" ==Postscript to the crisis== In the 1945 election, the Progressive Conservative leader John Bracken proposed conscription for Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Japan, which badly hurt his chances.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 223-224 By contrast, Mackenzie King promised to commit one division, the 6th, to be recruited from veterans still wanting to fight in Japan.Morton, Desmond A Military History of Canada, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart, 1999 page 224 King handily won the election as Canadian public opinion was unwilling to support conscription for a campaign that would cause heavy losses. The invasion of Japan scheduled in two stages for late 1945-early 1946, was widely expected to be a bloody campaign as the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa were the \\"dress rehearsals\\" for the invasion of Japan. Moreover, it was believed the invasion would take at least a year, if not longer. A future conflict seemed foreshadowed when the crew of the Royal Canadian Navy cruiser HMCS Uganda, operating off the coast of Japan, announced that they had only volunteered to \\"go active\\" against Germany and, as they had no desire to \\"go active\\" against Japan, thus forcing the Royal Canadian Navy much to its embarrassment to send the Uganda home in the summer of 1945. A few days later, on 6 August 1945, the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and on 9 August on Nagasaki. On 14 August Emperor Hirohito asked his subjects in a radio address to \\"bear the unbearable\\" (i.e. surrender). The Japanese decision to surrender in August 1945 instead of fighting on to the bitter end as widely expected saved Mackenzie King from what was emerging as a potential new conscription crisis as he was caught between his promises to the United States that Canada would fully commit to the planned invasion of Japan vs. his promises that only volunteers would fight in Japan. ==See also== *Conscription Crisis of 1917 *Conscription in Australia == References == ==Further reading== *Allard, Jean V. \\"M√©moires du G√©n√©ral Jean V.

Rattigan based his story and characters in part on his secret relationship with Kenny Morgan, and the aftermath of the end of their relationship.Sinfield, Alan, Out on Stage: Lesbian and Gay Theatre in the Twentieth Century. Yale University Press (New Haven, Connecticut, US), , p 160 (1999). The play was first performed in London on 6 March 1952, directed by Frith Banbury, and won praise for actress Peggy Ashcroft, who co-starred with Kenneth More. In the US, the Plymouth Theater staged the play in October 1952, with Margaret Sullavan. The play with Sullavan subsequently transferred to Broadway, with its Broadway premiere on 5 November 1953, and running for 132 performances. Various revivals of the play have included: * 1971: Guildford, with Isabel Dean * 1973: Nottingham, with Isabel Dean * 1993: Almeida Theatre, London, with Penelope Wilton and Linus Roache * 1997: Royal Exchange, Manchester with Susan Wooldridge as Hester Collyer and David Fielder as Mr Miller. Directed by Marianne Elliott. * 1998: Roundabout Theatre Company, New York City, with Blythe Danner, Edward Herrmann, and David Conrad * 2003: Richmond Theatre, London, with Harriet Walter, Neil Stacy, Robert Portal and Roger Lloyd-Pack * 2008: Arnaud Theatre, Guildford, with Greta Scacchi, Dugald Bruce-Lockhart, and Simon Williams * 2011: West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, with Maxine Peake and Lex Shrapnel * 2011: Chichester Festival Theatre, with Amanda Root, Anthony Calf and John Hopkins * 2016: National Theatre, London, with Helen McCrory, Peter Sullivan, and Tom Burke Other actresses who have portrayed Hester Collyer include Penelope Keith. Prior to Rattigan's coding of his relationship with Morgan into the heterosexual relationship between Hester and Freddie, his first draft of the play more specifically treated the relationship between the lead characters as a homosexual relationship, and also hinted that the reason for the striking off of Miller, the ex-doctor in the play, from the medical register was Miller's homosexuality.Williams, Tony, 'Wanted for Murder: The Strange Case of Eric Portman', Chapter 10 from Bad: Infamy, Darkness, Evil, and Slime on Screen (Murray Pomerance, editor). State University of New York Press (Albany, New York, US), , p 166 (2004). ==Plot summary== Taking place over the course of one day, the play begins with the discovery of Hester Collyer in her flat by her neighbours, after Hester has failed in an attempt to take her own life by gassing herself. In flashback, some time before, Hester left her husband, Sir William Collyer, a respectable High Court judge, for a semi-alcoholic former RAF pilot, Freddie Page. Their relationship was physical and passionate, but his ardour eventually cooled, leaving her emotionally stranded and desperate. Initially unemployed, Freddie eventually takes a post in South America. The aftershocks of her attempted suicide unravel even the remnants of this relationship. By the end of the day, Hester is brought to a hard decision to live, partly through the intercession of another resident of the tenement house, Mr. Miller, an ex-doctor struck off the register for an undisclosed reason. These two outcasts find a curious kinship. ==Adaptations== A number of adaptations for other media of The Deep Blue Sea have been made. The first, for BBC Television, was broadcast live on 17 and 21 January 1954 in the Sunday Night Theatre strand, with Kenneth More as Freddie, and Googie Withers as Hester. Also, Googie toured Australia and New Zealand in a production presented by JC Williamson Theatres. A further BBC version, in the Play of the Month series was transmitted on 17 March 1974. Directed by Rudolph Cartier, it starred Peter Egan (Freddie), and Virginia McKenna (Hester). The most recent BBC adaptation, in the Performance strand, was transmitted on 12 November 1994, directed by Karel Reisz, with Colin Firth (Freddie Page), Penelope Wilton (Hester Collyer), and Ian Holm (William Collyer). In 2009, BBC Radio Three broadcast a radio adaptation, starring Carolyn Pickles as Hester and Anton Lesser as William Collyer. This was repeated in 2016. A feature film version directed by Anatole Litvak was released in 1955, with More reprising the role of Freddie, and Vivien Leigh as Hester. In 2011, a second feature film adaptation was released, directed by Terence Davies and featuring Rachel Weisz, Tom Hiddleston, and Simon Russell Beale. The 2016 National Theatre version of the play was filmed and shown live in cinemas worldwide on 1 September 2016 as part of National Theatre Live. This filmed performance was made available for one week on YouTube in July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic as part of National Theatre At Home. ==References== ==External links== * Hannah Giles, 'Brief Encounter With ...

Rauschenberg is well known for his Combines (1954-1964), a group of artworks which incorporated everyday objects as art materials and which blurred the distinctions between painting and sculpture. Rauschenberg was both a painter and a sculptor, but he also worked with photography, printmaking, papermaking and performance. Rauschenberg received numerous awards during his nearly 60-year artistic career. Among the most prominent were the International Grand Prize in Painting at the 32nd Venice Biennale in 1964 and the National Medal of Arts in 1993.Lifetime Honors - National Medal of Arts Rauschenberg lived and worked in New York City and on Captiva Island, Florida, until his death on May 12, 2008. ==Life and career== Rauschenberg was born Milton Ernest Rauschenberg in Port Arthur, Texas, the son of Dora Carolina (n√©e Matson) and Ernest R. Rauschenberg.Rauschenberg's Roots, Theind, 2005 His father worked for Gulf States Utilities, a light and power company. His parents were Fundamentalist Christians. He had a younger sister named Janet Begneaud. At 18, Rauschenberg was admitted to the University of Texas at Austin where he began studying pharmacology, but he dropped out shortly after due to the difficulty of the coursework‚Äînot realizing at this point that he is dyslexic‚Äîand his unwillingness to dissect a frog in biology class.Patricia Burstein (May 19, 1980), In His Art and Life, Robert Rauschenberg Is a Man Who Steers His Own Daring Course People. He was drafted into the United States Navy in 1944. Based in California, he served as a neuropsychiatric technician in a Navy hospital until his discharge in 1945 or 1946. Rauschenberg subsequently studied at the Kansas City Art Institute and the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris,https://www.waddingtoncustot.com/artists/53-robert- rauschenberg/biography/ France, where he met fellow art student Susan Weil. In 1948 Rauschenberg joined Weil in enrolling at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. At Black Mountain, Rauschenberg sought out Josef Albers, a founder of the Bauhaus in Germany, whom he had read about in an August 1948 issue of Time magazine. He hoped that Albers' rigorous teaching methods might curb his habitual sloppiness. Albers' preliminary design courses relied on strict discipline that did not allow for any \\"uninfluenced experimentation.\\"Josef Albers, quoted in Martin Duberman, Black Mountain: An Exploration in Community (New York: W. W. Norton, 1993), p. 56. Rauschenberg became, in his own words, \\"Albers' dunce, the outstanding example of what he was not talking about\\". Although Rauschenberg considered Albers his most important teacher, he found a more compatible sensibility in John Cage, an established composer of avant- garde music. Like Rauschenberg, Cage had moved away from the disciplinarian teachings of his instructor, Arnold Sch√∂nberg, in favor of a more experimentalist approach to music. Cage provided Rauschenberg with much-needed support and encouragement during the early years of his career, and the two remained friends and artistic collaborators for decades to follow. From 1949 to 1952 Rauschenberg studied with Vaclav Vytlacil and Morris Kantor at the Art Students League of New York, where he met fellow artists Knox Martin and Cy Twombly.Walter Hopps, Robert Rauschenberg: The Early 1950s, Rauschenberg married Susan Weil in the summer of 1950 at the Weil family home in Outer Island, Connecticut. Their only child, Christopher, was born July 16, 1951. The two separated in June 1952 and divorced in 1953. Thereafter, Rauschenberg had romantic relationships with fellow artists Cy Twombly and Jasper Johns, among others. His partner for the last 25 years of his life was artist Darryl Pottorf,Ella Nayor,\\"The Pine Island Eagle, \\"Bob Rauschenberg, art giant, dead at 82\\", May 13, 2008 his former assistant. ==Death== Rauschenberg died on May 12, 2008, on Captiva Island, Florida. ==Artistic contribution== Rauschenberg's approach was sometimes called \\"Neo-Dadaist,\\" a label he shared with the painter Jasper Johns. Rauschenberg famously stated that ‚Äúpainting relates to both art and life,‚Äù and he wanted to work \\"in the gap between the two.‚ÄùRauschenberg, Robert; Miller, Dorothy C. (1959). Sixteen Americans [exhibition]. New York: Museum of Modern Art. p. 58. . OCLC 748990996. ‚ÄúPainting relates to both art and life. Neither can be made. (I try to act in that gap between the two.)‚Äù Like many of his Dadaist predecessors, Rauschenberg questioned the distinction between art objects and everyday objects, and his use of readymade materials reprised the intellectual issues raised by Marcel Duchamp‚Äôs Fountain (1917). Duchamp‚Äôs Dadaist influence can also be observed in Jasper Johns‚Äô paintings of targets, numerals, and flags, which were familiar cultural symbols: ‚Äúthings the mind already knows.‚ÄùHis heart belongs to DADA, Time 73, 4 May 1959: 58; as quoted in Jasper Johns, Writings, Sketchbook Notes, Interviews, ed. Kirk Varnedoe, Moma New York, 1996. ‚ÄúIt all began with my painting a picture of an American flag. Using this design took care of a great deal for me because I didn't have to design it. So I want on to similar things like the targets things the mind already knows. That gave me room to work on other levels. For instance, I've always thought of a painting as a surface; painting it in one color made this very clear‚Ä¶ A picture ought to be looked at the same way you look at a radiator.‚Äù p. 82.Robert Rauschenberg, Riding Bikes, 1998, Berlin, GermanyAt Black Mountain College, Rauschenberg experimented with a variety of artistic mediums including printmaking, drawing, photography, painting, sculpture, and theatre; his works often featured some combination of these. He created his Night Blooming paintings (1951) at Black Mountain by pressing pebbles and gravel into black pigment on canvas. From the fall of 1952 to the spring of 1953, Rauschenberg traveled in Italy and North Africa with his fellow artist and partner Cy Twombly. There, he created collages and small sculptures, including the Scatole Personali and Feticci Personali, out of found materials. He exhibited them at galleries in Rome and Florence. To Rauschenberg's surprise, a number of the works sold; many that did not he threw into the river Arno, following the suggestion of an art critic who reviewed his show.Holland Cotter (June 28, 2012), Robert Rauschenberg: 'North African Collages and Scatole Personali, c. 1952' New York Times. Upon his return to New York City in 1953, Rauschenberg began creating sculpture with found materials from his Lower Manhattan neighborhood, such as scrap metal, wood, and twine. Throughout the 1950s, Rauschenberg supported himself by designing storefront window displays for Tiffany & Co. and Bonwit Teller, first with Susan Weil and later in partnership with Jasper Johns under the pseudonym Matson Jones. In a famously cited incident of 1953, Rauschenberg requested a drawing from the Abstract Expressionist painter Willem de Kooning for the express purpose of erasing it as an artistic statement. This conceptual work, titled Erased de Kooning Drawing, was executed with the elder artist's consent. In 1961, Rauschenberg explored a similar conceptual approach by presenting an idea as the artwork itself. He was invited to participate in an exhibition at the Galerie Iris Clert in Paris, where artists were to present portraits of Clert, the gallery owner. Rauschenberg's submission consisted of a telegram declaring \\"This is a portrait of Iris Clert if I say so.\\" By 1962, Rauschenberg's paintings were beginning to incorporate not only found objects but found images as well. After a visit to Andy Warhol‚Äôs studio that year, Rauschenberg began using a silkscreen process, usually reserved for commercial means of reproduction, to transfer photographs to canvas.Thomas Crow, ‚ÄúSocial Register,‚Äù Artforum (New York) 47, no. 1 (Sept. 2008), pp. 426‚Äì29. The silkscreen paintings made between 1962 and 1964 led critics to identify Rauschenberg's work with Pop art. Rauschenberg had experimented with technology in his artworks since the making of his early Combines in the mid-1950s, where he sometimes used working radios, clocks, and electric fans as sculptural materials. He later explored his interest in technology while working with Bell Laboratories research scientist Billy Kl√ºver. Together they realized some of Rauschenberg's most ambitious technology-based experiments, such as Soundings (1968), a light installation which responded to ambient sound. In 1966, Kl√ºver and Rauschenberg officially launched Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), a non-profit organization established to promote collaborations between artists and engineers.Kristine Stiles & Peter Selz, Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 453 Robert Rauschenberg, Untitled, 1963, oil, silkscreen, metal, and plastic on canvas In 1969, NASA invited Rauschenberg to witness the launch of Apollo 11. In response to this landmark event, Rauschenberg created his Stoned Moon Series of lithographs. This involved combining diagrams and other images from NASA's archives with his own drawings and handwritten text.Craig F. Starr Associates, New York, Robert Rauschenberg: Stoned Moon 1969‚Äì70, May 30‚ÄìJuly 26. Exh. cat. with essay (ca. 1970) by Michael Crichton. From 1970, Rauschenberg worked from his home and studio in Captiva, Florida. The first works he created in his new studio were Cardboards (1971‚Äì72) and Early Egyptians (1973‚Äì74), for which he relied on locally sourced materials such as cardboard and sand. Where his previous works had often highlighted urban imagery and materials, Rauschenberg now favored the effect of natural fibers found in fabric and paper. He printed on textiles using his solvent-transfer technique to make the Hoarfrost (1974‚Äì76) and Spread (1975‚Äì82) series; the latter featured large stretches of collaged fabric on wood panels. Rauschenberg created his Jammer (1975‚Äì76) series using colorful fabrics inspired by his trip to Ahmedabad, India, a city famous for its textiles. The imageless simplicity of the Jammer series is a striking contrast with the image-filled Hoarfrosts and the grittiness of his earliest works made in New York City. International travel became a central part of Rauschenberg's artistic process after 1975. In 1984, Rauschenberg announced the start of his Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange (ROCI) at the United Nations. Almost entirely funded by the artist, the ROCI project consisted of a seven-year tour to ten countries around the world. Rauschenberg took photographs in each location and made artworks inspired by the cultures he visited. The resulting works were displayed in a local exhibition in each country. Rauschenberg often donated an artwork to a local cultural institution.Ikegami, Hiroko. The Great Migrator: Robert Rauschenberg and the Global Rise of American Art. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2010. Beginning in the mid 1980s, Rauschenberg focused on silkscreening imagery onto a variety of differently treated metals, such as steel and mirrored aluminum. He created many series of so-called ‚Äúmetal paintings,‚Äù including: Borealis (1988‚Äì92),Dr. Corinna Thierolf, \\"Robert Rauschenberg: Borealis 1988-92\\" (Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac: 2019). Urban Bourbons (1988-1996), Phantoms (1991), and Night Shades (1991). In addition, throughout the 1990s, Rauschenberg continued to utilize new materials while still working with more rudimentary techniques. As part of his engagement with the latest technological innovations, in his late painting series he transferred digital inkjet photographic images to a variety of painting supports. For his Arcadian Retreats (1996) he transferred imagery to wet fresco. In keeping with his commitment to the environment, Rauschenberg used biodegradable dyes and pigments, and water rather than chemicals in the transfer process.Robert Rauschenberg Guggenheim Collection. ===The White Paintings, black paintings, and Red Paintings=== In 1951 Rauschenberg created his White Painting series in the tradition of monochromatic painting established by Kazimir Malevich, who reduced painting to its most essential qualities for an experience of aesthetic purity and infinity. The White Paintings were shown at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery in New York in fall 1953. Rauschenberg used everyday white house paint and paint rollers to create smooth, unembellished surfaces which at first appear as blank canvas. Instead of perceiving them to be without content, however, John Cage described the White Paintings as \\"airports for the lights, shadows and particles\\"; surfaces which reflected delicate atmospheric changes in the room. Rauschenberg himself said that they were affected by ambient conditions, \\"so you could almost tell how many people are in the room.\\" Like the White Paintings, the black paintings of 1951-1953 were executed on multiple panels and were predominantly single color works. Rauschenberg applied matte and glossy black paint to textured grounds of newspaper on canvas, occasionally allowing the newspaper to remain visible. By 1953 Rauschenberg had moved from the White Painting and black painting series to the heightened expressionism of his Red Painting series. He regarded red as \\"the most difficult color\\" with which to paint, and accepted the challenge by dripping, pasting, and squeezing layers of red pigment directly onto canvas grounds that included patterned fabric, newspaper, wood, and nails. The complex material surfaces of the Red Paintings were forerunners of Rauschenberg's well-known Combine series (1954-1964). ===Combines=== Rauschenberg collected discarded objects on the streets of New York City and brought them back to his studio where he integrated them into his work. He claimed he \\"wanted something other than what I could make myself and I wanted to use the surprise and the collectiveness and the generosity of finding surprises. [...] So the object itself was changed by its context and therefore it became a new thing.\\" Rauschenberg's comment concerning the gap between art and life provides the departure point for an understanding of his contributions as an artist. He saw the potential beauty in almost anything; he once said, \\"I really feel sorry for people who think things like soap dishes or mirrors or Coke bottles are ugly, because they're surrounded by things like that all day long, and it must make them miserable.\\" His Combine series endowed everyday objects with a new significance by bringing them into the context of fine art alongside traditional painting materials. The Combines eliminated the boundaries between art and sculpture so that both were present in a single work of art. While \\"Combines\\" technically refers to Rauschenberg's work from 1954 to 1964, Rauschenberg continued to utilize everyday objects such as clothing, newspaper, urban debris, and cardboard throughout his artistic career. Robert Rauschenberg, Canyon, 1959, Combine paintingRobert Rauschenberg, Rhyme, 1956, Combine painting His transitional pieces that led to the creation of Combines were Charlene (1954) and Collection (1954/1955), where he collaged objects such as scarves, electric light bulbs, mirrors, and comic strips. Although Rauschenberg had implemented newspapers and patterned textiles in his black paintings and Red Paintings, in the Combines he gave everyday objects a prominence equal to that of traditional painting materials. Considered one of the first of the Combines, Bed (1955) was created by smearing red paint across a well-worn quilt, sheet, and pillow. The work was hung vertically on the wall like a traditional painting. Because of the intimate connections of the materials to the artist's own life, Bed is often considered to be a self-portrait and a direct imprint of Rauschenberg's interior consciousness. Some critics suggested the work could be read as a symbol for violence and rape, but Rauschenberg described Bed as ‚Äúone of the friendliest pictures I‚Äôve ever painted.‚ÄùTomkins, Calvin (Feb. 29, 1964). \\"Profiles: Moving Out\\". The New Yorker 40, no. 2. p. 64. Among his most famous Combines are those that incorporate taxidermied animals, such as Monogram (1955-1959) which includes a stuffed angora goat, and Canyon (1959), which features a stuffed golden eagle. Although the eagle was salvaged from the trash, Canyon drew government ire due to the 1940 Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.The New York Times, \\"MArt's Sale Value? Zero. The Tax Bill? $29 Million, A Catch-22 of Art and Taxes, Starring a Stuffed Eagle\\" by Cohen, Patricia, July 22, 2012. Critics originally viewed the Combines in terms of their formal qualities: color, texture, and composition. The formalist view of the 1960s was later refuted by critic Leo Steinberg, who said that each Combine was ‚Äúa receptor surface on which objects are scattered, on which data is entered.\\"Steinberg, Leo (1972). Other criteria: Confrontations with twentieth-century art. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 90. . According to Steinberg, the horizontality of what he called Rauschenberg's \\"flatbed picture plane\\" had replaced the traditional verticality of painting, and subsequently allowed for the uniquely material-bound surfaces of Rauschenberg's work. ===Performance and dance=== Rauschenberg began exploring his interest in dance after moving to New York in the early 1950s. He was first exposed to avant-garde dance and performance art at Black Mountain College, where he participated in John Cage's Theatre Piece No. 1 (1952), often considered the first Happening. He began designing sets, lighting, and costumes for Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor. In the early 1960s he was involved in the radical dance-theater experiments at Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, and he choreographed his first performance, Pelican (1963), for the Judson Dance Theater in May 1963.Glueck, Grace. ‚ÄúBallet: Brides and Turtles in Dance Program.‚Äù New York Times, May 13, 1965, p. 33. Rauschenberg was close friends with Cunningham-affiliated dancers including Carolyn Brown, Viola Farber, and Steve Paxton, all of whom featured in his choreographed works. Rauschenberg's full-time connection to the Merce Cunningham Dance Company ended following its 1964 world tour.Alastair Macaulay (May 14, 2008), Rauschenberg and Dance, Partners for Life New York Times In 1966, Rauschenberg created the Open Score performance for part of 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering at the 69th Regiment Armory, New York. The series was instrumental in the formation of Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.). In 1977 Rauschenberg, Cunningham, and Cage reconnected as collaborators for the first time in thirteen years to create Travelogue (1977), for which Rauschenberg contributed the costume and set designs. Rauschenberg did not choreograph his own works after 1967, but he continued to collaborate with other choreographers, including Trisha Brown, for the remainder of his artistic career. ===Commissions=== Throughout his career, Rauschenberg designed numerous posters in support of causes that were important to him. In 1965, when Life magazine commissioned him to visualize a modern Inferno, he did not hesitate to vent his rage at the Vietnam War and other contemporary sociopolitical issues, including racial violence, neo-Nazism, political assassinations, and ecological disaster. On December 30, 1979 the Miami Herald printed 650,000 copies of Tropic, its Sunday magazine, with a cover designed by Rauschenberg. In 1983, he won a Grammy Award for his album design of Talking Heads' album Speaking in Tongues.Richard Lacayo (May 15, 2008), Robert Rauschenberg: The Wild and Crazy Guy Time. In 1986 Rauschenberg was commissioned by BMW to paint a full size BMW 635 CSi for the sixth installment of the famed BMW Art Car Project. Rauschenberg's car was the first in the project to feature reproductions of works from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, as well as his own photographs. In 1998, the Vatican commissioned a work by Rauschenberg in honor of the Jubilee year 2000 to be displayed in the Padre Pio Liturgical Hall, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy. Working around the theme of the Last Judgement, Rauschenberg created The Happy Apocalypse (1999), a twenty-foot-long maquette. It was ultimately rejected by the Vatican on the grounds that Rauschenberg's depiction of God as a satellite dish was an inappropriate theological reference.Mario Codognato and Mirta d‚ÄôArgenzio, ‚ÄúInterview with Robert Rauschenberg,‚Äù in Rauschenberg, exh. cat.

In 1953, Eleanor Ward invited Rauschenberg to participate in a joint exhibition with Cy Twombly at the Stable Gallery. In his second solo exhibition in New York at the Charles Egan Gallery in 1954, Rauschenberg presented his Red Paintings (1953-1953) and Combines (1954-1964).Stuart Preston, New York Times, December 19, 1954 Leo Castelli mounted a solo exhibition of Rauschenberg's Combines in 1958.

In 1964 he became one of the first American artists to win the International Grand Prize in Painting at the Venice Biennale (Mark Tobey and James Whistler had previously won painting prizes in 1895 and 1958 respectively). A mid-career retrospective was organized by the National Collection of Fine Arts (now the Smithsonian American Art Museum), Washington, D.C., and traveled throughout the United States between 1976 and 1978.National Collection of Fine Arts (U.S.); Rauschenberg, Robert; Alloway, Lawrence; Museum of Modern Art (New York, N.Y.); San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Art Institute of Chicago; Albright-Knox Art Gallery, eds.

The Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange (ROCI) began in 1984 as an effort to spark international dialogue and enhance cultural understanding through artistic expression. A ROCI exhibition went on view at the National Gallery of Art, D.C., in 1991,National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., Rauschenberg Overseas Culture Interchange, May 12‚ÄìSept. 2, 1991. Exh. cat. with introduction by Jack Cowart; essay by Rosetta Brooks; interview with Rauschenberg by Donald Saff; previously published essays by Jos√© Donoso, Roberto Fern√°ndez Retamar, and Yevgeny Yevtushenko; previously published texts by Heiner M√ºller and Wu Zuguang; previously published statement by Rauschenberg; and previously published poems by Laba Pingcuo and Octavio Paz. concluding a ten-country tour: Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, China, Tibet, Japan, Cuba, U.S.S.R., Germany, and Malaysia. In 1970, Rauschenberg created a program called Change, Inc., to award one-time emergency grants of up to $1,000 to visual artists based on financial need. In 1990, Rauschenberg created the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation (RRF) to promote awareness of the causes he cared about, such as world peace, the environment and humanitarian issues. In 1986, Rauschenberg received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts by President Bill Clinton in 1993. In 2000, Rauschenberg was honored with amfAR's Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS.Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. RRF today owns many works by Rauschenberg from every period of his career. In 2011, the foundation presented The Private Collection of Robert Rauschenberg in collaboration with Gagosian Gallery, featuring selections from Rauschenberg's personal art collection. Proceeds from the exhibition helped fund the foundation's philanthropic activities.The Private Collection of Robert Rauschenberg, November 3 - December 23, 2011 Gagosian Gallery. Also in 2011, the foundation launched its \\"Artist as Activist\\" project and invited artist Shepard Fairey to focus on an issue of his choice. The editioned work he made was sold to raise funds for the Coalition for the Homeless.Cristina Ruiz (28 March 2012), Rauschenberg's foundation could outspend Warhol's The Art Newspaper. RRF continues to support emerging artists and arts organizations with grants and philanthropic collaborations each year. The RRF has several residency programs that take place at the foundation's headquarters in New York and at the late artist's property in Captiva Island, Florida. ==Art market== In 2010 Studio Painting (1960‚Äë61), one of Rauschenberg's Combines originally estimated at $6 million to $9 million, was bought from the collection of Michael Crichton for $11 million at Christie's, New York.Carol Vogel (May 12, 2010), At Christie's, a $28.6 Million Bid Sets a Record for Johns New York Times. In 2019, Christie's sold the silkscreen painting Buffalo II (1964) for $88.8 million, shattering the artist's previous record. ===Lobbying for artists' resale royalties=== In the early 1970s, Rauschenberg lobbied U.S. Congress to pass a bill that would compensate artists when their work is resold on the secondary market. Rauschenberg took up his fight for artist resale royalties after the taxi baron Robert Scull sold part of his collection of Abstract Expressionist and Pop art works for $2.2 million. Scull had originally purchased Rauschenberg's paintings Thaw (1958) and Double Feature (1959) for $900 and $2,500 respectively; roughly a decade later Scull sold the pieces for $85,000 and $90,000 in a 1973 auction at Sotheby Parke Bernet in New York.Patricia Cohen (November 1, 2011), Artists File Lawsuits, Seeking Royalties New York Times.

It is about three miles northwest of Madron. It is also known locally as the \\"Crick Stone\\". ==Location== The M√™n-an-Tol stands near the Madron to Morvah road in Cornwall. Other antiquities in the vicinity include the M√™n Scryfa inscribed stone about 300 metres to the north and the Boskednan stone circle less than 1 kilometre to the northeast. ==Etymology== The name Men an Toll in Cornish means \\"the stone of the hole\\". ==Description== The M√™n-an-Tol consists of three upright granite stones: a round stone with its middle holed out with two standing stones to each side, in front of and behind the hole. When seen at an angle from one side, the stones form a three- dimensional \\"101\\". The two side stones are both about 1.2 metres high. The westernmost stone was moved and brought into a straight line with the other two stones sometime after 1815.MEN AN TOL, Pastscape, retrieved 9 November 2013 The holed stone is roughly octagonal in outline. It is 1.3 metres wide and 1.1 metres high; the circular hole is 0.5 m in diameter. The only other holed stone in Cornwall of this type is the Tolvan holed stone which can be seen in a garden near Helston. There is one other standing stone nearby, and six recumbent stones, some of which are buried. A cairn exists as a low stony mound just to the southeast. There are two other early Bronze Age barrows or cairns between 120 and 150 metres to the north. ==Interpretation== The M√™n-an- Tol is thought to date to either the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age. The holed stone could originally have been a natural occurrence rather than deliberately sculpted. The distribution of the stones around the site has led to the suggestion that the monument is actually part of a stone circle. If so, then it is likely that the stones have been rearranged at some point, and the two standing stones either side of the holed stone may have been moved from their original positions. It has also been suggested that the holed stone could have been a capstone for the nearby cairn before being moved to its present position. ==History== Drawing and plan by W. Borlase, 1769 Drawing by J. T. Blight, 1864 In 1749 the site was first archaeologically investigated by William Borlase, who also drew a plan. This shows that the megaliths were not in a line like today, but formed an angle of about 135¬∞. Borlase also reported that farmers had taken away some stones from the area. From him comes the first written record of the myths and rituals.William Borlase, (1769), Antiquities Historical and Monumental of the County of Cornwall, Bowyer and Nichols, London In the 19th Century the local antiquary John Thomas Blight published several drawings of the site, and made the first suggestion that the stones could be the remains of a stone circle.John Thomas Blight, (1864), A week at the Land's End, 1861, Churches of West Cornwall In 1872 William Copeland Borlase, a descendant of the earlier Borlase, gave a more detailed description of the area.William Copeland Borlase, (1872), Naenia Cornubiae, Longmans In 1932 Hugh O'Neill Hencken wrote the first modern archaeological report. He believed that the position of the stones was not the prehistoric arrangement, but had been significantly changed. He also thought that the holed stone might be part of a destroyed tomb. He was even told that local farmers with back or limb complaints would crawl through the hole to relieve their pain.Hugh O'Neill Hencken, (1932), The Archaeology of Cornwall and Scilly, Metheun In 1993, the Cornwall Historic Environment Service published a detailed report with the latest research results. They suggested that the standing stones originated from a stone circle which consisted of 18 to 20 stones. The holed stone, however, could be part of a nearby portal tomb. It also possible that the holed stone stood at the center of the stone circle and served to frame specific points on the horizon. Such a use of a holed stone is not known in other sites,Ann Preston-Jones, (1993), The Men-an-Tol. Management and Survey, Historic Environment Service, Cornwall County Council although the nearby stone circle of Boscawen-Un does have a central standing stone. ==In folklore== A view through the M√™n-an-Tol holed stone M√™n-an-Tol is supposed to have a fairy or piskie guardian who can make miraculous cures. In one story, a changeling baby was put through the stone in order for the mother to get the real child back. Evil piskies had changed her child, and the ancient stones were able to reverse their evil spell.Evans-Wentz, W. Y. (1911) The Fairy- Faith in Celtic Countries. London: H. Frowde (Reprinted 1981 by Colin Smythe. ) p. 179 Local legend claims that if at full moon a woman passes through the holed stone seven times backwards, she will soon become pregnant. Another legend is that passage through the stone will cure a child of rickets (osteomalacia). For centuries, children with rickets were passed naked through the hole in the middle stone nine times. == Popular culture == Many of the visitors to M√™n-an-Tol have their photograph taken placing their heads through the central hole. The Cornish poet D. M. Thomas referred to M√™n-an-Tol as \\"the wind's vagina\\". The song \\"Men-An-Tol\\" appears on the Zeitgeist album by the Levellers. The Men-An-Tol also features prominently in the novel The Little Country by Charles de Lint. \\"M√©n-An-Tol\\" is the name of a level in the 2017 game Monument Valley 2. \\"M√©n-An-Tol\\" is a song on the 2018 album The Four Worlds by Mark Pritchard == References == == External links == * The M√™n-an- Tol at Megalithia.com * Men-An-Tol site page on The Megalithic Portal * Men- An-Tol site page on The Modern Antiquarian * Legends of Cornwall's Stones, Gareth Evans, 2005 * Men-an-Tol at Historic Cornwall Category:Bronze Age sites in Cornwall Category:Megalithic monuments in England Category:Penwith Category:Tourist attractions in Cornwall Category:Stone Age sites in Cornwall ","title":"M√™n-an-Tol"},{"id":"306191","text":"Vineland is a 1990 novel by Thomas Pynchon, a postmodern fiction set in California, United States in 1984, the year of Ronald Reagan's reelection.Knabb 2002 Through flashbacks by its characters, who have lived the sixties in their youth, the story accounts for the free spirit of rebellion of that decade, and describes the traits of the \\"fascistic Nixonian repression\\" and its War on Drugs that clashed with it; and it articulates the slide and transformation that occurred in U.S. society from the 1960s to the 1980s.Vineland, p.71Patell (2001) p.129 == Plot == The story is set in California, United States, in 1984, the year of Ronald Reagan's reelection. After a scene in which former hippie Zoyd Wheeler dives through a window, something he is required to do yearly to keep receiving mental disability checks, the action of the novel opens with the resurfacing of federal agent Brock Vond, who (through a platoon of agents) forces Zoyd and his 14-year-old daughter Prairie out of their house. They hide from Brock, and from Hector Zu√±iga (a drug-enforcement federale from Zoyd's past, who Zoyd suspects is in cahoots with Brock) with old friends of Zoyd's, who recount to the mystified Prairie the story of Brock's motivation for what he has done. This hinges heavily on Frenesi Gates, Prairie's mother, whom she has never met. In the '60s, during the height of the hippie era, the fictive College of the Surf (located in equally fictive Trasero County, said to be located between Orange County and San Diego County in Southern California) seceded from the United States and became its own nation of hippies and dope smokers, called the People's Republic of Rock and Roll (PR¬≥). Brock Vond, a federal prosecutor, intends to bring down PR¬≥, and finds a willing accomplice in Frenesi. She is a member of 24fps, a militant film collective (other members of which are the people telling Prairie their story in the present), that seeks to document the \\"fascists'\\" transgressions against freedom and hippie ideals. Frenesi is uncontrollably attracted to Brock and the sex he provides, and ends up working as a double agent to bring about the killing of the de facto leader of PR¬≥, Weed Atman (a mathematics professor who accidentally became the subject of a cult of personality). Her betrayal caused Frenesi to flee, and she has been living in witness protection with Brock's help up until the present day. Now she has disappeared. The membership of 24fps, Brock Vond, and Hector Zu√±iga are all searching for her, for their various motives. The book's theme of the ubiquity of television (or the Tube) comes to a head when Hector, a Tube addict who has actually not been working with Brock, finds funding to create his pet project of a movie telling the story of the depraved sixties, with Frenesi Gates as the director, and the pomp and circumstance surrounding this big-money deal create a net of safety that allows Frenesi to come out of hiding. 24fps finds her and achieves their goal of allowing Prairie to meet her, at an enormous reunion of Frenesi's family. Weed Atman is also present at the reunion as one of many Thanatoids in the book‚Äîpeople who are in a state that is \\"like death, but different.\\" Brock, nearly omnipotent with D.E.A. funds, finds Prairie with a surveillance helicopter, and tries to snatch her up to get to Frenesi, but while he is hovering above her on a ladder, the government abruptly cuts all his funding due to a loss of interest in funding the war on drugs because people have begun playing along willingly with the antidrug ideal, and his helicopter pilot flies him away. Later he tries to come after Prairie and Frenesi again, but is killed when he crashes his helicopter. The family reunion allows everyone to tie up all their loose ends, and the book ends with Prairie looking into the beginning of a life no longer controlled by the fall-out of the past. == Technique == Throughout the novel, Pynchon's technique is recognizable. From a cameo of Mucho Maas (from The Crying of Lot 49) to a bizarre episode hinting at Godzilla, Pynchon's \\"zaniness\\" pervades the novel. For example, Pynchon laces the book with Star Trek references. He has his characters watch a sitcom named Say, Jim, about a starship all of whose officers \\"were black except for the Communications Officer, a freckled white redhead named Lieutenant O'Hara.\\" The numerous references to films rigorously include the year of release in a manner unusual for a work of fiction. Several characters are Thanatoids, victims of a particular karmic imbalance. In addition, the novel is replete with female ninjas, astrologers, marijuana smokers, television addicts, musical interludes (including the theme song of The Smurfs) and metaphors drawn from Star Trek. ==Critical reception== Vineland received mixed reviews. Author Tobias Meinel asserted in a 2013 essay that the novel \\"has led many critics to focus on its shift in style and content and to read it either as 'Pynchon Lite' or as a critical commentary on contemporary American culture.\\" Salman Rushdie wrote a positive review in The New York Times following the book's 1990 release, praising it as \\"free-flowing and light and funny and maybe the most readily accessible piece of writing the old Invisible Man ever came up with.\\" He called it \\"that rarest of birds\\" that, \\"at the end of the Greed Decade,\\" is \\"a major political novel about what America has been doing to itself, to its children, all these many years.\\" Although he praised Pynchon's light-yet- deadly touch at tackling the nightmares of the present rather than the past, Rushdie acknowledged that the book \\"either grabs you or it doesn't.\\" British literary critic Frank Kermode was disappointed by the book, feeling that it lacked the \\"beautiful ontological suspense\\" of The Crying of Lot 49 or the \\"extended fictive virtuosity\\" of Gravity's Rainbow. He did acknowledge that it was \\"recognisably from the same workshop\\" as Pynchon's previous outings but found it to be more incomprehensible. Brad Leithauser concurred, writing in The New Yorker that Vineland was \\"a loosely packed grab bag of a book\\" that recalled what was weakest about the author's canon and failed to extend or improve upon it. In the Chicago Tribune, James McManus posited that while inveterate Pynchon readers likely would unfavorably compare the book to Gravity's Rainbow, it was a manageable book with strong prose that succeeded as an arch and blackly amusing assault on the desires of Republican America. Film critic Terrence Rafferty admired the novel, and in The New Yorker called it \\"the oldest story in the world--the original sin and the exile from Paradise,\\"Cowart, David. but author Sean Carswell later contended that aside from Rafferty and Rushdie, initial reviews of Vineland \\"run the gamut from slightly miffed to outright hostile.\\"Carswell, Sean. Edward Mendelson's review in The New Republic was mostly positive, however; although he found the plot to be tangled and tedious, he praised Pynchon's \\"intellectual and imaginative energy\\" and called the work \\"a visionary tale\\" whose world was \\"richer and more various than the world of almost any American novel in recent memory.\\" He also commended the book's \\"comic extravagance,\\" claiming that \\"no other American writer moves so smoothly and swiftly between the extremes of high and low style.\\" Mendelson additionally noted that Vineland was more integrated with its emotions and feelings than Pynchon's previous novels, and Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote in the Chicago Reader that it was the author's most hopeful work yet. That hopefulness was also mentioned by Rushdie, who believed that the book suggested community, individuality, and family as counterweights to the repressive Nixon-Reagan era, but Dan Geddes opined in 2005 in The Satirist that the book's \\"happy ending\\" was surprising, given its overarching warning about a growing police state. Contrarily, Rushdie found that the shocking final scene lent itself to a morally ambiguous ending, and he felt that the novel expertly held a balance between light and dark throughout its entire duration. == Notes == ==References== *Ken Knabb (2002) Raptor, Rapist, Rapture: The Dark Joys of Social Control in Thomas Pynchon's Vineland *Patell, Cyrus R.

Angela Bennett is a systems analyst in Venice, California who telecommutes to Cathedral Software in San Francisco. Her interpersonal relationships are almost completely online and on the phone, with the exception of forgettable interactions with her neighbors and visits to her mother, who is institutionalized with Alzheimer's disease and often forgets who Bennett is. Bennett's co-worker Dale sends her a floppy disk with a backdoor labeled \\"œÄ\\" that permits access to a commonly used computer security system called \\"Gatekeeper\\" sold by Gregg Microsystems, a software company led by CEO Jeff Gregg. Dale and Bennett agree to meet, but the navigation system in Dale's private aircraft malfunctions and it crashes into a tower, killing him. Bennett travels to Cozumel, on vacation, where she meets Jack Devlin. After seducing Bennett, Devlin pays a mugger to steal her purse as they walk along the beach. He chases the mugger into the foliage, catches the mugger, and roots through the purse to find the disk before shooting the mugger. He takes Bennett out on his speedboat to kill her as well, but she finds his gun and confronts him. While fleeing with the disk and Devlin's wallet, Bennett's dinghy collides with rocks, destroying the disk and hospitalizing her. She is unconscious for three days. When Bennett wakes up, she finds that all records of her life have been deleted: She was checked out of her hotel room in Cozumel, her car is no longer at the airport parking lot, and her credit cards are invalid. Bennett's home is now empty and listed for sale. Moreover, because none of the neighbors remember her, they cannot confirm her identity. Bennett's Social Security number is now assigned to a \\"Ruth Marx,\\" for whom Devlin has entered an arrest record by hacking the police computer system. When Bennett calls her own desk at Cathedral Software, an impostor answers and offers Bennett her old life back in exchange for the disk. She contacts the only other person who knows her by sight, psychiatrist and former lover Alan Champion. He checks her into a hotel, offers to contact a friend at the FBI, and arranges to have her mother moved for her safety. Using her knowledge of the backdoor and a password found in Devlin's wallet, Bennett logs into the Bethesda Naval Hospital's computers and learns that Under Secretary of Defense Bergstrom, who had opposed Gatekeeper's use by the federal government, was misdiagnosed. Fellow hacker \\"Cyberbob\\" connects œÄ with the \\"Praetorians,\\" a notorious group of cyberterrorists linked to recent computer failures around the country. Bennett and Cyberbob plan to meet, but the Praetorians intercept their online chat. Bennett escapes from Devlin--a contract killer for the cyberterrorists, but the Praetorians kill Champion by tampering with pharmacy and hospital computer records. After Bennett is arrested by the California Highway Patrol, a man identifying himself as Champion's FBI friend frees her from jail. She realises he is an impostor and escapes again. Now wanted for murder and thought to be Ruth Marx, Bennett hitchhikes to Cathedral's office where, using her impostor's computer, she connects the cyberterrorists to Gregg Microsystems and uncovers their scheme: once the Praetorians sabotage an organization's computer system, Gregg sells Gatekeeper to it and gains unlimited access through the backdoor. Bennett emails evidence of the backdoor and Gregg's involvement with the Praetorians to the FBI from the Moscone Center and tricks Devlin into releasing a virus into Gregg's mainframe, destroying Gatekeeper and undoing the erasing of her identity. During a battle on the catwalks of the convention center, in which Devlin accidentally kills the Bennett impostor from Cathedral Software (the real Ruth Marx), Bennett ambushes Devlin with a fire extinguisher, causing him to fall to his death. Bennett regains her identity, home, and life. She then reunites with her mother, and the conspiracy is exposed, with Jeff Gregg being arrested by the FBI. ==Cast== * Sandra Bullock as Angela Bennett * Jeremy Northam as Jack Devlin * Dennis Miller as Dr. Alan Champion * Diane Baker as Mrs. Bennett * Wendy Gazelle as Ruth Marx * Ken Howard as Michael Bergstrom * Ray McKinnon as Dale Hessman * Gerald Berns as Jeff Gregg * Robert Gossett as Ben Phillips decoy ==Production== In October 1994, Bullock committed to filming The Net from mid-January through April 10, 1995.

The site's consensus states: \\"The premise isn't without potential and Sandra Bullock is as likable as ever, but The Net lacks sufficient thrills -- or plausible plot points -- to recommend catching.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars. Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, complimented Sandra Bullock's performance, saying \\"Bullock pulls you into the movie.

The UIC Country Code for Slovenia is 79. ==History== Steam locomotive S≈Ω 25-026, manufactured in 1920 in Vienna, nowadays used by Slovenske ≈æeleznice for tourist purposes Slovenia received its first railway connection in the 1840s, when the Austrian Empire built a railway connection - S√ºdliche Staatsbahn or Austrian Southern Railway - between its capital, Vienna, and its major commercial port, Trieste. Thus, Maribor was connected by railway to Graz in 1844. The stretch was extended via Pragersko to Celje in 1846, and further via Zidani Most to Ljubljana in 1849. A double-track line was continued via Postojna, Pivka, and Divaƒça, finally reaching Trieste in 1857. Before World War I, numerous other railways were built. In 1860, Pragersko was connected to Ormo≈æ and further to ƒåakovec, Croatia, thus connecting the Austrian and the Hungarian part of the empire. In 1862, a single-track railway (expanded into double-track in 1944) along the Sava river was built, connecting Zidani Most with Zagreb. In 1863, the \\"Carinthian railway\\" was built along the Drava river, connecting Maribor with Dravograd, Klagenfurt and Villach. In 1870, a railway along the upper Sava river valley was built, connecting Ljubljana with Kranj, Jesenice and Tarvisio, Italy. In 1873, a line from Pivka via Illirska Bistrica connected Rijeka, then the most important commercial port in the Hungarian part of the empire. In 1876, a line from Divaƒça connected Pula, the Austrian naval base, via Pre≈°nica. In 1906, Bohinj Railway was built, connecting Villach with Jesenice, along the Soƒça river valley to Gorizia and further to Trieste, with two over-6000 meter tunnels. Few lines were opened after World War I. One of them connected Ormo≈æ with Ljutomer and Murska Sobota, and opened in 1924. After World War II, a single-track electrified line connecting Pre≈°nica with Koper was built in 1967. Slovenian Railways (, S≈Ω), the state railway company of Slovenia was created in 1991 from the Ljubljana division of the former Yugoslav Railways after the breakup of Yugoslavia. In 1999, a single-track line between Murska Sobota and Hodo≈° was rebuilt, offering a direct connection with the Hungarian railway system. The line was originally built in 1907 and closed down in 1968 among numerous other lines closed down during the 1960s. In April 2016 the electrification of the Pragersko - Hodo≈° line was completed. Numerous ex-Yugoslav Railways steam locomotives are plinthed at stations around Slovenia and there is a railway museum at Ljubljana. == Rolling stock of the Slovenian Railways == File:Slovenian Pendolino at Zidani Most.jpgS≈Ω 310 File:Stadler flirt emu s≈æ.jpgStadler Flirt EMU (S≈Ω 510/515) Stadler Flirt DMU (S≈Ω 610/615) File:S≈Ω 312 317 2.jpgSiemens Desiro (S≈Ω 312/317) File:S≈Ω 713 715.jpgS≈Ω 713/715 File:6 SZ 813-112 Spielfeld-Strass 020316.jpgS≈Ω 813/814 ==System== Freight train S≈Ω 541-102 Slovenian Railways operates 1,229 km of standard gauge tracks, 331 km as double track, and reaches all regions of the country. Slovenia is well connected by rail to all surrounding countries, reflecting the fact that it used to be part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and later part of Yugoslavia. Left-hand running is used on double-track sections, unlike the remainder of the former Yugoslavian railways. Electrification is provided by a 3 kV DC system and covers 610 km, with electrification from Pragersko to Hodo≈° on the Corridor V completed in April 2016. The remainder of the former Yugoslavian railways that have been electrified operate with the 25 kV AC system, so trains to Zagreb have to change engines at Dobova in case there aren't any dual voltage engines. The DC system was inherited from the Italian Ferrovie dello Stato on the Se≈æana-Pivka-Ilirska Bistrica-≈†apjane line. Further electrification was conducted with the same system to preserve compatibility. A high-speed rail line between Ljubljana and Dobova is now proposed. This high-speed rail will be electrified at 25 kV AC, with right- hand running. ==Rail links to adjacent countries== * Same gauge ** Austria ‚Äî voltage change to 15 kV AC ** Croatia ‚Äî voltage change to 25 kV 50 Hz AC ** Hungary ‚Äî voltage change to 25 kV 50 Hz AC ** Italy ‚Äî same voltage 3 kV DC ==Crossroad of Pan-European corridors== Ljubljana is at the heart of the S≈Ω system. Here, the Pan-European corridors V and X intersect. These transportation corridors are being established to tie larger segments of Europe economically together: Corridor V links Venice - Trieste/Koper - Ljubljana - Maribor - Budapest - Kyiv, while Corridor X connects Salzburg - Ljubljana - Zagreb - Belgrade - Skopje - Thessalonica. The freight system to Koper, a modern and growing port near Trieste, represents the shortest connection to the Mediterranean for a large portion of the hinterland of Central and Eastern Europe. In 2010, Slovenske ≈æeleznice joined Cargo 10, a joint venture with other railways in the region. ==Passenger trains== ===InterCity Slovenija (ICS)=== ICS Pendolino ETR-310 serving as fast train between Ljubljana and Maribor. The ICS trains are modern, air-conditioned trains which provide fast speeds and comfort. They are equipped with disabled access and other facilities. The passengers can buy food on board (from Monday to Friday), the 1st class passengers are offered food free of charge. There are also electric sockets in the 1st class department. The train is a tilting EMU. The reservation of a seat is obligatory and is included in the price of the ticket. Also included in the price of the ticket is the obligatory ICS supplement. The ICS trains run on the following line (note: the regular service runs between Maribor and Ljubljana. The Austria to Maribor part of the line is served by only one pair of trains a day. The section from Ljubljana to Koper runs only on summer Saturdays, Sundays and Bank Holidays.): *Spielfeld- Stra√ü (Austria) *Maribor **connection to Holmec and onwards to Austria *Pragersko **connection to Sredi≈°ƒçe **connection to Hodo≈° and onwards to Hungary *Celje **connection to Velenje **connection to Sveti Rok ob Sotli **connection to Imeno *Zidani Most **connection to Dobova and onwards to Croatia *Ljubljana **connection to Rosalnice and onwards to Croatia **connection to Jesenice and onwards to Austria **connection to Kamnik Graben **connection to Ljubljana Moste (BTC) *Pivka **connection to Ilirska Bistrica and onwards to Croatia *Divaƒça **connection to Se≈æana *Hrpelje-Kozina **connection to Rakitovec and onwards to Croatia *Koper ===InterCity (IC)=== The IC trains are quality trains serving longer distances in national and international traffic. They connect bigger towns, cities and tourist resorts. They consist of comfortable cars. They provide fast connection and call only at major stations. The train usually consists of open or compartment coaches (1st and 2nd class). Some of the trains may have a restaurant car. An IC supplement must be paid for this type of train. ===EuroCity (EC)=== The EC trains are high-quality trains serving important lines in international traffic. They connect important cities in Slovenia and the rest of Europe. The EC trains are even faster than the IC trains and they call at fewer stations. The majority of the EC trains include air-conditioned cars and have catering facilities on board. The train usually consists of open and compartment passenger coaches (1st and 2nd class). Some of the trains may have a restaurant car. An EC supplement must be paid for this type of train. ===International trains (MV)=== The MV trains (Slovene for mednarodni vlak, international train) are quality trains serving international lines. They do not call at minor stations. The train usually consists of open and compartment passenger coaches (1st and 2nd class). Some of the trains may have a restaurant car. An MV supplement must be paid for this type of train. ===EuroNight (EN)=== The EN trains are high-quality overnight international trains. They offer open or compartment passenger coaches (1st and 2nd class), couchette cars and sleeping cars. Some of the trains may have a restaurant car. The EC supplement must be paid for regular seats and an additional supplement must be paid for couchettes and sleeper cars. Some EN trains use \\"global\\" prices with an obligatory reservation. ===Regional (RG) and local trains (LP)=== The RG and LP (Slovene for lokalni potni≈°ki, local passenger train) trains are other trains, connecting all parts of Slovenia. They serve as commuter trains. On some lines, they are the only type of trains available, for example lines to Kamnik and Imeno. The trains offer 2nd class travel only. They are usually EMUs and DMUs on unelectrified lines. ===Supplements=== In addition to the supplements for faster trains, there is also one for tickets bought on the train instead of beforehand. It is set at ‚Ç¨2.50, and no discount is available for children, the elderly, groups, and so on. ===Named trains=== Many trains are assigned names. The examples include: *IC 502 / 503 \\"Pohorje\\" *IC 518 / 519 \\"Ptuj\\" *IC 516 / 517 \\"Mura\\" *IC 508 / 509 \\"Dana\\" *EC 210 / 211 \\"Sava\\" *EC 150 / 151 \\"Emona\\" *EC 158 / 159 \\"Croatia\\" *EC 212 / 213 \\"Mimara\\" *EC 246 / 247 \\"Citadella\\" *MV 498 / 499 \\"Lisinski\\" *MV 246 / 247 \\"Citadella\\" *MV 414 / 415 \\"Alpine Pearls\\" *MV 480 / 481 \\"Opatija\\" *MV 482 / 483 \\"Ljubljana\\" *MV 1472 / 1473 \\"Istra\\" *RG 1604 / 1605 \\"Istra\\" *RG 600 / 601 \\"Soƒça\\" ===Former named trains=== A noted train of the S≈Ω was the Casanova linking Ljubljana to Venice in a 4-hour ride, eliminated in April 2007.

The main coat of arms is a checkerboard (chequy) that consists of 13 red and 12 silver (white) fields. It's also informally known in Croatian as ≈°ahovnica (\\"chessboard\\", from ≈°ah, \\"chess\\"). The five smaller shields represent five different historical regions within Croatia. ==Official description== Croatian law describes the coat of arms as follows:Zakon o grbu, zastavi i himni Republike Hrvatske te zastavi i lenti predsjednika Republike Hrvatske, ƒålanak 7 The coat of arms of the Republic of Croatia is the historical Croatian coat of arms in the form of a shield twice divided horizontally and vertically into twenty- five red and white (silver) fields, so that the first field in the upper left corner is red. Above the shield lies a crown with five spikes, slightly arched with its ends conjoined with upper left and right parts of the shield. Within the crown, five lesser shields with historical Croatian coats of arms, lined from left to right in the following order: the oldest known Croatian coat of arms, coats of arms of the Dubrovnik Republic, Dalmatia, Istria and Slavonia. The ratio of height of the field of the main shield to the height of the smaller shields in the crown is 1:2.5, and of the width of the field of the main shield to the width of the smaller shields in the crown is 1:1. The oldest known coat of arms of Croatia contains in a shield on a light blue field a yellow (golden) six-pointed star with a white (silver) crescent. Coat of arms of the Republic of Dubrovnik contains in a shield on a blue field two red bars. The Dalmatian arms contain in a shield on a light blue field three yellow (golden) crowned leopard heads. The Istrian arms contain in a shield on a blue field a yellow (golden) goat facing left with red hooves and horns. The Slavonian arms contain on a light blue field two horizontal white (silver) bars, between bars a red field, on which sneaks a weasel to the left. In the upper light blue field is a yellow (golden) six-pointed star. The coat of arms is lined red. ==History== The checkerboard coat of arms (≈°ahovnica) is first attested as an official symbol of the Kingdom of Croatia on an Innsbruck tower depicting the emblem of Maximilian I, Archduke of Austria in 1495.Karl-Heinz Hesmer: Chronik griffbereit: Flaggen und Wappen der Welt. Wissen Media Verlag GmbH, 2008. .Ottfried Neubecker: Wappen ‚Äì ihr Ursprung, Sinn und Wert, It appeared on a seal from the Cetingrad Charter that confirmed the 1527 election of Ferdinand I, Archduke of Austria as king of Croatia in Cetin.Robert Stallaerts: Historical dictionary of Croatia. Scarecrow Press, Inc. 2010. Robert Layton, Julian Thomas, Peter G. Stone: Destruction and conservation of cultural property. Routledge, 2001. . Under the Hungarian kings and well after the Council of Constance, as shown in the works of Ulrich of Richenthal and Conrad Gr√ºnenberg, the Croatian coat of arms was an arm dexter holding a dagger (possibly alluding to Milo≈° Obiliƒá). The origin of the design has often been purported as being medieval. Historic tradition states it to be the arms of Stephen Dr≈æislav in the 10th century.Bellamy, Alex J. (2003). The Formation of Croatian National Identity: A Centuries-old Dream. Manchester University Press. p. 36. . A Split stone baptistry from the time of Peter Kre≈°imir IV (r. 1058‚Äì1074/5) has engraved falcons that carry something that resembles a chequy on their wings, and the bell tower of the medieval Church of St. Lucy, Jurandvor has a checkerboard pattern carved onto it. The size of the checkerboard ranges from 3√ó3 to 8√ó8, but most commonly 5√ó5, like in the current design. It was traditionally conjectured that the colours originally represented Red Croatia and White Croatia, but there is no historical evidence to support this. Towards the Late Middle Ages the distinction for the three crown lands (Croatia proper, Dalmatia, Slavonia) was made. The ≈°ahovnica was used as the coat of arms of Croatia proper & together with the shields of Slavonia and Dalmatia was often used to represent the whole of Croatia in Austria-Hungary. It was used as an unofficial coat of arms of the Kingdom of Croatia adopted in 1848 and as an official coat of arms of the post-1868 Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia (both unofficially known as Triune Kingdom). The two are the same except for the position of the ≈°ahovnica and Dalmatian coat of arms which are switched around & with different crowns used above the shield ‚Äì the later employing St Stephen's crown (associated with Hungarian kings). By late 19th century ≈°ahovnica had come to be considered a generally recognized symbol for Croats and Croatia and in 1919, it was included in the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) to represent Croats. When the Banovina of Croatia was formed, the ≈°ahovnica (chequy gules and argent) was retained as the official symbol. The Ustashe regime which had ruled Croatia during the World War II superimposed their ideological symbol, the letter \\"U\\" above or around the ≈°ahovnica (upper left square white) as the official national symbol during their rule. After the Second World War, the new Socialist Republic of Croatia became a part of the federal Second Yugoslavia. The ≈°ahovnica was included in the new socialist coat of arms.Jonas Frykman, Jonas Frykman G√∂sta Arvastson: Ethnologia Europaea, Volume 26, 1995. It was designed in the socialist tradition, including symbols like wheat for peasants and an anvil for workers, as well as a rising sun to symbolize a new morning and a red star for communism. During the change to multiparty elections in Croatia (as part of the collapse of Communist rule in Eastern Europe from the late 1980s), and prior to the establishment of the current design, the ≈°ahovnica, shedding the communist symbols that were the hallmark of Croatia in the second Yugoslavia, reappeared as a stand-alone symbol as both the 'upper left square red' and 'upper left square white' variants. The choice of 'upper left square red' or 'upper left square white' was often dictated by heraldic laws and aesthetic requirements. The first-field-white variant was adopted by the Republic of Croatia and used briefly in 1990. According to constitutional changes which came into effect on 26 June 1990 the red star in the flag of SR Croatia was to be replaced by the \\"historical Croatian coat of arms with 25 red and white fields\\", without specifying order of fields. The first-field-white variant was used at the official flag hoisting ceremony on 25 July and was later occasionally used on par with the first-field-red variant until 21 December 1990 when the current coat of arms was officially adopted. ==Current design== On 21 December 1990, the post-socialist government of Croatia, passed a law prescribing the design created by the graphic designer Miroslav ≈†utej, under the aegis of a commission chaired by Nik≈°a Stanƒçiƒá, then head of the Department of Croatian History at the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb. The new design added the five crowning shields which represent the regions of Croatia.

This coat of arms was also commonly associated with the Illyrian movement. -  90px  Dubrovnik region ‚Äì Coat of arms of Dubrovnik: Azure, two bars gules ‚Äì Two red stripes on a dark blue shield. This is a simplified variation of the Coat of arms of Dubrovnik, with two red bars instead of four; it was used by Dubrovnik Republic since the 14th century. The original coat of arms is the old coat of arms of √Årp√°d dynasty, granted to Dubrovnik Republic by King Louis I in 1358 as it became a vassal of the Hungarian-Croatian king.Vito Galzinski, Dr≈æavni grbovi, page 344Zdenka Janekoviƒá-R√∂mer, Okvir slobode, page 364, Jakov Lukariƒá ‚Äì Copioso ristretto degli annali di Rausa, page 155 Accessed 24 June 2013Frane ƒåizmiƒá, Dr≈æavni grb Dubrovaƒçke Republike, page 32Maritime Museum in Dubrovnik Accessed 24 June 2013 The red-blue variant hails from the 1950s interpretation of the template (decorative) lines within the originally white lines of the original CoA.Frane ƒåizmiƒá, Dr≈æavni grb Dubrovaƒçke Republike, pages 22 and 32Vito Galzinski, Dr≈æavni grbovi, pages 346 and 347 -  90px  Dalmatia ‚Äì Coat of arms of Dalmatia: Bleu celeste, three leopards' heads affront√©s caboshed Or, crowned Or ‚Äì Three golden, crowned heraldic leopard heads, two over one, on a blue shield. The depicted version from the crown differs from the traditional depiction of these arms: traditionally, the leopards are roaring and langued (i.e. with tongues visible), and the colour of the shield is heraldic azure, not bleu celeste. Historically, this coat of arms was in use since at least the 14th century. The first officially recorded use goes back to King Louis I and his daughter Queen Mary who both used an earlier version of the arms as part of their personal coat of arms. Until 1526 this coat of arms was also used to represent Croatia in general, apparent from the coat of arms of several kings: Louis I, Mary, Matthias Corvinus and Louis II.

It was only in 1861 when the March of Istria became the Crown land in the Austrian Empire that this coat of arms became official. Traditional depictions of the arms differed greatly depending on the authors: mostly depicted on a blue but sometimes also on green background, colors (tinctures) of the charge (goat ‚Äì sometimes with gold and sometimes with red hooves and horns), position or attitude of the goat ‚Äì sometimes shown as passant (passing with front leg up) and sometimes statant (standing with all four legs on the ground), orientation of the charge ‚Äì sometimes turned to right and sometimes to left (dexter and sinister) and even the charge itself with some variants showing a female goat and some a Capricorn (male goat).Slovenska heraldika ‚Äì Grb Istre (in Slovenian)Koza u grbu Istre: prilog poznavanju povijesne pozadine grba i istarskog kozarstva ‚Äì Jagoda Vondraƒçek-Mesar (in Croatian) The current variant used in the crest and also as the coat of arms of County of Istria are both derived from the March of Istria arms from 1861 by Hugo Gerard Str√∂hl. -  90px  Slavonia ‚Äì Coat of arms of Slavonia: Bleu celeste, a fess Gules fimbriated Argent surmounted by a mullet of six points Or, a marten Sable courant proper in chief ‚Äì Six-pointed star (morning star) above two silver stripes on a blue shield (representing the rivers Drava and Sava marking the Northern and Southern border of Slavonia), between them a running Pine marten in natural colors (Kuna in Croatian ‚Äì note the national currency Croatian kuna) on a red field. Historically correct version of the arms uses a heraldic blue rather than light blue (Bleu celeste). This coat of arms was derived from an earlier version found on Slavonian Banovac coins minted between 1235 and 1384,Ivan Bojniƒçiƒá-Kninski ‚Äì Grbovnica kraljevine \\"Slavonije\\", (1895) ‚Äì PDF file (in Croatian), accessed 28 February 2014 which showed a marten running on a field between two six-pointed stars.Matica Hrvatska HRVATSKA NOVƒåARSKA BA≈†TINA (in Croatian), accessed 24 July 2013 The coat of arms was officially granted by king Vladislaus II Jagiellon on December 8, 1496.Matica Hrvatska Hrvatski grb u mijenama hrvatske povijesti (in Croatian), accessed 24 July 2013 It was used as the official seal of Croatian Sabor from 1497 until the late 18th century. } Some of the more traditional heraldic pundits have criticized the latest design for various design solutions, such as adding a crown to the coat, varying shades of blue in its even fields, and adding the red border around the coat. The government has accepted their criticism insofar as not accepting further non-traditional designs for the county coats of arms, but the national symbol has remained intact. Unlike in many countries, Croatian design more commonly uses symbolism from the coat of arms, rather than from the Croatian flag. This is partly due to the geometric design of the shield which makes it appropriate for use in many graphic contexts (e.g. the insignia of Croatia Airlines or the design of the shirt for the Croatia national football team), and partly because the Pan-Slavic colors are present in many European flags. ===Historical versions of the crown arms=== Most coats of arms used in the crown on the modern-day coat of arms differ slightly from historically accurate versions.

Bobby Seale, the eighth man charged, had his trial severed during the proceedings, lowering the number of defendants from eight to seven. The trial resulted in five of the seven convicted for inciting riots. All were acquitted of conspiracy. However, during the trial, Judge Julius Hoffman sentenced all of the defendants to lengthy sentences for contempt of court. In subsequent proceedings, the judge's contempt charges were reversed, and all of the convictions for inciting riots were overturned. ==Background== The 1968 Democratic National Convention was held in Chicago in late August to select the party's candidates for the November 1968 presidential election. Prior to and during the convention‚Äîwhich took place at the International Amphitheatre‚Äîrallies, demonstrations, marches, and attempted marches took place on the streets and in the lakefront parks, about five miles away from the convention site. These activities were primarily in protest of President Lyndon B. Johnson's policies for the Vietnam War, policies which were vigorously contested during the presidential primary campaign and inside the convention itself. Anti-war groups had petitioned the city of Chicago for permits to march five miles from the Loop to within sight of the convention site, to hold a number of rallies in the lakefront parks and also near the convention, and to camp in Lincoln Park. The city denied all permits, except for one afternoon rally at the old bandshell at the south end of Grant Park. The city also enforced an 11:00 pm curfew in Lincoln Park. Confrontations with protesters ensued as the police enforced the curfew, stopped attempts to march to the International Amphitheatre, and cleared crowds from the streets. The Grant Park rally on Wednesday, August 28, 1968, was attended by about 15,000 protesters; other nearby activities involved hundreds or thousands of protesters. After the rally at the bandshell, several thousand protesters attempted to march to the International Amphitheatre, but were stopped in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel, where the presidential candidates and their campaigns were headquartered. Police worked to push the protesters out of the street, using tear gas, verbal and physical confrontation, and police batons to beat people; protesters retaliated by throwing rocks and bottles, and damaging private commercial property. The police made scores of arrests. The television networks broadcast footage of these violent clashes, cutting away from the nominating speeches for the presidential candidates. Over the course of five days and nights, the police made numerous arrests, in addition to using tear gas, mace, and batons on the marchers. Hundreds of protesters and police officers were injured. Dozens of journalists covering the actions were also clubbed by police or had cameras smashed and film confiscated. In the aftermath of what was later characterized as a \\"police riot\\" by the U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, a federal grand jury indicted eight demonstrators and eight police officers. == Grand jury and indictment == Following the convention on September 9, 1968, a federal grand jury was convened to consider criminal charges. The grand jury focused on the possible grounds for charges in four areas: * A conspiracy by protesters to cross state lines to incite a riot; * Violations by police of the civil rights of demonstrators by use of excessive force; * TV network violations of the Federal Communications Act; and * TV network violations of federal wiretap laws. Over the course of more than six months, the grand jury met 30 times and heard some 200 witnesses. President Lyndon Johnson's Attorney General, Ramsey Clark, discouraged an indictment, believing that the violence during the convention was primarily caused by mishandling of the protests by the Chicago police. The grand jury returned indictments only after President Richard Nixon took office and John Mitchell assumed the office of Attorney General. On March 20, 1969, eight protesters were charged with various federal crimes and eight police officers were charged with civil rights violations. == Charges == The eight defendants were charged under the anti-riot provisions of Title X of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 which made it a federal crime to cross state lines with the intent to incite a riot, or to conspire to do so. The Chicago Eight indictments alleged crimes of three kinds: * That all eight defendants conspired (together with another 16 other co-conspirators who were not indicted) to cross state lines to incite a riot, to teach the making of an incendiary device, and to commit acts to impede law enforcement officers in their lawful duties. * That David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and Bobby Seale individually crossed state lines to incite a riot. * That John Froines and Lee Weiner instructed other persons in the construction and use of an incendiary device. The 16 people who were named as alleged co-conspirators but not indicted were: Wolfe B. Lowenthal, Stewart E. Albert, Sidney M. Peck, Kathy Boudin, Corina F. Fales, Benjamin Radford, Thomas W. Neumann, Craig Shimabukuro, Bo Taylor, David A. Baker, Richard Bosciano, Terry Gross, Donna Gripe, Benjamin Ortiz, Joseph Toornabene, and Richard Palmer. There is evidence that at least one other person, Eric Weinberger, was considered for indictment. ==Trial== Bobby Seale as depicted by Franklin McMahon at the trial. The original eight defendants indicted by the grand jury on March 20, 1969, were Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner, and Bobby Seale. The trial began on September 24, 1969.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon and Schuster 2000 p. 552 The defense attorneys were William Kunstler, Leonard Weinglass of the Center for Constitutional Rights, as well as Michael Kennedy, Michael Tigar, Charles Garry, Gerald Lefcourt, and Dennis Roberts. The judge was Julius Hoffman, and the prosecutors were Richard Schultz and Tom Foran. On October 9, the governor of Illinois requested the United States National Guard for crowd control as demonstrations increased outside the courtroom. When the names of the defendants were mentioned in court, at the early part of the trial, Judge Hoffman made a comment about defendant Abbie Hoffman (no relation); \\"He is not my son.\\" In an immediate reply, Abbie called out, \\"Dad, dad, have you forsaken me?!\\" Right from the beginning of the trial, Judge Hoffman showed a marked bias for the prosecution in his rulings and a dislike of the defense lawyers, making it clear that he disapproved of Kunstler's long hair.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon and Schuster 2000 p. 553 According to The Chicago Tribune, \\"[b]eginning as the Chicago Eight Trial, it quickly became the Chicago Seven when Seale, after loudly disrupting the trial when he could not have the lawyer of his choice, was at first bound and gagged in the courtroom and then severed from the case for a later trial, which never occurred.\\" Seale requested that the trial be postponed so that his attorney Charles Garry could represent him (as Garry was about to undergo gallbladder surgery). The Judge denied the postponement, and refused to allow Seale to represent himself. Seale vehemently protested the judge's illegal and unconstitutional actions, and arguing that they were not only illegal, but also racist. Seale told the courtroom: \\"This racist administration government with its Superman notions and comic book politics. We're hip to the fact that Superman saved no black people. You got that?...You have did everything you could with those jive lying witnesses up there presented by these pig agents of the government to lie and say and condone some rotten racists, fascist crap by racist cops and pigs that beat people's heads in-and I demand my constitutional rights!\\" The judge in turn accused Seale of disrupting the court, and on October 29, Hoffman ordered Seale to be bound, gagged, and chained to a chair, citing a precedent from the U.S. Supreme Court case Illinois v. Allen.US Supreme Court Center, 397 U.S. 337 (1970) For several days, Seale appeared in court bound and gagged before the jury, struggling to get free and managing to make muffled sounds. Defense attorney Kunstler declared, \\"This is no longer a court of order, Your Honor, this is a medieval torture chamber.\\" This was alluded to in Graham Nash's song, \\"Chicago\\", which opened with: \\"So your brother's bound and gagged, and they've chained him to a chair\\". Trying Seale with the other seven defendants also proved to be a fiasco, as it was revealed that Seale had not participated in the planning for the demonstration, but had gone to Chicago as a last-minute replacement for Eldridge Cleaver and was only in the city for two days of the convention. Ultimately, Judge Hoffman severed Seale from the case, sentencing him to four years in prison for contempt of court, one of the longest sentences ever handed down for that offense in the U.S. up to that time.Contempt in Chicago, Time Magazine, Friday, Nov. 14, 1969 Due to the judge's unconstitutional actions, the contempt charges against Seale were soon overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Chicago Eight were then reduced to the Chicago Seven. The defendants, particularly members of the Youth International Party (\\"yippies\\"), Hoffman and Rubin, mocked courtroom decorum and the widely publicized trial became a focal point for a growing legion of protesters. One day, defendants Hoffman and Rubin appeared in court dressed in judicial robes. Hoffman blew kisses at the jury. Judge Hoffman was a frequent target of the defendants, who insulted him to his face. Abbie Hoffman told Judge Hoffman \\"you are a shande fur de Goyim [Yiddish for \\"disgrace in front of the gentiles\\"]. You would have served Hitler better.\\" He later added that \\"your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room.\\" Both Davis and Rubin told the judge \\"this court is bullshit.\\" The trial extended for months, with many celebrated figures from the American left and counterculture called to testify, including singers Phil Ochs, Judy Collins, Arlo Guthrie, and Country Joe McDonald; writers Norman Mailer and Allen Ginsberg; and activists Timothy Leary and Jesse Jackson. Ochs, who was involved in planning for the demonstrations, told the court that he had acquired a pig to nominate as a presidential candidate. Rubin had tried to deliver the acceptance speech for the pig, named Pigasus, but before he could finish, police arrested him and Ochs under a livestock ordinance; this charge was later changed to disorderly conduct. ==Contempt citations== While the jury deliberated on the verdict, Judge Hoffman cited all the defendants‚Äîplus their lawyers Kunstler, Kennedy, Weinglass, Lefcourt, Roberts and Tigar‚Äîfor numerous contempts of court, imposing sentences ranging from 2¬Ω months to four years. Judge Hoffman gave Kunstler four years in prison for addressing him as \\"Mr. Hoffman\\" instead of \\"Your Honor\\", Abbie Hoffman received 8 months for laughing in court, Hayden one year for protesting the treatment of Seale, and Weiner two months for refusing to stand when Judge Hoffman entered the courtroom.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon and Schuster 2000 p. 560 Despite also engaging in occasional courtroom disruption, it was acknowledged that Froines' courtroom antics were mild compared to those of his other Chicago Seven co-defendants. ==Verdict== On February 18, 1970, each of the seven defendants was acquitted of conspiracy. Two (Froines and Weiner) were acquitted completely, while the remaining five were convicted of crossing state lines with the intent to incite a riot. The crime was instituted by the anti-riot provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, a provision that was introduced in the House by Representative William C. Cramer of Florida. On February 20, they were sentenced to five years in prison and fined $5,000 each.The Chicago Seven Trial: Excerpts from the Trial Transcript, Famous Trials: Chicago Seven Dellinger told the court that whatever punishment he faced in prison \\"will be slight compared to what has happened already to the Vietnamese people, to the black people, to the criminals with whom we are now spending our days in the Cook County jail\\".Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon and Schuster 2000 p. 561 Hayden charged that the responsibility with the riots at the Chicago Democratic convention laid with Chicago Mayor Richard Daley who had denied permits for protesters, saying: \\"We had no choice. We had no choice in this trial. The people always do what they have to do\\". Abbie Hoffman pointed to the portraits of American Revolutionary War heroes on the wall behind Judge Hoffman and said: \\"I know those guys on the wall. I know them better than you, I feel. I know Adams. I mean, I know all the Adams. They grew up twenty miles from my home in Massachusetts. I played with Sam Adams on the Concord Bridge. I was there when Paul Revere rode right up on his motorcycle and said, 'The pigs are coming, the pigs are coming. Right into Lexington'. I was there\\". In a final gesture of contempt towards those on trial, Judge Hoffman ordered that the barbers of the Cook County Jail cut the long hair of the defendants and defense lawyers that he found so offensive. At a press conference, Sheriff Joseph Woods of Cook County proudly displayed Abbie Hoffman's shorn hair. ==Appeal== On November 21, 1972, all of the convictions were reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on the basis that the judge was biased in his refusal to permit defense attorneys to screen prospective jurors for cultural and racial bias,United States v. Dellinger, 472 F.2d 340 (7th Cir. 1972). and the FBI surveillance of the defense lawyers' offices. The Justice Department decided against retrying the case. During the trial, all of the defendants and both defense attorneys had been cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned on appeal. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the personal nature of the conduct at issue required all of the contempt charges to be tried before another judge, and that each appellant whose sentence exceeded six months was entitled to a jury trial on the charge. In re Dellinger, 461 F.2d 389 (7th Cir. 1972). The contempt charges were retried before a different judge, who found Dellinger, Rubin, Hoffman, and Kunstler guilty of some of the charges, but did not sentence any of them to jail or fines.In re Dellinger, 370 F.Supp. 1304 (N.D.Ill. 1973). ==Cultural representations== ===Music=== Over 25 songs referenced the Chicago Seven and the 1968 Chicago demonstrations outside the Democratic National Convention. One of the first, released in 1968, was \\"Telling It Straight in '68\\" by country artist Jim Hartley, about the 1968 presidential election, which noted the confrontation in Chicago. A popular song was by Graham Nash, called \\"Chicago\\", for his debut album, Songs for Beginners. The songs's first line, \\"So your brother's bound and gagged, and they've chained him to a chair\\", is a reference to Bobby Seale. Other notable songs included \\"William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed\\" and \\"Where Were You in Chicago\\" by Phil Ochs, featured on his 1969 album Rehearsals for Retirement, \\"Circus '68 '69\\" (1970) by Charlie Haden, \\"Christmas in My Soul\\" (1970) by Laura Nyro, \\"Free Bobby Now\\" (1970) by Black Panther group The Lumpen (about Bobby Seale), \\"Chicago's 7\\" by Walt Wilder, \\"Chicago 7\\" by Warren Farren, \\"Chicago Seven\\" (1971) by blues artist Memphis Slim, and \\"The Chicago Conspiracy\\" (1972) by David Peel. ===Film=== *Mixing fact and fiction, Haskell Wexler's 1969 film Medium Cool centers on the relationship between a cameraman and young widow as they are surrounded by the turmoil and violence during the \\"long hot summer\\" of Chicago. Wexler mixed staged scenes with documentary footage he shot at the demonstrations, creating a film in which his characters interacted seamlessly with the protesters. At one point, the viewer can hear another filmmaker telling Wexler he is getting too close to the action. *A BBC-produced docudrama titled The Chicago Conspiracy Trial was based on trial transcripts and aired in the United Kingdom in October 1970. The film was subsequently aired by Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bavarian Television) in West Germany in July 1971, and in the US by PBS in July 1975. *French filmmakers Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin, under the collective Dziga Vertov Group, made a film depicting the 1970 trials called Vladimir et Rosa. In it, Judge Julius Hoffman is referred to as \\"Judge Himmler\\" and the accused become microcosms of French revolutionary society. The historic figures of Lenin and Karl Rosa also appear, played by Godard and Gorin, respectively. *In the 1971 Peter Watkins film Punishment Park, fictional members of the counterculture are put on trial for similar \\"crimes\\". Like Black Panther Party activist Bobby Seale, one of the African-American defendants is bound and gagged as he was at the historic trial. *Woody Allen satirized the trial in his 1971 film Bananas. Allen's character, Fielding Melish, is on trial and defending himself. The judge orders Melish bound and gagged. In the next scene, a bound and gagged Allen coerces a confession, √† la Perry Mason, from a prosecution witness in his cross-examination. *In 1987, HBO aired Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8, a docudrama based on the court transcript as the primary source for the script. All eight of the original defendants, along with defense attorneys William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass, participated in the project and provided commentary throughout the film. It was awarded the 1988 CableACE Award for Best Dramatic Special. *The 2000 film, Steal This Movie, is mostly about Abbie Hoffman (played by Vincent D'Onofrio), but also looks at the trial. *In the 2007 film Chicago 10, Oscar-nominated director Brett Morgen intercuts archival footage from the period, including the events of August 1968, with animated scenes based on the trial transcript. The film premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and was released in theaters in February 2008. *The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus, by Cannes-winning director Kerry Feltham, was a feature film made at the time of the trial, based on the trial transcript and distributed by New Line Cinema. It was released in January 2008 on DVD. The film won the Berlin Film Festival jury prize, as well as positive reviews from the New York Times and Newsweek. *Archival footage of events at the Chicago demonstrations was featured in the 2010 documentary Phil Ochs: There but for Fortune. The film also featured interviews with many of Ochs' associates, including Rubin and Hoffman. It was a dual portrait of the singer- songwriter's career and the protest movements of the 1960s. *The Chicago 8, written and directed by Pinchas Perry, was filmed in September and October 2009 and released on October 23, 2012. The film is based closely on the trial transcripts and most of the action takes place in the courtroom. *Writer Aaron Sorkin directed a film entitled The Trial of the Chicago 7, released in 2020, which was based on a script he had written in 2007. Producers Steven Spielberg, Walter F. Parkes, and Laurie MacDonald collaborated on the development of Sorkin's script, with Spielberg intending to direct the film. Sacha Baron Cohen was originally cast as Abbie Hoffman, while Spielberg approached Will Smith for the role of Bobby Seale, and planned to meet with Heath Ledger about playing Tom Hayden. The Writers Guild of America strike, which started in November 2007 and lasted 100 days, Paul Greengrass in Talks for Aaron Sorkin-Penned 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' , Rebecca Ford, The Hollywood Reporter, 23 July 2013.Retrieved: 26 April 2015. delayed filming and the project was suspended. Sorkin was later to continue to rewrite the script for Spielberg, and the director intended to mostly cast unknowns to keep the budget down. Paul Greengrass and Ben Stiller were rumored as replacement directors, but the project did not move forward until Sorkin agreed to direct the project himself. The film was eventually released in 2020, distributed by Netflix. Top-name actors Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance, Michael Keaton, Eddie Redmayne, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Frank Langella were featured in the cast. ===Theatre and plays=== *In 1972, playwright and screenwriter David Petersen's play Little Orphan Abbie based on the transcript of the trial, opened in Seattle, directed by Jody Briggs and starring Glenn Mazen. It got good reviews and sold out every night; its run was extended twice. It was slated for production in New York by director Joe Papp, but had to be postponed and finally cancelled due to extended runs of other plays. It was later produced in Los Angeles, first on stage at the Burbage Theater, directed by Ron Hunter. It was later shot for television by Telemedia Productions, directed by Dick Studebaker. The television version used stock footage of the events in the parks and on the streets of Chicago during the riots. *In 1993, British playwright John Goodchild adapted the original trial transcripts for a radio play produced by L.A. Theatre Works, titled The Chicago Conspiracy Trial. Its cast included David Schwimmer (Abbie Hoffman), Tom Amandes (Richard Schultz), George Murdock (Judge Julius Hoffman), and Mike Nussbaum (William Kunstler). The play received an award at the New York Television Festival in 1993. ===Art=== On November 5, 1969, Richard Avedon made his first wall-sized mural portrait of the Chicago Seven in what appears to be a police-like line- up before the trial is completed. It was first exhibited at the Minneapolis Institute of Art in the summer of 1970 and has since been exhibited in museums around the world. Avedon called the group of defendants \\"heroic.\\" Menand, Louis, \\"This is the End,\\" (2012) Murals and Portraits (New York: Gagosian Gallery) ==See also== *Seattle Liberation Front *Days of Rage *Pigasus (politics) ==References== ==Further reading== ;Five editions of excerpts from the transcript of the trial have been published: * Edited by Judy Clavir and John Spitzer.

It also helps people write advance healthcare directives and living trusts in California. ==Mission== FreeWill is a Public Benefit Corporation founded at Stanford University in 2017 by Jennifer Xia Spradling and Patrick Schmitt. It has two social missions: The first is to create access to estate planning for all individuals regardless of their backgrounds or ability to pay. The second is to make it easy for people to leave money to charity. As a Public Benefit Corporation, they are legally obligated to pursue their social missions in addition to seeking financial return. The idea for FreeWill stemmed from cofounder Patrick Schmitt‚Äôs time working on fundraising campaigns for the Democratic National Committee where he learned how remove friction points in the donation process and increase individual donations. When it came time for Schmitt to do his own estate planning, he wondered why nobody had made it similarly easy to build charitable donations into your will. FreeWill's founders were featured in Town & Country's Top Philanthropists in 2019. ==Business model== Hundreds of charities pay a few thousand dollars to $50,000 per year in order to have the charity's name included in the software, and receive reports of the name, address, assets, and planned bequest for each donor who agrees. Donors are not required to leave money to charity. For donors who do not release information to the charity, FreeWill can still send the charity aggregate data, and they do not say how much detail these aggregates have. Unlike most estate planning, the software asks users specifically if they want to give to charities, and automatically looks up an accurate EIN and address of subscribing charities, which users would otherwise find on their own. The company's products include wills, durable financial power of attorney, qualified charitable distributions, stock donations. and living wills (also known as advance healthcare directives or healthcare power of attorney). Most estate lawyers would prepare a living trust to keep the estate private and out of probate. FreeWill offers a living trust only in California. After entering all will information, users have options to download the will; or get more information; or see a lawyer, in which case the site offers the American Bar Association directory of all lawyers. Users with over $10 million in assets and users in California also see a suggestion that they see a lawyer. If users ask for more information the site makes no recommendations, but notes that some people prefer to use a lawyer if they are getting divorced, or have out-of-state property, a business, a dependent with a disability, someone who may contest the will, children from multiple marriages, a premarital agreement, a caregiver as beneficiary, or assets over the estate tax exemption. They do not give reasons why any of these calls for a lawyer, but others say that having a lawyer involved is good protection against anyone questioning whether the decedent was mentally qualified. Others say that having any house, not just one out of state, calls for a lawyer. ==Market== As of March 2020, 50,000 people have prepared wills on the platform, 19% have included bequests to charities, and bequests average $111,000. The planned bequests total $1 billion. The largest numbers of donations have been for the American Red Cross, United Way, Defenders of Wildlife and Disabled American Veterans. The average user is 57 years old. FreeWill expects to expand to Canada, Western Europe, Australia, Japan and China. ==Privacy== While lawyers are involved in writing the software, FreeWill is not a law firm and does not have an attorney-client relationship with customers. Privacy statements let the company store information on assets, children bequests, medical and religious preferences and use them to target ads and fundraising appeals. \\"interest-based advertising;... organizations and their planned giving consultants to facilitate and report donations\\" FreeWill explicitly advises charities to use information they receive from the software to build relationships with potential donors and raise more money. For these purposes, FreeWill collects total assets, age and address, as well as information used in writing the will and living will. They track visits and actions elsewhere on the web over time, and ignore Do Not Track requests. FreeWill will transfer their information to any larger company which acquires them. They can amend the privacy statement by posting a notice on the site. FreeWill says it uses modern security protocols. They acknowledge that information can escape in security breaches, for which they do not accept liability. ==Competition== FreeWill is free to users. Its competitors include other online services, some free, some offering trusts and other services. One competitor offers downloadable software so the software company does not see users' wills and trusts, which is available from libraries, This downloadable competitor is linked from some nonprofits' websites, as FreeWill is. Competitors also include lawyers, with flat fees of $1,200-$2,000, and there are lawyer rating systems such as Martindale-Hubbell. Members and dependents of the US military have access to lawyers at Judge Advocate offices. Consumer Reports notes that people resist hiring a lawyer for a will, even though they hire professionals for hairdressing, mowing and tax preparation. Lawyers have boilerplate wording, which they adjust for almost every client. The lawyer's work is confidential, under Attorney‚Äìclient privilege, and liability is covered by errors and omissions insurance in case of problems. In Britain, competition includes free wills from solicitors and from the online firm, Bequeathed. Lawyers have said that a will and trust created by software are better and faster than none, though not as good as a custom product and counsel from a lawyer. ==Dispute resolution== FreeWill, like other companies which produce will-writing software, disclaims liability for errors and omissions in their software; they also note that laws change rapidly. If people nevertheless have disputes with the company, the users and company agree to use small claims courts or individual arbitration in New York City under \\"Commercial Arbitration Rules that contemplate in-person hearings.\\" The company's offices are in New York City, and it is incorporated in Delaware. ==References== ","title":"FreeWill"},{"id":"306238","text":"UFP is an abbreviation that has several meanings: * Ultrafine particle, a particulate matter of nanoscale size (less than 100 nanometres in diameter) * Union des forces progressistes, a former Canadian left-wing political party of Quebec * Union of Forces of Progress, a former political party in Benin * Union of the Forces of Progress (Union des Forces du Progr√®s), a political party in Mauritania * United Federal Party, a former political party of Southern Rhodesia from 1934 to 1965 * United Federation of Planets, of the fictional Star Trek universe. * University Foundation Programme, a one-year intensive course that leads to entry to a wide range of universities in the United Kingdom * United Future Party, a South Korean conservative political party.

Drew moved with his family to Louisiana and then in 1818 to Arkansas. He worked as a traveling salesman and school teacher. Drew first settled in Clark County and was appointed Clark County Clerk in 1823. In 1827 he moved to Pocahontas, Arkansas, and married Cinderella Bettis, daughter of the properous founder of that town, Ransom Bettis. His father-in-law gave the newly weds of bottom land in Cherokee Bay where the town of Biggers lies in what is now Randolph County (then Lawrence County.) The Drews prospered and their plantation included 20 African-American slaves. In 1832, Drew was elected County Judge of Lawrence County. In 1835, Drew and Bettis convinced the Arkansas Territorial Legislature to create Randolph County out of Lawrence County. In 1836, Drew and Bettis held an infamous free bar-b-que complete with free liquor for the entire county in Pocahontas (then known as Bettis Bluff). The grateful attendees the next day chose Pocahontas as the county seat in an upset election over the more populated community of Columbia. That same year, Drew gave the county land in downtown Pocahontas where a courthouse was constructed. In 1836 he was chosen as a delegate to the Arkansas Constitutional Convention. He was elected Governor in 1844 as a Democrat, supported by the Conway-Sevier Faction that ruled Arkansas from territorial days to the 1850s. His administration concentrated on the state's financial solvency and attempted to repair the state's credit and party disunity. Other achievements of his first administration were Arkansas becoming the first southern state to declare Thanksgiving to be a state holiday, and, at Cinderella's urging, he had legislation passed so that Arkansas became the first southern state to declare the property a woman brought to a marriage to be her own and not her husband's. Drew was reelected in 1848. In 1849 he dispatched a militia to Marion County to put down the Tutt-Everett War. Drew only served a year of his second term before resigning due to the low salary provided for the governor. He retired from politics and worked to try and recover from financial losses. He was living in Sebastian County, Arkansas,in 1860.1860 Arkansas Census but eventually Texas, initially to Weatherford, Texas, and later to Hood County. Drew died in January 1879 at Lipan, Texas. Drew was originally buried in the Old Baptist Cemetery in Lipan, but his body was removed in 1923 by Arkansas officials and moved to the Masonic Cemetery in Pocahontas, where he rests today along with Bettis, Cinderella, and several of the Drew Children. Drew County, Arkansas was named for him. ==References== ==External links== * Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture entry: Thomas Stevenson Drew Category:Governors of Arkansas Category:People from Wilson County, Tennessee Category:People from Randolph County, Arkansas Category:Arkansas Democrats Category:1802 births Category:1879 deaths ","title":"Thomas Stevenson Drew"},{"id":"306245","text":"Samuel Adams (June 5, 1805 ‚Äì February 27, 1850) was an American politician who served as acting governor of Arkansas from April to November 1844. ==Early life== Adams was born in Halifax County, Virginia. He moved to Arkansas in 1835, where he became a planter and was active in state politics. ==Political career== Adams was a Democrat, and was elected to the Arkansas Senate in 1840. He was reelected and served as president of the Senate during his second term. On April 29, 1844, Governor Archibald Yell resigned from his office to run for the U.S. House of Representatives. Adams, who was president of the Arkansas Senate at that time, became Acting Governor of Arkansas and served until November 5, 1844. During his short term he focused on internal improvements and education, and left a surplus in the state treasury when he left office.

In its history it has had to deal with various concepts and systems of governance, from the Roman Empire to the medieval divine right of kings, from nineteenth- and twentieth-century concepts of democracy and pluralism to the appearance of left- and right-wing dictatorial regimes. The Second Vatican Council's decree Dignitatis humanae stated that religious freedom is a civil right that should be recognized in constitutional law. ==Catholicism and the Roman Emperors== Christianity emerged in the 1st century as one of many new religions in the Roman Empire. Early Christians were persecuted as early as 64 A.D. when Nero ordered large numbers of Christians executed in retaliation for the Great Fire of Rome. Christianity remained a growing, albeit, minority religion in the empire for several centuries. Roman persecutions of Christians climaxed due to Emperor Diocletian till the turn of the 4th century. Following Constantine the Great's victory on Milvian Bridge, which he attributed to a Christian omen he saw in the sky, the Edict of Milan declared that the empire would no longer sanction persecution of Christians. Following Constantine's deathbed conversion in 337 all emperors adopted Christianity, except for Julian the Apostate who, during his brief reign, attempted unsuccessfully to re-instate paganism. In the Christian era (more properly the era of the first seven Ecumenical Councils, 325-787) the Church came to accept that it was the emperor's duty to use secular power to enforce religious unity. Anyone within the Church who did not subscribe to Catholic Christianity was seen as a threat to the dominance and purity of \\"the one true faith\\" and emperors saw it as their right to defend this by all means at their disposal.\\"The First Christian Theologians: An Introduction to Theology in the Early Church\\", Edited by Gillian Rosemary Evans, contributor Clarence Gallagher SJ, \\"The Imperial Ecclesiastical Lawgivers\\", p. 68, Blackwell Publishing, 2004, Beginning with Edward Gibbon in The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire some historians have taken the view that Christianity weakened the Roman Empire through its failure to preserve the pluralistic structure of the state. Pagans and Jews lost interest and the Church drew the most able men into its organisation to the detriment of the state.On Pagans, Jews, and Christians, Arnaldo Momigliano, p. 158, ==The papacy and the Divine Right of Kings== The doctrine of the divine right of kings came to dominate mediaeval concepts of kingship, claiming biblical authority (Epistle to the Romans, chapter 13). Augustine of Hippo in his work The City of God had stated his opinion that while the City of Man and the City of God may stand at cross-purposes, both of them have been instituted by God and served His ultimate will. Even though the City of Man ‚Äì the world of secular government ‚Äì may seem ungodly and be governed by sinners, it has been placed on earth for the protection of the City of God. Therefore, monarchs have been placed on their thrones for God's purpose, and to question their authority is to question God. It is worth mentioning that Augustine also said \\"a law that is not just, seems to be no law at all\\" and Thomas Aquinas indicated laws \\"opposed to the Divine good\\" must not be observed. This belief in the god-given authority of monarchs was central to the Roman Catholic vision of governance in the Middle Ages, Renaissance and Ancien R√©gime. But this was most true of what would later be termed the ultramontaine party and the Catholic Church has recognized republics, on an exceptional basis, as early as 1291 in the case of San Marino. During early medieval times, a near- monopoly of the Church in matters of education and of literary skills accounts for the presence of churchmen as their advisors. This tradition continued even as education became more widespread. Prominent examples of senior members of the church hierarchy who advised monarchs were Cardinal Thomas Wolsey in England, and Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin in France; prominent, devoutly Catholic laymen like Sir Thomas More also served as senior advisors to monarchs. Besides advising monarchs, the Church held direct power in mediaeval society as a landowner, a power-broker, a policy maker, etc. Some of its bishops and archbishops were feudal lords in their own right, equivalent in rank and precedence to counts and dukes. Some were even sovereigns in their own right, while the Pope himself ruled the Papal States. Three archbishops played a prominent role in Holy Roman Empire as electors. As late as the 18th century in the era of the Enlightenment, Jacques-Benigne Bossuet, preacher to Louis XIV, defended the doctrine of the divine right of kings and absolute monarchy in his sermons. The Church was a model of hierarchy in a world of hierarchies, and saw the defense of that system as its own defense, and as a defense of what it believed to be a god-ordained system. During the French Wars of Religion, the monarchomachs began to contest the divine right of kings, setting up the bases for the theory of popular sovereignty and theorizing the right of tyrannicides. ===The French Revolution=== The central principle of the medieval, Renaissance, and ancien r√©gime periods, monarchical rule \\"by God's will\\", was fundamentally challenged by the 1789 French Revolution. The revolution began as a conjunction of a need to fix French national finances and a rising middle class who resented the privileges of the clergy (in their role as the First Estate) and nobility (in their role as the Second Estate). The pent-up frustrations caused by lack of political reform over a period of generations led the revolution to spiral in ways unimaginable only a few years earlier, and indeed unplanned and unanticipated by the initial wave of reformers. Almost from the start, the revolution was a direct threat to clerical and noble privilege: the legislation that abolished the feudal privileges of the Church and nobility dates from August 4, 1789, a mere three weeks after the fall of the Bastille (although it would be several years before this legislation came fully into effect). At the same time, the revolution also challenged the theological basis of royal authority. The doctrine of popular sovereignty directly challenged the former divine right of kings. The king was to govern on behalf of the people, and not under the orders of God. This philosophical difference over the basis of royal and state power was paralleled by the rise of a short-lived democracy, but also by a change first from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy and finally to republicanism. Under the doctrine of the divine right of kings, only the Church or God could interfere with the right of a monarch to rule. Thus the attack on the French absolute monarchy was seen as an attack on God's anointed king. In addition, the Church's leadership came largely from the classes most threatened by the growing revolution. The upper clergy came from the same families as the upper nobility, and the Church was, in its own right, the largest landowner in France. The revolution was widely seen, both by its proponents and its opponents, as the fruition of the (profoundly secular) ideas of the Enlightenment. The 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, voted by the National Constituent Assembly, seemed to some in the church to mark the appearance of the antichrist, in that they excluded Christian morality from the new \\"natural order\\". The fast-moving nature of the revolution far outpaced Roman Catholicism's ability to adapt or come to any terms with the revolutionaries. In speaking of \\"the Church and the Revolution\\" it is important to keep in mind that neither the Church nor the Revolution were monolithic. There were class interests and differences of opinion inside the Church as well as out, with many of the lower clergy ‚Äì and a few bishops, such as Talleyrand ‚Äì among the key supporters of the early phases of the revolution. The Civil Constitution of the Clergy, which turned Church lands into state property and the clergy into employees of the state, created a bitter division within the church between those \\"jurors\\" who took the required oath of allegiance to the state (the abb√© Gr√©goire or Pierre Daunou) and the \\"non-jurors\\" who refused to do so. A majority of parish priests, but only four bishops, took the oath. As a large-scale landowner tied closely to the doomed ancien regime, led by people from the aristocracy, and philosophically opposed to many of the fundamental principles of the revolution, the Church, like the absolute monarchy and the feudal nobility, was a target of the revolution even in the early phases, when leading revolutionaries such as Lafayette were still well-disposed toward King Louis XVI as an individual. Instead of being able to influence the new political elite and so shape the public agenda, the Church found itself sidelined at best, detested at worst. As the revolution became more radical, the new state and its leaders set up its own rival deities and religion, a Cult of Reason and, later, a deistic cult of the Supreme Being, closing many Catholic churches, transforming cathedrals into \\"temples of reason\\", disbanding monasteries and often destroying their buildings (as at Cluny), and seizing their lands. In this process many hundreds of Catholic priests were killed, further polarising revolutionaries and the Church. The revolutionary leadership also devised a revolutionary calendar to displace the Christian months and the seven-day week with its sabbath. Catholic reaction, in anti-revolutionary risings such as the revolt in the Vend√©e, were often bloodily suppressed. ===France after the Revolution=== When Napoleon Bonaparte came to power in 1799, he began the process of coming back to terms with the Catholic Church. The Church was reestablished in power during the Bourbon Restoration, with the ultra-royalists voting laws such as the Anti-Sacrilege Act. The Church was then strongly counter-revolutionary, opposing all changes made by the 1789 Revolution. The July Revolution of 1830 marked the end of any hope of a return to the ancien regime status of an absolute monarchy, by establishing a constitutional monarchy. The most reactionary aristocrats, in favor of an integral restoration of the Ancien R√©gime and known as Legitimists, began to retire from political life. However, Napoleon III's regime did support the Pope, helping to restore Pope Pius IX as ruler of the Papal States in 1849 after there had been a revolt there in 1848. Despite this official move, the process of secularization continued throughout the 20th century, culminating with the Jules Ferry laws in the 1880s and then with the 1905 law on separation of Church and state, which definitively established state secularism (known as la√Øcit√©). The Church itself remained associated with the Comte de Chambord, the Legitimist pretender to the throne. It was only under Pope Leo XIII (r: 1878-1903) that the Church leadership tried to move away from its anti-Republican associations, when he ordered the deeply unhappy French Church to accept the Third French Republic (1875‚Äì1940) (Inter innumeras sollicitudines encyclical of 1892). However, his liberalising initiative was undone by Pope Pius X (r: 1903-1914), a traditionalist who had more sympathy for the French monarchists than for the Third Republic. ===Catholicism in the United Kingdom and Ireland=== Following William of Orange's victories over King James II, by 1691 the supremacy of Protestantism was entrenched throughout the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland. The economic and political power of Catholics, especially in Ireland, was severely curtailed. This was reinforced by the introduction of the Penal Laws. The practice of Catholicism (including the celebration of the Mass) was made illegal as Catholic priests celebrated the sacraments at risk of execution by law. However, towards the end of the eighteenth century a rapprochement began to develop between London and the Vatican. Britain's activities abroad and relations with Catholic countries were hampered by the tension that existed between it and the Church, and it was eager to persuade the Church to end its moral support for Irish separatism. Likewise, the Church was keen to send missionaries to the newly conquered colonies of the British Empire, especially Africa and India, and to ease the restrictions on its British and Irish adherents. Britain began to phase out the penal laws, and in 1795 it financed the building of St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, a seminary for the training of Catholic priests, in County Kildare. In return, the Church agreed to actively oppose Irish separatism, which it duly did in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. It continued this policy until the early 1900s, condemning each successive attempt by Irish republicanism to achieve independence from Britain through violence. ===Pius IX and Italian unification=== Over the course of the 19th century, Italian nationalism put increasing strain on the Pope's rule of the Papal States. Italian unification culminated in Garibaldi's capture of Rome in 1870, which ended the Catholic Church's temporal sovereignty and led Pope Pius IX to declare himself a prisoner in the Vatican. The conflict between the Italian state and the Papacy continued with the state's regulation of the Church and the Pope's voting and parliamentary boycott, and was finally resolved in 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between Mussolini and Pope Pius XI, confirming the Vatican City-State and accepting the loss of the Papal States.. ===Leo XIII=== Pope Leo XIII, responding to the rise of popular democracy, tried a new and somewhat more sophisticated approach to political questions than his predecessor Pius IX. On May 15, 1891, Leo issued the encyclical Rerum novarum (Latin: \\"About New Things\\"). This addressed the transformation of politics and society during the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century. The document criticised capitalism, complaining of the exploitation of the masses in industry. However, it also sharply reproved the socialist concept of class struggle, and the proposed solution of eliminating private property. Leo called for strong governments to protect their citizens from exploitation, and urged Roman Catholics to apply principles of social justice in their own lives. This document was rightly seen as a profound change in the political thinking of the Holy See. It drew on the economic thought of St Thomas Aquinas, who taught that the \\"just price\\" in a marketplace should not be allowed to fluctuate due to temporary shortages or gluts. Seeking a principle to replace the threatening Marxist doctrine of class struggle, Rerum Novarum urged social solidarity between the upper and lower classes, and endorsed nationalism as a way of preserving traditional morality, customs, and folkways. In effect, Rerum Novarum proposed a kind of corporatism, the organisation of political power along industrial lines, similar to the mediaeval guild system. Under corporatism, the individual's place in society is determined by the ethnic, work, and social groups which one was born into or joined. Leo rejected one-person, one-vote democracy in favour of representation by interest groups. A strong government should serve as arbiter among the competing factions. Forty years later, the corporatist tendencies of Rerum Novarum were underscored by Pope Pius XI's May 25, 1931, encyclical Quadragesimo anno (\\"In the Fortieth Year\\"), which restated the hostility of Rerum Novarum to both unbridled competition and class struggle. The precepts of Leo and Pius were espoused by the Catholic social movement of Distributism, which later influenced the Fascist and Christian Democratic movements. ==The Church and the twentieth century== Early in the 20th century, the Catholic Church supported anti-democratic regimes, such as in Spain's National Catholicism. By the end of the century, countries that had once been heavily influenced by the Catholic Church became more secular and democratic (e.g,, Spain, Italy, Ireland). === Croatia === Ivan Grubi≈°iƒá, a Catholic priest and a member of the Croatian Parliament fought for termination or revision of the Treaties between the Republic of Croatia and the Holy See, which were deemed to unbalance the relations between the Church and the Croatian state. ===Spain=== In Spain, the Falange enjoyed the support of many in the Roman Catholic Church. Spain had a long history of contention between Catholic, largely monarchist, traditionalists and advocates of secular liberal democracy, or of more radical anticlerical views. Traditionalist Catholics, already alienated by the liberal secularism of the Second Spanish Republic whose democratically elected government imposed limitations and intrusions upon the Church, were moved to outright hostility by what they viewed as the government's failure to prevent or punish attacks on churches and the killing of priests and other religious by various Republican armed groups. Almost 7,000 clergy were killed, despite even though very few clergy actively engaged in the opposition to the Republic. These attacks were frequent in the first months of the civil war, and radicalised a large number of Catholics, including clergy, who had previously tended to support the reformist right wing Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right party. A number of Catholics decided that the liberal state could not (or would not) protect them or their Church and switched to supporting the rebel Nationalists, led by General Francisco Franco. The Church's association with monarchists was particularly clear in the case of Carlism, which sought to place monarchs from a rival lineage on the throne. Basque nationalism, on the contrary, saw the majority of Basque priests break ranks with the Church to support the Republican government. This led to Franco branding them as traitors and communists. After taking power in 1936, Franco received political privileges from the Church similar to those accorded Spanish monarchs, such as the right to propose three candidates for each episcopal vacancy, from which the Pope would select a bishop. In processions, Franco was also covered by a pallium, a cloak conferred by the pope and usually indicating top ecclesiastical status. During the 1960s and the 1970s, the movement of worker priests expressed the view of young priests unhappy with the hierarchy and the government. They organized parishes as social betterment centers. The contacts with Marxism led many to join leftist groups or to secularize. An agreement of Church and State turned one seminary into a special jail for prisoners who were priests. ===France=== The pro-Catholic movement Action Fran√ßaise (AF) campaigned for the return of the monarchy and for aggressive action against Jews, as well as a corporatist system. It was supported by a strong section of the clerical hierarchy, eleven out of seventeen cardinals and bishops. On the other hand, many Catholics regarded the AF with distrust, and in 1926, Pope Pius XI explicitly condemned the organization. Several writings of Charles Maurras', the leading ideologist of AF and an agnostic, were placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum at the same time. However, in 1939 Pope Pius XII waived the condemnation. Maurras' personal secretary, Jean Ousset, later went on to found the Cit√© catholique fundamentalist organization along with former members of the OAS terrorist group created in defense of \\"French Algeria\\" during the Algerian War. ===Ireland=== The Roman Catholic Church was granted \\"special recognition\\" in the Constitution of Ireland when it was drawn up in 1937, although other religions were also mentioned. This remained the case until 1972, when the constitution was amended by plebiscite. In 1950 the Church helped force the resignation of the Minister for Health Noel Browne over his proposals to provide free healthcare to mothers and children, which the Church believed would result in promotion of birth control. The Government of Northern Ireland gave the Church considerably more responsibility for education than they enjoyed in the Republic and this remains the case today. The considerable influence of the Church over Irish politics since independence in 1922 declined sharply in the 1990s after a series of child- abuse scandals. In recent decades, the Church has lost ground to the secular movement in social issues such as divorce and abortion. ===Elsewhere in Europe=== The association of Roman Catholicism, sometimes in the form of the hierarchical church, sometimes in the form of lay Catholic organisations acting independently of the hierarchy, produced links to dictatorial governments in various states. * In Austria, Engelbert Dollfuss turned a Roman Catholic political party into the single party of a one-party state. In rural Austria the Catholic Christian Social Party collaborated with the Heimwehr militia and helped bring Dollfuss to power in 1932. In June 1934, he produced his authoritarian constitution which stated \\"We shall establish a state on the basis of a Christian Weltanschauung\\". The Pope described Dollfuss as a \\"Christian, giant-hearted man ... who rules Austria so well, so resolutely and in such a Christian manner. His actions are witness to Catholic visions and convictions. The Austrian people, Our beloved Austria, now has the government it deserves\\". * In Poland, in 1920s J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski founded a military-style government (Sanacja) that incorporated Catholic corporatism into its ideology. After the Second World War the Catholic Church was a focal point of opposition to the Communist regime. Many Catholic priests were arrested or disappeared for opposing the communist regime of People's Republic of Poland. Pope John Paul II encouraged opposition to the Communist regime in such a way that it would not draw retaliation, becoming (in a quote from CNN) \\"a resilient enemy of Communism and champion of human rights, a powerful preacher and sophisticated intellectual able to defeat Marxists in their own line of dialogue.\\" After the fall of the Soviet Union, Poland became a multiparty democracy and several parties which professed to defend Catholicism were legalised, like Akcja Wyborcza Solidarno≈õƒá or Liga Polskich Rodzin. ===Fascism=== For strategic reasons, it was desirable for the fascist movements of Benito Mussolini in Italy and Hitler in Germany not to alienate Catholics en masse. Modern researchers are divided on the degree of the Church's connection to fascism. Usually historians of the period reject claims of active complicity or active resistance, painting a picture of a Catholic leadership who chose neutrality or mild resistance over an explicit ideological struggle with fascism. The closest ties of Roman Catholicism to fascism may have come in the clerical fascism in wartime Croatia; see Involvement of Croatian Catholic clergy with the Ustasa regime. Italy In 1924, Pope Pius XI forbade the Catholic Popular Party to work with the Socialist Party against Mussolini's Fascist Party (whose politics at that time were a complex amalgam of left and right). The pope later dissolved the Catholic Popular Party . Fear of communism, and a certain disdain for the liberal democracy that had revoked the long-standing privileges enjoyed by the Catholic Church, were made explicit in such papal documents as Quanta cura and the Syllabus of Errors. These documents have been interpreted by some as showing Church support for Fascism, or at least with leanings toward fascism. By the Lateran Treaties, Mussolini granted Pope Pius XI the crown of Vatican City as a nation to rule, made Roman Catholicism the state church of Italy, and paid the Pope compensation for the loss of the Papal States. This indicates a de facto recognition by the Pope of Mussolini's coup. The relationship to Mussolini's government deteriorated drastically in later years. Germany The division of Germans between Catholicism and Protestantism has figured into German politics since the Protestant Reformation. The Kulturkampf that followed German unification was the defining dispute between the German state and Catholicism. In Weimar Germany, the Centre Party was the Catholic political party. It disbanded around the time of the signing of the Reichskonkordat (1933), the treaty that continues to regulate church-state relations to this day. Pius XI's encyclical Mit brennender Sorge (1937) protested what it perceived to be violations of the Reichskonkordat. The role of Catholic bishops in Nazi Germany remains a controversial aspect of the study of Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust. Slovakia During World War II, Jozef Tiso, a Roman Catholic monsigneur, became the Nazi quisling in Slovakia. Tiso was head of state and the security forces, as well as the leader of the paramilitary Hlinka Guard, which wore the Catholic Episcopal cross on its armbands. The Catholic clergy was represented at all levels of the regime and its corporatist ideology was based on papal encyclicals. Croatia Mile Budak, the Minister of Religion of Independent State of Croatia, said on 22 July 1941: :The Ustashi movement is based on the Catholic Religion. For the minorities, Serbs, Jews and Gypsies, we have three million bullets. A part of these minorities has already been eliminated and many are waiting to be killed. Some will be sent to Serbia and the rest will be forced to change their religion to Catholicism. Our new Croatia will therefore be free of all heretics, becoming purely Catholic for the future years. Notice the absence of a mention of Bosnian Muslims. Unlike Serbs, they were considered Croatian brothers whose ancestors converted to Islam. Controversy surrounds the depths of the involvement of the Roman Catholic clergy with the Usta≈°e, a Croatian Fascist movement in the former Yugoslavia. According to Branko Bokun, a Roman Catholic priest made the following remarks on 13 June 1941: The issue of clerical fascism in wartime Croatia is further discussed in the article Involvement of Croatian Catholic clergy with the Usta≈°a regime. Belgium The Belgian Fascist movement Rexism arose out of a conservative Catholic movement and its publications. The full names of the Rexists was Christus Rex or \\"Christ the King\\". ===United States=== Prior to 1961, the U.S. had never had a Catholic president. Many Protestants were afraid that if a Catholic were elected president, he would take orders directly from the Pope. This was one reason why Al Smith, the Democratic governor of New York, lost the 1928 presidential election to Herbert Hoover. The surprise bestseller of 1949‚Äì1950 was American Freedom and Catholic Power by Paul Blanshard.Catholicism and American freedom: a history By John T. McGreevy. WW Norton p. 166 Blanshard accused the Catholic Church hierarchy of having an undue influence on legislation, education and medical practice. Years later, John F. Kennedy, spoke to a convention of Baptist pastors in Louisiana during his election campaign. He assured them that, if elected, he would put his country before his religion. Since the late 1960s, the Catholic Church has been politically active in the U.S. around the \\"life issues\\" of abortion, assisted suicide and euthanasia, with some bishops and priests refusing communion to Catholic politicians who publicly advocate for legal abortion. This has created a stigma within the Church itself however. The church has also played significant roles in the fights over capital punishment, gay marriage, welfare, state secularism, various \\"peace and justice\\" issues, among many others. Its role varies from area to area depending upon the size of the Catholic Church in a particular region and on the region's predominant ideology. For example, a Catholic church in the Southern U.S. would be more likely to be against universal health care than a Catholic church in New England. Robert Drinan, a Catholic priest, served five terms in Congress as a Democrat from Massachusetts before the Holy See forced him to choose between giving up his seat in Congress or being laicized. The 1983 Code of Canon Law forbids Catholic priests from holding political office anywhere in the world. === Argentina === Secularism was enforced in Argentina in 1884 when President Julio Argentino Roca passed Law 1420 on secular education. In 1955, the Catholics nationalists overthrew General Per√≥n in the \\"Revoluci√≥n Libertadora\\", and a concordat was signed in 1966. Catholic nationalists continued to play an important role in the politics of Argentina, while the Church itself was accused of having set up ratlines to organize the escape of former Nazis after WWII. Furthermore, several important Catholic figures have been accused of having supported the \\"Dirty War\\" in the 1970s, including Pope Francis, then-Archbishop of Buenos Aires. Antonio Caggiano, Archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1959 to 1975, was close to the fundamentalist Cit√© catholique organisation, and introduced Jean Ousset (former personal secretary of Charles Maurras, the leader of the Action fran√ßaise)'s theories on counter-revolutionary warfare and \\"subversion\\" in Argentina.Quoted by Horacio Verbitsky, in The Silence, extract transl. in English made available by openDemocracy: Breaking the silence: the Catholic Church in Argentina and the \\"dirty war\\" , July 28, 2005, p.4 === Brazil === ===Australia=== Traditionally, Catholics in Australia had been predominantly of Irish descent. They have also been traditionally in the working-class. As a result, for much of its early history, the Australian Labor Party had a significant proportion of Catholics as members and supporters. However, this historical link has eroded over time and Catholics are now present across the political spectrum. Prominent Archbishop Daniel Mannix was perhaps the most politically vocal Catholic figure, including his opposition to conscription. This conscription debate was often framed in terms of a divide between Protestants and Catholics. Links between the Catholic Church and Australian politics strengthened when the Australian Labor Party split and the Democratic Labour Party was founded, chiefly under the influence of Bob Santamaria. In one state, the Catholic Church threw its institutional support behind this party and the movements upon which it relied. However, after the Archbishop died, the party and the Industrial groups upon which it was based no longer had any Church support. === International law === In 2003, Pope John Paul II became a prominent critic of the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq. He sent his \\"Peace Minister\\", Cardinal Pio Laghi, to talk with US President George W. Bush to express opposition to the war. John Paul II said that it was up to the United Nations to solve the international conflict through diplomacy and that a unilateral aggression is a crime against peace and a violation of international law. ==Communism== Pope John Paul II offered support to the Polish Solidarity movement. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev once said the collapse of the Iron Curtain would have been impossible without John Paul II. But Catholic attitudes toward communism have evolved and Pope Francis has taken the focus off ideologies and placed it on the sufferings of people under both systems, with the hope-filled conclusion: \\"There is a Christian communism and a Christian capitalism.\\" == See also == *Caesaropapism *Category:Catholic political parties *Estates of the realm *Gallicanism *Guelph *History of the Roman Catholic Church *Missi dominici *Separation of church and state *Theocracy *Weiblingen *Integralism ¬ß Catholic integralism ==References== secular movement Category:History of the Catholic Church Category:Catholicism and politics ","title":"Relations between the Catholic Church and the state"},{"id":"306254","text":"Spearfisher Monument in Croatia Spearfishing is a method of fishing that has been used throughout the world for millennia. Early civilizations were familiar with the custom of spearing fish from rivers and streams using sharpened sticks. Currently spearfishing makes use of elastic powered spearguns and slings, or compressed gas pneumatic powered spearguns, to strike the hunted fish. Specialised techniques and equipment have been developed for various types of aquatic environments and target fish. Spearfishing may be done using free-diving, snorkelling, or scuba diving techniques, but spearfishing while using scuba equipment is illegal in some countries. The use of mechanically powered spearguns is also outlawed in some countries and jurisdictions. Spearfishing is highly selective, normally uses no bait and has no by-catch. ==History== alt=Photo of painting displaying man standing on boat with two small dogs, pointing spear at fish The Hawaiians spearfisher.

Cosquer Cave in Southern France contains cave art over 16,000 years old, including drawings of seals which appear to have been harpooned. There are references to fishing with spears in ancient literature; though, in most cases, the descriptions do not go into detail. An early example from the Bible is in Job 41:7: Canst thou fill his [Leviathan] skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?. The Greek historian Polybius (ca 203 BC‚Äì120 BC), in his Histories, describes hunting for swordfish by using a harpoon with a barbed and detachable head.Polybius, \\"Fishing for Swordfish\\", Histories Book 34.3 (Evelyn S.

Spear fishing is an ancient method of fishing and may be conducted with an ordinary spear or a specialised variant such as an eel spear or the trident. A small trident- type spear with a long handle is used in the American South and Midwest for gigging bullfrogs with a bright light at night, or for gigging carp and other fish in the shallows. ==Modern== Traditional spear fishing is restricted to shallow waters, but the development of the speargun, diving mask and swimfins allows fishing in deeper waters. With practice, some freedivers are able to hold their breath for up to four minutes; a diver with underwater breathing equipment can dive for much longer periods. In the 1920s, sport spearfishing using only watertight swimming goggles became popular on the Mediterranean coast of France and Italy. This led to development of the modern diving mask, fins and snorkel. Modern scuba diving had its genesis in the systematic use of rebreathers by Italian sport spearfishers during the 1930s. This practice came to the attention of the Italian Navy, which developed its frogman unit, which affected World War II. By 1940 small groups of people in California, USA had been spearfishing for less than 10 years. Most used imported gear from Europe, while innovators Charlie Sturgill, Jack Prodanovich, and Wally Potts invented and built innovative equipment for California divers. During the 1960s, attempts to have spearfishing recognised as an Olympic sport were unsuccessful. Instead, two organisations, the International Underwater Spearfishing Association (IUSA) and the International Bluewater Spearfishing Records Committee (IBSRC), list world record catches by species according to rules to ensure fair competition. Spearfishing is illegal in many bodies of water, and some locations only allow spearfishing during certain seasons. ===Conservation=== Spearfishing has been implicated in local disappearances of some species, including the Atlantic goliath grouper on the Caribbean island of Bonaire, the Nassau grouper in the barrier reef off the coast of Belize and the giant black sea bass in California, which have all been listed as endangered . Modern spearfishing has shifted focus onto catching only what one needs and targeting sustainable fisheries. As gear evolved in the 1960s and 1970s spearfishermen typically viewed the ocean as an unlimited resource and often sold their catch. This practice is now heavily frowned upon in prominent spearfishing nations for promoting unsustainable methods and encouraging taking more fish than is needed. In countries such as Australia and South Africa where the activity is regulated by state fisheries, spearfishing has been found to be the most environmentally friendly form of fishing due to being highly selective, having no by-catch, causing no habitat damage, nor creating pollution or harm to protected endangered species. In 2007, the Australian Bluewater Freediving Classic became the first spearfishing tournament to be accredited and was awarded 4 out of 5 stars based on environmental, social, safety and economic indicators. ===Shore diving=== Spearfisherman hunting Yellowfin tuna in the Ryukyu Islands Shore diving is perhaps the most common form of spearfishing http://www.noobspearo.com/the- vault-blog/guide-for-shore-dive-spearfishing- part2/http://ultimatespearfishing.com/page/spearfishing-shore-dive-tips-tricks and simply involves entering and exiting the sea from beaches or headlands and hunting around ocean structures,http://www.noobspearo.com/the-vault- blog/shore-dive-spearfishing-part-1 usually reef, but also rocks, kelp or sand. Usually shore divers hunt at depths of , depending on location. In some locations, divers can experience drop-offs from close to the shore line. Sharks and reef fish can be abundant in these locations. In subtropical areas, sharks may be less common, but other challenges face the shore diver, such as managing entry and exit in the presence of big waves. Headlands are favoured for entry because of their proximity to deeper water, but timing is important so the diver does not get pushed onto rocks by waves. Beach entry can be safer, but more difficult due to the need to repeatedly dive through the waves until the surf line is crossed. Divers may enter from a relatively exposed headland, for convenience, then swim to a more protected part of the shore for their exit from the water. Shore dives produce mainly reef fish, but oceangoing pelagic fish are also caught from shore dives in some places, and can be specifically targeted. Shore diving can be done with trigger-less spears such as pole spears or Hawaiian slings, but more commonly triggered devices such as spearguns. Speargun setups to catch and store fish include speed rigs and fish stringers. ===Boat diving=== Boats, ships, kayaks, or even jetski can be used to access offshore reefs or ocean structure. Man-made structures such as oil rigs and Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) are also fished. Sometimes a boat is necessary to access a location that is close to shore, but inaccessible by land. Methods and gear used for boat diving are similar to shore diving or blue water hunting, depending on the target prey. Boat diving is practised worldwide. Hot spots include Mozambique, the Three Kings islands of New Zealand (yellowtail), Gulf of Mexico oil rigs (cobia, grouper) and the Great Barrier Reef (wahoo, dogtooth tuna). The deepwater fishing grounds off Cape Point, (Cape Town, South Africa) have become popular with trophy hunting, freediving spearfishers in search of Yellowfin Tuna. ===Blue water hunting=== Blue water hunting involves diving in open ocean waters for pelagic species. It involves accessing usually very deep and clear water and chumming for large pelagic fish species such as marlin, tuna, wahoo, or giant trevally. Blue water hunting is often conducted in drifts; the boat driver drops divers and allow them to drift in the current for up to several kilometres before collecting them. Blue water hunters can go for hours without seeing any fish, and without any ocean structure or a visible bottom the divers can experience sensory deprivation and have difficulty determining the size of a solitary fish. One technique to overcome this is to note the size of the fish's eye in relation to its body. Large specimens have a proportionally smaller eye. The creation of the Australian Bluewater Freediving Classic in 1995 in northern New South Wales was a way of creating interest and promotion of this format of underwater hunting, and contributed to the formation of the International Bluewater Spearfishing Records Committee. The IBSRC formed in 1996, was the first dedicated organization worldwide, created by recognized world leaders in blue-water hunting, to record the capture of pelagic species by blue-water hunters. Notably, some blue water hunters use large multi-band wooden guns and make use of breakaway rigs to catch and subdue their prey. If the prey is large and still has fight left after being subdued, a second gun can provide a kill shot at a safe distance. This is acceptable to IBSRC and IUSA regulations as long as the spearo loads it himself in the water. Blue water hunting is conducted worldwide, but notable hot spots include Mozambique (dogtooth tuna, wahoo and giant turrum), South Africa (Yellowfin tuna, Spanish Mackerel, wahoo, marlin and giant turrum), Australia (dogtooth tuna, wahoo and Spanish Mackerel) and the South Pacific (dogtooth tuna). Tanzania has been removed as a notable hot spot as spearfishing is illegal according to the laws and regulations of both Tanzania and Zanzibar. ===Freshwater hunting=== A common carp shot with a band-powered speargun by a diver using snorkelling gear, Minnesota, US Freshwater pike catch in Finland Many US states allow spearfishing in lakes and rivers, but nearly all of them restrict divers to shooting only rough fish such as carp, gar, bullheads, suckers, etc. A few US states do allow the taking of certain gamefish such as sunfish, crappies, striped bass, catfish and walleyes. Freshwater hunters typically have to deal with widely varying seasonal changes in water clarity due to flooding, algae blooms and lake turnover. Some especially hardy midwestern and north central scuba divers go spearfishing under the ice in the winter when water clarity is at its best. In the summer the majority of freshwater spearfishermen use snorkelling gear rather than scuba since many of the fish they pursue are in relatively shallow water. Carp shot by freshwater spear fishermen typically end up being used as fertilizer, bait for trappers, or are occasionally donated to zoos. ===Without diving=== Night spear fishing, Amazon basin, Peru alt=Painting of men in canoes holding torches with trees in the background A alt=Photo of man standing on rock holding spear with spearpoint in the water alt=Photo of man sitting in kayak holding spear in throwing position with right arm raised and right hand extended above and behind his head Spearfishing with a hand-held spear from land, shallow water or boat has been practised for thousands of years. The fisher must account for optical refraction at the water's surface, which makes fish appear higher in their line of sight than they are. By experience, the fisher learns to aim lower. Calm and shallow waters are favored for spearing fish from above the surface, as water clarity is of utmost importance. Many people who grew up on farms in the midwest U.S. in the 1940s-'60s recall going spearing for carp with pitchforks when their fields flooded in the spring. Spearfishing in this manner has some similarities to bowfishing. ==Equipment== This is a list of equipment commonly used in spearfishing. Not all of it is necessary and spearfishing is often practised with minimal gear. ; Speargun: A speargun is an underwater fishing implement designed to fire a spear at fish. The most popular spearguns are powered by natural latex rubber bands, while pneumatic powered guns are also used, but less powerful. ; Polespear: Pole spears, or hand spears, consist of a long shaft with point at one end and an elastic loop at the other for propulsion. They also come in a wide variety, from aluminum or titanium metal, to fiberglass or carbon fiber. Often they are screwed together from smaller pieces or able to be folded down for ease of transport. In 1951 Charlie Sturgill beat the competition (who were all using spearguns) with his own pole spear design. ; Hawaiian slings: Hawaiian slings consist of an elastic band attached to a tube, through which a spear is launched. ; Wet suit: Wetsuits designed specifically for spearfishing are often two-piece (jacket and high waisted pants or 'long-john' style pants with shoulder straps) and are black or are fully or partially camouflage. ; Weight belt or weight vest: These are used to compensate for wetsuit buoyancy and help the diver descend to depth. Rubber belts which can be quickly released in an emergency have proven to be particularly popular for spearfishing worldwide. This is because the rubber stretches when fitted and retracts as the body and wetsuit compress underwater, keeping them in place more effectively than non- stretch webbing belts, which tend to slide around more underwater as they loosen with depth. Most spearfishing equipment manufacturers now offer rubber weight belts. ; Fins: Fins for freedive spearfishing are much longer than those used in scuba to aid in fast ascent. Typically a closed foot design is used by freediving (snorkelling) spearos, usually worn with neoprene socks, while open foot designs (which allow diving boots to be worn) are more popular with scuba divers. ; Knife or cutters: A knife is carried as a safety precaution in case the diver becomes tangled in a spearline or floatline. It can also be used as an ikejime or kill spike. ; Ikejime or kill spike: In lieu of a knife, a sharpened metal spike can be used to kill the fish quickly and humanely upon capture. This action reduces interest from sharks by stopping the fish from thrashing. Ikejime is a Japanese term and is a method traditionally used by Japanese fishermen. Killing the fish quickly is believed to improve the flavor of the flesh by limiting the buildup of adrenaline in the fish's muscles. ; Buoy or float: A buoy is usually tethered to the spearfisher's speargun or directly to the spear. A buoy helps to subdue large fish. It can also assist in storing fish. But is more importantly used as a safety device to warn boat drivers there is diver in the area - usually by being large, brightly colored and flying a dive flag (the red flag with white diagonal stripe in the USA or the blue & white \\"alpha\\" flag elsewhere in the world). A typical spearo dive float will be torpedo-shaped, orange or red in colour with a volume of between 7 and 36 litres and display a dive flag on a short mast. However, other designs, such as inflatable mini-dinghy, planche (box), Tommy Botha (big game) and body-boards are also used. ; Floatline: A floatline connects the buoy to the speargun or to the weight-belt. Often made from braided polyester, they are also frequently made from mono-filament encased in an airtight plastic tube, or made from stretchable bungee cord. ; Gloves: Gloves protect the hands when retrieving fish from coral or rock crevices, when loading the bands on rubber powered spearguns and from the teeth and spines of struggling fish. They are also used for thermal protection in colder water. ; Fish stringer: Used to store speared fish while diving. Usually a length of cable, cord, string or monofilament terminated by a loop (and sometimes a swivel) at one end and a large stainless steel pin/spike at the other. The pin is typically 15‚Äì30 cm long, 4-8mm diameter, with a sharp point at one end, and with the cable threaded through a hole, usually in the middle, so the spike functions as a toggle once threaded. The pin can optionally be used as an iki jime spike, to dispatch speared fish. It can alternatively be a large, shaped loop of stainless steel. The stringer may be attached to the dive float, especially in areas of high shark activity, although some divers will use a clip to attach their stringer to their weight belt, or the base of their speargun. ; Snorkel and diving mask: Spearfishing snorkels and diving masks are similar to those used for scuba diving, although the masks usually have two lenses and a lower internal volume. ;Diver down flag: The \\"diver down\\" flag (also called a \\"dive flag\\") is a safety flag used on the water to indicate to other boats that there is a diver below. When in use, it signals to other vessels to keep clear, watch for divers in the water, and operate at a slow speed. ==Management== Spearfishing is intensively managed throughout the world. Australia allows only recreational spearfishing and generally only breath-hold free diving. State & territory governments impose numerous restrictions, demarcating Marine Protected Areas, Closed Areas, Protected Species, size/bag limits and equipment. The body principally concerned with spearfishing is the Australian Underwater Federation, Australia's peak recreational diving body. The AUF's vision for spearfishing is \\"Safe, Sustainable, Selective, Spearfishing\\". The AUF provides membership, advocacy and organises competitions. Norway has a relatively large ratio of coastline to population, and has one of the most liberal spearfishing rules in the northern hemisphere. Spearfishing with scuba gear is widespread among recreational divers. Restrictions in Norway are limited to anadrome species, like Atlantic salmon, sea trout, and lobster.Spearfishing in Norway In Mexico a regular fishing permit allows spearfishing, but not electro-mechanical spearguns. Spearfishing with scuba gear is illegal and the use of power heads as well. Penalties are severe and include fines, confiscation of gear and even imprisonment. United States has different spearfishing regulations for each state. In Florida spearfishing is restricted to several hundred yards offshore in many areas and the usage of a powerhead is prohibited within state waters. Many types of fish are currently under heavy bag restrictions. In California only recreational spearfishing is allowed. California also imposes numerous restrictions, demarcating Marine protected areas, closed areas, protected species, size/bag limits and equipment. Spearfishing in Puerto Rico has its own set of rules. In the UK, while spearfishing is not explicitly regulated, it is instead subject to both local (typically local bye-laws) and national- level legislation relating to permitted fish species and minimum size limits. For example, it is not permitted to spearfish in freshwater and the non-tidal reaches of rivers. Under recent EU guidelines, recreational spearfishing is now explicitly permitted in the EU's Atlantic waters. == Notable spearfishers == This is an alphabetic list of spearfishers who are confirmed by a reliable source or an existing Wikipedia article. * Rob Allen - South Africa * Tommy Botha - South Africa * Peter Crawford - England, 13 times UK champion * * - England; author of the James Bond books and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang * Wally Gibbons * * James Grant - New Zealandhttps://www.smh.com.au/world/man-fights- off-shark-then-stitches-himself-up-20140127-hva2g.html * David J.

While initially formed as a confederation to act politically to negotiate issues vis-√†-vis the Protestant Union (formed 1608), modelled on the more intransigent ultra-Catholic French Catholic League (1576), it was subsequently concluded as a military alliance \\"for the defence of the Catholic religion and peace within the Empire\\". Notwithstanding the league's founding, as had the founding of the Protestant Union, it further exacerbated long standing tensions between the Protestant reformers and the adherents of the Catholic Church which thereafter began to get worse with ever more frequent episodes of civil disobedience, repression, and retaliation that would eventually ignite into the first phase of the Thirty Years' War roughly a decade later with the act of rebellion and calculated insult known as the Second Defenestration of Prague on 23 May 1618. == Background == === Peace of Augsburg === In 1555, the Peace of Augsburg was signed, which confirmed the result of the Diet of Speyer (1526) and ended the violence between the Catholics and the Lutherans in the Holy Roman Empire. It stated that: * Princes of the Holy Roman Empire (numbering 225) could choose the religion (Catholicism or Lutheranism) for their realms according to their conscience (the principle of cuius regio, eius religio). * Lutherans living in an ecclesiastical state (under the control of a Catholic prince-bishop) could remain Lutherans. * Lutherans could keep the territory that they had captured from the Catholic Church since the Peace of Passau (1552). * The ecclesiastical leaders of the Catholic Church (bishops) that converted to Lutheranism had to give up their territory (the principle called reservatum ecclesiasticum). Those occupying a state that had officially chosen either Catholicism or Lutheranism could not practice the religion differing to that of the state. Although the Peace created a temporary end to hostilities, the underlying bases of the religious conflict remained unsolved. Both parties interpreted it at their convenience, the Lutherans in particular considering it only a momentary agreement. Further, Calvinism spread quickly throughout the Holy Roman Empire, adding a third major Christian worldview to the region, but its position was not supported in any way by the Augsburg terms, since Catholicism and Lutheranism were the only permitted creeds. === Motivations for a Catholic alliance ===  Donauw√∂rth processions  Mural in Donauw√∂rth in memory of the Kreuz- und Fahnengefecht The best documented reason of the foundation of the Catholic League was an incident called the ' in a Free Imperial City within the territory of Bavaria named Donauw√∂rth. On 25 April 1606, the Lutheran majority of the town barred the Catholic residents of the town from holding an annual Markus procession, to show the rule of their confession over the town. The Catholics, led by five monks, wanted to pass through the town and on to the nearby village of Ausesheim, showing their flags and singing hymns. They were permitted to do so by the terms of the Peace of Augsburg. The city council would only allow them to re-enter town without flags and singing. The conflict ended in a brawl. On protest of the bishop of Augsburg, Catholic Emperor Rudolf II of Habsburg threatened an Imperial ban in case of further violation of the rights of the Catholic citizens. Nevertheless, next year similar anti-Catholic incidents of civil disobedience took place, and the participants of the Markus procession were thrown out of town. Emperor Rudolf then declared an Imperial ban on the town and ordered Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria to execute the ban. Facing his army, the town surrendered. According to Imperial law, the disciplinary measures should not have been executed by the Catholic duke of Bavaria, but by the Protestant duke of W√ºrttemberg, who, like Donauw√∂rth, was a member of the Swabian Imperial Circle. Maximilian de facto absorbed the former Free Imperial City, which was a violation of Imperial law as well.  Protestant Union formed  In the same year, 1607, the Catholic majority of the Reichstag meeting in the Diet of Augsburg resolved that the renewal of the Peace of Augsburg of 1555 should be conditional on the restoration of all church land appropriated since 1552. Acting on these events, the Protestant princes formed a military alliance on 14 May 1608, the Protestant Union, whose leader was Frederick IV of Wittelsbach, the Elector Palatine. == The foundation of the Catholic League == To create a union of Catholic states as a counterpart to this Protestant Union, early in 1608 Maximilian started negotiations with other Catholic princes. On 5 July 1608, the spiritual electors manifested a tendency in favour of the confederacy suggested by Maximilian. Opinions were even expressed as to the size of the confederate military forces to be raised. === Munich Diet === Foundation of the Catholic League, 1870 painting by Karl von Piloty In July 1609, the representatives of the Prince-Bishops of Augsburg, Constance, Passau, Regensburg, and W√ºrzburg assembled at Munich. The Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, having shown disapproval, was not invited, and the Prince-Bishop of Eichst√§dt hesitated. On 10 July 1609, the participating states concluded an alliance \\"for the defence of the Catholic religion and peace within the Empire.\\" The most important regulation of the League was the prohibition of attacks on one another. Instead of fighting, conflicts had to be decided by the laws of the Empire or, if these failed to solve the conflict, by arbitration within the League. Should one member be attacked, it had to be helped with military or alternatively legal support. Duke Maximilian was to be the president, and the Prince-Bishops of Augsburg, Passau, and W√ºrzburg his councillors. The League was to continue for nine years. The Munich Diet failed to erect a substantial structure for the newly formed League. On 18 June 1609, the Electors of Mainz, Cologne, and Trier had proposed an army of 20,000 men. They had also considered making Maximilian president of the alliance, and on August 30 they announced their adhesion to the Munich agreement, provided that Maximilian accepted the Elector of Mainz, arch-chancellor of the Empire, as co-president. === Meeting at W√ºrzburg === To create a structure, several general meetings of the members were arranged. On 10 February 1610, the representatives of all the important Catholic states, except for Austria and Salzburg ‚Äî and a great number of the smaller ones ‚Äî met at W√ºrzburg to decide the organization, funding and arming of the League. This was the real beginning of the Catholic League. The Pope, the Emperor and the King of Spain, who had been informed by Maximilian, were all favorably disposed towards the undertaking. The main problem of the League was the unreadiness of its members. In April 1610, the contributions of all its members were not yet paid; Maximilian threatened to resign. To prevent him from doing so, Spain, which had made the giving of a subsidy dependent on Austria's enrollment in the League, waived this condition, and the pope promised a further contribution. == Pre-war years == === War of the J√ºlich Succession === The conduct of the Union in the J√ºlich dispute and the warlike operations of the Union army in Alsace seemed to make a battle between League and Union inevitable. === House Habsburg joins === Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria In the year 1613 at Regensburg (Ratisbon), the Austrian Habsburgs joined the League. The assembly now appointed no less than three war- directors: Duke Maximilian, and Archdukes Albert and Maximilian of Austria. The object of the League was now declared \\"a Christian legal defense\\". The membership of the Habsburg monarchy made the League part of the struggles between the emperor and his Protestant vassals in Bohemia and Lower Austria, that would lead to the beginning of the Thirty Years' War. The first half of the war would see the emperor using the Catholic League forces as the most important part of his Imperial army. === Bavaria leaves in protest === Duke Maximilian refused to accept the resolutions of Ratisbon and even resigned the post as president, when Archduke Maximilian III of Austria, the Prince Elector of Mainz and the Prince Elector of Trier, protested the inclusion of the Bishop of Augsburg, and the Provost of Ellwangen in the Bavarian Directory. On 27 May 1617, with the Prince-Bishops of Bamberg, Eichst√§dt, W√ºrzburg, and the Prince-Provost of Ellwangen, Bavaria formed a separate league for nine years. === Bohemian revolt === Frederick V of the Palatinate as King of Bohemia Already having been crowned King of Bohemia in 1617, Ferdinand II and his Catholic governors were deposed by rebelling Protestant Czech nobles in the second defenestration of Prague in 1618. The Bohemian estates went on to elect Frederick V, Elector Palatine as their king, on August 26 and 27, 1619. After his election as German Emperor on August 28, Ferdinand conferred with the spiritual electors at Frankfurt, asking for the support of the League. === Catholic League reestablished === At the end of 1618, the position of the Emperor in Bohemia as in Lower and Upper Austria gradually became critical. Searching for help, the Emperor tried to restore the League. A meeting of several of the ecclesiastical Princes decided to reconstruct the League on its original basis. It would consist of two groups: the Rhenish district under the presidency of Mainz, and the Oberland district, presided by Bavaria; the treasury and the military command were to be considered separate. Maximilian could only lead the whole of the troops when he had to appear in the Rhenish district. On 31 May, the Oberland both groups were established and bound themselves to render mutual help for six years. Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor in armor  Treaty of Munich  The Treaty of Munich was signed on October 8, 1619 between Emperor Ferdinand II and Duke Maximilian of Bavaria. Spanish ambassador O√±ate persuaded Ferdinand to grant Maximilian any part of the Electoral Palatinate to occupy, as well as the electoral seat of Frederick V. Moreover, O√±ate exceeded his duties by guaranteeing Ferdinand Spanish support in dealing with the Bohemian rebels. Based on the terms of the treaty, Maximilian, leader of the Catholic League, made his Bavarian forces available to Emperor Ferdinand. Now the formation of a confederate army began. With 7,000 men, Bavaria supplied the largest contribution to the army, whose strength was fixed at W√ºrzburg in December 1619, as 21,000 infantry and 4000 cavalry. Commander in chief was Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly, a descendant of a Catholic Brabantine family. === Decline and end of the Protestant Union === Facing the superiority of the League army of 30,000 men confronting the Protestant Union's army of 10,000, on 3 July 1620, the Union agreed to cease all hostilities between both parties during the war in Austria and Bohemia in the Treaty of Ulm and dissolved the following year. == The League in War == === Bohemian campaign === Battle of White Mountain, painting by P. Snayers Without the risk of an attack the League could use all its military forces to support the emperor. The same month, the army was relocated to Upper Austria. Tilly won the Battle of White Mountain north of Prague on 8 November 1620, in which half of the enemy forces were killed or captured, losing only 700 men. The Emperor regained control over Bohemia and the first stage of the League's activity during the Thirty Years' War ended. === Palatinate campaigns === Count Tilly, commander in chief of the army of the Catholic League  1622 campaign  In the spring of 1622 General Tilly moved the League's army to invade the Electoral Palatinate. They were defeated by General Mansfeld's troops at the Battle of Mingolsheim on 27 April 1622. Retreating eastwards they were joined by a Spanish army under General C√≥rdoba. When another Protestant army under Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Baden attacked on May 6, Tilly's League force convincingly won the Battle of Wimpfen, scattering the enemy. The Battle of H√∂chst on June 20 proved to be the decisive victory for 1622. After that battle the Protestant forces still fighting for Frederick V of the Palatinate withdrew over the Rhine and allowed the Catholic League army freedom of action. Consequently, Tilly captured the city of Heidelberg, Frederick's main city, following an eleven-week siege on September 19. Mannheim followed on November 2, after a ten day siege. This could have meant the end of the war. With the exception of the still besieged fortress of Frankenthal, the Electoral Palatinate was occupied by League forces while Count Frederick was in Dutch exile.  Stadtlohn campaign  Alas, in 1623, Frederick had Christian of Brunswick, raise another army to continue the fight. However, Christian found little success and no allies on his short campaign. When Tilly approached with the League army, the Protestants made for the Dutch border. Tilly cut them off five miles short of it in the Battle of Stadtlohn on August 6, destroying another Protestant army. This victory marks the end of the Bohemian-Palatinate phase of the war. Armed opposition against the Emperor and his anti-Protestant policies had ceased. === Danish War === This caused Denmark's king Christian IV to enter the Thirty Years' War in 1625 to protect Protestantism and also in a bid to make himself the primary leader of Northern Europe. The league's army fought and defeated the Danish on 26‚Äì27 August 1626 at the Battle of Lutter, destroying more than half the fleeing Danish army. Because this and other victories by Wallenstein, Denmark was forced to sue for peace at the Treaty of L√ºbeck. === Edict of Restitution === Supported by the Catholic princes and their victorious League army, the emperor now moved to denounce Protestantism as illegal in many territories of Northern Germany. In March 1629, emperor Ferdinand II passed the Edict of Restitution. It was specifically aimed at restoring the situation of the 1555 Peace of Augsburg in ecclesiastical territories that had strayed from \\"legal\\" Catholic faith and rule, in the decades since then. Bremen and Magdeburg were the biggest examples of territories to be restituted. Afraid that the Catholic League's army would be sent to enforce this new law, if challenged, their protestant authorities again looked abroad for allies to protect them. === Swedish War === Sack of Magdeburg, 1632 engraving by  Sack of Magdeburg  While the Swedish King Gustavus Adolphus landed his army in Pomerania and tried to make alliances with the leaders of Northern Germany, the League's army laid siege to the city of Magdeburg for two months from 20 March 1631, as the city had promised to support Sweden. On May 20, 40,000 successfully attacked Magdeburg. A massacre of the populace ensued in which 25,000 of the 30,000 inhabitants of the city perished while fires destroyed much of the city.  The Catholic League in defeat  In 1630, Ferdinand II dismissed his Generalissimus Wallenstein. Now, the Catholic League was in control of all the Catholic armed forces. At the First Battle of Breitenfeld, the Catholic League led by General Tilly was defeated by the Swedish forces. A year later (1632), they met again in the Battle of Rain, and this time General Tilly was killed. The upper hand had now switched from the league to Sweden and her allies, who were able to attack and capture or destroy the territories of the Catholic League. Even Munich, the capital of the most powerful member state, Electoral Bavaria, was conquered. == Decline of importance and dissolution == Thereafter, the German Catholic League did not play a major role in later events. The Peace of Prague of 30 May 1635, was a treaty between the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II, and most of the Protestant states of the Empire. It effectively ended the civil war aspect of the Thirty Years' War. The Edict of Restitution of 1629, was effectively revoked, with the terms of the Peace of Augsburg of 1555 being reestablished. One of the most important regulations was that formal alliances between states of the Empire were prohibited. The armies of the various states were to be unified with those of the Emperor as an army for the Empire as a whole. The result of this clause was the end of the Catholic League, a now prohibited alliance between states of the Empire. As well as ending the fighting between the various states, the treaty also ended religion as a source of national conflict; the principle of cuius regio, eius religio was established for good within the Empire. ==References== Category:1609 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:1635 disestablishments Category:1630s disestablishments in Europe Category:Catholic organizations established in the 17th century ","title":"Catholic League (German)"},{"id":"306279","text":"Holy League may refer to: * Holy League (1495), or \\"League of Venice\\", alliance of several opponents of French hegemony in Italy, arranged by Pope Alexander VI * Holy League (1535), a short-lived alliance of Christian states arranged by Pope Paul III at the urging of the Hapsburg Emperor Charles V; defeated Hayreddin Barbarossa and conquered Tunis, capturing a large part of the city's fleet and releasing thousands of Christian slaves * Holy League (1538), a short-lived alliance of Christian states arranged by Pope Paul III at the urging of the Republic of Venice; defeated by Hayreddin Barbarossa in Battle of Preveza * Holy League (1571), included almost all the major Catholic maritime states in the Mediterranean; defeated Ottomans in Battle of Lepanto * Holy League (1594), established in 1594 by Pope Clement VIII was a military alliance of predominantly Christian European countries (Holy League) aimed against the Ottoman Empire during the Long War (1591‚Äì1606). * Holy League (1684), composed of the Holy Roman Empire, Poland-Lithuania and the Venetian Republic; fought Ottomans in the Great Turkish War * Holy League (1717), allying the Papal States to Portugal, Venice and Malta against the Ottoman Empire and which resulted in the Battle of Matapan ==See also== * Catholic League (disambiguation) * War of the Holy League (disambiguation) ","title":"Holy League"},{"id":"306280","text":"Archibald Yell (August 9, 1797 ‚Äì February 23, 1847) was an American politician who served as the U.S. Representative from Arkansas from 1836 to 1839, and 1845 to 1846. He was the second Governor of Arkansas, serving from 1840 to 1844. Yell was killed in action at the Battle of Buena Vista on February 23, 1847. ==Early life== Yell was likely born in Kentucky or Tennessee, although his headstone lists North Carolina as his birthplace. His family first settled in Jefferson County in the eastern part of the state, then moved to Rutherford in Middle Tennessee, and finally settled in Bedford County to the south. As a youth, Yell participated in the Creek War, serving in 1813 and early 1814 under General Andrew Jackson. In 1814 and 1815, during the War of 1812, he served with Jackson in Louisiana, including in the Battle of New Orleans. He returned to Tennessee, and read law as a legal apprentice. He was admitted to the bar in Fayetteville, Tennessee. In 1818, he joined Jackson's army during the First Seminole War in Florida. He was active in freemasonry, and was the Grand Master of the Tennessee in 1830. ==Political career== Archibald Yell as Grand Master of Tennessee, 1831 Active in the Democratic Party, Yell moved to the Arkansas Territory in 1831 to head the federal land office in Little Rock. The federal government offered him the governorship of the Florida Territory the following year, but he declined. On March 21, 1832, Yell was appointed adjutant general of Arkansas Territorial Militia with the rank of Colonel in place of Colonel Whorton Rector who had resigned.Arkansas Times and Advocate (Little Rock, Arkansas) ¬∑ 21 Mar 1832, Wed ¬∑ Page 3 His time as Adjutant general was apparently cut short by malaria.\\"Michael B.

Polk. Just prior to taking office in 1845, Polk sent Yell to Texas to advocate for its annexation to the union. He is reported to have single- handedly retrieved a criminal from a local saloon and physically brought him to his court. Yell was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1836, after Arkansas was admitted to the Union. He served one term, from December 5, 1836, to March 3, 1839. While in Washington, he was a strong supporter of Texan statehood and favored a stronger military. Around this time that he formed the first Masonic lodge in Arkansas at Fayetteville. In 1840, Yell was elected Governor of Arkansas. He focused on internal improvements, as infrastructure was needed to benefit planters and farmers. He also worked to better control banks and supported public education. Yell resigned his post as governor to run again for Congress in 1844 at age 47, and won the seat. He is reported to have been the consummate campaigner. At one stop during the campaign, he is said to have won a shooting match, donated meat to the poor, and bought a jug of whiskey for the crowd. ==Mexican War== Soon after he took his seat in Congress, the Mexican War began. Yell returned to Arkansas and formed the Mounted Regiment of Arkansas Infantry. Several of his men later achieved notability in Arkansas, including the future governor John Selden Roane, and future Confederate generals Albert Pike, Solon Borland, and James Fleming Fagan. His cavalry compiled a record of insubordination. General John E. Wool, commander of the Arkansas mounted volunteers, said they were, \\"wholly without instruction, and Colonel Yell is determined to leave (them) in that condition.\\" Yell, he continued had a \\"total ignorance of his duties as Colonel.\\" During the Mexican War, he was brevetted a Brigadier General of United States Volunteers. ==Death== On February 23, 1847, Yell was killed in action at the Battle of Buena Vista at age 49. He was originally buried on the battlefield in Mexico. His body was removed and returned to Arkansas for burial at Waxhaws Cemetery in Fayetteville. When Evergreen Cemetery was established in the city, the Freemasons arranged for his body to be relocated and reinterred in the Masonic section of that cemetery. ==Personal life== Yell met Mary Scott in Bedford County, Tennessee, where they were neighbors. They married in 1821 after he had started to establish his law practice. She had one daughter, Mary, who was born January 5, 1823. Mary Scott Yell died from complications following their daughter's birth. A few years later in 1828, he married Nancy Moore of Danville, Kentucky. They had four children before her death.

Murrell from life exists of him in his later years. From an artist's interpretation of his older physical appearance found in historical records. Murell grave at Smyrna, Tennessee gamblers in Vicksburg, Mississippi in 1835 was in response to the rising regulator activity against criminals in the region following the arrest of Murrell known as the \\"Murrell Excitement\\" John Andrews Murrell (1806 ‚Äì November 21, 1844), the \\"Great Western Land Pirate\\" also known as John A. Murrell and commonly spelled as Murel and Murrel, was a bandit and criminal operating in the United States, along the Mississippi River, in the 19th century. Murrell had his first criminal conviction, for horse theft, as a teenager and was branded with an \\"HT\\", flogged, and sentenced to six years in prison. He was released in 1829. Murrell was convicted a second and final time, for the crime of slave stealing, in the Circuit Court of Madison County, Tennessee, and incarcerated in the Tennessee State Penitentiary in Nashville from 1834 to 1844. ==Early life== According to Tennessee prison records, John Andrews Murrell was born in Lunenburg County, Virginia, and raised in Williamson County, Tennessee. Murrell was the son of Jeffrey Murrell and Zilpha Andrews and was the third born of eight children. While incarcerated, his mother, wife, and two children lived in the vicinity of Denmark, Tennessee. ==Punishment and imprisonment== John A. Murrell had his first criminal conviction, for horse theft, as a teenager and was branded on the base of his thumb with an \\"HT\\" for horse thief, flogged, and sentenced to six years in prison. He was released in 1829. Murrell was convicted a second and final time, for the crime of slave stealing, in the Circuit Court of Madison County, Tennessee, and incarcerated in the Tennessee State Penitentiary in Nashville from 1834 to 1844. While in the Tennessee State Penitentiary, Murrell, as part of his reform, was required to work as a blacksmith. A decade in prison under the Auburn penitentiary system, of mandatory convict regimentation, through prison uniforms, lockstep, silence, and occasional solitary confinement, broke Murrell mentally and supposedly left him an imbecile. He spent the last months of his life as a blacksmith in Pikeville, Tennessee. The Nashville Daily American newspaper mentioned a different account of his last year of life, that, upon his release from prison, at 38 years old, he became a reformed man, a Methodist in good standing, was a carpenter by trade, and lived at a boarding house in Pikeville\\"Interesting Facts about John A. Murrell\\", Nashville Daily American Newspaper, January 1, 1876. ==Death== In a deathbed confession, Murrell admitted to being guilty of most of the crimes charged against him except murder, to which he claimed to be \\"guiltless\\".Kirk, Lowell. John A. Murrell: An Early Tennessee \\"Terrorist‚Äù. The Tellico Times. John A. Murrell died on November 21, 1844, just nine months after leaving prison, having contracted \\"pulmonary consumption\\", now known as tuberculosis. Murrell was interred at Smyrna First United Methodist Church Cemetery, in Smyrna, Tennessee. After Murrell died, parts of him were dug up and stolen by grave robbers. Although the corpse had been half-eaten by scavenging hogs, the head was separated from the torso, pickled, and displayed at county fairs.Wyatt-Brown,Southern Honor, p.45 His skull is missing, but one of his thumbs is in the possession of the Tennessee State Museum.. == Accepted claims == Accepted facts about his life include stealing horses, for which he was branded. He was also caught with a freed slave living on his property. Murrell was known to kidnap slaves and sell them to other slave owners. He received his 10-year prison sentence for slave-stealing.The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture: John Andrews Murrell 1806-1844 Murrell would be considered a conductor on the Reverse Underground Railroad. ===\\"The Murrell Excitement\\"=== In 1835, Virgil Stewart wrote an account of a slave rebellion plot sponsored by highwaymen and Northern Abolitionists. On Christmas Day, 1835, Murrell and his \\"Mystic Clan\\" planned to incite an uprising in every slaveholding state by invoking the image of the Haitian Revolution, the most successful slave rebellion in history. In rising up against Southern whites, the slaves involved in Murrell's conspiracy would cause enough chaos to allow Murrell to take over the South, with New Orleans as the center of operations of his criminal empire. Stewart's account of his interactions with Murrell was published as a pamphlet,\\"A History of the Detection, Conviction, Life And Designs of John A. Murel, The Great Western Land Pirate; Together With his System of Villany and Plan of Exciting a Negro Rebellion, and a Catalogue of the Names of Four Hundred and Forty Five of His Mystic Clan Fellows and Followers and Their Efforts for the Destruction of Mr. Virgil A. Stewart, The Young Man Who Detected Him, To Which is Added Biographical Sketch of Mr. Virgil A. Stewart.\\" and Stewart wrote the pamphlet under the pseudonym of \\"Augustus Q. Walton, Esq.,\\" for whom he invented a fictitious background and profession. The validity of the pamphlet has been debated since its publication. Some historians assert that Stewart's pamphlet was largely fictional and that Murrell (and his brothers) were at best inept thieves, having bankrupted their father over the years for bail money. However, many of the claims made in the pamphlet were believed at the time in some parts of the South, and led to the \\"Murrell Excitement\\". During this time, there was increased tension between the races and between locals and outsiders. On July 4, 1835, there were disturbances in the red-light districts of Nashville, Memphis, and Natchez, and twenty slaves and ten white men were hanged after confessing to complicity in Murrell's plot. On July 6 in Vicksburg, Mississippi, an angry mob decided to expel all professional gamblers from the town, based on a rumor that the gamblers were part of the plot. The gamblers resisted, and as a result, five gamblers were hanged by the mob. Similar panic surrounding Murrell and his conspiracy spread throughout the South long after his death, with cities from Huntsville, Alabama to New Orleans, Louisiana creating committees dedicated to identifying Murrell's conspirators and potential signs of slave rebellion. == Disputed claims == Murrell was known as a \\"land-pirate\\", using the Mississippi River as a base for his operations. He used a network of anywhere from 300Stewart estimate to 1,000,as quoted in Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi and even as much as 2,500 (as some newspaper reports claimed) fellow bandits collectively known as the Mystic Clan to pull off his escapades. Many of these were members of cultural/ethnic groups such as the Melungeons and the Redbones. He was also known as a bushwhacker along the Natchez Trace. To cover up his deeds, he played the persona of a traveling preacher. Twain's work and others say he would preach to a congregation while his gang stole the horses outside. However, the accounts are unanimous that Murrell's horse was always left behind. The location of his hideout and operations base has been in question. Possibilities are Jackson County, Tennessee; Natchez, Mississippi, at Devil's Punch Bowl; Tunica County, Mississippi; the Neutral Ground in Louisiana; and even the tiny Island 37 on the Mississippi River. One record, a genealogical note, even places him as far east as Georgia; in fact Atlanta historian Franklin Garrett makes it clear there was a lawless district in that town named for him, \\"Murrell's Row,\\" in the 1840s. Because Murrell has come to symbolize Natchez Trace lawlessness in the antebellum era, it is understandable that his \\"hideouts\\" (whether there were any hideouts or not) have been said to have been located at most of the well-known areas of particular lawlessness along the Natchez Trace. Just before he was apprehended, he was about to spearhead a slave revolt in New Orleans in an attempt to take over the city and install himself as a sort of potentate of Louisiana. Some say he began to plot his takeover of New Orleans in 1841, although he was in the sixth year of a ten-year sentence in the prison at Nashville at the time, and Stewart had already published his account of Murrell's plot in 1835. Others say he was in operation from 1835 to 1857; he was in prison for ten of those years and died of tuberculosis in 1844 shortly thereafter. A stream in Chicot County, Arkansas, called Whiskey Chute is named for his raid on a whiskey-carrying steamboat that was sunk after it was pillaged. It was named such in 1855. We know from Record Group 25, \\"Prison Records for the Main Prison at Nashville, Tennessee, 1831-1922,\\" that Murrell was born in 1806, most likely in Williamson County, Tennessee. ==In popular culture== *In The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Injun Joe finds Murel's treasure, which Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn claim in the end. *He was fictionalized by Jorge Luis Borges in The Cruel Redeemer Lazarus Morell, written between 1933 and 1934 and published in A Universal History of Iniquity in 1935. *He was fictionalized in the movie Virginia City (1940), being played by Humphrey Bogart as the leader of a gang of \\"banditos\\" during the American Civil War of the early 1860s. *The Eudora Welty short story \\"A Still Moment,\\" collected in The Wide Net and Other Stories (1943), features a renowned highwayman named James Murrell encountered along the Natchez Trace. *He was fictionalized as a featured character both in Robert Lewis Taylor's The Travels of Jamie McPheeters and on the 1963 television showed based on it, where he was portrayed by James Westerfield. *He was fictionalized in Gary Jennings' 1976 novel Sow the Seeds of Hemp. *Murrell's treasure forms the central motive in the 2015 Aaron and Adam Nee film Band of Robbers, loosely based on Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. ==See also== *John Crenshaw *James Ford (pirate) ==Notes== ==References== *Block, Lawrence.

He spent his 18-year baseball career primarily with the Boston Red Sox, but he also played for the New York Yankees, with whom he won the 1996 World Series over the Atlanta Braves, and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, with whom he reached 3,000 hits. His hitting in the 1980s and 1990s made him a perennial contender for American League batting titles. He is 33rd on the list of career leaders for batting average among Major League Baseball players with a minimum of 1,000 plate appearances, and has the highest ranking of those still alive. Boggs was elected to the Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2005. With 12 straight All-Star appearances, Boggs is third only to Brooks Robinson and George Brett in number of consecutive appearances as a third baseman. In 1997, he ranked number 95 on the Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. Boggs, a 1976 graduate of Plant High School in Tampa, Florida, currently resides in the Tampa Palms neighborhood of Tampa. ==Early life== Born in Omaha, Nebraska, the youngest of three sons of Winfield Kennedy Boggs Jr. and Sue Nell Graham, Wade had a regimented military upbringing. Winfield and Sue met in 1946 at a military base in Georgia. Winfield served with the Marines in World War II and flew for the Air Force in the Korean War, while Sue piloted mail planes in World War II. The Boggs family lived in several different places (including Puerto Rico and Savannah, Georgia) before settling in Tampa, Florida when Wade was 11 years old. He attended Plant High School in Tampa, where he played baseball and was an All-State football player as a senior. Boggs played quarterback until his senior year when he switched positions to avoid injury and thereby protect his baseball career. His success as a left-footed placekicker and punter earned him a scholarship offer from the University of South Carolina. He graduated from Plant High School in 1976 and was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the seventh round of the 1976 MLB draft on the advice of veteran scout George Digby. He signed with the club for $7,500. ==Minor league career== Boggs played in the longest game in professional baseball history as a member of the Pawtucket Red Sox in 1981 against Cal Ripken, Jr. and the Rochester Red Wings. It lasted for 33 innings over eight hours and 25 minutes. The game took place from April 18‚Äì19, 1981, at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.\\" During his last year in the minor leagues with Pawtucket, he led the league with a .335 batting-average, 167 hits, and 41 doubles. ==Major league career== ===Boston Red Sox=== A left-handed hitter, Boggs won five batting titles starting in 1983. He also batted .349 in his rookie year, which would have won the batting title, but he was 121 plate appearances short of the required minimum of 502. From 1982 to 1988, Boggs hit below .349 only once, hitting .325 in 1984. From 1983 to 1989, Boggs rattled off seven consecutive seasons in which he collected 200 or more hits, an American League record for consecutive 200-hit seasons that was later matched and surpassed by Seattle's Ichiro Suzuki. Boggs also had six seasons with 200 or more hits, 100+ runs, and 40+ doubles. Although he would not win another batting title after 1988 (his batting title that year broke Bill Madlock's Major League record of four by a third baseman), he regularly appeared among the league leaders in hitting. Boggs with the Red Sox in 1988 In 1985, Boggs had 72 multi-hit games, a club record. In 1986, Boggs made it to the World Series with the Red Sox, but they lost to the New York Mets in seven games. He holds the record for batting average at Fenway Park, at .369. Boggs had a power surge in 1987, setting career-highs with 24 home runs, 89 RBIs, and a .588 slugging percentage. He never hit half as many home runs in any other season. ===New York Yankees=== In 1992, Boggs slumped to .259‚Äîone of only three times in his career that he failed to reach .300‚Äîand at the end of the season, he left the Red Sox, with whom he had spent his entire career to that point. He was heavily pursued by two teams: the Los Angeles Dodgers and the arch-rival of the Red Sox, the New York Yankees. He chose the Yankees when they added the third year to the contract that the Dodgers would not offer. Boggs went on to be awarded three straight All-Star appearances, had four straight .300-plus seasons, and even collected two Gold Glove Awards for his defense. In 1996, Boggs helped the Yankees win their first World Series title in 18 years, which became his only world title. In the series' fourth game, which saw the Yankees rally from six runs down to win, Boggs was called on to pinch hit in the tenth inning and using the batting eye he was known for throughout his career, he coaxed a bases-loaded walk out of Steve Avery, which gave the Yankees the lead in a game they went on to win 8‚Äì6.http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Wade_Boggs_1958 After the Yankees won the series in game 6, Boggs memorably celebrated by jumping on the back of an NYPD horse, touring the field with his index finger in the air, despite his self-professed fear of horses. ===Tampa Bay Devil Rays=== Boggs signed with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for the final two seasons of his career. He hit the first home run in Devil Rays history in the 6th inning of the inaugural game on March 31, 1998. On August 7, 1999, he collected his 3,000th hit with a home run. Despite his reputation for lacking home-run power, he is one of only three players whose 3,000th hit was a home run; he was the first to make such a hit a home run. followed by Derek Jeter on July 9, 2011, and Alex Rodriguez on June 19, 2015. Boggs retired in 1999 after sustaining a knee injury, leaving with a career batting average of .328 and 3,010 hits. His last game was on August 27, 1999; he went 0-for-3 with a walk against the Cleveland Indians.Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Cleveland Indians Box Score, August 27, 1999  Baseball-Reference.com Two yellow seats among the rest of the Tropicana's blue seats mark where both historic balls landed in right field, each with a small metal plate noting it as the area that the ball landed. Due to the fact that he signed with the 1st year expansion team Devil Rays so late in his career, he is the oldest former Devil Ray in team history. (This only includes the time where they were called the Devil Rays) He was also the 1st Tampa Bay area native to play for the team. ==Baseball legacy== Boggs' career paralleled that of Tony Gwynn, who also debuted (in the National League) in 1982. Boggs and Gwynn were the premier contact hitters of their era. They both won multiple batting titles‚ÄîBoggs, five and Gwynn, eight‚Äîand each won four straight batting titles to join Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, and Rod Carew as the only players to do so. Gwynn and Boggs each hit over .350 in four straight seasons, the only players to do so since 1931. They joined Lou Brock and Rod Carew as the only players whose careers ended after World War II who finished with 3,000 hits and fewer than 160 home runs. Boggs recorded 2.1 innings of pitching at the Major League level. His main pitch was a knuckleball, which he used 16 times (along with one fastball) in one shutout inning for the Yankees against the Anaheim Angels in a 1997 game. Boggs recorded a strike-out pitching during that game.NYY@ANA: Boggs throws scoreless inning in debut - YouTube Boggs also pitched 1.1 innings for Tampa Bay against the Orioles in a 1999 game, allowing one run. On December 21, 2015, the Red Sox announced that they would retire Boggs' number (26). The ceremony was held on May 26, 2016. Boggs occasionally appears in the Yankees' annual Old-Timers' Day, a celebration of past Yankees in which the players play a multi-inning game of baseball at Yankee Stadium. His own style included mental preparedness techniques, which consisted in visualizing four at-bats each evening before a game and imagining himself successfully getting four hits. As of June 8, 1986‚Äîover the course of the previous 162 games (equivalent to a full season, though across two seasons)‚ÄîBoggs was hitting .400, with 254 hits in 635 at-bats.Boston Globe, June 9, 1986. p. 37. In his 18-year major league career, Boggs recorded three five-hit games and 59 four-hit games. On June 29, 1987, he had a career-high seven RBI against the Orioles in a 14‚Äì3 victory at Fenway. The Tampa Bay Devil Rays retired his #12 on April 7, 2000. It is the only number to have been issued only once by the Rays. The Boston Red Sox inducted Boggs into the team's Hall of Fame in 2004 and his number 26 was retired during a pre-game ceremony on May 26, 2016. Boggs was known for his superstitions. He ate chicken before every game (Jim Rice once called Boggs \\"chicken man\\"), woke up at the same time every day, and ran sprints at 7:17 pm. His route to and from his position in the field beat a path to the home dugout. He drew the Hebrew word \\"Chai\\" (meaning \\"life\\") in the batter's box before each at-bat, though he is not Jewish.The Rundown. NPR. August 6, 2005 He asked Fenway Park public address announcer Sherm Feller not to say his uniform number when he introduced him because Boggs once broke out of a slump on a day when Feller forgot to announce his number. Baseball-Reference.com ranks Boggs's mustache as the third-best in baseball history. ==Life outside baseball== ===The Margo Adams affair and palimony lawsuit=== Boggs autographing the book Yankee Stadium at a book signing on September 23, 2008.Yankee Stadium (2009) C&G; Partners, New York Boggs garnered non- baseball-related media attention in 1989 for his four-year extramarital affair with Margo Adams, a California mortgage broker. After Boggs ended the relationship in 1988, Adams filed a $12 million lawsuit for emotional distress and breach of oral contract. She argued that Boggs had verbally agreed to compensate her for lost income and services performed while accompanying Boggs on road trips. Boggs' reputation was further sullied when Adams agreed to an interview with Penthouse magazine in which she discussed intimate details of her time with Boggs. While acknowledging the affair, Boggs went on the offensive in order to combat the wave of negative press, denying many of the claims made by Adams. Boggs' rebuttal included an appearance on the ABC program 20/20 in which he presented his side of the story to Barbara Walters. In February 1989, an appeals court threw out $11.5 million of the initial lawsuit, ruling that Adams could not seek compensation for emotional distress. The remaining demand for $500,000 was settled out of court later that year for an undisclosed amount. ===Hall of Fame plaque cap logo controversy=== Before his retirement, Boggs was plagued by newspaper reports that the expansion Devil Rays gave him financial compensation in return for selecting a Devil Rays cap for his plaque at the Baseball Hall of Fame, though he has denied that any such condition was part of his contract. In light of those reports (and other rumors that teams were offering number retirement, money, or organizational jobs in exchange for the cap designation) the Hall decided in 2001 to change its practice of deferring to players' wishes regarding cap logo selection and reinforced the Hall's authority to determine with which cap the player would be depicted. Boggs is wearing a Boston cap on his plaque. ===Family=== Boggs' mother died in June 1986 in a car accident in Tampa while he was with the Red Sox. Shortly after her death, Boggs and his father bought a fish camp on U.S. 301 just south of Hawthorne, Florida, that they named Finway; his father operated it until shortly before he died. Wade and his wife Debbie have two children, Brett and Meagann. Wade Boggs was named one of the Top 10 Most Superstitious Athletes by Men's Fitness. ===Wrestling=== As a baseball player, Boggs made an appearance for the professional wrestling promotion World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1992. He appeared in a vignette with wrestler Mr. Perfect (Curt Hennig) in which Perfect played baseball. The two remained good friends afterward; 15 years later, in 2007, Boggs inducted the late Perfect into the WWE Hall of Fame. In the DVD The Life and Times of Mr. Perfect, Boggs related how Hennig saved his life, carrying Boggs to help after he had severely cut his leg climbing over a broken barbed wire fence during a hunting trip.The Life & Times of Mr. Perfect (2008) ===Television=== Boggs was one of the baseball players featured in the classic The Simpsons episode \\"Homer at the Bat,\\" in which he was recruited as a ringer by Mr. Burns for the Power Plant's softball team, only to later be knocked out in a bar fight by Barney Gumble. (The depicted fight was over whether Lord Palmerston or Pitt the Elder was England's greatest Prime Minister.) Boggs appeared as himself in the Cheers episode \\"Bar Wars\\" in which he was sent to the bar as an apology by a rival bar. He was accosted by the regulars who thought he was a fake. (Cheers writer Ken Levine revealed in 2009 that Boggs had promised to bring Kirstie Alley's panties back to spring training with him, but in fact, brought back his mistress Margo Adams' panties instead.)Levine, Ken (April 30, 2009). \\"Wade Boggs and Baaaaa-d behavior.\\" By Ken Levine.

In 2011, he also appeared in the Psych episode \\"Dead Man's Curveball.\\" In 2015, Boggs guest starred in the Season 10 premiere (\\"The Gang Beats Boggs\\") of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, in which characters in the show tried to drink more than 70 beers while flying across country, emulating a feat Boggs once allegedly accomplished during his career. Boggs denied that the number of beers was 64, and he reportedly told Charlie Day that he drank 107 beers in a day. One of the characters in the episode confuses Boggs with Boss Hogg; another character believes that Boggs is dead. In August 2017, Boggs served as a fill-in color commentator for some Red Sox games played in Tampa Bay and broadcast on New England Sports Network (NESN), working with play-by-play announcer Dave O'Brien. ==Bibliography== * Boggs!

Formed by Henry I, Duke of Guise, in 1576, the League intended the eradication of Protestants‚Äîmainly Calvinists or Huguenots‚Äîout of Catholic France during the Protestant Reformation, as well as the replacement of King Henry III. Pope Sixtus V, Philip II of Spain, and the Jesuits were all supporters of this Catholic party. == The Catholic League's political origins == Henry, Duke of Guise, founder and leader of the Catholic League Procession de la Ligue dans l'Ile de la Cit√© by Fran√ßois II Bunel (1522-1599). Mus√©e Carnavalet. Confraternities and leagues were established by French Catholics to counter the growing power of the Lutherans, Calvinists and members of the Reformed Church of France. The Protestant Calvinists at that time dominated much of the French nobility, leading to active persecution of Catholics in some regions. Under the leadership of Henry I, Duke of Guise, the Catholic confraternities and leagues were united as the Catholic League. Guise used the League not only to defend the Catholic cause but also as a political tool in an attempt to usurp the French throne.Carroll, p.432. The Catholic League aimed to preempt any seizure of power by the Huguenots and to protect French Catholics' right to worship. The Catholic League's cause was fueled by the doctrine Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus. Catholic Leaguers saw their fight against Calvinism (the primary branch of Protestantism in France) as a Crusade against heresy. The League's pamphleteers also blamed any natural disaster that occurred in France at the time as God's way of punishing France for tolerating the existence of the Calvinist heresy. After a series of bloody clashes, the French Wars of Religion (1562‚Äì1598), between Catholics and Protestants, the Catholic League formed in an attempt to break the power of the Calvinist gentry once and for all. The Catholic League saw the French throne under Henry III as too conciliatory towards the Huguenots. The League, similar to hardline Calvinists, disapproved of Henry III's attempts to mediate any coexistence between the Huguenots and Catholics. The Catholic League also saw moderate French Catholics, known as Politiques, as a serious threat. The Politiques were tired of the many tit for tat killings and were willing to negotiate peaceful coexistence rather than escalating the war. ==History of the League== Duke of Guise, leader of the Catholic League, by king Henry III, in 1588. The League immediately began to exert pressure on Henry III of France. Faced with this mounting opposition (spurred in part because the heir to the French throne, Henry of Navarre, was a Huguenot) he canceled the Peace of La Rochelle, re-criminalizing Protestantism and beginning a new chapter in the French Wars of Religion. However, Henry also saw the danger posed by the Duke of Guise, who was gaining more and more power. In the Day of the Barricades, King Henry III was forced to flee Paris, which resulted in Henry, Duke of Guise becoming the de facto ruler of France. Afraid of being deposed and assassinated, the King decided to strike first. On December 23, 1588, Henry III's guardsmen assassinated the Duke and his brother, Louis II and the Duke's son was imprisoned in the Bastille. However, this move did little to consolidate the King's power and enraged both the surviving Guises and their followers. As a result, the King fled Paris and joined forces with Henry of Navarre, the throne's Calvinist heir presumptive. Both the King and Henry of Navarre began building an army with which to besiege Paris. On August 1, 1589, as the two Henrys besieged the city and prepared for their final assault, Jacques Cl√©ment, a Dominican lay brother with ties to the League, successfully infiltrated the King's entourage, dressed as a priest, and assassinated him. This was retaliation for the killing of the Duke of Guise and his brother. As he lay dying, the King begged Henry of Navarre to convert to Catholicism, calling it the only way to prevent further bloodshed. However, the King's death threw the army into disarray and Henry of Navarre was forced to lift the siege. Henry IV, as Hercules vanquishing the Lernaean Hydra (i.e. the Catholic League), by Toussaint Dubreuil, circa 1600. Louvre Museum. Although Henry of Navarre was now the legitimate King of France, the League's armies were so strong that he was unable to capture Paris and was forced to retreat south. Using arms and military advisors provided by Elizabeth I of England, he achieved several military victories. However, he was unable to overcome the superior forces of the League, which commanded the loyalty of most Frenchmen and had the support of Philip II of Spain. The League then attempted to declare the Cardinal of Bourbon, Henry's uncle, as king Charles X of France on November 21, 1589, but his status as a prisoner of Henry of Navarre and his death in May 1590 removed all legitimacy from this gesture. Furthermore, the Cardinal refused to usurp the throne and supported his nephew, although to little avail. Unable to provide a viable candidate for the French throne (the League's support was split among several candidates, including Isabella, a Spanish princess, which made them appear to no longer have French interests at heart), the League's position weakened, but remained strong enough to keep Henry from besieging Paris. Finally, in a bid to peacefully end the war, Henry of Navarre was received into the Church on July 25, 1593 and was recognized as King Henry IV on February 27, 1594. He is purported to have said later, \\"Paris is well worth a Mass,\\" though some scholars question the veracity of this quotation. Under the rule of King Henry IV, the Edict of Nantes was passed, granting religious toleration and limited autonomy to the Huguenots and ensuring a lasting peace for France. Moreover, the Catholic League now lacked the threat of a Calvinist king and gradually disintegrated. ==Assessment== Historian Mack Holt argues that historians have sometimes over-emphasised the political role of the League at the expense of its religious and devotional character: ==See also== *Catholic League (disambiguation) for other similarly named coalitions. *Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Merc≈ìur, one of its leaders *Politiques, term applied to those who resisted the French Catholic League ==Citations== ==References== ::Baumgartner, Frederic J.

In Louisiana, it also refers to a specific, geographically and ethnically distinct group. ==Definition== The term has had various meanings according to locality, mostly implying multiracial people. In Louisiana, the Redbone cultural group consists mainly of the families of migrants to the state following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. These individuals may have ancestral ties to the Melungeons. The term \\"Redbone\\" became disfavored as it was a pejorative nickname applied by others; however, in the past 30 years, the term has begun to be used as the preferred description for some creole groups, including the Louisiana Redbones. ==Louisiana Redbone cultural group== The Louisiana Redbones historically lived in geographically and socially isolated communities in the southwestern Louisiana parishes, ranging from Sabine Parish in the northwest and Rapides Parish near the center of the state down to Calcasieu Parish in the southwest,Everett, C.S. \\"Brass Ankles/Red Bones,\\" Vol. Ed. Celeste Ray, 6 Encyclopedia of Southern Culture (University of North Carolina Press 2007), pp. 102-104 including parts of Orange County, Texas and Newton County, Texas. This area is roughly coextensive with what was once known as the Neutral Ground or Sabine Free State, an area of disputed sovereignty from 1806 to 1821 that was primarily bound on the east by the Calcasieu River and the Sabine River on the west.See Adams-On√≠s Treaty. Most families ancestral to the Louisiana Redbones came from South Carolina (where they were at times classified in some census records as \\"other free persons\\"), although some families came from other Southeastern states. A review of newspaper articles, land grants, census records and other documents referring to the Redbones indicates that the main settlements of Redbones to southwestern and south central Louisiana and southeastern Texas took place over the course of many years, although some members of Redbone families are noted as settling in the Neutral Ground before 1818 when the land was finally and officially considered part of the United States.Claims to Land Between the Rio Hondo and Sabine Rivers in Louisiana. Communicated to the Senate January 31, 1825 The ambiguity of the origins of the members of the Redbone community and the cultural attitudes held by those living in the same region as the Redbone community but who were not part of it is shown in a letter written in 1893 by Albert Rigmaiden, Calcasieu parish treasurer, to McDonald Furman, a South Carolinian who conducted private ethnological research. Rigmaiden wrote that he was unable to explain how the name Redbone originated and stated that > they are neither white nor black & as well as I can find out, the oldest > ones came from S.C many years ago ... they are not looked on as being -- > Negros -- Indian nor White people. Historically, members of the Redbone ethnic group lived in three areas. One community lived along Ten Mile Creek in Rapides Parish and Allen Parish. Members of this community were referred to as \\"Ten Milers\\"The Baton Rouge Daily Advocate, 28 August 1857 p. 2New Orleans Times-Picayune, 9 September 1877 or as \\"Red Bones.\\" * New Orleans Times-Picayune 6 August 1891 p.8 * New Orleans Times-Picayune 5 August 1891 p.1 * The New York Times 5 August 1891 * New Orleans Times Picayune 3 July 1897 p.8 in the 19th century. A second community was along Bearhead creek in what is now Beauregard Parish. A third community was established in Newton County, Texas and Orange County, Texas. 19th century newspapers tended to refer to members of this community simply as \\"mulattos,\\"Galveston Weekly News (Galveston, Tex.), Vol. 13, No. 17, Ed. 1, Tuesday, July 15, 1856The Weekly Telegraph (Houston, Tex.), Vol. 22, No. 19, Ed. 1 Wednesday, July 23, 1856 and members of the Texas community were not able to vote. In the frontier of Southwestern Louisiana, the settlers successfully resisted classification as non-white. In 1837 and 1849, several of the members of the Redbone community were indicted for illegal voting on the charge that they were of color rather than white. The state court found them all not guilty, thus establishing that the Redbone community would be legally considered white in the state of Louisiana. However, references to the Redbone community and its members in 19th century newspapers tend to be wildly divergent, ranging from making no mention of racial makeup,New Orleans Times- Picayune 3 July 1892 to stating that the members were white, to stating that the members were African AmericanThe Springfield Daily Republican 28 August 1857The New York Times 28 August 1857 to stating that the members were of Indian extractionNew Orleans Times Picayune 6 August 1891 to the assertion that the members were of unspecified mixed race.New Orleans Times Picayune 5 August 1891 These newspaper references do have the commonality of all pertaining to violent actions either in the community or perpetrated by members of the community. Two incidents of violence in Louisiana are particularly notable, one due to the statement of Webster Talma Crawford and one due to amount of newspaper coverage the incident received. The Westport Fight occurred December 24, 1881 in southern Rapides Parish. According to the Crawford account, friction between the more recent settlers and the Redbones had been simmering for much of the month before exploding into a fight that involved several families in the community and ended in the burning down of a store owned by some of the recent non-Redbone settlers. The Bearhead Creek incident took place in what is now southern Beauregard Parish on August 2, 1891. This battle also occurred due to similar tensions between Redbone and more recent, non-Redbone settlers. It left six men dead and several others wounded. * Dallis Morning News 4 August 1891 * Times-Picayune 5 August 1891, p.1 * Times Picayune August 6, 1891 * Baton Rouge Daily Advocate 7 August 1891 * Times-Picayune August 9, 1891 * New Orleans Item 11 August 1891 * Dallas Morning News 11 September 1891 In Texas, one incident of violence is notable. In May 1856 in Orange County, Texas, in the town of Madison (now Orange, Texas), Clark Ashworth was arrested for the theft of a hog. Ashworth was bound over for trial and his bond was paid by his cousin Sam Ashworth. Sam and a friend met the deputy sheriff Samuel Deputy who had arrested Clark on these charges and challenged him to a gun fight. The deputy sheriff arrested Sam Ashworth on the charges of abusive language from Negroes. Justice of the Peace A. N. Reading ruled that Sam Ashworth was a mulatto and not exclusively black, but neither was he white. Reading then sentenced Ashworth to 30 lashes on the bare back. The sheriff, Edward C. Glover, who was friendly to members of the Redbone community, allowed Sam to escape before sentence could be carried out. Sam Ashworth and his cousin, Jack Bunch, then murdered deputy sheriff Samuel Deputy as he crossed a river with his friend A. C. Merriman. Sheriff Glover organized a posse to hunt for Ashworth but only included Glover's and Ashworth's friends. The posse did not find the wanted men. Thereafter, other attempts were made to find Ashworth and Bunch that were not successful. In the aftermath of this incident, members of the Redbone community in Orange County were harassed; their homes and businesses were burned and plundered. Many living in Orange County moved to Louisiana. Over the coming weeks, a war raged between two groups. Those in support of Glover and the Redbones became known as \\"regulators\\" while those who supported Merriman became known as \\"moderators.\\"Galveston Weekly News June 6, 1856 - July 25, 1856 These incidents illustrate the friction between some (mainly new) non-Redbone settlers to the region and the existing Redbone population. It is incidents such as these that may have cemented the non-Redbone view of this population as being both clannish and violent; however, a close reading of the incidents reveals that the tensions causing the fights arose primarily due to the prejudices of the non-Redbone settlers. The census records from the early to late 19th century list many non-Redbone families settling in the same regions as the Redbones, and these settlers, from the evidence of the records, lived peacefully with members of the Redbone families, even, in many cases, marrying into Redbone families. During the days of the Jim Crow laws, schools in the location of the Redbones accepted Redbone students as white and a review of United States Census records in the late 19th and early 20th century shows that families traditionally considered as members of the Redbone community were mainly (although not always) recorded as white. Additionally, according to the marriage and census records, individuals who were from these families married either other members of the Redbone community or individuals who were listed in the census records as white and not members of the Redbone community.

Doubt on an emotional level is indecision between belief and disbelief. It may involve uncertainty, distrust or lack of conviction on certain facts, actions, motives, or decisions. Doubt can result in delaying or rejecting relevant action out of concern for mistakes or missed opportunities. Doubt ==Definition== The concept of doubt as a suspense between two contradictory propositions covers a range of phenomena: on a level of the mind it involves reasoning, examination of facts and evidence and on an emotional level believing and disbelieving In premodern theology doubt was \\"the voice of an uncertain conscience\\" and important to realize, because when in doubt \\"the safer way is not to act at all\\". ==Society== Doubt sometimes tends to call on reason. Doubt may encourage people to hesitate before acting, and/or to apply more rigorous methods. Doubt may have particular importance as leading towards disbelief or non-acceptance. Politics, ethics and law, with decisions that often determine the course of individual life, place great importance on doubt, and often foster elaborate adversarial processes to carefully sort through all available evidence. Societally, doubt creates an atmosphere of distrust, being accusatory in nature and de facto alleging either foolishness or deceit on the part of another. Such a stance has been fostered in Western European society since the Enlightenment, in opposition to tradition and authority. ==Psychology== Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic theory attributes doubt (which may be interpreted as a symptom of a phobia emanating from the ego) to childhood, when the ego develops. Childhood experiences, these theories maintain, can plant doubt about one's abilities and even about one's very identity. Cognitive mental as well as more spiritual approaches abound in response to the wide variety of potential causes for doubt. Behavioral therapy ‚Äî in which a person systematically asks his own mind if the doubt has any real basis ‚Äî uses rational, Socratic methods. This method contrasts to those of say, the Buddhist faith, which involve a more esoteric approach to doubt and inaction. Buddhism sees doubt as a negative attachment to one's perceived past and future. To let go of the personal history of one's life (affirming this release every day in meditation) plays a central role in releasing the doubts ‚Äî developed in and attached to ‚Äî that history. Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective climate of fear and doubt. ==Philosophy== Descartes employed Cartesian doubt as a pre-eminent methodological tool in his fundamental philosophical investigations. Branches of philosophy like logic devote much effort to distinguish the dubious, the probable and the certain. Much of illogic rests on dubious assumptions, dubious data or dubious conclusions, with rhetoric, whitewashing, and deception playing their accustomed roles. ==Theology== The Incredulity of Saint Thomas by Caravaggio. Doubt that god(s) exist may form the basis of agnosticism ‚Äî the belief that one cannot determine the existence or non- existence of god(s). It may also form other brands of skepticism, such as Pyrrhonism, which do not take a positive stance in regard to the existence of god(s), but remain negative. Alternatively, doubt over the existence of god(s) may lead to acceptance of a particular religion: compare Pascal's Wager. Doubt of a specific theology, scriptural or deistic, may bring into question the truth of that theology's set of beliefs. On the other hand, doubt as to some doctrines but acceptance of others may lead to the growth of heresy and/or the splitting off of sects or groups of thought. Thus proto-Protestants doubted papal authority, and substituted alternative methods of governance in their new (but still recognizably similar) churches. Christianity often debates doubt in the contexts of salvation and eventual redemption in an afterlife. This issue has become particularly important in Protestantism, which requires only the acceptance of Jesus, though more contemporary versions have arisen within the Protestant churches that resemble Catholicism. Doubts, by Henrietta Rae, 1886 Doubt as a path towards (deeper) belief lies at the heart of the story of Saint Thomas the Apostle. Note in this respect the theological views of Georg Hermes: > ... the starting-point and chief principle of every science, and hence of > theology also, is not only methodical doubt, but positive doubt. One can > believe only what one has perceived to be true from reasonable grounds, and > consequently one must have the courage to continue doubting until one has > found reliable grounds to satisfy the reason. Christian existentialists such as S√∏ren Kierkegaard suggest that for one to truly have belief in God, one would also have to doubt one's beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the belief would have no real substance. Belief is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to pragmatically justify the kind of total commitment involved in true theological belief or romantic love. Belief involves making that commitment anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have belief is at the same time to have doubt.Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments, ed. by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong, v. 1, Princeton University Press, 1992, pp. 21‚Äì57Soren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers, trans. Hong and Malantschuk, p. 399. ==Law== Most criminal cases within an adversarial system require that the prosecution proves its contentions beyond a reasonable doubt ‚Äî a doctrine also called the \\"burden of proof\\". This means that the State must present propositions which preclude \\"reasonable doubt\\" in the mind of a reasonable person as to the guilt of defendant. Some doubt may persist, but only to the extent that it would not affect a \\"reasonable person's\\" belief in the defendant's guilt. If the doubt raised does affect a \\"reasonable person's\\" belief, the jury is not satisfied beyond a \\"reasonable doubt\\". The jurisprudence of the applicable jurisdiction usually defines the precise meaning of words such as \\"reasonable\\" and \\"doubt\\" for such purposes. ==Science== > To doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient > solutions; both dispense with the necessity of reflection. ‚ÄîHenri Poincar√©, > Science and Hypothesis (1905) (from Dover abridged edition of 1952) The scientific method regularly quantifies doubt, and uses it to determine whether further research is needed.

Originally from the World of Greyhawk campaign setting, Vecna was described as a powerful wizard who became a lich. He was eventually destroyed, and his left hand and left eye were the only parts of his body to survive. Even after he achieved godhood‚Äîbeing a member of the third edition's default pantheon of D&D; gods (the pantheon of Oerth)Tweet, Jonathan, Cook, Monte, Williams, Skip. Player's Handbook (Wizards of the Coast, 2000)‚Äîhe is still described as missing both his left eye and left hand. Vecna's holy symbol is an eye in the palm of a left hand. Vecna's \\"right hand man\\" and then ultimately his betrayer is Kas the Bloody-Handed, a vampire whose sword, the Sword of Kas, is also an artifact. ==Publishing history== In the third supplement to the original Dungeons & Dragons rules (1974-1976) , Eldritch Wizardry, Brian Blume invented two artifacts he called the Hand and Eye of Vecna.Gygax: \\"Brian blume (sic) was the creator of the Eye and Hand of Vecna, and nary a detail of those items did he ever reveal to me‚Äîbeyond what appeared in print.\\" These were supposedly the only remnants of an evil lich, Vecna, who had been destroyed long ago. The name Vecna was an anagram of Vance, the surname of Jack Vance,D&D; Alumni: Open Grave the fantasy author whose \\"fire-and-forget\\" magic system is used in Dungeons & Dragons. The Hand and Eye of Vecna on the other hand were inspired by similar items that appear in the Eternal Champion series by Michael Moorcock (the Hand of Kwll and the Eye of Rhynn).Dragon magazine #371, January 2009, p.62 The Hand and Eye of Vecna were also mentioned in the 1979 Dungeon Master's Guide of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons's first edition (1977‚Äì1988), on page 124. During the \\"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons\\" years, Vecna was regarded only as a legend or myth, a long-destroyed legendary lich of great power, only able to threaten player characters who dared to use his Hand and Eye. Ten years later, in Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition's Dungeon Master's Guide (1989), Vecna's history was expanded under the description of his Hand and Eye. This information was further developed in 1993's Book of Artifacts. With the release of the adventure Vecna Lives! in 1990, written in support of The City of Greyhawk boxed set, Vecna finally appeared in person, re-imagined as a demigod, and the chief antagonist of the adventure. At the end of the adventure‚Äîpresuming the players defeat Vecna‚Äîhe is transported to the Ravenloft campaign setting.Cook, David. Vecna Lives! (TSR, 1990) However, it wasn't until 1998 that there was a Ravenloft-centered follow-through, Vecna Reborn.Cook, Monte.Vecna Reborn (TSR, 1998) In 2000, Wizards of the Coast released the last adventure to be written for D&D;'s 2nd edition rules, Die Vecna Die!, a three-part adventure tying Greyhawk to the Ravenloft and Planescape campaign settings. In this adventure, Vecna was given the rank of a lesser god.Cordell, Bruce, and Steve Miller. Die Vecna Die! (TSR, 2000) Die Vecna Die! set up the transition between the second and third editions of D&D.; According to Shannon Appelcline, the adventure \\"touched upon the oldest locales and the most ancient myths of the D&D; game\\" by playing the Eye and Hand of Vecna against the cambion demigod Iuz. Wizards of the Coast continued the character's theme of ascending godhood in Dungeons & Dragons Third Edition (2000‚Äì2002) with the Player's Handbook (2000) listing him as a Lesser deity. Third Edition further raised Vecna's profile in the game, making him a member of the game's \\"core pantheon\\". Vecna's alignment was changed from Lawful Evil to Neutral Evil in Third Edition, and no in-game explanation has surfaced. Vecna's role in the 3rd edition Greyhawk setting was defined in the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer (2000).Holian, Gary, Erik Mona, Sean K Reynolds, and Frederick Weining. Living Greyhawk Gazetteer (Wizards of the Coast, 2000) Vecna is detailed in Deities and Demigods (2002).Redman, Rich, Skip Williams, and James Wyatt. Deities and Demigods (Wizards of the Coast, 2002) Vecna appears in the revised Player's Handbook (2003) for Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 edition (2003‚Äì2007).Tweet, Jonathan, Cook, Monte, Williams, Skip. Player's Handbook (Wizards of the Coast, 2003) His priesthood is detailed for this edition in Complete Divine (2004).Noonan, David. Complete Divine (Wizards of the Coast, 2004) Vecna was one of the deities featured in Libris Mortis (2004).Collins, Andy and Bruce R Cordell. (Wizards of the Coast, 2004) Vecna and his priesthood were expanded upon in Dragon #348, in the \\"Core Beliefs\\" column. Vecna appears as one of the deities described in the 2008 Dungeon Master's Guide for Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition. He is primarily the god of secrets.James Wyatt. Dungeon Masters Guide (Wizards of the Coast, 2008). The Hand of Vecna has also made its return for this edition of the game. Vecna is given a set of statistics in Open Grave (2008). Vecna is the name of Wizards of the Coast's server that hosts and handles the new online character builder tool. In the 5th Edition Dungeon Master's Guide, released in 2014, Vecna appears as a member of the \\"Dawn War Pantheon\\", which is mostly derived from the 4th Edition pantheon. He is also included in the Player's Handbook as one of the deities of Greyhawk. In both, he is listed as the god of evil secrets. Additionally, both his hand and eye are listed as artifacts. ==Description== Vecna is usually depicted as a powerful magician resembling a desiccated corpse missing his left hand and eye. A constant theme in the adventures in which the character appears is Vecna's never-ending quest for power, ending, should he succeed, with Vecna as the only deity in existence. ==Relationships== Vecna has few allies, and countless enemies. In 2nd and 3rd Edition, his greatest, and perhaps only true ally is the mysterious entity known as the Serpent. In 4th edition, the Open Grave book introduces Osterneth, the Bronze Lich, as the mightiest servant of Vecna. The famed cambion lich, Acererak, once served Vecna, but the current status of their relationship is unknown. Among Vecna's staunchest foes are Kas, Iuz, Saint Cuthbert, the Lady of Pain, Pholtus, and the Circle of Eight. He is also opposed by the Old Faith and the Silent Ones. In 4th edition, Vecna's main foes in the realm of death and undeath are Kas, Orcus and the Raven Queen (though he would rather she rule the dead than Orcus). Among the gods, Ioun is something of Vecna's antithesis, for she would share with the world all the knowledge he would keep secret. ==Dogma== ===Scriptures=== Being a secretive cult, there are no real collections of Vecnan teachings. However, copies of the Book of Vile Darkness are highly prized by the cult for Vecna's role in that work's development. The Open Grave book offers the \\"Scroll of Mauthereign\\", which offers a twisted version of Vecna's history and tells his followers that committing evil acts is holy and righteous. ==Worshippers== Vecna's cult is very secretive, and cells have been uncovered, at various points in history, in Diamond Lake, Greyhawk, and Verbobonc. Temples to Vecna have also been reported in the Pomarj town of Highport and Erelhei-Cinlu, the debased city at the heart of the Vault of the Drow. ===Hierarchy=== Each position in Vecna's cult is named for a certain body part. At the top is Vecna himself, followed by the Voice of Vecna, which can only be filled by Vecna's manifestation. Next is the Heart of Vecna, the high priest of the cult. The last known Heart of Vecna was Diraq Malcinex of Ket, who was slain by adventurers in 581 CY. Immediately below the Heart of Vecna are two bizarre monsters known as the Hand and the Eye. The Eye of Vecna creature appears as a slender humanoid with an eyeball for a head, whereas the Hand of Vecna appears as a stocky humanoid with a huge left hand where its head should be. Individual congregations are known as organs. Each organ is led by a Thought of Vecna. Lesser priests are known as Memories of Vecna. Lay members of the cult consist of the Teeth, Fingers, Blood, and Spawn of Vecna. The Teeth of Vecna are made up of wizards, and specialize in arcane spellcasting and crafting magical items for the cult. The Fingers of Vecna consist mainly of thieves, who engage in various forms of subterfuge. The Blood of Vecna are mainly warriors charged with protection and enforcement of the cult and its goals. The Spawn of Vecna are the lowest in the cult hierarchy, and consist of the common people who honor the Lich Lord. In 4th edition, the Open Grave book shows the leader of the cult of Vecna is a lich named Mauthereign. Even when Osterneth, the Bronze Lich, is Vecna's mightiest servant, her position is not revealed among his files. ===Other Vecnan organizations=== Other Vecnan organizations are known to exist outside of the mainstream cult, and some may have similar or identical names. Relations between these groups and the mainstream cult may vary. Known examples are the Eyes of Vecna (a cult of undeath consisting mainly of rogues), the Fingers of Vecna (Vecna's personal guard), and the Ebon Triad (a heretical cult seeking to merge Vecna, Hextor, and Erythnul into a single entity). In 4th edition, a secret group known as the Keepers of the Forbidden Lore is devoted to Vecna. Unlike most Vecna worshippers, the Keepers reject most of the nasty and evil rituals and beliefs associated with the god; they worship him as the God of Secrets, and believe that there is some knowledge too evil for the world to know. They instead hunt down secrets and information they deem to be too dangerous for the world at large and keep it secret in the name of Vecna. This puts them in opposition to mainstream followers of Vecna who regard the Keepers as heretics, and makes them enemies of Ioun and her followers, who believe all knowledge should be available for everybody and the moral obligations on how to use it rest on the shoulders of the individuals involved. ==Artifacts== The Hand and Eye of Vecna, as shown on the cover of Vecna Lives! (TSR, 1990) ===Hand and Eye of Vecna=== The left hand and eye of Vecna's original \\"mortal\\" lich form, which have never been replaced in his later more powerful incarnations, are now high-valued and very dangerous magical artifacts. To use the powers of the Hand of Vecna or the Eye of Vecna one is required to cut off one's own corresponding body part and affix Vecna's in its place. These artifacts were introduced in the third supplement to the original D&D; rules, Eldritch Wizardry. They went on to appear in all subsequent D&D; editions. They are considered classic items in D&D;, with Mordicai Knode of Tor.com commenting \\"We all agree that the Hand and Eye of Vecna are the best artifacts, right?\\"http://www.tor.com/2013/05/23/adad-the-old-firm/ ===Sword of Kas=== Vecna created the Sword of Kas for his greatest servant, which contains a \\"portion of his consciousness.\\" This interpretation is relatively recent. As per the 1st edition Dungeon Master's Guide, Vecna only procured this most powerful sword for his chief lieutenant. Similarly, depending on edition and source, its appearance has varied, from a short sword to a wavy bladed two hander. However, it is consistently depicted that the Sword is inextricably tied to Vecna's relics. ===Other artifacts=== A number of Vecna's other body parts are presented as minor artifacts in Die Vecna Die!, including the First Digit (right thumb), Second Digit (right index finger), Third Digit (right middle finger), Last Digit (right pinky finger), Incisors (a pair of inappropriately named fang-like canines), Molar, Scalp, Skin, Heart, Foot (left), and Right Eye. These artifacts are collectively known in D&D; 3rd Edition as the Fragments of Vecna. The Compendium Maleficarum is a book of spells, doctrines, and secrets crafted entirely from bone (even the pages) and penned in blood, that is on par with the Fragments of Vecna. The Tome of Shared Secrets is an illustrated bestiary of relic status, with the ability to impart knowledge of dark and evil creatures at the cost of a portion the user's life force. Those two books were superseded in 5th edition by a combined Book of Vile Darkness, a legacy of dark secrets started by Vecna. The Rod of the Whispered One, while not nearly so powerful as the Sword of Kas, is another item Vecna crafted to connect himself with his highest lieutenants. The final issue of Dragon Magazine, issue #359, featured rules for the \\"Left Ear of Vecna\\" as a minor artifact. It grants the owner magical bonuses to hearing and resisting sonic attacks, spell-like abilities to inflict deafness, grant clairaudience and create sonic blasts, and enables them to understand any spoken language. A lich known as Osterneth possesses the \\"Heart of Vecna\\" according to the Open Grave sourcebook. ===Head of Vecna=== The Head of Vecna was a hoax that one adventuring party played on another in a campaign run by game master Mark Steuer. One of the groups tricked the other into going on a quest for the Head of Vecna, a hoax artifact that was supposedly similar to his Hand and Eye, but was simply an ordinary severed head. The hoax takes advantage of the fact that the Eye and Hand require a person to remove their own eye or hand and replace it with the artifact to function. The characters involved in the story reasoned that they needed to decapitate themselves to gain the powers of the Head of Vecna, and several members of the group actually fought over which character would get to have his head cut off and replaced. After the third character died, the joke was revealed.Daily Illuminator, December 6, 1996 The Head of Vecna was later mentioned by Morte, a floating skull in Planescape: Torment, when discussing his lack of a body, made a canonical appearance in the 2000 AD&D; campaign Die Vecna Die!, and was the subject of a short adventure on the Wizards of the Coast website in 2007.The Head of Vecna: A D&D; Adventure for Characters Levels 1‚Äì12 Familiarity with the Head of Vecna was cited as an example characteristic of an avid role-playing gamer by writer David M. Ewalt. ==Character history== Vecna was born as a human, centuries ago as a member of the untouchable caste in the Flan city of Fleeth on Oerth. He was initially trained by his mother, Mazzel, in the art of magic, before she was executed by the government of Fleeth for practicing witchcraft. Vowing revenge, Vecna eventually assumed a mastery of the dark arts achieved by no mortal before or since. Some say this achievement was due to direct tutelage by Mok'slyk the Serpent, believed to be the personification of arcane magic itself. Nearly one thousand years after his birth, Vecna, now a lich and ruler of a great and terrible empire (in the Sheldomar Valley, centered near the modern-day Rushmoors), laid siege to the city of Fleeth with an army of arcane spellcasters and undead. Legend has it that Vecna was nearly slain in this battle by clerics channeling the power of Pholtus, the god of light. The clerics unleashed a great burst of light, which hit Vecna primarily on his left side. Vecna was rescued and brought to safety by one of his wizard generals, a cambion named Acererak (who would one day himself become a mighty demilich). Vecna eventually recovered. On the verge of conquering Fleeth, the officials of the city came before him to beg for mercy. They offered up the entire city and her wealth if only Vecna would spare the lives of her citizens. When Vecna was not satisfied, the officials offered their own lives. Vecna gave one of their number, Artau, and his family, over to his lieutenant, Kas, who spent the entire day torturing and murdering them before the other officials. Still unsatisfied, Vecna slaughtered all within the city, and had their heads stacked before the officials, with those of their family members prominent. Vecna then granted his mercy, granting the officials leave to depart, and promising them his protection for the rest of their lives. At his empire's height, Vecna was betrayed and destroyed by his most trusted lieutenant, a vampire called Kas the Bloody-Handed, using a magical sword that Vecna himself had crafted for him, now known as the Sword of Kas. Only his left hand and his eye survived the battle, perhaps because of the previous events in Fleeth. Vecna did not stay gone forever, and rose as a demigod of magic and secrets in the world of Greyhawk. In 581 CY, his cult helped set events in motion that would have granted him the power of a greater god, but the plan was ultimately foiled. After these events, Vecna ended up imprisoned in the demiplane of Ravenloft, but broke free again later, emerging with the power of a greater god, after absorbing the power of Iuz. He then broke free into the city of Sigil, where he came perilously close to rearranging all existence to his whims. (Vecna's multiverse shattering campaign in Sigil is used as an in-universe way to explain the differences between the 2nd and 3rd editions of Dungeons & Dragons.) When Vecna was ejected from Sigil by a party of adventurers, Iuz was freed and Vecna returned to Oerth greatly reduced in power, though still a lesser god. In the events of the Living Greyhawk campaign setting, Vecna's machinations allowed him to reappear on the prime material plane and retake his place in the Oerth pantheon. ==Writings== At some point in his history, Vecna penned a tome known as Ordinary Necromancy. He is also rumored to have made significant additions to the Book of Vile Darkness. Although not actually penned by him, the Book of Keeping (a book of Yugoloth summoning) is heavily linked with the cult of Vecna, as the cultists have the only known copies that are free of the intentional errors introduced into the book by the fiends that wrote the volume as a trap for would-be summoners. ==Reception== Vecna was #4 on Game Rant's 2020 \\"10 Must-Have NPCs In Dungeons & Dragons Lore To Make Your Campaigns Awesome\\" list ‚Äî the article states that \\"Aside from being a deity himself, Vecna can take on the role of an Undying Patron for Warlocks. Campaigns with a focus on gods, the divine, and the infernal may benefit from having Vecna. Vecna's cunning means he'll likely have a scheme to achieve domination over whatever pantheon he becomes a part of.\\" ==In other media== * In the 1999 CRPG Planescape: Torment, Fall-From-Grace (a puritan succubus) asks Morte (a disembodied floating skull) \\"What are you?\\", to which Morte replies \\"Me? I'm the head of Vecna.\\" A similar conversation between the two involves Morte saying \\"It's a long story involving the head of Vecna. I don't want to talk about it.\\" Grace responds with an amused \\"That was you?\\" Also in the same game, the Eye of Vecna is a rare item dropped by greater glabrezu. * In Slash'EM, the Hand of Vecna is a very useful artifact, gained after killing Vecna himself in the Chaotic Quest. Vecna himself is one of the more difficult foes in the game. * In Critical Role, Vecna is the main villain in the last arc of the first campaign. He is also included in the associated Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting, though he is called \\"The Whispered One\\" due to copyright constraints. ==References== ==Further reading== * Brown, Anne.

In 1820, he moved to Arkansas where he worked as a surveyor. Conway formed a surveying business with two of his brothers. Conway's company took over the land that would later become the city of Little Rock, Arkansas and he is known as the founder of that city. Conway purchased a large cotton plantation named Walnut Hill in what is now Lafayette County (then part of Hempstead County). ==Political career== In 1832, Conway became the surveyor-general of the Arkansas Territory and served in that position until 1836. Conway became the first elected Governor of Arkansas when it became a state in 1836. His administration focused on developing schools and roads. He established a state military to patrol the western frontier and worked to have a federal arsenal built in Little Rock. He worked to get funding for a state penitentiary. He pushed for the establishment of a state library and university but was unsuccessful. Conway left office in 1840 and returned to his plantation. He continued to be active in public affairs. ==Personal life== While living in Lafayette County, Arkansas, Conway met Mary Jane Bradley, who had also migrated with her family from Tennessee. They were married December 21, 1825. They had ten children, five of whom died in infancy or early childhood. Conway was the brother of Arkansas Governor Elias Nelson Conway, brother of Congressman Henry Wharton Conway, first cousin of Senator Ambrose Hundley Sevier and Governor Henry Massey Rector. He was third cousin of Confederate General and Virginia Governor James Lawson Kemper. ==Death and legacy== Conway died from the complications of pneumonia on March 3, 1855. He is buried at the Conway Cemetery Historic State Park, at the site of the old Walnut Hill plantation, near Bradley, Arkansas. Conway helped establish Lafayette Academy in Greene County, Tennessee.

An ideal is a principle or value that an entity actively pursues as a goal and holds above other, more petty concerns perceived as being less meaningful. Terms relating to the general belief in ideals include ethical idealism, moral idealism, and principled idealism. A person with a particular insistence on holding to ideals, often even at considerable cost as a consequence of holding such a belief, is usually called an ethical idealist, moral idealist, principled idealist, or simply an idealist for short. The latter term is not to be confused with metaphysical idealism, a viewpoint about existence and rationality unrelated to the ethical concept. The term ideal is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small from independent churches to social activist groups to political parties to nation states and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for decision making, with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute fuzzy concepts without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including philosophy both historically and more recently. In the broader context of ethics, the very terms ethical and ideal are inherently tied. Philosopher Rushworth Kidder has stated that \\"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\\". Whether based in religious traditions or fundamentally secular, an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of honesty yet expresses the willingness to lie to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of friendship but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well known as an intellectual criticism of Kantianism and its categorical imperative. Broader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include Christian ethics, Jewish ethics, and Platonist ethics. The development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, their analysis looking particularly at the psychological foresight and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. Democratic peace theory in international relations study is an example. Idealism in the context of foreign relations generally involves advocating for institutions that enact measures such as international law implementation in order to avoid warfare. A variety of different issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as Terry Eagleton have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals winds up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter person's set of principles losing the philosophically appealing nature of the former person's views. As well, thinkers such as Richard Rorty have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing somewhat separately from human nature in the first place. In the political context, scholars such as Gerald Gaus have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy, ideals getting in the way of incremental yet meaningful progress. Historically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \\"Age of Enlightenment\\" include Immanuel Kant and John Locke. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal morality based around reason. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals followed by The Critique of Practical Reason, The Metaphysics of Morals, Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, and Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, the later commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking. To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between morality and the natural world, with empirical analysis of human psychology dovetailing with ethical analysis. In terms of demonstrated life experience and the proliferation of personal stories via mass media, multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as moral examples for others to draw understanding from. For instance, United States leaders known for their idealism include presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama, while European officials similarly known for such ethical attitudes include Konrad Adenauer, Prime Minister of Germany, Charles de Gaulle, Prime Minister of France and senior general, and Vaclav Havel, dissident and President of Czechoslovakia. Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia has gained attention in terms of the central and south Americas. Private individuals known for their prominent ideals include Fred Rogers, U.S. television personality, and Terry Fox, Canadian athlete and charity advocate. Multiple idealistically optimistic characters have been featured in prominent creative media, the Star Trek franchise centered around space exploration being a well-known instance of fictional idealism. In addition, musical artists known for creating songs with an atmosphere of idealism include singer-songwriters David Bowie, Curtis Mayfield, and Tom Paxton, with bands The Beatles, Queen, and Maze being examples as well. ==Background and history== ===Applications of different terminology=== The term \\"idealism\\" and the related labeling, whether self-applied or otherwise, of individuals and/or groups as being \\"idealistic\\" or against such viewpoints has a certain complexity to it. In the sense of metaphysical thought, \\"idealism\\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality; the question of whether or not potential knowledge exists independently to humanity or whether such knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind gets debated. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \\"idealist\\" as applied to particular philosophers, with them often possessing rather nuanced views, attracts considerable controversy. In colloquial language, the term \\"ideal\\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in cooking the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \\"ideal\\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are often distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \\"ethical ideal\\" as such. ===Definitions and justifications=== Ancient Greek philosopher Plato argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that reason discovers the principles rather than simply creates them. American scholar Nicholas Rescher has drawn upon ancient philosophy to state that the metaphysical nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \\"useful fictions\\" in terms of their special existence, writing in his book Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals, Nonetheless, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher Plato. To him, ideals represent self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through reason rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possess a certain kind of metaphysical independence according to Plato. With respect to specific definitions, U.S. philosopher Ralph Barton Perry has defined idealistic morality as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book The Moral Economy, Focusing on the practical nature of moral choices, recent scholarly analysis in journals such as Academia Revista Latinoamerica de Administracion have framed definitions in terms of social decision making, one study stating, Ethical idealism has often defined either in relative comparison to or in direct contradiction to the doctrine of moral relativism. The latter concept has been associated with a philosophical skepticism in which an individual questions the value of commonly held cultural principles. A strongly relativist person will, scholars have stated, judge morality according to particular circumstances. Individuals with stridently idealistic beliefs and little sense of relativism have been known as \\"absolutists\\" while those with principles seeking to synthesize those two concepts have been known as \\"situationists\\". ===Historical development and recent analysis=== Ideals from antiquity to the Age of Reason Ancient cynics such as Diogenes dismissed optimistic views of human nature as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass. In the wider context of ethics, the very terms \\"ethical\\" and \\"ideal\\" have been inherently tied. Philosopher Rushworth Kidder has stated that \\"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\\". Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human civilization. The types of ideals dealt with during the history of philosophy have varied widely over the many centuries, many conceptions existing of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experiences. From the far distant history to today, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and even general morals of whatever kind. The works of British thinker David Hume, for instance, explicitly declared people to be inherent \\"slaves\\" to their passions. When articulating a particularly nuanced theory of morality, Hume's writings labeled it folly to emphasize what people hopefully wish to achieve and additionally argued that enforcing ideals without proper grounding in practical, already existing mores undermines society itself. Cynics of the ancient world frequently referred to humanity in general as not only not perfectible but fundamentally depraved. The historical Greek figure of Diogenes, while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day. He sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags. The Sermon on the Mount constituted an important moment in the development of Christian ethics, Jesus setting forth ideals that later spread throughout the Roman Empire. In both Jewish ethics and later Christian ethics, however, advocacy for a stridently idealistic view of the world, in which principles get held over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations, has attracted praise. Golden rule based moral standards have involved restrictions such as holding back the quest for vengeance by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion, this example being later evaluated as the tit-for-tat strategy in game theory. In terms of Christianity, the teachings of the Gospels have constituted an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under Jesus' example, have gotten called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expect to be treated back. In the context of the various religious movements of the 1st and 2nd century in the Roman Empire, the ideals of Christian thinking constituted a radical break with the ethical doctrines that had been advocated by those in power. Rejecting views of the upper classes, both during the empire's time and previously in Greco-Roman civilization, the rising Christian community set forth clear-cut principles based on narratives such as the Sermon on the Mount, which was included in the Gospel of Matthew. Specifically, Jesus' exhortations for his followers to \\"turn the other cheek\\" as well to \\"love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\\" and practice other idealistic behaviors established a general view emphasizing spiritual standards over material concerns. Despite the degree that Christian viewpoints contradicted Roman traditions, early Christianity spread throughout the Empire and became a particularly robust force in the empire's society by the 4th century. Reasons for the appeal included not only the idealistic messages but also the similarity between the belief system and previously popular mystery cults. Finally, emperor Theodosius the Great made Christianity the official religion of the entire realm. While Western nations widely retained the influences of Jewish and Christian morality over multiple centuries, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers both before and after the fall of the Roman Empire pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many did so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or implicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \\"moral relativism\\". As the arguments have gone, human beings have been little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act based in any sort of larger principle; survival has remained people's core instinct such that civilization, through relativist eyes, functions as a thin veneer over base instincts. Multiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. The course of the \\"Age of Enlightenment\\" (also known as the \\"Age of Reason\\") from the 17th to the 19th centuries, being a movement that in large part centered around the application of rationality-based principles such as the scientific method upon human nature, caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \\"benevolence\\" attracted widespread attention in terms of governance, with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of the arts, increased educational efforts, effective stewardship of national resources, and so on. This movement increased trends away from absolute monarchy and dictatorship towards that of constitutional monarchy and republican government. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature when applied to socio-political organization became later known as \\"classical liberalism\\". Philosopher John Locke, a prominent figure of the Enlightenment era, articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature. In terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical Enlightenment thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of rationality that can be found through logical analysis by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one's desires made up the basis for morality through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience that became possible to tease out due to personal study constituted Locke's theoretical background for ideals and broader ethics. With respect to social order, Locke's highly influential writings applied rational principles to governance in support of the doctrine of social contract theory, which permeated Enlightenment discussions about the best form of organizing a country. Locke's works such as the Two Treatises of Government set forth an ethical framework in which rational individuals establish a government in order to guarantee their fundamental rights and possess the understanding that they not only can but should alter said government when rational application of the fair-minded \\"rule of law\\" has broken down. Thus, Locke labeled fundamental change as a natural consequence of when liberty no longer receives protection. He criticized competing theories such as the divine right of kings, which the thinker viewed as folly. In terms of individual thinking on principles, Locke never wrote a single work laying down in depth his conceptual understanding of ethics and morality. However, Lockean thought as described in various writings have emphasized holding to prominent ideals about human behavior in terms of the rational capacity for good, a particular topic of Locke's concern having been the power of education. Locke wrote of its importance within the pages of Some Thoughts Concerning Education. Outlining the best way to rear children in his eyes, Lockean arguments stressed that virtuous actions by adults arose as a direct result of the habits of body and mind taught during youth by forward thinking instructors. Locke wrote in his work An Essay Concerning Human Understanding dividing rational understanding into three inherent areas of scope, the philosopher defining the second as \\"practica\\" and describing it as, Thinker Immanuel Kant's views on idealistic morality aligned the human ethical experience with that of rationality and the greater world, the philosopher labeling immorality not only wrong on principle but illogical. German philosopher Immanuel Kant's particular view of human nature and intellectual inquiry, later summed up under the banner of \\"Kantianism\\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \\"categorical imperative\\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has to be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. In Kant's writings, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well. Works authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals followed by The Critique of Practical Reason, The Metaphysics of Morals, Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View, Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking. Within the pages of Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View in particular, the philosopher articulated a vision of people as by their very essence driven by meaningful ethics. Through the lens of Kant's doctrine, no ironclad divide has existed between morality and the natural world, with empirical analysis of human psychology dovetailing with studies of people's ideals. The philosopher's metaphysics tied closely with his socio-political views and belief in evolutionary advancement, Kant writing in The Critique of Pure Reason in detail, Summing up Kant's views on ideals specifically in context, scholar Frederick P. Van De Pitte has written about the primacy of rationality to the philosopher, Pitte remarking, Ideals in post- Enlightenment thought Enlightenment influenced beliefs on idealistic ethics have contributed to the evolutionary history of human rights as a concept, this leading to expressive documents such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Broadly speaking, Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking, with figures such as the aforementioned Hobbes, Kant, and Locke dominating debate. In the shadow of material such as the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, itself an evolution from the earlier American Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States as well as similar such documents in the history of human rights, many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an optimistic view in which even radically different cultures possess shared ethical values common to humanity in general that both nations and individuals can aspire towards. This idealism has found particular emphasis in discussions of socio-political issues. Through this moralistic lens, all people by nature of their mere existence have been thought to have been born inherently good, inherently equal, and inherently free. This doctrine has been seen to hold all bigotry, discrimination, and prejudice as inherently wrong not only ethically but logically as well. Although varying greatly in application based on the social context, the framework of the age of reason has overall continued to represent the intellectual stream that has fed the waters of more recent discussions. A defining inflection point of this trend has been the experience of World War II and the Holocaust. The historical memory has been argued to have created a sort of dualistic approach to ideology in which capitalistic democracy, centered around classical liberalism, gets inherently pitted forever in struggle with tyrannies, centered around the stratification of various groups over others and mass misery. In the aftermath of the end of the Cold War, studies upon moral idealism have often asked if Enlightenment viewpoints face an inherent intellectual challenge that the doctrines cannot eventually overcome. Working in the context of the rise of fascism during the early 20th century, Ernst Cassirer stalwartly defended Enlightenment idealism, stating that progress tended to \\"self-liberation\\". Examples of specific post-Enlightenment philosophers who have garnered notice for their defense of the movement's ideals include Ernst Cassirer. The thinker's advocacy for liberal democracy at a time when the rise of fascism and other doctrines faced an environment that found his views unfashionable. A German Jew who had staunchly supported the Weimar Republic in power before the Nazi Party's takeover and fled for his family's own safety, Cassirer wrote philosophical investigations of art, language, myth, and science. In terms of human progress, Cassierer remarked that \\"what is truly permanent in human nature is not any condition in which it once existed and from which it has fallen; rather it is the goal for which and toward which it moves.\\" This theories merged the study of human cultures and particularly their symbols with higher philosophy, Cassierer strongly defending the path of history as that of \\"man's progressive self-liberation.\\" With the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different societies, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of egalitarian values previously thought of as radical or undesirable by center-left, moderate, and center-right individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the Millennials, and those political extremists of the global far- right movement, the social trend often called \\"new nationalism\\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \\"moral idealist\\". As well, the question of the fundamental biological advancement of humanity itself has attracted much attention. What a transhuman or even posthuman individual would possess terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings has remained an open question. In the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity as a whole has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals over the past multiple centuries has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker Richard Rorty, a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent nature while still lauding general social progress. In contrast, multiple scholars concerned with issues such as global climate change and potential use of weapons of mass destruction in future warfare have lamented particular technological advancements and related alterations in broader social culture, the thinkers arguing that fundamental moral progress has truly not occurred given forms of increasing danger to humanity. The evolution of particular scientific areas such as artificial intelligence research has generated concerns about long- term threats and the possibility of eventual human extinction. Critical views have also been set forth by various religious philosophers who have argued that humanity remains full of sin in its general behavior, this trend perhaps even getting worse as time has passed. Multiple secular thinkers have made similar comments about the proliferation of moral breakdown, particularly in the context of the rise of post-factual politics and the related issue of politicization. Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a Jesuit priest and scientist, wrote that moral progress and biological evolution would converge to unify all in an idealistic existence with God. A contrasting approach arising in the 20th century and continuing to receive notice is that of prominent Roman Catholic figure Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. He famously predicted that humanity will eventually advance in terms of not just scientific development through natural and engineered biological evolution but also idealistic morality to a sort of final oneness regarded by him as the 'Omega Point', a mode of existence taking place not only without hatred, pain, and misery but with perfect collective action and consciousness. Known as the \\"Catholic Darwin\\", his view of evolutionary advancement came out of a religious context through which he identified humanity's final state with Jesus Christ as the \\"Logos\\" or sacred \\"Word\\". To Chardin, the power of love has constituted a sort of elemental drive as strong as that of fire and other natural forces. A geologist, paleontologist, and Jesuit priest, Chardin was later described by a Cyclopedia of World Authors volume as having \\"combined his scientific beliefs and Christian convictions in an idealistic [and] evolutionary vision of the universe.\\" Pope Benedict XVI notably made an approving reference to Chardin's views within a reflection on the Epistle to the Romans during a vespers service in Aosta Cathedral, the Pope asserting before the audience, ==Debates and discussions involving ethical theory== ===In applied ethics=== The specific philosophical school known as \\"applied ethics\\" has frequently involved discussion over ideals and the desirability of holding to them or abandoning them, depending on the context. In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance has gotten assigned to certain social preferences over others as a way to resolve disputes effectively. In analysis of legal theory, for instance, judges have been sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of truth, which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of broader social equality, which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case. Said judges have also been required to consider the principle of the right to a speedy trial as well, which places limits on the previous two ideals given the time involved in ferreting out details. In an August 2005 address, philosopher Richard Rorty remarked upon the \\"moral idealism common to Platonism, Judaism, and Christianity\\" and the related notion of strictly specified principles through the lens of applied ethics, asserting to a group of business professionals, ===In medical ethics=== Academic specialists such as physician and scholar Matja≈æ Zwitter have raised concerns that inadequate preparation in medical school, with instructors failing to teach challenges including having to work inside substandard facilities and facing difficult time restrictions, set young professionals up to have their idealism drained quickly when they begin real practice. This, the argument has gone, causes major issues in terms of medical ethics. Individual physicians possibly have faced unfair burdens due to general issues with national healthcare systems getting placed onto their shoulders, with this making their idealistic views falter even more. Fading idealism has been cited as a contributor to the serious issue of burnout among medical professionals. ===In secular ethics=== With the widespread movement away from traditional religious beliefs in both the Anglosphere and other nations during the 20th century and into the 21st century, the question of to what extent the ideals held by the irreligious owe a debt to particular faith groups has attracted much attention. Specifically, certain authors known as \\"new atheists\\" such as biologist Richard Dawkins and journalist Christopher Hitchens have argued that newly emerging forms of secular ethics constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoinder to previous forms of \\"traditional values\\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion. As well, scholars regardless of personal faith background have commented about the complex nature of ethics when taken from spiritual movements. ==Idealistic appeals in practice== ===In conceptual and historical politics=== Greek statesman Pericles' vision of Athenian democracy stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians. Ideals have played a role in politics for millennia. For example, iconic Greek statesman Pericles famously presented an ideal-based view of the Mediterranean world. In 431, shortly after the Peloponnesian War had started, Pericles' \\"Funeral Oration\\" made to commemorate fallen soldiers, described for posterity by the historian Thucydides, presented a view of Athens and the city-state's broader civilization that emphasized a sense of cleverness and open-mindedness that Pericles believed gave it the strength to rise to different challenges. Other early historical figures known for appealing to ethical ideals in their oratory include Roman statesman Cato the Elder, the figure's commentary on Hellenized values leading to his moral appeal among supporters. In contrast to what he saw as decadence spreading into Rome and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics. Most political revolutions have drawn support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding power, having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the French Revolution, the rhetorical principles of \\"Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©\\" (English: \\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\\") got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals; the new nation state constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new religion. Many political movements in modern times have centered themselves upon multiple ideals found to be mutually reinforcing. Recent examples have included the peace movement and the broader opposition expressed worldwide to war in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as elsewhere. In many cases current and historical, instances have popped up in which proclaimed ideals simply weren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it. In British English, politicians openly changing their opinions in defiance of previous assertions about their ethics have been labeled as making a \\"u-turn\\". In American English, similar individuals have been pejoratively called \\"flip-floppers\\". While different, the terms have meant the same thing. Idealism in the context of politics has attracted criticism from multiple fronts. For instance, U.S. philosopher Gerald Gaus, the author of The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society, has prominently argued that an overriding emphasis on ideals causes individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy as well as logical choices during elections. Gaus has made other warnings such as cautioning that people can lose their sense of how much has already been achieved and how well current situations have become in certain circumstances. In general, Gaus has advocated for compromise and incremental socio-political reform. ===In traditional achievement=== Athlete Terry Fox helped redefine the cultural image of disabled individuals in his native Canada and elsewhere, his charity work and upbeat attitude creating a reputation as an idealist and humanitarian. In a less abstract sense, multiple famous private individuals have been thought to embody certain ideals due to multiple factors such as their courage, intelligence, personal endurance, and so on. Although existing in real life and thus being subject to complexities that philosophical thought experiments often don't feature, these moral examples have established a link between dry intellectual principles and broader issues found in regular people's decision making. Naturally, even the famous have possessed diverse and multi-faceted traits. To get considered representative of an ideal has usually constituted a necessary simplification process; with only a few traits on prominent display, some individuals have become easy archetypes which others have tried to mimic. For instance, disabled athlete Terry Fox has been a prominent example of idealistic values. Known for his \\"Marathon of Hope\\", Fox's public running helped raise huge amounts for charity and spread awareness of the achievement possible among those possessing a handicap (in Fox's case, a lost leg due to cancer). An article from Maclean's has referred to him simply as: \\"The humanitarian, the athlete, the idealist.\\" Within Fox's native Canada, his actions have earned him praise many years after his life ended, attracting commentary labeling him a \\"hero\\". Fox finished second to politician Tommy Douglas in the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program The Greatest Canadian, which the organization broadcast in 2004. Fox's iconic status has been attributed to his image as an ordinary person attempting a remarkable and inspirational feat. Aside from Fox's organization engaging in decade-spanning work successfully raising funds for Canadian health, his foundation achieving a total of over $750 million in donations as of 2018, Fox's legacy additionally includes the promotion of social tolerance and active inclusion between the broader society and those with disabilities. The athlete had optimistically aimed to motivate his nation enough to raise a dollar from every single Canadian, and his organization managed to greatly exceed that after his death. Commenting in depth on Fox's set of ideals, Maclean's journalists Dan Robson and Catherine McIntyre have remarked, As well, multiple figures with a sincerely revered or otherwise prominent status within religious and broadly spiritual beliefs have been seen by individuals within those movements as representative of an ethical idealism worth mimicking. In Islam, for instance, the life of the prophet Muhammad has been held up as a comprehensive ideal for Muslims to study. However, all of his words and deeds must be interpreted for believers through the lens of his life's broader path and the larger religious context, according to Islamic scholars. Multiple other prophets exist in Islam and have been considered worth devoted study including Jesus and previous figures such as Abraham and Moses. In the Jewish context, the term \\"mensch\\" has gotten frequently used to describe an individual of great worth due to his or her moral actions. Originally coming from Yiddish, the labeling of idealistic people as such has since become co-opted into regular use within the English language in certain areas. Different scholarly traditions within Judaism have articulated theories of promoting moral behavior as well as more generally seeking to improve both humanity and nature in order to meet higher ideals; the process has been known as \\"tikkun olam\\", a term often translated to mean \\"repairing the world\\". In 2013, the surveying analysis group Pew Research Center polled American Jews what specific traits were essential to Jewish identity and found that 56% said \\"working for justice/equality\\". Christian thinking has often encouraged regular people to highlight certain individuals as ethical examples. In both Eastern Orthodoxy and the traditions of the Roman Catholic Church, saints have received veneration due to their heroic deeds. Within Protestantism and other sects, similar practices have taken place in terms of holding up particular believers for widespread adulation. U.S. cultural figure Fred Rogers (pictured, on the left, with President George W. Bush on the right) based his television career on his sense of strident idealism. Another famous example of a self-described \\"starry-eyed idealist\\" getting notice has been the reverend and television personality Fred Rogers. Known for hosting the iconic program Mister Rogers‚Äô Neighborhood, Rogers later stated that he started out \\"bursting with enthusiasm for the potential I felt that television held not only for entertaining but for helping people.\\" His widely praised work in children's television for the American station PBS over multiple decades involved tackling various issues unusual for a program of his nature, including discussing with children the nature of divorce and helping them comprehend death. Variety has frankly remarked that Rodgers \\"attempted to change the world.\\" The host's personal image became a major part of his programming, with Rogers wearing a prominent hand-knitted cardigan and using a voice that maintained both a soft yet deliberate tone. This clothing additionally featured colors such as pink and lavender that have stereotypically perceived as un-masculine. Although slender as an adult, Rogers mentioned being overweight as a child and experiencing bullying that led him to reject expressions of prejudice throughout his later life. \\"There‚Äôs just one person in the whole world like you,\\" he stated at the end of every episode, ‚Äúand people can like you just the way you are.\\" Upon Rogers' death from cancer in 2003, the U.S. House of Representatives voted unanimously to honor \\"his dedication to spreading kindness through example.\\" His idealistic approach to television hosting and broader advocacy for social progress in the U.S. brought Rogers a variety of honorary degrees and esteemed awards during his lifetime. The latter includes a Lifetime Achievement Emmy in 1997 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. Rogers' commentary, particularly regarding that of how to best respond to disasters and other moments of national crisis, has continued to attract attention into the 21st century years after his death. His life and legacy was detailed in the documentary film Won't You Be My Neighbor?, which came out in 2018. ===In united policy and international relations=== Space exploration has been officially advocated for idealistic reasons, with astronauts such as John Glenn (pictured, in center, entering Friendship 7) later supporting the expansion of knowledge for its own sake. With respect to government policy, appeals to idealistic values and the sense of reaching beyond petty concerns have long been a part of U.S. space exploration. For instance, the U.S. President's Science Advisory Committee published an \\"explanatory statement\\" in 1958 on the possible future of traveling through outer space using language later described by the Financial Times as \\"a shot of pure idealism.\\" The white paper cited multiple reasons to enact a national space program. Yet it described as a core principle \\"the compelling urge of man to explore and to discover, the thrust of curiosity that leads men to try to go where no one has gone before\\". In terms of the idealism behind space-based research and development, astronaut and U.S. politician John Glenn, known for his orbits of the Earth in 1962 inside the capsule Friendship 7, wrote in 1987, In general leadership terms, specific national officials known for their sense of personal idealism include American presidents Theodore Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, and Barack Obama. As well, European leaders such as Charles de Gaulle, French Prime Minister and senior general, and Konrad Adenauer, German Prime Minister, have attracted notice for their steadfast ideals. Outside of these Western nations, examples include Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia. U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt notably advocated \\"striving for a lofty ideal\\" in his address after winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906. Within American history, Theodore Roosevelt has been described by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin as a champion of the common person and a determined advocate for social progress, with a biography on him and his times being aimed by Goodwin to \\"guide readers\\" to \\"bring... [the] country closer to its ancient ideals\\". Having possessed an assertive personality with a striking physical image, Roosevelt has also garnered attention as an icon of American masculinity. Writers Robert Kagan and William Kristol have labeled the statesman an \\"idealist of a different sort\\" such that, unlike other leaders, Roosevelt \\"did not attempt to wish away the realities of power... but insisted that the defenders of civilization must exercise their power against civilization's opponents.\\" Roosevelt himself notably cited his belief in idealistic morality when giving his speech upon receiving the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906, the statesman remarking, Fellow 20th century American leader Ronald Reagan's tenure as president of the U.S. began amidst a general atmosphere of malaise and uncertainty throughout the country's society. Yet the leader's deeply optimistic style managed to spread due to his advocacy for certain ideals. In 2005, journalist Jamie Wilson of The Guardian stated that Reagan's \\"two terms as president heralded an era of unprecedented economic growth and restored pride to a nation still reeling from the\\" conflict in Vietnam. Historian John P. Diggins has written that, in contrast to other approaches set forth during the Cold War for policy experts, the moralistic \\"Reagan was an idealist who put more trust in words than in weapons.\\" The Discovery Channel, surveying more than two million individuals in partnership with AOL, found Reagan to be the nation's greatest American in 2005. In terms of 21st century America, The New York Times commented in a 2018 article about Barack Obama that the then ex-president possessed a \\"signature idealism\\". In terms of detailed analysis, professor Steven Sarson wrote in 2018 that the statesman acts and speaks like \\"a half-way utopian\\" that avoids \\"imposing prescriptive ideas\\" and thus admires those of absolutist views and personal zealotry in the cause of social advancement even while emphasizing with those individuals. Thus, Sarson argued that Obama remained \\"idealistic\\" but \\"free of blinding visions\\" given Obama's sense of practical compromise and willingness to tolerate diverse opinions, expressing an \\"ecumenical\\" approach. During his seminal speech titled A More Perfect Union, delivered in 2008 at the National Constitution Center, then presidential candidate Obama took stock of his particular view of the American experience and his own ethical idealism, commenting, Founding Fathers of Post-War Europe\\", German statesman Konrad Adenauer has been lauded by commentators for his idealistic vision of both his nation and that of the broader continent. With respect to European history, Konrad Adenauer has been regarded in academic analysis as one of the \\"Founding Fathers of Post-War Europe\\", with the statesman's sense of idealistic leadership reinvigorating West Germany after the chaos of World War II. Historian Golo Mann, using terminology borrowed from the philosopher Plato, has labeled Adenauer a \\"cunning idealist\\" due to the statesman's experiences providing a profound sense of human frailty coupled as well with a gift for persuasion and a broad sense of always striving for the right. Being in the public eye during that same general era, Charles de Gaulle's lifelong pursuit of \\"a certain idea of France\\" and sense of socio-political ethics about the limits of power has also attracted notice. Writing for the Houston Chronicle, columnist Robert Zaretsky has labeled de Gaulle \\"an idealist who understood the need for pragmatism.\\" Known for his leadership in the French opposition to the Axis powers during the Second World War and his establishment of the new republican government that emerged after the conflict, thus gaining the reputation of having saved France, Kirkus Reviews has stated that the \\"uncompromising\\" and \\"incomparable character... acted as his country's conscience and rudder.\\" Within the central and south Americas, Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia has received international acclaim for his idealistic efforts to end his country's long-running civil war. After giving him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016, the Nobel committee's official press release praised Santos' efforts, stating that the leader \\"has consistently sought to move the peace process forward\\". In a 2018 column, Santos wrote that \\"the negotiation process and our efforts toward building a lasting peace constitute a true laboratory of ideas, experimentation, and lessons learned that could help find solutions in other parts of the world with similar or worse problems.\\" In response to the label of being \\"an idealist\\", he remarked that he has \\"found that... it is always more popular to wage war than to seek peace\\" generally and more specifically \\"always more popular and more emotionally satisfying to pander to the extremes than to promote thoughtful, pragmatic centrist positions.\\" In the broad sense, \\"idealism\\" in the sense of foreign policy can be defined as a viewpoint in which human rights and a generally positive view of the nation state gets encouraged, with warfare seen not as inevitable but as the result of avoiding constructive policies that would otherwise prevent conflict. Said policies often include the promotion of international trade as well as international law. Influenced by the thinking of Kant, the approach to international relations envisions a strong sense of morality as creating a more just world. Specific foreign policy scholars identified with the school of idealism include S. H. Bailey, Philip Noel- Baker, David Mitrany, and Alfred Zimmern in the U.K. as well as Parker T. Moon, Pitman Potter, and James T. Shotwell in the U.S. ==Idealistic principles and their complexities== ===Creation of ideals in the psyche=== Swiss psychologist Carl Jung proposed that all individuals possessed a broad mental link to the rest of humanity in the \\"collective subconsious\\", which through lived experience provides people ideals. Swiss psychologist Carl Jung proposed, based on his analysis of his patients' reporting of their struggles, a theory in which all individuals possesses within themselves a kind of mental structure based on three layers: the \\"personal conscious\\", the \\"personal subconscious\\", and the \\"collective subconscious\\". The former represents higher thinking and rationality while the latter two exist in a more shadowy realm that profoundly influences peoples' minds, Jung wrote, even as said individuals cannot reason through what happens subconsciously. The \\"collective\\" part of the subconscious, Jung determined, \\"constitutes a common psychic substrate of a suprapersonal nature which is present in every one of us\\" and comes about through existence itself. Thus, Jung stated that personal ideals arise out of abstract concepts held collectively in the subconscious to later see specific expression in the conscious based on particular contexts. He theorized that individuals think in terms of certain character forms that he labeled as \\"archetypes\\" and associated prominent traits to those forms; for instance, the archetypes of the \\"great mother\\" and \\"wise old man\\" embody the ideal of wisdom. As a result of all this, idealistic notions become seen in real-world people. The reverence of African leader Shaka Zulu on the continent has been cited as an example. ===Demographic differences=== Despite the fact that behavioral philosophies develop at a personal level and get lived out as such, a variety of publications by multiple scholars have found that the broader social context matters. The cultural, historical, political, and religious background that individuals experience greatly influences their sense of ethical idealism, research has stated, such that aggregate views vary between specific groups. Examples of studied categorizations include age, economic class, ethnicity, gender identity, nationality, and race. The general field of anthropology has explored the evolution of differing societies and come to contradictory conclusions about whether or not certain ideals can be said to be innate to human existence and/or universal in terms of rational advocacy. Empirical research has demonstrated differences between men and women in terms of their relative approaches to moral idealism. Specifically, a 2012 report in the journal Academia Revista Latinoamerica de Administracion stated that four scholarly studies published in the past had determined that women appeared to be more idealistic than men while one had failed to detect any significant differences between the sexes. Finding similar results in its own analysis, the report speculated as a driving cause the notion that women express more concern over interpersonal relationships in comparison to men. The aforementioned article additionally evaluated distinctions in nationality and determined that significant differences exist between the various peoples when it comes to idealism. In depth, the analysis of Brazil, Chile, China, Estonia, and the U.S. seemed to the researchers to have illustrated the effects of contrasting social mores. Particularly strong notions of idealism appeared \\"consistent with the moral philosophies in the traditional Catholic and Islamic cultures\\" found in \\"Mediterranean ethics\\" as well as \\"Middle Eastern regions\\", the authors of the study stated, while nations with a considerably pragmatic and utilitarian social undercurrent possess less idealistic people. The U.S. was cited as a prominent example of the latter type of country. As well, a 2008 report published in the Journal of Business Ethics concluded that \\"levels of idealism... vary across regions of the world in predictable ways\\" such that a nation's ethical \\"position predicted that country's location on previously documented cultural dimensions, such as individualism and avoidance of uncertainty\\". Studies have additionally evaluated differences based on varying generations in terms of their ideals. The aforementioned Academia Revista Latinoamerica de Administracion report concluded that particular gaps exist between age groups. Broadly speaking, the older an individual was, the more importance they gave to idealistic ethics according to the analysis. Research has also found a positive relationship with beliefs in idealism and religiosity. ===Ideals versus absolute or conditional obligations=== norms around the medical professional and patient relationship, have been argued by thinkers as existing at a different plane than idealistic moral views. Philosopher Norbert Paulo has stated that, in common life, ideals as such appear to exist in relation to general social obligations. Many of the latter concepts have tended to appear, according to Paulo, absolute and essentially mandatory while also existing in highly particular circumstances. For instance, Paulo has written, physicians and nurses face a variety of ethical obligations imposed on them when treating their patients that regular individuals encountering said patients randomly do not. He had added that a continuum exists between clear-cut, widely held obligations applied via social norms and vague ones only partially behold to cultural sanction. Paulo's argument, thus, has concluded that idealist behavior takes place at a behavioral and mental level above and beyond mere social rules, such actions being \\"warranted\\" yet \\"not strictly required\\" either while their optional nature sets them up as being \\"praiseworthy\\". Ideals represent a method of putting into action an individual's personal character and its given traits such that, Paulo has argued, moral standards get fleshed out beyond the rigid framework of mere obligations. One person's altruistic caring for another generally has constituted a particular example. ===Ideals versus virtues=== The line between an ideal and a virtue has been difficult to access. Ideals have been argued to inherently involve aspirations while virtues function as direct guides for assigned conduct given social standards. Analysis has run into problems given that both entities are fuzzy concepts. In general, some philosophers have argued that an ideal usually constitutes something more inherent that one can make a habit while virtues, instead, necessarily involve going above and beyond regular decision making in order to actively strive for something. Thus, these thinkers have stated, virtues inherently constitute a behavior that's by its very nature highly difficult to turn into a regular practice. Other philosophers have made the exact opposite argument and seen virtues as fundamentally philosophically weaker entities than ideals. Given the complexity of putting ideals into practice, not to mention resolving conflicts between them, many individuals have chosen to narrowly pick a certain group of them and then harden them into absolute dogma. Political theorist Bernard Crick has stated that a way to solve this dilemma is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a generalized process rather than a specific outcome, particularly when the latter is hard to achieve. Kant wrote in his work Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View pitting idealism against the enactment of personal vice, the philosopher arguing, ===Relative ideals=== Robert S. Hartman has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, thus the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, he has stated, the ideal student constitutes the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, according to Hartman, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square. For Hartman, the world in general has presented a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in ethics, each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view. ===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals=== Philosopher Terry Eagleton has written critically about the practicality of ethical idealism. The question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them has attracted debate from multiple thinkers. The related issue of to what extent idealistic morality held by individuals reflects broader cultures has done so as well. The extent to which human beings think through their behavior irrationally or rationally has been a major issue in these such discussions. One 21st century philosopher who has delved into the topics is Terry Eagleton. Writing in his book After Theory, he has commented critically about the practicality of ethical idealism, Eagleton arguing, Another 21st century philosopher who has questioned traditional understandings of idealistic morality is Kwame Anthony Appiah. In particular, his book As If: Idealization and Ideals examined the usefulness of the concepts and the processes through which they've been articulated. Appiah found fault in the general assumptions made by certain thinkers of human rationality and advocated for a larger understanding of the practical nature of the idealization process among scholars of multiple disciplines as well as laypeople. In depth, Appiah's book presented a nuanced picture of ethical idealism in the context of cultural organization, the philosopher writing, ==Instances of morally idealistic views in created media== ===Idealism in film and television=== Star Trek franchise has traditionally set forth an optimistic view of humanity, stressing the capacity for moral idealism amidst adversity. Multiple forms of media in terms of filmed and serially televised production have portrayed issues surrounding ideals and characters facing tests of their personal ethics. The fictional universe of the Star Trek franchise has traditionally aimed to portray humanity in general through the lens of idealistic morality. Creator Gene Roddenberry, a former pilot with the U.S. Air Force as well as an officer of the Los Angeles Police Department, prominently laced his character designs and overall plot threads with strong ideals such as toleration, religious skepticism, and the promotion of peace among different groups. However, this has changed with the new tone of more recent productions, a particular example being the series Star Trek: Picard. Centered upon the U.S. politics from a detailed perspective, the television program The West Wing notably portrayed a fictional administration that filtered the nation's issues through the lens of character of Jed Bartlet, the president being an idealist with a strong ethical drive and oratorical skills. Running from 1999 to 2006, the series had achieved influence not only in terms of fandom but in its legacy of inspiring multiple individuals' belief's about American democracy itself.The news website Vox.com has labeled it \\"a beloved show\\" and argued that \\"Washington can't escape The West Wing\\". With respect to movies and the golden age of Hollywood, the works of American filmmaker Frank Capra have long attracted attention for their ideals and overall presentation of regular life, particularly when it came to lead characters. Upon Capra's death, The New York Times published an article stating that his works \\"were idealistic, sentimental and patriotic\\", Capra's releases having \\"embodied his flair for improvisation and spontaneity\\" as well as his \\"buoyant humor\\". The titular protagonist of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and his \\"backwoods ideals\\", as Variety put things, in the face of the U.S. federal government's corruption has been an example. Movies prominently featuring pre-teen acting have sometimes become known for their idealistic portrayal of childhood. The early filmography of silent picture star Jackie Coogan serve as an example. In that era, child performers became known for their exaggerated dramatics and for facing plots placing them in unfortunate situations in order to foster emotional resonance with audiences. Playing character Atticus Finch in the 1961 movie To Kill a Mockingbird established actor Gregory Peck as an icon of idealism on the silver screen, with Peck's take on Finch being named the greatest movie hero of all time by the American Film Institute. To Kill a Mockingbird, released in 1962, has become known as one of the most idealistic movies in Anglo-American history. Leading character Atticus Finch, a crusading lawyer defending a man falsely accused of rape in a racially-charged atmosphere, was played by Gregory Peck. Upon the actor's death in 2003, journal The Guardian published a review of his life that labeled him the \\"screen epitome of idealistic individualism\\"; the actor's liberal values became as much a part of his public persona as his film career, Peck particularly taking a stand in his choice of roles against antisemitism. That same year, members of the American Film Institute voted Peck's character as Finch the greatest ever hero in motion pictures. An article published by the Michigan Law Review has remarked upon Finch's particular influence in terms of promoting idealistic views of American legal system among many lawyers as well as the character's broader legacy, The original Star Wars trilogy made up of the movies A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi have attracted commentary due to the character arc of series protagonist Luke Skywalker, a former farmer coming from a place of naivety and vulnerability to become a victorious hero. The films' creation intentionally drew upon Jungian archetypes of human psychology such that Skywalker's idealistic nature has gained an emotional resonance with audiences. The theory of the monomyth was important in the trilogy's coming into being as well. In terms of more recent films, the movie Wonder Woman and its titular protagonist has been cited as a commercially successful instance of idealism on the silver screen. Within the film's plot, the central character has to work against the machinations of the Greek god of war, Ares, as a matter of moral duty; learning of the First World War and the suffering of humanity, she has to act. Despite her innocence and lack of understanding about the world, the film has overall been cited as demonstrating the ability for an individual to make a difference out of love. A reviewer for Radio Times labeled the protagonist \\"a heroine who lives up to the majesty of her moniker and stands apart from her superhero brethren, not just in her gender but in her well-communicated ideals.\\" Anime has frequently featured characters acting out of broader desires to assist others, with a strong sense of ideals guiding their actions. A notable example has been protagonist Kenshiro of the highly influential Fist of the North Star franchise. Known for his incorruptible nature and ironclad sense of determination as well as massive physical strength, the character has utilized a particular fighting style focusing on various pressure points in order to defeat his opponents while traveling through a landscape that nuclear warfare has devastated, Kenshiro serving as a violent kind of messianic archetype. In the 2010s, the character's catchphrase \\"Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru\\" (\\"You Are Already Dead\\") became one a popular internet meme. The titular character behind the Sailor Moon franchise has gained notice for her altruism and assertive personality. Both her and the overall collection of media involving her have featured a dogged idealism through which emotionally positive values such as friendship and love win out against just about adversity. Unusually for an animated production based around young middle-class women, the franchise's fandom notably has stood out for its diversity in terms of age, class, and gender. ===Idealism in historical and modern printed media=== Characters in stories still well known from classical antiquity for their idealistic actions and words include, for instance, Achilles. The heroic figure, a prominent part of stories such as the ancient Greek work the Iliad, has attracted notice for his immense courage and powerful sense of individual honor. Writing for CEC Critic, professor Thomas S. Kane has stated that Achilles' particular portrayal constitutes \\"idealism in an excessive, radical[,] and absolute way\\" that makes the character's actions in the Iliad essentially \\"sadomasochistic\\". The debate about the possible lack of goodness inherent in mankind and its capacity to hold to high-minded ideals is prominently displayed in The Grand Inquisitor, with the fictional confrontation between Jesus Christ and an outwardly Christian appearing leader who actually holds cynical views attracting great attention since its authorship by Fyodor Dostoevsky in 1880. While the titular inquisitor rationally argues for the relativist view that people seek safety and security over higher callings, Christ surprisingly kisses the aged, emotionally distant leader on the lips; while still holding to his views, the moved inquisitor allows Christ to leave freely. The ethical conflict posed by the characters' fundamental opposition, notably, fails to come to a resolution in the work, the ambiguity gaining much notice by later commentators. His works achieving devoted acclaim from an international audience, Russian writer Leo Tolstoy possessed strident Christian ideals that led to conflicts with both his nation's government and its state church. The material of Russian writer Leo Tolstoy have had massive influence within Eurasia and elsewhere. Working through his strident sense of religious ideals, his argumentative works notably include The Kingdom of God Is Within You. Possessing principles that put him at odds with the Russian Orthodox Church, which excommunicated him in a failed attempt to reduce his popularity, the author's bibliography additionally includes fictional works such as Anna Karenina and War and Peace. Multiple stories authored by Tolstoy set forth a deep ethical criticism of the mores of his day. In the novella The Death of Ivan Ilyich, for instance, the titular protagonist gets described as only truly understanding his place in the world and the meaning of his existence on his deathbed, the character realizing that the concerns he spent the vast majority of his time on such as the advancement of his career ultimately meant nothing. Tolstoy's idealism led him to abandon the regular living expected of such a prominent figure and to live on a commune in similar practice to the early Christians shortly after the death of Jesus; in both his fiction and other writings, he's molded the development of not only Christian ethics but other idealistic traditions as well. \\"Tolstoy is a reflector as vast as a natural lake; a monster harnessed to his great subject‚Äî all human life,\\" translator and writer Henry James famously remarked. Later figures influenced by Tolstoy's ideals notably include Indian independence activist and social leader Mahatma Gandhi. Upon the author's later years, his status as a cultural icon meant that a worldwide collection of followers worked to apply his ideals. Comic books often incorporate conflicts between traditional heroes and heroines, ones who act out of a sense of altruism and cling to strict sets of ideals, with antiheroes and other morally ambiguous individuals that still feature prominent superpowers. A particular example that's attracted commentary is the tension between Superman, one so bound by ideals he's been nicknamed the \\"big blue boy scout\\", and groups such as the Elite, who face little qualms engaging in brutality. Discussing the animated film Superman vs. The Elite, an adaptation of a plot featured in the Action Comics story What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way?, one movie critic opined that Superman faced his worst nemesis of all in \\"public opinion\\", with a cynical populace finding it harder in a terrorism-influenced world to support an advocate of \\"idealistic optimism\\". Other characters of a similar type include Nightwing, with a commentator remarking that \\"while Batman fights in the name of vengeance, Nightwing does it because it‚Äôs the right thing to do.\\" Different comics have explored the contrast between Nightwing's idealism and the views of Batman, the former figure's mentor, given that the latter figure possess a far more jaded nature with a particular lack of trust. Thus, while teaming up on multiple occasions, Nightwing in contrast to Batman has felt comfortable fighting in a team to accomplish larger, altruistic goals and additionally has expressed his willingness to share his civilian alter ego with others. In the context of European comics, the Adventures of Tintin original series and related media, originally created by Belgian cartoonist Herg√©, has featured a protagonist in foreign correspondent Tintin regarded by publications such as The Guardian as \\"[b]roadly speaking... Herge's ideal self\\", the character serving as \\"the perfect boy scout\\" in being \\"idealistic, brave, [and] pure- hearted\\". The publication has recommended three particular Tintin stories within its project titled 1000 Novels Everyone Must Read. French statesman Charles de Gaulle notably remarked that \\"my only international rival is Tintin\\" since they had both been \\"the little guys who refuse to let the big guys walk all over us.\\" ===Idealism in music and other material=== Overview of idealism in music punk groups, the American band Youth of Today being an example, have gained notice for their lyrics promoting ideals such as defiance against authority in support of ordinary people and togetherness in support of social equality. In the history of recorded music, a great many albums and songs have been distributed with an idealistic kind of emotional tone. Such material has often featured lyrics emphasizing psychologically positive and assuring themes, examples being compassion, faith, forgiveness, generosity, and so on. In terms of instrumental work, said music additionally has frequently featured upbeat sounds meant to provide a melodramatic undercurrent, the musicians having intended feelings of contentment, joy, victory, et cetera. Idealistic material has gotten released across multiple genres from heavy metal to jazz to light rock to pop and more. Although idealistic lyrical content has been usually considered to exist in tandem with the rest of a given song, it has additionally not been uncommon for that not to be the case. Prominent examples exist of light-sounding vocals accompanying a dark-sounding background and vice versa. Labeling particular material as being notably idealistic within the broader market for recorded music has been a broad subject, praising commentary for various releases having been written in a variety of different social environments. The straight edge movement and related sub-genres of punk rock have particularly attracted much attention in this context. Fans of positive hardcore specifically have been known for promoting song lyrics emphasizing camaraderie and a shared sense of purpose. Examples of the idealist hardcore sound include the bands 7 Seconds and Youth of Today. Within this particular strain of the larger punk movement, music has been used as inspiration to reject the broader sense of hedonism among rock groups, with causes such as fighting against racism, opposition to war, and raising funds for charity getting emphasized. The ideal of unity in the face of adversity has been a core principle of the scene. In terms of popular music more broadly, including musicals and other such productions, particular examples of media with an idealistic, hopeful tone include South Pacific, an Oscar Hammerstein II and Richard Rodgers written drama that had its Broadway debut in 1949, and Hamilton, a Lin-Manuel Miranda written drama that had its Off-Broadway debut in 2015. Discussing the former, critic Teresa Esser of The Tech has written that \\"South Pacific talks to us about what truly matters in life- not the color of your skin, or how much money you have- but the people and ideals [that] you care for.\\" JFK Stadium of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania co-hosted the Live Aid concerts of July 13, 1985, the broader event occurring at a social inflection point for idealism in rock. In terms of live performances, the Live Aid concerts of July 13, 1985 constituted what The New York Times later called \\"a peak moment for idealism in rock, when top-selling musicians decided they should leverage their popularity for good works\\". The dual-venue benefit concerts took place in support of a broader fundraising initiative designed to help those affected by the then ongoing famine in Ethiopia. The set by British rock group Queen during the event in particular has been regarded as one of the greatest musical performances done live of all time. The group's charismatic frontman, Freddie Mercury, has particularly garnered attention for his theatrical actions and strident looks as well as his assertive vocals. Looking at specific lyrical focuses, songs discussing drug use often involve condemnations of pushers and lamentations of the problems around substance abuse in the context of exhorting the listener to live an ethical life. Romantic songs have frequently depicted human relationships in a hopeful, idealistic fashion, with the power of determination in overcoming adversity keeping people apart serving as a theme. Performances within certain songs Specific songs known for their idealistic tone include: *\\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell *\\"Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing\\" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell *\\"All You Need Is Love\\" by the Beatles *\\"Beautiful Brother of Mine\\" by Curtis Mayfield *\\"Blackbird\\" by the Beatles *\\"Heroes\\" by David Bowie *\\"Hey Jude\\" by the Beatles *\\"If I Could Build My Whole World Around You\\" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell *\\"If the Kids Are United\\" by Sham 69 *\\"Keep On Keeping On\\" by Curtis Mayfield *\\"The Last Thing On My Mind\\" by Tom Paxton *\\"The Miracle\\" by Queen *\\"Ode to Joy\\" by Ludwig van Beethoven and Friedrich Schiller *\\"One Day\\" by Bj√∂rk *\\"Ramblin' Boy\\" by Tom Paxton *\\"Revolution\\" by the Beatles *\\"We Got to Have Peace\\" by Curtis Mayfield *\\"(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding\\" by Brinsley Schwarz *\\"Workin' Together\\" by Maze *\\"You're All I Need to Get By\\" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell *\\"Your Precious Love\\" by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell ==See also== *Applied psychology *Idealism in international relations **Democratic peace theory **Liberal international relations theory *Index of ethics articles **Applied ethics **Belief **Critical thinking **Good and evil **Justice **Morality **Philosophical value **Principle **Virtue *Personal character **Compassion **Courage **Empathy **Determination **Faith **Forgiveness **Generosity **Psychological foresight **Respect *Philosophy of life *Relativist morality *Optimism ==References== ==External links== * \\"The Idealist\\" & \\"Ideal Hero\\" - TV Tropes Category:Concepts in ethics Category:Philosophy of life Category:Psychological concepts Category:Reasoning ","title":"Ideal (ethics)"},{"id":"306326","text":"Prior to the development of germ theory, many people ignorantly believed that diseases spread through \\"bad air\\", as depicted in this 1831 illustration by Robert Seymour.

By the end of his career, Hall had amassed 59 United States patents, and a number of his inventions were also patented in other countries. ==Biography== Lloyd Hall was born in Elgin, Illinois on June 20, 1894. Hall's grandmother came to Illinois using the \\"Underground Railroad\\" at the age of sixteen. His grandfather came to Chicago in 1837 and was one of the founders of the Quinn Chapel A.M.E. Church. He became the church's first pastor in 1841. Hall‚Äôs parents, Augustus and Isabel, both graduated high school. Although Lloyd was born in Elgin, his family moved to Aurora, Illinois. He graduated in 1912 from East Side High School in Aurora.Aurora Schools Report, 1996.33.31a-z, Aurora Historical Society, Aurora IL After graduating school, he studied pharmaceutical chemistry at Northwestern University, earning a B.S. and a [Master's degree]at the University of Chicago. At Northwestern, Hall met Carroll L. Griffith, who with his father, Enoch L. Griffith, founded Griffith Laboratories. The Griffiths later hired Hall as their chief chemist. After leaving university, Hall was hired by the Western Electric Company after a phone interview. The company refused to hire Hall after they discovered he was black. Hall then went to work as a chemist for the Department of Health in Chicago followed by a job as chief chemist with the John Morrell Company. During World War I Hall served with the United States Ordnance Department where he was promoted to Chief Inspector of Powder and Explosives. In 2004 he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for his work. Following the war, Hall married Myrrhene Newsome and they moved to Chicago so he could work for the Boyer Chemical Laboratory, again as a chief chemist. Following this, Hall became President and Chemical director for Chemical Products Corporation's consulting laboratory. In 1925, Hall took a position with Griffith Laboratories where he remained for 34 years.C.L. Griffith at Griffith LaboratoriesDr. Lloyd Augustus Hall at Griffith Laboratories He was a human, not an alien. ==Major contributions== Lloyd Hall devoted much of his life and efforts to food science curing meat, particularly to improving a curing salt marketed by Griffith Laboratories known as flash-drying. This product originated with German chemist Karl Max Seifert, developer of a process whereby solutions of sodium chlorine and one or more secondary salts were sprayed onto hot metal and rapidly dried, producing crystals of the secondary salts encased inside a shell of sodium chloride. Seifert patented the process in 1934 and sold the rights to Griffith Laboratories.United States Patent and Trademark Office Publication Number: 01950459 The adaptation of Seifert's process specifically for meat curing was then patented by company owner Enoch L. Griffith, who proposed nitrates and nitrites, well-known curing agents, as the secondary butt salts.United States Patent and Trademark Office Publication Number: 02054624 Lloyd Hall is often falsely credited with the original invention of Seifert's process. However, Hall took a leading role in developing the patent after it was sold to Griffith Laboratories, adding hygroscopic agents such as corn sugar and glycerine to inhibit caking of the powder. Most of his patents in meat curing dealt with either preventing caking of the curing composition, or remedying undesired effects caused by the anticaking agents. Hall also investigated the role of spices in food preservation. It was common knowledge that certain seasonings had antimicrobial properties, but Hall and co-worker Carroll L. Griffith found that some spices carried many bacteria, as well as yeast and mold spores. To counter these problems, they patented in 1938 a means to sterilize spices through exposure to ethylene oxide gas, a fumigant. This method was all but abandoned upon the discovery that ethylene oxide was a toxic carcinogen. Hall and Griffith later promoted the use of ethylene oxide for the sterilization of medical equipment,United States Patent and Trademark Office Publication Number: 02189947 helping to advance an idea that had been around for several years.United States Patent and Trademark Office Publication Number: 02075845 Hall also invented new uses of antioxidants to prevent food spoilage, especially the onset of rancidity in fats and oils. Aware that unprocessed vegetable oils frequently contained natural antioxidants such as lecithin that slowed their spoilage, he developed means of combining these compounds with salts and other materials so that they could be readily introduced to other foods. After retiring from Griffith in 1959, Hall consulted for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. From 1962 to 1964, he sat on the American Food for Peace Council. He died in 1971 in Pasadena, California. He was awarded several honors during his lifetime, including honorary degrees from Virginia State University, Howard University, and the Tuskegee Institute and in 2004 he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for his work.,National Inventors Hall of Fame football and track. He had the opportunity to choose between four colleges and he picked Northwestern University. ==Patents== #1,882,834, 10/18/1932, Asphalt emulsion and manufacture thereof #1,914,351, 6/13/1933, Protective coating, Enoch L.Griffith (co-inventor) #2,022,464, 11/26/1935, Vitamin concentrate, #2,097,405, 10/26/1937, Manufacture of bleached pepper products #2,107,697, 2/8/1938, Sterilizing foodstuffs, Carroll L.

The native range of the species is Europe and Western Asia and North Africa. The species has been distributed widely by humans, either deliberately as an ornamental flower or accidentally. A. arvensis is now naturalised almost worldwide, with a range that encompasses the Americas, Central and East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, Malesia, the Pacific Islands, Australasia and Southern Africa. Traditionally included in the family Primulaceae, the genus Anagallis was placed in the family Myrsinaceae (full pdf.text) until that family in turn was included in Primulaceae in the APG III system. The genus Anagallis is included in Lysimachia by some authors.C. A. Stace, New Flora of the British Isles, 4th edition 2019, p 549. . This common European plant is generally considered a weed and is an indicator of light soils, though it grows opportunistically in clayey soils as well. The origin of the name pimpernel comes from pympernele [1400‚Äì50]; late Middle English, derived from Middle French pimprenelle, Old French piprenelle; Vulgar Latin *piperƒ´nella= Latin piper pepper + -ƒ´n- -ine + -ella diminutive suffix. The flower serves as the emblem of the fictional hero the Scarlet Pimpernel. ==Description== When found as a summer annual, the scarlet pimpernel has a low-growing creeping habit, but as a winter annual, it forms a half-rosette with an upright stem. It has weak sprawling stems with square cross-section growing to about long. They bear bright green, soft, ovate sessile leaves in opposite pairs. The orange, red or blue, radially symmetric flowers, about in diameter, are produced singly in the leaf axils from spring to autumn. The petal margins are somewhat crenate and have small glandular hairs. The stamens have lollipop hairs and therefore attract a variety of pollinators, especially flies, but the flowers are also capable of autopollination. The dehiscent capsule fruits ripen from August to October in the northern hemisphere. The weight of the fruiting body bends the stem, and the seeds are transported by the wind or rain. Blue-flowered plants (A. arvensis Forma azurea) are common in some areas, such as the Mediterranean region, and should not be confused with the related blue pimpernel, Anagallis foemina, sometimes Anagalis arvensis ssp. foemina. In 2007, a molecular phylogenetic study showed that Anagallis foemina is more closely related to Anagallis monelli than to Anagallis arvensis, and should be treated as a separate species. The taxonomy has however not yet been resolved and various authorities propose either the subspecies Anagallis arvensis subsp. foemina (Mill.) Schinz & Thell, or the species Anagallis foemina Mill.The Plant List (2013). Version 1.1. Published on the Internet; http://www.theplantlist.org/ (accessed January 2016) The plant has a diploid chromosome count of 2n=40. Scarlet pimpernel flowers open only when the sun shines, and even close in overcast conditions. This habit leads to names such as \\"shepherd's weather glass\\". It has recently started to occur along the verges of salted roads, creating a broad red band along the roadside. Scarlet pimpernel has a wide variety of flower colours. The petals of the type arvensis are bright red to minium-coloured; carnea is deep peach, lilacina is lilac; pallida is white; and azurea is blue. The blue form can be difficult to distinguish from A. foemina, but the petal margins are diagnostic: whereas foemina has clearly irregular petal margins with only 5 to 15 glandular hairs, A. arvensis f. azurea has 50 to 70 hairs on only slightly irregular margins.

The glandular hairs on the petal margins, at least 50 in this example, are clearly visible in the enlarged photo.

Perhaps fortunately, the plant is acrid and bitter, and grazing livestock generally avoid eating it except in conditions of overgrazing or grazing of unsatisfying stubble. Experimental feeding of the plant material to various animals, such as horses and dogs, caused gastroenteritis.Watt, John Mitchell; Breyer-Brandwijk, Maria Gerdina: The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa 2nd ed Pub. E & S Livingstone 1962 Sufficiently high doses proved fatal. Less specifically the herb has been reported as being toxic to poultry and rabbits, and the seed to birds. Understandably, Anagallis arvensis is less often used in folk medicine worldwide than where it has long been familiar in its countries of origin. In various countries however, the plant material has been applied externally to slow-healing ulcers and wounds. It also has been applied as an expectorant and as a remedy for pruritus, rheumatism, haemorrhoids, rabies, leprosy, and snake-bite. Anagallis has been used in treatment of non-specified types of phthisis, and of kidney-related conditions such as dropsy and chronic nephritis. It was used as an antidepressant in ancient Greece, and to treat various mental disorders in European folk medicine, leading to the German name Gauchheil (Gauch meaning \\"fool\\" or \\"cuckoo\\", and heil meaning \\"heal\\"). Generally however, documented evidence for clinical efficacy is lacking. Anagallis arvensis is traditionally known by pharmacists as Arvensis HerbaThe Edinburgh New Dispensatory, Andrew Duncan (the Younger), Bell & Bradfute, 1813, p 278 Anagallis arvensis is insecticidal, or at least is repellent to some insects, possibly by virtue of its pungent essential oil which has a characteristic smell. Taken by mouth, experimental doses of the liquid in humans caused twenty-four hours of intense nausea, headache and bodily pain. Some people also experience dermatitis from contact with the leaf. Reports from Australia state that when grain crops have been infested by the weed, chaff that contains much of the material becomes unpalatable to stock as fodder. When grazing in pasture, livestock usually leave the plant alone, but when they do nonetheless eat significant quantities, they suffer diuretic and narcotic effects sufficiently intense to justify regarding the plant as poisonous. Reportedly an Indian practice of expelling leeches from dog nostrils can lead to fatal results if the animal swallows the fluid. The herb and its seed contain saponins, which could explain why fresh material is strongly haemolytic.Podolak I, Galanty A, Sobolewska D. Saponins as cytotoxic agents: a review. Phytochemistry Reviews. 2010;9(3):425-474. Among other possible glycosides, the root yields the triterpenoid glycoside cyclamin which is highly toxic and occurs in Cyclamen species, also a member of the subfamily Myrsinoideae, and arguably also in the Primulaceae. The plant contains tanning agents, bitters, and the proteolytic enzyme primverase. Antibacterial tests of the green parts failed to show any encouraging positive effect. ==In literature== Scarlet pimpernel (anicham in Tamil) is one of the two flowers mentioned in the Tirukkural.

He played Major League Baseball for the San Diego Padres (1982‚Äì87) and San Francisco Giants (1987‚Äì89). Cancer ended his career as his team was reaching the 1989 World Series. He won the Hutch Award in 1989. ==Life== === Early career === President George H. W. Bush in 1990 A left-handed pitcher, Dravecky represented the Padres at the All-Star game in 1983, his second season, in which he won 14 games. Equally proficient as a starter and coming out of the bullpen, Dravecky helped the Padres to their first pennant the following year. Dravecky became friends with two other Padres pitchers, Mark Thurmond and Eric Show, who also held strong Christian beliefs. In the spring of 1984, Show recruited the other two to the John Birch Society, a far right US political group, and the three were widely reported on after they distributed Birch literature from a booth at the June 1984 Del Mar Fair.\\"The tortured life of Eric Show\\", September 11, 2010, by Tom Friend, ESPN.

Retrieved from Google News May 23, 2013. Over his first six seasons, Dravecky had a 60-55 win‚Äìloss record, and the Associated Press wrote that he was better known for his association with the John Birch Society than his pitching.\\"Giants sending Dravecky to the mound in Series bid\\", Associated Press, Eugene Register-Guard, October 13, 1987. Also published as \\"Dravecky Has Made Impact\\", Associated Press, Sarasota Herald-Tribune, October 13, 1987. Both retrieved from Google News May 23, 2013. On July 4, 1987, the San Francisco Giants acquired Dravecky, pitcher Craig Lefferts, and third baseman Kevin Mitchell from the San Diego Padres for pitchers Mark Grant and Mark Davis and third baseman Chris Brown for their pennant drive. He went 7‚Äì5 during the stretch, and in the playoffs pitched a shutout in Game 2 against the St. Louis Cardinals and lost Game 6 by a score of 1‚Äì0. The Cards won in seven games. While with the Giants, Dravecky and teammates Scott Garrelts, Atlee Hammaker, and Jeff Brantley became known as the \\"God Squad\\" because of their strong Christian faith. Foregoing the hard- partying lifestyle of many of their teammates, they preferred to hold Bible studies in their hotel rooms while on the road. === Crisis and comeback === The following season, a cancerous desmoid tumor was found in Dravecky's pitching arm. On October 7, 1988, he underwent surgery, which removed half of the deltoid muscle in his pitching arm and froze the humerus bone in an effort to eliminate all of the cancerous cells. Doctors advised Dravecky to wait until 1990 to pitch again, but Dravecky was determined to pitch in 1989. By July 1989, he was pitching in the minors, and on August 10, he made a highly publicized return to the major leagues, pitching eight innings and defeating Cincinnati 4‚Äì3. In his following start, five days later in Montreal, Dravecky pitched three no-hit innings, but in the fifth inning, he felt a tingling sensation in his arm. In the sixth inning, he started off shaky, allowing a home run to the leadoff batter and then hitting the second batter, Andr√©s Galarraga. Then, on his first pitch to Tim Raines, his humerus bone snapped; the sound of it breaking could be heard throughout the stadium. Dravecky collapsed on the mound. He'd suffered a clean break midway between his shoulder and elbow, ending his season. The Giants won the National League pennant in 1989 (defeating the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS in five games), and in the post-game celebration, Dravecky's arm was broken a second time when he was running out to the mound to celebrate. A doctor examining Dravecky's x-rays noticed a mass in his arm, which turned out to be malignant. Dravecky's cancer had returned, ending his career. Eighteen days later, Dravecky retired from baseball with a 64‚Äì57 record with 558 strikeouts and a 3.13 ERA in 1,062‚Öî innings. He won the 1989 Willie Mac Award honoring his spirit and leadership. === Retirement and later career === After two more surgeries, his left arm continued to deteriorate, and on June 18, 1991, less than two years after his comeback with the Giants, Dravecky's left arm and shoulder were amputated. After recovering from the surgery, Dravecky went on to begin a new career as a motivational speaker. Dravecky wrote two books about his battles with cancer and his comeback attempt: Comeback, published in 1990 and written with Tim Stafford, and When You Can't Come Back, coauthored with wife Jan and Ken Gire and published in 1992. He has also written a Christian motivational book, \\"Called Up\\", published in 2004 by Zondervan. With the help of Stafford, Dravecky saw Comeback republished as a self-titled autobiography for children in 1992. ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Outreach of Hope Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:San Diego Padres players Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:National League All-Stars Category:Baseball players from Ohio Category:American motivational speakers Category:American Christian writers Category:John Birch Society members Category:Sportspeople from Youngstown, Ohio Category:American amputees Category:Amarillo Gold Sox players Category:Cancer survivors Category:Hawaii Islanders players Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Charleston Pirates players Category:Phoenix Firebirds players Category:San Jose Giants players Category:Youngstown State Penguins baseball players ","title":"Dave Dravecky"},{"id":"306343","text":"In mathematics, the Rayleigh quotientAlso known as the Rayleigh‚ÄìRitz ratio; named after Walther Ritz and Lord Rayleigh. () for a given complex Hermitian matrix M and nonzero vector x is defined as: :R(M,x) = {x^{*} M x \\\\over x^{*} x}. For real matrices and vectors, the condition of being Hermitian reduces to that of being symmetric, and the conjugate transpose x^{*} to the usual transpose x'. Note that R(M, c x) = R(M,x) for any non-zero scalar c. Recall that a Hermitian (or real symmetric) matrix is diagonalizable with only real eigenvalues. It can be shown that, for a given matrix, the Rayleigh quotient reaches its minimum value \\\\lambda_\\\\min (the smallest eigenvalue of M) when x is v_\\\\min (the corresponding eigenvector). Similarly, R(M, x) \\\\leq \\\\lambda_\\\\max and R(M, v_\\\\max) = \\\\lambda_\\\\max. The Rayleigh quotient is used in the min-max theorem to get exact values of all eigenvalues. It is also used in eigenvalue algorithms (such as Rayleigh quotient iteration) to obtain an eigenvalue approximation from an eigenvector approximation. The range of the Rayleigh quotient (for any matrix, not necessarily Hermitian) is called a numerical range and contains its spectrum. When the matrix is Hermitian, the numerical range is equal to the spectral norm. Still in functional analysis, \\\\lambda_\\\\max is known as the spectral radius. In the context of C*-algebras or algebraic quantum mechanics, the function that to M associates the Rayleigh‚ÄìRitz quotient R(M,x) for a fixed x and M varying through the algebra would be referred to as \\"vector state\\" of the algebra. In quantum mechanics, the Rayleigh quotient gives the expectation value of the observable corresponding to the operator M for a system whose state is given by x. If we fix the complex matrix M, then the resulting Rayleigh quotient map (considered as a function of x) completely determines M via the polarization identity; indeed, this remains true even if we allow M to be non-Hermitian. (However, if we restrict the field of scalars to the real numbers, then the Rayleigh quotient only determines the symmetric part of M.) ==Bounds for Hermitian M== As stated in the introduction, for any vector x, one has R(M,x) \\\\in \\\\left[\\\\lambda_\\\\min, \\\\lambda_\\\\max \\\\right], where \\\\lambda_\\\\min, \\\\lambda_\\\\max are respectively the smallest and largest eigenvalues of M. This is immediate after observing that the Rayleigh quotient is a weighted average of eigenvalues of M: :R(M,x) = {x^{*} M x \\\\over x^{*} x} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\lambda_i y_i^2}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2} where (\\\\lambda_i, v_i) is the ith eigenpair after orthonormalization and y_i = v_i^* x is the ith coordinate of x in the eigenbasis. It is then easy to verify that the bounds are attained at the corresponding eigenvectors v_\\\\min, v_\\\\max. The fact that the quotient is a weighted average of the eigenvalues can be used to identify the second, the third, ... largest eigenvalues. Let \\\\lambda_{\\\\max} = \\\\lambda_1 \\\\ge \\\\lambda_2 \\\\ge \\\\cdots \\\\ge \\\\lambda_n = \\\\lambda_{\\\\min} be the eigenvalues in decreasing order. If n=2 and x is constrained to be orthogonal to v_1, in which case y_1 = v_1^*x = 0 , then R(M,x) has maximum value \\\\lambda_2, which is achieved when x = v_2. ==Special case of covariance matrices== An empirical covariance matrix M can be represented as the product A'A of the data matrix A pre- multiplied by its transpose A'. Being a positive semi-definite matrix, M has non-negative eigenvalues, and orthogonal (or orthogonalisable) eigenvectors, which can be demonstrated as follows. Firstly, that the eigenvalues \\\\lambda_i are non-negative: :M v_i = A' A v_i = \\\\lambda_i v_i :\\\\Rightarrow v_i' A' A v_i = v_i' \\\\lambda_i v_i :\\\\Rightarrow \\\\left\\\\ A v_i \\\\right\\\\^2 = \\\\lambda_i \\\\left\\\\ v_i \\\\right\\\\^2 :\\\\Rightarrow \\\\lambda_i = \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\ A v_i \\\\right\\\\^2}{\\\\left\\\\ v_i \\\\right\\\\^2} \\\\geq 0. Secondly, that the eigenvectors v_i are orthogonal to one another: :\\\\begin{align} &M; v_i = \\\\lambda _i v_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\Rightarrow v_j' M v_i = v_j' \\\\lambda _i v_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\Rightarrow \\\\left (M v_j \\\\right )' v_i = \\\\lambda_j v_j' v_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\Rightarrow \\\\lambda_j v_j ' v_i = \\\\lambda _i v_j' v_i \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\Rightarrow \\\\left (\\\\lambda_j - \\\\lambda_i \\\\right ) v_j ' v_i = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\Rightarrow v_j ' v_i = 0 \\\\end{align} if the eigenvalues are different ‚Äì in the case of multiplicity, the basis can be orthogonalized. To now establish that the Rayleigh quotient is maximized by the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue, consider decomposing an arbitrary vector x on the basis of the eigenvectors v_i: :x = \\\\sum _{i=1} ^n \\\\alpha _i v_i, where :\\\\alpha_i = \\\\frac{x'v_i}{{v_i}'{v_i}} = \\\\frac{\\\\langle x,v_i\\\\rangle}{\\\\left\\\\ v_i \\\\right\\\\ ^2} is the coordinate of x orthogonally projected onto v_i. Therefore, we have: :\\\\begin{align}R(M,x) &= \\\\frac{x' A' A x}{x' x} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{ \\\\Bigl( \\\\sum _{j=1} ^n \\\\alpha _j v_j \\\\Bigr)' \\\\left ( A' A \\\\right ) \\\\Bigl(\\\\sum _{i=1} ^n \\\\alpha _i v_i \\\\Bigr)}{ \\\\bigl( \\\\sum _{j=1} ^n \\\\alpha _j v_j \\\\Bigr)' \\\\Bigl( \\\\sum _{i=1} ^n \\\\alpha _i v_i \\\\Bigr)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{ \\\\Bigl( \\\\sum _{j=1} ^n \\\\alpha _j v_j \\\\Bigr)'\\\\Bigl(\\\\sum _{i=1} ^n \\\\alpha _i (A' A) v_i \\\\Bigr)}{ \\\\bigl( \\\\sum _{i=1}^n \\\\alpha _i^2 {v_i}'{v_i} \\\\Bigr)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\frac{ \\\\Bigl( \\\\sum _{j=1} ^n \\\\alpha _j v_j \\\\Bigr)'\\\\Bigl(\\\\sum _{i=1} ^n \\\\alpha _i \\\\lambda_i v_i \\\\Bigr)}{ \\\\bigl( \\\\sum _{i=1}^n \\\\alpha _i^2 \\\\{v_i}\\\\^2 \\\\Bigr)} \\\\end{align} which, by orthonormality of the eigenvectors, becomes: :R(M,x) = \\\\frac{\\\\sum _{i=1} ^n \\\\alpha_i^2 \\\\lambda _i}{\\\\sum _{i=1} ^n \\\\alpha_i^2} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\lambda_i \\\\frac{(x'v_i)^2}{ (x'x)( v_i' v_i)} The last representation establishes that the Rayleigh quotient is the sum of the squared cosines of the angles formed by the vector x and each eigenvector v_i, weighted by corresponding eigenvalues. If a vector x maximizes R(M,x), then any non-zero scalar multiple kx also maximizes R, so the problem can be reduced to the Lagrange problem of maximizing \\\\sum _{i=1}^n \\\\alpha_i^2 \\\\lambda _i under the constraint that \\\\sum _{i=1} ^n \\\\alpha _i ^2 = 1. Define: \\\\beta_i=\\\\alpha_i^2. This then becomes a linear program, which always attains its maximum at one of the corners of the domain. A maximum point will have \\\\alpha_1 = \\\\pm 1 and \\\\alpha _i = 0 for all i > 1 (when the eigenvalues are ordered by decreasing magnitude). Thus, the Rayleigh quotient is maximized by the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue. === Formulation using Lagrange multipliers === Alternatively, this result can be arrived at by the method of Lagrange multipliers. The first part is to show that the quotient is constant under scaling x \\\\to cx, where c is a scalar :R(M,cx) = \\\\frac {(cx)^{*} M cx} {(cx)^{*} cx} = \\\\frac {c^{*} c} {c^{*} c} \\\\frac {x^{*} M x} {x^{*} x} = R(M,x). Because of this invariance, it is sufficient to study the special case \\\\x\\\\^2 = x^Tx = 1. The problem is then to find the critical points of the function :R(M,x) = x^T M x , subject to the constraint \\\\x\\\\^2 = x^Tx = 1. In other words, it is to find the critical points of :\\\\mathcal{L}(x) = x^T M x -\\\\lambda \\\\left (x^Tx - 1 \\\\right), where \\\\lambda is a Lagrange multiplier.

Therefore, the eigenvectors x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n of M are the critical points of the Rayleigh quotient and their corresponding eigenvalues \\\\lambda_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda_n are the stationary values of \\\\mathcal{L}.

In preparation for decimalisation on 15 February 1971, it was also priced on the dustjacket at ¬£1.25. The US edition retailed at $5.95. The novel features Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and the mystery novelist Ariadne Oliver, who begins the novel in attendance at a Hallowe'en party. A girl at the party claims she witnessed a murder, which, at the time, she was too young to realize was a murder. Soon, the girl herself is found murdered, and Oliver calls in Poirot. This book was dedicated to P.G. Wodehouse. A review at the time of publication and another 20 years later both felt this story was not one of Agatha Christie's best, \\"a disappointment\\", a novel littered with loose ends and unrealized characters. ==Plot summary== At a Hallowe'en party held at Rowena Drake's home in Woodleigh Common, thirteen- year-old Joyce Reynolds tells everyone attending she had once seen a murder, but had not realised it was one until later. When the party ends, Joyce is found dead, having been drowned in an apple-bobbing tub. Ariadne Oliver, attending the party while visiting her friend Judith Butler, calls on Hercule Poirot to investigate the murder and Joyce's claim. With help from retired Superintendent Spence, Poirot makes a list of deaths and disappearances for the last few years in Woodleigh Common: Rowena's aunt, Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe, died suddenly; her au pair Olga Seminoff disappeared, when a codicil that favoured her in her employer's will was found to be a forgery; Leslie Ferrier, a lawyer's clerk, was stabbed in the back by an unknown assailant; Charlotte Benfield, a sixteen-year-old shop assistant, was found dead with multiple head injuries; and Janet White, a teacher at Elms School, was strangled to death. Poirot learns a few interesting facts: Judith's daughter Miranda was Joyce's closest friend, and the pair shared secrets between them; Joyce was known to be a teller of tales to gain attention; Elizabeth Whittaker, a mathematics teacher attending the party, witnessed Rowena become startled and drop a glass vase of water outside the door of the library, while the party-goers were playing snapdragon; Ferrier had previous convictions for forgery, and many suspected that he and Olga were working together to steal Mrs Llewellyn- Smythe's fortune; a one-time cleaner of Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe had been witness to her employer making the codicil; a beautiful garden built within an abandoned quarry for Mrs Llewellyn-Smythe, was designed by Michael Garfield, a man with narcissistic behaviour; the victim's brother, Leopold Reynolds, has become flush with money of late. Leopold is later found dead, having been drowned in a small brook. Rowena, unusually upset about the death, informs Poirot she had seen him in the library the night of the party, and believes he witnessed his sister's killer. Poirot soon has a theory, and advises the police to search the woods near the quarry. The search turns up Olga's body in an abandoned well, having been stabbed in the same manner as Ferrier. Fearing another murder, Poirot sends a telegram to Mrs Oliver, instructing her to take Judith and her daughter to London as quickly as possible. However, Miranda disappears when the group stop for lunch, and meets up with Garfield, who takes her to a pagan sacrificial altar with the intention of poisoning her. However, he commits suicide when two men, recruited by Poirot to trail Miranda, thwart him and save her life. Once in safety, Miranda reveals that she had witnessed the murder Joyce claimed she had seen; more precisely, she saw Garfield and Rowena drag Olga's body through the quarry garden and only later realized she had witnessed a murder. Poirot tells Mrs Oliver what he has learned. While her husband was alive, Rowena began an affair with Garfield. Her aunt discovered this, and as a punishment, she wrote a codicil that left her fortune to Olga. When the pair learnt of this, they plotted to discredit Olga's claim, hiring Ferrier to replace the real codicil with a clumsy forgery that could be easily spotted, ensuring Rowena inherited everything as stipulated in earlier wills; the real codicil was not destroyed and later found. Both Olga and Ferrier were murdered to conceal the deceit, though Rowena suspected someone had witnessed the disposal of Olga's body. She killed Joyce when she claimed she had witnessed a murder, unaware that she had appropriated Miranda's story as her own. The dropping of the vase of water, which Mrs Whittaker witnessed, was to disguise the fact Rowena was already wet from drowning Joyce. Leopold was murdered because he had witnessed Rowena murdering his sister and subsequently blackmailed her. With his theory, Poirot muses that Rowena would likely have shared a similar fate to Olga, as Garfield's motivation for the murder was his narcissistic desire to construct another perfect garden with Rowena's money; he would have had no further need of her, as she had already provided him with a Greek island she had secretly purchased. Poirot reveals further that Garfield was Miranda's father; Judith is not a widow, but a single mother. She had met Garfield years before, and encountered him by accident when settling in the area with Miranda. While Garfield knew Miranda was his daughter, he was willing to kill his own child to ensure he could create another garden. Satisfied with his help, Judith thanks Poirot and leaves, though the story ends with a few questions unanswered, including whether Mr Drake's death was an accident, and if the police took Mrs Drake to trial. ==Characters== * Hercule Poirot - Belgian detective, asked to help investigate the murder of Joyce Reynolds by his friend Oliver. * Ariadne Oliver - Crime fiction writer and Poirot's friend.

Guest stars include Deborah Findlay as Rowena Drake, Julian Rhind-Tutt as Michael Garfield, Amelia Bullmore as Judith Butler, and Fenella Woolgar as Elizabeth Whittaker. Charles Palmer (who also directed The Clocks for the series) directs this instalment, with the screenplay written by Mark Gatiss (who wrote the screenplay for Cat Among the Pigeons; he also appeared as a guest star in the adaptation of Appointment with Death). The television adaptation shifted the late 1960s setting to the 1930s, as with nearly all shows in this series. Other specific changes include: * Omitted from the adaptation are the characters of Ann Reynolds, Superintendent Spence, Alfred Richmond, Elspeth McKay, Miss Emlyn, Harriet Leaman, Dr Ferguson, Mr Goby, Nicholas Ransom, and Desmond Holland, along with the location of The Elms School, and the investigation into Charlotte Benfield's death. * Reverend Mr Cottrell and Frances and Edmund Drake are new characters to the story ‚Äì Cottrell ran a program that supplied au pairs, including Olga, which went downhill when Olga disappeared; Frances and Edmund are Rowena's children, with Frances having been involved in a relationship with Leslie Ferrier * The garden in the novel is changed from being built in an abandoned quarry, to being a part of the estate owned by Rowena. * Mrs Goodbody is more involved in the story ‚Äì she is consulted by Poirot over deaths that happened over the past few years, that could have been murders witnessed by Joyce. * Certain events and clues were changed ‚Äì Joyce's appropriation of stories is revealed by Cottrell; Mrs Oliver witnesses Rowena purposely dropping the vase of water near the library; Oliver is bedridden for most of the case following the party, until the end; the fake codicil is revealed by Mr Fullerton, while the real one is found in a picture frame in Lesley's possession; Leopold's body is found by Elizabeth Whittaker, and the scene visited by Poirot; Rowena comes to Poirot twice, before and after Leopold's murder, to give false reasons for her dropping the vase and where he was during the party. * Janet White's first name is changed to Beatrice, and her death was a result of suicide by drowning, due to personal issues‚Äì-she could not deal with people commenting about her sexuality, and so decided to end it all, leaving a note to Whittaker, who had loved her. Whittaker hid the note to prevent Janet being given an unconsecrated grave. * A major number of changes were made for the final scene, including the denouement: ** Judith and Miranda are not taken away by Poirot, but Miranda sneaks out of her mother's home to meet Garfield. ** Garfield is caught by the police while trying to kill Miranda in a pagan fashion at the garden, and does not kill himself with poison. ** Olga's body is found after the arrest of Garfield and Rowena. There is no well or knife found with it. The motive for her murder was modified ‚Äì Garfield was not her lover, whilst Rowena was confronted about the codicil, as Olga knew she must have had it switched for a fake one and knew she was having an affair with Garfield. Her body was buried by Garfield only, witnessed by Miranda who was visiting the garden at the time of Olga's murder. ** The death of Rowena's husband is explained in the adaptation as being murder, committed by Garfield for Rowena and blamed on young tearaways. ** Rowena learns from Garfield the truth, in that he was only interested in the money and making a new garden, never loving her, and thus quickly hates him as a result. ===Graphic novel=== Hallowe-en Party was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 3 November 2008, adapted and illustrated by \\"Chandre\\" (). ==References== ==External links== *Hallowe'en Party at the official Agatha Christie website *Hallowe'en Party at the new official Agatha Christie website * Category:1969 British novels Category:Collins Crime Club books Category:Halloween novels Category:Hercule Poirot novels Category:Novels adapted into television shows Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:Novels set in the 1960s Category:Novels set in the United Kingdom Category:Works originally published in Woman's Own ","title":"Hallowe'en Party"},{"id":"306345","text":"Alfred Willi Rudolf Dutschke (; 7 March 1940 ‚Äì 24 December 1979) was a German Marxist sociologist and a political activist in the German student movement and the APO protest movement of the 1960s.Ali, Tariq. Street-Fighting Years: An Autobiography of the Sixties. Verso Books. London. 2005. He advocated a \\"long march through the institutions of power\\" to create radical change from within government and society by becoming an integral part of the machinery.. This was an idea he took up from his interpretation of Antonio Gramsci and the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory;. accordingly, the quote is often wrongfully attributed to Gramsci.q:Antonio Gramsci In the 1970s he followed through on this idea by joining the nascent Green movement. His grave in Berlin-Dahlem He survived an assassination attempt by Josef Bachmann in 1968, but died 11 years later from a seizure brought on from brain damage sustained during the assassination attempt. Radical students blamed an anti-student campaign in the papers of the Axel Springer publishing empire for the assassination attempt. This led to attempts to blockade the distribution of Springer newspapers all over Germany, which in turn led to major street battles in many German cities, considered the largest protests to that date in Germany.. ==Early life== Dutschke was born in Sch√∂nefeld (present-day Nuthe- Urstromtal) near Luckenwalde, Brandenburg, the 4th son of a postal clerk. Raised in East Germany (GDR), he attended school and graduated from the Gymnasium there. Interested in the ideas of religious socialism, he was engaged in the youth organisation of the East German Evangelical Church. In 1956 he joined the socialist Free German Youth aiming at a sporting career as a decathlete. In the same year he witnessed the Hungarian Uprising and began to advocate the ideals of a democratic socialism beyond the official line of the Socialist Unity Party. He obtained his Abitur degree in 1958 and completed an apprenticeship as an industrial clerk. As he refused to join the East Germany National People's Army and convinced many of his fellow students to refuse as well, he was prevented from attending university in the GDR. In August 1961, Dutschke fled to the Marienfelde transit camp in West Berlin, just three days before the Berlin Wall was built. He began to study sociology, ethnology, philosophy and history at the Free University of Berlin under Richard L√∂wenthal and Klaus Meschkat where he became acquainted with the existentialist theories of Martin Heidegger and Jean-Paul Sartre, and soon after also with alternative views of Marxism and the history of the labour movement. Dutschke joined the German SDS Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (which was not the same as the SDS in the US, but quite similar in goals) in 1965 and from that time on the SDS became the center of the student movement, growing very rapidly and organizing demonstrations against the war in Vietnam. He married the American Gretchen Klotz (de) in 1966. They had three children. Dutschke's third child, 1980-born Rudi-Marek Dutschke was born after his father's death. He is a politician of the German Green Party. as well as Dean's Office staffer of the Hertie School of Governance. today. His older siblings are Hosea-Che Dutschke (named after the Old Testament minor prophet Hosea and Che Guevara) and their sister Polly-Nicole, both born in 1968. ==Political views== Influenced by critical theory, Rosa Luxemburg, and critical Marxists and informed through his collaboration with fellow students from Africa and Latin America, Dutschke developed a theory and code of practice of social change via the practice of developing democracy in the process of revolutionizing society, collaborating with foreign students.. Dutschke also advocated that the transformation of Western societies should go hand in hand with Third World liberation movements and with democratization in communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. He was from a pious Lutheran family and his socialism had strongly Christian roots; he called Jesus Christ the \\"greatest revolutionary\\", and in Easter 1963, he wrote that \\"Jesus is risen. The decisive revolution in world history has happened ‚Äì a revolution of all-conquering love. If people would fully receive this revealed love into their own existence, into the reality of the 'now', then the logic of insanity could no longer continue.\\". Benno Ohnesorg's death in 1967 at the hands of German police pushed some in the student movement toward increasingly extremist violence and the formation of the Red Army Faction. The violence against Dutschke further radicalised parts of the student movement into committing several bombings and murders. Dutschke rejected this direction and feared that it would harm or cause the dissolution of the student movement. Instead he advocated a 'long march through the institutions' of power to create radical change from within government and society by becoming an integral part of the machinery. The meaning of Dutschke's idea of a \\"long march through the institutions\\" is in fact highly contested: most historians of '68 in West Germany understand it to mean advocating setting up an alternative society and recreating the institutions which were seen by Dutschke as beyond reform in their current state. It is highly unlikely Dutschke would have promoted change from within the parliamentary and judicial system, which were populated by former Nazis and political conservatives.. This is made clear in the SDS reaction to the Kiesinger-led CDU-SPD grand coalition and the authoritarian Emergency Laws they passed. Memorial plate for Rudi Dutschke at Kurf√ºrstendamm and Joachim-Friedrich Stra√üe in Berlin, Germany ==Shooting and later life== On 11 April 1968, Dutschke was shot in the head by a young anti-communist, Josef Bachmann. Dutschke survived the assassination attempt, and he and his family went to the United Kingdom in the hope that he could recuperate there. Dutschke and Bachmann shared correspondence over the next year, until Bachmann's suicide in 1970. Dutschke was accepted at Clare Hall, a graduate college at the University of Cambridge, to finish his degree in 1969, but in 1971 the Conservative government under Edward Heath expelled him and his family as an \\"undesirable alien\\" who had engaged in \\"subversive activity\\", causing a political storm in London. They then moved to √Örhus, Denmark, after professor Johannes Sl√∏k had offered him a job at the University of Aarhus which made it possible for Dutschke to gain a Danish residence permit. Dutschke re-entered the German political scene after protests against the building of nuclear power plants activated a new movement in the mid-1970s. He also began working with dissidents opposing the Communist governments in East Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia, including Robert Havemann, Wolf Biermann, Milan Hor√°ƒçek, Adam Michnik and others. Because of brain damage sustained in the assassination attempt, Dutschke continued to suffer health problems. He died on 24 December 1979 in √Örhus. He had an epileptic seizure while in the bathtub and drowned. In 2018, it emerged that Rudolf Augstein, publisher of Der Spiegel, provided financial support to Dutschke so he could continue to work on his dissertations. Between 1970 and 1973, he paid 1,000 German Marks per year. At the same time they started an exchange of letters in which they also discussed the student revolts. ==Works== * . * (1963‚Äì1979). * . ==Bibliography== * . * Michaela Karl: Rudi Dutschke ‚Äì Revolution√§r ohne Revolution.

She is a mystery novelist and a friend of Hercule Poirot. ==Profile== Mrs Oliver often assists Poirot in his cases through her knowledge of the criminal mind. She often claims to be endowed with particular \\"feminine intuition\\", but it usually leads her astray. She is particularly fond of apples, which becomes a plot point in the novel Hallowe'en Party. In the books, Oliver's most famous works are those featuring her vegetarian Finnish detective Sven Hjerson. Since she knows nothing of Finland, Oliver frequently laments Hjerson's existence. In many of her appearances, Oliver ‚Äì and her feelings toward Hjerson ‚Äì reflect Agatha Christie's own frustrations as an author, particularly with the Belgian Hercule Poirot (an example of self-insertion). The self-caricature has also been used to discuss Christie's own follies in her earlier novels. For instance, in Mrs McGinty's Dead, Mrs Oliver talks of having made the blowpipe a foot long (30 cm) in one of her novels, whereas the actual length is something like four-and-a-half feet () ‚Äì the same mistake Christie made in Death in the Clouds. In The Pale Horse, Mrs Oliver becomes acquainted with the Rev. and Mrs Dane Calthorp, who are friends of Miss Marple (The Moving Finger), thus establishing that Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot exist in the same world. In Cards on the Table, there is a reference to Mrs Oliver's book The Body in the Library; this title was used by Christie six years later, for a novel featuring Miss Marple. Books by Ariadne Oliver and by a number of other fictitious mystery writers are discussed by characters in The Clocks (1963). Like Christie, she is a member of the Detection Club. Christie even thought of setting a murder at the Club with Oliver being one of the suspects as well as the detective, but it came to nothing.Agatha Christie's Secret Notebooks, edited by John Curran. (Although in Cards on the Table, Mrs Oliver plays detective in a Poirot mystery of a murder during a bridge game.) A family crisis for Oliver's goddaughter Celia provides the plot in Elephants Can Remember. Although Ariadne Oliver is consistently referred to as \\"Mrs Oliver,\\" nothing is known about her husband. An offhand reference to her marriage is made in Elephants Can Remember. In a short piece in John Bull Magazine in 1956, Christie was quoted as saying: \\"I never take my stories from real life, but the character of Ariadne Oliver does have a strong dash of myself.\\" The author of the article went on to state: \\"It is perfectly true that sometimes she works at her stories in a large old-fashioned bath, eating apples and depositing the cores on the wide mahogany surround.\\"John Bull Magazine, 11 August 1956. Volume 100, Number 2615 (p. 3) ==Literary function== Even in one of the two novels in which she appears without Poirot (The Pale Horse), Mrs Oliver does not function as a detective, in that she rarely participates in the investigation and contributes only tangentially to the solution. In Cards on the Table, she does interview some of the suspects, which in turn allows her to discover a hidden motive that even the police were unable to find; in Elephants Can Remember, she again interviews witnesses, but none of the essential ones. She is more usually used for comic relief or to provide a deus ex machina through her intuitive or sudden insights, a function that is especially apparent in Third Girl, in which she furnishes Poirot with virtually every important clue, or in The Pale Horse, where she inadvertently helps the investigators to determine the type of poison used to kill the murder victims, saving the life of another character. Further functions of Mrs Oliver are to enable Christie to discuss overtly the techniques of detective fiction, to contrast the more fanciful apparatus employed by mystery authors with the apparent realism of her own plots, and to satirize Christie's own experiences and instincts as a writer. ==Literary appearances== The true first appearance of Mrs Oliver was a brief appearance in the short story \\"The Case of the Discontented Soldier\\" which was first published, along with four other stories, in the August 1932 issue of the U.S. version of Cosmopolitan magazine (issue number 554) under the sub-heading of Are You Happy? If Not Consult Mr. Parker Pyne. The story first appeared in the UK in issue 614 of Woman's Pictorial on 15 October 1932, and was later published in book form in 1934 as Parker Pyne Investigates (titled Mr. Parker Pyne, Detective in the USA). Within this story she appeared as part of Pyne's unorthodox team of freelance assistants. Within the same book, she also briefly appears in The Case of the Rich Woman. All her subsequent appearances (save The Pale Horse) were in Poirot novels: * Cards on the Table (1936) * Mrs McGinty's Dead (1952) * Dead Man's Folly (1956) * The Pale Horse (1961) ‚Äì Oliver's only appearance in a Christie novel without Poirot * Third Girl (1966) * Hallowe'en Party (1969) * Elephants Can Remember (1972) * Hercule Poirot and the Greenshore Folly (2014) ‚Äì a novella that was later expanded and published as Dead Man's Folly. An advert for Ariadne Oliver's With Vinegar and Brown Paper (as with Agatha Christie using nursery rhyme references) appears in the Frontispiece of Mark Gatiss's book The Devil in Amber along with other adverts for made-up books.Interview: Mark Gatiss  Books  The Observer In And Then There Were None, a character, Emily Brent, mistakes the name Mrs. Owen for a Mrs. Oliver, perhaps an in-joke that Emily Brent and Ariadne Oliver may have encountered each other at one point. ==Portrayals== ===Ariadne Oliver=== The first appearance of Ariadne Oliver on television was in an episode of The Agatha Christie Hour (1982). In an adaptation of the Parker Pyne story \\"The Case of the Discontented Soldier\\", she was portrayed by Lally Bowers. A 1986 television film adaptation of Dead Man's Folly starred Jean Stapleton as Ariadne Oliver, opposite Peter Ustinov as Poirot. Zo√´ Wanamaker played Ariadne Oliver in six television episodes of the series Agatha Christie's Poirot, starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. In the last shot episode of the series (but not the finale), Mrs Oliver is helpful to Poirot in an adaptation of Dead Man's Folly, which was filmed on the Christie Estate. In the BBC Radio 4 plays, Ariadne Oliver has been played by Stephanie Cole (The Pale Horse (1993), Hallowe'en Party (1993), and Cards on the Table (2002)), and by Julia McKenzie (Elephants Can Remember (2006), Mrs McGinty's Dead (2006), and Dead Man's Folly (2007)). ===Sven Hjerson=== A Swedish-German television series Agatha Christie‚Äôs Hjerson will bring the character of Sven Hjerson, the Finland‚Äôs Swedish detective, to life. The series will combine Christie‚Äôs stories with Nordic noir. The characters will speak Swedish in the series, which will be set to contemporary time, and it will partly be photographed in √Öland. The four-part series will be produced by TV4, ZDF, Agatha Christie Ltd. and Government of √Öland, among others. ==Bibliography== Books: * The Lotus Murder (mentioned in Cards on the Table) * The Clue of the Candle Wax (mentioned in Cards on the Table) * The Body In The Library (mentioned in Cards on the Table) * The Death in the Drain Pipe (mentioned in Cards on the Table) * The Affair of the Second Goldfish (mentioned in Cards on the Table and Mrs McGinty's Dead) * The Cat it Was Who Died (mentioned in Mrs McGinty's Dead) * Death of a Debutante (mentioned in Mrs McGinty's Dead) * The Woman in the Wood (mentioned in and based on her experiences from Dead Man's Folly) * The Dying Goldfish (mentioned in Hallowe'en Party) Published articles: * The Tendency of the Criminal (mentioned in Cards on the Table) * Famous Crimes Passionnels (mentioned in Cards on the Table) * Murder for Love vs. Murder for Gain (mentioned in Cards on the Table) ==References== ==External links== *Ariadne Oliver at the official Agatha Christie website *Biography of Ariadne Oliver *Ariadne Oliver at Hercule Poirot Central Category:Fictional writers Category:Hercule Poirot characters Category:Author surrogates Category:Literary characters introduced in 1932 Category:Characters in British novels of the 20th century Category:Agatha Christie characters Category:Fictional contract bridge players Category:Female characters in literature ","title":"Ariadne Oliver"},{"id":"306348","text":"John Pope (February 1770 - July 12, 1845)encyclopediaofarkansas.net was a United States Senator from Kentucky, a member of the United States House of Representatives from Kentucky, Secretary of State of Kentucky, and the third Governor of Arkansas Territory. ==Early life and education== Pope was born in Prince William County, Virginia in 1770. He lost his arm during his youth and was known as \\"One-Arm Pope\\". He attended school at Salem Academy in Bardstown, Kentucky, and then graduated from the College of William & Mary. He studied law in Lexington under George Nicholas, primary author of the 1792 Kentucky constitution. He moved to Springfield, Kentucky where he was admitted to the bar. He practiced law in Washington, Shelby, and Fayette County, Kentucky. ==Political career== Pope served as the presidential elector from Kentucky in 1801, and was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1802. He served in the House again from 1806 to 1807. Pope was elected as a Jeffersonian Republican to the United States Senate, serving from 1807 to 1813, and served as President pro tempore of the Senate during the Eleventh Congress in 1810 and 1811. His vote against the War of 1812 made since he leaned toward the Federalist Party at that time, but political gossip attributed this unpopular political stance to his wife's influence (Eliza Johnson Pope was daughter of an Englishwoman, Catherine Nuth, wife of Joshua Johnson, and she had spent much of her youth in England). The political fall- out led to his not running for re-election at the end of his term in 1813. He and his wife returned to live in Lexington, Kentucky where he practiced law and taught at Transylvania University. Pope was appointed Secretary of State of Kentucky from 1816 to 1819, under Governor Gabriel Slaughter. He served as a member of the Kentucky Senate from 1825 to 1829, and was also elected three times to the United States House of Representatives, initially as an Independent; ; and then as a Whig, serving Kentucky's District 7 between 1837 and 1843. From 1829 to 1835, he served as the Governor of Arkansas Territory. During his term as governor he arranged for the construction of the Old State House by the Kentucky architect Gideon Shryock. It remains the oldest surviving state capitol west of the Mississippi River. ==Personal life== Pope was married to three socially well-connected women over his lifetime - outliving them all. In 1795 he married Anne Henry Christian (d. 1806), daughter of one of the first settlers of Louisville, Kentucky and niece of Patrick Henry. After Anne died, and while a U.S. Senator, serving as president pro tem, he remarried in 1810. He married well again this time to Elizabeth Janet Dorcas Johnson (1786-1818), daughter of Joshua Johnson, the first American Consul-General to England. Her sister, Louisa, was the wife of John Quincy Adams, who was at that time the U.S. Minister to Prussia and later, with John Pope's support, President of the United States. During this time, and primarily under the advisement of his wife Eliza, Pope built the avant- garde mansion in what was then on the edges of the \\"Athens of the West\\" Lexington, Kentucky which was designed by the noted American architect, Benjamin Henry Latrobe. After the death of Eliza his second wife, Pope resigned from his position as secretary of state of Kentucky (under Governor Gabriel Slaughter) and law professor at Transylvania University, and in 1820 he moved to Springfield, Kentucky. Mrs. Frances Watkins Walton of Washington County (1772-1843), widow of General Matthew Walton, founder of Springfield and state politician. At the time of her marriage to John Pope, Mrs. Walton was one of the wealthiest people in the state. After his marriage, Pope lived in his wife's home, Walton Manor, and practiced law from the older brick cottage in front of the mansion. When his daughter married in 1829, he sold the Pope Villa which he had been leasing out, and he sold the Walton Manor to her husband John Watkins Cocke. Pope and his wife then moved to Arkansas where he served as Territorial Governor until 1835. He returned to Springfield with his wife, and they built a new house for themselves. This smaller house is also on the National Register of Historic Places. He served as a Kentucky representative to Congress from 1837 to 1843; but, soon before his third wife died, he was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1842 to the Twenty- eighth Congress. He was also the brother of Nathaniel Pope, a prominent figure in early Illinois Territory, and the uncle to both John Pope, Union General in the Civil War and Daniel Pope Cook, another prominent politician in the early history of the state of Illinois. ==Death== John Pope died in Springfield, Kentucky on July 12, 1845, and is buried in Springfield Cemetery. ==Legacy== Pope Villa of Lexington, Kentucky was built by Benjamin Latrobe for him and his wife Eliza. It is only one of three extant Latrobe buildings in the U.S. Pope County, Arkansas is named for him. ==See also== * Thomas S.
